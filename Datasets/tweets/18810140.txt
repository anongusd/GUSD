@Adam4NY @SopanDeb For both of them, what they mean to the actual culture — what they created that no one else could have — is what’s really difficult factor into a legitimate valuation, but people don’t want to talk about it :-(
@SopanDeb I mean I have no idea but I’d guess for a lot of the same reasons.
This basically means if either led a mutiny in their industry for more equality, they could flip it upside down. Sounds honestly like LeBron’s close based on this last trade deadline.
Someone told me recently that you actually can’t do a *real* valuation of Drake, LeBron and others because their industries literally can’t afford them but still control them, so maybe that’s why they’re mad?

@IanSams @JesseLehrich @AndrewGillum I’d say they’d need to be inspired by something that’s just as irrational as a nationalist vision for our country. And that that thing is not truth-telling.
@IanSams @JesseLehrich @AndrewGillum I mean that’s one way of putting it but yes lol
@IanSams @JesseLehrich @AndrewGillum Nah. I’m talking about the people who *don’t want a leader*. People who literally do not care who the president of the United States is. That’s who Democrats need to work on IMO if you want to win.
@IanSams @JesseLehrich @AndrewGillum No one on food stamps with a sick mom and a sick baby and a job and home they hate and and bills coming out of their eyeballs wants to hear...how Trump’s medieval wall won’t work.
@IanSams I agree with that point but I don’t mean this observation as a criticism of either candidate like I said to @JesseLehrich but I think @AndrewGillum’s success was instructive in this way.
@JesseLehrich Absolutely true. But she’s definitely drawing a contrast and I don’t even mean this as a criticism. Their campaigns started like, 5 mins ago

Bobby Rush has his arms folded and he’s shaking his head at the president. Black lawmakers generally think Trump’s taking credit for Obama’s accomplishments, and though they might not admit, that he’s taking their credit, too.
Having been in that room before, the idea of Donald Trump in there right now  delivering  as president the SOTU at the beginning of 2019 is absolutely wild to me.

@LeahRigueur Yeah but they don’t, so I’m not interested when it’s a spectacle with likes and page views and cable hits. It’s vulturism and it’s gross and opportunistic and I personally know a lot of these people and know they really really DGAF.
@RayBakerMedia Read my whole analysis
@LeahRigueur Of course we can do both. It’s just that one’s easy and one’s hard, and people who say they’re dedicated to justice and equality always get off doing one and not the other to absolve themselves and I’m not participating.
This sort of attempt at humor represents something truly horrific and it really has no place in civil society, but are we really out here expressing an outrage at that and *not* at various, more insidious, injustices?
Blackface has always been a racist, metaphorical expression of racial anxiety and a failed attempt at humor that amounts to what it’s like to stab someone with a dull knife. A naked cruelty.

This is a mindless observation and a small sample, so warning there, but: from what I’ve seen, Harris eschews the phrase “President Trump,” while Warren and Gillibrand seem a bit more eager to throw it around.
The way Harris is approaching people’s questions with a sophisticated, and indeed Clintonian style of empathy, is the exact polar opposite of almost anything that’s been on TV for what seems like a lot of exasperating years.

@Ann_ieH And I'm saying if you are an immigrant in IA or anywhere, or immigration policy in this country affects you or you're family, you are going to remember what happened tonight three days, years, weeks, months, or years from now. Do you understand?

@LynchpinL @AOC @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib @AndrewGillum You can tell me your opinion w/o telling me what to do lol
And to steal a line from August Wilson, the question for progressives to folks obsessed with antiquated Washington seniority mores (that Obama exploded anyway) should be, “Now why do you think that is?”
In focus groups with young people, the largest voting demographic in the electorate, Democrats hear enthusiasm, hopefulness, ambition, a serious desire to beat Trump. And when they’re asked who the leaders of the party are?		Silence.
Imagine for a second that you’re 23 in Des Moines living at home after graduating from IA State and you’re furious at Trump. 		And then this is the image designed to excite you about beating him. https://t.co/B9znz23RRx
My hottest take: Young progressives who love new people like @AOC, @AyannaPressley, @RashidaTlaib and @AndrewGillum bc of the perception that, we’ll, they don’t GAF, will tire of 2020 candidate’s prudence and restraint.

Abrams has a defiant tone tonight. Doubling down on every last one of her campaign themes to frame the runoff, and tells voters who didn't vote for her or stayed out: "You're going to have a chance to get a do-over."
Abrams: "Tonight we have closed the gap between yesterday and tomorrow. But we still have a few more miles to go."
@LVBurke I had a rationale going into the decision but we basically flipped a coin!
RT @chriskromm: For those wondering, the #GAGov race needs to be within about 40,000 votes for a run-off.
Georgia is set to hear from Abrams shortly. About 90 minutes ago the mood was fairly dour but it’s picked up considerably, enough so the DJ is playing Pharrell.
Abrams’ (pretty great) campaign manager announces the campaign believes the race is going to a runoff based on the amount of absentee ballots and votes yet to be counted in Democratic strongholds. “This is not ending soon.”
Just witnessed an Abrams campaign staffer order four coffees from Starbucks. And almost everyone is still here. Someone just yelled out let’s go “Slay-cey!” Kemp at 51.38% of the vote with a few precincts yet to report.
Remember that if Brian Kemp doesn’t get the majority of the vote tonight the Georgia governor’s race goes to a runoff on Dec. 4. A few reasons to be optimistic if you’re an Abrams fan.
Obviously not all bad for Democrats tonight but one thing that will be discussed is how Democrats keep now dejected young people inspired by the Gillums and Betos of this cycle motivated.

There are still a ton of precincts coming in but the Stacey Abrams camp is trying everything to keep morale up as she trails. They just announced that Democrats are going to take back the House to cheers.

Breaking your racket is actually more of a tension release than it is a sign of anger.
There’s no “anger” in Serena’s reaction today. She was upset at her level, and strongly disagreed with the ref. Players *can* challenge them—it’s allowed and it’s the nature of the sport. Anger implies a lack of control, composure. Serena did not become the GOAT playing angry.

Good for Serena.
I always say the US Open is the greatest tournament in the world but I'm not sure that's true anymore. Clown show.
Look at Osaka. Crying. She was robbed. Serena was robbed. This is stupid.
This is an enormous blot on the game in so many ways. I'm disgusted and embarrassed by the chair umpire today. He robbed both women.
This is an embarrassment to tennis.
I'm disgusted.
If it were not for Serena this tournament would be completely irrelevant. For her to be treated this way in a final of a slam is unconscionable.
The chair umpire has it out for Serena Williams. That is not an exaggeration.
It's a sham and an embarassment to the game for a chair umpire to give a player a game at 4-3 in a GRAND SLAM because their feelings are hurt.
They just gave Osaka a game.		We have reached an unbelievable point.
Stunning stunning service break by Osaka. This point is about to be soooooo tense.
This is so wild.
@universalbell 🤣
Osaka played a million brawling points like that break point Serena had against Madison Keys. You just have to cut off the court against her and avoid those long points.
Enormous break point here.
That drop shot was just nasty.
US Open crowds are notoriously smitten with Osaka and have for a while now, so it's really no wonder Serena hasn't fed off the crowd much.
"I don't cheat to win, I'd rather lose." Serena's her own copywriter at this point.
Serena is actually in good shape here because say if she lost in tie break she'd be wiped out. She hasn't had to chase a ton of balls.
@TroyHalibur She's pretty tall too, but yes
Serena's gotta throw this set away and regroup.

@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites https://t.co/hqgAoS9E0R
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites But by this logic*
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites It most certainly is telling and I’m not denying, that by this logic reporters should have never uncovered the FBI was looking into Clinton’s emails, or BuzzFeed News should have never reported on the existence of the Trump peepee dossier
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites “Plus whether he said it isn’t going to change his polling among his base &amp; that is the real issue/story”		Not a reporter’s role.
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites It’s also not my role to try and change his base’s mind about how to feel about black people.
@ReignOfApril So why shouldn’t I have asked them? Because you already know he’s racist? And others do too? That doesn’t seem like a legitimate reason?
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites You’re right, it doesn’t mean that and it also isnt what I wasn’t trying to prove
@ReignOfApril @ReaganGomez I said impact is negligible and fair — and even right to discuss— but as reporters we run stories (and tweets smh) that have unintended impact. It gets us closer to a free press’ true role in democracy
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites My contribution is to try to find news, that’s all Ashley, sorry, I literally have no other motives and can understand if this upsets you, b/c asking this kinda stuff upsets me too
@ReignOfApril @ReaganGomez You’re so right and...some people who call black people their friends and even family think it’s perfectly okay. Both things are true. I am not trying to absolve anyone, or here to make a judgment about people’s intentions
@PriceAshleyE @BritniDWrites This is a flawed frame for a critique because it you and others seem not to understand that my aim/job is to not give people “opportunities” its to find truth.
@GaryGHamilton That is a fact. I think that’s a New York thing right? A function of black American and people of Latin descent living in close proximity? I don’t have research or anything, just an observation
@QueenMary_ @heyamine @darrensand Amen
@GaryGHamilton I have understood this as a phenomenon of hip hop becoming the main culture in the last, I dunno, 15 years or more. But could be for real
@RazThatguy @jsmooth995 @peacelovenadja @dancharnas Fact.
And as reporters we have a lot conversations lately between us about transparency around what we do — and discontent here is a complication of that movement, and it may be necessary to endure. Peace.
Last thing: I think it’s perfectly legitimate to critique this on grounds it can be weaponized to promote Trump’s innocence. But:		White people say nigga to and around us all the time. If you don’t know, ask @heyamine or literally any rapper or black kid with mad white friends!
@ReignOfApril @ReaganGomez Why is there no reason to think he would say it around then when a) they were friends and b) there was a whole rumor or him saying n this n that on a video? To me the possibility of its existence warranted asking the question. That’s what reporting does
@soulherenergy @KatrinaPierson I guess I understand and am even sensitive to this stuff, and I’m not trying to absolve the president of guilt or his racism. Pro-Trump people are weaponizing this, but I prefaced this whole thing with “FWIW” to signal, the reporting doesn’t amount to much.
@ReaganGomez I’m trying to understand your critique. You replying by saying figure it out doesn’t get me there Reagan
@tannenbaumr @ReaganGomez And the point is not what you say it is. The “point” is that this a group of people who say nigga ALL THE TIME said it wouldn’t have been acceptable for him to say it around them in the 90s. This is not absolving him don’t be daft
@tannenbaumr @ReaganGomez There is no story
@ReaganGomez So why shouldn’t I have asked them that question in your estimation?
@soulherenergy @KatrinaPierson Because I don’t know those people? I’d call anyone tho
@BritniDWrites As reporters we can’t ask people to comment on what they heard that other people heard. My question was about whether they heard that themselves. They didn’t — non-story after that. I’m not understanding the critique
@BritniDWrites So it’s questionable line of questioning to ask Russell and Diddy if he ever said that around them? What’s questionable about it?
@ReaganGomez What point do you think I’m trying to make? I’m just talking about I took two days I spent making a ton of calls before the election. I guess I’m down to be enlightened tho
@BritniDWrites This line of questioning was during the campaign of 2016 (when the rumors started) and while I of course understand feelings on him now, I didn’t ask him to make a moral judgment. I asked him a question
