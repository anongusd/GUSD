@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo ThebDems passed voter protections. The Dems' bill will do away with gerrymandering. Trump is a traitor and a criminal, yes, but have you covered in detail ANY of the Bill's Dems have passed since 2018?? I am not kissing your ass on this one Cuomo.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo That entire segment was nothing but BS. You REALLY don't think Democrats represent something better?? Are you REALLY both sides-ing the Dems and TRUMP???

@NicolleDWallace He is absolutely correct. Be proud of the work you do. You deserve it.
@JackSahko @CCMADONNA @realAliTweets Bernie JUST admitted on Chris Hayes that his campaign was too white and too Male. So tell me again there was no hint of racism or sexism in his campaign.

@StarryEyed48 @ltthompso @AOC Ikr?? The pace and intensity of the interrogation is creepy!
@ltthompso @AOC You are ragging on AOC about nepotism (which isn't even what's happening, if you read her response) when Donald Trump has his entire family on America's payroll?? Do you know what hypocrisy means?
@TheRickWilson What do you know??
@bubbz_daddy @AOC I would love to support her. I want her to support the cause of 2020, which is electing as many Dems as humanly possible.
@mediajunkie @AOC No, I do not need you to define ad hominem. I can do without your condescension. I am likely on your side.
@mediajunkie @AOC My argument is not so much with her stance on the Amazon issue but with the fact that she is the focus of the media today in an extremely negative way. She shouldn't be the story until Pelosi needs her to be the story. It isn't ad hominem.
@mediajunkie @AOC Ad hominem? She led the media narrative this morning, and it was universally bad. She should not be the story for the Dems, regardless of if the story is negative. But it IS negative. She's dragging the party down and is helping the Republicans.
@bgratefull @AOC @SpeakerPelosi Dems should be making sure the media is focused on our successes and Donald Trump's unfitness. AOC consistently becomes the story in really detrimental ways. Pelosi is strong, focused, effective and silent until she decides her voice will be useful. AOC needs to learn that.
@bgratefull @AOC @SpeakerPelosi My personal opinion is irrelevant. The media was slamming her this morning starting at 5 AM. She has normally friendly media saying this stunt she pulled is a positive for Trump. That is stupid IMO, no matter my opinion on the issue. The press should not be laser focused on her.
@Dave_in_Dayton @AOC Agree. This whole thing makes me want to hide under the covers.
@Milnoc @LeoNYC @AOC That money does not exist, so no one is going to see it. This is a lose for everyone except Republicans. AOC has written their 2020 media strategy for them. It's humiliating.
@noobfatherof1 @Fritz588_ @AOC And at this point it is stupid. All Dems have to do from now until Nov 2020 is NOT FUCK UP. Now we have the Northam VA debacle and the NYC Amazon debacle, and these are sucking up the media coverage. Our Dem candidates are not. This is awful.
@noobfatherof1 @Fritz588_ @AOC She is losing in the media across the ideological spectrum. Dems and Republicans are slamming her as we speak. All Trumpers care about Is perception. Getting down into the weeds on this issue might work for analysts and statisticians. Losing the media narrative is devastating
@AOC @AOC You are single handedly losing 2020 for your party. To say it differently, you're handing the country back to Trump after a string of PR and electoral successes by Dems. @SpeakerPelosi PLEASE sit her down and lay down the law.
@JBorzumato @Used_2_be_Ron @jmflynn74 @Cruelabduhl @NoblePublius @LostSoldier20 @arshForek @AOC People are fleeing to the Southeast? I really hope that's not true. State govts down here are living in the 18th century. TN and NC are trying to criminalize gay marriage. It's a social liberal's nightmare. Please do research, but I advise people to stay away.
@AOC You're getting dragged this morning, AOC. This whole Amazon thing is embarrassing, and you are writing Repub's ads for them. AOC turns away 25,000+ jobs. AOC doesn't understand the basics. AOC's fan base is Twitter. You need a babysitter for Twitter and for your mouth.

@bryanbehar I learned this just recently on facebook, which I've been largely avoiding for over a week. After the Northam blackface incident, I found racists, sexists, enablers and defenders of racism, people who justified blackface by saying 1984 was a different time, we should forgive, etc

@visualvamp1 @realDonaldTrump And she did apologize. It's been on TV all weekend. Of course, you only watch Fox so they would not give you the actual news. Her family told her she had Native Am ancestors. She believed them. I don't understand why this is such a big deal.

@KrystyniakKaren @RayellenLove @CoryBooker Stormy did not accuse Trump. She admits it was consensual. Ford gave all the money she did not use for security and multiple moves due to threats and harassment by Trumpers, to sexual assault organizations. Trump just grabs em by the pussy and denies 19 credible accusations.
@JayLowell2 @RayellenLove @CoryBooker Talking about Northam, of course. And let's also talk about Brett Kavanaugh? Who fought tooth and nail his nomination? Democrats did. Republicans put him on the fucking SC. So you literally have nothing to stand on here.
@JayLowell2 @RayellenLove @CoryBooker Every elected Democrat, both nationally and in the state of VA, is calling on him to resign. The fact that he refuses to is on him, not Democrats. Now let's talk about Steve King.
@BABYRENEE77 @RayellenLove @CoryBooker Y'all will twist yourselves into pretzels to defend Mr. Grab 'em by the pussy.
@BABYRENEE77 @RayellenLove @CoryBooker He has 19 credible sexual assault accusations against him. His ex wife, under oath, accused him of raping her.  JFC. The hypocrisy is stunning.
@RayellenLove @CoryBooker Absolutely.
@CoryBooker I am so proud that Democrats have a zero tolerance policy for racism and sexual assault. Democrats believe women. Republicans will tolerate just about anything. See Trump, Steve King and Kavanaugh, to name just a few. I'm proud to be on the team of moral consistency.
@KenidraRWoods_ Yes, absolutely.
@Nysteveo2AOLcom Both lying and a feeling of panic cause dry mouth, for real. Also, a liar often feels the need to be doing something with his or her hands, I believe.
@kap8200 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump We know all this because we read. Most of us have been to college. On top of that, we consume reputable, responsible media. The fact that you DON'T know all this is what should really concern you.

@MatthewBoedy Please, @RealCandaceO take some history classes!! Learn to think critically, without intellectual dishonesty. Words do not simply mean whatever you say they mean. I always say conservatives wouldn't know nuance if it slapped them in the face. Go to college!
@thecjpearson @RealCandaceO Um, we come for anyone who apologizes for Hitler, no matter what ignorant, dishonest thing she says to justify it. Seems like even conservatives would draw a line at fucking Hitler. But again, I expect too much of you people. Silly me.
@WalshFreedom So you think people should only make $7.25, no matter what the cost of living is?? That is not a living wage! Of you are qualified to work at McDonald's, you deserve a living wage. It's not "just because," you out of touch, greedy bastard. It's so people can live and eat.

@ananavarro Exactly. If he doesn't resign, he gives Republicans the whatabout ammunition they need. We do not need to be hobbled by that throughout the election. Also, what he did is just wrong, and we have to call it what it is. He must go.
@joshtpm I hope he sees this and decides accordingly. So far, he has characterised opposition to his run, (when he hasn't just ignored it) as bullying . @SteveSchmidtSES blamed Clinton voters for Trump and for opposition to Schultz. So not impressed by any part of this.
@CNNPolitics They put that shit in a yearbook???
@Liz_Cheney Yeah, lie much?? I thought Republicans were constitutional literalists. People in this country are free to be atheists. No one should have to swear to god if they don't believe in god. As for all ur other points, I'll let other people handle them, hypocrite.

@JillRTeamXRP @horowitz39 @RubenAle07 It floors me that Republicans aren't nearly as literalist and originalist re: The Constitution as they claim. Forcing everyone to say "under god" is plainly Unconstitutional. If you don't believe me, read it.
@horowitz39 Oh this makes me so happy, and even more excited to support the Democratic party. 1st Amendment. Congress shall make no law, etc. Separation of church and state is not "atheistic." It is literally Constitutional. Either y'all want a Democracy or a Theocracy. Can't have both.

@tedlieu @HowardSchultz He lies about Dems to make himself look more reasonable. Which Dem candidate supports "free college?" Which Dem candidate advocates "free govt jobs?" Not one.

For god's sake, I get that you don't like her, but can you act like mature adults who understand the importance of history, of this specific event, for 30 seconds?
@MissGloop @regnisaw @SpeakerPelosi In a tweet that remembered the fucking Holocaust! I hate these people with every cell in my body.
@regnisaw @SpeakerPelosi People who diminish the evil that was the Holocaust in any way, especially on fucking Holocaust Remembrance day, is worse than deplorable. It's disgraceful. It's shameful. Trump voters are an embarrassment to this nation.

@CmonMang @KyleJamesonS @BrakTalk @MagPieSC1972 @warrenj0seph @LauraJoy70 @KirstenPowers Way to dismiss the guy's intention. He did not "walk up and start banging a drum." He walked into the middle of two groups who he thought was about to turn into something ugly. His chant was "medicine, meant to diffuse anger and hostility." It was not hostile. The kid smirked
@warrenj0seph @KirstenPowers But none of that justifies the jeering, laughing, singing, dancing (taunting the Native American music and dance), as those boys DID surround the man. He is ONE MAN. No.
@KirstenPowers THANK YOU!!! I am appalled that so many people I've admired and cheered for over the past 2 years are now saying oops, sorry, nothing to see here, the white boys were acting Godly!

@CHUCK_BANE @lanehartwell @JamesMartinSJ To clarify...it was a basketball game.
@CHUCK_BANE @lanehartwell @JamesMartinSJ Dear, that only reinforces the notion that these boys are woefully uninformed about diversity, respect for the rights of all, including women.

@JamesMartinSJ That smirk speaks for itself. Those kids ARE NOT victims. They were being shouted at by what the kid's mother says were "Black Muslims" Instead of walking away, they decided to surround, jeer, laugh, mimic Native dance, and chant "build that wall," Ll while wearing MAGA hats.
@RepThomasMassie The smirk on that kid's face and the kids dancing and laughing in the background tell a very different story. We have eyes. All this is gaslighting. At BEST those kids just had no idea how it would look for them to surround a Native Am man, smirk, laugh and chant.

@maydaymindy9 I understand why this might be a worry. But I really think for some of them, eyes have been opened. Nicolle Wallace, Steve Schmidt and Jennifer Rubin have discussed this. Kristol, Will, Scarborough and Jordan probably will run back to the Reps.

@markondefense @CovCathColonels They are painting him as a "liberal activist" who set the boys up for a media event. It's already happening.
@Augustus709 They are busy muddying the narrative. The boys have an entire "WE are the victims here" narrative going.
@StormyDaniels They'll never learn. ü§£ü§£
@davemccarthy707 @KirstenPowers @hockeyhoose15 I didn't go to Catholic school, and I would have been too!
@AClementsWKRC @Local12 This is how the alternative, "actually, WE'RE the victims in the situation, do not believe your eyes or your ears" narrative gets written so the opposite side can defend itself from deserved accusations of racism, after they realize they're in deep shit.
@mlsline @AClementsWKRC @Local12 The man says he saw the situation getting hostile so he wanted to engage the boys. Have you watched his video???
@AndrewBeckNYC @anthonystauffer @AClementsWKRC No, his story has not changed. He said, if you listen to his video, that he wanted to engage the boys because he saw the situation getting hostile.
@_AdamHammond @rettes05 @AClementsWKRC @DavidAFrench @Local12 I saw them jumping around and laughing, mocking the dancing of the Native Americans. Their facial expressions, laughing, dancing, surrounding the guy and chanting "build that wall" tells a very different story IMO.
@MissJennifer116 @merlisa @shookster1000 @AClementsWKRC @almostjingo @Local12 What was that smug, entitled look on his face? The man was chanting about peace. He claims he was just "enjoying the experience." Is that what that smirk says to you? Really???

@joannabdenour @MichaelSteele They are being taught by Trump that it's ok to mock, not to respect, people you believe are your political enemies. Trump has made us all enemies of one another and kids are imitating what they see adult Trumpers doing in this current climate.
@MichaelSteele I stand with him and with you. The Trumpublican party does not.
@DavidJollyFL We went through this last night. Nothing has changed. He is still holding us hostage. We still cannot negotiate with someone who is acting in bad faith. This is still ON HIM. You want to make it into both sides, but no.
@KEnquirer @mjspickett @lulu_says2 @2020fight His chant was a call for peace and a rejection of anger. That is what he walked into that arrogant pissant crowd saying. If you think he is to blame, you are one fucked up indiv. They wanted to intimidate him and drive him away. They failed.

@femocratsrisin1 @Eviljohna @riotwomennn @tomselliott And because he has some very suspicious financial transactions. The rumor on the left is that he's compromised by Russia. There is evidence for it, it's not out of thin air. This tweet however is, and he needs to delete it.
@tomselliott He is obviously compromised by Russia. It's a widely held belief on the left. He's received funding from Russia, and there is no other explanation for his sudden extreme Trump ass kissing. Yes there's a rumor that he's gay, but that is not what she meant and you know it.
@variantwiter @redsteeze @SykesCharlie @tomselliott That's nothing new.
@LarrysTwin99 @cwel87 @redsteeze @SykesCharlie @tomselliott We ask that because Graham said if Trump won, he'd destroy the R party (which he's doing), and that he was a "kook," etc. Now he almost literally kisses Trump's ass. It's too extreme to ignore. He is betraying long held beliefs and his best friend McCain is rolling in his grave.

@Ipaddlecanoe @StephenKing Because a negative opinion about a book and seeking redress from our govt and it's President, as outlined in the Constitution, are totally the same thing. And there's the whole free speech thing. But to Trumpers, free speech is fine unless it's about Trump. Hypocrites.

@PumpkinPie00314 @StinkyLouise @mrblackplays @lizfones @CoriSeeds @emsprater1 @Mimirocah1 So you really believe that people who are "uncomfortable" voting for a black candidate aren't racist?
@mrblackplays @sherrysez @lizfones @CoriSeeds @emsprater1 @Mimirocah1 My autopsy says that a lot of the country is racist and sexist, including many Bernie supporters. Another fact is that Bernie voters fell for a lot of the Russian misinformation about HRC that the right did. I have never seen one Berner on Twitter or IRL who will admit that.

@MinnePuffin @alessi1414 @green_wyrd @last5sports @Carpboy823 @barabooSD I disagree. Racism in Baraboo, at least, is MUCH louder than anything I saw growing up in South Al, East and West TN and South MS in the 70's and 80's.

@barabooSD Statement is pathetic. That picture was not a one off or the first time this kind of thing has happened.Stories of students being called the N word, white power shouted in the halls after Trump's election, harassment of a trans student, and much more. Admin. response pathetic.
@dreamingbvi @pwalkerbooks @preston_bellini @jules_su @CarlySidey I sure never threw the Nazi salute, and neither did my friends or anyone else at my HS of 2500 students.

@Thorrin @crosssdx0 @Kevin49144892 @realDonaldTrump And if it wasn't for France, America wouldn't be a country. So there's that.
@realDonaldTrump You are a disgrace. I am so embarrassed for our country because you were too afraid of having a bad hair day to go and honor America's fallen. Shame, shame, shame on you.
@SteveSchmidtSES @RemusJLupin2017 This was in 2017, but it sure fits.
@ChazReddBear @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Trump flew all the way to France just to watch TV and to kiss Putin's balls. Disgraceful.
@ARAEveryDay @real_farmacist People are racist for voting for a black candidate?? These people, jesus.
@JessicaHmmmm @cameron_hai @NezPapa @DrPardi @NagyWrites @Twinsfanric @Texas_Dexter @DanRather They say "Show me evidence, I'll wait." Then you do, and they make fun of wherever you got the aricle and scream "fake news," and they don't read the article. It's a complete waste of time. One told me I was lying when I told her how many indictments Mueller had racked up.
@BretStephensNYT @NateSilver538 @soledadobrien This disappoints the hell out of me. Why??? Why did you do this???
@HoarseWisperer Neil Diamond. Will not apologize. Saw him in concert twice and it was beautiful.
@marcorubio Gun control, dammit, not Bible verses. Count ALL the votes. It is not hard to do the right thing. When you're already already millionaire, Wtf is the issue with the NRA?? Are they really your God?
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Thank you @ChrisCoons. No one believes this was your idea, and the fact that your buddy so often has to twist your arm to do the right thing, to remind you what your duty is, is simply pathetic.
@marcorubio A Republican bitching about the other party stealing an election is the height of irony. Just how does counting every vote equal theft? I suppose if they all turn out to be Republican votes, you'll delete this garbage tweet.

@Stoned_Creation @peterdaou @NRA @GOP Well said. Not just victims of gun violence. Victims of the human beings that lead the NRA. Those people, those soulless, evil people are directly responsible for the carnage.
@Goper91 @RobertLGarrett1 @Ceridwyn2 @jofjltn4 @LuvLaTiere @MartinWonta @nogmador1 @goofrider @MarcACaputo When they could issue every citizen a voter ID card, and no one would have to jump thru a million hoops and pay money they don't have, just to get the kind of ID they require you to have.
@Goper91 @RobertLGarrett1 @Ceridwyn2 @jofjltn4 @LuvLaTiere @MartinWonta @nogmador1 @goofrider @MarcACaputo But you can't use that as an ID in order to vote. Voter registration cards are literally worth less than the paper they're printed on. The letter that came with my card said "You do not need this card to vote." So they spend all kinds of $ to send us these useless cards.
@AnnMorr76264080 @RobertLGarrett1 @Ceridwyn2 @jofjltn4 @LuvLaTiere @MartinWonta @nogmador1 @goofrider @MarcACaputo We get voter registration cards in TN but they aren't voter ID cards, which is what that tweet was about. If every American were given a (free) voter ID card, all this BS could be avoided, but Republicans couldn't cheat as easily if that were the case.
@RobertLGarrett1 @Ceridwyn2 @jofjltn4 @LuvLaTiere @MartinWonta @nogmador1 @goofrider @MarcACaputo Because it would be so much more difficult to suppress the vote if we did something that rational and fair!
@MattxRed Is there a list?
@JRubinBlogger Don't nominate Bernie but he excused racism and then walked it back. He is an idiot and he needs an education. But bigotry is rampant in this country and we shouldn't call it out?

@PressSec Yeah, she should totally be fired for her inappropriate behavior, which is clearly documented in this video.
@AynRandPaulRyan @meandmrsjones2 @PressSec @Acosta His hands did not touch her. We can see the video. Your lies and gaslighting will not fool anyone with a brain. That excludes Trump voters, obviously.
@Acosta We support you! Hang in there. I hope all your colleagues walk out until you get your credential back.
@CLewandowski_ @benshapiro @SHSanders45 And learn to spell.
@CLewandowski_ @benshapiro @SHSanders45 It is literally on tape, you moron. We all saw what happened and your side's lying and gaslighting won't fool anyone with a brain.

@ColtonWinters_ @_Cruzin You really don't get why this upsets people? MAGAts support a wall, erasing GLBTQ+ Americans, stop and frisk, believe that black lives don't matter, mock and discount sexual assault survivors, believe women have no control over our bodies, etc. And you don't get it? Take a seat.

@MichaelAvenatti How about congratulating all the Dems who won tonight and celebrating the takeover of the House instead of once again, making it all about you?

@realDonaldTrump @AmyKremer @VoteMarsha Marsha Blackburn is Tennessee's Voldemort. What an embarrassment.
@KatyTurNBC @MeetThePress K, you had it wrong. MSNBC is not our safe space because we always agree with what we hear. It's because you don't give liars a platform to lie like CNN does. Like Amy Kremer. She is ignorant and she lies constantly. Lies don't deserve equal time. Give your viewers some credit.
@ChelseaClinton Chelsea, you and you mom have more class in your little fingers than Kellyanne Alternative Facts will ever have. She is ridiculous and like Trump, doesn't know what to do now that she's not running against HRC. Everyone with a heart knows what she said is ridiculous.
@Dobby201765 @maggieNYT @JohnOSullivan36 It's her bread and butter. I cancelled my subscription bdcause NYT does this all the time. I'm with WaPo.
@rihanna Oh noooo, I love that song! It's on my favorites playlist. I'm glad you're fighting this, cause I don't want to think of Trump when I hear it. I think of him too much already.ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
@DaddyDaddymac Who is that?? She's not the Dodge City bitch is she?
@rolandscahill Trump will take credit for the extra hour. The big, beautiful extra hour.
@AuthorKimberley @jack @Twitter Thank you! Do you know that men on Fb can call women the C word and it doesn't violate standards? I don't know if that's the case for Twitter, but I wouldn't be surprised. "Fuck Trump" can get someone a suspension but a woman can have a threat to her life and gets brushed off.
@beckron99 @ateacher97 @davidhogg111 *care too
@beckron99 @ateacher97 @davidhogg111 I'm glad they carentoo, and I am really glad they are voting in higher numbers. But his judgmental attitude needs to stop if he wants to bring people together. I don't know who you voted for in '16, but to me, David is a classic "Bernie Bro." White, entitled and judgmental.
@MMChol1 @davidhogg111 @ThinkOneWorld Hello from a fellow sufferer. üòä
@kylenorman @davidhogg111 Thank you, I totally agree. His Twitter persona is arrogant and entitled. He thinks that his appearance on Rachel Maddow gives him permission to judge entire swaths of US society. Notice these Tweets never come down after backlash, which tells me he doesn't care who he offends.
@busybeachmama4 @davidhogg111 I have found that many times kids make these comments, implying that they know and can do better, then they're embarrassed later. And they should be. David has had some fame and he's got quite a nice chip on his shoulder already.
@sahluwal Customers held French by his overalls. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Classic.
@maggieNYT From Maggie, typical. I gave you the benefit of the doubt for a long time. Not anymore, and this awful headline is one reason why. Posting Trump quotes as truth without calling them lies is why I cancelled my NYT digital subscription.
@myang92221 @Pwaters1227 @benshapiro Also, that's literally how canvassing works. They knew who she was and that she is a Dem before they even knocked. They are targeting likely voters. Seriously, do you know how any of this works?
@myang92221 @Pwaters1227 @benshapiro She asked her if she was planning to vote. How is that coercive? I am sure if the woman was a R she would have said I plan to vote and I'm voting for the R. That woman is an adult and is capable of making that decision. You're just pissed because most of the country hates Repubs.
@benshapiro She looks so annoyed.
@ZellnerLaw @lifeafterten @EFMoriarty @michellemalkin Why does he continue to represent himself as an attorney or an expert on anything, and why does the media treat him as such?
@curethelonely @nickloeser @NormEisen Like a drive by? Are you serious?? Like a drive by shooting, with a bullet? Wow, you need help.
@NormEisen @MatthewWolfff The comments are abusive, offensive, misogynistic, selfish, lacking compassion, understanding, recognition of her humanity, respect for her experience and her fears. I hate every person in the US who voted for Trump and I am ashamed at how many of them hate their fellowmcitizens.
@brsvlgr @CNN What an awful thing to say! Do better. Be better. Jesus.
@joanwalsh Why does she look so hateful??? Why do Republicans hate Americans?????
@SteveKingIA You are truly a disgrace and are an embarrassment to this great nation. Shame on you. All decent Americans hate Nazis and you are a Nazi. #PunchaNazi
@politvidchannel @ShereeW1974 What mystery? Racism, homophobia, fear of and hatred for immigrants mixed with Christianity.
@DaddyDaddymac What did he say before she said Oh my God?
@DevinNunes Back from who? The Republicans already control the house, FYI.
@JRubinBlogger It took them this long...Hello Amy Women for Trump whatever her last name is.
@realDonaldTrFan Crap I thought this was really him and I wanted to correct his spelling. ü§£ü§£ü§£
@realDonaldTrump Except that Democrats deported him. He was sentenced to death and is a horrible human being. This ad is the most heinous racist one yet. Congrats, deplorables.
@UROCKlive1 No, since Congress is not holding him accountable, the press has to. If they don't publicize what he says and does, think about what he could do. Way too scary.
@Acosta He's not angry. Well ok.
@AP Why would it? He was exactly right. Almost 75% of terrorist attacks in this country are white men on the far right. The numbers don't lie, but Trump is doing nothing but stoking fear of brown people. It's working, because there's a dearth of facts and critical thinking on the rt.
@ninjahulahoop @tleighb7 @jackiebillek @j_ogodfather @TomiLahren What celebrity has told you you MUST vote for anyone? And what celebrity called you a bad person? Advocating for a candidate is not ordering anyone to do anything. It is also not an automatic judgment. Projection much? Defensive maybe?
@MalcolmNance Watch, Trump will now publicly request the cartels to help keep the brown people out. And maybe he'll ask them to find Hillary's emails too.
@esmatti @terrimatt @BetteMidler Go by, not go buy. Also, it's nowhere, not no where. You've seen the rest of the corrections. I want to know how adults are this ignorant of the English language, and you all have fits when immigrants speak Spanish instead of English. You can't even write a coherent comment.

@notearsbeck @Zigmanfreud @SteveSchmidtSES Steve Schmidt has more brains and integrity than any of you have in your little fingers. Not selling  out to Trump is a very brave thing to do, whether one stays a Republican or doesn't. He and Nicolle W have earned their stripes where many could not, having licked Trump's ass.
@brianjsymes @Zigmanfreud It was that bad, so I guess I understand
@brianjsymes @Zigmanfreud You felt you had to explain that one huh? ü§£ü§£ü§£
@Zigmanfreud Wow, you're a Palin fan and you're attacking a man who lives the courage of his convictions instead of clinging to a party of old, racist white men who have sold THEIR souls to an orange one. The mental gymnastics involved in both those things is astounding.
@Hank_Rearden_11 @gretchenbulson And it's a racist and sexist party that only elects white men to positions of power. How that's not blatantly obvious to some people is beyond me.
@GualtJohn It's too bad you can't express your old world racist, sexist self with proper spelling and punctuation. It's also too bad that you can't use your real name on Twitter, preferring to use the name of a fictional character written by a silly woman with a ridiculous philosophy.
@RealSaavedra Everything she says here is correct. All of the right wing attempts to take the narrative away from Trump and his rhetoric, and the rhetoric of Fox "news" is not working for anyone except your tiny base of troglodytes.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Wow, the racism in this one. Congrats!

@JRubinBlogger Jennifer, I commented on one of your comments but want to say it here. Since so many Trumpers troll your articles, could you explain in one of them how it's possible to be Pro Israel and Anti Semitic at the same time? Please? They don't get it.
@nmlinguaphile @juliaioffe Did you watch the news last week at all? A crazy right wing white nationalist sent one of 11 bombs to CNN. The anger Trump has stoked and encouraged among his voters have made journalists less safe. You can joke about it or ignore it if you want to. Doesn't make it less true
@JoyAnnReid @bdk1521 He is the most disingenuous, unintellectual, bigoted little elf I've ever seen. "Thank you for your remarks and attack." Saying what I wish would happen to him might put me in Twitter jail.
@TwitterComms Allow us to edit Tweets!!
@JRubinBlogger @KateBennett_DC @JenniferJJacobs @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @CNN Jennifer, please explain, in one of your articles or in a TV appearance, how someone can be pro Israel and anti Semitic at the same time. So many idiot don't understand it, and I could use the knowledge to be able to talk about it.
@Lewis3651 @JRubinBlogger @KateBennett_DC @JenniferJJacobs @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @CNN https://t.co/Bt8AocbF61
@canadub @JRubinBlogger @KateBennett_DC @JenniferJJacobs @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @CNN Many people, most of them Evangelical Christians, are pro Israel. They see it as essential to the return of Jesus. Nobody is more anti Semitic than American  Evangelicals. So your comment is uneducated.
@AmyKremer No one believes a word that comes out of your uneducated, bigoted mouth. @CNN has lost all respect for its viewers by keeping you around, huddled in your kennel.
@IvankaTrump @AmyKremer Oh you have GOT to be kidding. No one believes a word that comes out of your uneducated, hateful mouth. Delete your account.
@Jesus_was_a_Lib @AliVelshi @MSNBC @AmyKremer Oh God not her. That would require them to fumigate the studio after she left. Seriously, MSNBC hosts have more respect for their shows and their audience (unlike @CNN ) for that.
@AliVelshi Listen more closely and deliberately to a bunch of bigots and traitors? Nah. I am done with that.
@DogginTrump She cried during the press conference??
@eclecticbrotha @TaritaC @Newsweek Yes because Trump has not changed in 2 years. Only the specifics change. No one expects him to actually grow some compassion or the ability to think critically and understand the pain people are in. It's still news, though, every day, when he drops various turds on the Am people.
@AynRandPaulRyan Is that even a thing or is he just wearing that shawl for warmth?
@runaluck @my_shenanigons @DogginTrump @BarReNaples What?
@DogginTrump Wow. Goddamn, it's so satisfying to know that she got fired and, I read, EVICTED. I would love to know what miss Thing has to say now.

@TheRickWilson An AMAZING segment. For all the issues I have had with Joe S, what you both said was the most honest I have heard any Republican be since..well, ever. BUT, the guys who commit violence may be a tiny segment, but the racist, sexist xenophobic wing of the party is NOT tiny.

@BryanWHamilton @Jose_Canyusi @getongab @stripe @PayPal @joyent @realDonaldTrump I agree. I would be the object of that guy's hate if I were to walk into his bakery. I hope he fails.

@Jose_Canyusi @BryanWHamilton @getongab @stripe @PayPal @joyent @realDonaldTrump Nope, because, like I said, the court ruled that the bigoted, hateful bakers have the right to discriminate against people they hate, due to their bigoted, hateful religious beliefs.

@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry It us to Trump. And I would argue that there are many more white supremacists who don't show up at marches. That seems like common sense no matter who you're talking about. Night.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Sorry, I have not been to bed and it's 5:20 AM. That's not out of the ordinary for me, but I'm tired because I feel like I'm beating my head against a wall. Nothing I say will change your mind and nothing u say will change mine. I don't see the point.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Omg i give up. Go suck some Trump dick and have a nice day.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry And yeah, I am angry because people are getting massacred and bombs are being sent to wipe out the upper tier of the Dem party. I'm angry anout healthcare and LGBTQ rights and police brutality and the scourge of sexual assault. Hell yes I'm angry and I'm not alone.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry He wants the white supremacist votes because he needs all he can get, and he will say anything to keep them. That's just cold hard reality.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Are you telling me that Trump's dogwhistles are jokes and no one should be offended? And he didn't really mean that both sides thing right? He said the speech they made him give condemning the Nazis was the worst thing he's done since he was elected. Look it up.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry But technically the polls were correct. Is it any consolation? Hell no. But to dismiss current polls showing the absolute Hatred most Americans have for Trump and R's is just burying your head in the sand. Political Scientists are still very smart.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Those polls were actually correct. He only won by a few thousand votes in 3 states. His assertion that he had a massive electoral college win is a lie. Obama won with WAY more electoral votes than Trump did, and HRC won the pop vote. So Trump won, yes.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Sure, don't believe the polls. Red Wave! Yeah, polls are all a lie unless they benefit Trump, right? üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yeah, we'll see.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry The President of the United Fucking States of America and we're not supposed to take his words literally. Unreal. With those mental gymnastics, you're gonna pull a muscle. Be careful, dude.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry You dumbass, I was asking if that's what you are really saying to me. You criticized me for taking everything T says literally and my question is, am I supposed to take it all as a joke?? How am I supposed to know what's real and what's a joke? Please, enlighten me.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Y'all know that you're about to lose the House and that over 60% of the country disapproves of Trump. His % with women is barely 30%. With blacks it's 3%. The R party is circling the drain and will be obsolete for at least a generation because of T. And we're desperate. Lol
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry I do not know and have never eben seen an Antifa member and I have been a Dem all my adult life. I am 48. These are the R boogeymen, I get it, but to tie them to the D party is dishonest at best. But I expect nothing less from you people.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Oh so we should take everything the President of the US says as a joke? Is that what you're saying?? He said it but he didn't really mean it?? For real??? Damn, that is some bullshit. Antifa is NOT, in any way, affiliated with the D party. They despise Nancy P as much as Reps do.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry You can also hate Israel's treatment of the Palestinians and not be anti Semitic. Again, nuance is not a Trump supporter's strong suit.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry He can have Jewish friends, Jewish family and even kiss Netanyahu's ass and STILL speak with dog whistles that literally cater to Anti Semites/white supremacists. It's like saying I can't be racist, I have black friends. If you don't get this you are too far gone for me to help.

@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Yes, based on the fact that you support, defend, make excuses for and wear a tin foil hat for the Nazi sympathizer in the WH. You attach yourself to him, you are labeled by literally tens of millions of Americans as all those things you listed.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry https://t.co/fVV2Da7T1Z
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry No one is redefining anything. Did you go to school? Did you learn history? Did you study language? It seems not, because you call people who acrually read and are educated stupid, because you don't know what they know. You are very good at outing yourself as an ignorant rube.
@LeeB8585 @alipner87 @RichLowry He can have Jewish supporters and even Jewish family members but since he knows many of his supporters are white supremacists, he speaks to them in coded language. It is totally self centered and 100% anti Semitic.
@LeeB8585 @alipner87 @RichLowry All of his white supremacist anti Semitic supporters are his supporters because they have recognized his coded language. If you don't believe, simply ask them. Go to the Daily Stormer. They revel in Trump's words, which are coded nods he uses cos he wants the votes.
@atlharp @alipner87 @RichLowry Here, it really isn't hard. https://t.co/ZzmIUz4HCu

@Athnamas229 @DocWashburn @alipner87 @RichLowry So is "Globalist." And "Nationalist." Documented dog whistles to anti Semetic white supremacists who are almost literally sucking his dick.
@tanker_m1 @Averre13 @mombam @RichLowry Then you share his hatred for people of color, women, LGBT's and Jewish Americans. You approve of his enabling lonely, angry, deranged white supremacists to act against POC and Jews. You approve of his theory that George Soros pays migrants and protesters. Congrats, deplorable.
@mombam @RichLowry Our hatred and contempt for Trump supporters knows no bounds. But it's not our hatred that sent 12 bombs to Trump critics. It's not our hatred that massacred worshippers in a synagogue. That's all Trump. They are responses to his violent, racist, anti Semetic rhetoric. Own it.

@StreetMedia804 @davidhogg111 Why should he fix Flint water crisis? As if he even can? But that's not his focus. Do you normally come onto threads and derail the topic and insert useless info that has no relevance to said thread? We all care about Flint but this is the wrong place.
@KyleKashuv @CandyAllenSmit2 @davidhogg111 Hogg's fans, mostly Democrats, know that most Trump Republicans don't read cause they think it's beta. Or they're just too lazy to do something that would actually teach them facts. R's are the party of fake news at the hands of a fake pres. Dems read and deal in facts. FU.
@davidhogg111 I sure am anti gun.
@Janet4OH With all due respect, Republicans are so corrupt that I think they deserve a few fights at the hands of the responsible party.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger And yes, I BELIEVE Ford. Retweet me all you want, you aren't going to scare me. I guess that's what you do to women, like your boy Kavanaugh.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger She did NOT withhold the polygraph. She wanted the Republicans to call as a witness the polygraph examiner. Of course they were scared to do so, and they didn't. She also wanted to give the polygraph to the FBI, and they did not interview her. Lies don't help your case.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger Multiple credible accusations of sexual assault, him lying under oath multible times , him coming out and attacking Democrats, threatening to "get them back," (what goes around comes around), yelling, insulting female Senators...flawed is actually a compliment.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger But even if I weren't sure, he is a very flawed nominee and the fact that he was seated is a stain on the Senate and unfortunately on the court too. I question it's integrity now and that has never happened. And I'm not the only one by far.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger Kav wouldn't disagree with you? Lol well aren't you conceited. Read the decision. I am not lying.The Kavanaugh thing was NOT a court case. It was a job interview, and even a question over whether a nominee is a sexual predator should be sufficient to reject him. I believe Ford
@IvankaTrump LOL nice save! No one with a brain thinks you didn't really believe that was a Socrates quote. Cause there are screen shots.
@LessGovMoreFun @JRubinBlogger Wow, a trifecta of misogyny. Well done.
@joethepatriotic @JRubinBlogger According to a recent opinion by Kavanaugh, polygraphs are a valuable resource in assessing truthfulness or deception by the participant. So the guy you're trying to defend disagrees with you.
@AndyGoogman @JRubinBlogger Har har. How long did it take for you to work that out? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@m_stewart_paine @JRubinBlogger Oh but no. She is more popular now and is trusted by more people than ever. She is not a blind, brainless follower, says what she means, lives her beliefs and doesn't lie in her tweets or columns just to please the corrupt, defunct Republican party. She is a treasure.

@VickiAt21339339 @whatthadeuce @ABC Clearly, you are the ass.
@VickiAt21339339 @whatthadeuce @ABC ironically, when it comes to first names, O‚ÄôRourke and Cruz have something in common: Cruz goes by ‚ÄúTed,‚Äù but he was born Rafael Edward Cruz.
@VickiAt21339339 @whatthadeuce @ABC https://t.co/0TLp4L1svU		Facts matter.
@VickiAt21339339 @whatthadeuce @ABC *preys.		The origin of O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs Hispanic-sounding first name has been captured in almost every profile of the rising Democrat: ‚ÄúBeto‚Äù is a childhood nickname that stuck.
@APLMom @ABC The narrative didn't move from assault to temperament. The narrative moved to assault AND temperament. He did not show himself for the angry partisan hack that he was in his confirmation hearings. He waited til his response to Ford. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.
@BillLiggan @missvic659 @PeterArcher37 @MichaelAvenatti @secupp You felt divided cause Obama was black. That is the reason y'all hated him so much. So transparent. Racist cunts.
@unsent927 @ABC Why are you people so obsessed with the guy's name??? Who cares what his name is???? Is Cruz authentic for denying his Hispanic heritage and changing his name from Rafael to Ted??? Is that MORE authentic?? Repubs are pathetic hypocrites
@StevenRosenblum @ABC Would you condemn Cruz if he had raised tens of millions of dollars partly from out of state? No, of course you wouldn't because he's a Republican. Hypocrite.
@APLMom @ABC The media and all rational people were obsessed with the question of whether Kavanaugh assaulted women while blackout drunk. They were concerned not that he played drinking games but that he lied about it. Concerned not that he drank but that again, he lied and possibly raped.
@whatthadeuce @VickiAt21339339 @ABC Republicans' obsession with Beto's name is just pathetic. They think they're so clever but they're just making complete asses of themselves.
@Learn2FlySA @ABC Does the fact that Beto speaks Spanish mean he's "pandering" as well? Asshole.
@brad71692164 @WomanOfSubstanc @Gunservatively @ABC He might not have driven drunk. Who knows? Instead he tried to rape women. That's so much better.
@22Garebear @whatthadeuce @cmortolani @ABC @BetoORourke The fact that you people are going after Beto's name just shows you have nothing else. It just kills you that so many Texans, including Republicans, love Beto. You are literally making fools of yourselves. But that's nothing new for Republicans.
@cmortolani @ABC @BetoORourke He speaks Spanish too. Does that make him fake as well? The ignorance among Republicans never fails to amaze me.
@pinktastic615 @DianeWojnar @ABC How is he trying to mislead anyone? Beto is a common nickname for Robert in TX, as I understand it. Republicans will do and say anything, including lying, to make others look bad. Funny thing is, what you consider "bad" is just normal. You are a Racist fuck.
@Artifex74 @mjbooth7 @ABC Wow. Because she would vote for Beto you wouldn't welcome her? We have freedom in this country, and I thought TX was all about freedom. Turns out you only advocate freedom for those who vote Republican. You people are such assholes.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You moron. He's not "pretending" to be Hispanic. He is relating to the Hispanic community. He speaks Spanish. How is that a bad thing? Oh yeah, you're a white supremacist and you're hostile to education. Gotta love the poorly educated right?

He needs to tone it down, and if he's to stay in politics, he needs to unite, not divide, like Trump.
@MichaelAvenatti @Lis_Smith @realDonaldTrump How do you have time to go after every person who tweets about you with anything remotely resembling negativity? Don't you have more important things to do? I say this after days of watching you attack anyone who critiques your tactics.
@PattiSolisDoyle @MichaelAvenatti That was definitely not a hit piece on Avenatti. He just Twitter attacks anyone who disagrees with him or critiques his tactics. Thin skinned is an understatement.

@DLoesch Boo hoo.
@Goldy559 @MichaelAvenatti @KassandraSeven Avenatti is no Hillary Clinton. I don't see anyone who's afraid of Avenatti except maybe Michael Cohen. The ads have already written themselves. The creepy porn lawyer lecturing people on Twitter. It's already cringe worthy.

@katekoza @MichaelAvenatti @KassandraSeven Awesome point. Thank you. I was trying to put my finger on what bugs me about him and this is one example.
@MichaelAvenatti @KassandraSeven Yes but who are u? Kamala is a Senator. Warren is a Senator. U've done nothing to convince me that you running for office is even a slightly good idea. U talk a lot and boast and brag and nothing happens. U tried to convince the nation that u'd bring Kavanaugh down and nothing.
@davidhogg111 I am hearing that only 20% of younger voters are absolutely sure they're going to vote. WTF is wrong with you people? After 2 years of Trump and most of y'all still won't turn out. That is so disappointing.
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris Way to go, ignore facts and evidence. Typical Trumptard.
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris Well I lived history too. What does that have to do with anything?  Did you even read the article??
@claremackint0sh This is the best news I have received almost ever!! I read all 3 of your books in one week a few months ago and I have been wondering when a new book would come out!!! I am so happy!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Congratulations!
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris And you have not proved that she lied. In fact you have proved nothing. However, here is proof that he continued to harrass and yes, grope women after he became a justice. 		https://t.co/Q4Mt5AJsQO
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris No, I do not hate men. I hate men who harrass, assault and rape women. You don't?
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris Prove to me these women lied. Prove that you don't simply hate them because they accused conservative judges nominated by Republican presidents. I bet you believe women who accuse Democrats but call the ones who accuse Republicans liars. I believe all women, not just some.
@ProudRc @TweetingTheTru2 @KamalaHarris Google is your friend. She did not lie. She is a hero who should mean something to you but I see you'd rather call her a liar with zero evidence. Evidence that all sexists are not men.
@trtx84 @HoarseWisperer Us meaning those of us who supported Blasey Ford and opposed Kavanaugh's nomination.
@cafeenfre @KamalaHarris @maddow I did not see the show yet. Did they vote yes JUST to get out of school early? If that's true, I am equally disturbed.
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris You righty woman haters are a disgrace to your own gender.
@ProudRc @TweetingTheTru2 @KamalaHarris You people are fantastic at missing the point. I don't care if he has been a fantastic justice. He harassed Anita Hill and rumour is he has continued to sexually harass women as a justice. You did not address point I made about proof of Hill's allegations.
@ProudRc @TweetingTheTru2 @KamalaHarris Why does her net worth matter??
@scalzi @Stonekettle "None of the above" as an option why exactly?
@AndreLeFrance @RavenVillage @JoeNBC @taylorswift13 Well first, Bredesen may not be "woke," but Marsha Blackburn is truly evil and Bredesen was a popular Dem mayor of Nashville and gov. of TN. I am not sure what Joe's point is there.
@JoeNBC @taylorswift13 Bredesen may not be "woke," but Marsha Blackburn is evil. What's your point?
@CathyBilsky @KamalaHarris Is that REALLY the reason? So they could get off work earlier? Somehow I doubt that.
@TimWhite001 @KamalaHarris Back to Montreal? What the f are you talking about?
@ProudRc @KamalaHarris Justice Thomas has not said one word in public for 25 years because he KNOWS he is guilty. Actually, if you care, evidence has come out proving that Anita Hill was telling the truth. But I guess that's "fake news," eh? Facts are always fake news with you people.
@cafeenfre @KamalaHarris I seriously doubt that's the truth.
@illwill908 @KamalaHarris I certainly don't want to focus ONLY on women survivors but the idiots I have talked to deny their sexism and at the same time admit they will believe a man but assume a woman is lying. I simply don't understand that. But male survivors, we believe you and you deserve attention.
@KamalaHarris How can we beat back this uneducated conservative narrative that women are liars and we can't afford to "believe survivors" because of this? That's their argument EVERY TIME, and attention is taken off of victims and of the need to believe women, and argument always ensues.

@trtx84 @HoarseWisperer I appreciate his ability to go on TV and not mince words when he goes after Trump. But I would not be surprised if he's not a great attorney. He's a big talker but that whole Kavanaugh thing...he had us believing he'd bring the guy down, yet here we are.

@VeridicalAngel @JustTrueBlue @McAllisterDen It's a political issue when the orange menace nominates a sexual predator to the highest court in the land and when the Republican Party decides women's voices aren't to be believed. It certainly is.
@JRubinBlogger They don't care. That's been obvious to me for over 2 yrs. Republicans have attacked, doubted and disbelieved K's accusers for weeks. Many decided they were voting yes on K before Blasey testified. They have no integrity at all. Why do we even question?? No they don't care!
@Acosta Yes, fantastic. Wish I'd seen it. Thank you for all your hard work, and I apologize for all the idiots in North MS and West TN who undoubtedly heckled you. There are many people down here who love you.

@McAllisterDen So you, a woman, slut shaming Dr. Ford.  She does and did live in a free country at that time did she not? Has she claimed, as Kavanaugh has, that she never drank to excess? He is the liar,  not her. Nice try though.
@MichaelAvenatti Please take your client public. 60 Minutes even.
@deathdragon007 @OGYokYok @fundandtechy @JillFilipovic Oh they don't? Did you vote for Trump? Do you support the Republican majority who refuses to provide oversight on child separation at the very least? Reps vote against equal pay for god's sake. Reps want to put a rageful, partisan hack on SCOTUS. Nice.
@LnghrnFaninPhx @MysticKnitter @daily_opiner @SenBlumenthal I'm legitimately confused here and have been for a while. Are they a bot if they give you specific answers to specific questions and respond as if in a conversation? He may be a troll, but bot is something different
@daily_opiner @SenBlumenthal People like you, who automatically dismiss her as a conniving liar when her testimony was so credible and compelling make all of us sick. If it was your daughter, sister, wife, would you ask her what she did to deserve it? I really hope not.
@MikeJPassmore @fcretired @GOP No. Their wives are saying proven sexual assault doesn't disqualify Kavanaugh. They vote to oppress their daughters. They are victim blamers.
@Cty2CtyLyle @VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen And Marsha would vote however McConnell tells her to vote. What's your point? That you're a Trumptard?
@ToddnTerri1117 @VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry no. The #bluewave is coming. Phil has my vote.
@Jenifvr @DianeWordsmith @PattyHarbison @VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen Marsha for women.ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ She would kiss Trump's ass and vote for Kavanaugh if he raped someone in her living room. She has no conscience. I'll cancel out your vote. #bluewaveTN
@Crochetty2015 @VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen She would vote for him if he raped somebody in front of her.
@VoteMarsha @PhilBredesen Fuck you Marsha. I am a Memphian and we will not vote for a Trump ass kisser. You enable his crimes, which is disgusting. You don't deserve to be in the Senate.
@OldGeewillakers LOL i actually saw it on Instagram. It was about 25-30 secs long, and the guy looks just like your pic. If I find it again I'll post it.

@jburg1985 @joshtpm @brianbeutler OMG Trump sniffs constantly when he's speaking in public. I thought it might be a nervous habit (and joked about cocaine), but as he lies constantly, it makes sense.
@OldGeewillakers Stand behind him with a sign. "I believe survivors." Something that would really piss people off. Although, you could get hurt. Be careful. With you in Memphis.

@GOPChairwoman You mean Lindsay Graham's smears? Orrin Hatch's smears? Grassley's smears? If so, I agree. We will remember every one of you who perpetrayed this assault on the women of this country. We will remember in November and we'll remember in 2020. Count on it.
@chrislhayes Does he have no memory of assaulting the other 2 accusers?

@chrislhayes @rtraister Ugh. Makes me sick.
@chrislhayes @rtraister If she had displayed anger, which she has every right to, she would have been eaten alive. This kakes ke sick Brett Kavanaugh is literally scaring women all across this country right now. He is revictimizing women who have been assaulted. Shameful.
@kylegriffin1 They would have ad libbed and pontificated. They would have doubted her, attacked her and called her a liar. They are cowards because they knew what it would have looked like had they questioned her.
@foxandfriends @LindseyGrahamSC You're complaining that there's no corroboration?? You are insane. There would have been evidence and corroboration or not if you had allowed an FBI investigation and subpoenaed Mark Judge and others. You don't WANT to believe her. You know she's credible but you're bought.
@JakeSherman Hmm, I wonder how they might have obtained corroboration. I just can't think of any solution.

@ananavarro @BetoORourke He deserves it. The way Republicans are treating assault victims is disgusting and shameful. I'd heckle him in public any day. No it doesn't change any votes, but that's not the point.  I doubt those hecklers were trying to change any votes. The focus is his smarmy ass.

@LauraLitvan @maggieNYT Had the second, third and fouth allegations been made public when she did this interview?
@soledadobrien @soledadobrien what are you disagreeing with here?
@MxedChiq @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Yes, you have the absolute right to have opinions. The fact is though, you left women out of the tweet and are more worried about men being falsely accused than you are about the victims. That says a lot and is why I am even taking the time to do this.
@MxedChiq @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC And your tweet said not one word about the women, the victims. Only the boys you were scared would get falsely accused, implying that the allegations aren't true.
@MxedChiq @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC I have not run across one Republican in the last week who didn't doubt the (now 4) women, call them liars, make excuses, tell me boys will be boys, bring up Bill Clinton and tell me there is zero evidence, when facts tell us the opposite. So yes, I assumed you were the same.
@B52Malmet It worked. I turned off the news when they wouldn't shut up about Rosenstein.
@TravisAllen02 @ShereeW1974 Are you like, really smart?
@essenviews @Pajjr2016 What you're supposed to do is believe women when they come forward, treat them with respect and you certainly shouldn't promise to vote for the guy before even hearing any testimony. That is a slap in the face to all women and it's why there's going to be a blue wave in Nov.
@samstein He really is counting on there being ZERO compelling testimony from Blasey Ford on Thursday, and on a believe that Avenatti doesn't have good info. That's a really stupid way to deal with this. However, the stupider he is the better the chances of his nomination failing.

@MxedChiq @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC But you get the point, right. People are doubting her and calling her a liar. What if she was their daughter or sister or wife?

@silviazeller1 @ibrokemyserious @tiascary @Gram_Kat @ananavarro That is simply not true. They could interview dozens of people who could describe his behavior and that atmosphere of drunken misogyny.
@ananavarro If Grassley is so appalled, he needs to stop his party from attacking Dr. Blasey Ford, causing nutjobs to threaten her and her family too. It If both sides are doing it, both parties need to publicly condemn those actions.
@kcalpeguy @JoeNBC Of nasty behavior. But no one is asking them!!! There must be an investigation!
@kcalpeguy @JoeNBC How do you know there's no evidence? There has been no investigation. People tell officers of the law a lot more than they tell journalists! I mean, would you want to go to the media given what happens to people who do??? There are classmates saying he participated in a lot
@MxedChiq @MSNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC God forbid your daughter gets assaulted and the entire town is saying I believe him.
@GKdesertrain @AndreaTobias8 @MSNBC @JoeNBC FBI did NOT say no. In fact, some agents basically said yes, there are definitely things we could do.

@4ffe71daa20b471 @Lawrence @CNN @chucktodd has to go. For some reason, he acts like he respects these people, so yeah, he's an anomaly for sure.
@mschlapp Republican men are so rapey, then you tear down the woman. Your party is full of corrupt, criminal, lying, raping men. DO BETTER.
@mschlapp Because Republicans, instead of supporting accusers, roll out PR campaigns to destroy them and defend the slimy men who have harrassed, assaulted and raped them. You're telling me you couldn't figure this out??
@BetteMidler And Ted Kavanaugh. 2 more allegations.
@ananavarro Why isn't @CNN reporting this yet??? I'm sitting here waiting and they've not said a word.
@jacobsfam @peterbakernyt What makes me sick is that Republicans will not allow this kind of logic to be heard. I may be wrong, but I don't think Senators will get to speak! Do you know if that's true?
@GrammarPolicem1 @Calladhiel @Trumpalina2 @cher Your profile clearly states that you have a bias that benefits conservatives. This I catch one perpetrator at a time business is nonsense.
@btwicymi @Lawrence @GulliAz A lie is not an opinion or a fact. It's not "both sides" when one side is constantly lying and distorting reality. There are conservatives who are reputable and believable. @MSNBC has THOSE people on. @CNN literally pays liars. That is not fair and balanced.
@floetfre @Lawrence @SupermanHotMale A lie is not an opinion. That's what these Trump defenders do. They lie, rewrite history and distort current reality. They don't deserve the status @CNN is affording them.

@DrPaulGosar Damn, how many tweets are you going to post about this? They really got to you, did they?ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ
@TheChrisMoreno @yashar @DrPaulGosar They need their mother's permission to have and express political views? They are all professional adults, moron. They don't need her permission for anything.
@yashar @DrPaulGosar Oh no, I feel so bad for your siblings! They've got a nutbar fascist mother AND you. They are fine, compassionate, upstanding citizens who called your racist ass out. They have restored some of my faith in humanity.
@ananavarro That thread is awesome.üòÇüòÇ Not one person supports him. The Cruz Beto thread and this one win the internet today.
@DrPaulGosar Irony is officially dead.
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC You you are another asshole who has decided she's lying before you hear her. Very responsible.
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC So what?
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC Also, reporting a crime is LITERALLY an accusation. Ypu're full of shit.
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC They investigated Anita Hill's accusations.
@shurt1962 @davidkelley718 @upuouo @tedcruz Yeah you did it again. You proved Cruz is a liar. Again, thanks! You're making this easy. #BetoforSenate
@shurt1962 @sallyray5 @tedcruz Yeah you just proved lyin' Ted lied. Thanks for that.
@tedcruz You are a liar. That is NOT what he said. Watching the video YOU POSTED proves that. Your smarmy lying, Trump ass kissing self won't have a job come November. People see through you now. Good riddance.
@soledadobrien I am ashamed and disgusted with CNN. I'm sick ofmtheir "report both sides" bullshit. MSNBC does not let liars on their air. I'm done.
@21stTexasCav @PuckLives403 @AnnCoulter "You're dumb" is harrassment??? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly I have not expressed rage, and you are almost as good at gaslighting as Trump is.
@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly And why do you keep responding to me if you hate me so much? Talk about on display for all.

@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC Facts are facts. You arguing it doesn't make it any less a fact. It just makes you special.
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC That is completely irrelevant. It is not true that the FBI only investigates federal crimes. Plus, again, this would be an addition to his background check, not a criminal investigation anyway. So your point is moot.
@frossiemae @EdWhelanEPPC Will you please question Kavanaugh?
@Barbara09190674 @info_marketer @EdWhelanEPPC The truth, according to experts, is that it is perfectly normal for a woman to remember the trauma because it's attached to so much emotion but to forget less important facts such as time and place. Read a book.
@info_marketer @EdWhelanEPPC Did you also sexually assault girls at that age? Boys will be boys, right?
@ToxicExplodley @jamul31 @radiant_wave @elueroy @EdWhelanEPPC That is simply not true. This should be added to his background check. That's exactly what happened with Anita Hill. The ignorance. It burns.
@EdWhelanEPPC Here, let me give you this tin foil hat.

@AC360 @randikayeCNN @AC360 shame on you for assembling a group of women to trash Dr. Blasey Ford. Where were the women who support her? There are millions of us!! Thank god for MSNBC.
@PaTresha10 @LaurenBaratzL They are voting Dem in November. That's all I know. But Nicolle has a fantastic show on MSNBC. She and the show are intelligent, she has great guests, does the deepest analysis of anyone except Maddow. You're missing out.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand Why she couldn't testify on Monday. Her life has been turned upside down. She is literally afraid for her life. That is disgusting and I am ashamed.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand So many people have jumped to the conclusion that she is definitely lying. It has been so depressing and demoralizing the past few days witnessing all the hate people have for her. She has received so many death threats she had to abandon her home with her family. That's partly
@smccolley @SenGillibrand How do you know there's no evidence when no investigation has been done and no one has testified? If that's all you got from that long article I can't help you. I tried.

@smccolley @SenGillibrand https://t.co/5SNLxIGaan
@smccolley @SenGillibrand If younare a dr. or a PhD, that depresses me even more. It seems like you'd understand what effect trauma has on a person. I urge you to read this and think about Dr. Blasey Ford and how she has been treated. I am disappointed you only got offended and have nothing to say.
@AgramonteVictor @PolsenLpolsen @BastaracheNicki @maggieNYT She also mentioned the Judge guy. Don't remember his first name. Mark? Anyway, she says he was there too. He should be subpoenaed.
@LanksMcBrush @maggieNYT I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt. I think she meant to say "that a woman..." I could be wrong, but that's my take.
@SenSanders Bernie, for God's sake. The entire country is gripped in the Kavanaugh mess. Democrats are busy resisting and supporting Dr. Blasey Ford. Republicans arebusy calling her a lying bitch and threatening her life. And you post this???? Do you have anything to say about Kavanaugh?????
@BreitbartNews @AnnCoulter I didn't realize you had a degree in criminal justice or law. You seem to know so much about how investigations work. Maybe you ought to volunteer your expertise to the investigators. I am sure they can use all the help they can get. Let us know how it goes.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand Erfectly reasonable and understandable explanations. Again, take some time to learn the truth, educate yourself and i think you would feel differently.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand As for the anonymous thing...her personal info got leaked to the press and she saw that other people were starting to tell her story. She decided she wanted to be the one to tell her story so she went to the newspaper. All of these accusations and judgments you all make have
@smccolley @SenGillibrand Put my bet on the professionals and not on my emotions and feelings. Maybe read a book sometime. Learn about trauma and the effects it has. I think a lot of you, if you educated yourselves, would have more empathy. It is extra sad that there are so many women calling her a liar.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand I just watched an interview on CNN with a clinical psychologist. He explained that trauma embeds itself in our memories because it is connected to such intense emotion. He also said that it's perfectly normal for a person to forget unimportant things like date, time, etc. I'll
@RobWoolley15 @quahogRIclam @SenGillibrand Don't tell me how I feel.
@RobWoolley15 @quahogRIclam @SenGillibrand Oh so you're calling Anita Hill a liar too? I see you and I'm sick to my stomach.
@Citizen_E11even @Judy04679373 @SenGillibrand The only reason we have seen or heard no evidence is that there hasn't been an investigation. Do you understand how the criminal justice system works?? There's no evidence unless an investigation takes place and people testify under oath. Duh.
@jcrisman72 @LaurenBaratzL She has repented!! She is voting Dem in November and Schmidt is encouraging Never Trumpers to vote Dem.
@PaTresha10 @LaurenBaratzL Nooo, I think Wallace and Schmidt are sincere. Navarro though, has never uttered one word about leaving the party.

@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly Yeah, I am not going to let you get away with lying and spreading misinformation. Keep going.
@RobWoolley15 @quahogRIclam @SenGillibrand Um, have you seen the news recently? She is testifying.
@WendyATai @SenGillibrand So if they accuse Democrats they're real victims and when they accuse Republicans they're paid liars. I was right. Republicans are the biggest most blatant hypocrites on the planet.
@Judy04679373 @Citizen_E11even @SenGillibrand What's even scarier is that it could happen to their own loved ones. Wife, daughter, sister etc.		See? We care about and believe women. Republicans want to defend men at all costs, no matter what the charge, no matter what evidence. Disgusting.
@GBuzby @SenGillibrand That's not her job. It's the FBI s job.
@smccolley @SenGillibrand Remember, it could be your daughter, wife or sister.

@DC_Ham1 @CampNPups @senorrinhatch @CongressRTBot Anita Hill accused him of sexual harrassment. The FBI called in 10+ witnesses in special hearings, amd that was AFTER the FBI investigation, which they completed in 3 days. There is absolutely no reason the Dr. Ford shouldn't receive the same treatment. Except that R senators
@DC_Ham1 @CampNPups @senorrinhatch @CongressRTBot It wasn't a Dem nominee. Clarence Thomas was nominated by Ronald Reagan and he is a staunch conservative judge.
@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly No, you are wrong. The FBI investigated Clarence Thomas for this very offense...sexual assault/harrassment in 1991. Hill accused him and BAM. They investigated as part of his background check.That is what should be done in this case.
@DC_Ham1 @CampNPups @senorrinhatch @CongressRTBot I answered your Keith Ellison example too. I said he should be investigated too. That means I am not the hypocrite. You are. And this Judge Kavanaugh situation is NOT hypothetical. It is happening right in front of us. So try again.

@KimTriplett @honeybeeflies @TerryMCopeland @megynkelly Sure.
@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly That was not a "blanket opinion."  It was logic. What you are  telling me is that crimes or alleged crimes should not be investigated if it's a Republican who is being accused. If this was Hillary or a Democrat, the Senate would have referred this case to the FBI and u know it.
@DanRather @LunaLuvgood2017 Yes it absolutely will. I don't know if Republicans are capable of feeling regret, but women are watching this and women will vote in November. When they lose the House and possibly the Senate, will it be enough for them to say, at least we got Kavanaugh??
@JeffFlake Why aren't Republicans welcoming and encouraging Trump to instigate an FBI investigation? If K is innocent, why is HE not welcoming an investigation? If he is confirmed, he will face protests for years. And if he has a vote on overturning Roe, this makes it even more sickening.

@SenBobCorker @ChuckGrassley Shame. Even Anita Hill, who you all treated like a piece of trash (that's how Republicans treat women) got an FBI investigation. It took 3 days. You  misogynists  are afraid of what an investigation would find. You don't serve the people. You serve yourselves. Resign.
@TheAdvocate14 @megynkelly That word does not mean what you think it means.
@KimTriplett @honeybeeflies @TerryMCopeland @megynkelly How do you know that, when there has been no investigation? Are you a psychic?

@DawnBro40182231 @megynkelly Would you give him a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land?
@FamilyAndSvcHrt @megynkelly No, instinctively doubting a woman before there is even an investigation and calling her a liar when you have no clue is shaming. Asking for proof is logical. That would require an investigation, which we are not getting in this case. No woman should ever vote Republican.
@rghhappy @megynkelly That is not at all what she said. Did you read the article??

@RegJoePrichard If you were the victim of a crime and you went to the police, how would you feel if they said sorry, we can't do anything about it.		 The FBI can investigate this. They can interview people, possibly find diaries...they can interview the other guy who was in the room, Judge. Wtf
@RegJoePrichard @Kathy28194805 @GFelipe7 @Palmetto_Joe @SenFeinstein Crimes are routinely investigated. That's all she's asking for. There is no "list of her demands." Lol god you people are idiots.
@Palmetto_Joe @SenFeinstein She's not reneging. She is demanding an investigation so there will be a frame, direction and actual facts before the hearing starts so Republican Senators can't attack her credibility and humiliate her. But Republicans don't care about truth. They care only about power.
@tiredofleftsact @SenGillibrand Like I said, provide proof. It never happened. It is a lie and you haven't provided proof because there isn't any. Even Trump admitted his tweet implying "she would do anything" was a lie. Kills me that you people are the biggest purveyors of fake news than anyone.

@KShedidnt @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Yes, because we women are so "hysterical." That must ge wyat I'm doing instead of calmly sitting in my apartment watching tv.
@GDKOpinionator @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace But yes, I am outraged, and I have the right to be.
@GDKOpinionator @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Yes, I agree. I simply forgot her name when I typed the comment.
@DougLambert20 @AzorInfo @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace You are asserting that a woman who experiences sexual assault or rape could be "mistaken"?????? If I were raped the experience would be embedded in my very soul. She has been reliving the incident for 30 years and you think she's just made a simple error. Gross.
@notahitwriter @Alyssa_Milano Because it's THAT traumatic.
@notahitwriter @Alyssa_Milano You're saying if a man sexually assaulted you, that you would simply forget what happened several years later. Thank God I have never been attacked. But it is said and I believe that women who have been raped ormsexually assaulted have near photographic memory of the event
@SykesCharlie @gjgordo I just read that out of every 1000 assaults, 994 perpetrators go free. Is that fair??? Yes, I am more worried about fairness for Kavanaugh's victim than I am about any man. If you aren't, you're part ofnthe problem.
@TheRickyDavila @DavKat43 Praise be.
@JuddLegum It's been up since Sunday night. He is a sloth.
@mwk2244 @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace No.
@Rollcast @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace There is proof that he lied in his confirmation hearings. So he is a liar. It's called Google.
@teamtrump5 @PattyMurray How exactly has he "taken care of that?" I'll wait.
@PattyMurray Senator, how does the bill propose to make sure actual pain patients have access to pain medications that actually make our lives bearable.
@ChrisQuines @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace https://t.co/fIVoIyrhDv
@AzorInfo @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace There is at least one corroborating witness. Don't remember her name but she has volunteered to testify.
@dmf0228 @i_mnottellin @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace @SykesCharlie @GOP Statistics prove that women are in fact fleeing the GOP. So are many men.
@AltsonTA @SykesCharlie And she passed a polygraph test. But no, we simply can't ever learn the truth.
@SykesCharlie https://t.co/fIVoIyrhDv
@SykesCharlie When did I argue against fairness??  You literally sat on national tv and argued that there is no way we can learn the truth. If you simply assume that women do not lie when they report sexual assault, you can determine the truth. Only 2% of women lie about sexual assault.
@OMGitzTIMMAY @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Did I say it was proof? There is, however, proof that she's telling the truth. Polygraph. So yes, I believe her, which is the way we should treat women who have been victimized. Calling women liars is disgusting.
@AzorInfo @DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Yes, and it's Kavanaugh. It's been proven that he perjured himself in his confirmation hearings. Therefore, solid evidence convinces me that he's a liar. On the other hand, you have exactly zero proof that the victim is lying.
@rogerdan5 Yes, there was a third person in the room, actually. His name is Judge. But do you have to see something with your own eyes to believe it's true? Or does testimony by other people influence you? Do you deny historical events because you weren't there to witness them? Ignorant.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren Do.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren No, I can't know what she went through. But i can and to believe and support her, and I'd want the same if it were me.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren So you expect people to believe you but you don't believe a woman who has no reason to lie and whon went through hell. Yeah, you're a really great champion of women. You're not a hypocrite at all.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren I mock her because surely she needed support during the hell that she went through. No doubt she would have been devastated if no one had believed her if she did report, and she drags the Kavanaugh victim through the mud and makes it about politics instead of an attempted rape.
@TheRobot352 @Dragynwing @LLVJEN @SenDougJones @JaybeeStewee Ok, let me correct myself. Your vote enabled Donald Trump's win. Your attacks of the sexual assault victim is exactly what Trump wants, so there's that too.
@alt_labor @DonaldJTrumpJr üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren Then I am even more ashamed of you. Dammit, how can you be a woman and not believe women based on who the target is? If it were a Democrat, you'd be calling for his withdrawal and you know it. Hypocrite.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren Look up the definition of corroborating witness. I'm sick of having to educate you. Look up the answers to your questions yourself.
@SenatorNewmanMN @PioneerPress She IS a woman with a legitimate claim and you are inflicting harm on her with this statement. There has been no testimony and you haven't spoken to the victim. How are you SO SURE she's lying? Shame on you.
@DeadlineWH It's me again. Yes, someone more conservative could be nominated. But why is it so difficult to understand that we simply don't want an attempted rapist on the Supreme Court??
@SpeakMyMindGuy @DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren I only hate and resent men who assault and rape women and then deny it, causing the rest of the male population to defend him and accuse the victim of lying.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren And no one is saying the corroborating witness was in the room, moron. A corroborating witness is just that. She verifies the truth of the claim based on the report of what the victim told her at the time. Again, read a book.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren No, there's always been a witness. She didn't just appear out of thin air. Shame on you. I am ashamed of how you are treating the victim. But we all know by now Republican attitudes about women. They never know what they're talking about, they must be confused, they're lying, etc
@DeadlineWH @NicolleDWallace Charlie Sykes is a disgrace. How embarrassing. He just sat on the show and said we'll never know the truth and there's no way we can find out. We must be fair to Kavanaugh. Fuck that. I believe the woman. THAT'S the truth. I love the show but that disgusts me.
@Dragynwing @TheRobot352 @LLVJEN @SenDougJones @JaybeeStewee Whataboutism. Focus.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren Face.
@DeliberativeAss @MarkTully20 @SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren The event where he tried to rip her clothes off, held her down and put his hand over her hmfavmce has been corroborated by a witness who has volunteered to testify before Congress. THERE. There's your answer, you ignorant rube. Try googling or reading a newspaper next time.
@riotwomennn @3DTruth YES, thank you.
@DeliberativeAss @SpeakMyMindGuy @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren Jesus, you people can't even see what's right in front of your face. What if the Dems DID pay for it? I know they didn't but even if they did, SHE STILL PASSED. SHE IS STILL TELLING THE TRUTH. Goddamn morons.
@DeliberativeAss @SpeakMyMindGuy @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren She obviously volunteered because she knew you assholes would call her a liar. Dumbass. Smart woman.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren And he is going to be proved guilty. As I have said, she passed a polygraph, has therapist's notes and has at least one corroborating witness who has volunteered to testify before Congress. All of you on your high horses defending him are making fools of yourselves.
@TheRobot352 @LLVJEN @SenDougJones @JaybeeStewee Proof is she passed a polygraph, has therapist's notes and at least 1 corroborating friend who has volunteered to testify before Congress. You have nothing to stand on here. You're making a fool of yourself.
@TheRobot352 @Dragynwing @LLVJEN @SenDougJones @JaybeeStewee Lol Donald Jerome. Lol dumbass.
@TheRobot352 @Dragynwing @LLVJEN @SenDougJones @JaybeeStewee You've got some nerve shaming Democrats after you voted for the pussy grabber in chief. Like I said, 19 accusers plus his ex wife plus a girl who was 13 when he assaulted her. Hypocrite much?
@TheRobot352 @EHunterAndrews @LLVJEN @SenDougJones Plus
@TheRobot352 @EHunterAndrews @LLVJEN @SenDougJones You voted for a sexual predator who had 19 accusers us his ex wife. You didn't believe any of those women. Franken resigned on our side because we have values and we stick to them. Not that what Franken did was NEARLY as bad as what Trump did. Shame.
@SenDougJones I heard you were on the fence about Kavanaugh. Vote yes and you won't be a Senator flr long.
@BradParrTX @ProudResister @realspaceblatt Most of them believe God commands them to submit to the men in their lives. I have no pity.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @MarkTully20 @TomiLahren Then he should take a polygraph. She did, and she passed. You think we're all conspiracy theorists? Have him take the test somwe'll all know once and for all.
@SpeakMyMindGuy @TomiLahren Who gives a shit what party she belongs to?? She passed a polygraph for God's sake. You people are heartless and soulless. I hope she's a Republican.
@TomiLahren I am ashamed you call yourself a woman. You are a traitor to all of us.
@veschwab I haven't read your books. But I am going to now, based on this tweet. Thank you.‚ù§
@maggieNYT Why would youmeven tweet this?? Shame.
@maggieNYT Yeah let's but a credibly accused predator on the Supreme Court for political reasons. That's what this is saying, NO. Democrats don't equivocate when it comes to attempted rape. PERIOD.
Senator @LisaMurkowski, thank you for standing up for Alaska women. We need you to do it again. Protect our constitutional rights and oppose Brett Kavanaugh. #StopKavanaugh

@JrLarryW @Alyssa_Milano THEY DON'T VOTE UNLESS THEY BECOME CITIZENS. and yes, if they become legal citizens, they will vote D because Republicans are the ones who wanted them deported and painted them all as raping murdering MS13 members. Would you vote flr someone who hated you???
@JrLarryW @Alyssa_Milano It's illegal for a person to vote if they aren't citizens. This has NOTHING to do with how they vote. THEY DON'T VOTE. If they become citizens in the future though, all legally and stuff, you better believe they'll vote D because of the horrible way Reps have treated them.

@Wjf87 @dukebongo @rixonlou @jk_rowling You might want to actually look at her without your racist lens. She does NOT look like that charicature. No one looks like their charicature by definition. This one just happens to be highly racist. Read a book.
@jayex0x0 @ReginaA1981 Unfollow her. That is not smart. Have a nice day being conceited and rude. Both of you.
@jayex0x0 @ReginaA1981 I asked a simple question.  The definition of a term she used in her tweet. She was a bitch when she answered me. I don't ask anyone to 'hold my hand." You just made that shit up. Why can't people simply be nice instead of going on the attack. I am an ally and she caused me to
@DancingABC @GMA I don't know any of these people. Clearly I'm not the target demographic.
@phillyant @JamisonSteele @empatheticjong @RepublicanWife1 @youngilrc @Bewillysodak @rubydeuxdetroit @RudyGiuliani @HillaryClinton Wait. I shared an article from the Guardian and that "explains my "haircut?" Where the hell did that come from? Is that really all you've got? I knew you'd dismiss whatever source I used because you're all goddamn illiterate fuckfaces.
@ReginaA1981 You might try not being a bitch to people who are on your side.
@ReginaA1981 Wow, excuse the fuck out of me.
@Identifythebox @PBS Trumpers aren't Americans.
@JamisonSteele @empatheticjong @RepublicanWife1 @youngilrc @Bewillysodak @rubydeuxdetroit @RudyGiuliani @HillaryClinton It's called google. Use it sometime.		https://t.co/vym1E3Vpap
@F_CameronAuthor @XoXo__Kellie Oh he should sue. That has to be illegal.
@CarmenYulinCruz @ScottforFlorida @CNNPolitics Ha! Dream on. He's a lying thief who's only out for his own wallet. He'll continue to kiss up to polluters and will continue to get more and more rich.
RT @mitchellreports: It's been a mystery for more than a year - who or what caused American officials living in Havana to suffer headaches‚Ä¶
@THR No one is going to watch this shit. Right wingers claim to boycott Netflix and this guy is a right wing asshole.
@ReginaA1981 What is a neoprogressive? Do you mean Democrat?
@virbow1 @MKronader @Tammy24802877 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes, because you're a moron. And I am not screeching.
@Da_vidF @theheraldsun @usopen That just  means there are right wing nutbar assholes in Britain.
@Identifythebox @PBS And don't call me sweetheart, asshole.
@Identifythebox @PBS You have proven my point about Trump supporters. Don't believe reputable news sources yet you trust Fox and Breitbart.
@Someone66321 @AnnCoulter Are they required to cover pre existing conditions? Are they required to cover birth control? How are employees faring with premiums now that they have no govt. protection?
@PhilipRucker He's delusional at best.
@Identifythebox @PBS And wages are stagnant and middle class Americans, teachers, have to go on food stamps to feed their families. And the $40 tax "cut" won't fill a gas tank.
@Da_vidF @theheraldsun @usopen Which you are, if you voted for Trump.
@arctic_anne @AnnCoulter Not at all. I just know $40 won't fill my gas tank.
@virbow1 @MKronader @Tammy24802877 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes, Breitbart is nothing but feces. And all you morons know how to do is screech BENGHAZI!!!!!!! with absolutely zero facts to back yourselves up. Except when it's Breitbart or similar, which is NOT a reputable news source no matter what you morons say.
@MKronader @virbow1 @Tammy24802877 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Proof.
@MKronader @virbow1 @Tammy24802877 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Tell me what you would like me to research	 I will be GLAD to provide propf that whatever a Trump turd says is a LIE.
@acholla527 And she said she was not a real person but was a bot. That makes ZERO SENSE looking at all her posts and comments. She is a Trump turd.
@acholla527 I went to her page. She is one nasty piece of work. Licking Trump's orange ass, believing all his lies. Disgusting.
@JamesGreiff Nov. 2018
@acholla527 Wow, what'd you do to her???üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@TuckerCarlson What does your Bible say about this, @TuckerCarlson?
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I'd rather read Woodward. Maybe I'll use yours as TP.
@KrisHereAgain @MrDane1982 The difference is that his followers actually want him to run in 2020. We cannot let that happen.
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Breitbart? Way to totally out yourself as a lying racist Nazi shitbag.
@kazkaz119 @MrFilmkritik @insomniacx29 He was not. This is a lie.
@ChristinaWorthm @kaitlancollins @ChelseaClinton Why would you post that here?????? How totally offensive. Shame.
@MimiLeroch @kaitlancollins @soledadobrien What's it called?
@kaitlancollins @ChelseaClinton Beautiful, gave me chills.
@tudorqueenAB @MuhammadLila The American people will always be your friends, and we will have a President who is too, in 2020.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
@MuhammadLila @jaketapper I so want to visit Newfoundland.
@realDonaldTrump For a minute I doubted whether he'd actually written this. What was I thinking?
@TheNewArena https://t.co/7mNmpXxqdx
@craigdf1966 @stefunny76 @AnnCoulter Proof?
@arctic_anne @AnnCoulter That $40 really comes in handy does it?
@Someone66321 @AnnCoulter Saved businesses that no longer provide health insurance for their employees. Lovely.
@ocalasportsman @AnnCoulter @NancyPelosi That was Marie Antoinette, dumbass. Even she did not really say it. It's a myth. Google is your friend.
@SenatorCollins Vote NO on Kavanaugh and prove to us that you really are pro choice and actually care about women, LGBTQ, those with pre existing conditions, etc. etc.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Read your dad's Twitter feed, moron.
@jamesrubyworks @WhoKares34 @michellemalkin Same.
@TOUGH_TEXAN @michellemalkin Proud of that red x are you? üòÇ
@PaulScalice @michellemalkin Definitely, if he goes and throws paper towels at the victims and tells them their hurricane wasn't really that big after all. (1400 dead in PR)
@michellemalkin He doesn't and they do.
@jennobenno @MonicaRivpin Phil Bredesen beats Marsha Blackburn (TN)
@jmannarino5 @HillaryClinton Another MAGA sexist, blaming her for her husband's infractions.
@HillaryClinton Thank you Madame President.
@TheCalebBond @JoshMoneyFOX @kathygriffin @Knightcartoons I suppose you don't think this is racist either. Thismisnwhat Knight did. Read a book. https://t.co/uWK1qTNlBt
@TheCalebBond @mdixonsmith @kathygriffin @Knightcartoons Derp.
@janelouise2 @The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump That's how you honor and remember the dead. Trump is a gd  moron.
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Oh is that what he's doing? I thought he was busy attacking the very FBI who keeps us safe every day, as well as the DOJ. At least he hasn't beagged about how tall his building is, like he did this time 17 years ago. Yet.
@MKronader @Tammy24802877 @virbow1 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump And don't give me Breitbart feces as proof.
@MKronader @Tammy24802877 @virbow1 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Proof or stfu
@rmayemsinger @USPatriot01810 They don't know words and stuff.
@mathewsjw @rmayemsinger Rethugs are vile, wanting to arm teachers. That's some  really fucked up logic. Cunts.
@blon480 @rmayemsinger Comprehension is important. Use your context clues and maybe you'll understand what she actually meant. She hopes they don't get shot at school, because school shootimgs are an epidemic in America and Reps want to arm teachers and students.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Here....Trudeau is a real leader. He is Canadian and he is honoring those who lost their lives 17 years ago on 9/11. Pay attention. Think you can? I know it's difficult for you. https://t.co/WUHu2Oj1hP
@realDonaldTrump @SaraCarterDC @LouDobbs Here, maybe this will help. This is how you're supposed to do it today, you orange moron. https://t.co/Ercl5ZYAiV
@EightySix45 @realDonaldTrump @SaraCarterDC @LouDobbs https://t.co/XzYKyhqXH7
@rixonlou @dukebongo @jk_rowling You said it wasn't Sambo like and was i saying SW is a small person...right? That is what I was responding to.
@rixonlou @dukebongo @jk_rowling Here is a Sambo image. You're saying there is no comparison? https://t.co/qrPEbXU2ab
@rixonlou @dukebongo @jk_rowling I am saying that she is of average size. Google other cartoons of her and you will see what I mean. Fat lips, fat hips and a fat head are racist tropes and were used for decades in the US to portray black people as animal like, which is what this cartoon did.
@dukebongo @rixonlou @jk_rowling He portrays her with big lips, a big head and big hips. A racist, Sambo like image. You're saying he didn't do that on purpose? Bless your heart.
@jk_rowling @RemusJLupin2017 Into a white faceless prop no less.
@soledadobrien Thay whole thread is disgusting.
@Brasilmagic I did not get that impression from Rachel.
@emptywheel @MalcolmNance Beats the fuck out of being the party of David Duke et. al.
@ashleyfeinberg What am I looking at?
@CherieAnne @NorahODonnell I so can. I do not have one Republican friend and I do not speak to or even acknowledge family members who vote Republican. It amounts to advertising that you're a lowdown dirty lying racist sexist POS and I want nithing to do with it.
@peltzmadeline Fox makes me want to vomit. They are slimy hypocrites with no integrity whatsoever.
@Identifythebox @PBS üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ all the Republican Neo Nazi figures in one video. Well done!
@laurenduca Claire McCaskill is undecided????????
@babny002 @PeterBlunden_ @Cornesy12 Oh he meant it.
@librahim @PeterBlunden_ And Serena's exagerrated lips, big head, etc. It is clearly a Sambo like image and the fact that they don't or won't see that says all i need to know about them.
@unenergy @PeterBlunden_ Oh dear god.
@PeterBlunden_ No. It is absolutely deeply racist and deeply sexist. He whitewashed Naomi while exagerrating the features of a black American champion who stood up for herself. Add up the comments here, see which way the wind is blowing and DO BETTER.
@Shawn00Guerra @MLottawa342 @TheRickWilson Roger Stone
@TheRickWilson Link please! üòÇ
@vickielshack @bluzshu @LardFDorkness @atrupar @OMAROSA Her book is a best seller, moron. She's an opportunist I sure hope she releases more tapes to demonstrate Trump's ineptitude. He's mentally unfit to be a dog catcher and you people, I guess, need to hear that from Trump's mouth or you won't believe it.
@Da_vidF @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen The first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem. Good job.
@Dmuthalovinmase @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen Knight
@Dmuthalovinmase @Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen More than 10 percent, I'd guess. And am I correct in saying Mark Kight is Australian? He should be fired.
@Knightcartoons @theheraldsun @usopen This is racist, sexist garbage.  SHAME ON YOU.
@JusticeTrolls @BuffyResists What is her name and where does she work??
@ChrisCuomo Chris, I just saw your clip with Angela Rye and Jason whatsisname debating the family separation policy. I was with you until you told Angela to "have a smile sometime." That was sexist and you should know better. I'm ashamed.
@SteveKingIA Read a book.
