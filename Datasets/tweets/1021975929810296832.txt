R U Ok is an important question to ask at this time of year. Christmas is a very difficult time for a lot of people so we need to ask everyone the question. You never know what someone is really feeling. I am hoping that everyone will take on the challenge to ask the question https://t.co/OOtrDAOjEa
@ruokday Thank you so much for your understanding and support to the community. I am wondering how many people feel lonely when they're around other people? I would like to know the answer to this question if you know. I have felt alone in a room full of people at times.
@ruokday I didn't realise that so many Australian's feel lonely at least one day a week it makes me feel normal knowing this. 	Perhaps we should all begin to say how we feel it may help others feel normal. Thank you for sharing this information. R U Ok challenge is terrific join it now!

@ruokday I'm in I'll join the 12day R U Ok holiday helper challenge
The negative voice's get a bit out of control at this time of year. Anxiety building leading up to Christmas. You can't afford to buy the gifts you'd like and see those around you happy and getting everything that they want. Life's tough at Christmas especially. I'm not okay! https://t.co/7B1csKo7BE
@ruokday @beyondblue Around this time of year anxiety can become overwhelming. So much to do and try to make thing's perfect. Thinking of those no longer with us and dealing with some people who make life difficult. Trying to buy gifts that you really can't afford. Christmas is a very tough time.
So true! You cannot truly love someone else until you first love yourself or you will have nothing to give love. https://t.co/zaJqHuuT5m
It's about time someone who is in a position of power speaks out against Centrelink a culture of bullying and threatening people that they will not be able to travel, which in some cases means visiting family. Centrelink are just bullies &amp; most people who work there don't care. https://t.co/nlEnSVE5NZ
We do need to look at climate change but money could be more well spent on prevention of suicide particularly male's especially at this time of year. We also need to put money into our farmers before all we eat comes from other countries. I think it's worth helping more. https://t.co/ImQmqWkikE
Suicide prevention is so important. Keeping our funding for better understanding and support for Australian's especially at this time of year rather than putting the money to moving people off Nauru who should not be here in the first place. Let the children be with their parents https://t.co/HECjKi0zl8
I totally agree with you. Men are seen as sexy yet somehow women are somehow seen as unsexy in the over 50's when women are really at their sexiest. This is why so many mature aged woman are turning to Botox, fillers and facelifts when their faces are beautiful ‚ù§‚ù§ https://t.co/hFZKVBOwxs
I think a culture of hugs has been proven in studies to benefit people's mental health and lead therefore to less sick leave. Everyone has the right to say no &amp; you know that this is part of the culture when you start the job. Good on you Ted Baker! Everyone needs a hug üòä https://t.co/XxFjqYiydQ
@janemerrick23 How do you know so much you've never worked there. This is not a terrible thing and is beneficial to people's mental health and people have the right to find another place to work. Stop minimising the me Too movement
I totally agree with you and studies have shown that this is beneficial. I am getting so angry with the people aligning this with the metoo movement and minimising the great benefits to people's mental health. Thank you for your commonsense! https://t.co/Z3wt6YKjAO
Why is this being added to the #metoomovement Simply sign the petition and say no to a hug. Don't minimise the impact of the me too movement please! https://t.co/2Mbety1J1G
Please don't jump on the #MeTooMovement when you obviously have no idea what this means. The metoo movement is a very serious movement. Stop minimising it to your own agenda otherwise another powerful cause will be eroded. Sign the petition for change but don't get confused Sonia https://t.co/1SwQKFksOK
Hugging is so needed in our society that people are doing it for a living &amp; getting well paid. Forced hugging is not good but I think a culture of hugging in the workplace is an awesome ideology. Well done good on you love to work there. Always going to be a creepy person though https://t.co/8vhjWDulyZ
There's been evidence that people are starving of hugs and need it. So why is a culture of hugging in the work space such a bad thing? I think it's not fair to force people but it is good for people's mental health. Good on the company head &amp; I hope it continue's. https://t.co/49HLkbwtG5

I have used private health insurance for year's and would have had to pay thousands or be put on a waitlist for years. Lowering the price of health insurance is the only thing that makes sense. Migration need's to slow down to lessen the burden on healthcare https://t.co/yAZxyyZHvc
@TobaccoSouvlaki @upulie @billshortenmp I agree if they lowered immigration it would certainly take the burden off the health care system. I was at the Children's Hospital and it was full of immigrants and my son had to go next door to the adults hospital because they're so over loaded! Australian children put last!!
