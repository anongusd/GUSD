@SMazi20 @benjaminwittes You shouldn’t drink and tweet. This doesn’t make sense
@benjaminwittes Actually yes, many people are taking that away because of facts
RT @SarcasmStardust: So much for that progressive “sisterhood”. Not a single one of Omar’s “friends” have bothered to come to her defense.…
@jbouie U don’t have to love airports to know you can’t take a train to Paris. Nice defense

@peterdaou @ReneeRose723 Trump
@AOC But aren’t races with singular experiences capable of varying thoughts/ideas? Why would any one black representative satiate the entirety of the “black experience? We need more than one

Thank you Andy! Not only are they unfunny, but it’s time to admit FREE SPEECH can be HATE SPEECH! Let’s ban these jerks! https://t.co/0VHaC0y1a3
Is free speech really free? Or do we pay a price for this type of speech? https://t.co/NwWqtmq6LF
There is no humor in non-binary people jokes. Or school shooting survivors. Why is this type of speech allowed? https://t.co/NwWqtmq6LF
So true. It’s obvious that when whites face economic despair they whisper ‘At least I am white.’ This is the definition of white privilege people! Genius take by @CharlesMBlow https://t.co/HQOGsjaqbK

Who are you trying to help these days on Twitter? Maybe it's time to leave the spotlight and focus on your legal career. Your time as a thought-leader/provocateur has ended. And I'm being generous with 'thought-leader.' https://t.co/FToUdHa1mO

@maggieNYT A large swath of Democrats consider Obama a failed presidency in many respects. 2020 race is about to get ugly

Disturbing imagery and spelling. And we need to question if MLK today would hold the same views. It’s quite possible he would be a radical intersectionalist IMO https://t.co/dJdhU7UwYH

@DagachDanyal @jjackapplemac @StefanMolyneux No but the white patriarchal societies have disproportionate influence and power to oppress a greater number of people
@jjackapplemac @StefanMolyneux I think I know what you are trying to say but that is an older paradigm. The new paradigm is that the advances of the white colonial patriarchal society have not been worth the pain that it has caused to all marginalized groups. That is the new math

White privilege is exhausting
@StefanMolyneux Yes, I do. We are responsible for the majority of the world’s injustices
@Mikel_Jollett Pretty sure if it makes a mil a day from now on Congress will change its mind before summer. Not sure u added common sense in your equation
