@BermanPatterson @TamikaDMallory It has to do with knowing the difference between legit criticizing a government, vs making statements that are hurtful tropes based on bogus stereotypes, like Jews and money, or blacks and laziness; etc.  Tgus is not a racial issue. It‚Äôs a human issue.

@TamikaDMallory That doesn‚Äôt make it ok. The Ruhr never calls out their own. We have to be better than that. Has zero to do with race.
@TamikaDMallory @IlhanMN Trump is a horrible hypocrite, as are many R‚Äôs who never call out their own for their bigotry. Having said that, the trope of Jews and money has a long history, and is very hurtful to Jews. U can call out a country‚Äôs policies, w/out  resorting to historically anti Semitic tropes.
