3) The little things matter, the details and the leatherfaced Pumpkinman in DC is proud to have no compassion or context. He's not lived anything less than a charmed life of gold. He's the minority! We are the majority, from the PEOPLE! By the PEOPLE! Who knows what it's like! 🇺🇸
2) This kind of person is not a leech, like many current wealthy politicians claim! This person has lived life among the majority in this country today. They possess the compassion, the humility and appreciation of progress because every little thing matters to them.
1) Here's a novel approach to an American President. How about a person that's lived in subsidized housing? A person that has had to pay for bread and milk with food stamps? A person that has to be so very meticulous with their budget that they know it right down to the penny?

@QuestLyfe @CBR @brielarson Oh, absolutely. I'm really interested in seeing how both of the films do, as far as popularity is concerned. I'm a fan of both actresses, so maybe saying Widow is a "vaguely compelling character" is a bit absurdist. I'm not flaming anyone though.
@lil_vettee I admit, I'm a little biased toward @captainmarvel. I'm not arguing or trying to start a flame war. I agree with you. Your opinion is spot on.

@SenJeffMerkley He's being confirmed, 100%. It's a nightmare you can't wake up from. Innocent or guilty, Judge Kavanaugh can't be trusted &amp; has shown an extreme lack of credibility &amp; integrity. I think it's high time the American people were able to vote on SCOTUS nominees! #TimeForAChange
