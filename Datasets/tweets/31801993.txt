The wall is costly, impractical and unnecessary. Mexico is never going to pay for, the American people don’t want it and declaring a national emergency to build it is illegal.
Despite the president’s lies, there is no national emergency on our nation’s border and circumventing Congress on this issue will set a dangerous precedent that Republicans may very well regret.
Make no mistake, Democrats will fight President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency in Congress, the courts and wherever in necessary to prevent the president from trampling on the Constitution.
President Trump’s ridiculous demands for a costly and unnecessary border wall previously led to a shutdown that lasted for 35 days. While this agreement is far from perfect, it is a hard earned compromise that avoids another disastrous government shutdown for our country.

.@realDonaldTrump continues to stoke irrational fear of and anger toward immigrant communities. For years the president has blamed immigrants for our nation’s challenges instead of providing real solutions that can bring our country together. #SOTU
We can debate the future of our nation’s immigration system but doing so by threatening to close the government is irresponsible and dangerous for working families. It is time for the president to abandon his extreme and divisive tactics. #SOTU
For more than a month @realDonaldTrump shut down our government for an extreme and unnecessary border wall. Tonight, it is clear the president has not learned his lesson and that he wants another #TrumpShutdown.
The President claims that he wants to make health care more affordable, but he refuses to stop sabotaging our health care system, which drives up costs and undermines critical protections for people living with pre-existing conditions.

Don’t tell us you want to unify the country. Show us.
You continue to fear monger by calling asylum seekers “animals” and “criminals”
You continue to praise Putin and foreign dictators while denigrating our intelligence agencies
On February 3rd you said that Speaker Pelosi, “doesn’t mind human trafficking”
On January 31st you called the Democrats the party of, “late term abortion, high taxes, open borders, and crime”
On January 10th you said that China is “far more honorable” in negotiations than “Chuck and Nancy”
On the eve of the Midterm elections you tweeted about a “Democrat-Led assault on our sovereignty”
On October 31st you blamed Democrats for murders committed by undocumented immigrants
In September of 2017 you called an NFL player who kneeled to protest police brutality a “son of a bitch” and stated in May of 2018 that “Maybe they shouldn't be in the country”

We should look to Dr. King’s legacy of courage and service as we confront our nation’s challenges and strive toward a more perfect union.
Dr. King devoted his life to bringing awareness to society’s problems and working with others to solve them.  He was once quoted as saying “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is ‘What are you doing for others?’”
While we have made great strides since his life was cut tragically short, his message still resonates today as a reminder of how far we’ve come, and how far we still have to go.
Today we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King envisioned a world where all men and women were equal in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of society.

It is time for the president to abandon his extreme and divisive tactics and reopen the government for the American people.
Last week, House Democrats swiftly voted to reopen our government by passing legislation that had already passed the Republican Senate. We can debate the future of our nation’s immigration system but doing so by closing the government is irresponsible &amp; dangerous.
Now he has held our nation hostage and shutdown our government for weeks in a pathetic attempt to build this wall. The President should be ashamed.
Like many Americans, I am appalled by President Trump’s fear mongering and deception in tonight’s remarks. For years the president has blamed immigrants for our nation’s challenges while promising an expensive, wasteful and unnecessary wall.

This is just another move by the Trump Administration to prop up dirty power in this country.
Undermining successful mercury protections is harmful to public health and is bad for business, so EPA is relying on shaky accounting tricks to justify their dangerous decision.
Even the power industry is opposed to EPA’s reckless actions because they have already made investments to clean up their pollution to comply with MATS.
This move is especially harmful for pregnant women, babies and communities of color, so it’s no wonder EPA tried to keep it hidden from the public.
EPA is taking its first step to sabotage the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), intended to protect communities from dangerous mercury and hazardous air pollution spewed from coal and oil burning power plants

In an era of intensifying #ClimateChange, it is disgraceful that the Administration is signaling a desire for new U.S. coal generation.
Building new coal plants in the U.S. is not economical due to abundant cleaner and cheaper sources of energy, and this new roll back won’t change that reality.

Any nominee for Attorney General must vow to put loyalty to the law and the constitution above loyalty to the President.
Given the forced resignation of Attorney General Sessions, Congress must act to ensure that the Justice Department’s integrity is preserved and that the Mueller investigation is allowed to continue unabated and without interference.
For the past 2 years President Trump  has attempted to thwart investigations into his campaign and administration by bullying the Attorney General and politicizing the Justice Department.
I’ll also be working to hold the Trump Administration accountable for its culture of corruption that seriously undermines critical health care, environmental and consumer protections.
Looking forward to continuing to work on priorities that are especially important to my district and NJ like stopping the Trump administration’s offshore drilling plans, repealing the GOP tax plan that is costing working families and continuing to the fight the opioid epidemic.

I have been inspired by all those who have fought Kavanugh’s nomination and know that millions of Americans will continue the fight on so many important issues and work to ensure that women are heard.
Just as importantly, today’s vote ignored the powerful &amp; compelling testimony of Dr. Ford. Doing so sends a terrible message to all victims of sexual assault throughout our country.
Today the Senate ignored their voices and confirmed BrettKavanaugh’s nomination to the #SCOTUS. I have little doubt that Kavanugh will work to protect and expand the Trump administration’s extreme policies.

The selection of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is an attempt to protect and expand Trump’s extreme policies. We cannot allow him to be confirmed.
There is little doubt that Kavanaugh’s vote on #SCOTUS would undo hard earned rights that are embedded in our constitution &amp; have the support of the American people. Voting rights &amp; policies that promote diversity &amp; equality in our country now hang in the balance.

And those policies should apply equally to the President, politicians, Administration officials, celebrities, and the teenager down the street.
Twitter and other social media platforms must establish clear policies to address the problems discussed today, provide tools to users, and then swiftly and fairly enforce those policies.
Regardless of the Republicans’ intentions for this hearing, Twitter and other social media platforms must do more to regain and maintain the public trust. Bullying, the spread of disinformation, and malicious foreign influence continue.
The President has demonstrated that the politics of division are good for fundraising and rousing his base. Sadly, Republicans are now following his lead instead of criticizing the President for behavior that would not be tolerated from a child.
President Trump uses Twitter to bully and belittle people calling them names like “dog,” “clown,” “spoiled brat,” “son of a bitch,” “enemies,” and “loser.” He routinely tweets false statements designed to mislead Americans and foster discord.

I have faith that our country will rise above the events of Charlottesville and continue on a path towards equality and justice for all Americans.
Last year in Long Branch I joined with numerous faith leaders and citizens to speak out against the bigotry we saw in Charlottesville and I continue to be inspired by all those working to enact positive change.
They can see the difference between right and wrong and continue to speak out against the President’s bigotry.
.@realDonaldTrump shares responsibility for the emboldening of these radical and violent entities. An overwhelming majority of Americans do not believe that there were “some very fine people on both sides.”
One year ago, we saw white supremacist demonstrators try to wreak havoc amongst the American public. The hateful demonstrations and deadly violence that occurred in #Charlottesville are antithetical to American values.
We need to know why the FCC did not come forward with the truth about the fake cyberattack sooner. It's outrageous that the American people and Congress were lied to for over a year by the FCC. #ForThePeople https://t.co/aGoLYaLS6M

I asked for a hearing on the EPA’s management of toxic chemicals, but @HouseGOP continue to put their head in the sand when it comes to conducting any oversight of the Trump Admin. It’s time for the people to have a say in the People’s House. #ForThePeople	https://t.co/gMWBgbeEAs

It was great speaking to the Inaugural Diversity in Tech Summit about the important role our nation’s #HBCUs can play in building a more diverse talent pipeline for our #tech industry #PowerOfPartnerships
Repealing #NetNeutrality has real consequences for consumers. Without these rules, telecom companies can charge extra fees for consumers to use certain websites or apps. We need to keep up our support of #NetNeutrality and force a vote on the House Floor.
New Jersey's fishing industry, from recreational charter boats to commercial seafood harvesting, is worth $7.9 billion annually and supports 50,000 jobs. Just another reason Trump’s plans for drilling off NJ’s coast are unacceptable. #KillTheDrill #TBT https://t.co/vy6y64BZN1

The FCC is also an independent agency, and the President should not be trying to influence its work to protect consumers. The Sinclair-Tribune merger was bad for local news, competition and diverse viewpoints.

This is why we need strong Congressional oversight when it comes to the family reunification process. We need an @EnergyCommerce hearing immediately to hold the Trump administration accountable given its horrendous actions at the border.
We learned that ICE and CBP often did not keep records for tracking when &amp; which parents were separated from their children. This has made their reunification all the more difficult.

Trump also talked about “both sides” being at fault in Charlottesville. The Presidents stands up for Putin &amp; white supremacists while refusing to defend those who would actually hold them accountable. https://t.co/At5ATgpXPW
Just to be clear, President Trump sided with Putin- a former KGB intelligence officer - instead of every US intelligence agency on Russian election tampering. Simply astounding.
Today Trump propped up a dictator by allowing Putin to tell lie after lie without being challenged. Hard to a remember a time when an American President was so weak on the world stage.
After spending last week berating our NATO allies, Trump meets with Putin today. He has refused to confront Russia about interfering in our election and other pressing issues. We need a leader who actually stands up to Russia and holds Putin accountable for his thuggery. https://t.co/hiln8Rxz6Y

Republicans have broken precedent and made a mockery of the Senate by refusing to give Merrick Garland a hearing and by removing the need for 60 votes for Supreme Court justices. It’s time that the Senate holds this administration accountable by rejecting this extreme nominee.
We should also be concerned that he would support rolling back the Affordable Care Act and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions. We cannot afford to move backward on these crucial issues.
Justice Kennedy’s vote helped bring about marriage equality and protect a woman’s right to choose. There is little doubt that Kavanaugh’s vote would undo these hard earned rights that are embedded in our constitution and have the support of the American people.
Those who believe in the constitution and the rights that so many Americans have sacrificed for need to oppose this nomination.
Trump has led a relentless assault on workers, minorities, women, immigrants, the environment and on the rule of law itself. The selection of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is an attempt to protect and expand the administration’s extreme policies.

These outrageous rates are one more insult as desperate parents try to weave their way through the bureaucracy to find their children. It is an inexcusable insult to injury.

It is the wealthy owners of large corporations who reap the main benefits of the #GOPTaxScam, not middle-class wage earners and their families. https://t.co/74S2SDHZaj
For those in NJ, the #GOPTaxScam has been particularly painful. Eliminating SALT deductions dramatically increased New Jersians’ overall tax rates, and I will keep fighting to bring them back down.
Since passage of the #GOPTaxScam, average hourly earnings have not budged. In fact, a recent analysis of the data released by Trump’s @BLS_gov showed that average hourly earnings have actually gone down slightly.
The Republican tax law is a scam that benefits the wealthy and corporate interests. The American people are not fooled, and no amount of misleading rhetoric is going to change that fact. #GOPTaxScam
A @monmouthu poll shows that the majority of Americans are not fooled by the #GOPTaxScam – with only 34% approving of the law.
Today’s hearing on #GOPTaxScam was nothing more than a blatant attempt by the Republican majority to tout its unpopular tax “plan” in the hopes that middle-class Americans – who are not seeing any substantial benefits– might just reconsider their opposition.

As a new generation of troops serve our nation overseas, we should also think of their sacrifices and those of their families as they are in harm’s way every day.  Congress must remain committed to supporting our veterans and the families of those who have fallen.

#PresidentTrump was completely disingenuous about benefits of the #IranDeal. Security experts and international inspectors agree that Iran has halted nuclear activity under it – exactly what the deal was supposed to do. Leaving w no plan B is foolish and likely dangerous.
The decision to withdraw from the Iran deal undercuts our allies like Great Britain, France, &amp; Germany who continue to express their desire to remain in the agreement. US will now be left w fewer opportunities to curb the development of nuclear weapons in #Iran
The #IranDeal is not perfect, but it is our best chance to preserve peace and security. #PresidentTrump has yet to explain what the credible alternative is to the deal, or fully demonstrate that it understands the consequences of walking away.

I am confident that these investigations will affirm what I have come to believe is true: you are unfit to hold public office and undeserving of the public trust.
Fortunately, Committee Democrats have been demanding answers and five independent federal investigations are now being done into your conduct at our request.
Now, Committee Republicans have conveniently told the press they are investigating you for some your outrageous ethical abuses. Yet, I’ve seen no evidence from Committee Republicans that this is really happening.
The fact is Administrator Pruitt has used this office as nothing more than an opportunity to enrich himself and his corporate friends, and President Trump seems to be perfectly fine with all of his actions. So much for draining the swamp.
So far, 140 House Democrats have signed onto a resolution introduced by Ms. Castor expressing “no confidence” in you, Mr. Pruitt.  Additionally, four Republican House Members have also called on you to step down. This should not be a partisan matter
Administrator Pruitt has brought secrecy, conflicts of interest and scandal to the EPA.  In any other administration, Republican or Democrat, you would be long gone by now.

My questioning of Mark #Zuckerberg on the Cambridge Analytica scandal: https://t.co/odmVbtxms6
It’s time for this Committee and this Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to prevent incidents like this in the future. #Zuckerberg
By not doing its job, this Republican-controlled Congress has become complicit in this nonstop cycle of privacy by press release. #Zuckerberg
We all know the cycle by now: our data is stolen and the company looks the other way; eventually reporters find out, publish a negative story, and the company apologizes. Congress then holds a hearing; and then…nothing. #Zuckerberg
The fact is no one knows how many people have access to the Cambridge Analytica data.  And no one knows how many other Cambridge Analyticas are still out there. This incident demonstrates yet again that our laws are not working. #Zuckerberg
For all the good it brings, Facebook can be a weapon for those like Russia and Cambridge Analytica that seek to harm us and hack our democracy. Facebook made it too easy for a single person to get extensive personal information about 87 million people. #Zuckerberg

I will do everything within my power to prevent the Trump administration from interfering with the Mueller investigation or the numerous Congressional investigations looking into Trump’s interactions with Russia.
While today’s indictments are sweeping, the Mueller investigation is far from over. Members of Trump world have lied again and again about their interactions with Russia and the indictments today show once again how dangerous those interactions may have been for our democracy.
Congress has no more important task than protecting the integrity of our democracy and it is essential that Congress take the lead in doing so for 2018, with or without President Trump.
President Trump has chosen to attack our intelligence agencies and its brave employees rather than acknowledge Russia’s indiscretions, let alone take serious actions to retaliate and/or prevent them in the future.
Despite months of denial and misdirection from the Trump administration, today’s 13 indictments from Special Counselor Mueller’s investigation show once and for all that Russia interfered in our democracy and the 2016 election.

Allow the CDC and other government agencies to use federal dollars to research gun violence and gun violence prevention – which the gun lobby &amp; @GOP has blocked for more than 20 years.
Regulate the online sale of ammunition, conversion kits (to turn into military-style rifles), and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.
Regulate the sale of firearms at gun shows and online, requiring a background check on all purchases (currently not allowed by many states).
Increasing penalties for “straw purchasers” who illegally purchase firearms with the intent to sell or gift them to individuals who should not have them.
Universal Background Checks – including strengthening and broadening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Banning weapons of war like the AR-15, which has been used in mass shootings in places like Las Vegas, Aurora, Newtown, &amp; Parkland.

The partisan memo uses intelligence out of context to distort the truth and push the administration’s various conspiracy theories. I find it disgusting that our President is more interested in attacking the FBI than getting to the bottom of Russian interference in our elections.
I am appalled that the President of the United States has declassified intelligence in order to attack and slander dedicated public servants and members of our intelligence community.

We cannot ignore the prejudice and bigotry that exists today. We must stand up to and confront it.
While we have made tremendous strides, today we live in a country where our President defends and enables white supremacists and uses vulgar terms to describe Haiti and African nations.
Americans owe a debt to the brave African Americans who marched and risked their lives during the civil rights movement to gain non-discrimination protections, voting rights and equality under the law for all of us.
#BlackHistoryMonth is a time to honor and recognize the important contributions African Americans have made to our nation’s history and identity.

FACT CHECK - 	President Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan.  He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years.  He expects states, localities, and the private sector to come up with $1.3 trillion on their own.
Enough with @realDonaldTrump’s saber rattling, which is unnecessarily antagonizing our adversaries and alienating our allies. The American people deserve a steady hand on the wheel when it comes to our foreign policy and national defense. The President is falling short.
FACT CHECK- Job Creation:  Under President Trump, in 2017, 2.06 million jobs were created. However, that is lower than the 2.24 million jobs created in 2016 and is also lower than job creation in eachof the previous six years https://t.co/jDIKR6x4PD

This projection of hate and intolerance manifested itself in the ransacking of homes of Indonesian Christians in Highland Park &amp; Edison, NJ last week. It is antithetical to American values that have made our country the envy of the world.

We do not need to sacrifice a safe environment in order to modernize our infrastructure and expand our economy.
Rather than propose the investment needed to modernize our infrastructure, the President is touting harmful environmental rollbacks that will endanger human health and the environment and threaten our communities here in New Jersey.
We should be able to work together to fix our crumbling infrastructure, but #PresidentTrump does not appear to be serious about pushing a bipartisan proposal.
Yesterday @GovMurphy  signed an exec order putting NJ back into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to combat #ClimateChange. Where’s the leadership from @realDonaldTrump on this crucial issue? #RGGI
.@realDonaldTrump used vulgar terms to describe immigrants from Haiti &amp; African nations. He used a racial slur with Navajo code talkers next to him at the WhiteHouse. Trump defended white supremacists in Charlottesville. Actions speak louder than words.
It’s also #RobinHood in Reverse with most of the benefits going to NJ’s wealthiest families.
@realDonaldTrump #TheGOPTaxScam is especially devastating for NJ because it limits deductions on State and Local Taxes that help millions of working families make ends meet.
.@realDonaldTrump still doesn’t get it. The #GOPTaxScam hikes taxes on 86 million middle-class families, takes away health coverage from 13 million Americans, and increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is a bad deal for American families.

What is the impact on food safety activities?		During a shutdown, the FDA is unable to support the majority of its food safety activities.  The 2013 16-day shutdown sharply curtailed critical FDA food safety inspections of domestic and international food facilities.

In recent days we have once again seen #PresidentTrump use hateful rhetoric to attack minorities &amp; scapegoat immigrants. This behavior is antithetical to what Dr. King stood for &amp; the dream he had for our country.
While we have made great strides since his life was cut tragically short, his message still resonates today.
#MLK envisioned a world where all men &amp; women are equal in the eyes of the law &amp; where all Americans ‘will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'

The #GOPTaxScam is especially disastrous for New Jersey. Limiting #SALT deductions is simply unacceptable given the tax burden already facing New Jerseyans.  I am outraged that my constituents will be slammed by this careless legislation.
And by repealing the individual mandate the bill will also spike health insurance premiums and leave 13 million more uninsured. My Republicans colleagues should be ashamed for so clearly favoring the wealthy over the middle class.
A recent Tax Policy Center study found that 86 million middle class households will see their taxes go up as a result of the bill. Meanwhile, 83% of the supposed benefits of the bill will go the top 1% of the wealthiest of Americans.
Today, #GOP sacrificed the well-being of their constituents &amp; the country to jam through a so-called political victory. It's our responsibility as Members of Congress to fight for all Americans, not just the wealthy, &amp; the #GOPTaxScam leaves behind millions of working families.

I only have five minutes, so I can’t list all of the actions the Administrator has taken to undermine protections for public health, and specifically for vulnerable populations including workers, children, and Native American tribes. 7)But Here’s just a few examples... #Pruitt
Administrator #Pruitt has also launched an unprecedented assault on independent science, purging academic scientists with no conflicts from science advisory boards and replacing them with industry employees.
Meanwhile, #EPA career staff have been excluded from meetings.  When they do participate, they are apparently blocked from bringing phones and even pen and paper with them.
While we know the #AdministratorPruitt has wasted more than $58,000 of taxpayer money on private jets and noncommercial flights, Mr. Pruitt’s schedule has been largely kept secret, and this week a major newspaper had to sue the agency for access to this important public record.
The #EPA under Administrator Pruitt has consistently failed to respond to Congressional oversight requests.  In the few instances when we have actually received responses, they are perfunctory, at best.
This Morning at an @EnergyCommerce hearing I’m questioning #EPA administrator #ScottPruitt on the administration’s lack of transparency and cooperation. #EPA
