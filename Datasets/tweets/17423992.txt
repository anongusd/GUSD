Thanks for inviting me! @RoyScranton @PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav
@GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton They weren't looking
@RoyScranton @GhoshAmitav I am still hopeful. On some days. Still believe there can be good, unpredictable events
@GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton Very much so. But as so visible now in a human time frame, could just write abt course of 1 drought, 1 life
@PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton Wow! But no, don't see that happening under capitalism. Tho will be loans + aid
Last chance #climateliteraturepolitics https://t.co/D0AN3faY2m
@PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton As a former resident, think Delhi needs quick relief for air + global economy needs carbon tax
@biswatosh @PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton Yes &amp; cd encourage shift to renewables
@biswatosh @PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav So they say. &amp; for some. But as with any disruption, real fears for most vulnerable people
@GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton Such a divide still btween arts &amp; sciences. Lots of fear of science among writers &amp; artists too
1 thing abt Kingsolver is climate change is in present &amp; in US. The future is here. That's critical https://t.co/34qBbWjyjc
@biswatosh @PenguinIndia @GhoshAmitav That is THE human rights issue of our time, IMO
@GhoshAmitav @PenguinIndia @RoyScranton See that a little in the idea of 'artisanal' food, 'heirloom' vegetables, Etsy, but not explicit
@Postgenetic @GhoshAmitav @RoyScranton But is complexity an excuse? Shouldn't be. Not insurmountable #climateliteraturepolitics
2/2 China land purchases in Africa, for example, is a climate hedge https://t.co/K2utdGcUW6

@GhoshAmitav @PenguinIndia @RoyScranton &amp; yet w/ urbanisation how many see nature's power? Episodic,in big storms #climateliteraturepolitics
@RoyScranton @GhoshAmitav Shouldn't. But such a big mind shift. Also urbanisation - how many of us really see Nature's power?
@GhoshAmitav absolutely #climateliteraturepolitics
@GhoshAmitav Love idea in book abt shrinking of our imaginations w/ 19thC belief of humans' mastery over nature #climateliteraturepolitics
