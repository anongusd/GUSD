#CBSAllAccess - why should I pay and extra $10/mo for you?  It's called "All Access" and when I tried to watch (access) Survivor on demand - 3 hours after it was aired on regular TV - I couldn't.  How is that better than regular old on Demand from my local provider??  It's not.
@CBSAllAccess I just cancelled.  Why would I pay $9.99/mo to NOT be able to watch my favorite show?  It is almost midnight and Survivor aired at 8pm.  I cannot watch it it on a channel I am paying and extra $10 a month to...on top of my cable bill?  No thank you
@CBS How is it that I pay for CBS Full Access - but cannot watch the latest episode of Survivor on Demand?  It's 11 pm on Wednesday.  The show already aired.  I pay you extra - on top of what I already pay for cable...and I can't watch the show?!!

It took me 10 years to talk about it to a therapist.  20 years to tell my best girlfriends.  and now 30 to come public.  It changed my life forever.  My whole life trajectory.   #BelieveSurvivors
I woke up to him on top of me - raping me. I tried to fight him off.  I couldn't. He was a big football player. The next day I had bruises on my thighs. I didn't tell anyone, because I thought it was my fault.  My fault for being drunk and putting myself in that position.
I made out with lots of boys - willingly.  by my choice.  But, there was this one.. who didn't listen or care about what I wanted.  He didn't like that I said 'no.'  He raped me.  On my 17th birthday.  I had gone out with my girlfriends and done shots to celebrate...I passed out.
Remember the movies?  16 Candles?  If a girl liked to drink and party - she was 'asking for it,' and to be passed around.   And you expect somebody to come out and talk about sexual assault in that era?  Uh. Nope.    I was in school in the 80's.  I drank too much.
Let's all remember the 80's shall we?  Everything was in excess.  Our outfits, our hair, our drinking...cocaine was being introduced. It was nuts.  We were stupid. Anyone who lived it knows this!  To deny it is ridiculous.    A very different culture.
