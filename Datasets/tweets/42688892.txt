@JeffFlake Citing the report and explaining that "we've seen no additional corroborating information" means you've read testimony comprising ~20% of potential witnesses. This was your moment to ensure the integrity of the process and the Court itself. Instead you've found "cover"
@SenatorCollins Saying "it appears to be a very thorough investigation" is akin to an attempt to deceive the American people. If an incomplete investigation with at least 40 uninterviewed witnesses isn't enough, what about Trump's campaign promise to install anti-Roe justices?
The investigation isn't allowed to interview Ford, Kavanaugh, or at least 3 dozen other witnesses.
