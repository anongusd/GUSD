@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is right about 1 thing. Firing Comey &amp;  the insane comments Trump made about Comey in the Oval Office to the Russian delegation insured that Trump &amp; Friends would be investigated for obstruction &amp; conspiracy.  Thank Russia for that tape. No Americans present?WHY?

@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Border Security. 	Not a wall.	Homeland Security and Pentagon tested @realDonaldTrump walls and found them totally inadequate.

@realDonaldTrump Pouring in through legal ports of entry.  90% of the drugs, human trafficking come through legal ports by car, sea and air. 50% of all undocumented immigrants are people who came here legally and have overstayed their visas. It is so appalling @realDonaldTrump to exploit facts.
