Today Senate votes on min. wage boost &amp; shared services, Assembly takes bus tour of Sandy damage &amp; @GovChristie enjoys his 70% approval rate
@Elaijuh yeah, his unfavorables among Dems dropped 30 points, from 68% pre-Sandy to 38% after. But still some Dems who aren't charmed :)
Meanwhile @CoryBooker will live on food stamps and Newark City Council mtg turned into near-riot when Booker showed up to help appoint ally
Wow. New Rutgers-Eagleton poll shows @GovChristie approval ratings at 49 percent among Dems and 70 percent among unaffiliated reg. voters
@Elaijuh poll was of more than 1,200 NJ residents with a subsample of just over 1,000 registered voters. I'll have to look in the poll weeds
GOP might be twisted up about Christie-Obama "love fest," but 81% of those polled said the 2 showed "needed cooperation &amp; bipartisanship."

min wage bill passes 7-6. goes to Senate for final vote
GOP Sens. beseech Sweeney to work with them, phase in wage increase. Sweeney says not w/o CPI. "Sometimes there's not that sweet spot."
Sen. Beck said she would've been inclined to support the min. wage but for Sandy. Bad timing to put that on businesses now, she said.

RT @adamrbauer: @joellefarrell that was never the offer. Offers ranged between $8.00 to $8.50 (sen Pennacchio).
Sen. Sweeney is not budging on CPI. Speaker Oliver said earlier that GOP offers to compromise (raising wage $0.25  to $7.50) are "insulting"

In a $31.6 billion budget, these kind of shortfalls aren't catastrophic, a Treasury source says. But does it hurt @GovChristie politically?
Spokesman for @GovChristie says May rev. shortfall is "a manageable $28.9 million" across the 3 big rev. fronts.
Corporate business tax collections have grown 1.8 % so far this year, would have to grow 15% in June to reach @GovChristie 's numbers.
Sales tax revs have grown 2.4 % so far this year. Would have to grow 8.3% to meet @GovChristie 's budget figures.
NJ revenues still down in May, according to OLS. Sales tax revs 2.3 % below last May. Additional $50 - $100 million hole in 2012 budget.
