@noahmiller64 @sean_freda We accept asylum seekers for geopolitical reasons - not just a moral debate. The President may change policy but that's just not wise in the long or short term.
@noahmiller64 @sean_freda Depending on the country of origin and the country a migrant enters, they have a right to seek asylum. Any state in the picture could choose not to take an asylum but that‚Äôs not at all practiced by moral states. And the US accepts asylum seekers because of a moral human right.

@MattLevinson @ColeKennelly I agree, I really don't see much of a difference between ETFs and crypto assets. 		I prefer ETFs for commodities myself. 		One was started by Blackrock, while the other random people, devs, and entrepreneurs.
@MattLevinson @ColeKennelly These are good questions that financial institutions need to workout for themselves. Blockchain is a tech that can be used for storing value, but that just one use case. Integration of a private blockchain to a public blockchain is what I believe is the important part for trust.
@MattLevinson @ColeKennelly It doesn't necessarily. If the private blockchain is designed to have a contract that verifies the quantity of gold one party has, the buyer can pay and have a smart contact execute the transaction with greater trust. While reducing the # of middle men to access the market.
Blockchain can help with that. https://t.co/7GIFZ4StSR
