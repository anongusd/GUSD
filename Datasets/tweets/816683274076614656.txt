Infanticide is just wrong. Period. Infanticide should never be a partisan issue, but tonight some of my colleagues voted to allow born-alive babies to senselessly die. If a baby survives an abortion, they should be given a fighting chance to live.
Tonight the Senate failed to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors-Protection Act.  Anyone who voted against this legislation voted against providing medical care to babies born alive after failed abortions.  Voting against this bill is simply heartless and immoral.
The Senate just voted on legislation to defend babies who survive abortions. I voted to condemn infanticide &amp; grant every baby who survives an abortion the same level of care any newborn would receive. https://t.co/KiccTrSOqY

RT @WWLAMFM: Sen. Kennedy files bill in an effort to stop the feds from paying dead people https://t.co/X4dNpD2kj4
This morning I talked about my new bill, which I like to call the Stop Paying Dead People Act with @FoxBusiness. The federal government is paying between $10-20 billion a year to dead people. Obviously, there‚Äôs fraud. You know what‚Äôs being done about it? Nothing. https://t.co/a3ezqI3hqe
Tune in to @FoxBusiness right now to hear me discuss my new bill, the Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased People Act. It‚Äôs pretty simple: Don‚Äôt pay dead people.
Did you know that the @SocialSecurity Administration made $9.8 billion in improper payments in 2015? That‚Äôs why I introduced a bill with @SenatorCarper called the Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased People Act. https://t.co/pNeOkNxjeX
Did you know that an Algiers woman was just indicted for collecting almost $300,000 in @SocialSecurity payments meant for her mother who‚Äôs been dead for nearly 10 years? That's why @SenatorCarper and I introduced the Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased People Act. https://t.co/M2eUAxRPbO
