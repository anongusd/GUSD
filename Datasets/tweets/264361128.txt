Factually incorrect. According to many studies (including the Guttmacher Institute), less than 10% of late term abortions are because of health issues with the mother or baby. Conversely, 90% of late term abortions are done for convenience. https://t.co/lKL9NS4N05

@Twerps65 @andrewklavan Rude!
@PatriotRLR @andrewklavan Maybe other Repubs were, but I've maintained all along that Trump was coming out a winner in the shutdown &amp; negotiations because Dems were showing their true nasty colors.

Another good point. It didn't stop Obama from executive overreach with DACA, right? Doesn't make it right for GOP now. PLUS, Congress has power to rebuke Nat Emergs - which is why it's incumbent on US to make sure we elected a Congress who will rebuke overreach of Dems in future. https://t.co/96UmPCp3tw
Great question &amp; I get that point. But when you dive into the content of other declarations of nat emergency, they don't circumvent Congress. They were after 9/11, or during swine flu pandemic, or denying property to terrorists. I don't trust Dems not to abuse this in the future. https://t.co/IXWdHOmk9w
@katzman_jerry @andrewklavan Agree 100% that Congress has demonstrated they're terrible at their jobs &amp; unwilling to secure the border to keep ppl safe. We should hold them accountable.

@stevehayden2 Haha I promise I let him speak first!!! I was responding to what he said. Right, @andrewklavan??
Totally get that &amp; agree. We are 100% in agreement that we NEED a border wall &amp; security. We cannot allow Dems to play politics with people's lives.

Nearly every one of these Democratic politicians has falsely accused Republicans of being racists, bigots &amp; hateful. Yet ALL these Democrats celebrated, endorsed &amp; participated in the Women's March which was founded on anti-Semitism. And none of these Democrats have condemned it.
üëâSen. Kamala Harris spoke at the Women's March.		üëâHillary Clinton called the March "powerful" &amp; thanked them for standing up for "our values."		üëâNancy Pelosi spoke at this year's (2018) Women's March (ie. after info about the anti-Semitism of the March leaders was well known).
üëâSen. Dianne Feinstein promoted the Women's March on Twitter &amp; told people where to find their local march.		üëâSen. Claire McCaskill took selfies of herself in the crowd marching.		üëâAnd so did Sen. Tim Kaine (already forgot about him after 2016, didn't you?)
üëâSen. Amy Klobuchar praised the momentum from the Women's March for helping Democrats stymie GOP healthcare legislation.		üëâDNC Chair Tom Perez (remember: he's supposed to be the face of the Democratic party) attended the 2018 Women's March.
üëâElizabeth Warren spoke at the Women's March.		üëâCory Booker claimed the Women's March wasn't partisan (ha!)		üëâJohn Kerry took to the streets &amp; protested with the pink hate brigade.		üëâSo did Michael Moore.
üëâBeto O'Rourke created a FB event called "Beto Marching with Women" in support of the 2018 Dallas Women's March.		üëâBernie Sanders planned to give the keynote speech at the Women's March convention (until ironically, they canceled on his because he's white &amp; male)
üëâNY Senator Kirsten Gillibrand: "The Women‚Äôs March was the most inspiring &amp; transformational moment I‚Äôve ever witnessed in politics. It happened because four extraordinary women‚ÄîTamika Mallory, Bob Bland, Carmen Perez &amp; Linda Sarsour‚Äîhad the courage to take on something big..."
Conservatives warned long ago that Women's March founders were rabidly anti-Semitic &amp; tied to Louis Farrakhan. New Tablet Mag report confirms anti-Semitism was part of FOUNDING of march.		So here's a list of Dem politicians who praised Women's March (&amp; haven't condemned it). üëáüëá

@dawnlaguens You're supposed to be an expert in birth control. Many birth control pills are two part: ovulation suppressing &amp; also endometrial thinning (if conception occurs) to prevent baby from implanting. That second part is abortion. You know this, Dawn.
@ElishaKrauss I preferred Amy Coney Barrett. But Kavanaugh is better than Merrick Garland or a hog-tied court, so I'll take him. And he's certainly not the radical the left paints him to be.
@conservmillen Yay! Happy Anniversary to you both!!!!! üíòüíòüíò
I love how every time the left drops a bomb on Kavanaugh it just ends up proving to everybody what a great, thoughtful guy Kavanaugh is.

Can the left point to a particular ruling in Kavanaugh‚Äôs 12 years on the D.C. circuit that is Constitutionally troubling? Or inappropriate judicial activism? Or evidence that Kavanaugh is politically corrupt? Or simply a bad jurist?
In a nutshell, the left just wants a Supreme Court Justice who will oppose everything President Trump does... even though that is not the role of the Judiciary.
The lib protesters at Kavanaugh hearing are just a reminder that Democrats don't have any arguments of substance against him... or they'd say so. So instead, they throw temper tantrums because Trump nominated him instead of Hillary.

In 2018, the NIH spent $103 MILLION taxpayer dollars on human fetal tissues research. In other words, $103 MILLION of our tax dollars were spent on aborted baby body parts. This doesn't even include was the FDA itself spent on this.
According to CNS, "At a workshop sponsored by  NIH‚Äî‚ÄúNew Humanized Rodent Model Workshop‚Äù‚Äîa federally funded scientist described a type of humanized mouse given a human immune system by implanting it with ‚Äúhuman fetal liver &amp; thymus‚Äù taken from babies 20-24 weeks gestational age."
The FDA refused to answer CNSNews when they asked "hold old are the fetuses" used? Our tax money buys the aborted babies, but the FDA won't tell the taxpayers what age baby we're buying.
$15,900 of taxpayer money is being used to pay Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) for aborted baby body parts. ABR gets their aborted baby body parts from Planned Parenthood (&amp; other abortion clinics).
This is truly horrifying. Aborted baby body parts are being injected into laboratory mice, and it's all funded with OUR tax money! https://t.co/OrUHwCQNj6

@michaelianblack The idea of our justice system isn't revenge. It's to restore order &amp; protect ppl's rights. I favor penalizing abortionists. I don't think it'd serve our society well to penalize women. This Q tho is usually a deflection of what right we have to abort unborn babies at any stage?
@michaelianblack We have to establish right/wrong before we can enact a just penalty, right? So we have to establish when life begins &amp; what right we have to end life before we "restore order" in our justice system when it's violated. I dont favor punishing women. I favor penalizing abortionists.
@michaelianblack Viability argument is flawed bc it's up to OUR limited medical knowledge... when WE are able to keep baby alive outside womb. And it get earlier as our medical progress advances. What actually changes about the unborn baby before/after "viability" that makes one a baby &amp; one not?
@michaelianblack What is this if it's not a human? https://t.co/nHI7f57pGp
@michaelianblack If we agree with science that a human life begins at conception, what else would that developing baby (at all the stages) be other than a human person? What right do we have to kill a human life?
@michaelianblack Was driving. ;) What medical textbook says a new human life begins at any other time than conception? 41 of the textbooks they use in medical school &amp; the U.S. govt's National Institute of Health say a new human life is formed the moment of conception.
No, I'm generally against the death penalty. But I'm pro-science. This comes down to when does life begin? Science says at conception. If life begins at conception, what right do we have to kill the life of unborn babies? https://t.co/KN6FiwHixU

Did you even research the law before you parroted liberal talking points? Trump did not make the law requiring separation. What Trump did was enforce the law (prosecution) of people who illegally jump our border. Nobody likes separation law! Why won't Democrats help change it? https://t.co/g0lIkbuV2D
@TheRealOVA Because he didn't make the law requiring separation, but he's trying to fix it.
@stealthygeek That's a false analogy &amp; you know it. Trump didn't make the law requiring separation of parents &amp; kids. He's enforcing the law (as he's supposed to as Chief Executive) to prosecute people who break our law &amp; cross our border. The separation doctrine from 1997 should be changed.
@wantsomepudding Valid. ;)
@DaveG_55 I have an issue with Democrats in Congress not helping solve this problem. I have an issue with Democrats using these poor kids as political hostages to try to attack Trump.
@celticrose111 Just clarify for me. When you said "his own mess" do you mean prosecuting people who illegally cross our border? If you don't want them prosecuted, do you want them allowed illegally into our country no questions asked?
What are you talking about? I think the law is bad &amp; we should change the law. That's what I said. I'm glad Trump is addressing it, and why are Democrats glad Trump is fixing this? https://t.co/NdwmrOOn4t
Do libs not even READ law before parroting Dem talking points?! Let me simplify for you.		- If you jump our border, you can be prosecuted	- Obama didnt, Trump is	- You cant hold kids more than 20 days	- These are laws ON OUR BOOKS	- If u don't like law, agree with GOP &amp; change it

@EdKrassen See that's the thing: you don't think the President should enforce security at our border. You Democrats are okay with illegal aliens jumping our borders with no consequences. At least you're admitting your open borders agenda!
@krassenstein It's law to separate parents &amp; kids when parents are prosecuted for a crime (illegal border crossing). Also against the law to hold kids for more than 20 days. Has been since 1997. It's not complicated, Brian. Dems are just desperate to hack Trump, they don't want him to solve it
@EdKrassen Enforcing the law is the President's job. The law prohibiting detention of children for more than 20 days was already on the books (since 1997). You know this, Ed. You don't need me to tell you.
If Democrats are sincere in their outrage about kids separated from their parents at the border, they'll applaud an executive order from Trump.		If Dems don't applaud Trump, we know they never cared about a solution.

@EggerTWS Democrats should do better, I agree.
Democrats don't want to fix issues at detention centers at the border.		They want kids to cry.		The more kids cry, the more Dems think they win in eyes of Americans.		Winning political points is what Dems really care about.		THAT's why they won't support GOP bill that fixes this.

@conservmillen Right, I think it's media portraying it way. Assuming same-sex attraction = homosexual lifestyle. Now, I wasn't there to hear the Pope, but he doesn't have authority to condone sin, so if he DID say gay marriage or sex outside marriage was ok... he's wrong, per Catholic teaching.
@conservmillen I think liberals are just twisting the headlines to make it seem like Pope Francis gave a thumbs up to a homosexual lifestyle. Which he did not.
@conservmillen I get what you're saying, but God did make us with the capacity to sin so that our free will renders us with the choice to love God or succumb sin (in hopes we would choose to return His love). Our propensity to sin (whatever cross we bear) IS part of how God made us.
@conservmillen Same-sex attraction is not a sin, according to Catholic teaching. Sexual activity outside marriage between one man &amp; one woman is a sin.
@conservmillen God made you this way &amp; loves you like this?
If you're shocked about Pope Francis's comments on God loving gay people, then you haven't studied Catholic teaching. That IS &amp; always has been Catholic doctrine.
FYI what Pope Francis said about being gay isn't shocking.		That's Catholic teaching.		The Catholic church doesn't condemn people with same-sex attraction.		They simply teach that sex is part of the marriage covenant &amp; marriage is between one man &amp; one woman.		God loves everyone.

ALSO: the number of the people in my timeline calling me an idiot for standing up for Alfie Evans' right to life... is EXACTLY why I don't want ANYBODY but me &amp; my family making decisions about my healthcare.
The number of British people in my timeline arguing that it's perfectly a-okay for the UK to force Alfie Evans to die... is sickening.
You're proving my point. You're literally arguing WHY the British govt has a right to force a child to die. I get it - British law allows it.  DOESN'T THAT HORRIFY YOU?!!		I'm shocked you don't think this kind of "legal" murder is abominable &amp; a violation of basic human rights. https://t.co/TzX8u3NK4A
Does any "power" in your country have the right to deny a baby his right to life? https://t.co/JWppKwBI07
Wrong. Walk into an ER anywhere in the US, you won't be denied emerg care just because you can't pay for it. It's funny that a govt run system like the UK claimed they'd be "better" when money doesn't factor into it, now denying care to a baby when money has nothing to do with it https://t.co/WKaHeARDjA
My "medical care agenda" is the right to life for me &amp; every person.		If it's "exploiting" this tragedy to stand up for Alfie's right to life - then hell yeah I'm exploiting. https://t.co/eHvbsbp3lL
Please, Tony, if I have these facts wrong, tell me what is really happening. Tell me why Alfie's father doesn't simply take Alfie &amp; leave the hospital? Who is stopping him? Who forced the removal of Alfie's life support &amp; oxygen? Who refused to feed Alfie &amp; why? https://t.co/1hSAJ6wNyn
Wrong. A judge mandated Alfie Evans be removed from life support. Police blocked Alfie's father from taking him to Italy. 		This is what happens when *govt* runs healthcare. They have power over people's life &amp; death. https://t.co/azRWGgfnrv
I mean... I don't disagree... https://t.co/5vDvSZIvYj
If you're more outraged about bogus Ronny Jackson allegations than about Alfie Evans being murdered by the British govt... I don't know a more diplomatic way to say it... you're a monster.
Remember when libs said ‚Äúgovt death panel‚Äù rhetoric was right wing paranoia?		üëáüëá		The British govt pulled life support from Alfie Evans, against his parents' wishes.		The govt removed oxygen.		They won't feed him.		The judge said "there is virtually nothing of his brain left."

Do double standards - where people of one political party are treated differently under the law than people from another political party - not bother you? https://t.co/I11sVgg2oi
3) Whether or not Cohen did something wrong (he may have), the double standards here are STRIKING. Hillary Clinton's lawyer Cheryl Mills was not treated this way. Her home was not raided. Her phone was no seized. Instead, she was given IMMUNITY.
2) Obama's 2008 campaign committed campaign finance law violations. Like, $3.2 MILLION dollars worth. Were they prosecuted? Nope. Did you even hear about it? Probably not, because the media didn't care since it wasn't Trump.
What the media is conveniently forgetting about the Cohen raid.		1) Of course the Michael Cohen raid is because of Mueller's probe. Cohen was named in the unverified Steele dossier. That's why Mueller was looking at him in the first place.

What news story do you care most about today?
In the context of the times &amp; the usage of "well regulated" - the phrase indicates the freedom of the people to self-regulate or organize themselves individually or with others, as militia. https://t.co/zzGVfpyZ3P
But the 2nd amend says the right to keep &amp; bear arms is retained BY THE PEOPLE. Not the federal govt. Not the state govt. By the PEOPLE. You know... individuals. https://t.co/zzGVfpyZ3P
If the founders meant STATE militias only (and not individuals' rights), why didn't they say so? https://t.co/zzGVfpyZ3P
The point of the 2nd amend was to provide defense to citizens against a tyrannical standing army... so why would the Founders give the same govt that controlled the army power to control individuals' right to bear arms to defend themselves against such a govt? https://t.co/zzGVfpyZ3P
Looking at the context of the time when the 2nd Amend was written... well regulated "by the federal govt" would have been contradictory to the entire point of the 2nd Amend "being necessary to a free state" that distrusted national govt (and for good reason). https://t.co/zzGVfpyZ3P
Hi @piersmorgan, where did the Founding Fathers EVER write or indicate that 2nd Amend wasn't intended to include individuals' right to bear arms? Or that well-regulated militia excludes individuals?

When it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, a disciple of Jesus, went to Pilate &amp; asked for the body of Jesus; Pilate ordered it be handed over. Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen &amp; laid it in his new tomb he had hewn in the rock. -Matthew 27:57-60
The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus feared greatly when they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, and they said, ‚ÄúTruly, this was the Son of God!‚Äù - Matthew 27:54
But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit. And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. - Matthew 27:50-52
From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And about three o‚Äôclock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, ‚ÄúEli, Eli, lema sabachthani?‚Äù which means, ‚ÄúMy God, my God, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù - Matthew 27:45-46 https://t.co/RWk4K1pk9r
And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of the Skull), they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall. But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink. After they had crucified him, they divided his garments by casting lots. - Matthew 27:33-35
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him off to crucify him. - Matthew 27-31
Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head. Kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, ‚ÄúHail, King of the Jews!‚Äù They spat upon him &amp; took the reed &amp; kept striking him on the head. - Matthew 27:29-30
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak about him. - Matthew 27:27-28
Pilate said to them, ‚ÄúThen what shall I do with Jesus called Messiah?‚Äù They all said, ‚ÄúLet him be crucified!‚Äù But he said, ‚ÄúWhy? What evil has he done?‚Äù They only shouted the louder, ‚ÄúLet him be crucified!‚Äù - Matthew 27:22-23
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus. The governor said to them in reply, ‚ÄúWhich of the two do you want me to release to you?‚Äù They answered, ‚ÄúBarabbas!‚Äù - Matthew 27:20-21
Now on the occasion of the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished. - Matthew 27:15
Now Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him, ‚ÄúAre you the king of the Jews?‚Äù Jesus said, ‚ÄúYou say so.‚Äù And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer. - Matthew 27:11-12
When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. - Matthew 27:1-2

So you're saying a MASS MURDERER was still able to kill many children EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BANNED GUNS? *gasp* https://t.co/BDPsBJ95sz
Funny, how anti-gun leftists hurl harsher insults at ME (idiot, manipulator, cretin, vile, vigilante, clueless, dickhead, etc.) than at the killer who murdered 17 in Parkland.
Parents, beware. https://t.co/TaXSZgFLgm
Typical liberal. Hurls ad hominem attacks because he has no facts or policy proposals. Nothing I haven't seen before. Move along, sir. https://t.co/PWb7gEymzv

It's like CNN has a policy to cheat at townhalls.		"Hey Hillary, you want to see your questions ahead of time?" "No, Colton, you're a student from Parkland but you can't ask the question you want, here's a scripted one."		And the mainstream media wonders why we call them biased.

Oh. That's what I thought. You're completely ignorant about gun control. Do some research on Chicago &amp; Baltimore. Then come back &amp; tell me how restricting legal gun ownership in the U.S. impacts crime &amp; violence. https://t.co/c2Z5C89Q5V
Just because you think it doesn't make it accurate. Do you have evidence &amp; stats that in the U.S., banning guns lowers crime &amp; violence? https://t.co/a3E8LdtYO4
You don't think it's worth studying the social &amp; behavioral impact of kids from broken homes &amp; mental health? Why a majority of mass shooters in the U.S. have had absent fathers? Why suicide rate of kids with absent fathers is twice as high? Whether it correlates to homicide? https://t.co/Es5xsjTW8u

Hi @afneil, research can help prevent you from making a fool of yourself. Here, I helped. Violent crime rates in the UK in the past year:		68,968 robbery offences, up 29%	138,045 sex offences, up 23%	37,443 knife crime offences, up 21%	1,291,405 violent crime offences, up 20% https://t.co/mLVQtlI75t

My 8 ideas to solve gun violence.		- Abolish gun free zones	- Arm teachers	- Hire armed security guards	- If you see something, say something	- Gun violence restraining orders	- Call out absent fathers	- Study impact of psych drugs	- Learn from history: banning guns doesn't work
