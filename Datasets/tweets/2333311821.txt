@iluvchico3 @BernieSanders I'm for nationwide health coverage and I said if u have kids ur guaranteed at least 15$ an hour if u work for certain companies (most companies) and I also said if there are extenuating circumstances u can apply for $15 an hour minimum so what are u even saying?

@CjFraud I agree with that, but if people aren't willing to try to better their situations I don't think they deserve a $15 an hour base pay, I've seen too many people get a low paying job and become comfortable doing nothing with their lives
@Ravenhuguenot @BernieSanders This type of mentality is dangerous
@BernieSanders Not everyone deserves 15$ an hour for working anywhere
I don't think people under 30 yrs old, unless they have kids or don't have family (or maybe other extenuating circumstances), then they don't need to make at least $15 an hour for working anywhere, thoughts? https://t.co/sbzuLSf58K

@GracieNunyabiz @debriley1997 @wilma7771 @tnacgal @TN_SillyMan @VoteMarsha @JGraceShannon @GOPatUTK @TeamTNCR @MemphisRepubli1 @TNGOP @GOPChairwoman Yes deflecting, from the real issues like homelessness and climate change, and listen to what your doctors say about abortion, YOUR doctors, not your politicians doctors #GREENNEWDEAL #GreenNewDeal
