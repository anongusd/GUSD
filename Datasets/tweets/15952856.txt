This is 2nd time in 2 weeks federal court has told Brian Kemp to stop suppressing votes. “The Court does not understand how assuring all eligible voters are permitted to vote undermines integrity of the election process” https://t.co/pbrP4rLZUU
Imagine becoming a US citizen, going to cast a ballot in your first election &amp; being turned away from the polls even though you brought proof of citizenship. That's what happened to Yotam Oren in Georgia https://t.co/O6Z4qQXXRO https://t.co/XIFrQJzOcc
Brian Kemp blocked over 3,000 naturalized US citizens from registering to vote:		27% Asian-American		17% Latino		Only 14% white		More clear evidence of voter suppression in Georgia 	https://t.co/O6Z4qQXXRO https://t.co/SK0L0jwg3x
Big victory for voting rights: federal court rules thousands of naturalized US citizens in Georgia wrongly blocked from registering by Brian Kemp must be allowed to vote in 2018, citing “a very substantial risk of disenfranchisement” https://t.co/O6Z4qQXXRO
Breaking: federal judge rules naturalized US citizens who've been blocked from registering in Georgia must be allowed to vote. This affects over 3,000 voters with registrations put on hold by Brian Kemp. Big victory for voting rights via @LawyersComm &amp; @CampaignLegal lawsuit https://t.co/URe9AnLhkE

More than 1,200 ballots rejected in Kansas because of Kris Kobach’s voter ID law since he became secretary of state. Kobach won primary by 350 votes. Kobach overseeing his own election like Brian Kemp &amp; Dems warning election could be “stolen” https://t.co/xerzsvdkfU
.@JeffreyToobin said on CNN last night Kobach “has devoted his career to stopping black people and poor people from voting”		He’s right. Kansas voter ID law led to 2% decrease in turnout in 2012, with largest drop-off among black, young &amp; new voters https://t.co/7q5kL9zlrn
@JoyAnnReid I think with Kobach it's all of the above!
A 59 year old black man in Wichita was told to pay for his birth certificate if he wanted to vote in Kansas. Voters are routinely charged for "free ID" under Kris Kobach's voter ID law. “It’s absolutely a modern day poll tax” says @votermolly of @aclu https://t.co/sVrDwPVFyc
Jessica Jones of Wichita made 7 trips to different government agencies trying to get voter ID &amp; eventually had to pay $22 for “free ID.” She called it a poll tax.

"Of the most common voter suppression tactics studied this year by US Commission on Civil Rights--voter ID laws, proof of citizenship requirements, purges, cuts in early voting &amp; polling places closures--GA is only state once under federal oversight to have adopted all five." https://t.co/kGtcViivd2
107,000 people have been purged by Kemp for not voting, making voting a "use it or lose it" right. "In 6 of every 10 counties across Georgia, black voters were canceled at a higher rate than their white peers for inactivity" @apmreports https://t.co/zv0r0dh6zj
Kemp's office responsible for one of largest data breaches of any state, releasing 6.2 million voters’ Social Security numbers, addresses &amp; driver’s license numbers. He's also done nothing to safeguard GA's electronic voting machines with no paper backups https://t.co/xmPeJGoq8a
Kemp blocked 34,874 voter registrations in 2016, 75% were non-white. African Americans submitted 29.4 percent of voter registration applications but were 63.6 percent of rejections.

Kavanaugh will join most extreme court since Jim Crow &amp; roll back fundamental rights for millions of Americans. This is what's at stake here https://t.co/4vzHAUtm8z
Republicans sided with the perpetrator over the victim, with a cover-up over an FBI investigation, with a partisan operative over an independent Justice. This decision will haunt America for the next 30-40 years

The trial ended with the judge considering whether to hold Kobach in contempt of court for refusing to properly register voters in Kansas. "I made it clear they’re fully registered voters,” she told him, pounding her desk for emphasis https://t.co/PFO0xRbsj3
The judge, a George W. Bush appointee, repeatedly lectured Kobach on "Evidence 101" and told him "We’re not going to have a trial by ambush here.” https://t.co/HdQIEwbeQw
Kobach found only 5 cases of non-citizens voting over 2 decades, but blocked 35,000 eligible voters from registering. When Kobach said fraud claims were "tip of the iceberg" ACLU responded "The iceberg, on close inspection, Your Honor, it’s more of an ice cube.” https://t.co/sYtNezHtZ1
Another expert hired by Kobach created list of alleged non-citizen voters based on "foreign" sounding names. He was asked if he would flag "Carlos Murguia" as foreign. He said yes. ACLU attorney @dale_e_ho said Murguia was federal judge at Kansas courthouse https://t.co/WLHL2q5tbZ
