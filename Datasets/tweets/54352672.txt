@broomheadshow Never downplayed a very serious situation with shooter. It's scary bad. Stand by what I said about presser.

@DonnaDiva Agree that all speech is subject to criticism. Big difference between active criticism of an opinion and silencing a voice.
@jasdye Is it "dumbnuts" or "numbnuts"? Not really sure. Also, silencing a voice, no matter how much you disagree with it, is violence.
@DonnaDiva You see, we studied Voltaire at Iola Frans Elementary. And I believe in what he said!
@DonnaDiva And I would also fight for a Liberal against those who tried to silence them.
@DonnaDiva No, you reverted to discrediting the messenger with a lie.You said I defended Trump. No, I defended his right to be ignorant.
@LaXicanista I know. Sad, isn't it?
@DonnaDiva Thx for providing a perfect example to prove my point.
@roddmcleod @DonnaDiva @cscutari PC Police on nearly every college campus in U.S.  Y hay mas.
@stateofthecity Ignorant ideas die by the sword of truth. We too often focus on the messenger and not the message.
@stateofthecity To paraphrase Mark Twain, the more some people open their mouth, the less doubt there is they are ignorant.
@stateofthecity My point exactly. Protest and speak out. Present a better idea. But in this PC world, we too often seek to silence.
@DonnaDiva @roddmcleod @cscutari I'm sure the Donald can fend for himself. But the same approach is used against non-billionaires too.
@stateofthecity A very fine line. Bullying people into submission does not stop bad ideas. It just drives them underground.
@stateofthecity Efforts to keep him from speaking at a public facility is not censorship? And yes, shutting down is silencing.
A day at the beach has convinced me there is serious demand and career opportunities in tattoo artistry. ✏️🈲
.@realDonaldTrump is ignorant and what he said was offensive to many, but the efforts to silence him should be offensive to all.

The slide by GB defender after interception good example of a "prevent" mentality.
Green Bay once again proving why it's stupid to go into "prevent" defense and "milk the click" offense.  Makes teams tentative.

Proposed question for new Civics Test given to AZ HS students: What does AZ Const say about State's obligation in re higher ed?
@bmilli24 Could be how most bills or ordinances are "discussed." Too funny. Thanks.
How many have read and understand AZ Const and their City Charters? These are forgotten basics of our form of government.
Civics s/b priority, but doesn't Citizenship Test focus on Fed Gov? What about our Cons bottom-up view of Federalism? Where are States?
Who ever thought AZ Rep Leg would embrace and implement a high stakes standardized test developed by Fed Govt in AZ schools? 😉
I applaud efforts to raise level of Civics knowledge in schools. 2 important 2 ignore. Should we also require it to serve in AZ Leg? 😊

I love TK, but he doesn't make that TD throw.
I swear the ref was reaching for his flag on that obvious hold right in front of him in the backfield. But, alas, he did not. 😣
Oops! That really, really hurts.
And......that's why Graham made the change. TK was late and long all day.
@charliebrown157 Got it!
#ASU consistently gives up big plays for scores. Is it the scheme, the players, or both?
What can you say: Jaelen Strong is simply amazing! #ASUvsUA #ASU
If any NFL team ever decides to carry a pooch kicker on its roster, Taylor Kelly will have a job.
But #ASU leads FBS in defensive TD's. That's a very good thing. ☺️
I've lost count of the number of times #ASU has failed to score in 4 downs from inside 3 yd line during Todd Graham era. Baffling.

@Lex_et_Libertas 140 characters. Every student deserves a chance to find a career upon graduation.
Look at who has led in times of crisis by balancing budgets and creating jobs. I’m the only candidate with that proven track record. #azgov
@redwildcat just as was said, stood up to fight overbearing EPA regulations.
Leadership is about getting things done. As a mayor,I had to pick up the trash every Thurs.As Pres of @usmayors I repped AZ on a natl stage.
In Mesa, we instituted immigration enforcement policies two years before SB1070 that trained our officers in immigration enforcement. #azgov
No one in this campaign is talking reality about immigration. If it could have been done @GovBrewer absolutely would have done it.
We aren't creating the high paying jobs that our graduating students deserve to walk in to. That's where our focus needs to be. #azgov
We created jobs in times of crisis while closing a $62 million deficit and balancing our budgets. #azgov
We focused on what we did best. HEAT- Healthcare, Education, Aerospace, Tourism, Technology. We can do the same for AZ.
We haven't recovered the jobs we lost in the recession,&amp; the ones we've recovered are lower paid jobs.We must change that-and we did in Mesa

Basic Civics knowledge is as critical for our children's future as science and math. Let's make sure all students learn how freedom works.

Thx to the nearly 700 people who came to my final State of the City. You’ve all been a part of Building a Better Mesa http://t.co/cVCAFqBxlO
In case you missed it this weekend- Apple project named Economic Deal of the Year! Proud of our team. http://t.co/InyYkP3qo7
Building a Better Mesa. Our mantra. Our perspective. A reminder of why we are here. I'm confident that this community will continue to build
These successes are our successes. I have had an amazing team and City Council.
We have set the stage for amazing things to come in this community. There is still much to do, but the foundation has been set.
We have created a government that is efficient, effective, and accountable to its citizens.
Mesa taxpayers pay less today in taxes than the year I took office.
It's kind of fun to do the impossible.-Walt Disney	We've risen to the occasion over the last 5 years.
Technology- Apple. The seeds for Apple coming to Mesa were planted 5 yrs ago. They'll open next month hiring hundreds of new workers.
Technology- @heatsynclabs in downtown, a hackers dream!
Technology- Partnering with @Google to get businesses online. The iMesa initiative and the MyMesa app to report graffiti and potholes.
Technology-Code for America. One of 10 cities in the US. Working to create new innovating technology to connect with the community.
When a community makes it's mind up to get something done, they'll show you how it can happen.
Tourism-The citizens of Mesa overwhelmingly approved the Gaylord resort and to keep the Cubs in Arizona.
Aerospace-we saved AZLabs, a top secret research laboratory &amp; the 1st time the Fed Govt has transferred such a facility to another entity.
Aerospace-we continue to build with partners Boeing, Cessna, Embraer. We worked to keep Able Engineering in Mesa, saving hundreds of jobs.
We took the education foundation we already had and elevated the game. Focused on bringing in new colleges, we recruited 5 new ones to DT.
In Heathcare we've had over a billion dollars in investments in our city. Starting innovative programs like the TRV.
We started out 5 years ago focusing on what we were good at HEATT Healthcare, Education, Aerospace, Tourism, Technology.

You lift people people by attracting high quality jobs, not raising the minimum wage.
We all want people to prosper, the focus on minimum wage jobs seems to lose focus on growing the overall economy.

Wow! It doesn't get any better.  And the Falklands are safe for now. #Masters
What kind of ice do these guys have running in their veins? This is incredible drama.
Now, putting contest.
Chipping contest.
I want Adam Scott to win just to further complicate the debate over long handle putters.
Great year for Argentina. Pope, now Angel. Might be a good time to go after the Falklands. Or the Malvinas, or whatever they call them.
Did you notice how Australian Adam Scott's putt swirled around the cup in the opposite direction as they do in the northern  hemisphere?
I wonder what security would do if a "patron" snuck in and then dared to open a non-Masters official umbrella.

@anthonybwilson Thanks!
@azfarley Lots to do in Mesa still and focused on that. We’ll see what future opportunities bring to replicate the success we’ve had here.
Always looking for more opportunities. RT @joe31337: @Mayor_Smith are there plans to open more colleges east of mesa?
@joe31337 There are unique opportunities for different projects.We have utilized diff options for cos like Crescent Crown&amp;others
@worriedtaxpayer Salaries for the city are paid for through the general fund. There will be no tax increases to pay for them.
@anthonybwilson Thanks Anthony for the support!
General Plan Update question. This will be an opportunity to define a vision for our community over the next 25 yrs. Exciting opportunities.
Pay proposal was brought forth by @MesaChamber &amp; hopefully will set the stage in the future to allow for the best &amp; brightest to serve Mesa.
City Council can only vote yes or no based on commission recommendation. Comm set rates between what Tucson and Tempe pay their councils.
City Charter requires Council to set salaries. Council set up independent commission to look at major factors including peer cities.
Question on council voting on pay raises for council members.
Is there a desire or plan to extend bus service to the east? 	It all comes down to money. Right now, there isn’t funding available to do so.
I look at the definition of it as building a great community where people can go to school,get career ready education,&amp;work &amp; raise a family
Sustainability is a buzz word these days. What does it mean to you?
This was something that was in the bond package.Excited for the completion of these trails &amp; consolidating trail system with Tempe &amp; others.
RT @monteslu: @Mayor_Smith #AskSmith when will contrsuction on the bike trail extension to tempe town lake begin?
Our Federal Govt must get spending in line and be smart about it.	Mayors and Cities made the tough decision with our budgets years ago.
Lots of uncertainty still out there.There would be cuts in services but the bigger concerns are the indirect impacts.
What effect will the fiscal cliff have on the city?
Arizona must spell out its vision on where we want to be and how we are going to get there. We have not done that so far.
No. We cannot be hooked on growth like we have been.We must plan&amp;not fall back into old habits.Easy money does not equate to good government
Question on fiscal restraints. Will we return to the old ways?
Fiesta District will get its mojo back. It’s still is a great location, that’s central with plenty of amenities available.
Fiesta Dist cont $10M set aside for redevelopment options. Govt can’t force activity but we can make it as easy as possible for new invest.
What is being done to attract business to the Fiesta District.	Refurbishments along Southern,setting the stage for private investment (cont)
Update on Eastmark. Lots of activity out there. Nearly 7 square miles where people can live, work, and stay. DMB is a great/quality partner.
Question on Light Rail. Extension to Gilbert Rd is part of the regional plan and will be completed by 2016. Gilbert is a major milestone.
With Frontier Air going to Denver, you literally can fly almost anywhere in the world from @phxmesagateway  w/a connection through Denver.
Question on flights from Gateway.	@AllegiantTravel just added new flights from @phxmesagateway to Provo announced after &gt;year of work.
Very proud that the citizens came up with nearly all of the ideas for the bond projects through the iMesa process.
Riverview Park was already under construction,but will be elevated and made into a regional park. 	Youth facilities likely the next projects
Next question on projects that were approved by voters in this years bond. First projects will start immediately.
Downtown is open for business for entertainment. This district allows more flexibility for a wider range of liquor users.
Next Question on Downtown Entertainment District recently passed by the council.
While we all think we are part of a suburban area, 75% of AZ’s population is considered in an Urban area.
Ecobedo, Encore on 1st Ave, A New Leaf at La Mesita are three new projects that we have broken ground on-all taking advantage of Light Rail
Our goal is to go up higher along rail. We have changed the rules to allow and encourage higher quality urban development.
What are we doing for Transit Oriented Dev. We finished Central Main plan looking at light rail corridor.Working to encourage dynamic devel
This is difficult, esp with a slimmed down budget. One area that we are working in next years budget is to find $ to replace these officers

@jackmcgorr I am as anxious as anybody to build on east. Many hurdles to overcome w/ funding, basic infrastructure, etc. It will happen.
@jackmcgorr $ spent on west side pocket change compared to $ needed on east. West side blgds also designed for easy repurposing.
@jackmcgorr Main challenge with new east side terminal is $$$.  Very big investment. Not a whole lot of spare change floating around now.
@jackmcgorr I understand.  You do the best with what you have. We have a great little airport that will grow as fast as it is able.
@swertel biz access won't be limited only part of time. Work will be on the tracks, not the road. In the end, it will be worth it.
@jackmcgorr We have room to grow on west side. 10 gates when expansion is completed. Can double pass count. Do the best we can.
@jackmcgorr No definite timeline yet. At least a few years away.
@heath_reed Great to hear! It is a great little airport, and we're proud of it!
@newsman26 Big news coming soon as Gateway continues to grow.
@mikeymore84 DT Mesa will develop its own unique urban identity once LT rail is in and operating.

@joe31337 Where are jobs? Gateway area is size of City of Tempe! Rome wasn't built in a day. A bit of patience?
@jackmcgorr On west side or east side? Current west side expansion done next year. New east side built in 5-10 years.
@swertel Maybe so! That time includes all prep work, utility relocation, rebuild of streets, tracks and system test. It's complicated!

Why aren't there more bus lines in East Mesa? Simple answer,we are a very large city&amp;we just don't have the $.State stopped funding transit.

Why are some of the roads so wide? Past effort was to keep them wide. Now our focus is on intersections, which is where bottlenecks are.

Status of a Med School for Site 17 (Univ and Mesa Dr)?Continue to work w/all schools that have shown interest&amp;cont to look for the best fit
How do you decide political endorsements?I look at each situation through the eyes of a Mayor.I look at who would do the most good for Mesa.
Cont-Confident Mesa stacks up compared to other comm &amp; the private sector.Our police &amp; fire agencies have been very helpful in this downturn
Public safety question regarding pay. My goal is to ensure our public safety workers are always adequately compensated for their work.
This program is a unique setup that is attracting questions and interest nationwide.
How many students will the 4 downtown colleges bring to downtown? Possible to have 3,000-5,000 in the next 5 years.Great opportunity for DT!

My city council is united in our goals to Build a Better Mesa. Partnerships w/church,groups,citizens has been amazing and key to success.
Image cont-Mesa's been center of success over last 3 yrs.As part of Conf of Mayors I get to tell ppl about successes.GOP debate is great opp
How are you addressing image prob? One of my priorities is to remind people what makes us great.
Hot Dog Vendors Downtown. Govt tries sometimes to apply regs throughout city. We need to find the right balance that can adapt to needs
Bike paths-We've used various funds to expand trails.Mesa is one of the most bike friendly in US.We're a big city so lots of areas to expand
Eminent Dom cont- We will do everything possible to avoid doing it. Hopeful we won't have to do it in this process.
Light rail and eminent domain.We do not approach properties w/eminent domain.Approach is to work w/owners to buy property for fair price.
iMesa cont-Results could include city executing things, or possibly elections. Benefit is that these ideas are grassroots and citizen driven
Ques on iMesa.This has been a citizen driven process which has made this a very aggressive with big dream.Comm will submit ideas in February
Ques on Obama visit&talking abt pos news.We need leadership to talk about good and bad going on.Recognize bad but celebrate good going on.
Quest regarding Oak A's Spring Train.We have exclusive negotiating rights to bring to Mesa.Very positive negotiations,hope for deal this yr
Ques on AZLabs.First time Fed Gov't has transferred top secret facility.This is huge for Gateway & region.Will take time-endless opportunity
We are working with stakeholders in Fiesta District and @dkavanaugh to get some progress on positive redevelopment.
@monteslu Just need someone to open one! No restrictions on bars or alcohol in Main St.
Ques on Riverview. Economically, it is a success. 2nd highest tax generator in city. We need to improve on areas that are struggling.
Plans to remodel Riverview? Developer opening up Theater District by removing buildings.Improvements should be first of lots of changes.
Successes from first term & improvements needed?We are doing good things,but everything can be improved.Most proud of the tenor of community
Where I like to eat in downtown? Too many places to list them all. Something for everyone! @ilvinaio @delacruzbistro www.downtownmesa.com
Public Safety cont. Mesa recog last week for TRV program. May be a National Model based on our success. Applied for grant to further program
Police support ? from DC.Nat'l pan for Homeland Sec is to partner w/cities.We're there to ensure we're not left w/the bill they're resp for.
Cont- I will be Pres in 2013. The chance to elevate our visibility allows us to show how we are some of the best investors or critical $'s.
What do you do as VP of @usmayors ? Cities are the baseline of econ activity in this country. We get the opportunity to explain that w/Feds
Light Rail cont. Study shows getting to Gilbert expands ridership almost exponentially. South to 60 from there. East using transit corridor.
Question on Light Rail.Prop 400 approved by voters incl rail funding & determined routes.We are working on extending to Gilbert Rd.
Question about @BenU1887 University who is coming downtown.Working on bringing more colleges to #Mesa!
Ques on Waveyard.Great idea,just bad timing w/economy.Never say never to the idea, but it would be in a different location.Contract is over.
I've been going to a lot of ribbon cuttings, so there is growth and new opportunities. Working to bring more to the city though!
Do we have more jobs coming to Mesa?The economy has bottomed out which is good.The recovery is going to be very slow though.

Watching Iowa Caucus results on news nets is hilarious. These guys (and gals) act like this is 7th game of World Series.

LSU, Ok St and CF fans on losing end of BCS fiasco. Don't tell me about "best 2 teams." AL had their chance.  They lost. System stinks.
I hate BCS. Alabama lost to LSU. At HOME. Why punish LSU and LSU w/ rematch. Get rid of it!

@Brandon_J_Buck Uh, nope!  :-)
