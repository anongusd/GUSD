@registerguard Ways students can protect selves: spacing, pacing, tracking; avoid common source alcohol (punch bowls); avoid drinking games
@registerguard Research suggests children of parents who express permissive attitudes about drinking are more likely to drink.
@registerguard Topics that may reduce drinking/harm by college students: how alcohol affects body; dispelling myth that everyone is drinking.
@registerguard Try not to over-generalize or judge (a sure-fire conversation killer); don't get pulled into a debate ("Yeah, but ...")
@registerguard Also: Pick the right time to talk; appeal to common goals; agree to pause convo and pick things up later; be aware of body language.
@registerguard Dos and don'ts of these convos with teens: Listen w/o interrupting; verbalize respect/support autonomy; communicate directly.
These conversations are extremely difficult ‚Äî as Cronce noted in her op-ed in today's @registerguard: https://t.co/E4Mu98Grum
@DACEugene Trying to prevent "drinking" is different than trying to prevent alcohol-related consequences -- e.g. blackouts, hangovers, etc.
@DACEugene Just say no approaches don't work with this age group. But be upfront that alcohol and cannabis use is illegal for everyone under age 21
@DACEugene  https://t.co/PeGB7qWSIg
@DACEugene Most college students are not engaging in binge drinking; more than 1 in 3 haven't had a drink in the past month.
@DACEugene Plus: significant brain development is still occurring that affects decisions around risk v. reward. #quackchats
@DACEugene Transition from HS to college is marked by: more autonomy; less monitoring; changes in peer groups; new stressors.
@DACEugene Questions for professor Cronce? Tag your tweets #QuackChats and we‚Äôll try to get to as many as we can.
@DACEugene Dr. Cronce is Director of the Family and Human Services undergraduate major. Her bio: https://t.co/sLKliAG4i5 #QuackChats
