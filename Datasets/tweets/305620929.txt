@kenklippenstein 7/7 Ken‚Äôs right on this: Should have been more vocal in my concerns regarding the situation in Yemen. We all make mistakes. But this vote was about the farm bill.
@kenklippenstein 6/7 I wouldn‚Äôt be exercising my oversight responsibilities if I didn‚Äôt meet with them. ‚ÄúMeeting with‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúsupporting.‚Äù In fact, I made SA pretty mad when I supported the Iran deal. And when I voted to sunset the AUMF last year.
@kenklippenstein 5/7 Since coming into Congress, I‚Äôve been to over 50 countries + met with officials from all of them, allies and enemies. I welcome meetings with foreign leaders because dialogue is important.
@kenklippenstein 4/7 I was asked by Rep. Peterson to support the rule to advance the Farm Bill. He expressed serious concern that the widely-supported farm bill wouldn‚Äôt advance if the rule failed. Speculation about a clean rule later is just that: speculation.
@kenklippenstein 3/7 I didn‚Äôt meet with the Saudis three times in 2015. I met with them once. A staffer met with them once. We discussed a PEACEFUL resolution to the conflict in Yemen, not the violence that ensued.
@kenklippenstein 2/7 If ‚Äì BIG IF ‚Äì the resolution is brought up under privilege, it probably would have been tabled by the Republican leadership. We‚Äôll vote in January and I‚Äôll be a YES.
@kenklippenstein 1/7. I‚Äôm compelled to respond to the factual inaccuracies in this piece (I‚Äôll let the spelling of my name slide). First, the rule was not a motion to debate Rep. Khanna‚Äôs resolution. If the rule fails, the war in Yemen continues.

This is the most basic responsibility we have ‚Äì to fund the government ‚Äì and this bill delivers on priorities without unnecessary poison pills. This should be the norm, not the exception.
Legislation is always better when Republicans and Democrats negotiate together. This bill ‚Äì as well as last month‚Äôs bipartisan budget agreement and even last year‚Äôs omnibus ‚Äì are good examples of that.
After months of inaction, the House today had an opportunity to come together and make a real difference with the #omnibus and I am glad that we took advantage of that.

Today, I made the difficult decision to vote against a CR to fund the federal government. This is something I have done only rarely throughout my time in Congress and reflects the irresponsibility of the bill place before us today. My full statement: https://t.co/SlNONCJF6k
‚ùå Poor children	‚ùå Seniors on fixed incomes	‚ùå Suburban families	‚ùå Workers	‚ùå Teachers	‚ùå Police Officers	‚ùå Firefighters	‚ùå Veterans		Americans from coast to coast will suffer under the #GOPTaxScam.
The #GOPTaxScam will: 		Step 1: Give tax breaks to the wealthiest and corporations.  	Step 2: Explode the deficit.	Step 3: Force American middle class families to foot the bill.		I voted NO again today and am disappointed to see this measure pass.
Today's revote on the #GOPTaxScam shows yet again that this hastily-prepared bill promises an unknown number of hidden tax giveaways to corporations.
I voted against today's #tax bill. This bill was a missed opportunity to provide meaningful tax relief for American families and my constituents in #MD02. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/lwHJ87mNKR #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/0e0iJiTF8l
