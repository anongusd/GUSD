Turley offers a wild scenario - court could possibly enjoin Mueller bc not reporting to a confirmed appointee (Whitaker) - Whitaker apptment runs 210 days, if shot down by Senate, Whitaker gets another 210 days — could block Mueller for 420 days — hypothetical scenario
Quinn: “obstruction of justice is a crime of intent” tweets could be used to show intent later
Ben Veniste, Trump could be impeached based on obstruction were he to instruct staff/aides to meddle in investigation — Trump offers of clemency may count
Turley:  nothing Trump has done so far would rise to the level of obstruction (wouldnt meet standard in court)
Ben Veniste, does a cyberwar with Russia count as war for treason purposes?
Bloch says 25th Amendment should be in ConLaw books and she is now teaching it in her course
Bloch notes that 25th amendment actually spelled out VP ascension, whereas before it was just presumed
BV cites Birch Bayh, only case Cabinet and Potus would disagree is if President says “I’m well and able” but hes actually “nutty as a fruitcake”
Re 25th Amendment, “it is an enormously high bar” — would have to get the VP and majority of Cabinet to declare incapacity, followed by 2/3 vote in House
BV notes that framers were interested in thwarting foreign powers from unduly influencing president, US
Ben Veniste - “Was there a carrot and or stick” from Russia — if Trump camp was “influenced improperly” by Russia that would be impeachable
Ben Veniste cites three areas relevant now: bribery, self dealing and treason
Ben Veniste, the Clinton impeachment “really cheapened” impeachment
Quinn notes that interest in corruption of office/impeachment as remedy applies to obtaining office, not just work in office
Frmr Clinton WH counsel says House impeaching was a “political disaster”
Quinn notes House members will be responsive to those who elected them
“It’s not a footnote in history” Bloch says ... Also notes that its relevant that House impeached Clinton in the years before 9/11
Turley on Senate as jurors, “thats a tough jury to have, you’d strike most of them for cause” — (that got some laughs in the room)
Turley - “dont think you should factor in the likelihood Senate will convict” in impeachment debate
“Think the time for Mr Mueller to speak in court is about due,” Ben Veniste said
“Talk of impeachment is premature” Ben Veniste says, then notes that “right now we have a target rich environment” to investigate
Ben Veniste expects a “speaking indictment” to come from Mueller “in the near term”
Ben Veniste “Real wildcard is what Bob Mueller does”
Ben-Veniste: “ability to thwart Congress by slowing things to a standstill” is real .. but public backlash could push other way
Richard Ben-Veniste, on House, “politically they need to be very careful they dont trip over each other” ... “likely WH will try to slow walk anything House is demanding”
Bloch testified during Clinton impeachment debate against impeaching ... says now, “in some sense it undoes an election” ... House now “should not impeach”
Bloch cautions “impeachment process should be used very very guardedly”
Bloch doesnt expect any impeachment proceedings until after Mueller delivers report
“I wonder how Florida manages to make it so complicated” says Georgetown Law prof Susan Low Bloch, as an aside ... she thinks House will succeed in get Trump tax returns
Daskal notes DOJ argument in case that Mueller properly appointed
Former Human Rights Watch counsel Jennifer Daskal now on Whitaker, question of legitimacy/constitutionality
Quinn cautions Dem House against overreach
“I hear the echoes of the experiences I had in the Clinton admin all the time now” Quinn says
Quinn notes that executive privilege fights used to play out via negotiations, blames Gingrich spkrship for breakdown
Former Clinton counsel Jack Quinn, says House for last two years has “checked out of the process” - re checks on WH

And CBS calling WV for Manchin ... sure feels like Kavanaugh was consequential indeed (tho some big Senate toss-ups still to be seen)

This build on the prior reporting in the Broidy, Nader, UAE, Mueller saga (yes, another offshoot of the Mueller, #TrumpRussia story) /7
We found that Broidy met with Royce and his staffer drafting HR 2712 to discuss the legislation -- though it does not appear Broidy met the threshold needed to register as a lobbyist /6
The spending on the conferences, put on by FDD and Hudson, coincided with a push by House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce to include Qatar in the Hamas sanctions bill HR 2712 /5
And Broidy's team notes that all of the $2.5 million went to think tank conferences probing alleged Qatar ties to terrorism /4
Our investigation (w @bklapperAP @desmondbutler ) did NOT find any evidence that those donations originated with the Nader money /3
That effort coincided with a large uptick in federal donations by Broidy, roughly $600,000 worth, to top GOP types, RNC, Congressional leaders, etc /2

Sanders says Trump doesn't remember Papapdopoulos' Putin comments from March 31 meeting
Whether this was intentional or not on Mueller's part, sounds like most questions so far on Papadopoulos
Sanders says its "apples and oranges" to compare oppo promise from Russians in Trump Tower meeting to "millions" paid by DNC for dossier
"He asked to do things, he was basically pushed back" Sanders on Papadopoulos
RT @mkraju: Sarah Sanders not exactly unequivocal: There is "no intention" or "plan" to fire Mueller
"The president's had thousands of photographs with millions of people" - Sanders downplaying Papadopoulos
Q: When was Trump first aware of Russia email hacks? 	A: Don't know
Sanders on March 31, Papadopoulos meeting -- "was the one time they ever met"
"we know that they haven't spoken in several months, the last known convo was in February" - Sarah Sanders on last Manafort call w Trump
but in regards of the campaign, Papadopoulos' role was "extremely limited"

@etuckerAP The pro-cooperation crowd includes some inside and outside the WH who like that Mueller dealings are silo'd off, can get real work done
@etuckerAP But on the other side are aides and advisers who believe calm, steady cooperation will pan out
@etuckerAP The sense from the fight-the-Mueller-probe crowd is that Trump's legal team is "naive" to cooperate
@etuckerAP But there is a strong contingent of Trump loyalists, former campaign aides, and others who want him to fight

@AP @CNN I'm blessed to be coming from an incredibly strong team @cnn and I'm excited to join a growing team of aces on @AP's Russia team
@AP @CNN The goal: cover what these Russia investigations mean for Trump and the White House in every way
@AP @CNN I'll still be stalking House and Senate Intel, but now I'll be kicking at the White House occasionally and other spots around town
@AP You'll probably be seeing some similar work to what I've been doing with the killer @cnn team, but also a fair amount of new areas for me

James Comey testimony: Trump asked me to let Flynn investigation go .. w/ @jeremyherb https://t.co/BSUkmONWta
Comey says he did not want to say publicly Trump was not under investigation because that could change - March 30 phone call https://t.co/0XtMagwJ9d
The key Comey testimony - from his released statement -- confirms Trump asked him to "let it go" on Flynn, but didn't interpret broadly https://t.co/38uKLzPwx3
RT @mkraju: Warner won't say who the person is who took notes of the Coats/Rogers conversation
Burr "At no time should you be in a position in which you come to Congress without an answer"
Burr delivers message to Trump: You have to tell the Gang of Eight what is going on ... "Congressional oversight ... must be robust"
Warner: "The president is not above the law" 	Rosenstein: "Anybody who seeks to obstruct a federal investigation will be investigated"
McCain "Do you want to tell us any more about the Russian involvement in the US election that we don't already know from the WaPo?"
McCain notes the stark details included in the WaPo report ... Coats notes that bc its reported doesn't mean its declassified
RT @mkraju: McCabe once again says Comey still has broad support within the FBI; Kellyanne Conway said this week that Comey lost the confid…
"I've been around town long enough to say not take everything at face value that's printed in the Post" Coats says
McCain: "Gentleman you're here at an interesting time" ... says WaPo article is "more than disturbing, if it's true"
Reed: Is comment between Coats and Trump likely to become part of criminal investigation?	McCabe: Can't comment, too far removed
up now? The Senate Intel's two ex-officio members, Jack Reed then John McCain -- the leaders of Senate Armed Services Committee
RT @mkraju: Prodded by McCain, Burr not happy with Democrats not allowing witnesses to finish answering questions
important indicator here -- because this is Senate's second-ranking Republican pushing this line of Qs
so far, Cornyn the only one to ask Pro-Trump questions in here -- wants to know if unmasking for political reason and leaking a crime

Rosenstein says his assurance Mueller will not be fired is Mueller, Rosenstein and McCabe's integrity
@lrozen in typical situation, there would almost be no need to assert exec privilege -- classic political loyalty should cover. but this is atypical

Burr says they will take "first opportunity" to have intel chiefs back for classified session ... sounds like different hearing than today's
@lrozen Coats' inexorable honesty ... ask enough times and it's bound to come out ... Coats sounded like he almost said it
@lrozen he looks like he's still processing that exec privilege answer from Coats and Rogers
RT @lrozen: Warner follows up on King questions to establish it is not Mueller preventing witnesses from answering questions.
One big takeaway - executive privilege is on the table for Coats and Rogers, re classified session
Coats: I've had no conversations with Mr Mueller
Warner says they have not talked to Mueller yet and have not been waved off asking questions
Coats and Rogers say they will have to work through the WH counsel on whether they will answer questions in private
"What you feel isn't relevant, admiral" Sen. Angus King tells NSA Director Michael Rogers
This King exchange ...
King presses McCabe on why he will not answer question about Comey discussion .. McCabe says he does not recall if now under Mueller purview
Intelligence chiefs Coats, Rogers won't say if Trump asked them to downplay Russia probe https://t.co/iY6ZPEBS6O
Heinrich the first senator to press Rosenstein in public if he was ok with his memo being used to justify firing Comey
Blunt asks if "no effort to impede the Russia investigation" - McCabe says "that is correct"
Heinrich "At this point you filibuster better than some of my colleagues"
Heinrich asks Rosenstein if he knew the memo he wrote would be used to justify firing Comey - Rosenstein won't asnwer
Heinrich nailing Coats and McCabe for "unwillingness" to asnwer questions in public hearing
"You realize how simple it would be to say, 'No, that never happened" - Heinrich says to Coats
Heinrich asks "Why not"	McCabe says because they would fall w/i issues of Russia investigation ... "I'll let Comey speak for himself 2morro"
McCabe says he will not comment on conversations with Comey ...
"I'm not going to comment on any interactions with the president" Rogers says, as Collins asks again about Trump pressure reports
Here's a clear answer -- 	Collins asks if WH invoked exec privilege	Coats, Rogers, Rosenstein, McCabe said NO
Wyden asks if anyone on the panel took notes of Trump Russia convos	Coats "I don't take any notes" -- Rosenstein, Rogers, McCabe won't say
And, with that, Rubio nails Coats and Rogers on the semantics dance going on here ... reminder Coats has said he will talk in closed session
Coats and Rogers decline to say if they were asked by Trump to speak on the Russia investigation, both decline
Rubio pressing Coats and Rogers "Are you prepared to say you have never been asked?"
Important: There'ss a lot of wiggle room in the Coats and Rogers statement on Trump pressure. /1
Coats basically said the same thing at this hearing that he said at SASC hearing two weeks ago: He'll talk in classified setting
Coats and Rogers deny ever being "pressured" by Trump -- Coats says he would be open to answering questions in classified session
Coats: "I have never felt pressured to intervene in the Russia investigation in any way"
"I don't think this is the appropriate venue given this is an open hearing" Coats says
Coats and Rogers say they will not answer questions about reports of Trump's pressure on them to rebut Russia investigation, Comey
Coats: "I do not feel its appropriate for me in a public session ... to address that in a public session"
Warner is on Coats now -- "We now have press reports and you can lay them to rest if they're not true"
Rogers says he won't answer questions today on Trump pressure -- but says he has never felt pressure to do anything unethical
"I am not going to discuss the specifics of interactions that I may or may have not had with the president" Rogers says.
"We want to give you a chance to confirm or deny these" Warner says
Warner starting now ... opens with Qs on Rogers and Coats of Trump pressure
Burr now asking NSAs Rogers to explain/defend "incidental collection" ... basically undercutting the entire Trump counter to Russia stories

RT @lrozen: And in last five minutes, I would guess, Trump decided that McCabe is not going to be interim FBI director,
Collins: Is it normal for the FBI to alert someone they are not a target?	McCabe: It is not
Collins: When someone is a target, do you typically send a target letter? 	McCabe: "That is not correct"
Collins: Was a request for money made? 	McCabe: Cannot confirm that report ... "We do not typically request resources for a single case"
McCabe: "We do not curtail" our investigations
Collins: Is the agent in charge of #TrumpRussia still in charge? 	McCabe: All of the agents involved in #TrumpRussia are still involved

Also interesting: McCabe says he has the resources needed for the #TrumpRussia investigation
