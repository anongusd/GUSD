The amount of drama in this woman's life. She's currently naming all her acquaintances who have herpes and hepatitis.
2 hours later and he's on the phone with her a 3rd time. This conversation is going in circles. Put this relationship out of its misery.
She went straight to the train from where ever they were fighting without a coat or shoes
A woman sat across the aisle?and is trying not to cry while talking in the phone about how she was just in a fight with her ex fiancé.
Omg the drama on this train. #makeitstop
A nice thing about taking buses or planes is that people can't talk on their cellphones. Why is that not part of train etiquette? #quietpls
The point of headphones is to spare people from having to listen to whatever you are, so rapping along, out loud, defeats the purpose. #stfu
I should mention, I witnessed this grown man eating a lunchables when we first boarded.
And she hung up on him. Sad part is, it looks like she's in his phone as "The One ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"So you're a grown woman, but it's my fault. Okay."
"Whether or not we make it has nothing to do with me."
Now he's telling her he is questioning her love for him. Why couldn't he have waited to do this in person?
