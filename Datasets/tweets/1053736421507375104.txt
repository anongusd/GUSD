@96point8percent @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC @Twitter My service and the service of other soldiers ensured that you live in a free country where you can own a home and hold down a job. You are welcome.
@KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC President Trump had a medical condition which stopped him from serving. Otherwise he absolutely would have been out there. He even went to military cadet school.
@96point8percent @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC @Twitter Honestly don't remember if twitter suggested the name or I put in the numbers, my grandson mostly helped. 8 is prob the automatic number.
@KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC We can disagree over politics and politicians, but don't you DARE ever question my patriotism. Mine has been tested.
@KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC There's nothing worse than a dem who gets off on correcting other people's grammar. It's twitter, get off your high horse. #PretentiousMuch
@KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC Your just jealous you're not rich and smart enough to have money in the Cayman's like Governor Rick Scott. It's legal to bring money overseas.
@Thatotheraccou2 @KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC I'd be the first to give back my entitlements. My country needs a balanced budget. That's why I hope people @ScottforFlorida win so they can help Mitch McConnell end Medicare and Social Security. BALANCE. THE. BUDGET. #MAGA
@96point8percent @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC @Twitter You're just another dem who wants entitlements, wants the government to pay for everything, then whines about everyone on twitter. Go back to your mommy's house. Big Boys are talking #MAGA
@96point8percent @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC @Twitter You're an apple and you're calling me an imposter. Nice try bud.
@KayeBeeHoney @ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC People like me pay into it all. It's called Taxes. Try paying 'em.
@RonDeSantisFL We need more politicians like @RonDeSantisFL who promise to cut medicare and deport folks.

@ScottforFlorida @LindseyGrahamSC Good luck Governor Rick Scott. I hope the whole state of Florida votes for you. We need strong politicians like you to finally balance the budget and cut entitlements like medicare, welfare and social security. Fix this country! #MAGA
@FLGovScott Good luck Governor Rick Scott. Hopefully when you win, you and Leader McConnell, can finally put an end to entitlements and cut welfare, medicare and social security. #MAGA
Thank you Leader McConnell for all your hard work. Now get cracking on ending entitlements!! #MAGA https://t.co/ARkacLt6pt
