Hoosiers can protect Lake Michigan at home by maintaining their septic systems, conserving water, limiting the use of lawn chemicals and observing prohibitions on open burning of trash and yard waste.
Hoosiers can protect Lake Michigan while recreating by frequenting designated Clean Marinas and adopting clean boating and angling practices on the water. At the beach, they should properly dispose of trash/pet waste and avoid feeding shorebirds.
Under the agreement, IDEM works with many partners to implement Great Lakes-specific programs, such as the Lakewide Action and Management Plan (LAMP) Program for Lake Michigan. For more info about IDEM’s Lake Michigan Programs, visit: https://t.co/ggH1RuWVVC.
On this date in 1972, the US and Canada first signed the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The agreement was most recently updated in 2012, and has been vital to the protection of the Great Lakes. For more info, visit: https://t.co/4VkrLj7oeR
