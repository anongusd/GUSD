.@IsraeliPM: @POTUS has made it clear that he's committed to #peace w/ the Palestinians. I have made it clear that I am committed to peace. But to get peace President Abbas has to embrace peace &amp; stop supporting #terror.He pays about $350M each year to terrorists &amp; their families
.@IsraeliPM: We should always remember the brave people of #Iran their suffering, their hopes, their courage. We stand with those in Iran who stand for #freedom.
.@IsraeliPM: We'll never let Iran develop nuclear weapons! @POTUS made it clear that his admin will not accept Iran’s aggression in the region, that he will never accept a nuclear armed Iran &amp; that if the fatal flaws in the #NuclearDeal aren't fixed, the USA will walk away
.@IsraeliPM: We must stop #Iran. We will stop Iran...Iran is building an aggressive empire; Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Yemen, more to come. Iran is also seeking to build precision guided missile factories in Syria, in Lebanon.

.@VP: In just the past month the mounting Iranian menace has been laid bare for all to see... but Israel’s swift and strong response sent a message to #Iran across the region: that dangerous provocations will not go unchecked.
.@VP: Under @POTUS the USA remains fully committed to achieving a lasting #peace between Israelis &amp; Palestinians. While any peace will undoubtedly require compromise, know this: the USA will never compromise the safety and security of the Jewish State of Israel.
.@VP: It was my great honor in January of this year to be the first American VP to address the Knesset in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. @POTUS will make history again when, with the help of @USAmbIsrael, in May of this year we will open the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
.@VP at #AIPAC2018: Thanks to the @POTUS leadership, the relationship between the US &amp; Israel has never been stronger. The friendship between our peoples has never been deeper. We stand with #Israel because that’s what the American people have always done. https://t.co/GA1PKnmaxF
.@nikkihaley: We will continue to demand that #Israel not be treated like some sort of temporary provisional entity. It can't be the case that only 1 country in the world can't choose its capital city...Israel isn't going away. If the world recognizes that, peace becomes possible
.@nikkihaley: People accuse us of favoritism toward #Israel. There’s nothing wrong with showing favoritism toward an ally; that’s what being an ally is all about. But, our approach to Israel is tied together by one major idea: Israel must be treated like any other normal country.
.@nikkihaley: This isn't something that was created by the location of an embassy or an American decision. America didn't make Jerusalem Israel’s capital. What @POTUS did was to recognize a reality that American presidents had denied for too long.
.@nikkihaley at #AIPAC2018: Like most Americans, I knew what the capital of Israel was. To be more clear, I knew that #Jerusalem was, is, and will always be Israel’s Capital. https://t.co/OngaHwI8jL

.@jimmymoralesgt: In May of this year, we will celebrate Israel's 70th anniversary, and under my instructions, two days after the US moves its embassy, Guatemala will return and permanently move its embassy to #Jerusalem.
.@jimmymoralesgt: As President of Guatemala...I decided to return the Guatemalan Embassy to Jerusalem. As a sovereign decision, we recognize #Jerusalem as the capital of #Israel.
.@jimmymoralesgt at #AIPAC2018: @POTUS courageous decision has encouraged us to do what is right. It is important to be among the first, but it is more important to do what is right.
President of Guatemala @jimmymoralesgt at #AIPAC2018: On December 24 of last year, #Guatamala was the first country to join the US &amp; announce that we will be returning our embassy to #Jerusalem. I would like to thank @POTUS for leading the way.

.@AmbDermer: #Iran already has missiles that can hit Israel - so the new weapons it is building aren’t for us, they’re for Europe and the rest of the world. If Iran is going to continue its ballistic missile program we need to put crippling sanctions on it.
.@AmbDermer: the #IranDeal puts us on cruise control over a cliff. Iran is advancing its nuclear weapons program under this agreement. Right now. As we speak, Iran is doing research &amp; development into advanced centrifuges which it will use to enrich uranium.
.@AmbDermer: @IsraeliPM Netanyahu has been very clear about his red lines in Syria; we’re going to continue to enforce our red lines and what’s important for people to understand is we are not going to allow #Iran to continue its goals in Syria.
.@AmbDermer at #AIPAC2018: Iran continues on its mission to establish permanent military bases in Syria, to establish another terror front against Israel in #Syria, and to build factories for precision weapons in Syria and Lebanon.

@AmbDermer .@AmbDermer: Jerusalem has been Israel’s capital and the center of Jewish hopes and dreams for 3,000 years. I am very hopeful we will hear good new from @POTUS Trump tomorrow. Israel believes recognizing Jerusalem as our capital will right a history wrong.
@AmbDermer .@AmbDermer: And while we have many symbols of sovereignty - we have a flag, an anthem, and a Shekel- the most important symbol is the IDF. If the IDF is the most important symbol of Jewish sovereignty, Jerusalem is the most meaningful.
@AmbDermer .@AmbDermer: I hope on Hanukkah we remember that we the Jewish people have always had to fight for our sovereignty.
@AmbDermer .@AmbDermer: Jews perhaps more than any other people appreciate what sovereignty means. We are a very old people, 4,000 years old. But we have spent less than a quarter of that time as a sovereign people.

@AmbDermer .@AmbDermer: Until the 10th century, 90% of all Jews lived in what is today the Arab world; until the 17th century more Jews lived in those lands than lived in Europe; in 1939 one third of Baghdad was Jewish. And then in a few years a massive expulsion occurred-850,000 in all.
