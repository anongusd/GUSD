@erinmdurkin @jdavidgoodman @EricFPhillips @katetaylornyt Exactly!!
@jdavidgoodman @EricFPhillips @katetaylornyt Yes. I agree. There is something strange about the way this was done. It’s not like @KingJames was standing behind mayor. No way you plan an announce like that for Sunday unless there’s ulterior motive. Was just responding to the flawed tax example.
@EricFPhillips @jdavidgoodman @katetaylornyt That reasoning makes no sense when you four prime weekdays to break such a story. Big diff. bet.  a NYT exclu that gets big play and consequently draws attention to your boss’ plan and what you guys did yesterday. People DO tune out on Sundays.
@EricFPhillips @jdavidgoodman @katetaylornyt Do we really need to discuss the difference between this — feeding the times or any other paper a scoop on a Sunday to advance the announcement of a pet project on Monday — and a sudden Sunday presser? C’mon.

Well you see its a minimalist version of barbecue https://t.co/Qme9w6TS8U
@marciaherold @HometownBarBQue @PigBeachNYC Absolutely true. Kinda like @Widow_Jane bourbon, which, while made in NY and not Kentucky, is among the tops imho. As for the BBQ, must be something about the toxic Gowanus that inspires such good smoke.
@marciaherold @HometownBarBQue @PigBeachNYC yeah it looks like someone grossly under-ordered wherever that was, which likely does disservice to the establishment. and obv. if you’ re gonna say the best BBQ if in BKNY rather than KC, Memphis or Texas there’s gonna be a fight.
@marciaherold @HometownBarBQue @PigBeachNYC with @FletchersBklyn right there with them. Also Gowanus
@marciaherold Not sure how this started. But if talking great BBQ in BK, then you gotta be talking about @HometownBarBQue in Red Hook or @PigBeachNYC in Gowanus
