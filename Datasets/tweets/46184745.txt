Our nation is the greatest the world has ever known. I am honored to make the drive every day to make our government work for the people of the First District, so they can achieve the American Dream. #SOTU #VA01
I am proud to have our US Embassy in Jerusalem. We must always be diligent in standing against anti-Semitism and acts of hate against individuals because of their faith. #SOTU
Thank you to our men and women in uniform at home and abroad that keep 	 our nation secure. I will always fight to give our servicemembers the resources they need to protect our homeland." #SOTU
The House led the way last year by passing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Let's make it law this year to protect the dignity of all human life. #SOTU
We must also ensure that donor states like Virginia are getting the return on their investment for the dollars they put in for transportation funding. #SOTU
Broadband must be a priority for any major infrastructure investment package to expand economic opportunity to rural economies .  #SOTU
Both funding our government and securing our border are possible. We have kicked the can down the road on discussing our funding priorities long enough #SOTU
Our policies have made Americans  confident in their economy and protected the middle class. #SOTU		‚úîÔ∏èLowest unemployment in half a century	‚úîÔ∏è5.3 million new jobs 	‚úîÔ∏è600,000 new manufacturing jobs
I am proud of our work last Congress to expand access to the "unlimited potential" of our nation, from historic tax cuts, fully funding our nation's defense, advancing workforce development, and expanding veterans' access to care. #SOTU
