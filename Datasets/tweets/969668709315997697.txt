RT @KatTheHammer1: A glimpse of Biden's first political Ad! 		#Biden2020 	#JustLetItHappen		Thank you .@PantSuitLover 💯 https://t.co/N2R4RR…
@AGWilliamBarr Good luck in the new job, Willy. 		Whatever your investigations turn up... 	Hillary did it.
Kamala wants to put y’all back in chains, Rodney! Don’t fall for her act. The only protector of minorities in this race is going to be Uncle Joe. I’ll be down there getting my hands all over your pork soon, Rodney.		#Biden2020 #HisTurn https://t.co/FuZi3055ti
To all the dregs of society who support Trump, Uncle Joey is coming for you. Get ready for a pounding. I’m going to bring the full thrust of Justice upon you.
DM me and I can prove how right you are 😘 Jill said it’s ok. https://t.co/XqCLIhKl62
I like sweatpants 😏 https://t.co/E1vYZdnc3E
Thank you Meghan!! Us Democrats need to stick together in these dark times. I’ll always cherish the great work your father and I did together to defeat conservatives and water down the constitution.		#Biden2020 #McCainBringsThePain	#CrushingConservatives https://t.co/rkNt8DCNmH
Not every school has armed security. And most of these shootings are in gun free zones. But thats prob bc we don’t have enough signs telling people that guns aren’t allowed. We need MORE SIGNS and LESS GUNS!!		The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy WITH A SIGN!! https://t.co/GrWaXVSH62
John McCain is an important part of the #Resistence, and vital in our efforts to #Inpeach45. We need more heroes to take his lead, run for office pretending to be conservative, and then ignore the voters and side with us Dems!		#Hero #SeriouslyHeroic https://t.co/fV8HS3m9OS
My sweet angel @BarackObamaPAC has had some twitter features suspended for now. This sort of thing isn’t supposed to happen to Dems! (Especially not POC)		Release my man from the twitter plantation, or Uncle Joe is coming at ya in 2020!		#TwitterPlantation
RT @CowboyDave22: Ran into a great man in DC. 2020, here we come. https://t.co/s1mbPh6D4z
@Mel_Ankoly @TedLieuPAC Lol, you actually think you got Maxine suspended?? You do realize that account closes every few weeks so the creator can take a break... you mean nothing. Literally nothing. You’re worthless.
@BarackObamaPAC @Aungiexyz 😍😍😍 https://t.co/UCGivJ2Y8m
Thank you for your support!! I’ll need every vote in 2020. And if you find a way to vote more than once, Uncle Joe has a special way of showing his gratitude 😍 Thanks again, Carter! https://t.co/R1yJuwBNIa
Exactly! These racists don’t want blacks, Hispanics, or non-Americans to vote. I don’t care where you were born, or what country you’re a citizen of now... contact me, @NancyPeelosi, or @MaxinePWaters and we’ll get you a voter registration card to vote Biden in 2020! https://t.co/2CU4UmSlz9
@RobertMueIIer I have info on the pee pee tapes. And not the ones I made with @BarackObamaPAC. DM me!
As my constituents, I’ll give you everything I’ve got. All of my heart, all of my body... my undivided attention. My gentle whispers. Caress upon caress. It’s time, America 😘		#Biden2020 #HisTurn #ImWithHim https://t.co/BYVskahlWR
@Neocon_Pundit That’s like asking why I would smell a flower.
@Ange6H777 We all know I’m going to choose @BarackObamaPAC as my VP. The country is ready for its first half black Vice President 💪
This is just rude.		And btw if you think things were bad during our 8 years, blame Trump. It’s impossible to get the economy going when everyone knows Trump will eventually be the president. We did our best. https://t.co/mHwiBQ8vUG
@SamanthaEm10 You could have just said no 😢
This is the kind of transparency Americans are craving right now. I plan to use it as a model for my 2020 campaign.		#Biden2020 #HisTurn		https://t.co/u2rFi6Skxe
If by “bad” you mean “naughty” send me a DM. Zuck and I are free tonight. https://t.co/s73vdv7JRN
@realDonaldTrump is setting a dangerous precedent. A bad trade deal is still a deal, and most Americans would agree that it’s better to suffer economically than to be Indian givers.		#Biden2020 #NoNewDeals https://t.co/94WjZz7cip
I’ve never noticed how big and beautiful your hands are, @NancyPeelosi. HMU if you want to have some vodka and a few laughs tonight. https://t.co/5GhcQiJCCt
This is just outrageous. What’s next? Make it illegal for the FBI to spy on political opponents???		You’re on a slippery slope, Melissa. https://t.co/LAEpPUzk6B
Where did you find a picture of the Joker without his makeup?! https://t.co/AVjE8JILqZ
For being everyone’s favorite Uncle? My polling data shows that these pictures increase my favorability in the rust belt. Bring it, you old prune.		#Biden2020 #HisTurn #ImWithHim https://t.co/f2lRUjI1eF
RT @TedLieuPAC: More proof that we need common sense gun control, but the NRA keeps selling military grade firearms like these - even in Wa…
It would be a shame if Irrelevant Hillary fell and couldn’t get up while she was having hangover diarrhea this week... 		#LifeAlert #HisTurn #RidinWithBiden https://t.co/j9YltnFxAf
This kid is a genius. You can’t just go and take away a kids right to wear a regular backpack bc of the bad actions of one person.		Instead we need to do the right thing, and take away the rights of all Americans to bear arms. It’s what the founders would have wanted.		#Biden2020 https://t.co/5bvk5Wof41
Here in Washington we all have our disagreements. But can we just pause and celebrate the fact that taxpayer money was spent today? 		If it wasn’t spent, it would have been useless to take it, basically theft. But by spending, we give taxpayers purpose. You’re welcome America.
Crazy Joe Biden? Bring it, Ronald DickDonald! I’m looking forward to stomping you in 2020. I’ll be hovering all over you on that debate stage, and I won’t be giving you the Uncle Joe special (soft kisses, gentle whispers)... your rump is mine.		#Biden2020 #HisTurn https://t.co/vyKYS5En5c
@RealWilky You’ll be playing the ultimate price, kid. https://t.co/fBDNvCiBEb
I’m tough! I would have beaten Trump up, impregnated his mother, become his step father, and taught him that you can’t grab women by the p-word in public. Stick to shoulder rubs, soft kisses, and gentle whispers.		https://t.co/XuJVzbbaoe
I don’t believe this is a real Trump voter. I see no #MAGA hat. And he isn’t beating up any mexicans or lgbtq’s. He isn’t even cussing at muslims. https://t.co/oQ5IiQ9EUf
Please thank your mom for me too. We had a really great time last night. https://t.co/yx4YgXC5HS
Sometimes in life God calls you to a higher purpose. I’ll do anything to #INPEACH Trump. Even if that means asking tough questions like: 		“Did he touch you like this? How about like this? Do you like that? Mm, you smell nice.” https://t.co/urx0q8LkVB
My bad. From behind I thought the mannequin was your mom.		#Biden2020 #HisTurn https://t.co/uXZcAJckbU
No thank you! While I believe in a healthy primary process, we don’t need such a radical liberal like @JeffFlake pulling our party any further to the left.		Uncle Joe’s centrism is what wins us the rust belt, baby!		#Biden2020 #I’mWithHim #HisTurn https://t.co/zhrwZCQKgU
This is outrageous. It’s just like all the other businesses that shut down from 2008-2016 in anticipation of the future Trump economy. Trump has been destroying our prosperity for too long! https://t.co/0zV92L15cB
#StPatricksDay2018 https://t.co/OKBCzuljvO
@stellby_kitty Of course! Don’t worry, I called Judge Contreras first and he texted me a FISA warrant. https://t.co/pzUDj0ULuS
The fact that people can buy weapons like this without a background check is barbaric.		My neighbor brought one of these home the other night and I heard her screaming for almost an hour from the damage it was inflicting on her. https://t.co/vyD5sfgtbb
@spankdatboy @JarredKushner Kids, parents, grandparents... EVERYONE loves kisses from Uncle Joe! 👍
@MaxinePWaters for SCOTUS? That’s just the beginning when you elect Uncle Joe!		#Biden2020 #BidenWaters2020 https://t.co/IvrolG6X7Q
@zgoncp You misspelled “sexy.”
This is just rude. Using politics to acquire wealth is one of the longest-standing traditions in America. How dare you mess around with that, just because you’re upset?!		#Biden2020 https://t.co/JPDvOtfeZ2
@ElectHillary @TedLieuPAC @JoeBiden There was a time when both of you loved my fast mouth. I still have the tapes.
So everyone’s afraid of a little affection, now?! Uncle Joe has the warm touch that the people in the rust belt are craving. https://t.co/gdfYgwdiMk
He’d better win. I massaged his shoulders for at least fifteen minutes. That has to still count for something. https://t.co/caMCAW2ecy
Big announcement coming soon!!! 😉
