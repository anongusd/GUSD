@benshapiro Cohen is a lawyer.  Grades &amp; SAT scores are supposed to be private unless you sign a release.  Lawyers threaten people every day... all day.  There is nothing "off" about this letter.  If people have a problem with it, they should be questioning the law &amp; how lawyers operate.

Here's my take away from this Michael Cohen hearing.  Cohen is a lawyer.  Most of those people grilling him in Congress are lawyers.  Sketchy Payments, Bad Agendas, NDAs, Fraudulent Bank Transactions, Shell Companies, Organized Crime, Real Estate Crimes... Most Lawyers are slimy.

@SenWarren @SenateGOP Next up, almost time to vote on the Green New Deal.

@SenWarren @SenateGOP All the Democrats voting against the Born Alive Act and instead choosing to support Infanticide is a really bad look.  This isn't about political points.  It is about the lives of viable infants being saved if they survive the brutality of a late term abortion.  You're gross.

@hartfordcourant Currently, Local Connecticut Voters in Cities and Towns can make their voices heard easily at the Voting Booth when they're unhappy with tax &amp; spend policies and/or if they want new programs funded.  Taxing at the State level takes away local voters voices in municipalities.
@hartfordcourant I need to see a lot more details about this "plan" before I make too many statements on it.  If the towns don't get enough money back, what kind of taxes will municipalities have to increase to cover the difference?  Sounds like a giveaway to cities who suck at budgeting.

@TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Until Media and Politicians stop hopping on every bit of narrative that supports their BS positions, Russia &amp; other Foreign powers promoting these division campaigns will keep succeeding.  The real fault lies with these power hungry politicians &amp; media hacks that promote the BS.
@TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Don't fall into this trap Tatum.  Russia uses highly sophisticated psy op strategies to cause division.  It is the fault of idiot politicians like Kamala Harris and Media types for amplifying those messages and treating them as if they were real.

@shayken13 You're right.  I'm just going to have to fill out the application and leave the rest up to GOD.  I can't change the past and if I can't live here then back to the hooker motels for me.  That's the part that really freaks me out.  I don't want to have to live in a bad area again.
That's right Mr. President.  #AmericaFirst. Does that mean you are going to change your mind about all those #H1B workers &amp; their pathways to citizenship?

@hartfordcourant What happened to most of the jobs handled at Data Centers?		They were outsourced.  IT jobs, Data Center jobs &amp; Customer Service Rep jobs were replaced by cheap foreign labor.  They forced people to train Foreigners before sending them back to India.		No $14 Million for #Infosys.

@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant Thanks Dad.  How about if I leave that up to my Psychiatrist who doesn't find me to be an alcoholic?  I'm BiPolar with PTSD.  I was not on my medications.  Do you want to try to live in my head without medications?  Don't judge me because you want to side with Police Brutality.
@JB21218795 @streetglide12 @hartfordcourant When I realized he cop who sat down at my table (while I was drinking a soda after I paid my bar tab while waiting for my Uber) wasn't a security guard &amp; was a cop, I assumed he was an off duty cop getting drunk.  Seeing 1/2 dozen cops outside when I went to leave freaked me out.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I suggest the Police don't beat up Citizen Journalists for asking annoying questions and then try to cover their asses afterwards.  I also suggest the Connecticut Legislature legalize Recreational Marijuana so that people who smoke won't get harassed by the cops.  #LegalizeItüíö
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I went to Bowl a Rama @ 9pm.  I told PD on Twitter I was going.  I don't drive.  I took Uber.  Police Report makes it sound like I just went for a few minutes, left, then came back to start trouble.  I was there 3 hours &amp; I've a bar tab payment in my banking records to prove it.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I think my question asking why they were bothering me with all the Human Trafficking up and down the Berlin Turnpike pissed them off.  Nobody hurt me until I asked that question.  Police Report is also full of lies.  They make it sound like I just popped in to start trouble.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant Newington cops had to arrest my ex I have a lifetime restraining order on few years back.  When Shannon beat the shit out of me on the Berlin Tke where I was staying after Shannon burned my apt down, they never asked me if I just bruise easy.  They're covering their own asses.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I have been on disability for BiPolar disorder for 10 years.  I go to see a psychiatrist once a month for medications.  At the time, I couldn't afford ACA or my meds so it was easier for my PTSD to get triggered.  They knew I was a psych case &amp; then hurt &amp; arrested me anyways.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I lived right off the Berlin Turnpike and was looking into the Human Trafficking for Citizen Journalism school.  I have since moved down to Madison.  It is much safer down here and I haven't had any problems.  It's peaceful.  No Pimps, hookers or drugs.  It's nice.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I went to Newington Police Station to file a complaint.  A woman and man officer were both present.  When I showed them pictures of my bruises, the Male cop asked me if I just bruise easy.  NO I DON'T!  I got scared they'd hurt me again so I left before I could finish the report.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I don't remember anything after that because I have PTSD and after the cop hurt me, I lost it.  They sent me directly to the Emergency Room for psych issues.  I wouldn't have had any psych issues if they hadn't hurt me.  They charged me because they KNEW they screwed up.  Period.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I walked outside.  There was at least a 1/2 dozen cops.  It was intimidating especially to someone with PTSD.  I asked them "Why are you bothering me with all the Human Trafficking up and down the Berlin Turnpike?"  That's when a cop grabbed my arm painfully &amp; said "That's It"
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant Some cop (who I originally thought was a security guard because I couldn't see, I reported a Fake Doctor who gave me a Fake Rx for glasses but they wouldn't do anything about it) sat down and starting harassing me.  I called an Uber to go home and tried to leave. Cops stopped me.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I was at Bowl a Rama Karaoke on the Berlin Turnpike singing badly and doing homework for Citizen Journalism school.  Connecticut is not very tolerant of questions that don't meet up with Leftist ideology.  The Bartender said people were complaining so I paid my tab.
@streetglide12 @hartfordcourant I have my Medical Marijuana license. After the cops &amp; EMTs were done beating me up &amp; illegally searching my bag, they charged me with cannabis violations anyways.  My Medical Marijuana card was right behind my ID they pulled out. Cops like easy charges &amp; covering their own asses. https://t.co/GLvLZyde5G

@SenBlumenthal I request on behalf of my dead brother &amp; dead best friend you please stop screwing around and Fund Border Security and Fund the Border Barriers.  I also ask because I'm tired of watching people suffer at the hands of illegals because you want to play political games.  Thank you.
@LoreleiSurvivor You know I support Trump most of the time but I told Bernie the other day 1/2 my family wrote him in even though he wasn't on 2016 ballot.  I think he can win the Dem Primary if he runs.  Exact words from 1 Bernie Voter to me "Bernie or Bust".  Dems already trying to trash him.
@alexplitsas I'm wishing her a speedy recovery too.  I disagree with her most of the time but she does speak for a lot of people.  If she has to retire I do hope a moderate Constitutionalist is picked for the next seat.  We don't want judicial activism but we need balance.
@Graceann319 @realDonaldTrump The whole Country is run by various players in organized crime.  You really need to broaden your mind Grace Ann.  You're stuck on somebody else's narrative and it's not the truth.  I have faith you'll figure it out.  That's another reason I follow you.
