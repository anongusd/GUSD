I pray he's way ahead of these crazies! My Lord tells me to have faith, so I'm trying! @POTUS has been ahead of them so far &amp; certainly doesn't look worried over all their threats &amp; lawsuits! God bless him, &amp; we need to keep supporting him! Vote RED in minions in 2020! https://t.co/ncAnMMnECs
I don't believe the Democrats have won an election in the past 20 years. Illegals, dead people, criminals, multi-voters, are all really happening!  Once again, I ask, where are the police &amp; enforcers at? https://t.co/NTblEz4CUo
I think the Democrats plan on cheating to steal the election! They have to know their polls are all lies and that legal citizens will stand against them! They are trying to bring in people illegally to build more support, but I think Trump will block or at least slow that down. https://t.co/NTblEz4CUo
The smart thing for Russia &amp; China to do would be watch us fight ourselves until we're weak &amp; then come in and takeover. https://t.co/NTblEz4CUo
I think the UN has its own problems! China &amp; Russia have power &amp; if NATO allies join them, it'd might B destruction of the world. Our military will side w/ the people!  The riff raff countries in the UN are all anti-Israel &amp; it wouldn't take much for Israel to take them all out! https://t.co/NTblEz4CUo
They think they're smart with it &amp; that we don't notice. They should look at how many swamp creatures have been driven out so far. It's a long list. They need to stay true or we'll get them out! @GOP still has RINOs &amp; we know who they are. https://t.co/5DYAZciv2d

It's not we Jim! That's where I hope lies. The people will rise up against this, if the @GOP doesn't do something in the next two years. If Barr can't get some indictments going then 2020 will either be a red tide or red rebellion! https://t.co/6BCfs3DkXc
They still think they can indict our squeaky clean @POTUS - 2 yrs of Bull Dog Mueller &amp; he got nothing!

Correct! I get my hopes up when someone like Congressman Meadows got personal, called him a good friend, &amp; then Cummings defended him against the general racism claim! I kept hoping he'd apply that to all the Trumpsters! We aren't racists! Cummings let us all down! https://t.co/NQgOL7FLME
Nothing new, but the Democrats seem to all be running with the idea that everything Cohen said was possible, although not supported by a shred of evidence, as Mueller's team learned, and yet Dems are out using it like it was all true! U guys call yourselves lawyers? https://t.co/Xz5kfvA03I
He lost ALL control of that search when he allowed his fellow Democrats to give more speeches than they asked questions. They also led the witness with questions like "Would U say ....!" Any Judge worth being on the bench would have silenced that line of questioning in heartbeat! https://t.co/ASx3FV8s1s
@RepCummings when U started your speech I was hopeful, but by the time you finished it, U apparently have NO VISION for how the 65 Million plus Conservatives fit into the USA U would like to go back to! 1st, U must understand we R not racists! That is ALL made up by the MSM! https://t.co/xK66FjvDRV

Well, I have changed my mind on Stone after learning more! I put Smollett at a higher level of crime than Stone!

If everything stayed stagnant, the gains that you speak of would be realized &amp; lifestyle would go up. We are all greedy for more, &amp; people want to blame it on the companies.

Not really? As a consumer myself, it's really obvious that everything gained is consumed in inflation that we artificially create by raising wages.

@AshleyMcfarley Because they hate Trump, they begin everything with VAST majority, but fail to give us how much was actually grabbed at the ports of entry.  Also, it doesn't account for the amounts brought in by those in the 4/5 group that are not caught! Much gets in that way!
There's nothing there that I would doubt has some truth to it, but within that article "US Border Patrol seized nearly 480,000 pounds of narcotics at the US-Mexico border between legal ports of entry during fiscal yr 2018, said Dept of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman" https://t.co/Y47R8X8S7n

That's what you've read or been told? I don't know how much we spend, but I C news in Texas showing them pouring in.

Good night &amp; thank you! Very good discussion! God bless you! https://t.co/694iGku2bd
Sure, but one more peace of advice. Try talking to as many union members as you can and ask them how they feel about their unions! My Wife's sister is a union member &amp; hates them because they let her down. My daughter is, &amp; doesn't feel they get her anything? Just ask? https://t.co/694iGku2bd
Not enough variables considered! Overall, I truly believe employees do not need unions in today's legal environment! They aren't bad, they are just a waste of the employee's hard earned money! I've lived 40 years in industry &amp; unions are OK? https://t.co/wEnM9Sin46
Unions were good in earlier days &amp; are the reason a lot of laws were passed, unions were bad when they brow beat their members &amp; controlled them, &amp; unions are still good in some industries for several reasons! I was always a union sympathizer, but also knew when to criticize them https://t.co/vY3HrXBtbJ
I could give U cases where the rich prospered when paying the highest wages in their industry! Try looking up Johnsonville Brats, looking 4 a Tom Peters video! Excellent company during that time frame! Businesses have so much turnover in leadership their profit go up/down a lot! https://t.co/WjYvmUQfvM
I was a Captain, the a Supervisor, then a Manager &amp; finally retired after 15 years as a Corporate Director! You got me! https://t.co/F4qoFOD9nm
Again, they aren't explaining in their data the impact of taxes, downturns in business &amp; investment growth, on these numbers. I tell you, they can just about tell you anything they want by cherry picking the data! https://t.co/ostw52kMBb
The rich prosper any time business is happening! People will show you all sorts of stats to try to convince you to organize! I've always felt people get more benefits when they cut out the middleman &amp; use HR &amp; the laws! https://t.co/ostw52kMBb

How do you account for the impact on earnings of population growth, including illegals, unemployment increasing &amp; the moving of so many jobs off shore for tax advantages? https://t.co/gwMPaMcOd9
I am looking a decline in middle class of an unknown % of the overall population. When I entered industry, seemed I was told that unions never had a foot hold in more than about 1/3 of the businesses in the USA.  There are so many variables that would impact this! https://t.co/gwMPaMcOd9
Sorry, I thought that was the kind of thing they wanted for the crazy Green deal they are talking about? Now that scares me! https://t.co/0snHkCSrSM
Yes, I knew U were correct based on Ur anecdotal claim but smaller companies paying less R included in those studies &amp; often don't have unions! Big companies R smart, I've even witnessed unions getting less than the company was willing 2 pay! https://t.co/vrDBFeuGGC
In the Union shops from my earlier days, they only helped get what we would have got them anyway! They just happen to have more unions in the higher paying companies! Another stat U have to know more about to understand it! Union leaders become a dynasty just like dictators! https://t.co/VXpBzusgDu
I understand that, I'd like that 2 but that requires someone to dictate to the owners to make it happen that way! That's what our govt tries to do under Dem leadership! GOP just believes hard work will get U there! It would work if we didn't give so much away or spend it on wars! https://t.co/8K0rIRJTJR
Unions do the same things the dictators do! The union leaders make a lot &amp; the employees don't get much more than they would have had they negotiated with the company! I know, cause I used to be involved in negotiations! Union dues are wasting salary! Laws protect people now! https://t.co/Lx9TzXrSFk

I'll try to look it up but I'll give U an example you'll like. There was a lady in TX yrs ago, who created a company 2 pay needy people a wage &amp; all the profits went to help them. She became the fastest growing company in TX that yr. You can't dictate people do it though! https://t.co/bTbQqyizGs
Why would a teacher teach? The students have no 100% to give them in work to get 100% of the profit or in that case knowledge? Way to many examples out there that sharing 100% will not happen! It just won't! https://t.co/IagDWzTkzO
@spinson7746 @IlhanMN I think you are right! But it's up to the real constituents to take her to court on that!
The hunter would say they didn't risk their lives killing the beast too? The person who has saved &amp; worked to get enough to invest deserves something. If he just worked &amp; didn't save, like the others, there would be no jobs growth! https://t.co/IagDWzTkzO
My example is intended to say that people who are first, often end up with the meat or the money! People built the railroad with their money &amp; hiring a lot of people! All those jobs were the reward for the people. Some companies created stores &amp; housing for their people! https://t.co/HCOzcjQ0W7
The people who build things are using their own labor to serve the company too! https://t.co/HCOzcjQ0W7
If you keep growing the example, the wealth was in the meat, he gave part to pay for a service, someone could grow the vegetables &amp; he pay them again in meat to get some. The meat was money at the time! Today's work is very similar, someone pays to get a service. https://t.co/HCOzcjQ0W7

It's a harsh word! Exploitation is what we used to say a manager was paid to do! Exploit the workers to get as much out of them as possible! The motivation of paying piece rate came so that anyone who wanted to excel could do more &amp; get more pay. Exploiting them more, I guess? https://t.co/z5D5qz0Ng4

It will be interesting to see how that works for them?  That's not really socialism though, it's more employee ownership &amp; if they don't run things efficiently those companies will become mediocre! https://t.co/zMg0fuUnEb
Your logic leaves no room 4 anyone 2 want 2 invest. That's the problem! Socialism has always taken away people's ownership of what they are doing without giving them incentives related to that ownership! Communism even worse. Everyone is subjected to mediocrity!

If I pay them exactly what they produce, how do I make money to pay my taxes? Companies divide costs into Materials, labor &amp; overhead. Most employees just have to come to work &amp; everything is set up for them. They don't produce it all by themselves. https://t.co/vcV0eL6GHy
I would say I pay them what the market requires to get good people willing to do it. Then out of the kindness of my heart, I pay for benefits, vacation, etc. - Until the company makes me pay them more, like Amazon, &amp; I take away most of the benefits to lead the way! https://t.co/vcV0eL6GHy

Another way 2 hide wealth! Art is an investment &amp; can B claimed as an office decoration 4 the business. For every new tax law, the rich find ways to hide money! Trump in going after reductions is the first in my lifetime to go after their wealth! Look how they fight him over it! https://t.co/kJZPB9Ip0P
I disagree! Without entreprnuers to invest, many things would not be possible. If the government is to decide, they don't pick things we want, they pick things for us. Most of what the govt runs, doesn't work efficiently &amp; is full of corruption! https://t.co/kJZPB9Ip0P
The big break 2 the big &amp; small corporations, as well as the private &amp; smaller businesses have all added to our economy! Creating jobs and growing! Socialism does not encourage that growth!

Just the other day, Bill Gates of Microsoft made same point I'm making! The impact on the rich using tax tables is little when U just reduce rates. It's when U take away deductibles they start moving to other countries. He proposed taxing captial gains higher. Trump'd like that! https://t.co/bLtgD57BWK
Who doesn't make that in salary! They make a million in salary, but the rest is in stocks &amp; other things that hide their income! How do you think Buffett claims he pays less percentage wise than his secretary! He must take all of his income in stocks &amp; other holdings somehow? https://t.co/JwvhN7USPW
@AshleyMcfarley @ApocalyPatriot LOL, is that something we agree on?  My grandkids would be out of luck, as we stopped using land lines years before I retired.
@AshleyMcfarley @rkinseth @AOC @realDonaldTrump Read what he said. That's the scale, not what they pay? Rich people take millions in deductibles &amp; often hide more in assets like stock that aren't counted until sold! Then usually they apply long-term capital gains of 20%, I believe.
Very true, but according to what I read from an IRS report, 83% of folks in the country were getting more back! That leave the 17% at the top who aren't, but I haven't seen the actual break down! It ain't crumbs though! https://t.co/STzKTi3ai1
True! I guess with my experience, I sort of new enough to add something. Even I am open to questioning that fact though! https://t.co/3YWrxn1ozW
&amp; I am discussing the thought that they aren't paying less taxes just because the tax rate went down a little? They lost quite a few deductions that only benefited the rich! How many average people pay more than 10,000 tax on their homes? How many of them can actually own a home? https://t.co/ibv8mmiVrw

&amp; again, I consider my friend an expert telling me he filed the taxes 4 these people! I'd ask a team 2 look at the filings but can't! Like I said, the IRS should have data on that, but no 1 talks about looking at it! Even courts use expert testimonials! https://t.co/6XsD2oVTqR
U also have 2 beware of reports people place on Google. Like Climate change? Have you ever looked at the real climate change data?

That's another rich ploy! https://t.co/WSAa8mHNi1
My friend is a tax accountant for the rich! He says they actually are paying more. I believe him! I did my own, as I just retired, and I pay about the same, but lost some deductions and would have paid more this year if I hadn't retired. https://t.co/6X6DEtuCXe

Here's an overview on him, and I'd say he'd be called a right wing zealot for sure. His beef was with government &amp; he feared them repealing #2A.  I knew a guy like him in college who was all into guns &amp; wanted 2 go 2 war. https://t.co/lMsOi48DEf https://t.co/0RLkCvqiDq
Interesting stats! https://t.co/SHNL99qZya
The term right wing is often unclear to me. I consider myself a conservative moderate, as I am very creative &amp; open to improvements in life!

I lived in the Chicago area for 22 yrs during my career, &amp; since shootings are considered mass when 4 or more are shot, I never thought of breaking them out like that!

It's sort of funny to me how scientists want to classify things? Anytime my system is motivated up or down, it seems I'm being stimulated. The term depress, is one direction, so we need a different term for up. All I could think of was calling them Exciters! https://t.co/3KDij6306w
Yes, but as always, when someone initiates a discussion of interest with me, I do quick searchs &amp; I find that some research material would indicate it's how much you take.
