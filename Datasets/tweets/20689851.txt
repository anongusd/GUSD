@Richzeoli don't you just find it so damn amusing that ANYONE associated with Washington DC can be charged with making false statements. I always believed the ability to make false statements was a job requirement in that City.
The person who killed #KateSteinle originally told police he was shooting at a seal on the pier. Sadly in California he would have been punished more harshly for that then he will now be for the death of this young lady.
Maybe the justice department should open a civil rights violations case against the individual who killed #KateSteinle. Isn't the right to life the most important civil right we have.
