Delta says last year employees reported increased acts of aggression (barking, growling, lunging and biting) from service and support animals-- "behavior not typically seen in these animals when properly trained and working."
Delta's rules for traveling with service and comfort animals will begin March 1st- documentation required confirming the safety and necessity of the animal 48 hours before departure.
White House Legislative Director Marc Short says @POTUS has been calling both Republican and Democratic Senators today and will continue to throughout the day. Doesn't name names.
TSA says 9 people were arrested at Newark Airport after officers detected a "suspicious item in a carry-on bag." Says members of a tv crew tried to sneak on item that had all the makings of an IED. TSA says others in group "covertly filmed the encounter."

Speaker Ryan says they've made their point very clear. He and other members of House Leadership don't take any questions. #shutdowncountdown
The vote in the House wasn't simple, either. Freedom caucus opposed the bill until around 5-6pm tonight. https://t.co/9hx2KepzPF
Colleen that's not the case in the Senate. 60 votes to pass it. Dems would have to help. https://t.co/9hx2KepzPF
Maybe this isn't new but I'm just starting to see it. GOP lawmakers are pushing # Schumer Shutdown -- it's trending and apparently it's a website too.
House Speaker Paul Ryan calls a government shutdown "risky, reckless and wrong." #shutdowncountdown
Speaker Paul Ryan begins with "Senator Schumer, do NOT shut down the government..."
The short term spending plan just passed would result reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years. It's a health insurance program that helps kids see a doctor. It's a state/fed govt partnership. Some states were running out of $$
Just so it's clear -- the House passing a short term bill doesn't avert a shutdown. The Senate would need to pass it before the President can sign it into law.
US House passes short-term spending plan 230-197. Speaker Ryan will speak at 8p. Bill now moves to the Senate where it's fate is unclear.

Sens. Grassley, Cotton and Perdue on Sens. Flake, Durbin and Graham #immigration plan: "Fails to adequately address border security, enforcement, chain migration and diversity visas." Also, expands "legal status to immigrants who knowingly violated immigration law."
Just watched the Presidential motorcade arrive at the Capitol... it's always a sight to see.. no matter how many times I've seen it.
Republicans and Democrats are blaming each other for careening toward a government shut down. Friday, by Washington standards, is a long time away ... but it sounds like lawmakers are worried it could come to lights out.
Sen. Thune kicks off hearing today on social media and online radicalization -- by talking about the #Orlando night club shooter.

And something I learned from the medical report - the President had an appendectomy when he was 11. #interestingnote
The White House doc says the President would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbs and from a routine exercise regimen.
The White House doc talked with the President about diet, exercise and weight loss. Doctor notes his overall health benefits come from being alcohol and smoke free.
White House Doctor says President Trump's overall health is "excellent." His cardiac performance during exam "very good."

I  missed this earlier - but it makes me laugh. Sen. Lindsey Graham on immigration talks - “If the President is watching, I’m still in the phone book. Don't give out my number but call me." You may recall during campaign, POTUS gave out Graham's cell phone number.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about DACA / Immigration talks: "This has turned into a S-hole." He adds he wants a DACA fix - and he doesn't know how this "movie will end."

Sen. Dick Durbin asks DHS Secretary about the language used in an immigration meeting last week. Nielsen says profanity was used by most people  in the meeting. Durbin asks her if she heard him use profanity. She said no, and that she didn't use it either.
DHS Secretary says DHS is accepting DACA renewals while court battles over ending the program play out. A court ordered the program continue.
DHS Secretary says the President and other lawmakers used "tough language," in the immigration meeting at the White House.

@CNNJustin Beautiful! What a great memory.
After the MLK ceremony, the President left the room quickly. He did not make any comments on the Oval office meeting where he reportedly used the word, "sh**hole." He didn't answer any questions.
Someone just shouted "Mr. President, are you a racist?" as he left the room from signing MLK Day Proclamation.

The FDA says it knows of 36 deaths tied to products containing kratom. More here: https://t.co/sfp83g9YhE
So, currently there are no FDA-approved therapeutic uses of kratom. The FDA's drug review process is still going on.
However, the FDA says if kratom can be used to help treat opioid addiction - "patients deserve to have clear, reliable evidence of these benefits."
FDA says it has to ask whether kratom could expand the opioid epidemic.
@DrewTurner73 @andreatalbot031 From the FDA "To date, no marketer has sought to properly develop a drug that includes kratom."
@andreatalbot031 @DrewTurner73 the FDA says it is concerned how kratom could interact w/ other drugs.
FDA Commissioner acknowledges there's a lot of interest in the possibility for kratom to be used as a potential therapy for a range of disorders.
The FDA says it is working to prevent shipments of kratom from coming into the US. At international mail facilities the FDA has detained "hundreds of shipments."
FDA "While we remain open to the potential medicinal uses of kratom, those uses must be backed by sound-science and weighed appropriately against the potential for abuse."
FDA - before Kratom is legally marketed for therapeutic uses in US - the risks and benefits must be evaluated as part of the regulatory process by the FDA.
From the FDA "There's clear data on the increasing harms associated with Kratom." Agency says calls to poison centers have increased 10-fold from 2010-2015.
FDA says Kratom carries "similar effects to narcotics like opioids, and carried similar risks of abuse, addiction and in some cases, death. #breaking #kratom
The FDA issues a public health advisory about #Kratom. The agency is concerned about "harmful unapproved products..." and "potential safety risks."

@jmsummers and respectfully I'm not shutting anyone down. Everyone's concerns are worth listening to.
@jmsummers I would love to talk more w/ you. As a local reporter - I worked hard to build trust w/ ppl and am damn proud of the job I did.
@jmsummers If a newsroom sends a certain reporter to a story based on anything other than their reporting ability -is dangerous, imo.
@jmsummers I won't experience struggles and life experiences as others - but I recognize that. and I can tell a story even though I'm white
@jmsummers my point is - I know I grew up differently as a white girl. I don't fear being pulled over by police. ... (1/3)
@jmsummers Juana I hear you. I understand you. I think diversity is needed everywhere. School, work, sports teams. Everywhere.
@jmsummers I'm sorry. I should have copy edited. I meant "don't look like me." I agree diversity is needed in a newsroom.
