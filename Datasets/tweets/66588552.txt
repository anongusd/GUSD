There are some losses I am unprepared to accept, that I have still to bear. And yet hope abounds, in life, in love, and in time.
The optimist rebels against what is and reaches mightily for what should be. Optimism requires imagination, determination, and action.
Realism is the assessment of the most likely outcome based on typical behavior & reactions. Optimism is actively creating desired outcomes.
The most hopeful attitude is the one that determines to find possibility in every circumstance, and then works tirelessly towards that end.
The biggest failure is to stop believing in the ability to heal or the ability to create meaningful change.

Hi everyone. Peace and blessings.
This would require loads of cooperation & labor & time but would eliminate landfills, lots of pollution & would make infinitely more sense
Renewables Recycling Company is my brainchild. The idea is on my twitter feed. The 5 bins would be paper, plastic, glass, metals, & compost
The big idea is that if we empower ppl with bins & a system to responsibly dispose of post-consumer refuse we could make $ instead of trash
Why is that not obvious. It is so clear and obvious to me!
If an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure then an min of preparation is worth an hr of backtracking & recycling is $ in the bank
is taking a rest & eating dinner.
And we have successfully saved my kids toy chests and bunkbed from auction. Pray for a successful packing weekend.
