This move is yet another illegal attempt by the Trump Administration to rewrite our nation‚Äôs immigration laws in order to advance an inhumane, anti-refugee agenda. We call on the Administration to immediately rescind this unlawful policy.
Under this new policy, asylum seekers arriving at the United States‚Äô southern border will be forced to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.

Niloufar Khonsari of @PangeaLegal; If we believe in due process in SF, we all must support @SandraLeeFewer's proposal.
Niloufar Khonsari of @PangeaLegal: 3 nonprofits currently handling detained cases strongly support that legislation.
Niloufar Khonsari of @PangeaLegal: @sfdefender has generously offered to scale up services and has the ability to do so.
Ana Herrera of @SFDeportDefense is affirming nonprofit community support for @SandraLeeFewer's legislation to @sfbos Budget &amp; Finance Comm.
.@JeffAdachi of @sfdefender: With 10 new deputy public defenders and 7 support staff - we can make #universalrep a reality.
.@JeffAdachi: It's become clear that @sfdefender office is needed to take on the high volume of detained cases.
.@JeffAdachi: But even with additional resources provided by SF, nonprofits do not have the capacity to take on all detained cases.
.@JeffAdachi: @sfdefender office has met with nonprofits and collaborated on highly successful UAC initiative.
.@JeffAdachi of @sfdefender: Immigration detention facilities are indistinguishable from prisons - and immigrants can be held for yrs.
.@JeffAdachi of @sfdefender is breaking down our shameful nat'l history of scapegoating immigrants &amp; detaining them w/no access to counsel.
.@JeffAdachi to BoS Budget &amp; Finance Comm: There's a huge, vulnerable population that SF is not covering right now - detained immigrants.
This is why Sup @SandraLeeFewer has taken up @DavidCamposSF's legislation to provide @sfdefender with attys to defend detained immigrants.

Joaquin calls on us all to stand up and have our voices heard. We can make a difference, starting right here in SF.
Community member and veteran Joaquin was detained for a yr, 4 mos before he could access legal representation. He's now facing deportation.
.@JeffAdachi: The @sfdefender's office is uniquely well-positioned to provide legal representation to detained immigrants.

To quell this issue, we need #universalrep &amp; we need to recruit more diverse judges incl. those from defense, immigrants' rights communities
Eunice to @IACHRPress: Guidance should be provided for judges on handling particular kinds of claims - gender-based claims, gang claims. https://t.co/lPpbM5j0Ai
Margarette May Macaulay of @IACHRPress "astonished" by asylum adjudication disparities.
Eunice testifies before @IACHRPress on how the immigration courts in Atlanta and Charlotte stack the odds against asylum seekers. https://t.co/ZtvLQul2O0
The commission should investigate immigration courts hostile to asylum seekers and prepare report on disparities in asylum adjudications.
.@IACHRPress should take issue with the astronomically high denial rates in Atlanta, Charlotte, &amp; other US immigration court jurisdictions.
Cases in Charlotte court are not considered on the merits. And Atlanta and Charlotte are just 2 of 5 courts with grant rates of less than 2%
The Charlotte court's reputation is so hostile, attorneys assume their cases will be denied regardless of how strong they are.
In a jurisdiction where most applicants, many women and children, are fleeing horrific violence in Central America, 87% of claims are denied
The Charlotte immigration court meets asylum seekers with "derision, disbelief," refuses to allow certain asylum seekers to apply.
Atlanta judges deny bond to virtually all detained asylum seekers, who are regarded as flight risks in every case contrary to int'l HR norms
Hostility towards asylum seekers is apparent from the moment an applicant enters the courtroom, through visual cues and verbal remarks.
The court provides pro se asylum seekers only 1-2 weeks to submit applications, which must be in English.
The immigration court in Atlanta constricts the ability of asylum seekers to pursue their claims, banning telephonic testimony.
In these jurisdictions, immigration courts have developed subregulatory rules with no basis in rule of law that circumvent right to asylum.
Eunice to @IACHRPress:Immigration courts in what we call "asylum free zones" deny asylum seekers meaningful opportunity to pursue protection
