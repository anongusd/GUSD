@TheOnlyKAVIN We pay for gas and oil so I'm fine with paying for charging my vehicle. If they are smart, those charges will be slightly cheaper than a gallon of gas.
@TheOnlyKAVIN Sorry about my spelling errors but you get what I'm saying.
@TheOnlyKAVIN As you pointed out, the deal doesn't address aircraft, we know they can burn hundreds of gallons per flight.
@TheOnlyKAVIN We could install 1 row of charging pumps at 100 mile increments. New technology allows full charges in minutes.
@TheOnlyKAVIN I don't think many truly comprehend the crisis that we are in. The Oil, Chemical and Animal Farming must be significantly reduced and in a hurry. I'm fine with working 24/7 to get solar wind  and electric power moving light speed ahead. Auto plants can turn out electric vehicles.
@TheOnlyKAVIN Exactly
@TheOnlyKAVIN I don't think they understand that it will take time and a lot of effort to covert from oil and gas to solar and elect. Al these ideas are possible but it will only happen quickly if we have Democrats controlling the House, Senate, Governorships. The majority must participate.
@TheOnlyKAVIN The Green New Deal is a great start but they don't or won't address the big Animal Farming aspect of our Climate Change crisis. They don't seem to understand that the Republicans have controlled just about everything for the past 20 years.

@Blueequus775 @EkbMary @amusing2me Many of us have had it with the toxic Chemical companies and the barbaric Animal farmers. Death and destruction for money.
@Real_John_Awen As a woman of faith, I‚Äôll never understand how the religious organizations twisted the book of Genesis in so many directions. We were never to kill and destroy animals. We are to protect, provide and care for them.
