It's all part of our commitment to advancing public-private partnerships that tackle affordable housing and homelessness — and actively opposing federal funding cuts. Read NLC's full statement online: https://t.co/hvtOeJzsVt
We're honored to join @OppStartsatHome's fight for lasting change — alongside fellow steering committee members like @NLIHC, @NEAToday, @NAACP, and more.
These issues aren't just touching a few cities. As @CouncilmanBMS says, “Housing affordability, supply and homelessness are among the top priorities for cities in every population category above 50,000."
And as @Mike_Koprowski points out, “When people lack access to decent affordable housing, it negatively impacts their health outcomes, educational attainment, and ability to climb the economic ladder.”
In America, as NLC President @LittleRockMayor has said, “there’s not a single city, county or state where a worker earning minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom rental by working a standard 40-hour week.”
Every city resident should have the opportunity to live in safe, decent and affordable housing. In our work serving communities across the country, we've seen how this issue affects cities large and small. https://t.co/Ps7s0lNkRN

@SafeRoutesNow A5 Identify and convert vacant or underutilized lots or city parkland for purposes of growing food, processing, distribution and sale; build social networks and local capacity to increase access to fresh food and vegetables. #MoveEquity
@SafeRoutesNow Cities can establish zoning regulations and/or ordinances to address the safety      and aesthetics of the physical environment, street continuity and connectivity, access to community gardens and urban agriculture, and other recreation facilities #MoveEquity
@SafeRoutesNow Many cities have partnerships with Youth Corps, directly connecting teens and young adults to nature and green career fields. Young people gain experience in fields such as conservation and urban agriculture that address public issues like workforce development #MoveEquity
@SafeRoutesNow A4 Children and families are more likely to use parks if they perceive it is safe to get there. Sidewalks, pedestrian signals, clear signage, bike lanes, and the availability of nearby public transportation can help improve accessibility. #MoveEquity
@SafeRoutesNow Strategies that note lower rates of physical activity as a contributor to childhood obesity, without acknowledging inequitable access to safe parks w/ affordable, vibrant programming will not create better outcomes for communities of color. #MoveEquity
Without stable housing, young people are much more likely to experience a host of negative and traumatic experiences, including arrest and detention in the justice system. Learn more: https://t.co/A8W8WvU94Y
