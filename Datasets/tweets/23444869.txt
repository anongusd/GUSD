Become a fan of the Farm Bureau food checkout.  Money goes to Ronald MrDonald house.  http://bit.ly/aIBGkd
At least no fist pumps from Farve today. Go Saints.
Debate seems to have gone well for KBH last evening.  The race has started.We simply must have new leadership in Texas.
Governor is weaseling around on Eminent Domain, compnsation critical for land owners. He is not truthfull on ED.
Hutchison taking control of debate. New Leadership for Texas.
At repub debates. Medina supports abolishing medicare. Real conservative in debate.
Great show by Monsanto and other sponsors at AFBF awards show.
Just won a John Deere cap a their booth#afbf10
sitting at the Monsanto booth at afbf convention in Seattle  #afbf10
I am now following peteandorville,  providing farm equipement for farmers and ranchers.  A long way from Texas, but in business anyway.
I am the Legislative Director for Tx FB. Certainly understand your plight. Hope things improve next year.
Had a great xmas. Kindle is king. But Lara being home is extra special. Happy Holidays.
Will try.
Highlight of TXFB Annual meeting will be the keynote presentation by Kay Bailey Hutchison, next Governor of Texas.  Can't wait.
Attended a major water conference in Ft.Worth last week.  Texas must prepare for growth, and more water needs.  Investment in future of Tex.
Working
"I am Ted Houghton, the most arrogant commissioner of the most arrogant state agency in the history of the State of Texas", unbelievable !

RT @TxCriMjr: gonna get rained on before I get back to the cat...? thunder to the near west.   Great rains in south Texas, told not too late
Hope rains in South Texas have not come too late.  Lots of grass needed between now and Winter.  Afraid not much time for growth.
RT @foxnews: THE SPEAKER'S LOBBY  Wilson action a reflection on all R's¬†... http://tinyurl.com/mryb7j
Hope the rains in the Valley and South Texas are helping break the drought a little.  It may be too late for a lot of pasture growth.
RT @TxAgPRGuy: Boy do we have a drought in South TX - See the latest in this TX Farm Bureau Video - http://bit.ly/EWXio Critical to Texas.
Lt. Governor Dewhurst running for reelection is a surprise.  Wonder  if he might change his mind, if dominoes fall differently?

In Lubbock to hear Cong. Frank Lucas. Sure to hear about Climate Change legislation and impacts on farmers and agriculture.
Headed to DC for weekend and free enterprise students next week. Looking forward to appointments.
@KXAN_News Unfortunately doing so without consideration of Eminent Domain reform legislation.  A most unfriendly state.
@Frantu1 Hope you enjoy using this new system.  Have a Happy 4th.
http://bit.ly/oQUp9  Congressman Chet Edwards visited with FB leaders prior to making his decision on the Climate Change bill.  We thank hm
Climate vote, surprised at some yes votes from Texas. Hope they got a lot from the Admin or leadership. Senate now critical.
So sorry Texas lost again.
@JPlovesCOTTON  I went on the Cotton Inc. website, but could not find how Cotton balls are made.  Like for makeup etc.  I know,Sounds silly.
@AgEditor  Markup this week, in Senate Environment and Public Works  Committee.  Agriculture must be heard on this issue.  Keep navigabl ...
@JPlovesCOTTON  Do you know how cotton balls are made.  That has been a major point of discussion today.  Hope you can help.
@tdanews Thanks for speaking up.
Absolutely critical that more Eminent Domain reforms be made.  Texas property owners are suffering because of our statutes
Ecstatic over Gov announcement of special session.  Eminent Domain reform must  be a part of that call.  Texans deserve no less.
@KXAN_News  It is extremely disappointing that once again, the Legislature has failed to update our antiquated Eminent Domain law.  Pitiful
@KXAN_News Thanks very much.  Will wait with baited breath.  Rumors  are not much news to be reported.  Will wait and see.  Thanks for help.
@KXAN_News   Will you be covering live.  Farm Bureau is extremely interested in Eminent Domain.
@duanejsimpson You and I are in the same boat,  I am on twitter, but not a regular contributor.
This has been the most frustrating Legislative Session in many years.  Failure of Eminent Domain is a major disappointment.  Pitiful display
Eminent Domain in Texas House tomorrow. Critical vote for property owners tomorrow, then hope for Gov signature this time.
@allaboard2009 Will be interesting to see yields this year.  Rains not exactly right in many areas
Thanks to Senator KBH, Congressional Gold Medal for WASP,is possibility.  Now on to US House.  American hero is Nicole Malachowski
Great award for Sen Hutchison. Navy Distinguished Service Award., another recipient Chet Edwards.  Both deserving Texans.
Midwest can always catch up in a hurry.  We need the markets however.
@WorldWideAg How far south are you?  Know that the Valley is extremely dry, about to lose crops except for irrigation.
@JPlovesCOTTON We have had good rainfall in central texas.  Crops are looking good.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  Need sunshine.
Steve Pringle has changed his username from springletxfborg to TXFBlobby.
Farm Bureau goal of repeal of TTC corridor language reached in the Sunset bill.  Now goes to the Senate.
TxDOT Sunset bill up today, over 300 amendments. Hope the Kolkhorst amdt's can get added.  Need to put TTC to rest;plus more accountability.
Many of the so-called supporters of eminent domain let the impossible get in the way of the possible.  Do the possible not the perfect.
@JGarciaReports You did a great job on the report.  Good coverage, hope farm bureau can help again some time.
Don't drink the tea
At home withy the Erblands in Rochester.  ABout to watch the Masters,followed by Easter dinner.  Home to Texas tomorrow.
In upstate NY, Rochester for Easter services. They say I talk funny.
Looks like a positive article in DMN. Agriculture needs all the positive news possibe.
About to order some C&W Cd's.  Suggestions appreciated for best  Brooks and Dunn and Sugarland albums.  Thanks.
Anyone with an agriculture history in DC remembers Hyde Murray, who died last Friday.  He was an institution in Ag. law, and a dear friend.
If travel to Cuba is opened.  There will be a flood of Americans to the tiny island.  The Embargo is an idea whose time has gone.
Critical week for Eminent Domain. Must be out of cmte by Friday. Otherwise just like last time.
Trade is a nonstarter in Congress. But hopefully Cuba can be an exception, lift travel restrictions.
Just got Cuba trade update. 25th trading partner at this time. Politics holding us back
@foxnews Pretty much trashes cotton.  Everyone wants to be energy independent except when it impacts their industry.  Interesting.
Back in Waco, completing scheduling for DC trip.  Lack appointments with only 4 members to the TX delegation.  Will be a fun week.
Listening to Eminent Domain testimony. All support but different versions. Some prettier than others.
Planning DC trip for next week.
@mattfelder Have a safe trip.  At least you have good weather.
@capitalpress Obviously, commodity prices have no impact on food prices or the index would have gone down significantly.
Just put daughter on Flight to Angola, 15 hours nonstop.  not a fun 5 days.
We certainly need to get some traction on the immigration issue in DC.  It is critical that employers have a workable guest worker program.
Looking forward to the Steer sale in Houston this weekend.  Preparing for the Farm Bureau trip to DC in a couple of weeks.
