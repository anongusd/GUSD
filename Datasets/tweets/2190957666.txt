@prof_gabriele @AuschwitzMuseum Your tweet seems to be discounting the good ones, just because there were bad ones. #twitterstorian indeed. Auschwitz was a German Nazi camp in occupied Poland. Why do you have a problem with calling it that way?
@prof_gabriele @AuschwitzMuseum Did you notice this bit in the link you posted: "helping a Jew in occupied Poland was punishable by death. Yad Vashem has identified more rescuers from Poland than any other country—6,532." So yes, there were bad Poles and there were good Poles.

@costareports I'm hoping @SpeakerPelosi's team has already made or is working on a plan of what to do when that happens, including a list of who are potential allies and who will stand with the president till the end. Yes, "when." I think we're all past the "if" phase, don't you?
@Je5usaurus_Rex @OMETA16 @HelenKennedy @ManMet80 I'm hoping there'd still be some US troops that would not follow orders, but then again, I'm not too optimistic.
@CharlesPPierce It just might be. If you're Steve Bannon, or follow his advice.  https://t.co/VYxt65eoRZ
@JeffFlake Love your ratio, Flake. I hope your advisors have told you by now that you're a total joke.
@BillKristol So... just theoretically, looking at this @TheAtlantic article, what do you think would happen if Trump decided to arrest all opposition? Will there be soldiers, agents, or police who refuse or will they all just follow the orders. https://t.co/utdzTAQdWZ
@BillKristol I hoping there is someone, anyone, left in the DOD, DOJ, Pentagon or Secret Service who will at the right moment say "no" instead of resigning and save the country.

@BCharmer @darnelldepalma1 @Julia_Kline @shannonrwatts Agreed. Father is definitely the more guilty party and should be charged with child abuse.
@brianschatz I think the last two words really should be "Russian Puppet", though yes, I know that's his official title.
@BCharmer @darnelldepalma1 @Julia_Kline @shannonrwatts Yes, he was brought up this way. And so was his father, most likely. And so were his grandfathers, most possibly. "He's just a child" only sends na message to every teen (especially white teen) out there that they're not responsible for their actions. Let's stop that.
@BCharmer @darnelldepalma1 @Julia_Kline @shannonrwatts "Love" isn't necessarily about rape. It's weird how everyone's mind goes immediately to the sexual act. He showed no mercy to the woman he killed. He deserves to be punished, however that will come about.
@crankyoldbag @mysticrose29 @AnnMcMD @Thedangerpost @shannonrwatts Sigh. Yes.
@realDonaldTrump Go. Leave. And never come back. #TrumpResign
@IngrahamAngle yes
@mysticrose29 @AnnMcMD @Thedangerpost @shannonrwatts It's a thin line - how do you teach right from wrong, while also making sure benefit of the doubt doesn't go too far and allows a kid to commit crimes? I don't know.
@mysticrose29 @AnnMcMD @Thedangerpost @shannonrwatts With the kids, I wonder what kind of support that kid's school had and could offer, other than detention. I doubt this was his first violent action. They probably have seen him lose it before.
@mysticrose29 @AnnMcMD @Thedangerpost @shannonrwatts How do you make a dad who doesn't think there's anything wrong with him to attend a program, though?
@snowflake33470 @shannonrwatts I do worry about what I do in my own life.
@snowflake33470 @shannonrwatts My comment wasn't supposed to be amusing. I'm sorry about your suffering in the past. I hope your life is better now. I hope the kid's life turns around. The father deserves to rot. He had no compassion for the woman, I have no compassion for him.

@vorodecky @shannonrwatts In the meantime, I hope more people will boycott advertisers of Tucker Carlson and everyone else crying that there's a war on men.
@FikeMartin @shannonrwatts I hope you react the same way when you hear your fellow males talk shit about women.
@vorodecky @shannonrwatts Yes, I'm sure he was abused, and I do hope he'll end up in a place that will help him change. People do change. He is and always be a murderer, though.
@AnnMcMD @Thedangerpost @shannonrwatts How do we do that, though, when the media and the society constantly keep excusing behavior like that, when true rapists are let go free "because their future," when women are ignored when they ask for help, and when some media whine there's a war on men.

@VoteSnoopy2020 @malinablue @Ocasio2018 She also has a brokerage account that might have between $1,001 to $15,000 in it. It doesn't say she has $15K. She could very well have just $1,002.
@VoteSnoopy2020 @malinablue @Ocasio2018 Looks like she has a checking account that might have between $15,001 to $50,000. It doesn't say she has $50K. $50K is the upper limit on that particular check off box.
@VoteSnoopy2020 @malinablue @Ocasio2018 How about you do a bit of research. Looks like the outlets talking about her bank account are Fox News and Daily Wire. Fox did link to her financial statement form: https://t.co/XpQh6ZZ9zr

@aurabogado etc, etc... to see the rest of questions go to: https://t.co/rVptBMcK1I
@aurabogado Q7: How many amendments does the Constitution have?	A7: blink, blink, blink..... I like the second amendment people. The first, not so much. We'll see. Maybe we can change some of the amendments. That's what my lawyers are saying.
@aurabogado Q6: What is one right or freedom from the First Amendment?	A6: First Amendment should be abolished. Everyone is saying this. The first amendment people, the fake news people, they are so rude, and so stupid. They ask such stupid questions. Terrible people all of them.
@aurabogado Q5: What do we call the first ten amendments to the Constitution?	A5: blink, blink, blink .... I had the biggest crows at my inauguration, did you know that? I won in a landslide. I'm the best president in the entire history of the United States.
@aurabogado Q4: What is an amendment?	A4: If you ask me, the first amendment is the worst. It's just harassment. Very unpatriotic and rude, but the one about birthright citizenship, which one was it, it doesn't matter, is just as bad. I will change that.
@aurabogado Q3: The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the Constitution. What are these words?	A1: I don't think the first amendment is all that good, if you ask me. Fake News, all of them, well, almost all of them. Very unpatriotic.
@aurabogado Q2: What does the Constitution do?	A1: The second amendment is the most important amendment of all. Second amendment people love me and I love them. NRA too. Good people, all of them. The rest of the constitution? I can change it with an executive order if I'd like to.
@aurabogado LOL, let's try to imagine. 		Q1: What is the supreme law of the land?	A1: Oh, don't call me the supreme leader quite yet. I do expect loyalty. Loyalty is very important to me. Do you swear to be loyal?

@Black_Kettle @ChuckWendig @CharlesFinch Dudes like this one are the reason why many women will look at YOU as a potential rapist even though you're a decent guy and walk away from you as fast you can if you try to strike up a conversation if there are no other people around.

@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn That'd be nice. One way to do it - elect more women and if you vote for guys, make sure they're decent people.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn The ideal would be a world in which men are not assholes, but it ain't happening, so women have to take matters in their own hands and start being total bitches.
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @LadyRobe @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Why would I want to hide my gun and lose a few precious seconds to defend myself if I can have a gun out in the open (especially if I'm in my own house)? Unless, of course, I were well trained in retrieving my gun from whatever pocket I put it in.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn And yeah, voting. Let's vote the bastards out in November.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn And letting all the public figures and media know what we think of their articles, songs, movies, and ads that demean women and treat them as objects to be looked at and taken instead of as human beings.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Another would be to fight as hell against schools who penalize girls for wearing tights or shorts to school because that's "too distracting."
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn One would be to stop buying stuff that promotes "be a good girl and learn how to be attractive" attitude, which basically means not buying most of the "for women" magazines.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Yeah, the government totally failed at this on Saturday. It's a long process, unfortunately.
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @LadyRobe @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn I can just imagine a guy's reaction when a woman selling something opens the door with her gun out, saying "I'm sure you're a good guy, but just in case, I'll be walking behind you with my gun loaded and pointed at you in case you try anything funny."
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn And yeah, I know my profile photo is a pink anemone, but I chose it not for the color but because it's an anemone.
@essefftee @dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Yes, men act how they damn well please, but I still think women shouldn't be afraid of being bitches whenever they please. Let's stop raising wallflowers. (Don't even get me started on Barbie movies and the whole overwhelming tendency to make everything pink.)
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @LadyRobe @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Or perhaps you'll just tell her "How about I move it to my place and sell it for you? Then you won't have to deal with letting strangers into your house." Are you going to do this for each of your single female friends?
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @LadyRobe @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Or better yet, if you hear of any of your female friends talk about selling a dryer on Craigslist you'll tell her "How about I hang out at your house in case one of the people who stop by to buy it is a creep?"
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @LadyRobe @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn So if any of your single female acquaintances say, "Hey, Dustin, I'm trying to sell [name piece of furniture or an appliance], and have to let people in the house to see it. Will you hang out at my place in case any creeps come" you will totally reply with "Absolutely!" Right?
@dusdg @alivioschmidt @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Well, if you read the whole thread, the police ARE involved. Meanwhile, SaraSuze is terrified to be home alone because of this creep, while plenty of guys bemoan the fact that women look at every man like a potential rapist.
@dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn The problem is, women are raised to be nice. We gotta teach girls to dare say "I told you to come at x time, you're 15 minutes late. Get lost."
@dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn Or would you say women simply should not be walking alone anywhere, especially at night, because you're a good guy, but who knows who she might come across in her evening walks?
@dusdg @tragedythyme @bby_J_ @SnyderElena @IanSpeed2 @gzn And the guy would probably have said "Gee, lady, talk about being paranoid." Be honest, how would you react if a woman walking toward you at dusk down an empty street crossed the street to avoid walking past you? You'd probably think she's overreacting.
@stevensky @IanSpeed2 @gzn @tragedythyme @beatmasterJLS Yes. Likewise, the location of the dryer isn't the issue.

@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes So yes, to people who value education and knowledge libraries are most certainly worth our taxes. Libraries are worthless only to people who'd rather live in a society, where only the rich have access to knowledge, and everyone else is dumb, uneducated, and ignorant.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes And thanks to tax-funded libraries, everyone, no matter their income, has access to knowledge and education.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Summarizing, all the costs of having a Netflix account, magazine and newspaper subscriptions, books from Amazon, and so on, added up together would come to be much more than an average person pays in taxes toward town library's budget.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Netflix subscription is now $11 a month = $132 per year = more than an average person pays in taxes toward a library's budget.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Most libraries have story time for kids, lego groups, and other activities that help preschoolers learn to socialize and help moms to connect with other moms. Amazon stores do not offer that.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Many libraries offer free access to https://t.co/gHXilWW1i1. A paid subscription costs $25 a month = annual subscription costs more than an average person pays in taxes toward library budget.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Access to computers and computer tutorials is an invaluable resource - all that someone needs to improve one's skills is a desire to learn and time.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Some libraries offer free access to computers where people can learn software necessary to find office work - Word, Excel, and so on. Some might even have Adobe software installed.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Many libraries also have job seekers' groups where those who are looking for a job, by choice or by unfortunate circumstances can practice interviewing, have their resume reviewed, learn about opportunities in other fields, and so on.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Libraries also offer a variety of free programs to help people connect. In addition to book clubs, there are also language groups, knitting groups, game groups, craft groups, and any other groups that residents would like to create.
@PMourdoukoutas @BardIonson @lyndztanica @Forbes Yes, the libraries most definitely are worth our tax dollars. In addition to access to unlimited number of books for between $50 to $80 a year, patrons also get access to movies, music CDs, newspapers, and magazines.
@FoxNews Tsk, tsk, Fox. Don't you know you're supposed to call them "very fine people"? The president said so. What's the matter? Not ready to call for a country-wide annihilation of the Jewish race? You don't seem to have problems with vilifying other groups.

@Sarah_Smarsh @FoxNews Who'd be doing the regulating of social media for social responsibility though - the companies that run them or the users?
@Sarah_Smarsh Looks like being able to recognize propaganda is becoming more and more important as well - selective reporting, the use of vocabulary and imagery to stir certain emotions, and so on.
@Sarah_Smarsh But I don't know if those programs include just info about different branches of the government, or if they also teach critical thinking to be able to read between the lines, and the importance of looking at different sources of information.
@Sarah_Smarsh Washington state seems to have civic education in their standards as well. https://t.co/mPCZS5fBEb
@Sarah_Smarsh It looks like Massachusetts passed a bill that originally included civics education as a graduation requirement, but that was eventually taken out. https://t.co/1h2yTHtf8n
@Sarah_Smarsh To restore and implement good civics education we'd need either a national or state policy. I suppose local (through school committees) might be doable as well, but that should be at least in the state educational standards.
@danpfeiffer @SpeakerRyan He probably hasn't heard - that's his standard reply to anything happening - there are a lot of things happenings, he can't possibly know about everything that's going on.

@drogon_dracarys @emptywheel Sounds like your'e saying one Australian knows more about howe the US electoral system works than dozens of highly-trained Russian operatives. Sorry, but I don't buy that. Still reading the indictment, though.
@drogon_dracarys @emptywheel I'm on page 8. I think the GRU, collectively, is much smarter than Assange. After all, the US elections have been run the same way for years, and they've been watching and analyzing for years.

@drogon_dracarys @emptywheel Thanks! Clearly I have a bit more researching and reading to do. Wikileaks means Assange, right? And he wouldn't have known that either, unless Stone told him, and Stone admitted he communicated directly with Trump and nobody else. The rabbit hole is indeed deep.
@joshgerstein @dsamuelsohn I don't see anything wrapping up until Mueller announces who the known US conspirators are and who the congressman who asked for dirt on the opponent is. And they still need to find out the unknown conspirators.
@drogon_dracarys @emptywheel I don't get the comment about releasing things before the convention. Can anyone explain? What was released before the convention?
