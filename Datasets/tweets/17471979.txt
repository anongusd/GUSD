what a fleshy pillow for this leopard- Hosanna? wow, this is indeed #safarilive
it is in the social structure of hyenas; and it also happens in other group animals- like herds of elephants are led by females too #safarilive https://t.co/nbzk2vM5C1
how will the hyena cubs meet their new friend? genitalia inspection is key when hyenas meet and helps to establish status among hyenas; here we see the two hyenas perform that act #safarilive
the aftershow is looking great; please keep following the live twitter feed on this link: https://t.co/p2h1cbTeaM #safarilive
the migration is a continuous journey; they move from Ngorongoro to Serengeti to Masai Mara and back; therefore the cycle is there all year and they keep moving https://t.co/y47JOIfUTt

yes indeed they have great memory #safarilive https://t.co/gvOYWu57yn
yes they often line up when moving and crossing the rivers; but often when they are calving or feeding casually on the plains, they will split and spread out. But they try to remain in close proximity of their herds; https://t.co/PLveSjvXMH

yes indeed, they are very good hunters and often kill their own prey; https://t.co/UR804DuxHj
this show is looking great and we still have more than an hour today, including the aftershow. Kindly keep following the show on this link: https://t.co/8GS6jLQSUs #safarilive

much appreciated for joining us on yet another amazing show; we shall be here next week- same place and same time. See you all soon, for the grand finale of the Gauntlet #safarilive
great to see the lions playing on the aftershow here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD; play helps these cubs gain the skills they will need in future to kill their prey and also fight off enemies; #safarilive
often they roar at night; to advertise their territories and communicate with fellow members of the pride; males have a deeper roar than females.... please keep following the show here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/dCuYCvVnHd
not unless they die from other reasons, they will reach the peak at 5 years old, then live up to 10 years old or more; so most die after 10 years. Often around 13 years... the show is still live here: https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/c9skaELyei
it is possibly due to the difference in time zones; let's hope to see more of that lion action:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/uGhvzP9Xmp
much welcome; the show goes on here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/cIJYsMGwLT
much welcome to the aftershow; yes indeed this is looking very exciting... the show goes on here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/65NddQd3DZ
the lions' peak age is at 5-10 years; then most will die soon after that- males often dying from fights with other males..... the amazing aftershow goes on here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/Ue4PQAHFzT
they mostly hunt every  days or so; but when food is plenty, they can hunt once or twice daily.... keep enjoying the show here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/hj3DCRWIOy
let's share awareness about the plight of wildlife among our communities. If we help everyone appreciate wildlife, they will work to cause less harm to wildlife. You can also follow the Nat Geo grants program to start a project to save wildlife;  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/SmXfUnF8A9
much welcome to the Gauntlet; please follow the amazing aftershow on this link:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/UTd2aoOgDX
we do not have wild tigers in Africa; so it is not easy to predict how they would react- very interesting thought indeed..... please keep following the show here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/bH9S2bFhS1
not seen them cross at night, they mostly cross to reach grass on the other side of the river- so they do it when grazing during the day..... More of the aftershow continues here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/3SJw9cZe5A
yes, you are very right- they can see well during the night; please keep following the show here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/TtBdxAiXsi
yes, they can bear up to 6 young; please keep following the aftershow here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/QcGlVZwgH2
yes they are able to see in a spectrum that is different from ours; they are able to differentiate the main shades of colour and thus can distinguish black and white stripes well.... keep following the action here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/HZT4aG6lcH
yes the elephant is much stronger than the hippo.... please keep following the aftershow on this link:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/XWbjEpSs9J
most lions are fully independent by 5 years; and by that time we call them full adults. .... the show goes on here:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/wcqFwct64i
it has been a great show; please enjoy the aftershow- we are hoping to see more action:  https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/hdbeD7tno1
you could say adult males are the biggest real threat- when a pride is attacked by visiting males who want to take over, the cubs will almost always die from the fight or get killed by the new males; the show goes on here: https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD https://t.co/U2uKgvQIrL
not many animals will help others during attacks; most times the help will come from members of the same species e.g. buffaloes help their colleagues; so for the hippo it is unlikely but definitely in the wild nothing is impossible. We have seen hippos chase predators from water https://t.co/j3BiBxXLe7
yes, some prides are small and can be satisfied by one wildebeest. Large prides will often hunt more than one wildebeest or even go for larger prey- like Cape Buffalo; https://t.co/fRWKmh2eB0
the Gauntlet continues here: https://t.co/bFiG3WPTuD; please keep following the action for the next one hour; #safarilive
the migration happens all year round; the herds are moving in a more cyclic style all year- they are more active around the Masai Mara (the scenes we are seeing) from July to October; there are also some months they are active in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Conservation Area; https://t.co/PjbhzVp0iG
much appreciated for joining us on this great 1 hour show; please note that we shall be having yet another 1 hour of overtime- the aftershow. Kindly follow the show on this link and let us keep interacting for the next hour, right here: https://t.co/NjvBYvnauq #safarilive
hyenas often have a better attack strategy, where they mob their enemies and prey. Hyenas also have much stronger jaws; https://t.co/6rTxugvGbi
The gauntlet continues here! Safari guides follow the cat saga from the Kruger and Maasai Mara. https://t.co/7lvADBwF4U
this is a common feature in the lion prides; and often break-away females will remain within the territory of the main pride. We have some large prides here in the Mara where a few females live at part of their territory and other members of their pride occupy another part; https://t.co/QPKV2BLLWJ
much appreciated, we are also having an amazing show indeed- this is a great episode https://t.co/NmGTTxTz1t
in the Masai Mara, where we saw the Black Rhinos, we do not have another species of rhino; we however have Southern White Rhinos in some conservancies that are outside the Masai Mara itself; https://t.co/52wxP31S2u
this is not likely for live hippos, because in fact hippos often kill crocodiles. But when hippos die, crocodiles and vultures (sometimes even lions and hyenas) will often scavenge on the free carcass; https://t.co/XpvljRoNDM
yes, lions are able to judge distance between them and prey. They have something called "chase distance", which they must calculate well before they can attack; this is the distance between the lion and the prey before they start a chase. If not well calculated, they often fail https://t.co/BQYneqOZRQ
there are only about 5,000-5,500 Black Rhinos left in the wild; they are indeed endangered and need all our help to keep surviving; https://t.co/wByw4FMo8V
from our observations, rhinos are much faster than elephants; and also rhinos are smaller and thus more agile; https://t.co/1SBogYkdxp
indeed that action between the Black Rhino and the Savannah Elephant was amazing; this is something we do not see each day here in Africa. Just how amazing can this episode get? #safarilive
it is very rare for lions to target the three top herbivores/ pachyderms- elephant, rhino and hippo. However, we know they often attack and kill young ones; with most attacks happening at night. This is often done by large and strong prides; https://t.co/vpDVxkAI4j
hunting practice starts when the cubs are playing (as young as under 1 year). Play helps them strengthen muscles and practice killer moves they need later in life. But the accurate hunting rehearsals will often start after 2 or 3 years, depending on the size of the pride; https://t.co/426BQPvWqy
time for the magical wildebeest river crossing, this is indeed the most exciting part of the Masai Mara migration; what a congested crossing point? will some not make it across the river? #safarilive
it is not easy to state the accurate number, but during this time of the year- from July to October; many prides will often kill almost daily. When the food amounts lower, and the wildebeests move south towards Tanzania, most prides will kill every few days (often around 3 days) https://t.co/8wyOiLifh5
this is unlikely when she is alive and healthy; often take overs for pretty much all predators will happen when the reigning queen or king is either relatively old/ weak or after their death; https://t.co/VeHA8WKZxv
Much welcome to the Gauntlet, please follow the live show stream on this link: https://t.co/NjvBYvnauq for the next two hours (1 hour of the main show, and the extra hour we all love- the aftershow) #safarilive

Nice to see a young elephant; they virtually have no predators and often will live to maturity. However, sometimes we see lions attack the herds at night and they are capable of killing young elephants #safarilive

Once again we have a nice African Darter in view at sunrise. Often called the "snake bird", they love to eat fish - which they dart using their long beaks #safarilive
a beautiful sunrise, and a good Hippo to say hello to. Hippos are the third largest land mammals on the continent. We are hoping for some more of the elephant action next... #safarilive
Can you spot the leopard? https://t.co/ZYLg7B29L1
very nice to see that amazing Leopard camouflage; the rosettes on the coat make it very hard to tell the shape of a cat in the wild savannah. They break the outline of the body and that helps with camouflage #safarilive

they occur in forests of West Africa, and yes they are different- much smaller than Bush Elephants; #safarilive https://t.co/cqLlr5feYP
Will we see the Hyena cub? or maybe not? let's wait and see.... #safarilive

the Spotted Hyenas bear up to 4 cubs each time; and they are temporarily blind at birth. They however grow very fast,  #safarilive https://t.co/I2ojybmUmR

yes the Cheetah is the fastest mammal on the continent; in metric the maximum speed is 112 km/hr. This is about 70 mph. They however can only maintain that speed for a very short time, then they get exhausted, #safarilive https://t.co/usWvQxYrzi
at the moment the African Elephant has been split into two: the Bush/ Savanna Elephant and the Forest Elephant. I would rank all elephants that live in deserts under the Bush Elephant category,  #safarilive https://t.co/8LQmhEqPjj
very nice to see the Hyena cubs, and see their very dark coat. These are going to grow into the future of their clan, and will get spotted coats as they mature. Spotted Hyenas are indeed great hunters, and do not always depend on scavenging #safarilive
yes I would agree the full grown Rhino will be bigger. Males of full grown White Rhinos can be massive, and indeed the White Rhino is the second largest land mammal on the African continent; the Hippo is smaller than the Rhino, #safarilive https://t.co/erGg5NhXuF
