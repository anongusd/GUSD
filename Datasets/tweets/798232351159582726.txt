@realDonaldTrump Would any of this happen if your appointees were in the office. If you declare war against banks and investors when the time comes no one will step in because of regulations. Something must be done #AxeDoddFrank one of the worst laws in history.
@realDonaldTrump This is exactly what I said in my previous tweets. The #DoddFrank rules have removed liquidity so crashes like this will happen. We have to get rid of regulations so banks and people can provide liquidity. CFTC/SEC have to stop this war on investors.
@realDonaldTrump Given the Russian WHunt and the amount of resources being wstd wldn't it be fair to hold the ones who strtd this acctbl. So you have to go through years of this nonsense but when proven that this was nthng but a waste the ones who started this go their merry way!
@realDonaldTrump Need the markets and economy to be in great shape for the midterm elections. We need to get rid of burdensome Obama era regulations. #DoddFrank is the worst for capital movement, Cannot have Sec/cftc wage war against liquidity providers. This leads to crashes.
