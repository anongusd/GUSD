@joshgreenman Better than most takes on most things.
Serial killers can have friends who are alive. Just saying.
@DavidKlion "I don't know much about X and thus try to avoid tweeting about it" should get its own Oscar.
@emorwee See @Noahpinion as well.
@AmandaMarcotte I know this may sound a bit extreme, but here's a modest proposal for all media editors: how about you don't assign *any* men to write about these women? Let's try that for a few months and see what happens. At the very least, a worthwhile experiment.
@IlseThompson @AOC Makes you wonder about all the other "common" things they know and don't tell us about.
@LizYohnRN @ReproJobs Hi there. Not sure what you mean. I just typed abortion and clicked on Best Match, and all the jobs using that word come up first. We don't have a "what you really mean..." thing at all, nowhere on the site.
@ProductHunt Larry/Sergey, Michael Dell, and Bezos, for all the obvious reasons.
Would be great to meet you if you can make it! https://t.co/RkBJIApmbH
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress Such a great conversation between two intelligent people. Thank you.
@joshgreenman Great question, actually. Thinking...
@schraubd @PopChassid Yes!
@Elizrael Yes to all that. Plus I am curious about Nir Barkat. (I've known him since he was 20 years old, I think he is a dangerous pyromaniac, but also rich, strategic, and hardworking. I won't be surprised if he surprises, though I'd prefer he didn't.)
@BIFMCovers Love that! Thanks!
Who do you look up to in the nonprofit world? Who are some of the people you most respect and admire?
@derek_mafs @ChristinaRoseSB @AOC Bulls and horses are pretty strong. They don't eat meat, last I checked.
@PopChassid You, in the TImes :) https://t.co/0RNu0ujdS9
If a government—any government—doesn't allow its citizens to tweet freely, should Twitter allow that government to tweet freely?
@mashagessen Just wonderful.
@wrightr Summer!
@saikatc @AOC How do you guys have enough time in the day to read all the stories about you? :)
@PresentOccupant Not as of now, but thanks for the prompt!
@kmo6241 It's "drivel" - unless you are talking basketball.
Always a bit shocking: a million seconds is about 10 days. A billion seconds is 30 YEARS. Not to be confused :)
@_Ash_Moss_ @AOC It always blows people away when you tell them that a million seconds is about 10 days, but a billion seconds is 30 YEARS.
@allegra_lynn And that is YOU, my dear :)
@Georgepowley1 @AOC Nah. In her district, she can stay for 50 years if she wants to.
This, by the Spanish cartoonist José María Nieto, is wonderful, and applies to 2019, or to any year:	"I don't see any reason to be optimistic. What do you think the new year will bring us?" 	"I believe it will bring flowers." 	"Really? Why?" 	"Because I am planting flowers." https://t.co/UJtwT5IAFb
@wrightr @NewYorker Thanks for this! Small thing: "...on the border with six pivotal U.S. allies—Israel, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey, and Lebanon..." - That's five...
@lisang For you :) https://t.co/EM2lYmBUc3
@rascal_rabbit1 @JordanUhl @indeed @Monster Definitely not!
@BrynnMcDonnell @SouthwestKey Thanks for calling our attention to this! Let me check... Thank you!

@shr_ma Hi Shrima. Thanks for the feedback. The new site is less than 24 hours old, and this is being fixed as I type :) Thank you!
@presentoccupant Great idea! Organizations don't enter that info now when they post, but let me share this with our product manager.
@presentoccupant You are correct :) And you are the first to comment on it!
Something special is happening in this group. 20,000 of are already there, and if freedom, dignity, generosity, and respect are your thing, we are waiting for you: https://t.co/Z3Y6Rx19CH
True about many great things. Sometimes you can't explain; you just need to start. https://t.co/KMGi8nY10D
@arikandell Hi Arianna. Thanks! Can you say more? I just looked and everything seems fine. Thanks!
And just as they were there, so there are millions of young people like them, all over the world, looking for the best way to make a difference. And that gives me hope.
Thread.		The thing about these Parkland kids is that they were always there. Five minutes before that loser started shooting, they were all there, as smart, authentic, and powerful as we see them now.
@PhillipSontag @AmiDar Thanks Phillip! I hope you are well!
