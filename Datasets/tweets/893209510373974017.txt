.@AmCollSurgeons has been a strong advocate for #CHIP funding and commends Congress for extending the reauthorization period to a total of 10 years.
Easing #meaningfuluse requirements opens the door for additional #HIT #Interoperability adoption and implementation to improve clinical workflow and care coordination.
#MIPS corrections in the budget deal help ensure @CMSGov has the ability to slow the Cost component of #MIPS/#MACRA, a win for physicians.

Clinical data can't be siloed. #HCIT #interoperability is more than #ehrs and C-CDA standards. Progress comes with patient data liquidity.
Do you love or hate your #ehr #emr?  Health data #interoperability might make the difference.
@AmCollSurgeons .@AmCollSurgeons believes focus cannot be on #ehrs, or even surgeons, but rather must be focused on the patient #IHeartHIT
.@AmCollSurgeons supports #digitalhealth information #HCIT which follows patients across the surgical care continuum.  #NHITWeek
