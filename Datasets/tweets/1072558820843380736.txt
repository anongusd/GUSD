@LAHomeless you're in the fight to end homelessness but thousands of people walk around on our streets homeless, the funds are going to the organization's but they're not reaching the homeless people, do you really get that we are in a homeless crisis in Los Angeles #endhomeless
We cannot just sit back and let our fellow American go without shelter or food, it is not the right and it is not how the American people do things, we can make history and send a message that homelessness is not accepted and we can end it #endhomelessness #America
@EveryoneIn_LA @mridleythomas @kathrynbarger @SupJaniceHahn @HildaSolis Thousands of families walk around on the streets searching for housing and a place to lay their head just for the night and there is no real resources out there for these people, which is sad, the homeless crisis grows day by day!!!!!
@EveryoneIn_LA @mridleythomas @kathrynbarger @SupJaniceHahn @HildaSolis The people that are dealing with homelessness in Los Angeles are not seen any part of measure H working, the homeless crisis here in LA grows day by day while measure H funds sit stagnant, the people are not seeing the help..
@CNN They are right by closing down this facility and this should never ever happen again in the healthcare industry, it should be mandated that every nursing home has cameras in their rooms on and operating at all times.
@alisa_orduna @ChristineMarge One Avenue to end homelessness is to end credit checks for housing so every American can have a fair chance to get adequate housing, credit checks for housing is causing more Americans to become homeless and stuck in poverty.
@CNN I believe strongly that this group home or facility should be shut down, they failed the people that they were caring for big time and everybody at hand that is employed there has been very neglectful of the patients that they care for, that is clear in this case..
@Jayrip5 I salute you for standing up for the homeless and speak out, this is what the American people should be doing to end homelessness and to better all of the American people's lives, more government Aid is needed for people that are dealing with homelessness.
@Suntimes @MattxRed When is our government going to say enough is enough to gun violence and violence In America, we need to order the National Guard into Chicago and Detroit to stop the Bloodshed that is happening, this is senseless and very sad #NationalGuard #Chicago #Detroit
@GiffordsCourage @RepValDemings We need powerful men and women in Congress that can change and shape this nation into the great country that it should be, where every American can feel safe and not have to worry about being gunned down at the movie theater or at the mall #weneedchange
Why should it matter if you pay your light bill or your gas bill or not, it should not matter if you have a credit score of 520 or 575, the only thing that matters is you can afford to pay the rent #nocreditchecks
When I say no credit checks I don't mean eliminate credit checks all the way across the board, what I mean is eliminate credit checks 4 housing, millions of #Americans are suffering without a proper roof over their head because of their credit, that is not right #nocreditchecks
No #American should go homeless, it is just not right for our #Government to turn a blind eye to our homeless crisis that is happening All Over America, people are suffering and are dying on our streets because of the #homelesscrisis
A person should not have to worry about if they can buy groceries or get health care, Health Care should be available to every #American, no matter your income level, your race, your religion or your sex, we need you to man our #Government do better with our #healthcareSystem.
