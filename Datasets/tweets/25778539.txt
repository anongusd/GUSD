@laurie_winkless @zenergynz Is there any mention of their recent buy-out of Flick Energy?
@KirstenEdgar @MacDiarmidInsti @callaghannz I wonder how much production of #CO2 there would be without technology? What would the increase in air travel be? Would there be even more CO2 in comparison? Maybe the CO2 generated through technology is actually saving the planet. Is probably also a lot easier to fix.

Please feel free to keep the conversation rolling. For me, it‚Äôs good night everyone! #nzlead
Thanks to everyone who has participated tonight #nzlead
Time to do the official wrap-up! But it is the internet so the discussion should live on #nzlead
@Work_well_being @hrman Exactly
@HRManNZ Then they will refuse to live! Heard of nanoparticles? #nzlead
@han_dall @TweetingTrace @culturechange1 @HRManNZ Yuck! lol
@matt_pontin Don‚Äôt use any technology #nzlead
.@Work_well_being should b very concerned about privacy! But we will not be able to stop it. How do we protect people? #nzlead
@matt_pontin It also creates a hell of a lot more data. Data can be used for more informed decisions #nzlead
@han_dall @KirstiGrant @HRManNZ data interpretation and predictive analytics is key #nzlead
@culturechange1 we call this #unstructuredData #nzlead
RT @matt_pontin: Will #theinternetofeverything see the death of certain subject matter expertise? It will all be at our "swiping-tips"   #n‚Ä¶
The thing is, they will have the data to make informed decisions #nzlead
A company may choose to have some staff share while others not for a variety of reasons #nzlead
Q3) What risks to employment does the IOT pose? #nzlead #IoT
@TweetingTrace @culturechange1 @HRManNZ @han_dall You might enter into a sharing arrangement #nzlead
@matt_pontin Was trying to stop mass panic! lol #nzlead
@culturechange1 The people can be deployed to more important tasks to help the business be more innovative #nzlead
@matt_pontin We already do this with T&amp;A #nzlead
@TweetingTrace @culturechange1 @HRManNZ @han_dall that would be quickly identified and the space be put to better use. #colabspaces #nzlead
Q3) What risks to employment does the IOT pose? #nzlead
@culturechange1 Maybe that will provide more productivity and better customer service. Will it reduce headcount? #iot #nzlead
Could health monitoring through IoT help employers assist employees to decrease sick days? #nzlead
@WeirdlyHub How the internet of things will change our organisations #nzlead
@han_dall That‚Äôs right. Maybe not just after-hours email but now robotics alerting us while at home! #iot #nzlead
We need to consider that IoT may be machines taking over human jobs. #nzlead #technologicalunemployment
Do you know that 4G phone network sites can take about 2,000 connections. 5G will take over 1m because of #IoT! #nzlead
A2) Employees will be able to monitor the house and family while at work. Maybe better peace of mind? #nzlead
RT @matt_pontin: The #InternetOfThings has been replaced by #theinternetofeverything  #nzlead
@han_dall @HRManNZ Good question! Does privacy matter in the workplace? Some would say ‚Äòyes‚Äô others ‚Äòno‚Äô #nzlead

@thechrisives @iSocialFanz You‚Äôd like to be there to influence the board
@iSocialFanz @thechrisives I work with all parts of the business and they all want to be in the boardroom. You‚Äôre going to be queueing
@iSocialFanz @thechrisives I agree and that is called Boardroom feedback
@iSocialFanz @thechrisives The boardroom sets the goals and then steers the ship
@iSocialFanz @thechrisives If your job is to do the ‚Äúlinking‚Äù to goals then the boardroom is the wrong place.
@raespresso You need to follow me so that I can dm you
@chrismikulin I would like to invite you to a google hangout to discuss this more
@petersyravong Would you like to join a google hangout to discuss this more
@raespresso Would you like to join a google hangout to discuss this more?
@raespresso The role you describe is quite different #SBizHour
@chrismikulin @raespresso I‚Äôm not underestimating the value. Any the board should be listening to what they have to say
@chevd80 @raespresso Yes, they should be providing input but not a seat
@iSocialFanz Thoughts ideas etc are suitable for boardroom discussion, but not a seat #SBizHour
@raespresso The board room is about governance and strategy not the implementation of the strategy. #SBizHour
@raespresso Everyone you talk to throughout the company is trying to get a seat at the boardroom table. #SBizHour
A6 Community managers are not suitable for the board room. #SBizHour
@KrisIsrael Yes, still on the subject of community management. Be a person not a brand. #SBizHour
A5. All people on social media should appear as themselves not as a brand. They can represent a brand. Social is about people #SBizHour

A3. The metrics need to be about increase customer loyalty, customer acquisition, satisfaction and increased revenue #SBizHour #Simple

Sometimes doing what is right will disappoint some people. Do what's right anyway.
@sterling_amanda I still see it as a challenge that we have to content with.
@sterling_amanda As social collaborators we need to encourage people to share. How do we help them to build comms skills that add value?
@Anj_Atkins What value do they think they can add? Where does that value best align? Finance or HR?
@Anj_Atkins For most organisations, payroll would not be big enough to be a department. Who would they report to? The CEO?
@sterling_amanda Never silence people. Even if they aren't in the trenches they may have a common theme that is worth listening to.
Failure isn't that big of a deal unless of course you also fail to try again.
