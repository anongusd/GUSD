@Nabel_der_Welt No, but I tell myself that 😉
@thatsafetychick @in_deserto Exactly!
@Nabel_der_Welt Ice cream helps motivate 😆
@JaxToOnething The good thing about web/app dev is that you can work your day job and build your idea on the side (I did this with Twitpic). The tooling is so mature these days.		That way you can keep the safety net while you build, validate and tweak your idea.
Moral of the story: Failure can position you to the right place		Also...	⚬ Eat more ice cream	⚬ Hug your loved ones		The End
Example: I launched two photo apps before Twitpic. The first two failed to get any users...		Twitpic grew to 30+ million users
Cheers to all the Makers out there! 		👉 Keep at it...
@thatsafetychick @in_deserto 👨‍💻 Working on a way to help the clunky’ness
@graybouk I should have added that 🤦‍♂️
@meber I've seen them around too, they look solid
@in_deserto Funny how that works since contact forms tend to be clunky

@modulusshift @Pinglyapp sent you a DM with a mockup
@modulusshift @Pinglyapp I tried a green for the open indicator, but it looked like an "online" status. I'll play around with a different color or maybe a icon of some sort.
@modulusshift @Pinglyapp Ah ok now I understand! Yeah I think that's a good idea with "unbolding" or something like that to show that it's been unread. I'll play around with that, thanks for the feedback!
@modulusshift @Pinglyapp Not actively pursuing "Inbox zero" with this, that's up to how a user processes their inbox via archiving, save for later etc.		What do you mean by the universal marked as read indicator?		Open to feedback: do you think they should be different icon shapes or different colors?
@edhenderson @Pinglyapp Also, I think a good solution would be to provide different color modes on Pingly for the various types of color-blindness (RG, BY, Complete)
@edhenderson @Pinglyapp I've done some testing and it's ok for some types of color-blindness, but I need to improve it for the others - great question.

@anthness Booo
@anthness Yeah that’s frustrating, however you can try to email the owner if it goes unused they may sell it for a fair price hopefully
@anthness I tried mine too, taken haha
@JamesIvings Congrats on the launch 👍 upvoted on PH and submitted an ad for @Pinglyapp - Hoping to see this grow!
@chrismerritt really curious how many pre-ordered at that price!
@TamalAnwar I'm a bit skeptical myself, but we'll see in time
@lucperkins @CrystalLanguage We have plans to use it in production for @Pinglyapp - I've seen frameworks/tooling around it grow tremendously in the last couple of years which is promising.
Anyone else jumping on the .dev domain train? https://t.co/TAfKw2fQsK is the only biz I know of who's actively using one. Saved $11,488 by waiting to buy one today for a whopping 12 bucks 🧐		Also, the fragmentation of a domain into various gTLDs can't be great for SEO right?
@vlucas Very interesting, didn't know that. I'll do some research, thanks!
@farzadban From what I remember it wasn't much.		Re: branding—I agree, since everything looks the same on Medium, it was hard for me to recall who's article I had read.
Happy so far after moving Pingly's blog in-house and off of Medium:	Pros:	- More control over everything: content, theme, etc	- Set it up as a subdirectory https://t.co/nai9rgkEhX	Cons:	- Not part of Medium's network to be featured / social interactions
@vince_parulan @rails @gatsbyjs I’ll check it out 👍
@lucaslitton @rails @symfony Good to know, thanks!
@lucaslitton @rails @symfony I’ve got love for PHP, great language...I’ve wanted to give RN a try and also Electron
@hassan_theitguy @ThePracticalDev Home
@cnagele Rock on, I signed up and got it installed. Will be trying it out.
@cnagele Congrats, looks very nice! Is the desktop app for mac native or electron?
@michaelfromuk Do you use it in conjunction with any JS front-end framework?
@michaelfromuk I've heard a lot of good things about Sinatra. I'll have to put some time down to spin something up with it.
Even though it's not the "hot" tool of the day (looking at you JS), I've yet to find a framework that let's me ship things as quickly as @Rails—Plus, I can maintain a fairly large codebase/app as a solo-dev.		I'm curious, what framework is everyone using these days?
Features released today for @Pinglyapp:		- ⚡️ Multi-account support w/ fast account switching (most requested feature)	- New Logo	- Refreshed UI	- Updated blog theme to match new UI		One week dev sprint 💪 Time for ice cream #TreatYoSelf https://t.co/OwtWQu51tE

Evolution of a logo 🤓 #NerdOut https://t.co/UvRrsatBGb
@McGilligan @Pinglyapp I re-launched Pingly late last year with a focus more on email (email on your own domain) and chat/email for teams. The old logo was a reflection of some voice stuff which we still do, but aren't focusing on as much now.
@lucaslitton @Pinglyapp thanks Lucas!
@skitanja @Pinglyapp haha great idea

8) God loves you and has plans for you.
7) Life isn't a straight line and things will work out differently than you thought, but the end result is better.
6) How you view things, the way you think and the way you talk will change. That's ok, it's part of growing.
5) Forgive others, you've been forgiven much.
4) Stop worrying, that doesn't help you. Stay calm and work the problem.
3) Chasing quick pleasures, while fun in the moment, will hurt you in the long run. (Drugs, drinking, relationships, etc)
2) Do not worry what people think about you, forget your reputation. Being in the "good graces" of everyone isn't possible. Stay right with God and your family, everything else doesn't matter.
Things I wish I could have told myself in my 20's:		1) You think you know a lot, but you don't. (40's me will say the same to 30's me I'm sure)

@PeterCorless @Pinglyapp @ScyllaDB Wow! I’ll check that thread out thanks! We’re trying to build raw email storage internally instead of storing in the cloud (s3) so blob size would generally be in the 10-100KB range but emails with attachments could be in MBs but we would break those down into chucks
@glcst @Pinglyapp @ScyllaDB Mostly 10KB to 100KB but there will be some cases where multiple megabyte blobs come through but would be split into smaller chunks (1MB)...trying to build out raw email storage internally
@glcst Congrats, I’ve been following the progress and have a project with @Pinglyapp I want to use @ScyllaDB with.		What’s the recommended max blob size one can store in a column now? Is it still around 1MB?

@rssdvs @Pinglyapp - Faster delivery of mail: we don't have to poll an IMAP server to get new messages, they come directly to our stack to the users's inbox	- Cost: most email providers (for business) charge now, so you don't have to pay for an email host and our service too		Hope that helps!
@rssdvs @Pinglyapp Good idea about detailing that, put that down on my list. Our main reasons are:	- We have full control of the sending/receiving of email and can maintain quality of service	(continued...)

@dd0novan Mobile app that lets you order custom ice cream flavors (choose base flavor, then add extras, toppings, etc) and have it delivered to your door in less than an hour...huge 😆
On the flip side: dev, design and hosting resources/tools are out of this world now compared to 2008		//end rant, who's up for ice cream?
Now the bar is set high when launching and the "network effect" of the large players is 100x bigger. Users expect polished UIs and the "default" feature set has grown (Ex: sharing, mobile friendly, etc)		BUT there are still untapped markets and the giants won't live forever
Startup landscape has changed entirely since 2008 when Twitpic was launched: 		Social media was the wild west, you could slap together something related to that and had a good chance of getting traction.		First version of Twitpic was built in a weekend and barely worked...

@rssdvs @Pinglyapp Very valid question, especially these days: 1) I'm interested in building a sustainable business and having been through the acquisition process before, I'm not a fan / not interested in it, however it would be dishonest of me to say "won't happen"...

@bortzmeyer Do you use spamassassisin too?
@davidlylejones I agree!
@Nilly90 Any issues with non-spam emails getting marked as spam with outlook?
@crslng Any issues with false positives on spam filtering with office 365?
@hjdunagan You shouldn’t as long as you don’t tweet your email address
@ton65jacobs Any issues with spam on self hosted?
@Jnarssty 😆
@crashraindog What do you use for spam filtering?
@bortzmeyer Any issues with spam?
@paulotruta Any issues with spam on self-hosted?
@simonrockett Yeah aol!
@Zipperdidoodah Gmail for personal and moving business stuff to Pingly
@iamrassel Many! Gmail for some old accounts and moving to Pingly...I’ve used Zoho too
What email service (not client) do you use?	Examples: Gmail, Outlook, iCloud, Fastmail, etc...
RT @lucaslitton: If you're not using Pingly yet, you're missing out. The product is fresh and will definitely grow on you. https://t.co/646…
@m_mmoli @Pinglyapp Thanks Michele! We've been "dogfooding" Pingly internally and it's replaced Gmail and Slack for us. Any feedback you have is greatly appreciated 😀
RT @Pinglyapp: Here's how to setup email on your domain with Pingly in minutes https://t.co/VjH0FTYrC7
@manuelmaly @longsview thanks! I appreciate the help/link
@mapedd @anthness ok cool, thanks for the help!
@mapedd @anthness interesting concept, so generate an image of the HTML content and use that for display?
@longsview ok thanks! will give that whirl
Any iOS Mail developers out there have any input on loading HTML email in a UITableView? Performance is staggeringly bad when you have dozens and dozens of webviews all trying to load in cells while scrolling.
@meber @Pinglyapp THAT'S IT! I couldn't remember the name
RT @Pinglyapp: We're officially launched now		A big thank you to all of our beta users who helped us squash bugs and provided great feedbac…
ICYMI: Pingly for Teams is on ProductHunt https://t.co/qWGZic8X3l
@ProductHunt Trying to add a related url (https://t.co/n0l0UhDGda) to https://t.co/qWGZic8X3l but it says "can't be loaded", I'm probably doing something wrong 😬 cc @rrhoover
@meber @Pinglyapp Thanks Matt! Remember that chat app we built back in the day? We were only a few years too soon before Slack 😆
RT @Pinglyapp: Introducing the all new Pingly  https://t.co/FAEwP1oQnZ
@donniefitz2 Congrats! Saw it on @ProductHunt and upvoted - I’ve got a prosumer video camera I’ve been trying to sell on eBay and hasn’t moved yet, will check out yours

@ross_mccully @exposure @scenehunt Beautiful! Scotland is my favorite place I’ve traveled

@lucaslitton Thanks for the info, I found the issue, pushing a fix for the bug that caused it to not forward you into your inbox after creating. I'll give stackshare a spin too
@lucaslitton One more quick question: what browser / OS are you on? I want to do some debugging to see why it didn't forward you into your inbox after creating your account
@lucaslitton great to hear! keep me posted on how it goes / any feedback you have: noah@pingly.com or hit me up on Twitter
@lucaslitton It looks like the account got created, but it must have not switched you to your inbox correctly. Try logging in at https://t.co/gC9vtxGLKI with the username@domain / password you just selected, does it let you log in?
@lucaslitton Uh oh! Is it giving an error of any kind?
@farzadban great to know, I was always curious which timezone European startups used for launching

@kaolynn Touché! 😉
@robjohnson People seemed more civil then (however that could have just been my bubble) and it was Twitpic's heydays! 😆 - I don't mean that tweet as a slight against Twitter. It's connected the world into a single "town square", what a feat
I miss 2010 Twitter 🤐
@TamalAnwar thanks for the feedback!
@thebiganvil haha I feel ya!
@thebiganvil 😆 I understand where you're coming from, however for someone like me who's in email/team chat all day, switching between apps gets old and forwarding emails is messy vs the sharing mechanism I've built
Hey designers! 👋 Any feedback is appreciated...	https://t.co/DtoDjAaExN		(live version is not mobile friendly yet 😬)
@TamalAnwar Do you use one for personal and one for business?
@dskaggs @TryGhost @Pinglyapp Medium's strength is the ease-of-use / community / email distribution of your blog if popular. However, having more control of our blog is why we've moved for design / SEO purposes
@bjornorama @Pinglyapp Big fan of Wordpress too, very mature platform / plugin ecosystem
Really impressed with @TryGhost 👍 Moving @Pinglyapp's blog over from Medium — What's everyone using these days for blogging?

Just upgraded to a iPhone Xs from a 6s (which is still under water) and wow what a difference 🤩
@earlstudios @Di9it8 agreed
@_yaHEARDmeh Some crab down there is like: "New phone, who dis?"
@astroXP I'll work on it 😆
@Di9it8 When Irma came through a few weeks ago we had an extremely low tide during it...fingers crossed that happens again
Was running by the pier and my iPhone fell out of my pocket and slid into the water 😱 Waiting for low tide to fish my phone out of the Charleston Harbor...
@Zarsace let me know if you want to try the demo and I can set you up
@ePatientDave #38 😆
Programmer Law #39: A bug will always pop up when you're demo'ing your app for someone 👾
@farzadban just replied, thanks for emailing!
@Whiffleball We combine both into a single interface, I'll setup a demo if you want to play around with it and if you like it you can create your own free beta account.
@rrhoover @ProductHunt word
@rrhoover @ProductHunt Great idea! thanks for that, looking at it now...if we plan on a full release in the next couple of weeks, should I still setup a Ship or just submit to upcoming products at full launch? or both?
Looking for testers ⚡️ If your organization/team uses email and chat, I would love to have you as a beta tester - email noah@pingly.com

@suzfiles haha sounds like college
@wphamilton thanks for reminding me, I have paper towels in the closet 😎

@USWeatherExpert Agreed, we weren't expecting a direct hit, just some wind and rain. I live close to the harbor and wanted to to be sure our first floor door was sealed up and keep an eye on things.

@igasu Oh now I remember 🤦‍♂️
@igasu I may have missed that, who was it?
@igasu I enjoyed that one too, solo doesn't have a good light saber fight though
@earlstudios 😆
@pandapuerco if you liked rogue one, you will probably really like solo
@AngusRockford had a more authentic story behind it I'd say too
@rickyli99 I actually liked Prometheus the best 😬

@rodneyriley my understanding now is that the business the email was sent to is the responsible party to delete not the email service provider?
@coribanyon @harborec @andmetv @ProjectMusicEC @entrecenter go Cori go! Congratulations 🎉
@trevorcummings that was my understanding as well, thanks for clarifying!
@trevorcummings ...also I appreciate the info and help!
@tverschoren thanks for the info!
@trevorcummings who is the responsible party for the data deletion? The email service provider (gmail, yahoo etc) or the business/organization who the email was sent to?
@Khoji I appreciate the info, thanks!
@Khoji who is responsible for the data deletion? the company who received the email or the email hosting provider (i.e. gmail, fastmail etc)?
@trevorcummings so if the EU person sent it to a business (example: a hardware store) they could then request their email be deleted from the hardware store's inbox?
@walterheck even though the email provider (gmail, yahoo etc) is holding that data? that's the vague part for me, would those companies have to honor those data deletion requests
Any GDPR experts out there? Question: if an EU person sends an email to someone on gmail (or any email provider), can that person request their data be deleted from the person's inbox they sent it to? 🤔

@wordwarrior39 😆

@kevdog haha true...that was a great scene visually when it made scrap metal of those ships
@thegoldenspike yeah that's possible
@RichersGhost @ElFrankMagana 😆
@xeroksUK another one! but they also aren't in full space suits so if they ejected they would die from the exposure to outer space...why aren't they wearing full space suits?!
@gatola_j interesting...that's deep
@toliman haha
@ejwwest lol
@jcoehoorn I still enjoyed it, but saw a few plot holes too
@wmichben haha I enjoyed it though
@MarsEclipse I could see that, but I think a remote pilot should be able to do anything an on-board pilot could do (with correct authorization)
@arnoldcam haha
@ScottMcGrew haha true, didn't think of that...that was a really cool scene though, great visuals when it cut through all the ships
@ElFrankMagana I'll give you that one, but a remote pilot (with correct authorizations) should seem to be able to do anything an on-board pilot could...still a great movie though
@kevdog still very enjoyable, but a few tech / story holes
@J_Jammer that's plausible...I still liked the movie a lot
Watched the Last Jedi last night and enjoyed it — However you're telling me that Admiral Holdo had to stay with the ship because they don't have auto or remote pilot in Star Wars?! At least they have hover-boards 🤔

@Tevlar I talked to my wife and she told me no haha
@O_meOhMy thanks!
@ProphetPVD glad you like it
@Tom_cg28 thank you!
@dentenny thanks! sure did
@DavidBurnsworth I love a good mystery thriller
@iambeanie sure! 😉
Cloudy sunrise this morning ⛅️ https://t.co/WoUdYJieoM
@box_art haha I like it...has a film noir feel to it
@Krux100 @AskJoshy yeah! tons of snow pics...I'll try to find a good one to post at some point
@DrAstroZoom I appreciate it!
@vampire_skwid thank you!
Charleston fog from last night 🌧 https://t.co/81Xf2CSS1M
@diegoratt Building with a framework?
@350D Ah yeah PHP, I miss that language
@350D Impressive! What language are you developing that in?
@PalGStudio That’s a good one too
@Zipperdidoodah I’m on that plan too, good stuff
@Tevlar ...but we broke rule one already
@GueCas Good goal!
@Tevlar You’re starting one?! I’m in
@weePhotosEdin @trapprain I appreciate that!
@weePhotosEdin @trapprain very nice! will show that one to the wife too
@trapprain love it
@IreneVz congrats! where in Germany do ya'll want to go?
@trapprain That is an interesting story, just read your blog on it. Speaking of Edinburgh, when my wife and I visited there last Summer we absolutely loved it, beautiful city. The view from Arthur's Seat was stunning!
@NIFTYNEC the three H's, I like those
@box_art rock on! hit me up when it's out
@mahoney1510 wow! I won't even pretend I know what that all encompasses but it sounds like a fun challenge
@trapprain great! reading it now
@mahoney1510 nice! in medical field or other?
@benjamin_murdoc yeah! doooo iiiiiittttt
@petitepilgrim my wife majored in French so she's been my translator when we've gone there...I know the basics which are how to order coffee and ask where the bathroom is 😆
@xXxDeej looks delicious
@arekpietrzyk haha! I'll have to work extra hard
@1jamesanderson @Pinglyapp I hope you find it too!
@box_art nice! gotta start somewhere right? what's the subject / genre?
@yogibeau I hope that works out for you and prayers from us
@petitepilgrim that's a great one, have you been to Paris before?
@arekpietrzyk losing first-year marriage weight haha
@1jamesanderson interesting! what's your definition of your ideal habitation? mine is losing the honeymoon marriage weight and improving @Pinglyapp
@BigHairyMarty just checked it out, that's cool!
@Mike_Miner very interesting! I live in an area that's big on boating / ocean activities, would be useful for that market too I would imagine
@anamiii great!
@FigVilleUSA thanks for sharing!
@arekpietrzyk great goal
@xXxDeej that's a tasty goal, I love baked goods
@kingkool68 very cool! looking at it now
@Nkule_Duma I hope that you get to launch it! I'm a big fan of baked goods 🤩
@fiyfly21 nice!
@Mike_Miner word! what's your startup?
@kingkool68 nice! are you trying to remove the location data before it's posted or trying to scrap the data after it's posted?
@anamiii great! what are you getting your masters in?
@fiyfly21 awesome! what are you wanting to study?
@Naituutstad rock on 👍
What project or goal are you working on for 2018? I'd like to hear about it 🤓
@gm8arv @Pinglyapp I’m on board with that! 😃
@exiva @Pinglyapp crazy messy how many standards are misused or per client rules
Debugging an issue for @Pinglyapp and found that a surprising amount of email clients only send an HTML body with no plain text alternative #CmonNow #PlayNice 🙄
@RvLeshrac @Groucho1062 @Pinglyapp agreed regarding similar features to GV, however messaging over email is the other main point...goal is to aggregate communication over those 3 popular mediums

@maccaw any plans for a pay-per-lookup pricing option?
@EssayMore No, not referring to cancer. I’m sorry to hear about your dad
@adamparish the voting idea I hadn't thought of, that would be interesting
@dskaggs Thanks Dan!
@trapprain That’s a good example of the undesirable ads that crept into our networks 🤣
@dskaggs Photos app for Mac isn’t bad but not really networked or multi-user...interesting idea!
@DannPetty only if you do one of your sweet video intros for it! 😎 🔥
@AppleSupport Late 2014 retina iMac crashing multiple times a day with "Sleep Wake Failure", happened with Sierra and now High Sierra, thanks for your help!
@Gurpartap haha! yeah!...the good'ol days 😀
@adamparish thanks for the vid! I do need to devote more time to learning crypto-currency
@vijaykoogu Yeah they look to be doing well, which is great to see since that is a tough space
@nuclearpengy finding something unique in the photo sharing space that hasn't already been done or at least wrapping it up in a different way...small monthly fee for no ads would require decent adoption
@JaxToOnething Thank you Jeff! Truly means a lot
@EricInAdelaide I have people?!
@NuruPoExcep CrêpePic...only photos of crêpes
@bruceb_uk PicTwit, that's original right?
...but honestly if it didn’t have to be ad supported, like most social apps, I’d be more tempted. Having lived the ad revenue life for 7 years back with Twitpic and how yucky that was....I’ve got stories 😱
I’m a stage 3 recovering photo-sharing-app founder &amp; I have the urge to build another one...stage 4 is accepting that’s a stupid idea 🤞😬
@_yaHEARDmeh That’s why we play with alien cuz he’s got the military directions down 🤣

@SennheiserUSA I have a EW 100 G3 plug-on transmitter that will no longer turn on after testing with multiple fresh batteries. The unit turned on for a brief moment then turned itself off after a minute or so. The Unit hasn't been used in a while. Thanks for your help!
@Sonny3745 oh boy! haha
@joqatana wow! amazing what they choose to eat...mine likes socks too
@hilldoc little of this, little of that
@wolfman1360 no kidding 😂 thankfully I pried it out of his mouth before he swallowed it
@Crow_TLJ0NG haha true that!
@Jencie31 haha! what is it about socks they love? mine is digging through the laundry pile every time he can
Could start a blog called “Things my dog tried to eat today” - Todays would be a WWJD bracelet and part of a palm tree 🤭
@robunni Twitter acquired Twitpic in late 2014 and I believe recently they took down the profiles / timelines on Twitpic, however from what I understand direct photo links in your Twitter timeline should still work
@theweaslette haha it seems they should make Siri aware that media is playing and not interrupt it
@Sonny3745 Probably accidentally order a bunch of dog treats 🤣
@DistilUnion Great talk at @StartupGrindCHS
@Jules_Clarke Yeah I believe you can turn it off so it's not "always on" thankfully
@CorkingMovies haha!
@Jules_Clarke just tested and it goes off when phone is unplugged and screen is "off" - kind of scary!
Siri goes off ever time I call for my wife "Hey Sarah!" — I guess I have an accent 🤠 #Yeehaw
@jeremyberm @StartupGrindCHS You did great 👍
@rob7falcon Amen to that
@DEHegarty I do like apple pie as well
@TheManiacHiker Would like to try that!
@piccolan I see what you did there
@ctdawe I've never had Huckleberry pie, I'll have to try that one now 🥧
@1jamesanderson 😂
@DannPetty Thanks Dann, much appreciated! Checking out the kit now 👍
@1jamesanderson that makes sense after visiting the UK, all the meat pies we ate had lids and the tarts or treacles weren't covered
@SecretCricketer whoa whoa that's a whole different ball game haha, I LOVE meat pies 😎
@BHinIA I do like cherry pie, but pecan is my main squeeze
Pecan pie, the one pie to rule them all #NoDebate #LordOfThePies
@DannPetty I'm enjoying the videos, thank you for putting that content out there — what camera hardware and editing software are you using? ⚡️
@alfred_lua @buffer @WordPress @Medium thank you! very informative
@alfred_lua @buffer I noticed the blogs are powered by @Wordpress. Any thoughts on that vs @Medium? I waffle back and forth on which to use🤔 — Thanks for sharing your stats!
@gituverma cute dog!
@JoyOwango haha sure, he eats a lot and snores 😆
Lou is ready for Thanksgiving 🐶 https://t.co/Aen4c6Vo77
@meber Yeah!
@meber No 😩 closest one is in NC
@meber I miss pei wei
Last night’s sunset 🔥 https://t.co/xP5zGhXxlP
@esteinhauer I believe Twitter has removed that option, however direct links to Twitpic photos in your Twitter timeline should still be working (last I checked)
I'm building an API for @Pinglyapp — If you're a developer interested in being part of the beta, send me a message at noah@pingly.com ⚡️
@skibert maybe they’ll regain popularity in 20’is years 🤞
@rrhoover good advice, thanks! 👍
@Faux_Schlmoe yeah, the media played it up big too
@Faux_Schlmoe I think some of those actually paid out if I remember correctly, but probably was back in the late 90's early 2000's
@chelitogarcia @ninoratta7777 😎
@garygo I remember those too!
@Fat_Salz now that you mention, I think I do!
@NormCycles haha I had a few of them, but I think I gave them away
Sitting here watching Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash and I'm just wondering when my Pogs are gonna pay out 🤔 #Just90sThings
@rrhoover The wife and I want to do something similar next year, possibly cross country. Keep us posted! 👍
@MyJolieH @Pinglyapp Use your own product or service like a customer would. “eating your own dog food” is the full term
@maharajmeister @Pinglyapp aww ☹️
Can't stress how important it is to dog food your own product. I do the bulk of my communication (email/sms/voice) through @Pinglyapp for that reason — Not only do you find bugs, but more importantly UI/UX pain points that cannot be found without immersing yourself 🤓
@Stammy well now I gotta get one, plus do crème brûlée 😁
@Stammy Is the torch just to get a char on the outside / most cooking is done in the water?
@kylebragger @Pinglyapp Thanks! Email sent from noah@pingly.com (if it went to spam let me know, working to debug)
@kylebragger best wishes on your new endeavors and I'd love your feedback on @Pinglyapp
@JHRLegal thanks for the shout out Jason!
@trapprain @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp I would be ok with a 10-20% discrepancy haha
@cjnewbs @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp if they don't correct it I guess I'll have too, hope it doesn't resort to that though
@Jelloschotz @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp no response either yet :/
@johnjac @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp not a fan so far haha
@Ryan_NelsonSC @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp amen to that
@USWeatherExpert @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp not very nice
@Ryan_NelsonSC @LinkedIn @LinkedInHelp I could see maybe $10-20 bucks going over, but that was quite the shock!
@piccolan thanks! do you like Google fi? I've heard good things about it
@loudmouthman @trapprain haha
@twelvesouth ..and if I would have read the specs I would have saw that it is indeed thinner...sorry 😉
@twelvesouth is the Journal case for iPhoneX a little thinner than the BookBook since it doesn't have the removable case? Torn on which one to get...
@trapprain @loudmouthman sure! he helped me a lot with some email issues last year, good stuff
@theseldonplan thanks!
@Jerroldnthe209 thank you!
@theseldonplan Thanks for the info! For business or personal use?
@Jerroldnthe209 Thanks for the info! Do you have a regular mobile number too or just use GV?
@cwsterling interesting! because of the transcription or another reason?
If you use Google Voice or Grasshopper, I'd like to pick your brain. Email me at noah@pingly.com—Thanks in advance! 🤗
Just a heads up—@TwitterSupport says they're aware of an issue with Retweets https://t.co/MzW8W4EAEU
@JacobyDave @Pinglyapp Do you use it for business use or other? I'm curious to hear more your use-case with GV, feel free to email me at noah@pingly.com
@sspencer_smb @TwitterSupport hmm yeah that's possible, but my understanding is that retweets go to your full audience
@martinpeck @TwitterSupport interesting, good to know, thanks!
Does Twitter limit retweet audience now? Noticed that retweets get 20% the amount of impressions vs directly tweeting — cc @TwitterSupport
@lucas_hammer woooord 👍
@lucas_hammer me and the wife want to visit Chicago sometime in the near future! I'll be sure to hit you up when that happens
@lucas_hammer Great to hear and congrats! SC is finally cooling down so that's good 😀

@ChasWaterkeeper @swimguide @scdhec Out of curiosity, do you find that water quality get's better or worse after massive storm flooding, like from Irma?
@adamparish @MoviePass Haha! And I love movies almost too much
@adamparish @MoviePass Keep us posted! I’m thinking about getting one 🤞

@whale thanks Matthew! It's been iterated on a lot since then and I think I've finally found it's niche 🤓 Thanks again for having me out there!
@mattecook @AtlasLocal ...I get multiple spam calls daily to my normal mobile line, big ramp up in the last few years with spam
@mattecook @AtlasLocal thanks Matt for the tweet share! I've been ramping up more of my normal calls through Pingly and the spam blocking has been very helpful...
@StartChucktown @Pinglyapp @ProductHunt great to hear! 🍿🎉
@rrhoover @jakecrump ...I'm *only* 10 months late submitting to @ProductHunt 😉 - Really appreciate the platform and community you all have built 👍
Excited to be back on ProductHunt with @Pinglyapp 2.0! 🔥 https://t.co/YTdd1Smv4K

@trapprain many times! especially the ankles
@joqatana it might be more of a southern / country term...but yes, healthy as a puppy works too :)
@1jamesanderson happened to my wife, surprised her with pup for our 1-year anniversary and instant love for Lou
@MacgurlLaney1 very cute pup!
@RJFlamingo tons of it!
@BlueBirdSells thank you!
Lou's first visit to the vet - healthy as a horse, happy as a clam and despite how he looks, not overweight 🤣 #LouTheLab https://t.co/GuvAqkjkpu
@downhererocks preach! 👍
@daniellalvarez My understanding is logins have been disabled by Twitter, but direct links to photos still work. Twitter took over Twitpic in late 2014.
@Sonny3745 haha ok deal
@efbacon GMC 3500 dualie looks real nice, could probably haul a pony or two with that 😁
@Back2The90z sold
@broomerm didn't think about that...is that a negative reason or positive? I don't like my friends that much...I kid, I kid
@budleebuzz I want the biggest haha...murica!

@inordinary @Pinglyapp haha I didn't create that account or have access to it, but Twitter support might be able to help you with that username though 🤓
@inordinary @Pinglyapp hmm I didn't create the account and also I'm not affiliated with Twitter 😀 sorry for the confusion
@ANGRYHOUZE @TwitPic Twitter took over Twitpic from me back in late 2014. I don't have anymore control over it, sorry I couldn't be of more help.
@inordinary This is for Twitter or @Pinglyapp?
@adamparish very nice! what's the flight time on one battery?

@PatrickRomSim I've heard that twice now, will check that out!
@Fly_Agaric good advice, thank you!

Any tips for driving through the Scottish Highlands from Glasgow? Besides the whole driving on the left thing 😉
@AyahsHope Yeah an example URL would be: https://t.co/G8bTvJ4cYC - Do you see any of those in your Twitter timeline? Those should be working still
@AyahsHope I believe the links in the format of https://t.co/OaNGdT5yek&lt;photo-ID-here&gt; should still work, have you seen those working in your timeline?
@AyahsHope Oh no! Can you reply with one of the Twitpic links that's not working? Hopefully Twitter hasn't change something 🤔
@emilywadding We're not hiring at the moment BUT thank you for reaching out and for your interest! I'll be sure to post on here when we are 😀
@AyahsHope ...thank you for using Twitpic! 😀
@AyahsHope Hey Kathleen! The direct links to your Twitpics should still work, but I believe Twitter has removed the profile/timeline links...
@tfkamucheka usually it's one of those "last minute" things that get pushed to production haha
A good way to see how much detail was put into a web or mobile app is to check the "Settings" page 😉 #guilty
@destroytoday What's your main driver of sales for @cushionapp? Looking for direction on marketing and sales for my SaaS app.
@Daniel_Gardner very nice! hope that goes smoothly for you...same'ol here, just trying to keep our house clean and so far I'm not doing a good job 😁
@Daniel_Gardner How's everything going friend?
@michaeldick Digging the setup - food, dog, laptop and outside 💥
@timmycarr @SpoletoFestival for sure!
@doctork4u2 Appreciate the kind words David!
Date night! Listening to the symphony at @SpoletoFestival https://t.co/5ZNlBomB0W
@dustintheweb I like it, sign me up
@dustintheweb What trends you seeing? I want to be in the loop!
@paulwrblanchard @mediamasters_fm Hey Paul, thanks for thinking of me, sounds very interesting. Do you have time for a quick call next week for more details? Thanks!
@AndreeaHirica very interesting!
@AbsoCharleston @ExploreCHS @OldExchangeBldg @chasmuseum @Shorpy thanks!
@andrewbg been rocking the same BookBook since my iPhone 6 now with my 6s...looking forward to the iPhone 8 just so I can get the new BookBook 👍
@meloniegonzalez right! wrong?...right!
@PadraigC haha
@pinkluna post the for sure wrong diagnosis online I would assume...good question!
@ExploreCHS @OldExchangeBldg @chasmuseum thanks! will do some searching
@Stevempars good one ;)
"The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." - Cunningham's Law
@ExploreCHS @OldExchangeBldg Anymore photos of that area (specifically broad street) or where I could find them? Thanks!
@albionmarquez you as well!
@MarijanaCuvalo appreciate it!
@MacgurlLaney1 fo shizzle 🤜
@g1smd yeah voip numbers can be spun up quickly, however I've had a high hit rate so far with the one I added into https://t.co/f4kGmZ6iob 🤞
Post from last year, but it still helps me now ⚡️ "Would it help?" https://t.co/ArZ7tgnw92
@joinbooster thanks for the meetup and food last night, enjoyed your demo
@SeanASkinner Tax season might bring on the increase...Good question, unfortunately I think elderly have been susceptible which is so evil
@ttiger2004 if I could sit on a boat all day in a lake I'd probably be ok making spam calls then 😉
@ChaseLivingston I'll check that out 👍...I added spam flagging to Pingly recently so I'm trying to route more of my calls through that
@FlaviaKoehler interesting will try that out...If I've got time I'll try to keep them on the line as long as possible and mess with them 😎
@HeyHeySarahJNE apparently it's becoming very wide spread, even with the Do Not Call list
@kingkool68 I've seen that too. I'm starting to route more of my calls through Pingly since it added spam flagging, but will check out TrueCaller again
@mhaddog over the past couple of years it's exploded
@SierraTechLLC wow! shaddy
@almcfadyen yeah that's pretty much what I have to do now
@29thcenturycapt the spoofing stuff is scary
@Ohknow haha good idea
@RoxStar same! frequency has increased lately...especially around tax season
@KiwiBoyUS yeah that's basically what I have to do now
@EricaAsh13 yeah tons of them now!
@sekullbe the Do Not Call list isn't working either
@SeanASkinner the frequency has increased a ton the past couple of years
@ttiger2004 haha yeah
Phone spammers are getting trickier! Receiving calls from numbers that match my area code and next 3 digits - fooled me once 😑
@dccongopimp rock on!
@fascinated The good'ol days
@derjacboy sounds good
@derjacboy Got a response! They said they've recategorized it as "Technology/Internet", hopefully it loads now or it may take time to propagate.
@derjacboy submitted for review stating it's an incorrect classification...thanks for the heads up! hopefully we hear something soon
@derjacboy reading more it seems they think we serve Malware, that's incorrect, will contact them
@derjacboy interesting...I assume because it's a messaging app with user generated content that they consider it harmful to youth? will investigate
@derjacboy whoa! that is odd...can you DM me the text from that page so that I can translate it? will work to see what this is about
Pingly now supports voice calls https://t.co/f4kGmZ6iob ⚡️ Feedback is appreciated
@AndreeaHirica good ones 👍 - Not a physical list, but mentally taking notes. It seems exercise, eating, sleeping, gardening are popular ones
@pinkdlaq very useful +1
@cllaudiu interesting, will check that out...thanks!
@3ahia3lythe nice dragon!
@kummykunmi I wish mine was cleaning! The house is messy quite often
@hectorsq agreed, that is enjoyable 📸
@khendrickson9 good stuff
@aherneamon Agreed exercise also great for stress
@jmontal03 +1
@rob7falcon +1 for exercise, something I've slacked on lately
@FortGeek yeeeeeah 80's cars are making a comeback
@scorchsoft haha you know it
@FortGeek what kind of car?
@collylicious +1 for music
@Mizdboyd I like it!
@Katik17 +1 to that
@Howlsgirl haha
@Sonny3745 very cool! my wife is the same way
@aksingh96 ah yeah, which reminds me to get back on my routine haha
@Thetaelizabeth Gardening is a good one, I agree
@CJF_NC @BrianForDummies gotta eat to survive, might as well make it useful
@joelfreak @exiva they spoof your number? whoa!
@Rael_E11 yeah!
@exiva @joelfreak Tax time sees an increase of spam too, very shady. I'm routing more of my calls through https://t.co/f4kGmZ6iob now since it flags spam
@trapprain that's a nice one
@exiva @joelfreak I found they've also started calling from numbers that match the area code and first 3 digits of your phone number, fooled me once
@xxnya sure, do it up
@rendeerr that's a good one, the house could use more cleaning
@BrianForDummies my wife says my cooking is good or maybe she's just being nice
@8InchesFlaccid don't hurt yourself
@Hodobbs third one saying that!...I as well
@BUSYBEE8 haha
@XplodMusiq haha
@_FearFighter_ that's a new one
@wolfslayer23 I like your style
@awwpeaches except soufflé, that stuff is made to infuriate ;)
@adamparish Tourists haha j/k. Maybe stress was the wrong word, but helps settle the mind
@carinamelo I wish I read more physical books, good call
@NetAppPub haha
Found cooking to be a good stress reliever 😅 - What's yours?
@tintami Low ball them haha
@tfkamucheka haha true
@EthanDParker probably weeds out the ones who aren't going to pay enterprise pricing I assume too
@ctdawe haha
@edu723 good points, thanks!
@alexlmiller Good points, honestly a new way of looking at it for me. Signals they are really interested too - P.S. love @StackOverflow
@myheadisarocket interesting, makes sense...if you take the time to put in your info it's a good signal on interest
Does making a customer request pricing actually help? Enterprise SaaS is especially bad at this - I'm honestly curious🤔
@nelson_chadwick sure thing, just sent you a DM with some info
@badjonphoto I've been wanting to try that place, how's the pizza?
RT @Pinglyapp: Big update! - Introducing Pingly 2.0 🔥 https://t.co/KcRYP7PPnb
@CraftCMS @destroytoday Thanks!
@destroytoday Yeah! I remember DestroyTwitter now. Good times back then, it was the wild west - thanks for integrating to Twitpic then! 👍
@destroytoday @CraftCMS sweet! thanks for the response
@cushionapp @destroytoday what blogging setup do you use for https://t.co/0NuUweGHyl or was it built in-house? Looks great 👍
@MacgurlLaney1 thanks!
@nelson_chadwick thanks for the heads up! I'll get that re-enabled
@BUSYBEE8 @KING @SisterMerryMary very cool! the new board walks they put in are very nice
@ZachACole nice shot!

@Silicon_Cowboys @JohnC112461 @netflix 👍
@jasoncohenfilm You did a phenomenal job! Captivating story and the cinematography / narrative was top notch 👍
@benmarks You are right! 😱 - Mobile support is really lacking on the marketing site, thanks for the heads up! Media queries here I come 🙃
@JohnC112461 @netflix there are some left in Oklahoma too, at least when I lived there
If you haven't watched Silicon Cowboys on @Netflix yet - do it! 🍿 https://t.co/y5s6TtEQUy
@saintjava Play on playah 😎
@jazzychad I'm seeing it too on web
It's taken three iterations, but Pingly's direction is starting to come together https://t.co/f4kGmZ6iob 🔥
@DaveMora ...the line technicians repaired the water damage and ant infestation haha
@DaveMora copper seems to be the only thing available in many of these rural areas too. I will say though the issue is fixed now after...
@Shpigford What drove your choice to use bare metal servers for @Baremetrics? I'm a fan of dedicated hardware too. That's how Twitpic was hosted.
...but know that being nice to people does not mean you let others misuse you
Being nice is powerful - You may not see the effect immediately, but being consistently good to people will manifest in time #WorkInProgress
@samarthsikotara thanks!
@rrhoover great timing, I was just tweeting about where to get cheap flights today
@shaw3232 thanks!
@alicia_ruby I keep hearing that about Virgin, now I'm really interested
@gosamv @leg3nd great, thanks!
@atkinsbj wow that's a great deal, will check it out
@doctork4u2 thanks!
@leg3nd thanks!
@stuartjcarter haha thanks
@NooneCasey @AerLingus is Ryanair the usual way people hop over to UK from Ireland?
@VirginAtlantic @IndraniRay any special deals for "first time" Virgin fliers? 😁 I've heard great things about Virgin, but have yet to fly with them
@terilee007 ok cool, thanks!
@JuliaManhattan oh cool did not know that, thanks!
@mikedohsays thanks!
@lovely36311 sure does seem like it or the media is just putting them in the spotlight and these issues have always been there
@IndraniRay thanks! I've heard great things
@Nitesh_J haha, I'll start training now ;)
@transientnumber thanks! I didn't know they did trans-atlantic flights
@SeanOQuin @Delta thanks! I've got some miles saved up with them
@thejongardner I've yet to fly Virgin, but I've heard great things
@samuelmoss92 @CaseyNeistat thanks!
Any recommendations on best airline for East Coast to London/UK flights? ✈️
@BairdHall Yeah! Have fun! 🤳✈️
@kristinbwalker sounds nice, where is it located?
@Daniel_Gardner haha enjoy
@REALAndyGibson time :)
@sup Very nice shot
@REALAndyGibson somedays I wish I could 😉
It's Saturday, time to be like... https://t.co/MHLbu3Hd4I
Didn't know I needed a puppy with a hat until now https://t.co/x4GQmzs8H4
@confidant_ca @elonmusk I think better to know the vehicles intent, instead of guessing. Specifically when an oncoming car wants to turn, but AI will get very smart
@edfischman @elonmusk I would think so, since that makes all autonomous cars, as a whole, run smoother. Instead of a car having to slow way down to merge
@EmilyLozano @elonmusk that's usually the middle finger in the united states, maybe world-wide?
@catchtheleaves @elonmusk unless the AI has a sense of humor (evil?), I would hope so :)
@Jerzyiroc @BMW as a BMW owner, I apologize for the other BMW owners in the world...for what it's worth, I use my turn signal like it's a religion
@Omied @TwitPic I don't have the ability to fix that anymore BUT someone at Twitter can help you at this link https://t.co/g0es2VHusZ 🤓
Best thing about self-driving vehicles? Turn signals will actually be used now - Thank you @elonmusk for this gift to society
@dvjen nice looking lab!
@Sherrielea2 have a link?
@tehvlad sounds like a slice of heaven, tacos are pretty much my favorite food
@JackGabrieI sweet! do you happen to know the color / gender? I'll pass the info along to the wife, thanks for reaching out 👍
@tehvlad always wanted to visit there, however my passport is expired I think
@MrsTopher haha! I'll let Sarah know your advice

Made a cheesecake yesterday and that's what I'm having for lunch, because I'm an adult, I pay taxes and my wife isn't home #DoWhatIWant
@arunbasillal merging email, sms and an upcoming communication feature into a single platform. New landing page coming to help clarify! 🤓

@trapprain still up for me, what browser are you using?
@KatePavula Try this link: https://t.co/g0es2VHusZ - They should be able to delete the account. Thanks for using Twitpic back in the day!
@Roxana_530 haha
@GrimFang4 probably the lack of thumbs makes typing hard ;)
@Sonny3745 haha
@Jackson_RowerUK glad to hear it!
@Hasgaroth nice to have two of them
@fitzcouzy haha
@Hasgaroth a lab is what we want! or a basset hound...great dogs
@GodEmperorLeto dogs can be smelly too ;)
@JOSHHYDLER lab or a basset hound, but we'll take anything really that needs a good home, trying to find one from a shelter
@jmothecat haha isn't that like one of those interest free loans that after X amount of months you're hit with a big payment? ;)
@ramoulwrites @CDrems haha you're right...my hope is I bought myself some time :)
@SavageLyfe09 ;)
@JOSHHYDLER bought myself a little more time
@Wheres_Kevo I had to think fast ;)
@niesliphoto I wouldn't mind getting a cat too, I like cats
@utkukoker oi vey!
@Vnamuye you're right ;) I'm trying to convince myself I bought myself a little time...right? haha
@Bridgetknapek preferably a lab or basset hound, but we'll take anything that needs a good home in the end
@BUSYBEE8 rescuing is the plan, I get sent links all day long from shelters haha
@jcoffi haha
@desmarkie haha, my hope is it buys me a little time
@tgrfan42069 That's right!...I bought myself two years...I think
@HairWeaveKiilla 🤓
@pinoyakohahaha haha

@cafekunweb unfortunately I don't have the ability to do that anymore, but try https://t.co/g0es2VHusZ, they should be able to remove it
@Jarrettmg haha no sarcasm, I'm a UNC fan and Duke usually beats us
@Jarrettmg yes, go heels! 😉
@nirvdrum what game do you play? Titanfall 2 for me currently
@lefred Ah ok, that makes sense now. Great write ups on your blog, thanks for those!
@lefred ...does that emit some sort of event or callback to be used to modify an app's writer node or is that done via a monitoring script?
@lefred as a MySQL user for the past 15 years this is a dream come true. One question: on a primary failure and new primary election...

@jeremyrwelch @BairdHall haha! I think that quote was from 2010, but I stand by it! 😉
@shoutingboy haha
@trapprain interesting, I did not know that! all I found online mostly was urban dictionary listings haha
@Jessica_Prost seeing Twitpic links in timelines still, makes me happy! thanks for using us back in the day :) good times
@shoutingboy haha! maybe it transcends more than just startups ;)
If your commit messages contain the word "Janky" you're probably running a startup
@rrhoover @jakecrump I lied, will wait for next week to be sure we don't need to submit a new iOS build - last tweet! ya'll have a good one
@rrhoover @jakecrump word! I'll submit for early tomorrow, wanting to verify some bug fixes are working correctly. Thanks again!
@rrhoover @jakecrump no prob! I don't believe it is, but I'd love to be! I didn't know if it was a faux pas to submit yourself?
Props to @anthness for helping me knock out the iOS app for @Pinglyapp in record time! If you're looking for iOS work give him a shout. https://t.co/DeutkBfyD6
@W_Goddard thanks for checking it out!
@KingDerodreas great to hear that! that's what I was hoping for...thanks for checking it out 😃
@michaeldick ...there are some features I'm working that will help Pingly find it's space. In my head I'm 3 versions in the future ;)
@michaeldick ...messenger that works over email and sms too, best way I can describe is like twitter dm, but platform independent...
@michaeldick describing Pingly and it's benefits is an area I'm working to do better at...right now it's bare bones and just works as...
@gvuksic thanks! glad to hear it's working great, had a few crashing issues I'm trying to resolve now...api for sure, big item on roadmap
@iamjoemullins thanks man! working on some bugs causing the app to crash, just a heads up in case it happens to you
@swimboy46163 ...future versions may allow you to import your other email accounts
@swimboy46163 ...the goal being right now to let Pingly be able to send and receive email so it's not a closed network...
@swimboy46163 right now with Pingly you get a new email address, it doesn't take over your other accounts...
New website for https://t.co/IXFNEZandm is live and the iPhone app has also been released!
@beauregardclagh ah yes!

Nice read on some history of Twitpic https://t.co/3eRCiO9EJW
@loreleichs what will happen to the old coal tipple and historic structures and what is the impact on magnolia cemetery? #ImagineCHS
@rootwrk I believe via this form now is the way to remove an orphaned account: https://t.co/g0es2VHusZ - hope that helps!
@joeygirard how was it?!
Having no cofounder is better than having the wrong cofounder #Startups
@dayaffe most definitely!

@MidianiteManna @StartupGrindCHS haha good catch
RT @StartupGrindCHS: Life after being acquired. @noaheverett  6/16 https://t.co/uGiIfamHZx https://t.co/QK3CxzJKG4
@nogginfuel great to hear! looking forward to chatting in person
@nogginfuel rock on!
@frothelhorse haha true, "networking" has been used to include all sorts of time sinks
@WdavisT I agree, there are certain times networking is useful and sometimes even required, but I think *most* "networking" is a time sink
Take whatever time you spend networking and cut it in half. Then throw both halves out and get back to work 😉 #MostlyTrueStartupAdvice
@SchwartzNow we had a good run 😀
@MarkToro you as well, enjoy your stay in CHS
@fascinated I heard that Apple made the approval process faster starting in May...good to see 👍
I'll be speaking at @StartupGrindCHS on June 16th. Come by and say hey! - I'll also be giving out free hugs... https://t.co/kHRCTADBjt
@jonk no shame in your game, that looks good
@MarkToro thanks Mark, I appreciate the response. My email is asknoah@gmail.com or Twitter DM works too.
@jeffbarr side note: looking forward to getting @Pinglyapp setup on AWS soon. I believe we're getting on AWS Activate to try it out.
@MarkToro Magnolia cemetery is near by too. Will it's view be impeded? Hope you understand our love for this city &amp; it's delicate charm :)
@MarkToro what's the impact on land, marsh &amp; waterfront with @loreleichs? What about the old coal tipple? cc: @postandcourier @AndyParas
@jeffbarr I think I have a few of those, however 'Fundamentals of Data Structures' is one of the Shakespeares of programming books
@CosmaP that sounds super fun to do on a motorcycle. I sold my Yamaha r6 many years ago, but wanting to get a new bike in the near future!
@FPTower is the helicopter ride out same price ($1300) for one person? Looking at doing a solo bachelor trip before my wedding, thanks!
@lilsisterman @StartupGrind @Pinglyapp yeah! looking forward to it!
@nburdy sweet! it's beautiful land
What up San Fran! Last stop on our pacific coast highway drive. https://t.co/upmzdHFATH
@0107_99 Twitter support can delete the photo or account. Try this link https://t.co/g0es2VZ5kx
@0107_99 unfortunately I can't do admin tasks at Twitpic anymore, but Twitter support should be able to take care of that for you

@PPinkKoolaid haha thanks
@kelegurl41 sounds like a scene from an 80's horror movie
@ArthurFrDent yeah! old school legit
@BairdHall we got this bro
@Swizzlerz only laughs, no negativity :)
When you make your first App and think you're gonna make a billion https://t.co/lvmhAI6osc
@kelegurl41 I would think using a rake or broom would be better in all cases...except for workload BUT it's better exercise
@thomasbeth I guess they are moving any debris they can find
@CrimUnited haha and by the next day the leaves are back
@Sonny3745 right?! weekends are the worst
@peatbogyeri rakes and brooms are much quieter I would think
@LegionAvalon haha
To whomever invented the leaf blower and those who use it in the morning...you're not getting a Christmas card this year
@downhererocks haha thanks Sarah
@MissDestructo yeah! believe it was Amsterdam we all hung out last...hope you're doing great as well
@MissDestructo "When you reach the top, keep climbing." #NailedIt
@manuhearty thank you!
@CindyWMorrison rock on!
@CindyWMorrison doing great! about to get married, how about yourself? I was there in 2014 but will probably be back out in the near future
@CindyWMorrison It's been 8 years now since you interviewed me in my apartment back in Tulsa I think. Time flies!
@joshavant that would be cool, I've seen a few MVC frameworks, mostly just the VC part, for Swift recently, but a unified lang is 👍
@notbangalore I hope they got a raise for that quick wit
@notbangalore haha nailed it :)
Me and Sarah try to pick out wedding gifts https://t.co/Gj6JPgxYvL
@quinnjoe thanks Joe! hope you're doing great as well
@doctork4u2 doing well! hope you're doing good too
@BairdHall haha, gonna make it big!

@hijiki_nimono I can't perform admin tasks for Twitpic anymore however Twitter support can...sorry I couldn't be of more help :(
@TaiwanBrown thanks!
@VladimMaccabre keeps the relationship entertaining :)
@TedTurnau haha! thanks ;)
@box_art haha thaaanks, it's me doing the impersonation...you'd be surprised how often I pull out that voice
@trapprain but that's no fun ;)
@MANX38 haha that's a good one to do
Sarah hates when I do the Gollum voice https://t.co/UPmR214gdz
@kaweedo perfect score across the board, looks to be a IP reputation issue with Digitalocean
@holmser very little still right now in our beta, 100'ish emails a week if that
@holmser @matthewdeaners ...actually disregard that, email was only to a few outside accounts during testing, probably didn't matter
@holmser @matthewdeaners Appreciate that info. Seems at first email was working fine (low usage &lt; 30/month), then started hitting spam
@interactivered interesting...what kind of volume do you do with that SMTP server?
@interactivered yeah...I think its @digialocean, from my research it seems their IP space is largely considered "spam" by email providers
@noahhlo I assume its @Digitalocean having bad IP rep since we have SPF, DKIM, DMARC, rDNS &amp; emails are well formed. New host is next try :)
@noahhlo great post on email deliverability, does Basecamp still run its own email setup? Running into deliverability issues with my project
@matthewdeaners very interesting...thanks for that info
@matthewdeaners by default do providers mark "new" domains as SPAM until they get more data for rep? For now just mark as not spam to help?
@alexlehm looking into that...thanks!
@lorissantamaria thanks, appreciate that link!
@cnagele thanks Chris for reaching out, just sent you some DMs...I'm a big fan of Wildbit
@jasarmiento09 normally I'd agree, but it's across the board any recipient on gmail, yahoo or outlook from what I can tell...very strange
@trapprain @loudmouthman appreciate it!
@michaelfromuk basically any emailfrom the domain is sent to spam on gmail, yahoo, outlook...no rejection type I can see
@mbolden thank you!
@zslabs met up with @khudsonphillips yesterday &amp; he mentioned you were in CHS. Big fan of DO, hosting @pinglyapp there now
@Sonny3745 thank you!
@IndraniRay thanks Indrani!
@dofollow000 thanks Frank!
@Daniel_Gardner Thanks Daniel! Sending you a DM...
@boknowsfitness thanks bo! Hope you're doing well
@EthanDParker thanks man! I'm looking forward to it
@Bridgetknapek doing a fall wedding and hoping for great weather :)
@MrsTopher thanks Anna!
@TawneeCowan thanks!

@MeetHouSale interesting, I don't own that account...odd that they follow me though...sorry I couldn't be of more help
@Maltagraphics thanks Michaël! It's hard to believe that much time has gone by...I remember when it first came out and signing up.
How to get your app logging to Slack in 15 minutes https://t.co/sYNAe00CxF
@UX_Grant haha yeah! "staged" them in my old apartment...fun times
@IanMCrook @bryanrmartin next time! :)
@mbbertino @cowork you too Matt! thanks having me up, had a great time
@ChaseLivingston great to meet you to man! hit me up if you're ever in Charleston
@chrismerritt thanks for having me out and good meeting ya'll
@bryanrmartin @cowork good meeting you at Zero Day!
@ethanbortnick thanks Ethan! thankful for it all
@jaxsaid twitpic photos are still online https://t.co/72X7x9EPun or do you mean you can't access your account?
@zakstaxi rock on! you should be getting your invite soon...just finishing up one more feature before I send them out
@pablo069eh ha! it was a 5 hour drive to the datacenter too, but yeah that load doesn't look secured
@box_art didn't quite understand their shutdown either, but that's without seeing the numbers
Found this old photo of Twitpic servers in my parents van headed for the datacenter - 7 years ago! Time flies... https://t.co/ED33qJ7L9b
@kriswehner thanks! checking it out now
@dan_jenkins @rem I researched it last night &amp; was pretty shocked how bad it is for US to EU online transactions, even for non-tangible
@MladenPrajdic interesting! thanks for the info
@MladenPrajdic does Paypal file and pay the VAT to the specific country for you or do you have to do that manually yourself?
Developers: What payment tools do you use to deal with EU VAT?
@gregory enjoyed your 90% post, facing some of that with Pingly. Hope you're doing well, long time no talk since my NYC visit!
@derjacboy sweet got your message...just sent a reply back to your email, but got the issue squared away! :)
@derjacboy sorry I missed your tweet from the 7th, can you send your email to noah@pingly.com? I'll check the cause of that error
@NeemiasMartins messaging service, but also works over email and sms so you can talk to anyone regardless of what network they are on
@Mike_Mitrakos hey Mike, sent a message on Pingly about a bug I may have found, could you check that out when you get a chance? Thanks!
@gsf___ haha ok cool...I contacted @digitalocean's support about it too and they referred me to this tutorial https://t.co/nSsw1PDbRM
@gsf___ what distro / version are you running? this is is on @digitalocean too?
You may need to manually change your kernel version in @Digitalocean's control panel to fix CVE-2016-0728, dist-upgrade might not work
@BellaBianca85 Pingly is a messaging app that works with Email and SMS...there's also a little more info on https://t.co/f4kGmYOGZB
Experimenting with a Q&amp;A segment in the next Pingly video - Tweet me any questions regarding Pingly and I'll try to get as many as I can in!
@chrismerritt thanks Chris! looking forward to it
@RalphLHaley rock on! hoping to have more batches of invites going out soon...just finishing up a few features to make Pingly more useful :)
@RalphLHaley saw comment on my Medium post about a beta code, can you submit your email on https://t.co/6kU8a8Rkue? More going out soon!
@ChaseLivingston @whale @cowork great! looking forward to meeting up with you all
@ChaseLivingston @whale haha yeah! I liked the green colors :) I'm actually coming up to @Cowork in March for the Zero Day meetup too
@vlucas rock on...just downloaded it to my iPhone
@Philoushka thanks for subscribing Phil!
@vlucas are you writing each platform independently using Swift / Java or using a cross-platform framework like Ionic?
@vlucas oh cool, looking at it now...I could actually use this with my diet / workout plan
@DelinaDimova so far it's easier and cleaner via Pingly to chat...as far as more connected, I guess I'll know that in time :)
@vlucas let me know when you release it, would like to check it out
@DelinaDimova frustrated with email over years, it's clunky when used to msg ppl, wanted a "chat" style app that worked over other networks
@mrdoob since Twitter acquired it they may have added the comment export, but I'm honestly not for sure, sorry I couldn't be of more help!
@vlucas thanks man! I hope you still do it...would it be about the app we chatted about last year?
@DelinaDimova it's a messaging app the works over Email &amp; SMS, this way even if your contacts aren't on Pingly you can still talk with them
@DelinaDimova thanks Delina! appreciate the kind words
@davemcginn_ie thanks Dave!
@MacgurlLaney1 thank you! glad to hear that
@mattroe thanks for signing up Matt!
@benjaminkohl @Pinglyapp thanks Benjamin!
I'm documenting my experience launching my new startup @Pinglyapp. Here's the first video of the series https://t.co/582tY0QhwM
@johndbro1 that's a greate quote...thanks for the reminder!
@MacgurlLaney1 thanks! glad you enjoyed it
@alysajade glad you enjoyed it, thank you for reading!
@kaushal haha good eye! great movie as well
Would it help? https://t.co/ZhfnxXcVBP
@blakespot thanks for the info...that's been my choice for a while too
"To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing" - a quote worth repeating by Elbert Hubbard #quotes
@tuxflo sweet thanks!
@DJCWrites had a few people suggest that one...I should revisit Tumblr then
@ccming I've seen some companies / apps using Tumblr...curious the benefits vs Medium then if going that route
@GlynPress sweet thanks, don't think I've seen this one before...checking it out
@torie667 sweet, thanks for the info
@alin_cosac thanks!
@aherneamon sweet thanks for the info
@joshriggs thanks I'll check that out...I know enough to get myself in trouble at least ;)
@joshriggs you're not alone...my car recently said it wasn't going to start in a couple hundred miles due to a faulty sensor
@seanrawles ooooh haha...you got me :) good one
@cymplecy haha thanks...wordpress has been my choice as well
@Glycerine wouldn't that be interesting
@chuckle_hound haha interesting analogy, I like it
@joshriggs I've actually never tried that one yet...I'll look into that one, thanks!
@StephenFleming I love Wordpress, been my choice for a while...just curious what other people like &amp; Medium seems to have social built in
@seanrawles that's a new one to me...have a link?
@zoeforman thanks!
@nuclearpengy I've played with it once, need to give it a spin again
@robgt haha true...Medium is free though too correct? However with Wordpress you have infinitely more control
@jsndacruz if they increase the Tweet size to 10k characters then that could be a possibility haha
@robgt love wordpress, used it over the years...I've seen blogs like Signal Vs Noise by Basecamp move to Medium though
@SirWoodtheGood I guess that's what the 'Other' option is for :)
@Adrienhm big fan of Wordpress, used it over the years...what's your reasoning?
What's the blog platform of choice these days? #poll
RT @Pinglyapp: New year, new homepage, new features! https://t.co/p4hpWGhEr1 - First batch of beta invites will be sent out soon
@Ryohara good write up, gonna save that on my end to refer back to...thanks!
@Ryohara oh I gotcha...I'm experimenting with a 'Connections' feature that might be able to help with that or at least prioritize messages
@Ryohara Pingly resides on the consumer side of messaging as a direct messaging app, are you looking more for an email marketing platform?
@Ryohara hey Ryan, thanks for signing up, working on Pingly now as we speak...really close to first batch of beta invites
@konolink I'll check that out, thanks!
@doctork4u2 happy new year to you as well!
@argoneus congratulations man!
@gunderson I should probably give that a try again, it's been a while
@trapprain wow strange! that should be working
@subarurider I was able to set mine up in a few minutes which for the speed improvement I found was worth it &amp; fixed a major bug for me
@ousadoarcade dang, wish I still had admin access to remove orphaned accounts :/ when did you contact Twitter?
@subarurider how so?
@trapprain @gmail hmm...that is odd, what URL are you going to?
@jonathanrobles you too buddy
@c_pavs good to meet you
@stylinchas good to meet you
@DaveMora rock on man! Sounds exciting
@logansease swift!
@DaveMora how you been?
@DaveMora thanks dude! That's a good thing right? Haha
@BrentDanis good meeting you bro
@amyloudye @BillySchrero good to meet ya'll...I'll DM my email regarding the 15th meetup
@anthness ha I like that...good one
@benjaminkohl haha...things have definitely changed quite a bit since the 2009'ish days
@SherrieRose you're welcome, thanks for using Twitpic :)...you as well
@anthness setting -webkit-scrollbar width to 0 works, but you lose the floating scrollbars too or use a jquery scrollbar plugin, both icky
@anthness yeah but only on with OSX where a system setting causing the non-floating scrollbars to display and adds 30'ish pixel padding
@anthness @steve228uk funny you mention it cuz I'm trying to fix this annoying bug on Pingly right now with scrollbars...scrollbars!
@Percona thanks for the fast response!
@Percona any ETA on MySQL 5.7 update for Percona Server? Specifically looking for JSON column support...thanks!
@AndyParas any news on why ABM city parking is increasing pass fees by 40%?
@dlkline75 haha ok I will!
@dlkline75 very cool! heard they had a great time and that they enjoyed dinner nights with ya'll...good meeting ya
@danieldroletsr @StartupGrindCHS thanks Daniel! Great meet up and looking forward to it.
@imjonathanlee thanks Jon!
@adamparish yeah phenomenal show, hopefully get the chance to see them again
@Cherelynn yeah! they were really great live
@Gunntwitt that's really cool, I would like to go to VR one day
@MgoblueMATT was a great show, my first time seeing them live...I grew up as a kid / teenager to their music! good times
@benmarks was a great show!
@Gunntwitt that's awesome, when?
Third eye blind! #BucketListBand https://t.co/RS6RrJZj5P
@soundboy45 yeah we made it through!
@pastormatthewh sorry I missed ya'll when we came up to visit @MrsTopher!
@benmarks are you using Docker?
@benmarks for sure, hit me up when you're back...not currently, looking into Ansible / Vagrant for dev and possibly Docker for production
@dailybarid thanks Khaled
@benmarks curious myself...currently use Vagrant, but if some of the steps can be truly automated that would be nice
@PaulDaugherty paul! Congrats on the growing family and being pastor of Victory, makes me happy to see
Starting is half the battle. Not stopping is the rest.
@EthanDParker @bhorowitz approval, praise etc

@konolink ...DM your email used to sign up and I can check if you like
@konolink if you received the emailed link &amp; submitted your username via that link then it's reserved, no email is sent after though...
@konolink not dead, took a vacation after Twitter acquired Twitpic. Pingly has an updated roadmap too but you're right needs a status update
@downhererocks thanks!
@MrsTopher great to see ya'll! had a blast
@DanPriceSeattle good read in the NYT about you and your company, hope the best for you all
@sana_irony contact Twitter support for deletion issues. I don't have access to admin tasks for Twitpic, sorry I couldn't help more :/
@onetimedragon contact Twitter support for orphaned accounts. I don't have access to admin tasks for Twitpic, sorry I couldn't help more :/
@cometbus hmm, wonder if Twitter changed something. Have you contacted their support? I don't have access to Twitpic admin since acquisition
@chocoolady will do!
@cometbus ...your photo archive from the settings page
@cometbus Twitpic has been using Twitter's auth system for around 5 years...once you login to Twitpic through your Twitter you can request..
@cometbus Twitpic uses Twitter login button...have you tried using the forgot password feature on Twitter to reset the password?
@chocoolady that would be fun, Sarah has never been to Canada
Storm rolled in with last night's sunset http://t.co/2HVpAXNtEQ

@Titanfallgame since last updates game crashes either when match is loading or during game play, sound freezes then crashes...any ideas?
@ilsecreepy that's odd you can't login to delete, I'm unable to perform that admin task now, Twitter support can fix that for you though
@ilsecreepy sure, what's your issue? I'm no longer with Twitpic so some admin tasks I can't do anymore but I'll do my best :)

@LovingDalston ok great to hear...contact me or @Twitpicsupport (it's monitored as well) if you have any future issues
@LovingDalston when you say text only or nothing appears, as in Twitpic isn't posting to your Twitter feed or it's not uploading to Twitpic?

@mbanzon @grosen @noahsoldman another bug (I should have tested more before tweeting), now back to 3k-4k/sec, however I'm still impressed!
@grosen sure, hit me up at noah@twitpic.com and we can setup a time
@grosen will probably open source it, just gotta clean up the dirty code
@mbanzon gonna clean up code then throw it on Github. Simple ab from a server with a fat pipe to prevent bandwidth bottleneck
@noahsoldman testing on a live blog post actually
@_hannahbeasley weird! does that for me too on my iphone. I *think* the DNS hasn't propagated, but I will debug...thanks for heads up!

@jonathanmalkin ...another is cutting through the fluff out of messages to get to the point (signatures, reply text, etc) and another is...
@jonathanmalkin hey Jonathan, I like the term enhance or evolve. Developer pains is one area we wan to make better with a simple API...
@davemcquaid awesome, thank you for the feedback

@JahJames @hamsterwatch @echofon awesome, great to hear
@vivianjoann found an issue yesterday that could have been causing this &amp; I believe we have fixed it, let me know if you still have issues

@Borthwick sweet...updated and checking it out now
@vivianjoann still happening?
@hamsterwatch ...are they posting ok for you now?
@hamsterwatch sorry late in responding, there was a posting issue on the 4th, it was fixed later that day, pics should have posted now

@JahJames ok thanks for that info, I’ll try to get in touch with @echofon to see what’s up
@JahJames the echofon preview doesn’t load the larger twitpic either?
@JahJames if you tap that tweet does it load a larger version or take you to http://t.co/eR7FXsApfZ?
@JahJames @hamsterwatch @BgNicar very strange, tested thumbnail api for that image &amp; it worked here...wonder if @echofon changed something?
@hamsterwatch @JahJames @BgNicar what happens when you try to view the twitpic on Echofon? do they usually display automatically?
@hamsterwatch anytime, feel free to email me anytime you have a question or issue…thank you for using twitpic
@daarzan ok thanks for that info, looking into which network is putting those through now
@hamsterwatch @daarzan ...my email noah@twitpic.com. I apologize again for that, those ads are against our ToS, looking into how it got in
@hamsterwatch @daarzan hmm that shouldn't be happening, very sorry about that...do you happen to have a screenshot you could send to me?...
@vivianjoann looking into it now
Storm rolling through http://t.co/594jWToLVt

@DannyCLT I'm actually from Salisbury originally...right down the road from you
@vivianjoann unfortunately that is on Twitter's side of things...they determine when to display the "View Photo" option
@vivianjoann what size / kind of image is the upload failing on?
@XboxSupport2 un/replugged kinect, turned xbox one off / on, it came back on...hopefully it stays connected, I'll msg back if it doesn't
@Ravenmyste @VicD_BigCaneFan @XboxSupport did this fix disconnect issue  permanently for you?
@VicD_BigCaneFan @XboxSupport ...sorry spoke to soon, just googled factory reset...thanks!
@VicD_BigCaneFan @XboxSupport interesting, thanks for the heads up...can a factory reset be done by me or do I have to send it in?
@XboxSupport xbox one kinect sensor disconnects randomly, have to unplug / plug it back in for the xbox to sense it again...what's the fix?
@vivianjoann should be working again now, sorry for the delay in posting
Working from the kitchen today…I mean office http://t.co/lll3UsRNg0
Brain: "Remember that great idea you had?...Me neither"
@Respawn @titanfallgame thanks for killing my productivity lately!...j/k, Titanfall is my new favorite game
@pingly got a quick question for you when you have a minute noah@twitpic.com
@justinvanbogart dude congrats on the @jaguars draft streaming
@RoseMichels yeah! it was worth the jokes growing up "Noah, where's the ark?"
@Shadamehr I need to watch all of them again now
@EthanDParker haha that's what I don't want happening...also: "google fiber provo, ut"...I'm jealous
@Astro_Clay I know right?! haha
Most popular baby names for 2013 were Noah &amp; Sophia?! Heeeck naaaw...there can be only one! #Highlander
@ellenpstebbins just got it and replied...thanks!
@blogomomma sorry meant to say sign out / in haha...sorry for the issue, hope that fixes it :)
@blogomomma a Twitpic hit your account 2hs ago but looks it didn't post to Twitter...try signing in / out of the app to refresh the tokens
@blogomomma hmm ok...which app are you using?
@blogomomma which method did you use to post to Twitpic? through an app or via email?
@edstetzer just saw the tweet to @TwitpicSupport, that definitely should not be happening...do you have a link that we can investigate?
@vivianjoann ok good! haven't seen that error before...I'll do research, was this from your phone or computer? Also what size was the image?
@vivianjoann you're getting this error on http://t.co/eR7FXsApfZ, the "IO error"?
@AshleyHasna haha yes...but I was homeschooled for most of my years so I didn't get that "luxury"...win?
@box_art haha...part of that is true, not telling which :)
@eddiemonge I should do that to
@Chris1966 haha nice
@AshleyHasna it would be neat to see our past selves and the style choices we made in a video montage
@dulcedia 14 years later and I ask myself "what happened" haha
@Laney_ yeah! that was "in" then...I think
@MrsTopher the good'ol days right :)
Mom sent over my first driver's license pic circa 2000...I was the 6th backstreet boy http://t.co/4DPEPaSWVu
@JeffGoins @nathanbarry good quote
@nathanbarry ...also enjoy your writings and books...good stuff
@nathanbarry I like this quote from your blog "You can outlast those who are lucky and out-work those who are lazy."
@KingBeanRoaster thanks for the fast response Katie!
@KingBeanRoaster love your la dolce vita for espresso...how do we get setup with the downtown delivery? we are near east bay &amp; broad
@LiveWorkRecord good call
Bridge over Charleston harbor (or hahbah if you’re from	Boston) http://t.co/t5knmAT3sU
@justinvanbogart yeah sounds great...coffee sometime this month or early next?
@justinvanbogart stream looks cool
@kyleisom thanks for the follow back, checked out your @gocrypto book, great job...really interested n using Golang in future projects
@DIRECTVService great, thanks for the fast response
@DIRECTVService ...monitored and tested internet / wireless connection and they are solid, any ideas? been happening for a couple months
@DIRECTVService having issues genie on demand, d/ls start, but get stuck / stop at random points (i.e. 34% or 73% downloaded)...
@lalalacosteDC the peeps over at @Fuzzco do great work and @blueion as well
@Marc_IRL thanks for the fast response...changed password just in case
@Marc_IRL got an email "Minecraft Username list" saying someone requested a list of usernames for my email...any concerns or is this ok?
Two fish are in a tank. One says, "How do you drive this thing?"...bada-boom-tsh
@vivianjoann are you still having an issue logging in?
@willister86 please do! noah@twitpic.com
@willister86 man I would love a classic one day…friend had a ‘67 fastback mustang we’d cruise around in as teenagers, the good’ol days
@willister86 yessir
@humphe it may be too blurry
@Laney_ nice! what kind of porshe
@D3M0N5P4WN I was speeding, don't tell anyone
@Laserdisc I up'd the saturation a bit to help the numbers pop out...not actually that bright :)
Music &amp; miles (bonus points if you can read the odometer hint: my favorite series of numbers) http://t.co/3XepTpx3aS
@jonathan_dejong don't read Twitter! spoilers everywhere
@aewhite I honestly didn't think it was coming this soon
@argreer21 that guy is brutal...curious what his fate is, surely it has to be bad
@YCHHCT yeah! finally
@acrobatic right?! now what do I have to look forward to?...oh dragons...yeah
@ClareRickman yuuup...squealing, cheering, it's all the same right?
@AdorkableWife yeah I squealed like a school girl
@Jerroldnthe209 psh I know who I am ;)
Has anyone else been waiting for last night's episode of GoT for a while? Yuuup #GameOfThrones
@zeraking ah yeah that may be the issue, some JS files are being served from the local server not CDN...thanks for the heads up
@zeraking interesting...media files are loaded via CDN...I'll look into it more
@zeraking which URL is slow for you? have not experienced that on my end since we moved to new hardware
@zeraking the team has chatted about that idea before...it would need a good amount of "packaging" to be opensource'able
Slight delay on app release...paper work, paper work...more paper work
@Eric_Boeckmann @SydneyWooood me? did I lose a UNC bet or something?
@willister86 @kevinhuguley bam! Thanks guys. I appreciate it
@kevinhuguley thanks man! looking forward to your new album in June
@SuriouslyFoReal just glad I had pants on this time...good seeing you buddy
@RoseMichels nailed it! yaaay
Language defines the product. The use of it is important when trying to convey your product's message....Apple does this well #uxdesign
@kenusmansmith11 haha
@Bensonix I believe it's from crawlers and bots indexing new content on Twitpic (i.e. Google, Twitter, etc)
@Axe_Grrl I learned about that one yesterday too...normally I would have used one of the others
@BrittMichaelian still learning :)
@adamparish thanks Adam, would love your feedback on it when we release it
@GreenbergRichie haha! yet another good one
@KrisSn @TwitPic thanks Kristin!
@abackstrom yeah! another one
@CityCharleston can we pay parking tickets online?
@_iMoritz for sure...when it's announced in April we'll open the beta user form as well to receive your login URL in the following weeks
@mattcassinelli yes please! thank you
@RoseMichels haha you caught it?! I like being corrected when I'm wrong...helps me get better!
@mattcassinelli @garyvee sweet! we're opening it up in early April for beta users...hopefully you and others will find it useful
@mattcassinelli thanks for following, big fan of @garyvee and what you guys are doing
@thejrod thanks for the retweet...forgive my peak / peek misuse ;)
@Daniel_Gardner long term both...off the bat, web app
@elisabethmunfor yeah, noah: 0 / grammar police: 1...also a fan of @tenthavenorth
@TheOneAW spell check didn't help either since peak is a word as well
@TheCammyGirl I feel like there is a song with those lyrics
@ilovemppb I called the grammar police on myself #whoopwhoop
@menehunemedia I must be confused about something :) Offer for hug still stands though...also Wildcats kicked butt yesterday
@KenFromChicago hard for the brain / spell checkers to catch since they are real words
@suziecuez spell check couldn't catch it either since it is technically a word, but wrong context
@scribblygum ah yes...I may get the later one wrong as well
@notsoprivaterye that's another good one
@taximanpaul actually what we're launching isn't related to Twitter at all...it is in the messaging app genre though
@cantoodesign haha
@McRieger at least I can say I know two languages...english and bad english
@Jill_Sinclair not really, but then after re-reading I felt stupid :)
@alysonshane I even re-read the tweet multiple times before posting and my brain didn't catch it
@billiegirltoo good one haha
One of the few (only) things I can pride myself with is getting there/their/they're correct...yet today I used peak instead of peek #isuck
@menehunemedia it's a scam because I misspelled a word? you need a hug today or something?
@sh4t of course cupcake
@AlexMonaghanUK @YesScotland OH! haha did not even realize...that's cool!
@jsimonny thanks J!
@DerailleurAgile haha! with the way some critics are, I could definitely see that happening
@designer_mike I noticed that recently too (after I had already designed the current logo)...it's modified from a font icon set
Quote to live by this year: “To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.”...get messy
@AlexMonaghanUK @YesScotland that my spacing is off or that it makes an X? :)
@neueanthony thanks Anthony :)
@stripe the design &amp; UI of https://t.co/eqXS2yG2Db is on point, great job
@MattStopa looks good to me...especially the hashes part, since I always have to google on those when using / working with them
@MattStopa word...just bought it
@DanGlickman we'll have beta signups when we announce it in April...thanks for being interested in beta testing!
@MattStopa sure...I don't have a kindle, but if I purchase it can I still view it somehow?
@suziecuez thanks!
@MattStopa ...just found your book, very slick...I fully made the switch to RoR only about 2 years ago...late to the game
@MattStopa BUT with more synergy, growth hacking and buzzwords...buzzwords everywhere
@dulcedia you can post video to Twitter via @Twitpic
To clarify: announcing app first week of April, then sending links out to our beta users shortly after http://t.co/b09RO2FfLI
@s2hlifeofme which one...the newest one?
@billyarnie haha love the name
@judebpereira haha no, but I see it now...that's the 3rd iteration of the logo
@MrVitruvianBoy a relative of that genre
@judebpereira in that genre
@Daniel_Gardner for sure Daniel...we will have beta signups in early April
@brookwarner announcing first week of April...good guess
@RoseMichels the "uvula" as I call it is centered &amp; 2-toned color, but I see where you're coming from...it's actually a modified icon font
@grosen thanks Greg! announcing it the first week of April
@steveh11 that would be interesting on some of the emails I receive that I have a hard time reading
@CameronRawson busting at the seams to announce! you'll see soon :)
Announcing a new app in April, here's a peak at the logo http://t.co/kTko6bkdbn
@theharborac thanks for setting up the event and for the nice lunch!
@fscottmoody thanks again for hanging out with us today at @theharborac...great to meet you
@ComposerBarton been playing Titanfall all week &amp; your soundtrack is the best I've ever heard on a game, looking forward to the release
@charlesgaudet hey Charles, thanks for the shout out
@GovtAuctions touché
@robniep whaaaat, dude thanks for that, was on the way to game stop and they only give 25…thanks!
...screw it, I'll just trade it in for Titanfall
@RaiDeR53StRoNg haha exactly...I can't handle bf4
@box_art guess I just need to get used to the dynamics of BF4...my aiming is awful compared to CoD
@tweet_stratford the aiming / shooting dynamics of Battlefield 4 are way different than CoD and so I suck at it haha
Since I suck at Battlefield 4, anyone have CoD Ghosts on Xbox One they want to trade straight up? To keep shipping cheap can do US only
@GumroadHelp great!...thanks for the fast reply
@AloofPromos haha...I'm not for sure, but I'm sure one could be made fairly easily
@gumroad @GumroadHelp just opened an account with you and while editing a product, my account got suspended...what's up?
@FieldLinc you too, cool stuff you are doing
@vivianjoann easiest way would be to manually post the Twitpic to Twitter with the caption you want...am I understanding that correctly?
@The_SoJo @SAGECanada sweet! thanks for using the quote
@DaveRinSF @Matt_Grimshaw still true today even when having a team...thanks for the shout out
@The_SoJo and even more so now than when I said that :)...thanks for the shout out
@NishankKhanna thanks for the shout out
@BethanyBonner that's really cool
@MamaNiAnya I believe just nominated
@SirWoodtheGood haha
@AnonSpeaker unbelievable
@BethanyBonner riiiight?
@tomjenen yeah you are right, he's usually in the supporting role
@CheesePlez +1
@Jana_Lamb yeah :/
@neilfairbrother samsies
@cbaugnon haha yeah, however Jonah Hill nailed it in Wolf of Wall street
@IScentYouADay I agree
@clrfldcdaughtry crazy
@GodEmperorLeto agreed
@Saurini it *appears* that dramas are more likely to win? that's a guess, nothing scientific
@GeeksOfChrist his range is incredible
You know who else has never won an Oscar? Gary Oldman...let that marinate for a second #TheChameleon
@SweetFaceTrishy haha!
@hatzelvela that’s what makes ppl talk about / watch reality tv
@RoseMichels haha…I’ll try when it’s light outside
@Laney_ no haha
My house in the background! Haha! #southerncharm #bravo
@lalalacosteDC haha
@lskrocki @Bravotv haha! Thank you…the characters are hilarious
@jh32488 haha now it does
@jh32488 that’s awesome…great shots of Charleston…are the characters acting or being for real?
Don’t normally watch Bravo but #SouthernCharm was filmed by my house near Broad Street and this stuff is…hilarious…yeah…
@gopumago right on, I agree, but curious if you have seen in general if puma holds up to torquebox
@vivianjoann you can put up unlimited photos on Twitpic...yeah been back for about a week now, good to be home
@gopumago currently using torquebox on a project, but looking into switching to puma...any benchmarks out there comparing the two?

@nirvdrum @JEG2 nothing out the ordinary so far for rails and I personally haven't seen any break...yet! :)
@nirvdrum @JEG2 ran into issues with gems not being compatible with JRuby or is that rare?
@JEG2 haha...we rely heavily on caching to keep our db's from getting swamped...also SSD for DB has been a HUGE improvement
@JEG2 ah! did not know that...thanks again for the info, gonna run some benchmarks on my end to simulate our traffic load
@JEG2 for a high traffic / load site (aka Twitpic) would you recommend JRuby over 2.1 MRI?
@JEG2 ok that makes better sense now...thanks for explaining
@JEG2 ...also am I understanding correctly that JRuby is threaded while Ruby isn't thread safe? So JRuby can do parallel processing?
@JEG2 I've seen some benchmarks (http://t.co/XvNLseDUS7) that show Ruby 2.1 as fast or faster than JRuby, is that true?...
@ellenpstebbins sure sounds good, I'm currently in France, but will be back in a week or so, let's sync up then
@lskrocki thanks Linda!
@phidip does it do the same thing if you search from http://t.co/KzHZPf6JWu? that's really strange
@debbienews thanks Debbie!
@phidip which tweet is it saying that on?
@LillyLyle thanks Lilly!
@annie4567 oh haha, good idea, we should have done that...maybe for 7th birthday then?
@annie4567 @TwitPic what kind of videos?
@RoseMichels thanks Rose
@gangajhal thank you much!
@TCCHSMeetup will do, ping'd some people at the local @theharborac to see if they knew of anyone

@TCCHSMeetup in France currently, otherwise I would stop by...hopefully next time
Twitpic is 6 years old today! Hacked together the first version over a weekend in February 2008
@WeirdRichie ok thanks for letting me know, I'm sorry for that again, working to get those removed...not ok for our ad standards
@philgrahambiz ok thanks!...thought I was losing it yesterday when it wasn't working haha
@philgrahambiz ...also odd question, do these replies show up in your mentions and interactions? I've been having odd results lately with it
@philgrahambiz thanks for the shout out Phil
@WeirdRichie ...I removed some of the ad networks in your area, are you still seeing that issue?
@gangajhal I got some of Notre Dame last week when I was in Paris...I'll see if I can find a good one to post
@jessilynnzee haha! get you some
@WeirdRichie do you know what ad was displaying when that happened? that's definitely against our ad rules, sorry for that!
@JEG2 great to hear man!
@JEG2 long time no talk, how are things going in Oklahoma? I haven't been back in years, I miss the ruby meetups

@notierequired @Heello try now
@jon really like your blog layout / design at http://t.co/APBFtBmrw1 had to look at the source to figure out it was wordpress...nice work
@CdnBrat ...I'll do some research for a solution...thanks for letting me know
@CdnBrat Twitter's spam detection usually picks it up but it takes a re-login for Twitpic to catch it...I agree though we need better...
@piccolan your face
@gangajhal ended up making crepes ironically
@ARTORICAL good idea...a banana would actually go great with this

@chuckle_h0und @bmw I would think compress the nav down so the "choose your path..." would be a drop down option
@HipCindy @bmw thanks!...yeah, it could be refined to have more options to show a gallery, specs, etc
@bmwusa @bmw @bmwgroup @bmwi what do you guys think of this BMW website concept I mocked up today? https://t.co/KLXJmgTJlo let me know!
@d4rk5eed it could be...basically it would hold everything no related to navigation about their vehicle models
@sivaparvati @bmw thanks for the feedback
@SirWoodtheGood going for a good price?
@notierequired thanks! and fixing the heello box....again
@EnchantedKass hey! didn't realize you had moved...for sure hit me up next time you are in
@prplhaze @bmw don't see why not...the nav is simple enough it wouldn't be too hard
@LukasTeijema @bmw it's just a PSD to PNG render for now
@PolCPP yeah probably...I really liked the flat one though
@dr_mario_XXX @bmw then they shouldn't be driving a bmw! haha just kiiiiding...but seriously
@FrantzdyRomain @bmw haha true...big fan of their cars...site could use some uncluttering
@ajisafe_rasaq I appreciate it
@grosen @bmw thanks for replying Greg
@Smutchings @bmw thanks!
Here's a concept website I made for @bmw since their current one feels a little dated, let me know what you think! http://t.co/RD7eqQgvRy

@averyj @paulsingh thanks James for the shout out, you guys are rocking at Adzerk - Hey Paul, I live in Charleston, when are you visiting?
@bren_fdez @sonamoo101 very nice, I'll check that out
@DavidKirby1 haha well thank you, I wish I was a founder of Twitter, but just Twitpic ;)
@gangajhal we didn't go in actually, just looked around outside and took a boat down to the eiffel tower after
@MrEAnders we were there yesterday so I guess we missed her by a day...booo

@needshortername haha yeah…cheese comment was an afterthought
@noggleme you gotta watch smallville!
@DrugstorCowboy haha that I would like to hear
@noggleme Paris or that cathedral?
@MuffinLukez15 romance level is kicked up a few notches…in english doesn’t have the same effect
Watching smallville reruns dubbed in French will change your world
@Dukester really beautiful area
@shinsuke2u yeah! Really nice area

@schezar @Razzmuna false economy? not for us, they have been profitable since the beginning…they are just ugly, that’s my complaint
@schezar that is an option unfortunately for free services in the long run that doesn’t help them, services will have to make money somehow
@schezar the ads should be attractive and try to play nice with adblock’s guidelines
Startup idea: an @AdSense competitor with great customer service, more ad types + native units &amp; ads for moderated / non-moderated content
@armanddp still trying to track them down, whoever they are they are a pain
@danimaxton what price range would be acceptable to you?
@arthurakay yeah I’m a fan of that model as well
@Daniel_Gardner yeah along with native ads would be a big improvement…spinning up native ads to be sustainable is one challenge
@taylorholiday interesting idea…researching that
@LongClint I agree, working to get that permanently fixed asap by removing that advertiser
@trapprain so the screen shot you just posted shows up when you view a twitpic still?
@Llaguitas did you get your Twitpic account situation resolved? If not I can help you with that
@Koustubha_D native ads would improve the ad situation
@ArturoGVilla revenue via ads works great for us, I just don’t like ads
@thatskooll users do already own their photos and can sell them if they wish…but a way to help users sell their photos is an option
@lewisscottESM native ads would be better…building out the platform / team for that would take money / time but doable
@trapprain are you still getting the redirect? we have most ads turned off
@vandershraaf a challenge we’ve had is finding ad networks who can handle our traffic volume, @google is one but they don’t play nice now
@Nilius native ads would look much better, right now we are using 3rd party ad networks who’s ad quality isn’t the best
@gabrielvisconti pro version is an option
@janesinsane that wasn’t supposed to be happening, but for some users it was, trying to nail that down
@No_Supermarket ads are what pay the bills, Twitpic has never taken any funding
@ronarcher43 well Twitpic has to have some revenue, but I honestly detest ads
@Nilius as in nobody would pay for photo / video sharing with no ads?
@brucestockwell thought about a paid version…selling users we committed to not doing in the beginning
@ronarcher43 I’m aware of adblock, but that doesn’t solve the revenue stream issue if we remove ads
@realjuliemallen native ads are a better option
@rephraser I’ve heard of them…at scale though, would users tip / flattr?
@No_Supermarket right, but that doesn’t solve our revenue stream if we remove ads :)
@jshoq I would love us to not have them, I'm all ears for other revenue streams for Twitpic. Suggestions?
I hate ads…I would love @twitpic to not have ads…any suggestions on revenue streams besides advertising that is sustainable? I’m all ears
RT @TwitPic: We apologize for the mobile ad causing redirects from Twitpic, that is against our ad rules and we're working to remove the ad…
@aakarpost @anildash @30AcreFortress yeah both apps have a planned rework + site
@anildash @30acrefortress it’s alright, I understand…I’m frustrated with it too / the state of advertising, would love no ads one day
@anildash @30AcreFortress yeah…it’s a hard one to track down, I haven’t been able to recreate &amp; I *think* it’s coming through a 3rd party
@30AcreFortress @anildash @ztibbitts ...I apologize for this, It's frustrating me so I can't imagine how frustrated you are
@30AcreFortress @anildash I'm working to find / remove the ad network causing the redirects, that is def against our advertising terms...
@trapprain we’ve turned off some advertisers we think it may be coming from, can you try again and let me know if it’s fixed or not?
@trapprain this is happening on your phone correct not on your laptop or desktop?
@trapprain @domhuntman @michaelroston you could but doesn’t help us in the long run, appreciate your patience as I work to track this down
@trapprain @domhuntman @michaelroston we’re contacting all our ad networks to get these off asap
@walrashoud @dth working to find the advertiser doing that &amp; remove them, that is against our advertising terms, thanks for letting me know
@trapprain does it automatically take you there? if so that should not be happening
@DirtyHouseGuy oh ok…yeah you are right, we need to update more frequently
@DirtyHouseGuy tweeting as in twitpic’s aren’t posting to Twitter or @Twitpic hasn’t tweeted from our account in a while?

@alderin yeah...possible mine one of the lower workload crypto currencies?
@soundboy45 say byebye to your battery life...it would need limits somehow...but the current workload factor is probably the biggest block
@soundboy45 yeah or can those transaction logs be shared among multiple users?

@BUSYBEE8 I think so, but I'm not 100% for sure
@MontyWestmeyer the story wouldn't need much embellishing, it's already kind of hard to believe
@nbits60 released to the public or in production?
@JBowdacious actually released to the public or starting production? My benchmark was actually released in theaters to the public

@MacTaylors_Girl yeah v11.1
@engybingy I downloaded / installed via itunes, but yeah it was a similar error message
@MacTaylors_Girl yeah I don't believe it is…it asked me to download the new iTunes
@podgydad good…that's what I'm hoping
@ChrisVonDenmark it didn't for me, but I would back up your iPhone before you start the install
@rpanne very true
@neilkite try it when you are looking at your app icons, not when an app is active
@MacTaylors_Girl just different…not my style, but maybe in a few days I will see the light
@neilkite pull down on the screen when you aren't inside of an app
@engybingy hmm…it did that to me the first time about half way through the download, worked the second time
@jonathanrobles I should probably give it a few days before I make a decision eh? :)
@Laney_ first issue I had was light backgrounds make the icon text hard to read
@Xzyliac it's different, that's for sure…i'll probably love it in a few days

@MarkFunk I think it's AT&amp;T only since I bought it from the store on a renewed 2-year att contract
@NathanBLawrence nice, I didn't think they were going for that much
@iPhone4Jay sounds like I'll be putting this thing up on ebay or something then
@jkwong8623 yeah I think it's in my closet...probably unused earbuds too
@holmesy1969 really now...that's great to hear
@KrissLavax hmm I don't think it is...bummer
@MarkFunk unlocked as in carrier or jailbroken?
@mattauckland is it working out well?
@leoofborg what does blacklisting do?
@dcolebatch just heard about that, I'll check it out
@quellhorst interesting...maybe I'll start the auction low and see where it goes from there
@alancarrico haha don't know how I could sign the phone without scratching it
@jtretakoff i'll check that out, thanks
@Music_Mystery not a money thing, just no need to have an extra iphone laying around after getting the iphone 5 #MinimalistLife
Thinking about auctioning off my iPhone 4s / AT&amp;T / Black / 64gb / Great condition. Trying to gauge interest? Price would be around $200
@amblin I see what you're saying. To answer your question, out of the gate no, heello is as bare bones as possible now, users will evolve it
@helloMonsterCA android will come out hopefully not too long after launch...no tablet version yet. a beta is opening up in a week or 2
@amblin at launch we'll support Twitter / Facebook posting, but via the API you can make it post to anything or eventually a push API
@amblin yes via the api, it's our hope developers will build what they find useful and needs like that being filled by them
@amblin does that answer the question correctly?
@amblin @Heello users will always own their data, data export, posting to other services &amp; an open API to extend the platform
@helloMonsterCA the ads for heello will most likely be in stream ads, tailored to user's interest
@martinfredin @Heello sweet, I appreciate the input, that helps us gauge pricing better. we'll experiment over time too
@TLBurriss same here, especially if they're well placed, organic to the content &amp; intelligently present me with stuff I'm interested in
@doctork4u2 you're all good
@martinfredin @Heello well that's actually good to hear haha...facebook makes only around a buck per month per user in the US
@schezar very interesting...what's the tool?
@martinfredin @Heello around $3 bucks a month...which is like $0.10 a day
@nr very cool, let me know what you decide, I love hearing new ways of monetizing other than ads
@martinfredin I'm not saying a one-time fee couldn't work, I just think for our case with @heello a recurring fits better
@AlbanyCA how is facebook proof of that? They have a boat load of funding and have been generating over a billion in revenue for a few years
@nr we'll do a recurring fee, but the recurring fee would be way lower than a one-time charge
@martinfredin the one-time fee is harder for a company to sustain from A) higher up front charge &amp; B) that requires fresh users constantly
@Genesyn yeah I'm not for sure why they are hiding the fact that they need/want to make money...provide a great product, be up front, profit
@W_Goddard complete rewrite from the ground up of what you were last using
@HeatherSolos haha I'm downtown now on Cordes st near The Griffon, come by sometime
@schezar which is fine if only a few users did that, but if every user was blocking ads the site wouldn't make any money and go under
@LomaBeast which I'm curious why more apps don't do a hybrid of both, keeps the doors open to everybody but offers an option for power users
@martinfredin if done right it could, but ideally every user paying a small fee would be better or a hybrid of both
@mandramas but technically a good product that evolves shouldn't have to go away, be honest with users, apps need to make money to pay bills
@jaredwsmith until we find trained hamsters to run the generator wheels for the servers, we're stuck!
@HeatherSolos I could not help my selfs :)
@Genesyn true
@swishyTM haha...in a perfect world
@W_Goddard been working on Heello! :)
...we're doing a hybrid approach with the new @heello. Ads for those who don't want to pay, and a paid no-ad option http://t.co/0VHEvHII
...as users of free services on the web, we need to learn to embrace ads or find a paid alternative
...Startup launches app / Gets funding (stays free) / Gains lots of users / Gets acquired / New owner shuts it down or turns on money valve
Have we not learned the cycle yet? Free apps must monetize at some point, servers cost money, employees cost money. The trend is...

@warrencbennett a billion dollars of investor money breathing down their neck
@Milnoc @heello to the rescue
@EvanWagstaff very protective wording on their part
@warrencbennett agreed...would the hudson plane crash photo have been shared on Twitter without 3rd party photo apps?

@spmunoz "Fat, sick and nearly dead" documentary to get the idea / plan
@oliviaolovely1 watched "Fat, sick and nearly dead" documentary to get the idea / plan
@diana_dawn nah it's good for you...all the nutrients you need minus digestion, but talk to your doc first
@juliamelv good job...takes some will power! i.e. you should stay home while you do it and away from temptations haha
@CakesandEvents def consult a doc before starting it
@acwilsonwriter what's that?
@chrissieroyal good exercise and eating plan will be needed after the juice diet
@Dommeh about a week
@Nikki_Leigh79 followed "Fat, sick and nearly dead" documentary for the plan
@6865jul got it from the documentary: "Fat, sick and nearly dead"
@LaciLewis wow very nice
@Mam1andLyn first few days were rough, energy levels low, then it started to pick up, but dinner time hunger was the worst
@Dommeh drink nothing but fresh juice from veggies / fruit for meals
@wigwambrighton haha unfortunately it doesn't
Update on the juice fast: completed just under half the days I was shooting for. It works, just takes some will power. Lost 11lbs in 5 days
@jonathanrobles how's T town?
@ChaseLivingston sounds great...I love Greenville, beautiful city
@Palleas you and me both brother...well to get it to the public on my end :)
@ChaseLivingston I hope it's open platforms...communication shouldn't be controlled only by a board room who's intent is usually profits
@ChaseLivingston just like any gold rush, eventually it wears thin
2008 was the wild west of social…my, how it has changed
@X3DModels yeah, twitpic / heello are still being developed
