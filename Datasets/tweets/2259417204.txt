@SabrinaKoala Anecdotal evidence is totally fine but I don‚Äôt see pure anecdotal evidence as the root of any quality discussion
@JoeyDaniewicz @SabrinaKoala I just like in person conversations better. Body language and tonal inflection are key. It could be recorded and tweeted out if the people really care besides a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù question
@SabrinaKoala It‚Äôs backwards to assume a free speech resolution would seek to curb your rights on this campus. MSA is here to help promote the safety and self actualisation of all members of our campus community. I hope with time and better input this resolution becomes something you support
@SabrinaKoala I‚Äôm confident in our elected leaders to do their jobs and read resolutions before forum. 		I have been at lawful protests and in situations of civil disobedience. It‚Äôs easy to understand the difference between the two. Civil disobedience is by definition disobedience and damaging
@SabrinaKoala Good, thanks. 		There‚Äôs a concern by most politically minded students on both sides of the aisle that their voices will be silenced by others.		I mean identity politics as using belief systems and personal identities to complete an argument instead of articulated reasoning
@SabrinaKoala For any readers- forum is public and recorded. The full discussion of the resolution is online on @msaUMN‚Äôs Facebook
@SabrinaKoala That‚Äôs just not the case. People are are detained if they violate laws. Peaceful protest on public property breaks no laws. You know this
@SabrinaKoala See this is why I wanted to sit down and talk. People miss points and make assumptions on online forums and nothing gets done
@SabrinaKoala The issue is there‚Äôs no status quo. The current situation is a woefully outdated policy and that‚Äôs why the student body has seen no headway on hate speech issues here on campus. The resolution is a recommendation to the taskforce that will recommend policy to the board of regents
@SabrinaKoala Respectfully, I meant in the political theory respect. I‚Äôm not here to back up any party, that would be in bad taste. Those groups should not be second class citizens within our country
Yo I‚Äôm just tryna make the world a better place why can‚Äôt we get coffee https://t.co/cjQrlJuuTn
@SabrinaKoala I don‚Äôt support hate speech or the likes, and believe there should be a solution found, especially on our campus, but resorting to identity politics only furthers the divides on our campus that have caused the silencing and hate speech that we both hate
@SabrinaKoala It‚Äôs important to give voice to those we disagree with so that we can further develop our own viewpoints in line with our morals and values. When a party is shut out of a discussion, everyone is hurt. Groupthink only benefits in situations where groups are silenced.
@SabrinaKoala Agressive but sure. I would have bought you coffee. While I‚Äôd like there to be a limited definition of hate speech that defends civil liberties while promoting respectful discourse, that doesn‚Äôt exist within current legal frameworks. The MSA resolution was written by our GLA team
@SabrinaKoala I am a current At Large Representative. As someone who understands the necessity of holding our university to both the law and the protection of democracy's marketplace of ideas, I support this resolution. Please dm me if you'd like to have a constructive in person discussion.
