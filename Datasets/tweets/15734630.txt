@Dax_x98 @fahyhallowell One of the many things that validate my atheism is "trump was chosen by god." I refuse to worship any god that thinks trump is a good idea

@umedyn OK, I want to end this circle jerk. If you're trying to tell me bernie sanders is a Democrat, I contend he is one in name only. According to his own words, he's a Democratic Socialist.
@teka21bat Nothing wrong with that. I don't harbor any ill will for who you vote for in the primary
@EriSapmi Yep. I got an autograph from a famous person once but that doesn't mean I know that person. And besides what does knowing a member of the trump family have to do with anything. It's obvious Weeks can't stand trump
@umedyn bernie has caucused with the Dems for years but because of the new rules to debate in the primary he must register as a Dem. So, the Senate Dems have listed him a part of the leadership. But, as the primary ends and he loses, he'll take his ball and go back to Independent
@teka21bat I vote for Democrats.
@edz1 No shit, Rover. bernie will go back to independent status once he gets to debat on stage with REAL Democrats. That's all I'm saying. Read what I'm tweeting and not what you think I'm tweeting.
@EriSapmi Weeks posted a pic with Barron and now you think he's chilling with trump at Mar a Lago on the weekends. Child please.
@umedyn OH FFS. If the Senate Dems don't do that YOU and the rest of the bernie bots would scream about how the DNC is being unfair to bernie. Remember, I saw you guys in action in 2016. You guys screamed "rigged system" more than trump did

@Tellall2012 @JeffFlake That makes zero sense. You're saying Flake, regardless of FBI findings, is still going to vote for confirmation but hopes it might persuade others not to confirm. That's illogical
@Tellall2012 @JeffFlake Tsk tsk. I'm sure you are not new to politics. Especially the agenda of republicans. Jeff Flake is retiring and will NOT jeopardize monetizing his private sector career by voting against Kavanaugh and losing access to his colleagues in Congress
