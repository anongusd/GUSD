Sab√≠eu que l'intercanvi comercial entre #Catalunya i els EUA supera els 5 mil milions de d√≤lars anuals? M√©s de 500 empreses catalanes operen als EUA, i unes 700 dels EUA ho fan a Catalunya. I tranquil¬∑la, @WhiteHouse Els nord-americans tenen super√†vit comercial amb Catalunya!
#didyouknow that $5+ billion of trade is done between #Catalonia and the US every year? Over 500 Catalan businesses operate in the US, some 700 US companies operate in Catalonia. And don‚Äôt worry @whitehouse, U.S. enjoys a trade surplus with Catalonia! @catamcouncil
Sab√≠eu que els Estats Units van obrir la seva primera missi√≥ diplom√†tica a #Catalunya per promoure el comer√ß bilateral al 1797? La relaci√≥ entre Catalunya i els Estats Units √©s gaireb√© tan antiga com la rep√∫blica nord-americana @USConsulateBCN https://t.co/h9kE1aFUru
#didyouknow that the United States opened its first diplomatic mission in #Catalonia in 1797 to promote trade? The Catalonia / US relationship is almost as old as the American Republic itself. @catamcouncil https://t.co/h9kE1aFUru

Al @catamcouncil creiem que s√≥n anatema a aquests valors l‚Äôexist√®ncia de presoners pol√≠tics, d‚Äôexiliats per for√ßa i de les retallades de la llibertat d‚Äôexpressi√≥ i de reuni√≥. Per aix√≤ ho condemnem en√®rgicament i treballarem per encoratjar el debat i proposar solucions.
The @catamcouncil believes that the existence of political prisoners, forced exile, curtailments of freedom of speech, and of assembly, are anathema to those values. We therefore strenuously condemn them, and will work to encourage debate and propose solutions.
El Catalonia America Council @catamcouncil creu que afrontar les q√ºestions que afecten aquests valors transatl√†ntics en aquests temps de desafiaments √©s una necessitat m√©s que no pas un luxe.
The Catalan America Council @catamcouncil believes that addressing issues that affect these transatlantic values in these challenging times is a necessity rather than a luxury.
El Catalonia America Council @catamcouncil es guia per valors compartits entre catalans i nord-americans: un suport inq√ºestionable a la llibertat, la democr√†cia i l‚Äôautogovern, i un esperit emprenedor com√∫ orientat a arromangar-se per tirar endavant.
The Catalonia America Council @catamcouncil is guided by the values that #Catalans and Americans share: an unwaivering support for freedom, democracy and self-government, and a common entrepreneurial, pull yourself up by your bootstraps spirit.

The CAC seeks to encourage private-sector collaboration between Catalonia and North America, specifically with regards to business and innovation.  In addition, it educates its community on relevant business, trade, and legislative issues of interest.
To this end, the CAC will work to encourage and promote transatlantic exchange, giving policymakers, think tanks, academic institutions and relevant non-profit organizations and journalists opportunities to connect, collaborate and discuss solutions.
The CAC believes that international exchange encourages better public policy, opens door to collaboration, and gives members of both communities‚Äô access to increased opportunities in a globalized world.
The CAC engages on the latest social, political, and economic developments in Catalonia and North America, encouraging debate and discussion around the most critical challenges facing both communities; from democracy to civil rights, from public policy to trade and investment.
El CAC busca encoratjar la col¬∑laboraci√≥ en el sector privat entre Catalunya i Am√®rica del Nord. El CAC aspira a educar la seva comunitat sobre negocis rellevants, comer√ß i aspectes legislatius d‚Äôinter√®s per a negocis catalans i nord-americans.
Sota aquesta premissa el CAC encoratja i promou l‚Äôintercanvi transatl√†ntic oferint oportunitats per establir connexions, col¬∑laboracions i solucions pragm√†tiques al m√≥n pol√≠tic, laboratoris de pensament, institucions acad√®miques i organitzacions sense √†nim de lucre rellevants.
El CAC creu que l‚Äôintercanvi internacional encoratja una millor gesti√≥ de l‚Äôadministraci√≥ p√∫blica, obre portes a la col¬∑laboraci√≥ i proporciona acc√©s a millors oportunitats als membres de les dues comunitats en un m√≥n globalitzat.
El CAC vol intervenir en el desenvolupament dels esdeveniments socials, pol√≠tics i econ√≤mics d‚Äôactualitat a Catalunya i a Am√®rica del Nord per encoratjar el debat i la discussi√≥ a trav√©s d‚Äôactes p√∫blics, obra publicada i difusi√≥.
Aquests valors compartits guien la feina del CAC per afrontar els desafiaments socials i pol√≠tics m√©s importants a ambdues comunitats, tot enfortint les relacions entre Catalunya i Am√®rica del Nord.
El CAC creu que la relaci√≥ transatl√†ntica ve marcada per valors compartits, per valors pol√≠tics arrelats en la llibertat, la democr√†cia i l‚Äôautogovern, i amb un esperit com√∫ d‚Äôemprenedoria orientat a l‚Äô√®xit econ√≤mic i a la innovaci√≥.
Benvingudes/Benvinguts al Catalonia America Council (CAC), organitzaci√≥ sense √†nim de lucre independent i no partidista que aborda els reptes socials i pol√≠tics m√©s importants q afronten Catalunya i els pa√Øsos de l‚ÄôAm√®rica del Nord mentre enforteix les seves relacions bilaterals.
These shared values guide the CAC‚Äôs work as it seeks to address both communities‚Äô most important political and social challenges, while working to strengthen relations between them.
The CAC believes that the transatlantic relationship is marked by shared values, by political values rooted in freedom, democracy and self-government, and a common entrepreneurial spirit which drives economic success and innovation.
