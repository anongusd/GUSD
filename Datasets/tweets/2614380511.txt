@sahilkapur I am an atheist who rejects the identity "atheist", just as I am a woman who rejects the identity "not a man". Keep your labels. The term is hardly neutral.
@LuxAlptraum Wait, you asked why there wasn't more public outrage. Was this intended to be a serious discussion about rape culture or not?
@LuxAlptraum There are bigger targets who produced pro-rape propaganda who are still too sanctified to speak truthfully about, but need to be unpacked and examined. Personally, I am more outraged by Bowie apologists saying "13yo groupies is not rape" when there was an entire culture around it
@LuxAlptraum NOT saying it wasn't sexual assault, or untrue, or traumatizing ‚Äì but there's maybe less PUBLIC outrage because it's not perceived as an on-going threat to public safety or a conspiracy of workplace cover-ups. The "scope" doesn't extend to a culture of protecting a serial abuser.
@LuxAlptraum Some obvious differences: 	IT WAS NOT WORK RELATED. Takei was never his accuser's boss or coworker. Takei never threatened or retaliated against the guy's career. By his own story they had dated several times, and lastly no (apparent) pattern of victims.

Now the LESS HELPFUL tags. Everyone from the #Bronx tags themselves. üò£ Y'all in the next borough over looking up in the sky. You know it's Queens, but you gotta represent. SMH.
Also helpful is #LaGuardia and #LGA which is a major transportation hub that can delay flights all over the East Coast. It's holiday season. Y'all are good people.
For a 9/11 scale event, the tag #Queens tells other New Yorkers which borough is going to be closed. It is also orientation of which direction you should head: east to Long Island or West into New Jersey, or south to Brooklyn.
But more important is the TAGS New Yorkers used to inform others WHERE the disaster event is taking place. This is INFORMATION that might save your life in a life threatening event.		For me, that information was #Astoria. It could be located by the reflection on the clouds.
#4 Cloverfield, Godzilla, other monster movies = you are a practical person who is preparing for the hell which is to come. You are a pro. Y'all already at the bodega stocking up on survival batteries and beer.

@theAWParty And do we REALLY have rights, when we HAVE the votes and still can't get the woman elected‚Ä¶? Current events shed light on the reality of the past. I see people blame white women now, but seriously WHERE THE WHITE MEN AT? Attacking dead women is easy. I know who the villains are.
@theAWParty 6/ Lastly, there were no male white supremacists in 1840 who were saying "üë±üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è can vote but noüë∏üèø" so that puts any "conspiracy" in question. It's ugly history of debate, but analogous to every civil rights movement. In the 1960s Women's Lib voted to include LGB_. #Progress
@theAWParty 5/ Also, I think it's worth doing the math. Why didn't letting Black Men vote gain the rest of us voting rights? Again, a good intersectional lesson‚Ä¶, but we know how vote suppression works. Bad States remained bad, and "Reconstruction" is it's own political era in the US.
@theAWParty 4/ and it's a selective narrative. Why not emphasize the feminists who weren't racist? They were there, and just as effective. There were even Euro-white Feminists who demanded race equality too. The vote was STILL 170yrs later, and not because of early Feminists.
@theAWParty 3/ That first women's convention (1840s) is cited as though the movement should have been fully formed with a 1960s civil rights era manifesto. That's not how history works, and even then they knew they would need various strategies. There was no template. Voting was 170yrs away.
@theAWParty 2/ The corollaries are: Black Men who sold out women so they could get the vote, and White Men who were the blockers ‚Äì funny we don't hear about them ever, but the supposed female White Supremacists did it all. Sorry, that is just silly, they had no vote.
@theAWParty 1/1 While it's a nice lesson in intersectionality (because it didn't work), I've been seeing this "narrative" get abused as if it is coherent or contiguous. Random dates and individual statements scattered over 75yrs  (some pre-Civil War) doesn't make a conspiracy.
