@SethAbramson @NanaTamara21 Our Pres. is an IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
@SethAbramson @NanaTamara21 Pisses me off that he is using Twitter to declare what our country is doing regarding National Security. Impeach now. He's making us less safe. I remember the Cold War. I don't want the Russians to have nuclear weapons again, don't want an arms race between us, Putin and NK.
@TomthunkitsMind Just like idiot Orange doesn't listen to the CIA, apparently he doesn't watch Game of Thrones. But then again, he is an idiot, doesn't read, refuses to learn. How many of us have had grandparents or elderly parents that you could explain what the facts are and they won't listen.

Clinton was impeach for lying about a sexual affair. Okay he lied under oath. What is troubling is we have a  Pres. that lies about everything, so much that we are numb to it. What he has done is associate with people that have been indicted for campaign finance fraud.
Now he is holding our country hostage for a bogus wall because he knows his days of committing crimes are limited. We need to hold Mitch McConnell's feet to the fire, he is complicit in hurting American citizens. Clinton didn't hurt federal workers.  I hate Republicans!!!
