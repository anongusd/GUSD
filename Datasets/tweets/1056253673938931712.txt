@sailor_gerry49 @Lost9kin3weeks @matthewherper You‚Äôre hilarious. As a physician you would know that a physician recruiter makes between 20-30% of the candidates first year salary. You would know that if you really were a physician.

@sailor_gerry49 @Lost9kin3weeks @matthewherper A little different than impersonating a physician. Gerry Kraft MD is nowhere to be found anywhere. No serious physician would be on here under a false name with MD at the end of it. I recruit physicians for a living. $amrn

@NBCPolitics Too bad #FakeNewsCNN
@thehill Of course they say that.
@cris00709 @JasonSchwartz @Acosta @AprilDRyan @PeterAlexander @Yamiche Okay Snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è https://t.co/7VeNhbVDlq
@adamfeuerstein @MatthewTNatale Adam. Please just report your biotech news. Your biased liberal opinions are dumb. I‚Äôm sure you voted for Fauxcahantas.
@kimzr1 @PrisonPlanet @Acosta What the hell were you looking at? He was an ass.
@adamfeuerstein @MatthewTNatale https://t.co/Xb1xj3njJx
@robbystarbuck @TuckerCarlson Scumbags
@dcexaminer I hope he does. He‚Äôs a great Senator.
@jeffmason1 @edhenry @PressSec @Acosta Great news. About damn time
@EmeraldRobinson @cantaya6 Excellent.
@cris00709 @JasonSchwartz @Acosta @AprilDRyan @PeterAlexander @Yamiche No blue wave, honey. Republicans won the the states that matter most and the Red Wave hit the Senate. That‚Äôs the most important. If you actually knew anything you would understand that. Go away snowflake.
@cris00709 @JasonSchwartz @Acosta @AprilDRyan @PeterAlexander @Yamiche Look in the mirror, Snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è and open your eyes.
@Acosta Yes, YOU ARE.
@PhilipRucker @Acosta @PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan https://t.co/QQaENun1oY
@cris00709 @JasonSchwartz @Acosta @AprilDRyan @PeterAlexander @Yamiche You can‚Äôt see through anything when you‚Äôre blinded by the real truth.
@JasonSchwartz @Acosta @AprilDRyan @PeterAlexander @Yamiche Awe. Poor babies. You were all schooled in a very professional manner by @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/3xOWUWuPQj
Trump gets in heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta - POLITICO https://t.co/peYcJcpQOK
@JackPosobiec I personally thought @realDonaldTrump should have had @Acosta removed. Jim is a disgrace. TDS has the best of him.
@DailyMail Another Dumbocrat who fails to accept the election results
@JamesOKeefeIII What does @CNN @ABCPolitics @NBCPolitics @MSNBC and all other #FakeNews think?
@LauraLoomer My wife
@RepSwalwell Grow up.
@ABCPolitics True statement
@CNN Because of you idiots.
@MSNBC Doubt that. #FakeNews
@CNN Not your constant lies. We The People know you‚Äôre fake.
@MichaelAvenatti https://t.co/BeVj7BDwgc
@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump Spoken by the Retired ‚ÄúNobody‚Äù wanna-be. Your caption fits you very well. Nobody!!!!!
@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump And all three will lose
@realDonaldTrump How will the #FakeNews spin this?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Get lost Assenstein.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Show the proof on your BS
@Comey Who cares what you think.  You‚Äôre disgraceful.
@amarin_fraud @neilbuschi @RickCam56356144 @American_Heart @DLBHATTMD You are obviously a former investor who sold at a loss after the AdCom. Bye, troll.
@AGranzarolo Look in the mirror to see someone stupid.
@TheRealRCampbel @amarin_fraud @American_Heart @DLBHATTMD Stick to Bitcoin, knucklehead.
@cardiobrief @DLenzn1 On November 12th, Amarin will skyrocket
@CNNTonight Says the real racist. https://t.co/1kFNPvieyq
@donlemon This guy is. https://t.co/wwYZNRJGb6
@charliekirk11 EXACTLY
@fedira @shefalil Never a good sign when people make uninformed dumb comments. Amarin will soar on November 12.
@shefalil Your article is completely idiotic. Every OTC fish oil failed. For you to say that Vascepa never went up against OTC fish oils makes you sound completely uninformed. Amarin stock will soar on November 12. Do your research on Vascepa before you write another stupid article.
Fox News tops CNN and MSNBC combined in October cable news ratings https://t.co/fKcJavtQv0 Where is @donlemon? In the gutter.
@JoeConchaTV @SebGorka Shep is smack in the middle of where he should work. Fox needs to fire him.
@John_S_Osborn @AHAMeetings @AstraZenecaUS Vascepa will be the big news at the @AHAMeetings $AMRN
@TomFitton Class Act
@MatthewTNatale Their loss. üòÄ
@MZHemingway Same reason why the Roy Moore charade stopped the moment the election was over. It‚Äôs all BS
@howard_gewirtz @SheilaBurk3 @Mediaite Blinded by the 8 ball.
@FoxNews @BarbraStreisand Adios, aye.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Whatever CPL
@MichaelAvenatti Oh please. Where is the proof. Always trying to stay in the spotlight until it crashes in your face
@JohnJamesMI @realDonaldTrump I hope you win, John. And BTW, Thanks for Golden Tate. Fly ü¶Ö Fly
@AndrewPollackFL @AndrewGillum @RonDeSantisFL Animals
@TheKnightNurse @AHAMeetings Amarin is a star.
@MoradiShayan Go AMARIN.
@TheExiledOne @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl Jury duty. The FBI Director would never have jury duty. You‚Äôre delusional.
@MichaelAvenatti Michael, pay the millions you were ordered to pay. Creepy Porn Lawyer.
@MSNBC Your news organization is completely ridiculous. Get lost.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Really, Joe. Look at the official definition and stop creating your own personal definition
@ABCPolitics Not accuarate.
@FalloutShelterB Go away. You‚Äôre completely irrelevant and deranged. I wasn‚Äôt replying to what you said anyway. Obviously, you‚Äôre not one of the geniuses.
@MSNBC @morningmika Morning Schmo and his crazy side show.
@farhip Mainly WaPo reporters like yourself
@MaxBoot @FalloutShelterB Most watched news network by far. Jealous, Boot?
@KamalaHarris Then start speaking out about people within and whom support your party. This includes yourself as well.
@nytimes Then I‚Äôll get my news elsewhere.
@TerraPharma1 I cannot wait.
@charliekirk11 Because the fakes news won‚Äôt report true stories to make @realDonaldTrump look good.
@TheRevAl You should be proud of this. Pay your taxes.
@ChrisCuomo And you expose yourself every night.
@JRubinBlogger @brianstelter @NPRinskeep How about ‚Äúpull you‚Äù and your bias.
@NBCNews I guess we‚Äôll call NBC far-left then
@ObamaMalik @jairbolsonaro Please tell us the truth about your brother‚Äôs false birth certificate.
@charliekirk11 Hypocrisy at its best.
@CNN Actually 4 hate-filled crimes. One of them happen every minute of the day with #fakenews #CNN reporting BS
@matthewherper stick to biotech and stop poking your nose into politics. You are biased about the Caravan
@juliaioffe https://t.co/3NujPsRrB1
@MSNBC MSNBC is a joke.
