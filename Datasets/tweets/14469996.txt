@xristosdomini @POTUS @ShannonJoyRadio There's also no law against Trump using the emergency powers for National Security when they've federally handcuffed States from dealing with the immigration issue directly. Which IMO States should have every right to handle.
@xristosdomini @POTUS @ShannonJoyRadio There's no law against the Republicans using a simple majority vote just as the Democrats have. I'd prefer that over the state of the emergency route... however, now we're back to the GOP leadership not exercising their constitutional powers as previously mentioned.
@xristosdomini @POTUS @ShannonJoyRadio It's not an either or... it's an "and." They should stop getting petrified AND start standing up for the Constitution... period, in all it's rights. govt limits, guarantees, protections, etc. and tell the American People repeatedly why this is the right way to go.
@xristosdomini @POTUS @ShannonJoyRadio As you rightly pointed out, Republicans should tell the public the Democrats do X too and that it's also legal to do. It's time the Republicans stop getting petrified and thus do nothing or cave-in because they're afraid of what the Democrats will say.
@xristosdomini @POTUS @ShannonJoyRadio It's interesting how you think. As if by the Republicans choosing not to do something, this will somehow deter the Democrats from not doing it? Who was the first to use the nuclear option? Harry Reid? Yes. Even though the previous Republican Congress chose not to use it.
Someone made an excellent point... the Democrats are pushing for massive immigration (Esp in Texas &amp; California) so they can take over the US House (via gerrymandering representation) as a super majority and never lose it again. @ShannonJoyRadio

@miriam__s9 @Jamiebabiez @OrangeJeebus @westcoastlawyer @LifeNewsHQ Show me a ruling that says a man gives up his rights to his DNA once inserted into a woman? That tends to lead to another legal debate on if men should pay child support for children they consensually didn‚Äôt want, yet the woman‚Äôs choice was to keep the child.
@Jamiebabiez @OrangeJeebus @westcoastlawyer @LifeNewsHQ Agreed. So just as both consented to sex without the intent of creating a child, they can also both be required to consent to having the abortion or discuss better options like adoption.
@miriam__s9 @Jamiebabiez @OrangeJeebus @westcoastlawyer @LifeNewsHQ Then give the man back his sperma or pay him for the destruction of personal property, that is, his DNA intellectual property which the woman allowed her body to accept under false pretenses.
@Jamiebabiez @OrangeJeebus @westcoastlawyer @LifeNewsHQ It‚Äôs statically proven that the overwhelming majority of abortions are NOT from being rapped or incest. Nice try though. To your point, since men cannot bare children without women, that‚Äôs even a greater argument against women having abortions without the male donor's consent.
