@tyleradams80 @CollectivzdPaki @RoKhanna You have no idea what you're claiming, even according to our CIA fact book Chaves cut poverty almost in half between 1999 &amp; his death, increased education, energy availability, health care, and nutrition, and unlike president trump, Chavez &amp; Moduro were elected by a majority.

@cerno1987 @JM97245471 @NRA But everyone has admitted that a bump stocks, and other similar devices can make a semi-automatic weapon respond like an automatic. So, how did bump stocks get past the restrictions for automatic weapons?

@jweese151 @JM97245471 @NRA Yep, even a penny, and a piece of tape within the vicinity of certain weapons can bring a charge of possession of an automatic weapon.
@JM97245471 @NRA They should oppose all weapons of war in the hands of civilians. A semi-automatic rifle that can kill at 600+ yards is not for self defense.		50+ people were murdered by a guy that was so far away that they didn't know which way to run because none of them could see their killer.

@joegunz504 @xxJTXxx @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump The press accurately reported that a police report had been filed, if the reporting to the police turns out to be false, the report from the press that a report was filed is still true...that's an important distinction unless you're extremely dense.
@GPlutus @xxJTXxx @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Please wake up, lying is presidential now, so it shouldn't even make the news that a citizen lied to the police, because our president lies daily to the American people he works for, but keep up the fake outrage it's sadly hysterical.
@GPlutus @xxJTXxx @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Haha, only an idiot thinks that the press reporting on a filed police report is the press misleading the public. Wtf is wrong with people?

@superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing Haha, the VA has the highest approval rating from clients of any healthcare system in America. 	Veterans hate the biased ignorant propaganda from the right that's trying to privatize the VA for profit.	Since videos are facts to you, Sicko is free on YouTube so no excuses for you.
@superschlem @austinelder516 @PaulScarlata @sally_alcot @StephenKing And, btw fwiw the VA healthcare system isn't that great for female veterans.
@superschlem @austinelder516 @PaulScarlata @sally_alcot @StephenKing As a veteran, I do want everyone in America to get healthcare. I know people who couldn't serve in uniform that have done more in serving this country and Americans than I've ever done. If only veterans deserve healthcare, everyone should serve...bring back compulsory service.
@sally_alcot @superschlem @austinelder516 @StephenKing Yep, just like alcohol. Only companies that have paid their fees, and comply with the regulations they lobbied for can make alcohol, never mind selling it as a product.		I'm for universal health care because businesses shouldn't be burdened with hc costs.
@superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing Alcohol is most certainly medicine, it's required in first aid kits, and it was long used as the ether to put patients under for surgery. Plus alcohol is easy to make &amp; can be made from food scraps, it's even fuel for life sustaining heat, but capitalism is why you can't make it.
@superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing OH, you don't understand the quote you posted?	You're crying that free markets are freedom, even though you don't realize you're not operating in a free market?	It's like trying to play checkers while you're actually playing chess.
@superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing You can't even make moonshine in your home and sell it anywhere in America, in a free market you could, but you're so enslaved you feel the freedom to die from a lack of medical care or medication is valuable, and alcohol is literally medicine.
@PaulScarlata @superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing The joke is that they cry for free market healthcare, but we don't even purchase our food in a free market. We regulate, and even require fees to sell vegetables on every street in America, we don't have a free market, we have a planned market.
@superschlem @sally_alcot @austinelder516 @StephenKing Haha, you value freedom, that's what the bone spur says too.

@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL No you're actually paraphrasing a section of what's written in the constitution by the framers regarding treason in a sad attempt to defend your false belief that traitors deserve the right to commit treason under our constitution.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL So you finally read about treason as it's outlined in the constitution, and believe that the requirement of two witnesses proves your argument that traitors deserve equal rights? Wow! 	Stop arguing about things you're obviously just starting to learn about.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Go back and read what you disagreed with genius, because the acts of treason we were discussing was done in public, there were many more than 2 witnesses, because they broadcast their treason to incite civil unrest.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Bells must me ringing in your empty head because you don't even realize how stupid it is to claim that acts of treason are an "unalienable right". No American has the right to give aid and comfort to an enemy &amp; we've imprisoned people for broadcasting enemy propaganda. Wtfiwwy?
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Lordy, I'm done because you don't read, you just regurgitate, you're wrong, because as I pointed out previously the only crime the constitution outlines IS treason, which means there is zero protection for treasonous acts, why is that so hard for you to understand? Wtf?
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL You literally argued that traitors deserve equal rights under the constitution, now you're claiming that you never argued that...Wow!What's wrong with you?		You're just wrong on this, traitors simply don't deserve equal rights, and that's implied by the use of the label "traitor"
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Um, my post was about traitors broadcasting enemy propaganda in the streets with their enemy flags, and you disagreed with my statement that traitors don't deserve equal rights of free speech, you literally argued that SCOTUS ruled they deserve the right to spew enemy propaganda.
@Pteratorn @jimsciutto @c_e_jensen In the 80's we used the word "comrade" as a snide insult in the US Army, but in 2003 the Army created a "soldiers creed" that soldiers have to memorize and it labels fellow  soldiers as "comrade".

@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL That's correct, but you're claiming that the government's failure to always enforce a law against broadcasting enemy propaganda amounts to a traitor deserving of a right to broadcast enemy propaganda, but it doesn't. Broadcasting enemy propaganda is not protected speech.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Again, traitors don't deserve equal rights.	Traitors don't have a right to broadcast enemy propaganda, because our constitution calls it a crime to give aid and comfort to an enemy, so clearly traitors to America don't have any legal right to broadcast their enemy propaganda.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Doesn't mean he hasn't committed crimes &amp; it doesn't mean that he deserves the rights of law abiding citizens to continue committing crimes until he's charged, or that the lack of his legal accountability has granted him a constitutional right to commit crimes.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Traitors don't deserve the right to broadcast enemy propaganda, and our courts have held that to be true, so stop claiming that our constitution that criminalizes treason actually grants a right for Americans to act treasonous against America if it's what they believe.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Right, by the courts, but treason hasn't been ruled a right just because it's not enforced equally, so just because it can happen doesn't mean it gives traitors the right to publicly swear allegiance to an enemy nation today, which is what you're claiming.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL No, just because you're not convicted of stealing doesn't mean you didn't steal, and the constitution doesn't give someone a right as you claim to commit treason until we convict them of treason, that's just dumb.	Seriously you're just ridiculous.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Stop adding your feelings to this, it's not about whether you agree or disagree with their beliefs, it's about giving aid, and comfort to an enemy...which is treason. Swearing allegiance to an enemy nation is treason.		Don't open your mind up so much your brain falls out.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL If you studied the constitution in college you would know that our gov failure to enforce a law does not set a precedent that makes it a right.	We can disagree on whether the public swearing of allegiance to the ideals of a defeated enemy is treason, but treason isn't a right.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Lordy, one more time...there is no protection afforded in the constitution for treasonous acts against our country, just because we don't convict every traitor or every thief doesn't mean that treason, or stealing is a protected right.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Lordy, waving the flag of an enemy state is not a belief, it's an action, it's an active effort to broadcast enemy propaganda &amp; to incite civil unrest. You don't have a right to be a traitor, or broadcast enemy propaganda even if you believe the enemy is right.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Read more, regurgitate less, we have convicted people for treason because of just words they said, words that were giving aid, and comfort to an enemy. Google is your friend, just google it instead of just claiming you're an expert on something you obviously don't understand.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Your ego gets in the way of your ability to reason.	Treason is a crime, don't confuse the the unequal enforcement of our laws as a constitutional right for traitors to broadcast enemy propaganda.	It's not me saying they don't deserve rights, it's the constitution that says it.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL It's not just a conviction that restricts the rights of an accused criminal, a simple arrest restricts the right to in public speech. Stop trying to spin your ridiculous claim that traitors deserve equal rights, because the constitution you refuse to read says otherwise.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL No kidding, that was my point, the constitution has no protections for treason, when you commit a crime you loose the rights afforded law abiding citizens. I wrote that "traitors don't deserve equal rights", because criminals don't deserve equal rights, but you claim they do.

@DearAuntCrabby That's why democrats need to stop defending accusations against them, and just go on the attack. It's pointless to prove a republican accusation wrong because they won't believe the truth anyway, so accuse them, make them defend themselves.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Stop regurgitating &amp; think for yourself. I didn't claim that fascists that I disagree with shouldn't have rights in America, I said that traitors shouldn't have rights because it's a constitutionally specific crime to be a traitor. 	This isn't about your affection for traitors...
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL If traitors have a constitutional right to spew enemy propaganda please explain under what authority we've tried and imprisoned people for treason because of their anti-American words?	This isn't that hard, the constitution doesn't protect the constitutional crime of treason.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL So you admit that SCOTUS has been wrong and failed to defend the constitution in past rulings, but you claim there's a past ruling where SCOTUS gives rights to Nazis which is final...lol.	We've convicted US citizens for spreading enemy propaganda...treason isn't protected speech.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Constitutionally American citizens owe allegiance to the US, and their state of residence. Adhering to, or giving aid and comfort to an enemy is defined as treason in the constitution, treason is the only crime created by the constitution and active disloyalty is treason.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL You have no idea what you're talking about, you just like to regurgitate stupid talking points, that's why you refuse to admit that you're wrong when you ignorantly claim that everyone has the same rights regardless of their actions.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Don't give advice you obviously haven't followed yourself, read the constitution you arrogant jerk, and don't add your stupid feelings to it, if the constitution doesn't specifically grant a right, it's not guaranteed, so tell me where is the right to be a traitor granted?
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Allowing Nazis to march in our streets incites every veteran I know to want violent unrest. My wounded WWII grandfather would have thought it was his sacred duty to attack any Nazi on American soil	And morally, no one, not even Nazis deserve the rights they would deny others.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL And don't confuse the rights granted in the constitution with unsettled case law, or unequal enforcement of our laws or protections. SCOTUS if you recall ruled that Japanese Americans on the west coast had none of the rights you say SCOTUS ruled traitors are entitled to.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Really because the fighting words doctrine found that calling an LEO a fascist was inciting unrest, and a jail worthy offense. So calling someone a Nazi isn't protected, but public demonstrations of comfort and support for an enemy is protected...right.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL I understand how our rights work, but you obviously don't.	There is NO right granted in the constitution that entitles someone to be a traitor or march in our streets with the flag of an enemy. This isn't about your ignorant lies and fake feelings...
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL 1A doesn't protect yelling fire in a theater, bomb at an airport or fighting words (fighting words doctrine). Nazis are not a protected class &amp; waving a Nazi flag is unprotected speech because it's specifically intended to incite civil unrest.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Not how what works, you're not making any sense. You're just spewing BS by claiming that everyone deserves the same rights in no matter what they do, but that's not true. No one has a legal right to be a traitor, and pledging allegiance to an enemy flag is what traitors do.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Next you'll be claiming Nazis have the equal right to fly the Nazi flag on capital buildings, because the American flag is there.	Non Americans, criminals, and traitors to America don't deserve the rights afforded law abiding American citizens, rights come with responsibilities.
@night_harbinger @kelkeith @JGreenblattADL Then why do we take rights from criminals? Because  their actions made them undeserving of the rights of American citizens, and being a traitor makes you undeserving of the rights fought for by patriotic Americans. You wear the Nazi flag, you deserve no protections in America.

Homeless people froze to death in NY, but we should rescue Venezuela from corruption? haha.	It won't be a rescue.
@elopezgross @edisonpower @MeridithKohut America is being ruled by an undemocratically elected agent for a foreign government, our government is raising taxes and prices for necessities to hurt the poor, poisoning our children, and then sending them to die in war for people that don't care about Americans dying.
@spicymilkbags @BenjaminNorton @SecPompeo Well if socialism is the problem, I wouldn't ask the republican controlled US government for help because republican controlled regions of the US are the poorest, and biggest beneficiaries of American socialism. If you want successful "capitalism" ask a California or NY Gov.

Smh
@CoolNice16 @gardencatlady @BenjaminNorton @DFBbear @SecPompeo Well then why would Venezuelans want the US to intervene?

Smh.

@JustLuthien @JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth I'm pro worker so I'm opposed to undocumented workers in the US, but I don't blame the workers, I blame the crooked employers that exploit them and undermine wages.	So they need citizenship because I want them paying an honest share, not being exploited for corporate profit.
@JustLuthien @JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth And, even if we could deport every undocumented person in the US, it wouldn't save us a dime for a wall, because we would lose their gift of cheap labor, and the taxes they pay which amounts to them paying far more into our economy than they burden us with.
@JustLuthien @JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth No kidding, we don't ask about someone's citizenship before we provide lifesaving treatment to human beings, and the c in wic is for children, American children qualify for wic even if their parent is undocumented, that's not the same as an undocumented person getting wic.
@JustLuthien @JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Lordy, trumplicans are so bad at math that they would actually claim that not publishing brochures could pay for a wall along the southern border...lol. That's why trumplicans can't be trusted with money, they have no idea what anything costs because they don't pay for anything.
@JustLuthien @JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Uh, illegal non-citizens aren't eligible for any benefits, &amp; legal non-citizen residents receive far less in gov benefits than US citizens, so cutting benefits for people not born here wouldn't pay for a mile of traitor trump's stupid wall, but trump's liars spew that dumb lie.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth So you're saying that welfare state governments run by trumplicans are persistently poor because they can't stop themselves from taking welfare &amp; that has trapped their state in poverty, so that makes them entitled to spend more money because they're just victims of welfare...lol
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth &amp; only a fool would trust a trumplican with even more money, their poorly governed states already get a lot more in fed welfare than blue states, yet they stay persistently poor, proving that they're poor stewards of taxpayer money, we might as well burn $ than trust them with it
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Well, Californians shouldn't have to pay for something they don't want just to appease a bunch of lying takers that live in poorly governed red welfare states. 	The parasites need to learn that if the payers aren't entitled to what they want, the takers aren't entitled either.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth I'm just tired of having my tax dollars given to red state voters that hate me &amp; lie about me while they pay less taxes, have more voting power yet still claim they're the victims in America. And the insanity of giving more voting power to the failing taker states is just crazy.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Well I am for a complete blue exit, but I worry we'd need a wall üòâ then because there would be no incentive for red states to enact successful policies, so it would only increase the number of economic refugees that blue states already take from the failing red states.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Besides, those poor trump voters obviously need to be given something to really cry about, like no more blue taxpayer money, because while they take &amp; take they have never learned not to spew hateful lies about the far away blue neighbor that is surreptitiously helping them.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Hysterical, but nope, yet your response shows how little you know you know about red state vs blue state taxes. Red states already over tax their poor, so they might have to raise revenue by doing something crazy like the payer states do and tax the wealthiest more.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth I think it's a problem that the biggest takers only cry that our debt is a problem when the payers want to spend. Blue state taxpayers are already forced to subsidize trump's red state voters poor lifestyle choices, so those red states aren't entitled to cry about debt/spending.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth How can trump's red state voters even be believed about what they want, what will help them, or what they need when their cries change with the party of the president? trumplicans have already increased the debt by more than $1T &amp; yet they still claim they're entitled to more,smh
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth I think we have a Red state parasite problem which has created enormous debt &amp; that's a bigger problem than just debt because it's the takers that feel entitled to demand the most while they pay the least. If trumplicans want a wall they should increase their taxes to pay for it.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Btw, only a trumplican would support shutting down the government because they didn't get authorization to spend more money, no conservative would EVER support that. 	Trumplicans shouldn't get a wall, because tomorrow they'll have something else to cry about anyway.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth Fwiw, trump's red state voters are persistently the poorest and biggest recipients of fed welfare, they literally can't afford a wall, yet they're the ones crying that they're entitled to spend other people's money on a wall.	If a wall is necessary why isn't Los Alamos walled in?
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth No, unlike hypocrite trumplicans I don't agree with wasting money on something stupid like a wall no matter who wants it, but in this case it's the same trumplicans that have now blown up the debt after complaining about it for years that are now claiming more debt is no big deal
@nikkitruckee @KimsMom3 Then Joe Manchin needs the boot, he carries the label, but speaks against the liberal policies that work to fund his persistently poor taker state, at least Bernie quacks like a Dem, Manchin and others really don't. Dump the DINOs.
@KimsMom3 @Nicoxw1 Well the Dems need to dump Manchin then because he has the label but none of the liberal cred Bernie does	I believe Bernie would switch if the Dems didn't always intentionally loose. The Dems even make wins a loss, they won the GOP healthcare plan for us just to have it destroyed
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth So part of the problem is that trumplicans have cried wolf too many times. They cried about the debt, now they cry about a wall, tomorrow they'll be told to cry about something else and they'll cry about that, because they actually stand for nothing, so they'll cry about anything
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth It's  not the money, it's the hypocrisy. Trumplicans always cry that the debt is their biggest concern and we can't afford anything until it's a trumplican that's blowing up the debt then they claim agreeing to billions to build and maintain a stupid wall is no big deal.
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth If the money is no big deal and the wall is so important why don't trumplicans take the money from the $12B in extra farm welfare given to trump's farmers that were hurt by his failing tariff policies?
@JamesRusselforc @SenDuckworth How do trumplicans plan to pay for a wall, oh that's right they don't plan to pay for it because their taker state voters don't even pay their own bills now, even though under O they claimed the greatest threat to our security was our debt, now they'll blow up the debt for a wall

If you thought about policy more than person/party you wouldn't have regurgitated the GOP lie about the walls of a house convincing you we need a wall on 1 border.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray So to you the Dems have to meet with trump or they aren't doing their job? You're so objective. 	The GOP controlled senate refused to even debate or vote on a funding bill they had already negotiated and agreed to just because trump was for the bill before he was against it.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray I'm with you on reopening the government, but trump and the GOP can't be trusted on anything. This all wouldn't even be happening if trumplicans hadn't believed trump's stupid lie that Mexico was going to pay for his stupid wall.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray Whoa, you don't understand that leaving out material facts to favor your biased opinion while claiming that someone else isn't being fair or objective is tantamount to lying? Are you claiming that you're genuinely that obtuse? I thought it was intentional.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray No, hypocrisy &amp; lies are causing the huge division. 	Blue voters believe that we're all in this together, while the red voters claim they've built it all themselves, which is an insulting lie since the facts is that blue voters are forced to fund the red voters that hate them.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray He fooled them twice already when they met to negotiate and trump used the meetings as his staged performance for the media. He was never serious about negotiating, only an idiot would believe him now.		AGAIN, calling someone that lies, a liar isn't name calling, it just a fact.

@therealdavesims @PattyMurray Btw, traitor trump's red welfare state voters can't afford a wall, they already take welfare from the blue state taxpayers they hate.

Where do trumplicans get these type of stupid regurgitations?
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray Don't lie that you don't support trump, when you lie about others to defend him, you're a trump supporter.		We can't build a wall around our country so the dumbest regurgitation trump's liars spew is to compare a house to our country. Stop regurgitating stupid lies.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray No, you're denying the truth by spewing more lies. First you complained that they wouldn't come to the table, but they did and you're lying that they refused to negotiate when it's trump that ran out of the negotiations.	Stop lying to defend trump, that's not objective.
@therealdavesims @PattyMurray Whoa, why are you lying that I called names? Recognizing lies &amp; describing those that tell lies as Liars is NOT name calling, it's an accurate character description. If you have a genuine inability to understand that simple truth, you seem very unlikely to understand objectivity.

@I_Li_Li_I @thehill Umm, you wrote this: "it sure seems like this should probably be of concern" and you posted it with a video about a lot of immigrants passing under the fence.		So *big sigh*, if that was actually your point, then I'll ask again, why should that video concern anyone?
@thehill How can the Bohemian Grove Security keep people off their 2,700 acres of mostly forest land without a wall if we're to believe our own gov can't do the same on a dessert border?	We don't need a wall to secure our border, that's just a stupid lie that only trump's idiots believe.

@LoriRRR @1776Stonewall At least Ca is being proactive to avoid a costly disaster, unlike trumplican red states that get plenty of FEMA money then they rebuild the same type of buildings in the same places they were destroyed, so that they can be hypocrites as they perpetually receive FEMA money.

@LoriRRR @1776Stonewall It's a lie that Ca is trying to seize beach property because of climate control, some beach homes literally fall onto the beach, some jurisdictions have moved to seize unsafe property being affected by rising high tides, and...
@LoriRRR @1776Stonewall You either don't understand democracy, or you hate it. Unlike the gerrymandered red states where trumplicans cheat to win control of the gov they hate, Ca is run by the people, and Ca has protected it's coast long before that rich liar closed a access to a public beach.

@ewalklsu @PamBLacerda @MeghanMcCain @DNC She condemned King, not the trumplican party that has been sponsoring him for years.

@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC You're right I'm not a Twitter aficionado, but unlike you I'm also not stupid enough to think that time stamps prove that I ignored your post. You are an unbelievable self righteous jerk, learn how to not be a stupid jerk on Twitter before you ignorantly give more advice.

No, racist &amp; those that support racist in their party aren't entitled to call out racism until they clean their own house, it's hypocritical.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC For the love of god pull your self righteous head out of your hypocrite arse. I didn't ignore what you wrote you deplorable hypocrite, I only responded to a singular post of yours at a time while you were responding multiple times, stop giving advice you don't take yourself.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC Okay.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC I don't understand why you're more upset about the leadership of a private organization than the leadership in the trumplican party, they hold office, create policy &amp; receive taxpayer money. King is a trumplican approved taxpayer funded racist policy maker, but the march right?
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC The RNC sponsors child molesters for public office, but it's only the DNC you want to fix? Stop pretending that the lying birther trumplican party has a moral leg to stand on when it comes to morals of any kind...the trumplican party chose trump because he's deplorable.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC BS, MM has repeatedly condemned Anna Navarro for condemning the trumplican party for tolerating the Steve Kings, MM only condemns individuals.	That's why she's deplorable, she does nothing to fix the filth in her own party, but she never shuts up about what others need to fix.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC There's no excuse for a party to harbor racists in taxpayer funded positions, but trumplicans do. Why are you more angry about the leadership of a private organization than the tax payer funded racist leadership in the trumplican party? Lol, Birther trumplicans complaining bigots
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC The other woman clearly stated that she disagreed with LF sentiments, but she wasn't willing to condemn his entire leadership of an organization just like MM never condemns the trumplican party for harboring racists in their leadership. She needs to focus on her own filthy house.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC I was just asking you, because I assumed you knew since you called out hypocrisy, but you didn't, yet you're angry at me for asking you...wtf is wrong with you?	She did condemn him, but she defends her party &amp; he's in her party, in office, this is a just march...hypocrite much?
@PamBLacerda @MeghanMcCain @DNC Never concede a point to someone unwilling to do the same. She won't condemn King &amp; call for the RNC to drop him &amp; he's in federal office, he's a leader in her party, but she's claiming she's concerned that a leader of a womens march is problematic. She needs to clean her house.
@nycjaneyvee @MeghanMcCain @DNC Trumplicans don't clean their own house, they just complain about someone else's dirty house. Just like their defense of Roy Moore while calling for the resignation of Al Franken.
@erinluv182 @MeghanMcCain @DNC Oh, because it's important to condemn others for what trumplicans defend in their own? Has MM condemned King? He's a leader in her party, shouldn't trumplicans clean their own house before they demand that democrats clean theirs? You have racists in fed office, this is a march.

@ChuckGrassley We need merit based pay for congress, your poorly governed failing welfare state takes more than it pays in, yet you enjoy a socialized pay system where every Senator is paid the same regardless of how poorly their state is doing, thus you have no incentive to do your job.

Dems pushing GOP policies are the problem, Bernie's just a guy.
@kathrynhadley3 @DisavowTrump20 Neither is Amy K really.	I'm undecided but Bernie supporters are largely the progressive base that the Dems have repeatedly thrown aside to favor GOP lite policies, like the ACA &amp; DADT, yet the Dems blame their progressive base voters for leaving the dem party...that's crazy!
@CarrieJ_47 @DisavowTrump20 And yet Bernie is a founder of the largest democratic caucus in the house(the progressive caucus), he's the only senator in that caucus, and the only person who isn't a democrat, so house Democrats treat him like he is a democrat, but they're not the DNC.

Even in Oregon blue regions are forced to subsidize the failing red regions, blue taxpayers are sick of funding trumplican liars.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Don't take my opinion, just crawl down off your self-righteous altar of lies &amp; take your own implied advice &amp; read, unless you're acknowledging that your low IQ makes you incapable of even reading what you claim as your own evidence.	Is there evenone trumplican that isn't a liar?
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Haha, you're a ridiculous liar. This whole interaction started with your dotardian compliant that trumplicans are entitled to spend blue taxpayer's money even after they were crying poor mouth for more farm welfare this year. https://t.co/xIfP3UGDM2
@Richard99060426 @yogibearhydeiho @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Cops use seized assets to fund equipment, and training, but I think it's a great idea to stop law enforcement from directly benefiting from the sezuire of private property.		How about we end trump's golf trips as a start, can't he stop golfing as a show of sacrifice for his wall?
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Trumplican regions are not victims of blue region socialism, they're the unfair beneficiaries of it. 	Show liberals that trumplicans are competent with money by getting their states off the federal dole.		What kind of person hates the Americans that subsidize their communities?
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump No, I just want to stop having my tax dollars stolen to fund poorly governed trumplican welfare state taxpayers that hate me, or a least stop them from claiming that they're entitled to Blue taxpayer money while also claiming they're the victims of Blue taxpayers.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump It's typical when a self righteous lying trumplican experiences cognitive dissonance he believes it's someone else who's being stupid.		I know trumplicans are bad a math, but it's simple math when it comes to which states pay more in federal taxes, and who gets more back.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Awe, I triggered the dotard in you.	You didn't even read the citation moron. It cites that republicans pay more in taxes, not republican states, and not in federal taxes. Typical lying MAGAt.	Yes,some of trump's welfare states have higher state and local taxes than payer states. https://t.co/2xv75fNw32
@Newdelman43 @thehill Wrong the discussion was about the dumbing down of our education system and why teachers are leaving the profession, you blamed liberals, when in reality it's the abusive trumplican policies of homeschooling stealing from education funding.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump So according to you it's wrong for liberals to be inconsistent, but it's okay when trumplicans are inconsistent because liberals are to blame when trumplicans act like the inconsistent liberals they hate?	Lowering the bar for yourself while blaming someone else is deplorable.
@Newdelman43 @thehill Cite your "research" then...I'll wait.	But you admit that homeschooling is a trumplican policy to extract money from the education system so that unqualified and often abusive adults can get a tax break, which has done far more damage to our education system than common core.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Is that where you get your information, quora? Hahahahahahahahahaha! https://t.co/995GYyZGJm
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Haha, stop lying, the trumplicans just gave more welfare to red state farmers, yet they call earned benefits like SSI an entitlement.	Ca already funds welfare red states, so take the money from trump's extra $12B in farm welfare the GOP just gave red states if they want a wall.
@Newdelman43 @thehill That's not true, Common Core isn't a liberal policy it was created by the National Governors Association, definitely not a liberal org. AND the dumbing down is from the trumplicans with their push of gov funded homeschooling, just so they can abuse kids on the taxpayer's dime.

The wall = gov theft of private property.
@yogibearhydeiho @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump How can trumplican states pay for a wall, especially considering they just needed an increase in farm welfare to survive?	Trumplican regions already get more in federal aid than they pay in federal taxes, so trump's states should give up their federal welfare if they want a wall.
@Oliallthetime @WeAreOne_Q @leonard_dudley @realDonaldTrump Trumplicans should show noble compliance to the standard they hold others to and get their failing welfare regions to stop leaching off the democratic tax payers instead of screaming how they're entitled to spend other people's money on a wall.

@trudygonzales @JimboCamino @RepMcClintock My point about any spending issue is that almost all repub controlled parts of our state &amp; country are regions that can't pay their own bills, they have to be subsidize by dem taxpayers to survive, so they're not entitled to demand we spend more blue tax dollars for anything.
@trudygonzales @JimboCamino @RepMcClintock I agree with you on the wall.	I grew up in that district &amp; I still have family there, so I'm aware of the demographics and it's also true that CA04 is subsidized by the Ca blue taxpayers they hate, their hospitals, schools, roads, gov services...are subsidized by blue taxpayers.
@trudygonzales @JimboCamino @RepMcClintock You are so misinformed that you don't understand that CA04 voters shouldn't be offering to pay for anything since they're just offering to spend other people's money. Tell trump's red voters to get off the blue taxpayer's welfare before asking blue voters for a wall. https://t.co/nrAPcSG0h2
@trudygonzales @JimboCamino @RepMcClintock No, you just have trump's poor reading comprehension skills.	CA04 is a republican controlled welfare queen district, his voters are leeches, they're subsidized by ca blue taxpayers they ignorantly hate...his parasites can't afford a wall, they can't even pay their own bills.
@cbouzy If the Dem Party is afraid that Bernie is divisive it's because they want Dems to support more republican policies while claiming they're liberals.	I remember the divisive republican healthcare the Dems gave us when they had all the power, but liars claim Bernie is divisive. Sad.
@cbouzy How is he divisive? Do you understand that he's a founder, the only Senator, and the only non democrat of the largest and most diverse democratic caucus in congress, the progressive caucus? 	The division is coming from the liars that claim he's a threat to the dem party. Gfy.

@LindaPeriut @theAuthoritah @rmayemsinger And Ftr, more damage has been done to America from "intellectuals" &amp; people of influence legally immigrating to America than from the immigrants coming across the southern border.	Some people are too stupid to know what's important to protect, and where the danger is coming from.
@LindaPeriut @theAuthoritah @rmayemsinger Btw, just FYI...half of the people here illegally overstayed their visa, most of those people aren't the ones picking the fields on depressed wages, and many of them aren't from countries that have an extradition treaty with the US.
@chris_montrose @jcamillegray @GOVTWINE Which actually means that I have know idea what to think because the fire alarm going off in my head is getting too loud to ignore.

@LindaPeriut @theAuthoritah @rmayemsinger When you blame the powerless for what the powerful have complete control over, you're either very powerful yourself, or very stupid. 		Learn the facts about illegal immigration, 1/2 of the illegal immigrants flew here. Why isn't ICE going after them?
@LindaPeriut @theAuthoritah @rmayemsinger I'm opposed to illegal immigration, because it depresses the wages of legal farm workers, however I don't vilify the workers for what our society relies on to keep food prices low.	Don't lie about people that give more than they get back, blame the corporation that employs them.
@LindaPeriut @theAuthoritah @rmayemsinger Illegal immigrants aren't committing crimes anywhere near the rate of American citizens, you're more likely to be murdered by a native born American, than an illusion immigrant. 	What you're saying is that your unfounded fears are more important than facts.
@theAuthoritah @LindaPeriut @rmayemsinger And I see them being entrepreneurial here too because they don't qualify for any Government assistance in Ca, they'll take their earnings from picking and buy flats of not pretty enough produce then sell it curbside cheaper than in the grocery store, just to make a little extra.
@theAuthoritah @LindaPeriut @rmayemsinger I see the illegal immigrant bent over in the fields day &amp;night, lights are brought in &amp;they're paid piece meal wages, not an hourly wage they live merit based pay every day.	If illegal immigrants weren't picking our fields for low wages most Americans couldn't afford strawberries
@theAuthoritah @LindaPeriut @rmayemsinger Me either, and I live in a state that relies on illegal immigration to make sure our produce is cheap enough for the the voters in poorly run red states to afford. According to statistics I see a lot of illegal immigrants, they're bent over in the fields of America's salad bowl.

@CheetahkitD1 @realDonaldTrump He thinks it will be a monument of remembrance to him.		If it is ever built he's made it a perpetual target for anti-hate groups, they'll never stop trying to tear it down. The Berlin Wall was shorter and it was a money pit to maintain.
@realDonaldTrump There was bi-partisan belief that the US absolutely needed to fix healthcare, but when the ACA came up for a vote not a single trumplican would cast a vote to support it, the same should be done to trumplicans or they'll never learn. It's a teaching moment.	No traitor wall!

@350ktmsx @cadenE32 @michaelkeyes @HillaryClinton Those mercs choose that duty, they weren't forced to go to a dangerous place because of our government, they were contractors that volunteered for dangerous duty for a ton of untaxed pay. They chose to go there to profit from war, not sacrifice for America. Gfy.
@350ktmsx @cadenE32 @michaelkeyes @HillaryClinton The Soldiers in Niger that were paid a pittance in comparison to those mercenaries were sent by our government too, they couldn't quit&amp;go home, but you don't give a crap about their murder.

@cadenE32 @350ktmsx @michaelkeyes @HillaryClinton Then he's a deplorable traitor, because the three that died in Benghazi were mercenaries, in Niger they were Active duty US soldier that were murdered because of corrupt incompetence, so he obviously loves mercs, but spits on the graves of soldiers.

@tedlieu Would you vote to authorize military action in Syria?
@jessdontstop @tedlieu I also can't stand trump, and I agree with Mr. Lieu, the troops aren't authorized to be there, trump is right to pull them out &amp; if the American people want troops in Syria we need to direct our congressional representatives to authorize it. #WarPowersClause
@ErikSperling @tedlieu @WilliamBold2 The Constitution is clear under the War Power Clause that Congress(Not the President) has the Power to declare war. Those troops need congressional authorization to be there.	But I wouldn't trust a cowardly bone spur, lying traitor to direct baton twirlers much less US soldiers.
@Gr8nessNaHoodie @tedlieu Exit strategy? I don't believe we had any strategy going in, my guess is that troops will cross right back across the border they came from&amp;we might continue strategic bombing, but the bottom line is that the unconstitutional use of US troops needs to end. End it, or authorize it

@ArtemisionGreen @tedlieu @POTUS Blame congress for not doing their job and authorizing a war in Syria. The troops we have there are there in violation of our constitution, therefore subject to the whims of the POTUS, if congress had done their job what POTUS did today might have been treason.
@ArtemisionGreen @tedlieu @POTUS If congress had done their job &amp; authorized the war we'd be able to call what he did today treason, but congress refuses to authorize(or fund) our wars.	It's a great loophole...if congress doesn't declare war our gov officials can't be charged with treason for helping an enemy.
@tedlieu @POTUS THANK YOU SIR! "The Congress shall have Power to declare war".	If we want a war, we need to authorize and fund that war. Where are all those pocket constitutions now? We the People, our voices matter most in decisions of war, our elected representatives need to be heard!

@ExportedFromMI @tedlieu @POTUS Why are you disagreeing with him over something he never wrote? Did you even read his tweet before you disagreed with it?		He‚Äôs right that troops are not authorized to be in Syria and you just like to lie about what others have written to stroke your know nothing ego. Strange.
@ExportedFromMI @tedlieu @POTUS You don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre arguing against. Mr Lieu never claimed our troops weren‚Äôt strategically important, he rightful states that they shouldn‚Äôt be there because congress hasn‚Äôt authorized a war in Syria, that‚Äôs just a fact not his opinion. It‚Äôs unconstitutional.
@ExportedFromMI @tedlieu @POTUS What part of ‚ÄúThe Congress shall have the Power to declare war‚Äù is confusing about us being engaged in a war that hasn‚Äôt been authorized or funded by congress?	Of course war profiteers claim that congress has authorized perpetual, limitless, unfunded war, w/o objectives/oversight
@ExportedFromMI @tedlieu @POTUS Why are you lying? It‚Äôs simply not true that ‚Äúnearly every single foreign policy expert in the country‚Äù disagrees with Mr. Lieu‚Äôs assertion that US troops in Syria violate the constitution, I challenge you to name even one that says troops are legally engaged in war in Syria.
@ExportedFromMI @tedlieu @POTUS Why bother, read the War Powers Clause in the United States Constitution for yourself, it‚Äôs very basic, and while it‚Äôs true that Mr Lieu is not in a job that directly profits from war, he graduated magna cum laude with a J.D. from Georgetown &amp; he‚Äôs a Colonel in the ASAF reserve.

@Grr_Argh_1996 @SharylAttkisson The incident might have been avoided if we had US marines providing security instead of war profiteers that failed at their job. Then we rewarded those failed mercs by giving their families what US soldiers get when they're killed in combat, + what their private co gave them.
@Grr_Argh_1996 @SharylAttkisson Screw that, those mercenaries were paid way more than US soldiers, but trump's traitors don't care about trump's bone spur incompetence that allowed 4 US soldiers to be murdered in Niger. Only traitors cry about the murder of mercs, while ignoring the murder of US soldiers.
@AnnCoulter Right, the same freaks that cried like cut pigs over the words HRC used to explain the murder of an ambassador and three mercenaries, now claim that the words traitor trump uses don't really mean anything.	Trump's traitor sheep just never stop their traitor bleating.

@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising I disagree with this, because I‚Äôm tired of subsidizing people that will lie to claim they‚Äôre subsidizing me. We need to stop subsidizing the lying parasite states until they learn to tell the truth, that they aren‚Äôt the victims of liberal policy, they‚Äôre beneficiaries of it.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Lest we forget that the leader of the trumplican red states, the very best trumplican those welfare states could find to worship is a lying New Yorker named bankruptcy Don, Bush's train wreck economy, now trump's, but tell me how it's blue policies that bring gov to the cliff.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising https://t.co/Y5PvFUvBmR
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Okay, then start ranting about the taker states, condemn those states that love to lie &amp; attack the hard working Americans that feed them. I'm a democratic socialist or dust bowl conservative so I'm for sharing, I'm not for sharing with lying crooks who claim they're the victim.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Why are you being a hypocrite if you're not a trumplican? 	So, Trumplicans asked for enormous debt when they continue to give tax cuts to the wealthiest &amp; start perpetual wars but of course you only condemn dem policies, while you lie that it's Ca that's on the cliff. https://t.co/NwdDhpphe7
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Ca is forced to subsidize the red states that get the majority of the welfare farm bill and we're the #1 Ag producing state in the nation. Red states love Corp welfare.	You're just desperate to fabricate any justification for why red states are entitled to other people's money.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising That's a trumplican lie, SS isn't welfare. Funny how you purposefully choose to claim SS is welfare now when earlier you were ranting that people were owed that money from years of work...get your lies straight.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Maybe we can stop letting the states that can‚Äôt even create an environment that their own kids want to live in make economic policies that they blame blue states for. Stop letting the takers run things.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising No most of those taker states that have a higher percentage of SS recipients had poor economic policies that failed to provide jobs so their kids would stay. WV doesn‚Äôt want tech jobs they want gov funded coal jobs, coal is free market disappearing but trumplicans love welfare.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising When you spend years working &amp; voting in bad social &amp; economic policies your kids leave your state but of course when kids from poorly governed taker states want to move to successful blue states, trumplicans blame the blue state taxpayers for creating a more attractive state. Ha
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising The biggest takers aren‚Äôt Bernie bros, they‚Äôre trumplican liars, just like the famed ‚Äújoe the plumber‚Äù who the trumplicans claimed was a victim of high taxes until we found out he was a lying tax cheat, just like trump and all his ilk. https://t.co/k3eVqm8KZJ

@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Stop blaming California for being successful and while just like our nation, California is not perfect, but to rant about our problems while justifying the poor governance of the most unhealthy, least educated, and the poorest taker states is just trumplican of you. https://t.co/hkYIaDsER4
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Correction, SSI deficit is funded in the budget, the majority of SSI payments are still funding as a reimbursement from the SSI trust fund congress has borrowed from.

@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising I'm a veteran, I served in this state when we had not just government contracts but military bases everywhere because it's strategic to protect our water border, and that fed spending left because of politics while we added bases in Arkansas.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising You have zero idea what you're writing about and your attempt to justify the disparity by claiming Fed military spending in Ca just free market left the state, or that the difference in fed spending is somehow about SSI...it's not part of the fed budget, that's not included. https://t.co/tP72OmRcot
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising No I wouldn't because not calling out ducks when they quacked like ducks is how we got trump &amp; your purposefully false claims that blue policies in Ca have us on the verge of collapse while refusing to admit that it's the red state tax policies that are failing is a Trumpian lie.

Fix the failing red states first.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising In Ca I pay a higher school tax without having a kid than red region voters do when they have 12 but that doesn't stop the trumplicans in my state from crying that they're the real victims of democracy. Trumplicans hate our voting system unless it's been perverted to benifit them
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising I'm forced to subsidize the people that vote to keep their state a welfare state, they oppose blue policies so they can continue to claim that it's the blue states that keep them poor &amp; unemployed.	Save red states from the socialist nipple that has made them fat, lazy, liars.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Ug, you have a poor understanding of our representative democracy, it's not about the electoral college, it's about every single vote taken in congress, and it's not a matter of majority rule, it's a perversion of our rights as a citizen and taxpayer.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Proving once again that trumplicans are self-centered socialists that claim to be entitled to take money from the blue taxpayers they lie about just to subsidize their voters, all while complaining that the Ca voters they take from are wrong for raising taxes to pay for their own
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising You're ignoring the huge federal expenditures on welfare jobs to red regions to build military equipment that the military doesn't even want.	My point is that you should stop screaming that Ca is awful while you ignore failing red states that can't even keep their schools open.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Your understanding of taxes ignores the simple mathematical fact that the red regions benefit more from blue tax policy than the blue taxpayers that pay the lions share of the taxes &amp; that's especially true in California.	https://t.co/gb289IqgDU
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising Red regions of this country benefit more from blue tax policies than the blue voters paying them, because we're forced to subsidize their poor governance. Red regions are benefiting the most from American socialism yet they never stop lying about how they're the victims.
@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @coopercoach @NicholsUprising If red states were forced to subsidize Ca they would undoubtedly call it welfare, that‚Äôs why I do. Plus California pays more than 2x the amount in fed revenue than any red state and our vote only has about 1/4 of the voting power. We literally let the takers run the country.

@JustSchmeltzer @JordanFlower @coopercoach @NicholsUprising They're clueless about Ca and taxes.

@JordanFlower @JustSchmeltzer @NicholsUprising Maybe this time during a recession Ca could stop subsidizing the red welfare states &amp; keep their tax $$ in Ca.

@dean_dahl @CDChambers62 @GreerMcVay @IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed We don't really care for your lies of being victims of democracy.

It's sad how trumplicans will choose to believe that they've been victimized instead of mathematical facts.
@dean_dahl @CDChambers62 @GreerMcVay @IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Rural Ca doesn't pay for their own roads, hospitals, police, schools, libraries or gov buildings, but they sure run their lying mouths about how they believe they're the victims of high taxes in Ca while they're actually the leeches.	Stop lying that trumplicans are the victims.
@dean_dahl @CDChambers62 @GreerMcVay @IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Here's how ignorant it is for rural Californians to complain about their taxes...I don't have kids but I payer higher school taxes than the inbred rural republican with 12 kids because I'm forced to subsidize their rural welfare lifestyle. https://t.co/gb289IqgDU

@Rufus_GB Yes, because his personal legal issues can't restrict him from voting and representing his voters, he wasn't accused of political corruption...which lobbyists love. Do you hate him because you couldn't buy his vote on something?
@Rufus_GB So what, he's a veteran with a problem. We have laws against stopping our elected officials from doing their duty. His personal problems shouldn't interfere with his constituents rights to be represented by his vote. Stop hating American democracy.
@Rufus_GB Doesn't matter, he's your leader, he's the very best your party could find to lead the republican now trumplican party. Only a liar defends the GOP party while disavowing their dear leader. Try again.
@Rufus_GB @MattBatzel Well trumplican lobbyists are the biggest liars around, so the evidence is clear that you're a fucking trumplican liar.
@Rufus_GB They didn't spring him you deplorable liar...a DUI often results in zero jail time, the law restricts keeping a legislator from voting during sessions. If Dems hadn't fought that, trump's traitors would arrest every Dem before every vote....so just stop lying.
@Rufus_GB Why did you lie that the trumplican party threw him out for being a drunk? You're just a trumplican liar.
@Rufus_GB @MattBatzel He is a veteran you bone spur loving orange clown. The clown is you, because after you've lied in this thread you ignorantly believe that your claim of knowing him is even remotely believable. Once you lie, you don't deserve to be believed, stop spewing trumplican lies.
@Rufus_GB @MattBatzel That's so stupidly funny, he was a Republican but you won't claim him, yet he was never a democrat but you claim he was theirs...trumplicans are never able to accept any responsibility, but they're great at placing false blame on others.
@Rufus_GB @MattBatzel No, he was a veteran with a problem...bone spurs can't understand.	It's deplorable to lie that the GOP threw him out &amp; ridiculous to claim that the GOP would throw someone out for being a drunk especially since they excuse pedophilia, domestic violence, and financial fraud.

@MeaghanHaggert1 @CyrusMMcQueen @Trumpgot2go Good for you. That's what is so scary, good officers can't be good without risking their own lives at the hands of the very people we pay to protect us all. Accountability is what I believe would give good officers the opportunity to restore the respect of the public.
@Trumpgot2go @MeaghanHaggert1 @CyrusMMcQueen Perhaps, but the Rampart report showed that a culture of racism in a police department often causes POC in law enforcement (for their own safety and advancement opportunities) to engage in the same racist conduct as racist officers, often POC are more at risk if they report.
@MeaghanHaggert1 @CyrusMMcQueen @Trumpgot2go "Not all bad" is the excuse cops give for not reporting criminal behavior within their own ranks. From Serpico to the Rampart report and beyond show there are only two types of police officers, the ones that commit crimes, and the ones that don't report crimes committed by police https://t.co/MuXYciyYCT

@Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog You're a LIAR. He didn't vote against the Magnitzky act because there was no vote on the Magnitzky act, as I've already stated the bill was a repeal of the Jackson-Valnik amendment which would normalize trade with Russia &amp; the Magnitzky act was simply a provision of that bill.
@Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog You never asked me if there was anything I disagreed with Bernie about, that wasn't the question I responded to or the topic of our disagreement, you've simply made up lies to suit your freakish irrational hate for Bernie, you stink like a lying, name calling hypocrite dotard.
@Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog I know it's hard for narcissists to see their own faults but calling someone that merely states facts about Bernie's voting record a "sandernista " is a name calling lie...do you see it now or should I lie about you, and call you names until you understand?
@Phaedrus08 @tobiaslane @ThomB01 @BravenakBlog Lastly, your irrational focus on him is freakishly obsessive &amp; that's why I mentioned it, you're incapable of rational thought toward him to the point that you believe you know his motivations are evil but others that might be equally evil don't inspire your irrational judgement
@tobiaslane @ThomB01 @Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog I didn't accuse anyone of being in a cult, that's just a lie.	BS voted against normalizing trade with Russia, the Magnitzky act was a provision of that bill, you're incapable of admitting facts &amp; your adamant denial of the facts proves that you're guilty of what you accuse me of.

@tobiaslane @ThomB01 @Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog Yes it's like accusing people that state facts about Bernie of being in a cult, so if you don't like it being done to you, don't do it to others. And you shouldn't give advice that you obviously refuse to open your eyes and take yourself. Re-evaluate your hypocrisy.
@Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog Proving that name calling liars are so self absorbed that they even complain when someone dishes them what they just served....haha.
@Phaedrus08 @tobiaslane @ThomB01 @BravenakBlog What's really funny is that you're congratulating yourself for misunderstanding something I never wrote...how cute.
@tobiaslane @ThomB01 @Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog 4 other democratic senators voted against it as well in 2012, and 43 house reps which included the only member of congress to vote no on the AUMF, so the suggestion that anyone who didn't vote for it, is somehow soft on Russia is cult like hate, or intentional ignorance.
@tobiaslane @ThomB01 @Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog No, it was provisions of the Magnitzky act that were attached HR 6156 the Jackson-Vanik Repeal Act of 2012. It's not accurate to claim that he voted against a provision of a bill while ignoring the fact that he was actually voting against the bill which normalized trade w/ Russia
@tobiaslane @ThomB01 @Phaedrus08 @BravenakBlog I agree, but to claim that Bernie voted against the Magnitzky act is just a lie that the Russian propaganda machine spews...how about Bernie haters hold themselves to the same standard they hold him to and stop pushing Russian propaganda.

@BravenakBlog The law with the Magnitzky act in it also contained provisions to normalize trade with Russia that's why 43 US reps voted against it.	The Russian sanctions bill included sanctions on Iran which the traitor GOP is trying to push us into a war with, which is why he voted no.
