@realDonaldTrump ...Why did you capitalize the word country?
@the_ryan_moore @djmickeasy @realDonaldTrump Holy shit, you're right. I forgot about that.		Side note, I actually found a copy of Mein Kampf in my high school library. Long story short, I tried reading it, and it turns it's full of bullshit.		WHO WOULDA THOUGHT
@charliekirk11 If American liberals are talking about Social Democracy rather than Socialism, why is Charlie Kirk still a fucking moron?		(Hint: because he literally doesn't know the difference between these two concepts)
@djmickeasy @realDonaldTrump Well, I mean, according to one of his ex-wives he kept Hitler's "Mein Kamp" on his nightstand for about two years.		....But there are good people on both sides, I guess. 🤠

@TruthHurts312 @chuckwoolery Yeah, I'm just calling Palin the nail in that coffin. Er, excuse the phrase.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi How do you know my reaction to facts if you won't even bother to provide any?
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Fact: liberal progressives advocating for single payer, ending the wars, getting money out of politics, legalizing marijuana, ending for profit prisons, infrastructure spending, higher minimum wage, and taxing the rich don't watch FOX News.		Just admit you're full of shit.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi I know you don't need friends, you need facts. GIFs and emojis aren't arguments.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi I actually wanted facts, you can tell because I specifically asked for them.		Y'know, it's ALMOST like you're avoiding the subject because you don't have any.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Still waiting for those facts you mentioned.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Thank you for the substantive reply.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren If you take that out of the equation 9 of the 10 poorest states are still deep-red (so who needs the welfare?) and most of the top 8 food stamp recipients are still also red.		Keep diggin' the hole, buddy.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren DAMN, what a hot red herring! Proven wrong, change the subject. A classic.		9 of the top ten states consuming the most "handouts" are red states. The top 9 states contributing to that welfare fund are blue states. Hope that doesn't trigger you.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Good to know you're horrible at art, lol.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Right, because FOX News is SO great at convincing people the Democrats aren't liberal enough; because FOX is SO quick to argue Obamacare was there idea. Spare me.		Aren't you the one currently in disbelief of easily verifiable facts? Do you know what "projection" means?
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Actually, the term is a stand-alone concept that can be equally applied to the entire political spectrum, and the current president is objectively the most thin-skinned delicate snowflake in politics.		This is just too easy dude. Quit while your behind. https://t.co/NETsH1DtR0
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Snowflake = A person perceived by others to have an inflated sense of uniqueness or an unwarranted sense of entitlement, or to be over-emotional, easily offended, and unable to deal with opposing opinions, snowflake.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren I didn't call you a liberal. I called you a snowflake. Pretending words don't have meaning isn't as clever as you think it is.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi If you believe in facts, maybe you should prove it by supplying some.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Most normal people don't get triggered by obvious jokes, you precious little snowflake.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi I appreciate the substantive reply.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Real talk tho, what are you, 5? Being off-color isn't a mental disorder and I'm sorry you don't have a developed sense of humor. If some macabre imagery triggers you go somewhere else ya snowflake.
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren I'm sorry, the REO Speedwagon bit really did cross the line.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Could you please re-articulate this word salad? Obamacare was a right-wing brainchild of conservative think-tank The Heritage Foundation, not single payer. The democrats had the votes to pass single payer, and after that a public option, and both times the big pharma money won.
@KhalilBSantos1 @baynedesigns @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren He actually very clearly IS angry about that and you're misconstruing his position in a bizarre way.
@DIETpepsi50 @NancyPelosi Did they deliver with a single payer healthcare system? Or by ending the wars, not expanding them? Did they deliver by extending the Bush Tax Cuts? Did they deliver by implementing a living wage when they could have? Did they deliver by getting big money out of politics?
@esaagar @DailyCaller BREAKING: "Donald Trump Believes FOX News Comprises 15% of All News Media"
@HenryHigginsJr @baynedesigns @KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren By telling the same mushy minded kids to rape the bodies, set them on fire, do a Hitler salute, and then play a copy of REO Speedwagon's Greatest Hits at full volume.		Never underestimate how much more serious a crime can get.
@chuckwoolery She also said a lot of stupid things that cost him the presidency. I'd be a little miffed too.
@ThEnemyIsUs @DailyCaller @STEPHMHAMILL I thought so, and I appreciate it!
@RealCandaceO Having great accomplishments in one field does not mean that one's actions in another field (Politics) have not hurt minorities at the behest of a mostly white republican establishment.
@ThEnemyIsUs @DailyCaller @STEPHMHAMILL I was referencing the article, which I falsely assumed came first.		CNN was still 2 days ahead of them.		"Politifact rates this Mostly True." Lol
@KhalilBSantos1 @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren I actually did stick entirely to the topic, my post indicated quite clearly I would be mad about these guys going free on a technicality, and you yourself literally changed the topic by bringing up Chicago.		The surrounding cities &amp; states have lax gun laws making smuggling easy.
@BuckSexton @benshapiro @conservmillen The Beatles is 1 of a handful of bands to create over 10 albums which are all consistently good and mostly incredible, ranging a variety of unique genres for a broad discography. Revolver has more hits on it than U2's entire career full of whiny garbage.		Not the sword to die on.
@chuckwoolery All hail president Bill Cosby.		...Aaaaand just like that your argument is broken.
@DailyCaller @STEPHMHAMILL CNN literally covered this 3 days before you guys.		It's almost like you're wrong. Huh.
@SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump Glad to know you feel this way. Now let's all, as progressives, work toward a NATIONAL wage increase guaranteeing all citizens are guaranteed to rise above poverty and tie it to inflation.
@benshapiro Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons by giving them back their own frozen assets is somehow worse than a stupid, harmless dance?		It's almost like your method on How to Debate the Left and Destroy Them is rooted fundamentally in dishonest framing. Huh.
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren If you think libs aren't upset about radical Islamic kidnappers training their victims to shoot school children with guns the Military Industrial Complex made so widely available nationwide with the help from conservative gun-policy, congrats, you might just be a partisan hack.
@ViewsFromThe9_ This is just silly. He's well within the range of NFL ready players. The NFL is a company like any other that values profits above almost all else; the slightest hint of controversy is always viewed by the corporate mind as bad for the bottom line.
@AnnCoulter American citizens commit more crimes on average than the typical illegal alien. #DeportAnnCoulter
@benshapiro I don't understand why you insist on being on the wrong side of almost literally every issue.
@NancyPelosi Than why does the moderate right wing Democratic establishment actively oppose popular liberal ideas known to work worldwide designed to help working families?		Why do the establishment Democrats never deliver on their promises when they manage to gain power and enough votes?
@Boar250624 @RealCandaceO Actually, this is absolutely untrue. Within the parameters of the 97% figure (which IIRC has since actually risen to about 99%) is the caveat that human activity is the primary cause for the current radical surge of climate change.
@Boar250624 @RealCandaceO Uncle Tom's sister.
@RealCandaceO Newspeak: (noun) The psycho-political manipulation of speech in which the very definitions of words are changed in order to dishonestly change the way people think.		Hey Candace, here's a great book recommendation: democratic socialist George Orwell's prophetic novel "1984".
@Boar250624 @RealCandaceO OK; here's one. Over 97% of the world's scientists agree Climate Change is real. Here's another fact: Aunt Tomika ain't a scientist.
@Powow22 @SirGoldenrod @AYankforlife @lisamikol1969 @DineshDSouza When two things exist simultaneously, that doesn't make them one and the same. That's silliness. There are capitalist authoritarian states as well as communist ones. Stop equating economics with social issues.
@Powow22 @AYankforlife @SirGoldenrod @lisamikol1969 @DineshDSouza We don't ignore economic left-wingers like Stalin Mao and Pol Pot. Fascism is not an economic principle; it's primarily social. So, you can be left wing on economic issues while still being conservative on social government operation as a fascist. Get it now?
@AYankforlife @SirGoldenrod @lisamikol1969 @Powow22 @DineshDSouza State control of business is communism, not socialism. You don't even know the base definitions of the poltiical terms you're tossing around.		Centralized healthcare is proven worldwide to work really well dude, lol
@AYankforlife @SirGoldenrod @lisamikol1969 @Powow22 @DineshDSouza And Mussolini's crimes weren't exactly the economic ones, now were they? No. He's been dragged through history over his right wing social positions.
@AYankforlife @SirGoldenrod @lisamikol1969 @Powow22 @DineshDSouza Censorship of counter speech/dissenters is categorically conservative in principle.		Calling Mussolini's economy socialist is misleading. It was a blend of industrialist capitalism, classic liberalism and some New Deal socialism. Regardless, it saved their economy, grew it 20%
@AYankforlife @SirGoldenrod @lisamikol1969 @Powow22 @DineshDSouza What you just cited refers to propaganda-based education prioritizing a shift in the culture aimed at turning people into tools of the state. Shoving this brand of nationalism down kids throats was definitely fascist, and your idea of state control is COMMUNISM, not Socialism.
@Powow22 @SirGoldenrod @AYankforlife @lisamikol1969 @DineshDSouza Funny thing about that Powell? Establishment Democrats call themselves "liberal" all the time. Fact is, if you study their policies, they're far more like Reagan era conservatives.		In other words, yeah, sometimes labels are sloppy. See People's Republic of Korea for more details
@Powow22 @AYankforlife @lisamikol1969 @DineshDSouza Hitler's economy was a complicated, mixed bag. It was a blend of capitalism and communism, not socialism, despite the fact he truly hated both systems individually. It's also retarded to slander economic socialists as "Nazi economists" because the Nazi economy worked really well.
@AYankforlife @lisamikol1969 @Powow22 @DineshDSouza National socialism and Economic Socialism (the one that matters) are two completely different things. If you don't know that it means you're ignorant of the most basic political science concepts.		Marxism is not "Socialism mixed with Nationalism", lmfao.
@Powow22 @DineshDSouza "National Socialism" and "Economic Socialism" (the one that matters) are two completely different political animals and I'm sorry but if you don't know that it means you have absolutely no knowledge of VERY basic political science concepts.		Nazi's hated communists, ya walnut.
@DineshDSouza Fascism is almost exclusively right-wing in nature and Hitler and Mussolini were DEFINITIVELY of the right wing variety, you brazenly ignorant snake oil salesman. When has white supremacy ever NOT been conservative? Do you just PRETEND to know what words mean or something?
@RealCandaceO @shaunking Wow Aunt Tomika, even when you're lying you don't get the false narrative straight.		The misinformative propaganda Breitbart put out was that King lied about being, bi-racial, not black. And to top it off, it's completely baseless shite.		Also, Climate change denial = misinformed
@RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you're a wildly transparent, ditsy climate change denier used as a black stage-prop to parrot all the bad shit a white guy like Charlie Kuck isn't allowed to say about black people in 2018.		No point in picking low hanging fruit.
@RealCandaceO New Rule: If you're a climate change denier, the phrase "I slaughtered you with facts" is permanently off-limits.		Also, criticizing his words on police brutality against blacks by saying he's acting "thug-life"? Really? Fucking check yourself Aunt Tomika.
@RealCandaceO There's an entire establishment news network called FOX that props you up and gives you a cushy platform often, despite you being a goofy, clueless climate change denier (which tarnishes any shred of credibility you have).		Turning Point USA is funded by establishment donors.
@charliekirk11 Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic Socialist endorsed by Justice Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, just won in Michigan.		If you're going to make shitty arguments at least attempt to base them on facts. Have fun in Shapiro's shadow, you are SUCH amateur hour material.
@BreitbartNews In other words, Alexandria is correctly pointing out the fact that Democratic establishment is losing power because they fight for an economic class (the upper-middle) that wealth inequality has wiped out, when the electoral energy is all on a growing poor-working class. Problem?
Doesn't this directly contradict your baseless narrative that the Democrats are all "scary radical socialists"? https://t.co/hNxWPsYTWo
@charliekirk11 Doesn't this directly contradict your baseless narrative that the Democrats are all "scary radical socialists"?
It happens. Most illegal entry goes over the wall by airplane and illegals commit the same or less crime on average compared to native citizens. This is cheap and inefficient brown-scare propaganda. https://t.co/LfRrpQ8Aqq
@DLoesch It happens. Most illegal entry goes over the wall by airplane and illegals commit the same or less crime on average compared to native citizens. This is cheap and inefficient brown-scare propaganda.
Be aware your criticizing the constitutional right of assembly and petition the government for redress of grievances.		Without marching in the streets we wouldn't have the (only) 8 hour work day, any minimum wage, paid vacation time, 2 day weekend, &amp; the civil rights movement. https://t.co/Gy4adMvNQY
@marcorubio You should be ashamed Rubio. This isn't a "creative option", it's Social Security theft. Cut the bullshit. The so-called greatest nation of earth can afford 2 guarantee maternal leave for all like much of the 1st world. We have the money but your budgetary priorities are garbage.
@RealCandaceO Freedom is so conservative, in fact, right wing drug policy has made the United States the largest prison state on the face of the planet, harboring a staggering +20% of the world's incarcerated population.		If the minimum wage was a living wage we could nearly eliminate welfare.
@RealCandaceO Black support 4 Republicans avgs. 10% for the last 12 elections. That's 1.3% of the black population.		92% of blacks disapprove of Trump. 7% don't. 	84% of blacks find Trump racist. 10% don't.	Only 1% of these blacks described themselves as Republicans.		Thanks Aunt Tomika
@Flunkee @SenatorHeitkamp Universal Healthcare is literally 1 of the top rated issues for voters nationwide, rivaled only by pot legalization, &amp; ranges from 60-70%. Said healthcare also has shocking bipartisan support; Bernie got a standing ovation for it from republican voters.		Please cite your claims.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 An Aussie Big Mac (a commodity produced by cheap MW labor) is also only 47 cents more there last time I heard, so any argument about rampant inflation on this issue is bunk too; not that you mentioned it, though, just being thorough.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 ...If you want a real world example, there's Australia. The Aussie dollar is roughly just as powerful as the US's. They have a $15 MW. They have a 5.6 unemployment rate, which is remarkably average; it's not a job killer. Keeps people off welfare when they can afford to live too!
@James712341 @charliekirk11 Wrong. There is little to no econ. data supporting your claim, to be frank. Many cities in the nation have raised to $15 and seen job growth. MW increases give consumers money they cycle back into the economy, generating demand, generating growth, generating jobs. AND...
@James712341 @charliekirk11 Bingo. It's not the same as slavery, to be sure, but the parallels are scary.		The cost of a slave is housing food and healthcare. Due to stagnant wages republicans refuse to help raise, 50% of working people live in poverty and can hardly afford said costs for themselves. Yikes.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 Yes, after 8 years, plenty of time for party paradigms to shift dramatically (people underestimate how fast this changes). Nixon's resignation/scandal probably explains this.		South goes red again 12 years, and moderately blue for Clinton, who ran as a conservative to get votes.
@RubinReport Government shouldn't get involved, agreed. But voicing opinions is only so effective when they actively stifle them and have more power, since they're holding the strings; also, YouTube DEFINITELY has gotten worse dude, lol. Maybe It's easy not to see that when taking Koch money.
@Tim_Canova I can't tell you how many comments I've seen on political threads about the press where Trump-train passengers complain about how the media "lacks decorum" and must "respect the president no matter what", "don't challenge him".		That is exactly what journalism must NOT ever be!
@SenateGOP Trump's economic impact is tiny thus far. He's passed almost no major econ. legislation sans the tax giveaway 4 the rich, which hasn't been in effect long enough to change much anything. Effects of econ. leg. take years to show.		Plus the growth bubble is about to burst like 2008
@BreitbartNews Twitter as a private company has all the right in the world to ban Donald J. Trump, not just because their private status says they can censor whoever they like but also because he has repeatedly violated terms of service.		THAT BEING SAID, they shouldn't. Censorship is garbage.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 But again, point is, Kirk's using a tired old talking point to dishonestly claim that *liberals and leftists* used to want slavery, while suggesting they may want it now too. That's just retarded because slavery is inherently conservative in principle, he's a scummy propagandist.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 And no, the modern GOP doesn't want racially based slavery; that makes them liberal on the issue. They do however want a more universal economic wage-slavery where the working class can't put food on the table. On that they're quite conservative.
@James712341 @charliekirk11 Party membership switched in a big way, not necessarily the platform; sorry, I misspoke. After the CRA pass the racist Dixiecrats all shifted Republican because of Nixon and followed Goldwater. Historic Electoral maps confirm this; the whole south suddenly turns red in the 60's.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Obama broke 2% 5 times.	Obama broke 3% 3 times.	Obama broke 4% 1 time.	That 4% break was 5.2% growth in the third quarter of 2014.		Your father talks like he broke his fuckin' skull because his parents dropped him as a baby.
@newtgingrich Single Payer healthcare is literally in the top 3 of policies supported by the majority of Americans and Democratic Socialists are moderate leftists according to the rest of the industrialized world, you walking handbag of a man
@MattsIdeaShop Um, actually, when u ask an American dem socialist about Venezuela, we usually point out the fact that our economic models r based on SCANDINAVIA, the happiest place on earth with a much higher standard of living, not authoritarian Venezuela. Straw man arguments aren't impressive
@charliekirk11 Illegals are spread all across the south, which are largely Red states. But y'know what Charlie? Let's compromise and get rid of the electoral college entirely! After all, it's not democratic.		...Oh, but Republicans would never win another Presidency without it, now would they?
@charliekirk11 Israel murders Palestinian civs	It's not a choice between Illegals or Americans	Socialist programs work in Scandinavia	Republicans take way more lobby money	Criminal Police are the issue	Trump put TPP into NAFTA	#45 gave Wall St. billions in taxes	4 cases of voter fraud annually
@charliekirk11 ...Because he's passed no major economic legislation sans the tax giveaway to the rich, which hasn't been in effect long enough to do anything, and we've been seeing these trends in growth since the end of Obama's term.		PS, we're also likely in a growth bubble that will burst.
@charliekirk11 Did you know:		Lincoln's Party was nothing like today's Republican party; parties evolve over time. Today's Reps aren't even like 1980s Reagan Reps, who were moderate by comparison		Bonus fact: Abolition of slavery is liberal by definition &amp; the old Dems were social conservatives
@TomiLahren Until these migrant children suddenly develop a mass case of Stockholm syndrome, I doubt they agree Tomi.
@RealCandaceO Blacks are 2.5x more likely to be killed by a cop. Black communities have less money; if you're born into one, you'll likely stay poor. Black sounding names on job apps are more often rejected, etc. I don't have to deal with this: THATS white privilege.		Thanks anyway Aunt Tomika
@James712341 @charliekirk11 ...What are you talking about? The socially conservative Democrats supporting slavery fought to keep it. However, Democrats of today are liberal on the issue. Point is, party platforms switch. The GOP backed CRA was liberal. Kirk literally isn't making any relevant criticism.
@nytimes Well thanks for blowing her fuckin' cover ya dingbats
@Random_EggHead @nytimes This argument is a false equivalency.		Genitalia is determined by chromosomes but hormone imbalances often drive sexual identity. Transgenderism is inherently biological, and you can't discriminate on genetics. Transracialism is driven by cultural perception, which is subjective.
@LouDobbs If you think Paul Ryan is in any way shape or form a RINO, you probably don't know much about the political spectrum... or his economic philosophy... or social agenda... or... anything...
@James712341 @charliekirk11 Legal slavery, declaration of war to protect slavery, segregation &amp; Jim Crow, opposition to the Civil Rights act. These positions held to traditional political attitudes and values and are cautious about change or innovation; the literal definition of Conservatism.
@charliekirk11 In other words, ignore the fact these are all fundamentally conservative policy positions, by definition. They were proposed by dEmOnCrAtS!!1		...Yeah, conservative Democrats. Your arguments are so basic and one dimensional it hurts my face.
@charliekirk11 And then after the passing of the Civil Rights act all the racist Dixiecrats made an exodus over to the Republican party IT'S ALMOST LIKE PARTY LINE VALUES SHIFT OVER TIME AND HISTORY IS NUANCED, WHO'DA THUNK IT!
@Random_EggHead @nytimes And again, transgender folk are literally a protected class when it comes to civil law. You can't force trans to use designated bathrooms largely for the same reason we don't have "colored" bathrooms anymore. This conversation goes nowhere 'cause you have no legal case to make.
@Random_EggHead @nytimes I think you underestimate deep rooted homophobic tension in America. I think you're purposely ignoring the very real possibility that biological men dressed as women using a men's room are going to get the shit kicked out of them. More important than bigots feeling uncomfortable.

@ananavarro #FakeNews , fake latinas, fake blacks, fake women, fake polls, fake election, fake everything, the government did JFK 9/11 was inside a job and Alex Jones is a hologram
@Random_EggHead @nytimes If you identify as one gender and are forced to use the bathroom of the other gender, it's incredibly awkward. The notion trans people won't be targeted if they "just use the stall" is wrong and you know it.		Leave it be and let 'em pee, man.
@RealCandaceO Do I need this coming from a rising star in the right-wing echo chamber?
@Random_EggHead @nytimes Well, considering the case was decided in favor of legal protections for a protected class, and that no one was ever targeting the rights of women specifically in this case, there isn't any discrimination happening lol
How dare @kaitlancollins mildly challenge Trump on a pressing news issue? It breaches decorum, and it wasn't POLITE! 		On an unrelated note, I can't wait to see Trump bully her with some mean tweets!
@Taniel @benshapiro Good! Now he can set all his focus and energy on losing another Presidential primary.
@nytimes I mean, of course. Sexual orientation is a protected class you can't discriminate against. Regardless of what you think of the lifestyle this is a basic, settled constitutional issue.
@SenatorHeitkamp Then I sincerely hope you're advocating for the single payer system the rest of the world enjoys, Senator. We can't afford wishy-washy right wing Heritage Foundation plans like the ACA anymore, we just can't. This is supported by the majority of Americans.
@GovMikeHuckabee Jesus was basically a radical socialist. Does that make you a fake Christian?

@davidhogg111 Let's compromise, David. They're illegal human alien undocumented immigrant beings.		...Never mind, your idea's better.
@GOP Well, that's a shame, considering you guys literally stole Gorsuch's Supreme Court seat from Garland. The fact nothing's been done about this at all is just astounding.
@DineshDSouza Who is the president that's buddy-buddy with president Duterte and gave Kim Jong Un a verbal blowjob for a whole day on live television? 		By all indications it appears Trump would love to have their absolute tight-fisted power over the people.
@TomiLahren Mainstream media in't left wing at all. They're center-right corporatist war hawks on a good day.		Donald Trump has a low approval rating and a high disapproval rating. Every time I casually mention Trump 80% of the time the first thing I hear is "He's a fucking idiot".
@RealCandaceO Oh look, a climate change denier bashing education. SHOCKING		P.S.: Do you even know what fascism is? You LITERALLY support a fascist president. "Fascist" isn't just some "gotcha" pejorative, it's a word with an actual definition.
@DineshDSouza Yes, because illegal immigrants can't vote and Americans agree with progressives 60% on average on 90% of the issues, you shameless revisionist "historian".
@PeteHegseth Good thing this guy represents every single possible aspect of an entire political ideology.		I get random insults like this from anonymous conservatives all the time, get over yourself.
@charliekirk11 Nixon's racially motivated drug war broke up black families at an unprecedented rate and is essentially the reason they are disproportionately jailed and living in a less advantageous economic state.		The republican party of today isn't Lincoln's party. It's not even Reagan's FFS
@charliekirk11 Because the legal system doesn't define science, and republicans pushed that law through for political purposes...?
@charliekirk11 Here in Wisconsin, it usually is. Unrelated, Illegal immigrants can't vote.
@charliekirk11 If you're an idiot, does Scandinavia just not exist?
@charliekirk11 He actually did do something.		He launched an investigation involving Trump starring James Comey.		And then Trump fired James Comey while complaaining Obama did nothing to fix the situation.		And then you started sucking Trump's dick.
@ReaderAdrift @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley @NYWFP I'm glad that you want to fight the republicans; I do too. But it's important to remember that it's just as, if not more important, to fight the republican influence within your own party.		Basically, a house divided against itself cannot stand. We must stay progressive.
@realDonaldTrump The anthem is only played at games due to a government contract the NFL has with the Pentagon, making it a clear free speech issue, and the fact that you as the president of the United States openly advocate this restriction of free speech is a SERIOUS legal issue, idiot.
@ReaderAdrift @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley @NYWFP These are cut and dry issues. They don't disagree with Republicans, they just disagree on how conservative we should be as a nation. Empty identity politic lip service and no action (again, why not end this racist drug war?) doesn't make them much different from republicans.
@ReaderAdrift @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley @NYWFP This isn't some petty disagreement over minor policy issues. This is black-and-white policy difference.		We support Single Payer, ending the wars, and the drug war, a living wage tied to inflation, major infrastructure funds, military cuts, money out of politics, etc, they don't.
@ReaderAdrift @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley @NYWFP It's not about being "my kind" of Dem, it's about not being liberals. They are conservative Democrats, therefore they may as well be Republicans. Hence the term Republicrats.		As a woman of color you should be disgusted they've done nothing about Nixon's racist drug war.
@SteveKingIA @DiamondandSilk Breaking: Known White Supremacist Sympathizer Stages Photo-Op with Black Women
@seanmdav Not only does this post start with an ad hominem, it ignores the fact that you can still follow proper FBI procedure while acknowledging the president is in fact an f'ing idiot.
@ReaderAdrift @Ocasio2018 @repjoecrowley @NYWFP But that's exactly the problem, Reader. You can't unite a progressive party with people who genuinely have Republican-lite policy ideas and talking points. Calling them Republicrats is just... accurate. We're going to vote them out and provide the platform most Americans support.
@RealCandaceO Then as a black woman, perhaps you should stop supporting the party that started and continues to perpetuate a racially motivated Drug War that systematically tears apart black families, leaving them so economically disadvantaged many still need food stamps after working 40 hours
@Surabees @realDonaldTrump Progressive taxation is about taxing the rich their fair share, not "all Americans". Your choice of words is incredibly transparent.		The only progressive tax hike I've heard recently was for Bernie's healthcare plan, which net saves Americans money on insurance bills.
@RealCandaceO Actually, it's a majority of Americans that disapprove of him and this was no more true than at the very start of his campaign, before the media took him seriously enough to sink their teeth in.		Also, a climate change denier talking brainwashing? That's just adorable.

@JudicialWatch Uh, this ruling pretty clearly violates Constitutional law. Ever read the first amendment? We know from Trump's own words he intended this to be a Muslim ban. Clear discrimination. Adding NK and Venezuela doesn't magically change his intentions.
@NancyPelosi Maybe instead of virtue signaling with children you should fight for the Single Payer system the rest of the civilized world enjoys greatly. If you can't take the progressive stance on healthcare your words are empty and your congressional seat is worthless, Nancy.
@DailyCaller Study: Global Warming and Jaw Dropping Income Inequality is Depressing
@charliekirk11 The more you love a politician just because the other party hates him the more you sound like a vapid partisan hack you Ben Shapiro wannabe
@JudicialWatch What is there to investigate? She only said to confront your public representatives and give them a piece of your mind. Are ideas violent? None of her words directly explicitly called for violence whatsoever. Stop being such snowflakes.
@SarahPalinUSA Hey Sarah, why can't we enjoy a single payer or medicare for all system the rest of the civilized world enjoys? They pay less money for better outcomes. Medical bankruptcy literally isn't a thing in these countries. Even the majority of your republican voters support this, eh?
@IsraelUSAforevr @DineshDSouza @kwilli1046 @RealMAGASteve @CollinRugg @phil200269 @AMErikaNGIRLBOT @John_KissMyBot @SiddonsDan @StacyLStiles @1Romans58 @charliekirk11 Obama repeatedly called out radical Islamic terrorists, yes, using that terminology, so your premise is wrong. Less than 5 minutes and a quick Google search proves you completely wrong.		He also repeatedly bombed the shit out radical Islamic terrorists, so there's that.
@charliekirk11 There are only two sexes, not two genders.	You pretend to praise science yet scream from the rooftops denying Climate Change. Where are your paychecks coming from?	Marxism has nothing to do with gender identity.		You're a half-rate caricature of a young republican.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Half of American people are living in or near poverty.	Wages are abysmally low, to the point where the majority of welfare recipients are 9-5 working class folks.	Irresponsible trade policy is pounding the rust belt.		Trump hasn't even passed much economic legislation #FFS.
@BonitaApplebau5 @FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters One source would be https://t.co/aWirkYyL3I, where millions of people submit their views. It's not a .org source, so it's less reliable, but Pew Research is and reflects similar trends. The only major issues I can think of where conservatives win is death penalty and immigration.
@FoxNewsInsider @JesseBWatters Ocasio-Cortez's platform is supported on average by 60% of Americans, on basically every issue in the polls. Her platform is very similar to Bernie Sander's, currently the nation's most popular politician according to the polls. Dems are shedding membership over neoliberals.
@SteveKingIA And if anybody knows what's nuts, it's a dude who retweets neo-nazis.

@foxandfriends @RealCandaceO And you act as a mega phone for climate change denial, I'll give Hollywood a pass thank you.
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren @foxandfriends FUCK. Transparent politicians? IT'S MADNESS
@DailyCaller This is the best picture of Sarah Huckabee Sanders ever.
@RealCandaceO @KamalaHarris If you had a shred of integrity maybe you'd understand how much this makes you look like a hypocrite. You blindly support the President that made murdering innocent Middle-Eastern families a campaign promise.		Trump's drones tear children limb from limb. Daily.
@newtgingrich @POTUS Do you think it's clever pretending that their are only two possible conclusions to any given situation and one of them has to be a generically radical strawman argument?		Most of your twitter followers are paid fake accounts. Stop talking to yourself.
@AP Dick move.
@NomikiKonst Who do you have to bribe to get money out of politics around here?
@KyleKulinski @YouTube Is that why the vast majority of the rest of the first world considers us weak-sauce and 90% of our policy issues poll around 60% with Americans?		Even Shapiro is better than this.
@EmmaVigeland Guys, can we reschedule the Democraticommunist Uprising™ until the 5th? I've got a hair appointment on Wednesday and I don't wanna miss it.
@KamalaHarris Kamala; please make the legalization of marijuana a larger part of your platform. The racist Nixonian drug war is what gives these cartels power, rips black American families apart, and keeps our prisons bloated.		Easily among the top 5 biggest issues nationally. Be that voice.
@DineshDSouza Uh, Lincoln was a very racially nuanced figure Dinesh. He considered blacks inferior (white supremacy) while acknowledging their enslavement was cruel and undeserved.		Kinda like how Trump can still be a bigot and have black friends.
@charliekirk11 Hey slapstick, The fact that 1 obnoxious SJW said ignorant, racist junk doesn't mean "white privilege is a lie". Not a logical connection.		You will never be murdered by police.	Your job application will never be denied for having a black sounding name.	That's white priviledge.
Thank you @Ocasio2018. Your words and your movement has been so inspirational for the cause of ending political bribery. 		Seeing you win this nomination (and let's be honest, the congressional seat) was such a relief after so much disappointment.		A movement? No, a #revolution! https://t.co/dGj1MdgUGC
@DineshDSouza That's not true. Currently we can't pardon felons after they admit to knowingly committing campaign finance fraud in order to bribe politicians and trash democracy.		...Awe, too soon D'Souza?
TL;DR:	Conservative Christians are hypocrites full of shit.		(10/10)
I'm the son of a pastor, I've read the Bible front to back, and have written an extensive unpublished book on 1st-3rd century Christian doctrine. I think I know what I'm talking about.		(9/10)
4th, note there are many parts of the Bible where God installs vicious leaders as means of punishing people. Next time someone says Trump's makeshift-orphanages are great 'cuz "Presidents are picked by God", remind them that God's mandates aren't all sunshine &amp; rainbows.		(8/10)
...Not to mention the fact that, based on the Greek language, Romans 13 may very well be about church leaders rather than government officials.		(7/10)
3rd, this invocation of Romans 13 that you should "obey the law because government officials are appointed by God" coming from Elf Sessions and Sarah Trollabee Sanders is a joke. The book of Acts (5:29) clearly says that God's law overrides man's. Cue the 10 verses above.		(6/10)
This list doesn't even include a wide variety of more vague verses that can be used implicitly to support immigrants, such as "Love thy neighbor" etc. Not to mention the verses that say you shouldn't mistreat children.		(5/10)
Said verses are listed here for your convenience.	Leviticus 19:33-34	Matthew 25:35	Exodus 22:21	Malachi 3:5	Deuteronomy 27:19	Zechariah 7:9-10	Jeremiah 7:5-7	Ezekiel 47:22	Hebrews 13:2	Deuteronomy 10:18		(4/10)
2nd, the Bible is incredibly consistent on moral guidelines for treating foreigners. There are 10 verses sprinkled throughout the Old and New Testament that explicitly demand us to treat foreigners no differently than you would a native citizen, or your very own brother.		(3/10)
In the first place, religion isn't supposed to dictate how our government operates, so there's that.		(2/10)
It's absolutely disgusting watching Jeff Sessions the Keebler elf and Sarah Huckabee "Troll Under the Bridge" Sanders using the Bible to justify ripping migrant children from their refugee parents. It's reprehensible on so many levels.		(1/10)
@BabySaby @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump My political ideology supports the empowerment of blacks, the abolition of the black prison industrial complex brought about by a racist drug war, the humanization of Hispanic refugees harmed by our same drug war, and religious freedom for Muslims.		So thanks for making shit up.
@piratefoxy @discotron @nodavesclub @BenDavi53856005 @jortle @BernieSanders @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi Cuts in individual med. costs negates the rise in taxes and she, like Bernie, will hammer away at that point. 		It's not hard to convince an 80-20 (Democratic favor) district that the superior healthcare system the rest of the world enjoys is good. Already polls 60%+ nationwide.
@nodavesclub @BenDavi53856005 @jortle @BernieSanders @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi Thank you for the support. Justice Democrats has repeatedly stated anyone fighting for the cause of ripping bribe money from politics is an ally, regardless of the worthless letter next to their name.		Politics isn't sports. This isn't childish some "raw-raw go team" bullshit!
@BenDavi53856005 @nodavesclub @jortle @BernieSanders @Ocasio2018 @NancyPelosi Thing is, Democrats will fall in line with the Liberals. They're a robotic party loyalist voter block, they're not as stubborn about policy as the real Liberals. It's the Democrats who can't win without the Liberals and Hillary is proof of that.

@CandiMathis @BernieSanders @Ocasio2018 The fuck is wrong with you? We nominate an actual progressive guaranteed to win a Dem seat in congress, &amp; you want to shame Bernie for his support?

@FDRLST It's a Muslim ban, not a travel ban. Trump's own words.		It's clear violation of 1st amendment protections from religious discrimination. The religious are a Protected Class in civil law. Doesn't have to be about race, another Protected Class, to be unconstitutional or bigoted.
@BabySaby @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump I guarantee you more people would have been murdered in there home country had they not fled to safety here. American lives aren't worth more than others.		I agree we need borders. We can do that without demonizing brown people and breaking apart refugee families.
@FDRLST Bigots and Fascists are not protected classes under Civil Law. You can't deny a gay person service for the same reason you can't deny it to blacks: because they're born that way, it's out of their control. Sanders can stop lying for the administration anytime she likes.
@AnnCoulter Nothing in this story says anything about being the suspects being DREAMERS. You're such a lying sack of shit.
@charliekirk11 Those Southern Dixiecrats switched parties after the Civil Rights Act passed. This is well known history supported by electoral map data. Currently, the KKK, Neo-Nazis, and various white supremacist groups are in full support of Donald Trump.		Context is a thing, dude.
@IngrahamAngle Triggered?
@DLoesch @JohnZajaros I love how exposing your children to the consequence and reality of bad policy is magically worse than supporting political policies that pile up dead children like a morbid game of pick up sticks.		Quit your pearl clutching.
@TimRunsHisMouth Sure. Let's start with Trump's salary, considering he repeatedly told people at his rallies to literally assault protesters.
@charliekirk11 Because the majority of illegals come in via airplane and there aren't waves of South Americans trying to break into gated communities you sniveling bootlicker.
@SAM010211 @AnnCoulter Violent criminals are sickening regardless of their skin color or heritage. Nothing you said detracts from that fact or anything said in my initial argument.
@AnnCoulter Anecdotal evidence is cute and all, but statistics suggest immigrants, legal and illegal, commit crimes at the same or less a rate than American citizens. It doesn't matter if they're immigrants, you're just a xenophobic cunt.		Btw these men weren't DREAMERS you spineless liar.
@777rada50023 @charliekirk11 I absolutely love it when you Trump supporters use the term "snowflake". Donald Trump is the most obnoxiously whiny snowflake there is.		" Waaah, waaah, why won't duh fake news media weave me awone? :'((( "
@Bf109G12 @blstiebeling @charliekirk11 There's no scientific consensus as to when life starts or personhood is achieved, period. 		Latin linguistics has absolutely nothing to do with scientific consensus. 		Until a fetus achieves personhood, something for which there is no agreed upon standard, the hand analogy works.
@TPUSA I wholeheartedly agree we need to shrink the size of government. Let's start by ending the drug war, freeing all non-violent offenders from prison, letting brown children out of their cages and cutting the military budget in half.
@777rada50023 @charliekirk11 OH SHIT THAT'S TOO DAMN CLEVER GUYS CHECK OUT THIS SUPER CLEVER DUDE I FOUND LIKE HOLY SHIT HE'S SO FUCKING ORIGINAL IT MAKES ME WANT TO SHIT ALL OVER HIS BRILLIANT FUCKING FACE CHRIST ALIVE THIS GUY IS GOOD LIKE SERIOUSLY GODDAMN HE SURE SHOWED ME
@Bf109G12 @blstiebeling @charliekirk11 Whether or not a fetus is human has no bearing on whether or not it's a conscious living person as opposed to a mass of cells. My opinion was when a fetus is in the womb and viable it has personhood, not just outside. But again, my opinions don't change science; that's the point.
@Bf109G12 @blstiebeling @charliekirk11 Actually my hand is the result of reproductive action, the potential to be human does not make said thing anything but a fetus, and some fetuses actually don't have unique DNA in rare occurrences. Point is, there's no scientific consensus on when life begins. Who's illiterate?
@SpeakerRyan Unemployment has been on a steady decline since the end of Obama's term.		The tax bill hasn't been on the books long enough to have big economic effects and you know it. Reaganomics creates growth bubbles which pop shortly after. See 2008 recession.
@AnnCoulter Damn, Coulter backing socialist spending policy. Can't wait for your Bernie endorsement.
@ScottSakatch @CNN Which is what made the primary so frustrating. Bernie was packing massive stadiums with people lined up outside the venue when Hillary had trouble filling mere classrooms. Ironically, Republican primaries are more Democratic.
@SpeakerRyan @GeorgeHWBush Yeah but doesn't he grope women?
Woah, Ben Shapiro getting something right.		Hey, I can be fair. https://t.co/vTZw61GJec
@CNN Yeah but doesn't he grope women?
@charliekirk11 I agree, partisan hackery like this is gross.		I don't remember you crying over Trump ruining the historic Iran Deal.
@LisaPrealestate @CNN I know. Buying the entire DNC and giving them orders behind the scenes to stop Bernie at every turn? Talk about brazen corruption.
@ScottSakatch @CNN Plus with Bernie as the nominee I guarantee you young people will show up, the reason many of us (unfortunately) don't vote has everything to do with who the nominee is.
@ScottSakatch @CNN That's not true. Compared to the rest of the industrialized world, Bernie Sanders is a known moderate, almost weak-sauce liberal by comparison. Your point about the youth vote is valid but it's not enough to crush a 10-15 pt. lead, which are historic numbers.
@ScottSakatch @CNN (3) -do independent research. Plus, the context has changed; after Hillary's massive loss I think a ton of Democrats learned their lesson. If Dems think he's too radical, why do most people around the country hold his views above 50% approval? Bernie's an FDR style liberal.
@ScottSakatch @CNN (2) What card carrying Dems believed was he was the weaker candidate, not that he was too radical, and on both counts they're simply wrong. Corporate media just dishonestly shoved the narrative down our throats and people buy it because they're too tired at the end of the day to-
@ScottSakatch @CNN (1) Pop "most popular politician in America" into Google, you'll find several sources there. The Democratic primary isn't even democratic. It shuts out independents (who deserve representation, mind you) and was essentially bought by Clinton according to the Brazil Memo.
@FoxBusiness Doesn't he grope women?
@ScottSakatch @CNN ...The nation's most consistently popularly ranked politician with a 10%-15% lead on Trump (minimum!) is magically not viable? 		If you don't like Bernie that's fine, just don't lie about it.
@CNN Can we all stop pretending it's worth it to get in Bernie's way?
This Republican hypocrisy  is deafening on the NK peace summit.		They say "these peace talks are so historic, you liberals should stop ypur partisan complaining!" And you know what? They're right.		Now, can somebody remind me what their attitude on the historic Iran Deal was?
@marcorubio @POTUS So, you're saying him and Trump have a lot in common.

This is so important. A ton of people voted for Trump because they fell for the lie that he was some sort of populist. They had good intentions but made the wrong decisions.		Shaming them for wanting something better in a corrupted world only rids of us unwitting allies. https://t.co/KSkxBoyhmV
@DLoesch I'm so sick of conservative pundits pretending to be #Christian when #Jesus was clearly one of history's first recorded radical socialist thinkers and the Old Testament Jews were taught to spread the wealth liberally.		FFS the dude's to the left of me.

@FoxNews @AndrewPollackFL Well, thank God his daughter's not a diploma. That would just be weird.
Complaining about Trump is easy. It's time to stop beating around the bush and start focusing on tackling the turn-coat conservative Democrats in power.		If you don't take the right medicine bitching about the disease will never cure you.

@SpeakerRyan Unemployment's been dropping since the end of the #Obama administration. Yall ignored it 4 political reasons.		Don't brag about wage increases when u directly oppose guaranteed living wages for full time MW workers.		Economic FX of presidencies aren't felt for years. Not Trump.
@charliekirk11 The Taliban sucks, to be clear. But the only reason we kill them is because they want to eliminate the Opium trade we profit directly from. US Intelligence protects profit and doesn't give a damn about human rights. If they did we'd be knee deep in Israeli/Saudi occupation.
@charliekirk11 And Trump wants to weaponize the legal system to make libel laws broader because he himself wants to corrupt government to punish those he doesn't like. Kind of a Trump trademark. Be consistent you sniveling hack.
@charliekirk11 Spies infiltrate foreign governments, not their own. Trump likely launders Russian money, making potential conflict of interest a national security issue. Hence the informant.		By your logic Obama approved the investigation on Hillary. Your narrative falls apart.

Roseanne said some dumb racist shit that ruined her life. Dinesh helped fund politics that ruins tons of people's lives. U Tell me what's worse.
@SarahKSilverman People need to stop losing their fucking minds over social decorum and get legitimately outraged over policy/actions that ruins people's lives.		I don't care that Trump said the word pussy, I care about the fact he bragged on tape about sexually assaulting women.

@ananavarro Nooo, Trump bragged on tape about sexually assaulting women and admitted proudly on Howard Stern's show he would creep in the dressing rooms at his pageants to "eye the merchandise", which is a sex crime.		Sam B called someone a cunt, she didn't finger fuck one without consent.
Why did the chicken cross the road?		Because half the country is living in poverty most of our tax dollars go toward the illegal genocide of foreigners in resource rich nations and the #1 source of bankruptcy is medical bills.		(The other side is Canada.) https://t.co/qTXcvg18F0

@charliekirk11 When conservative legislation passes on issues like healthcare, civil rights, incessant warmongering, work place rights, income inequality, and the prison industrial complex fueled by a racist drug war, entire lives are ruined.		Spare me your empty words you privileged victim.

@charliekirk11 You're misrepresenting the situation. An edit-vandal put Nazism on Wikipedia for a day and Google takes their result from Wikipedia. Stop whining about a momentarily failed algorithm. And not the R's are Nazis, but they are right-wing.		Google is literally a 2018 CPAC sponsor.
@dmnejus @WhiteHouse OK, sure. Doesn't really counter my argument though.
Ivanka Trump is not a feckless cunt. She's to feckless to be a cunt.
@WhiteHouse Illegal immigrants are known to commit less crimes than the average American citizen, logically out of fear of deportation.		But never mind how ICE under Trump is ripping families apart on a daily basis, consistency hurts my brain parts.

@charliekirk11 Did you know:		There's literally almost no evidence of widespread voter fraud? Every election cycle there are around four reported cases on average and most of the time it's by Republicans saying they're "fighting voter fraud".		Voter suppression is great for Republicans.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 Whether or not random pregnant women you know refer to their fetuses as babies has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that fetuses and babies are categorically different.		Your argument is equivalent to, "Well, my friend says that mushrooms are frogs so it must be true."
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 Exactly, and you told me to name "one thing". I named three, you resisted, and suddenly now you admit those three things ARE family planning measures. A fetus is not a baby.		If women want other services they can go to the other healthcare providers you mention. Case closed.
@Chief_Wildcat @charliekirk11 Because the coasts and major cities have more people you genius. Do you know what Democracy means? It means when more people want something, they get it. Trump's victory mocks Democracy.
This problem isn't just in Flint either. https://t.co/i1AlX573Sf
@Chief_Wildcat @charliekirk11 Yeah man, fuck Democracy, right? The American peasants don't know what's good for them.
@brrrr_blake @charliekirk11 ...And gets beaten in the popular vote. Meaning his campaign was a train wreck loss and the country didn't want him. Undemocratic electoral colleges be damned.		Trump is just as corrupt and Hillary is not "polished", she sucks at messaging too.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 What you're doing is called "moving the goal post". When I tell you pregnancy screening and contraceptive access are fundamental parts of family planning, you just say "OH YEAH WELL WHAT ABOUT AFTER THAT." You're not as clever as you think you are.
@charliekirk11 I think it's fair to attack the powerful for skirting the rule of law.		I think doing so makes you a fucking hypocrite because you endorsed "Bloody" Gina Haspel, well known illegally sadistic cunt and war criminal, to head the CIA.		Consistency on principle is a thing, y'know.
@charliekirk11 Speaking as a liberal who doesn't buy the Russia hype, no, that's not what it means.		It means the FBI had an informant, which sounds to me like standard procedure, in the president's campaign, while investigating him on possible Russian collusion etc.		Just stayin' real here.
@charliekirk11 Trump 2016 Summary:		Loses by AT LEAST 10 points to countrys most popular politician, Dem Socialist Bernie Sanders accrdng 2 literally every poll, virtual landslide.		Possible 15 pt. max. loss against same matchup, a HISTORIC landslide.		Loses popular vote to unpopular Clinton.
@HondaDriver13 @charliekirk11 Thank God, I forgot to get your sister a gift on Mother's Day.
@BerniceKing @People4Bernie #MLK had radically leftist economic ideas and would despise Trump's catering to the rich and neglect of the poor. The notion MLK would support a man who called Neo-Nazis good people is laughable.

@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 Referral to other locations for mammograms is still a medical service related to cancer. They help people get mammograms.		I've read the 3% counterargument and it's garbage. Totally disregards how math works and pretends STI testing etc. is somehow "less" a service than abortion.
@HondaDriver13 @charliekirk11 I know, you're proof of that.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 Pregnancy screening contraceptive access and reproductive health coverage are all vital to planning parenthood, the fuck are you talking about dude?
@pixelprotectors @marcmkkoy @charliekirk11 Hebrew term "thigh" is common Biblical euphemism 4 womb. Suspicious pregnancy leading 2 accusation of adultery is logical.		When translating dead language hardly anythings explicit. Ur wrong to say the abortion translation isnt possible, its on the table whether u like it or not.

@marcorubio This verse says when you die the former glory of your riches uselessly crumbles away. The #Bible repeatedly condemns the pursuit of riches as futile and wasteful. Christ's Parable of the Rich Fool: Luke 12:13-21
@marcorubio Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. - Luke 12:33
@marcorubio No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. -Matthew 6:24
@marcorubio Pslam 49: 18-20 Though while they live they count themselves blessed, and people praise you when you prosper, they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life. People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.
@charliekirk11 Whether Trump was being tapped was not disputed, the conspiracy was that Obama called the order, and at that time there wasn't any proof.
@SpeakerRyan Reconnecting with your faith begins by reading your #Bible and understanding Biblical politics. #Jesus and the Old Testament Jews held beliefs wholly antithetical to your extremist Ayn Rand platform. Ezekiel 16:49
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 My apologies, I forgot to mention that I also called you an "idiot" and a "moron" in an earlier thread. So "dude" was not the only name given.		It's just that your other points were so predictably forgettable, it's only natural I didn't remember you.
@MonikaMusing @DLoesch Literally nothing you said supports the concept that defunding women's health operations is a good idea.
@budhigher I agree. Defending one's border is not terrorism.		Shooting unarmed protesters for political reasons is, in fact terrorism.		Notice a theme here?
@budhigher You can't "rush a border" from 700 yards away.	"Boarder" is properly spelled as "Border".		Whether or not you "know what will happen" as an unarmed protester has nothing to do with the fact that said "happening" is a human rights violation.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 I'll let your question speak for itself.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 ...The only thing I called you was "dude".	Fact is pregnancy testing is a service inherent to family planning.	PP offers women contraceptive access and cancer screening.	The whole "selling baby parts" debacle was blown apart when the people involved were arrested for fraud.		dude

@charliekirk11 1st off, cutting aid hurts Mex. citizens, creating incentive to move here. 2nd Mexico's government does not "outsource" people. They flee a country torn apart by the brutal American drug war that gives the cartel's all their power. Your president's racist AG is amping up that war
@tundrawolfqueen @SenFeinstein Senator #DiFi resists the #SinglePayer system most other developed nations enjoy in favor of defending Obamacare, a tweaked adaptation of the right wing Heritage Foundation plan supported by Nixon and implemented by Romney.

@Lisa_L_Reynolds @artyvanguard @DLoesch Compared to the vast majority of countless other medical procedures conducted in America over the last 40-50 years(?), I daresay it is based on your very own numbers.
@JayKincaid24 @charliekirk11 Again, I'm talking about the scientific definition of when life begins, and you insist on jamming arbitrary legal decisions about murder into that conversation.		By your own standard Roe vs. Wade contradicts/overrides these homicide laws thereby making your position inconsistent.
@baseball_busy @DLoesch There're 2 distinct types of medical death (1 being brain-dead) and 3 main conditions tied to medical death: loss of 1) circulation 2) respiration &amp; 3) cerebral function.		Fetuses don't respire in the womb. Not even saying it's not life, I'm saying it's scientifically undecided.
@HondaDriver13 @charliekirk11 Well, I can say firsthand as a former fetus that I personally remember not being sentient, mainly because I don't remember a damn thing from then.		That's a relief, because most people think I'm smarter than I actually am.
@pixelprotectors @marcmkkoy @charliekirk11 Woah woah woah, hold on a second.		Based on the Hebrew language used in this verse the abortionist-interpretation of Numbers 5 is certainly on the table. One of many possibilities, and definitely fits the context.		Same applies to Exodus 21:22-23.
@blstiebeling @charliekirk11 For conservation efforts. A bird would never even need an abortion ya genius.		And in any case, legal definitions and scientific definitions are two completely different things, and using bird-law to defend yourself means nothing because Roe vs. Wade is a thing.
@budhigher I agree, their're Palestinian suicide bombers. Hamas is a terrorist group.		Doesn't change the fact shooting unarmed protesters is a human rights violation. When Israel causes violence for a political cause they are ipso-facto committing terrorism.		Get it now?
@lakeemmarose @LouDobbs If you're principled on taking away press credentials over media based lies, based on the sheer numbers you have to start with FOX. Trump loves FOX because they wipe his ass. He only cares about stifling dissent, not truth. Trump is a well documented pathological liar, too.
@lakeemmarose @KulcsarBarnabas @LouDobbs I actually agree, they have selective reporting. MSNBC's president fired Ed Schultz for covering Bernie Sanders. Every major station clamors for war, a right wing position, and dissenters are fired. Reports on economic inequality are rare or framed from conservative angles.
@budhigher A) You can't assume every Palestinian has taken such a vow. 	B) We know many protesters killed were unarmed, which is a human rights violation. 	C) Whether or not any Palestinians took such a vow has no bearing on whether shooting unarmed protesters is a human rights violation.
@charliekirk11 You're not a medical health professional.		A beating heart does not define life or personhood.		Abortion is often used to save women's lives.		Abortion by definition controls birth.		Murder is illegal and abortion is legally protected by Roe vs. Wade.
@LouDobbs @AmbJohnBolton China, North Korea, and the Left Wing "fear" Bolton because he's an unashamed warhawk clattering the drums for war and endless occupation.		Last night you complained about the deep state. Now you're shilling for deep state military industrial complex. How principled oy you.
@JayKincaid24 @charliekirk11 Because scientific definitions and legal ones are completely different and ridding a woman of her pregnancy without consent is a very real form of assault.
@pixelprotectors @charliekirk11 I've personally assessed the hit-piece articles you mention beforehand. That's not "off the bat" dismissal and I even bothered to explain why I dismissed them, so painting this as some sort of non-substantive criticism is unwarranted, friend.
@blstiebeling @charliekirk11 I am personally of the opinion that a fetus has personhood when it can survive outside of the womb. I do not support late-term abortion. So these pictures don't affect me.		My personal opinion also has no bearing on the undecided medical consensus of personhood.
@gdub1791 @charliekirk11 Man you're ignorant.		The "Global Cooling" myth is based off ONE study from the 80's that was immediately torn apart by the scientific community, or CONSENSUS. Global warming contributes to global climate change, and said warming is man-made according to that same consensus.
@pixelprotectors @charliekirk11 (2/2)		I've read the articles you're talking about and they're hilariously full of shit. The only point they make is that getting an ultrasound or seeking contraceptive services shouldn't be weighed as heavily as an abortion. Not how math works.		And no, they don't.
@pixelprotectors @charliekirk11 (1/2)		1. That's the point. In a philosophical sense it's subjective and in a legal sense it's protected by the supreme court so calling abortion "murder" is plain dishonest.		2. I am the son of a pastor and unpublished theological author specializing in doctrinal apologetics.
@budhigher It is wrong to use human shields.		It is wrong to kill unarmed protesters.		Is there something you're not getting here?
@artyvanguard @DLoesch Science is ruled by a series of collected data points that come together to form theories, the legitimacy of which are ultimately ruled on by something called SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS, which is further supported by observational proof. Medicine is tied to science.		fuck you're dense
@RyanCro63860784 @charliekirk11 ...I literally just told you I prefer the scientific definition to the arbitrary legal one established by partisan, anti-science Republicans in 2004.		I don't think "like it both ways" means what you think it means.
@budhigher All I said was Israeli border officials have been caught on tape sniping unarmed Palestinians miles from the border, a clear human rights violation.		Literally nothing you have said changes or even begins to dispute that fact.
@budhigher Burning tires 700 yards from the border is not a capitol crime. You can't cut a fence from 700 yards away. I doubt a burning kite could fly the length of 7 football fields without burning up.		I speak of innocents 700 yards away getting shot. Not protesters at the border.
@charliekirk11 That's some pretty fancy fake concern you got there Charlie. Too bad Republicans constantly seek to defund education in lieu of tax cuts and bloated military spending.		Meanwhile significant military cuts could properly fund education, for college and formative years. Oops!
@artyvanguard @DLoesch Each service I listed does not overlap.		Abortion is a rare procedure and PP is famous for providing it. Therefore while abortion is only 3% of services conducted 30% nationwide is not shocking.		Glad to know you preach medical ethics without caring for medical consensus.
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Yes, the most pro-life president in history escalated Obama's drone program, already at times with a 90% civilian casualty rate, by 400%, with the added directive that even more civilian deaths are allowed than ever before.		Go dunk your head in a bucket of stale puss, Pence.
@artyvanguard @DLoesch The issue is not "procedures". It's services. And no, it's not as small as "taking one's temperature". It's pregnancy screenings, cancer screenings, contraceptive access, general women's health services, etc., all valid services that should be counted.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 1. Their stated mission is not post-planning coverage. They Plan Parenthoods, idiot.	2. Money circulating over "baby parts" is well known to have only covered simple handling and shipping fees common in industry, moron. 	3. PP is non-profit, it doesn't fucking generate income.
@WorksInHerPJs @DLoesch Can you clarify?
@DemocratsArePoo @charliekirk11 Your constitutional right to gun ownership does not in any way demand tax dollars. Ongoing healthcare treatment for women does.		The fact is nobody should be donating to any party and all campaigns should be publicly funded by tax dollars, not influential bribery "donations".
@DLoesch Those tax dollars fund 97% of PP's healthcare services, excluding abortion. Abortion IS healthcare in common circumstances involving maternal death or birth defects. There is no medical consensus that terminating a fetus "ends a life" or that fetuses are conscious living persons.
@charliekirk11 Did you know:		This year's bloated increase to the military budget could have funded @BernieSanders plan to cover public college tuition for every single student in the nation?		Quit with your fake concern.
@LouDobbs Does it honestly surprise anyone that the federal government has a vested investigative interest in any person running to become the leader of the country, specifically for the sake of national security? Sounds like pretty standard shit to me.
@budhigher Yes, Terrorists are not innocent civilians.	Coming unarmed 700 yards from the Israeli border is not an act of terrorism.	Therefore, the murder victims I speak of are not terrorists, but civilians.	Bringing children to a protest doesn't magically negate human rights violations.
@AtlasKey That's the whole point. There IS no medical consensus that the fetus has a conscious life because what is and is not consciousness or life or being or the soul or what have you is an abstract construct not medically defined. Therefore, no scientific consensus on when life starts.
@AtlasKey Whether or not it's the standard is wholly irrelevant to whether or not it's biological possible thereby rendering your claim that two sets of DNA automatically constitutes two separate entities null and void.
@DemocratsArePoo @charliekirk11 Planned Parenthood clinics cannot contribute to government officials, only their affiliates can. Supposing your logic is sound and government money indirectly funds abortions: Abortion is a legally, constitutionally respected medical health treatment. Bam, no legal scandal.
@RyanCro63860784 @charliekirk11 Because legal definitions and scientific definitions are separate issues and Republican legislators like those who passed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act are not particularly famous for respecting scientific principles or practices.		TL;DR	Congress says pizza is a vegetable.
@AtlasKey Having dual DNA is real and called Chimerism. If it's medically possible and has occurred bringing it into the discussion doesn't help you.
@AtlasKey There is circulation and direct biological attachment to the mother during pregnancy, so it's not separate. What's "living tissue" and when "conscious life" begins are two different discussions. The abortion issue is the latter. Since it's medically undefinable, no consensus.
@WightRat @Livingburntout @Daniel_Noah1 @blstiebeling @charliekirk11 Fair enough. To answer your question: Negatively.
@AtlasKey "No consensus it's a separate living creature to be killed" was the proper phrasing, to be clear. You're right, that it's living tissue is not disputed. Changes absolutely nothing about the strength of your analogy because you can kill living tissue without killing a person.
@Ladydrgnfly65 @charliekirk11 I agree, some don't value life. A fine example: the sitting U.S. president, who has escalated a drone program with a 90% civilian casualty rate by 400%, with the added order to allow even more civilian casualties than before.		Think of all the poor fetuses Trump has bombed.
@budhigher Sniping innocent civilians 7 football fields from the crossing zone is not defense. Generally, gunning down the unarmed isn't. Someone missed last week's news. 		Criticizing Israel's human rights violations is not a defense of Hamas' human rights violations. Make sense?
@FreshJaruB @charliekirk11 I actually completely understood how you were trying to manipulate the language to make a specious point. Taxpayer money should most definitely be going towards providing women with healthcare services. Abortion is a legally respected healthcare service too, pal. Sorry.
@Mickey37478936 @charliekirk11 ...Pregnancy Testing maybe?		The organization's primary function is literally Family Planning, dude.
@jwfolsom @charliekirk11 God knows us even before he created wombs in the first place. This argument means nothing. All the verse says is God knows everything.		Read Exodus 21:22. The punishment for death is death. Punching a woman into miscarriage is punished by fine. Also, Trial of the Bitter Water.
@WightRat @Livingburntout @Daniel_Noah1 @blstiebeling @charliekirk11 It's funny you say that because Roe vs. Wade was once the future and nowadays history generally looks back on the days before abortion in horror of the consequences.		What if the future says it's murder? What if it doesn't? What if your rhetorical questions mean nothing?
@blstiebeling @charliekirk11 By your own logic every time you jack off you've committed literal genocide.
@blstiebeling @charliekirk11 An ultrasound picture shows a mass of cellular tissue which is thoroughly embedded within and as a part of a mother's biological system. 		If you chop off my hand it's not murder, that's how your point is unclear.
@HeidiGe406 @charliekirk11 I don't "choose" to believe medical science is undecided on when or whether a fetus is a living being. That's just the way shit is.		Also, a fetus is not a baby. It's a fetus. Can you show me your medical credentials?
@Ladydrgnfly65 @charliekirk11 That makes it living tissue, not a fully functioning separate entity with full personhood. Are you a medical health professional?		To further complicate things: https://t.co/dtz5WMkVVT
@AtlasKey I don't know, if you make an analogy that ignores the fact there's no medical/scientific consensus as to whether or not a fetus is a living thing which can even be killed do I have to take you seriously?
@FreshJaruB @charliekirk11 ...So in other words, according to the logic of your own analogy, the government doesn't fund abortions, and PP funds it with their own money. 		...Which is exactly what I said.		SpEcTaCuLaR AnAlOgY d00d 10/10 👍
@HondaDriver13 @charliekirk11 A fetus isn't sentient. Therefore it cannot identify as anything.		You're not as clever as you think you are.
@DLoesch 1. I don't mind my tax dollars going towards woman's health.	2. Planned Parenthood is a non-profit organization.	3. Only Planned Parenthood affiliates can make political donations, not clinics.	4. We can protect children AND women's health. Cut the damn military budget.
@charliekirk11 There's no scientific consensus that a fetus constitutes a person prior to viability. And if you want the Biblical angle, Levitican law doesn't recognize a fetus as a living being.		Second, only 3% of PP's operations are abortions, and government funds don't cover them.
@MorriseyWV @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Joe Manchin is literally one of the most conservative neo"liberals" in congress, what the hell are you talking about?
@DLoesch You DO realize that the lack of regulatory measures on gun purchases would cost infinitely more people's lives than your anecdotal story on death-by-bureaucracy?
@AnnCoulter With a staggering approval rating that can't even breach 46%. Oh boy.		Meanwhile every recent poll on the matter has told us the country's most popular politician is a Democratic Socialist whose name rhymes with Shmernie Shmanders. 		I'll let you guess who I mean.
@AnnCoulter Haven't you repeatedly disavowed Trump?
@KulcsarBarnabas @LouDobbs That literally makes no sense because the media doesn't control government and Trump, the face of the government, wants to unilaterally disarm media outlets and keep the ones completely subservient to the state like FOX, which is literally the definition of totalitarianism.
@marcorubio Jon Bolton is known publicly to support the "Libya Model" with North Korea, where we promise not to overthrow the government if they disarm their nuclear arsenal.		Kim Jung Un watched as US backed revolutionaries dragged Gaddafi in the streets and raped him with a metal pipe.
@LouDobbs The very first amendment of the constitution protects the freedom of the press as Trump threatens repeatedly to take away news media credentials over opinion coverage he dislikes.		You feed the deep state.
@DLoesch There is no scientific consensus as to whether or not a fetus is a viable person or not, first off. Levitican Biblical law also treats a fetus as property and not life, if you want the Christian angle.		Disrespectful oral sex is also kind of an oxymoron.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @SecPompeo Putting sanctions on any given country is always a burden on its people and the escalating tensions in the region exacerbated by Trump's emboldening of an Israeli state which repeatedly violates human rights and seeks war with Iran can lead to conflict and bloodshed. Benefits?
@SpeakerRyan @CaseyPrograms Glad to see you spreading awareness for such a good cause Ryan. Now it's time to advocate for letting gay couples take in children when there's such a desperate need for homes, because as you say, we must ensure the safety and success of every child.
@ananavarro And the worst part is Despacito actually hurts the ears.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS All as AG @jeffsessions, a well documented racist, reinvigorates Nixon's unconstitutional war on marijuana that purposely tore apart countless black families and helped balloon the prison population to levels not seen anywhere else in the globe. Great job.
@SenFeinstein #Medicareforall or perhaps #SinglePayer could pave the way for affordable psychological evaluations and drug treatments which also help. This is the default progressive decision and your liberal constituents expect this of you.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS "President Trump to host the NASCAR Cup Series because of-fucking-course he does"
@centerstreet @newtgingrich Amazing! At this rate we'll go from #37 in healthcare quality to #36 in no time!
If the U.S. was consistent on principle in bombing country's like Syria over humanitarian crises like they say, we'd be knee deep in Israeli occupation by next Wednesday.
@charliekirk11 According to Google this is a debunked story from a year ago. Unless you're breaking news.		Conservative activists have no credibility speaking for MLK, a devout and radical Socialist, on anything. You ain't woke.		A Harvard degree can't stop a bullet.
@charliekirk11 -Trump passed virtually no major economic legislation sans the tax bill, and economic legislation of any kind generally takes a year if not years for the effects to be seen		-So you give Obama way more credit than I do
@charliekirk11 The problem with your strawman argument is that the American left wants Democratic Socialism, like in Scandinavia (consistently ranked #1 happiest place on earth). Venezuela is run by Authoritarians.		1 failed socialist experiment vs. 5 incredible successes. Ouch.
@charliekirk11 Yes, because everyone knows brutal torture is one of the core principles of feminism! The Geneva Convention is the real patriarchy!		Yup, nooooo problems here.
