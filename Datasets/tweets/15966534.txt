@_oatc_ @SphincterSpicer @VickerySec @JDWeil55 Can't comment on the UK, but in the US they can mostly only use that pooled DB for political work (and "research" in some states). If the pooled data was used to market anything for a corp. client it would be a violation of most state's laws dictating uses for voter files.
@visionsurreal @thespybrief Most states don't collect email on voter registration forms, so email would not be part of the dataset in most places regardless. A few do collect this optionally, but to my knowledge this isn't passed on in any state to political campaigns/parties.
@visionsurreal @thespybrief Yes, this would be among the worst sins an analytics firm (corporate or political) could commit, and would be very illegal in addition to being an uncontionable breech of trust. This is a question I dearly hope Mueller will answer.
@visionsurreal @thespybrief A good question - the parts of the DB that aren't given to campaigns would contain DL numbers, last 4-digits of SSN, phone numbers in a few places, and exact dates of birth in the states that don't provide it (many states provide DOB but some show YOB, and a few have neither).
@visionsurreal @thespybrief If CA was working for the Trump campaign they could legally obtain that data from the campaign and use it to help that campaign. This is exactly the same as for any other vendor supporting a campaign. It's legal to use voter registration data to support campaigns.
@SphincterSpicer @VickerySec @JDWeil55 Which is to say voter file data, and in most cases derivatives of that data, can't be legally used in corporate ad campaigns. So CA can legally use voter file data to help Trump convince a voter to vote for him, they can't use that same data to convince a voter to buy cat food.
@SphincterSpicer @VickerySec @JDWeil55 A company can take consumer data (ie data typically used to target corporate ads) and combine it with political data from voter files for political communication. They can't use that combined dataset to legally target for marketing (it varies by state how illegal it is).

@NCWineLady @Chkaboom @RogueNASA Lots of people would be better at this job for sure, but in the grand scheme of Trump debacles he's unlikely to destroy anything important.
@NCWineLady @Chkaboom @RogueNASA His policy papers aren't super nuts - he's an administrator not a scientist. He pushes money around, lobbies for funding, and cheerleads.
@NCWineLady @RogueNASA I'd expect most NASA programs will continue (also Congress won't really let Presidents hurt NASA). Ongoing climate missions will continue.
@NCWineLady @RogueNASA He doesn't believe in climate science, but neither would any other candidate from Trump land. He writes relatively often on space policy.
