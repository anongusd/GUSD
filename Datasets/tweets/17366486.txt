The conversation continues today. Our display ends with a pair of yoga pants. Who does the housework in your home? And what do they wear to do it? #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory https://t.co/KetAhCrdLD
In the 1970s, some women campaigned to make their housework visible and paid. Women around the world called for valuing the ‚Äúsecond shift,‚Äù or home and care work performed after leaving the shop floor or the office tower. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory https://t.co/rLcmr1jBto
The 1950s and 1970s saw another surge in the numbers of women working for pay outside the home. Higher education, second-wave feminism, and the economic downturn of the 1970s all led to more women moving into the paid workforce. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory
The government even helped make clothing for housework more readily available. A woman could get the pattern for this simple housedress from the federal government‚Äôs Works Progress Administration and make it herself. She could also get one ready-made through federal assistance. https://t.co/39MW2ThxWh
As more married women searched for jobs during the Great Depression, the federal government sponsored home economics and domestic training programs to make housework more sanitary and efficient. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory 	[üì∑:@librarycongress] https://t.co/Mx7CYqXdzf
In the early 1900s, many Americans began to regard the home almost as a business. It was to be run productively and efficiently through ‚Äúhousehold management‚Äù or ‚Äúhome economics,‚Äù encouraged by government programs. 	#BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory [üì∑:@librarycongress] https://t.co/LxTSQ0jmr5
African American women and other women of color had long been domestic laborers for low wages in other women‚Äôs homes, and for their own families. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory 	[üì∑: Scurlock Studios, Archives Center] https://t.co/MX7D6qPCyk
As more women entered the workforce, housework did not disappear. The work still needed to be done, either by the working woman or by paid servants. This photograph pokes fun at the idea that a man could contribute to the housework.	[üì∑: Underwood, Archives Center] https://t.co/2cKaDHmcF7
In the 1890s, many unmarried women were leaving home and entering the workforce. The shirtwaist became a symbol of these ‚ÄúNew Women.‚Äù Like the short gown above, they provided freedom of motion. Making shirtwaists also provided jobs for many women. https://t.co/WxHTWQ0lvH
No pockets? No problem. A chatelaine, this decorative yet heavy set of tools that dangled from a woman's waist, could help carry key tools. The word "chatelaine" can also refer to a woman in charge of the house. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory https://t.co/8WLCB5xuub
For instance, this short gown from 1790 allowed the wearer freedom of movement to accommodate everything from stirring a pot to carrying firewood. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory https://t.co/rSKEvcwXNR
Our new display, "All Work, No Pay," explores the invisible‚Äîand often unpaid‚Äîwork women did (and do) in the home through objects that help make that work visible, including the clothes women wore. Let's take a closer look. #BecauseOfHerStory #WomensHistory https://t.co/ZxIxSXgqMF

The thank-you note was considered so typical of the new vice president that our curators decided to add it to the national collection. Today, it gives us a more complete picture of who President Bush was‚Äîhis conciseness, his graciousness, and of course, his sense of humor. https://t.co/PL0XimPzCn
The story behind the note is actually quite simple: in 1981, Bush was attending a reception at the museum, and Kennedy offered the vice president-elect the use of his office‚Äôs shower and bathroom facilities for the day. Apparently, Bush took him up on the offer! üöø
Yes, you're reading the note right‚Äîon January 19, 1981 (the day before he officially became vice president) George H. W. Bush scribbled this message to Roger G. Kennedy, then director of our museum: 		"Roger...Great Shower...Thanks" üñäÔ∏è		We know; you probably have some questions. https://t.co/TEBtq1zetj
President George H. W. Bush wasn't one to waste words. As one speechwriter put it, Bush's rhetoric was often ‚Äúplain, spartan, simple.‚Äù But he was also quick to say thank you.

Kaiser dies in 1949. The progeny of his great-great-great-great grandchildren‚Äîsold to the public when the Army ended the pigeon service in 1957‚Äîremain in lofts across the United States. He came to @Smithsonian in 1950. #StoriesofService https://t.co/J03C3yAYOB

Later in 1948, Kaiser is given membership in the American Legion's First Retreat Post No. 667 in Los Angeles, California. They create a special gold band bearing the organization's crest and engraved with "Kaiser" for his right leg. #StoriesOfService https://t.co/nGYA7dyUpP
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. 1948. Kaiser is now THIRTY-ONE YEARS OLD. Kids at the fort's nursery school hold a birthday party for Kaiser and make him the guest of honor. (Mwah!) #StoriesOfService
Living in his own loft with his latest mate Lady belle, Kaiser sires over 75 squeakers for the U.S. Army. His kids find themselves going overseas in World War II. As a senior bird, Kaiser enjoys his own electric heater provided by the Army. Perks! #StoriesOfService
Kaiser's life as a captured bird was fairly plush. He had a mate and comfy conditions. He was the last surviving captured German pigeon in American custody and his offspring proved champion racers. But he was needed in yet another war. #StoriesOfService https://t.co/SxQHiyIWrs
In this photo from @USNatArchives, the Signal Corps recruits people with "pigeon knowledge" into service. Incidentally, "pigeon knowledge" may qualify you to run a Twitter account much like this one. #StoriesOfService https://t.co/pcaJSWi2qX
In December 1918, the Signal Corps brings home distinguished American pigeons, together with captured German birds, for public relations and morale boosting. Kaiser finds himself paraded with other captured birds and used for recruiting purposes. #StoriesOfService https://t.co/2Vp0RvuC60
During the fighting in France, American troops capture German prisoners and equipment. That includes young Kaiser. Photo from @USNatArchives showing an American and captured German pigeon in a handy backpack. #StoriesOfService https://t.co/ksDpi9YOzK
At just 6 weeks old, the pigeon joins the German army and learns to fly messages. üì®¬†Low tech messaging is SUPER important. Artillery fire could cut wires and prevent human runners from bringing messages to the rear echelons. Much harder to stop a pigeon! #StoriesOfService
Koblenz, Germany. 1917. Kaiser, not yet known as Kaiser, is a five-day-old squeaker (that‚Äôs what you call a baby pigeon) in the loft of one Hans Zimmerman. Hans attaches an ID band to the bird‚Äôs left leg bearing the Imperial German crown and marked 17-0350-47. #StoriesOfService
This pigeon's name was Kaiser. Yep, he's stuffed. But only after he lived a VERY long time. And had a full life of adventure, propaganda, war, sex, and love. His World War I #StoryOfService could be a movie. https://t.co/KXkypCIObh

If you vote today, you may stand alongside Americans who have historically been denied access to the ballot. Poll taxes, literacy tests, and complex registration systems have been all been used to keep people from the polls. Explore this #VoteHistory: https://t.co/YORUBQN6E6 https://t.co/vWCIy1fU4g
Objects aren't the only part of polling places that can teach us #VoteHistory. Your fellow voters also have stories to tell.		Even before the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, young people were shaping the course of our nation's politics: https://t.co/R9ClqXWlX6
Depending on your polling place, your ballot may be a piece of paper üìù or a touchscreen üñ•Ô∏è. Both are effective ways to vote, but they raise the question: what can ballots tell us about #VoteHistory? If you're wondering, yes: we have a thread for that: https://t.co/hxL5W7sZTk https://t.co/GE7UuJMFEw

Since polling places are temporary, they're often placed in schools, libraries, and other buildings that voters can easily access. In the U.S., many polling places are also set up in houses of worship. Our curator on this unique part of our #VoteHistory: https://t.co/Ru8exY40IL
The Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires states and territories to display a Voter‚Äôs Bill of Rights in all polling places. Did you see one today? This poster was used in San Francisco, California. #VoteHistory https://t.co/UlrZEYRDCV
Did signs greet you at your polling place? Since 1975, voting districts with significant populations of Native Americans, Native Alaskans, Asian Americans, and Latinos have been required to provide signs, ballots, instructions in applicable languages. #VoteHistory https://t.co/rdx4PJHnn3
Going to the polls this #ElectionDay? If you have time, take a moment to appreciate your surroundings.

Enjoy learning #VoteHistoryüó≥Ô∏è? Our exhibition, American Democracy, explores fundamental questions about our nation's politics, including: How should we govern? Who can vote? How do we protest? Who can be a citizen? What are our rights &amp; responsibilities?: https://t.co/x84klcN6wS https://t.co/pW4CH1jJSA
In 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act. One of its provisions? Upgrading voting machines. Since then, many states have purchased touch-screen voting machines or "fill-in-the-bubble" optical ballot readers. You may see them tomorrow on #ElectionDay! #VoteHistory https://t.co/iHXFpI0EsJ
Remember "hanging chads"? In 2000, the recount of ballots in Florida during a close presidential election fueled a debate about the reliability of punch card ballots. Our curators were there to collect a vote recorder and other objects: https://t.co/GpVZVXsbSG #VoteHistory https://t.co/t31zcBuqiK
On a vote recorder machine, voters insert a machine-readable ballot card into a frame and then use a stylus to punch out "chads"‚Äîtiny pieces of paper‚Äîon the card. Election officials collect the card and tally the vote later, usually with the help of a computer üñ•Ô∏è. #VoteHistory https://t.co/XvC9ztIGLs
The gear-and-lever voting machine's reign did not last forever. Starting in the 1960s, a new, stylus-and-paper-based technology‚Äîthe Votomatic vote recorder‚Äîchallenged and eventually eclipsed the older machine. #VoteHistory https://t.co/CF5C7JMPVY
By 1960, approximately half of all ballots in the U.S. were cast on gear-and-lever voting machines ‚öôÔ∏è. Political parties encouraged Americans to "pull the lever" for their candidates on election day. Did you ever use one? #VoteHistory https://t.co/wIX9tqYtVu
Instructional devices like this gave voters an opportunity to practice using a gear-and-lever machine before voting. Want to practice before #ElectionDay? Your local election office might list the kinds of machines your district uses: https://t.co/ChzZUT6aR6 #VoteHistory #Civics https://t.co/UleTFmpnTB
In the early 1900s, many states and territories began replacing older voting technologies with a new invention: the gear-and-lever voting machine. Instead of filling out a paper ballot, voters cast their vote by pulling levers for their chosen candidates or party. #VoteHistory https://t.co/ilYw7QkCXY
Adding transparent glass wasn't the only way inventors tried to improve voting machines in the 1800s. The Acme Ballot Box was one of many voting machines to include an internal cylinder ‚Äúroller.‚Äù Once submitted, ballots couldn't be tampered with (or seen). #VoteHistory https://t.co/EnKhA32UZF
Others were more skeptical about the effect glass ballot boxes would have on elections. This 1874 illustration from Harper's Weekly reminded readers that new ballot boxes wouldn't protect voters' from intimidation and violence at the polls. #VoteHistory [üì∑: @librarycongress ] https://t.co/knjflrAP8U
Supporters of the glass ballot box believed that its transparency would prevent misconduct at the polls. Many‚Äîlike the illustrators for Puck magazine in 1881‚Äîhoped the boxes would break the political power of political "machines" like New York's Tammany Hall. #VoteHistory https://t.co/c4QuY5VSZO
The glass ballot box is one of the most iconic designs for voting machines in U.S. history. Widely adopted in the late 1800s, the glass ballot box became a symbol of democratic self-government. Some political parties even made it part of their symbol on ballots. #VoteHistory https://t.co/vx6xUndWWd
Let's start with the most basic of voting machines: a ballot box. üó≥Ô∏è 	A ballot box is just...well, a box where voters' ballots can be stored until they're counted. Ballot boxes can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes; our collections include quite a few. #VoteHistory https://t.co/jpdKWKxYNB
You go to the polls. You vote. You go home. But wait‚Äîhow did you vote? Did you fill in bubble‚úèÔ∏è? Tap a touchscreen üñêÔ∏è? Pull a lever ‚öôÔ∏è?		Voting machines usually don‚Äôt get a lot of attention, but they‚Äôre a vital part of what makes our democracy work. #VoteHistory #ElectionDay https://t.co/WYT6cyl4Oe

@rdavidson721 We think it's really interesting how much ballot designs can vary from state to state! üó≥Ô∏è
When you think of food from the Pacific Northwest, what comes to mind?	Washington state is known for its fertile apple-growing lands. Some of our favorite apple crates from our collections. #SmithsonianFood #FoodHistory https://t.co/Hm3UpdgI7P
Planning to vote next week? You may be able to practice with a sample ballot ahead of time. üó≥Ô∏è		This @USAGov portal can connect you to the website for your state or territory's election office: https://t.co/ChzZUT6aR6 #VoteHistory #Civics #CivicEngagement https://t.co/DDaVlqAoeB
To avoid surprises in the voting booth, many states have historically given voters an opportunity to look at a sample ballot before they cast their vote. This 1972 poster included both a sample ballot and instructions on how to use a gear-and-lever voting machine. #VoteHistory https://t.co/kTtzbEfvK2
A "straight-ticket" checkbox ‚òëÔ∏è was another design innovation for blanket ballots. By filling in one box, voters could support every candidate running for office from their chosen political party. This 1897 circular explained how the checkbox worked. #VoteHistory https://t.co/ahw5JtwrEZ
Though most states adopted the blanket ballot, they differed in their designs. Some added symbols to help voters associate candidates with political parties; others did not. Which would you prefer? #VoteHistory https://t.co/yyOjfXly37
Blanket ballots differed from party tickets in that they:		1Ô∏è‚É£: Listed all candidates for office, regardless of party.	2Ô∏è‚É£: Were produced by public officials, not parties.	3Ô∏è‚É£: Could be filled out in secret (often behind a curtain using crayons like these).	 	#VoteHistory https://t.co/ehBotyZOnk
Frustrated with the status quo, in the late 1800s most U.S. states abandoned party tickets in favor of a ballot style developed 50 years earlier in South Australia‚Äîthe Australia or "blanket" ballot. This 1896 ballot from New York is a good example. #VoteHistory https://t.co/0zlBif32Zt
The lack of secrecy wasn't the only issue with party tickets. Party-made ballots could also be deceptively worded. This 1884 ballot say "Republican and Independent" at the top, but the listed presidential candidate is Grover Cleveland‚Äîthe Democratic nominee! #VoteHistory https://t.co/qPqzCRtLWa
One side-effect of having political parties make the ballots? Your vote was rarely secret üòÆ. In fact, parties varied their ballots' size, style, and color so they could easily monitor who was coming to the polls‚Äîand who they were voting for. #VoteHistory https://t.co/z4vOHWfqmf
Paper ballots became more popular in the U.S. after the Civil War, but they differed greatly from ballots today. Most were "party tickets"‚Äîballots produced by (and only listing the candidates from) one political party, like this 1848 ballot for the Free Soil Party. #VoteHistory https://t.co/4l5Ii2ePOz
üó£Ô∏è+üëÇ=üó≥Ô∏è? Early elections in the U.S. were often conducted by "voice vote." Instead of using ballots, Americans cast their votes orally before an election official. Can you spot the voter in George Caleb Bingham's 1852 painting "The County Election"? [üé®:@ngadc] #VoteHistory https://t.co/aNGennCDpN
Ballots. We usually focus on who's on them. But ballots have a history that's all their own. üó≥Ô∏è		So get your ‚úèÔ∏è and ‚òùÔ∏è ready: today, we're going to take a deep dive into the slips of paper that help make our democracy go.  #VoteHistory https://t.co/wL9gaTR4OC

They're back! Conservator Dawn Wallace has positioned Dorothy's Ruby Slippers just right in their new case and they're waiting to see you (but not your little dog, sorry) starting today at 10 a.m. Wear your red shoes and come see how they sparkle after 200 hours of conservation. https://t.co/h8q4IjYDlj
At 80 years old, the Ruby Slippers from #WizarOfOz required hours of cleaning. We also stabilized the threads holding the sequins in place. Many thanks to our #KeepThemRuby Kickstarter backers, who made it possible to put the shoes back on display today! #EntertainmentHistory https://t.co/i5pKL83QL0

P.S. Good news. Feona, our Nipper lookalike was adopted! At the dog park, you may overhear this very good girl telling her canine pals about Nipper and the history of recorded sound. (Or not. Maybe just a lot of butt-sniffing.) Congrats, Feona. https://t.co/XQn0WFIqTD
"America's Listening" display opens tomorrow, October 19 in our Ray Dolby Gateway to Culture. It may bring back memories of trading vinyl with friends, recording mixtapes on cassettes, or jamming out on your first mp3 player. #EntertainmentHistory #HistTech https://t.co/qO5o0vPney
Dolby's 1960s noise reduction system made that annoying hiss disappear, making you feel like you're actually in the same room your favorite podcaster or musician. Find out how it worked in less than two minutes: https://t.co/O5o8zQrEbz https://t.co/7TXUFfdQvT
We hope your very good boys enjoy learning about early sound recording as much as we do. Is it time for walkies? Great! "America‚Äôs Listening" also includes this Walkman Pro, which included Ray Dolby's noise reduction system. It cut down on that annoying hissing sound. https://t.co/V3jF9UOFz8
Recording tech got easier on the ears. Operatic tenor Enrico Caruso had a loud, deep voice and his 1916 recording made deep impressions on the master recording. Duplicate discs were pressed and sounded great. His sick beats: https://t.co/R8vtSNLQcy Image: prototype gramophone https://t.co/NX0WuiPrMW
Is your dog still listening? Sit, Fido. Pay attention. There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHound Dog,‚Äù ‚ÄúWho Let the Dogs Out,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDog Days Are Over‚Äù without this technology, pupsters. https://t.co/iDMb9WLTkw
Ok, so that 1878 jam we promised was maybe not a total banger. Fine. But that sweet coronet solo, recorded at a public demo of the machine in St. Louis, Missouri, transported sound from the past into the future. In a world with no recorded sound, this was BONKERS. #tardis https://t.co/A1umbbAbcD
üó£Ô∏è Shouting into the mouthpiece would make indentations on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped around the hand-rotated drum. Take a listen to what it would have sounded like (crank those speakers, you‚Äôll love this 1870s jam). https://t.co/yLUcZARROY
What amazed Nipper was how real his master‚Äôs voice sounded. ("How'd he get IN there?" Nipper wonders.) üíø But the earliest recording tech was NOT high fidelity. Nipper‚Äôs dad would have had to SHOUT at Edison‚Äôs Tinfoil Phonograph. Curator Stephens introduces the 1878 machine. https://t.co/GwgttlVAbn
Woof? Nipper the dog peers into a commercial gramophone like this one by Emile Berliner. Listening to music at home once meant convincing your annoying sibling to play the piano for you. üôÑ With mass-produced discs, music fans had a whole new world of pop music to explore. https://t.co/RYZSaEnZgn
It‚Äôs important to talk to your pets about the history of recorded sound. Feona, a terrier-hound mix fostered by a staff member, learned all about gramophone tech from her foster mom‚Äîin addition to learning how to fetch. In this thread, a few facts for YOUR history-loving pups. üê∂ https://t.co/GoYDZmaqlW
Made as a window for the Victor Company‚Äôs headquarters in New Jersey, the Nipper window welcomes visitors to our Ray Dolby Gateway to Culture, opening tomorrow, Oct. 19.

We ‚ù§Ô∏è an adorable doggy head tilt. In this 1915 stained glass window, Nipper the dog is transfixed by his master's voice playing on a gramophone record.

The amazing folks at @NatlArmyMuseum are live tweeting the story of the #LostBattalion. Follow along! https://t.co/pI49xlbkXn
McMurtry received the Medal of Honor. Allied governments also honored the men with the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre and the Order of Prince Danilo I from Montenegro. Here are McMurtry's medals, which also include his Spanish War Service Medal. #LostBattalion https://t.co/I5oyKF2UF7
What about the humans of the #LostBattalion? We have the medals of Captain George G. McMurtry, a former Rough Rider and millionaire Wall Street lawyer. He was in command of the second battalion of the 308th Infantry Regiment. For his leadership and valor, he received many honors. https://t.co/ikLJnjl4RS
Cher Ami was one of many animals to serve in World War I: https://t.co/hhajdFk6Vm
After the Armistice ending World War I, Cher Ami arrived in the United States as a hero pigeon on April 16, 1919, but succumbed to battle wounds on June 13. Visit Cher Ami in our "Price of Freedom: Americans at War" exhibition. #LostBattalion https://t.co/J47oR5MGvI
An hour later, Cher Ami arrives bearing the scars of battle and the last communication from Whittlesey and his men. Despite loss of a leg and a bullet through the breast, little Cher Ami's message is received. The shelling stops. #LostBattalion https://t.co/8C5IbXOyhu
And Cher Ami heroically flies off... NOPE. Cher Ami flies to a nearby tree and has a sit. Won't budge. Richards finally climbs Cher Ami‚Äôs tree, shaking the limbs until the bird takes flight. #LostBattalion
Richards clips a message in a small container to Cher Ami's left leg. "We are along the road parallel 276.4. Our own artillery is dropping a barrage directly on us. For heaven's sake stop it." #LostBattalion https://t.co/9hMAnEKCzr
Private Omer Richards does his best. But in the confusion, one of the two remaining homing pigeons escapes. The only one left is Cher Ami, a British homing pigeon whose name means "Dear Friend" in French. #LostBattalion https://t.co/86wHKO6eOl
On the afternoon of October 4, 1918, American artillery inadvertently begins falling on the men of the #LostBattalion. They take what cover they can. Major Whittlesey calls for a homing pigeon to relay a message to stop the bombardment.
By October 3, 1918, German forces surround them. For days, they dig in and fight off repeated enemy attacks. #LostBattalion
World War I, October 1918. Forest of Argonne in France. Under heavy fire, cut off by the enemy, and desperate for rescue, the men of what became known as the #LostBattalion have only two homing pigeons left.
Hi. Can we talk about a heroic pigeon who did something cool 100 years ago today? https://t.co/pEhInhhrNo

Where was Key when he wrote the song? There are two answers to this question and @JohnGadsby knows both: https://t.co/MY3sZsJvXL https://t.co/9Bq03Xawh6
The lyrics are set to the tune of "Anachreon in Heaven," as noted in the first public appearance of the lyrics in a broadside. Key had written a totally different song sent to the same tune years earlier, so he was familiar with the tune. https://t.co/qc4DsZjvTz
As the home of the flag that inspired "The Star-Spangled Banner," our national anthem, we're often asked if Francis Scott Key meant to write a poem or a song. We think he was writing lyrics to a song from the beginning. #NationalPoetryDay https://t.co/gjUbVAK9tt

An odd souvenir for #NationalPoetryDay, this lock of hair was cut from the head of the Scottish poet and historical novelist Sir Walter Scott. His physician gave the lock to Hew Ainslie, a celebrated Scottish poet who had emigrated to the United States. https://t.co/4O2osynpgM

@ShortFormErnie @CuttingRoomWiki @museumofplay @Borman18 There are scholars as well as you point out other people not affiliated with an institution that are doing this work as well. Preserving video games is a team effort. -Drew #AskACurator
@ShortFormErnie @CuttingRoomWiki That is a great question, and admittedly, we have not been able to do that kind of level of preservation of these games. Other institutions such as the Strong Museum of Play (@museumofplay) has an digital archivist (@Borman18) that does the kind of thing you talk about. (1/2)
@AnnieLyon Atari 2600 was very popular for its time, but if you look at the list of best selling systems, it would be at the middle of the pack. All versions of the Playstation have been popular globally as well as Nintendo systems.üéÆ -Drew #AskACurator https://t.co/ueNgdtkPFf
@AnnieLyon The Game Boy certainly ranks up there. As more people have played video games over the last 45 years or so, the market share for the system grows so it‚Äôs hard to compare systems over time. #AskACurator

@AmeliaTGrabow Amanda works on the #PhilanthropyInitiative, but it was a story that intersected with our Many Voices, One Nation exhibit, the museum's focus on civic engagement (how parents pushed against the idea), and included artifacts from religious history.

@ElliotEBK Great question! Basically, Edison had good public relations people and cultivated the press....
@kyraator @TheAutry Wow! Are you sure you are #NotAGeologist? ;)

@teamcoffin @leslieposter Another fun "one" is this single sequin from a very famous red pair of shoes. The shoes were worn by Dorothy in the #WizardOfOz a long time ago.

@cxarli From Hal in Electrical History: One of the most important invention in electrical history was Alessandro Volta‚Äôs ‚Äúpile‚Äù in 1799. The first battery, it provided a source of steady current that enabled new electrical experiments and new technologies like the telegraph. https://t.co/vfp2S4d1WL
@bobzy71 So sorry. Was this today? I'll pass this along ASAP. - Erin
@yorkh44 The moment in 1994 when I read a help wanted ad for a research assistant to work here on refreshing the Lighting A Revolution exhibition. I had just earned a masters in the history of technology and wanted a job doing history. üí° #AskACurator
@teamcoffin @leslieposter Hi, kindergartners! "It is I, Count von Count! Let's count bats!" ü¶á One! ü¶á Two! ü¶á Three! This is our Count von Count puppet puppet from 1994. #AskACurator https://t.co/YdWSDB7CrY
@CollectNCurate We encourage it. ASPIC! ASPIC! ASPIC! https://t.co/jsrQbLB41s
@Duchampia Collections care is really important to us. We follow best practices, listen to in-house experts, and follow guidance from @SmithsonianCRI (more here https://t.co/9VwP3jY6u6). Some great tips are here: https://t.co/taIDRWpmkT #AskACurator
Do you know what this is? Hal, our electrical history curator, does! 	Only about half an hour to ask him all your burning questions. You never know what will trigger a light bulb moment. #AskACuratorüí° https://t.co/k4tdN80qtE
@yorkh44 Too many vibrations transmitted to the internal structure will break the filaments. We have a very rare osmium filament lamp that I handle as little as possible for just that reason.üí°-Hal #AskACurator
@yorkh44 Typically we keep the lightbulbs in acid-free trays cushioned by soft tissue. Even old bulbs are surprisingly tough if not dropped. The biggest concern is vibrations ... #AskACurator
@CollectNCurate Sometimes, this is yummy. Sometimes, this is not! https://t.co/5B4bJj576T #AskACurator https://t.co/9KOrK1oDv6
@CollectNCurate We can't think of an object that his been intentionally licked right now. But we do sometimes cook up historic recipes to find out how they taste! https://t.co/WxQZ2FJPPG #AskACurator
@theukpa86 From Hal in Electrical History: An Ampex Signature V home entertainment center from 1963. One of only five made, this was the first home video tape recorder available. Here‚Äôs an ad from the 1963 Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog. https://t.co/G37v20p07W
@bobzy71 So sorry to hear this. Can you tell us which entrance of the museum and a little more about the problem? I'd like to follow up with relevant team members. - Erin

@cxarli Great question! We were just talking about this one: https://t.co/byFSPYNKR7
@danmcknight From Hal in Electrical History: One of the oddest I can think of is a patent model for an electrical whale-hunting machine. Apparently the idea was to harpoon the whale with electrical harpoons. #AskACurator https://t.co/ij3S0aCSoZ
@buttons4brains Absolutely. I do know that internships and volunteering are a great way to break in. Informational interviews (and what you're doing now) also help! Network away. #AskAnArchivist is a thing! For me, it was also helpful to take courses in Museum Studies. -Erin
@AmeliaTGrabow Electrical history curator Hal Wallace shares one of the Cold War stories from his collection: "We have a set of teletype machines used in the Washington-Moscow ‚ÄúHotline‚Äù during the mid-1960s. There‚Äôs a U.S. unit and a companion Russian unit made in East Germany." #AskACurator https://t.co/rqAzKc4EfC
@AmeliaTGrabow The American display included a house filled with labor saving manufactured goods. After the fair the objects were dispersed, but it would be great to have them in our collection. We try to collect important icons and these everyday objects fit that charge. - Peter #AskACurator
@AmeliaTGrabow Peter, our #BusinessHistory curator, writes that he would love to collect from the Kitchen Debate, where U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev met at the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959. #AskACurator

#AskACurator day shines a light on museum collections &amp; experts, doesn't it? Electricity curator Hal Wallace agrees and is excited to answer your questions on the history of üí° lighting.

@WidowPage One is for owners of McDonalds owned by African Americans in the '70s and '80s, and the other search is for people associated with the Six Companies (Chinese Benevolent Association) in San Francisco. Both of these searches have fascinating stories behind them!-Peter #AskACurator
@AGRCatMTSU For politics at the more grassroots level, I‚Äôll choose the suffrage banner that challenged President Wilson to extend democracy at home as well as abroad. https://t.co/9gMtcSowAI #AskACurator -Claire https://t.co/K2s55axXCA
@WidowPage Great question! A good curator always has many irons in the fire. Surprisingly it is often more difficult to meet and collect from unknown people than famous folks. Right now I have two searches underway ... #AskACurator
@AGRCatMTSU Too bad‚Äîsoap babies miss your cutoff date by 4 years! First, I‚Äôm going to sub-divide "political." Thinking about electoral politics, the chairs from the first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960. These shine for me as I study campaign rhetoric and presidential debates. #AskACurator https://t.co/r625KoMUdi
@theukpa86 I had a similar response! Have a great day. -Erin
@RachelRosenfel4 Great question! Getting back to you shortly. #AskACurator
@royalenfields For Emily on our National Numismatic Collection team, her favorite coin changes all the time. Right now, it‚Äôs probably a drachm from Sasanian Persia. Look at that beard! More whiskers on coins: https://t.co/wFuQDlIUCF #AskACurator https://t.co/LTGExh6KBJ
@TheHistoryJourn More from Emily on the awesomeness of our National Numismatic Collection: https://t.co/wFuQDlIUCF #AskACurator
@TheHistoryJourn While we have fantastic exhibitions, it‚Äôs not possible to put all of our collections on display. Making things digitally accessible via the Smithsonian Collections Search, Learning Lab, etc. allows for greater interaction with these wonderful objects. -Emily #AskACurator
@TheHistoryJourn From Emily in our National Numismatic Collection: Digitizing the ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù objects! I love knowing that people, both near and far,  can see some of our fabulous coins, bank notes, and medals  and find value from studying them. #AskACurator
@yorkh44 What to collect is an excellent question. We can‚Äôt do it all but it is important to have priorities. In our #BusinessHistory exhibition, we're focusing on untold stories of everyday objects and work, with a focus on the role of women at work and in business. -Peter #AskACurator
@lydiabmiller Thanks for asking! For me, this curb cut has so many stories to tell--all while looking totally ordinary. https://t.co/bVUXVC0StQ There's a recent @99piorg episode on this #DisabilityHistory topic. #AskACurator -Erin
@BranRiverMuseum @lydiabmiller Love that one!
@cooperhewitt @leslieposter One way is by looking at the stats for past blog posts. Which ones got people excited and inspired them to share? Can we do more like that one? - Erin #AskACurator #musesocial
@theukpa86 I was deeply stirred the first time I helped move the table on which Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote the Declaration of Sentiments. It isn‚Äôt often that any of us get to touch the object that helped make our life possible.  -Claire #AskACurator https://t.co/nm2bpO1b4X
@theukpa86 I was moved the first time I saw FDR‚Äôs lap robe he used in his car. -Claire #AskACurator
@theukpa86 From Claire on our #PoliticalHistory team: I love unexpected finds. I got pretty excited this week when I came across a t-shirt I didn't know we had from the 1984 presidential debate (one of my personal interests), for example. #AskACurator
There's still time to ask #BusinessHistory curator Peter your burning questions! 	Peter has been working a lot with is our tractor collection. With 14 full-size tractors and many more scale models, there's a lot of history to discover! üöú #AskACurator	https://t.co/qf0MxWV5XE
@AntennaIntl What can help any of us answer this question? Being well-grounded in what came before. If we understand the campaigns, Congressional debates, reform movements, etc. of the past, we are in a better position to interpret the present. -Claire #AskACurator
@Railok I've heard Peter say that one of the reasons we study and share history is to make better choices in the future. I think that learning from workplace disasters can be part of that. -Amelia #AskACurator
@AntennaIntl From Claire in #PoliticalHistory: I am one of those historians who see every time as important! That sounds flippant but I mostly mean it. Living in a moment makes it very hard to know how it will be seen in the future.  #AskACurator
@Railok Peter also pointed out "Remembering these tragedies is important, but equally important is putting them into a broader context. The complexities that lead up to disasters is often very revealing." #AskACurator
@Railok But Peter points out "workplace disasters continue to be a problem in the U.S. While the frequency and loss of life used to be worse, the sad truth is going to work can still be dangerous." #AskACurator
@Railok Tragic workplace disasters did happen a lot in the early 20th century. Some notable examples include other garment factory fires, the Monograph mine disaster (1907, 362 die), the Boston Molasses disaster (1919, 150 injured), and many more ...

@Railok Great question! Peter will get back to you with more information.	In the meantime, here's the story of at least one other devastating early 20th century fire. #AskACurator https://t.co/xloJsj5tdj
@SachseHist Any questions we can answer in the meantime? #AskACurator

@JONAHTHETOAST @leslieposter We do have Walking Dead objects in the collection, so those could be helpful. But, our Collections Managers would probably not take too kindly on us using objects to fight the undead.üòâ -Amelia, Social Media Manager	https://t.co/s3oPyrtcMu
@EPCOT02 Oooo we were just talking about this one! For Claire on our #PoliticalHistory team, it's a silk scarf with teeny tiny words printed on it. #AskACurator https://t.co/byFSPYNKR7
@wesleyjanicki Because President William Henry Harrison died one month after taking office, it became a mourning piece. What a fascinating object! Easy to overlook on first glance. - Claire #AskACurator
@wesleyjanicki But this piece of silk wasn‚Äôt intended as a decorative item, it was meant as an article of remembrance. The words of William Henry Harrison's 1841 inaugural address, all 8'460 of them, were printed on the silk! #AskACurator
@wesleyjanicki From Claire in #PoliticalHistory: Everybody has objects they are more or less attracted to. It depends on the stories they know‚Äîand especially the stories they don‚Äôt. For example, an item in "American Presidency" looks like an ordinary scarf with lots of tiny words on it.
@wesleyjanicki It's our Technicolor camera and I love it: https://t.co/iYcRmT1mE0 - Erin #AskACurator
@lydiabmiller For me personally, I found Museum Studies courses to be really helpful. "Five years experience or a degree" was common in job announcements I saw. Museum Education and audience-focused courses are also really important, I think. #AskACurator - Erin
@lydiabmiller Claire on our #PoliticalHistory team is a second-career museum professional who got her start at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri. She does believe public history or museum studies courses are really important. #AskACurator
@wesleyjanicki For me, a sometimes overlooked object is this ugly duckling. Look how awkward it is! Bulky, goofy, graceless, not vivid in its coloration. If it could walk, it would trip over its own feet. But you know what? This object is truly amazing. Can you identify it? - Erin #AskACurator https://t.co/EXTrrgtSkd

@lydiabmiller Great question! We were just chatting about this one: https://t.co/X69UxfFtxV
@BCLMCurators @AmeliaTGrabow @yorkh44 @BCLivingMuseum We're hog-wild for that idea! There are *sow* many angles of pigs to study. For instance, our medical science team took a historic look at this effort to have healthy hogs for a healthy nation. #AskACurator 	https://t.co/dUTtXF9ib4
@TheHistoryJourn Good luck! We love the museum field and hope you find an awesome spot in it! - Erin
@leslieposter @royalenfields One thing I admire about Leslie's work is how she helps stop "uh oh!" moments before they happen. I've seen her work with interns on their blog pitches and she knows just how to help shape and frame a story so it's extra interesting AND avoids pitfalls. -Erin
@CarrieStLCards @leslieposter Interesting question! The Liberty Bell isn't in our collection--the @NatlParkService takes care of it. @INDEPENDENCENHP might know the answer to your question.		However, if you're a big fan of bell history, we have just the blog post for you: https://t.co/gif5HAN1zi #AskACurator
@leslieposter @AmeliaTGrabow @AmandaMoniz1 We think we know too! Here's a hint, it is in this blog post:	https://t.co/H0aiIyzcOQ
@TheHistoryJourn And I enjoy researching and writing the story of those objects that can then be shared with our visitors on-site and on-line. (Like you! Thanks for your curiosity!) - Claire, #AskACurator
@TheHistoryJourn The look on an object donor's face when they realize they are placing something they love into the national collection to become part of our collective memory is priceless. - Claire, #AskACurator
@TheHistoryJourn From Claire in #PoliticalHistory: Helping to choose objects that will tell the story of American history to future generations!
@RachelCamille7 From Claire: Almost any museum from your campus history center to your county historical society to @Smithsonian is delighted to work with volunteers and interns on exhibits, collections, visitor engagement. It's also a great way to find out where your real museum passions lie.
@RachelCamille7 From Claire, #PoliticalHistory curator: Content expertise is a must in addition to your museum studies courses. Critical to acquire hands-on experience through internships or volunteering.
@RachelCamille7 I did Museum Studies with a focus on Museum Education. "Museum Audiences" and Evaluation were two VERY valuable classes. I didn't want to have a topic focus because I wasn't sure if I wanted to work with art, otters, or history. But you could develop that, too! -Erin

@SeamstressMaire @smithsonian Not at this moment. First, they've been apart for a long time--since the 1970s. So being mismatched is now part of their history. Second, we've spent 200 hours conserving our pair. We enjoyed their brief reunion a lot and were thrilled to learn more. -Erin

@wizzerfly @AmEntmtCurator At this point, they've been mismatched so long that it's part of their history. We've put a lot of effort into conserving our Ruby Slippers, whereas the recovered pair has been out in the world. So we're glad to have had the opportunity to study them!

Our Ruby Slippers return to display on October 19. Thanks to stabilizing conservation treatment supported by #KeepThemRuby @kickstarter backers, the shoes will delight visitors for generations to come. https://t.co/O22UXLFbRE
Our conservators are the experts on Dorothy's footwear, spending over 200 hours studying and conserving the 80-year-old heels. This "sequin by sequin sequence" included cleaning and realigning some sequins to expose their silver, reflective side. Shown here: CLOSE up sequin. üî¨ https://t.co/bksdWVVqWJ
We've long known that the two shoes in our pair of Ruby Slippers aren't a perfect match. See the differences? We were over the rainbow to discover that the recovered pair and our pair are long-lost siblings. https://t.co/T91LAQfxWb https://t.co/0nLEIVgX3d
Clue that made us want to click our heels together: clear glass beads painted red. On set, a few red glass beads must have fallen off the bows of the Ruby Slippers and were replaced with clear ones painted red. Both the recovered pair and our pair include these telltale beads. üî¥ https://t.co/WjNSlRIU2s
But are the recovered pair the real shoes worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 film or masterful replicas? After close examination, our conservators determined that the recovered pair is consistent with ours in material, condition, and construction. Image: the recovered pair. üë† https://t.co/yQT9wQ68pW
A single red sequin was left in the case. A pair of #RubySlippers was gone, stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum. Today @FBI announces they're found! We were honored to help by examining the shoes and determining that they are consistent with ours. https://t.co/T91LAQfxWb
@tastewart @hilaryluros We hope you do!
@KimsOkay @ajc Very welcome! We are so grateful to the backers who helped support this conservation work. It took over 200 hours and will stabilize the shoes for generations to come.
@eringeisler Indeed! I was also surprised to learn how many existed. On our blog, we dig through Dorothy's closet. https://t.co/DNwnnqWRCA -Erin
@KimsOkay @ajc Dorothy had more than one pair of Ruby Slippers in her closet. Our pair has been in our collection since 1979. We recently completed their conservation and they return to display October 19. https://t.co/7mNbAmGf01

One of Music Curator John Troutman's favorites is "First Snow in Kokomo." He calls the song "breathtaking in its quiet celebration of the profound grace, awe, and joy of life. She had a special skill for crafting incredibly intimate scenes of the everyday." #ArethaFranklin https://t.co/a3dGDGCYMZ

It's not a direct parallel but it reminds me of this drawing Rip Rapson did to help board conceptualize a new focus for the nearly 100-year-old organization.-Amelia #AmericanGiving #philanthropy https://t.co/a6t3E6BNId
@1sgmoran It may not be easy being green, but he makes it look good. This version of Kermit appeared on "Sam and Friends," a five-minute television show seen in Washington, D.C., from 1955 and 1962. https://t.co/sm8y5Buub0

@PACEfunders We agree! üé∂üéªüéµ	Artistic performances have a long history of both inspiring empathy and being a form of action used to support a variety of causes. Here a few examples from our collection. https://t.co/QqcepfHtCg  #philanthropy  #AmericanGiving https://t.co/blNXFDwY6n
