So Bernie 2.0 is going to be much like Bernie 1.0. But the takeaway from that CNN townhall is that he needs more murder board sessions on racial issues, especially finding a clear concise answer on reparations.		Those questions aren't going away. No excuse not to be prepared.
Reparations for the descendants of slaves?		Bernie doesn't commit. 		Wolf brings up Warren + Castro's support.		"What do they mean? I'm not sure anyone's really clear," Bernie says.		Then says he agrees with Warren's statement, but doesn't seem his on board with reparations.
Bernie, before bringing up the racial disparities that cause economic inequality, acknowledges, "Maybe I haven't been as strong on this issue as I could be."
Asked by @wolfblitzer why he won't call Maduro a dictator, Bernie pauses:		"There are still democratic operations taking place in that country," + calls for "Internationally supervised free elections."		Raises why Trump isn't as concerned about free elections in Saudi Arabia.
. @chrislhayes asks what @ewarren's 1st legislative priority will be as president.		It's not her wealth tax or her universal child care. She replies, 	"anti-corruption."
Asked how he'll engage Trump in a debate, Bernie says:		"We'll bring a lie detector along. And every time he lies it goes beep! . . .		"The pathological liar he is has to be exposed."
Asked why democratic socialism is preferable to capitalism, Bernie&gt;		"We don't have guarantees of economic rights . . . We can make sure that all of our people live in security and dignity . . . When I talk about democratic socialism I talk about human rights &amp; economic rights."
He said he would have released them if he won the nomination. https://t.co/MygCwf1eAi
Bernie says he'll release 10 years of tax returns. "Our tax returns will bore you to death. Nothing special about them," he says.		Asked when they'll be released, Sanders says "sooner rather than later."
Questioner asks Bernie why he's running as a Democrat:		"I'm a member of the Democratic leadership of the United States Senate."
Bernie grumbles at the recitation of his quote about the sexual harassment problem in his '16 campaign and how he was busy running around running for president:		"Well I think that quote was a little bit out of context."
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/nL9smtAqNw
Bernie, asked at CNN townhall about whether private insurance will remain under Medicare for All, says:		"What will change in their plans is the color of their card . . . Our bill covers all healthcare needs."		Says private insurance could be used for "cosmetic" needs.

She breezed by it quickly, but Klobuchar did say she favored a corporate tax cut, just not as drastic as Trump and the GOP brought it down.

Here are the pros &amp; cons of an Elizabeth Warren presidential run. ‚Å¶@ewarren‚Å©  https://t.co/ymkMPqkH3a
Most notable to me on Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs video is how LITTLE it is about Trump. Just a short video and audio snippet of him. But just as much time devoted to Bush &amp; Reagan. Signals a campaign against long-held GOP economic philosophy, not a person.
I don‚Äôt love the exploratory committee decision ‚Äî simply because I feel like it shows the slightest bit of hesitation of being all in. But the most important thing for @ewarren now is to see a polling bump both nationally &amp; in Iowa within 2 weeks.
I like @ewarren‚Äôs New Years Eve move on timing ‚Äî gets the jump start on the large field and forces herself to be the center of conversation as people gather through the evening.

I think that‚Äôs correct.		But 2 weeks ago my confidence of a Dem House flip was 80%.		I‚Äôd say now I‚Äôm at 65%. 		And again God knows all that can happen in 2 weeks. https://t.co/s3g3lxBo0b
lol obviously they‚Äôre not popping champagne. 		It‚Äôd be the surprise of the YEAR if Republicans held the House. Again, the point is, it‚Äôs POSSIBLE 2 weeks away. 		20 to 30 seat gain MUCH more likely, but Republicans have closed the enthusiasm gap to make it a dog fight. https://t.co/3fcoRYEUOa
Of course not. But there aren‚Äôt 23 seats where Dems have public polling leads outside the margin of error.

Another proof point on the new GOP bullishness on the House &gt;		‚ÄúThe Democrats‚Äô lead in those Clinton districts has narrowed a bit since the beginning of the month.‚Äù https://t.co/Wdf3WUxt3g

Of course there‚Äôs little room for error and LOTS of time.		But idea of holding everything (narrow wins in #NVSEN &amp; #AZSEN) + picking up #NDSEN &amp; #MOSEN is highly plausible.		And public pollling shows Dems do not YET have leads in +23 House pick-ups. They sit at +12/+15 currently.
2 weeks from E-Day, the GOP is more optimistic than it has been in MONTHS about the cycle.		They increasingly believe they will HOLD the Senate, adding at least 2 seats. 		And are growing more confident they can LIMIT losses in the House to ~20 seats &amp; cling to control. 		#14Days

My take on #MOSEN debate:		Hawley was smooth - maybe too smooth? - more disciplined &amp; played a safe mistake-free debate. Probably did what he needed if he's up 2.		But McCaskill was genuinely more authentic. Her answers far less scripted &amp; raw which reminded you why you like her.
. @HawleyMO is attempting to steal Claire's calling card as a free-thinkin' independent-minded party-bucker:		"Senator McCaskill's been in Washington 12 years. It's just the party line over and over and over. That's not what Missouri wants."		#MOSEN
McCaskill: More than happy to support "some wall," but not a "Sea to shining sea" wall.		"Yes, is the answer," replies @HawleyMO "I support a border wall. Senator McCaskill has called the wall embarrassing."		#MOSEN
Peak Claire: 		"I know I cast votes that a lot of Missourians disagree with. I get that. But you gotta cast the vote and you gotta be upfront on where you stand. You're not going to make everybody happy."		#MOSEN
National Right to Work?		. @HawleyMO: "The people of Missouri have been pretty clear on this issue."		"That's kind of a dodge. Josh Hawley's been very clear that he supports right to work," @clairecmc responds.		#MOSEN
Claire turns to Josh, they lock eyes:		"I'm not running my campaign on attacking somebody's family . . . Somebody is. But it's not me."		#MOSEN
One thing's clear in this #MOSEN debate: @HawleyMO is the smoothest opponent @clairecmc has ever faced in a statewide race.
. @clairecmc: "I think getting the new deal on NAFTA has great promise . . . I'm not afraid to compliment the president."		#MOSEN
. @HawleyMO hits @clairecmc's relationship with Missouri Ag:		"The president of the Farm Bureau told me she won't take his phone call . . . I don't know what that's about."		#MOSEN
. @clairecmc: "I would never support using federal money to buy guns for schools."		@HawleyMO dodges a bit on the question and says a better idea would be allowing locals to determine how to use federal money for safety programs.		#MOSEN
Striking in @clairecmc's answer on guns, how often she's invoking the NRA, betting they are a bogeyman, even in Missouri. She supports universal background checks &amp; banning bump stocks.		#MOSEN
Pressed again, @HawleyMO won't budge on entitlements &gt;		"I would not support cuts to Medicare or Social Security . . . I certainly would not touch them."		#MOSEN
. @clairecmc hits back and says it is @HawleyMO who will be cutting Medicare through his anti-Obamacare lawsuit.		"There's no back-up plan for pre-existing conditions if he's successful," @clairecmc says.		#MOSEN
