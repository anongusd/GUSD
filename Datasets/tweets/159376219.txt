@RepAdamSchiff How can the President get a Top Secret Clearance if he has investigations &amp; lawsuits still in process 	Generally high amts of debt can keep one from a Top Secret Clearance because that person Could take advantage of asking other  countries 4 loans like Kushner did
I am just wondering who is going 2 pay all the law suits	when lungs are damaged from smoking 	People werent warned about addiction &amp; harmful affects w/smoking tobacco &amp; Someone w/B sued in our litigious society It just seems people should B Warned of side effects &amp; addiction
Want 2 tell U about one more thing 	4 extra credit in school I ran a grp &amp; a young Dad had exp losing custody of his son because he was growing pot in front of his child at the same time he found out he had COPD from pot smoking &amp; so was determined 2 quit 4 more reasons than one
I went back 2 school &amp; studied psychology esp Neurobiology &amp; Psychopharmacology &amp; saw how much more research they have done Esp in the UK &amp; Australia I would suggest you or your aides do some reading	It used 2 B tbought 2 B a harmless drug except 4 in combo w/driving &amp; work
So Ms Stewert what I am trying to say is that cannibas CAN destroy families &amp; lives	In teens &amp; younger the addiction rate is up to 17%	and they also have higher amts of psychotic events &amp; 4 a small number of them permanent mental probs from that psychotic event
My son will forever B thankful his Dads job offered the Rehab &amp; that his Dad took the opportunity It was basically go or lose his job &amp; weekends w/his son 	The Rehab worked &amp; my son got his Dad back &amp; saw a valuable life lesson  How people can recover from addiction
Years later his job offered Rehab for all of their employees because there was a prevalence of cannibas users &amp; there had increasingly been more work injuries more tardiness etc Since it took so long 2 train people this Co thought it cheaper 2 offer Rehab than 2 fire &amp; rehire
Right after that teacher called me I asked my Ex to quit &amp; told him that his pot use was affecting our son	He said he would quit But never did &amp; so I filed 4 divorce It was a DIFFICULT thing 2 do But his personality was so changed &amp; the gun carrying (no permit) freaked me out
He didnt coach our son in sports any longer &amp; would often not make it to school events leaving our son searching 4 his dad in the crowd &amp; disappointed when he wasnt there	When my sons teacher asked me if someone in our family had drug or alcohol probs I knew things had 2 change
My husband smoked in the garage as I am sensitive to any smoke &amp; it turned out allergic to pot 	The severe problems began as the side effect of paranoia began &amp; he started carrying a gun &amp; smoking w/unsavory chatacters in our garage instead of being the family man he once was
My ex-husband started smoking cannibas in the 80s when it was a much weaker product as a weekend user A few months later I noticed large amt hidden in the basement He had started selling 2 pay 4 his 	We had a young son &amp; he couldnt afford the amt he was now smoking most every day
@MarthaStewart I am all 4 medical cannibas the type that does give one a high but does help w/nausea 4 &amp; pain 	I am NOT for recreational use of cannibas it is addicting just like Opiods Alcohol &amp; Nicotine etc	4 a percentage of people	My ex-husband was one in that percentage
@tictoc @MarthaStewart just so U are aware Cannibas is addicting just like opiods &amp; alcohol &amp; if SMOKED can cause Serious Lung Conditions like COPD Cannibas is NOT a panacea	It can have serious side effects w/teenagers &amp; younger they can have psychotic events &amp; never recover

@joeljen10 @fedup0044 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump There is money to hire more agents buy better scanning equipment &amp; you wouldn't have one system for the entire border of course that would be too big
@joeljen10 @fedup0044 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Walls would keep US citizens from enjoying their state parks There are several parks along the border  People float down the Rio Grande for fun w/their kids There R ranches w/land on both sides for their cattle	Their is a Native American	Reservation with land on both sides
@joeljen10 @fedup0044 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Bringing a ladder in a truck &amp; then having whoever is with them walk over isnt easy, sounds easy to me		And then because we havent equipped the Border Patrol with 21st Century equipment they wont catch them because they wont know about the crossing for days or weeks
@joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The Great Wall of China didnt even work to keep invaders out
@joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The walls Dividing East &amp;.West Germany were guarded 24 hrs per day with  flood lights &amp; machine guns &amp; they were solid walls but people still escaped
@joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The immigrants seeking asylum came to legal points of entry	Trucks trying to sneak drugs &amp; people through the legal pts of entry are Not All caught because they need More Agents &amp; better equipment
@joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I have family who are border patrol agents &amp; they say a wall would do nothing 	If yoy could see what people have used to climb over the high fences &amp; slats that are already out there	Long Car &amp; truck ramps so they could drive right over	Walls Would never stop the determined
@fedup0044 @joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump No death ray	They use electronic surveillance for companies all over the world around large properties 	Computer screens show life feed for 9 or so cameras &amp; when the person watching sees sonething they call the Border Patrol closest &amp; decide what needs to happen
@fedup0044 @joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Not all of the border is being crossed at the same time at once 	From what I have been told there are areas they watch carefully because they are the most crossed areas But the areas in the vast desert area is difficult to keep an eye on So drones can be their eyes
@joeljen10 @fedup0044 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If drones see people across the border getting ready to cross the border patrol would know These are drones with live feed so all cameras on the drones are being watched So they can send Border patrol to that area by helicopter if necessary
@fedup0044 @joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Right now it may be days or weeks before they find out someone has crossed the border 	And if there was a wall you can be sure any good coyote will bring a ladder	And the border patrol would still not know for days or a couple of weeks
@fedup0044 @joeljen10 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Wonder how stupid you R If know they are coming keep the drone following them is sending live time pics to Border Patrol &amp; Border Patrol will be there to meet them	If the nearest border patrol is far away They can call their helicopters to support

Known as the "gun show loophole," most states do not require background checks for firearms purchased at gun shows from private individuals -- federal law only requires licensed dealers to conduct checks. ... Some states' requirements are limited only to handgun purchases.
Proposals for universal background checks would require almost all firearms transactions in the United States to be recorded and go through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), closing what is sometimes called the private sale loophole.
