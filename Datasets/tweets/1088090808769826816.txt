@dillard_jc @burgessev The argument is that there are more effective ways to secure the border and there's a hell of a lot more nuance in border security than a big ol' concrete wall. Is it really so impossible to understand that position? Why will Republicans not even entertain that idea?
@dillard_jc @burgessev What would a wall do re: chain migration, visa overstays, migrants seeking asylum, etc? It's so simple to say "build the wall" whereas "some strategic fencing in certain areas, increased border patrol agents, increases in immigration judges to solve backlog" doesn't sound as fun.

@sekrah @thehill One would assume the person throwing around insults about street whores unprovoked would be the one whose not calm! Anyway, I hope someday you'll see women as more than just bodies, but it doesn't seem like that will happen any time soon! I wish you well, and have a nice day!
@devincomiskey @sekrah @thehill lol right? like yah maybe I wouldn't wear that for a job interview. But I see women wear outfits like this to work all the time. And I bet this person will claim they're not sexist, yet any woman not covered from head to toe is a street whore!
@banjoboy2 @sekrah @thehill Not bad! How is yours? I wish her well. :)
@sekrah @thehill What is it about the sight of a woman's arms or legs that just drives you crazy? I wish I could understand. You act as though this woman marched out in nipple pasties and a thong! I'm trying to figure out how this outfit looks like that to you. It's fascinating!
@sekrah @thehill I definitely have never seen the "street whores" that you're talking about. I work in an office and a woman in her 30s wore a very similar outfit to this yesterday, albeit with a cardigan as well. I am assuming you must not know/be around many young women!
@sekrah @thehill Sorry, quick question. What about wearing a pair of boots &amp; a dress make one a "street whore," which I assume means prostitute, which means someone who trades sex for money. Kind of a weird leap, no? Just bc you can see 4 inches of thigh and bare arms?

@dillard_jc @burgessev There's no debate that border security is important. But for $5b, there are better options than a vanity wall. I think it's sad &amp; counterproductive that the debate over security's been reduced to catchy phrases and hashtags. You know there's a hell of a lot more nuance than that.

@dillard_jc @burgessev Truthfully, JC, I don't think you would know a DACA recipient if they were sitting next to you on a bus or moved in next door. They are Americans in every sense of the word save for having been born on this soil. So why would providing them with a path to citizenship be so bad?
