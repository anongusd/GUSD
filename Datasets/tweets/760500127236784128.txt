@kimiwillingham Amen!!!
@SarahPalinUSA He is a loser so why would he not?
@vahousegop @dbongino @VAHouseDems This is the most heartbreaking thing that can happen. I dont understand how anyone can think this is right or a good thing.
@mauidiver1 @jonhsanders2 I dont think she has passed but at home in bad condition. If she had passed they would say so. Whats the deal with conspiracy on this? Theres not always a conspiracy just because you dont hear abt someone.
@RealSaavedra @MissyJo79 Why when she can easily give birth and let the baby out for adoption. I just dont see the sense in late term abortions.
@PastorDScott @NomadsWife6973 That is so true! I guess i am fair game!😂

@faiththruhim Prayers
@kbeamsde @conserve_hope @LindseyGrahamSC Your duly elected congress wasnt so duly elected. California and texas have proven that voter fraud was prominate in the last election. I bet if all states checked their voter registrations it would be the same.
@seanhannity So then she is gonna put millions out of work? How is that gonna help. She doesnt have the sense God gave a goose!
@summitlci @JosephNSanberg Exactly! Instead of expecting the gov to take care of u for the rest of your life!

@RyanAFournier Just a political stunt to show they are still witch hunting our president. Such a shame that 2 yrs later he is still trying! Hes gonna end up looking stupid no matter what he tries!
@RyanAFournier YES! Glad someone other than me is willing to say this in public. I wont be politically correct and will always take a stance for what we all know is true. God made man and then a woman. Period!!!
@SarahPalinUSA Before long these other countrys will have no one left cuz they are all coming here! We have to stop this now. We cant afford to keep funding the illegals!

There will be no wall cuz they will keep it in courts to stop state of emergency. He has to come up with something or 2020 gone!

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Then get going on what he knows has to be done. Dems are stalling so they get here!
@ChuckCallesto Scary! Idk how she got elected!
@charliekirk11 We need a revote on last election! The dems won the house from voter fraud!
@realDonaldTrump @scottishlyn58 I so hope! The dems arent gonna give what u asked. If they offer anything it will be so little that its a slap in the face. I have been an ardent supporter but today was tough. I dont trust the dems and feel they are playing us and it cant happen!
@SenTedCruz Are u nuts? They have no incentive to do that now!
@SenTedCruz Now no wall. Glad u are happy cuz we are not! U know the dems wont give what pres wants!
@realDonaldTrump if ur party cant fight with u then change to independant and watch ur base go with u!
@LindseyGrahamSC U sir have cost him part of his base by helping persuade him to make this move. We feel like ww have been kicked in the gut after fighting with him all this time. Our party has let us down over and over. Swamp that needs to go!

@RyanAFournier Plus the 5 flakes in the party that wont vote with us!
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I did but he needs to do what he says. Yes his party has let him down so maybe he should run as independant next time. Guarentee we would all go with him. Repubs are letting us down.
@RepJohnYarmuth 1 person had a bad remark and u lump pres and all the rest in! Just like the party of opposition!
@senatemajldr @POTUS Time for u and all the rest to go home!pres has tried to give to us but his own party cant stand behind him! If he runs in 2020 he should run as an independant and we can all leave ur party!

@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer So disappointed in all of u! If the repubs had done their job when in power we wouldnt be here now. Plus now u have caved to dems knowing they wont give what we the people asked for. No one is looking out for us!
@SenToddYoung Its a joke!!!
@gatewaypundit Oh like she does? Thats a joke!
@seanhannity It wont do him a bit of good! They will stop it in the courts and the wall will go away. President blinked, now its over.
@SenJohnBarrasso @POTUS U kmow the dems wont, they will never give him even a partial wall. All of this was for naught cuz trump caved!
@RealJamesWoods He let us down! Its all on him!!!

@barbelincc @SarahPalinUSA @Pkrbkrmary Myself? No i dont, i just want the wall built so we dont have to take care of thousands of people who come here illegally!
@senatemajldr @JeffFlake Glad the scum is leaving!
@realDonaldTrump Its ok, we all know the truth and that they are just out to get you!
@WayneDupreeShow I congratulate the president for making this decision, especially now seeing them all cry like babies over it.
@barbelincc @SarahPalinUSA @Pkrbkrmary Well most of us dont care if we pay for it just so its there. Anyway you and i dont know what our president has in store for mexico.
@GOPChairwoman Liberals dont want us to confiscate the drugs. Lets face it most people who use have to be liberal cuz to conservatives its wrong.
@seanhannity The truth will.come out
@charliekirk11 There you go!!! We can live with that!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I think they saw that the other day and hopefully we can get it done before they take the house.
@jasoninthehouse We all knew it was and now they are.gonna get cohen to lie to hopefully get out early. cohen is a snake and a liar, they shouldnt even be taking his testimony!
@seanhannity Love our 1st lady
@BretBaier No you dont! You always have more anti trump people on your show than those who like him plus, there is never anything good said about him. Its alway the bad and ugly. Thats why i cant watch you anymore and its a shame cuz i have watched that segment since Brit!
@d3t3rmin3d_22 @mscharliegirl75 @khill643 Prayers!!!
@mitchellvii @AlecCurrier @HillaryClinton https://t.co/HdCeTFTULw
@BretBaier You are a trump hater and its obvious in your show and when you are on other shows. You are NOT fair and balanced!!! Do you get it now?
@bgood12345 @destinysimon We cant let this go. There needs to be an inquiry and then charged with the crimes they commited.

@JohnJHarwood @JackPosobiec Their all fools. We are living better now than we have in a very long time but they dont care. Its all about what they want not what is best for the country! I hope they fall flat on their faces!
@Lrihendry Yep!
@conservmillen Ansolutely disgusting!

@TomiLahren @foxandfriends BUILD THAT WALL!!!
@SarahPalinUSA @Pkrbkrmary Just shows that they will do anything to keep trump from fulfilling campaign promises.
@The_Trump_Train @MitziRummel Absolutely!!!
RT @The_Trump_Train: RETWEET if you support shutting down the government for strong border security and a border wall.
@marthamaccallum Why is he leaving us to fend without anyone that can amd will do what he has? We the people need him to stay.
@dbongino Good luck with that! If they made it here "on their own dime" (not), they can make it back.
@dbongino I am sick to death of all these assinine people!!!
#VoiceSaveMakenzie
@mitchellvii Cant, there are 2 many off them!
@RealBasedMAGA https://t.co/bjUI1pfbcC
@mollyday15 @colleenrasmuss Ansolutely disgusting to change our Lords prayer. I for 1 wont pray it any other way then how Jesus prayed it!
@dbongino Loved it!!!
@RebekahWorsham @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Hand raised HIGH!
@Ocasio2018 You my dear, have spouted out so many untruths and stupid comments that no one trusts you!
@SebGorka Got to hide what they want to say! Idiots!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump True!! Problem is we all know it anyway they just cant see it!
@BretBaier Hey Brett you have alot of followers, just pick 1 of them.
@seanhannity With u Mr President!
@brithume I knew they would buckle! If all you nay sayers would let our president do what his gut tells him, there would be no stopping us!!!
@SebGorka A crazy uncle they hid in a bedroom.
@RebekahWorsham https://t.co/B2OgDi2QwY
@kathylarue76 @realDonaldTrump Stunt? Did u see those that came in illegally? The family who came so her baby would be born here and become a citizen, therefore they have a path to citizenship? Plus countless others! Are u hiding under a rock or just 1 of those who hate trump and dont care if they come in?
#ChrisSarahGraceDuet
@RealDrGina @AlecCurrier Good one! I think thats the smartest thing i have heard in awhile.
@JackPosobiec No. No one in the media or on the left will ever give him credit. Sad state that our country has gotten in.
@RyanAFournier Yes lets and if trump is impeached then sens the rest packing. Drain the swamp
@SaraCarterDC @Comey @JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Lets use every breath we have to fight the leftist idiots and keep trump now and vote in again in 2020!!!
@SteveScalise @AlecCurrier @realDonaldTrump Too many are getting in right now and it needs to stop. We as a nation dont have the means to fund these illegals, we dont have the space in our schools for their kids and we dont need the criminals that are coming! Stop it now!!!

@partord @ShepRose @Zigbee2 @dbongino Its called southern charm.
#southerncharm i will no longer watch your show because of the disgusting tweets shep rose has made today and have tweeted them and making sure i help get it out to the viewers.
@paulsperry_ @SebGorka They both should be charged with obstruction. They knew it was a crime but all but covered it up
@scruffchick @sdebbieharris @MonicaCrowley So sorry for your loss. I am a wife of a vietnam vet who came home but wounded for life. Thankful to your father for his service and to him and your family for paying the ultimate price for our freedom!
@ShepRose You wont when you dont have your show to get your name and face in the public outside of charleston. The people there think your an idiot who lives off family money and doesnt have a clue as to what life is all about.
RT @dbongino: He’s not kidding. This is how liberal America really feels about you. Save this tweet. Look at it often. And when 2020 comes…
@ShepRose @Zigbee2 @dbongino Well well well, cant wait to send this tweet around the country. Lets see how many of your shows veiwers (myself) watch the show again. Sorry, but you may have doomed it. I, like so many arent what you tweeted us to be!
@dbongino Cant wait to see this in the history books!
@realDonaldTrump We are living what you have accomplished, and loving every minute of it

@brithume @BretBaier This guy should have to testify under oath
@SebGorka @Ocasio2018 Tell me how did this nitwit get elected! Is there that many clueless people in her state that couldnt see the writing on the wall?
@RealJamesWoods I am with you.! Nut jobs, all of them!
@sdebbieharris @MonicaCrowley I would like to think all americans would stand for our flag if they knew the story, just hopeful thinking. You are right tho, us military families will always respect our flag.
@realTylerZed @SebGorka @RealKyleMorris I did, we will see. I pray your generation can run this country but right now i dont have much hope.
@MonicaCrowley Gives me goose bumps. If these so called nfl players knew the story of the star spangled banner and how our flag waved all the way thru the battle, maybe they would repect it more. I could only hope so!!!!
@IngrahamAngle Should not be allowed. Someone must get the answers however they can. Tired of these people who do crimes getting away with it.
@SebGorka I certainly hope so, but guarded when it comes to him.
@charliekirk11 Those in the sanctuary city should be arrested and jailed for releasing him.
@brithume Dont believe it! Cohen is sayinh anything mueller wants him to in order to get a lighter sentence!
@dbongino I agree! Havnt watched any news bit fox for a few years. If fox continues on its course, wont watch it either. They arent fair and balanced like they tout.
@charliekirk11 @Ocasio2018 @DonaldJTrumpJr Idiots!
@dbongino You are exactly right!!
@seanhannity No daca deal!! We the people dont want it
@LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Never and we need someone to lead the justice dept and make sure it happens! How about Trey Gowdy?
@SebGorka @BarackObama @LarryOConnor Love it
@SebGorka @JohnBrennan This shows it was all a "collusion" to get trump! How about we go after all involved and put them behind bars!!
If my followers can see this, my twitter got accidentally deleted and i have lost all of you. Please follow me again.
If you can read this, you’ve helped me reach 10 followers. Thank you!
@b_resistant @richardmarx Its obvious you are all a bunch of trump haters. We, who didnt like obama for 8 yrs didnt act like immature 8 ur olds through out his presidency. your all probably gonna jump on me for my tweet and prove my point.
@SebGorka She probably was mad cuz her husband was staring at Melania!
@DineshDSouza I dont think he cared!
@dbongino Absolutely ridiculous! How many hundreds of yrs has these sayings went on? I dont know anyone who ws hurt over these.
