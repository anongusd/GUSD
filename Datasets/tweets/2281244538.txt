@RckyFshr @SharenB82395760 @ChuckCallesto Exactly
@RckyFshr @SharenB82395760 @DrLeanaWen @PPFA Sad, but to true.
@WalshFreedom @AshaRangappa_ @realDonaldTrump Working on the holidays. I give it to him. He's reaching out :)
@GOPChairwoman @kamzard Simply said, Exactly. Lol We remember facts from fiction
@BoSnerdley Lol not for long in life... She old ASF. Lol
@enews Lol his last name ( Spacey) is beginning to fit his actions lately
@shanedkavanaugh @Cernovich That's sad tho... Ruthless world these days
@politico That's sad too.... If we didn't have lawsuit happy people in the world? Most could be given away to useful resources that be happy to take it to help others
@adobemama @SharenB82395760 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I agree. Lol In a basic home too. Nothing filthy rich style.
@pavingstud27 @SharenB82395760 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump We lock our doors at home, businesses, set our alarms on vehicles and homes, phones, tsa security at airports, u.s custom's checking cargo and more and so on... But border security is emotional?! Brainwashed at it's best
@Amy_Siskind Lol Stay tuned
@NancyPelosi @kathygriffin @realDonaldTrump It's personal to his voters @NancyPelosi ... The citizens who voted for a wall. Not just president Trump's agenda
@Jeffrey21839010 @MarkYoungTruth @NancyPelosi Your facts are wrong tho. Seen it with my own 2 eye's. Lol Literally
@Jeffrey21839010 @MarkYoungTruth @NancyPelosi Actually yeah. Live on CBS this morning during a interview after he hadn't gone to the veterans day memorial. He does admit wrong tho
@tictoc Lol Sounds like a typical democratic line...
@thehill Those political correctness days/ lies don't work anymore these days Schumer. Lol
@Arqahn @thehill The smirk on his face tells it all.. lol He's absolutely right up there at the top
@YNGDOME @ILoveBeinBlack True, most cases with police shootings turn out someone had a weapon/gun. Police should've tased him and broke the window to the vehicle
@HeyTammyBruce @realDonaldTrump It was afghanistan we discovered no nuclear chemicals of any kind and Iraq leader Saddam Hussain was a evil person to his people in such inhumane ways
@harris_rae @JudicialWatch Lol he's no better
@JedediahBila @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He's the worst... Lol
@RudyGiuliani Including all the drugs that come funneling in from the south... Dope, fentanyl, cocaine, ect ect
@GovRonDeSantis @realDonaldTrump Not just Florida... The citizens who support the president on the southwest of the u.s. There voices too matter
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Makes u wonder why the democratic party has such resistance for a wall many trump supporters ask/support for. It's like the democratic party doesn't care for the voters, the people and there voice/opinions?
What's your opinion folks? https://t.co/BtVVaVtM3k
@JudicialWatch Just be another cover-up for this individual... nothing sticks to these people, crime wise.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Sad to see corruption happening but the majority know the truth... The fbi leaders should be investigated. Who investigates them? Whoever does? Sucks at there job
@ABC The police have a real issue on there hands these days. The most ignorant society ever! They don't care attitude
@realDonaldTrump I just mentioned this on the last post. I remember those messages when they were aired. Of course.... they're missing now. Lol FBI is crooked
@iTweetDope_ish Absolutely beautiful :)
@realDonaldTrump Ye, the https://t.co/kVsvUD3caS. leader/director was the issue from the beginning.. he was in conlusion with other https://t.co/kVsvUD3caS agent's, trying to be sure u never became president in the 1st place... (remember the text messages that were put directly towards the pres?)
@realDonaldTrump That's what people don't understand. We want all to unite with us but only the best survive. I'm so grateful to be a born on this soil
@MarketWatch Money, all day. Lol
@joelpollak @realDonaldTrump Lol of course not, makes ya look bad to the world
@JaniceDean @BretBaier Great 1st impression for children, this is what kids have to look up to these days
@JerryPHD Absolutely. Can change the person who is greedy and can change the person with the money. Depends how grateful u are and/or how selfish u are
@UN There should be no borders but we should maintain border security backround checks for those who seek living elsewhere for the safety of citizens in each and every country wherever u decide to reside in. There are people with bad intentions in this world we live in under disguise
@MistaOowl Scumbag b*tch i say...
Wbru is where it's all America :) For all your hip hop/love touch moments
