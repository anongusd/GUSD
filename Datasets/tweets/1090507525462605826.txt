National assignment as election observer in the worst presidential election ever in Nigeria. https://t.co/raYKGA8XFi
@MiriamShehu That's the gospel truth. Number one victim of their next level my sister. He even campaign for the man.
@ProfOsinbajo Going higher with electoral fraud. What shall it profit you to gain Nigeria and lose your soul. Repent, repent and turn back.
@DeleMomodu @EniafeMomodu Dele this is not political loyalty. You have switched gear so fast to the other side of the political divide. We shall go to court. Na wao!
Don't try to impress people and you end up depressing yourself. This is amazing wisdom. https://t.co/7iwVic9Lsz
@adeyanjudeji @zakzakysupport We thank God for your life. Welcome back home comrade.
@brownbeste @segalink This is 21st century country. Kenya has embraced global standard. Unlike Nigeria where they celebrate fraud as victory.
@NaijaFlyingDr The risk she took to conceptualised FlyingDoctor is risky enough. Kudos Dr Ola.
@NaijaFlyingDr It was good you did  not join.
@akin_adesina This is really amazing. Congrats sir
@Olusegunverdict You are a blessing to our nation. You are consistent on the path of truth and a glorious Nigeria. I celebrate Segun.
@MaupeO @channelstv Congrats for the amazing fulfillment in the job. Your very best is yet to come.
@iPeng__ @EhyOwie Angels on divine assignment recover her from very wicked and unreasonable men.
@jacksonpbn This is amazing and strange to hear anyway. I just dey laugh.
@GovAyoFayose Amen sir
@atiku Don't concede defeat to a stolen mandate. We your followers are watching. We took risk to support you. Don't disappoint us.
@atiku Mr President sir, I did free election observer without a kobo paid to me, as a result of my believe in your ability to change things
@jacksonpbn I was surprised myself when I heard his first statement to Nigerians. With the mood of Nigerians, was he supposed to be careless with words?
@benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig That's the truth my highly esteemed senator sir. But Atiku was not defeated. He won the election. He must not concede defeat. PDP is alive.
@atiku My highly esteemed boss sir, you should disregard the call by peace committee that you should drop the court options. Too bad to hear
@DeleMomodu I don't understand your stand Dele. Are you now celebrating fraud against democracy. What kind of phone call are you talking about. No way!
@SweetShantel He is disgraced finally.
@samomatseye @simplyneyo He is thinking about you and your next generation. A generation sold out to falsehood.
I must state categorically that I  pity banana republic of Nigeria. Is this really a country? I don't think so. It's a state!
@bukolasaraki You remain my hero inspite of the gang up against you. You are a star that will always shine.
It's fraud against democracy
@NnennaUkeje Yes. Atiku is coming to take over.
@GovAyoFayose @MrUdomEmmanuel @OfficialPDPNig Mega congratulations Akwa Ibomites
@realFFK I think Osinbajo should be pitied. Housemates assignments is to go to the market for oga madam and not to join crucial family meeting.
@carpediemfr Thanks so much.
@marcoessomba Thanks so much.
@PrinceEmekaOko6 I wish to meet you sir.
@GovAyoFayose @O_luwatomiwa For us at Democratic Pastors Movement, we know that PMB days are numbered in Asorock. This extension is for our own good. Atikulated fully

@TaiwoBusola3 He that has ears let him hear. It's not a joke Nigerians. Be wise!
A nation built on truth overcomes travail seamlessly. Our leaders are not truthful.They have penchant for lies, falsehood and propaganda.
Truth doesn't die. Truth lives forever. Truth is as old as eternity. Truth you dodge today, could hurt your tomorrow. Stand for truth!
If Nigeria must catch up with the rest of the world, there's need to innovate in life with global standard. This is so pivotal!

@IsabellajonesCl Mega thanks. God bless you.
@ozalashe This is really amazing my professional friend. It has become a global challenge that must be fought with all political will.
@MiriamShehu So shameful that a Prof of law VP Osinbajo, has turned himself to market  boy boy buying votes with 10k. He has so relegated that office.
@MiriamShehu You are spreading the person of Jesus. More glorious grace my esteemed sister
@MiriamShehu Shalom, this is amazing. ....
@MiriamShehu I am so proud of you. You speak truth to power. You are exceptional from that part of Nigeria.
@MiriamShehu @orjikuramo @elrufai He is a desperate bigot on training. He too full of himself.
@orjikuramo Good morning highly esteemed friend. How was your night. Trust your night was awesome. Victory for Atiku is sure.
@jacksonpbn God is greater than man Job 33:12 .The same God who ambushed the enemies of Isreal is fully involved. Joshua 7:25-26
@jacksonpbn They want to silence supporters of Atiku presidency. Victory for Atiku is victory for Nigerians.
@jacksonpbn That is very strange my good friend. The truth is that, Nigerians are tired fake change. They want Atiku to fight poverty, hunger/etc
@TaiwoBusola3 My precious friend in the field of political activism. You very correct. He sold fake change promises to fickle minded Nigerians. PMBMustGo
To make Nigeria working again. Victory for Nigerians. https://t.co/qnRA9Wt6p5

@NyesomWlKE My highly esteemed people's governor there's no place for fraudulent APC in Ph. They are enemies of Nigerians. God is greater.
@farooqkperogi Fraudulent government. Deception of monumental proportion.
@farooqkperogi Are you just knowing that Pastor Osinbajo is an expert in telling lies. He is morally bankrupt to stand for truth. Deception
@k4wz Thanks so much

@SegunShowunmi Pastor Osinbajo is a disappointment to the RCCG church. You can just imagine the level of desperation of APC government.
@nissifliar It's to help rescue Nigeria from the grave consequences of PMB 2nd term.
@GovAyoFayose Governor emeritus the voice of the voiceless. It's a pity that Nigeria is a wrong hand. Our democracy is under serious threat
@comr_mayor Thanks for standing for what is good.
@Roland_speaks A nepotic president for that matter. A religious extremist and a sadist. Who value cows more than humans.
@ProfOsinbajo What you call loan is electoral fraud. What kind of loan is N10,000? In an  economy that has nosedived since APC came in.

"University certificate without skill, kills inherent potentials".  Skillfulness is key to fruitfulness and personal growth.
@OgbeniDipo It is a deliberate plan to by this government, disenfranchise Nigerian students from 2019 election.
We cannot involve into a great nation, as long as we play dirty politics with entrepreneurship development practically. That's the truth!
Economic potential of Nigeria is huge. All that is needed, is pragmatic and visionary leadership to drive the vehicle. Leadership challenge!
A country that plays nepotic/tribal politic, cannot drive an all inclusive economic growth and development. Global economy is merit driven.
Nigeria democratic process is under serious threat. We cannot shy away from this truth. Good governance has eluded this nation practically.
@NaijaFlyingDr Nigeria economic backwardness is largely a function of mediocre leadership. You can't give what you don't have.
@LadiSpeaks God bless you.
@LadiSpeaks Wishful thinking.
@NaijaFlyingDr That's so serious.

@Pippin143 Happy Birthday.
Our transformation as a nation will be elusive, without transformational leadership. People with transformed &amp;  nationalistic mindset.
We need a leader at this stage of our nationhood, that will regig our economic growth and productivity optimally. This is so pivotal!
Entrepreneurs has an exceptional eye for opportunities that will we add value to the society. They drive economic growth and development.
What Nigeria as a country needs now, is a detribalized &amp; visionary leadership to reinvent the wheel of governance &amp; our battered economy.
@sam_adeyemi Happy supernatural birthday to an exceptional builder of men. Glorious manifestations awaits you in the years ahead sir.
@NikeAdeyemi Happy supernatural birthday to a strategic man of God with exceptional grace to build men. We love you passionately.
To transform Africa, to meet up with the rest of the world, entrepreneurship development must be at the front burner of policy formulation.
I am passionate about entrepreneurship and youth development. To me, it's an obsession to see Africa youths grow entrepreneurially. TEA
The beauty of life is in knowing Jesus Christ as your saviour. Don't waste time anymore, make a personal decision to follow Jesus Christ.
@chosensomto Fraudlent government
@JodiSte Are you as passionate as I am in entrepreneurship development? You are the kind of person I need to drive my drive my dreams.
@gabomin That's uncommon determination to a course.
There must be a policy framework, that's consistent with entrepreneurship development in line with globalization. This is key to growth.
I am of the opinion, if Africa continent must meet up with the rest of the word, we must embrace entrepreneurship development frontally.

@DeleMomodu You are very correct wise one. Atiku has the mental capacity to drive his policy framework for a working Nigeria.
PMB is a tribal extremist.
Our university students are home on strike for months for 20 billion naira issue. PMB signed 91 billion for cattle ranching. I pity Nigeria.
That's the absurdity of the matter my law. He has nothing to show.
