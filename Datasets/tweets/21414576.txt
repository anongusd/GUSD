Nixon resigned the presidency for lying about ordering &amp; covering up Watergate.  		Cohen will testify that Trump ordered him to cover up affairs that would have sunk his candidacy and, like Nixon, lied about it. 		Will Rs hold Trump to the same simple standard they did Nixon?
Michael Cohen was Deputy Finance Chairman of the RNC &amp; VP of the Trump Co. right up until last summer.		It’ll be interesting to see if any of today’s questioners address him as “Mr. Deputy Chairman” or “Mr. VP.”		If the tables were turned, Rs would be wrapping every Q. with it.

@TySmalls Bingo!
Yes, which is why Brett Kavanaugh has never tried a case as a lawyer in his life. 		He was a political hatchet man w/law degree for years (Ken Starr, Bush v Gore, David Brock), and then made a judge as a reward by billionaires.		Trump wants him as his get out of jail free card. https://t.co/ZbpsmKm1vn

When did concentration camps become a mainline part of America?

What everybody’s missing is that Kavanaugh pushed Starr to take down Bill Clinton using the most lurid details. 	Kavanaugh even pursued the family of Vince Foster! 	He knows how he thinks Clinton should have replied to succeed, and may now be using that strategy.

True. The only case around this was Michigan Supreme Court back in the 1920s or thereabouts - Dodge brothers vs Henry Ford. And the Court only acknowledged a need to protect shareholders' interests, not to prioritize them. Amazing how these stories become part of us... https://t.co/5Fd3VksX3U

Thanks, Gayle. And, to add to this, when people end up with "more money" because of tax cuts, it will actually CUT their lifetime Social Security, as that "raise" did not come with in increase in FICA-subject income. GOP wins twice: lower working people's wages, and whack SS. https://t.co/egSoIkCQ50
@ourlink Inflation is mostly caused by critical commodity prices (see 70s during Arab Oil Boycott).  The debate really should be about aggregate demand, also known as wages, which is what *really* drives economies.  AG/Wages have been under assault since the beginning of Reaganomics.
@Jones25Frank Thanks! Hope you have a great new year, too!
Today's GOP has been so corrupted by the #MorbidlyRich that even longtime Republican Joe Scarborough can't handle it. Mercer, Kochs, etc., don't care what kind of fool they put and keep in the White House, so long as he delivers their tax cuts &amp; deregulation. https://t.co/Ov97AehdYQ
Also: when working people get "more income" from tax cuts instead of pay raises, it cuts (inflation adjusted) their contributions to Social Security, and thus, what they'll get for retirement. How the GOP Tax Cut Will Also Shrink Your Paycheck @alternet https://t.co/ag07BVXzSb
