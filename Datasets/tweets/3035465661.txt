History will not be kind to the GOP but Millennials will suffer the most under the turbulence of the coming decades and I promise we will not let the world forget who did this.
Conservatives know they cannot win nor survive the demographic shift as a party so invested in white supremacy. Their plan to cling to power? Ruin the country's economy to the point of being able to blame Democrats for the subsequent problems they GOP has caused and neglected.
