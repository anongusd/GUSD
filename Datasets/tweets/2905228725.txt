@ankhfnkhonsu The Donmeh-west site server was damaged the host tells me. I send periodic emails to ask about it but they haven't responded recently. They told me they're trying to recover data.
Took me several days but got my account back after contacting Twitter many times because they locked my account politically harrassing me immediately after Bernie Sanders announced his run. I broke no rules &amp; they lied to me saying I did.

@satinfirefly @realDonaldTrump Anyone who goes to his page can see he said it &amp; everything we're saying. For YOU to lie so blatently in full view in a surveillance-State is awesome &amp; says everything about you &amp; what you stand for. All you do is help Trump look worse by doing that so keep it up. Article 1 Sec 9
@satinfirefly @realDonaldTrump Here it is again. Direct link: Check out @realDonaldTrump’s Tweet: https://t.co/hyCaNvtBTs
@satinfirefly @realDonaldTrump Also, you're not retweeting to break the chain so few will try to verify &amp; throw their hands up &amp; say 'it's he said she said' when it isn't, &amp; just go with things like partisan assumption. So YOU'RE doing propaganda. I linked to the original source.
@satinfirefly @realDonaldTrump I linked directly to the Tweet. You can't support that claim &amp; smear. YOU'RE lying because you're a partisan hack. Only way he didn't say it is if his a count was hacked. He's not saying that &amp; no one is because it's not true. YOU'RE fake news. Sad. Loser. Baby.

@justicedems @cenkuygur There is nothing Racist or sexist about a satirical Racist/sexist joke &amp; even if it were indicative of sexism then 18 years later there's no evidence of it. In other words these are lies &amp; character assasinations based on authoritarian extremism.

@MichaelAWoodJr @mr_sticky I'm saying what I'm saying. They're not scientists. There are no scientific run outlets. They reference &amp; promote science all the time.
@MichaelAWoodJr No you just slander them as if they were Bannon-esque propagandists, which is unsupportable. Interviewed Joe Manchin, townhall for Stein etc

#TYTLive Genocide is not killing many people it's pursuing total annihilation by various means of a people.

#TYTLive Please tweet on this hashtag if you're blocked from viewing the show live only seeing black screens with running timer but no show
#TYTLive Worst kind of 'bug' is a post weekend one which prevents TYT live views on both streams. Although deadly scorpions are not fun.
@JaycenD #TYTLive keep talk about it on the hashtag so the 'bug' talk is public. Hopefully that will get it fixed more quickly
@JaycenD #TYTLive not workin. Just streams black screen forever with timer going but no content. This kind of bug will drive down live views
#TYTLive my first try was at 6:03 pm est. No luck at all. Streams steam a black screen only which will drive down live views. Sabotaaaage?
#TYTLive Both streams are suddenly blank with no content streaming. If this is happening to many it will drive down online view metrics.
@SkreetGil I used to live in Santa Cruz, helping to "keep it wierd". Right near where the boardwalk in Lost Boys was filmed.  = P
#TYTLive Love you all! Even when we disagree. Shared the telathon link with /go link &amp; note from Cenk to 30 groups thus afternoon!
#TYTLive If we outspent the next 5-6 instead of 7 top military spending countries we'd free up $100-200 Billion &amp; would still be dominant.
#TYTLive So while less or no foreign defense spending is legitimate, singling out aid to Israel as too much is not.
#TYTLive We outspend the next 7 top military spending countries combined, including for 800 bases in 70 countries https://t.co/LdpDHNletJ
#TYTLive Aid 2people in 96% of the world's countries about $33 Bill total but our military budget is $500-600 Bill https://t.co/uDaRBabsij
#TYTLive Aid 2people in 98% of the world's countries, Israelis are a fraction of the 1-2% of total Federal Spending. https://t.co/uBGFEsrrsd
#TYTLive pro-Israel lobby is 26th not top $. &amp; Foreign aid to help Israelis is a fraction of 1-2% of Fed Spending https://t.co/3dtprLbnws
Most importantly, the flagship, California https://t.co/nQMV5BSqPz
#TYTLive You both r awesome. Ana kickass beyond words. #QueenTrollSlayer  It's still a dangerous narrative to say all Racist Trolls are kids
#TYTLive Cying wolf hurts Muslims almost as much as Drumpf. Thx 4mentioning violence against Jews. This pogrom falls on us all.
#TYTLive thanks!
#TYTLive streaming but can you turn up the volume a bit?
#TYTLive teaching your audience to ignore voices like mine is MILLIONS-DEAD-WRONG
#TYTLive Our culture is the market. Haters are the fireworks. Fail to take it seriously &amp; you will have mass death eventually
#TYTLive Posturing as fearless this way, saying haters online are all just powerless kids is MILLIONS-DEAD-FUCKING-WRONG. Culture matters
#TYTLive Take the fireworks market of trolling ideas seriously. It's not just a kid thing. Filters explode with hate all the time GODDAMN IT
#TYTLive Ignoring &amp; mocking as strategy will help them rise. A non threat will not be stopped just like in 30's Germany:Millions-dead-wrong
#TYTLive Spencer said "conquer or die" 4a reason. Hail victory is seig heil. Not trolling. Bannon their hero will be chief propagandist
#TYTLive They said conquer or due for a fucking reason. Hail Victory is Seig Heil &amp; Alt-Nazi hero Bannon is about to be Chief Strategist
#TYTLive ignoring me &amp; the haters doesn't protect you or anyone at all. This is ultimately not about bullies. It's about pogrom engineers
#TYTLive Ignoring the haters as no threat risks millions of lives. They are being installed in top government areas. They are not children
#TYTLive Non-violent political fighting must happen now. Fight the haters. They have their heroes Bannon Flynn Sessions etc incoming. METEOR
#TYTLive They said Hitler was just a clown. Online hate explosion is a sign of a sick rise. They're in the Whitehouse with Bannon. Fight
#TYTLive Ridiculing Hitler allowed him to take power. Take this seriously. Haters online are not all children. Millions-dead-wrong.
#TYTLive We've already not avoided those beginnings so if you say they're just powerless children we will not avoid those ends.
#TYTLive Muslims targeted by pogrom engineers going into the Whitehouse. Alt-Nazis am have their heroes among them. Not children. Government
#TYTLive Messaging that all haters online are to be dismissed as children with no danger puts us all at risk. Haters are in power.
#TYTLive Cenk's millions-dead-wrong. Neo-Nazis Alt-Nazis KKK are on the rise &amp; have pogrom engineers in the Whitehouse aiming at Muslims 1st
#TYTLive Silence, no likes, shares,  speaks volumes as Jew hate continues to rise even on the left (mostly unconscious). Even on TYT.
#TYTLive Nobody tries 2exterminate Asians. Neo-Nazis pursue annihilation of Jews &amp;group #s almost doubled in 3yrs https://t.co/LgHzp3mIDV
#TYTLive The cultural refusal 2focus on Jew hate has enabled the rise of Alt-Nazis/Richard Spencer &amp;their hero Bannon, unconsciously.
#TYTLive It is among the most politically incorrect things to talk about Jew hate. That's part of why they have their hero in the Whitehouse
#TYTLive It's hater bias 2think focus on Jew hate in Bannon even in addition, instead of on other types then to drop it, is selfish or off.
#TYTLive It'll never b selfish, tho is politically incorrect, 2talk of Jew hate that could lead 2pogrom after Muslims through Bannon
#TYTLive 2suggest Jews R selfish &amp;none should highlight Jew hate in the Whitehouse in connection 2Alt-Nazis &amp;Neo-Nazi extermination is bias
#TYTLive Other hate must have equal time &amp;focus even tho zero groups want all Asians dead? When Alt-Nazi hero Bannon is in the Whitehouse?
#TYTLive Believing Jews run all &amp; all world problems come from Jews results in pursuit of annihilation but Jews &amp; others are never to say so
#TYTLive Bannon's &amp; other dog-whistling to Jew-haters into the audio spectrum is part of why people like the KKK try to dirty bomb cities.
#TYTLive Pitting Jews against everyone by claiming 2much focus on JewHate or not instead of only talking about other hate magnifies JewsHate
#TYTLive Thinking Jews are selfish by any focus on Jew hate in Neo-Nazis gaining Whitehouse power by Bannon, ignoring context is bullshit
#TYTLive Bannon's Richard Spencer's hero. Neo-Nazis don't just hate Jews equal 2other groups. Doesn't matter what we think but how they act
#TYTLive Asian hate isn't less bad. Jew hate in Bannon IS more dangerous because of possible extermination goals &amp;believes of total control
Muy bueno! https://t.co/oriwwCdzLm

#TYTLive Me too. Hope they'll Make Notice Great Again with highly visible start time next to the member stream or live stream on the website https://t.co/peVO4PqcQq
#TYTLive Anyone catch when Old School is on? If I miss it I'll flip out. Even though I can catch it when it's uploaded, since I'm a member.
#TYTLive JR-ated self-censorship? "Racial supremacy". No, it's WHITE supremacy. That's the problem. Let's not let them rebrand at all.
#TYTLive Doesn't matter what u believe. They believe all problems come from us. They believe Jews have most power, hiding extermination goal
#TYTLive Even Jews are rallied toward camps, registration, &amp; their own annihilation attempt by fear&amp;hate of Muslims. Neo-Nazis all Jews dead
#TYTLive Muslims will be mass-slaughtered soon. White supremacists are infiltrating law enforcement see official FBIhighly redacted reports
#TYTLive If you're saying to yourself that's a paranoid selfish Jew you're ignoring History &amp; are infected with stereotypes that serve them
#TYTLive The meteor can't be messaged away. They will change laws into weapons &amp; cause culture to change while camps &amp; slaughter are planned
#TYTLive It's a real meteor, not a fucking illusion of fringe few. Real powerful white supremacists are taking power. Muslims will die 1st
#TYTLive Bannon, Flynn, Sessions have real power with people like Clarke under them. You cannot shame away the pogrom engineers
#TYTLive Nazis were not stopped in Germany by shaming &amp; minimizing as their hero's &amp; pogrom engineers were about to take power.
#TYTLive The non-Jewish bubble will kill millions. You can't ridicule &amp; minimize &amp; shame white supremacists in government &amp; police away.
#TYTLive Did it just cut out to break during the show for a really long time or is that a phone problem on my end with buffering?
#TYTLive Drumpf's Admin. IS the meteor but #NoDAPL is a huge part of fighting them. It will show we CAN fight &amp; win &amp; cover their insanity.
#TYTLive Promoted #NoDAPL coverage, despite being forced2work 12 hrs/day, spreading phone#'s&amp;Petitions b4Drumpf's win. Now back on board.
#TYTLive Yes, doubling down on #NoDAPL is ITSELF a political attack on Drumpf &amp; his Alt-Nazi/pro-David Duke pogrom engineers. Donating.
#TYTLive I was wrong. Double down on #NoDAPL! It is ITSELF a fight against the pogrom engineers of the Drumpf Meteor about to hit. Donating!
#Bernie2020 https://t.co/tHnxc6A8Qh
#TYTLive Yet another reason why Ana kicks all fucking ass. She points at the meteor. The White House pogrom engineers etc.
#TYTLive Meteor: All libs&amp;TYT staff focus on DAPL brutality caused by FBI reported factually existing white supremacist infiltration of cops
#TYTLive Meteor: public says shut up Muslims/Jews, DAPL brutality more important than White House pogrom engineers. 'Ghost skins' win.
#TYTLive Meteor: all Racism&amp;brutality matters except millions 2B camped &amp; slaughtered by White House pogrom engineers Muslims/Jews &amp; more
#TYTLive Meteor: Alt-Nazi Bannon Chief Propagandist takes Drumpf's right hand with pogrom engineers, DAPL distracts https://t.co/6cImDQhVyH
#TYTLive Meteor: all libs focused on other Racism &amp; DAPL brutality intentionally caused by infiltrated white supremacy as they take W. House
#TYTLive Meteor: All libs focused on DAPL brutality &amp; other Racism as pogrom engineers take over White House &amp; FBI asserts infiltration https://t.co/p8iyQQTfmT

@timostweet @bassomar_omy Ah the clever (((  ))) echoes, code 4 marking Jews! Gonna call me a cuck from mommy's basement too?
@timostweet @bassomar_omy Actually now that Drumpf is thoroughly losing I'm full blast against her corporatist warmongering undemocratic ass
@bassomar_omy Night
@bassomar_omy Bullshit. You simply WON'T see it.
@bassomar_omy ...&amp; the fact that he's willing been on Kevin Barrett's Jew hater among other things show
@bassomar_omy ..&amp; the paraphrasing of things in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion &amp; David Duke
@bassomar_omy I pointed out the dog-whistling &amp; what's in the TYT &amp; Fusion articles &amp; the blog dates he deleted on dates cited in them...
@bassomar_omy I'm not saying anything villainizing about you, but I am criticizing your arguments. I'm pointing to what Baraka has said/done
@bassomar_omy Your pop psychologizing parroting people to dismiss what I've said, supported, &amp; what Baraka deleted on only the dates cited
@bassomar_omy You're only talking about the shakier ones &amp; mostly not the content
@bassomar_omy I said he doesn't deny the Holocaust Barrett does
@bassomar_omy Villainization of me over &amp; over
@bassomar_omy Showing my anger on my face is not a threat against you
@bassomar_omy I linked to the TYT &amp; Fusion article also &amp; you could compare his speech to PotEZ &amp; David Duke &amp; the TYT interview w/Duke
@bassomar_omy I think ud see the real outrage if we were face to face. You wouldn't say that. But assuming that, based on nothing is typical
@bassomar_omy No, I don't want to continue. You're totally closed to anything I have to say or to what I'm supporting. Stop with links? Fine
@bassomar_omy MY FAKE OUTRAGE MOTHERFUCKER?
@bassomar_omy No I linked to one article among many. What he says is paraphrases of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion &amp; David Duke
@bassomar_omy When Fox news is right has no relation2its 95% (fake stat4 argument's sake) propaganda content. True or not is the question.
@bassomar_omy Totally irrelevant to his dog-whistling claims about his being "controlled by dominant forces" &amp; being a servant of "settlers"
@bassomar_omy Irrelevant to anything I was talking about. You agreeing with Baraka on everything but what I'm saying is just slimy pivoting
@bassomar_omy This lists him as being on the show &amp; Barrett is a known Holocaust Denier https://t.co/7rUQXBdCw9
@bassomar_omy Suggesting I'm crazy? Jews on the left are "‘paranoid,’ and ‘manipulative’ are assumed to be liars." https://t.co/ZM2ECKqXuG
@bassomar_omy here's the link The Daily Beast article on the show he went on https://t.co/fWumYFtWdo
@bassomar_omy Here's the Fusion article a also didn't tag you on by mistake https://t.co/mu6CQYHJhY
@bassomar_omy It cites support for all it's claims. Here's the TYT report link I didn't tag u on by mistake https://t.co/1bp3SNgZHC
@bassomar_omy Saying David Duke's a Jew-hater doesn't require talk about helping Palestinians. Same goes 4talking about Baraka's hate.
@bassomar_omy ((( ))) Nothing I said has anything to do with what you suggested &amp; nothing to do with you changing the subject
@bassomar_omy Don't have 2talk bout Palestinians when I talk about Jew hate of a Jew hater. That's insane/unfair. Not obvious. That's a lie.
@bassomar_omy  You did villainize me with your assumption. I'm talking about the actual villainous things Baraka has said &amp; done.
@bassomar_omy No, not funny. U made a claim I don't care about Palestinians, based on what? My name? I supported my assertions about Baraka.
@bassomar_omy U try 2change the subject &amp; paint me as a villain 4saying anything protective about Jews/Israelis as if I exclude Palestinians
@bassomar_omy In other words you believe Jews &amp; Israelis shouldn't be protected only Palistinians. I agree with Bernie's both-sided stance.
@bassomar_omy I'm posting cuz of reactions like that. Who was talking about that? Ur tryin 2villainize me. We were talking about Jew hate.

#TYTLive @DrJillStein Asserting "kids shouldn't be subjected" to WiFi isn't data lead but fear &amp;rumor lead rhetoric. What if you target ppl
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Jews can hold policies &amp; speak rhetoric that harms other Jews without being at all antisemitic, correct? You vs Bernie

#TYTLive @DrJillStein TYT Baraka pick report https://t.co/1bp3SNgZHC
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why did you pick Baraka when he paraphrases Jew-hater pogrom propaganda like The Protocols of the Elders of Zion?
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why did you pick Baraka when he said Bernie supporters support 'European white supremacy'?
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why did u pick Baraka when he called Bernie "controlled pseudo-opposition", 'servant of "settlers", echoing David Duke
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why were the "A Voice From The Margins" blogs on the dates cited by the TYT report &amp; Fusion reports on Baraka deleted?
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why don't u know diplomacy &amp; peace is being even-handed, like Bernie, &amp; being one-sided is the essence of escalation?
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why don't you know leading the world against Israel &amp; encouraging International economic &amp; law assault is from the30's
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why don't you understand trying to force anything on Israel only inflames resentment violence &amp; hate? One-sided = WAR
#TYTLive @DrJillStein Why choose Baraka just after asking Bernie to run Green instead? Vindictiveness &amp; instability, given his Bernie hate?
#TYTLive Why Baraka when he called Bernie "controlled pseudo-opposition"? When he'd gone on a Holocaust deniers show twice?

@idea_jon What does this mean?
@idea_jon Attacking ppl like me, not me specifically, enable it to grow. Goddamn character limit.
@idea_jon Not slandering Stein ppl by saying JewH8 among the awesome majority is growing. All attacking me for saying so enable it to grow
@idea_jon Btw, David Duke says he doesn't H8 Jews. Most try to hide in many ways. My experience is not a lie BC it differs &amp;u don't like it
@idea_jon Jew hate rising in the dark. Desai's TX mass murder attempt in Nazi Swastikas. JewH8 so politically incorrect no one will admit it
@idea_jon Didn't say MuslimH8 isn't rising. It is MORE in open ways. You haven't seen it among Stein support doesn't mean not growing there.
@idea_jon I didn't say what you want me to have said in order to dismiss me so fuck off.
@idea_jon My point is Jew hate rises on the left as well. There're many awesome Stein supporters who are nothing near Jew haters
@idea_jon Yes. Being Jewish doesn't mean you can't hold views, distribute rhetoric, &amp; propose one-sided targeting that harm Jews

#TYTLive Duerte not Marcos said to protect the next generation Hitler's work must be finished, still gets support because 'just one crazy'
#TYTLive Downplaying Duerte's pro-Hitler Jew hate TYT refuses to report that is what it is, downplaying Desai's Nazi attempted mass murder

@apsychefriends sounds horrible
@apsychefriends twitter is difficult for this subject because of so few characters allowed. Not following. Can you post that in 2 tweets?
@postabsurdist It's more politically incorrect for me to say this than it was to say what they said. No one said anything to them
@postabsurdist https://t.co/iNk9qfhQQh
@postabsurdist Easy to believe that in this culture but all their behavior was pro Stein &amp; their profiles were. That was their only negative
@postabsurdist Not an attack on u. Happened &amp; keeps happening &amp; it gets deleted because it's vile so it grows in the dark.
@apsychefriends The 1's who abused u might b like Nazis. I oppose them 2 if so. Hell they might have been literally Neo-Nazis for all I know
@apsychefriends I said don't speak for me.
#TYTLive https://t.co/iNk9qfhQQh Jew hate rises on the left &amp; right worldwide. So I can't support Stein. Her VP pick says David Duke things
#TYTLive in the last two weeks 2 Stein supporters told me Hitler was right &amp; b4 that "all Zionist Jews should die" &amp; "all Jews must die"
#TYTLive Stein's ok but pursues Israel in global court, boycotts (1930's style) sanctions &amp; many supporters tell me they want Jews dead.
#TYTLive I'm not treating you badly for not also being against the whole psychological profession. Reforms are needed. I support that. https://t.co/dPojjJVBHM

@apsychefriends I hear you. Keep tryin to get your issue heard. As a Jew, since our extermination's still pursed that's my current top fight
@apsychefriends #TYTLive 2 Stein supporters recently told me Hitler was right. B4 that 2 told me they support her toward our extermination
@apsychefriends #TYTLive Talkin about the story, NOT TYT, not the right-wing. Jew hate rises globally &amp; it grows in the dark on the left too

@apsychefriends Riiiight. That's the cultural norm: talk about anything but Jew hate, which is more politically incorrect than hating Jews
#TYTLive If you don't care about Jew hate but all other forms or how Jew-haters are seen, don't call yourself a Justice- minded progressive.
#TYTLive Don't care if Jew-haters are seen as bad people? 1930's: boycotted Jewish businesses lead to Hell. 5 million non-Jews slaughtered.
