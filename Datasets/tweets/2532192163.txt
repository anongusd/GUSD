@onechickentim @JoelNoBrexit @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson After so many years of right-wing Tory rule, Blair would have probably been seen as a leftist to many.
@JoelNoBrexit @onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson The Labour party have put forward an ammendment for a second referendum, but they didn't have the numbers to pass it. They are not necessarily a pro-Brexit party.	There isn't time for a second referendum at this stage regardless 🤷🏻‍♂️
@JoelNoBrexit @onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson They may have, but not in the right areas to gain seats.

@onechickentim @JoelNoBrexit @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson You're not taking the tribal nature of UK politics into account.

@onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Anti-Semetism in Labour should be eliminated, as should all forms of discrimination in every party. But don't you find it strange that there is so much media coverage over Labour anti-Semetism, but such little media coverage over Tory Islamophobia?
@onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson The Chakrabati report of 2016, an investigation carried out by mainly Tories, found that Labour "is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism."
@onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson I never said that there isn't anti-Semetism in the Labour Party, but that it also exists outside. We should look to tackle "anti-Semetism", not zero in on "Labour anti-Semetism" and ignore it from other sources, as some do.

@onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson Research has shown that there is less anti-Semetism in Labour than in the general society. Of course Labour anti-Semetism should be dealt with. But so should the vast majority of anti-Semetism which is non-Labour.

@onechickentim @DreadfulKata @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson anti-Semetism has been dealt with, and is continuously being dealt with in the Labour party. The same should be occurring with Islamophobia in the Tory party.
@DreadfulKata @onechickentim @PSBal7 @DrRosena @jeremycorbyn @BorisJohnson True, many Labour left-wingers continued to support Labour through the Blair years.

@Irishjoeshelton 1. Not when there are civilian casualties.	2. Many have. Some hold the attitude that Churchill won the war almost single-handedly.
Others say that we should forgive him because of the part he played in World War II, some are of the belief that he won it single handedly.	1. There are no winners when it comes to war.	2. Without the US and USSR, the Allies would have been crushed.
Some people believe that Churchill was a great man. But great men don't have the same racist and white supremacist outlook as Hitler. Nor do they commit atrocities against the Irish and Indian people.

People's identities shouldn't be up for discussion in this way. We don't have these discussions regarding race, sexual orientation, etc. So why have them about gender? Should we invite David Duke and Mike Pence on next week? Live and let live.	#TurnOffPrimeTime
And I won't tell the whole story, I'm sure you've already heard it from someone more reputable than this 20 year old Irish keyboard warrior. The short is that "Glinner" is a transphobe who doesn't deserve a platform; particularly from the state broadcaster @rte.	#TurnOffPrimeTime

The people may vote deal.
The people may vote no Brexit.
The people may vote deal.
Theresa May might decide that Brexit will not work and choose to rescind Article 50, cancelling Brexit. This is seen as a dangerous and by some undemocratic choice.
An alternative deal agreed by parliament may be put up against no Brexit.
An alternative deal agree by parliament may be put against no deal.
May might decide to scrap her deal and put no deal up against no Brexit.
A People's vote may pit May's deal against no deal.
A People's Vote would be likely to pit May's deal against no Brexit.
Canada+ (or some variant) has also been mentioned, although is unlikely to command a majority.
Parliament may remain in deadlock, resulting in a no deal exit.
#Norway+ (or some variant) may be looked at. However, the approval of Norway is necessary. And the EU don't seem particularly willing to negotiate. Article 50 would have to be extended.
This is unlikely, as it will damage both parties in the long term.
This is unlikely to be to much avail, with no current majority for it in the Commons.
Labour may work with the Tories to help pass her deal.
A cross group of MPs may work together to look for a deal that will get through parliament.
Labour may choose to continue pushing for a Lexit in vain.
Labour may choose to change tactics and begin campaigning for a People's Vote.
The Lib Dems will likely campaign for a #PV, but they are unlikely to get anywhere near enough seats to win a majority.
The public may choose to rid themselves of Brexit altogether.
Lexit will occur if chosen by the electorate.
The deal will likely put a Lexit deal up against no Brexit.
If Labour fail to win a majority and rely on the support of the likes of the SNP and/or Lib Dems, it is possible that a People's Vote may be necessary.
If #Labour win a majority, Article 50 will likely be extended and Labour will look to push through a form of Lexit.
Given that the #Conservatives can win a majority, MPs will likely feel obliged to pass May's #deal.
The #Tories will likely include May's  deal in their manifesto.
Labour would likely include a #Lexit strategy in their manifesto, along with a raft of radical #leftwing proposals.
Unfortunately, Labour's vote of no confidence looks likely to fail.
To pass, support from the DUP (who have indicated that they will continue to back #May) will be essential.
Labour will likely press ahead with a vote of no confidence, in an attempt to make #JC4PM and to #GTTO.
However, she looks set to lose by a large margin, possibly up to 250 votes.
#Labour could use this moment to seize power by calling a vote of no confidence.
If the deal passes, the #DUP  are likely to withdraw support of the government.
Although unlikely; May's deal could pass.
Predicting all of the potential #Brexit solutions is of comparable difficulty to doing the same for #Bandersnatch. However, I will try...

@IzzyKamikaze @aoifemasters16 Is one enough? The others are still alive 🤔
@LuckyHeronSay As an Irish observer, I hope you stay. I acknowledge the dangers in both pushing ahead with Brexit, and the dangers of pushing ahead with a second referendum.
@LuckyHeronSay If leave wins again then the UK would have to leave on whatever deal is specified on the ballot paper (presumably May's)
@LuckyHeronSay I'd imagine to have a People's Vote you would need Labour to back it (still possible if no confidence motion fails). If all parties back remain being on paper (except Tory's and DUP), if there are about 10 Tory remainers there could be a majority. Article 50 would be extended 1/2

@sherlock_ps @StefanMolyneux You can't prove a negative. But you know this, you're just attempting to be ignorant. There is literally more proof that would indicate the existence of the Yeti or Loch Ness Monster than there is of any "God".

@CollieMac2 It probably would be more of a party ideology, no single party state or any of that.		Policies such as rebalancing of wealth, living minimum wage, 4 day working week, nationalisastion of utilities, social equality, increased power of workers in companies, etc are all considered
@CollieMac2 We're not ready to remove capitalism entirely anyways, but it could do with some reigning in. I'd see myself as more of a UK Labour style Democratic Socialist, or as John McDonnell said, "socialism with an iPad".
@CollieMac2 I don't support Chinese or Cuban politics, but they both have greater youth vaccination rates than we do. So if they exist in communist countries and capitalist countries, they would likely also in socialist countries.

@YorkshireLad_87 @CalParrish Labour backed remain in the last referendum 🤔 Whilst all anti-Semites within Labour should be removed, some claims are wildly exaggerated. Apparently Noam Chomsky is an anti-semite now, despite being a Jewish man 😂	And when did Corbyn ever praise Putin? 🤔

@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan He's not a Brexiteer, if you want to fight those, look towards the Tories. Pretty sure he wants a two-state solution, but keep it up with those lies 🤷🏻‍♂️
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan You only have the word of every other politician also 🤷🏻‍♂️	And by voting Green, you're taking Labour votes and helping the Tories to stay in power 🤷🏻‍♂️
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan There is no people's vote, that isn't important right now. I'm sure when it does come about he'll campaign for remain again.
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan Because leftist Labour voters hate being lectures to by the establishment. If Corbyn had joined with them during the campaign, leave would have likely won by a greater margin.	And maybe he's trying to keep the party from splitting? People's vote is still on the table.
@a_leesha1 I don't know what a samosa is, but if you're taking out all the yucky vegetables then you're doing it right 😂
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan Then why did he vote for and campaign for "remain"? 🤔	The EU is a neoliberal organisation that should be reformed, not destroyed.
@AOC Given the chance, Trump would likely implement all the policies that Neo-Nazis stand for. He's no better than they are.
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan He'll back once a no confidence motion against the government fails, and he'll support remain if he Tories call a People's Vote.	He's an EU-reformist.
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan How did he undermine the Remain campaign? I presume he wanted Article 50 triggered because that's what the people voted for. He said that Brexit had to happen for the same reason. And a People's Vote is still on the table.
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan I'm not as I live in Ireland, but I love all of his policies bar Brexit. And what do you think Corbyn wants regarding Brexit? 🤔
@OwenJones84 @TrueFla When did you leave the Guardian and join the Independent? 😮😂
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan Labour will likely back remain eventually. But a referendum initiated by them will have little chance of passing. Better to leave that dirty work to the Tories.
@YorkshireLad_87 @jeremycorbyn @RFCdan A lot more than before Corbyn became leader; membership has increased dramatically since 2015. Membership fees are also at an all time low. How else would you propose Labour make it's policy?	And stop with the Momentum conspiracies.

@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC It's actually 6th 🤷🏻‍♂️ And anyways, we have one of the highest costs of living in the world 🤷🏻‍♂️
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC Some places are even worse.
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC It is a disgrace for a first world country like Ireland to have ANY poverty. Everyone should have the right to a comfortable life.
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC I'm sure the 790,000 disagree with you. It's not prosperity when it's only for the 1%, 5% or 10%, or even 50%. Wages haven't even returned to pre-bust levels yet.
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC Jordan Peterson is an idiot 😂
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC Really? What about the 10,000 homeless? The 790,000 in poverty? 250,000 of those are children. And what about the boom/bust cycle?

@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC You haven't shown me any data. Nice (incorrect) assumption. And if I were so "highly impressionable", wouldn't I be agreeing with you? 🤔
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC That is not the definition of populism.
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC I'll probably be the one posting it on my page, you'll likely be the one coming up to me as always 🤷🏻‍♂️
@WilliamMcilh1 @OwenJones84 Then the title is clickbait-y and misleading, which is possibly worse 🤷🏻‍♂️
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC Renua advocated a flat tax in the last election, yet I've never seen you agree with that? 🤔 And back in Eisenhower's days, taxes were a lot higher than 70% on the richest...	Also, what do you believe populism to mean? 🤔
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC Well so have many economists with left-wing economic views. Ocasio-Cortez herself has a minor in economics 🤷🏻‍♂️
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC No, I'm just repeating what you implied 🤷🏻‍♂️ And populism is a term with no substance.
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC What's your expertise? 🤔
@Johnhargroves @JunkScience @AOC You are. If you weren't, we'd all be paying 0% tax.

Why don't @fiannafailparty and @FineGael, put their (negligible) differences aside and form a proper government? Or if unable, let us choose a new one? I see no other reason for the "Confidence and Supply Arrangement" other than to protect the vote share of each parties.
@ainefromderry 1. Ex UDR ≠ UVF	2. Proof?
@JustinBarrettNP @fiannafailparty @FineGael You certainly could.

@unitedireland7 Funny how people always refer to my age when found out 🤔
@unitedireland7 Research has been done, all found is "One of the security staff who is told on the video that he should be ashamed as an Irish man can be heard replying that he is British". 		This really does not equal UVF membership...
@unitedireland7 That's a no.
@unitedireland7 Guess you don't have a reliable source so 🤷🏻‍♂️
@unitedireland7 Look at my tweet, I AM NOT DEFENDING THEM. Just don't like it when unproven fabrications spread. If it's actually true, you'd have a reliable source 🤔
@Mappermick I'm guessing you have a reliable source so?

@CalJamieson @VestIreland @BenGilroy11 @bengilroy @ddi @Jimcorrsays And I would believe a global government may work someday. Where the richest pay substantially more tax, to fund improved infrastructure and quality of life for those in the third world, and try create economic parity.
@CalJamieson @VestIreland @BenGilroy11 @bengilroy @ddi @Jimcorrsays Regulation is important, but borders aren't necessary for its implementation. And Ireland does have borders regardless.	I'd be more in favour of binding world agreements with regulation protecting fair trade and and working conditions (no sweatshops, etc...)
@CalJamieson @VestIreland @BenGilroy11 @bengilroy @ddi @Jimcorrsays I believe globalisation should be done differently, in a way that helps the third world rather than exploits it. Isolation is not the answer.

If it were an actual people's movement, the people would have a say. The likes of closed borders, "Irexit", banning of abortion and fluoride removal won't be far behind...
@CalJamieson @VestIreland @BenGilroy11 @bengilroy @ddi @Jimcorrsays The people reading out the demands, the admins of the Facebook group. Apparently they have links to some other group called Tiger Reborn also. This movement is not one that is truly led by the people.
@CalJamieson @VestIreland @BenGilroy11 @bengilroy @ddi @Jimcorrsays 1. The leaders of this movement don't have the best interests of the Irish people at heart. I'd imagine they have altered motives.		2. The discriminatory language used by the leaders of this movement discredits it greatly.

@john_mcguirk You're saying that statements from non-political people are not allowed to be criticised. 🤔
@rowanwcroft You trying to be some Irish Alex Jones or something? 🤔
@eoinyk Fianna Fáil's role in this Dáil is akin to that of abstentionists. Maybe I would have some sympathy for Mícheál if his party actually took part in this government officially, was proper opposition to the government. But not for sitting on the fence and doing nothing.
@PadraigTuite @philipoconnor If those who support women's rights are trying to get laid by women, are those who don't trying to get laid by @RonanMullen?
@u2rshite @AitheantasEire Nope, I would see them as different. Renua and Irexit Party would be more right-wing, Identity Ireland and National Party more far right.
@u2rshite @TheLiberal_ie I like to get a broad spectrum of views, that's why I follow so many. Unlike yourself, with your likely far right echo chamber...
@u2rshite @AitheantasEire Moreso left-wing.

@KazzJenkins Looks increasingly like a 50/50 between no deal and second referendum from this side of the Irish Sea.
@thedsggroup @mr_pyper @OwenJones84 This would be a vote with definitive options on the table. Last time there was no clue as to what the deal would be. There won't be a round 3.
@thedsggroup @mr_pyper @OwenJones84 The people who were 16/17 last time would be 18 and eligible to vote in a new one.	I would advocate a two question referendum. One asking leave/remain, the second deal/no deal if leave wins.
@Raphael_Hogarth @OwenJones84 Two separate questions:		•Should the UK leave the EU?	—Yes/No		•If the UK were to leave the EU, should it do so with a deal?	—Yes/No
@thedsggroup @mr_pyper @OwenJones84 No, there are other reasons to hold another vote too	• 16-18 year olds didn't get to vote before	• No polling indicates majority for a hard Brexit	• Alternatively, no deal will get through parliament	• We still don't know what the final deal shall be. People should vote on it

@thedsggroup @mr_pyper @OwenJones84 Anyways, the Brexiteers vote was carried out before the full impact of Brexiteers was known, with the the likes of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson dishing out lies to the people.	If people still want Brexit after knowing it's real impact, won't they just vote for it again anyways?

Many of those who say that Atheists shouldn't celebrate Christmas, don't even know it's origins. The tradition of 🎅 alone borrows from Paganism, Coca-Cola,  Dutch, Swiss and Belgian folklore, Puritanism and Christianity.

@liam_xrp @zaibotzu @AitheantasEire There is no "mass immigration" in Ireland today.
@liam_xrp @zaibotzu @AitheantasEire Where a person is from doesn't define them.		And I'm sure that you agree that Normans added to Irish culture. They "changed Irishness" in a way. Who's to say that today's immigrants can't have such a positive impact on society?
@liam_xrp @zaibotzu @AitheantasEire Actually, you are wrong. The first human presence in Ireland occurred in about 10,000BC, the Celts didn't *MIGRATE* here until around 500 BC. Add in the Normans who arrived in the 12th century and you already have a nice mix...

@Pink_Babe @czarkaztik @gemmaod1 You can't say that I am not a feminist, if you aren't one and don't know what one is yourself.
@Pink_Babe @czarkaztik @gemmaod1 And your source for that definition is?
@Pink_Babe @czarkaztik @gemmaod1 Also, being a woman does not necessarily make one a feminist. Misogynistic women do exist.
@Pink_Babe @czarkaztik @gemmaod1 Feminism is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as the following:	"the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes"	Sounds like a movement for everyone to me!
@czarkaztik @gemmaod1 And if feminism was left to the what I suspect you'd associate with, "pro-life feminism", Ireland would not be a nice place for the women of this country to live...
@czarkaztik @Pink_Babe @gemmaod1 Gemma O'Doherty is no feminist, if that's what you're implying...
@czarkaztik @gemmaod1 What has this to do with the topic of the OP? 🤔
@aoifemasters16 @playfulghost_ @gemmaod1 A teacher said that in my old Catholic secondary school too.

@john_mcguirk There should be no church hospitals in a secular country like ours should be. Religion doesn't belong in public services.
@john_mcguirk By the church having influence over the Irish healthcare system they are having an influence over people's lives. You are contradicting yourself.
@davidkirby2097 @philipnolan1 @KeithMillsD7 Or that holly, ivy and mistletoe were originally used in pre-Christian times to help celebrate the Winter Solstice Festival and ward off evil spirits and to celebrate new growth *shakes fist in solidarity*

In the run-up to the 2010 UK General Election, the Liberal Democrats promised to eliminate third-level fees.⁵ After entering into a coalition government with the Conservatives, fees were trebled. 8/11
And no, Ireland is not the only place where centrist parties carried out so-called populist policy. Or worse again; indicated that they would, only to let their voters down. 7/11
Promises that were intended to gain the support of the ordinary people by giving them what they want. Did the ordinary people get what they wanted? No, of course not. Only austerity. At least some "populist" parties actually follow through on their policies. 6/11
Yet it was Fianna Fáil's give-outs that in part led to the destruction of the Irish economy.² And when Fianna Fáil were booted out of government, Fine Gael and Labour rose to power in a historic coalition, promising the world.³ ⁴ 5/11
It's not as if the parties of the centre-left and centre right don't offer token policies that are  intended to gain the support of the ordinary person. In Ireland, the term is often used to describe Sinn Féin, or small parties at the fringes of Irish mainstream politics. 4/11
Why are the parties of the centre not labelled in a similar manner? Why aren't the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May and Angela Merkel seen as populists? 3/11
Populism: "political ideas and activities that are intended to get the support of ordinary people by giving them what they want."¹ A label often used to describe politics of the right and sometimes of the left. The common use of this word doesn't quite make sense to me. 2/11
Populism. For many, the likes of Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Marine Le Pen spring to mind. For others it may be politicians such as Jeremy Corbyn, Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What do these two groups of politicians have in common? I'm really not sure. 1/11

@challoner_joe If it's one of your tweets the sky is the limit...
@challoner_joe @RenuaGalwayEast Yes. The mainstream media (MSM, Times, Sun, etc.) support the conservative establishment and oppress leftist views.

@challoner_joe @RenuaGalwayEast Seriously? You act as if MSM attacks the right when it actually does so to the left? 	Crime needs highlighting. Not specifically migrant crime. One doesn't commit crime simply because they are a migrant.
@RenuaGalwayEast @kburnskburns Someone sounds triggered and it's not me 🤔		And you do quite often as I've already mentioned...

@RenuaGalwayEast No @RenuaGalwayEast. Where exactly am I saying that? Stop twisting my words.		What I am saying (and you know I am saying this as I literally did a minute ago) is that you highlight migrant crime but are silent over non-migrant crime.
@O_Cearbhaill @RenuaGalwayEast Just because something is illegal doesn't mean that it won't happen...		And even so, why would men have superior qualifications to women? 🤔
@RenuaGalwayEast @BryanOS @FreeSpeechIre The report shows that this is not the sole reason...
@TonyNewgent @RenuaGalwayEast I condemn all crime. However, Neil highlights migrant crime only.

@RenuaGalwayEast What exactly do you even mean by "virtue-signalling"? Is it one of those "buzzwords" that you're always on about? 🤔		No. Just no. You are trying to paint all migrants with the same brush here, implying that they are all criminals. This is not fair.

@holdencaul @IrishTimes You didn't answer the question, quit dodging.	So, do you agree with same sex marriage? 🤔
@holdencaul @IrishTimes So you don't agree with gay marriage? Why? 🤔
@holdencaul @IrishTimes Why would one campaign against gay marriage? 🤔
@holdencaul @IrishTimes By sensible people I mean people who will let others live freely if their decisions have no impact on their life. 2 men getting married has no negative effect on your life.
@holdencaul @IrishTimes The difference between Irish parties is marginal? Read the manifestos of Renua and PBP and come back to me.	SF are not the same as FF and FG. SF want higher taxes on the rich, a living minimum wage and student fees phased out. FG and FF do not.
@holdencaul @IrishTimes Same sex marriage is supported by sensible people across the political spectrum. Fine Gael TDs had a free vote on abortion. Immigration in Ireland is hardly unlimited. However, a two-tiered health system and a 12.5% corporation tax are conservative policy.
@RenuaGalwayEast @RenuaGalwayEast no you have not. You have chosen both options, which contradict one another. Feminists do not want special treatment, only gender equality...
@RenuaGalwayEast Nice question-dodging @RenuaGalwayEast, you really are a walking contradiction. I'll ask it a 5th time as you refuse to answer properly. I'll make it easy for you. Are you (a) a feminist and do believe in gender equality or (b) not a feminist and don't believe in gender equality?
@holdencaul @IrishTimes Fine Gael are a conservative party, not left-wing...
@RenuaGalwayEast So you insist that you are not a feminist, yet agree with the dictionary definition of feminism?	So you disagree with the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes? You are contradicting yourself @RenuaGalwayEast...
@RenuaGalwayEast No @RenuaGalwayEast, this is the official definition of the word. You cannot rewrite the dictionary as you see fit.	If someone claims to be a feminist but doesn't preach gender equality, then they are not a feminist.	And how exactly does feminism demand special treatment? 🤔
@RenuaGalwayEast Feminism: the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. (Courtesy of Merriam-Webster)	@RenuaGalwayEast, you cannot believe in equality without believing in feminism.
@MickMurphy_MM @RenuaGalwayEast @liberty_and_dem @FelipeMurrelli So my opinion is inferior because I have red hair? 🤔 At least I show my face 🤷🏻‍♂️
@RenuaGalwayEast So @RenuaGalwayEast, so you don't believe in gender equality? 🤔
@RenuaGalwayEast @liberty_and_dem @MickMurphy_MM @FelipeMurrelli You do realise that a social democracy utilises a mix of socialism and capitalism? 🤔
@VPolstoy @BrendanHowlin @labour Bot
@cmpnwtr @PpollingNumbers @Harris_X_ @ScottWRasmussen @auto_alliance @NRFnews Maybe it's an attempt to make Republicans go out and vote 🤔
@SnookerJudge @EuropeElects Saying that socialism leads to communism is akin to saying that conservatism leads to fascism...
@SnookerJudge @EuropeElects I stand more for democratic socialism than autocratic communism...
@SnookerJudge @EuropeElects I've argued with enough delusionals who believe that the Nazis were left-wing; I'm honestly not bothered to explain this again...
@SnookerJudge @EuropeElects She is far-right, socialism is to the left...
@GillibrandIan @jc4pmfbpe98 @EuropeElects Well I can't see the CDU remaining in power, or any of the other parties doing business with AFD
@GillibrandIan @jc4pmfbpe98 @EuropeElects I'd imagine the left parties would create a coalition along with the FDP to prevent the far-right from getting into power

@ReginaDo There is a big difference between "a member of a chat group which a Sinn Féin TD is also a member of", and a "Sinn Féin chat group"...

@RightWingFenian @EireEbunoluwa If she lives here, and feels as if she is Irish just like the rest of us, why should you be allowed to take that away? We are a beautiful diverse country, and bigots like yourself shouldn't be allowed to ruin this.
@RightWingFenian @DeetSupreme @67neil @rtenews Exactly. I don't support Antifa either, violence has no place in politics.
@RightWingFenian @EireEbunoluwa @RightWingFenian just because someone doesn't look like you, doesn't mean that they are not Irish.
@RightWingFenian @67neil @rtenews And just because he failed to implement his transphobic policy doesn't make him any less transphobic 😂
@RightWingFenian @DeetSupreme @67neil @rtenews And the official name of North Korea is Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Names mean nothing.

@RightWingFenian @67neil @rtenews Have you seen all the sexist, racist, transphobic comments he's made? As well as this he has banned transgender people from the military and attempted to prevent people from ethnic minorities from registering to vote.
@RightWingFenian @67neil @rtenews They would be with a right-wing government. Think Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Adolf Hitler...
@RightWingFenian @67neil @rtenews Nothing. But they shouldn't be given preferable treatment over others.

@RightWingFenian @67neil @rtenews It will lead to a government which cares about certain people, whilst pushing others; often those who are already marginalised, aside.

@WilliamQuill @MichaelDHiggins @seangallagher1 Same this time. Polls were before Casey's comments on travellers and all that followed.
@powernator62 @RosePatrice6 @MichaelDHiggins @LiadhNiRiadaMEP I really hope he isn't 😅
@itaryan @RosePatrice6 @MichaelDHiggins @LiadhNiRiadaMEP @MichaelDHiggins benefitted from a 25% swing himself in the last election, so you never know...
@RosePatrice6 @itaryan @MichaelDHiggins @LiadhNiRiadaMEP I'm actually rather far-left; I didn't vote for Casey, just worried.
@WilliamQuill But 7 years ago, @MichaelDHiggins was 15% behind @seangallagher1 with 4 days to go. He won the first count by 10%; a 25% swing.
@RosePatrice6 @MichaelDHiggins @LiadhNiRiadaMEP I'm afraid young people are more likely to vote for more liberal candidates such as @MichaelDHiggins and @LiadhNiRiadaMEP. Twitter would underestimate the right-wing vote of Casey.

I will be voting @MichaelDHiggins for #aras18 He is someone who's views are similar to my own, plus he knows the job in hand, unlike many of the other candidates. @LiadhNiRiadaMEP gets my number two.	Just please don't vote @CaseyPeterJ 😅
6. Ireland is becoming a modern, secular republic and a yes result would be a symbol of the #SeperateChurchAndState movement.	7. Irish embarrassment on the international stage has occurred in the past as a result of this law (eg. Stephen Fry case)
3. Media censors itself as a result of this law.	4. It is ridiculous that I could be find €25,000 if I criticise religion and enough people are offended.	5. There is already legislation in the constitution which prevents religious hatred.
I will be voting yes in #blasphemyref today, because:	1. Foreign governments quote Irish blasphemy laws to defend their own, leading to the death of people from religious minorities and Atheists.	2. Free speech needs to be protected. All ideas should be open to criticism.
