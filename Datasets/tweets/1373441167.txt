3) He teared up speaking about his daughter. I wanted to give him a tissue, but you can't pass things thru the border wall.		Anyway, that's my way of saying Barajas (&amp; all of his supporters) definitely worked hard to get to this happy news.		Welcome back!	https://t.co/6siu3KpUuZ
He wore his military uniform on a summer day. There weren't any pro-immigration events going on that day. He was too interesting-looking to avoid.	I was immediately struck by 3 things:	1) He spoke In. Perfect. English.	2) He wouldn't let me go w/o knowing abt "banished veterans."
Barajas has never given up advocating for deported veterans like himself. 		I know because I met him in 2014 when I was in San Diego's Friendship Park, which sits on the U.S-Mexico international border line. I noticed him standing on the Mexican side of the border wall, waiting.
Hector Barajas @Banishedveteran, a deported military veteran, will be allowed to come back to the United States to attend his citizenship ceremony. This is heartwarming news for sure, but in my opinion, what's more incredible is his story of perseverance.		https://t.co/6siu3KpUuZ

I am, however, VERY HAPPY that you two are bringing awareness to the "good immigrant" and the "model minority" myth. As I've written before, I agree that's very damaging!		https://t.co/qiP5rzkL5Q
In fact, I try not to write about "valedictorian Dreamers." Regardless of academic success, I try to highlight the broad array of immigrants out there, including voices from beyond Latin America. See:		https://t.co/P1Jr2syLeO	https://t.co/OtV53uSNip		+ years of other TP pieces.
You also pointed out that I'm a Dreamer. Yes, but I'm also a journalist, a waffle lover, etc. Was there a point? If anything, being a East Asian Dreamer means I defy the model minority myth, in turn making me very aware not to rely on "good immigrant" stereotypes.
Like you, I find it gross when people focus on the "good immigrant." I similarly find it gross that we call farmworkers "low-skilled" labor. Operating heavy machinery and doing backbreaking work is not "low-skilled" imo!
As I also made clear in my post, Mirai and Chloe are Americans and we should steer clear of "other"ing and "hyphenating" them as anything other than that.
Under Trump's immigration promises and based on what I was able to find at the time of reporting, it's possible Mirai and Chloe's parents wouldn't have been able to come into the country because Trump emphasizes a certain kind of "merit" and "skill."
My piece, which I'm glad it appeared you read, had nothing to do with the "good immigrant" narrative. I did indeed use the example of Olympic athletes' parents to poke holes into President Trump's immigration proposals, however.
Hi @ireneehsu and @zhang_sharon, 		I'd like to weigh in on this piece you wrote since you cited me as someone who used the "good immigrant" narrative.		For reference, your New Republic piece: https://t.co/jUeBNJ9wRu	For reference, the ThinkProgress piece: https://t.co/0jXmtjXuCQ

@thegarance I can kind of answer this question because I, too, have had the same thought. I've personally heard about repo guys come in at the bank's behest.
Anyway, Paige: I respect your excellent reporting but I cannot in good conscience let your tone-deaf tweet stand. While I wish what you said was true, I also can absolutely tell you that President Trump's words and policies trickle down in a very insidious way to his supporters.
What ultimately confuses me about your tweet is that you cover healthcare. Like...you must interview people affected by Trump's policies. If not, ThinkProgress has you covered: 		https://t.co/E2WGJQs5UE		https://t.co/qCBRjqiRqb		https://t.co/mUV9AV0bD4		https://t.co/uafH2LVN1H
I'd also give anything not to experience blatant racism that time we were at an ICE CREAM shop in Michigan and these guys with two TRUMP-PENCE flags strapped to their truck rolled down their windows to shout "CHINK." (seriously unoriginal slur by now).		[I just wanted ice cream!]
As a woman in an interracial marriage, I would give anything not to have to squeeze my husband's hand tight when we're at a glass factory and a man wearing a MAGA hat comes inches from me just so I can hear him call me a Chink (again not from China).
As a journalist of color, I would give anything to not receive hate mail from readers telling me they hope Trump will deport my "yellow ass" or "dark" "cockroach face" to China (where I'm not from) or some other Asian country (close enough).
Hi Paige, I strongly disagree with your take. 		As an immigration reporter, I would give anything to not have to interview a weeping immigrant or U.S. citizen on a routine basis or to find out that yet another asylee had been locked up for days in solitary confinement.

Oh right. You're still stuck with me. We're going through my mind museum's terrific gift shop, guys. There's only one item: A shameless request for you to donate to @thinkprogress so that reporters like me can continue to bring you news about Dreamers.	https://t.co/MqgAmDrOmx
And peeps, those stacks of stories that resonate so much with Dreamers? They're also your neighbors, friends, cashiers, child's teachers, favorite reporters...		@NancyPelosi's speech today is inspiring. What would be more inspiring is if Congress enacts permanent protections.
Final exhibit for now: 2018. 		As Dreamers - and the undocumented pop continue to hide - today @NancyPelosi stood for 8 marvelous HOURS reading stacks of trees filled with stories about openly undocumented Dreamers. All of these people have merit. All of them are skilled.
2017. DACA ended* and Trump admin won't allow DACA extensions of people whose statuses expire after March 5, 2018.		*Sort of. A federal judge allowed DACA kids to continue renewing their applications for now.		With ICE arrests on the rise, Dreamers went back into hiding.
2016, the longest year ever for reporters, happened. Now-president Donald Trump won. He threatened to take away DACA. 		A reversal happened. Dreamers wondered whether to reapply for DACA. Advocacy groups advised them not to. 		https://t.co/t2NlcszAV7
DACA recipients became more openly undocumented to get people to understand how crucial the program is to America.		A 2015 @amprog study found DACA could grow economy by $230 billion over 10 years.		(As a whole, not very "lazy," she said w/a wink.)		https://t.co/OYjrQYCSB3 https://t.co/FtpORoRekC
Hold on tight (not to me please). We're traveling at warp speed now to 2015. 		A lot more DACA recipients publicly came out as undocumented. Why? Republicans were actively trying to dismantle the DACA program. (Dreamers looking at some of you House Republicans like...) https://t.co/2D2YlTEDw4
Esther note: I didn't know any Dreamers until 2013. 		(Hi!) https://t.co/l4azevSrML
Next exhibit. June 2012. Then-President Obama announces DACA.		More Dreamers -- some of whom are DACA eligible -- became openly undocumented. They might as well. They're giving all their information to the gov't from the time of "initial entry to present."
Then, because I'm rushing through my mind museum, let's land this time machine in June 2011. New York Times published @joseiswriting's piece about being undocumented.		https://t.co/zjP6nxRXKG		Like WHOA! An openly undocumented, accomplished immigrant. Still, most Dreamers hid.
It made sense for Dreamers to hide. 		In some cases, colleges accepted students -- HEY, based on merit and skill--, but when int'l offices sorted thru visa issues, they took back acceptances.		(narrator voice: 10/10 not at all traumatic. Looking at you, schools in VA+MA) https://t.co/FoJIEVdivm
Between 2001 and 2011, some brave Dreamers made themselves heard to lawmakers who didn't really care. They wore graduation caps. They organized. They walked hundreds of miles.		(Note: Not all Dreamers are valedictorians, though all the Dreamers I know have merit and skill.)
For years, the Dream Act failed in Congress. It was like an annual disappointment for Dreamers. Think Christmas, but in reverse. 		For years, the vast majority of Dreamers hid in plain sight.
Dreamers have been around for a long time, but it was really in 2001 that they got federal attention from Sens. Durbin and Hatch who cosponsored the original DREAM Act, for which these immigrants got the name. (Thanks Tereza Lee!)		Here's that bill: 	https://t.co/6cqZszSt2A

@SaraLang @NancyPelosi Very same!

A personal anecdote: When @vlfleischer and I were there for 4-day reporting trip, a border agent pulled us over for questioning. He looked thru our B-roll. He let us go. He then followed our car. 		We did nothing wrong. He was polite enough. But the encounter startled us.
Border security also comes in the form of more federal agents. To live in Las Cruces is live under hyper-surveillance.		“Being a U.S. citizen in the borderlands, being a brown U.S. citizen in the borderland means that you will consistently have to prove who you are.”
The community of Chaparral is unique. A 2-lane highway divides  it into 2 counties: Doña Ana County (seat: Las Cruces) + Otero (seat:Alamogordo), where an interior checkpoint exists. Undoc residents here are too afraid to access resources. 		https://t.co/wiLrD7Egtl
That means people like Brandon, DACA recipient and lifelong Las Cruces resident, feel “trapped” in this city because they’re afraid of checkpoints. Brandon’s DACA expires in May, putting him at risk of deportation if he comes in contact w/border agents. 		https://t.co/Vg7nDhwxsS
There are something like 140 or so of these tactical checkpoints along the southern border, most of them permanent structures with border agents and hyperactive drug-sniffing doggos. 		(Photo credit: some pretty interesting government report on interior checkpoints) https://t.co/lvlR91X0dw
Border security for border residents come in many forms. Interior checkpoints lie on highways west, north, and east of Las Cruces. At these checkpoints, border agents can ask for immigration status. If undocumented, you could be at risk of deportation. 		https://t.co/wiLrD7Egtl

@jbreisblatt Ah. Yes. Correct.
@jbreisblatt Quickly glancing, but 92 percent appears to be from immigrants w/criminal convictoins post-Trump (page 3). I think 73.7 percent is from FY2017 overall.
Homan: Says 92 percent of arrests come from immigrants w/criminal convictions, but 8 percent comes from collateral arrests in sanctuary cities. 		Huh.
Homan: "There's no population off the table. If you're in the country illegally, we're looking for you."		Watch presser here: https://t.co/xJC2QoMQ0c
Homan: "Why would we not want to build a wall?" Says it's a "wise investment" because crossings went down "everywhere we built a wall."
Homan: "We arrested more criminals this year than last year so that takes wind out of sails from people who say we don't focus on criminals."
Q for Vitiello: Why need for border wall if border crossings down?	Vitiello: "We're not just asking for barrier, we're asking for inc. situational awareness." Says "good #s are down," but needs to "accelerate those gains" and to "prevent future problems."
USCIS Francis Cissna up now: Calls for ending asylum abuse and turning to merit based immigration system.
Vitiello: Says CBP is now more "transparent" about use of force tactics. Report shows officers used firearms 17 times this year (decrease from last year), but used "Less-Lethal Device and Other Less-Lethal Force" 979 times (increase from 943 times last year)
fentanyl*
Now up: Acting Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Ron Vitiello: Fetanyl seizures went from 2lbs in FY2013 to 1,500+ lbs this year. 👀
Homan: Says arrest numbers are "impressive in spite of" "sanctuary jurisdictions" (localities that choose not to detain all suspected undocumented immigrants for potential deportation proceedings).
ICE director Homan: Overall immigration apprehensions went up 42 percent under Trump admin as compared to same time last year. Calls it "good progress."
Man, ICE director Homan is really channeling the president at this press conference for year-end detention/deportation stats.

COME'ON. Do you know how much of an impact this would have on immigrant and low-wage commuters? Who do you think is riding the subway/ taking the bus at 4:15 a.m. to get to/from ur UWS/E Vil apts? Nannies. Janitors. Personal trainers. Line cooks. Bakers.		https://t.co/ZvBkQrx9gS

Hearing's adjourned! Red flags for immigrant advocates (as @Shugruberg pointed out in person): flagging immigrants on reasonable suspicion + expedited removal. 		Other than that, time will tell how Nielsen will be like as DHS Sec. 🤷🏻
...Annnd I just scrolled down my Twitter home page and Business Insider's "pimple popping" video began....on auto play. 		IT'S LUNCHTIME FOR SOME OF US, SOCIAL MEDIA PERSON. 🤢
@Shugruberg 😬
(let's be clear. it isn't exactly compassionate to deport kids back to murder capitals of the world, but will note DHS under Obama admin also made similar talking point on expedited removal)
.@SenKamalaHarris asks whether Nielsen agrees w/policies to expedite removal of unaccompanied minors (most from Central America):	Nielsen: "I believe in reuniting children with their families. If their families are not here...I would want to understand more about implications."
.@SenKamalaHarris now asking Nielsen abt 10 y.o. Rosa Maria Hernandez case + whether DHS still maintains "sensitive location" memo: 	Nielsen: "I do and should any further clarification be needed, I would ensure that occurs."
7) On upward trajectory of immigrant apprehensions, Nielsen: says deterrence is key + notes what DHS has been "successful at is that we will enforce our laws. It's vital that we do so. I intend to do so."
Nielsen*
6) On whether climate change is man-made, Nielsen says, "I believe that climate change exists. I'm not prepared to determine causation."
4) Niesen, on 21K DACA recipients who missed 10/5 deadline: will talk further "if there are extenuating circumstances that we should look into." [like hurricanes in TX/PR]	5)"I agree that we shld prioritize criminals and any others that are concerning from a NatSec perspective."
At Homeland Security confirmation hearing, nominee Kirstjen Nielsen: 	1) Border wall: Says no wall built from sea to sea. 	2) Asking for immigration status: Says yes to if there's reasonable suspicion.	3) DACA: "we must and owe it to them to find permanent solution."

Bad napkin math, that's ~$165/daily detention profit to jail x 7 days x $xyz for transport to 5 facilities= at least $1,155 in taxpayer $$
Nowhere in this ICE response do I see an apology for detaining and transferring Riccy Perdomo nearly every day to new facility for 7 days.
Instead of building a wall, maybe POTUS should give $$ to ICE to upgrade their computers so they have most updated detainee computer files🤷🏻
Like how did agents not see DACA renewal on her "computer file" during detention? (Also omg what is this 🦕90s cd-rom🦕computer speak.)
In light of WH considering end to DACA, could Riccy's detention be trial balloon to gauge response &amp; action plan from immigrant advocates? 🤔
