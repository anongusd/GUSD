@MaggieSchlagel You're presuming that any extra marital affairs hes had were even considered "cheating"
@MaggieSchlagel Of course not, but to be honest, nobody knows what kind of arrangement they have agreed to in their marriage. It would be likely that they wouldn't have a traditional marriage relationship, and she knew what she signed up for when she did it. I doubt that she married just 4 love.

@2020Comics @IlhanMN Lol you're criticizing what I did when it's actually what both Democrats and national polls do on a daily basis. The difference is I'm not making it because I have to sway public opinion for power.  Her statement is a bunch of BS.
Wow LOL....it doesn't sound like its true but there's really no way to tell.

@ImTheRealLaura @KamalaHarris I think the dems released the photo as an excuse to throw him to the wolves after he let the cat out of the bag on abortion. They needed an escape from having to talk about their twisted ideals on killing babies.
There is something wrong with the fact that nobody on the left cared about literally killing babies, but they're outraged about a picture from 34 years ago?! I'm trying to figure out how they can claim to always have the moral high ground. Priorities?
@LadyThriller69 True history of racism. It's important for the truth to be out there and passed on to the next generations. The idea that Republicans are racists because there's old white Male Christian's is a fallacy. The parties never "switched." The dems just disguised themselves.

@MaryKatherineM8 @SebGorka @TGowdySC Right...all these people are so quick to flip on his character. I'd like to see something before jumping on the band wagon.
@SebGorka @TGowdySC @TGowdySC has been one of my favorites in DC for a long time. I actually think he was busting his ass at getting hillary. But something was way off tonight. Not bc he wasn't saying what we want to hear, but his tone &amp; demeanor weren't right. Everything was off.

@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne We definitely have opposite views probably on many things, but it's late and I'm tired lol. God bless you and thx for the intelligent conversation. Have a good night üíô
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne Or there could be ways of allowing them to see content but not contact directly through social media to mediate what I'm sure happens to these public officials incessantly.
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne Down to. Just like more traditional ways of dealing with it.
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne I understand where you're coming from completely but the whole public official/social media thing has been an assumed adoption and not ever a discussion. So I guess instead of blocking people who are harassing and threatening they will have to press charges is what this comes
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne Correspondence and the widespread use of it doesn't marry it to the govt and people's rights regarding the govt until it becomes a govt organization.
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne No its absolutely not lol. It's his Twitter account, you aren't blocked from the same methods of communication from the government that have always been around and sufficient. That arguement is a joke. While maybe it's a discussion to be had, social media is not official govt
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne Public officials have a right to their own opinions &amp; 1a rights just like us. Whether they should or shouldn't say something is a different question. If we were to thoroughly follow your theory all the way through I think you'd see how dangerously messy the territory would get.
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne The twitter ruling is ridiculous, 1a is protecting you from being persecuted for freely speaking. It doesn't mean that anyone, everyone, or even the president has to listen to you.
@realShawnEib @SaveWildthings @jtoufas @therealroseanne No its not a first ammendment issue, it's literally the exact same issue as what I replied to, but yes, boycott away everybody. Our taxes shouldn't be paying for their stadiums for them to get rich from anyway. Pro sports are way over paid.

@jelli_potter @hungryfelix @Fozziebare @chancetherapper It's not about strength it's about hormonal imbalance and distracting from the point of the military to focus on a social experiment. I'm lgbt, my girl was in the af and both of us recognize this objectively for what it is.
@Fozziebare @chancetherapper @VP The hormones aren't level,they have other things 2 focus on besides being a social experiment.3rd reason u gave I know nothing about.But trump has never said or done anything offensive to gays in my view,i feel like that's just been lumped in with all his other accused "phobias."
@Fozziebare @chancetherapper @VP I wholly disagree with you. Pence is entitled to his opinion, many dems used to also be against gays only changed when they needed to increase their base. Trans were banned from the military not bc they aren't as strong but bc medically being Trans distracts from their mission.

@chadricsowards @Analogbear @SenSanders Do the research and then say that. They were against gay marriage, for strong border security, and deporting illegals. I can't make this shit up, and my bias can't make it true. There are records of it.
@chadricsowards @Analogbear @SenSanders Yes he did because he *had to to keep himself in power* and he only eventually gave in and voted for civil rights bc he *had to to stay in power* seriously, look it up
@chadricsowards @Analogbear @SenSanders No they wouldn't, they would be what you portray us to be today. The Republicans have always been for freedom and limited govt, and still are. It's the left that conforms to what they think will keep them in power. Been doing it for decades and still gets away with it.
@chadricsowards @Analogbear @SenSanders The Democrats now are the same Democrats they have always been. Their talking points have only changed in the last 2 years...why don't you research every one of their voting records from 2014 and prior.
@Analogbear @chadricsowards @SenSanders You're kidding me right? I realize that a lot of people think this way now, I was even guilty of it myself, but it's a misconception. Watch a documentary on the lyndon Johnson presidency and the *liberals* of his time. Please.

@bluepoet3 @ShakerScoops @SenSanders Nobody likes to be on the losing side of anything, but we all should strive to take it with grace and dignity. Not demeaning ourselves to conniving and childish behavior. What the left is doing is humiliating themselves. And they will realize it when it's too late.
@bluepoet3 @ShakerScoops @SenSanders Facts aside, my original comment to the tweet was for bernie to quit trying to make trump look bad out of resentment. All the dems are doing that &amp; it's not working, it's only making his base bigger &amp; stronger. And making them look like the pos that they are.
@Furbalicous @SenSanders Obama will go down as the absolute worst president in history. A fraud that wants to see America go down. Americans are not stuck on everything that's already happening, we are proud of the things that are in motion and going to happen. F obama, he doesn't deserve any credit.

@TheRyanWalton @Billharmon20 @chrisbSays @SenSanders Yes that seems so, we all care about our money more than trying to fix stupid people that have no minds of their own. I can actually back up that statement. Left causes the social problems, trying to fix them is pointless. I'd rather laugh at them.
@nwhitman13 @SenSanders Are you able to prove any of the fact checks in this video? And regardless, does it take away from the fact that the intention of this tweet was to deligitimize trump not correct the "facts"?

@Analogbear @SenSanders Is that so? You mean the same liberals that repeatedly voted against civil rights in the 60s? Yes, the left has always been the procurers of citizens rights. Maybe if people would stop yapping and start watching more documentaries they'd see them for who they really are.
