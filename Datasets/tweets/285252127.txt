They did this out of necessity. There is still a pervasive stigma within Iranian diaspora communities in the US that welfare is shameful. My parents never talked about it and they were eager to reach a point where they no longer needed it.
When my parents first immigrated to the US, they relied on food stamps and Section 8 housing to provide for themselves, their eldest daughter, and their U.S. citizen newborn (me).

RT @yelmjouie: Great thread. I remember those uncomfortable laughs all too well. https://t.co/XtxvfUrFaF
Suffice it to say, it messed me up a little bit. There‚Äôs an entire generation of young Muslims whose sense of identity and self is still very much wrapped up in this horrible, terrible thing.
I stopped wearing the hijab shortly afterward, mainly because I didn‚Äôt believe in wearing it, but also because the climate after 9/11 made it easier for me to turn away from Islam, while at the same time rebranding myself as a ‚Äúnormal, good Muslim‚Äù who could help build bridges.
On a family road trip months after the attacks, my dad pulled over on the side of the road for zuhr prayer. I sulked in the backseat, glaring at him from the window. As drivers on the road gawked at us, I remember hating him for having the nerve to be himself.
We planted a flag in our yard bc we were scared. We wanted to assure our neighbors that, as the only Muslim family in our small suburb in western PA, we could be trusted. It didn‚Äôt help. Some mornings we‚Äôd wake up to our mailbox vandalized or broken eggs littering our driveway.
When kids in school made jokes about me being a terrorist, I laughed with them as if I was in on the joke. It made them feel comfortable. I worried, constantly, about assuring them that I was one of the good ones.
I was in 9th grade when 9/11 happened. I remember feeling, almost immediately, like it was not my place to grieve, that my job was to make people feel better (about what happened, about Muslims). I remember explaining and apologizing &amp; not really knowing what I was sorry for.
Islamophobia has always been around (both before and after 9/11). But I think what a lot of people forget is that 9/11 changed the way so many young American Muslims saw themselves and how we unconsciously internalized a lot of that Islamophobia.
@AliaaAloha @AzitaGhanizada @nancywyuen @AmirTalai I worried about this too, but they actually can‚Äôt argue this anymore, since MAAC lobbied SAG-AFTRA to create a new MENA diversity category. It‚Äôs all in my story :)
