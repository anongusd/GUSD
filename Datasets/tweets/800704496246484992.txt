@roblesnadjuntas no thank you!
@bestfortheGOB was hoping someone would make this joke
Republicans who howled when President Obama took executive action will let Trump walk away with whatever he wants, even if it's against the Constitution. 		That's why we need to #VoteThemAllOut in 2020. #FakeNationalEmergency #TrumpFakeEmergency https://t.co/3SoL4Vu1Ks
@pr0udu5a sorry that you hate people, will pray for you
@Ima_Deplorable they still have human rights even if they came to this country illegally. "Do better."
#TrumpIsLying Obama was never planning to declare war with North Korea, but Trump  has already threatened Kim Jong Un with nuclear war on Twitter.  #TrumpFakeEmergency #FakeNationalEmergency https://t.co/DZHNi7CPHM
@pr0udu5a we never said that was okay either. We're just saying immigrants have human rights. Sorry your racism is obscuring your vision on this. Have a blessed day.
Thousands of Americans dead. 10% shrinking of the US economy. Stronger and more damaging natural disasters. 		Why hasn't Trump declared a national emergency to address climate change? #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/uv7fFBeum7
@pr0udu5a because legal or illegal, it is wrong for people to be killed in US custody.
@hrutledge24 ACTUALLY immigration has been dropping since the 90s so thanks, President Clinton!
The Trump Administration endgame: Limit LEGAL immigration (which his family benefited from) along racist lines (no "shithole" countries). 		It scuttled his immigration compromise last year with a GOP Congress. Now it's become the #TrumpFakeEmergency.  https://t.co/jKKvb9Hf7h

@ColorApril Cruel!

@ColorApril it's still wrong that they were mistreated and died.
@pr0udu5a Immigration is legal. If you don't like it, I guess you don't like America https://t.co/ICHwR1FUXH

22 immigrants have died in US custody in the past 2 years including 2 children, but Trump will never recognize them as "Angel Families." #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/P0lQJxqNUQ
It is a national emergency that thousands of children have been ripped from their families at the southern border. Trump approved it and Jeff Sessions and Kirstjen Nielsen carried it out. #FakeTrumpEmergency https://t.co/HDggp4b5nY

You don't have to yell at the TV alone. Swing Left groups all over the country are digging in to elect Democrats, register voters and stop the Trump agenda. If you haven’t joined one yet, make today the day you make a difference. #SOTU https://t.co/fJ1fAdsVVM https://t.co/nIiYhAPr5x

Of course we want to end cancer among people of ALL ages. One thing that helps: Making sure Americans are covered under the ACA—something the Trump administration has fought every day in office. Treat the kids, treat the adults, show mercy. #SOTU https://t.co/z7vCTWkWui
Ending HIV/ AIDS in the U.S. is an admirable goal. But the Trump Department of Justice has fought Medicaid expansion and the ACA, two major ways to help people with HIV/ AIDS get treatment they need. #SOTU https://t.co/3IWPzlxDRd

@yt2ak there were facts in it
There is a humanitarian crisis in border centers where @ICEGov is assaulting immigrants under their care. Why haven't we heard from @RealDonaldTrump about this? #SOTU  https://t.co/ThRaWxoANj
@Unknown1Mac you never cite a source when you do this. We always cite a source. Where did you find that number?
@yt2ak we read John Kelly's testimony before Congress
#TrumpIsLying Trump claims "countless" Americans are killed by immigrants because there are NO statistics proving this to be the case. 		In fact, immigrants to the US commit FEWER crimes on average. Every death is a tragedy, but not a political tool. #SOTU https://t.co/yufyV8OciI
@hankgolfer if you want to be a coal miner, Hank, no one's stopping you
A wall wouldn't not stop drugs from crossing the southern border, because most of it arrives in authorized shipments. Trump's rhetoric is not about our safety. #SOTU  https://t.co/iMOm0CgEHr
The Trump Administration including Kirstjen Nielsen and John Kelly used human rights to justify tearing children from their families. But 99.75% of families traveling together are related. If they're in danger, we should take them in. #SOTU https://t.co/HQk8bXI3C3
Undocumented immigrants contribute over $11 billion to the economy every year. They work, they pay taxes, they fill important jobs. 		And people are worth more than money. #SOTU  https://t.co/GodYoQjDoi

@LostEcho7 actually, weak gun control in surrounding states is the source of most illegal guns in those cities. That's why a Democratic House will address NATIONAL common-sense gun reform, which is supported by 68% of Americans.
The NRA spent over $50 million on Republicans in 2016 so Trump would tell a grieving nation that we can't do anything except buy more guns. Nothing could be further from the truth. #TellEveryVoter  https://t.co/z3ZSXJZVfk

This year the midterms are more important than ever. So grab your friends. Grab your family. Grab @KevinBacon (if you’re @KyraSedgwick) and volunteer on #TheLastWeekend before Election Day. https://t.co/ratbT5fm5x https://t.co/opw9qK913f
