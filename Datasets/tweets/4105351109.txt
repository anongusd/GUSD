RT @UMass: President @MartyMeehan announces plan to create online college for adult learners in #StateOfUMass address: https://t.co/3Vtybks…
Great to catch up with current and former @UMassLowell student trustees after State of the University! #StateOfUMass https://t.co/9NQCzTOjap
"Economists and higher education experts predict that 25 percent or more of ALL colleges nationally could close or merge in the next 10 to 15 years." via @MartyMeehan  #StateOfUMass
We must take bold, decisive steps to ensure @UMass continues to fulfill its mission of access, opportunity &amp; excellence and remains the world-class university the Saxon Commission envisioned 30 yrs ago — the world-class university this Commonwealth needs &amp; deserves. #StateOfUMass
It is time for resolute action. We owe it to ourselves, and to this Commonwealth, to lead through the coming disruption and emerge stronger on the other side. #StateOfUMass
The passage concludes: “Resolute action now can give the university the opportunity to reach its full potential.” #StateOfUMass
But I’m also reminded of another passage that starts: “We believe that the University’s leaders have at times been too timid in their advocacy, too willing to allow the very real obstacles which confront them to dampen their resolve and lower their aspirations.” #StateOfUMass
As we pursue this goal, I’m reminded of that line from the Saxon Report that this may “seem to some a radical notion.” #StateOfUMass
The time for us to act is now. It’s predicted that over the next several years, four to five major national players in online education with strong regional footholds will be established — and we intend to be one of them. #StateOfUMass
Out-of-state institutions without our same reputation for academic excellence are enrolling adult learners in #Massachusetts in the types of programs we seek to offer. #StateOfUMass
Our goal is to create an online platform with a national profile for educating adult learners. How do we know this will work? For one, because others are already doing it. And they are doing it here in our Commonwealth. #StateOfUMass
At the same time, our award-winning, campus-based programs will continue to serve hybrid and full-time online students who seek selective bachelor’s and master’s programs. #StateOfUMass
And the net revenue generated from the new college will be returned to the campuses to sustain our core mission and our broader contributions to the Commonwealth. #StateOfUMass
By offering degree completion programs, rapid response to workforce demand and customized workplace credentials for employers, we will significantly enhance our contribution to workforce development in #Massachusetts. #StateOfUMass
That’s why, over the next several months, I will be meeting with senior leadership and faculty on each of our @UMass campuses to outline a plan for the creation of a new online college focused solely on adult learners. #StateOfUMass
A concerted effort to make a @UMass education available to these adult learners is the answer to a number of issues: Addressing the workforce skills gap, meeting employer demand, improving economic mobility for Mass. residents &amp; ensuring @UMass continues to thrive. #StateOfUMass
Half of the people in Massachusetts age 25 and older do not have a four-year degree. And what’s particularly frustrating is that more than 20 percent — approximately 1 million adults in Massachusetts — have some college credit but no bachelor’s degree. #StateOfUMass
Like many states, Massachusetts is grappling with income &amp; wealth inequality as well as a troubling lack of economic mobility among certain minority groups. Only a third of African Americans in the Bay State have college degrees, and just a quarter of Hispanics. #StateOfUMass
While the Commonwealth boasts the nation’s most educated workforce, our top employers still struggle to find workers with the right skills. #StateOfUMass
After 18 months of research and study, it’s clear that our single greatest opportunity to ensure a healthy and prosperous @UMass while meeting our workforce development mission is to take bold, intentional steps toward building a new delivery model for @UMassOnline. #StateOfUMass
But we remain at a crossroads. With the decline in traditional undergraduate students, rising costs and limited access to new funding, our ability to meet the future needs of the Commonwealth and its economy is in question. #StateOfUMass
This project and many others across the system, driven by strong leadership and strategic planning by our chancellors, will serve us well in the future. #StateOfUMass
The Bayside development will create a new gateway to Columbia Point and attract companies to co-locate w/ Boston’s only public research university, creating opportunities for @UMassBoston student experiential learning &amp; faculty research partnerships. #StateOfUMass
As that hard work has progressed, we continue to make strategic investments to benefit our campuses. Last month, we reached an agreement with a developer for the Bayside property in Dorchester that could generate up to $235M in up-front revenue for @UMassBoston. #StateOfUMass
First, we must continue to strengthen our long-term financial health. That work is already underway through a series of fiscal oversight and transparency measures that have improved planning, controls and risk management. #StateOfUMass
So how will @UMass manage through these challenges? How will we evolve, adapt and continue to thrive? #StateOfUMass
But the effect on the Commonwealth will be acute. Our state economy will suffer from fewer college graduates entering the workforce &amp; a contraction in the higher ed industry, which is responsible for 125,000 jobs in the state. #StateOfUMass
To be clear, @UMass is in a better position than most, as nationally ranked universities like UMass may be shielded from the more extreme effects of the demographic decline due to our quality, affordability and scale. #StateOfUMass
This issue is real. It will disrupt higher education in profound ways and directly or indirectly affect every person in this state. #StateOfUMass
Economists and higher education experts predict that 25 percent or more of ALL colleges nationally could close or merge in the next 10 to 15 years. #StateOfUMass
We’ve all been alarmed by the recent closing of several small private colleges, but as described by one recent report, that is akin to water retreating from the beach before the tsunami hits. #StateOfUMass
Make no mistake — this demographic decline is an existential threat to entire sectors of higher education. And New England, unfortunately, is ground zero. #StateOfUMass
That means colleges and universities will have too much capacity and not enough demand at a time when the economic model in higher education is already straining under its own weight. #StateOfUMass
In New England — home to the country’s highest concentration of colleges — there will be between 32,000 &amp; 54,000 fewer college-aged students by 2026. #StateOfUMass
But there are new challenges that threaten our ability to fulfill our mission &amp; guarantee disruption across all of higher education, both public &amp; private. The most immediate is a looming demographic crisis due to plunging birth rates during the Great Recession. #StateOfUMass
That’s why I proudly stand with our students and faculty in support of the Cherish Act to restore appropriate funding levels for public higher education. Student affordability was the focus of my address last year, and it remains our single most important issue. #StateOfUMass
And I will continue to advocate for any reasonable measure seeking to preserve the promise of affordable higher education and remove the albatross of debt from our students. #StateOfUMass
We continue to work closely with our partners in the legislature to make our case for why an investment in @UMass is an investment in our state’s greatest natural resource — talent. #StateOfUMass
The equation is simple: As costs go up and state support fails to keep pace with inflation, students and their families are forced to pay and borrow more. #StateOfUMass
Meanwhile, state funding for public higher education has decreased by 12.5 percent since 2008 when adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. #StateOfUMass
Some of these challenges are familiar to us. Cost inflation, a commitment to meeting student financial need and new demands for services of all kinds continue to drive more than $100 million dollars in new expenses for the university each year. #StateOfUMass
But there is also no doubt that there are challenges on the horizon. #StateOfUMass
This was the precise goal of the Saxon Commission, one that I am proud to say has been achieved. In other words, the state of this university 30 years later is strong. #StateOfUMass
Through the talent we develop, the research we conduct and the service we perform, @UMass has become a key thread in the social, cultural and economic fabric that makes Massachusetts the greatest state in the nation. #StateOfUMass
Not to be outdone, our incredible @UMassMedical is top 10 percent in the nation for primary care education, and the bar pass rate at @UMassLaw has soared above 92 percent, behind only Harvard and BU in the state. #StateOfUMass
All of this is why U.S. News &amp; World Report has ranked @UMass one of the best university systems in the country for three years running, with all four undergraduate campuses ranked top-tier national universities. #StateOfUMass
Our $670 million dollar research enterprise produces life-changing discoveries, generates new startup companies and keeps #Massachusetts on the cutting edge of life sciences, robotics, advanced manufacturing and many other fields. #StateOfUMass
All of our five campuses are statewide economic engines and talent pipelines. Collectively, they generate more than $6 billion dollars in annual economic impact. #StateOfUMass
We graduate 18,000 students each spring, and nearly three quarters remain in #Massachusetts to live, work, start families and contribute to their communities. #StateOfUMass
We confer more degrees than any other institution in the state's highest demand fields, like management, education, analytics and nursing. #StateOfUMass
Today, @UMass educates 75,000 students in the Commonwealth, including three times as many Massachusetts residents as the top 8 private colleges and universities combined. #StateOfUMass
By every measure — from student demand to research impact to third-party validations — @UMass has reached the upper echelon of public universities in the United States and around the globe. #StateOfUMass
But over the last 30 years, through the hard work of so many people, @UMass has indeed become the world-class university the Saxon Commission envisioned. #StateOfUMass
The report concluded that the future prosperity of the Commonwealth depended on a world-class public research university. Bear in mind — what the Saxon Report envisioned was considered extreme. The authors actually acknowledged that it was a “radical notion.” #StateOfUMass
In March of 1989, the commission published what is now known as the Saxon Report; it envisioned a @UMass that could meet the state’s growing need for educated workers, close the education gap for underserved populations &amp; establish a new standard of excellence. #StateOfUMass
Three decades ago, a forward thinking @UMass Board of Trustees formed a blue ribbon Commission on the Future of the University to examine and make recommendations on the role of UMass in the Commonwealth. #StateOfUMass
That is more necessary at this moment, because significant challenges lie ahead for us. It’s a moment that calls for long-term thinking and long-term vision. But it’s important to first consider what brought us here. #StateOfUMass
Welcome to the third annual State of the University address. This is an opportunity to pause and reflect on our progress — to look back on where we’ve been and discuss where we’d like to go. #StateOfUMass

I want to thank @MassGovernor and his administration for their sincere interest in learning about why residence halls at @UMassBoston were so important and for ultimately approving this project.
That’s why I was proud to make advocating for residence halls at @UMassBoston one of my first priorities when I became President of @UMass.
Combined w/ the fact that @UMassBoston is the only majority-minority university in New England — &amp; therefore the institution with the greatest ability to increase social &amp; economic mobility for underrepresented students — the lack of on-campus housing was simply unacceptable.
Academic study after academic study has shown that living on campus increases persistence rates, graduation rates &amp; other student success measures. But until today, @UMassBoston was the only nationally ranked, Tier 1 public research university that didn’t offer on-campus housing.
I was deeply proud to witness the grand opening of the residence halls at @UMassBoston today. The advent of on-campus housing here isn’t just symbolic of a new era — it will have a transformative effect on student life, campus culture &amp; most importantly student success. https://t.co/4Lf3ovakUD

Share your thoughts with us &amp; join us in our effort to ensure that a world-class @UMass education remains affordable for everyone, just as it was for me &amp; for so many of you. I'm convinced that the future success &amp; prosperity of this Commonwealth depends on it. #StateofUMass
With those shared values &amp; a shared commitment to @UMass, I am certain that we can achieve our goals. So if you have an idea that can help us maintain affordability – whether it’s conceptual, proven or completely out of the box – we want to hear it. #StateofUMass
We share a belief that we have a responsibility to create pathways of opportunity for students from all backgrounds. And a belief in the importance and enduring value of our 150-year-old land grant mission. #StateofUMass
Everyone in this room is dedicated to @UMass &amp; shares a belief in the power of public higher ed. We share a belief that an individual should be able to rise as high as their ambitions will take them. A belief that where you come from should not dictate where you go. #StateofUMass
I’m grateful for the dialogue I’ve had with students, faculty and administrators on these issues, and I want the conversation to continue. #StateofUMass
The Higher Ed Reauthorization Act would reduce federal financial aid by $15 billion over the next decade &amp; eliminate the loan forgiveness program for public service. This threatens the very mission of public higher education &amp; we will fight it with all that we have. #StateofUMass
Higher education leaders have been among the loudest voices in the fight to protect the #Dreamers. And that fight continues. #StateofUMass
I was proud to join our chancellors &amp; other college leaders across the country to challenge federal tax reform legislation that would have taxed tuition waivers for graduate students &amp; eliminated the student loan interest deduction. #StateofUMass
And finally, the five chancellors &amp; I reaffirm our commitment to full-throated advocacy on behalf of students. When I meet with students &amp; ask what university leaders can do to help, the most common refrain is that we need to show up for them. #StateofUMass
I mentioned him earlier this evening, but he didn’t know this was coming. I’m proud to announce that this year’s President’s Scholar is Timi Ogunjobi of @UMassLowell. Congratulations, Timi. #StateofUMass
By covering the remainder of his tuition for his senior year, this scholarship will allow him to avoid taking out another student loan. He represents everything that we’re about, and his story is an example of how a UMass education can change lives. #StateofUMass
I met last year's recipient, Isabelle Charlot of Brockton, when she was a guest at this event. And this year’s recipient is here tonight. He has demonstrated great perseverance in a demanding academic field while facing significant financial challenges. #StateofUMass
As someone who grew up in a working-class family in Lowell, whose life was literally transformed by the opportunity to attend @UMassLowell, I was proud to establish a scholarship for high-achieving UMass students from gateway cities. #StateofUMass
We're thrilled that legislation currently moving through the State House would incentivize private contributions by offering a state match to be held in our endowment. We thank our partners in the legislature for their support &amp; urge them to pass this legislation. #StateofUMass
I’ve pledged my full support to the chancellors in achieving this goal, which will require greater outreach. We need to tell more people the story of opportunity &amp; transformation that has already moved so many to become supporters of @UMass and its mission. #StateofUMass
So tonight, I’m issuing a challenge to our five campuses to raise $200 million dollars dedicated solely to financial aid over the next 10 years. This effort will double our financial aid endowment &amp; allow us to provide scholarships to 4,000 more students each year. #StateofUMass
The fourth area of focus is our single greatest opportunity to reduce costs for students, which is to increase our financial aid endowment. It is imperative that we grow our endowment to provide more scholarships for deserving and needy students. #StateofUMass
The model already exists, and it works. Companies like @KronosInc and @Raytheon invest in @UMass students on a continuum from undergrad to middle management, and they will tell you that their businesses are better for it. #StateofUMass
As part of a new Corporate Endowment Initiative, I'll meet w/ the state’s 30 largest employers to make the case not only for direct investment in scholarships, but for more paid internships &amp; co-ops, and debt repayment &amp; tuition assistance programs for employees. #StateofUMass
The third area of focus is to expand our partnerships with the business community. We know that companies recognize the benefit of investing in their employees. And that also benefits @UMass, because our alumni make up the majority of the #Massachusetts workforce. #StateofUMass
.@UMass will become the College of Choice for @_TheBASE, working collaboratively on mentorship &amp; development programming, and providing scholarships to Base students accepted to UMass. We’re excited to work with this incredible organization. #StateofUMass
Our second area of focus is to expand our partnerships with nonprofits working to increase access for low-income students. Tonight, I’m proud to announce a new partnership with @_TheBASE, a Boston-based nonprofit that's served more than 8,000 young people to date. #StateofUMass
Most importantly, growing our online footprint will make a @UMass education more affordable, not just by delivering it at a lower cost, but by generating new revenue to hold costs down for all of our students. That is my number one priority. #StateofUMass
Expanding our online programming will not only increase accessibility; it will enhance our contribution to the upskilling of the workforce, helping #Massachusetts capitalize on emerging opportunities. #StateofUMass
The first is to reach more students through online programs. By expanding our online programming, we can reach more working adults, people with incomplete college credit &amp; others seeking to advance their careers. #StateofUMass
But we recognize that being more affordable than most isn’t good enough. We must work proactively &amp; collaboratively to do more. So in the months and years ahead, we’ll be focusing on five areas to ensure that @UMass will continue to meet its affordability mission. #StateofUMass
We’re working with @MassGovernor's administration &amp; community colleges to create shorter &amp; more affordable pathways to a degree. We’ve implemented financial literacy programs, internship assistance programs and emergency funding for our most vulnerable students. #StateofUMass
We’ve cut costs to hold tuition increases to inflation. We’re using planning tools &amp; data analysis to make smarter, faster budget decisions. We’re committing record amounts of funding to financial aid. #StateofUMass
It’s important to note that our high job placement rates &amp; rankings for return on investment demonstrate that most @UMass graduates can easily manage a modest amount of debt. And UMass remains more affordable than most. #StateofUMass
These are the students we serve every day at UMass. There are thousands like them across our five campuses. Many overcome great financial obstacles to pursue their education and better their lives. #StateofUMass
With a Beacon Student Success Fellowship from @UMassBoston, she was able to study abroad in Europe and work with @BostonSchools on school reform. Heaven, you are an inspiration to all of us. #StateofUMass
We serve students like Heaven Reda, whose family came to Boston as refugees from northeast Africa, leaving everything behind. Heaven worked overnights, going straight to @UMassBoston in the morning, then helping her mother through cancer treatments. #StateofUMass
She was inspired to become a doctor by what she saw there, and with the help of scholarships, she’ll achieve her dream when she graduates from @UMassMedical School this spring. Congratulations, Evangelia. #StateofUMass
We serve students who are achieving dreams that they thought impossible given their backgrounds. Like Evangelia Murray, whose first exposure to medicine was in the Springfield hospital kitchen where her parents worked. #StateofUMass
He still found time to be active in The National Society of Black Engineers and to serve as president of a men’s leadership organization at @UMassLowell. Timi, we salute you. #StateofUMass
We serve students who personify determination, like Timi Ogunjobi. Timi faced major financial challenges growing up in Worcester. Last year, he worked three jobs so that he could study mechanical engineering at @UMassLowell while helping his family. #StateofUMass
The first in her family to attend college, Heather became an All-American at @UMassAmherst in track and field while excelling academically. She’s now pursuing her master’s degree in higher education. And she’s here with us tonight. Heather, you make us all proud. #StateofUMass
We serve students who are proving that they can turn struggle into opportunity, like Heather MacLean, who coped with the stress of having to earn money to feed her younger siblings by focusing on her studies and running track and cross country. #StateofUMass
That bothers me even more because our students are so talented, so hardworking and so inspiring. #StateofUMass
I take that personally, because I was able to pursue a career in public service largely because I graduated from @UMassLowell debt free. I now wonder how the trajectory of my own life might have changed had I been born 40 years later. #StateofUMass
We take no comfort in the fact that @UMass students graduate with below-average debt, because when I talk to students, it’s clear their finances weigh heavily on them, and debt impacts their career choices. #StateofUMass
It’s no wonder that across the country, student loan debt has nearly doubled over the past decade. #StateofUMass
Last week, we learned that annual tuition at five colleges in New England has eclipsed $70,000. Tuition at those private institutions will soon exceed the median family income in #Massachusetts. #StateofUMass
Perhaps this changing paradigm in public higher education gets less attention than it should because of the skyrocketing tuition at private institutions. #StateofUMass
To be clear, this lack of state funding is not a partisan issue &amp; it's not unique to #Massachusetts. It’s a long-term national trend. States around the country — squeezed by healthcare costs, local aid and other priorities — are struggling to fund higher education. #StateofUMass
Today, the state covers just over 20 percent of the budget. That means the cost of a @UMass education has shifted from the state to students &amp; their families. In just the last 17 yrs, per-student state funding has declined by 32 percent when adjusted for inflation. #StateofUMass
When I attended UMass Lowell 40 years ago, the state covered more than 80 percent of the school’s budget, and I was able to pay my full tuition – which was about $600, or $2,800 in today’s dollars – by working nights, weekends and summers. #StateofUMass
So while we pursue excellence – and we will continue to pursue excellence – we must remain affordable for students from all backgrounds. Because affordability, which is central to our mission, is no longer guaranteed by our status as a public university. #StateofUMass
Millions of dollars in research grants mean little to the student for whom hundreds of dollars may be the difference between earning a degree or having to withdraw. #StateofUMass
Those record numbers of students only make it more difficult to identify the few who are experiencing food insecurity. #StateofUMass
Because while rankings may boost our reputation, they can’t give a hand up to a student paying their way through college. #StateofUMass
But as we celebrate our successes, we also have to acknowledge the challenges we face, not just at @UMass, but across public higher education. #StateofUMass
It’s clear we have plenty to be proud of. These accomplishments validate the hard work of our students, faculty and staff. And they serve as proof that more and more families recognize the value and quality of a @UMass education. #StateofUMass
These initiatives are why @Reuters has ranked @UMass one of the World’s Most Innovative Universities three years running. And it’s why – for the second year in a row – @USNewsEducation ranked us one of the best university systems in the country. #StateofUMass
And @UMassAmherst is working with the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to use big data and artificial intelligence to accelerate health discovery. #StateofUMass
.@UMassMedical has launched one of the nation’s first rare disease research institutes. @UMassBoston has developed a test that can diagnose Zika and Dengue Fever in 15 minutes.  #StateofUMass
Our research is addressing some of the most pressing public health challenges in the Commonwealth, across the nation &amp; around the globe. #StateofUMass
.@UMassD has tripled its marine science research presence in New Bedford. And @UMassLowell is leading discovery of smart fibers and wearable electronics thanks to an $11 million dollar grant from @MassGovernor's administration. #StateofUMass
Our research enterprise now totals more than $670 million annually, trailing only Harvard &amp; MIT in the state, with focus in areas critical to the Commonwealth’s economy, like the life sciences, robotics, wind energy, advanced manufacturing &amp; flexible electronics. #StateofUMass
And one year after receiving full accreditation from @ABAesq, the bar passage rate at @UMassLaw – the only public law school in #Massachusetts – has surpassed that of three of the state’s private, ABA-accredited law schools. #StateofUMass
The @UMass student body is now more diverse than the high school student population in #Massachusetts, and @UMassBoston is the most diverse four-year campus in New England. #StateofUMass
Last spring, we graduated our largest class in history, with nearly 18,000 students earning degrees, most of whom will stay in #Massachusetts to build their lives. #StateofUMass
.@UMassBoston just enjoyed the largest Welcome Day for new students in its history. @UMassD has begun a new era, launching its master plan and soon to inaugurate @UMassDRJohnson. And @UMassMedical is training more future doctors than ever before. #StateofUMass
Demand for a @UMass education has never been higher, with enrollment approaching 75,000 students, led by more than 30,000 students on our flagship campus at @UMassAmherst. And @UMassLowell is the fifth-fastest growing public research university in the country. #StateofUMass
Our mission is to provide a high-quality, accessible &amp; affordable education that advances knowledge &amp; improves lives. Tonight, I will focus on one piece of that mission, but not before assuring you – unequivocally – that the #StateofUMass is strong, and only getting stronger.

As such, the chancellors of the five @UMass campuses and I strongly oppose this tax bill, and we call on Congress to enact policies that make college more affordable and accessible for all students — policies that support higher education and its power to transform lives.
There is no doubt that this tax plan will harm students and diminish our potential as a society.
Instead, this proposed tax plan reduces tax benefits and savings for college students, increases the financial burden on student loan borrowers and effectively creates more financial barriers to college for students of limited means.
At a time when costs and student loan interest rates are rising, we should be finding ways to make college more affordable and accessible.
The federal tax reform package before Congress is a serious misstep that unfairly targets college students and threatens college affordability. https://t.co/SifXMxHDcJ
#Dreamers, with @UMass students counted among them, are American in every way except immigration status. They are vital to our society and economy. Congress should pass a clean #DreamAct and soon.

@MassBudget @UMass And continued prosperity of Commonwealth requires not just gov’t, but also industry and philanthropy investing in #publichighered (10/10)
@MassBudget @UMass With state revenue shortfalls &amp; competing priorities, @UMass &amp; #publichighered community need to continue to make our case to #mapoli (9/10)
@MassBudget @UMass And when we disinvest in higher education, we diminish access and opportunity for the 50% still not earning 4-yr degrees (8/10)
@MassBudget @UMass Takeaway from the @MassBudget report is clear: A disinvestment in #publichighered in Massachusetts is a disinvestment in our future (7/10)
@MassBudget @UMass Result: Students and their families are now paying more than 50% of the costs for #publichighered in #Massachusetts (6/10) https://t.co/WEcX8FLTCl
