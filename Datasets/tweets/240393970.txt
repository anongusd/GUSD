I filed the Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act to cut federal funding from any state/municipality that allows noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote. More &amp; more of these initiatives are popping up across the country, so we must keep working to push this bill.
These dangerous &amp; egregious policies are allowing the voice of the American citizen to be watered down at the voting booth, &amp; I believe we must fight to protect the integrity of our elections &amp; the value of American citizenship.
Too many liberal communities are beginning to allow noncitizens &amp; illegal immigrants the sacred right to vote in local elections as part of their open borders agenda. Today, it‚Äôs local elections ‚Äì next, it could be state or nationwide elections.
Even though the House is now led by Nancy Pelosi &amp; open border Democrats, I will never stop fighting to make our country safe for all Americans. This starts by ensuring federal dollars are restricted from jurisdictions that have no respect for our nation‚Äôs laws.
Sanctuary cities foster &amp; encourage illegal activity which poses a great danger to American citizens. Congress must do all it can to defund &amp; crack down on these jurisdictions that encourage illegal behavior, &amp; my bill will do just that.
Along w/ securing our porous southern border &amp; building the wall, we must continue to work to defund dangerous sanctuary cities, which is why I have introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act.

Walls work. Saying they don't is akin to saying the world is flat. And when you combine them with policies that end catch &amp; release, end sanctuary cities, criminalize visa overstays, close asylum loopholes, and require mandatory e-verify, they are extremely effective.
There are basically two kinds of people who oppose a border wall:	1) Those who want open borders and believe people from other countries have a right to come here	2) Those who hate President Trump, and oppose whatever he supports.

Pleased that the House passed @GOPLeader's resolution to disavow illegal immigrant voting. This is a great starting point, but we must do more to eliminate foreign interference in our elections.
Democrats are pushing a far left agenda by allowing noncitizens and illegal immigrants to vote in local elections. This is a very dangerous road to go down. We simply can‚Äôt allow noncitizens &amp; illegal immigrants to water down the desires and vision of the American people.
Being an American citizen comes with great benefits and responsibilities, which includes voting in elections. For generations, brave men and women have fought and died in order to protect the fundamental right of American citizens to participate in free and fair elections. https://t.co/sBS8Fyqtxz

Or  attempted to make immigration laws on his own? This is a completely different situation. Garland was blocked for good reason https://t.co/HfiMwcI5pA
@ScottJBryanFL agreed!
This circus has to end. These games have to stop. Judge Kavanaugh deserves better. Our country deserves better. Our children deserve better. Schedule a vote.  Our country and Judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be subjected to another day of this horror.
US Senators are openly saying, without hearing his testimony or that of his accuser, that he should be presumed guilty until proven innocent. That's not the American way! Americans fought &amp; died so that an individual's name and reputation are not subject to the whims of a mob.
The only way Judge Kavanaugh would endure such abuse and assault to his reputation is out of a sincere desire to serve their country.
Serving on the Supreme Court is an amazing honor and a great responsibility, but no job is worth the abuse, ridicule, slander, and death threats that Judge Kavanaugh, his wife, and their two daughters  have had to go through over the past few weeks.
I watched the Judge Kavanaugh interview with Martha MacCallum, and what I saw was a man on the verge of tears, in great pain, being persecuted by the left because of his ideological and judicial beliefs.

@docshanep Great! And good luck!
President Obama had a responsibility to build a consensus on the Iran nuclear deal before moving forward with the agreement. He failed. Miserably. In fact, there were few issues that united Republicans &amp; Democrats in opposition to him than that particular agreement.
If anyone's to blame for undermining US credibility abroad via Iran deal it's Obama. There was bipartisan opposition to the deal. He should have never moved forward with it. The American people can not be expected to honor a commitment that they never supported to begin with.
RT @Amandainthenews: Jeff Duncan issues statement on decision to withdraw from 'deeply flawed' Iran Deal https://t.co/PKUVruWl8u
This withdraw should be a cautionary tale for future administrations   seeking to bypass and disregard Congress while negotiating international  agreements. https://t.co/MaMJ8WqLYo
President Obama brokered this agreement in spite of intense bipartisan opposition in Congress. The deal never had the support of the American people, and for the good of the country, President Obama should have never proceeded on his own.
While I'm sure this decision will be met with disappointment by some of our  allies, their disappointment should be directed at the Obama Administration, not President Trump.
The deal also gave valuable resources to the world‚Äôs greatest financier of terrorism, without any concessions from Iran on ending their nefarious activities. The agreement also lacked any real enforcement capabilities to ensure that the Iranians were living up to their promises.
The Iran Deal broke decades of national security precedent by commingling the issues of prisoner releases and sanctions relief, endangering every American in the process.
I applaud President Trump for keeping his word, honoring his promises to the American people, and recognizing that for the sake of international security, we can and must do better.
In fact, the Iran Nuclear agreement was so poorly conceived and negotiated that the Obama Administration‚Äôs motives for entering into such an deal deserve questioning.
At the end of the day, President Obama trusted the word of a rogue nation over the wishes of the American people. From its conception, the Iran deal faced extensive bipartisan opposition and lacked vision.

I have read the Dem memo, and already said publicly that I support its release as well. I‚Äôm on the side of keeping the public in the know. https://t.co/pAEq2e8w4G
@mythdebunker have I ever said who appointed the FISA judge? My concern is that the FBI withheld information from the judge when seeking a FISA warrant.
@DocHeatherB It needs to follow the same process that this memo followed, but I've read that one as well, and I have no problems with it being released.
This memo rightly shakes Americans‚Äô confidence in their government. The challenge will be conducting the proper amount of oversight, implementing the right reforms, bringing violators of the law to justice &amp; promoting an era of transparency &amp; openness to regain the public trust.
Finally, there needs to be a discussion as to whether the Mueller investigation is truly needed, seeing that the main premise that launched the investigation turned out to not be credible and was both directed and funded by political opponents. #FISAMemo
The revelations in the memo necessitate the public release of findings related to the Clinton email investigation, and whether a new investigation needs to be launched to determine whether crimes were committed. #FISAMemo
There must be a review of past FISA warrants and unmasking orders to determine whether there are other instances of the government knowingly submitting faulty or biased evidence to the court in order to get secret warrants on American citizens. #FISAMemo
These revelations require an extensive response by all three branches of government. The Department of Justice along with the FISA court must determine whether crimes were committed by government officials withholding necessary information from the court. #FISAMemo
The entire basis of the investigation into possible collusion with the Trump campaign and the Russians, along with the corresponding media coverage, was based on false information spread by political and ideological allies to Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.
By intentionally withholding vital information from the FISA court about source credibility, background, &amp; clear political bias, these activists within the government betrayed their oaths of office &amp; helped launch an entire false narrative directed at delegitimizing the President
In this case we see tools that were intended to keep our nation safe become weaponized by people with a political &amp; ideological agenda.
In a broader context, the memo confirms what many of us in Congress from both parties have said for years ‚Äî that the surveillance tools currently available to the government are susceptible to abuse and pose a risk to people‚Äôs constitutional rights.
Corruption thrives when people are left in the dark, which is why I have always championed for transparency in government and why I felt so strongly that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence memo should be released to the public.

@CameronVentura similar to the surge we saw when President Obama illegally put DACA in place.
@CameronVentura it sends the signal to the world, that if you come to the United States illegally, we won't send you back. It doesn't change the flaws in our underlying immigration system, so I would expect a major surge into the United States if it were signed into law.
@CameronVentura By attaching this issue to the spending bill, DACA advocates are putting the pay and well-being of our military on the line. The optics are terrible. Putting foreign nationals ahead of US soldiers. Not a good way to generate followers to your cause.
@CameronVentura the USA Act is cruel, because it will make our immigration problems worse, not better. It will encourage more people to come to the United States illegally, forcing us to address this problem again in the future.

@CameronVentura Last point. Your country over party hashtag is not being used in the proper context. This is about doing what's right for the American people. Politicians of both parties have lied about immigration enforcement. Nothing is ever done to really address it, that needs to change
@CameronVentura Let me be clear, my dismissal of the bill is not based on the words used in the press release, it's based on what key components are NOT included in the bill. I don't believe this is a bill that a majority of South Carolinians would support.
@CameronVentura notice that the quote is "narrow approach." That's Washington speak for not really doing much of anything. We need to pass something that addresses the concerns of the people who elected Donald Trump as our President. Something that actually solves problems.
@CameronVentura We're referring to a different bill, but from what I have seen from the summaries, this bill would not have the desired effect of discouraging illegal immigration into the US. If that doesn't happen, then any action Congress takes will make the problem worse.
@CameronVentura But no Democrats that I am aware of support it. Hence my point, do they really care about enforcement? Do they really care about solving this problem? Their motivations are in question here. If they supported that bill, we could probably have the issue resolved by Friday.
@CameronVentura Securing America's Freedom Act is the only legislation/proposal that I've seen that actually addresses security and enforcement in a serious way. And it includes legal status for DACA recipients.
@CameronVentura Problem is the people have been promised repeatedly by the federal government that we would have more border security &amp; interior enforcement. In the 80's when Reagan granted amnesty, we were told never again.
If the answer to these questions are "yes," then how does your plan accomplish these objectives? If you oppose eliminating chain migration, explain why. If you support the diversity lottery, explain why. Don't use these issues as political leverage for other projects. https://t.co/pvRx3jptCr
Questions all Democrats in DACA debate should have to answer: Should any legislation Congress passes on immigration discourage people from coming to the United States illegally? Should any legislation that Congress passes put American citizens ahead of foreign nationals?
Too many Democrats use the talking point of "I support more border security" but never follow through on achieving that goal due to either concerns with their political base, or flat out insincerity.
There are serious questions on Capitol Hill as to whether a majority of Dems really want more border security, immigration enforcement, and ultimately less illegal immigration. If they were honest brokers on this issue, they would be more willing to adopt common sense reforms.

@CameronVentura you're welcome. thank you for the great discussion!
@CameronVentura @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin I think you're right that generally both sides are sympathetic towards fixing the problem. However, creating a fix for Dreamers that doesn't fix the underlying problem, will ultimately put us back in the same situation. We have to discourage people from trying to come here.
@CameronVentura @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin eliminating chain migration entirely, sanctuary city restrictions, Kate's law, and prosecuting visa overstays are some of my top enforcement priorities.
@CameronVentura @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin There are many people in Congress, and even more back home who feel that Democrats don't really care about immigration enforcement. That distrust makes a phase by phase approach almost impossible. Why object to enforcing the law, if you really do agree with the law?
@CameronVentura @LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorDurbin Absolutely not. The enforcement would never come. There's no incentive for Democrats to agree to more enforcement provisions. The American people don't trust their government to follow through, and for good reason.
@CameronVentura I think there's a path forward in solving this problem, but it requires better enforcement of our immigration laws. That's what I specifically spoke out about the flawed thinking of a "clean" DREAM Act.
A "clean" DREAM Act is a bad idea for a number of reasons, one of which is that it is inhumane. More people would be encouraged to risk their lives to attempt to come into this country illegally. 6 in 10 women illegally crossing are sexually assaulted. https://t.co/imSCqVMnPg
Those negotiating a border security &amp; enforcement package that contains a DACA solution would be wise to remember that this is 2018, not 2013. The concerns that Americans expressed on immigration during the last election must be directly addressed.

@BurgerDogBoy ‚ÄúWe are at full employment‚Äù ü§î	Climb out of your hole Peter
More Americans gainfully employed means fewer needing govt assistance-ie less government spending. A robust economy means more tax $$ 4 govt
With more economic activity we will see more employment,more taxpayers,more corporate activity in spending &amp; taxes thus more revenues 2 govt
@stephensauceda I believe that tax revenues will actually increase. Look at three times Capital Gains Rate was reduced since 81. Revenues to govt went UP üëÜüèª
GOP Tax Reform Plan will put more Americans back 2 work, lessen govt spending, create more taxpayers, increasing revenues from new taxpayers

Tax reform is a huge and historic step towards Making America Great Again, and I am proud that it is almost across the finish line. #MAGA
I have long advocated for a fairer, flatter, simpler tax code that lets  Americans keep more of their hard earned money, helps small businesses  compete and expand, and keeps jobs in the United States. Both the House  and Senate bills achieve these goals.
It‚Äôs done. The Senate was able to pass a historic tax reform package.  Now the House &amp; Senate will meet to work out our differences, and I am very optimistic that we will have a bill sent to President Trump within a few weeks.

I've been saying this now for several days to folks in person and in response to questions on facebook, but for the twitter-verse and all reporters out there, I believe John Conyers needs to resign.
@Emma_Dumain More of a response to the garbage talking points I'm seeing from Senate Dems, &amp; others who claim to be concerned about the deficit, but stand in the way of cuts to government spending. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.
The best way to address any deficit concerns in the tax bill is to commit to spending cuts in the CR. You can‚Äôt claim you are concerned about the deficit unless you are willing to cut spending. It‚Äôs that simple.
@tthmember our debt is VERY important. I‚Äôve backed that position by supporting trillions in spending cuts. What‚Äôs frustrating is Dems who want more spending, but use the debt as a talking point. Support spending cuts.
Getting excited hearing from all these Democrats who are suddenly concerned about our nation's debt. GOP Leadership should heed these Dems deficit concerns, &amp; move on a CR that has substantial cuts in government spending. Put up or shut up!

@GValimont @mattgaetz for hunters, plugs are often not practical for prey like deer where you will often hear them before seeing them
@GValimont @mattgaetz hearing loss begins at 80 decibels, so using plugs in conjunction with suppressors provides max hearing benefits

@imjtothec House GOP has term limits for committee chairs. Dem Conference does not. That is big driver for opposing TL in Dem Caucus
@imjtothec I think you said you're not a Dem. liberal indie? Term limit message is almost non-existent in Dem politics. Hope that changes
@imjtothec resulting in no progress on the issue. Important to build numbers. We're not helping USA if the good guys leave &amp; bad guys stay
@imjtothec during the 90's, many members of congress term limited themselves. As a result, most of the strongest term limit supporters left
@imjtothec @JaCoryC it was actually a point debated during the GOP primary. I support term limits for all, where everyone has to go home.
@imjtothec @JaCoryC when I first campaigned, I made a clear distinction between self imposed term limits &amp; constitutional term limits.
@GBrennanSC I do represent you, but we won't always agree. I just try to listen &amp; be very clear to voters about how I will vote if elected.

@Colonel_John we have actually addressed several of those other issues in separate bills.
Obamacare is collapsing, resulting in fewer healthcare choices for families. The House has done its work, now the Senate must act.
According to CMS, only 141 issuers have submitted applications to participate in Obamacare exchanges compared to 227 last year
Another MAJOR reason Congress needs to cancel the August Recess,   the Senate has only confirmed 48 of 197 nominations to federal agencies
@AlanRussell42 actually I know you did, because I just saw you responded to one of my older tweets on the subject.
@AlanRussell42 did you not see my letter or multiple posts on this topic over the past several weeks?
I agree Mr. President https://t.co/xLDErp3PCe

@LeftLeaningCock actually one of the reforms in AHCA is the creation of invisible high risk pools, which don't segregate people from gen pop
@ClemsonBull that comparison makes no sense whatsoever. I oppose socialized medicine. I believe in choice, options, &amp; freedom.
@ClemsonBull ObamaCare is telling people how to live, what they can &amp; can't buy. People don't want that.
@ClemsonBull people want the government to get out of healthcare. That's what I hear the most.
@ClemsonBull I'm referring to tax dollars going in &amp; out. I don't trust the CBO with other modelling. I don't fully trust them with $ either
@ClemsonBull if the market will sell it, people should be able to buy it.
@ClemsonBull I'm not. Because I don't think anyone should be forced to buy a plan that contains coverage for something they don't need.
@ClemsonBull people should have a right to purchase and sell a product that is tailored to fit individual's circumstances. Gov't needs to stop meddling
@ClemsonBull CBO score is best when discussing tax revenue and spending, not social conditions. And even then CBO score with ObamaCare useless.
@ClemsonBull yes. Why should a 21 year old single male &amp; a 60 year old woman be forced to buy a plan with maternity care?

@c4BraveHeart @stucker53 I get my insurance from the ObamaCare exchange. So that is what I will be doing.
@indivisible_sc @stucker53 @BWestbrookAZ8 I posted a full explanation on facebook for why we aren't exempt. I'd appreciate an apology
@BrentARichmond1 I haven't campaigned for years on punching anyone in the face. Had I done so, I doubt I would have been elected.
@BrentARichmond1 why? For doing what we said we were going to do?
@stucker53 @BWestbrookAZ8 we did not.
@Ilovechoctoo I explain why in the statement you're looking at.
@Ilovechoctoo I didn't. NYT just got it wrong. Per usual.
@ruthlessgringo didn't switch my vote. NYT misreported. Which they tend to do frequently.
@StephanieStree6 the exemption issue was the only related part of the bill that had to pass as a stand alone bill.
@StephanieStree6 the base text of the bill is the same as what was released in march, with 2 amendments, one of which was just 8 pages.
@StephanieStree6 to get around that, we addressed the issue in a standalone bill that passed unanimously and at the same time.
@StephanieStree6 House Admin was not listed in reconciliation instructions, so therefore could not be included in reconciliation.
@StephanieStree6 however, since Congress gets its insurance through ObamaCare, making changes to Congress falls under House Admin Committee
@StephanieStree6 essential health benefits fall under the E&amp;C committee which was listed in reconciliation.
@StephanieStree6 the original bill didn't deal with essential health benefits, that was an amendment that was later added.
@StephanieStree6 when reconciliation instructions are made, they list the areas to be worked on and the impacted committees.
@StephanieStree6 house is using a process called budget reconciliation to pass the healthcare bill. Reconciliation has many rules
@StephanieStree6 long explanation but here is the twitter version.
@StephanieStree6 we had CBO score of base text of the bill. And we passed a separate bill to eliminate any exemptions for Congress.
@ClemsonBull their parliamentarian won't talk with us (House), so Senate has ability to better craft amendments.
@ClemsonBull We're using reconciliation process which is subject to senate rules. Senate has better ability to work with parliamentarian.

@KatyaBG The MacArthur Amendment has been out for a while now, and the base text is what was marked up in committee.
@mamm51 I don't support exemptions. There's a stand alone bill to remove that.
@ClemsonBull @GBrennanSC my point is since ACA was passed on partisan basis, there is no willingness on other side to move bill to right
@ClemsonBull @GBrennanSC Need to run, but have enjoyed the conversation. Thanks for reaching out
@ClemsonBull @GBrennanSC I've never really heard Pelosi, Reid, Obama express regret for passing it on partisan basis. Poisoned the well.
@ClemsonBull @GBrennanSC I'd love a bipartisan bill. But O-Care was passed on a partisan vote, &amp; I fear it will have to be repealed that way
@ClemsonBull find number for what?
@imjtothec @ClemsonBull macarthur amendment has been public since pretty much that moment that agreement was reached.
@GBrennanSC @ClemsonBull dems can't filibuster it. Using reconciliation, same process Dems used to pass ObamaCare.
@ClemsonBull New York Daily news is not what I would call a reliable, unbiased news source.
@imjtothec @ClemsonBull EHB was why Obama's promise was a lie. O-Care sold under false pretences.
@imjtothec @ClemsonBull remember the lie "if you like your plan you can keep it?" Root of EHB waiver is to lower costs and increase choices
@imjtothec @ClemsonBull of course I do. Why else do you think I've been pushing to repeal ObamaCare for years?
@imjtothec @ClemsonBull the text has been out for weeks.
@ClemsonBull I support removal of exemption and see no reason why it wouldn't pass as stand alone unless Dems filibuster it.
@ClemsonBull there's a standalone bill to fix that. Heard exemption had to be included in amendment due to Byrd rule. Don't know if true
@ClemsonBull amendment further rollsback O-Care. We've been studying that for years. As Dems like to remind me, voted for repeal 40+ times
@ClemsonBull there's a large misinformation campaign going on out there to kill the bill. Very disappointing.
@ClemsonBull More important will be the score on bill that the senate sends back
@ClemsonBull we have CBO score on main text language, which gives largest blueprint. But as I said, Senate will make lots of changes.
@ClemsonBull main bill text is whats been available for weeks and is what was marked up in committee. McArthur amendment has been public
@ClemsonBull that's why we're very hopeful senate can polish it and make it better. But they need a bill from House to start that process.
@ClemsonBull great thought has been put in House bill, but there's lots of uncertainty about what can &amp; can not be included.
@ClemsonBull what can and can not be included in a reconciliation package. Senators can better determine that. But bill must start in House
@ClemsonBull the senate parliamentarian will not speak with House members regarding Senate rules. So it is very difficult to determine...
@ClemsonBull there was never any expectation that this bill would be passed as is in the Senate. I'm hoping Senate will make it better.

@AH1MECHANIC rules should apply. And most of the time they do. Lots of internet rumors out there.
@AH1MECHANIC its like the telephone game. NYT writes a misleading headline, another group writes one on story slightly more misleading.
@AH1MECHANIC that's the part that's not true. And while the article takes some liberties, they aren't even saying thats happening.
@AH1MECHANIC for example, if a single male doesn't want to buy a plan with OBGYN coverage they shouldn't have too.
@AH1MECHANIC I disagree with some of the conclusions in the article. Essential health benefit requirements limit people's choices.
@AH1MECHANIC the article is accurate, with a misleading headline.The summary in the tweet is just misleading.

Very proud of my friend Gov @dbeasley1 for his new role with the World Food Program!
@mrH0LIDAY Congress shouldn't have to proactively vote to undue regulations. We should vote to approve them.
@mrH0LIDAY this was a vote to undue the regulation, and regulatory authority.

@tinkter not sure if I understand your intent. Character limit is difficult. Trying to give fair reaction.
Biggest debate over CBO score won't be cost, but rather total number estimated to be insured.
CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce federal deficits by $337 billion over the 2017-2026 period.
By 2026, avg premiums for single policyholders in nongroup market  under legislation would be roughly 10% lower than current law -CBO/JTC

@Pinkomomma @bluebarbedwire some bird groups used opposition to raise money. But that was my intent behind bill.
@Pinkomomma @bluebarbedwire I offered amend to temp defund prosecutions. That got on Admin's radar &amp; they expedited new rule
@Pinkomomma @bluebarbedwire my goal was to create a "take" that would be allowable. Beyond that fines would be implemented.
@Pinkomomma @bluebarbedwire difference is prosecutorial discretion. But when it comes to wind farms, it was less clear. 2/2
@Pinkomomma @bluebarbedwire yes under the law, intent does not matter. So if you hit one with car it is same as poaching. 1/2
@Pinkomomma they have specific laws that cover them, in addition to mitigatory bird treaty act.
@bluebarbedwire @Pinkomomma was focused on wind. DOJ was being arbitrary dealing out fines for accidental deaths. Creating uncertainty.
@Pinkomomma so if you think wind energy is a good thing, you're welcome!

@turnbul04 I've done it before w flash polls on our tele-town halls. Most people get angry when Ive done it. Say its not scientific

@mmartin9095 I had a group request I do a saturday town hall in oconee, and when I got there they were no shows.
@mmartin9095 I try to vary time and locations for town halls. For past 6 years, saturday town halls have been least attended
@terrhorn I def support. But have different ways of doing that. Dodd Frank has killed community banks, ect.
@terrhorn had Dodd Frank been written with more GOP input, none of this would have happened.
@terrhorn instead of compromising, Obama illegal appoints CFPB head. Angers congress, forces prolonged court battle which GOP wins 9-0
@terrhorn GOP wins seats in senate. Refuses to confirm CFPB head until we can make changes to Dodd Frank, bc we were excluded before
@terrhorn CFBP also not subject to congressional approps, so can't give input on that way.
@terrhorn example: Dodd Frank. Rammed through Congress with almost no GOP support. Creates CFPB, which congress can't provide oversight of
@terrhorn hard to focus on governing, when you have to spend so much time fighting to preserve checks &amp; balances, uphold constitution
@terrhorn I agree. Compromise easier when we follow regular order. Which ive pushed for. Obama's exec actions made that difficult
@terrhorn if Senate would confirm Trump's nominees our agencies would function better. Seems 2 me hold up is anger over no 60 vote margin
@terrhorn #1 issue at my town halls was holding him accountable. People angry bc they felt he acted above the law. Against will of people.
@terrhorn partisanship has steadily increased for decades, but Obama poisoned the well by going it alone on healthcare
@terrhorn do you feel that unprecedented delay on trump appointments is obstruction?
@terrhorn I mention it bc I sincerely believe executive branch has too much power. But no one complaining aboutTrump complained about that
@terrhorn pls do. Appointments were struck down 9-0 by the Supreme Court. Unprecedented abuse of executive power.
@terrhorn thoughts on Obama illegally making recess appointments? Or illegally spending money not appropriated by Congress?
@terrhorn you can disagree with rulings. Following them is what matters most. I disagree with ruling as well.

@stressandstars @nathanielcary @GreenvilleNews take a look at HR 277!
@evanmulch I felt like word "nullification" was giving people false hope about what that specific bill was doing
@evanmulch It would have made it difficult. Which is why I supported it. But did not change individual mandate/manipulation of free market
@evanmulch ok. But Taylor's bill was not a nullification bill. It only went so far was restricting what state could control.
@evanmulch with Taylor's bill, it didn't shield SC citizens from ACA taxes, or end restrictions on what type of insurance could be sold
@evanmulch restricting state compliance. I voted for that in SC General Assembly w real ID
@evanmulch restricts SC govt from complying with ObamaCare regs
@evanmulch while I strongly supported Taylor's bill. I'm not sure the word "nullification" accurately described what the bill did.
@mmartin9095 @JohnCampbell007 def not appropriate. Harder to control content on twitter but open to ideas.

@mmartin9095 they've been attacking me all weekend.
@evanmulch It is important to return power back to the states, and reduce role of federal government
@evanmulch I support plans like cut, cap, balance because I have become jaded that Congress will ever voluntarily cut spending
@evanmulch also, it's important to note that I have supported BBAs prior to supporting COS. There are BBA's filed in Congress
@evanmulch I do think a balanced budget amendment could be a useful tool in overspending, but it won't solve problem in itself.
@evanmulch I agree that there are entire agencies that are unconstitutional, and I believe we need to their fed involvement.
@evanmulch well for starters I've never said a BBA would be the only thing we need to get our government back on track. It's a tool.

@evanmulch we would have wasted weeks/months squabbling over a budget instead of repealing ObamaCare. A budget that we can spend way below
@evanmulch and the fact that not voting for this budget hurts our chances to repeal obamacare.
@evanmulch that the appropriations process is where we actually spend money and not the budget. And that a BBA would impact both.
@evanmulch that's fine. But I hope you'll remind them of all the conservative budgets I've voted for. And explain to them that on fed level
@evanmulch i agree with justin and thomas on a lot. But this is not one of them. ObamaCare repeal is the focus.

@carbensmom I'm not dividing. I'm pointing out that Pres Obama has a policy position shared by virtually no one, including democrats.
@chappyman its more right vs wrong. Obama's statement is out of step with most democrats as well.
President-Elect Trump already sounds more Presidential than Pres. Obama in condemning Castro's legacy. Castro was a butcher. Not complicated
Fascinating that Pres Obama's Castro statement is closer to Canada's Trudeau in tone than other American politicians of both parties
@JoelW2012 thank you
Disappointed but not surprised at President Obama's tone in Castro statement. Just another example of how out of touch he is with country.

@StevePh49215783 I never said stop protestors. I said quiet them. There's a difference.
@jlcampbell90 I don't have a first amendment right to say how I feel about these protests?
@jlcampbell90 I've never been accused of being part of the "washington elite" before. Thats a first. And from a reporter.
@jlcampbell90 I think a lot of the rhetoric is over the top. The fear they are spreading unjustified.
@jlcampbell90 is it good for country? Death threats from protestors on CNN
@jlcampbell90 I fully respect people's right to protest. Not saying they dont have the right to do this. But should they?
@jlcampbell90 these folks were no where to be found when Obama created constitutional crisis after crisis.
@jlcampbell90 2ndly, I've been more of a watch dog over our constitutional freedoms for the past 8 years than 99% of the people protesting

.@reginastruth where were u during illegal recess appointments? Or when POTUS spent $ not appropriated by Congress? Or during exec amnesty?
@reginastruth I talk about and follow the constitution all the time. Wish left had done the same the past 8 years though.
@stevenvmiller I was saying encourage calm. Stop the mass hysteria. Not prevent them from having the freedom of speech.
Great seeing the liberals on Twitter finally embrace the Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights!  Welcome back! Let's Make America great again!

@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie no they shouldn't.
@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie it's another example of washington getting in the way and  creating new problems.
@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie how are you supposed to work in a sales job if you're only working 9-5? Not checking email?
@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie them an extra day off after a project. They're fine with that. Not being able to check emails after work?
@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie that should be worked out with employer/employee. I've heard from several employees who say boss normally...
@mmartin9095 @HayesJulie not always. Lots of young people, commission based jobs, that require flexible hours or travel.
@HayesJulie most manufacturing workers are paid hourly. Hourly workers get overtime. We're talking about salaried employees under new rule
@HayesJulie emails after hours because of rule. Will result in lower sales, less take home pay.
@HayesJulie also heard from sales employees who are commission based who are now capped at 40 hours. Will no longer be able to respond to
@HayesJulie so she's going to be limited 40 hours a week. And receive a pay cut to correspond with having less responsibilities.
@HayesJulie under new rule, travel time counts as overtime. employer will have to either raise her salary significantly or eliminate role
@HayesJulie part of her job is to travel to trade shows. It's her fav part of her job, but requires her to travel over some weekends.

...all forms of immigration and visas from countries classified as terrorist safe havens by the State Department. (3/3)
...immediately deport any non-citizens residing in the United States who are listed on a terror-watch list, and indefinitely suspend...(2/3)
I am reiterating my previous calls for the @POTUS to halt the Syrian refugee resettlement program...(1/3)

Forget about "No Fly, No Buy," how about "No Fly, Goodbye." If you are a non-citizen and on the terror watch list, you should be deported.
