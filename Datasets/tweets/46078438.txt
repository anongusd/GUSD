Mea Culpa. I joked about it. It was reported as just an egg throwing. If, as updates indicate, it was a punch, then I wholeheartedly apologise &amp; secondly I condemn any &amp; all forms of political violence.

@WChapman8065 Why? I understand his view. He’s an immigrant. He’s been shown wonderful hospitality and is grateful for it. He said nothing wrong. She, and millions of us, law abiding or otherwise, are not guests. We were born here.
@WChapman8065 The camps are not under the auspices of the Asad regime. And won’t be. They are under the auspices and guarantee of American security, with FSA &amp; Kurdish allies. The Americans don’t want our waste.
To be clear: I still think she is our problem (UK). And that we cannot simply offload our ‘toxic waste’ on world while expecting the world to accept theirs, when we deport others from the UK (which we do).
@viatorem_orbis Yes, but are they obliged to accept this without any legal arrangements?
May I remind everyone that they’re not legally married under any recognisable law. Not Dutch. Not British. Not Syrian. Not Iraqi. I’m sure this is relevant for immigration purposes, as the Dutch don’t have to take her. Theirs is merely a “religious arrangement” الزواج العرفي https://t.co/BHi97bs1T2

@MikeStuchbery_ Ok let me make this easy for you since you failed to reply. My tweet (if you read it) said: “Your own party (Tom Watson’s Labour) objected to a UK ban on Hizbollah” &lt;— that (and calling them his “friends”) explicitly *isnt* “doing both”, as you say.
@OjazzO @jeffbone4 A politician being hit by and egg is wrong. It is also not a major big deal. And usually nobody is hurt, at all. It is also an equal opportunities offender. Which is why humour here (as relief that it wasn’t something more serious) is not that big a deal either.
@MikeStuchbery_ Did you even read the tweet? Re-read it. Slowly this time. And try assuming that I’ve already thought of that line. Then, if it’s still too hard for you.. try asking me my meaning, instead of telling me it.

China-style “Social Credit system” emerging in US tech is oppressive because it’s politicised. Tommy Robinson banned, but anti-Semitic hate preacher Farrakhan, &amp;Hamas, Hezbollah terrorists all remain. It’s lazy &amp; panders to white liberal elite West Cost self-congratulatory bubble

Because Mo Shafiq is on the record, multiple times, praising &amp; hosting those who participated in the anti-blasphemy mob in Pakistan that bayed for Christian woman Asia Bibi’s death. He also led a blasphemy campaign against me in 2015. @NickCohen4 explains https://t.co/9jWmX1WtFi
This is not a free speech issue. Tech companies are private enterprises, after all. It *can* be a discrimination in service provision issue, if tech companies are inconsistent in the application of their policies. Here, the digital cultural blindspot appears to be at work again
I see pro ‘Pakistan blasphemy law’ activist @MShafiqUK is claiming credit for Tommy Robinson being banned from @facebook. This is akin to @PeoplesMomentum getting the new @UKIP banned. Tech companies: you’re being used by those who,by their *own* definition, should also be banned

@JackWills2019 Watch the video, dude.
For those catching up, I’m parodying that infamous Liam Neeson quote above. I do not actually believe in blaming all white people for my attack &amp; never felt like doing so, even on Tuesday. Even when I was asked by a friend that very night whether I did. I very clearly said “no”.
Somehow @sajidjavid, I doubt the white British racist who attacked me &amp; scared me for life last Tuesday will ever have his citizenship revoked. Yet according to your policies, if I went around the streets with a cosh “looking for any white ba***rd I can find”, I could. Watch —&gt; https://t.co/dhiTDwdTrE

Tonight I was racially attacked while alone outside Soho theatre, from behind, as I bent down to pick up my phone.

What was I saying about stripping citizenship and ‘mission creep’? Well... exhibit A: https://t.co/cnN8w3jJPQ
Most responders in my mentions either have trouble following an argument, haven’t read what’s written, or *can’t* understand the argument: by cautioning against eroding our civil liberties, I am *not* defending the ISIS bride. I am defending *us*. They are *our* civil liberties.
Er... yes. I was an @amnesty adopted Prisoner of Conscience. Jailed for wrong *ideas*. Ideas that I’ve spent the last 11 years challenging. As I said, hardly comparable to joining ISIS. But then you probably knew that already, you nincompoop. https://t.co/VxdzxIOTnB
Some Muslims are 1st to cry “bigotry” whenever Muslims within the law are compared to ISIS,yet they do exactly that to me because they hate my challenge of extremism. My non-terrorist former idiotic group is *still* legal across the West. Hardly fair to compare my past to ISIS 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/1H5Tp6PG5r
Before we realise it, by thinking emotionally over each individual extreme case, we grant the state more &amp; more accrued power over time, and by the end of the ‘emergency’ our civil liberties are entirely &amp; voluntarily eroded at the end of our pitchforks. It’s always worth pausing
We naturally think emotionally during cases like this. We don’t mean to set legal precedents. But once set, mission creep occurs. This is always how civil liberties are eroded. Deportation,citizenships stripped &amp;data snooping. It starts with terrorism but moves to general crime.
Currently, Home Sec has power over dual nationals &amp; those born in UK with only Brit citizenship but with parents who have another nationality (me), to strip us of our citizenship for opaque reasons. This creates 2-tier citizenship, is dangerous &amp; discriminatory #WarOnCitizenship
There’s a danger the case of Shamima Begum will be used to further the Home Office’s #WarOnCitizenship &amp; #HostileEnvironment policy. It’s sadly the case the most extreme examples are always seized upon to erode our civil liberties, when that’s precisely when we should resist it.
ISIS bride Shamima Ali was 15 when she left &amp; 19 now. I’m not sure it’s so easy to diminish her criminal responsibility, but certainly that child in her womb is innocent. Social services should be all over *how* that child is raised &amp; by whom. Perhaps grandma should take over?

@sorendrew You clearly don’t understand anti-Semitism either. Even she’s apologised. Perhaps educate yourself about racism against Jews &amp; what it entails.
@sorendrew @PakiAmaan @IlhanMN @lomonur Stop with your #BigotryOfLowExpectations and stop comparing the criticism of patently unacceptable and fundamentalist views, with racism. That’s highly insulting to anti-racists everywhere (including me) who have had to actually suffer racism, unlike your rather privileged self.
@sorendrew Religion and culture can adapt, update and reform. You compared it to racism. You are simply wrong. Admit that, and move on.
Everything wrong with the #RegressiveLeft in one tweet 1)Comparing criticising religion with racism (er..religion is a set of medieval ideas that are wrong?) 2) Use of the “Islamophobia” misnomer to stifle reform 3) Non-Muslim tone-policing of Muslims on our own reform debate 🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/2lbonGHCrM
@IlhanMN @lomonur Some complaining here about the age of this tweet &amp; raising my past views. Sure: let Ilhan openly acknowledge she’s had a rather Muslim fundamentalist past &amp; start campaigning against that past. That’s how contrition works in *every* other context people 🤦🏽‍♂️
@veryblakenews Wrong way around. A prerequisite for that is for Arab &amp; Muslim-majority states &amp; societies (also receiving US aid) to accept Israel as a legitimate state (not treat her as exceptionally illegitimate &amp; warring with her). So far, hardly *any* do. That’s why Israel requires US aid

Muslim politicians will realise the hard way in democracies, they cannot have their cake &amp; eat it: claim to be fighting against bigotry, while displaying worse bigotry themselves. They’ll realise there is nothing *exceptional* about Israel / Palestine  to merit such hysteria
Muslims (any Western minority) usually start the integration process for ‘identitarian’ reasons. This is overall a good process to begin. But Muslims long fetishised Palestine for religious reasons. Hard left cynically jumped on this for dishonest ideological &amp; electoral reasons
Mayor Khan of London made a similar, painful transition from local to national politics once elected as mayor (ref: his apology for using the ‘Uncle Tom’ slur against my organisation @QuilliamOrg
They then learn the hard way that, once elected, this is an unsustainable position. In liberal democracies, elected officials must represent all their constituents.
For too long, Muslims in the West have been driven (sometime encourages by Islamists) to enter politics on a very narrow platform: to “represent” Muslims “defend Islam”. Contrary to Ilhan’s posturing on ‘lobbying’, many enter politics effectively to ‘lobby’ on Muslim issues
Thread: Rep. @IlhanMN apologised for her anti-Semitic Jewish money slur. Good. But this is her second apology for anti-Semitism in a very short time period. If a mistake keeps happening, it’s usually a sign of a deeper intellectual &amp; emotional malaise. What’s the cause?

Folk talking about my (non-violent) past. A) it was non-violent B) redemption requires more than admission, but giving back C) Time heals. Particularly for the targets of one’s indiscretions. Who need closure. A privileged ‘admission interview’ is a good start, but not enough

@C_Kavanagh Mate, I’m older than you,have been Muslim all my life, Islamist half of it. I’ve spent years on both sides of this debate in my community. I know how to spot someone who’s set up an anon account to peddle views they actually believe in. Try STFU &amp; ask instead of telling. Sit down

@OmarZLatif Agree. Let’s gather more people. Much needed
@C_Kavanagh The account has been set up, yes. But the person controlling it believes those views. That’s why I said “apparently a woman”. Humble yourself, and try asking, instead of telling, when you’re speaking to reform Muslims about the change needed in *our* community.
@snadinadi And you did bring Jews into it. So again, what’s your point?
@snadinadi And Muslims do say those things. So does the scripture. So I’m not exactly sure what your point is? Do you have one? As for your lazy, tired point about the “far-right”, actually read this: https://t.co/nEMVUiH1Oe
@snadinadi https://t.co/nEMVUiH1Oe
@OmarZLatif That doesn’t mean you’re not in an echo chamber. Your experience of your Muslim friends is not the scientific data. Scientific data tells us: “we’re f*#^}*ed” Which is why I’m posting shock waves online, to wake people up.
@snadinadi Stop tone policing. It’s boring &amp; patronising. I am not your enemy. Nor am I the problem. Go and focus on those who preach from the mosques that you’re inferior. Or the 52% who want to ban homosexuality, for example: https://t.co/oahfkkRlcS
@snadinadi A) Scrutinising religion is our duty B) I’m Muslim. I’ll challenge conservative Islam,because it represents power in our community C) stop apologising for power D) Jews are a people as well as a religion. Some criticism of Jews can be racist E) Stop dragging Jews into everything!

If you’re having difficulty understanding the sheer anger your stance has caused, just imagine for a moment how angry you’d be if a white, middle-aged, conservative Christian Republican Congressman asked for leniency for violent Neo-Nazi terrorists. @IlhanMN you need to apologise
You’re America’s first Somali Representative &amp; you’re visibly Muslim. To intervene for leniency on behalf of self-confessed &amp; convicted ISIS jihadists does more to create anti-Muslim bigotry than any “marginalisation”. That, plus it’s morally questionable. They’re ISIS FFS 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
As well as your incredibly poor choice of example for who deserves compassion, you demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of radicalisation by infantilising jihadists who “chose violence to combat direct marginalization“..? we’re talking about ISIS here,madam Congresswoman 🤦🏽‍♂️

@UndefeatedSun Re-read the thread. Slowly.
Read thread: (scroll up) about Brexit MP @DKShrewsbury announcing he has lobbied a foreign government to thwart the will of the British Parliament. If I did that with Pakistan (my ancestral country) It would most certainly be called: treason. https://t.co/PsKa342UCe
Parliament is sovereign in the UK. Not the PM. Not her government. Not the electorate. Not the EU. Not individuals MPs. And certainly not foreign countries. Parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament (as representative of her people) decides. So kindly, @DKShrewsbury MP, back off
6) For an individual MP to declare publicly that he’s lobbied a foreign government so that it can thwart the will of Parliament is-at the very least-an undermining of the very Parliamentary sovereignty Brexiters said they were to fighting for in the referendum
4) Poland’s not our official negotiating partner. The EU is 5) No Remainer has yet declared-to my knowledge-that once Parliament decides something, they’d lobby a foreign entity to thwart Parliament’s will. If they did Brexiters would call it treason, for understandable reasons
2) Remainers wanting the EU cannot (constitutionally) violate our sovereign Parliament, if Parliament chose (which it did) to assent to each new piece of EU integration 3) Remainers negotiating with EU bodies is not treason. As they’re our official negotiating partner for Brexit
This is too gross a spectacle to allow usual tribal rebuttals of ‘but your side does it too’ 1) I’m known for challenging ‘my side’ (whatever that means when it’s home) &amp;am often accused by ‘my side’ of being too empathetic to ‘your side’ (it’s like I’m in a school playground!)

@HayThurJack @AllieRenison That’s irrelevant. Legally, we must respect what they tell us about their intentions. And I do *not* support a ban. But morally, we don’t have to. And I don’t.

@AllieRenison If this were about what a confederate T-shirt symbolises,few would make it about ‘rights’ (it’s your right to wear one). Instead,we’d ask whether it’s ‘right to wear’. Why, if I talk of the gender apartheid hijab symbolises, do ppl make it about ‘rights’?#BigotryOfLowExpectations
@AllieRenison You’re talking about rights. No offence,but that angle carries a bigotry of low expectation. I’ve *never* argued it’s not a right to *choose* to wear it. Instead,I argue that (like a confederate T-shirt) just because it’s a ‘right’ to wear it, that doesn’t make it ‘right to wear’
And for those whose comprehension is slightly challenged: *believing* something to be a tool for misogyny and wanting to debate it, is not the same as *telling* people what to wear.
The same people who deploy the line “stop telling Muslim women what to wear” when I merely say that I *believe* the hijab to be a tool for misogyny,will abusively ‘tell women what to wear’ themselves, when Muslim women publicly choose to remove their hijab https://t.co/twZ4Sq43IA

@GaryMaylin Indeed. But also, the ad missed an opportunity. It’s not the first to take this angle. The reaction strikes me as fatigue, rather than ‘resisting’ a new message that isn’t yet understood. The structural issues require urgent attention.
@douglasmclellan https://t.co/QGcw4ZfDpC
@chrishudsonjr Oh dear. You have displayed an inability to appreciate nuance. Did you even read my full thread before responding combatively, like (oh I don’t know) a typical “toxic” male?

@annaafhallstrom “Us women who care about these issues already know without your suggestion.”
Any homeless single male, suicidal veteran, father who’s surviving parental alienation, new father without equal legal paternity leave, divorcee who’s lost a home, or trans woman, will know from whence I speak. Masculinity needs reform, yes. But half a campaign won’t help.
@Rufus_O_Pope @annaafhallstrom Ad hominem is an illogical and sensationalist tabloid response, lacking any merit. Goodbye Rufus.
@annaafhallstrom No. It explains that the traditional “aggressiveness” being levied at men, is not only the domain of men. I feel you are being unnecessarily combative. I do not know you. Therefore, I’ve ended the conversation. Perhaps think about how a potential ally (me) could’ve been won round

@1eerobinson Strawman. https://t.co/QGcw4YY2y4
@annaafhallstrom @Rufus_O_Pope I have no “target”. This is not a war. I’m merely suggesting a better way to address the issues. Social media is full of those who deride “toxic” masculinity without addressing its structural, legal and cultural causes
@lochlanwatt https://t.co/d78Bzy80RY
@annaafhallstrom I’ve been thinking about the reaction. I imagined an ad about women’s products, but instead of being positive it appeared to highlight negative. Many men feel caught between (much needed) change in notions of masculinity &amp;outdated structures forcing them to preserve those notions

@1eerobinson https://t.co/d78BzypCgy
@SeanWRyan Tell them that.
@Rufus_O_Pope No. Don’t address half the problem without addressing what’s perpetuating the problem. Perhaps try being a bit more nuanced, and less of a (oh, I don’t know) traditionally aggressive and reactive male?
Campaigning to update traditional (or “toxic”) masculinity has merit. But doing so without addressing existing paternity, child custody &amp; divorce laws OR homeless &amp; mental health policies OR warfare, female dating culture &amp; feminist discourse on trans, makes less sense #Gillette
@Hxshly @CodyCCCXXII Except lacking nuance (by - and let’s not forget the context of this thread - supporting Hitler to get Brexit) *is* either a sign of poor education, or lacking intelligence. It’s not elitism to state that education &amp; intelligence could avoid people arriving at such a conclusion
@adrianjcox Please look up the difference between the meanings of “man” and “men”. Then re-read my tweet.
@CodyCCCXXII @Hxshly When on earth did educating yourself,elevating yourself&amp; appreciating nuance, become a bad thing? A strange form of tribalism it is, that doggedly defends the very thing that can hold working classes back. Also, it isn’t only working classes who can lack education or intelligence

@alexrubner Re-read the tweet.
Finally, I’ll say: if everybody’s a ‘NAZI’, then obviously no one is, because the boy is crying wolf. Such a situation does an unconscionable injustice to survivors of the Holocaust (we are betraying them, simply because we wish to weaponise our strongly held opinions).
We must be able to state our position &amp; the illogicality and emotional inconsistency of others’ positions without losing our shit, screaming at each other and refusing to talk. I am susceptible to making this same mistake too, so let this be a reminder to myself first &amp; foremost
It’s true that Brendan’s Brexit commentary on ‘the end of democracy’ if we have a @peoplesvote_uk (which I support) is gross hyperbole, on crack. But it is also true that Brexiters won (just about) a vote &amp; are feeling cheated (even though they can’t agree on what they voted for)

@MauriceByford @davidallengreen No. Parliament is sovereign. Especially in a representative democracy after an advisory referendum. Where did you study constitutional law?
Which kind of makes Corbyn... rather redundant.
It is now beyond any doubt in my mind that the former Attorney General, Tory MP Dominic Grieve is now the leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition, holding this government to account over the Brexit shambles 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 https://t.co/m8FpTluWLM

@davidallengreen Nope. I think Parliament will win this one. It always does. Parliament is sovereign, after all. Even Brexiters must agree to that.
This is a very bitter pill to swallow for the hard-left &amp; they don’t like the messenger (I too said this yesterday but they hate liberals like me too). Bitter a pill it may be.

The hypocrisy involved, of the left downplaying it and the right up-playing it, isn’t lost on me here either.
If you play the clip and imagine him saying woman as his lips move, it looks plausible. If you play the clip, and imagine him saying people as his lips move, it also looks plausible. Chill out guys.
Nice try. Except, I bemoan this utter tripe from the left when they do it too. I’m rather known for that. https://t.co/DdoqVcnsYc

4) Finally,for tech companies to opaquely decide (based on clear liberal political bias) that Tommy Robinson,Milo,Sargon &amp;other “racists” are too dangerous to be allowed on social media, while pro-blasphemy activists &amp; Hamas + Hizbollah operate openly, is peak 1st world privilege
3) I think it possible for PoC to be racist against whites.I’m yet to see a PoC banned for anti-white racism (Farrakhan). Nor should they be. Block individual racist tweets.Don’t ban non-violent *users*.Do ban violent users.This isn’t a free speech thing. It’s a consistency thing
2) As if that charge being true would mean I support a platform ban? While Hamas &amp;Hizbollah terrorists still have twitter accounts, I bristle at any suggestion that a non-violent populist UKIPer should be banned, so that we can all be esconned in an echo chamber #DigitalBlindspot

Coming up on my @LBC show in 5 mins 1) Brexit 🤷🏽‍♂️ 2) should gay conversion therapy be banned? 3) Raheem Sterling &amp; media racism. Is he right? 4) I’ll talk to @Sagron_of_Akkad to understand why @Patreon have de-platformed him
@benpobjie @RomeshRanga No. It’s a joke about “uncle toms”. Goodnight.
@benpobjie @RomeshRanga Yes. I hate it so much. In fact, I too am unable to understand “irony”.
@benpobjie @RomeshRanga It’s a “joke” making a sinister point about brown right-wing people not being true “brown people”. It hints at “Uncle-Tom” style reverse racism. Not all jokes are innocent. This one appears less than innocent. Let’s not act as if all “jokes” are good. That’s what the alt-right do
@benpobjie @RomeshRanga Should only left wing (I’m center-left) brown people be represented? If not, then the “campaign” is counter-productive and useless.
@benpobjie @RomeshRanga Er.... no. I’m questioning whether saying this just because those two are brown Tories, is: “considering starting a campaign for less brown representation in U.K. politics.”

We are always right to point out the aggravating factor, because it’s linked to the crime. As it should be here.

@nazirafzal If UK white population is 87.2%, then it’s consistent (but sad) that vast majority of sex criminals are white. But, with UK-Pakistani population at 1.9%, for us to be over represented in grooming gangs by any percentage over 50% mandates serious soul searching, not point scoring.

11) Nuance is an enemy for far-left, Islamist &amp; far-right extremes. So, Momentum, kindly stop with your smears. And Ash, I remain happy to help facilitate your own departure from supporting Momentum too. Feel free to reach out. Thank you 🙏🏽
9) After this Tommy rushed Quilliam’s offices,intimidating our staff &amp;filming our location. We press released,calling him an extremist 10) I remain willing to talking to the far-left, Islamist &amp; far-right extremists if they genuinely wish to change. That’s what we @QuilliamOrg do
7) We did pay limited expenses in lieu of his work on travelling to mosques, but these were *not* paid to him. They were paid to his wife, while he was in jail. 8) Here is my last interaction with Tommy, in which I berated him for reverting to his old ways https://t.co/phivAMToWO
5) Tommy subsequently went to jail for an existing conviction &amp; by the time he came out he had given up on reform 6) We did not pay Tommy any money to leave the EDL. This is based on a lie put out by Tommy after he wanted to revert to his old ways. What? Suddenly you believe him?
3) We put Tommy on a tour of UK mosques &amp; even got him to apologise to Britain’s Muslims in the Guardian (see below) 4) we never claimed that Tommy was “deradicalised” &amp; you will never find any statement claiming such. pro-Islamist &amp; far-left pundits are simply lying about this https://t.co/c1XD4F1eEy
2) In 2015, I did us all a  favour by facilitating Tommy’s departure from what was then Europe’s largest far-right street protest movement, the EDL. This is why there is no more EDL. It got finished. Bank that as a partial success. Don’t whinge about it.
Far-left Momentum has just attempted to link me to ‘Tommy Robinson’ in a video featuring Ash Sarkar. I’ll put this all in one tweet for them: 1) it’s our job at @QuilliamOrg to engage with radicals (far-left, jihadists &amp;far-right) to help them change. Happy to help Ash change too

@MohammedAkunjee You reveal your hand with that reply. Pls answer: 1) what’s your relationship to CAGE? 2) did security services create (partially?) Lee Rigby’s killer? 3) should Muslims cooperate with anti-terror police? 4) is it wrong to desire enforcement of sharia law anywhere in the world?

‘No Deal’ Brexit will plunge Britain into a recession as bad as the 2008 financial crash. This, according to the governor of the Bank of England. But don’t worry, it’s all good. Because.... Er... RULE BRITANNIA 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/XwINsN7WCn

@Alyaalsultani @HarasRafiq Gauged by the number of active &amp; capable terror plots and cells that are intent on murdering people, as defined by those monitoring them on a daily basis. Happy to meet &amp; talk, hopefully after one of your gigs x
@Alyaalsultani @HarasRafiq Accurate ppl (Muslim or not) in the West will see jihadist terror as a greater threat even in the West (this is our security services assessment.) Even accepting neo-Nazi extremism is fast rising. So let’s use a word that doesn’t help Islamists conflate the issue with blasphemy x
@graemearcher @unherd Anyone who doesn’t understand your point is probably hard of reading comprehension, and should defer to experienced columnists with requisite expertise for help deciphering it, before commenting on your piece 😏
@Alyaalsultani @HarasRafiq They’re not the same. You’re right. Global jihadism is currently a more insidious threat, with Islamism being far more deeply rooted in its host societies, than neo-Nazism (despite the latter being a danger &amp; on the rise too)
@graemearcher @unherd Spot on. I thought hard about tweeting this incase I too come across as anti-expertise (which I’m also not) but you make a very valid,concise&amp;precise point. Political opinions that flow from an expert *even when concerning their expertise* are political, not technical,  opinions

@Alyaalsultani @HarasRafiq Nothing you said doesn’t equally apply to the term’s misuse for blasphemy, which is a bigger problem considering states around the world enforce this at pain of death. Using accurate language helps isolate the real problem. The far-right’s weaponisation is still anti-Muslim hate
@Daveyarcha @Billbrowder Precisely. See: https://t.co/Q6kivY1W4x

@Alyaalsultani @HarasRafiq Yep. It’s never that simple, but the word “anti-Muslim hate” covers your concern. Whereas “Islamophobia” has been, and is, deliberately used to silence critique (it doesn’t help that it’s semantically wrong too)

Let me be clear (because people who study, know their field &amp; have years of experience - aka experts - know more about this than the multitudes of arm chair commentators) I use the term ‘crash out’ because there is near unanimity that leaving with ‘no deal’ will be very painful
This is a total mess. And everything I’ve been predicting for months: Brexiters &amp; Leavers are now united in opposing Theresa May’s disastrous deal. Britain has 3 options 1) leave with this terrible deal (the best we were likely to get) 2) crash out with no deal 3) do not leave https://t.co/2stz6E6XO0

@TracyAnnO Argh.. what do I even do with that? 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Even with insults against immutable characteristics, such as racial insults in drama,creative licence always allowed their broadcast. The situation feared now is blasphemous content (eg: against Islam) becomes more sacred than even creative use of insults against protected traits
For those unable to think in layers: it is not a ‘restriction on speech’ to curtail insults against immutable characteristics. I am not referencing the law here. Legally you’re still free to be an ass &amp; insult anyone. We are talking about codes for broadcast content on the BBC 🤦🏽‍♂️
Curtailing insults against sex,race&amp; sexuality (immutable characteristics) makes sense. But to protect the offended whose *idea* (religion) is scrutinised, amounts to a blasphemy law through the backdoor. Such mission creep must be resisted. Via @NatSecSoc https://t.co/vp7XrtXdBj

@TracyAnnO @lucianaberger Post Pittsburgh massacre, to single out and libel Jews with such libel is grossly irresponsible, and in my view, deeply anti-Semitic.
@joshzepps @DouglasKMurray @SamHarrisOrg @BretWeinstein @EricRWeinstein I state this again, for the record, that I do not intend to work with Pangburn again (and I got paid from Sydney, so I take this view purely for the sake of other unpaid speakers &amp; losing ticket holders). Feel free to quote me on this for anyone concerned.
@TracyAnnO @lucianaberger “Islamism” is the theocratic political ideology. Islam is the religion. It’s imperative to be anti-Islamist (ie: anti-theocracy). I am anti-Islamist. But here, he’s called you “anti-Muslim”. That is libellous. You are not anti-Muslim.

Fancy words, liberal orthodoxy, critical theory, political posturing, virtue signalling &amp; moral high ground claims aside, discriminating against 1 minority to promote another minority has never felt right &amp; never could feel right to me.

We complain about police not solving actual crime,asking us to report ‘offence’, while murders go unsolved, yet we act as if things like this or a ‘hand on the knee’ are the worst form of violent/sexual assault if they come from our political opponents. We can’t have it both ways
@second__advent It probably isn’t doctored and that still isn’t violent assault.

@mymalarkeyy I agree we’re as morally developed as we need to be as a species yet, and agree with the moral concerns vegans raise about cruelty to animals. I disagree with certain extreme vegans who are trying so hard to win the battle they will lose the war.
@Jo_Marney It was *specifically* a debate about some vegans psychologically abusing 4 yr old children, by depicting gruesome imagery to them in order to deter them from eating meat, as has actually happened in certain high street protests. And that caller called in to defend this behaviour
I didn’t write this graph, so please don’t send the typo correction to me. Thank you.
@anxiouscashew Please don’t strawman me https://t.co/W5cwfNN5wK
@Jo_Marney And that’s not the topic of debate you waded into, and not the view you supported. So kindly stop changing the goal posts. Thanks.
@mymalarkeyy See this https://t.co/qzFP9QlqdP
@Jo_Marney https://t.co/qzFP9QlqdP
@Jo_Marney You’re committing the same fallacy as them. Abuse is not only and merely the same as abuse. Wolf whistling is not as bad as rape. Killing an animal is not as bad as killing a child. Hierarchies matter. Because: https://t.co/qzFP9QlqdP
‘Nuff said. https://t.co/DxKdG0V9LG
@Jo_Marney 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
@Jo_Marney It’s not irrelevant to debate *I* was having with the vegan on my show, into which you waded in, to support the vegan arguing it’s okay to traumatise 4 yr olds. You’re sounding like those extreme leftists who argue that wolf whistling and rape are the same thing: abuse is abuse?!
@Jo_Marney Please don’t enter into my discussion and tell me what my own discussion is about. It’s a discussion I started,on my radio show,responding to vegan activists traumatising 4 year olds. I then continued said discussion on my timeline, on my own thread, which you entered. Thank you
@Jo_Marney Don’t Strawman me https://t.co/W5cwfNN5wK
@Jo_Marney It’s very relevant. You’ve said both are “wrong”. I’ve said so too, while saying one is worse than the other. I’m asking you what your view means in the real world: https://t.co/qzFP9QlqdP
@Jo_Marney Again, you didn’t answer the question: https://t.co/qzFP9QlqdP
@Jo_Marney Sorry. That’s a cop out. In the real world heirarchies for crime are a necessity, a convenience &amp; a moral imperative. Your logic suggests that prison time for gratuitous child murder should be equal to prison time for killing a fox. Do you believe that?
@mymalarkeyy And by children I specify: 4 year olds being made to watch bloody animal slaughter videos just to prove meat eating is bad, isn’t psychologically healthy for the child &amp; is totally unwarranted.
@mymalarkeyy Hi! Question of which out of 2 wrongs is worse arises only when the 2 wrongs are conflicting, and 1 needs prioritising. Context of my radio debate was about vegan activists who subject children to their grisly videos of animal slaughter. Safety of children first&amp;then I’m with you
@korbandall @lawanhawizy It might well be the polarising effect of needing to appease echo-chambers online. People who have little political footprint off social media are especially vulnerable to this
@Jo_Marney You didn’t answer my question. Let me make it easier by removing the “survival” red-herring: is the gratuitous killer of one child better morally than someone who kills 2 foxes (and doesn’t eat them)?
@jamierawsthorne 🙏🏽
@ChrisAshton59 https://t.co/W5cwfNN5wK
@Jo_Marney Is a gratuitous killer of one child a better human being than someone who eats 10 calfs over a period of time?

And here’s an example of the toxic culture we liberal Pakistanis are fighting, while you pontificate from your red-brick establishments and concert stage green rooms, betraying young girls who are raped, just so you can signal your “anti-racism” https://t.co/VYhIDzQHDT
@G_Preeny The #NotAll fallacy
@lovegen19 @_no_affiliation She went on the attack out of nowhere. Then she blocked me after one reply, but kept talking about us to her 5.6m followers. Everyone’s seen it.  Don’t lie. Thanks.
Last point for these viscous white #RegressiveLeft socialists: you’re a bunch of posh, privately educated slacktivists (oh, and a pop star). We are state-educated, brown Muslim survivors of the War on Terror. We’ll forever be more real than you. And that winds you up, terribly ✊🏽
Vicious white #regressiveleft socialists will never accept PoC breaking away from their script. Their Orientalism stinks. I kept quiet for days. But will no longer tolerate their racism against my researchers. History is against you, you fellow travellers of Islamist theocracy.
Then you want to pick a fight, rallying cry-bully @lilyallen’s 5.6 million followers &amp; a bunch of pro-Islamists, against a young Pakistani female researcher, because of your dispute with us over 1 fucking percentage point, you utter git. More like you just want to be in charge
One nasty socialist ‘activdemic’ who’s been hounding our Pakistani female Muslim researcher @munazainab for days over our 84% figure, had herself previously written 83% in a Guardian column!! So it’s OK for white socialists to talk about us,but not for us to own our conversation? https://t.co/A3v36FAgW0
When a PoC tried to deviate in any way from the socialist identity politics game of ‘obedient brown person must know where (s)he belongs’, suddenly these “anti-racists” become viscous bastards. One racist left winger even suggested I’m a “pet monkey” of the Right.
Instead,we’ve got non-Pakistani, non-Muslims, white socialists waging war on us over the exact percentage figure of 84%. As if 1% being behind even 40% of crime in one area makes it any better? Their pretence that they care for our community falls away when we go off their script
If UK Muslims make up 5% of population, half are women. So say 2.5% Muslim men. Not all Pakistanis. So say 1.5%? But some are children. So say 1% adult men? Roughly 1% of population behind 84% (cut that in half if you don’t like it) of all grooming rapes. That’s disproportionate
Because none of these white saviours of brown ppl (until we go off script, then we’re enemies of the people) &amp; pro-Islamists could accept our report,confirming the irrefutable fact that Brit-Pakistanis are disproportionately represented in grooming (rape) gangs of underage girls
Yesterday @HarasRafiq, @munazainab &amp;I had our Pakistani &amp; Muslim identities abused by vicious white socialists (some are ‘activdemics’)in alliance with Islamist apologists,as we were hounded by cry-bully @lilyallen’s mob of 5.6 million, all while she kept me blocked. Why? Thread:

@MatthewStadlen 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ 🤷🏽‍♂️
@MatthewStadlen I have my own show. Yours is too late  for me buddy 🤣
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab I just made that example up to make point dude. And British Pakistani &amp; Muslim (some have been Somali) men, is more precise. Asian is too broad.
@MatthewStadlen Happy to chat you myself next time we meet. It’s gone beyond Muna and Haras now I fear. With the Islamist fanatics rabble-roused against us by Lily and the socialist activdemic Ella.
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab Anyway, goodnight to you. Peace 🙏🏽
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab Yes, I think they took the view your questions were based on a self published blog using fake names &amp; therefore weren’t worth entertaining. Over representation is a fact. That’s what matters. Not whether it’s 84% or 46%. We Brit-Pakistani men are only roughly 1.5% of the country
@BrianRecca When a pop star with 5.6m followers openly bullies a British Pakistani woman (working on my behalf)speaking out against gangs of organised rapists in our own community, who is a survivor of one such brief experience, forgive me for defending the weak here (clue: not the pop star)
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab This is type of gaslighting that happens to Muslims in our community who dare to speak out. Imagine how bad it is for Muna https://t.co/0IMN6rfgEM
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab Matt,I’ve seen your tweets to Lily and Ella. I ignored them (despite troubling me)to give you precisely the benefit of doubt you request here. But this allegation made here alarmed me. As Muna *has* been bullied. I asked you. And you answered. I thanked you. I thank you again 🙏🏽
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab To be clear: report doesn’t claim to be a final word. Simply states ‘over-representation’ is undeniable. It is. Those who take issue with their right to write a report &amp;speak about this ‘over representation’ will also have an issue with me (not referring to you specifically here)
@MatthewStadlen @QatarWatch123 @HarasRafiq @munazainab Withdraw my question? I was asking whether the allegation here made was accurate, as it’s the “first I’ve heard of it”. Thank you for answering. I will now ask Muna. She &amp; Haras have been viscously attacked by a mob raised by Lily Allen’s 5.6million and I will not stand for that
@BrianRecca Mate, you sound like a bloody school teacher telling off a child. Ask. Don’t tell. Thanks.
@LisaMoorish She’s been anything but reasonable. Bullying Muna, calling the report “trash” “worst piece of research”. I only started replying today Lisa. Because I’m sick &amp;tired of left wing bullies. Especially ones who claim to be speaking on Pakistanis’ behalf. It’s all on twitter to search

@DrEllaC @66ALW99 @david__ian @omaromalleykhan https://t.co/n3M8xSjBWQ
@LisaMoorish Nothing in the tone, nor content of that socialist ‘activdemic’ nor Lily Allen, nor yours, has been ‘respectful’. They’ve (especially the socialist ‘activdemic’) been bullying @MunaZainab from the start. And you’ve been particularly viscious about me. Enough is enough.

@BadgeSmiley @allthatchas He’s a leftists racist coward, running away like a prick. I hate their righteous superiority complex. I see right through them, and I flush them out like lice. This one slipped up and abused me racially, and is now running and hiding.

@Jo06012 @allthatchas Yeah, racism matters for you lefties until one of your own is racist, then it suddenly doesn’t. Fuck that. We ain’t your pets.

@RaisedToRespect No. Somebody wrote something outlandishly racist and then deleted it. Look, and ask why his tweets are all deleted.
@StevePeers @jdportes @JamesBurns642 @MalyRade Not you. My complaint is of libel, which is a legal matter against Jonathan. (In)accuracy is interesting,but not actionable. I would’ve engaged with you on the meaning of my words (which only I know) if the legal matter hadn’t arisen. Now it has, I’m seeking to resolve that first
@jdportes @JamesBurns642 @StevePeers @MalyRade Right, in other words: disavow all of what you invited people to read, or I will libel you and hold you hostage to the libel until you disavow it. You’ll hear from me. Thank you. Goodbye.
@RealWolfBadger @allthatchas There ain’t nothing to see I’m afraid. The racist coward has deleted everything, and is running. Show yourself, you leftist fascist. I’m here, and I will screen grab your deleted tweet.
@jdportes @StevePeers @JamesBurns642 @MalyRade Someone who invites someone to read, is under no obligation to state their (dis)agreement of said words, before being safe from being libelled by a detractor. You attributed something to me I did not say. I ask you one last time to apologise, or I will take further action.
@jdportes @JamesBurns642 @StevePeers @MalyRade Wow, just admit you’re fucking wrong man. What’s wrong with you? I didn’t say what you said I said, and now you’re shifting the goal posts.

@jdportes @JamesBurns642 @StevePeers @MalyRade “...that the ECHR has imposed new law against blasphemy against Islam across Europe” This is a patently false attribution to me. I would’ve thought academics could see that. Apologise &amp; retract.

Inquiry into this grooming gang began in 2010. Media is saying Sikh ringleader converted to Sikhism five years ago (that would be 2013). Sky News is reporting he was a Muslim prior to converting. But when were they charged, and tried? Trial unlikely to have lasted 8 years right?

@DoomlordVek Yes. Though type 1 gang rape sexual offences against underage girls overwhelmingly appear to be disproportionately a British Pakistani Muslim problem
@inthezoneuk https://t.co/n5fBQDBv3v
@scribblercat Probably not. Our research so far indicates that when considering the disproportionate nature of the attackers, Sikh guy would likely be an outlier.

This is important &amp; correct. It is not only many Muslims who got radicalised, but white working classes too (though at a smaller scale &amp; lower threat level).
