@STrimel @highserenity49 @Duchampia @JudyWoodruff @ddiamond @LisaDNews @NewsHour That's why the mass humanitarian crises from Syrians fleeing the Syrian conflict, African refugees fleeing to Europe, etc. remain domestic political issues: because there is no international authority compelling countries to comply with international refugee conventions
@STrimel @highserenity49 @Duchampia @JudyWoodruff @ddiamond @LisaDNews @NewsHour There isn't a court of law that has been established to successfully prosecute countries for failing to adhere to the Convention on Refugees; international human rights law still prioritizes states' claims of national security to regulate admission
@matunos @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour ICC doesn't have authority of universal jurisdiction. It's constricted by Articles 12 &amp; 13 of the Rome Statute. I thought only individual states could exercise universal jurisdiction.
That's why the mass humanitarian crises from Syrians fleeing the Syrian conflict, African refugees fleeing to Europe, etc. remain domestic political issues: because there is no international authority compelling countries to comply with international refugee conventions
@g8r84 @AlaskaLadyDee @SingerLouise @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour Even if the U.S. Senate ratified the ICC, it cannot be applied retroactively *and* other countries wouldn't allow retroactive prosecution because that would establish precedent for their own governments to be open to retroactive prosecution
@Amazed1950 @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour Long-established norms of law prevent retroactive prosecution for crimes committed before they were codified as crimes.
There isn't a body of law that has been established to successfully prosecute countries for failing to adhere to the Convention on Refugees; international human rights law still prioritizes states' claims of national security to regulate admission https://t.co/gePMwNMwcV
@LunaticFringer I don't understand your question. French-Vietnamese accords apply only to relations between France &amp; Vietnam; they hold no authority over actions of U.S. government against immigrants &amp; refugees.
@Spireship Nothing from Nuremberg bound states to refrain from abhorrent behavior. Post-WW2 Geneva Conventions developed legal foundation for war crimes; crimes against humanity not defined until Rome Statute of ICC, c. 1998.
@Spireship Nuremberg Trials didn't establish international humanitarian law - it was 1st attempt by international community to apply concepts of law &amp; justice to atrocities during conflict.
Agree with most of your assessment. However, ICC cannot retroactively prosecute, and ICC didn't come into force until 2000s https://t.co/oCTFbOVhrA
@shadur @Duchampia @JudyWoodruff @ddiamond @LisaDNews @NewsHour The U.S. is a long-time signatory of &amp; state party to the Geneva Conventions: https://t.co/96pwNIBiuf.

@Q56Suezee @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour No it can't. The only way the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court can open an investigation against nationals of non-party states (like the US) is by having the matter referred by the UN Security Council; see articles 12 &amp; 13 at https://t.co/MBv9F0Y3Jf
@purejuice6 @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour No. See Articles 12 &amp; 13 of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court: https://t.co/MBv9F0Y3Jf.
@cwcooper @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour Attempts to do so would conflict with the body of international human rights law developed since Nuremberg, including the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court
@cwcooper @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour That's because Germany lost World War II, and the Allies had the political power to convene Nuremberg. There is no equivalent dynamic for other countries to convene a special court to try U.S. nationals.
@bilal_wilson @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour The Human Rights Council doesn't have authority to prosecute for crimes against humanity; that can only come through the International Criminal Court
@BellaFlokarti @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour Thanks for the correction. The U.S. is a signatory, but hasn't ratified - so is not subject to its jurisdiction: https://t.co/AtusKQRuWw
@g8r84 @AlaskaLadyDee @SingerLouise @cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour For the US to accede to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the U.S. Senate would have to ratify - just like any other international treaty
It requires applying pressure to our courts, demanding media coverage of the atrocities, economic boycotts of collaborators, and citizen-initiated recall efforts of members of Congress who are doing nothing to hold this administration accountable. https://t.co/pwYdcWHLkf
@cabinloon @YarmondShore @annepearl1 @ESGreco @JudyWoodruff @LisaDNews @NewsHour A technicality: The U.S. isn't a signatory to the International Criminal Court, so U.S. nationals cannot be charged or tried by that body. US impunity from international action requires civilian resistance.
@Duchampia @JudyWoodruff @ddiamond @LisaDNews @NewsHour A technicality - they're not war crimes because there is no active conflict between the US &amp; the countries these children are fleeing. Crimes against humanity, maybe, but no violations of any of the Geneva Conventions.

@JamesViser @JasonCrowCO6 @Vote4Levi Because let's be honest, if @Vote4Levi *had* gotten DCCC support, would he be saying that's unfair interference &amp; be urging the DCCC to back out? You've been on the #copolitics &amp; #coleg threads enough that you know this, too.
@JamesViser @JasonCrowCO6 Hi James, I think we've wrangled here before. If you're supporting @Vote4Levi because he's not Jason Crow, cool, that's your jam. But that's not what my thread was about; my thread was about the false narrative that Jason unjustly has the support of the "Democratic Machine."
And he shouldn't be vilified for showing up because his opponent has made poor political decisions on how he has run his campaign. [/THREAD]
...because @JasonCrowCO6 has been in the trenches on issues in Colorado, affecting Coloradans, for YEARS. He's served on the Governor's Veterans' Commission. He has been at rallies &amp; marches, long before deciding to run. He is known by local folks...
... party leaders like Steny Hoyer. It's disingenuous for @LeviTilleman to contend he's getting an unfair shake when he hasn't given a fair shake to the people who have been on the ground. So at the outset, I disclosed where I stand in this race; that's...
... It's *INCREDIBLY* disrespectful of the work that has been done that opens the door for *either* @JasonCrowCO6 or @LeviTilleman to have a shot in #CD6. And the decade-plus of work locally means relationships with political donors &amp; national...
That can be characterized as taking on political insiders, but to those who have been in negotiations with state officials, and who have raised money &amp; knocked on doors to get the votes to advance common-sense policies for #Colorado families...
There's been disappointment that instead of reaching out to the grassroots advocates who have been in the weeds working for progressive policies at #coleg FOR 10+ YEARS, @LeviTilleman hasn't bothered to learn from those who have local expertise.
... are really sad &amp; disappointed by @LeviTilleman's campaign. This is a state where relationships matter. And respect for your opponent matters. And where understanding who has been doing work on issues you campaign on matters.
I'm gonna disclose up front I support @JasonCrowCO6 in this race. And I've since moved out of Colorado. But I, and a *whole bunch* of people who have been worked and volunteered in the ground in #copolitics &amp; the #coleg for more than a decade...

@incantalupo @jbouie 7 / I believe Angie &amp; Matthew should have equal opportunities to thrive &amp; succeed long-term. But because one family can afford high-quality childcare whereas another family uses family &amp; friends, these two children's life trajectories already are unequal.
@incantalupo @jbouie 6 / How equal do you think Angie &amp; Matthew will be in terms of readiness to learn in preschool or kindergarten?
@incantalupo @jbouie 5 / Angie's childcare is provided by someone experienced in &amp; educated about early childhood development and behavioral indicators for developmental, speech or hearing delays. Matthew's childcare isn't.
@incantalupo @jbouie 4 / Baby Matthew's childcare is hobbled together through the generosity of friends &amp; family, who rotate days &amp; times of coverage. There isn't consistent interaction or stimulation, or tracking normal vs abnormal in Matthew's behavior or responses.
@incantalupo @jbouie 3 / Now imagine two children, born on the same day. Baby Angie has socio-economic circumstances where her childcare includes regular interaction &amp; stimulation with a consistent provider who knows what's normal &amp; what's abnormal for Angie.
@incantalupo @jbouie 2/ The vast, vast, vast majority of neurological development happens before a child's 3rd birthday. This is when the biological foundation is developing for children to be able to socialize, have critical thinking skills, adapt to stress/adversity, etc.

@politiwars @PatriciaMazzei @alexburnsNYT @FrancesRobles @abscribe Thanks for specifying. It was a horrible breakdown of multiple systems and from the NY Times piece, also highlights problems with the siloing of information between systems. I agree that restricting gun access isn't the only thing that could have prevented this.
@politiwars @PatriciaMazzei @alexburnsNYT @FrancesRobles @abscribe Can you help me understand why not? Legitimate question - what laws &amp; protocols were in place that should have prevented his purchasing firearms?
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Agreed; enforcing current law has to happen - as well as fixing laws that aren't &amp; ensuring sufficient funding for the current laws to be implemented
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper I've shared my opinions (I'm not shy) but haven't read yours. How do you think violence that happened in your community could have been prevented?
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Actually I take it back, I do believe that gun owners who have been convicted of domestic abuse or who have a restraining order against them for stalking, violent threats &amp; related patterns of behavior shown to correlate to gun violence, should lose their guns.
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper I disagree with arguments that regulating the sale, ownership &amp; use of guns - because we only get into these debates about guns, never knives or tanks - should not be enacted in part because they're inconvenient
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper And why haven't we demanded increased safety in guns' design - like applying fingerprint or biometric technology - or some other technology that people way more educated than I am can talk about - to reduce children, theives, etc. being able to use someone else's weapon?
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper If there's a need for that type of weapon to be used for security by non-police forces (private security, etc.), regulate the sale, ownership &amp; use to include training, safe handling, etc.
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Who is talking about taking guns away? Which of the 12 proposed federal laws to reduce gun violence would take someone's gun away? If you don't have the proposals easily accessible, they're summarized here: 	https://t.co/In3MExmMAU
@macphisto96 @Droolsum @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper üëÜüëÜüëÜ
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper If that restriction had been in place, Wednesday's shooter wouldn't have been able to use a high-capacity weapon to kill 14-, 15-, 16-, &amp; 17-year-old children, but police would still have that tool available.
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper So here's an example of a proposed regulation: restrict ownership &amp; sales of high-capacity, automatic weapons and modifiers that turn weapons from semi- to fully automatic weapons (I mean single-fire to multiple-fire, so my terminology could be wrong).
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper But it's much easier to add a reductionist meme into a thread than engaging in thoughtful discussion about what can be done to prevent people from dying
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Courts have said none of the rights conferred in the Constitution are absolute - no "fire" in a crowded theater despite 1st Amendment to free speech - but can be balanced &amp; weighed for the public good
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper 2nd amendment includes the phrase "well regulated" so legislative efforts to regulate gun ownership don't contradict the 2nd Amendment
@Droolsum @macphisto96 @ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper I'll bite: 2nd Amendment was crafted, in part, to give slave owners a legal right to arm themselves to protect against rebellions by slaves seeking their independence
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper To stop expecting law-enforcement officers to also be mental health counselors when dispatched, and so many other proposals that have been recommended, shows a failure of their political courage to risk their office if it means preventing these avoidable tragedies
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper This comes down to political courage. Every Republican and Democrat in Congress who has blocked legislative efforts to curb access to military-style guns, to stop research into gun violence as a public health priority, to reduce access to mental health care... 1/2
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper What do you believe was never going to work? That if any of the 12 proposed law changes were passed would not have reduced gun violence? Or the 2012 Task Force?
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper I don't know whether the EOs that were signed are still in effect or have been included in the massive rescission of EOs under this administration, so I can't answer that. Nor do I have links to research measuring non-occurrences - a challenge not unique to gun violence.
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Worth reading for those 2 years, as well: https://t.co/MUsvfrRJe8
@ChrisJNFL @macphisto96 @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper Wait, so only the 2 years when Democrats were in the majority count? So the 6 years of Republican majorities &amp; refusal to advance the 12 Congressional proposals just get ignored?
@ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper The plan included 23 executive actions, signed immediately by Obama, and 12 proposals for Congress.The proposals were opposed by the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and opposition was expected by Republican and some Democrat legislators. 4/4
@ChrisJNFL @JodeneRdc @jspreier @jaketapper On Jan 16, 2013, Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence: closing background check loopholes; banning assault weapons &amp; high-capacity magazines; making schools safer; &amp; increasing access to mental health services. 3/4
