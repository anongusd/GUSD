(2014) https://t.co/P3qVJxyTYW	A. Lawlessness has made Falfurrias, TX "part of increasingly vast and lucrative human smuggling hub." 	B. Defines "rape tree" - trees where bras &amp; underwear are hung by coyotes who smuggle [and abuse] women 	17/25
(8/4/2017): https://t.co/BEATTCSnNT mentions:	A. "Human rights advocates say Black women and other women of color make up the bulk of trafficking victims."	B. Houston is hub because of proximity to Mexico.	C. Domestic victims as well as international victims. 	16/25
C. Alfred T. Tribble Jr., an FBI supervisor who oversees the human trafficking unit in Houston: "Houston is fertile ground for trafficking because of its proximity to the border, its sexually oriented businesses, its diversity and the demand for sexual services" 15/25
B. "When trafficking victims escaped their clutches, gang members crossed borders to hunt them down and force them back into service, according to sworn testimony by two investigators at several federal court detention hearings last fall." 	#BuildTheWall 14/25
Next (1/22/2018): https://t.co/WLtZIYhpaR	A. An investigation into a brothel found international scheme "run by a ruthless sex trafficking ring that lured undocumented women into prostitution with false promises of restaurant jobs." 13/25
Next post (11/14/2018): https://t.co/Xj1PlvMbTW	"People see Houston as a hub for #humantrafficking b/c of its proximity to the Mexican border, access to the I-10 highway corridor &amp; access to two international airports &amp; one of the largest ports in the world." 	#BuildTheWall 12/25
Next article (2/16/2018): https://t.co/0s8R94ULXj 	A-It is both a domestic and international problem, affects suburbia	B-TX State Rep Joan Huffman gives stat: more than 300,000 people in Texas are victims of human trafficking w/ almost 80,000 of that number being children. 11/25
E-FBI special agent Suzanne Bradley: "People see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to the border...also has access to the I-10 hwy corridor,...it's very easy to get them on that I-10 route &amp; disperse them throughout the country." 	#BuildTheWall 10/25
D. "For uninitiated, it's hard to imagine thousands kidnapped... in Mexico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the US, where they serve as sex slaves."	#BuildTheWall 9/25
C. Quotes Houston YMCA human trafficking caseworker Rachel Alvarez quoted: "I thought human trafficking was just a crime that happens in third world countries. Until I started looking in my country. 	(NOTE-I was same until my 2014 research for @tppatriots border documentary)	8/25

I watched part of @realdonaldTrump's roundtable meeting on @theHill's Facebook page yesterday. Many of the comments were rude toward the President - not surprising. What was surprising was how many are so quick to ignore &amp; mock the realities and tragedies along the border. 5/25
Thanks to @realDonaldTrump and the round table meeting yesterday, more people are learning about the realities along the border including (but not limited to) #humantrafficking. 4/25
Sadly, #HumanTrafficking IS a reality in America and across the world. (Thank you #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay for bringing attention to it.)		(Keep reading thread for links to article about the problem.) 3/25
In 2014, had we included too many the issues of modern-day slavery in our Border States of America documentary, people would not have accepted it as real. 	It is difficult to believe and accept such problems are happening in America - the land of the free. 	#BuildTheWall 2/25

.@SenKamalaHarris should apologize immediately to ICE officers and their families, unless she wants to further erode public confidence in her party‚Äôs ability to govern. #TeaParty #MAGA
ICE officers confront the violent cartels that smuggle people and drugs into our country, including the drugs at the root of America‚Äôs opioid crisis. ICE officers should be applauded for their efforts and never compared to a domestic terrorist group. #TeaParty #MAGA
ICE officers risk their lives every day when they rescue victims of sex trafficking ‚Äì they literally save women and children from rape, abuse, and torture. #TeaParty #MAGA
When @SenKamalaHarris compared ICE to the KKK during her questioning of Ronald Vitiello, President Trump‚Äôs nominee to lead ICE, she confirmed a deep-seated animus for law enforcement that has been manifesting itself among Democrats more publicly in recent years. #TeaParty
Supervisors of Elections should be more diligent in following the process as laid out by our election laws, and if they fail to do so, they ought to be removed from office to maintain confidence and integrity in our elections. https://t.co/6RBBZujkgr #TeaParty #MAGA #StopTheSteal

.@POTUS succeeded where others failed, in delivering the first major tax reform since the mid-1980s. The result? Booming economic growth, to the point where we now have more jobs open than unemployed laborers to fill them. #TeaParty #MAGA
.@POTUS has given us more healthcare freedom, which means more choices. It was under his leadership that the individual mandate ‚Äì the most hated part of #ObamaCare ‚Äì was repealed, and his administration has overturned Obama-era regulations. #TeaParty #MAGA
.@POTUS has eliminated a record number of regulations ‚Äì on average, more than 22 regulations eliminated for every new regulation put in place. This reduction in the regulatory burden is at least as important as tax reform in generating new and robust economic growth. #TeaParty
.@POTUS has worked to secure our borders. While we wait for Congress to understand the American people are serious about this issue, including building a wall, @POTUS took steps via executive action &amp; closed loopholes like ‚Äúcatch and release‚Äù to keep our communities safe. #MAGA
.@POTUS has implemented an America first agenda: He has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Climate Change accord, withdrawn the U.S. from President Obama‚Äôs terrible Iran Nuclear Deal, moved the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, &amp; replaced NAFTA with the U.S.M.C.A. #MAGA
Democrats apparently believe that basic legal precepts like innocence until proven guilty, due process, and the need for corroborating evidence are outdated and no longer necessary. #TeaParty #MAGA
Democrats believe the United States should allow its interests to take a back seat to so-called ‚Äúinternational‚Äù interests ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs the Paris Climate Change accord, or the Iran Nuclear Deal, or NAFTA, or Palestinian opponents of Israel. #TeaParty #MAGA
Democrats believe we should provide amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants, &amp; refuse to fund a wall on the southern border ‚Äì even though many of their own leaders argued for (and VOTED FOR!) precisely that just a decade ago, when the problem was smaller than it is now. #MAGA
Democrats believe we should pay a tax penalty if we dare choose not to purchase an ObamaCare-compliant health insurance plan, where premium costs (and deductibles, and co-pays) have more than doubled in the last few years. #TeaParty #MAGA
Democrats believe we should leave in place the stifling regulatory burden they enacted over eight years of control in the White House, no matter how much those regulations killed job creation efforts. #TeaParty #MAGA
Democrats think we should raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals, and have promised to repeal last year‚Äôs tax reform ‚Äì the tax reform that‚Äôs helping to create the best jobs environment most of us have seen in our lifetimes. #TeaParty #MAGA
Democrats believe sluggish economic growth ‚Äì like the anemic 1.5% economic growth in President Obama‚Äôs last year in office ‚Äì is satisfactory, and that we should settle for it. #TeaParty #MAGA

Sen. Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, one of the drafters of the 14th amendment, clarified that ‚Äòsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äô meant ‚Äònot owing allegiance to anybody else‚Äô ‚Äî that is, the parents were not citizens of another nation. #TeaParty #MAGA

The bottom line is that the #TeaParty have always worked within the system to win elections peacefully to enact the changes we seek, and the other side. #JobsNotMobs https://t.co/ZuZ5oivufB
The #teaparty was not &amp; is not violent. We never tried to publicly shame people in inappropriate ways. At town halls things got heated and voices were loud, but we didn‚Äôt run people out of restaurants, vandalize democrat offices, engage in violence or destruction of property. https://t.co/moL5ILWVve
The angry, Democrat #mob deliberately harasses, intimidates, and frightens people they disagree with; we have Tea Party meetings with guest speakers, and phone bank, and go door to door to peacefully persuade others to vote for our values.  #JobsNotMobs https://t.co/ST4SgGNT8o
The angry #mob teaches how to get arrested. The #teaparty taught and teaches classes about the Constitution. https://t.co/HOonH8uqLa #JobsNotMobs https://t.co/r6Lev7Hylo
The angry #mob brings weapons to their protests; we, the #TeaParty and #MAGA @realdonaldjtrump supporters, bring American flags. They want mob justice; we want justice based on the Constitution - and that means due process and the presumption of innocence for all.  #JobsNotMobs https://t.co/axw0TCBqnI

We urge Missouri voters to rally behind Josh Hawley in November and send him to Washington, DC.

Josh will work hard in the Senate to repeal ObamaCare and overturn Congress‚Äô illegal special exemption from that odious law.
TPPCF congratulates @HawleyMO on his victory in the Missouri Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Josh has already demonstrated his determination to stand up for the best interests of all Missourians with his work in the Attorney General‚Äôs office.

Consequently, on behalf of Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, I am pleased to endorse Jody Hice for Congress, and I urge all voters in Georgia‚Äôs 10th congressional district to make a plan to be a voter for him in the May 22 primary and the November general election.
Jody is an avowed opponent of excessive government spending, and demonstrated that most recently when he voted against the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill.
Jody was outspoken in his demands for the impeachment of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who oversaw the destruction of evidence under congressional subpoena and spent years stonewalling Congress‚Äô demands for more information regarding the investigation of the IRS‚Äô targeting.
He has regularly fought to live up to the conservative values and principles on which he campaigned, even when that required him to stand up to the party leadership.
Since coming to Congress after the 2014 elections, @CongressmanHice has been a strong constitutional conservative. He became a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and, after the 2016 elections, joined its board.
