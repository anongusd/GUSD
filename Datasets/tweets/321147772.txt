Q: What‚Äôs your stance on gun control		Warren says that no child should be afraid to go to school or afraid to go to the playground. She says ‚Äúit shouldn‚Äôt be harder to vote in America than it is to buy a gun‚Äù and the NRA‚Äôs influence on Congress needs to end.
Second question for Warren: can we get a bill passed to prevent government shutdowns and prevent ‚Äúmodern day slavery‚Äù of federal workers working w/o pay		Warren says we need to reopen the government and says the president is treating ‚Äúhuman beings like pawns in a political game.‚Äù
Warren's went through the history of redlining. She points out the current gap between white home ownership and black home ownership. "That's not an America that's working for everyone," she says.
Warren says she‚Äôs spent her adult life focused on figuring out why life is rockier for working class people. She says she‚Äôs also focused on ‚Äúwhy it‚Äôs so much rockier for African-Americans?‚Äù

"This is more than a campaign, this is a movement," Nixon says. She says the election for the nomination may be over but "the fight for the soul of the Democratic Party is just beginning."
"Progressive rhetoric is not enough," Nixon says to applause.
"I'm not discouraged, I'm inspired and I hope you are too. Before a single vote was cast we already won," Nixon says. She says they've fundamentally changed the political environment and what's expected from a Democratic candidate.
"When others were underestimating us he did not," Cynthia Nixon tells the crowd. "And he spent accordingly."
Mitchell says that pushing former IDC members out puts Gov. Cuomo on notice: "He has no more excuses and nobody in Albany has anymore excuses." He says if politicians in Albany now know if they keep governing like Republicans they'll have consequences on election day.

I've enjoyed everything I've learned from #NABJ17 but we're hustling backwards if we don't figure out ways to include our whole community.
There has to be a way to make this more accessible for people. Webinars/livestreams from key convention workshops should be a thing.
Often when these journalists do make it here they face things like this: https://t.co/jlNxqmbGJk
Crucial feedback on my clips and making the connections to put me in touch with the places where I'd love to see my byline published.
I know, because I'm one of them. If it hadn't been for my own hustle and the support of my family I'd be sitting at home rather than getting
2/2 behind expensive paywalls.Journalists from low income and rural communities often can't shoulder the cost to come to these conventions
1/2 We're here to talk about inclusion in newsrooms and shaping narratives but we miss valuable perspectives by having these conversations
Lots of takeaways from from #NABJ17. We need to make careers in journalism more accessible to people in low-income and rural communities.
