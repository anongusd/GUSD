@charlimithinks @drawandstrike It was my understanding that Steele had started looking at trump under free beacon (Bush) funding, and that he planned to move forward without funding cause of the importance at hand, but a law firm stepped in (Clinton’s) with funding to provide resources and finish the work
@charlimithinks @drawandstrike The service never ended. It was too important. The burden of payment was just shipped from one presidential family, Bush’s, to another, Clinton’s. The investigation into a foreign power meddling in a POTUS election was and is a bi-partisan issue. We should be thanking Steele.
@drawandstrike How come you don't stress the fact that it was the GOP establishment, the bush's, that initially hired Fusion GPS? Also, you seem to think the FBI didnt have their own investigation running simultaneously.

@WinstonJournal When was the last time the NSA raided your home? Or the CIA hacked into your phone to steal photos or other evidence to blackmail you. That doesnt happen here because we have a judicial system. Your "Deep State" is made up foolery
@WinstonJournal STOP your bullshit about a deep state! Those are Americans who go to work everyday (now without pay) work long days to keep you and I safe!
@WinstonJournal or have some compromising material on that. That is GOP and Dem alilke.
@WinstonJournal We reduce our debt and get out of this mess by publicly indicting and trying a sitting president for being an agent of a foreign power. We get all these politicians out of office who either took money from the wrong (kremlin financed) donors...
@WinstonJournal definitely not by giving the richest among us more tax pay money.
@WinstonJournal Intelligence Community that has powerful capabilities and uses those powers to keep Americans safe. The lieing about WMD's was done by politicians not by the intelligence community, get your facts right.
@WinstonJournal What happened to JFK is still classified so dont act like you know. And one prevailing theory was it was a Russian plot....go figure
@WinstonJournal You can try, but all of his "accomplishments" hurt....like tax cuts effect us by exploding America's debt. Or pulling out of Syria/middle east conflicts effects us because we will now invite terrorists to our shores. The great deal maker shut the gov down over poor negotiating.
@WinstonJournal And What of our status quo does he threaten? The fact that this country is built on immigrants? News flash...unless your native american, we are all immigrants
@WinstonJournal Terrified possibly because he acts in the interest of and at the direction of a foreign enemy. Who is the deep state? I thought it was Comey, but he is gone...so who else in this "deep state." Is it the intelligence community? You want to destroy our intelligence community?

@AyeshaMoore @taxxess @FiliaultFrance @Freeyourmindkid When you describe Russian Disinformation by a meme or marginalizing it’s effort to a couple thousand dollars of investments on ad buys, you are fooling yourself into believing it’s not more intricate than it really is.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump he needs a safe space
@kylegriffin1 Welcome to the party
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump That’s your uncle?!? Woah your like a really bad person
@taxxess @FiliaultFrance @AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid It’s very frustrating, almost as if they are trying to push a Russian Disinformation Campaigns don’t work on us...line of thinking. It’s dumb, misinformed and plays right into the hand of a disinformation campaign
@FiliaultFrance @taxxess @AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid That’s more effective, to amplify current divisions then try to create new ones!
@AyeshaMoore @downriver_b @Freeyourmindkid Immune or deaf! There’s a difference
@FiliaultFrance @taxxess @AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid Few thousand? Come on, it not just memes. It’s fake social media profiles, pages, articles published by msm based off the fake media. It’s not a couple memes!
@taxxess @Freeyourmindkid @FiliaultFrance @AyeshaMoore Exactly. And by pretending that it didn’t effect the black pop, it’s almost like giving it a pass and that’s dangerous.
@FiliaultFrance @AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid That’s where your wrong. The disinformation campaign succeeded in pushing apathy. It succeeded in the “my vote doesn’t count” category, a narrative that already existing and only needed a bigger microphone or additional reasons to push it main stream. It’s not HRC vs Trump prop.
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid Goodluck trying to convince others that disinformation campaigns don’t work on black pop. Instead of pointing out ways to spot it and counter it.
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid Ok. Your fooling yourself. Or you don’t understand how disinformation works.
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid A disinformation campaign is more than a meme or tweets. Your downplaying the effectiveness of it and it’s only to your own detriment.
@downriver_b @AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid So much easier? I think it’s much harder because many people are oblivious to the influence a disinformation campaign can have on unsuspecting individuals
@Freeyourmindkid @AyeshaMoore Intuition must be wack
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid They didn’t cite pizza gate...cmon you
@Freeyourmindkid @AyeshaMoore Absolutely, but what Russian disinformation has done is foster that narrative and aid in its expansion and worse
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid They are different but it’s just a meme. Your downplaying the effectiveness of disinformation campaigns
@Freeyourmindkid @AyeshaMoore That’s not the point. They all cited apathy.
@Freeyourmindkid Nonsense
@Freeyourmindkid @AyeshaMoore Crazy if you don’t think this propaganda didn’t work on the black population. This is intelligent warfare
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid Not only did it work on the black pop, they are specifically targeted because it’s easier to push the existing narrative of voter suppression/apathy than it is to create a new one
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid and It’s not one specific meme, it’s a whole narrative that’s created and repeated and repeated and it develops and becomes a common refrain. “My vote doesn’t matter”
@AyeshaMoore @Freeyourmindkid What? One whole objective of this disinformation campaign was to disenfranchise voters. Newsflash: it worked.

@Lisahhhh @BravenakBlog I’m not hating on Gillibrand, but I don’t like how the Dems all hanged up on Franken meanwhile in the GOP, they do worse but can stay on message for better or worse
@BravenakBlog And he didn’t stay and fight cause of the dems like Gillibrand who  was so quick to accuse. What he did wasn’t right, but it pales in comparison to the sitting potus and many others
@BravenakBlog Not saying he was magic, but he was clearly a man who took civil service seriously, came prepared and represented his constituents well. He led by example. I think he should have fought the accusations, it was at USO show performing for troops! Need more like him

@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton nope. that is not proof of treason. try again
@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton your distorting facts already. Clinton didnt unilaterily decide to sell a 20% stake in a canadian urianium company.

@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton I called TREASON way way way before MSM starting saying it. And its not treason to change your political believes, its treason to to conspire with a foreign adversary to defraud the US
@mut25newscenter @mikey_potatoes @geraldino_angel @POTUSisALiar @realDonaldTrump Well sure, if your phone is hot mic'd because you are a subject of an FBI investigation and you call your co-conspirators on that same hot mic'd phone, then you just been FSB-screwed ...traitor

@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch sounds like your describing the Mueller investigation. Will you be ok if he find that @realDonaldTrump conspired to defraud the US ? Will you be ok?
@Incogni507 @FrishbergBill @JudicialWatch Ok then, hope your right but they sure taking their sweet time. Unlike Mueller who has over 100 indictments and guilty pleas so far.

@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Actually I never like Hillary. I just hate traitors more.
@Incogni507 @FrishbergBill @JudicialWatch Prosecute, if not then quit crying.
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Well since the GOP is in power they should do something about it if the facts fit the case. Unfortunately, they don’t. I’m all for holding people accountable regardless of political belief, but facts are facts. And in this case they don’t lead to criminality.
@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton Hahaha you mean the movement where the Kremlin used shutterstock photos on memes to try to fool Americans into thinking people are really leaving the Dem Party instead of running to it. Your either hopeless or a Kremlin account.
@lebel1886 Who? Who was called as witness and died?! You guys love this don’t you?
@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton I say UNINTELLIGENT because you believe a narrative that is false just because it was repeated so often. You don’t question the facts, as long as they lead to conclusions you agree with. That’s dumb.
@lebel1886 Haha you think Clinton has kompromat on Sessions?? That’s rich! Sessions recused from Russia Conspiracy Investigation, not Clinton email, Uranium One or other Clinton dealings that you people want to make criminal.
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Sucks to be GRU, traitor
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Just ask Guccifer2.0
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch “Russia if your listening....” your fearful leader
@RWR1776 @JudicialWatch @adarpe Or both! Probably both
@RWR1776 @JudicialWatch @adarpe Because you idiots (and when I YOU, I include you with Russian Intel, Trump, SeSsions, and the whole Treason bunch in Congress) can find anything to indict her on! Either you too incompetent or she’s not as bad as they told you.
@plkarter @JudicialWatch @SenSchumer @SenWarren @NancyPelosi @NYGovCuomo All those mentioned are in the minority. It’s irrelevant if they support or don’t, they have no power. If you think Hillary did something illegal, you should be mad at Trump and Session for not holding her to account. Or maybe there’s nothing there and that pisses you off more
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Yea, If the FBI found nothing, Trump DOJ found nothing, Russia found nothing...but YOU...YOU found it! You solved the case! Moron!
@W_T_F_smh @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton Well she’s been investigated longer than any public official...and still not an indictment, just false accusations to rile up unintelligent people.
@FrishbergBill @JudicialWatch If there was a scent of criminality, Trump and Sessions would have been all over it. You think they letting her slide by? Nah, it’s just propaganda that’s you’ve been fooled into believing.
@ctd1500a @JudicialWatch Nope. That is not proof, that’s your misguided opinion based on all the misdirection your brain was fed. Wake up! You’ve been conned aka donned.
@SpencerPillman @JudicialWatch Exactly! Why?! Because it’s a distraction from the real criminals.
@Luckydawg @JudicialWatch Russia, Trump and Sessions believe you, but the facts done.
@ShmiddySydney @JudicialWatch Russia went thru them, it’s a nothing burger. DOJ tried to obfuscate facts of Uranium One to show some culpability, that didn’t work either. There’s no bloody glove to plant either, sorry. She’s not what they told you.

Michael Caputo is the worst kind of traitor. He tries to play both sides to gain sympathy just to insert some falsehoods in the narrative. He is a traitor and DOJ must prosecute!
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh @facebook https://t.co/DE5pOziUlB
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh Irrelevant
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh Do you have a @Facebook account? You can check to see if your data was stolen and used by Cambridge Analytica to help micro-target propaganda created at The Internet Research Agency (St Petersburg, Russia)
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh Good! It should be! It should be very troubling!
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh @FBI Ask that question Ukraine, Georgia, UK Brexit and other countries that Russia has meddles in their elections. It’s not like this is their first merry go round
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh It’s clear you haven’t done any research to the contrary. In short the answer to your question is Yes, but it’s a very long Intelligence campaign. It’s worked elsewhere in the world, it’s worked here and it’s worked on you! WAKEUP! Your a casualty in the war on information.
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh @FBI Well it’s bad cause it shows a pattern of behavior that is very suspect. It shows that when repeatedly confronted by enemy foreign officials, they didn’t report it to authorities they tried to use it to their benefit to defraud the US
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh Well you would have to understand how information warfare works and how effective propaganda is. did anyone force their hand at the voting booth no, but did they use misinformation, organize fake events/protests to trick Americans and cause stronger divisions in communities, YES
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh You would also read that most campaign officials had meetings with people connected to Russian Intelligence and not only failed to report these interactions to @FBI as is standard procedure, but also lie and Conceal their interaction to the press and investigators when confronted
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh you wouldn’t read that they voted in the election, foreign nationals voting in our election isn’t an issue. But you would read that the vote was decided by 70k votes and Propaganda created by a Russian company and distributed by Cambridge Analytica reached over 100M Americans.
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh READ! It’s all there for anyone who wants to know. You can start by reading our Intelligence Agencies report on 2016 Election Meddling. Stop making ignorant comments and READ!
@MarkRubello @PardesSeleh If it was a problem, then sure I’d agree. With you but this is not a problem and it only serves to disenfranchise people.
@MarkRubello @PardesSeleh But we currently don’t require proof of citizenship when voting and we don’t have evidence of foreign nationals voting in our elections. So why impose additional requirements to vote?
@MarkRubello @PardesSeleh because thousands of people come to the US to vote in our elections....but we just cant find any evidence of it??
@meijinsan @PardesSeleh Cambridge Analytica, The Internet Research Agency, the 3 Russian companies indicted by Mueller and multiple Russian nationals indicted as well. There now go learn something.
@PardesSeleh What? That doesnt even make sense.

@RonchoVilla @TheAtrium436 @jerry65426689 @DLoesch @tedlieu Lastly, if you think Im wrong or if I think your wrong, its doesnt matter. What matters is that once the facts are out that you (or I) not cling on to a false narrative. That if the President is curropt, we treat him as so. If he is not, we support him. Has to work both ways
@RonchoVilla @TheAtrium436 @jerry65426689 @DLoesch @tedlieu Clinton was careless with her email server, not criminal tho. Trump and Co is careless with their emails and their cell phones too, may not be criminal but they have handled classified info worse than the Clintons. See: Trump Gives Classified Intel to Russians in Oval Office
@RonchoVilla @TheAtrium436 @jerry65426689 @DLoesch @tedlieu Well the Senate is not conducting an investigation to determine criminality. Mueller is doing that, so your point that the Senate is using words that lead one to think of potential criminality is not good for Trump.

@realfuzzwuzz @FuMikechu @RhoIndustries @JackPosobiec Well it’s widely know that Trump is a subject of the investigation and based on the Mueller questions that leaked, Trump is likely under sealed indictments already. As for the evidence, let justice be done!
@StevieSleeves It’s a good point. Our intelligence community either dropped the ball on her or actively monitored her. What if we learn that Trump and Co were warned by the FBI prior to TrumpTower meeting and ignored those warning?
@realfuzzwuzz @FuMikechu @RhoIndustries @JackPosobiec Absolutely correct. It is the President’s right to fire anyone he wants, BUT if he executed his legal right in an effort to hide or conceal a criminal act, then his legal act is no longer legal, it’s now criminal.
