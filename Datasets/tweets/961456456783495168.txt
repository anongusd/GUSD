@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio something is so wrong when citizens leave a country they love, speak the language, share in the growth of a family and country. What's Up?
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio Mexico why are your valuable hard working people fleeing your Country.Why is Mexico having even the wealthy leave where they have had a good life?
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio Wall, No we need Mexico to be interactive with her Citizens to have a safe, fruitfull livehood. Provide Citizens in your Coumtry, in any Country what they need to live, work and raise a family and they will stay
@JTMYVA @realDonaldTrump Mexico has "All these people that came into their Country, they do not need to deport them to America. Fled to Mexico not to America. Mex ico Welcome them, don't deport them
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio if Mexico has them "in their Country" ? why are they not keeping them as they have them
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio never has a President and his family been thrown under the bud as President Trump and his family. Really, you will "run out of bushes to shake" you will realize that "All" before have "whitewashed their laundry"
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio i read, "Trump caught in a lie" excuse me, you followed the lie because you forgot to mention "Hilary lied" Who hasn't lied?
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio gather your forces with love not prejudices. empowerment is understanding their tactics which are, the witch hunt. Americans want America to be Godly but a compassionate President to restore America's Youth to being the finest, our Senior Citizens, Veterans, protected and secure
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio the Trump witch hunt is on so, focus on issues that will make the people happy and not just rebel. Monies to Americans Education, free college, Sports for youth, physical education,
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio Their eyes are on you, turn it around give America, restoration of God/prayer in America. Physical Education in schools. 	Work programs with Technical skills for 14+ Americans should have the skills for companies to hire Americans
@realDonaldTrump @1_scorpio stop being on the defensive. put them on hold. Strategize in tactics of importance? higher standards of education, free college tuition to American Citizens.
