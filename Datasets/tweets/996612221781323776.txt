@rick128262 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS We‚Äôll have to agree to disagree.
@rick128262 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS The fact remains, it was a Republican who acted on it and set the precedent.
@rick128262 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS That is not 100% accurate. In June 92, Senator Biden gave a speech saying a SCOTUS nominee shouldn‚Äôt be appointed, hearings held, or a vote taken up until the Nov. 92 election. One important distinction I draw is that when Biden said this, there was no vacany on the court.
@rick128262 @SenateMajLdr @POTUS Please explain.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS There should be no hearings or votes on the #SCOTUSnominee until the new Congress is seated in January 2019.  That is the precedent you have set, @SenateMajLdr McConnell.  Don‚Äôt be hypocritical.
