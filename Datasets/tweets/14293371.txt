Down Payment Assistance for First Home Buyer's in D8 zip codes: https://t.co/asvYiEe4tF
@HeidiHallTN I don't think we could afford to buy a house in Nash. In 2017 .. it's what motivates me with every zoning bill - jobs+housing= great city.
@HeidiHallTN We sold it for 72.5k ten years later to another 1st home buyer and flipped it to our home now that we got for 117.5k in 2000
@HeidiHallTN Our first home on 1990 was a HUD house on a FHA loan for 2 (unmarried)self employed women with 2k for a down payment  48k house on Due West
@HeidiHallTN There really are a lot of people working on this - ownership and leasing options are all part of the solution
And any new housing approved for build now is 12-18 mo away from move in ... the s l o w n e s s is killing me. D8 will have new in 2019 https://t.co/gV709Dq6RM
