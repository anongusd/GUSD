gatekeeping what it means to be a "good" american is the stuff of autocratic dictatorships. it has no rightful place here.
it is rooted in fear of self-reflection and an unwillingness to change and accept change - a rejection of truth, an adoption of ignorance.
blind patriotism is nationalistic in nature and toxic when adopted by a tribal majority.
constructive criticism&amp;commentary whose sole desire is to advance and improve equity and justice for all is the most patriotic thing I know.

@CaseyBuhr @Heritage He was questioned on these ideological beliefs during his confirmation hearing.
@CaseyBuhr @Heritage He's President Trump nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. He would be crafting &amp; advocating for legislation.
@CaseyBuhr @Heritage @SenSanders I understand his testimony was an attempt at remaining tolerant, but the reality is we also have his writing where he condemns a religion.
@CaseyBuhr @Heritage He was not being told not to believe that - it is his right to - he must not, however, use such affirmations to affect legislation/laws.
@CaseyBuhr @Heritage If that belief condemns large swaths of nonbelievers of Christianity, in a country full of them, it mustn't have a home in lawmaking bodies.
