Principled criticism of Israel would be especially beneficial because it would stand up against the hateful antisemitism of some on the extreme left while trying to help Israel avoid further descending in the direction it‚Äôs going.
They don‚Äôt need to condemn everything Israel does, but so long as the PM effectively functions as a racist demagogue intent on winning the right wing fringes of Israeli politics and supporting Republicans over Democrats, it‚Äôs going to become more of a partisan issue.
Lots of people have noted this, but there are enormous gains to be had for whichever Democratic Presidential candidate is the first to break with the party‚Äôs unquestioning support of Israel. The party and the base are wide apart on this, like the GOP and voters were on deficits.

There are no serious right wing criticism of this system unless you entertain literally imperialist ideas of formally conquering other countries and annexing their people and land. 		This whole thing works beautifully for America, and stepping away will only undermine us.
There are certainly legitimate leftist criticism of the post-war order, including America‚Äôs ability to impose its will on other countries, support for dictatorships, and a rejection of certain institutions while demanding poorer countries take part.
Abandoning these institutions with anything other than another massive war and a huge global economic collapse as the goal is insanity. We couldn‚Äôt have much more international power if we tried.
They allow us to project our will on anywhere in the world.		They let us set the rules and the agenda for how most of the planet operates. They make us the most important player in everything.
There‚Äôs something stupendously annoying about Republicans who reject post-war international institutions for not helping us. They serve the interests of the United States far more than anyone else. They make us powerful and impossible to ignore.

@TomTuohy1 @guardian Do you think it‚Äôs legitimate to criticize an entire group for their religious beliefs?
@TomTuohy1 @guardian Calling Jews demonic and responsible for all the world‚Äôs ills isn‚Äôt criticism with any basis. It‚Äôs just hatred without any backing or logic. You use ‚Äòfascist‚Äô as an epithet... do you know who the German fascists murdered on a similar basis? Because of these same conspiracies?
@TomTuohy1 @guardian It isn‚Äôt an opinion, it‚Äôs a fact that the book and the author are antisemitic. 		There is lots of evidence of Walker being viciously antisemitic.
