@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump Hell yes, I grew up in that era, they lined us up in school and gave us the vacs all together, none of this, go to a dr, bring me a piece of paper by X date, nope, they showed up, class canceled, and line up! I still have my flower scar, tho very faint,
@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump And now we have all these kids showing 'polio like' synptoms with devastating repercussions,  but they aren't yet saying Polio has mutated, cause ya know, we eradicated it, right? Grrr
@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump Sane with missy, but she can control at home whereas our homes are too casually toxic, even with my kids grown and gone, I have pets, and am tidy but not super vigilant like it has to be, for her to visit I gotta wash every surface with disenfectant, spray the furn, etc, I visit
@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump Yeah we love her, but honestly WHO wants to live with THAT guilt? I am not able to cope with that kinda guilt , nope not me, I know when I just gotta adult and try not to even mention it, unless necessary, it makes her feel bad and that just hurts to see
@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump I read a report that suggested the number of medical exemptions per capita is pretty low overall, i thought that a small sub school with nurse on hand wld be feasible but I am no Dr, however my sis has made me hyper aware of non vac rates climbing and they seem to LIKE the PNW üòï
@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump My sister is the same, we have to be verrry careful about our own health before we see her, we cheek kiss only and everyone has to wash religiously, using the 2 alphabets  timing, make sure we get our flu shots, even had to have a hep vaccine, the pertusis... the 'new llmlm baby'

@LoveAlwaysIris @DogginTrump I agree with the exenption, but those with actual medical exclusions are still a risk and I believe they need to be given a recourse, supplemented by us taxpayers to schooling that does not place others at risk until all R Vac'd and other than the Amish types NO religious exempt

@MikeLindblom @kcmetrobus @seattletimes How were we to know any of this, we go to the website, we go to the paper, and in this case the lack of info available put me in a dangerous yet avoidable situation, THAT is unacceptable to me, and I am still stranded, still no buses even though it rained, still no access or food
@MikeLindblom @kcmetrobus @seattletimes Good EMERGENCY services info shoukd NEVER be behind a PAYWALL, the times gets an -F on that, too. Considering this ESN is brand new, that was ridiculous.  The number of us who had lost power, used up our spare phone batteries and stayed offline to conserve batteries.

@framlingading @MattTrenter1 @kcmetrobus @MyCommTrans @SoundTransit Worse thasucks it is dangerous, i hunkered down as asked, i got supplies before those crowds hit the stores, but they are gone, and we gotta bus or drive for groceries, even the nearest gas station minimart is more than a mile. As to this, at least they can forward it not listen
@MikeLindblom @kcmetrobus @seattletimes And btw PAYWALL
@MikeLindblom @kcmetrobus @seattletimes It has stranded those who cannot walk far here in South Park, which uses #132, which comes from downtown on flat 4th Ave, go figure. Website doesn't have seamless info, checking timetables shows biz as usual. Hours of struggling to get to a stop and wait and wait... dangerous
Failure in my book! Entire community w/o any services for days on end, main arterials, flat roads, everything plowed, but no buses, advised to walk a few miles to catch other busses, great for the physically able, not so great for the rest, and what shuttles? Must be a rumor... https://t.co/cxmbgYHbbN
@framlingading @MattTrenter1 @kcmetrobus @MyCommTrans @SoundTransit That you got an answer as quickly as you did, to me THAT is an anomaly,  but loud public screaming about elderly and disabled folks stranded for days in a community that has been completely cut off, has no Safeway or such for those who are able bodied, just BAD PLANNING, &amp; new
@framlingading @MattTrenter1 @kcmetrobus @MyCommTrans @SoundTransit They are the portal, they will forward, so be it, call centers deal with worse, i went through a potentially dangerous trip because I HAD to, my bus route goes mainly on on 4th ave, flat, plowed, treated, but not High ridership, a week of shelter in place and we are now in need

Their info sites shld be SEAMLESS and INFORMATIVE
@framlingading @MattTrenter1 @kcmetrobus @MyCommTrans @SoundTransit Our city has allowed so many  exceptions to the rule to bring in corporate business and attract new taxpayers in, the neglected infrastructure for too long, do I expect YOU  to do something? No, but they are gonna hear me, you are clearly physically able to walk, good for you
@framlingading @MattTrenter1 @kcmetrobus @MyCommTrans @SoundTransit Nore than  50 years of living here, this is not such a big storm,  to cut off entire communities that ARE on flat, main arterials is new, and not ok, to be advised to either walk 2 miles one way on a flat or to walk 3 miles up a hill and to provide no other options, not good

Todays grade -F
@sharethecities @kcmetrobus Let alone in snow with either walker or cane, I need days notice to use access, and consider the difficulties I experienced in trying to figure it out ridiculous,  meanwhile, HOW DARE YOU STRAND AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY?!?

@sharethecities @kcmetrobus And no notice there on my bus, just the header with a link to ESN and there i finally find a list of busses running, had to come here to finally get specific info.

@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench So be it.
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench AS INEVITABLY it will as the corruption is laid bare, and prosecutions begin. And yes, it will be a very long time I will bet, before those who wore the Maga will be given positions of trusted power.
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench 1/The pretender to the Oval office you mean. Gerrymandering, voting fraud, closed locations, dozens of boxes of votes never counted, all by the Republicans, it says you know you can't win fairly, are insecure and frightened what will happen when the pendulum swings.
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench Not I, you, you wanna pretend that we don't see the correlation that way, be my guest. #TheMajority view those who go out in those hats, the same as the ugliness and lawlessness of the KKK and their killing hatred for nothing but color. Gross and dumb, and not ancient history.
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench 3/ They are the equivalent of the Swastika and the Klan . The stench of death that is associated with those symbols Of Nazism and the KKK, now TAINTS #MAGA items, such as your hat, hoody, t shirt's, flags, etc. All the same 'brand message', tell yourself what you will. https://t.co/fI8BIYflzo
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench 2/ A symbol of hatred, of intolerance, fear mongering, and yes, death. Turning the disatisfaction of those who are beginning to feel cheated &amp; targeting it on those who look, sound, THINK differently. Targeted by whom? Maga hats say all that and more.
@OHSNLobby @DavidAFrench 1/Only those who wear the hat say such,Too many assaults, too many packs of people grouping up and being aggressive against others, Charlottesville, you can continue to tell yourself your perspective,  or you can face that it is, has become a symbol.

@RepMarkMeadows 3/ his absolute insistence that it is all wall or another hostage or faked emergency power grab will ensure the @GOP will wait a very LONG time before you have any tru power, the country will not tolerate it, you RISK EVERYTHING for a wall that only "delays" but does not retard.
@RepMarkMeadows 2/ we DO NOT CARE which party the owner of said lands is affiliated to, we do not support it.	Enhanced fencing or cement walls in areas that experts recommend is acceptable.	$ for new hires, equipment, technology, housing, judges, this has been offered over and over, and OVER
