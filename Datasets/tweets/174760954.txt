@TheMediaInst, @JSpalter says, ‚ÄúConsumers want to feel confident &amp; protected; they‚Äôre also pretty big fans of technology-fueled progress &amp; economic growth.  The next chapter of the nation‚Äôs innovation policy should insist with determination that they can have both.‚Äù
@JSpalter @TheMediaInst: Agencies need to reflect modern realities. We‚Äôve built entire industries around the silos of cable/telecom/satellite‚Ä¶wired/wireless‚Ä¶edge/core.  As a result, we have a regulatory structure that's in fighting form for the 90s, not 2018-let alone 2025.
@JSpalter talks #cybersecurity @TheMediaInst: Our work will continue with global partners‚Ä¶to minimize current threats, while staying one step ahead of whatever comes next‚Äîperhaps providing a model for a more collaborative paradigm to truly ‚Äòsave the internet.‚Äô
@JSpalter @TheMediaInst: ‚ÄúThere is only one internet‚Ä¶and it deserves a national policy framework. On data privacy, on an #openinternet, on a framework for innovation, it's all the same. If we don‚Äôt lead on policy‚Ä¶we risk our leadership on innovation.‚Äù
@JSpalter @TheMediaInst on the fatal flaw of #TitleII: ‚ÄúIt is no longer acceptable to write rules either here in Washington or in any state that omit the most powerful and valuable‚Äîat least in terms of market cap‚Äîplayers of the digital age.‚Äù
@JSpalter @TheMediaInst lays out a path forward post-RIF: U.S. innovation policy has been dominated by hypothetical debate:  What if something bad happens?  Imagine what we could achieve if we focused all that brainpower, intensity &amp; resources on achieving great things together?
