Ivanka appeared to get warm receptions at all three of her dad's rallies today. Yet the White House repeatedly refused to release details of Ivanka’s trips to McClatchy over the span of four weeks for a reporter to cover an event.
Ivanka has only participated in a handful of quiet political events, raising questions about why she wouldn’t do more to help in a way her brother can’t — persuade centrists to support Republicans candidates in swing districts.
But others familiar with the situation said said Ivanka did not do more because her views are too liberal — unlike her brother’s, which are more in line with their father’s.
In a dozen interviews, Trump supporters and current and former aides say there’s no doubt Ivanka would be helpful to Republicans but said they assume she is not campaigning more because she has a job in the White House and three young children.

Trump filed for re-election Jan. 20, 2017, the day he was sworn in as president — earlier than any incumbent presidential candidate in decades. He began raising money immediately and held his first fundraiser for himself less than six months into office at the his hotel in DC
The fundraisers have helped Trump’s 2020 campaign amass a sizable war chest. It has already raised more than $50 million for his re-election this cycle, more than half of which has come from those two joint fundraising committees
Invitations from several fundraisers, obtained by McClatchy, show that the Trump campaign is taking the first cut of the donations. The first $2,700 collected is designated for Trump’s primary race, if there is one, and the second $2,700 is earmarked for Trump’s general election.
A person familiar with the president's thinking described him as the "most aggressive campaigner in recent presidential history" and said he will embark on an "ambitious schedule like no other in recent history."
A person familiar with the president's thinking told reporters that 1/3 of the people attending Trump rallies are actually not Republicans and need to be persuaded to vote Republican in the fall
Yet Trump’s campaign hasn’t transferred any other money to candidates or to party committees, which can receive unlimited transfers from a candidate committee. Read our story here: https://t.co/HUFiFKgv8W
Even if he gave the maximum amount of money to these 100 candidates it would be less than $250,000 total, a fraction of the millions he's raised since he became president
By the way, a person familiar with Trump's thinking said we could call the campaign for the list of 100 candidates he is sending money to. We have done that and the campaign didn't respond to questions. But we got the list anyway. Here it is:	https://t.co/19je912oKr
I was also referred to the Trump campaign for answers. We have asked questions of the campaign repeatedly but received no response.
.@realDonaldTrump will only support House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates, no legislative or states races, according to a person familiar with the president's thinking
Here's the @McClatchyDC story about Trump's 29 fundraisers raising at least $135 million. Unlike the five previous presidents, nearly half of the events benefited himself @benbwieder https://t.co/HUFiFKgv8W https://t.co/6FNZUdcuaT
.@realDonaldTrump is the first president in decades to raise money for himself in his first two years in office. I asked a person familiar with his thinking about why he was taking money from midterm candidates but received no answer.

.@hogangidley45 was asked why Eric Trump in on @POTUS’ trip to Florida. “I don't know,” he said.
.@hogangidley45; “It seems as though no matter how good the news is, the press refuses to cover it that way, and it's quite frustrating for him ... The successes continue for this president but the coverage continues to be negative. That's frustrating for him.”
On political fallout over government shutdown threats, @hogangidley45 says “There's much more at stake here than political fallout. This is about protecting a country and protecting a nation."
And Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas, who joined with Democrats last week to push for an investigation of the Trump administration for separating 2,500 migrant children from their parents at the southern border, also will benefit.
Also on the list is Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, one of the few House Republicans to support a federal ban on LGBT discrimination, who blamed Trump’s divisive rhetoric for Democratic victories in his home state this year.

"It's frustrating for officers and agents who work to support localities not supporting them," said one of the former employees who has heard complaints about sanctuary cities funding from those in the department.
"This is typical of Nielsen," one person said. "She is known for deliberately ignoring warnings that her decisions are not in keeping with the president’s agenda, but that she proceeds forcefully and simply misrepresents what she is doing."
The decision to include sanctuary cities in the current round of funding was made in the days leading up to the awarding of the grants after a discussion within the department that ended with Nielsen deciding to include the jurisdictions
“If you want to cut off sanctuary cities, then cut them off,” said Ralph King, a Trump supporter in Bedford, Ohio, who co-founded Main Street Patriots. “If you don’t want to enforce the federal laws of this country ... you don’t get the federal funding.”
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen authorized the grants despite objections of her top staff — a decision that has angered supporters who trusted Trump to make good on his campaign pledge.
Embattled Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently awarded nearly $1.7 billion in grants, some related to immigration, to states and localities across the nation, including so-called sanctuary cities, according to three people with knowledge of the grants. https://t.co/r0cace6WxE

Asked about if the summit with North Korea is still off, Trump said, “We’ll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We’re talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it. We’re going to see what happens.”
How to reach Trump? 	@realDonaldTrump credited actor Sylvester Stallone with bringing the Johnson pardon to his attention in the spring of 2018. 	But in the spring of 2017, two US senators -- McCain and Booker -- introduced a resolution urging Trump to issue the pardon. https://t.co/7PJwS7SX5K

Tonight in his speech, POTUS said that Democrats always campaign as moderates but when they come to Washington they support the “radical Pelosi agenda.”	“Can you image Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House?" he asked at the Susan B.

And more from @PressSec: "But at this point, I'd refer you to the statement the EPA put out. Again, I can't speak to a situation that I don't have a lot of visibility into, but I would refer you back to their statements."
Here's her comment: "Certainly, we'll look into the matter. I've seen the reports. I know EPA has put out a statement. At this point, I would refer you to them as we look into the incident. I don't -- I don't have a lot of visibility since, certainly, we weren't there..."

Later, in response to @HallieJackson's question, @PressSec won't say whether it's ever okay to physically tough a reporter as was done earlier today at EPA. https://t.co/PUjR2RktRO
She said she can’t comment on something she doesn’t have a lot of “visibility into.” https://t.co/PUjR2RktRO
Im response to my question, @PressSec can’t say whether she approves of EPA barring reporters and physically removing at least one reporter from its summit today. @AP @CNN
That’s not what this means. Serving as the print pooler for the day means I was one of the few reporters in the Oval Office and reported back to other reporters what he said. https://t.co/e0kGjy4QYZ

In response to a question, POTUS said there was no deal about ZTE. He said the media misreported stories about ZTE, but went out of his way to say he did not blame the reporters. "There is no deal. We will see what happens."
.@POTUS declined to say whether he trusts Kim but said so far, its a relationship that seems to be working.
.@POTUS on summit:  "We're moving along. We'll see what happens. There are certain conditions we want to happen. I think we'll get those conditions. And if we don't, we won't have the meeting."

Moon's national security adviser told reporters flying with him: "We believe there is a 99.9 percent chance the North Korea-U.S. summit will be held as scheduled. But we're just preparing for many different possibilities."
Looking back at my pool report from that day. I see I wrote this:	"Your pooler can attest to the problem as my head was hit with a	videocamera on the way into the Oval and a still camera in the room."
"You are getting worse," @POTUS told the room of reporters that. "You knocked over a table."		"It's actually a very friendly press, don't let them get you," he said to Moon, "although  they just broke a table."
That was the day POTUS became visibly irritated when jostling by a large contingent of Korean media led a lamp to be knocked off a table in the Oval Office. (Aide Keith Schiller caught it before it fell.)
I'm the print pooler today for South Korean President Moon's visit at the White House. Coincidentally I was the pooler on Moon's last visit June 30, 2018.
