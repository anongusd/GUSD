Would you tolerate increasing legal immigration levels in the United States in the absence of a welfare state?
A welfare state will always be a maximum incarceration state. For every well-meaning democratic socialist position from an @AOC, it's paired with a civil liberties position like criminal justice reform, (which we thank @realDonaldTrump for passing). Cognitive dissonance.

I'm pretty sure those Democrats in Virginia in blackface are a direct result of having confederate statues.
@redcar_tenken I was going to post that but I thought people would think I was weird
There is immense pressure in DC in the media elites and govt to be a hardcore foreign policy interventionist. The few who can survive the shaming and browbeating and hold strong against the warmongers are the rare vertebrate politician.
@E__Strobel I think we can only fix the education system outside the system. Create competing models.
Censorship culls good speech alongside bad. Take the good, you'll get the bad. Cut the bad, lose the good. Seems like reason compels us to defend all speech, and take our lumps like we ought.
I have been telling young people to learn to code for years. Many of these people are making college decisions and I want to help ensure they can always be gainfully employed. The fact that I have to worry about whether or not to say that here is a chilling affect on free speech.
@brad_lockman POTUS has some questionable judgement on his rhetoric that makes him prone to attack just due to sheer incomprehensiveness.
@jeffreyjonesmo At least add something of substance if you want to play.
So much huffing and chuffing and tut tutting from liberals if you question their socialist demigods. And now their houses are burning down, Trump's pouring kerosene all over them and I'm over here lighting cigars... and I don't even smoke cigars!
Racist, backwards Democrats have been projecting all along. That's what you get when you're so obsessed with race and identity. It's nothing but collectivist nonsense. Individualism cancels out all intersectionalist horsefeathers.
And Elizabeth Warren apologized for her blatantly racist acts, taking real jobs away from minorities, and meanwhile a month ago I had to act polite around my liberal friends while they tried to convince me she was an actual Indian based on those DNA results.
Remember when in public school they taught you that the two parties "switched?" https://t.co/pEiRsIOGH3

@Two_Plebs @DanCrenshawTX I think it's reasonable to be less tolerant of illegal immigration in that circumstance.

@5pointsupermom @jench78 They are intimately related. The illegal flow of drugs comes with the flow of humans. They intermix. And once the war on drugs is over, there's less fear of dangerous substances being introduced into the population because junkies get their fix locally, cheaply, and safely.

@Conservitarians Stripping the constitutional rights of every American within a 100 mile zone of the border isn't worth the false sense of "security" you get with a "wall."
@Two_Plebs @DanCrenshawTX Yes I'm aware of the concept thank you. What I'm alluding to is that the demand and supply issues are still there in immigration. It's an economics issue, not a cultural one. Near infinite demand for migration to the USA. Cali taxed weed at 30%. They've retained a black market.
@GooN849 If I had to bet money on it, yeah.
The US will continue to have problems of illegal immigration until we have the moral courage to do what is necessary to fix it. 1. End the War on Drugs. 2. Reform welfare. 3. Create a swift, orderly legal process that is mindful of constitutional and human rights.

Illegal immigration is basically like the Republican Party's version of the climate change issue for Democrats.   And founded on generally the same amount of facts.
@DouglasJaneway Agreed. Too late though the gates have been open since we were founded. We will be ok.
@good_water_farm @Jeffmw Are you pro life
@DouglasJaneway As it has always been since we forced hospitals to care for everyone. That's not their fault.
@DouglasJaneway If you have a welfare state then it's better to keep immigrants illegal so they don't qualify.
@DouglasJaneway If we don't have freedom then we can't have freedom, is essentially what you are saying.
@Jeffmw We survived and thrived.
@DouglasJaneway I'm pro immigration in general.
