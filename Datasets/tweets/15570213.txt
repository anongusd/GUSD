BUT, here’s the list of “NO’s” on Pelosi, most were on a call last night trying to get organized.		Moulton	Rice	Perlmutter	Ryan	Schrader	Vela	Foster	Fudge	Sires	Higgins
It’s really hard at this moment to see how Pelosi does not become speaker.		+ Trump positive Tweet / sentiment	+ fundraising	+ deep political ties within House caucus	+ no clear cut, organized opposition (a la Freedom Caucus)
FLASHBACK:		Boehner cut a deal with Dems to not send members to the floor in order to lower Speaker threshold bc of Freedom Caucus defections.
Also notable:		It’s still unclear how many of the Dems who were elected actually do not support Pelosi. There isn’t a firm whip count.		“NEW LEADERSHIP” doesn’t necessarily mean “NO PELOSI” in DC-swamp-speak........ https://t.co/cxhqRa8hAg
This means that there’s actually a scenario where Pelosi would have to:		1.) cut a deal with McCarthy / GOP (and Trump’s Tweet / comments yesterday suggest that’s possible)		2.) have a floor fight 		BUT yes, 2 months in DC is a century in Trump years.		https://t.co/KLfx0nLwiD

TRUMP on investigate v. legislate:		“All you’re gonna do is end up in back and forth and back and forth...”		“They can look at us and we can look at them... it’ll probably be very good for me politically.”		“You can’t do them simultaneously, by the way.”

TRUMP, smiling, calls out the Sun reporter who says Trump praised May in interview:		“They didn’t put it in the headline. I wish they would’ve. When I saw her this morning, I said, ‘I wanted to apologize.’ She said, ‘Don’t worry, it’s only the press.’”
MAY on if Trump’s Sun interview underminded her:		“No. Look, I’m clear our Brexit plan will deliver on what the British ppl voted for.”
“That’s nothing my opponent would’ve done.” https://t.co/xfWg0ney0j

TRUMP:		“I am not going in with high expectations... relationship is very important.”		“I’ve been saying for years... having relationships with other countries is a good thing.”		“I can’t underestimate how big the mtg with NATO was yesterday.”
TRUMP:		“Anything I do with Russia it’s ‘Oh, Russia, he loves Russia.’ I love the United States.”
TRUMP:		“When the meeting was arranged, it was from my stand point, I didn’t go in with high expectations.		“Proliferation, to me, it’s the biggest problem in the world. I understand nuclear. Look up my uncle. MIT.”		“Ideally? Get rid of ‘em. Maybe it’s a dream.”
TRUMP on May:		“She can’t walk away bc that means she stuck... my suggestion was respectfully submitted.		“She will do very well... she’s a tough negotiator. She’s a very smart, tough, very capable person. I’d much rather have her as my friend than my foe.”
MAY:		“I welcome his mtg. with President Putin.		“Important he go into this — as he is doing — from a position of strength and NATO unity.”		“The President is going into that mtg with President Putin from a position of strength and NATO strength around that table.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP:		“He [Putin] took over Crimea during the Obama administration, I think you would admit...		“Let’s see what happens. This was an Obama disaster... I don’t think he would’ve done that if I were president.”		“Crimea was another bad hand.”
“It’s a different time zone here, to put it mildly.”

MAY:		“Let me be clear: We will be leaving the European Union.”
PRESIDENT TRUMP:		“The headline he [Putin] sees is in the afternoon where we came together... $34B more was raised since I’ve become president for NATO... do you think Putin is happy about that? I don’t think so.”
“I don’t know him. I met him one or two times. Two-and-a-half times. Most of you [press] were there.” — President Trump on Putin.

TRUMP to Iranian people:		“The future of Iran belongs to its ppl... Iran’s leaders will say they refuse to negotiate a new deal. That’s fine. I’d probably say same thing. But fact is, they will want to negotiate... I am ready, willing and able. Great things can happen for Iran.”
TRUMP says will work with allies to find another solution.		- eliminate threat of Iran ballistic missile program and support of terrorism.
TRUMP: “The United States no longer makes empty threats...”		- Sec. Pompeo en route to North Korea.
TRUMP: “The Iran deal is defective at its core.”		“Therefore, I am announcing today that the US will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.”		- reinstates nuclear sanctions against Iran		- “America will not be held hostage by nuclear blackmail.” #BREAKING
TRUMP:		“We have engaged extensively with our partners and allies around the world, including France Germany and U.K... We are unified that Iran must never have a nuclear weapon.”
TRUMP slamming deal.		“Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions...
TRUMP says agreement so poorly negotiated, even if Iran complies it can be on verge of a nuclear breakout.		He says deal would lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.
TRUMP calls Iran deal a “great embarrassment to me as a citizen and all citizens.”		“We have definitive proof” Iran broke JCPOA, cites Israel.		“Horrible, one-sided deal.”		“Didn’t bring calm. Didn’t bring peace. And it never will.”
TRUMP:		“Iranian regime funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering wealth of its own ppl.		“In 2015, the previous administration joined w/ other nations in [JCPOA]... in theory, it was supposed to protect the US &amp; its allies from lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb.”
