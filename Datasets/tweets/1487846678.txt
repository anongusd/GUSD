@itskathryndunn @rachelbogle @MissAmericaOrg I specifically remember meeting you and I still think I have the photo. It was great meeting you. I’m sorry your memory is different. Thanks and I hope you have a fantastic day.
@GrassrootsJill @gabrielsherman Yes
@KelseyWettig @KylieShepard96 @MissAmericaOrg Sure!!! I hope it works out!!!
@KelseyWettig @KylieShepard96 @MissAmericaOrg Thanks Kelsey! That’s the goal! To have the org succeed! I’m sure the sashes will work out! When I competed we didn’t even have them! Ha!
@KelseyWettig @KylieShepard96 @MissAmericaOrg Sure u can - states will get both
@KelseyWettig @KylieShepard96 @MissAmericaOrg Hi! You can choose whatever sash you want &amp; whatever evening wear attire you want. Funny thing is it was called a competition 3 years ago but no one cared enough to notice. Instead of wearing a swimsuit you will be able to showcase more about u are. Otherwise things are the same
@MissAmerica1995 @rachelbogle @MissAmericaOrg Heather pls stop defaming me. Thank you
@zylx5374 Umm #evidence
@406almy @weidner_joel @dressforsuccess @LucyKaylin That is absurdly false thanks
@rachelbogle Thank you for your advice. Really appreciate it. Have a great night
@rachelbogle @MissAmericaOrg Yes trying to combat the massive misinformation out there thank you

@AliLanyon @AlexBPeterson @abc27News Yep deleted. Ask him why he’s no longer the PA exec director and why the new group of states forming a group against MAO was fine having him as an officer on their new board
@AUchick2011 @Just_a_Texan Amazing how honoring the substance of women instead of 4 minutes of bikinis ruins everything
@karenlzur And u should check out why the former PA exec director is no longer the exec director because of vial FB post about women
@chris_cmh6473 @Jezebel Uhh never
@zylx5374 Well that’s a first. Last time I checked prude or not it’s still illegal to “hit on” employees in the workplace for promotions and advancement in a company
@donna52_9 @FoxNews Political? If that’s what u call honoring the substance of women
@jakew1967 @sinbadbad And that says it all
@beachydreamer Uhh #facts please

@cobra429jet @SenGillibrand @LindseyGrahamSC Uhhhhhh whatever
@DaveEverlasting Ignorant about what? The president of the US suggesting a sitting senator would have sex with him for campaign contributions “do anything”? Sad
This is so tone deaf. NBC in their own statement said they believed the one Lauer accuser wasn’t only one.As for women being able to “publicly” go to court - pls get educated on arbitration clauses that preclude open court and push accusers into secrecy. https://t.co/omMbqe9Oun
@davidmweissman @JeffreySorrell4 He’s on tape saying what he feels he can do to women
Sexual harassment is apolitical. Women will not be silenced no matter what party they are in. Period. https://t.co/YNPH654iM7
@brianpendergras @ChrisRuddyNMX @newsmax Sad
What do u mean @SenGillibrand would “do anything” for campaign contributions? By the way she isn’t a lightweight. Nor is @LindseyGrahamSC - both who sponsored my bipartisan bill to give women a voice to get rid of secret arbitration clauses. https://t.co/feCRIQwUkv
Message to @ChrisRuddyNMX &amp; @newsmax - so easy to say all women coming forward about Trump &amp; Moore “politically motivated”. We weren’t in the cultural revolution we are in now! That’s why women didn’t come forward! Duh
Politically motivated? Sad sad sad. I can’t pick and choose who u want to believe based on political party https://t.co/yldhNIGn9Q

@KMCRadio @VP Instead of requiring men to act civilly you are advocating women should be shut out of off site events - that will only hurt women for promotions etc if they can’t participate

it’s not just entertainment. it’s not just politics. it’s not just sports. sexual harassment is an epidemic. let’s stamp it out once and for all https://t.co/cjNX4UOPTt
@MegJamesLAT Thank you
men aren’t always just the perpetrators of sexual harassment - they can be its victims, too. it should be clear by now that this isn’t only a women’s issue. it’s a human issue https://t.co/anoIIdWlXo
How crazy is it that some in Alabama say they would still support #RoyMoore even if he is proven to be a sexual molester of a teenage girl. Division and politics in our nation are at a despicable low. #unbelievable
@CClemishire Didn’t have choice for justice in a court. Have u heard about forced arbitration? Thx
@laissez_claire @empathywarrior7 @tlvance63 @AC360 Ya because it’s so easy to come forward based on the reactions we’re all witnessing now thanks
@MrBlue111 @bbkaksy @suziique03 @AC360 Really? Go back to the dark ages please- America is ready to listen to women who’ve been silenced for forever
@CClemishire Huh?
@PetersenT3 Really? Many women are forced into secret chamber called arbitration and no one ever knows thanks
@JeffreySluder Widely reported
@Joduan @tampabaytimes Why does my work to help women bother u? All proceeds go back to my Gift of Courage fund to empower girls. Thanks
Looking forward to meeting folks @tampabaytimes book festival in St. Petersburg FL today - 12pm #BeFierceBook talk with signing after. Address below! https://t.co/0j6lHvpgni

@calistevenj I can say that if a 14 year old was sexually assaulted it’s a crime
@DrMelodyMcCloud @AC360 Omg I️m so sorry
Just for the record Ed Henry of Alabama — just b/c u think someone is “a good man” (Roy Moore) has nothing to do with with whether or not they can be a sexual assaulter or harasser. One of those ugly myths.
Hope Ed Henry of Alabama doesn’t have children - especially girls. This is a crash and burn interview on @AC360 - omg. Scary that people in Alabama say they would still vote for Roy Moore even if allegations are true.
Unbelievable interview on @AC360 with Ed Henry - politician from Alabama —!believes women who finally come forward about sex assault should be the ones prosecuted. Holy s.
This is crazy - and precisely why women have not felt safe coming forward — exactly b/c of men like this — until now. https://t.co/IP0O9wQ6pT
