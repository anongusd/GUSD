@trollhuntress @HeidiHeitkamp @JoeforIndiana @paulajean2018 Bad comparison. A singular vote does not decide an election like a raft does your life on a sinking boat. The raft also in the only option instead of there being multiple.
@trollhuntress @HeidiHeitkamp @JoeforIndiana @paulajean2018 I would have voted for Stein here in Delaware.
