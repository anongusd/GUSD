Final tweet, I swear. So if you wonder what's the point of this, it's simple. Go through my Twitter timeline, and you'll see my past support of Trump. See my most recent tweets, and they're more critical of him. I just wanted to explain "why the shift?" from support to oppose.
...I realized different things about the GOP. Blind faith in a party is dangerous, don't be as sucked in as I was...
...I intend on praising both Democrats and Republicans when they do something that deserves commendation, and condemn it when otherwise. It's important to note, that I acknowledge that my youth is a factor as to why I was drawed into the GOP and Trump, but as I grew older...
...and thoughts, I realize that that isn't who I truly am. The last straw was this ridiculous shutdown, but it's been a series of dominos falling that made me realize that my support of Trump since 2015 has all been a farce. The President's base is abandoning him...

@GailWil32477625 @realDonaldTrump You really don't want that to happen. Trump is unpopular in Massachusetts. His endorsement will make the win of Warren even bigger.
Alex Jones has finally been banned from all major platforms. He should now just fade into obscurity and disappear, same way the Far Right should before they hijack the entire @GOP platform.

@LauraLoomer @DanWantsFreedom @realDonaldTrump So, we're just gonna pretend that McCain wasn't a Senator for over 30 years. That he passed a bipartisan campaign reform act. Instead, judge him by his current actions. He has been an important person in the GOP, and we should respect that.

@nomad2003 @ForAmerica Why deport the DREAM'ers? The only country they've ever known is America. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some "stupid libtard", I mean just scroll through my Twitter page, but the simple fact is is that trying to deport ALL or at least most of the illegal will greatly backfire...
The news today that he's discontinuing his cancer treatment has saddened me. I wish @cindymccain, @MeghanMcCain and the rest of the Senator's family my thoughts and regards through all he's going through.
I've been reading @SenJohnMcCain's book "The Restless Wave". Thanks to his words, I have changed some of my own ideals, such as with immigration. I have yet to finish it, but reading it so far has made me respect the Senator more than I used to.
@ForAmerica And for these few, the many suffer. Many illegal immigrants aren't killers. Most are here for jobs. NO, they're not stealing jobs, most Americans don't even want the jobs. Deporting them completely is just going to backfire on the GOP, we need a bipartisan immigration reform.

@DavidSeawright We need more Orrin Hatch's. He's a warm and funny man. I definitely respect him.

If @Troy_Balderson keeps his edge and makes some gains in Delaware County, he wins. If @dannyoconnor1 can win votes from Delaware and whatevers left in that 1% from Franklin, he'll win. This is gonna be a squeaker.
Scratch that, Danny O'Connor is now up by 201 votes. Most of it came from Franklin County, but that's now 99% of Franklin in. Delaware County still at 66%. R's can still win if all goes right in Delaware County.
#Ohio12 is too close for comfort, currently @Troy_Balderson leads by 1,031 votes. Franklin County is 93% in. Delaware County is 66% in. R's can make edge it out if Delaware County keeps going for Balderson.

@DemocratsLogic It's really BS when people try and bring up the fact that Australia has a gun ban. You just can't compare two different places and think that what one country has will work in another. Maybe it worked in Australia, but it won't in America.

And whenever the president tries to get things done without Congress (through Executive Orders), judges can just stop that Executive Order. So again, this is mostly due to the Democrats. We need more Republican members in the Senate and in the House!
To all who say "But the Republicans control the presidency and Congress", let me add some insight to that. Republicans hold a 51-49 majority. 60 votes are required to end filibusters and for clotures. The president can't do anything if Congress can't pass bills.
