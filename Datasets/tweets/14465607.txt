@moonchick @JammieWF That's sadly true. But none of them so far have claimed to be "young Dads" when they're over a half-century or more old.
@glensharp33 And truth is an inattentive American public lets them get away with it if they like the pol anyway. There are no consequences for too many public wrongs. So as competitors they do what they can get away with.
@glensharp33 Yes, but they're rare. Most want to win so badly
