@EricAbercrumbie schools, politicians, our HR practices, perhaps faith based initiatives all can play a big role in solving these issues.
@EricAbercrumbie Demand legislative action and work on initiatives across the country, education, &amp; research meaningful ways to bring change
@EricAbercrumbie And regardless of our politics, philosophies, and different backgrounds, we must continue to overcome united as a nation!
@EricAbercrumbie Cultural sensitivity, poltical correctness, just being a good human being, morals &amp; serving society conflicting as well!
@EricAbercrumbie of race, and people will lose trust in our legal system, police force (which overall should always do an honorable job) (c)
