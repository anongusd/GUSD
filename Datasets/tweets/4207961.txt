But the degree to which his criminality is just priced in, taken for granted is astounding. It's perversely a political benefit he gains from the low estimation people generally have of his character.

This seems like important context for all of the Russia stuff. Trump *knew* what was happening: he's pursuing a big deal with Russia, he's praising them and they're helping him. And Putin knew it too. You don't need more communication than *what we already have* for both parties
McCabe of course knew this to be totally untrue but understood it for what it was: Trump telling McCabe the lie he wanted him to repeat. And now Cohen is saying the exact same thing about the conversations he had with Trump about Moscow tower and congressional testimony.
That's what Comey said about his first conversation with Trump, which he likened to the way a mob boss talked. McCabe said when he first met Trump after Comey was fired, Trump went a long riff about how hated Comey was in the FBI and how everyone was so glad he fired him...
Three people have talked about the way Trump would essentially talk in code, by *telling* people what the story was and what he expected them to say, without explicitly directing it.
Amash is one of the most interesting members of congress.
Cohen talking about "speaking in code" again makes more sense of the seeming conflict between the Buzzfeed and the SCO statement knocking it down.

@Yair_Rosenberg @SethAMandel yes I do. May have worded poorly before. But basically, in the Bibi era, AIPAC and others have a tougher case to American liberals, and it's *really* taken a toll on public opinion in the center-left/democratic party coalition.
@SethAMandel @Yair_Rosenberg I don't think it is. I think they're....losing the debate among a portion of the population that they need in order to maintain the power and efficacy they traditionally have had.
@Yair_Rosenberg @SethAMandel yeah that's basically my point. I don't think this is choice AIPAC is making but they're necessarily along for the ride.
@SethAMandel Right, but AIPAC's position is that US support for Israel should be *completely untethered* from what policies it's government is doing.
@SethAMandel I guess what I'm saying is, whatever the internal politicla reasons for the dominance of the Israeli right in domestic politics there, it's not *crazy* that a 10 year period of right-wing governance will....alienate American liberals.
@SethAMandel I think the position is, basically, support the Israeli government in whatever the current government happens to be doing/pursuing, as a manifestation of the state-to-state relationship
@SethAMandel *position	autocorrect
@SethAMandel I mean I think the polling data shows pretty clearly young Democrats, and the liberal base are increasingly moving away from the AIPAC decision and I think the Netanyahu government and the way its chosen to cultivate/deal with American politics has had some real effect in that.
@SethAMandel I mean you could run around the UK in 2003 and 2004 hectoring people about how the UK *must* stand with its cloest ally in invading Iraq, which is what Blair did, but obviously the actions of that *specific* us government had a very big effect on the public opinion!
@SethAMandel I hear all of that, but the point is that while I gut the dinstinction between a state to state relationship and the relationship with a specific government the latter *obviously* effects public opinion about the former.

@Jamie_Weinstein I'm concerned about a lot of things, Jamie.
@Jamie_Weinstein Or! Maybe I'm wrong and everything is fine, in which case, from your perspective, no reason to be upset or worried.
@Jamie_Weinstein Again, you can feel about it as you will. The reality is what it is.
@Jamie_Weinstein Israel can do whatever it wants, but its actions will naturally have effects on US public opinion. I think the position that US voters should feel exactly the same way about Israel no matter who its leaders are or what it does is a hard sell.
@Jamie_Weinstein in general I think "We need to support this state's government no matter what they do" is often a hard sell, rightly so. It's why Tony Blair is utterly hated across the UK, as he probably should be.
@Jamie_Weinstein Again, you're responding as if I'm making normative claims as opposed to descriptive ones about how liberals perceive the Israeli government.
@Jamie_Weinstein I don't want it to do anything. I'm observing the state of play, politically. It is in trouble, is what I'm saying.
@Jamie_Weinstein The UK is one of our strongest allies but it would be very weird indeed if British leftists and liberals didn't have their opinion of the US-UK relationship affected by the fact that... Trump is president.
@Jamie_Weinstein I mean, Netanyahu runs a hard-right government, is extremely close to Trump, showers praise upon him constantly, defends the Saudi relationship even after they hacked a US resident journalist to pieces...

@realaxelfoley Yeah good point but what I'd say about the NRA is that it has transformed from a very non-partisan org, which gave it a lot of power, to an entirely partisan one which has weakened it. It's still incredibly strong, but i don't think AIPAC wants to find itself in that position.
AIPAC runs the risk of going the way of the NRA if things continue this way. Will be very interesting to see how this plays out in the presidential primary.
In this age, with Trump as president, it is very very hard to point at the Netanyahu government and say to liberals "We need to support *that* government with everything we have."
I really don't think the Democratic establishment and AIPAC and others have quite grasped just how much they are losing and have lost wide swaths of the Democratic party base.

One way of looking at "political correctness" is that it's a dynamic set of ever-evolving norms we attempt to use to have productive public debate in a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, open, tolerant and pluralistic democracy.
You begin to suspect that maybe these standards are totally malleable and that people running the political correctness con want to reserve genuine outrage for what they find offensive, while being able to make light of or mock other people when they point out offense.
I remain, as ever, just *slightly* confused as to what counts as a politically correct SJW/Twitter mob shutting down debate and what's just righteous umbrage at offensive speech.
@JHWeissmann @MattBruenig this *the* central fault-line, point of tension in Democratic party politics right now, I think. Even if folks are only vaguely aware that it is.
@EWErickson This is really beautiful.
@JHWeissmann @MattBruenig right, exactly.
If I were the Dems I my argument would be something like "Why are we going to pay $1000 a night (!), more money per head per night than the Ritz Carlton, to keep kids and moms locked up in tents when they represent no threat." https://t.co/JezagU5OEJ

@jbarro right, although they deal with that in a fairly straightforward way, and float a few workable definitions
By the third part you get "Economic theory generally assumes..." and you're in extremely contested territory that's just outside what this kind of piece should be doing.
The first part is about whether a majority of the country doesn't make a living wage is itself pretty complicated, but the complexity is acknowledged and you end up with a decent sense of the data.
This is a perfect example of how the fact checking genre goes off the rails as it moves from fairly straightforward descriptive claims (% of households earning a living wage) to more normative ones ("it's wrong" that Walmart gets a "wealth transfer") 		https://t.co/m1596JbI0A

That's why we're here.
But border security funding and staffing has been going up *for years*, all that as apprehensions have come down! That's not the issue. That's not why the gov is shut down. The $ the WH wants is a stand in for THE WALL, the very stupid idea the president sold to everyone.
Many if not most of Republicans in congress *know this* but they can't say it because they need to pretend the President didn't propose something stupid. So they've all been trying to switch the topic to "border security" in a broad sense.
Trump has shut down the government because he promised Mexico would pay for a wall that of course they won't pay for. Also the idea, as he sold it, is very stupid and unworkable and no one wants it.
It's not semantics, it's literally the core promise of the Trump campaign and what he keeps saying he wants to build. It's what he asked Pelosi about yesterday ****using that word****. That's why we're talking about a "wall." Not because of Democrats! https://t.co/NtuhbJbBVm
I heard @mercedesschlapp try to do the same thing on NPR this morning as if we haven't watched the president promise a wall that Mexico would pay for literally hundreds if not thousands of times.
This is another example of what I was discussing yesterday. What transparent and preposterous bad faith to say WHY DO THE DEMOCRATS KEEP TALKING ABOUT A WALL? 		Yeah, I mean, where'd they get that idea? https://t.co/iSxlu2RMVb

@guypbenson overstaying tourist visas, or working while on tourist visas (which certain first ladies may or may not have done) is, imho, a more straightforward "abuse" of the system, although, again, not anywhere remotely near the top of challenges America faces.

@guypbenson The population of unauthorized immigrants has, in fact *not* been increasing, thanks to a lot of outflow back to Mexico, and the majority of unauthorized immigrants come through legitimate visas they overstay, not over the border.
@guypbenson The vast majority of the population at issue, the women and children and families from the Northern Triangle *are* seeking asylum. That's who's referred to in the clip in question.

Oddly enough, literally the most detailed part of the Trump 2016 campaign website was its description of the (utterly bonkers) proposal to garnish money from wire transfers to Mexico to pay for the wall under some deeply dubious Patriot Act authority.
@jbarro Not a lot of detail! HR 695 ‚ÄúSEC. 141. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there is appropriated for ‚ÄòU.S. Customs and Border Protection‚ÄîProcurement, Construction, and Improvements‚Äô $5,710,357,000 for fiscal year 2019, to remain available until September 30, 2023.
In other words: What, specifically, is the proposal here: what is being and done and where and for what reason? No answers from anyone in any detail as far as I can tell.
Ok, so it's very precise on the number of dollars, but basically a totally unrestricted fund for "Procurement, Construction and Improvements."
"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, there is appropriated for ‚ÄòU.S. Customs and Border Protection‚ÄîProcurement, Construction, and Improvements‚Äô $5,710,357,000 for fiscal year 2019, to remain available until September 30, 2023."

@ByYourLogic @MitchellCares We've definitely played a huge role in destabilizing central america. But, the people I've talked to who are actually coming, really do have an incredible faith in the country. Just one part of the awfulness of the situation is how misplaced that may end up proving to be.
The idea that Soleimani has been to Yemen is part of a broader Saudi narrative about how the Houthi rebels are essentially nothing more than an Iranian proxy, which is really not true. 		Striking that that part of the narrative has embedded itself in Kerry's view of the region.
Kerry, who's fairly critical of Saudi involvement in Yemen, also claims that Qassem Soleimani, Iran's chief military strategist, has actually been to Yemen. I pushed back because I had thought that was a myth. He repeated the claim, but as far as I can tell, it's *not* true.
BTW, a revealing moment, I think, in this conversation with Kerry that shows just how dominant the Saudi line has been w US policy makers on Yemen/Iran.
@ByYourLogic I don't think it's about how great we are so much as how much people coming here believe in the country as a place they want to be in. I've been struck how consistent that's been in the conversations I've had with migrants seeking asylum and their lawyers and advocates.

But it‚Äôs also an excruciating discussion because it‚Äôs necessarily zero sum, and all the outstanding issues are so pressing.
The decisions about prioritizarion are going to have massive consequences, and, to me, it‚Äôs one of the most central discussions within the Democratic Party over the next two years. It‚Äôs part of why the Green New Deal activism is so smart and politically important.
Those two issues both didn‚Äôt get priority in Obama‚Äôs first two years, and the urgency has only grown. I think the stakes of climate are enormous and world-civilizational but the pressing, right-now, human stakes of immigration are too.
*But*. Whatever goes first is going to require an enormous expenditure of political capital and legislative time. And that means there‚Äôll be less of both for two other massively important issues for Democrats: immigration and climate.
Poll after poll, organizer after organizer, will tell you it‚Äôs at or near the top of what voters care most about.
I strongly suspect that healthcare will be near the top for most D candidates for a variety of reasons. Perhaps most importantly because the politics of it are so potent.
When I asked Castro what his first big domestic policy initiative would be, he said Medicare For All.
To me one of the most important questions this primary season will sort out is the *priorities* of an incoming Democratic admin, should the D win.

I'm thinking about how powerless and terrified I felt, even though I knew it was nothing serious. I knew she was in good hands.
I'm thinking about the glassy listlessness in her eyes and the paleness of her skin and her brave, composed face as the nurse put in an IV to get her re-hydrated.
This morning I'm thinking about a few months ago when my then 6-year-old daughter had a bought of food poisoning and we had to go to the ER.

And it's not what happened here! Voter ID has *literally* nothing to do with this brazen GOP theft. And finally, it's not at all clear to me there needs to be a structural solution to what happened in NC-9. An unscrupulous R tried to steal the election and got caught. Good.
Second, the overwhelming focus of a GOP apparatus intent on disenfranchising voters of color and young voters has been voter ID, which is a solution in search of a problem. In-person voter fraud is far far less common than lightning striking. It basically doesn't happen.
First, let us take a moment to appreciate the titanic chutzpah of Grover and the NC GOP who, when faced with a Republican campaign caught criminally stealing an election are able to say, straight-faced "SEE, TOLD YOU FRAUD WAS A PROBLEM!"
I've seen a bunch of Republicans attempt to spin it this way so it's worth responding to head on. https://t.co/yINQKNzxUm
The most straight-forward, time-honored way for a venal, greedy individual to profit off of public office is simply to accept bribes.		https://t.co/7F5TXwLZcQ
This gives me a rage stroke. Particularly set against the backdrop of what's going on in NC 9. https://t.co/f166DbDBp0
