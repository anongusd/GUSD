@realDonaldTrump But you're a #tariffman. Remember how great tariffs are for everyone? Remember?
@realDonaldTrump You're going to prison for the rest of your natural life, Mr President. I will not support your execution for treason, but you will never leave prison alive.
@joncoopertweets I know it's probably both true and accurate, but it's hearsay.
@DanCrenshawTX You're backing a dead horse.
@joncoopertweets @TheDemCoalition Disbar @RepMattGaetz. Impeach him. He's not fit to serve in Congress. The @HouseGOP needs to begin policing their own.
@darreldrowland It's unbelievable that there is no adult supervision at the @GOP. The @GOPChairwoman is a royal courtier. She's a praetorian guard. She's a feckless toady.
There is no situation which @realDonaldTrump will not make worse.
@RepMarkMeadows Keep up the good work as praetorian guard for your emperor.
@marcorubio @POTUS He gave away so much. He fed the pot all the way up to the river card. He's hopelessly outmatched every. Single. Time. He attempts to negotiate anything with anyone.
@MarshaBlackburn @senjudiciary @POTUS You're a royal courtier. Pretend you're a Senator.
@senatemajldr He fed the pot all the way up to the river card. He's hopelessly outmatched. Every. Single. Time. He attempts to negotiate anything with anyone.
@Jim_Jordan The two of you should hit the gym together. You have a lot in common.
@Jim_Jordan Stupid Constitution. Thank God for Strong Men like you &amp; @realDonaldTrump who don't worry about your stupid oaths to uphold stupid documents. Thank you for having the courage to endanger your immortal soul for the sake of a wall to keep out brown people. Who cares about oaths?
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Is there no one in your life capable of explaining how inappropriate and despicable your behavior is? Learn to comport yourself like a decent human being.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Tell me, which of his crimes were not committed to further the interests of @realDonaldTrump?
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems The problem is the feckless toadyism you've perfected. You're nothing but a royal courtier.
@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco Because of the separation of powers found in the Constitution.
@realDonaldTrump I hate nothing so much as being forced to agree with you about this.
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump It's his own personal Vietnam.
@JimRenacci @realDonaldTrump I see you're brushing up on your royal courtier skills.
@Jim_Jordan Go treason somewhere else, you feckless royal courtier.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump And you'll never find meaningful employment again. You have no credibility.
We need Congressmen like @justinamash. We don't need royal courtiers. https://t.co/6AnbQazCFu
@davidfrum .@realDonaldTrump only throws tantrums.
@senrobportman But @realDonaldTrump doesn't care how funds are appropriated. He just takes what he wants. And while you are "troubled," you take no action to stop him. You are becoming a royal courtier. We need a Senator.
@GOP "Socialists are coming to kill you." Brought to you by the same @GOP that brought you "brown people are coming across the border to kill you."
@RandyLudlow @senrobportman @realDonaldTrump This is unacceptable. @senrobportman was elected to be our senator. We did not send him to Washington to be a royal courtier.
@dangermarin Unpossible.
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems When exactly was it that you decided to be a royal courtier?
@darreldrowland .@realDonaldTrump is the single greatest existential threat to America since the Civil War.
@GOP No. It will be about ending the mendacity, lawlessness, and thuggery of @realDonaldTrump. Save the party. Dump the Donald.
@RepMarkMeadows Go treason somewhere else, you feckless royal courtier.
@realDonaldTrump That's exactly what I would say if I were guilty of multiple felonies.

@senrobportman We need to quit acting in the best interests of Russia. #sanctions
@SecNielsen Bye Felicia.
@nytimes How very progressive and magnanimous of @VP to allow his wife to work outside the home. I'm sure he vetted it thoroughly.
@seanspicer @PressSec @POTUS How's that job hunt going, @PressSec?
@kilmeade @SenatorLankford @realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump can just find a Confederate monument and hold a rally. #TrumpShutdown
@jeremyherb Very disappointed in @senrobportman. This was a chance to protect America.
@KatrinaPierson I'm sure that's exactly what happened.
@Lucy2300090 @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @POTUS The border is not open. An open border would be a change in policy. Who is advocating for that change in policy?
@DebbieLesko @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump Go down South. Find a Confederate monument. Hold a rally.
@mkraju "Unbecoming," he says. While marching in lock-step to @realDonaldTrump's cadence.

@secupp It's a little late to be clutching your pearls, @LindseyGrahamSC .
@senrobportman How could you vote against #SJRes2? This is not a rhetorical question.
@CroweDaun @CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow We're trying to take the high road.
@RepAdamSchiff Who among them would @realDonaldTrump ask? Who among them would agree to be in @realDonaldTrump's cabinet? These are not rhetorical questions.
@TheRickWilson Happens.
@Russvoght10 @andersonDrLJA False dichotomy. Reasonable people can disagree about the need for a wall, but we absolutely need a functioning government. End the #TrumpShutdown.
@mkraju So disappointed in @senrobportman. I won't forget this betrayal of America.

@RepAndyBiggsAZ K bro. Stay frosty.
@BIArchitectess @SecNielsen @POTUS The data do not agree with your assertion that the humanitarian crisis is due to illegal crossings. The humanitarian crisis is comprised of asylum seekers who seek out border agents and turn themselves in.

@SenSchumer I hope @robportman comes to his senses and defies @senatemajldr and @realDonaldTrump. This America's sovereignty is at stake.
@VP @WilkowMajority @POTUS How does a wall address a humanitarian crisis? More importantly, your point is moot. Reasonable people can disagree about the need for a wall, but we absolutely need a functioning government. End the #TrumpShutdown.

@ZekeJMiller @PressSec How's your job hunt going, @PressSec?
@ColumbusGov It's a beautiful day in the capital city!
@PeterAlexander .@realDonaldTrump learned everything he doesn't know about immigration policy and border security from @SteveKingIA.

@oflairkjs @CNNPolitics @SteveKingIA Young. Immature. Lacking wisdom. Lots of student loan debt. Desperate for a job on Capital Hill.

@AlexNBCNews @SteveKingIA @GOPLeader Those poor aides. Imagine trying to find a job with @SteveKingIA as your current employer.

@wingss07 @RepDanCrenshaw @realDonaldTrump "the following things in addition to 234 miles of physical barrier."

@NrthrnrebelMark @RepDanCrenshaw @guypbenson There's no way to negotiate with @POTUS. His own people don't know what he'll accept.

@Bor2d10 @SenTedCruz @SenateGOP @SenSchumer There was a deal to fund the government. The @SenateGOP voted for it unanimously. Then @realDonaldTrump flip-flopped. And he said he'd be proud to shut down the government. That's actually what really happened.
@SenTedCruz @SenateGOP @SenSchumer The point is moot. Reasonable people can disagree about the need for a wall, but we absolutely need a functioning government. End the #TrumpShutdown.
@HouseGOP @RepRalphNorman The point is moot. Reasonable people can disagree about the need for a wall, but we absolutely need a functioning government. End the #TrumpShutdown.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump When will the @GOP come to its senses and disavow this @POTUS? He's destroying our party. Reasonable people can disagree about a wall, but we absolutely need a functioning government and a @POTUS about whose loyalty we don't have to wonder. End the #TrumpShutdown.
@AshaRangappa_ Well, he never got a W-2. Not even a 1099. That proves his point, right?
@realDonaldTrump You seem very believable. Just like when you said you had no idea @MichaelCohen212 was paying off your mistresses.
