I haven‚Äôt finished the McCabe book yet, in fairness, and this assessment is colored by fatigue, but Comey‚Äôs book had better storytelling, and it helped that my understanding of Comey as an individual was more developed than my understanding of McCabe.
Ordinarily I would probably not elect to read a book about the FBI! I would *definitely* not move that book up my queue or pause a different book altogether to read that book.
McCabe‚Äôs book is the second time in the last year that I‚Äôve been tricked into reading a book that‚Äôs primarily about the FBI and only a little bit about Trump.

Trump dismisses @Acosta‚Äòs question as ‚Äúa fake question‚Äù and claims CNN has ‚Äúan agenda.‚Äù 		He then calls on... A CNN contributor, @BrianKarem.
Trump follows this riff by calling on @Acosta.
Trump says Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, and Laura Ingraham have been, ‚Äúgreat‚Äù to him.
He‚Äôs now talking about Ann Coulter. ‚ÄúI would speak to her... In fact I like her.‚Äù Claims he hasn‚Äôt spoken to her in over a year, implies the press has overstated her influence on this policy. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs off the reservation,‚Äù he says.

@MollyJongFast Blue tape is usually for painting and similar construction, no? Whereas duct tape is gray? But on the first part your read my mind.
Trump stopped an NBC reporter from asking his question. ‚ÄúABC ‚Äî not NBC.‚Äù He said he prefers ABC slightly over NBC. @PeterAlexander responded by handing the mic to @jonkarl, telling him he would wait his turn. When Karl returned the mic, Trump said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs hear it NBC.‚Äù
Trump: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big deficit believer and all of that...‚Äù but adds he believes spending immediately on what he wants is a more important concern.

Trump has asked two ‚ÄúAngel Moms‚Äù present in the front row to stand and display photos of their family members who were killed to the reporters and cameras assembled behind them. He claimed, falsely, that the media does not cover this issue.
TRUMP: ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm gonna be signing a national emergency. Aaaand it‚Äôs been signed many times before... It‚Äôs never been a problem... they sign it!... Nobody cares.‚Äù
Trump is now talking again about women bound with tape around their mouths being trafficked over the border. This riff has become as common in his immigration remarks as ‚Äúbuild the wall‚Äù has been at his rallies.

Since we are all on the topic, the best Roger Stone profile ever written was in 2007 by Matt Labash. It inspired some high profile copycats, which you should ignore. https://t.co/z1PDexVE9A
One of my favorite genres of press release is, ‚ÄúExpert Available,‚Äù and this one from a few minutes ago made me laugh: https://t.co/OBv9bX7LYR
There was always this sense with Stone, even when he was criticizing Trump, that he just wanted his approval.
An irony of his arrest might be that it serves to legitimize him‚Äîat least for a little while‚Äîin the eyes of the president, bringing him closer to the center of his orbit (in terms of how Trump feels about him) than he‚Äôs been since his formal exit from the campaign in August 2015.
Trump and Stone have had an on and off relationship for over 40 years, and it sometimes seemed to hurt Stone when Trump talked about him like he was unimportant. In 2008, Trump publicly called Stone a ‚Äúloser‚Äù and complained about him improperly taking credit for things.

Anyway nothing matters but my grievances distract me from the reality that we are careening through a vast and mysterious universe in which the only certainties are the unfair distribution of fortune and death which could strike at any time!
But even if, in this universe, Warren is a major candidate and Castro is not, that doesn‚Äôt explain why when she formed an exploratory committee, she was formally running, and when he formed one (and scheduled a date for his announcement‚ÄîJanuary 12), he wasn‚Äôt.
You can argue that she‚Äôs better known than Castro, or seems more likely to win, but however you‚Äôre defining the term, I think a cabinet secretary from the previous administration with a national media profile qualifies as ‚Äúmajor.‚Äù
If we are accepting that a candidate is a person who has formed an exploratory committee, then Warren is not, by definition, the first major candidate wading into the 2020 primary field. https://t.co/kwzZG8vnwf

Also says a lot that Trump didn‚Äôt understand the premise, or wasn‚Äôt briefed on the new order beforehand, or was briefed and forgot or didn‚Äôt care enough to listen in the first place.
That meant keeping tabs on who attended meetings and narrowing the guest list for such events. The idea was not just about making things more orderly, but also about preventing leaks, or making the source of leaks easier to identify. This wasn‚Äôt a soaring success in the end, ofc.
Kelly‚Äôs frustration may have had little to do with Mulvaney himself. Kelly tried to implement some structure in the WH, which was‚Äîas we know‚Äîlacking even more before than it is now. Running meetings in a more professional way was a big part of that.
Kelly said he would just leave, since Mulvaney wanted to be the chief of staff. Trump asked Kelly what the problem was; it made sense for Mulvaney to be in that meeting, whether or not he was on the list. Trump said, ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs Mick. What are you talking about?‚Äù
Shortly after John Kelly became the chief of staff, he walked into a meeting to see Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney wasn‚Äôt on the list to attend the meeting, and Kelly ‚Äúflipped out,‚Äù according to the official. Kelly asked Mulvaney, ‚ÄúYou wanna be the fucking chief of staff?‚Äù

All of this is to say that nothing is certain to happen in Donald Trump‚Äôs White House until it happens and even after it happens, something might fuck it up anyway.
This has happened before, of course: the president talks about something or someone so much and to such a vast universe of advisers formal and informal, internal and external, and that‚Äôs reflected in the press, which irritates him.
That said, I have lately started to hear that the president dislikes that Ayers is considered Kelly‚Äôs likely replacement/that Ayers has gotten a little over his skis.
This has been the case for Nick Ayers, an operator who seems more capable of the kind of maneuvering that Kelly has no apparent patience for. As the person I spoke to yesterday put it: ‚ÄúSometimes you need a hammer and sometimes you need a screwdriver. John Kelly‚Äôs a hammer.‚Äù
Looking ahead to 2020 with Mueller hanging over him, few accomplishments to campaign on, and a Democratic House prepared to check his power and stall his agenda, it‚Äôs easy to see why he‚Äôd want to make a change now, or why he‚Äôd pick now to justify a decision he‚Äôd already made.
A central criticism of Kelly was always that he didn‚Äôt have the political skills - or interest in acquiring the skills - to help Trump navigate the tricky terrain on the hill. Someone once described him to me as having the political acumen of their grandmother.
And then there‚Äôs the reality of the difficulty of his campaign for reeelection setting in. 2 WH staffers, Bill Stepien &amp; Justin Clark, departed their posts this week to join the campaign. The person I spoke to yesterday said Trump‚Äòs started thinking about 2020 for the first time.
The first is obvious by now: Even though his catchphrase is ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired,‚Äù Trump does not like to fire people. He thrives on the drama of uncertainty. And he is highly susceptible to distraction, meaning dissatisfaction with staff may erupt only to fall away for weeks at a time.
There have been stories about Kelly‚Äôs imminent demise since virtually the moment he joined the WH staff. 		So the question is, why now? I think there are two main reasons:
One person who advises the president and recently spoke to him about the chief of staff told me yesterday that the claim Kelly would stay through 2020 was mostly a favor to Kelly:		‚ÄúThat announcement allowed him to kind of save face and leave on his own terms,‚Äù this person said.
Previously, the White House claimed Kelly would stay on through 2020. In an interview with me in October, the president said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy with General Kelly and I get along very well with him.‚Äù He claimed he wasn‚Äôt looking for a replacement for Kelly. https://t.co/B1TZ1TBL9R

He may in fact be in the residence, sitting on a couch, but the image that springs to mind when you receive a call like that is something out of  Independence Day.
But as I understand it, Trump sometimes makes outside calls through the situation room switchboard when he‚Äôs elsewhere. When the call comes, the operator says the president is on the line from the situation room, leading to a dramatic but incorrect image for whoever he‚Äôs calling.
The White House switchboard has been a source confusion for some of Trump‚Äôs friends and associates. Earlier this year, there was a report that Trump was avoiding John Kelly‚Äôs supervision by cocooning himself in the situation room and making calls from there.
Trump relies on his personal phone when conducting calls he doesn‚Äôt want coming through WH switchboard. Additionally: ‚Äú...since becoming president [he‚Äôs] agreed to a slightly cumbersome arrangement of having two official phones: one for Twitter and other apps, and one for calls.‚Äù
Trump reportedly has two official iPhones with limited capabilities and one personal iPhone. ‚ÄúMr. Trump keeps the personal phone, White House officials said, because unlike his other two phones, he can store his contacts in it.‚Äù

@pbump @Bencjacobs Phil, congrats on your new job with the Montana GOP!
Anyway, don‚Äôt @ me. Instead, please direct all questions and comments to my attorney @Bencjacobs.
If she believes his motives were sexist, I would be interested to hear her thoughts and assessment. But I believe it‚Äôs her call, whether or not this ought to be framed that way. For now, I see this most objectively as an incident involving Trump‚Äòs disregard of the free press.
I can only speak for myself, of course, but such framing - that the problem is the president spoke that way ‚Äúto a female reporter‚Äù - strikes me as sexist. He spoke that way to a member of the press. Her gender is irrelevant to the substance of her questions about the FBI + trade.
RT @CeciliaVega: A news conference means you get to ask whatever question you want to ask. #FirstAmendment
It‚Äôs a mistake to frame Donald Trump‚Äôs disrespectful comment to @CeciliaVega as a sexist incident. It‚Äôs broader than that: the president does not understand the value of the free press. Male or female, he sees reporters doing their jobs as pests, at best, or worse, as the enemy.

When the author refers matter of factly to this ‚Äúwe,‚Äù it is not clear to me if the author means to speak about some kind of organized faction of the administration or just a general ~*vibe*~ among certain officials and staffers.
And is the author providing us with a conclusion based on his or her impression of how his or her colleagues feel, or is the author suggesting an organized conspiracy against the president‚Äôs dumbest impulses from the ‚Äústeady state‚Äù? Seems like the former, but not totally clear.

How does the New York Times define ‚Äúsenior‚Äù? Does ‚Äúadministration‚Äù mean the author is not an official in the White House, or is that broader descriptor meant to protect the author? Why run this as a column rather than as part of a piece of reporting? I LOVE THIS DRAMA!

It‚Äôs about the White House grasping for any excuse not to answer questions honestly, which often requires they answer no questions at all.
Are some reporters annoying? Are some reporters assholes? Am I an annoying asshole? Probably! There are annoying and rude people everywhere on this silly and horrifically cruel planet. But the irritated substitute teacher posture from WH staff isn‚Äôt about reporters‚Äô behavior.
The basic premise of their jobs as officials who are paid by your taxes seems to either be lost on or totally unimportant to them.
This comes across during serious moments but also in more subtle ways or through jokes. Think back to November, when Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked reporters attempting to question her at the briefing what they were thankful for.

Asked to clarify if the administration‚Äôs policy at the border is catch and release or zero tolerance, Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflects by saying the EO has bought congress some time but they need to figure out a solution. 		What is the policy? We still don‚Äôt know.
@RyanLizza Babe just say ‚Äúfucking.‚Äù Who says ‚Äúfriggin‚Äù?
Asked why the president is moving so quickly on his SCOTUS decision, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says his list is almost two years old, then reiterates that he‚Äôs being ‚Äúthoughtful‚Äù about the process.
When asked if Donald Trump wants to see Roe v Wade overturned, Sarah Huckabee Sanders refuses to answer, using the SCOTUS decision as a way to wiggle out of the issue. Pressed to answer because it‚Äôs about policy, not SCOTUS, she doubles down on her refusal.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders says we‚Äôve been ‚Äúvery nice to Canada‚Äù and Canada has taken advantage of us.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders says ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt‚Äù when asked why Donald Trump lied about lobbying for the immigration bill that he definitely, 100% lobbied for. Sarah‚Äôs claim is disproved by the president‚Äôs own tweets.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders says ‚Äúthe president is being very thoughtful‚Äù about choosing a SCOTUS nominee. She says she won‚Äôt ‚Äúget into‚Äù any more specifics about the process.

It‚Äôs easier to point out what‚Äôs wrong with coverage than to offer non-dumb ideas for how to improve it, obviously. And I think often we‚Äôre all moving too fast here to stop to think about anything more than making sure our facts are right. But üåàüåàwe can always tryüåàüåà
This isn‚Äôt an original point but it‚Äôs useful here: national political coverage often isn‚Äôt biased in favor of the left or the right but in favor of conflict. We ought to ask ourselves if we are amplifying conflict, as we cover it, in a way that supports one side over the other.
You can only put so much context in a chyron, but no matter how nuanced the ensuing discussion is, it‚Äôs worth scrutinizing how we approach analysis or debate about events like this in the first place. Is the lede SHS‚Äôs tweet? Or is it the 3+ years of antagonistic Trump rhetoric?
Seeing a lot of coverage of the Red Hen incident and political incivility that appears to be set up in a way that, intentionally or not, is sympathetically skewed towards the narrative put forth by the White House and President Trump‚Äôs defenders.

I would have waited until I was called on to play it, but I was not being called on. After another reporter‚Äôs phone began loudly ringing with a melodic jingle, I figured the briefing room could probably deal with a more important disturbance.
I played the audio of children separated from their parents at a US Customs and Border Protection facility that was published by @ProPublica today at the White House briefing. Officials failed to adequately and truthfully answer questions about the policy. https://t.co/M7jyZQUwwK

RT @RosieGray: .@Olivianuzzi is playing it right next to me in the briefing room right now. https://t.co/1RiATBWYaP
From the White House podium, Nielsen‚Äôs attitude towards the press is sharp and irritated. She appears to have more of an issue with being asked about children who appear to be suffering abuse at the hands of our government than with the fact that it‚Äôs happening.
Asked to respond to critics who say children are being used as leverage, Nielsen says such characterizations are ‚Äúcowardly.‚Äù
Words matter. Phrasing is a choice. Nielsen didn‚Äôt invent this terminology, but she surely knows why she‚Äôs using it from the White House podium today.
Note Nielsen‚Äôs repeated use of the dehumanizing term ‚Äúalien children.‚Äù This, in the same monologue in which she says ‚Äúwe are a country of compassion.‚Äù

But I would be cautious not to give too much credit to anyone - especially a former WH staffer - who appears to glean in this shameful failure an opportunity to gain or regain power or influence.
I‚Äôve seen some commentary praising Scaramucci and grouping him along with critics like Laura Bush. Maybe motive doesn‚Äôt matter if it leads you to being on the correct, humane side of an issue.
Scaramucci appears to be shrewdly angling to get back into Trump‚Äôs orbit by blaming the family separation policy and Trump‚Äôs lies about it on his advisers. As we know, Trump often listens to and respects those on the outside more than whoever is surrounding him internally.
The briefing room erupted into laughter and groaning after Sarah Huckabee Sanders‚Äôs briefing, originally scheduled for 1:15 and then pushed to 3:30, was pushed again to 4pm when the press had already assembled.

‚ÄúThey can keep them,‚Äù Nunberg said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use them. I don‚Äôt give a shit, they can keep them as a memento.‚Äù
Nunberg said that when he was picked up at Union Station ahead of his grand jury testimony, he handed over his iPhone, laptop, and iPad and all of his passwords voluntarily and those devices were returned to him when he was finished. Mueller still has his Blackberrys.
‚ÄúWhat the fuck do they need my fucking Blackberrys for?‚Äù Nunberg said. He assumes it‚Äôs to look for communications on encrypted apps, but he said he didn‚Äôt download WhatsApp until after he transitioned to the iPhone. He said he thinks he downloaded it in December 2017.
Nunberg told me he handed over two or three old Blackberry devices to Mueller. He said that during his interviews, he was never asked for an inventory of every phone he‚Äôs ever had, but the request for the phones seemed like the special counsel thought he was hiding them.
Per the court filing, some of Manafort‚Äôs messages were obtained via his iCloud while others were obtained via the unnamed sources he communicated with.
@Gizmodo has a fascinating piece about how correspondence conducted via encrypted apps can be obtained by investigators: https://t.co/VTMKAlQy0S
Nunberg said that Mueller is interested in the use of encrypted apps like Confide and WhatsApp (WhatsApp and Telegram were the apps Paul Manafort used for the correspondence Mueller has said was an attempt to tamper with witnesses).
@TreyYingst obtained the email in April: https://t.co/XkcELPvHFb
