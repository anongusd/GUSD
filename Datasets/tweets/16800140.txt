@gbrldz @AmazonHelp If you believe that Amazon is failing to live up to its promises, file a complaint with the FTC at https://t.co/MhWQP9PG55.
@QuickAg1 @amazon File a complaint on the FTC's web site (https://t.co/MhWQP9PG55).  If enough people complain, the FTC will investigate whether Amazon is misleading the public in marketing Amazon Prime for $119 per year.
@AmazonHelp @ShellyMooreBB13 That may be technically true.  But until recently, goods actually showed up in two days.  It's now taking much longer.  So even if Amazon is abiding by its legal obligation, it has changed its practices to customers' detriment.
@rrs0725 @CateH_Jul22nd @amazon @Walmart In my experience, it's gotten worse in the last few weeks.  What's going on?
@christinetucci3 @AmazonHelp In my experience from the last couple weeks, you're very lucky when "free two-day delivery" means just three days.  I don't know what's happened, but Amazon delivery time has gone to hell.  What's going on?
Has @Amazon changed its Prime delivery service?  Free two-day delivery until recently meant that products usually arrived in two days.  Now it seems to mean that products show up in about a week.  And the delivery services seem with regularity to miss even the later date.

Safari 12 keeps freezing, crashing, and omitting parts of web pages.  In addition, I've replaced Ad Block Pro with the App Store version, which doesn't work very well.  I may be alone.  But Apple has taken a finely functioning browser and made it for me unusable.
@savvybarry @AdblockPlus Agreed. The new AdBlock Plus for Safari 12 does not work well. It fails to block some of the ads that the old extension always caught. I trust/hope that the problem will be solved.
@Delta Refreshing (deleting and reinstalling) the app did not work. The My Trips page fails to update on both my iPhone and iPad. When I try to refresh manually, I get ‚ÄúFailed To Update. Please Try Again.‚Äù I can force trips onto the page by searching Find My Trips.

@seanhackbarth Your blue hymnal took a lot from the green LBW, which took hymns from across the Lutheran spectrum.
@seanhackbarth Yeah.  I still miss the liturgy from our old red hymnal (Service Book and Hymnal), which was replaced in 1978!
@seanhackbarth Awful. My experience with LCMS hymns is that you folks often use the "wrong" hymn tunes!
@seanhackbarth @EWErickson On the other hand, Rome has long and deep relations with the LWF (marked by recent joint worship in Sweden).
@seanhackbarth @EWErickson Yes and no. In some ways, the LCMS is closer to RC theology/practice. The LCMS has good relations with the USCCB.
@seanhackbarth @EWErickson I am one of those (although I'm still at an ELCA congregation). It's been painful.
@seanhackbarth @EWErickson That happened bit by bit. It culminated with the 2009 decision to ordain people in same-sex relationships.
@seanhackbarth It was really only the LCA, ALC, and AELC (Seminex-type congregations from the LCMS), the last group perhaps most liberal.
@seanhackbarth @EWErickson The congregation was never conservative. It was middle of the road (for the ELCA).

@BigNoahPeters @FHQ @NateSilver538 Yes. It's the only plan open to anyone other than Cruz or Trump.
@FHQ @NateSilver538 The rule on its face is not clear about this, though. The Chair's rulings could well be challenged.
@Weird_T_Figure @Interloper21 @NateSilver538 The question may be whether Cruz joins Trump in wanting to keep 2012's Rule 40.

@JoelGrant74 @DMiddletonCbus @zgall1 @NateSilver538 Rule 40 on its face is not limited to the first ballot.
@DMiddletonCbus @zgall1 @NateSilver538 Must have support of majority of delegates from at least 8 states. Simply winning a state not enough.
@KASDad @NateSilver538 There are no rules until the Convention approves the Rules Committee recommendation (with any floor amendments).
@MJA_DHO @NateSilver538 Not so sure. Cruz and Trump supporters have every reason to keep it. Key: Do Trump delegates really back Trump?
@BHIndepMO @NateSilver538 House (not Robert's) Rules apply. Speaker votes for non-nominated candidates count. Might be helpful precedent?

@JustinOArnold @NateSilver538 The 2012 Paul delegates announced for Paul in roll call. The chair ignored those votes. But no reallocation.
@Interloper21 @Weird_T_Figure @NateSilver538 The convention approves its own rules and will decide whether the 2012 Rule 40 is included.
@NateSilver538 Ambiguity remains, though. House Rules of Order govern. Do votes for non-nominated Speaker candidates count? I think so.
@NateSilver538 In 2012, state delegations announced votes for Paul. But the chair ignored those. I think only the Romney votes "counted."

@jameshgale Could delegates vote for a candidate not formally nominated? I'm not sure about this either.
@jameshgale Would the 2012 version of Rule 40 allow new nominations after the first ballot as sentiments change? I'm not sure.
@jameshgale Presumably, only Trump and Cruz initially will have the necessary support (majority of 8 delegations) to stand on first ballot.
@jameshgale Trump and Cruz delegates likely will support rules that include the same Rule 40 as approved by the 2012 convention.
@jameshgale Each convention approves rules in its opening session. A simple majority is required.
Many seem unaware that every national convention makes its own rules. So, for example, Rule 40 does not apply unless adopted in Cleveland.
@Taniel To change the rule mid-convention would almost certainly require a 2/3 vote to suspend the rules.
@Taniel Cruz/Trump delegates could approve current Rule 40 by simple majority at the outset.
@Taniel Also, a "change" at the outset requires just a simple majority. A later change almost certainly will require 2/3 majority.

@davidjones720 Under procedural rules, it's never possible to bind the highest legislative body.
@davidjones720 Heck, I think that this is a respectful conversation. Kasich/Rubio would need to get a majority of delegates to change rules.
@davidjones720 Twitter isn't always the best way to have a conversation!
@davidjones720 Sorry for the confusion. My point is that Rubio/Kasich don't believe that Rule 40 would block their nomination.
@davidjones720 Yes.  It's there.  But the convention can change it IF a majority of delegates want to.
@davidjones720 I know that it's there. But these rules don't bind the convention. Delegates can change the rules.
@davidjones720 After the convention approves rules (by simple majority, a 2/3 majority would be required to change them.
@davidjones720 Each convention sets its own rules.
@davidjones720 The RNC will propose a set of rules to the convention. Delegates may approve, revise, or reject the RNC proposal.

@calebhays Exactly. DNC/BO are trying to use Rush to divide GOP and as excuse to ask if we want Obama to "fail." GOP can't play this game.
@calebhays GOP leaders must not debate publicly about what Rush is. They should turn discussion to issues and how they differ from dems.

@adam_eckhardt And I fear that the day is coming when most newspapers (print editions, at least) will be out of business.
@cpedraza A decision not to apply EP to gay marriage would have nothing to do with prejudice. A legislative vote against it might.
@cpedraza Very few judges would apply natural law to create a legal right out of whole cloth.
@hejhim Guten Morgen. Jetzt soll ich ins Bett.
@gboone42 Sunday papers? Awesome. I wonder when all papers (on paper) will be gone. It will be a sad day, at least for us old guys.
@cpedraza But as I said earlier, I don't think that the courts will find gay marriage in EP clause. Would be quite a leap.
@cpedraza Yep.  But courts can enforce rights only to the extent codified in the law. Not up to courts to discern natural law.
@FreedomFactory It's an ideological basis for exercising national/international control over virtually every aspect of life.
@FreedomFactory My sore leg confirms the warming too, I think.  What doesn't?
@cpedraza But rights are created by law, which is made based on popular will except in the few cases where constitution provides otherwise.
@tjbrown It is odd. Academic smarts obviously do not always go along with common sense or good judgment.
@tjbrown BO is doing exactly what he said he'd do.  If C. Buckley was not listening, well . . . .
I love 24. But they sure mangle legal concepts even when not necessary to advance story. #24
@MarkUrbin Yep. The state needs to decide how to deal with benefits. This is happening across the country, mostly through civil unions.
@chandlerepp Movement adopted Mitt as better than McCain. I think there is an opening to his right. Time will tell.
@MarkRMatthews I'm ultimately somewhat libertarian on these issues. Civil unions? OK, I guess. Marriage? No. But good process is key.
@AliAkbar @CPACnews Stop it, you two. Feels like we're all watching two middle schoolers talking about a party invite. : )
@cpedraza I've got to run. Maybe we'll pick this up again. I always appreciate civil debate. Cheers.
@cpedraza I'm not going to debate gay marriage here. 140 characters makes it too difficult.
@cpedraza Rights (eg, speech, religion) enumerated in the Constitution were created for reasons you state. Marriage is not one of those.
@DavidShockey Some absolutely will always try to get courts to legislate. Opposition to this is always worthwhile.
@cpedraza Federal/state constitutions say how laws are made. In my view, that means gay marriage issue is up to legislative/popular vote.
@cpedraza I am indeed not the arbiter of EP litigation. I think that the SCOTUS ultimately will agree with me, but . . . .
@DavidShockey As you know, Constitutional amendments are virtually impossible to enact. #tcot
@cpedraza Rights of majority are trampled when a court imposes a new law, usurping legislative prerogative.
@cpedraza I don't buy the EP argument. I maintain that the GLBT goals will be more widely accepted if attained legislatively, not by suit.
@MarkRMatthews GLBT activists would do better with public by accepting (for now) partial legislative victories. Lawsuits breed contempt.
DNC/WH effort to use Rush as wedge will backfire if GOP just holds its nerve. Dems look like petty practitioners of politics as usual. #tcot
@MarkRMatthews It bothers the heck out of me that courts are imposing new "gay marriage" laws rather than respecting democratic process.

@matthewgagnon @michellemalkin The problem is, by the time Gov. Jindal got to that strong part in the speech, he had all but lost me.

@michellemalkin Many of us who don't think Jindal's speech was good are Jindal fans.  I'm a big fan. Not just Palinization going on.
@MattLewis01 It's not the accent.  It's the delivery.  He needs to slow down.  And sound more serious.

@switty23 By the way, I joined the MN State Society. (At least I think I did. I got a little confused by the web site.)
@switty23 Are all your social outings reported on Twitter?  Could get dangerous!
I love Michigan's football recruiting class. The Wolverines are on their way back!
@Lileks I'm not sure a simple apology is enough for that.  ; )
@downtheticket Keep positive, as hard as that can be.  You'll get yourself back to DC (if that's what you want).

@jameslbarnes There are some zany characters in academia! Makes things interesting.
@gboone42 I think that Souter also is an outsider socially; most other Justices across spectrum get along together well.
@gboone42 By the way, you are partially responsible for my own growing addiction to Twitter.
@gboone42 In case it helps, let me say, "Get off of Twitter and do something productive!"
@gboone42 Some say he has wanted to go for some time and has been waiting for a more liberal president.
Volokhconspiracy.com reports that J. Souter has not hired clerks for next term. Could be sign of planned retirement.
@jameslbarnes Does your communist prof welcome expression of your (and other different) views? If not, it's an outrage. If so, less so.
@lizwhite23 I was part of the conversation last night.  Ah, the Twitterverse.
@fox5newsedge Thanks for crediting me with the link to the You Tube video. Completely unnecessary, but thanks.
@troy_anderson @switty23 You should follow @lesliewilcox.
@greenbacker We absolutely have to play tenacious defense in the years ahead.
@lesliewilcox I do have an iPhone. But I can't use it to follow you. I'll do that from home later today.
@greenbacker I agree that both bills were very bad when measured against free market principles.
@fox5newsedge In light of today, this 1986 Daschle campaign ad is priceless. http://tinyurl.com/ctxzct
@greenbacker Hey, I completely agree with you on the merits. I'm simply saying that there is a difference between the two bills.
@greenbacker The argument: $$ last fall "needed" to keep financial system operating. $$ today is nothing but pork.
@annakate22 A bunch of "you knows" in there as well.  (Not as many per minute as Caroline, but still . . . .)
@fox5newsedge Very dangerous to run for office as new Mr. Clean. Inevitably you end up having to introduce your glass house to a few stones.
@michellemalkin Does Gibbs remind anyone else of Scott McClellan?
@greenbacker A principled distinction between October and now is possible (although not persuasive to me). McCain's opposition now is huge.
@MintCool At that age, I always flunked nap time.  My appreciation for a mid-day rest is much greater now.

@parnellk63 Laying off visa holders before citizens is a form of protectionism that, if copied by other states, will undercut any recovery.

@shok_trauma Of course, Lynch might not be willing to do this.
@shok_trauma Don't know what Lynch would do. I think that Gregg should take it, if at all, only if he signs off on a specific successor.

@jonscott2008 I don't know what to do about the "non-partisan" groups.  Very little can be done, I suppose.  You can sue, but good luck.
@jonscott2008 RC bishops lean both ways. But they should be concerned with spiritual care of right and left in the flock. Not elections.
@jonscott2008 Religious people should be involved in politics. Wish that the church (religious right and left) were not. Clouds the Gospel.
@syancyfox5 I'll be watching.  Keep up the great work!
@syancyfox5 HD looks great!
@troy_anderson Wow, Troy.  Sounds like you hang out in some "interesting" places.
@PatrickRuffini Agree re weekly address. BO ought not look like basement podcaster. He'll erode aura of presidency, an asset he needs.
Michigan 2 - Notre Dame 1 (hockey).  Huge win for the maize and blue.

@IndyEnigma I don't think that one could guess Steele's race from the content of his positions. He's not about identity politics. #rncchair
@ericjodom The #rncchair feed does seem to be having problems in the last few minutes.
By electing a chair who happens to be black, the RNC is playing identity politics? This logic would exclude all ethnic minorities. #rncchair
I don't understand why some claim that Steele is not conservative. Just not true. #rncchair
@matthewgagnon You definitely have been on your A game today. (Or at least I generally have agreed with you!) You deserve the RTs. #rncchair

@fhundt Nobody is saying that Dawson is a bad guy/racist. The concern is that he easily can be dismissed by opponents as racist. #rncchair
@TeamWMD I care alot when the MSM has the ability to block our message by playing the racism card. Why even provide that opening?
@TeamWMD The problem is that the DNC and MSM would paint Dawson as racist. Fair or not, that's the reality. #rncchair

@matthewgagnon Whatever his abilities, Dawson strikes me as an unhelpful face for the party.
@matthewgagnon Agree re Duncan dropping out after Ballot 3. Question: Will he endorse? #rncchair
@RyanJGill Voters know each other well. It's hard to "fire" a friend. The high number of votes "against" Duncan speaks volumes. #rncchair
@ted_pibil Duncan vote will not remain constant. It will bleed away steadily and quickly. #rncchair
Duncan was done after ballot 1. Ballot 2 merely confirms. His decision now: Drop out and endorse ( be a kingmaker?) or just watch. #rncchair
@calebhays Losing audio not always bad. Mine just cut out as C-SPAN cut to BO.
I disagree that this was strong showing for Duncan. I think he's toast. It will be Steele v a "conservative" challenger. #rncchair.
How many days will this last? #rncchair

@nathanielward On balance, the RCN upgrade is good. But some HD channels now cost extra.  And I wish they'd add the Big 10 network.
@matthewgagnon Little grammar mistakes drive me nuts too.  Not to mention the word "like."  It's a curse, I'm afraid.
@matthewgagnon You'd think that SOMEONE on staff at FNC would have corrected the mistake.  But even the big boys were getting it wrong. Ugh
@rightwingsparkl Blago's wife is the daughter of a corrupt Chicago political boss. She seems to have been his partner in crime.
@matthewgagnon Do they even teach civics any more? Those mistakes drive me nuts too.
@matthewgagnon #blago It's so bad it's funny. Which is why I can't help thinking how amusing it would be to watch him question Rahm.

@troy_anderson @switty23 Back from Gustavus Board meeting.  Time to schedule a gathering around a beer.
@gboone42 Just back to DC from MN. While waiting for the Metro at DCA, I enjoyed the evening warmth -- 30 degrees, about 40 warmer than MSP.
Just landed in Milwaukee. Too warm here so I'm flying on to Minneapolis.
@troy_anderson I'll let you know what happens, perhaps over beer. Would be tough to live tweet while chairing the meeting, but who knows?
@troy_anderson It's great to know all your scientist tricks. Have a good weekend. I'm heading to MN tomorrow for a GAC Board meeting. Brrr.
@troy_anderson If Stuckey and I watch this, would we know enough to call oursleves scientists?
@infidelsarecool It will indeed be interesting to see how the new rules, not all of which are public, play out.
@CharlieSmith I'm asking Geithner to prepare my taxes.  Hoping he misses some.
@infidelsarecool So under the new regime, maybe enhanced interrogation is ok only if it results in death? What a twist!

@calebhays Hell no.  No Ronnie chias.
@calebhays Chiaobama is the best Obama souvenir I've seen.  Not even close. Wow.
@greenbacker Odds are high that you're right. Even so, whether there is reason or not, I am not willing to give up just yet.
@alexashrugged Ain't that the truth!
@sanuzis Reagan is a hero to me.  But we should not say we are looking for leader "like Reagan." To many, this sounds backward looking.
@greenbacker European "tolerance" is Trojan horse. Islamists use it to "sneak" in.  Still time to push back.  But clock is ticking.
@greenbacker I don't think that the surrender papers have been signed yet.  But they are being drafted.
@michellemalkin Maybe Caroline is going to move to Mass to succeed Uncle Teddy. That is a family seat, after all.
@downtheticket It's hard to get what's going on on Lost, let alone tweet about it. Still, whatever the hell's happening, I am enjoying it.
@greenbacker Many European countries bestow much narrower free speech right than the US does.  Sadly.
@jenciTN Maybe it will turn out that Laura Palmer is alive and well on the island.

@troy_anderson What's an antibody? So you science geeks do research on Twitter.  I love that.

@ScottDismuke Roberts screwed up the oath, and that through Obama off.  He couldn't decide whether to say it right or follow the CJ.

@calebhays God?  That was Rick Warren's job.
@michellemalkin The CJ botched the oath.  BHO was stuck, not sure whether to say it right or follow the CJ's lead.
@brooksbayne Botching the oath was not BHO's fault.  Unfortunately, CJ Roberts got it wrong.  BHO understandably was thrown off.

@bhdonovan I think that the MSM likes holding them up as examples of "social conservatives."  It fits their narrative.
@ChrisGrewe Put another way, she is every bit as qualified as about 10,000,000 other NYers. Except that she wins out on the "you knows."
@bhdonovan Yep.  They are as bad as it gets.  Zero compassion for anyone and no respect for the service of our young people.
@ChrisGrewe Maybe Paterson should be concerned about a primary challenge from the Cuomo camp.  He's in a bind either way.
@bhdonovan Agreed. Of course, many will identify them with conservatives and the GOP.  Not fair.  Not true.  But they will.
@ChrisGrewe Let's see.  Caroline is over 30. A US citizen.  A resident of NY.  And holds the record for number of "you knows" in a sentence.

@Gribbit Whether or not one thinks that voters are ignorant, you don't win votes with a campaign based on assuming this. Quite the contrary.
@Gribbit GOP should not abandon principles. In fact, by already doing so, GOP gave voters a reason to turn away.
@Timaay I don't remember the meeting, but the funny thing is that I just started thinking about one.  What a coincidence.
@Gribbit GOP will not regain its footing by blaming the voters.

@slaterradio Can the TN house function with this result?  The new speaker is kidding himself, I think.  He'll have no allies.
@lukegus What the heck is going on?  Are the dems going to succeed in electing a renegade Republican?

@emzanotti Good point.  But my Indian friends, who do like the movie, don't think it's very "Bollywood."  (except the dance at the end)
@gboone42 I hate the idea of getting into a new TV show. Takes so much time.  But if 30 Rock is good, well, maybe it's worthwhile.
@emzanotti Slumdog Millionaire is not a Bollywood movie.  It's a Hollywood film set in India.
@CPACnews Damn.  Maybe I'll have to check 30 Rock out.
What's up with 30 Rock?  Never watched it.  Do you all like it?  Hollywood obviously does.
@CPACnews In my opinion, you definitely should see Slumdog and John Adams.  B. Button is very good, but very long. Liked but didn't love it.

Did MN SOS appoint two GOP SCT members to the canvassing board in part to exclude them from considering appeals in a contest?  Just asking.
@calebhays #tcot The McCain PAC web site also is entirely devoid of content (except the request for money).  http://www.countryfirstpac.com/
@MattLewis01 Exactly.  And the uncounted absentee ballots.  The public can easily understand these issues and the need to resolve them.
@MattLewis01 Contest shouldn't hurt Coleman if he sticks to 2-3 discrete issues.  He ought not call whole process into doubt, however.
@jeffersonpoole I spilled an entire Diet Coke on a Dell some years back.  The Diet Coke won.
@rightblogs If Jeb is interested in running for president, winning a Senate seat would not have helped much.
The Minnesota Senate race is not over, no matter what some media are saying.  http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2009/01/022479.php
Happy Three Kings Day!
@calebhays Hackintosh.  I like that.
@calebhays Apple is a victim of its own success.  They can't possibly outdo themselves EVERY year.  But we/I expect them to anyway.
@calebhays I like being excited about the next "must have" Apple product, and I just don't see one coming now.
@calebhays As an Apple fan (MBP and iphone), I wonder whether the company is losing some of its mojo.
@mikeus Looks very bad for OSU.
@mikeus As a Big Ten fan, I actually hope that OSU wins.
@mikeus You can't be an OSU student.  You spelled Ohio correctly.  (I'm a bitter UM alum, so I can't quite help myself.)
@JRGriggs The NCAA instituted sudden death for football about ten years ago.  So sadly, no ties.
@Flap Mitch McConnell and friends will be able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the Burris show.
@JRGriggs I care but I have a problem.  I want both teams to lose.  So I can't come away happy.
@Flap It's smart for the Dems to hold off on seating Franken.  So I'm surprised.
@AliAkbar If BHO wants a master of the recount, why not Al Franken?
@Gribbit I agree with that as well.
@Gribbit I like your idea. But 1 person 1 vote SCOTUS cases apply to all but electoral college and us senate.
@Gribbit That's an interesting theory.  But it would require a Constitutional amendment.  Would violate 1 person 1 vote SCOTUS decisions.
I hate this Fiesta Bowl.  The Big Ten fan in me wants OSU to win.  The Michigan fan in me most assuredly does not.
@gboone42 Keep tapping your heals together and saying, "There's no place like home."
@CPACnews The word "like" should be banished for more than just 2009, except on those rare occasions when used properly.
@AliAkbar Maybe.  But the letter is poorly written.  Eg, "Friends, let us remember that every one of the candidates . . . are . . . ."
Am watching the MN canvassing board on startribune.com.  Is it just me, or does this look almost as arbitrary as chad counting in FL in '00?
@RobBallew Enjoyed the article.  Thanks.
@seanhackbarth I can't get Twhirl to work right now either.
@daltonsbriefs The administration will use Chu's Nobel prize (physics, not peace) to bolster the "scientific" argument for global warming.
Steven Chu named Energy Secretary.  Big global warming guy.  #tcot http://tinyurl.com/6o2v88
@gboone42 I haven't been to China.  It's definitely on my list.  When are you back in MN?  February?
@scsuscholars The failure to elect Santo to the HOF is an absolute outrage.
This article says that BO and Brago did meet re Senate seat. Credible?  #tcot http://tinyurl.com/5dgcbm
@mindyfinn Based on data collected since 1960, any elected Democratic governor of IL has a 100% chance of going to prison.
@Bodhi1 Thanks for your "UN" series. Key aspects of our sovereignty could be at risk.  http://www.allamericanblogger.com/
@gboone42 You're back in Twitterland.  How was your trip?
Will BO move toward "global government"?  An FT columnist thinks so.    http://tinyurl.com/6bp8w5
@calebhays Absolutely agree.
@calebhays Yep.  They'd also find that many on the other side are happy to have a civil conversation.  (At least that's my experience.)
@calebhays It's interesting that conservative students so often just keep quiet.  It's those of us who just can't who become "that kid."
@calebhays You too.  How open do you find your campus to a diversity of viewpoints?  Are different views welcomed/tolerated/suppressed?
@calebhays I think that most of us here were "that kid."  Heck, I still am and I'm 47.
@infidelsarecool Optimism?  Not yet.  Corruption pervades IL politics.  Ryan's conviction didn't change that.  This alone won't either.
@AnnaTarkov Is there any sense in the Chicago trenches that Blago could implicate BHO?  Daley?
Blago's corruption is indeed "staggering."  His stupidity is equally staggering.  He knew he was under scrutiny, and still . . . .
Is Illinois Lt Gov Pat Quinn linked to Blago's corruption?  Anyone know?
@jasoninthehouse Welcome to Twitter, Congressman Chaffetz.
@justin_hart No blogs or web sites quite yet.  Perhaps soon.
@Rob_Stevenson What approach do you think conservatives should take at colleges?  (FWIW I chair the governing Board of a college in MN.)
@Jaustin Thanks for the welcome.  Good to be here.
@MichaelTurk I find all the US carriers now to be unreliable.  But what choice have we but to use them, at least for domestic travel?
@MichaelTurk Don't we all.  A friend was stranded on the way to Beijing  by UAL.  Was very concerned about prepaid hotel, etc.
@gboone42 American and Continental will end up on your list as well once you select them a few times.  Guaranteed.
@gboone42 Check out http://is.gd/9ZT9 and look at 91.1051 et seq.  International travel is fine if rest periods and staffing rules followed.
@gboone42 Working more hours in a given period of time than allowed either by contract or the FAA.  Specified rest hours must be taken.
@gboone42 They probably will offer you some travel vouchers for use on your eagerly anticipated future UAL flights.  Crying baby included.
@gboone42 Just looked at UAL web site.  Only obligation seems to be to get you to your destination or refund ticket price.
@gboone42 You certainly can threaten legal action, but I don't know how far that will get you.  Would need to know more facts.
@gboone42 Hang in there.  Hope you get to Beijing.  Or at least off the damn plane.
Waiting impatiently at Denver International Airport with nothing to do but read @gboone's tweets.
I am "following" all of 7 people and am being "followed" by 2 (thanks Damir and Greg).  We'll see how much I use this.
