@rawrxbld hope you find someone who will appreciate and listen to you
@rawrxbld :( I'm sorry
@redpawn3 trying to figure that out myself
@rawrxbld I know some relationships like that
@thebikinichef will suggest this to a few people
@goroe it is awesome. My dreams coming to pass before my eyes
@DailyNuggetGold I will :)
@KnowledgeBishop that's what I'm doing
@LoraneGordon I plan on it :-)
@LoraneGordon @cheryldouglass when I'm at #peace and not concerned, freaked out or anything they think something's wrong with me
@LoraneGordon @cheryldouglass that is true too Lorane. It scares many around when I walk in that #peace but it is freeing
@cheryldouglass by "silencing" my mind I shift focus from worries concerns many which may never happen to things that matter @loranegordon
@cheryldouglass I am not saying not to think.  But sometimes we think and dwell on worries and concerns too much @loranegordon
@ShebaJo then get some sleep
@ShebaJo I'm good and you?
@JeannieGrissom oh good I need new and good Drs. And I will say hi lol
@ShebaJo hi Sheila
@JeannieGrissom then why not? Though I am going to Cali and Nashville lol
@JeannieGrissom well I moved to FL though in a few months I'm moving again lol
@terrinakamura AUNTIE how are you?
@LoraneGordon I try to walk everyday and silence my mind and clear my thoughts

@MzBrendaL around there, San Fran or both. I can still work with Sacramento later when I have higher capital to work with
@MzBrendaL thanks. My feeling is if I do this right it can launch everything else I want to do.
@MzBrendaL it is. Lots of traveling, promoting, booking, etc.
@MzBrendaL it's something I asked an artist I know for last week.
@mzbrendal yes. I have to be. I am now a music artist manager so making trips between Nashville and California
@MzBrendaL back in Florida for a four month stint then off to Nashville and Cali lol

@LoisMarketing I would love to move to a community bank but I'm moving twice this year
@JustinaVail Hope you all have a wonderful week @ralphlarner @laurenmgalley @jasoncjean

@klac14 Yay
@klac14 that's all we can do. -
@klac14 that is a good thing I think
@klac14 can you let me know when you if and when are having the surgeries. My friends and I will pray for you.
@klac14 Yea. And each surgery makes you a stronger fighter.
@310Sunshine310 hope you have a great evening
@klac14 and they look at you funny when you explain it?
@klac14 so true. Makes us unique people I think
@Laurie160 no problem I'm here for a friend. Hey I'll be back in my fav sunny Cali in June so it could happen if eyes don't get checked
@klac14 you're very welcome. I have Cerebral Palsy, which doesn't compare to CHD, but I know about tough days
@Carolyn_Bulsink I got a fabulous opportunity in addition to everything I'm doing to be a music booking agent for a friend. Keeping busy :-)
@Laurie160 please do. I could pass you and you not even know it lol
@klac14 YaY. If you ever get down or have another long or bad day I'll be around for encouragement. And I'll lookout for new blog posts
@Laurie160 oh boy. When is getting eyes checked?
@Laurie160 of course it I'd rather laugh with you though. Don't wanna hurt feelings
@klac14 God never said His missions were easy. But he's given us both the strength to accomplish them.
@SashaKane you too Sasha
@rawrxbld I never do.

@klac14 that is so nice and thoughtful. Bet you're a fighter
@iPenginBrijhe I agree especially since it is such a tough business with tour dates and stuff
@klac14 and I want to give you props for putting yourself there with the blog posts and your story :)
@iPenginBrijhe yea that's true. Simon was harsh but even his harshness was to try make artists better I think
@Shelb_Johnson48 same here
@klac14 oh good :)
@iPenginBrijhe exactly they are constructive and don't just put them down. Much better. Since Simon left Idol has been slipping
@RachelintheOC it's true but still so funny
@klac14 and don't study too hard unless you have tough courses
@iPenginBrijhe I wouldn't respond well if I kept being put down. I've slowly been liking the Voice more

@Michiganborn58 @shebajo @anniesage goodnight. Would love to pick up this topic another time
@Michiganborn58 @shebajo @anniesage yep restaurants need edu on this issue. People worldwide would benefit
@ShebaJo @michiganborn58 @anniesage those foods ripe for donating. Anything like that in my office would be
@ShebaJo @anniesage I'll do that in addition to biz. Proper education is needed
@ShebaJo @michiganborn58 @anniesage just not partially eaten foods others than that I agree
@AnnieSage could use that idea to start a not for profit @shebajo
@ShebaJo @anniesage so true Sheila
@AnnieSage how would you like to help Annie? @shebajo
@ShebaJo doing my part to help with obesity and other food issues @anniesage
@AnnieSage I plan to donate to poor as well. Lots of ideas from this I have @shebajo
@AnnieSage been working with dietitians here on twitter to develop a natural corporate food plan @shebajo
@AnnieSage why not? I even want to build a greenhouse for my business natural food for employees @shebajo
@AnnieSage I will though if it is gall stones drs say they may do surgery @shebajo
@AnnieSage I don't think so. Drs suggested I not have coffee, alcohol, or spicy foods @shebajo
@AnnieSage yea probably an ulcer. I'm making major diet changes when I move to Cali @ShebaJo
@ShebaJo I would love to build a greenhouse and grow food @anniesage
@AnnieSage don't give up hope. :( @shebajo
@AnnieSage I think so Drs running tests for bacteria in stomach, ulcer, gallstones @shebajo
@AnnieSage I love Cali. Went to LA in 2009 and loved the beaches.
@AnnieSage sounds like it. Drs say I need as natural a diet as possible @shebajo
@AnnieSage I will. I am actually moving to CA with a job. No one from the family can afford to move there
@ShebaJo Diagnosis coming next week. @anniesage
@ShebaJo welcome back :) @anniesage
@AnnieSage yea that is the plan. Any time I visit FL he will not know a
@ShebaJo yea I hear you. Drs trying to figure out a health situation I am going through @anniesage
@ShebaJo I'm okay. Having an enjoyable time on twitter @anniesage
@AnnieSage that's why I'm moving way west while they all go to FL
@AnnieSage his sisters got into a huge fight no guns. But they were pointing knives at each other. I was in middle.
@AnnieSage I have nearly died not just because of the roommate but because of his family's temper. Ten days I'm out.
@Laurie160 like having a friend who enjoys rock and metal
@AnnieSage I am he wants to go to FL and I will stay with a good friend before moving out west
@AnnieSage I just didn't realize it until after living with him. I shoulda trusted my friends saying don't do it.
@AnnieSage I'm sorry :( I'm not perfect I am getting out of a situation with a roommate who is two faced and I'm going to the opposite coast
@AnnieSage oh no I wouldn't live with them if I can avoid it
@giggles_project hey Joey what's up #JGF @dentaldiva1
@AnnieSage I agree it is meant for fun not wallowing in depression or anything. Unfortunately not everyone agrees. I love them regardless
@AnnieSage :( sorry to hear that. I have a roommate like that minus he doesn't drink
@AnnieSage I drink yes but not enough to get drunk.
@ShebaJo how are you Sheila @anniesage
@AnnieSage I know. I've learned to a friend. Telling people how to live their life won't help. I try and care even if I disagree
@AnnieSage consider me crazy but I don't take advantage of drunk women.
@AnnieSage lol Annie @just_some_lady
@dentaldiva1 yay any reason
@Laurie160 I try :) aa@theraygungirls
@worldwidebopp you're welcome
@dentaldiva1 oh good. Out having fun?
@dentaldiva1 hanging in there. Lots of Drs appointments this week prepping for a move all fun stuff. How about you
@dentaldiva1 DONNA
@just_some_lady come August bye bye to most of those friends
@just_some_lady that is the single biggest reason why I am in no rush at the moment. Plus with my health too
@just_some_lady I know. I just am trying not to repeat former relationship and have some financial security
@gxbriella I am working for it
@just_some_lady I've told them I will make the decision when I feel I find the right match. I'm obviously not as impatient
@just_some_lady yea I did. Some of them are just stubborn.
@just_some_lady friends want to put me on one of the dating shows to see how I do
@just_some_lady lol they can be
@just_some_lady used to date a Gemini before we broke that off
@just_some_lady no male. And I definitely would not go out with him
@just_some_lady thank you :) I'd like to think so. I may have to think about what type I would go out with
@just_some_lady actually roommate is Sagittarius
@just_some_lady that is true. Very true. Drives my Aquarius roommate crazy
@just_some_lady it takes a bit to annoy me. My roommate easily does that by not listening
@just_some_lady lol I can't talk to you without you putting a smile on my face
@VintageBabe1212 something I try to explain to others
@just_some_lady yea though I am about to take a muscle relaxer and well relax and be on twitter a bit obviously
‚Äú@cyberceas: #DODGERS &amp; #LAKERS Win tonight, Looks like another perfect day... I LOVE LA !!!‚Äù &gt; :)
‚Äú@Laurie160: Metal lovers..follow&gt;&gt; @theraygungirls Oh yeahhhh!!! WTG...Now thats #rockin in the darkness!!‚Äù &gt; following now
@rippleali love that
@just_some_lady I am exhausted dr appointment today, business today = long day. Why do you feel stupid? Q
@just_some_lady how are you
@mavus15 I agree every game is a must win and/or must lose for Jazz a
@KrisColvin even the best can and probably will fail @heypoulette
@mavus15 great win and remain in playoff spot
@2BFitLori yea easier to carry. And I still support wonderful authors
@2BFitLori yes. I am a busy person and travel a lot. My primary device is my iPhone. I also like to travel as light as possible
@2BFitLori even better :) I use my iPhone as primary reading device lol
@2BFitLori I hope it will be on kindle or iBooks
@2BFitLori you're welcome. Trying to support other authors
@2BFitLori let me know when it's available for preorder
@2BFitLori what is the book on if you don't me asking
@2BFitLori that must feel good :)
@2BFitLori and you lot 125lbs congrats
@2BFitLori yea I love it that way. It doesn't feel like work doing what I love
@docjohnreed @angels510 Good :)
@2BFitLori you're welcome :)
@thejessbess nice
@docjohnreed lol you have your own smoothness doesn't need to be identical to Angie @angels510
@heykim I used to. Still kinda can. Just not five or six things
@heykim lol you do this a lot
@heykim question is which are you paying most attention to?
@heykim lol
@heykim multitasker
@kimgarst one thing I learned is its easier to keep existing cust than attract new one. Just got to keep them coming while gaining new ones
@RoyAtkinson will Dom. Thanks Roy
@thelastshow KAREN
@ashleypittman_ beautiful
@rwardlow7 I don't currently
@RoyAtkinson lol
@MzBrendaL that is exactly how I feel. When build the company to the point that it is less likely to fail I will date
@MzBrendaL why's that
@MzBrendaL you're talking about not dating coworkers. Well until I get company going I took myself off the market.
@MzBrendaL of course :) we do
@MzBrendaL like ME when I move obviously
@docjohnreed thanks John. I am grateful for two additional mentors :) @angels510
@MelissaGalt not all marketing is 'online' as people interpret social media so there has to be more to marketing plan
@MzBrendaL lol
@kimgarst building relationships take time and effort but beneficial to long term success
@KatrinaKavvalos I can do that too. I drive a couple friends crazy when I go on personal 'movie marathons'
@VintageBabe1212 oh dear
@KatrinaKavvalos that works. Dinnertime used to be my primary TV entertainment time as a child besides movies at theaters
@RachelintheOC cool :) not that matters. I'd still read it.
@KatrinaKavvalos lol I like the advantage of watching when I want and not dictated by day and time. Allows me to focus on what matters
@GreenSkyDeb Yes it is :)
@JessicaNorthey dancing in the shower can be dangerous for health. I know lol
@SarahHathorn I have several mentors that help me daily. Such an encouragement and motivation
@docjohnreed @angels510 problem is I am continuously thinking of rarely done things. No standard management or team here
@KatrinaKavvalos not weird I'm doing more reading though I catch the same shows you mentioned on demand.
@RachelintheOC congrats. Will read it this weekend or part of it.
@docjohnreed going to have to put a unique team together @angels510
@ventivodkacran oyi how you manage that one
@angels510 plus outsourcing for office, hotel, restaurants kinda hard üòâ
@angels510 I know but like everything else food and nutrition is being looked at differently
@angels510 I don't trust it
@angels510 I have several mentors :) some are also giving diet and nutrition advice for cafeteria
@angels510 ah ok. I am young don't have terribly lot of management experience but I have researched my options :)
@angels510 cheerleaders, encouragers, supporters üòÉ @mzbrendal
@angels510 it can happen but not often. I am trying to create a balance on that @docjohnreed
@angels510 when I say childish I don't mean age of execs as much as how management doesn't treat employees as adults @docjohnreed
@angels510 exactly not like the almost childish ways companies are managed today  @docjohnreed
@angels510 that is true. It keeps everyone accountable on a higher level and not like kids @docjohnreed
@angels510 yea exactly that makes even the CEO accountable from the company @docjohnreed
@angels510 that is different and interesting @docjohnreed
@angels510 oh ok. That is NOT my style unless a person forces me to for say continuous ignoring crucial warnings @docjohnreed
@angels510 explain more sorry long day drs visit @docjohnreed
@angels510 what do mean by metaphor in this case  @docjohnreed
@angels510 I am doing as 'flat' a management as possible. Obvious need CEO, CFO for SEC reasons @docjohnreed
@Icametumbling You're welcome. Glad I could help a friend
@Icametumbling you're welcome. Glad I can help :)
@Icametumbling I will keep you and the family in my thoughts and prayers

@kreativekonnect ohhhhhhhh okay skin is the best at that
@RonaldLewis what apps did you use #mobileoffice
@kreativekonnect so the mag oil skin solution works like the capsule or pill?
@kreativekonnect that is true. Non farmed fish taste better I think
@kreativekonnect I will also eat more fish
@KellyLynnAdams when you #invest in yourself you are able to assist others from life experiences
@kreativekonnect @lorishemek I will be pricking both of your brains as I go through this process to eat healthier.
@kreativekonnect Cool. I will have to add that to my routine
@kreativekonnect nice to know.
@FoojanMomeni lol
@kreativekonnect that is true as well. Mom was saying that when she got diabetes
@kreativekonnect I want to minimize processed sugar for more natural if possible. Used to have sugar cane as sugar substitute in Caribbean
@PeterVoogd23 been telling a few this.
@kreativekonnect sounds good. I prefer a more natural diet than fat free
@kreativekonnect thanks @lorishemek
@kreativekonnect any suggestions @lorishemek
@kreativekonnect dr advised me to minimize fat with non processed food options @lorishemek

@MzBrendaL why would I invite friends over for lol
@MzBrendaL You're welcome. :)
@MzBrendaL you and @angels510 have been fabulous cheerleaders in my life. Won't forget either of you through success. Too valued in my life
@MzBrendaL I'm no cheerleader. And I do not feel others are above me no matter the money. I may avoid negativity though
@MzBrendaL I won't be a stranger after I make it
@jshe and only time will tell. I'm biased though lol
@MzBrendaL I can handle it. I can still run my company at a certain pace ;)
@GWPStudio then I'll bother you more lol. Just a warning  @terrinakamura @smqueue
@SweetCarolina44 lol it's a zoo in there
@MzBrendaL I won't leave leave Cali once I move. It's too nice
@KateNasser to me failure is kind of reminiscent of an event like a choice to remember of not @fsonnenberg
@MzBrendaL Vegas is a great destination and will get a condo there to work with mentor. Cali is a fabulous adventure lol
As much as #NickiMinaj drives me crazy I found myself catching up on this season's #AmericanIdol
@MzBrendaL oh yes. Even my mentor pushed me from moving to Vegas to Cali because he knew
@GWPStudio thanks Greg. Terri and I are just excited over Smqueue. Thank you for continuing to listen @terrinakamura @smqueue

@gxbriella yay

@jshe wonder if they will.
@AngelaBisignano I try and have as few titles at my company and more influence. Companies would be different if they did

@weMAXthat Will do. Hopefully getting it ready before everything
@MzBrendaL that is true :) multiple cities to choose and live in

@MzBrendaL and Cali has both :)
@MzBrendaL when I lived in FL besides Orlando I was 15 minutes from the beach. I loved it can't get away from that anymore for too long
@MzBrendaL I prefer the beaches of both which is closer to where I'll be :)
@MzBrendaL yes I was in LA and SD in 2009 and LOVED IT. I wouldn't live in downtown LA but I fell in love with CA then
@MzBrendaL oh yes. Personally and professionally I want to be out there
@MzBrendaL of course I will be LA from June 21-25 for a conference and once I make big move to Cali I'll need to be in the area

@BobChoat yup that is my open plan
@BobChoat I am also using this idea as a test for state and federal gov and others to follow
@BobChoat I will have a greenhouse cover food for all of it
@BobChoat that is what I want to do. I want buy enough land for any my corporate offices, restaurants and other green buildings.
@BobChoat I will definitely be delving deeper into green and natural ways for foods, living, and other options. Getting back to nature
@BobChoat excellent advice. And I can have cafeteria with healthier options
@BobChoat so true. That will help. I am looking to build some of these ideas to the employees as well
@BobChoat I can do squats in the chair so I will do that
@BobChoat ok :)
@BobChoat I which check that out. Guess I can find foods like that at Whole Foods
@BobChoat like what kind of foods
@BobChoat yea I don't have super great upper body strength so going to gym is tough. Looking into alternative ways to work out
@BobChoat I do sit a lot but I also had cerebral palsy which created ankle issues.
@BobChoat that is what I want to achieve. I am 29 with back, ankle, and stomach pain. Drs think gallstones or stomach bacteria
@LisaMonroeNow @laurie160 thanks Lisa. I do my best to help where I can
@BobChoat that is my intent. I've even thought buying enough land to build house and small greenhouse
@BobChoat my Drs have suggested I move to a fat free diet which is encouraging me to go natural if possible
@BobChoat let me know when I can preorder on Kindle or iBooks
@LisaMonroeNow I'm trying but not like Cali. Helping friends move to Orlando in a week then conference then back home @laurie160
@BobChoat yes I know. I will have to pick both your brains. If that is okay @lorishemek
@BobChoat when will it be published/released?
@BobChoat yea me too for health reasons. I just don't see the system doing it fast enough. Unless I'm wrong.
@BobChoat Lori and I have talked on a few occasions. Interested to hear more what you both know and about the book @lorishemek
@BobChoat I all definitely look into it. Part of the requests from many I talk to is a more environmental hospital
@BobChoat yea it is interesting and challenging finding the best options available and the return on savings
@AmericanWomannn glad everything went well :)

@JeannieGrissom not to mentions great friends like you and family
@JeannieGrissom I'll be fine through this. I had ankle and arm surgery before so this is a stepping stone to what I wanna be
@JeannieGrissom yea. They state with the pain I am in surgery may be needed if not bacteria
@shelleylubben I did that in spite of pressure from friends to continue
@JeannieGrissom drs say I may have a stomach bacteria, gallstones or an ulcer and testing for all three. If latter two may need surgery
@JeannieGrissom hanging in there. Drs say I may have
@CheryeDavis if I had a twitter crush lol
@JeannieGrissom how are you doing?
RT @heykim: üéâCongratulations @SHAQ on @Lakers jersey retirement tonight. #SHAQ34 /via @jodywatley
@PKauhausen always do
A10: Scripts are someone I rarely use. I do not see how they can morph much if CS is priority #custserv
A9: Consistent training and encouragement is what I use instead of scripts #custserv
@MarshaCollier true. I have used Twitter to contact some companies with great results too #custserv
Q7: I have no trouble contacting the companies on mobile especially those strong in service. #custserv
A6: the use mobility does provide some challenges especially with social media but reps can be prepared with training #custserv
A4: with proper training and knowledge reps may not need a script for messages. They can be human #custserv
A3: I ONLY use scripts at my company if a CSR wants a guide. Other than than that I allow them to be CSRs #custserv
A2: when a CSR uses a script it limits their service ability and be a true CSR. Script can be a guide though #custserv
A1: having worked in a call center I can usually tell when someone is using a script. In most cases I think they are #custserv
@GregOrtbach yes I have #custserv @custservgreeter
@JeannieGrissom thanks luv and I will keep you posted. Ultrasound sometime this week for it
@JeannieGrissom well Drs think they narrowed down my stomach issues to three possibilities to be tested for

@RyanCastro so very true
@docjohnreed if most people took responsible we'd see much higher success levels I think @angels510
@docjohnreed as much as it hurts me I'll be responsible for my actions. I'll grow and learn from them @angels510
@docjohnreed it easier to hide and blame others because then they continue being lazy and no need to change @angels510
@laffytakky looks good

@angels510 LA is only a small satellite location for studios that is it
@angels510 as is he. I am definitely listening to my mentor. IF I am not going to Sacramento I will be in San Fran.
@angels510 you and my mentor understand the reasons. Most everyone else think LA is best because my interests are dominant in LA
@angels510 I say shockingly because a lot think of Malibu and areas around there good for me lol
@angels510 my first choice remains Sacramento shockingly
@angels510 besides my opportunity to move to Sacramento I got a option in LA and I'll be able to do both :)

@ShiCooks exactly. Although you and others on twitter say I will make a lot, I will use the money for family and to help others.
@CarrieWilkerson they don't understand the beauty of communication. Their loss our gain.
@ShiCooks that is why I leave him in Florida and move to an 'expensive' state Lol. I prefer humble people
@ShiCooks so true. Many aren't willing to admit mistakes and change from them
@ShiCooks my roommate is like that which is why I move to CA. Plus I have not visited a state in continental US I love more
@ShiCooks I do. And I just let them be. I understand myself and them to know there is no changing them unless they want to
@ShiCooks yup. A small part why I'm moving to Cali has to do with that
@sherehaan indeed it is
@ShiCooks I am moving away from such people
@ImCindyWilliams will never do that
@donnette that's good. I'm on twitter a lot these days so we won't have to be strangers lol

@JillHubersinger I genuinely want to see you succeed. I don't care if I get anything out of it. Any advice that works I will let you know.
@JillHubersinger don't follow all those they follow at once or twitter can ban you.
@JillHubersinger with people with large numbers it helps to follow those they follow. But be careful.
@JillHubersinger those have a large influence
@JillHubersinger one tip to get followers is looking at those that have a lot of followers and those following them.
@MyPowertalk very true
@JillHubersinger I have a great mentor who has helped me over the last few years
@JillHubersinger I have been given several pieces of advice to grow on twitter that I am using to grow.

@ABHuret voicemails like that drive me crazy #custserv
@GregOrtbach A10: Yes I give feedback to companies. Good or bad experiences it doesn't matter #custserv
@GregOrtbach @custservgreeter A9: I place no limits. If paper has X characters I will provide blank paper. #custserv
@ABHuret that is so true and that is part of customer service #custserv
@ABHuret great that you had that leeway #custserv

@GregOrtbach A8: Listen and show empathy. #custserv
Q7: I have never really discouraged cust to cut back. Cust will complain and need someone to voice that to #custserv

A6: as a friend try to be open, non aggressive/threatening in listening to cust needs #custserv
‚Äú@SJAbbott: Jumping in a little late for #custserv.‚Äù &gt; better late than not at all
Very true ‚Äú@mike_nunes: A5) Too much means there's interest in your product, too little means they've giving up on your #custserv‚Äù
@ABHuret totally agree on cardinal sin #custserv
A5: if cust gives too little info I ask questions to clarify what cust experienced that needs change #custserv
A5: TMI easier to work with than too little. With too little more time spent deciphering what needs changes #custserv
So true ‚Äú@ABHuret: A3 When reasonable feedback given to a company is ignored, it screams "We don't care about you". #custserv"
A3: I take down any information and do go line by line to find actionable changes. Can be tedious but improves service #custserv
@CustServGreeter embarrassing yes but sometimes necessary #custserv
A2: I have some cust that give TMI but I don't TMI over too little and then ask more questions #custserv
@ABHuret hearing ugly is tough but needed #custserv
A1: customer feedback is important to know and understand expectations #custserv

@Carolyn_Bulsink what's that idea? Wait are we even friends/following each other on Facebook lol
@Carolyn_Bulsink that is true. It is still rare for those in entertainment industry to have two sided conversations. I think that is needed.
@Carolyn_Bulsink I like to make for what important to me. Sure in the TV/film industry may not talk specifics on projects but other things
@Carolyn_Bulsink true. But I do not want to be another that just has one sided conversations.
@Carolyn_Bulsink how can we not appreciate them. I take out as much time as I can to my fans. It doesn't feel like an obligation. Q
@Carolyn_Bulsink a few brag that they've known me ad such a success I will be lol
@Carolyn_Bulsink it is sweet. I've had a few from twitter call me on a regular basis, encourage me, advise me and mentor.
@Carolyn_Bulsink it's not the famous and glamor I think about either. I am not doing this for the fame
@Carolyn_Bulsink what about you?
@Carolyn_Bulsink I think the best thing I like is to set an example of what is possible. Many have dreams yet give up.
@Carolyn_Bulsink same here. And I want to give back as well. To motivate others
@Carolyn_Bulsink of course it is. Another source of motivation and enjoyment at once

@angels510 it is dependent per department for sure. I will never say it can work for anyone and everyone in the company
@angels510 why you want in with telecommuting
@dentaldiva1 I'm great. Enjoying life. I couldn't be happier
@angels510 that's what makes America great. The different ways of doing things
@dentaldiva1 you're welcome how've you been
@angels510 doesn't make it right or wrong just different
@angels510 that's why what works at one company doesn't translate to another. Each company is different just like families.
@angels510 it worked at Best Buy and other companies I have researched. It came down to the culture and training for it.
@angels510 it is dependent on the culture of the company.
@angels510 telecommuting can save thousands of dollars in not dealing with office politics and other concerns though

@MzBrendaL I try
@MzBrendaL sorry to hear that. That is how many years my parents have been married right now
@MzBrendaL might be unorthodox in this age but I kinda want to follow after my parents. They've been joyfully married for over 30 years
