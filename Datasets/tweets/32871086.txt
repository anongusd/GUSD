Cohen: "I am providing a copy of a $35K check that Pres. Trump personally signed from his personal bank account on Aug 1, 2017—when he was POTUS—pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me ... for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf."
Michael Cohen: "Mr. Trump is a conman. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets."
Michael Cohen: "A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. And the answer is yes."
Cohen on Trump Tower Moscow: "Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And ... because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress."
Michael Cohen: "To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars."
Michael Cohen: "I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false – our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign."
Michael Cohen: "I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. And he is a cheat."
Elijah Cummings says that because Michael Cohen's opening statement raises questions about Russia, Committee questions will not be restricted, meaning that the Committee can ask questions about Russia.
Elijah Cummings: "Ladies and gentlemen, the days of this Committee protecting the president at all costs are over. They're over.
Elijah Cummings: "The testimony that Michael Cohen will provide today, ladies and gentleman, is deeply disturbing and it should be troubling to all Americans ... Mr. Cohen's testimony raises grave questions about the legality of President Donald Trump's conduct."
Elijah Cummings on the reimbursement check Cohen submitted into evidence dated after Trump took office: "This new evidence raises a host of troubling legal and ethical concerns about the president's actions in the white house and before."
Elijah Cummings to Republicans: "You've made it clear that you do not want the American people to hear what Mr. Cohen has to say. But the American people have a right to hear him. So we're going to proceed.
Jackie Speier says on CNN that if Michael Cohen's claim about Trump and WikiLeaks is true, "that's [a] high crime and misdemeanor."

This turned into a Mueller Friday real fast.
Mueller: "Manafort repeatedly violated the law ... Manafort chose to do this for no other reason than greed ... The sentence in this case must take into account the gravity of this conduct, and serve to both specifically deter Manafort and those who would commit" similar crimes.
Mueller's Office: "Manafort's crimes were ... a result of his direct and willful conduct ... He simply chose not to comply with laws that would reduce his wealth ... In every scheme, Manafort was always the principal, and almost always the exclusive beneficiary."
Mueller: "Manafort's age does not eliminate the risk of recidivism ... particularly given that his pattern of criminal activity has occurred over more than a decade and that the most recent crimes he pled guilty to occurred from Feb. to Apr. '18 ... when he was under indictment."
Trump has arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, according to the pool report.		This is Trump's 223rd day at a Trump property as president.

George Conway has become one of the best Trump trolls on Twitter.
In Mueller's filings on both Manafort and Cohen, his office makes clear that Manafort and Cohen were in touch with administration officials and/or persons connected to the White House after Trump took office. Both, it seems, into 2018.
Man, this day is wilder than I ever imagined it could be.
New Mueller filing says that Manafort lied about contacts that he had with the Trump administration *this* year.		"Manafort said in February 2018 that Manafort had been in communication with a senior Administration official up through February 2018."
Interesting. Under the heading "Another DOj Investigation," Mueller's Manafort filing says that Manafort provided information about [REDACTED] that was "pertinent to an investigation in another district."
Mueller's says Manafort lied about:	* Interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik	* Kilimnik's participation in count two of superseding information	* A wire-transfer to a firm working for Manafort	* Info pertaining to another DOJ investigation	* Manafort's contact with admin officials
Mueller Manafort filing: "Manafort met with the Special Counsel's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation on twelve occasions ... On November 8, the government informed defense counsel that it believed that Manafort had lied in multiple ways and on multiple occasions."
In regards to Trump's tweet, SDNY prosecutors said that Trump, "Individual-1," directed and acted in coordination with Michael Cohen to make illegal campaign contributions.
New SDNY Cohen filing: "Taken alone, these are each serious crimes worthy of meaningful punishment. Taken together, these offenses reveal a man who knowingly sought to undermine core institutions of our democracy."
To review: Mueller's office says that the president's former personal lawyer had communications during the campaign with someone who claimed to be a "trusted person" in the Russian Federation who offered the Trump campaign "political synergy" and "synergy on a government level."
New Mueller Cohen filing: "Cohen provided relevant and useful information concerning his contacts with persons connected to the White House during the 2017–2018 time period."		"Relevant and useful information" going into Trump's time in the White House.
Mueller Cohen filing: "Cohen provided the SCO with useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigation that he obtained by virtue of his regular contact with Company executives during the campaign."
Must-read: Mueller's office lays out the Michael Cohen's "received the contact information for, and spoke with, a Russian national who claimed to be a 'trusted person' in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign 'political synergy' and 'synergy on a government level.'" https://t.co/hBYkt4IpvF
Mueller Cohen filing: "During his proffer sessions, the defendant admitted ... that he had in fact conferred with Individual 1 about contacting the Russian government before reaching out to gauge Russia’s interest in such a meeting. The meeting ultimately did not take place."

Mueller: Cohen's "crime was serious. He withheld information material to the investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election being conducted by the Senate Select Cmte. on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select Cmte. on Intelligence, and the SCO."
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Man who drove car into counterprotesters at white nationalist rally in Virginia convicted of first-degree murder.
SDNY on the campaign finance crimes: "Cohen coordinated his actions with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments." https://t.co/LJrXuBLPXh
New SDNY Cohen filing: "Cohen acted with the intent to influence the 2016 presidential election [by committing campaign finance crimes] ... Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1." [Trump]
SDNY filing: "Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged in or had knowledge."		Prosecutors say they won't offer a 5K filing or a notice of substantial cooperation and neither will Mueller.
SDNY Cohen filing: "The applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines ... range is 51 to 63 months' imprisonment ... the Office respectfully requests that this Court impose a substantial term of imprisonment, one that reflects a modest downward variance from the applicable Guidelines."
New SDNY Michael Cohen filing: "The crimes committed by Cohen were more serious than his submission allows and were marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life (and was evidently hidden from the friends and family members who wrote on his behalf)."
