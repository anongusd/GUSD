Responding to @PattyMurray, Dr. Julie Sanford states one third of nursing students come from diverse backgrounds and we have Title VIII supported pipeline BSN programs to increase the number of diverse nurses entering the workforce
Responding to @SenAlexander’s question on the geographic distribution of training, Dr Sanford explains @JMUNursing’s nurse practitioner students spend roughly 16 months of their education directly in clinical settings across Virginia
Responding to @SenatorHassan, Dr Julie Sanford explains that Title VIII programs allow for clinical rotations in various settings which expose students to opportunities they wouldn’t have considered, leading many to choose primary care practice
Responding to @timkaine: When programs are offered that allow students to stay in their communities, they often choose to stay in those underserved and educationally disadvantaged areas...These programs are reaching underserved areas -Dr Julie Sanford on #TitleVIII
“The Title VIII programs allow for flexibility and innovation to help address emerging public health crises, such as the #opioid epidemic” -Dr. Julie Sanford providing her oral testimony in front of Senate HELP
