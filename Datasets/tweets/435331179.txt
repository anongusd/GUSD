.@MoveOn mobilized their members and ran kickass GOTV efforts online in our district.  @DFAaction called voters and activated volunteers across the district. @BoldProgressive helped raise grassroots donations across the country!
They were joined by the @MEAOnline, Michigan's largest teacher's union, whose members and leadership had the courage to back someone they know will fight for public education, our kids, and our hard-working teachers when few others would. I'm going to make our families proud!
Thank you to @UFCW876, the first local union to believe in what's possible, and put resources behind it.  UFCW members canvassed the district all summer and worked polls every election day to deliver for the people!
There are so many organizations who fought alongside us to give the people of #MI13 a fighter in Congress, who put in the work at the grassroots to mobilize volunteers and donors and voters, who did the tough work of taking back our government, bit by bit.
.@justicedems were there at the outset of our campaign, and took a chance on us when few else would.  They put in the grassroots organizing work it takes to win.  A force to be reckoned with!  Thank you so much, and let's get to work! https://t.co/XEA0LtynAp
