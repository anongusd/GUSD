And FWIW, most operatives/activists in the early states that I‚Äôve talked to believe voters care a lot more about electability than this cycle than they have in the past.
But! There is still a big shift toward electability in this poll.		In July 2015, 79 percent wanted a candidate who shared their views on the issues, while only 20 percent wanted a candidate who could beat then then-unknown GOP candidate.
New NBC/WSJ poll finds, contra early Monmouth survey, that Democratic voters care more about finding a candidate who shares their views on the issues (56%) than one who can beat Donald Trump (40%). 		https://t.co/wePuJ5yixs https://t.co/FPRMehL8uY

Rep. Seth Moulton was the very image of a Democratic rising star.		But his willingness to buck Nancy Pelosi ‚Äì one of the things that helped his star rise ‚Äì is now leading to a fierce backlash.		My report from last night in Amesbury:		https://t.co/TbjwTjHHWt
As the town hall goes on, it‚Äôs pretty clear the crowd is fairly evenly divided between pro- and anti-Pelosi constituents. (There‚Äôs a bit of a gender divide.)		Moulton just explained that there‚Äôs no way McCarthy will become speaker, even if some Democrats vote against Pelosi.
Moulton says he is trying to persuade Marcia Fudge and ‚Äúothers‚Äù to run for speaker.
Moulton gets a big round of applause talking about his work on gun control. 		(Also, gun control seems to be the number one issue here. In most districts, healthcare is at the top of the list.)
Anti-Pelosi contingent at town hall speaking up: One man says Pelosi gives Trump an easy target, and a high school student says she wants leadership in Congress that understands the threat of school shootings.
Many of the pro-Pelosi contingent say Moulton is essentially acting like a Tea Party Republican.		‚ÄúThis sounds like Newt Gingrich,‚Äù one said.
2nd questioner goes right at it: Why aren‚Äôt you supporting Pelosi?		Moulton: ‚ÄúThe American people cried out for change‚Äù in the election. He says preserving a ‚Äústatus quo leadership team‚Äù would mean Democrats are ‚Äúfailing the American people.‚Äù
Many of the protesters were supporters of Moulton‚Äôs ‚Äî the organizer said she had knocked on over 1,000 doors on his behalf ‚Äî who are furious about his opposition to Pelosi. 		‚ÄúHe feels women are disposable, he feels elderly people are disposable,‚Äù one protester said.
I‚Äôm at @sethmoulton‚Äôs town hall in Amesbury, Mass. ‚Äî my hometown district! 		There‚Äôs a contingent of at least a dozen protesters here to confront him over his opposition to Nancy Pelosi.
