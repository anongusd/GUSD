@amitabhchandra2 @CitizenCohn @yeselson @ChrisMHerbst @SenWarren Same in Quebec, as you suggested. Low-cost, low quality can crowd out more-expensive, high quality. But that's true with public production or vouchers.
@amitabhchandra2 @CitizenCohn @yeselson @ChrisMHerbst @SenWarren Subsidy without quality assurance standards can hurt kids' development. Some parents may privilege convenience &amp; quantity over quality.
@amitabhchandra2 @CitizenCohn @yeselson @ChrisMHerbst @SenWarren The labels don't matter much. It's the $, quality assurance mechanisms (production, regulation, incentives, curriculum, competition, choice, information, monitoring...) &amp; ancillary requirements (labor supply, income...). Mixed income classes may be better than income segregated.
@amitabhchandra2 @CitizenCohn @yeselson @ChrisMHerbst @SenWarren CCDF has started putting more emphasis on quality. Time will tell.		MN started an Early Learning Scholarship program, with both tracks. Funding to parents &amp; funding to providers Not much evidence on effects yet.
@amitabhchandra2 @CitizenCohn @yeselson @ChrisMHerbst @SenWarren It's interesting. @ChrisMHerbst has studied CCDF, which is structured as you're advocating &amp; found negative effects on kids' development. Not necessarily bcz of that feature but not a silver bullet.		In contrast, many of best (&amp; some bad) effects from school-based programs.

For 4/5th of workers who are frontline, nominal wage growth ticks up to 3.4% over year from 3.3% last month (blue line). Consumer prices up 1.9% (red line).

If employer demand for labor rises faster than new workers enter to supply, price (wage) should rise. Nominal average hourly earnings growth hovered in 2.3-2.9% for abt 2.5 yrs. 		This month's estimate 3.2% growth over the year. Same as last month. Pause in modest acceleration.
Frontline workers (prod &amp; nonsupervisory) steady at 33.7 hrs = last 3 months. Was 33.6 hrs both 1 &amp; 2 yrs ago. 33.8 hrs 3 years ago. 		Manufacturing workweek ticked down 0.1 hr to 40.8 hrs, driven by 0.1 hour fall in OT to 3.5 hrs, reverses last month’s change. = 2 &amp; 3 yrs ago
That’s the extensive quantity (Q) margin. Intensive Q margin is average hours. 		Average workweek hours for private sector edges up to 34.5 hours. Was 34.4 hours both 1 &amp; 2 years ago, 34.6 hrs 3 years ago.
Labor force participation rate (LFPR) little changed at 63.2%, up 0.5pp over the year. Boomer retirements push it down 0.25-0.3 pp/yr. So this is better than it seems.		Employment-population ratio (EPOP) little changed at 60.7%, +0.38 pp/yr trend over 5 prior years to last month.
Unemployment rate edged up to 4.0%. 		Has fallen steadily for years. Maybe elevated from shutdown – some furloughed federal workers &amp; out-of-work employees of federal contractors could drive tick up here. https://t.co/KDR08lmYs2
Growth bump reflects in part temporary fiscal stimulus from borrowing to finance Dec 2017 tax law &amp; addt'l deficit spending.	 	Fiscal policy at all gov't levels added 0.6pp to 2018Q3 GDP growth. Highest 4Q average since 2010. But stimulus will fade.		https://t.co/GLcAmDO0MC https://t.co/GhhcbiNqed
Over the year, job growth is up some. Economy added 2.70 million jobs over last 12 months. Higher than 3 prior years, less than 12 months to Jan 2015. https://t.co/RUFp7DDI43
This month’s +304K &gt; estimate of job growth needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate given demog change ~= +80K. 		How does this compare to recent years?
HUGE again: +304K jobs gained last month (mid-Nov to mid-Dec). Continues longest streak of monthly job growth on record = 100 months! Job growth turned positive Oct 2010. 		Longest streak of private-sector job growth too, since Apr 2010.		But big downward revision to last month.
Analysis of other data show that the shutdown hurt federal agencies’ abilities to:		Retain staff @marthagimbel @indeed (left graph)	https://t.co/0TQwYvk1bz		Recruit staff @glassdoor (right)	https://t.co/BjBpmF5EA7		These harms will play out over time. https://t.co/FpCUrHqDHT
What impact did the shutdown have? 	It hurt broader economy more than White House believed when deciding on its strategy &amp; evident harms pushed them to reverse course. 	https://t.co/QIDQ9yKn7U	Though contractors lost pay, harms won’t show up much in today’s #JobsReport.
The # of jobseekers (red line) has fallen steadily &amp; the number of job openings risen (blue) for many years, tightening the market. We should see wage-growth acceleration. https://t.co/otpej48Dvp
Most important #JobsReport stat for families is wage growth. Measures how economic change affecting our earning power. Last month, average hourly earnings up 3.2% over year.

@rohangrey @SanjuktaMPaul @snaidunl @arindube @JWMason1 Can you please point me to something that describes how you're thinking about it?
@SanjuktaMPaul @rohangrey @snaidunl @arindube @JWMason1 JG is roughly UBI*(Work requirement). 		Job is what is "required." What are consequences for failing to fulfill requirement?  Do u lose income?
@arindube I absolutely agree on no single arrow. We need a portfolio.
@SanjuktaMPaul @snaidunl @arindube @JWMason1 So one could be paid more or less, down to the floor. Pay/tasks as incentives.
@arindube I agree with ur point, if it's single-wage. If it's not, then who gets paid what requires public rules or discretion. Basically public employment without ability to hire/fire, only to assign tasks. Seems we'd get lots of benefits without worst costs by expanded investment.
@arindube Expanding public sector investment in education, care, infrastructure, environmental remediation &amp; sustainability will all raise wages, earnings &amp; employment security for a broad set of workers. Complementary with any JG program.

@WesternBruce @DrShlafer @chrisuggen @tylerwinkelman @MichelleSPhelps I worked for the Carpenters Union for 5 years. I can definitely see how the hiring hall erases stigma directly. If the hall sends you to a job, you get work. No individual job applications. Also, easy integration into a fraternal community must have value. Makes good sense.

I'm excited to return to my PhD alma mater @NorthwesternU tomorrow to present our work on extracting cheap, accurate, reliable, &amp; fairer predictors of performance &amp; retention from applicant resumes @IPRatNU. 		Come if you can:	https://t.co/UJFsQ3bcxM
A wave of recent research has emerged from research-practitioner partnerships in:	Spokane (Goldhaber et al), 	DC (Jacob, Rockoff, Tyler...), 	LA (@KatharineStrunk @Paul__Bruno) &amp; 	Minneapolis (me @west_kristine Mykerezi) 	making progress on this important, difficult problem.
In 2014 Annual Review of Economics chapter, @KiraboJackson, Rockoff &amp; Staiger concluded that, "observable characteristics are unlikely to be able to predict most of the variation in teacher effects."	https://t.co/f8VAMvwbvM
Improving the reliability of pre-hire signals &amp; districts' ability to screen applicants can both improve student success &amp; reduce staff turnover.		This has proved hard.  Lots of evidence that teacher effectiveness matters long-term &amp; varies a lot but hard to predict pre-hire.
School districts hiring of K12 teachers is weak, little pre-hire ability to predict applicants' effectiveness &amp; persistence.  		We put hires in front of kids for a year or 3, then let go those who bomb. We learn on the backs of disadvantaged kids who don't get those years back.

White House will brag about 5 million of jobs added since election day. 		Some context: 5.01 million jobs added since Nov'16 election, over 25 months ending Dec’18.  Compare to number of jobs added over same period to Dec of prior years. Bit above 2017, down from '16, '15 &amp; '14. https://t.co/x5mWfcPxl0
Prime age (25-54 years old) labor force participation rate is an important measure of labor market strength that omits people on the fringes of work. Ticks up to 82.3% this month, following trend since late 2015. 		But remains well below level of 10 years ago &amp; longer back. https://t.co/904DUbAszu
Still millions of Americans out of work.	Long-term unemployment stable at 1.3 million, down 205K over year. 	Americans stuck in part time but prefer full time 4.7 million, down 329K over year.	Marginally attached 1.6 million, stable over year.
Bit of context: deceleration of price inflation driven largely by falling oil prices, due to softening demand as other economies slow. 		Our labor market continues strength but signs of headwinds mount on other fronts: tariffs, housing, fading #TCJA fiscal stimulus, yield curve…
For 82% of workers who are frontline, nominal wage growth ticked up to 3.3% over year, from 3.2% last 2 months (blue line). 		Til recently, price inflation (red line) accelerated faster &amp; real wage growth fell. Avg hour of work now buys abt 1.0% more than a year ago. https://t.co/llO1nHSYHA
If employer demand for labor rises faster than new workers enter to supply, price (wage) should rise. 		Private-sector nominal average hourly earnings growth 2.3-2.9% for abt 2.5 yrs. Last month: 3.1%. 		This month: *3.2%* growth over the year. Modest acceleration continues.
In manufacturing, workweek ticked up 0.1 hour to 40.9 hours, driven by 0.1 hour increase in overtime to 3.6 hrs. Compare to prior Decembers: 	2017: 40.7	2016: 40.7 	2015: 40.7 	2014: 41.0 	2013: 40.9	2012: 40.7
That’s the extensive quantity (Q) margin. Intensive Q margin is average hours		Average workweek hours for private sector ticked up 0.1 hr to 34.5 = a year ago. 34.6 2 yrs ago. 		Frontline (prod &amp; nonsupervisory) workers stable 33.7 hrs = last 2 months	Dec'17: 33.8	Dec'16: 33.6
Employment-population ratio (EPOP) stable, at 60.6%, stable for 3 months, up 0.4% over the year. Has had that same trend over 5 prior years to last month.
Labor force participation rate (LFPR) up to 63.1%. LFPR has been pretty flat; was 62.7% a year ago &amp; 2 years ago &amp; 3 years ago. Boomer retirements push LFPR down 0.25-0.3 pp/yr. So staying still is a kind of progress.
Unemployment rate UP 0.2% to 3.9%. Some rise from "good" sources: reentry, new entry, &amp; quits but also from layoffs. https://t.co/ozW6v0GQpB
Growth bump reflects in part temporary fiscal stimulus from borrowing to finance Dec 2017 tax law &amp; addt'l deficit spending. 		Fiscal policy at all gov't levels added 0.6pp to 2018Q3 GDP growth. Highest 4Q average since 2010. But #TCJA stimulus fading.	https://t.co/GLcAmDO0MC https://t.co/70UjxK5073
Over the year, job growth is up. Economy added 2.64 million jobs over last 12 months, i.e. in 2018, a pace of 220K per month. Higher than 2017 or 2016, below 2015 or 2014. https://t.co/mytCa92bFo

Nominal average hourly earnings growth (blue line) is mostly eaten up by modest, price inflation (red). 		Real wage growth (blue – red) up but still low.

White House brags about # of jobs added. 		Context: 4.20 million jobs added since administration start in Jan’17, over 22 months ending Nov’18. 		This is abt 4% less than over the same 22 months ending in Nov’17 &amp; 10% less than same ending Nov’16. https://t.co/LgKdrkKHxY

Fed may hike this month but this report not so strong, more space to hold off. 		Still slack. 	Long-term unemployment 1.3 million, down 100K over month.	Americans stuck in part time but prefer full time 4.8 million. 	Marginally attached 1.7 million, up 197K from a year ago.
Bit of context: deceleration of price inflation driven largely by falling oil prices, due to softening demand as other economies slow. 		Our labor market continues strength but signs of headwinds mount on other fronts: tariffs, housing, fading #TCJA fiscal stimulus, yield curve…
For 82% of workers who are frontline, nominal wage growth 3.2% over year=last month (blue line).		Til recently, price inflation (red line) accelerated faster &amp; real wage growth fell. 		Avg hour of work now buys abt 0.7% more than a year ago. 		Novs:	'17: 0.3%	'16: 0.9% 	'15: 2.0% https://t.co/0LSpC9utOL
If employer demand for labor rises faster than new workers enter to supply, price (wage) should rise. 		Nominal average hourly earnings growth hovered in 2.3-2.9% for abt 2.5 yrs. Last month: 3.1%. 		This month's estimate also 3.1% growth over the year. Modest acceleration holds
In manufacturing, workweek stable 40.8 hours, includes stable overtime at 3.5 hrs. Compare to prior Novembers:	2017: 40.9	2016: 40.6	2015: 40.7	2014: 41.1	2013: 41.0
That’s the extensive quantity (Q) margin. Intensive Q margin is average hours.		Average workweek hours for private sector ticked down 0.1 hr to 34.4 hours, down 0.1 from year ago. 		Frontline workers (prod &amp; nonsupervisory) stable at 33.7 hrs = last 2 months = Nov'17 = Nov'12
Employment-population ratio (EPOP) also stable, at 60.6%. 		Has had a +0.46% per year trend over 5 prior years to last month.
Labor force participation rate (LFPR) stable at 62.9%, overall LFPR has been pretty flat; was 62.7% a year ago &amp; 2 years ago &amp; about the same 3 or 4 years ago. Boomer retirements push LFPR down 0.25-0.3 pp/yr. So staying still is a kind of progress.
Unemployment rate stable at low level of 3.7%. Has fallen steadily for years. https://t.co/x80bLlvMFv
Growth bump reflects in part temporary fiscal stimulus from borrowing to pay for Dec 2017 tax law &amp; addt'l deficit spending. 		@BrookingsEcon: Fiscal policy at all gov't levels contributed 0.6 pp to GDP’s growth in 2018Q3. Sugar high fading.	https://t.co/GLcAmDO0MC https://t.co/p2nR8fbD34
Over the year, job growth is up. Economy added 2.44 million jobs over last 12 months. Higher than prior year, about same as 2 years ago &amp; down from the prior 2 years. https://t.co/tT0hu1m8u2
This month’s +155K &gt; estimate of job growth needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate given demog change ~= +80K. How does this compare to recent years?
+155K jobs gained last month (mid-Oct to mid-Nov). Continues longest streak of monthly job growth on record = 98 months! Job growth turned positive Oct 2010. Longest streak of private-sector job growth too, since Apr 2010.

Nominal average hourly earnings growth (blue line) is being eaten up by modest, 2.5% price inflation (red line) 		=&gt; real wage growth (blue – red) is low, under 1%, was much faster in 2015 &amp; 2016. https://t.co/Kg1wKTM3GV

@laseptiemewilay From Oct 11: "Brazilian producers are not only selling more grain, their soy is fetching $2.83 more per bushel than beans from the United States, up from a premium of just $0.60 a year ago, thanks to stepped up Chinese purchases."	https://t.co/ayCOvXEQSw
@Naziscansukit @TheRealMrJimmy @realDonaldTrump #FoolMeOnce
The administration said that it would distribute $3.6 billion to soybean farmers to offset the decline in market prices. The subsidy rate of 82.5 cents per bushel, however, covers less than half of the losses facing North Dakota farmers at current market prices.
Brandon Hokama, whose family farms 3,500 acres near Ellendale, N.D., estimates they need a price of $8.75 per bushel of soybeans to break even. Last year at this time, soybeans could be sold for almost $10 per bushel. Now, local elevators are offering prices below $7.
During the first 6 weeks of the current export year, which began in September, American soybean exports to China are down by about 6 million tons from last year, while soybean exports to the rest of the world are up by only 3 million tons.
"Greg Gebeke, who farms 5,000 acres outside Arthur, ND with 2 of his brothers, said he struggled to understand the administration’s goals. 		'I’m trying to... figure out who the winners are in this tariff war... I know who one of the losers are &amp; that’s us. And that’s painful.'"
"'I’ve been to China 25 times in the last decade talking about the dependability of U.S. soybeans,' said Kirk Leeds, the chief executive @IowaSoybeans. By undermining that reputation, he said, 'We have done long-term damage to the industry.'”

https://t.co/rKSBaQkvCw
First-order forces on labor market: steady continuation of progress since Great Recession.		Also, one real piece of economic policy change in last 2 years: Dec 2017 #TCJA tax law having 2 effects:	1. Debt-fueled, expensive fiscal stimulus,	2. huge bump to company owners' profits. https://t.co/txKgt5Fzgz
White House brags about # of jobs added.  With fiscal stimulus, growth continues.		This makes 4.05 million jobs added since Jan’17, over 21 months ending Oct’18. This is abt the same as than the 21 months ending in Oct’17 &amp; 10% less than same ending Oct’16. https://t.co/lsRWenm9oF
In sum, a strong report. The financial crisis &amp; Great Recession put us in a deep hole. We have steadily dug ourselves out since. 		Dec 2017 #TCJA added $1.5 trillion new debt &amp; created some expensive fiscal stimulus that is giving us a temporary bump.
Still slack in the labor market. 		Long-term unemployment little changed at 1.4 million, same as last month.		Americans stuck in part time jobs but would prefer full time, unchanged at 4.6 million. 		Marginally attached 1.5 million, same as a year ago.
For the 82% of workers who are frontline (production &amp; nonsupervisory), nominal wage growth was 3.2% over the year. That shows acceleration from 2.7% last month (blue line). 		Better than before but an hour of work still buys less than 1% more now than a year ago. https://t.co/V9tAALKHtl
Wage growth (blue line) of 3.1% over the year eroded by consumer price inflation (2.3%), yields real wage growth (blue-red) of less than 1.0%. Below rates in 2015 &amp; 2016. https://t.co/OGavOlP9i0
As labor demand starts to exceed supply, price (wage) should rise. Nominal average hourly earnings growth hovered in 2.3-2.9% for about 2.5 years, since Oct’15. Last month: 2.8%. 		This month's estimate up to 3.1% growth over the year. In line with estimates from other sources.
In manufacturing, workweek edged down 0.1 hr to 40.8 hours. Was 40.9 a year ago (Oct 2017), 40.7 hours in Oct 2016 &amp; in Oct 2015 &amp; 41.0 in Oct 2014. Includes stable overtime at 3.5 hrs/wk.
That’s the extensive quantity (Q) margin. The intensive Q margin is average hours.		Average workweek hours for private sector ticked up 0.1 hr to 34.5, same as a year ago. For frontline workers (production &amp; nonsupervisory) stable at 33.7 hrs, same as last month &amp; even Sept '12.
Employment-population ratio (EPOP) up 0.2% to 60.6%. Was 60.4% last month &amp; 12 months before that. +0.4%/yr trend from 3 prior years to Sept.
Labor force participation rate (LFPR) up 0.2%, at 62.9%, similar for years. Overall LFPR was 62.7% a year ago, 62.8% 2 years ago, &amp; about the same 3 or 4 years ago. 		Boomer retirements push LFPR down 0.25-0.3 pp/yr. So staying still is a kind of progress.
Unemployment rate stable at low level of 3.7%. Has fallen steadily for years. No change this month. https://t.co/FIO2DS1xV7
Growth bump reflects in part temporary, fiscal stimulus from borrowing to pay for Dec 2017 tax law &amp; addt'l deficit spending. 		@BrookingsEcon: Fiscal policy at all gov't levels contributed 0.73 pp to 2018Q3 GDP growth, most in 8 yrs, since 2008Q3.	https://t.co/GLcAmDO0MC https://t.co/fU9MB5S5Dj
Over the year, job growth is up. Economy added 2.52 million jobs over last 12 months. Higher than most-recent 2 years. Down from 2 before. https://t.co/Y4HQ6Pt70s
This month’s +250K is a strong # &gt;&gt; estimate of job growth needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate given demog change ~= +80K. How does this compare to recent years?
+250K jobs gained last month (mid-Sept to mid-Oct).		Continues longest streak of monthly job growth on record = 97 months! Job growth turned positive Oct 2010. Longest streak of private-sector job growth too, since Apr 2010. Revisions net 0.
Excellent point from @PatcohenNYT on wage growth: "The year-over-year change will jump partly because there was an unusual drop in wages in October last year after Hurricane Harvey."	https://t.co/1gsqYo0omC
The Employment Situation report will be here	https://t.co/Oz3AfwJveJ
Nominal average hourly earnings growth (blue line) is being eaten up by modest, 2.3% price inflation (red line).		So real wage growth (blue – red) is low = 0.5%.		Real wage growth was faster in 2015 &amp; 2016, thanks to lower price growth. https://t.co/iyZrcGmMSs
Most important #JobsReport stat for families is wage growth. Measures how economic change affecting our earning power. 		Last month, average hourly earnings up 2.8% over year. We should see acceleration but have seen just a little.
