Is she right? Of course. Is the best use of her time in questioning a witness who could hold valuable information in the most important criminal investigation ever to say something she already knows to be true (repeatedly)? Not unless it's all for show.
When examining a witness in court, you don't get to comment, to lead, or pontificate. There's a time for all of those things elsewhere. You question them and get evidence. Why don't we expect congress to actually use their powers? Why do we just accept that it's all a campaign?

@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud If everyone in the world could agree what is and is not racist, just as we agree what is and is not green or what is and is not mettalic, then I'd be fine with NBC using that language. We can't, I'm not, and I'm glad they're making an effort to remain objective.
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud I think white supremacy is racist. I don't think the news can objectively label it as such. I think Steve King is a racist. I don't think the news can *objectively* label him as such. There are many truths too nuanced to be expressed entirely objectively.
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud News ought to be the stenographer of reality, not the judge or jury, and certainly not the attorneys.
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud That's not true for the simple fact that there is no universally agreed upon definition of racism, and any dictionary definition falls short of capturing its entire scope. It isn't the place of the news media to define it, it's the place of pundits, observers, and editorializers
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud I don't think the news should characterize any of those things what way. "Officials warn conditions are dangerous"; "a speech many are describing as furious"; or "near freezing weather" are all objective ways to say the same things.
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud Wikipedia's rules do a really good job of using objective language to accurately convey points. No need to call Hitler evil, just say he was central to the Holocaust. The reader can determine he was evil all on their lonesome https://t.co/Dsd0NRBz3b
@ItsAndyRyan @Zigmanfreud By news media? None. They can all be described as universally regarded as racist, their quotes and their horrific impact can be described matter of factly without opinionated adjectives, but the news does not get to have opinions of its own. Once it does, it's no longer the news
@Zigmanfreud My point is that the reason detached, matter of fact prose is called "journalistic" is because journalism ought to be detached and matter of fact. Activism is its own thing, and should draw on journalistic sources, but the two shouldn't be conflated.
RT @thehill: Florida official attacks Muslim lawmaker, claims she could "become a martyr and blow up Capitol Hill" https://t.co/0yLAkOswll…

pretending like it was the same kinda thing as Iraq or Vietnam just to be contrarian is ridiculous. The action saved millions of innocent lives from a ruthless, genocidal dictator.
Also, it wasn't a solely American action. We took the lead and the brunt of the fighting, but there was a *35 nation* coalition authorized by unanimous vote of the UN Security Council.
Iraq was raping and murdering the civilians of Kuwait after having invaded them and destroyed their only reliable source of drinkable fucking water. The US kicked the shit out of them with minimal loss and next to nil collateral damage, and didn't even have to invade to do it

Works for me https://t.co/kD0DdP51G3
Don't buy things unless there is no better use of that money at that time. A snickers bar a day for a month could have bought a ribeye at a nice steakhouse. Which would you rather have?
Be polite to *everybody* you talk to, unless they are truly acting with unambiguous malice. If you treat people well, you will be treated better. Win favor with everyone, and be grateful and compassionate.
Use "do not disturb" aggressively on your phone. Set it so that true emergency notifications will go through, and use it whenever you're doing something important or getting ready to sleep.
Walk or bike to nearby destinations if safe and practical. Free cardio, saves money, saves the planet, gives you a few minutes to yourself in peace.
Plan your grocery trips. Don't buy unnecessary garbage.
Keep your hair in check, it sounds awfully specific, but if you're procrastinating your haircut, you're probably procrastinating something more important too.
That said, most people do not, and most cases of *mild* depression or anxiety can be dealt with with improved lifestyle (emphasis on mild). Even so, regular therapy is profoundly helpful for a great many healthy people, just to vent and organize their thoughts with someone
If you have mental health problems that are insurmountable through willpower alone, or the watered down version of CBT that you can perform on yourself at home, seek professional help. Meditation will do fuck all if you wake up screaming every night.
Stop bitching. When it hurts, just do it, then applaud yourself for being able to. Take pride in getting through things that suck, and you'll begin to love the suck.
Don't keep games on your phone. When you're really bored, get on Wikipedia and let your curiosity wander. You only have so much time in your life, absent mindedly tapping for hours is a regrettable use of it.
Keep your email inbox clean. Clean fox is a great app to help with this. Email can be a great productivity tool, provided it's usable and not just junk.
Keep things in specific places. Iron and hang your clothes for the next day the night before. Keep your keys, wallet, and other EDC in one place, ready to go.
Clean as you go. Don't leave your personal space dirty, wash dishes as you use them, take out the trash as it fills. Every time you notice something needing to be done, do it immediately. That way it won't pile up. Do it now.
Caffeine is healthy for mind and body, and enjoying good coffee is a wonderful thing. Just don't use it as a band-aid for your shitty lifestyle.
Break your reliance on caffeine. Use it sparingly to push past days where you couldn't get enough sleep, or to prepare for specific challenges. If you *need* your morning coffee, you need to skip your morning coffee for a few weeks. Make your own energy.
Set a routine for personal hygiene, day and night. Structuring your morning and night routines around these activities helps to fit more good stuff in on a daily basis. If you always brush your teeth before bed, you can also always meditate before bed.
Don't bother with useless people. Someone who does nothing but annoy you is quite literally not worth your time. Be polite, be kind, but you don't owe anybody your company. Only deal with relationships where the benefits and interest are mutual, if socially acceptable
Get a very comfortable bed and sleep hard. What I mean is, get very tired every day, maintain good sleep hygiene, and your sleep will likely become deeper and more rewarding, meaning you'll need less. Most people can thrive on 6-7 hours, some on even fewer.
Energy should never be nervous. When you're doing a million things at once you should appear smooth and controlled, not jerky and confused. If you're the latter, take a second and get into the right state of mind. It will save you time in the long run.
whenever you are overwhelmed, stop, count to 3, breathe in and out once, list your problems, organize them in order of importance, and begin. This is easier said than done, but master this and people will be stunned at your capacity to "multitask".
In addition to meditation, brain games for memory, focus, reaction speed, calculation, etc. are a whole lotta fun. I suggest learning advanced mental math. Doing a few 6 digit by 6 digit multiplication problems without pen or paper is sure to keep your brain steaming
Stay hydrated and eat tons of fruits and veggies. Again, you will notice far more energy and focus in doing so.
Exercise daily. The benefits for energy and cognition cannot be overstated.
Learn to love learning. Watching lectures or listening to informative podcasts or reading nonfiction (or enriching fiction, though there's not enough of that) can be just as entertaining as the latest superhero movie and a lot more productive
Every time you have a few minutes, meditate. I suggest doing a longer, guided meditation course like headspace at least once a day, but taking 2 or 3 minutes to focus on scanning your body or controlling your breath whenever you have nothing else to do
Top productivity tips:	Wake up at the same time every day, as early as reasonably possible. If you work day shifts like a normal person, wake up as early as a farmer or a fisherman.

#fitness https://t.co/xYFULzIfr3
That does not matter to you. You are not Phil Heath. Train well, train hard, eat well, drink plenty of water, and sleep enough. You will get outstanding results for at least a year. You will not need to concern yourself with little things to progress until you are far fitter.
Beginners also have a tendency to get wrapped up in minutiae. "I read that getting in the hot tub after a workout improves muscle growth". Yes, some research indicates that heat exposure post workout may very slightly increase hypertrophy.
@publicroad The French Laundry Cookbook.	White Heat.	Modernist Cuisine.	Alinea.	The Eleven Madison Park Cookbook.		Wait, you said weeknight? Um... how to cook everything by Bittman comes to mind
Again, you absolutely do not need supplements. This is Eugen Sandow, picture taken in 1901. He built this body with sand loaded barbells and dumbells, odd loads of various types (kegs, sandbags, etc.) calisthenics, and hard goddamn work. No personal trainer, no supplements. https://t.co/l6Q1MUn82J
And you'll notice I didn't touch on supplements. Why? The ones that work do so only very slightly; the huge majority do not work. Here's a guide: also check out @Examinecom https://t.co/t1eCYay0VR
All in all, don't feel like lack of money is an obstacle to fitness. You can get ripped to shreds alone in a jail cell. There are a lot of great fitness products, but you don't *need* them, especially not starting out.
A heart rate monitor, or tracker of some kind that keeps watch of that, is great even for a beginner, but you can do plenty without it.
Olympic weightlifting shoes are a blessing for advanced lifters, but you don't need romaleos 3s to squat 95 pounds.
Some good shoes and comfy, secure clothes are very important. Get well fitting running or minimalist training shoes (or both) depending on your goals. You don't need expensive workout clothes though. Sweat shorts and a plain white t work fine.
You can get incredible results with nothing but some open space and a pullup bar (even a makeshift one). Especially as a beginner. A gym membership can be great, but if you struggle to afford it, drop it and buy better food instead.
Biggest beginner fitness tip:	Save money. You should pay for good food first and foremost. High quality fresh fruits, veggies, grains, and protein sources should be the majority of your fitness budget. Next is a gym membership, but it isn't strictly necessary

The economy matters to people. It isn't just an abstract concept for Wall Street investors and political wonks. The strength of your country's economy is probably directly correlated with your quality of life, unless you're an outlier to either the top or bottom.
A 10% loss of economy creates dead people even without extreme weather events. Money=food, water, healthcare, housing, emergency services, sanitation, etc. https://t.co/PEiHbsWVJ5

@AlterJonathan 11 on 27 is a very solid tip. This post is aimed at people who pull out their phones, calculate 15 percent, and leave exactly that every time.
@brooklynmarie Well thank you so much, that's very nice of you to say
@AlterJonathan False, Jews can't eat shellfish. Lobster is yummy. Praise jebus
I default to 30 and go up to 50 or more for outstanding service. I go down to 20 if they do only the bare minimum. I'd only consider tipping less than 20 if they messed up out of obvious apathy or were rude.
Tipping scale:	20% is minimum, anything less is tantamount to a complaint. 25% is a nice complement. 30% is like saying "wonderful job, thank you so much!". Over 30 and you're being extravagantly generous. You'll make your server very happy, and they'll feel recognized and proud.

@AlterJonathan The core of the big fires right now definitely does as well, though it's hard to say what damage is being caused by the core firestorm and what is being caused by spot fires and outlying parts of the blaze, which humans are more likely to encounter
@AlterJonathan Any time a firestorm gets strong enough to heat to several thousand degrees and pull in air at 100+ miles per hour, total skeletal cremation is entirely feasible. Peshtigo, black Saturday, cloquet, thumb, hinckley all fit this bill and many others.
@AlterJonathan Well most of the time a fire gets hot enough to burn a skeleton it leaves a rather large and messy scene so the photos aren't nearly so illustrative. Also, I'd argue lightning is closer, but that may be because I worship Zeus
@AlterJonathan A lot of victims in the Tokyo firebombings, hamburg bombings, dresden bombings, Hiroshima and Nagasaki comings, and the great wildfires like the peshtigo fire suffered a similar fate, their skeletons being completely eradicated.
@AlterJonathan Not necessarily, everything either burns or melts when it gets hot enough (or ionizes into plasma or... you get my point). Mary Reeser is a good example. You can find the scene photos with a quick Google search, she burned utterly and completely save for her foot. https://t.co/oRrlJsEsnm

You think your job is hard? Jump out of a plane with 100 pounds of kit and then cut 15 miles of hand line to stop a raging wildfire with a Pulaski then hump 25 miles to the nearest road for extraction.
The primary tool used to fight wildfires is the Pulaski. A sort of axe-mattock thingy. When you hear about wildland firefighters working 48 hours straight, they're mostly doing that cutting trees and brush with these and chainsaws and dragging them away by hand. https://t.co/j9lslvSBTc
Shovel? Very close, not quite though.

Humanity is so tiny that a multiversal nigh omnipotent being like beyonder being challenged by humanity's strongest is utterly ridiculous beyond what I can describe
I like a comic character like batman. Absurdly strong, but rooted in reality. It's impossible to make incomprehensibly mighty deities interesting in the context of a threat to humanity
I mean, Franklin Richards could eliminate existence by wishing it, but he's idle for other comics, and just...
The writers can't decide if a being is omnipotent or if it can be taken out by a strong dude. The universe got so ridiculously over saturated with cosmicly mighty beings that none of it makes any logical sense in universe
Iron man, a guy in a strong metal suit with laser beams and missiles, isn't shown to be truly dramatically less powerful than Thor, a literal god, and captain marvel is supposedly greater than either, but molecule man is a multiversal entity that can also be beaten by punching
A universe is a drop in the ocean to him. Really strong fast dude can kill him tho. Makes absolutely no sense
But galactus could be destroyed in a blink by beyonder; however, beyonder stated that puma could kill him, even though puma is a rival to spider man, and Spiderman could be destroyed in a snap by thanos, despite this, beyonder apparently is so powerful that
Marvel power scaling makes no sense. Jean Grey can destroy humanity with a blink, but wolverine can kill her, and captain America is just an extremely fit man but he can stand up to infinity gauntlet thanos, who could stand a chance against galactus

The exception to that is if we're joking about Hitler's possible monorchidism because that's hilarious
I mean, I firmly believe no humor is off limits, but the humor here was part of a legitimate sentiment of political attack. It wasn't "we love you Dan, let's joke about you in good fun". It was mean spirited. And mean spirited jokes shouldn't target war wounds

Carfentanil (in addition to remifentanil, a surgical anesthetic) was infamously used by Russian special forces in the Moscow Theater Hostage Crisis as a knockout gas. Because collateral damage doesn't matter to Mother Russia, 125 civilians died of overdose.
Etorphine in particular is fun. Veterinarians and wildlife rangers who use it are required to have a dose of Narcan ready before they unpackage it, as even accidental transdermal exposure from a broken vial or leaky dart could kill them in minutes.
As far as wild veterinary drugs, check out R-30490, Thiafentanil, Carfentanil, Ohmefentanyl, and Etorphine. These drugs are essentially impossible to dose in small enough amounts to relieve human pain without causing death, but they're useful for things a lot bigger than us
Sufentanil. Remember scary Mr. Fentanyl, the one that was 50 times as potent as morphine? Sufentanil is 500 times as potent as morphine. Outside of veterinary drugs literally used on elephants and rhinoceroses, it's as potent as opiods come. Now avaliable orally. https://t.co/h91qnQAsfi
