@marshallsheldon Tiger had to clear those trees to get on the green, probably threw the ball damn near straight up to do it.

@marshallsheldon there's an old story of Byron Nelson telling a young pro how they used to cut the corner on 13‚Ä¶

@marshallsheldon and they just keep falling by the wayside making his path clearer. #FreeBallWashForFowler #Masters
@marshallsheldon He's grinding it out, he'll probably post -5 and be happy to have not lost ground.
@marshallsheldon Senden giving up position. @JasonSobelGC
@marshallsheldon I think it's still in his head, being short of the green on 16 is not like him at all.
@marshallsheldon that was two shots for sure, he'd be at -6
@marshallsheldon I like that shirt he's wearing today, not that I'd give Nike $50 for it, but it's nice.
@marshallsheldon I've seen it but not into the water. He's lucky it's not Sunday afternoon.
@marshallsheldon He can still make a bogey. 15 is cruel today.
@marshallsheldon That's such a bad break. #Masters
@marshallsheldon I told you I saw ripples in the water, I just haven't seen him slam his club &amp; curse yet. #Masters

Leishmann showed skill from the bunker, but Tiger's next shot is even harder. #Masters
If #Gosnell had killed white babies and a white woman would the media be silent? What about if he was white? MSM Silent Mystery Series.
@marshallsheldon I'll put a small wager on the dark horse, the smoking man, past champ Cabrera who closed Birdie, Birdie, Par, Birdie to -4
@marshallsheldon OT
@marshallsheldon Tiger is about to hit Amen Corner, he's on 10
@marshallsheldon LOL
@marshallsheldon Woods, Couples, Leishmann are the Leaders.
@marshallsheldon They have an 'Extra Strength' one now, what's that 5 1/2 Hour energy?
@marshallsheldon All you miss is them telling you what you just saw if you were watching. Oh, I thought Westwood was behind Furyk, he's w/em
@marshallsheldon Westwood is in the fairway watching Furyk fold. 15 got Johnson too. Tough little easy hole. #Masters
@marshallsheldon Wait, so you're watching at work? LOL. #Productivity #Masters
@marshallsheldon I just decided to wait on the haircut &amp; go to the corner restaurant with ESPN running.
@marshallsheldon Fluff is thinking 'I won this thing with a Kid for goodness sake!' #Masters
@marshallsheldon maybe the haircut can wait until tomorrow...
@marshallsheldon Furyk making sure he won't be wearing Green on Sunday. #Masters
@marshallsheldon Yeah, I'm screwed. I need to go get a haircut &amp; lunch  so I'm gonna miss him going thru.
@marshallsheldon It's like Westwood, make your 1st birdie on 14, then drive it in the trees on one of the easiest holes on the course
@marshallsheldon Plus he get's the intimidation/fear factor that gives him a stroke advantage on the field down the stretch.
@marshallsheldon I want to know why he's not in a 'Featured Group' right now. #Masters
@marshallsheldon Oh, my bad, I hadn't looked at the Leaderboard. Let's see where he finishes then I'll disparage your GOATs Milk Dreams ;-)
@marshallsheldon -15 for the weekend? You're on GOATs milk.

@SuperAndrea Oh, there are. and there are reformed man whores as well.
@SuperAndrea Unfortunately everyone isn't smart from the start like that. We think we know better than God.
@SuperAndrea so is his wife since they had both saved themselves for marriage.
@SuperAndrea Oh, no, I mean the other players &amp; some people did though.
@SuperAndrea the only man known to have completely rejected the women was AC Green and he was laughed at &amp; called a fag for it.
@SuperAndrea If you've never seen what it looks like at the end of any pro game w/the women especially at the hotel it's not all on the men
@SuperAndrea that's the only plausible reason, I mean you know he was/may still be hooking up w/women in every city.
@SuperAndrea maybe she did it 'for the kids'

@MichelleInCAL Apparently she's going to be in a new movie with Sandra Bullock [swoon] so I may see her in something soon.
@MichelleInCAL That may be for the best at this point unfortunately, they'll beat the Dodgers at some crucial point though. @themick1962
@MichelleInCAL If you like her you should watch, they're using her a lot, she's got some chops.
@MichelleInCAL I never saw Bridesmaids , I'm sort of pop culture-deprived by choice.

@Loricatus_Lupus if by 'lean' you mean malnourished, yes.
Oh, you poor thing. Maybe I'll send you a pic. RT @SJoy29: @pcam they were two intense games for sure. What exactly is zankou chicken?
@Loricatus_Lupus I'm pretty sure those aren't international chickens
Tonight was Max. College Basketball Exposure for me, as always #FinalFour so now I will reward myself with Zankou Chicken, I've earned that.

Therefore, 'I know how you feel' is complete b.s. And 'I can't possibly know how you feel' just seems woefully trite.
Thankfully, an infinitesimal percentage.
What percentage of fathers on the planet in history have experienced something like that?
You just sit with them, because, what are you going to say?
The Jews have a tradition of Sitting Shiva with someone when they experience the death of a loved one. Sometimes that's as good as it gets‚Ä¶
I can't even imagine what that must be like; to experience that high and that abysmal low within such a short period of time.
I gave as good as I got during the back &amp; forth so I never took anything too personal.
I don't know if the mutual friend knows what happened yet, but I believe he may. I have to find out what he's going to do now.
A mutual friend and he really got into it &amp; he took the personal attacks too far with him &amp; the mutual friend said he couldn't forgive him.
It's all so fleeting, isn't it?
I just found out today. I don't even know how to start to try to be there for him. We remained friends through the election b.s.
One of the guys I argued with most often during the last campaign welcomed a new baby &amp; had his oldest son commit suicide last week
RT @Beregond: History Channel's adaptation of The Bible is starting. Once upon a time in the US you wouldn't have had to worry about twe ...
That one either.
Don't reach for that note, you don't have it in you.
Fighting with O-bots on Twitter is so 2008-12. Their ignorance is their bliss. Crush them at the ballot box &amp; leave them to flounder here
People will spend millions to stick their collective fingers in the eye of the PC Culture &amp; laugh their asses off at the 'Inappropriate'.
Just saw a Trailer for 'Inappropriate Comedy' a new movie that appears to live up to its title. If it does I predict a Box Office Hit.
@gscottoliver No, I looked. So do you like Storify? I haven't joined it.
@rawhide071 Boy, talk about MSM covering for a guy, if he got that through the nets, wow.
@gscottoliver Uh oh.
@kesgardner I know that what the Russian people suffered in WWII was part of it as well. Still, it's a massive blind spot, especially w/ Mao
@rawhide071 I haven't seen Obama state admiration for Mao anywhere. He's too smart for that, Anita Dunn wasn't. But if I'm wrong send a link
@MalcolmMcColl Anita Dunn openly spoke of her admiration for Mao &amp; served in the Obama Admin. Pretty sure that wouldn' t happen with Hitler.
@MalcolmMcColl Where do Stalin &amp; Mao receive the same treatment as Hitler? I'm in no way arguing that he's being treated wrongly, they are.
@CaliCowboy Yep
@kesgardner but the historical treatment of Hitler is much more harsh than that of Stalin or Mao. All were indeed evil incarnate.
Mao reportedly said One Death is a Tragedy, One Million Deaths is a Statistic. Just the kind of psychopath you want in charge.
Mao &amp; Stalin killed so many of their own people that the numbers are only estimates.
Mao starved &amp; murdered as many as 70 Million of his own countrymen &amp; Our Current POTUS had a close confidante who applauded Mao.
Stalin starved &amp; murdered 40-60 Million Russians &amp; others and in general is only mildly rebuked if at all.
And yet the Nazis killed 17 Million and are reviled.
Yeah, they could. They did. They are. They will be again.
Socialists could be that violent and unhinged in pursuit of their Utopia on Earth?
But that's too tough to swallow.
