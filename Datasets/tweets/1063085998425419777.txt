Most debates are between a few people but what if we could watch a debate between a few databases? That's what we're planning for The Great American Debate but we need your help! Should our #tech debate #climatechange or #immigration? RT your choice! https://t.co/TSlaHJAzAE

Determining whats #fact and what's fiction in the #internet age can be pretty mind-boggling.  In the near future (stay-tuned!), #artificialintelligence and #dataanalytics will be able to un-boggle our minds!  Join The Great American #Debate to see a how! https://t.co/3TdFpeFQOD

@realfairemoon4 - will you retweet? 	A public debate about #TheWall is needed	https://t.co/jHPOmFsHiO
@tamathamachi13 One of the reasons "the Wall" debate is so unclear is that everyone has their own set of facts. We need to have a conversation as a nation, and put all ideas (to be scrutinized) on the table. Consider funding that effort: https://t.co/jHPOmFsHiO #TheWall
@salis333 @fairymoon4 @CBSThisMorning If you think its time to #BuildTheWall, you may be interested in supporting this initiative - this non-profit is mapping pro and con arguments for and against the wall. If this gets funded, the nation will be able to sort fact from fiction: https://t.co/jHPOmFsHiO
No matter how deep the divide, debating is the way we reach solutions and ensure freedom.
