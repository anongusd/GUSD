It doesn‚Äôt work that way in America. We are not ruled by unelected bureaucrats, police forces, or intelligence agencies. In America, We The People ELECT officials who govern.
18) And why would @SenSchumer, leader of the Democrat party, publicly warn President-elect Trump on Jan. 3, 2017 that when you mess with the ‚Äúintelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you?‚Äù
17) Why won‚Äôt the FBI give Congress the documents it‚Äôs requesting?
16) Why was FBI General Counsel Jim Baker reassigned two weeks ago? Was he the source for the first story on the dossier by David Corn on October 31, 2016? Or was it someone else at the FBI?
15) Why did Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson meet with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya before and after her meeting with Donald Trump Jr.?
14) The New York Times reported last week that George Popadopoulos‚Äô loose lips were a catalyst for launching the Russia investigation. Was President-elect Trump briefed on this?
13) Was the briefing done to ‚Äúlegitimize‚Äù the dossier? And who leaked the fact that the briefing was about the dossier?
12) Why did the intelligence community wait two months after the election to brief President-elect Trump on the dossier (January 6, 2017)? Why was James Comey selected to do the briefing?
11) Why did Lisa Page leave Mueller probe two weeks before Peter Strzok? This was two weeks before FBI and Special Counsel even knew about the texts.
10) And why did FBI release only 375/10,000+ texts? Were they the best? Worst? Or part of a broader strategy to focus attention away from something else? And when can Americans see the other 96% of texts?
9) Why did the FBI release text messages between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page? Normally, ongoing investigation is reason not to make such information public.
8) When and how did the FBI learn that DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr‚Äôs wife, Nellie Orr, worked for Fusion GPS? And what exactly was Nellie Orr‚Äôs role in putting together the dossier?
7) Why did DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr meet with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson after the election? To get their story straight after their candidate Clinton lost? Or to double down and plan how they were going to go after President-elect Trump?
6) Why and how often did DOJ lawyer Bruce Orr meet with dossier author Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign?
5) Did Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, or Bruce Orr work on the FISA application?
4) Did the FBI validate and corroborate the dossier?
3) When did the FBI get the complete dossier and who gave it to them?		Dossier author Christopher Steele? 	Fusion GPS?	Clinton campaign/DNC?	Sen. McCain‚Äôs staffer?
2) Was the dossier the basis for securing FISA warrants to spy on Americans? And why won‚Äôt the FBI show Congress the FISA application?
1) Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele, author of the dossier?
18 questions in 2018 about Russia and the FBI. The American people deserve answers...

Joined @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews last night to talk about yesterday's failed vote to impeach #IRS commissioner: https://t.co/z10kiMm7g7
Koskinen has gotten away w/ stonewalling Congress, obstructing justice, breaching public trust. It‚Äôs time Congress held him accountable.
Under his watch, w/ subpoenas/preservation orders in place, John Koskinen allowed 422 back-up tapes, 24,000 Lois Lerner emails 2 b destroyed
The right 2 pursue impeachment is an indispensable power that Congress has 4 holding government officials accountable 2 the American people
