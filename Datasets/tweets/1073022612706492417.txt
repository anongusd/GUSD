@GabsNGripes I completely agree. Political positions are very entrenched and often causes people to act horribly towards anyone proposing change.		I’m hoping the “Independent” label will at least challenge voters to consider an alternative position, and reflect on partisan loyalty to start.
@GabsNGripes 3/3		More mention*		Exatly! I am trying to start early. Making any dent, or gathering any attention will be difficult without great volunteers like yourself. When it gets closer to the election I hope there is an Independent candidate in #23 you would encourage voting for. 🙂
@GabsNGripes https://t.co/dsuPJtRbtn		The funding difference was insane. The Democratic Party as a whole didn’t place any priority in 23 and I saw mention of Janz in 22 which is also a tough district. A progressive candidate running independent might encourage some more attention. 2/
@GabsNGripes You’re welcome! I love honest political conversations. I appreciate your time, thank you!		You’re right, #CA23 is strongly red and the majority of people vote only Republican. I say there was a Dem failure on the part of the entire Party, not to blame local Dems alone. 1/

@GabsNGripes Basically, I believe voters can be convinced to send an Independent candidate rather than another Republican. Democrats made very little effort here, there was no national attention on this race, and they have a very hard time opening up conversations on politics. 2/2
