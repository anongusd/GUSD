Here’s where the candidates for @kcpublicschools stand on @MayorSlyJames’ pre-K sales tax, which the current board &amp; @MarkBedell_KCPS are opposing. https://t.co/YNJhOmFE87
@Sam_Hartle @kcpublicschools I took a nap!		(And, er, sorry about the public coughing fit?)
RT @Sam_Hartle: @ellemoxley @kcpublicschools Wait, weren’t you doing news cut-ins this morning? And now live-tweeting a school board meetin…
And, to reiterate, @OatesForKCPS, @MansurPl &amp; Jennifer Wolfsie are already on the record opposing mayor’s pre-K sales tax as members of the current board. 		That’s a wrap for tonight, folks. 29/29
Wasserstrom, sub-district 5: I support Sly James. I’m a tax and spend Democrat. I don’t care where the money comes from. Spend it something good like education before they spend it on something worthless like the wall down in Texas. 28/
Jensen Adams, sub-district 5: my son’s diagnosis is better because he had pre-K. I want every child to have that resiliency. 27/
Rochester, write-in, sub-district 4, opposes pre-K sales tax because the district already loses $35 million to tax incentives. 26/
Jones, write-in, sub-district 4, opposes mayor’s pre-K sales tax due to equity issues 25/
Ramsey, write-in, sub-district 4: “I support pre-K” (but wouldn’t say if he opposes mayor’s plan, even when prompted by other candidates, chiefly Clinton Adams) 24/
Adams, write-in, sub-district 4: I don’t want the people who can’t fix the potholes to educate my kids. It’s a burdensome sales tax. 23/
Abarca, sub-district 3, unopposed: firmly opposed because “there’s circumvention of the current school board system. I’m not going to call it a scam, but ... “ (that’s when the buzzer interrupted him) 22/
Hogan, sub-district 2, unopposed: It doesn’t matter what I think because the voters will have their say April 2. Whether it passes or fails, it’ll be up to the board to lead on pre-K. 21/
The following tweets will be about support/opposition to mayor’s pre-K plan, which I know many of y’all have asked for. Oates, Wolfsie &amp; Mansur are currently on the board and all on the record opposing. As for everyone else ... 20/
Clinton Adams (rightly) points out that as a school board, there isn’t a lot @kcpublicschools to change accountability for charters in KC. “The best way to do it is to outperform them.” 19/
@OatesForKCPS is talking about efficiencies. It’s really, really expensive to get kids to school in a charter ecosystem. The transportation contract approved last week leaves open the possibility of partnering w/ charters to lower operational costs.  18/
“These kids’ futures are being abated for the benefit on wealthy developers,” says @NateHogan9. A lot of candidates tonight are speaking out against economic development incentives that have impacted the district. KCPS puts the amount diverted at about $30 million a year. 17/
Clinton Adams says he supports the work of the current @kcpublicschools board, especially the strategic plan they adopted. He says districts have a tendency to treat superintendents as messiahs, but this plan can endure a leadership change. 16/
@MansurPl is explaining why @kcpublicschools and 13 other districts are opposing the pre-K sales tax. It comes down to the TIF commission structure, which she says hasn’t worked for traditional public schools. 15/
Wasserstrom says parents don’t feel safe sending their kids to @kcpublicschools, citing last month’s parking lot shooting. But @NateHogan9 challenges that caricaturization of the district. 14
Rita Marie Cortès was unable to attend (running against Oates in sub-district 1). She sent a statement highlighting her leadership roles in Kansas City. 13/
Jennifer Wolfsie has the 4-year at large seat &amp; also won’t be on the ballot. Her two kids attend Border Star &amp; Lincoln College Prep. When @kcpublicschools lost accreditation, she began to advocate on behalf of the local board &amp; against state takeover. 12/
@MansurPl was unopposed for the 2-year at-large seat (so she won’t be on the ballot). “We decided we were going to learn for ourself” when they put their daughter in @kcpublicschools years ago. All 3 kids are grads. 11/
Mark Wasserstrom, sub-district 5 candidate, says he was valedictorian of his Southwest High School class. “We must find a way to unite all children into the public schools.” 10/
@JensenAdams, running in sub-district 5, has a son with special needs. “This was a big change in the household and a big change in how we saw education ... because of him, my eyes are wide-open.” About 20 percent of @kcpublicschools students are in special education. 9/
Demonte Rochester, also running in 4, says @kcpublicschools needs more family engagement. “Dr. Bedell is always pushing for our community to get behind us.” 8/
@Marvia4KCKids, another write-in candidate for 4, has a background in public health. “It all comes back to education. ... We need to continue the upward trajectory this superintendent and board have begun.” Says her kids’ classmates need socio-emotional support. 7/
Ibrahim Ramsey, another write-in candidate for sub-district 4, points to his children. “I’m running because of those two kids.” 6/
Clinton Adams is running as a write-in candidate in sub-district 4 (and a name most KC education watchers will recognize. His goal is to 1) support the superintendent and 2) protect district revenues from developers. He has Freedom Inc. endorsement 5/
@MannyforKC is running unopposed in sub-district 3 (Historic NE). He’s concerned about the decline of infrastructure and buildings and says more people need to be involved in the process. 4/
@NateHogan9 is running unopposed in sub-district 2, says he understands the impact of frequent moves on kids: he switched schools eight times as a kid. He’s lived the experience of violence in underserved communities. 3/
@OatesForKCPS, running for re-election, says he graduated from an unaccredited school district (Paseo HS). He doesn’t want that to be the experience for future @kcpublicschools students. 2/
Hi, it’s Monday, and since you didn’t brave the cold to come to this @kcpublicschools Board of Education forum, I’ll be tweeting it for you. 1/ https://t.co/XQKWeXPy0c
Apologies, y'all, for that incomplete 8:04 newscast @kcur. We'll have more local news coming up at 9:04 (with less coughing, hopefully).
@ClaireMcInerny @kystokes Not MU. M-I-Z!		(But yeah, OK, the campus where I work now.)
Good morning, this dog is ridiculous. https://t.co/n6ua1rHQqU
@andmur02 @kcpublicschools @kcur Not pictured: reporter at her desk at 9:30, ravenously eating a Happy Meal. 		(But in all seriousness, yes, I should.)
@kcpublicschools board approves bus contract with Student Transportation of America. Come August, student will head to school on a new fleet of propane buses. Story @kcur soon-ish. 20/20
First ?, from @OatesForKCPS — would there be any opportunities to work with charter schools on busing? Quinley says if charters can align their start times, then yes, STA can do that. 19/
18/ https://t.co/wfc6ShjsKz
A lot has been made of the fact that STA’s bid was $2 million higher than First Student’s. It looks like a big reason is a commitment to buy new, propane buses — these buses cost about $10K more — for an investment of $1.5M. 17/
Currently KCPS bus drivers (on contract w/ First Student) get $16.75-23.10 per hour. STA offered 25-cent increase as part of their bid. 16/
All vendors had an app. Student Transportation of America specified that their app was in both English and Spanish. Quinley says she doesn’t know if the others that didn’t specify also had a Spanish option. 15/
Quinley says she’s here in the mornings when the calls start — “Where’s my kid’s bus?” She says improved technology — a mobile app, the industry standard — would mean fewer of those calls. 14/
And here are the qualifications that KCPS was looking for out of the “best bid” 13/ https://t.co/6qJ2mhDRYp
“The last time this was bud in 2016 and 2014, there was only one respondent,” says Linda Quinley, CFO/COO for @kcpublicschools 12/
This is what KCPS was asking for during the RFP process. https://t.co/JEiiignJgz
OK, now for the presentation on the bus contract. Background: @kcpublicschools bought a bus facility in 2017 so they could have space for a contractor to manage a fleet and thus attract more bidders. 10/
Final speaker is from STA, the transportation company whose contract the board is voting on. He says First Student bus driver will have the first shot at those positions. 9/
John Billigmeier, also of Student First, says most of the problems stem from bad routing, which they say come from Student Transportation of America, which currently oversees transportation management. 8/
Strong showing from bus drivers &amp; their supporters @kcpublicschools board meeting. 7/ https://t.co/ug2Vp8FHfQ
“We have been committed to you,” Hamilton says of First Student. “Be committed to us.” 5/
Kelly Hamilton with First Student says the company is incredibly committed to making sure kids are safe. “We send buses back to pick up students, and that’s on our dime. ... We go above and beyond to make sure your needs are met.” 4/
Nicole Crawford, who works in early intervention for the district, says there have been issues with not enough buses that have created frustration for very young students with special needs and their families. 3/
First Student actually filed suit late yesterday to stop the board from voting tonight. They’re alleging that KCPS has been less than transparent and had conversations with the recommended transit company, Student Transportation of America, outside the RFP. 2/
The big issue at tonight’s @kcpublicschools board meeting is transportation. There’s a strong showing from First Student, the current bus company, whose contract the district doesn’t plan to renew. 1/

Opposition to pre-K sales tax says they’ve been asked what their plan is. They’re pointing out that this *is* @kcpublicschools’ plan, but they developed it with the understanding they would pursue a levy, not a sales tax. 6/
Here’s the list of organizations represented here. Note that social justice organizations like NAACP, MORE2 &amp; Urban League don’t like this plan. 5/ https://t.co/0mXTcagGhd
Bedell points out that the elected school boards are in opposition ... and he doesn’t like that this is being portrayed as a Mark Bedell v. @MayorSlyJames fight. 4/
“I have a problem with economic development funds going to pay for early childhood,” Bedell says. @kcpublicschools loses a significant amount of revenue because of these tax incentive packages.
Bedell rejects characterization of @MayorSlyJames’ #ece sales tax as “pre-K for all.” 		Public school districts are against for three reasons:	1) Governance structure 	2) $ flowing to private schools	3) Sales taxes are regressive 2/

@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske @kcpublicschools @bshelly @MOEducation As an education reporter who follows this stuff closely, I think the will is there at the state level to give KCPS full accreditation, but we'll all have to wait until March 26 to find out more. 11/
@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske @kcpublicschools @bshelly @MOEducation has said the state board won't consider accreditation until at least March. Bedell says he's OK if the state comes back and says it needs more evidence of progress. 10/

@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske @kcpublicschools "Accreditation is good, and I'm excited that we're headed in the direction to get it, but it shouldn't be the endgame. We need to prepare kids to compete at or above state average," @MarkBedell_KCPS says. 6/
@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske School districts don't *have* to use hold harmless if their scores on the tests are good. @kcpublicschools didn't have to use this rule, which is huge. I can't overstate that as an education reporter. 5/
@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske In conversations about accreditation in Missouri, you might hear the words "hold harmless." It basically means that the results of new tests -- students have taken four different exams in five years -- can be phased in slowly. 4/
@kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS @stevekraske Bedell was "surprised" that KCPS got 82.9 percent of point on the state's report card. He knew they'd be above 70 (the cut off for full accreditation), but 82.9 exceeded his expectations. 3/

@genetEJC Like the blue and white lights probably sounded like a good idea back when the Royals were winning but now it’s like why don’t you just resurrect the General Foam Santa &amp; his reindeer from my youth? OH YEAH CUZ YOU THREW THEM OUT.

@EquitySupt1 @LSR7 Reporter hat back on. The CFMP team knows the 10-yr projections aren't as solid as the 5-yr projections "because those basements haven't been poured yet" LOTS of new development in LS 20/
@EquitySupt1 @LSR7 So I'm gonna take my journalist hat off for a minute and put on my teacher's kid hat: teachers felt like they lost SO MUCH when this change happened. Teaching 6 different classes a day is TOUGH. 19/
@EquitySupt1 @LSR7 Board is talking about the good ol' days when teachers taught 5/7 and middle school "teams" got more time to collaborate. White says in his opinion it wasn't necessary at HS level. 18/
@EquitySupt1 @LSR7 Fritchie isn't a fan of intermingling 6th-8th graders in the same passing period, but she thinks that MS that are built w/ separate 6th grade center work well. 17/
@EquitySupt1 Like a lot of districts, @LSR7 is grappling w/ what to do with 6th graders -- move them to MS, or keep them in elementary school? Parents worry their kids aren't ready. 16/
@EquitySupt1 Something else that came up in engagement series, but didn't get a lot of attention: walk zone to bus stop. Kids will need to walk farther, but they'll be on the bus less time. 15/
There's also a real need for early childhood seats, though the district isn't advocating for universal pre-K at this time (something @EquitySupt1 pushed in Hickman Mills). 14/
Enrollment in career-track programs (not housed in the high schools) has increased from 545 students to 635 in 4 years. The district is hoping that instead of building $100M 4th high school, they can find additional seats there. 13/
The CFMP team tried to keep neighborhoods together, as that's something they heard consistently -- but that might not be possible w/ future boundary changes. 12/
"One of the things we heard was can you eliminate 'split' schools?" That's what the CFMP team tried to do with the brown option, but it moved A LOT of kids (and a goal was to minimize disruption). 11/
CFMP team is presenting one option to the board -- it's a combo of the green/orange plans that were shared w/ public during the final phase of the engagement series. 10/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 At elementary school level, 5th graders can also apply for transfer to finish out elementary school w/ their class. 9/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 CFMP team: in the past, when a new HS opened, only the seniors got to stay. That was a nonstarter in this conversation. Current HS students will be "grandfathered" in. No grandfathering for middle school students. 8/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 This journalist's hot take? The families who don't have to move (or want to move b/c their kids' school is overcrowded) will feel listened to. But the neighborhoods that don't want to move aren't going to feel listened to. 7/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 Bob White echoes the sentiment, having been through many of these boundary realignments in his career w/ district. 6/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 Board member Kim Fritchie -- who taught for 30+ years in @lsr7 -- says she can't remember the public ever having this much opportunity for public input. 5/
@LSR7 @EquitySupt1 District spokeswoman Kelly Wachel is talking about one-on-one conversations during what @lsr7 called engagement series. "They wanted to talk about their personal situation, their individual kids." 4/
@LSR7 Board work session is now underway. Dr. Carpenter, @EquitySupt1, is outlining the work of the CFMP team. That's the Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan that's become synonymous w/ "boundary changes" 3/
@LSR7 This presentation by the Missouri School Boards Association is pretty standard stuff. But an important point: @LSR7 board discussing how no matter how they vote individually on proposed boundary changes, they will support the collective decision. 2/
I'm in @LSR7 this afternoon for a board work session relating to proposed boundary changes. That's at 3; right now the board is hearing a presentation on effective decision-making. 1/

Important distinction: ADA (average daily attendance for you non-eduwonks) tells you which kids showed up, but you really need to be concerned about the kids who don’t show up (the chronically absent students) 20/

Now we’re talking about bathroom access for kids. I’m so into this session, y’all. I wasn’t diagnosed with Crohn’s until I was 28. I can’t tell you how miserable waiting until passing period to use the bathroom was in high school. 17/ https://t.co/USsa0HdtoC
For kids who’re in pain, all day every day, Deacy suggests graduated reentry — pick a set amount of time where the child isn’t in INCREASED pain and in time, increase how long they can stay in school. 17/
It used to be kids either had a GI condition (Crohn’s, cancer, etc.) or they didn’t. Now they’re recognizing there’s abdominal pain that has environmental factors that aren’t easily diagnosable. 16/
Amanda Deacy is a child psychologist @ChildrensMercy who works with children with chronic abdominal pain. Without intervention, about 40 percent end up with GI pain as adults. 🙋‍♀️ 15/
For example, in KCK, they realized kids failed vision screenings but didn’t get glasses. So at the big back-to-school fair, First Hand gives vouchers to get an eye exam and a pair of glasses. 14/
Up first: Mollie Robinson w/ First Hand Foundation, one of Cerner’s philanthropic arms. So schools frequently have health screenings, but a lot of the times the family doesn’t have the resources to follow-up with a doctor/dentist/optometrist. 13/
Next up: a panel on healthcare access. I was an asthmatic kid with GI issues who was chronically absent, so this really resonates with me. 12/
But keep in mind WAY MORE evictions happen INFORMALLY — landlord removes the door, shuts off the heat, forces the family out, etc. @kcpublicschools wants families to know they can help if they’re facing an eviction and help BEFORE it’s filed. 11/
KCPS gets eviction notices for kids in district every Friday to see how they might be able to help. They’re happy to have the data, Reynolds says. But that’s not to say kids haven’t ALREADY moved schools. #KCSchoolAttendance 10/
Reynolds argues for more data sharing between schools in Kansas City. I’ve written about why KC has so many school districts before: https://t.co/wkruK35IHW (Spoiler: it has to do with racism) 9/
Mike Reynolds w/ @kcpublicschools is up. 40 percent of kids are new to KCPS every year. District has about 16K kids, but gets up to 26K unique student records each year. That’s kids moving in and out. 8/
Here’s a plug for @kcur collaboration with @bshelly on students who switch schools frequently: https://t.co/u1r23gGvOp 7/
Neal’s perspective (she’s a mental health consultant with the children’s division) is interesting. She’s talking about all the reasons why kids miss class when they’re taken into care. 6/
There’s a panel on student mobility at #KCSchoolAttendance summit, so obviously that’s where I am. 5/ https://t.co/7l90HIN7te
I think this pretty much sums up #KCSchoolAttendance. High poverty districts have twice the chronic absenteeism as lower povert districts. It’s out-of-school factors — poverty, transportation, housing instability — that makes it hard for these kids to get to school. 4/ https://t.co/KNR2UDO6HO
We’re talking about a shift in how we respond to chronic absence. Treating it as truancy — a compliance issue — doesn’t get kids back to class. Instead, treat it as a predictor of adverse childhood experience. These kids have A LOT going on in their lives. 3/
Districts with better attendance have higher graduation rates. That’s because absences have a cumulative effect. A kid who was chronically absent for four years in grades 8-12 was twice as likely (61%) not to graduate as a kid chronically absent for one year. 2/ https://t.co/TgC5OlQa6M

@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney @KCStar To Herschend's point, no, cut scores aren't of particular interest to most non-eduwonks. But they are used to determine how many kids are PROFICIENT on state tests -- or passing. 26/
@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney @KCStar "What the public wants to know is what percentage of our kids are reading proficiently at 12th grade," says Herschend. "This is an internal document not helpful in the layman's world." 25/
@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney "We need a well done communication plan because the @KCStar will say half our third graders are failing at math," says #MoSBOE's Hallquist. 24/
@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney But having had a lot of convos with districts about the test score delay, I think that's misrepresenting their position. They want a big picture check on whether their interventions are working. 23/
@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney We're getting into (a little bit) what the delay of these test scores means for school districts. @MOEducation position is that teachers shouldn't be making day-to-day instruction decisions based on results 22/
@MOEducation @rpatrickdelaney "If I'm a parent, I'm going to look at how my student compares to ... other students in Missouri," says #MoSBOE President Shields. He doesn't think he gets that from this cut score presentation 21/

You know what's a really weird thing to ration, @UHC? The anti-nausea tablets I need to tolerate my Crohn's meds. Maybe trust that my doc knew best when he wrote it for 30 days instead of making me run back EVERY WEEK for a 9-day supply ...

I’m about to head out (as there’s not too much of a presentation tonight), but here’s the schedule for the rest of the week 10/10 https://t.co/0vvsJXJ4EF
@BraceyHarris It’s a gallery walk at one of the school districts I cover — parents are putting the stickies on the wall in reax to boundary changes.
But one Post-It asks, “Are all transfers going to be approved?” 9/
It’s less clear what happens to current 9th &amp; 10th graders. The district is considering allowing infra-district transfers if parents can provide transportation (they’re also considering *providing* that transportation) 8/
One of the big questions in this process has been grandfathering ... will current high school students be made to move? Current 11th graders would definitely get to stay for their senior year (as was the case when LSN, LSW opened) 7/
Here’s what folks are saying about middle school. One of the options would move sixth graders into the middle schools. 6/ https://t.co/YRoQFMblLh
Reminder that this isn’t all about boundary changes. @LSR7 is also asking about learning spaces and what might work in schools that prepare kids for the future 5/ https://t.co/HpnhmcvVrM
OK, here’s the first boundary option that’s been promised. It ISN’T popular with the LSN crowd here tonight, based on the sticky notes people are using to leave feedback 4/ https://t.co/wYljiZAYW3
Here’s the second survey @LSR7 is asking parents/community members to take: https://t.co/vJvtKvLiAg 3/
Asst. Superintendent Emily Miller says in the past, this work was always done knowing that a new building would need to be built. “We have a different type of problem, and we need a different type of solution.” 2/
Hi, I’m reporting at my old high school and it’s not weird at all. TONIGHT: @LSR7 continues to gather community input on how to redraw boundaries to address overcrowding. 1/
ICYMI, UMKC won't sponsor charters after this school year. Two of its eight schools are moving over to the Missouri Charter Public Schools Commission, other six exploring their options: https://t.co/o4Zf7NEb4H
@mph_phd It was a great analogy — education equity is a tough concept for people who haven’t experienced structural inequality and systemic racism, but I think translating it to a resource they understand helps.

It’s Friday afternoon, and Kingsley is manspreading juuuuust off camera. (See paw.) #kingamongcanines https://t.co/tQHGQvwGYJ
Forum over — I’ll have more tomorrow @kcur 12/12
Carpenter talking about last night’s data presentation: “I didn’t know the gap in ACT scores was 17 points versus 22 points.” 		Lemme our that into perspective. A kid w/ a 21 needs a 2.0 GPA to get into UCM. Kid with a 17 needs 3.45. That’s going to be much harder 11/
Rev. Kirk Perucca of Covenant Presbyterian Church says that sure, conversations about white privilege and white fragility are hard for some — we still have to have them 10/
The district can also show that *even when you control for poverty* these differences persist — white students who receive free or reduced price lunch still outperformed low-income black students 9/
I wasn’t at the mtg last night but I’d seen a lot of what the district shared already — we know that black students continue to trail white students on state assessments, that they pass the algebra end-of-course exams at lower rates &amp; score lower on the ACT 8/
Carpenter encourages audience to “believe the data.” Yesterday @LSR7 shared what it knows about the achievement gap between students of color and their white peers with the community 7/
1st question is a really good one, in the opinion of this education reporter: what’s the difference between equity and equality as it relates to discipline? (Remember, there’s a huge disparity in MO for the suspension of students of color) 6/
@mph_phd brings the perspective of education in a teachers college. She says sometimes the curriculum can “other” people of color &amp; their experiences and not teach enough about self and how they might have been complicit in systemic inequality 5/
Carpenter draws on the car example: if an after school enrichment program requires a student 1) be able to drive and 2) have their own transportation, it’s inherently inequitable 4/
@mph_phd offers an explanation of equity that I think is useful: “It’s not you get a car and you get a car and you get a car” because not everyone needs a car. Some people already have cars. But yes, people get jealous that they’re not getting another car 3/
Carpenter: Talent is distributed evenly, but access and opportunity are not. Equity is giving every child what they need to succeed. 2/

@JVandenbos1 @EquitySupt1 As for transparency, everyone is going to have a different perspective, but I can tell you the timing for when the agenda for the Sept. 25 mtg was posted is pretty standard and Missouri law only requires 24 hours notice of a public meeting. More here: https://t.co/eMTjxrqzfF 4/4
@JVandenbos1 @EquitySupt1 Obviously every speaker made multiple points, but you communicated well the fact that for many folks, the timing of this WITH the ongoing boundary discussion has been incredibly confusing, and it’s hard to know what to pay attention to 3/
@JVandenbos1 @EquitySupt1 The $7,000 the school board was considering spending on Pacific Education group represents less than 1/100 of a percent of the overall cost to run the district. It’s also in line with what other districts in the area are spending on diversity training 2/
@JVandenbos1 @EquitySupt1 Hi Jessica — I’m not sure if I’m following the argument that the cost of hiring a diversity consultant for $7,000 represents a large sum of money for the district when last year LSR7 had an operating budget of more than $230 million 1/

Basically tensions are high right now @lsr7 because of the boundary discussion, but it’s not unusual to bring in a diversity expert for professional development for school board members. More later @kcur 18/18
Carpenter: the research says even when you do second order change well, people won’t agree with how you communicated it 17/ https://t.co/N6S4bemUZq
Parent Jessica Vandenbos is asking the school board to untangle all the issues — the CFMP boundaries process, diversity training, equity in education — and Superintendent Carpenter is responding 16/
@EquitySupt1 Carpenter reminds the audience he is raising two black children and that the achievement gap is real even for students of color who grow up in middle-income neighborhoods 15/
Dr. Carpenter is trying to address this outrage over Pacific Education Group head on. Points out that Glenn Singleton’s “Courageous Conversation about Race” is highly cited &amp; well-respected 13/
Grider is criticizing the school board for putting $7,000 contract to Pacific Education Group on agenda that wasn’t released until Friday evening. But that’s actually all the notice that’s required for a Tuesday meeting 13/
Craig Grider, an orthodontist, says he’s heard the rumors that some neighborhoods, particularly Winterset, would be moved from Lee’s Summit West to LSHS for years, before Dr. Carpenter came on board 12/
Parent Holly Godfrey asks why the focus is on racial equity versus equity for students of disabilities or some other concern. Say the board’s decision to go with Pacific lacks transparency and gets big applause 11/
All right, we’re getting into it now. Some citizens are concerned that @LSR7 has selected Pacific Education Group, known for leading discussions about racial equity, versus some other consulting firm 10/
We’ve got at least 8 people who want to speak at this @LSR7 meeting. Usually the board sets aside 20 minute for public comment, but they’re going to let everyone talk tonight 9/
It’s also worth noting there are a lot of LSHS graduates on the @LSR7 school board, a lot of Tiger pride. Depending on how the boundary discussion goes over the next few months that could be relevant 8/
I was a junior in 2005 when the newest of the Lee’s Summit High schools, West, opened. If the boundary discussion had gone a different direction I could’ve graduated a Titan, not a Bronco 7/
And, because it feels like a good time for it: I spent 13 years @lsr7, graduating from Lee’s Summit North. My mom taught in the district for 23 years, at Lee’s Summit High School, Pleasant Lea Junior High, Lee’s Summit Elementary &amp; LSN 6/
Shoutout to the adorable kiddos from Hazel Grove, my elementary, doing the school presentation at tonight’s @LSR7 board meeting 5/ https://t.co/Mo5WPhit8Y
“It’s about their future. It’s not about our past,” says Carpenter. He repeats, “It’s about their future. It’s not about our past.” 4/
@EquitySupt1 Dennis Carpenter just called this a “boundary” discussion — that’s not how district is branding it — but he also says to only have a discussion about where to locate seats is shortsighted 3/
Basically Lee’s Summit West is overcrowded and there are going to be families who won’t be happy going to the district’s other, older high schools. Here’s what I’ve written about the process so far: https://t.co/u0agpgFGt6

@LSR7 owns property at 7 Hwy and Colbern Rd and another 51 acres at Bailey Road, but neither were purchased with a fourth high school in mind ... really too small for a HS 10/
“Should we be asking our city government leaders to be creating a more diverse and equitable demographic?” I.e, affordable housing 9/
We’re onto the Q&amp;A portion. People are concerned about the things you’d expect — if boundaries change, can my child be grandfathered in to stay at his/her current school? Too soon to say. Those answers coming late this semester. 8/
Over the next decade, @LSR7 is likely to add 1,800 students. That’s much slower growth than in the ‘90s. The school-age population per household is declining 7/
Estimate: 7,700 units will be added in 10 years, 35 percent will be multi-family housing. That’s going to change @LSR7 demographics over time. 6/
I grew up in Lee’s Summit so this demographics presentation is fascinating. The housing market is recovering, but most of the growth has been high-end development. There’s not much that’s an “entry point” 5/
@LSR7 high school enrollment has continued to increase due to aging-in-place of the resident population. Enrollment in K-2 hasn’t changed much in the last 10 years. 4/

Missouri needs to look at secondary markets for international trade opportunities, Parson says. Mentions Boeing $805 million drone contract. “Who are all the subcontractors to that, and how do we get them here?” 6/
Interesting (at least to this education reporter) that Parson mentions getting people out of prison and into the workforce as he lays out education goals. Missouri schools are still disciplining students of color at disproportionate rates 5/
Parson praises Missouri’s high graduation rate but says education system is fully aligned with business development needs. Also points out that the population is growing slower than other states — and getting older 4/

@kcpublicschools @kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS KCPS has said 2021 is more realistic -- IF this collaboration ultimately happens. There are a lot of ifs and maybes in this situation. 9/
@kcpublicschools @kcur @MarkBedell_KCPS As for timeline, there isn't one. In Uniting at Southwest's letter of intent (read all 95 pages here: https://t.co/9S4VWcgyoX), they proposed a fall 2020 opening. 8/
@kcpublicschools @kcur It's clear the district is VERY sensitive to those concerns moving forward. Superintendent @MarkBedell_KCPS made it very clear that as input is gathered, any plan to reopen Southwest would have to take ALL KCPS students into consideration. 7/
@kcpublicschools @kcur The conversation about a south of Brush Creek middle/high school in predominately white Brookside or Waldo raised some uncomfortable questions about integration and education in Kansas City. 6/
@kcpublicschools @kcur It's clear that these guidelines were developed in part because KCPS was unable to reach an agreement with Academie Lafayette on a high school collaboration. 5/
@kcpublicschools @kcur Backing up several months: the @kcpublicschools Board of Directors spent a lot of time crafting these new guidelines for collaboration, and this will be the first real test of how well they work. 4/
@kcpublicschools @kcur And I'd say those talks are still pretty preliminary -- today's announcement was just that the district had gotten USW's letter of interest (part of a new process for collaboration) and is willing to continue the conversation. 3/

@ChiefTForbes: I’m not opposed to metal detectors, but I could get together with Sgt. Depue (@LSPDPIO) and in 30 seconds come up with a way to get around them. Nothing’s foolproof. If someone’s motivated, they’re going to get it done. 9/
Because, Carpenter continues, there are two costs. The financial cost of additional security measures, but more importantly, it takes a toll on relationships when you ask young people to undergo a bag search every time they enter their building. 8/
Carpenter on metal detectors: it’s a philosophical issue. What do we have tolerance for as a community? Do you want to harden the school? Or do you want to soften the school to enhance safety? Does the community want bullet- resistant glass? 7/

I actually try to read as much as I can about victims of these mass shootings. It’s tough. But I force myself to do it, to remember them as people, not casualties. 41/
BTW, the teacher that bled to death at Columbine was Dave Sanders. This (old) article from @denverpost is a tough read, but it explains what happened: https://t.co/S5iiXVVmkl
Douglass adds that he has conversations with the firearms-carrying staff constantly. If they’re not prepared to confront the perpetrator — that didn’t happen in Florida — then it’s time to retire.  39/
Douglass responds that @theSMSD knows they need more types of drills/instructions that prepare kids for an active shooter than just locking the classroom door. 38/
2) can we get emergency aid kit in schools? EMT can’t enter a building until police clear it, and a teacher at Columbine bled out before paramedics could enter. 37/
Audience member who identifies himself as a “school lunch lady” says he’s thinking about two things: 1) how are schools preparing students for an active shooter situation in an assembly or passing period and 36/
Mohammad makes a good point: if kids choose not to walk out, their peers shouldn’t oust them. It’s their choice not to walk out, just like it’s their peers’ right to do so. 35/
From social media: what do you think of this “walk up, not up” response? (That’s the idea that kids should do more to befriend peers who’ve been bullied.) There’s been pushback to this. Some feel it’s victim-blaming. 34/
In case you were wondering, Kantner is part of her school’s Young Republicans. Says her classmates are more liberal. Tells @kcurkyle she doesn’t think #Parkland survivors speak for her because she has “a different opinion than that.” 33/

The #Parkland survivors are remarkable kids — in part because they’ve recognized how their privilege has created a platform on which to speak. @davidhogg111 especially has talked about the intersection of white privilege and gun safety activism. 25/
A school shooting is terrifying because it doesn’t matter if it’s one in the million if it happens at your school, to your friends, your classmates. But it’s different than knowing a friend, a family member who’s been shot. 24/
The newsroom settled on, “We’re going to be covering this issue for a while,” so the story didn’t have to be all things to all people. But I think the point that talking about school shootings in this kind of venue does require some privilege. 23/
Did we include the kinds of gun violence that impact urban schools and communities? Do we talk about the fact that it’s mostly white perpetrators in mostly white schools? 22/
And she’s right: the gun violence that affects urban schools isn’t in the school. It’s in the community. It’s beefing with each other. When I reported a feature on how JoCo teens were reacting to #Parkland, @kcur had a lot of conversations about this. 21/
“This is an issue that has some race and class and privilege to it,” says a teacher in the audience. She doesn’t think urban kids want to shoot their schools up. 20/
Kids are terrible to each other. Let’s not kid ourselves. But the narrative that bullied kids go on to shoot up their schools is dangerous, IMO. 19/
Harris was probably a psychopath/sociopath. Klebold had actually gone to prom a few weeks before the shooting. The teens who’d go on to slaughter their classmates went to school activities with them, like football games. 18/
DOUGLASS IS GETTING INTO SOMETHING I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. (Especially because bullying is on my mind this week.) After the Columbine, the narrative was that the shooters had been bullied. But Kleibold and Harris were NOT isolated from their peers. 17/
Douglass: for most of my 45 years of law enforcement, it didn’t matter how they got there, just that they got there. I’m pleased to say we’re moving away from that. In other words, it’s addressing trauma in students’ lives. 16/
Emotional comment from a nurse who works with pediatric patients: these shooters are often suicidal. What do we do to keep them out when they’re students feeling all this? 15/

Douglass: it’s up to the board, “but I think it sends the wrong message” when schools arm teachers. “Armed confrontation is the very last resort. It’s already tragic when we’ve reached that point.” 12/

There was a test going on this morning at West. I don’t have all the details, but the announcement I heard stressed to the students how important it was to keep these exterior doors closed. 5/

We know that low-income families often have informal living arrangements — stays with friends or family members, stopovers in budget motels or homeless shelters. Which means this is a much bigger problem than 4 percent of @kcpublicschools students. 13/
A VERY conservative estimate puts the number of @kcpublicschools children whose families are formally evicted between 300-500 every year. To count in the analysis, students’ last names had to link to names on formal court filings. 12/

These eviction stats certainly tell a story: 182,992 evictions in Jackson County since 1999. These are just FORMAL evictions, Raghuveer emphasizes. Informal evictions happen every day. 8/ https://t.co/hMCqDJqZKU
“When I first looked at this graph I was really bored,” Raghuveer says. “But what it shows is the number of evictions in Kansas City has been incredibly steady.” However, she notes that rent is becoming increasingly unaffordable. 7/ https://t.co/ZxKerCyF8r
This problem isn’t unique to Kansas City. “In my research I haven’t found a city that’s doing particularly well in solving this issue,” Raghuveer says. 6/
Raghuveer asks for a show of hands: “Who’s been down to eviction court in Jackson County?” @bshelly has. So has @MayorSlyJames. Raghuveer encourages everyone to go at some point. Thursdays. 5/

A: “We’d gladly investigate a million kids if we caught it the one time they weren’t joking around,” says principal. 17/
Q: how do I report a threat if I don’t know the kid making it? What if I just overhead them in the hall? “It’s probably a joke, but ... “ 16/
“I still believe schools are the safest place in the world, but bad things can happen here,” principal says. 15/
“I felt like a sitting duck, too,” especially as a person still sweeping the halls while law enforcement is trying to get them to lockdown, principal confesses. 14/
“I felt like a sitting duck,” a student says of last year’s lockdown and subsequent evacuation. 13/
Follow up on student question who asked what to do if they’re in the hall when a lockdown begins: not all staff will be locked in a room. Some will be sweeping halls to help these students find a place to be. 13/
“This is our school. We shouldn’t feel unsafe.” This forum at NKC’s Oak Park HS is starting to sound a little less scripted, a little more honest. 12/
Explanation: drill started as a “lock and teach” and turned (quickly) into a full-on lockdown. One is a softer lockdown — classroom door is closed, but school continues. In the other, a teacher is supposed to move kids to the safest part of the room. 11/
“Last year when we had that lockdown I couldn’t tell if people were taking it seriously.” Teachers continued to teach, students didn’t move to the safest part of the classroom. 10/
FWIW, I know why schools ask students to write questions in advanced, but this forum feels somewhat ... rehearsed. 9/
The threat that evacuated Oak Park in 2017, btw, was both a bomb and weapons threat — so doubly tricky to deal with because it wasn’t apparent where the threat would come from. 8/
Answer: you’ll see that on TV in school districts across the country. That’s law enforcement taking over. We have to make sure we’re not just moving the threat somewhere else if the threat is a student. 7/
Question: during the evacuation drill, we had to leave in a single-file line. Wouldn’t it be safer to get us out faster? 6/
Answer: we know we need to do a better job of explaining what to do in that scenario. Best option is to lock out — get students into a locked classroom. But other option is to get out. 5/
Student asks, “What do I do if I’m in the hallway and someone starts shooting? How do I convince a teacher who’s already closed the door I’m not the threat?” 4/
NKC Safety &amp; Security Director: staff has been thorough a “get out, take out training.” Plans to recommend a better way to use school resource officers. Talks to other districts often. 3/
The possibility a threat could disrupt the school day is a reality here: last year the school had to be evacuated after an anonymous threat. Students were taken to nearby Stahley HS. https://t.co/qcecmBmbgz 2/

@ExpressRxHelp I can’t wait. That’s why I told you last week I needed it TODAY. And you didn’t bother telling me until TODAY it wouldn’t be arriving.
@ExpressRxHelp Supervisor Andrew, ext. 231571, ALREADY TOLD ME that ACCREDO would do a one-time fill if my doctor could locate a specialty pharmacy with Humira in stock. Instead they’re saying I can wait for it to be mailed to me.
@ExpressRxHelp ACCREDO: If we can find it at a local specialty pharmacy, we can do an emergency fill. 	Also ACCREDO, while I’m standing in the specialty pharmacy across town that has my medication: We can only fill that prescription by mail order.
@revlucymeg I don’t trust them with any other medication (because they can’t be trusted), but Humira is only available by mail order.
I’m weary. It shouldn’t be a fight to get my medication every month. I shouldn’t have to go without because ACCREDO screwing up. The only solution at this point is to send me with prednisone and hope  I don’t need it. https://t.co/SU2GD6PqiP

@hidama @kcurkyle @KCStar One of my friends &amp; her husband shared a car for several years. But then  a job change came with a longer commute — now they’re a 2 car household again. Being able to go car-free is so situational, especially in a city with less than stellar public transit.
@hidama @kcurkyle @KCStar Does that surprise you? Because I think a lot of us would like to use our cars less (I would!) but most of us don’t have that magical alignment of live/work that makes it possible. 1/2

KCPS Board Member Jennifer Wolfsie: in 2015, we were at ideal size for Lincoln 6-12. Did getting rid of waitlist put school over capacity?

@KCIEdgemoor Q: will you honor the slaves who are buried on @KCIAirport land? A: we know it's important to the community &amp; want that history reflected.
Q for @KCIEdgemoor: will glass be bulletproof? A: we'll work w/ TSA to make sure the design we put forward is safe for traveling public.
@KCIEdgemoor @KCIAirport Benefits for employees/community: transportation from downtown &amp; child care on-site. Local business training with possibility of contracts.

@KCMOHealthDept The data came from @MOEducation -- it includes 2014-15 &amp; 2015-16 school year, but NOT the most recent school year
As I'm tweeting from @TurnthePageKC suspension summit, keep in mind 1) in-school &amp; out-of-school suspensions were combined &amp; 2) it's pre-K-8
@KCMOHealthDept Male elementary students were more likely than female students to be suspended -- they were put out of school at 3x the rate.
@KCMOHealthDept The cohort included any school that enrolls elementary students (pK-8) within the boundaries of KCMO. 40,090 students enrolled in 2015-16.

This bridge raises. BTW the numbers on bridges aren't depth like most people think. It's distance from water surface. https://t.co/dwzIGigbv4

A young woman starts crying when she tells @MarkBedell_KCPS she's undocumented &amp; a teacher told her she won't be able to go to college.
This student says she felt demoralized when her principal said she was missing too many days. She got her attendance up, but peers didn't.
Bedell tells student who has a child he's trying to figure out how to support teen parents, like daycare in some buildings.
One student tells @MarkBedell_KCPS she's supposed to graduate in 2 weeks but doesn't have grade in a class. He says he's going to fix today.
You know what warms this reporter's cold, dead heart? Kids telling @MarkBedell_KCPS want to learn and asking for better curriculum.
Bedell tells student he wants to give teachers more choices for tech. Offer 4 laptops, let them pick. Maybe can offer students eventually.
The students here - not all from Northeast, I might add - are more making comments. One student tells Bedell his computer crashes a lot.
4th Q: Why isn't the curriculum more challenging at Lincoln? Student says Foreign Language Academy prepared her for higher level of rigor.
.@MarkBedell_KCPS Let me correct that: not just 10th graders. 9, 10, 11 will all take pre-ACT.
.@MarkBedell_KCPS says he's budgeted for 10th graders to take pre-ACT to introduce them to exam &amp; ease test anxiety.
3rd Q: The average ACT score at Lincoln has dropped since I started. What's being done about it?

Bedell, btw, was over at @KCPS_Banneker, where another public meeting is happening concurrently. @NatalieA_KCPS tells me more people there.
@MarkBedell_KCPS came in during exercise &amp; asked me which goals groups chose. Looked excited. Lines up w/ other feedback district getting.
Here are the goals the groups agreed were most important: https://t.co/igyTyBrnOw
Broadly, there's support for success in the early years, whole child support, critical thinking, HS graduation &amp; college readiness.
Next task for groups: pick the 4 most important goals for the district from a list. But groups find it hard to come to a consensus.
"The expectation should be if a child walks into one of our high schools, they will graduate." https://t.co/U9ac1zGN8S
"We're homeless," says a parent. Thanks KCPS for district's support. Says schools "have gotten a bad rap" but have been good for her kids.
If students don't get into Lincoln Prep, one woman points out, what other opportunities are there in @kcpublicschools?
Lots of @CityYearKC staffers here. In discussion of factors preventing student achievement, they point to challenges at home.

Though KCPS superintendent turnover seems high, it's actually not all that unusual. Average tenure of urban superintendent is 3 years.
Bedell, who started this school year, says @kcpublicschools needs a plan that holds up even if superintendent leaves.
"This plan cannot be the plan of the superintendent. This plan cannot be the plan of the school board," says Supt. @MarkBedell_KCPS.
Public meetings 5:30 p.m. tonight at Central Academy &amp; Benjamin Banneker; 5:30 p.m. Wednesday at Northeast Middle School &amp; Paseo Academy.

I'd like to note there are some SERIOUS "What the ... ?" faces on stage right now.
Here's a weird question: should the district maintain its high standard of achievement, or devote resources to leveling the playing field?
Jacqueline Clark: I don't think $100 is a huge incentive for teachers. We need to offer professional development, externships &amp; mentoring.
Carl Quijas:  "I'd love to see some sort of  merit pay system (for teachers), but that’s another thing that’s not in the budget now."
McMenus on teacher evaluation system: "A teacher gets a lot of blame and a lot of credit for what the parents are doing at home."
Dennis Smith, a former principals, says LSR-7 will need to decide where it's paying teachers - i.e., high starting pay? Or mid-career?
There's a lot of enthusiasm for raising teacher pay, but Jill Worstel says that may not be realistic &amp; isn't a promise candidates can keep.
Jacqueline Clark points out LSR-7 built 30 buildings assuming no charters. She says district can't be silent on possibility &amp; must advocate.
More nuanced: Murdock, who taught in Raytown during KCPS transfers, says there's a risk tuition paid to LS won't be sufficient to educate.
EVERYONE on stage at LSR-7 candidate forum is opposed to vouchers/open enrollment/charters. All say more advocacy needed in Jefferson City.
On growth/enrollment, Ryan Murdock &amp; Mike McMenus both suggest it might be time to move students from Lee's Summit West to LSHS.
OK, I'm focusing on getting candidates' answers down. I'll have a few tweets later when we come to a break.

That said, Harmon says those comments NEVER should happen in the Lee's Summit R-7 School District.

Carpenter gets a round of applause for saying his family is off limits. Bill Baird: "I've seen them. They're cute." (Ditto. Adorable kids.)
Carpenter made this point last week, too. Universal pre-K for 4-year-olds might not be what Lee's Summit needs, even if he did it in HM.
Carpenter: for kids in poverty fastest way to the middle class in quality early childhood education. But fewer LS kids in poverty than HM.
In non-educator speak, that means Carpenter wanted people who'd gone w/o raises for 6-7 years to "catch up" to where they should be 2/2
Carpenter talking about importance of support staff. Says he fought for them to make up missed salary steps in Hickman Mills 1/
Q: do you plan on bringing team from Hickman w/ you? Carpenter says something special in LS. Tenure important. He'd consider for openings.
Phyllis Balagna: "We've been called stupid ... incompetent ... an embarrassment to community." But she's excited by Carpenter hire.
"We're pretty proud of our district around here," says LS board member Bill Baird with the biggest understatement I think I've ever tweeted.
"There's no check box" for doing what he did in Hickman Mills, Dennis Carpenter tells LS board. "That's not leadership."
Board member Bill Baird says for many, this isn't a color issue. It's about respect for police. Asks Carpenter opinion of law enforcement.
Carpenter confirms yes, you saw a photo of him on FB wearing an "I can't breathe" hoodie. Says as a black man, can't take that skin off.
A lawyer for LSR7 explains that just because Carpenter, current supt in Hickman Mills, was served, doesn't mean he's subject of suit.

"We unified under a position that it  was smart to save lives," says Yoder of push to increase NIH funding.
Yoder's acceptance speech touches on divisive political climate. He says a better household issue would be cancer research.

Incumbent Linda Gallagher also cheerful as she describes friendship with Dem. Amber Versola, who she says moved into district when open seat
That said, Stoll is complimentary of Cox and says they have similar positions on many issues. KS Dems have more candidates than in 30 years.
Democrat Helen Stoll says she's more likely to have committee seat than moderate Republican Tom Cox if one of them unseats Brett Hildabrand.
"There's lots of differences. First, I'm here today," says @dinah_sykes on the biggest difference btwn Her &amp; opponent, incumbent @Greg4KS.

Stepped out for a quick interview, but we've moved on to audience questions. Judicial retention is on the mind of Kansans.
"People hear what they want to hear," says KS SBOE's Steve Roberts of politics. Few teachers coming up through STEM license. Last count, 9.
Democrat Amber Versola: "a lot of misunderstanding about what #CommonCore is." Ah, academic standards. How I've missed you.
Having covered expansive Indiana voucher program, I'm interested to see how conversation Kansas appears poised to have will go.
Big applause for Linda Gallagher who says public funds should be used for public schools. Vouchers coming up frequently this primary season.
I give Libertarian Michael Kerner, running in Senate 21, kudos for coming. Tells pro-public ed PTA all funding for schools should be local.

@ksucats96 thanks! I didn’t get everything in the middle, unfortunately, as I had to download my Twitter app again. GRRR.
Heley: Sykes has already been attacked by PAC mailers. I can out-raise Greg Smith, though he’ll have access to other money.
Heley: Paul Davis won this district in ‘14, so it shouldn’t be represented by a Brownback Republican, but a Democrat.
Sykes: I don’t have an ulterior motive. I never saw myself in politics. KS needs to be a boring place again. Not front page of NY Times.
Czerniewski: What we all have in common is wanting to send incumbent Greg  Smith packing. Who has the best shot?
Sykes: I’ve showed up. I’ve listened to you. “I have skin in the game. I love this community.” Family, neighbors here. I will fight for you.
Czerniewski: I’ve worked in the district, I’ve lived here my whole life. My background is in leadership. Boy Scouts, ROTC, running business.
Heley: I thought my age (23) would be a negative, but when I knock doors, people say they want new blood in Topeka.
Czerniewski: The system we have now (to select judges) keeps governor from abusing his power. Calls KS on road to dictatorship.
Heley: The role of the court is to interpret how the legislature is doing. It’s up to the courts to make sure they do their job.
Sykes: Selection of judges should be impartial. We shouldn’t change how it’s done in KS.
@daysathome Lindsay, to clarify, Sykes was talking about alcohol &amp; Costco specifically. Says tax on food too high, too, though.
Czerniewski: Education all Dems talked about in ‘14, and “it helped them lose the election.” Fixing funding needs to involve local schools.
Heley: My brother is an educator in KCK. Huge classes this past 4 years. Now he’s in San Diego, better climate. KS losing young people.
Sykes: Our tax money needs to stay in public schools. There’s no oversight in private schools, so no vouchers.
Sykes: Public schools are the cornerstone of our community. K-12 is economic driver. As a mother I’d never move somewhere w/ bad schools.
Heley: Restore income tax on 330,000 earners exempted under LLC law. We need to eventually eliminate grocery tax/lower sales tax.
Sykes: People are crossing to Missouri to shop there. We don’t need to pass the buck on budget cuts to the governor.
How do you balance the budget?	Czerniewski: Close the LLC loopholes. Sales tax “through the roof,” needs to be eliminated on food/groceries.

Melcher: JoCo is important. we’re throwing the party for the entire state. We should have a seat at the table.
Melcher: elect Skubal, and you get more government, more taxes. He will fight for small, efficient government.
Skubal: I’m responsive to my constituents. I return all their calls. If I don’t know how to help I figure out who does. Meet &amp; greet Sat.
Skubal: you need government. 911, fire, police. Tax dollars paid for roads. People say they don’t want government but need it.
Melcher: “I’m a job creator.” He knows how to balance a budget and how an economy works. That’s what distinguishes him from Skubal.
Skubal: “I’m sure the Royals would like to choose the umpires.” Attorneys know which judges are fair. We shouldn’t elect judges.
Melcher: People very upset about judicial overreach. “They are running our court like a dictatorship.” Judicial retention election coming.
Melcher: KS Supreme Court out of control. Activist court often overturned. Doesn’t favor political court on the left or right.
Melcher: “it’s important for students to realize any money they borrow they have to pay back.” Not just an education for education’s sake.
Skubal: We have state employees that haven’t had pay increases for 8 or 9 years. We don’t have KS Hwy. Patrol where we need them.
Melcher calls road builders a special interest and says Skubal is beholden to one source of campaign funding.
Melcher: We shouldn’t construct roads where they won’t get used. We’re investing in roads in JoCo, where it’s necessary.
Skubal: “I would not take 1 cent of dedicated funds and spend them on anything else.” Says $1 mil in transportation funds creates 47 jobs.
Skubal: businesses ask OP about k-12 schools, infrastructure, trained workforce more than they do tax policy.
Skubal: We need a clawback. OP has one. If companies don’t produce jobs, incentives go away &amp; you pay your tax burden.
Melcher: We don’t have mountains or beaches. We have a tax policy that encourages small businesses in KS. Tax cuts passed before I arrived.
Skubal adds he wants the courts out of education and wants districts to be able to dialogue about what they need to get job done.
Skubal: No private school vouchers. (Melcher didn’t answer.) teachers paid #43 in nation. “JoCo has been built on the back of education.”
Onto ed funding! Melcher: “Conservatives are concerned about education” and invest heavily in it. $14K/kid in Blue Valley.
How do we balance the budget? Skubal: our credit rating is already in the tank. Melcher: JoCo holds on. Oil prices, aviation hurting state.
Councilman Skubal says KS not headed in right direction. Fiscal crisis. He’s worried about education: K-12, higher ed &amp; trade schools.

"Don't grieve over them." Honor them. Honor those that are still doing the job, including detention deputies. At the WyCo officer memorial.

City liked Foutch Bros. proposal best because it had multiple sports and made most physical improvements to Kemper Arena area (10 acres).

Rosalind Temple with Mothers in Charge says she’s begged people to take gun locks. And they won’t take precautions, she says.
I’ve covered a lot of @jeanpetersbaker press conferences. It’s clear these child deaths have been weighing on the prosecutor.
“Children are not responsible for their own safety,” says Peters Baker. “That’s your job and mine.”

"This is the gun lock we're willing to give you for free if you just ask," says Prosecutor @jeanpetersbaker https://t.co/ciNKaYtH5f
“We have once again failed to protect our most precious, our most vulnerable population,” Prosecutor Baker says.
