"The more frequent and intense coastal flooding brought on by sea level rise will impact all Americans. Along our coasts are assets worth trillions of dollars." -Dr. @radleyhorton
"As the temperatures of coastal waters rise, harmful algal blooms are more likely to occur. These blooms produce marine biotoxins that are poisons. Shellfish ingest the biotoxins...causing illness in humans who consume the infected shellfish."-Ms. Margaret Pilaro
‚Äú‚Ä¶sea level rise is also a public health and safety issue. It means less time to evacuate from low lying areas in advance of a coastal storm, and greater risk of injury and death for those vulnerable members of our communities who are unable to evacuate.‚Äù- Dr. @radleyhorton
