@realDonaldTrump The tide is turning!!!  #MAGA  Please put HRC, BHO and all the rest in GITMO and open it to the public so we can view and visit them in their cells.  Maybe throw shit at them in retribution for the treason and all of the lost lives they're responsible for!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I'm very sorry you're so deeply disrespected by a bunch of sore losers.  They need to get over it as history will prove them all wrong -- and you will go down in history as one of -- if not the GREATEST President in our history!  #MAGA  &lt;3

@realDonaldTrump Blame the FBI for that. FBI's asleep at the wheel when it comes 2 justice for Americans.  They're 2 busy w/witch hunts 2 protect HRC to follow up on warnings/leads on possible terrorists from citizens &amp; other nations!  They want us dead so badly, they're taking us out themselves!
@realDonaldTrump Well isn't NSA's excuse for violating the Constitution and illegally collecting citizens private communications that it provides them with a huge advantage in thwarting terrorist attacks?  Since the NSA is failing miserably at this, please order them to stop!  IMMEDIATELY!  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Please hold Broward Co BOE accountable 4 their policy of shielding minority offenders from police investigations &amp; prosecutions.  The school systems' security officers are forced to forge theft reports as lost items, etc. This policy was inspired by a pro minority BHO initiative!
@realDonaldTrump Also, Sir, the Broward Co school system enacted a policy to purposefully hide crimes of their students from the police so they didn't investigate or prosecute.  Their policy was based on an Obama initiative to reduce minority arrests for crimes committed by school aged offenders!
@SpoxDHS @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Let's make sure it remains only a proposal then!  These anti-patriots must be voted out of office and their criminal policy making power put to an end!  They literally enjoy destroying America and Americans, the sick b*stards!  Out!  OUT!!!!
@realDonaldTrump They are insane and clearly HATE We The People!  Let's vote THEM ALL out of office!  Let them kiss foreign ass as ordinary citizens!  Hey, it's their right to do it that way, but sure as hell not as a government officials usurping state &amp; federal laws!!!
@realDonaldTrump They don't want no stinkin deal!  They wanted to use DACA to base their 2018 campaigns on!  God knows they have no leadership, no plan, no legislation OR ideas to run on w/the goal of helping the American people.  Thanks 4 blowing up that bridge &amp; calling their bluff!! U R #MAGA!
