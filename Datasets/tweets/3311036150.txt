At the end, he shook my hand, and told me "I learned a lot from you. I'm gonna tell my wife about you and my children."		As I left, I told him, "I want to fight for a fair system. Nothing more, nothing less."		I hope I made a little difference.		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
Then I asked him, "Do you regret it?"		He confessed. "Yes."		He didn't want a wall. He didn't want families to be separated. He realized that our country is neither a private home to bar people nor a company to be run like a business. Trump is exactly who he said he was.
I told him we have to think of the border as a tool to enhance prosperity. That only happens when goods, ideas, services, and people can cross *bidirectionally*.		I explained the 10 year bar: it was the anti-immigrant movement to blame for the 11M+ undocumented population.
I told him I spent time in Dilley, TX and Tijuana, MX, and *never* talked to anyone who didn't have an internally consistent, corroborated, and plausible story for asylum. I told him where these policies come from, and how they have nothing to do with economic/national security.
I told him if the laws now in place existed when he came decades ago, he wouldn't be allowed in. (And neither would my parents.) Switching to lawyer mode,  I walked him through the labor certification process, I-140 ability to pay RFE's, the H-1B lottery, and visa backlogs.

4. One conversation won't do it. Like any change, it requires time and pressure.		We can't only have conversations when something happens like the blackface scandals in Richmond.		A commitment to harness diversity and fight inequality must be sustained after the hastags fade.
3. Develop "bias detectors." Be vigilant, and recognize what "latent racism" looks like.		This is a collective responsibility, but not necessarily equally apportioned. As the majority, white people bear a greater responsibility, and must recognize white privilege.
2. Diversity is great, but not until we use it to build stronger and more inclusive communities.		It's a means, not an end. And it can be used to divide us if we don't work together.
Our takeaways:		1. Get out of your comfort zone.		Get out and meet people.	If you stay among your own, you're contributing to the problem.
They couldn't have come from more divergent backgrounds, but they came to talk on the same platform. 		Kelvin said it was the campaign rhetoric in 2016 and the subsequent terror attack in Charlottesville, VA that prompted him to action.		It reminded him of his childhood.

Whatever happens, the episodes will be all for naught if we don't keep having uncomfortable conversations. They're necessary conversations, and politicians and candidates alike should be fostering them, looking beyond the next election.		The best medicines are usually bitter.
From talking to many black voters: we must allow space for an individual's evolution and change of heart from mindsets of accepted racism or injustice if we are to see a lasting change for the better. Other black voters continue to call on Northam (and/or Herring) to resign.
It's the culture it represents. One where it's funny to dehumanize black people, laugh at a white-hooded terrorist, or joke about swastikas. It's what left of the culture that you can read in the 1889 article.		Actions have consequences, but redemption is laudable.
It's not a 35 year old photograph, or dressing up like Michael Jackson or Kurtis Blow, or playing "runaway slave" in gym class, racist graffiti on the Ashburn Colored School, or writing swastikas and the N-word in the snow. These aren't the issue.
I no longer call this system "broken" - it's operating as it was designed to do.		But we can be the ones to break it.
There is no escaping the fact that there exists a system - a culture - designed to perpetuate inequality at an institutional level. We need to start thinking about what a truly equitable system would look like, because none of us have seen it.
If we try to escape our history, we will be doomed to repeat it. If we ignore the pleas of young black men like Orion Anderson, we will be held to harsh judgment.
We got it wrong on women's suffrage, we got it wrong on voting rights. We got it wrong on segregation, we got it wrong on interracial marriage, and we got it wrong last week on the #ERA.
Virginia is one of the capitals of the Confederacy. We have a dark and painful history of slavery, defending it, and then creating a different "peculiar institution" to perpetuate it. https://t.co/0SIHKTQNOG

The Republican resolution was nothing but a piece of propaganda. It does no one any good. I can't cite to it in a brief arguing discriminatory impact. Positing that women already enjoy quality is an insult to our collective intelligence.		#RememberInNovember	#ERANow
Because our Constitution does not guarantee equality on the basis of sex, we've had to fight these inequalities one at a time. Which is kind of like cutting the leaves off a weed while leaving its roots intact.
The VA GOP thought a resolution declaring all Virginians already enjoy equal protection under the law would be sufficient.		News flash: They don't. 		We're trying to amend the Constitution, not issue a press release.
This same voter yesterday also told me, "If we don't learn from the mistakes of the past, we'll keep repeating them."		That is abundantly clear today.
Here in Virginia, we've gotten it wrong for a long time.		We got it wrong on the Civil War.	We got it wrong on segregation.	We got it wrong on suffrage.	We got it wrong on interracial marriage.	We got it wrong on disallowing women into VMI.	Today, we got it wrong again on #ERA.
I spoke to a voter yesterday who told me, "We keep voting against people, but we never vote for the people." 		His words will stick with me. If an elected official can't act in the interest of 50.8% of the population, that official is not acting for the people.

Immigration restriction enables white nationalist terrorism.	People are not a line item on a balance sheet.	Cruelty is weakness. Weakness of mind, weakness of intellect, weakness of policy.		It's time to take it back. Enough is enough./
Offensive Framing:		Merit-based means privileged.	Border security means militarization.	Killing due process at the border is the real illegal immigration.	Immigration detention is incarceration.	Family residential centers are baby jails.
Positive Framing:		Aspiring American.	Border prosperity.	Family-based merit.	Exchange immigration.	Welcoming.	Come as you are.	Humanity has intrinsic merit.	Compassion is strength.
Then turn up the fight. Offense is the best defense here. We can't compromise on the backbone of democracy. But we're losing the war if we use their language, their terminology, their ideology.
It's not just a wall: it's a power grab. More dangerous than any wall is a single man's ability to order one built.		Do you care about due process?	Do you care about the Constitution?	Do you care about separation of powers?
This isn't about economics, nor is it about security. It's a purge. An ugly, racist, ethnic purge.		That our politics have now driven us to the whims of an autocrat willing to decimate all our institutions makes today's "National Emergency" announcement much more serious.
A border works and creates prosperity when ideas, goods, services, and yes: people can move across it. In both directions. In what universe does exchange occur across an impermeable barrier?		Don't drink the Kool-Aid, Dems.
Using watered-down terms like "smart wall" only masks the ugliness of the concept with technology. Lipstick on a pig.		We took the House of Representatives in 2018. There is no need to capitulate to a racist ideology.
I am dismayed once again to see fellow Democrats using the language of the anti-immigrant movement.		Border security is a myth. It's a political term: it means border militarization, nothing more. It's also become a symbol of those who view future Americans as "invading hordes."

But not today. On further review, the officer accepted the waiver and recommended him for approval. He'll be a US citizen in a few weeks.		You'll hear a lot about "merit-based immigration," that we should only let in the best, brightest, privileged and educated English speakers.
Writ large, practices like this shut out people like my client from being able to win their citizenship and vote. That's not acceptable. If I have to sue for these vulnerable people, I will.
That wasn't acceptable. I pointed out the objections lodged by USCIS to the medical waiver had no basis in law, and told the officer I knew the agency had been getting harsher and harsher on these medical waivers to the point of being impossible. Read: lawsuit.
People around him help him do the things he cannot do, like drive. 		We sought a medical waiver for the English and civic test portion of the naturalization process, and USCIS denied it.
We filed for citizenship for this gem of a person. He's struggled his whole life with a condition that prevents him from being able to learn.

The administration's "Buy American Hire American" initiative (which completely ignores that many H-1B holders are themselves aspiring Americans, and their employers are, by definition, American companies) means #H1B premium processing may mean nothing more than speedier denials.
In 4Q 2017, nearly 69% of all H-1B petitions received additional Requests for Evidence (compared with 23% in 3Q 2017). Denial rates continue to soar. Our policies are putting a cap on intelligence, a cap on competition, and a cap on skill. That's no way to achieve prosperity.
It's bad enough a bright graduate has to enter a lottery just to have an H-1B petition accepted (because demand far exceeds the supply). But once accepted, the US Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS) does its level best to find a way to deny the petition.
That's exactly what the current administration is doing. And yes, it's for the same reason they tried to revoke #DACA, kill #TPS, sent troops to the border, and banned Muslims: they don't want people to come here. 		The administration attacks legal immigration.
I've proudly served businesses in Northern Virginia and beyond to help them acquire H-1B visas and stay competitive. It can be hard to find qualified folks. 		#H1B isn't perfect, but needs reform, not made unattainable.

(Posthumous postscript for Phyllis Schlafly: I credit my wife @rabiahmahmed for forcing me to confront my prejudice.)
It's not just because we're dads to our daughters or sons to our mothers.		It's simply the right thing to do.		If racism offends you and sexism doesn't - you got a problem.
Men: Recognize your privilege. Ask yourself what you may have done (or not done) to allow this weed to take root. 		And recognize there's an easy fix. Show up with the majority and demand the ERA be the law of the land.
As a lawyer, I can't wait to write a brief and cite to the Constitution to advocate for a female client.		We have the tools to remove the chokehold of this poisonous weed, if we can first create the tool to uproot it. The ERA gives us that tool.
ou see, because our Constitution does not guarantee equality on the basis of sex, we've had to fight these inequalities one at a time. Which is kind of like cutting the leaves off a weed while leaving its roots intact.
We're talking about basic things like equal pay for equal work, not being discriminated against for being pregnant and well, allowing the survival of our species, or protected from domestic violence.
We cannot ignore the historically unequal place of women in our society. And a legal system that places the burden on women to prove it without taking that historical inequality into consideration is faulty.		It must be fixed. #ERANow
Women seeking redress for laws that hurt them are required to clear insurmountable proof. It gets tricky, in the absence of a guarantee of equal rights, to strike down a law that doesn't discriminates on its face, but harms only women.
This metaphor helps us understand why we need the ERA.		Over 70% of Americans believe equal rights are already guaranteed to women in the Constitution, the root of our law. They are shocked to learn they aren't.
Those who exist where the air is pure don't see what goes on underneath: entire communities choked off from prosperity.		We've fought back. We've passed laws that snip away at the leaves and vines. It's not enough. To truly choke these weeds out, we need to cut it from its roots.
Inequality is a disease that grows like a poisonous weed. It sprouts throughout communities, stifling growth, killing fruits of labor and hiding blossoms of prosperity. It blots out disinfectant sunlight, letting parasites of greed and selfishness thrive under its dark cover.
I've spent the last 15 years practicing immigration law, always driven by a sense of justice for the oppressed. I've fought Violence Against Women Act cases, asylum cases for victims of DV, and never once thought, hey! There are some serious legal impediments for women.
As a man I'm ashamed I only recently became aware of this struggle which is nearly 100 years old. That as a law student, I ignored the feeling when I first read that sex-based classifications weren't entitled to the strict spotlight reserved for race-based classifications.
First, I'm a man. I'm also running for office in Virginia, a state poised to be the 38th and final state to ratify this amendment and make it a part of the Constitution. I'm also a lawyer, and a huge fan of equality.		I read @JessicaNeuwirth's book "Equal Means Equal."
Confused about the Equal Rights Amendment, or #ERA?		Maybe you think women already have equal rights. What rights are missing? What can't a woman do in the US? We're much better off than women in other countries that have equality in the Constitution. 		Why do we need the ERA?

Imagine a headline years hence: "Virginia Recognized As Most Welcoming State, Sets Example for the Nation."		How do we get there?

My job as a candidate is to provide a platform to have them. We must first know our history, and then correct how we think about it.		This isn't revisionist history: putting up Confederate statues is. 		https://t.co/V1FCtgyFa9
These narratives are a toxic smog that obfuscate even the best-intentioned efforts to make sure everybody has a chance to make it.		The best medicines are usually bitter. If we truly want to take our county, commonwealth, and country forward, we must heed the pleas from the past.
Policy begins with people. We need to listen, and get uncomfortable. Entire narratives exist to comfortably insulate ourselves from injustices: "They're criminals. We have to protect ourselves. Some might be good people, but do we ever really know? Why can't they fix themselves?"

I became a candidate because I want to show up. I have to show up. Building a better commonwealth and country? This is just getting started. We're not near done.		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
Everyone contributed - paying parking fees, delivering gourmet meals, bringing office supplies, translating, canvassing the crowds, or providing a shoulder to cry on. We are truly our best when we show up.		And we're our worst when we don't remember. #HolocaustMemorialDay
The most powerful lesson from Dulles was that immediate, collective shout: "No, we're not going to accept this." From people who showed up for another community for no reason other than it was the right thing to do. 		#NoBanNoWall
I didn't go to school for any of this, but necessity is the mother of invention and, perhaps, inspiration.
I briefed Gov. McAuliffe on what happened at Dulles and some recommendations for bettering our Commonwealth. Later, he appointed me to the VA Asian Advisory Board, and still later, the Commission on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the wake of the terror in Charlottesville.
I feel the weight of that responsibility.		I needed to connect with people, activists, advocates, policymakers. I needed to understand the narratives and counternarratives. So I shifted the trajectory of my small practice. Advocacy became part of our baseline representation.
It happened in my lane. I knew the origin of the policy: hate. I had to do something, or forever regret it. No more comfort zones, no more complacency.		I recognized my privilege as a practicing lawyer, in good health, with a family and a community behind me.
My mind that night raced to stories of my clients who sought refuge here, running from broken systems, laws that didn't work, and the stress of uncertainty. We got a mere glimpse, and looking back, that's the night I realized I couldn't continue to trust this system.
Dulles was a collective shout: "No, we're not going to accept this."		I penned the below thoughts the next day, still going through the shock of seeing the system of law I had proudly worked in dissolve with the stroke of a Presidential pen. https://t.co/aSkHyt57ix
The chants welcoming refugees. The multilingual signs, the law firm that grew organically out of the arrivals hall. And my colleagues who dropped everything to rush to Dulles. We did better than "access to counsel:" we brought counsel to those who needed it, when they needed it.
I remember the heroes that showed up at Dulles and beyond. The ones who didn't have relatives or clients who'd be impacted by banishment from our country, but showed up anyway. The man who yelled "Welcome to America!" to everyone who walked through the int'l arrival doors.
Lots of thoughts running through my head today, the 2nd anniversary of the #MuslimBan .		My daughter who asked me "Why does he hate Muslims?" on seeing the future President call to shut down Muslim immigration. She dismissed him: 'He doesn't need to be part of the conversation.'

We really can erase this shameful blot from our histories.
3. Be proudly compassionate, for compassion is a competitive exercise.		4. Speak truth to power. Complacency is what allows bad ideas to take root. Call out the bad idea generators, and starve them of oxygen.		5. Show up for other communities. Pick at least one.
1. Mind your language: Use inclusionary terms like us, aspiring American, diversify, empower. Avoid terms that malign and divide.		2. Think of a society where people's backgrounds are not just tolerated, they are embraced, melded into one's identity.
That's a task that can take a whole generation, but we have to do it.		We can do both. We've spent 2 years researching how one hate movement, the anti-immigrant movement, was nurtured. 		I have a few suggestions to get us going.
But we need to be a little more cerebral about this. Trump just regurgitated words he heard. But they were effective words because decades of thought and money went into them.		We desperately need a new narrative or we'll be relegated to a lifetime of putting out racist fires.
We who believe in quaint ideas like due process and equality have spent the bulk of our professional lives since that night at the nation's airports scrambling to put out fires caused by bad ideas. We raced to the border. We spoke, we wrote, we advocated, we sued.
It's white nationalism, which isn't known for its great ideas. But the idea stuck because it was repeated, playing on people's prejudices, permeating political discourse until it became policy.		But there was no alternative given. We just called it what it was: a bad idea.
Our federal government reopens, albeit for 3 weeks. On the second anniversary of his first #MuslimBan, Trump &amp; Co. suffer a humiliating loss.		No wall. (And we'll end the ban soon, too.)		This all started with a bad idea: that a wall was necessary to stop an invasion.

Tucker, what happened to you man?		Now you invite Tanton-fan Krikorian onto your show and tell him you're rooting for him?		What changed since 1997? Do you or do you not support eugenics and infanticide as a method of immigration control?
Tucker didn't seem to share those views, at least in 1997. This is his piece published in the @WSJ on 10/2/1997:		https://t.co/Hct9s9Xx4w		In 1997, Tucker thought population control methods like infanticide and passive eugenic breeding were wrong. He wasn't afraid back then.

A big part of it is stopping our state tax dollars from being wasted on agencies like ICE, rejecting overcriminalization, and focusing on empowerment.
https://t.co/g7vEJOuBUq		We need to scale this initiative - very similar to the work done by the Commission on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion that I've served on for the past year - across the Commonwealth.
Today I was invited by @TheCIFva to talk immigration at the state level. But first, we heard from Capt Dean Lay from @FairfaxCountyPD about One Fairfax, an initiative to ensure county policies are inclusive, engender trust with LEA's, and eliminate racial disparity in impact. https://t.co/VDK57uLnR1

@NAudrey_ST Thank you so much. That means a lot to me.
That's what we're offering. It's real. It tastes really good.		More importantly, Mr. President, it is what lies ahead. You've got nothing.		#OneLove
Progressive Democrats have been establishing a vision of a compassionate, cooperative America where everyone has a chance to make it, where laws empower and protect, instead of beat down and banish.		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
I decided to run for office in my own backyard because I know that blowing down that house of cards is going to take effort at all levels. Immigration policy may originate in Washington, but they affect people through state law.
Here's my answer: No. You can fool some people some time, but you can't fool all the people all the time. https://t.co/aSLKBXCpUH
Move over. It's a new day. Your house of cards is falling. You might not see the writing on the wall, but I do. Millions do. Do you think we're foolish enough to buy into your scam crisis? We didn't graduate from Trump University.
But nothing he said tonight - nothing - is new. They've had 2 years to make America great again, and here he is, begging for our money.		They've had 40+ years to hone these deportation policies, and here he is, admitting he can't do it.
...ignores the plight of the forcibly displaced, mischaracterizes the law as a "loophole," laughably posits the wall will either pay for itself or be indirectly paid for by Mexico, or (and this was my favorite) how he actually admits that he can't deport everyone.
I could say a lot more: how asylum seeking is legal immigration (see 8 USC 1158); how obnoxious it is that Trump tried to drive a wedge between immigrants and black people, how he cherry picks data, employs dehumanizing slurs orders of magnitude worse than motherf****er...
Trump said the shutdown could end with a 45 minute meeting. It could end in 45 seconds if he'd listen to reason and abandon the silly wall. History lesson, Donald: All walls fall.
They *made* it expensive. If there's an immigration crisis, it's their fault. Who's "they?" The anti-immigrant movement, and those who've drunk their Kool-Aid.
They have deliberately sabotaged our immigration system, devolving it into a lumbering dinosaur, then whine about the system being broken. They've forced spending billions of our tax dollars detaining and deporting for decades, then whine about the cost of "illegal" immigration.
The anti-immigrant movement may be very inventive in coming up with new ways to keep people they don't like downtrodden. But they don't have anything new to offer for our generation.
Because - simply - it's nothing new. It's the same old tired alarm, played on the world's most annoying siren. "We must stop the invasion!"
Terms like "border security," "criminal alien," "illegal alien" and coopted terms like "migrant," "chain migration" and "national security."		So why would I thank him?
Thank you to the President for the #TrumpAddress tonight. I'm quite serious. Unlike him, I can see the writing on the wall.		I've been knee deep in the racist origins of our immigration policy for quite some time and seen how they clothe bigotry with easier to swallow terms.

I am committed to keeping up this fight in Richmond. We all have to show up for one another. Let's start by making sure everyone has a chance.		Ask yourself: how will you use your privilege?		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
That means the fight starts at home, right in the community I've lived in for 12 years with my wife and children. If we would just be aware of those who are desperately trying to participate fully, if we would just show up for them, then our community will be that much stronger.
American children wondering whether their parents will be gone without warning when they get home from school. Sure, immigration laws originate 30 miles away in Washington. But the effect comes through Richmond.
My response: because much of what my clients have to deal with are state laws. Laws like getting a driver's license. Or send their kids to school. Or not having to constantly look over their shoulder, dodging deportation land mines placed in unavoidable aspects of everyday life.
I've spent 15 years fighting for the rights of aspiring Americans, 12 of those years  right here in northern Virginia.		I've been asked, "What's an immigration lawyer doing running for the state house when it's more of a federal issue?"

Let us work to ensure no one is denied that light. Those are our core values as Virginians, as Americans, and as human beings. That compassion must be where our policy begins: do not fall for the lie that compassion is weakness.		It is strength.
Please take a moment to remember these families today. Remember the universal respect for human dignity. Remember they are us.		Feeling close to family tonight? Remember that warm glow, so pronounced on a festive day like Christmas.
Tonight, entire families hunker down in a tent city not a hundred yards from where this picture was taken, their futures deliberately made cruelly uncertain, and still our government throws up more walls of bureaucracy designed to break the spirit under a huge "closed" sign. https://t.co/VJ4z7BYLeF
The picture is from my trip to Tijuana in August when I spent a few days advising asylum seekers. I am standing on the Mexican side, but technically inside the US.		Here, hope and despair run feverishly as two turbulent rivers, each vying for victory in these roaring rapids.

This is an example of championing the rights of Virginians who need it. I am proud to support our Attorney General for his tireless efforts to protect the people of the Commonwealth.		Thank you Mark!
AG Herring brings Virginia into a multistate demand that the court either clarify what it meant, or stay (pause) its ruling until higher courts have had the chance to consider the decision on the merits.		Read the Intervening Defendants' brief:		https://t.co/KPtDFpETFt
This is unacceptable. There is a right to be healthy, and government attempts to shirk that obligation are both shameful and misguided. Adding mass confusion to the exercise of people's rights to access that healthcare is even more noxious.		#Obamacare	#HealthCareForAll
The merits of that decision will eventually percolate through the court system, but more troubling is that *no one knows* for sure what effect it has on existing enrollment. And it came out mere hours before the open enrollment period ended.

You don't get to disregard the law just because you're afraid of who might benefit.		The fight to protect due process is everywhere: on our border, at our airports, and yes, right here in Virginia. This is where we begin to re-empower our communities, right in our own backyard.
It has to stop, at all levels. I had flashbacks to that first night at Dulles, where officials said they didn't accept orders from outside judges.		We must zealously protect #DueProcess - the right to tell one's story - at all levels. Families depend on it. Lives depend on it.
But this is what happens when due process breaks down. The judge simply didn't want to grant it to him. So he denied it without giving a reason.		This is happening in the United States of America, right in our own borders.
Yes, it does.		When gang members come and kill off two of your brothers, one after another, then beat and rape two of your sisters, both of whom make it to the US and were allowed to apply for asylum, then you have a claim, too.
Without quoting a single case, despite our 7pg brief explaining the law, the judge denied the case. My client's tears and trembling voice did not move him, because "lots of people come here from El Salvador with stories like yours, but that doesn't qualify you for asylum."
Today I was reminded why I'm running for office.		I got off the phone today with a judge who denied my client, headed for Virginia, the chance to apply for asylum.		His case was a slam dunk, especially after a nationwide injunction issued earlier today.
What's an immigration lawyer doing running for the Virginia state house?		Because empowerment starts at home.		Follow our campaign #Hassan4VA on FB:		https://t.co/cqfCg8riUs
It's up to all of us to show up for one another. Next time, it could be you.		This is why I'm running for office in #VA87. I'm showing up to fight for our community, the way the community showed up when its members were threatened.		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
And today, I call out the opportunistic bigots who've been fomenting at the mouth at America's magnificent diversity. I call out the elected "leaders" who gorge themselves on a diet of division. I call out the prison-industrial complex for profiting from human incarceration.
Today, I honor my parents, displaced in the Partition of India. I honor the clients from 115 countries I've served for 15 years, many right here in Virginia. I honor our lawmakers, advocates, teachers, and men &amp; women in uniform who have fought to protect freedom of movement.

So often, this battle is just about getting up one more time than you're knocked down. And #fightingforfamilies never gets old.
Only one thing kept the fire going: family. The rest of his family was here. Not being able to be in touch, the barrier of air travel, lack of visas - this puts stress on the rest of the family unit. Now, he can be with them.
We had to sue the Department of State to spur action on this case, stuck in "administrative processing" since 2006. My client, a brand-new Virginia resident, told me he had all but given up hope - what was the point in coming to America for the first time when you're past 50?
Today my entire firm received the most thoughtful gifts from a Virginia family reunited after a 12 year wait in immigration limbo. My client specifically chose this piece because, as she said, "You bring families together" and insisted that we keep it for our office https://t.co/cpYai098pi

We need more than just a reliably Democratic vote. We need an advocate to work within the system - but only as long as the system is working for us. If not, we bring the community together and change it.
I'm running in District 87 (eastern Loudoun/northern Prince William Co's) because I want to continue the fight to protect the rights of the marginalized and to fight for our values as Virginians, just as I've done for the past 15 years as an attorney.		https://t.co/HNDWH42tu3

That night shifted the direction of my legal practice. I walked into Dulles a lawyer, but walked out an advocate. Today, I'm a candidate: I'm showing up.		https://t.co/q5Jm6wvmi5
The ban may have eventually taken effect, albeit in a weaker form, but I have no doubt that if we keep showing up for one another, the hateful ban will be relegated to the dustbin of history.
But most of the crowd was neither. They didn't have clients or relatives who would be detained or banned, but they came out in droves. They were the real heroes, because they showed up when it mattered most.
Thankfully, the crowds who showed up didn't listen to that message. I was moved by them. I was an immigration attorney, and a Muslim - of course I had to be there. https://t.co/E3RjBNoDNh
I had flashbacks to my clients' stories of persecution from their homelands: where laws only sometimes work. The subsequent torrent of hate from DC against fellow Americans, aspiring and otherwise, sent a message all too familiar to marginalized communities: "Stay in your place."
But when I heard crowds demanding "Let them see their lawyers!" the words "due process!" and officers saying they don’t accept orders from “outside” judges - something flipped inside my head. 		Suddenly, the confidence that comes from working in a system for 15 years evaporated.
The night of the first #travelban nearly two years ago, I went to Dulles Airport as a volunteer immigration lawyer. I figured some local know-how would help.

That's right, 2 years of open hate has steeled my resolve. The spike in hate crimes steeled my resolve. The de jure suspicion on my people steeled my resolve.		I hope you'll help.		If we are successful, that would be one American ideal I wish we'd export.
You hear what I'm saying? Diversity is good; disorder is not. Our country is a cross-section of humanity like no other. We have a unique opportunity to work on a common purpose.
If you had an option, consider yourself lucky: many people didn't. If you don't have an option, stop resenting people who did.		Stop blaming other immigrants and put the blame where it belongs: on the system.
So dear immigrants: stop wondering why the Central American kids get work permits while you've waited 10 years for a green card in line.		Stop thinking that your lengthy wait to bring your fiancée over gives you a soapbox to decry illegal immigration.
The Syrian and the Salvadorean weeping with joy after simply getting the chance to work. The Sunni who married a Shia and raised his daughters Shia.		The Ghanaian who couldn't stop talking about Afghan kabob.
I wish I could show you what I see. The Iranian who loved when I paid cash with bills folded the way common in West Africa (four bills with the fifth folded over; aids in counting).		The Latino who responded to my broken Spanish in broken Urdu.
Prejudice may be an easy way of comprehending the world around us, but it's a cop-out. These prejudices are a Godsend to those who benefit from a platform of division.		So STOP IT.
An Ivorian blaming Burkinabé for the accession of Ouattara, and a Burkinabé with similar contempt for Ivorians.		A Congolese miffed when I asked which Congo she was from. 		A Bolivian mestizo complained about a fellow Quechua Bolivian: "They always victimize themselves."
A Saudi businessman gleeful that a bunch of Filipino workers could be hired at "$200 - $300 a month."		A Ghanaian who assured me that another Ghanaian was lying because she could tell the man's tribal affiliation from the shape of his head.
An educated Pakistani woman once told me, "We tried to help her, but you know how those Spanish people are," referring to a proud Latina. 		A Turk self-righteously complained to me once about all the "black guys smoking weed" across the hall.
This is not going to be popular. But I want to talk to immigrants for a minute.		Over the nearly 15 years I've practiced immigration law, I've heard prejudiced statements - from my own clients - that would fit right in to what we've been hearing over the past 2 years.

3. Compassion is strength, while cruelty is weakness. It may be complex to process all those asylum claims, but it's necessary. Helping asylum seekers is not mutually exclusive of helping already-citizens. 		We are our best when we stand up for each other as human beings.
2. What kind of country do we want to be? Will we take in and empower the few who come, while helping stabilize their home countries, or do the shortsighted and misguided thing and close off the border, succumbing to racism?		This is about WHO WE ARE and who we want to be.
Why you should care:		1. Attacks on asylum seekers is a part of the administration's unchecked executive power. If they can do it to asylum seekers, they'll do it to other aspiring citizens, the sick, the poor, the disenfranchised.		It's an attack on #ChecksAndBalances.
Myth: Asylum must be sought in the first safe country after leaving home.		Reality: There is no such law. And the United States guarantees the right to apply in the US. There may be other bars that may be applicable, but that doesn't affect the right to apply.
Myth: Asylum seekers are illegally immigrating.		Reality: Asylum seeking is not only perfectly legal, it is a human right. 		There is no right to asylum, but there is a right to seek it.
Myth: Asylum seekers are economic migrants from failed states.		Reality: Any person who is forcibly displaced should (and often does) have a case for asylum. The law must (and does) provide a guarantee of the right to at least try.
Myth: Asylum is only for political persecution, not for fear of gangs and terrorists.		Reality: There is NO requirement in the law that an asylum seeker's fear be politically based.		I've won many gang and terrorist related cases.
Myth: Asylum seekers must present themselves at a port of entry.		Reality: The law (8 USC 1158) specifically says a person may apply for asylum whether they enter legally or not. 		They can be technically prosecuted for unlawful entry, but that doesn't prevent asylum.
Top Myths About #Asylum and why you should care:		Myth: Asylum seekers should file at US consulates in their home countries.		Reality: Asylum can only be sought at the border or inside the US. US consulates do not accept asylum applications. https://t.co/3fjyHRhHL9

Emblematic of the ignorance we face. The pub charge rule makes lawful immigration unlawful. Has little to do with being here illegally, though the right seems to think all immigration is about that only.		And if undocumented left, the cost of everything would rise. https://t.co/AKFJZeXbVN
RT @Alyssa_Milano: This thread. Right now. This one. 🖤 https://t.co/OA0vCCy7zc
Share this link with healthcare advocates - this is NOT just an immigration issue.		The 116th Congress is going to be very different from the 115th. It sits in January. It would be great to hold their feet to the fire.		Act now.
We need to blast the site with high quality comments. Here's an easy way:		https://t.co/FQ6iq7Unm4		Your comment will be auto-filed. So tell a story. Talk about why it's a bad idea to scare people out of good healthcare. That affects us all, current or future American.
Tell someone's story for them. Affected immigrants are scared into silence, since you have to leave your name when commenting. Silence only means a quicker rollout. 		Comments must be considered; they become part of the record, and can be cited in subsequent legal challenges.
It is a duty and an honor to use your voice for those who don't have one. The public charge rule will affect millions of people, including those who *are* entitled to these benefits. It will make people sick. It is emphatically a public health issue.
That same day, there was a confirmation hearing for Ronald Vitiello as the new head of #ICE. @SenGaryPeters (D-MI) grilled Vitiello about his connections with FAIR, John Tanton's group. 		Imagine if we called them all out. That's only going to happen if we engage our lawmakers.
They ate it up. Some weren't very familiar with the public charge rule. Others knew about it, but were shocked at the stats we provided, and the stories we told. They appreciated we gave them not only facts but messaging. 		Peter and I made a good team!
I told them we need stronger pushback against the source of these horrific policies, telling them about my lawsuit to unseal the #TantonPapers.		I asked each one, "I want to see your boss take charge in the Senate come January, and hold these organizations' feet to the fire."
They are so afraid the law will change the day after (it won't) and they're scared "The Government" will accuse them of taking a benefit they are now not entitled to. (A breast pump is perfectly ok, by the way.)
10.5 million children will be affected by the public charge rule, 9 out of 10 of whom are citizens of the United States. 		Meanwhile, I told the staffers about how my clients are urging me to file their cases by December 10, the day the public comment period closes.
We spent about 1/2 hour with each office's staffers (except Merkley, with whom were honored to spent some 1-on-1 time) and Peter shared stories of constituents, the precipitous 300K drop in ACA enrollments compared with this time last year, and went through the stats:
Peter's a rockstar, so he got meetings with:		@JeffMerkley (D-OR)	@SenAngusKing (D-ME)	@SenSchumer (D-NY)	@ChrisMurphyCT (D-CT)	@EdMarkey (D-MA)	@KamalaHarris (D-CA)	@SenFeinstein (D-CA)	@SenWhitehouse (D-RI)	@SenatorLeahy (D-VT)	@DougJones (D-AL)		(No GOP office accepted.)
The 400+ page rule silently hacks out yet another path to deportation for millions - so the people it affects are generally scared to talk.		Peter and I saw that this was an intersection of healthcare and immigration advocacy, and we decided to tell senators about it.
Because an immigrant mother with a breast pump paid for by WIC for her US citizen baby will fear that our government will deport her. So, her baby suffers. 		This rule will be particularly harsh on pregnant and breastfeeding women, and children.		https://t.co/1tzxM7ISc2
There is a rule being proposed called the "public charge rule." It vastly expands the types of public benefits that an immigrant seeking a green card is barred from - to the point that it becomes a public health issue. 		Here's the rule - all 400+ pages:		https://t.co/FApSEykBku

6. To those who are already American, whether by birth or otherwise: question any rule that excludes. Would it have kept.your ancestors out?		Then it's probably not a good rule. The law isn't as settled as most people think.
5. This is NOT how our system should work. The best thing I can do as a lawyer is to push for a system that leaves me out of a job.		We have to build on compassion, which is a strength.		Too easy to just say, "shut it down." That's weakness.
3. I had to disabuse several people of well intentioned but bad or lacking advice. Please. Seek correct advice. You'll never know what else turns up.		4. There were traps built in: one thing that goea wrong could details an entire case, eg. 1 year bar for asylum. 		Be careful.
Takeaways:		1. The system REQUIRES you to get not only the right advice, but at the right time. Mess either one up, and you'll lose.		2. Fear and trauma make it hard to have the mind to seek that advice. I thank my clients for coming to see me: in many cases, it's a huge step.
6. Naturalization, but with a wrinkle. Client was afraid to become a citizen. On review, I determined we had an argument to iron out the wrinkle and we'll file.		Should be one more vote by 2020.
5. Client threatened if she didn't become MS-13 girlfriend. Wound up falsely accused of a crime, with police/MS conspiracy. Judge now in jail. On release, gang stepped up threats, targeting her son, forcing her to flee.		Family as a social group works for asylum.
4. Brother won asylum with one judge, but even though second brother has same case, and even more evidence, his judge is different and might not agree. Plus, laws are being changed which render case uncertain.		There just aren't any bets with asylum-when govt allows you to file
Green card holder wants to sponsor fiance but fiance ineligible for a visa until 2020. 		No matter, we can start processing now and yes, we disclose and advocate why he will be eligible. Key issue: starting process at the right time to avoid unnecessary delays.
2. Client unsure whether atypical arrangement with fiancee would survive immigration scrutiny.		Answer: Maybe, but since no other option, have to *push* the case through, and not take no for an answer. No black and white answers...typical for immigration cases we see.
Tales from an Immigration Lawyer: selections from recent consults:		1. Client deathly afraid of what family will do when find out about being gay.		Was able to give a modicum of security: case was in good posture and there was a Plan B I could articulate.

@ifindkarma @ManInTheHoody @woodruffbets VERY interesting question.
Abe on the School Board can only mean good things for Loudoun County - far into the future.		If you live in Loudoun County, vote for #HonestAbe!		And donate to his campaign!		https://t.co/vx7UGRjiIS
Because of that one act, I've been able to help thousands of aspiring Americans on their path to citizenship.		Abe couldn't have known that would happen, but he did it because he knows the value in connecting people and getting things done. That's his MO.
Abe was the first person I met when I moved to the DMV in 2003, a young jobless lawyer. He connected me to Anu Kmt, the first lawyer who took the time to teach me the ropes of practicing law and got me over the fear of hanging out a shingle right out of law school.

She has a forward looking vision for her community, and has supported #AspiringAmerican communities. She's reached out to me personally to get stories of the roadblocks my clients face, and advocated for policies to remove them.		Keep your head up. Last night was a *beginning.*
My next candidate I'm supporting? Another Jennifer. This time, it's @JenniferBoysko, currently a delegate (H-86), who will be running for the state Senate seat vacated by Wexton last night.
We don't just celebrate diversity, but use, employ, and harness it to create prosperity.		I'm going to continue to advocate for the disenfranchised and work to give these communities a voice and a chance to contribute, lest I be asked one day what I did with my privilege.
Celebrate the House takeback. Let the euphoria wash over you so you can hook back into it during the road ahead. Because this #BlueWave isn't over. 		As for me, I'm going to continue with even firmer resolve, to make my country into a microcosm of humanity.
Our biggest enemy is complacency, not Trumpism. It was complacency that led to our heavy losses in 2010, redrew the maps, and is at least partially to blame for last night's strengthening of Trump's party's hold on the Senate.
But the losses in the Senate, and the high profile races in Texas, Georgia, and Florida is a reminder that the blue wave didn't overwhelm all the protectionist walls erected by the GOP.		Still, keep your head up.
Last night was a mixed bag. Here in Virginia, it was exhilarating to watch @JenniferWexton, @SpanbergerVA07 and @ElaineLuriaVA flip three seats and help take the House. There was a clear message of repudiation of Trumpism - voter engagement was at record levels.

@DutchDelights13 @retreaver This. If only more people would direct their frustration against the system instead of other immigrants!
If your idea of American is threatened by people like me who love this country, then perhaps your idea of American isn't as complete as you thought.		Maybe America is bigger than you. I acknowledge it's bigger than me.
It's time to confront the changing face of America.		Ask bicultural people like me. We feel at home in different cultures, but if we leave the US, we're American, and only American.		Funny that only other Americans don't consider us American.
Even the racists themselves acknowledge this.		When you peel back the layers, there's always a fear of what America will look like with all these different people here.		This, unfortunately, is a core tenet of white nationalism. Check it.
Maybe you buy the Skittles theory...3 poisoned Skittles in a bowl, would you grab a handful.		Which I guess means we should ban all cars due to highway fatalities.		Maybe you just don't think we need more immigration. But refugees are a tiny trickle of people.
No? Still worried about an terrorist or gang member hopping aboard the asylum express?		First, that would be the worst way to come. Risk getting called out? Presenting before an officer? Why would a hardened criminal seek to immigrate so legally?
So even though it should be obvious that people generally drive economic growth, racist laws disenfranchise them and make them liabilities. Then they're derided as a drain on the system.		What if we empowered them to contribute? Would the #MigrantCaravan be ok then?
Well, the problem is, actual racists are the ones who came up with the "job stealing criminal" narrative.		They knew they needed to wrap their racism into something that goes down easier.		Because no one wants to admit they're racist.
Show of hands:		Does the #MigrantCaravan make you feel a little uneasy but you're afraid to say anything because you don't want to be seen as racist?		Do you find yourself thinking about it in terms of jobs and national security?

@jonfman Thank you for your kind words!
RT @jonfman: Very important thread on negative effects of calling for revoking birthright.		As usual, @HMAesq is extraordinarily insightful…
4. Lawyers: Read up on 8 USC 1503. Gives the right to sue if a privilege or right of citizenship is denied. We will NOT have a country with classes of citizenship.		5. Call out journalists who provide prime airtime to white nationalists. Let them gab in their own echo chambers.
1. Vote, dammit. TAKE IT ALL BACK. The House, the Senate. The country. Make sure other vote.		2. Make our elected officials speak: US citizenship has to mean something.		3. Mess with the 14th, mess with the 2nd.
Now, each of these deplorable actions would draw legal challenges - but it's not as "slam dunk" as a wholesale repeal of the 14th Amendment.		Trump's remarks amount to an Overton window shifting, and that is a very real damage to our discourse.		How to fight back?
Refuses to confer a benefit, like a US citizen child filing for an out-of-status parent, while allowing that child to retain their US passport? Harassing them on re-entry into the United States after foreign travel? Suppressing their vote?
4. Even if the EO never sees the light of day, there are many ways to "deny" citizenship without revoking it. Ultimately, citizenship is a bundle of rights that is supposed to respected by a government of the people.		What if the government fails to respect it?
Lost in the tussle is the fact that if the 14th Amendment can be so easily manipulated, so can the 2nd. The more we talk about it, the greater the chance it'll make it to the Supreme Court, and although I'd predict a 9-0 strikedown, he'll still make someprogress. Why? Because:
3. Trump likes to float theories around to see what sticks. There's no indication he'll sign such an order (and the timing! 6 days before midterms) but part of the damage is he forces a debate on birthright citizenship.
As late as April 2016, one of Tanton's groups wrote "The Supreme Court has never ruled on the question of whether children born to tourists are to be considered U.S. citizens at birth."		They've been foaming at the mouth about the 14th Amendment and its guarantee of equality.
I've been singularly focused on unsealing the #TantonPapers.  John Tanton was the white nationalist founder of the organizations currently informing US immigration policy. Guess what? He wasn't a fan of the 14th Amendment. Here's a letter he penned in 1975: https://t.co/cBTBUFy67x
2. This isn't "conservative" or an "alternative viewpoint" or a "minority position." It's white nationalism. It's about racial purity, not economics or national security. Let's not be afraid to call this what it is.
And there is now a denaturalization task force to revoke citizenship of certain naturalized citizens. Certainly, these attacks on US citizens are part of the administration's relentless attacks on all Americans, aspiring or otherwise.		https://t.co/G8h5HQ2S0b
1. American citizenship is being devalued. If it can be revoked or reinterpreted by mere executive order, it's less valuable than a Costco membership. 		Remember: the admin has denied passports to (mostly) Latinos born in the US but near the border.		https://t.co/DL7ubKADYr
Emperor Trump thinks he can end #birthrightcitizenship by executive order.		Short answer: No.	Long answer: No, no, no.		This is such a ridiculous proposal that it's not worth spilling ink explaining. But there are dangers here.

It appears she would rather spend taxpayer money detaining and deporting people, instead of empowering them to fight toward lawful status and be able to achieve prosperity.		Yet she claims to represent the best interests of #VA10.		No thanks. We need a new vision. That's Wexton.
Her prior record as a Virginia legislator isn't any better. She voted to burden state police with determining citizenship status of arrestees, and also to bar undocumented immigrants from enrolling in public universities.		Comstock is not what Virginia needs.
In response to the horrors of children being ripped from their parents, and subsequent reports of sexual abuse of children, Comstock's response was to write a letter to Jeff Sessions and others seeking "clarification on how this Administration makes those determinations."
She joined white nationalist @SteveKingIA by voting to bar them from enlisting in the US military, and prohibiting federal funding from being used to reapply for DACA (deferred action)		She has supported wasting our money on the ridiculous border wall.
Despite her persistent and curious claims that @JenniferWexton wants to let gang members into Virginia, she voted in favor of freeing ICE to detain and deport anyone, without prioritization for the dangerous ones. 		That makes us all LESS safe.
Here's why I, as an immigration lawyer and #VA10 resident, believe we've moved past Comstock. She has succumbed to the race-baiting GOP party line. She can't be seen as true Republican if she doesn't conflate the entire Latino community with MS-13.

@miss_speech Yes. Some cling to some fantasy that Trump will somehow betray them all in the end, and only used them to get into office. I don't think Trump has the capacity to cling to an ideology other than his own self-aggrandizement, but he has opened the doors wide open for this poison.
We need to understand how pervasive this ideology is, and understand it (disgusting as it may be) or else we won't know how to excise it from our society.		There is no white genocide.	There is no embattled white minority.		There is, however, a push to normalize white nationalism.
John Tanton, the founder of @FAIRImmigration, was such a pure white nationalist. His groups - the Tanton Hate Networks - are informing US immigration policy. This is why I'm suing to unseal his papers from the University of Michigan.		https://t.co/J9iYu6Xb2s
The bottom line is that Trump is too leftist for pure white nationalists. Please let that sink in.		They can't forgive him allowing Jewish blood into his family. But when you understand they define themselves in terms of perceived racial purity, it makes more sense.
Whether Trump is a white nationalist is the subject of rather robust debate amongst these extremists.		Do they compromise and accept Trump as a "baby step" in the "right" direction, or stand true to their "principles" and hold out for someone like David Duke?
You see, many WN's see Jews as *the* root cause of what they believe is "white genocide."		Everyone else: Muslims, Latinos, other immigrants, black people - are seen as instrumentalities of the Jewish "conspiracy" to wipe out the "White race."		Here's some pure WN thought: https://t.co/TdMfiizEnr
Many of them hate Trump. The #Pittsburgh terror suspect apparently did - boasting that he'd never worn or even touched a #MAGA hat.		But surely they are happy with Trump's rhetoric? So what is it, do they love him or not?		The hatred of Trump is because Jared Kushner is Jewish.
I've called Trump a white nationalist. I think he is one, because he lives, breathes, and feeds off of white nationalist ideology. Whether he personally believes in the tenets of white nationalism doesn't define his white nationalism.		But what do WN purists believe?

@HatimNY Doesn't matter. It's not legally sufficient because the persecution has to be on a protected ground, and being targeted by a gang isn't a protected ground. Being targeted because you are a member of a family, however, is - at least in some Federal circuits.
@scorkren @IngrahamAngle Lol
@fabucat @IngrahamAngle Well, she's either ignorant or lying, then.
Our job is to prove a set of facts and then argue and advocate for approval based on controlling law and precedent. It's lawyering, it's my job, and I'm damn proud to do it.		There is no justice without access to counsel.
So we made sure to ask him to testify not so much about the threats made to him, but the threats made to his father *about* him.		Dragging the story out of a client and making them tell it in a legally sufficient manner is its own art.
Because what qualified our guy for asylum was not that he was in danger himself, but that he was threatened in part because he was his father's son, and since the gangs were after his father as well, they threatened to kill the son if the father didn't pay the war tax.
This case was based on credible death threats by gang members. If he had presented that case, however, the case would have been denied, because simply getting threatened by a gang - regardless of how dangerous - is insufficient to win asylum.
First, these cases are tough, and they're only getting tougher. They have to be built based on a lot of factors that have to work together in exactly the right way. Credibility. Internal/external consistency. Tailored to Board and circuit precedent, and the particular judge.
Lawyers don't coach. We advocate. Period.		Today, a father and daughter were granted asylum. (victories in this administration are much sweeter.)		Ignorant racists like @IngrahamAngle say lawyers coach clients to say the right thing. 		It's NOTHING like that. https://t.co/x2fRr9MXOU

@B52Malmet Kitchen opens 11/6!
Bake a bigger pie instead of fighting over slices. America is the perfect kitchen: we have all the ingredients and tools if we'd just use them as directed.
Starve the gangs. Invest in anti-gang measures to give purpose in life. Cut their supply lines, legalize marijuana to cut them off from the black market. No overnight solutions, but shouldn't we start instead of letting them grow like cancer?
Repurpose our border to create prosperity, not further inequality. Borders are tools - when used correctly, it will empower people that cross it, in whatever direction. A border isn't just "open" and "closed."
Empower our own systems to determine who gets a chance to stay. We spend billions detaining and deporting. Maybe a fraction of that can be used to train more asylum officers.
The problem is the condition that forcibly displaces people, not that those people seek asylum, and certainly not a migrant caravan of people simply trying to make a point.
White nationalism is predicated on an irrational fear of non-white people. The narrative is one of survival, which justifies cruelty. Them or us. Fear and anger cloud vision, which in turn clouds the simple, unvarnished truths:
Let me repeat: a former white nationalist who grew up in the household of one of the leaders of the movement said that what he sees coming out of DC *reminded him of his childhood.*
He said, "They're talking about a fear of what might happen. My dad talked about it all the time: what would happen if we let in all these immigrants. What they're afraid of never happened. It's not happening. But they're afraid it might. That's the narrative they're creating."
He said, the campaign trail and Charlottesville reminded him of his childhood.		Asked him further, what about immigration policy? I was going to tell him about my theories of xenophobia injected by groups like FAIR. But he already knew what I was talking about.
His story of growing up in a household of one of the white nationalist movement's founders was jarring: enduring years of abuse, neglect, hatred...all of which he had to find the tools to overcome.		I asked him, how do you know white nationalism when you see it?
A few months ago I got to meet Kelvin Pierce. He's the son of William Pierce, founder of the white supremacist group the National Alliance, and author of The Turner Diaries.   (It's a racist novel called a "bible of the racist right" cited as inspiration by Timothy McVeigh).
"Horde."	"Invasion."	"Storming the border."	"Mid Eastern terrorists."	"Army."		This is white nationalist framing. No surprise it's coming from the President - we're used to it. But learn to recognize it, call it out, and most importantly: replace it. #MigrantCaravan

Never give up on a right you have. Throw yourself into the fight all the way.
This client made an indelible impression on me. I watched as the news that he could never go home hit him - the moment he realized he was a refugee. 		I'm glad that I was unsuccessful in talking him out of Section 13, because today he's a permanent resident.
The legal standards are different from asylum, but many Sec. 13 applicants may also qualify for asylum. We filed asylum for him as well, of course, given the high denial rate of Sec. 13. I told him he shouldn't take chances on a law that only helps about 5-6 people per year.
Section 13 is a 1957 law that allows former diplomats (and semi-diplomatic personnel) to apply for a green card if they can show compelling reasons why they're unable to return to the country they represented, and that their admission to the US would be in the national interest.
Never give up on a right you have. 		We just won approval of a green card for a client under a little-known program that has a yearly cap of only 50. And usually, the denial rate is so high that even most of the 50 available green cards are unused.

It will grant immigration judges even more leeway to deny - perhaps without a full hearing - or even be denied credible fear, preventing people from even applying for asylum.		This is yet another attack on #DueProcess.		This is NOT who we want to be.
Under this decision, Sessions wants to try remove those duress exceptions.		So a prison guard forced to work and escapes would be sent back to his persecutors. It's one thing if he willingly did it. But disallowing people forced to do dirty work kills the spirit of asylum.
To win asylum, you can't persecute anyone. That makes good sense, of course.		But what if the fear you have is that a persecutor - a gang, a warlord, a terrorist group - forced you to do something for them under threat of torture or death? That changes things, of course.

So who knows how long there will be a way. File now, before it's too late.
Today I talked to a TPS holder married to a US citizen. The law in the 6th and 9th circuits allows him to file directly for a green card. Otherwise, he has to risk leaving and coming back in with a travel document. But there is a way - the clients just didn't know it.
We represent a woman who was brutally abused by her partner. When we got the case, it was a slam dunk asylum claim under Matter of A-R-C-G-,  26 I&amp;N Dec. 388 (BIA 2014).		Sessions vacated that decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I&amp;N Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018). Now her case is much weaker.

@DavidIRamadan Other folks invited to the SCP's workshop include figures like Ann Coulter, disgraced former FBI agent and Islamophobe John Guandolo, and dozens of anti-immigrant restrictionists.		Ramadan keeps interesting company, so his notion of "partisan hackery" is curious.
@DavidIRamadan More interesting is who Dick Black spoke to about Bashar Al-Assad: he was invited to the Social Contract Press's Writer's Workshop.		That's a white nationalist group, started by John Tanton, who believed America must retain a large Euro-American majority to be America. https://t.co/Oq3SKHkpkY
@DavidIRamadan Dick Black is an interesting, anachronistic fossil. 		Of course he imposes male will on women - opposing women in the military, robbing them of their reproductive rights. Rolling back civil rights of gays. He supports the war criminal Bashar Al-Assad.
@DavidIRamadan This 2015 article defines David Ramadan's legacy on immigration. He aligned with Sen. Dick Black (R-Loudoun) to deny in-state tuition to Virginia Dreamers and TPS holders. I guess he'd rather the money be spent detaining them. 		https://t.co/ucHxkepF4G
Comstock must give immigration lawyers and advocates in her district a reason to think otherwise. I want to see her tell her GOP base that she stands with immigrants, that she was wrong to think they should be tracked like FedEx packages.		Vote for @JenniferWexton.
I don't believe she will go to bat for my clients, and that's a serious problem for her in a diverse district like VA-10. On immigration, she only comes off as moderate if the current framing of immigrants as outsiders is accepted.
Will she help my DACA client whose application was denied because she couldn't prove she was here before age 16? 		What about a young aspiring American who wants to serve the country he considers his own? Will she support a person with lawful temporary status to go to school?
With this record, how can I, as a lawyer, send my clients to her office? Will she ask my Latino clients if they've ever been involved in a gang like MS-13? 		What about my asylum clients - will she limit her help to sending a follow-up letter because she's afraid they're lying?
It appears she would rather spend taxpayer money detaining and deporting people, instead of empowering them to fight toward lawful status and be able to achieve prosperity.		Yet she claims to represent the best interests of #VA10.		No thanks.
Her prior record as a Virginia legislator isn't any better. She voted to burden state police with determining citizenship status of arrestees, and also to bar undocumented immigrants from enrolling in public universities (a position championed by David Ramadan and Dick Black.)
In response to the horrors of children being ripped from their parents, and subsequent reports of sexual abuse of children, Comstock's response was to write a letter to Jeff Sessions and others seeking "clarification on how this Administration makes those determinations."
She has attacked Dreamers, joining white nationalist @SteveKingIA by voting to bar them from enlisting in the US military, and prohibiting federal funding from being used to reapply for DACA 		She has supported wasting our money on the ridiculous border wall.
Despite her persistent and curious claims that @JenniferWexton wants to let gang members into Virginia, she voted in favor of freeing ICE to detain and deport anyone, without prioritization for the dangerous ones. 		Partisan hackery, defined.
Comstock succumbed to the race-baiting GOP party line. She can't be seen as true Republican if she doesn't conflate the entire Latino community with MS-13. 	She introduced the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, blazing new trails in the law by making gang members deportable.
Teachable moment: The Overton window has shifted so far to the right that even immigrants like David Ramadan consider speaking out on Comstock's deplorable immigration record "partisan hackery." 		Far from being deceitful, my statement is a product of 15 years of experience. https://t.co/6VEsTGLyhJ

Brendan O'Connor did a deep dive into Tanton, the Colcom Foundation, and how it funded the hate spewing out of the current White House. Longer read, but this is perhaps the best single piece on this shady story.		https://t.co/tp0U0HMlOB
Of course, Colcom follows FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA, and Mark Krikorian (ED of CIS) and Roy Beck (Pres of NUSA).		@shannoncoulter @slpng_giants perhaps you all should be aware of Colcom and its outsized role in funding hate. @splcenter has been reporting on it for years.
Secrecy is part of the game with white nationalists. Tanton donated his papers in a show of transparency to @UMich, but then sealed half of them until 2035. So I filed a lawsuit to unseal them, because Tanton's groups are tied to the current White House.		https://t.co/J9iYu6Xb2s
Between 2005 and 2015, the Colcom Foundation gave Tanton networks at least $108 million.		The Colcom Foundation funds hate, and they're really good at it.		It's curious that they decided to purge their Twitter account (which has less than 30 followers). What are they hiding?
It wasn't just FAIR - the Tanton networks include groups like NumbersUSA and their president Roy Beck. This is the group perhaps most directly responsible for lighting up the switchboards in opposition to comprehensive immigration reform. Here's a letter from 1998: https://t.co/ZH8whJkEvV
Cordy's C.S. May Family Trust has a longstanding relationship with Dr. John Tanton, founder of FAIR, white nationalist, and architect of the anti-immigrant movement. Here's a letter from 1985 from Tanton to the May Trust administrator thanking him for his $100K renewal: https://t.co/W1vinjErZO
What is the Colcom Foundation?		You're about to enter a dark world of the power structure upholding white nationalism. Colcom is short for "Cold Comfort," an estate outside Pittsburgh where Mellon family heiress Cordelia Scaife May, or "Cordy," lived until her suicide in 2005.
The @colcomfdn is the chief funder of the anti-immigrant movement, @FAIRImmigration @NumbersUSA and @CIS_org. Don't be fooled: their "environmentalism" includes viewing immigrants as a threat.		Today I followed them, and they immediately virtually purged their account. https://t.co/aWmKu8fxUv

There are lots of variations, of course. And other advisories that may only apply in a certain case.		But I share this not only to underscore the need for transparency, but to show how the incompetence of the administration exacerbates the fear.		Maybe that's the point.
6. The Jeff Sessions Effect		All laws and cases we rely on to win status for you are subject to attack. Jeff Sessions is ruining the system, vacating or nullifying one precedent at a time.		So get what you can while you still can. The answer usually is not to wait.
5. Extreme Vetting		No, not from the government. From us. USCIS is becoming more and more unforgiving of any error. What used to be fixable may now result in a denial and a one way ticket to a deportation hearing. 		Be extra careful.
4. Special Targets		There are some types of visas and statuses this government just doesn't like:		H-1B's	L-1A's	Asylum	TPS	DACA		In addition to RFE's, expect more unpredictability and greater chance of cases just being sat on.
3. RFE's (Requests for Evidence)		It's a given. No matter how much proof you send, you'll get a request for more. Sometimes we might only send 80% of what we asked you for, so there will be something else to send when the RFE comes. Just expect it.
2. Surprise policies		Sometimes we have an idea, or some advance notice, but transparency isn't one of this administration's hallmarks.		A crazy policy may come out that totally changes the advice I'm giving you now. So stay in touch.
1. Case processing		 I can't say how long your case will take, but it will probably be longer than you expect, and longer than your cousin/brother/friend/former roommate's case did.		Most case processing has slowed.
For almost 2 years now, immigration lawyers like me have had to give "Trump Administration Advisories" in our consultations.		The list grows as the policies turn harder to the right.		So I decided to boil it all down to a checklist:
@Amy_Siskind Be still my schadenfreude

Since this letter, one of SWK's facilities has closed. Because of *yet another* allegation of sexual abuse. Not by AZDHS, but by the US Dept of Health and Human Services (DHHS).		AZDHS had already moved to revoke the licenses of all 13 SWK facilities.		https://t.co/FoYB778jkQ
A month later, however, Dr. Christ wrote a scathing letter to SWK, which I am sharing here. Dr. Christ minced no words, telling SWK the report it provided "demonstrates [your] inability and unwillingness to comprehend Arizona's most basic licensure laws." Read the entire letter: https://t.co/X4f8A2L21P
I'll tell you: one that doesn't care. SWK isn't a childcare center; it's a jail. Except the prisoners have committed no crime. AZDHS was initially hopeful, as director Dr. Christ wrote to AZ Governor Ducey on 8/23, that SWK was sincere in wanting to fix their deficiencies. https://t.co/3u8FiKKEl9
Wat emerges in the responses I got from AZDHS is that of a company that just doesn't care.		The biggest problem? Active employees who didn't have a criminal background check completed. What kind of childcare facility can't be bothered to see if an employee is a sex offender?
But what prompted the hundreds of hours of investigation were allegations of sexual abuse. On September 7, SWK worker Levian Pacheco, who was HIV+, was convicted of 10 counts of sex acts against the children he was tasked to "care" for. 		https://t.co/dCtuKsZx5Y
Out of 13 SWK facilities in Arizona, 10 were found to have serious deficiencies as of 8.23, ranging from overcrowding, accessibility to poisonous chemicals, lack of privacy curtains, bathrooms without doors, and a lack of clean bill of health for personnel. See attached: https://t.co/xwiLpARVRK
SWK's mission statement is "opening doors to opportunity so individuals can achieve their dreams." But it's not dreams behind open doors. It's nightmares behind closed doors. https://t.co/6LHWnx1Jys
The Texas Tribune reported its CEO Juan Sánchez (who earns a salary of $1.5 million) failed to disclose his 33% stake in one of SWK's properties.		The longer the kids stay at SWK, the more SWK earns. The private prison complex and all.		https://t.co/zA7ngdNxYu
SWK enjoys tax-free nonprofit status, and was paid $458 million of our tax dollars in FY2018. (Silence from those crying about the costs of illegal immigration.) 		https://t.co/poLMs7h5Ad
Even though as an immigration lawyer, I've been to the border, represented children like this for years, and have spent an unhealthy amount of time studying the origins of policies that allow it, I am livid.
I sought documents in connection with very disturbing allegations of child abuse - including sexual abuse - at so-called "migrant child centers" operated by Southwest Key Program, Inc. (@SouthwestKey).
I am *livid.* And I want you to be, too.		Ask yourself whether you want to be part of a country that carelessly allows children to be preyed on by violent sexual predators.		On 9/20, I filed a public records request with @AZDHS to which I have received a partial response.
One thing we can thank Trump for: he forced the GOP into the dump and now it's become a repository of vile policy. All stuffed into a trash bag and tied up.		That will makes it easier this November to #TakeOutTheTrash.		https://t.co/ymu9H4i8iX

This is why I'm suing to unseal the papers of John Tanton. @FAIRImmigration needs to be exposed for the white nationalist mouthpiece that it is. FAIR has gone to some lengths to distance themselves from their shadowy, eugenicist founder. But we see you.		https://t.co/J9iYu6Xb2s
FAIR's sister (yet competitor) organization @CIS_org has also been clamoring for an end to TPS...		From an April 2016 "wishlist" of things the "next President" could do on immigration: https://t.co/tBvkc33dQa
All of a sudden, the same talking point ("T" for "temporary"!) starts appearing in the White House:		https://t.co/SwWEKjOFhn		Wonder where they got it from.
Let's not forget: FAIR has been screaming about killing #TPS for a long time.		Media director Ira Mehlman wrote this in 2017:		https://t.co/wOfPOvdWkK		(He also thinks I'm a paid operative of the Qatari government because I did a video on @ajplus calling out FAIR as a WN outfit)

Here's one: https://t.co/ZLymjp9xYT
Curious, because America was founded on ideals of welcoming the forcibly displaced. I'm not sure what "American first" has to do with terminating TPS.		If the White House is influencing the decision, we have a problem, because the White House has made A LOT of racist statements.
On p29 of the decision, the Court gives yet another example of Acting Secy Elaine Duke, who is supposed to make a dispassionate assessment of conditions on the ground in determining TPS eligibility, said "this conclusion [to end TPS] is the result of an America first view..."
@FAIRImmigration, founded by Dr. John Tanton, is a mouthpiece of white nationalist rhetoric. But it's more than that: it injects its foul ideology into actual policy. 		One (latest) example: Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. Read what a federal judge found:		#SaveTPS https://t.co/x9RBPBQwsR

The only thing that matters is whether you tried.		Feel the joy of doing so.
You don't have to fight every injustice: pick your lane.		More concretely? Supporting candidates who are committed to protecting others. Calling out injustice wherever you see it: but offer a solution, too. If you can't, support those who are: even a thank you goes a long way.
So as Kavanaugh gets confirmed, focus on protecting others. It starts with yourself: recognizing your privilege. (And we all have some.) Then the rights of your family over you. Your community. Your country. Your environment. Don't lose hope.
Oppression is on the opposite end of the spectrum from justice. It's when rights are unilaterally taken away. And the protection of the rights of others is a responsibility - especially for those privileged to enjoy rights others don't have.
Even during the hearing, we worked on a case of a DV victim repeatedly raped, and another woman who nearly fell victim to suicide. I'm not going to forget the juxtaposition of seeing a patriarchy protect the oppressors - whether in Guatemala, Pakistan, or the United States.
I can't imagine what it's like: I've never been the victim of assault, much less sexual assault.		But I can empathize with those who've survived it, and working with asylum seekers and other victims for 15 years has only served to enhance that empathy.
Those who are wired for compassion, then, would naturally have a very visceral reaction: the hearing at once touched on so many of the factors that define our humanity. 		It brought up a lot of unacknowledged pain for a lot of people.
We hear stories of sexual assault all the time. Or oppression. Abuser protection. Entitlement. Privilege. Character assassination. Lip service to the oppressed. Trauma. Legalized discrimination.		Rarely do we get to see it all in one day, before hundreds of millions of people
But there was something distinctive about the hearing. It was a rare exposure of several different vectors of underreported injustice, concentrated into one episode.
Feeling drained after the #KavanaughHearings? I've been thinking about why. Objectively, there are far worse injustices going on even as Kavanaugh spoke.		Sure, there's the out of sight out of mind factor. Most injustice goes unreported; yesterday's hearing was not that.

By greatly expanding the grounds of ineligibility for a green card along largely similar metrics, many of the same people who wouldn't have been able to immigrate if the RAISE Act became law are now going to be barred all the same, deemed likely to become a "public charge."

Indeed, Tanton was the architect of the modern anti-immigrant movement, was on a first name basis with figures like Peter Brimelow, Harry Weyher, and Roger Conner. 		https://t.co/tp0U0HMlOB
What's even more curious is that FAIR completely fails to mention their founder, Dr. John Tanton, who believed Latinos were uneducable, was obsessed with eugenics, accepted money from the race-pseudoscience outfit Pioneer Fund, and thought the 14th Amendment was undesirable. https://t.co/PBYCrfhOE1

@JessicaV_CIS @BreitbartNews I have a better idea. Let's have a study to see how much FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA have cost US taxpayers as a result of your decades of divisive, enforcement-only rhetoric that dramatically drove up the cost of immigration.		People aren't liabilities, Jessica. Shame.
@JessicaV_CIS @BreitbartNews Oh please. That's not what happens AFTER they come here.  That's kind of the point of empowerment, because America is an empowering place where you prove yourself after you get here, not before. Just like I'm sure your ancestors did, Jessica.

One more family can now be reunited here in Virginia, and we couldn't be happier for them. The trajectory of their lives just changed by a stamp in a passport book. Security, hopes and plans for the future, and continued cultural pollination.		It's a great thing.
The law generally doesn't allow challenge to the decision of a consular officer. But sometimes we can challenge the consular officer's *failure to make* a decision. 		We sued, and today, before the court even had a chance to rule, the visa was granted.
Administrative processing, they call it.		We know it as security checks. For applicants from Muslim countries, we know it as "Muslim Processing Time."		https://t.co/JjlflTiArr
Today, a green card for our North African client was approved after a 4 year delay. He had been apart from his US citizen wife since 2013, and even though they followed the law to the T, repeatedly told they just needed "one more thing," the visa remained stuck.
It's the combined bureaucracy of several different agencies that keeps people out. Physical barriers are a small slice of the pie of exclusion.		But with due process, there is sometimes a way through. Perfectly legal, not unlike carving out a nice little door for yourself.
There already is a wall, folks.		More effective than any physical barrier on the southern border. Keeps people out before they can even begin their journey.		You can't fly over it or tunnel underneath it. You can't sneak around it, either. And it's much, much harder to tear down.

The irony here is the policies of FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA have COST us more money than immigrants ever did: the massive detention budget of ICE is just the tip of the iceberg.		The anti-immigrant movement is the real public charge.
They will continue their assault on aspiring American communities. 		And even naturalized citizens aren't off the radar of our ideologically driven administration:		https://t.co/Srfh7gnpgM

This, to me, is just another example of white nationalist policy coming out of the White House.		Don't be fooled. It has nothing to do with economics. This is hatred of the foreigner, pure and simple.		I hope you will #RememberInNovember.
CIS started as an offshoot of the Federation for Immigration Reform, FAIR, founded by Dr. John Tanton, a white nationalist who believed America must sharply limit non-white immigration in order to survive.		He was obsessed with race science and eugenics.		https://t.co/tp0U0HMlOB
But this didn't just appears. We've been expecting this.		The far right, white nationalist group Center for Immigration Studies published a wishlist in April 2016 of 79 hardline anti-immigrant things the next President could do. Here's no. 60: https://t.co/1LKFamX15c
But this has much further reaching consequences, because this is the system being used offensively to *keep people down.*		A whirlpool, or a black hole that can't be escaped.		Food or lawful status?	Child safety or green card?	Shelter or citizenship?	Medicine or visa?
I gave this example in a piece I wrote for @qz: https://t.co/6DjLzC8PJX

It wasn't like this before. I rarely had to go to federal court *just to win for my client the RIGHT to apply for asylum.*		No longer.		Understand that the story told in this thread is a feature, not a bug.
When we relayed our concern to the court clerk, she sighed and said, "I know where you're coming from. ICE doesn't tell us, either. It's like pulling teeth with them."		The saga continues, but I'll be damned if I let ICE deport my client from right under my nose.
Under Rule 27.3, we are required to confer with the government lawyer as well as the clerk before filing an emergency motion to stay our client's deportation. To do so, we have to certify that removal is imminent in the next 14 days.		How can we know when ICE is silent?
There is absolutely no transcript of the credible fear interview. No indication how the asylum officer denied it. He went before a judge: no transcript of that, either. Yet the deport officer certified under penalty of perjury that the record was true, correct, and complete.
And finally, only upon federal court order, we today (six weeks after entry into the US, and after suffering two denials) the administrative record in the case.		Finally! Now we could see what happened in the case! Now we could articulate our legal arguments!		But of course not.
By the way, they had moved our client from Texas to Chicago and then back to another facility in Texas, meaning we had to attempt contact with new ICE officers.		Finally, they put him in a processing center, slated for removal. We filed a petition in federal court.
We continued to press ICE to communicate with us. No response.		We had told our client to request an appeal before an immigration judge. He did. 		Again - his court date was scheduled, and we were not informed, despite our repeated attempts to connect with ICE.
We needed to talk to the deportation officer. We called. And called. And called. Radio silence. Meanwhile, we prepared our client for the credible fear interview - the first step in seeking asylum.		They did his interview without informing us, so no lawyer. It was denied.
Here's what it's like dealing with the new ICE:		Our client entered the US in August and sought asylum. We immediately informed ICE that he was represented by counsel. 3 days later, they acknowledged it by email. So far, so good.

Why do I call CIS a white nationalist outfit? Because though it bills itself as a think tank promoting lower immigration levels, it was founded or nurtured by Dr. John Tanton, a eugenicist doctor widely regarded as the grandfather of the anti-immigrant movement.
In 2016, the far right, white nationalist Center for Immigration Studies published a wishlist of hardline anti-immigrant actions the next President could take.		Here's number 29: https://t.co/axv0S5FkHf
Keep in mind, asylum seekers (mostly Latino) will have to be incarcerated for lengthy periods of time. 		In private prison complexes, mostly. Companies like CoreCivic and Geo Group.		Beginning to get the picture? But wait, there's more.
Jeff Sessions is doing everything he can to make asylum as difficult as possible. 		To break people who are already traumatized.		His cruelty knows no bounds. This is our Attorney General.		It's disgusting.
It is infinitely harder to fight an asylum case from inside jail.		It breaks the spirit. Especially if your kids are ripped from you. Then, even when you PASS the initial hurdle, you'd stay in jail.		How to talk to your lawyer without getting recorded and paying massive fees?
Sessions has been at this vile game for some time. Read this from March:		https://t.co/0FWTst6K2h
What is he doing?		He will overrule a 2005 case that gives bind hearings to asylum seekers who pass a credible fear interview.		That means the majority of asylum seekers will have to fight their cases from inside a jail cell.

They start out by seeing refugees as an "expense," and blame them for causing a backlog.		Never mind this administration has been hell bent on undocumenting as many as possible, jamming the immigration courts with new cases, and reprogramming the law into a deportation machine.
Let's break down his quote:		"This year’s refugee ceiling reflects the substantial increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum in our country, contributing to a massive backlog of outstanding asylum cases and greater public expense,” said Pompeo.
(To clarify: a refugee is one who obtains that status outside the US and is then allowed to enter. An asylum seeker comes into the US through other means, and obtains refugee status if they win their claim. The cap is on refugees resettling here, not on asylum seekers.)
Because of too many asylum seekers from south of the border. But, Pompeo reminds us, this has nothing to do with how we feel about welcoming refugees. It's just about public expense.		Hot off the press #Trumpaganda from the Ministry of Truth.

If you've been in power, sharing feels like oppression.		You've been bamboozled, tricked, brainwashed. 		Who am I talking to? Everyone, myself included.		Who are 'they?' White nationalists.		This isn't 1984. This is Brave New World: you don't even know there's something wrong.
They are afraid of losing power, so they call it a "cause" - and see it as the very survival of "their" people.		They call it ethics, and there is no price too high to pay, because this was never about economics: it was about ethnicity.
They realized emotion was the way to go, so they demoted facts to "alternatives."		They pushed soma like a drug, blurring the difference between news and commentary, not letting you slow down and think.		They will make you pay to jail brown and black people, but not educate.
They planned it a long time ago. Right after immigration stopped race based quotas in 1965.		They tried population and environmental excuses. When that didn't work, they tapped into racism.		And, this being America, they succeeded. Beyond their wildest expectations.
They've fooled you.		They got you to believe national security was served by kicking people out.		They got you to be pro family but ok with putting children in cages.		They got you to hate.		They scared you.		They promised you jobs.		They promised you safety.		They lied.

Jeff thinks lawyers doing their job is improper. No, Jeff - what's improper is your influence on judges who are supposed to be deciding cases based on things like facts, evidence, and the rule of law.		Jeff, ALL your decisions will be challenged in federal court. All of them.
Let me make it clear.		The Attorney General is telling immigration judges how to decide cases.		This is not judicial. We need ALL immigration courts to be reorganized under Article I of the US Constitution.		https://t.co/OytHMEYwQG
But that's not the biggest problem. It's that Jeff was addressing his employees - immigration judges. 		That's right. Jeff Sessions signs the paychecks of the judges deciding deportation cases. Does this sound like a stacked deck? You bet it does.
Next he says the DOJ defends immigrant rights. But Jeff has done nothing but follow the advice of white nationalist sympathizing hate groups like @FAIRImmigration, @CIS_org and @NumbersUSA.  		And he says deceit is never rewarded. Have you disclosed YOUR ties to these orgs, Jeff?
According to Jeff, accountants who tell their clients to take a lawful tax deduction, or defense lawyers who win acquittals are also shameful "water seepers." 		Apparently, Jeff's notion of good lawyering has been colored by the likes of Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani.
Sessions is the Attorney General of the United States, but he thinks "good lawyers" doing their jobs are somehow an affront to the rule of law.		Only if you define the law as requiring deportation, Jeff. The AG of the US should know better. Much better. https://t.co/Xl2uunxpdV

We've all got fires we're busy putting out. FAIR is a flamethrower. It might be worth a little of your time to pay attention to it.
Contact your elected officials tomorrow, 9/4/2018, and say, "Please do not attend FAIR's hateful radio row. There is no place for their nativist phobia against aspiring Americans. I want to see you urge others not to attend, because it's time to hold FAIR's feet to the fire."
If your elected official goes, they should be asked why they are cavorting with white nationalists? Are they ok with the ideology? Are they aware of the founder's obsession with eugenics, debunked theories of population control, and fear of a "Latin onslaught?"
This is FAIR in action: they amplify their message of hate, applying the veneer of validity by inviting elected officials and other influencers. This is where people who listen to talk radio get their ideas.		FAIR's Radio Row is a hate con, plain and simple.
They call it "Hold Their Feet To The Fire." Past guests include conservative commentators Michelle Malkin and Lou Dobbs, and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Paul Gosar (AZ-4), and Daryl Metcalfe (PA-12).
This Wed/Thu at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, DC, there's a hate con going on: the 12th annual radio row for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). 		They pay for radio hosts to come to DC and interview elected officials and others.

@bebeembop Yes. Sadly, yes.
@bebeembop If you were my client, I'd advise you to precheck before filing something and tempting fate. I would:		1. Review immigration history by filing FOIA	2. Verify birth records	3. Identify ppl who can corroborate by affidavit.		We do these things routinely for non-citizens.
It means voting and encouraging others to vote.		It means seeking advice on your situation and helping others get the advice they need if they're unable to.		It means, in a word: ENGAGEMENT.		Not a very glamorous answer, but I believe it's the right one.
This is a great question. I'll take a stab.		First, this is a marathon. We're talking about shifting an entire frame. No quick fixes.		That means standing up for the human rights of others. Calling out bigotry and intolerance. 		More immediately, it means getting informed. https://t.co/czSp52WrcH
Tag your Senators and Congressmen and ask they stand up to #ProtectCitizenship.		@MarkWarner 	@timkaine 	@RepComstock
Imagine if your government refuses to recognize you as a citizen.		No passport.	Voter registration canceled.	No access to public benefits.	No sponsoring family members overseas.		You're still a citizen, but you get none of the perks.		We cannot let this happen to ANY citizen.
I'd rather not speculate as to who might be next.		The administration thinks citizenship is like a driver's license, revocable at will. That's the real problem: they are devaluing citizenship itself.		Don't take this crap lying down.		#ProtectCitizenship
Does this mean born citizens (like me) are in danger of losong citizenship? No. But losing citizenship and refusing to recognize citizenship are two different things. The latter is much easier to do.		So far, it's Latinos born near the border delivered by midwives.
Title 8, US Code Sec. 1503 allows people who are denied a right or privelege of citizenship by a government agency to sue for a declaration of nationality.		I'm just putting this out there as the Trump administration begins its attack on native born citizens.
I'd be interested to hear more about Mr. Gomez's story. 		I think we should create a space for him.
They bristled at being lumped in with the KKK. 		But Mr. Gomez's experiences show they haven't changed. They symbiotically feed off of racism, white supremacy, and xenophobia.		No matter how much lipstick Dan Stein puts on.
The fact is, FAIR has duped a lot of people besides Mr. Gomez. It has been frantically trying to hide it's white nationalist roots since it was founded by Dr. John Tanton in 1979.		They hated being called racists. 		They were paranoid about language.
Ok let's get the itching comment out of the way: Yes, what did he expect?		But where does that get us besides another retweet or another share?		He's going to get a lot of flack for not knowing what he was getting into.		But I think we should welcome defectors, if he is one.

13. Giving incorrect information and then lying about giving it.		14. Providing non-working phone numbers or listing them inconsistently.		15. Recording privileged conversations.		This is the reality of what immigration lawyers go through dealing with ICE.

4. Runarounds: "that's a different department, counselor."		5. Ridiculously expensive phone calls.		6. Moving people around the country over and over, forcing me to send and resend the same documents.		7. Such poor call quality that I can barely understand my client.

@SailingSkyG عيد كريم و اياكم
Faith and action are two sides of the same coin. You have to believe in something to spur you to action.		Hajj done right does exactly that: spurs action.		Let #Hajj2018 be that catalyst for change.
The humility it teaches you as you navigate crowds in the heat.		The trust it forces on you as you yield to its pressure.		The link with history it creates as you sit where your ancestors sat.		There's a tranquility learned there that provides a lifeline for years to come.
Where everyone has consciously decided to leave their worries behind and focus on something greater than themselves.		Millions of people gathering in a barren desert valley. Your politics don't matter. Your bank account doesn't matter. Your privilege doesn't matter.
It is beautiful. You'll rarely, if ever, see humanity that up close and personal. Everyone takes away something that affects them, but for me, it was the unified diversity of Hajj.		No matter what, it goes on as it has for centuries. No matter where you're from.
I went on Hajj in 2012. Why is it so life-changing?		It is the ultimate spiritual retreat. The chance to disconnect and see the big picture.		It is an antidote to despair. A chance to *use* faith to win something very real: tranquility.
Millions of Muslims are completing the ancient rites of #Hajj in Mecca during these days.		May God accept their efforts. #Hajj2018		حج مبرور و سعي مشكور و ذنب مغفور.

If, as Krikorian boasts, the Tanton-founded groups have "testified before Congress &gt;100 times," testified before other agencies, done contract work for others, and is otherwise so influential on immigration - 		Shouldn't we see the sealed #TantonPapers? 		#SunlightDisinfects
Yet Tanton-network players like @MarkSKrikorian (ED of @CIS_org) write op-eds like this, complaining that they are unfairly labeled as a "hate group."		Note the diversionary tactics in this well-polished piece:		https://t.co/r9ebDn9u5f
FAIR was founded in 1979.	Center for Immigration Studies in 1984 (@USCIS director Francis Cissna officially addressed this group at the @PressClubDC on 8.15.18)		Tanton remained on the FAIR board until 2011.		In 1995, he was still communicating with eugenicists.
In the sealed #TantonPapers I am suing to unseal are 9 folders @UMich has labeled "Pioneer Fund." 		Screenshot from U-M Bentley Historical Library website: https://t.co/vmuJtw1tAV
A primer on the Pioneer Fund:		* Founded in 1937 "to advance the scientific study of heredity and human differences"	* Gave $1.3M to Tanton's groups 1985 - 1994.	* Promoted eugenics and ideas of racial IQ disparity	* Founding papers modeled on Nazi Lebensborn breeding program
So who was he writing to to find out about the use of male aphrodisiacs?	The letter is addressed to a shadowy figure named Harry Weyher, Jr.		He was a lawyer (and fellow @UNC alum..) but more notably, served as President of the Pioneer Fund from 1958 until his death in 2002.
To recap: This is a man who was obsessed with ideas about racial purity and eugenics. His ideas informed his views on immigration. Those organizations are currently in the White House's ear.		This is a problem.		https://t.co/tp0U0HMlOB

@hilory Thank you - I only try to share my limited experience.
This is so needed. Let me scream it from the rooftops: Our asylum system is a minefield. It can't wait to trap people, chew them up, and spit them out across the border.		Lawsuits like this are the only hope at restoring balance.		You guys rock. All y'all. https://t.co/1IOkVQGYtF
If this was a criminal prosecution, all of these people proved their cases beyond a reasonable doubt.		"But it could have been faked" is the battle-cry of the eternal half-wit.
Once I read a sentence and my client-a man with almost no education-finished it for me. It even held up if I changed details deliberately to see if they caught me. "No, I said twice." "No, I said in Guerrero." "No, Cartel Jalisco de Nueva Generación, not La Familia Michoacán."
Or the pages of written evidence brought by others - including not just police reports, but entire investigative files with pictures of bullet wounds, blood-stained ground, or wrecked cars. 		They loved it when I whipped out my phone to live fact-check them.
Their stories were simple and direct and didn't fall apart even on scrutiny. Many of them told me they enjoyed life - "estábamos tranquilos!" - before the gangs or cartels or abusive spouses terrorized them and their families.
They remembered details vividly: the more I asked, the more details came forth, like the woman who was chased by corrupt Federales and kept telling me details about these officers, what they looked like, the color of their uniforms.
Calling asylum seekers liars is a sign of a feeble intellect.		So why did I believe them?		They couldn't wait to tell their story, like every woman who waited outside in the heat to talk to me. They spoke naturally even when their eyes teared up.
Those who proclaim "Gotcha!" are practicing textbook denialism, and share more than a brain cell or two with Birthers, Truthers, Holocaust deniers, and my Uber driver in Cleveland who told me about the Starchild Skull and how Trump wouldn't order Space Force if we didn't need it.
The only reason they're called liars is because that makes it easier to shut the door in their face. If there's a hole in the story, then logically, it does not follow that the story is a lie. Finding a hole in the story is the *beginning* of the work to verify, not the end.
How do we ever know whether someone is telling the truth? As client-serving lawyers, we have to ask ourselves this every day. We are practiced at looking at the facts, and poking holes to see how well the story stands up. 		But this is what I wanted to tell the gentleman:
I ran into a gentleman coming back from San Diego who asked me where I was coming from. I told him I had been in Tijuana, Mexico helping people apply for asylum.		"Good for you!" he exclaimed, then added, "It must be hard to know if they're telling the truth."		Sigh...

Does this wall tell our story?		We've been allowing the wall proponents to steer our policies for decades. Now they're the driver's seat, speaking for all of us.		To them, this wall *defines* our country, not the people in it. https://t.co/7N0BYETx52
I heard so many stories today, yesterday, and over the 15 years I've practiced immigration law.		What's our story?		The story of America as a welcoming land? 		You can tell from the license plates in Tijuana and San Diego. Most plates here in TJ are also from California.
It was tragic metaphor to give this consult in full view of the border wall, seeing San Diego in the distance.		Because the wall she faced was even higher, since our white nationalist Attorney General decided to virtually disqualify domestic violence victims from seeking asylum.
Later, I went to another organization to meet with a woman who endured years of domestic abuse. Her ex beat her so bad she was deaf in one ear. Ex-military, he knew how to hit without leaving a mark. I read his abusive text messages. She was broken.
Having to watch for "separation risks" (things that might lead to bring separated, like incomplete birth certificates) and explaining how clumsy the asylum law is, and the cruelty of the current administration... these things didn't bother my clients. 		They bothered me, though.
I closed each consult with "su historia es su poder"-your story is your power. I wanted these women to own their stories.		But I have to be honest. I felt the enormity of the task. So much work to kind of help one person.		It's easy to feel despair. Even easier to lose your mind.
Tales from the border, Day 2		I went back to the shelter today to meet with women seeking asylum. Today was more of the same: stories of mass extortion, police inability or corruption, and desperate despair.		Today I focused on empowerment. Because telling stories is empowering.

I figure #ICE would've taken down the sign on the American side. https://t.co/6dAiJs5WF5
@ricardo_de_anda This was still the Mexican side!
I'm off for another day. More later.
There's a quiet desperation for people here who live in a place where they can see prosperity and safety across the wall but can't get there.		Look but don't touch. The answer is always no. Not sorry, not try later, not try something else. 		Just no.
What's clear to me is:		1. The existing law is being used as much as possible to deny people the right to apply. Bureaucracy, new interpretations, new policies.		2. The anti-immigrant movement will not stop until they've completely killed the right to apply for asylum.
When the border wasn't militarized, people, goods, services, and culture flowed. It was good for San Diego, good for Tijuana.		Militarized borders (born of fear and bigotry) cut off prosperity on both sides, but you see it on this side of the border. 		It's about INEQUALITY.
The hardest part, as usual, is listening to waves of desperate humanity. 		These are people just trying to make it. Asylum law is clumsy and a very poor tool to help them, but we use what we can.		I talked to a couple of musicians about growing up in Tijuana.
I've done border work before, but this is a new line of inquiry.		Still seeing referrals for criminal prosecution, apparently, but it is reduced since zero tolerance was rolled back.		The best part is the look on a client's face when she starts to understand the system.
I asked about children and having clear birth certificates to reduce chances of being separated at the border.		And any contact with police, however minor, would be used offensively to create a 'red flag' to separate parent from child. eg, getting swept up in a raid.
A mix of Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadorian and Honduran. All were fleeing persecution from either gangs, cartels, or (in one case) corrupt army officials threatening to file narc charges if she didn't work as an informant.		All were terrified and all wished they could stay home.
My first day as a volunteer lawyer at the border was at a shelter for asylum seekers here in Tijuana.		There are 3 ports of entry here. But asylum seekers are all routed to only one. 		All 7 women I talked to yesterday were given a number, DMV style, and told to come back.

They fight against that which always made America great by closing their eyes to basic humanity.		So when someone asks me whether I'm rolling in money under Trump, I tell them the truth: I'm not.		Because I cannot imagine what this poisonous rhetoric will even begin to cost us.
This movement – started by white nationalist Dr. John Tanton – has wrecked our immigration law. It's time we put the blame where it belongs. This administration has bought into the emboldened white nationalist narrative of fear of an immigrant “invasion.”
There is a well-organized, financed, and purposeful anti-immigrant movement in this country, and they've been at work for decades to ethnically purge the United States of America. We all need to understand this crucial point: these policies were not cooked up by the White House.
The federal bench is being stacked with judges who subscribe to this narrative, and in immigration court, judges are robbed of autonomy and pressured to order removals as fast as possible.
When there is a way, ICE steps in to deport them before they get a chance. Our clients are criminalized, and then robbed of both access to counsel and the due process of law that all criminals get.
We are tasked with coaxing lawful status out of a system being reprogrammed into a deportation machine. Hateful rhetoric spews from Washington on a daily basis, finding its way into actual policy. Laws are interpreted to make it impossible for immigrants to become American.
Since then, we've been inundated with the horrors of cruel, calculated family separation at the border, ramped up deportations without any sense of prioritization, denial of access to counsel, and deplorable, dehumanizing language from the highest offices in the land.
I was a volunteer lawyer at Washington-Dulles International Airport on the night of the first Muslim ban in January 2017. Despite having a court order in hand, we were barred from meeting any detained clients.
People seeking asylum relate tales of the law not working in their countries; police in bed with criminal gangs, bribery as standard operating procedure, and no chance to tell their story. Now, I see the same things happening here.
Just as we saw with the #MuslimBan, the administration is offensively using chaos: make the system unpredictable, and people will either not come, not apply for protection, or retreat into hiding for later apprehension and removal.
What about clients who are in lawful status? Surely the administration isn't going after them? Think again. USCIS is planning to make it easier to deny cases, and then pump them into the overburdened immigration court system for deportation.
I recently had to get a case I filed nearly 3 years ago continued because Sessions suddenly made it harder for Central American gang-based/domestic violence-based claims to succeed. Earlier this year, Sessions took away an immigration judge's ability to control her own docket.
We're seeing processing delays across the board, and I cannot tell my clients whether the advice I'm giving them will be nullified by tomorrow's 5 AM tweet. But besides processing times, the law itself turns into shifting sands.
Will the government even follow the law, and if not, will we get a chance to take them to court?		Immigration lawyers have become quite accustomed to putting on “evil genius” hats to advise our clients.
Even if there is a way, clients are justifiably scared, even terrified. Will the legal basis for the asylum claim we've articulated remain good law? What happens if the law changes mid-process? Will there be a chance to refile before getting placed in deportation proceedings?
First, I want to be clear: it's nothing compared to what our clients are going through.		But that doesn't mean it's easy: there are rarely any routine cases anymore. We find ourselves saying “no, there's nothing we can do for you” more often.
So what's it like practicing immigration law in this administration? https://t.co/qkSE1sxyun
We're in the business of alleviating human suffering by providing a secure path to prosperity: lawful immigration status in a great country. For victims, families, entrepreneurs, workers...It should not be a minefield, but under Trump, that is exactly what it is becoming.

The groups Tanton founded and/or nurtured - FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA - have collectively stalled meaningful immigration reform for decades. The #TantonPapers will shine a light onto the foundations of the anti-immigrant movement, as well as its strategic plans and key players.

@JBurrel47549198 @ManInTheHoody Thank you! And as far as helping us stand for our country's values, my guess is you're already doing it. Calling out hatred when you see it and letting your actions speak for inclusivity.
Kelvin's story needs to be heard and amplified. I wish he'd get the chance to follow a speaker like Richard Spencer. Kelvin's story neutralizes hate.		I guarantee if you hear him, you're not going to forget it.
We talked about how he used Buddhist psychology to find and create the spiritual strength to make himself bigger than the negative hate thought he grew up with.		Kelvin's a fascinating guy. He's got a manuscript and will be publishing a book about his triumph over hate.
We talked about John Tanton, founder of FAIR, whose papers I'm suing to unseal. Kelvin said Tanton's worldviews reminded him of his father. #TantonPapers		https://t.co/tp0U0HMlOB
Now he's finally at a place, spurred by the 2016 election and the 2017 terror in Charlottesville, VA where he can tell his remarkable story of strength overcoming hate. 		So over Thai food today, we talked about white nationalism as a creed vs its use as a political tool.
Beatings with metal hangers or 2 x 4's.		Murderous fantasies of killing black people to make his father love him.		And the crazy idea that this work was necessary and was the "responsible" thing to do.		He described hate as a purposeful mental illness of hating onesself.
He related a harrowing tale of constant physical and emotional abuse.		Being threatened for playing team sports where he would have to interact with black people.		No swimming in mixed race pools.		Visceral disgust at a person of color on TV.
I first listened to Kelvin speak at a state commission meeting in May and his story of growing up in a household of one of the white nationalist movement's leaders was jarring. 		Years of abuse, neglect, hatred...all of which he had to find the tools to overcome.
He's the son of William Pierce, founder of the white supremacist group the National Alliance, and author of The Turner Diaries. (It's a racist novel called a "bible of the racist right.") Timothy McVeigh cited it as partially inspiring his 1996 terrorist attack in Oklahoma City.
Today I met Kelvin Pierce. If you don't know him, you should.		He has an extraordinary story of overcoming hate. And it's precisely what our country needs. https://t.co/6HElf3qc9g

@MarcherValiant Hey, thought I'd let you know last week I won asylum for a father &amp; daughter from El Salvador who entered without a visa. Got 100s more cases to fight, too. Black people, brown people, even some Muslims.		You keep tweeting, Fearless Keyboard Warrior. You can make a difference!
So when someone asks me whether I'm rolling in money under Trump, I tell them the truth.		I'm not. We're not. 		Because I can't even begin to imagine what this poisonous, racist rhetoric will even begin to cost us.
Making it impossible for an immigrant to correct their status.	Requiring proof of merit before the immigrant arrives, not after.	Attacking our institutions. 	Robbing people of due process of law.	Stacking the judicial bench.	Revoking judicial autonomy.
They've bought into the white nationalist narrative of fear of an immigrant invasion. 		They close their eyes to basic humanity. Examples?		Criminalization of asylum seekers.	Using anti-immigrant terminology in caselaw.	Assuming deportation as the only "cure" to this "problem."
My business is to help alleviate human suffering by helping provide security: lawful immigration status.		It shouldn't be a minefield. But that's what is happening.		The right has wrecked our system of laws. It's time we put the blame where it belongs.
Ok. I'm quite sick of the comment, "So, business must be pretty good with Trump in office, huh?"		Yeah, do oncologists get happy when the cancer rate spikes?		Besides, each case requires twice as much work. The law turns into shifting sands. Everything leads to deportation.

@immlawACHall That would be one of several questions I'd require him to answer under oath.
@DemWrite Thanks Nick. I just want people to be aware. Too often people rely on the shared experience of family members, or a community elder who's filled out 100s of petitions over the years.		This administration is actively setting traps for people.
Even if all anti-immigrant hardliners are voted out, it will take time to repair the damage to our system.		Most people simply cannot afford to wait. Use what you have. People are still getting approved. People are still becoming citizens.		And we need all hands on deck.
I can't stress this enough: Make your plan based on what the law is, not what it might be.		These policies didn't come out of nowhere. They've been ready, developing, for decades. They're not going to disappear with Trump.
It's no secret the entire immigration system is under attack. It's being rewritten. But some parts more than others.		Lawyers can evaluate whether it makes sense to wait or file now. But in general, why would anyone want to wait for the administration to screw it up more?
Many clients ask me, "Shouldn't I wait until after Trump is gone to file for my green card/citizenship?"		The answer is almost always no.		Get the right advice. Make sure it's ok. And if you can, file as soon as you can.

4. Know where these policies are coming from. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and its spinoff "think tank" Center for Immigration Studies (CIS, not to be confused with USCIS) have been peddling restrictionist and nativist rhetoric for decades.
3. We need a legislative fix. There are already penalties for filing a frivolous application. If an applicant doesn't get it right the first time, it does NOT mean they are not eligible for the benefit. This is the law, and attempts to comply with it should not be punished.
2. This is a time for our elected officials to really hold USCIS's feet to the fire. Highlight those Congressmen who use their position to fight for their future constituents through their immigration liaison services, to convince USCIS to take back an improper denial.
How to fight this nonsense?		1. Get the right advice, at the right time. It's never been more important. Things are different now.
The stated reason is to discourage frivolous, placeholder filings. But in practice, it's hard to imagine how an officer will know. More mistakes will be punished, and then the rest of the immigration system (ICE, ERO, the courts) will suck up the trapped people and chew them up.
This is what happens when immigration hardliners are elected into office, and allowed to appoint other immigration hardliners into supervisory positions. First, it was CBP, then ICE. Now USCIS officers have been given free reign over applications. 		https://t.co/XV2K5fwc06
As an immigration and citizenship lawyer, this effectively means the system just got a lot more unforgiving. Even a simple, straightforward application, one that might be considered "routine" - can no longer be so considered.
Read together, this means one thing: You better get it right the first time. Otherwise, you might find yourself standing before a judge who, because of other decisions also made this year, is powerless to put your case on hold while you try to fix the problem with USCIS.
The second memo says that if an application is filed incompletely, without certain required evidence, then USCIS has the right to deny the application *without* requesting further evidence (commonly known as an "RFE.")		https://t.co/9bKDbnVOkq
The first memo says that if an application is denied, and that denial leaves the applicant without lawful immigration status, the applicant will be placed in removal proceedings (deportation.)		https://t.co/qkJil1FMJk
Last week, USCIS issued two new memos that are going to affect *all* immigration applications. That includes green cards, fiancé visas, H-1B's, citizenship, work permits, extensions and changes of status - the whole nine yards.

I remember hearing "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" in high school. Why do you think it became an anthem of the Civil Rights movement?		I submit this modest proposal:		An America where everyone has a chance to make it.
Miss me with the "every river needs a flood, every forest a fire" nonsense. Because even if that's true, I'm not about to allow our beautiful country to be replaced with some white nationalist fantasy utopia. That's their vision.		What's ours?
Gandhi, Susan B. Anthony, MLK, Mandela, Muhammad Ali, and Malcolm X were all fiercely principled leaders. They didn't just resist, they were resistant.		Let's not just resist individual attacks. Let's make our institutions resistant to attack.
In contrast, every civil rights leader preached the opposite: sticking to principle. That's not the same thing as blind faith. When our institutions - courts, governing bodies, and schools - are under attack, we have to embrace an unshaking devotion to principle.
Why else roll out bans, lock up babies, and write slipshod laws to back it up? It's because there's an ideology behind the chaos. As we saw with the Muslim ban, our institutions will only protect us for so long.		Everything has a breaking point.
Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Ne Win-all offensively used chaos to control. If Bannon really is the 6D chess player he's rumored to be, and subscribes to the "Fourth Turning" theory of inevitable destruction, the chaos is an effort to create a self-fulfulling prophecy.
Weak laws fragment nations. Strong ones empower them.	Weak laws victimize. Strong laws balance.		Chaos and hysteria have been the MO of this administration since the first #MuslimBan. Constantly shocking, descending to new lows, keeping everyone busy with the job of resisting.
A year and a half into this clown show, it is abundantly clear that law is what is being attacked, because if society needs a chaotic shakeup to build some fantasy utopia, the law holding it together must be dissolved.		That's what law is - the glue that holds society together.

If we could just listen, as a country, instead of throwing up walls. If we started from compassion and strength instead of fear and weakness. If we could remember our founding values.		If we could just do the right thing.
A lot had to go right. Getting a grown man to open up and pour out the fear he had been living with for 7 years isn't easy. Sessions is a deliberately trying to make it impossible to win. He had an elementary school education. But it didn't matter: His sincerity showed through.
All the thousands of people fleeing persecution may be dehumanized by our government, but my God, their words, their actions, and their feelings are all so human.
Jeff Sessions can suck it.		I've done a lot of these cases and each one is its own emotional roller coaster. Today, though, my eyes were wet during trial, because my client had told me he didn't care what happened to him. Just that his daughter be allowed to stay.
In June, our white nationalist Attorney General decided a case, Matter of A-B-, that gutted asylum law and made Central American gang cases much harder to win. 		That didn't matter today, thank God. Just won asylum for a father and a daughter.

They're grassroots. They like to shock. Hear that creaking sound? It's the Overton window, shifting even further to the right.		If a naturalized citizen becomes second class, why not do the same to born citizens of the undocumented?		That's white nationalism.
14A is about equal protection, due process, and birthright citizenship. It's worked well for 150 years. 		It's bad enough @USCIS has a denaturalization task force to revoke citizenship for foreign born.		Groups like NumbersUSA feed this rhetoric into national discourse.
Note: he thought "children of illegal aliens" would lead to a "highly undesirable situation" in the future.		Classic white nationalist belief, fear of a silent brown invasion.		Note also: law professor tells him he needs to #BuildTheWall - and Puerto Rico should be independent.
Tanton was obsessed with figuring out ways to preserve a white majority in the US. He saw immigration as an existential threat to the national identity of the US.		And he didn't like the 14th Amendment.		See this letter he wrote to a law professor in 1975: https://t.co/QYZkKeiVjd

1. Jack, a foreign student, files for an extension. He's always been in status. Changes address, informs USCIS; acknowledged. USCIS sends request for evidence to old address anyway. 		Extension of status denied for failure to respond.		Jack is put in removal proceedings.

@LibyaLiberty It's language is tame, but misrepresentations come in many shapes. SCOTUS precedent may save many, but it assumes access to counsel to fight it. 		A denaturalization task force cheapens citizenship by making it as revocable as a driver's license.		It also spreads fear.

@mehdirhasan Likewise!
@mehdirhasan Seems there may be lots of ways to mislead, and meddle, but it all comes from the same playbook.
6. Finally, follow my colleague @MatthewHoppock as he has been tracking/fighting denaturalization cases for a long time. These cases.were.a relative obscurity...but we all need to be aware of how it will affect practice and advocacy.		Happy 4th of July, America. /
5. This also will have a chilling effect on naturalization applications, as many green card holders may be thinking, "why file for citizenship if they'll just take it away?"		Don't let them screw with your mind. File and be smart. Make proper disclosures. We need your votes.
4. Let's NOT call for ppl like @SebGorka and @MELANIATRUMP to be denaturalized. Let's not make this yet another weapon against people we don't like.		On the #FourthofJuly lets remember the weighty gift citizenship is. It shouldn't be revocable like a driver's license.
3. The legalities will be unfortunately lost on most people, and like so many other initiatives in this admin, there's a "psyop" angle: spread fear, create panic, make every nonwhite person feel insecure. Because the govt can still come after people even with weak cases.
2. The concern is whether it will be expanded for other misrepresentations, intentional or not. Also, given this admin's track record: targeting certain communities.		All valid concerns. There are legal defenses available in some cases. Of course, this assumes access to counsel.
Tweeted this last year. Now the task force for denaturalization (what an appropriate topic for #FourthofJuly2018) is in place. A few takeaways:		1. Thus far, only applies to immigrants who applied for citizenship under a fake name. https://t.co/lihGFVvrpv

What are the takeaways?		1. Immigration is fraught with uncertainty. 		2. All the due process protection of traffic court, except it's your life on the line.		3. All of my clients today were attempting to follow the law.		4. Deportation is not, and should not, be the only cure.
Fourth consult: A young man from UAE. Asylum pending and very uncertain. Got a labor certification approved, but because of the way USCIS reads the law, he'll have to leave to get a green card. Highly uncertain prospect. No way to give security.
Third consult: Three brothers of a former client. Two other brothers already murdered; 2 sisters were raped and beaten. MS-13.		You get used to seeing fear in people's eyes. But it doesn't get easier with time.		Strong asylum claims, but not eligible to file. So they're stuck.
Second consult: A young Mexican, bullied his whole life because of a speech impediment, stopped sending money to his family when his abusive, alcoholic father stole it. Then his parents threatened to kill him if he returned.		Nearly zero chance (thus far) on winning asylum.

@YuleeJanet @waltshaub @grantstern Maybe Bureau of Immigration Compliance?		It reinforces fact that immigration is civil, regulatory, administrative.		It would include allowing obtaining immigration benefits.		It would use deportation only as the strong medicine it was intended for.
@grantstern @waltshaub Narrative control. This is what I was talking about with #AbolishICE
@waltshaub Doesn't that show lack of narrative control?		Why should we let the Trumpkins control what #AbolishICE means?		We are still stuck in the frame of border security (read: militarization) and enforcement (read: deportation.)		If we must replace something, let it be that framing.
@asgvisalaw That's going to require cutting off the sources of hate rhetoric. The end goal is an agency that works to keep out the bad and let the good flow. Abolishing ICE is not an end, it's one means.
I don't think anyone saying #AbolishICE means don't replace it.		But those of us who deal with ICE every day (and I'm one of them) knows the poison of the anti-immigrant right has seeped into the marrow of the agency.		Abolishing it is a necessary first step. https://t.co/DDGt2NGdwq

10. Lastly, please, people. Help, but take advice from experts. Asylum seekers are vulnerable people. That they're so politicized makes them more vulnerable still.		There is a lot that can go wrong even with the best of intentions.
9. We are demanding the human right to seek asylum be protected and honored, not gutted and abused.		But even the rest of the process is full of hurdles, and this administration is placing more and more in the way.		We have to stop criminalizing asylum.
8. There isn't always a way to enter legally. Even if there is, CBP makes it difficult or impossible.		And what's legal isn't always what's right, or what the people want, or what the country needs.
7. We wish people would remember we need comprehensive immigration reform.		And we don't want the anti-immigrant movement to have any part in crafting it, be sure they're only interested in building a lean, mean, deporting machine.
6. It's not just about reuniting kids with parents.		Once that's done, the country may pat itself on the back.		Meanwhile, the parent and kid still face deportation. And the rules are getting tougher, and it's harder to win.		These families and more may wind up deported to death.
5. It is a man-made crisis. A new system that actually respects due process, and gives people ways to come in and out, would actually resolve much.		A prevailing false narrative of immigrant invading hordes, unfortunately, prevents this from happening.
4. Everyone wants to help and that's great. Please take your cues from the experts on the ground who've been representing people for years.		There are no simple solutions. Fires can be put out, but there will be more fires.
3. ICE does not care about ripping up families. They've been doing it for years.		They're not going to enforce any law that helps a non-citizen.		They're not going to turn over records without a fight.		They thrive on shock value.
2. No, people in removal proceedings don't get lawyers if they can't afford one, which they usually can't.		Criminal defendants actually get more rights, even if they're not citizens, than people in removal proceedings.
1. Family separation is only new as a blanket policy. It's a twisted form of family detention, which should be called family incarceration.		Family incarceration...and including those of "tender age" is not new. It's been going on.
Things immigration lawyers and advocates wish people knew about the man-made crisis at the border:

You white nationalist, fear mongering prick. https://t.co/IxuDZORqVT
@RawStory White nationalist alert.
If the settlement is not modified, the government will resume separating families as the next best option.		The internment camps are going to be built.	The bottom line: They'll do what they want. 		We need a new narrative. Resist isn't enough.		Build.
As a result of the false narrative, the DOJ argues it is stuck between two alternatives: separate families, or tolerate gaming of the asylum system. This is absurd. 		There is a clear option: Give people a meaningful chance to tell their story. Let's not be afraid to listen.
The government asks to detain families together so that removal proceedings can be expedited. That is code for rob them of due process and deport them, together, more efficiently.
It also conflates enforcement of immigration law with deportation- there is no mention of enforcing INA 208 (governing asylum). This is because the DOJ fails to recognize the real change in circumstance: the collapse of the Northern Triangle into a terrible cauldron of violence.
The change is necessary, according to the DOJ, because of changed circumstances of a surge in border crossings.		Missing is argument as to why that now makes lengthy incarceration of children a good idea.
DOJ is complaining that the only way to enforce the law is to detain families indefinitely. It freely conflates the word "crisis" with both the crisis *created* by Trump separating families, and the larger humanitarian one in which DOJ removes any reference to asylum seeking.
Wholly missing is any discussion of the convoluted asylum process, the difficulty in proving these claims, that DOJ is actively gutting asylum law to make them nearly impossible, and evidence that asylum seekers are denied the chance to make their claims.		https://t.co/3pOHjXUXDH
It is based on the false narrative that US immigration policies incentivize Central Americans to flee to the US and file fraudulent asylum claims. Who says so? Thomas Homan, director of ICE, a virulent anti-immigration figure.		https://t.co/czyGml3AuB
Why? 		So that our government can more efficiently detain families together in preparation for deportation.		Again: This is to make deportation easier, faster, cheaper, more efficient.
The DOJ "motion," asks for two "narrow" exceptions to the Flores settlement:		First, to be able to detain families together.	Second, to make family jails exempt from licensing requirements, which govern the minimum standards of care in these jails.
Pursuant to Trump's #FamilySeparation Executive Order, @TheJusticeDept asked a federal court to let the government out of the Flores settlement. This binding settlement is the only law preventing the horrific caging of children apprehended by ICE. Here's what you should know:

10. Our country is defined by its people, not its borders.		Don't just resist.		Build.
8. Let's put some blame where it belongs: the government renders people "undocumented" by actively dedocumenting them. "Document" is a verb.		9. Immigration is the cure for cultural stagnation. America is not a pie that needs dividing. It's a whole kitchen.
5. Not they. Us.		6. Let's start talking about citizenship law, not just immigration law. And let's not conflate immigration law with deportation law.		7. Let's raise the term prosperous border, not "border security." Let's not conflate border security with border militarization.
3. Don't be afraid to call out white nationalism. Learn to recognize it. Calling out bigotry never gets old: don't let them tell you any different.		4. Associate the word "immigrant" with "future citizen," or "aspiring American" whenever possible, and repeatedly.
1. Scream it from the rooftops. Seeking asylum is a human right.		2. Stop criminalizing brown and black bodies, or the exercise of human rights by brown and black bodies.
But all this advocacy can be focused. We can no longer accept the prevailing framing of the issues. No, we must not only fight back, but create an alternative. So I have a few more concrete suggestions.
So to put out fires, I recommend donating to @RAICESTEXAS , @cliniclegal , @AlOtroLado_Org, the @immcouncil, and the Texas Civil Rights Project. These folks have been on the ground since before #FamiliesBelongTogether started trending.
The thing about fires is they have to be put out. But if we're not working toward a common goal, we'll never take out the flamethrower.
I'm matter-of-factly glad that there is attention being paid to the due process free zone known as our southern border. I'm glad there is so much outrage. But it's as useless as a bunch of water pistols if not properly channeled.
4. If you think this is bad, wait and see what happens when the laws themselves are rewritten instead of just being interpreted as cruelly as possible.		Wait and see what Jeff Sessions &amp; Co. have in store.
1. The laws permitting these atrocities have been on the books for years.		2. There is a lot of money in the business of human detention. I mean, incarceration.		3. At least on the immigration side, the haters have a 40 year headstart. (FAIR dates back to 1979)
And I despair at the enormity of the task at hand, disgusted that this is where we are.		Here are some unvarnished truths:
I despair that we are once again pulling out our water pistols to put out yet another fire, instead of taking out their flamethrower. I am disgusted at the complacency of people who legitimize that narrative by trying to find a half-baked common ground with it.
But I despair for another reason: that there is no unified alternative narrative. I am disgusted at the hate movements that successfully created their narrative.		(I'm talking about, among others, the Federation for American Immigration Reform.)
Sure, I feel despair at not being able to just end family separation. And disgust at the administration that first celebrated it, and now (like clockwork) tries to deny it.
On separating families: Between fielding inquiries, helping clients, and trying to contextualize this latest act in the ongoing clown show that is this administration, I've also felt the ongoing nauseating mix of despair and disgust.		But maybe not for the same reasons.

Correct. The right to apply for asylum is in 8 USC 1158. You do not have to be in status.		What's happening is that the law on unlawful entry (8 USC 1325) is being overused to criminalize asylum-seeking entries, en masse. https://t.co/5EliFbx8Il
