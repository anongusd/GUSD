@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee I answered in the other thread.	This is a side issue, but I think it's relevant. If you're going to push back against liberal authors, you should take the time to understand left ideas. If you think the Dem establishment are radical leftists, you haven't.
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee When I was at MIT, the student body was pretty heavily conservative. Admissions wasn't biased against liberals; STEM students are just more likely to lean right.	SFWA members aren't biased against conservatives; liberals are just more likely to write their type of fiction. /2
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee That's true.

Instead of paying attention to the variety of left politics, though, you smush everyone from centrist Dems to far-left Eat the Rich types into a caricature of "radical left."
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee Not what I asked. Besides, *fiction* isn't necessarily left- or right-leaning, though authors may be. Some fiction takes a clear political stand, but I not most.	There are authors I like whose politics I dislike &amp; vice versa. In most cases I don't even know their political views.

@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee There's some ideological sorting that's caused by greater forces. I went to MIT, &amp; the student body leaned conservative, but not because of bias by Admissions.

@theJamesEWells @Catrambo @sfwa Here are the Nebula rules. https://t.co/sOjlb2iZYr	If that's too jargony, here's the Wikipedia entry: https://t.co/8EuudRMdNp
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee How do you define radical &amp; liberal? Are you aware that "radical left" &amp; "liberal" are actually different?		SFWA named Larry Niven‚Äîwell known for his conservative views‚Äîa grand master a few years ago. Does that mean anything?		"Biased" how? Who's putting a thumb on the scale?
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee And do you really think that all the individual SFWA members who nominate are aware of and evaluate every author's politics?		Could it possibly just be that the authors who write the kind of fiction that tends to appeal to SFWA members are more likely to lean left?
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @jonathanbrazee There are always peculiar finalists. I haven't read the story so can't speak to it, but I presume that a sufficient number of SFWA members thought it was worth nominating.
@theJamesEWells @sfwa @Catrambo That's what I said. ???

@theJamesEWells @sfwa @Catrambo Also, I question whether preferring Yoshi to Ayn Rand amounts to slander, but this is all a side issue, since Cat has no power over what gets nominated.

@theJamesEWells @sfwa @Catrambo (You don't have to be liberal to dislike Ayn Rand, &amp; I question "2nd most influential book," but let that go.)	Cat doesn't select the finalists. Any SFWA member in good standing can nominate, and the six works with the most nominations become finalists.	Jury was abolished 2009.

@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC Because the discussion is complicated by racist, fear-mongering rhetoric; the confusion of asylum-seekers with illegal entrants; the use of "alternative facts"; and the fact that this is all about keeping a ridiculous campaign promise made with no actual thought to policy.
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC No, it says that fencing can be a part of a border security strategy in some areas (which no one, I believe, denies), but it doesn't validate any of the wild claims about crime in El Paso and elsewhere made by POTUS and others, or his claims of the need for The Wall.
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC Plus, stats show illegal crossings are actually way down. /3
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC To the larger point: This won't help. Even *if* a wall could solve it, given the legal challenges‚Äînot just from the emergency decree, but from landowners‚Äîconstruction can't start for years. /2
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC No, it's clearly not. POTUS did nothing to press for his wall while he had a fully GOP Congress. This year, he negotiated with Congress for months.	You can't reasonably argue it's so urgent there's no time for Congress to deliberate. (They did, multiple times.) /1
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC Still not relevant to your claims, either about El Paso or The Wall.
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC Yes, this is the hell that POTUS wants to send asylum-seekers back to.
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC No reference in that DEA report to rape or human trafficking, let alone your claim that the fence in El Paso curbed drug smuggling/crime.
@RyDubbz @idkwhat2typenow @bearsandfords @RepPressley @AOC It was a drug treatment center, but you're right that it's not the most reliable source.  But this is from the DEA report you linked.

@Lyle_Armstrong @RobCotter21 @RepPressley It gives POTUS lots of leeway on what constitutes an emergency, true.

@DaveAlexanderID @lomas_scot @SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar No it doesn't. I don't care how unclear Northam was. It's simply not true.	You can't have abortions "up to birth." And whatever the circumstances, homicide remains illegal.	You're so committed to the idea that abortion rights advocates are evil, you'll believe anything.
@Huds04074775 @NARAL That's a deliberate misinterpretation. She was saying she didn't want the "negro" community to get the MISTAKEN impression that was what was going on.	But please, link me the Vox piece that validates your interpretation. If I'm wrong, I'll publicly eat my words.
@KittyLovesTrump I don't know how many ways I can explain this. He wasn't talking about killing a baby. He was talking about discussing which if any life-prolonging measures to use (e.g., respirator?) for a baby who is going to die no matter what.
@DavidlambEX @lomas_scot @SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar You use the snarl word "leftist" to describe everyone from middle-aged, middle-class feminists to antifa.	You selectively ignore context in considering why health is *one* of the reasons to keep abortion legal, though a crucial one.	You lie, like every forced-birth advocate. https://t.co/RPrf9HzGlZ
@DaveAlexanderID @lomas_scot @SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar Have you read the bill? If so, please find me the language that makes infanticide legal.		(Hint: It doesn't exist.)
@DavidlambEX @rgriesemer3 @atrupar No, you decide what, if any, life-prolonging measures you're going to use. No matter what you do, that baby is dying. That's what nonviable means.
@lomas_scot @DavidlambEX @SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar Sincere question, Parlour Vortex: Why are you cheering? I wouldn't cheer if I saw Australia ripping itself apart.	If it's just anti-Americanism, I guess I can respect that, but I think it's short-sighted.
@DavidlambEX @lomas_scot @SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar Nice. You have no answer, so you switch to lying about abortion in general.	"Leftists" don't claim abortion is or should be only for danger to mom or baby. But that's why late abortions, as rare as they are, are nearly always done.	No, post-birth killing isn't legal. üôÑ
@Big_Jet_Kun @rgriesemer3 @atrupar Is is murder if I decide not to keep my dying grandmother on a respirator?
@DavidlambEX @rgriesemer3 @atrupar No, an end-of-life discussion for a baby who is dying‚Äîbecause that's what we're talking about‚Äîmeans deciding what measures to use. Do we resuscitate? Put the infant on a respirator?	Is it murder when you decide not to keep a dying patient "breathing" via machine?
@DavidlambEX @rgriesemer3 @atrupar I have indeed listened, as well as read the transcript. I challenge you to find the word "kill." He said have a discussion, and bad-faith commentators have claimed he meant a discussion about whether to kill the infant. That's not so.
@Big_Jet_Kun @rgriesemer3 @atrupar I don't appreciate your tone, but I'll try once more. He never mentioned killing a baby. He was talking about having an end-of-life discussion about what life-prolonging measures to use for a baby who could not survive.	I know what infanticide is, jerkwad, and that isn't it.

He certainly could have been clearer, but I doubt it ever occurred to him that people would say the former pediatric surgeon killed newborns.
@rgriesemer3 @atrupar You go find me the word "kill" anywhere. The idea that when he said the doctor and family would have a discussion he meant a discussion about infanticide, as opposed to an end-of-life discussion, is a bad-faith misinterpretation.
@WWeingrad @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar He never suggested killing anyone. For the nonviable baby, the discussion he was talking about having with the parents was an end-of-life discussion‚ÄîIOW, how much resuscitation to do, whether to use a respirator, etc. Not whether to kill a baby.
@SgtKOnyx @philipe_the_don @MZHemingway @atrupar He was not talking about killing a baby. He was talking about dealing with a nonviable baby by having an end-of-life discussion with the family‚ÄîIOW, discussing how much resuscitation to do, whether to use a respirator, etc. That's all.

@MeeorxMox @PFTompkins But that's the question he was answering. A ridiculous q about whether a woman in labor can decide the birth will hurt her mental health and get an abortion. Instead of saying the obvious (No, that's ludicrous) he talked about serious fetal anomalies not discovered till then.
@MeeorxMox @PFTompkins Rarely, but it does. The NY law was changing provision that allowed late abortions only if life of mother at risk.	Health of the mother can be a v serious issue.	PLEASE read this post by an OB-GYN explaining in more detail than possible in a tweet: https://t.co/zfbCnBFepp

@MeeorxMox @PFTompkins Question he was asked was about if a mom decided her mental health couldn't deal with the baby AS SHE WAS IN LABOR, which is ridiculous, but he tried to answer it. Premise is mental-health justif for late-term abortion involves nonviable fetus. Words deliberately misinterpreted.
@MeeorxMox @PFTompkins No. Sometimes a non-viable newborn can be temporarily resuscitated. The discussion with the family would be about, say, whether they should be put on a respirator or allowed to go peacefully in mom's arms. NO ONE is talking about legalized infanticide. That's murder.

@sodacop @ChelseaClinton I don't spend much time worrying about Barron, but I do object when others make cracks about him. It's not about civility. It's about decent behavior. Children are not to blame for their parents' actions.	And Chelsea is understandably very sensitive to the issue.
@vincemancini4 @USJeanne @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads Then what's the point in his responding to the accusations? You've already mentally tried and convicted him.
@vincemancini4 @USJeanne @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads What is so strange about them? And would anyone care if not for that phony code? Seriously. Where does he say anything that implies he's a pedophile?
@USJeanne @vincemancini4 @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads If he says the image isn't him, would you believe him?
@USJeanne @criticsusan @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads OK, without applying the code, what evidence of crimes against children are in the emails?
@GrandmaDFP @Q_Memer_2 @Spseansp @johnpodesta @TRUreporting Yes, they do. It's very scary.
@sodacop @ChelseaClinton All true. And it's not as if Chelsea just popped up to defend Barron and doesn't give a damn about the other kids.	This 12-yr-old boy is not responsible for his father's evil acts. We can say that while at the same time fighting tooth &amp; nail to help the kids that 45 is hurting.
@RatBatard @ChelseaClinton And how does attacking another child fix that?		This isn't about convincing GOPers to leave future Dem presidents' children alone; they won't. It's about not taking shots at a young child with no control over what his parents do. It's just wrong.
@jlperez509 @ChelseaClinton Because his minor child is innocent. Junior, Eric, &amp; the Princess Royal provide more than enough material.		Chelsea's been through this. Listen to her.
@USJeanne @vincemancini4 @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads No such thing as dispelling a conspiracy with facts. What can he say about the emails except he's never heard of this code and was talking about food? Would that satisfy anyone? How would he prove it?	E.g., the spirit cooking thing's been debunked over &amp; over but doesn't go away.
@USJeanne @criticsusan @AndyKroll @longform @Longreads The content of the emails? It's only questionable if you apply to it a "code" INVENTED BY 4CHAN. Because otherwise discussions of pizza would raise no eyebrows.	A lot of art is disturbing. He doesn't owe anyone an explanation for that.

@Mr_Mask1337 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff That's true. I can enjoy being, say, Link.	But fact is it's easier for me to lose myself in a game when I'm playing as a woman. I imagine the same is true for many LGBT people or members of racial minorities.	It's easy to sneer at representation when you're the default option.

@GladdenHolden I didn't say that gamers exclude women, or that all gamers are alike. That'd be ridiculous. Just as not all feminists agree on everything, and some of us like games.	There's a certain core of gamers who are unwelcoming, though. You must acknowledge that.	Have a great night.

@karkas132 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff I wasn't saying you were a libertarian. I mentioned that because libertarian SF authors are notorious for inserting political lectures. Nvm
@karkas132 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff We'll have to agree to disagree, then. It's not a realistic historical simulation, it's a game. You wouldn't like the real 15th century.		But I appreciate your giving specific examples. Have a good night.
@Mr_Mask1337 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Love original stories myself, but there aren't that many out there.

@46_Ronin Me? Don't know who you think I am, but I've never fought for a AAA company in my life. I meant that I'm not "inside" the industry. As for the rest of gamerdom, I lurk.	I know nothing? Fine, link me to Grayson's review of DQ, &amp; I'll change my name to Jon Snow.
@FaustyRed @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Thank you for being friendly. Had a pretty rough day myself.
@GladdenHolden Thanks, but I don't play Destiny. Too busy these days for a game like that, I'm afraid. 		Depression Quest was, I thought, an interesting effort but not altogether successful. I enjoyed Gone Home. But hey, taste differences are what make life interesting.

@Marcopelli1 @scape55 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff You don't know what hard left is then, bucko. (I know some actual leftists I could introduce you to.) And "the left" is taking over video games. Sure.
@Marcopelli1 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff No, I'm using those terms because that's how you gamer bros act.		You think you own gaming and I'm an intruder. I've been playing since I beta-tested for Infocom in the 1980s, so don't try to fucking gatekeep me.
@46_Ronin @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff I never claimed to be an "insider." But someone who's so informed about the industry ought to know that Grayson never reviewed DQ. Why aren't you ethics in journalism types attacking the YTers who are in the pocket of AAA game companies?		"Women or LGBT wasn't an issue." https://t.co/b8BjpiynmY
@tjparrucci @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Sure, games never had retcons before feminism.	And an uncomfortable atmosphere? Can't imagine what that's like. üôÑ		Are women &amp; men treated the same online? Here's a study by researchers who played Halo 3 with both male &amp; female voices. https://t.co/gjWuZQ9fXL There are others. https://t.co/mkfCfRhuJR
@karkas132 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff I don't like preachy stuff shoehorned into any art form. (*cough* libertarian SF *cough*) But you guys act like asking for playable female characters or putting black people in a faux-medieval setting or just noting possibly unconscious sexism in games is an existential threat.
@scape55 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Sure, mock all you want. But directing vitriol at its creator isn't the same thing as criticizing DQ's gameplay or depiction of depression.		When Sarkeesian criticizes games, she's a horrible, threatening feminist bully. Why isn't that allowed? What makes it different? ü§îüßê
@FaustyRed @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff https://t.co/1TjBPlivpt
@tjparrucci @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Wow. Who fucking died and put you in charge? What makes me an outsider? My genitalia?		Why are you so threatened when things are *added* to games? Don't you want more people to play the games you love?		I guess not, based on the way women who game online are treated.
@7FruitfulTree7 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff How is it *your* stuff? You don't own video games or any geeky pursuit.		And please explain to me how "your" games have been messed up. Cite examples.
@46_Ronin @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Well, I've heard feminists *critique* sexist games, but I haven't seen any move to, say, ban them, or any hate campaigns against their creators.	If you haven't seen the freakouts about those games &amp; others, you're the ignorant one.	Can you even define "male gaze"?
@Josh_VEAG @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff Because gaming is only for you? Why does it bother you so much if others have PCs &amp; NPCs they can identify with? 	I could never be a warrior (nor could most people), but I love, e.g., being a spellsword in Skyrim, &amp; playing as a woman helps. You can still play as a straight dude.
@scape55 @GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff If you don't like Gone Home, don't play it. I don't like football (RL or video), but I don't freak out that it exists &amp; is popular.

@GrumpyCatterman @_Kenziepuff We're not outsiders. I was playing games before you were born. Nobody wants to take away your stuff. We want more stuff. You're the ones who freak out over the very existence of a Depression Quest or a Gone Home, or games w/ same-sex relationship options or female warriors.
