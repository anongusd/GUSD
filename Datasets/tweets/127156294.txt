Don't base your political ideologies on Facebook posts from your grandmother or memes. Go read up. Make these issues important to you.
"I don't pay attention" is a bad excuse to not vote. If you're 18, you're an adult - educate yourself.

Even with Trump's bad poll numbers DO NOT FEEL CALM. Election is in 3 months. You still have to VOTE. Don't assume he'll lose - then he wins
Don't know how people haven't left his side before now. Bailing now on bad poll numbers not after racist/bigoted remarks is telling.
Trump is utterly unfit to be president. It's time to take a side. If you're with him, the time to jump the sinking ship is fleeting
