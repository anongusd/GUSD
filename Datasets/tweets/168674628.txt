For those keeping comparative stopwatch readings on what happened in Hawaii:  If a missile was ever fired from North Korea to Honolulu, elapsed time to impact: 32 to 37 minutes	This morning, elapsed time to correct false alert: About 38 minutes...
You prove my point. As you say in pre-digital age the alert was confirmation. Today there are other factors that could trigger a cell-phone alert - and the cascade of events that follow. A hack. A mistake born of a shift change. A software flaw. Can’t assume old verities apply. https://t.co/nqFgcyDkxl
Hawaii false alert should be an early warning sign of what happens when the nuclear age collides with the digital age. Panic precedes confirmation; decision-times shrink. In Cold War we had more than a few false alarms, but they were detected before someone hit the panic button.
