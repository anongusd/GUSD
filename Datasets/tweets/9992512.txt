@galyonkin @eigenrobot @kilovh groups existed by early 2005 at the the very latest. and there were many schools on facebook by late 2004. i'm not positive but i assume NYU is on that list. point being: as a facebook user in 2004-5, i find it totally credible that that group existed
@galyonkin @eigenrobot @kilovh nope. these were public groups that people you weren't friends with could join. anyone could post/chat. here's one i created in 2005 that still exists and had posts from people (who weren't my friends) in 2005. https://t.co/Ed4docEbqg
@galyonkin @eigenrobot @kilovh I didn't go to Harvard, but I did go to another university that had facebook in early 2004. i remember making groups as early as 2005-6, e.g. one specifically about the 2006 world cup. your tweet is factually incorrect. because the internet.

@wrestkid @AOC Have a good day.
@wrestkid @AOC I didn’t want to argue either. You’re the one who said my math was wrong ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@wrestkid @AOC Of course the company decides who gets hired. They could hire ONLY black people if they really wanted to. Maybe they made a mistake not hiring any this round. Maybe none applied. We don’t really know. I was just showing the odds of a team of 12 containing none by randomness alone
@wrestkid @AOC How can you have 1.5 of a person? An average in a population is not the same thing as a count of actual people in a subset of that population. Have you ever taken a statistics or probability class?
@wrestkid @AOC Yes your math is wrong. Which was my point. I wasn’t arguing at all about human intervention. I was arguing purely statistics. For anything that makes up 1/8th of a population, it will only appear in 80% of sets of 12, by dint of randomness
@wrestkid @AOC What I’m saying (and I could show you equations if you really want) is if you randomly grabbed 100 teams of 12 people from the US population, roughly 20 of those teams would have zero black people. That’s just statistics.
@wrestkid @AOC You seem to be saying that every sample from a population should exactly mimic the population breakdown. Which is false. Look at the first 12 people in your phone contacts. Are exactly 8 of them white, 6 of them male, etc? Probably not. Samples from populations can and do differ
@wrestkid @AOC not quite. for example: take two people at random from the population. what are they odds both are the same gender? hint: it's not 0. 		in the case of a group that makes up 1/8th the population, in a random selection of 12, ~20% of the time, they won't be represented. math.
@AOC should black people be represented in media? of course!		should that specific 12-person team be dragged for lacking any? hard to say! depends on who applied, etc		also, stats: afams are ~1/8th of the population, so 0 in a group of 12 is not that anomalous
