Trump allies were worried about the choirboy defense. Now Kavanaugh is backing away from that, a bit. "I drank beer with my friends. almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. I liked beer. I still like beer."
A number of White House aides have previously, privately argued that if Kavanaugh truly is totally innocent, then an angry, indignant reaction is what you'd expect. And they're getting that now.

WILKES-BARRE, Pa. — Calling out the "fake news" is a hallmark of just about any Trump rally. But tonight, the president is repeatedly returning to just how unfair the media is. That said, the crowd is responding and booing, but it doesn't feel particularly vitriolic...
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. — Trump onstage re-enacting how he describes the rigors of the presidency to his wife: "I just stopped missiles from being launched every two seconds. Baby, what I did with North Korea was great."
WILKES-BARRE — Almost 21 months after Election Day, Trump just spent the first 10 minutes of his rally here reliving his election night victory —and the unfair "fake news" coverage of it.

To add some context to what we know now: A White House official told Tillerson on Friday that, in short, his days were numbered. But it is still highly possible that Tillerson officially learned he was fired from news reports and Trump’s Tweet this morning.
And worth noting that Trump — who made his name declaring “You’re fired!” but is not actually able to fire people — had an underling convey the news to Tillerson instead of doing it himself. https://t.co/OMJBLOOzNE

When it comes to behaving in a traditional, “presidential” way, Trump is less method actor and more One-Night-Only Broadway show. @michaelscherer and I explain.  https://t.co/b1bDtZF2Db https://t.co/bmJLyXBzPm
