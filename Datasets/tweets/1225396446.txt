((side note, these workers were not told that a union was conducting these focus groups))
When asked explicitly if a union would improve their workplace, they overwhelmingly say yes
A bunch of these workers know they are underpaid and overworked, and many of them intuitively understand that they need solidarity with their co-workers to act as one
Yet many of these workers say, explicitly or implicitly, that collective bargaining/collective action, is the best way to improve their working conditions, wages, etc
The reluctance to ask for more money comes from a fear of termination, retaliation of some kind, and general intimidation
These workers overwhelmingly say they believe their employer *could* pay them more, but many of them say they've been cautious about asking for more money
https://t.co/sG8sLuiTFt
As a note these retail workers were specifically retail food workers. In other words, it was non-union grocery store workers in multiple states across many demographics
It's both fascinating and disheartening
Retail employs more workers than any industry in the US, and the people working in retail seem to believe they are replaceable and should not be valued regardless of the profits that their industry generates
Many of these workers say they have little savings and a tenuous financial situation. And yet when asked to say what they think they SHOULD be making, many of them say they don't deserve more money, or only deserve tiny raises
These same workers might work as companies that are vastly profitable, but they don't understand that they play a key role in that profitability and thus, have real value
Retail workers tell the focus groups that they believe they are good at their job....but that anyone can replace them and high-turnover means they don't think their work will ever be valued
The retail industry employs more Americans than any other by far. More than several industries combined including fast-food, customer service, and construction.

“These refs have to make tough calls in the heat of the moment” https://t.co/xQ0H50ji11
@DanielPKearney @ColinCowherd Because it stopped a “‘maybe” touchdown earlier in the game and not a “definitely” first down with less than 2 minutes. Don’t be daft
@badgerfan2004 Or regardless of the outcome both teams should have possession of the ball like every other sport
@therachdunn @NickHaynes This is America. Which means whoever wins there should be hot takes about why they actually should lose.
Easy new NFL OT rule: both teams get at least one offensive possession. If one team leads at this point then the game is over. Otherwise we play until time expires
Crazy idea: NFL overtime should consist of playing until time expires with one team in the lead
I'm gonna spend two weeks deciding whether to root for Tom Brady, who I have never, ever rooted for, or rooting for the Rams, that left St. Louis and did so in the ugliest way imaginable
It's kind of nuts that you can win a game in overtime in the NFL without the other team ever having possession of the ball
I stand by my longtime assessment:		Tom Brady is very good. But he's also the single luckiest QB in history
My only consolation is that I know Mahomes has a lot more shots still left
NFL OT rules were garbage before the change and they are garbage now
An atrocious roughing the passer call and a bonehead offsides...
That Chiefs offsides call is gonna haunt them
That. Is. Not. A. Catch.
THAT'S NOT A CATCH
Brady and Co playing like they know they will score and it's intimidating
2 minutes left and needing a touchdown is where Brady eats		But the Chiefs are playing like a team possessed
If this comes down to Pats and Rams there will be endless discussion about how repeatedly bad calls put two teams in the Super Bowl that didn't deserve it
Essentially there's no recourse for insanely bad officiating
Chris Jones: **breathes**		NFL Refs: EJECTED!
Congrats on the Refs for playing a great game against the Chiefs
Chris Jones gently tapped Brady on the shoulder and he got the call. Hogan dropped the ball and he got the call.
The ball was OUT OF HIS ARMS and they called it a catch
The ball is literally out of his arms when he lands
Weird how every single bad call favors the Pats...
The bad calls help the Patriots. Only God's intervention helps the Chiefs
My cat has been more rough on me than Jones was on Brady just then
WHAT WAS THAT CALL
Brady generally plays his best in this situation. So we gotta be better. LET'S DO THIS
COME ON CHIEFS DEFENSE https://t.co/bAzPVbMaEC

THE LORD GIVETH AND THE LORD TAKETH AWAY
Ok but he WANTED to touch it
RT @woodruffbets: This is like the Zapruder tape ffs
What's the definition of "touch" tho....
This game might kill me
It took a while but that 4th down stop was what we needed		Yo Patty Mahomes, go down field and score.
Side note here that Sony Michel looks like a legit RB
Mahomes and Co have some momentum. Shut them down here and give them the ball
If ever there was a time for the Chiefs Defense to make a big stop, it's now
Someone help Mahomes take a single deep breath in the redzone. Bad pass earlier, not great one just now, and Kelce was wide open. Breathe young man. You got this
It would be nice if they'd give Mahomes a chance to drop back and make a throw without being chased every other play
Chiefs Defense is starting to show up. Offense owes them a good possession or two. Let's GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Rooting for Mahomes tonight reminds me of all the emotions I felt rooting for Peyton Manning for years as he faced off against Brady
@badgerfan2004 Wow, a tweet proving that there's at least one person at CBS that doesn't understand how clock management works
Just keep it within one score and the game isn't over
Just cut Mahomes loose and maybe there's hope
Mahomes blew an open pass and took an awful sack. I want them to win so bad, but that might be the difference between the young KC QB and Brady
RT @FleurtyGirl: https://t.co/4sCB9vQ5ed
If it's an LA/New England Super Bowl with a Maroon 5 halftime show then congratulations to whoever put that hex on me
You wonder how much psychology comes in to this game. Chiefs can't let Brady and Co intimidate them. They have to play like they know they can win
Brady will make few errors. His teammates might make some and you have to take advantage of them.
Mahomes is young and on his biggest stage ever. Patriots arguably walk in more confident, while Chiefs walk in with more raw talent. Chiefs CAN win this game, but it likely won't be the kind of game they are used to playing
GOAT conversations aside, Brady will have no nerves in the playoffs and that's already an advantage.
So Patriots look unstoppable in their first drive so.....I dunno, maybe it's time to take up prayer?
I'm doing my best to stay positive. Go Chiefs
Forget how most of St. Louis feels about the Rams.		Drew Brees deserved better than that
Somewhere deep down inside, when they are alone, a lot of these Rams players will have to look in the mirror and know they didn't REALLY win this game
The worst no-call in NFL playoff history sends the LA Rams to the Super Bowl because there's no justice in the world https://t.co/r7vx0pFiHM
Another no call on the INT of pass interference against Michael Thomas. Refs are handing this game to the Rams and I can't believe what I'm seeing
Dear New Orleans,		Stop running the damn ball
Listen to the man https://t.co/igFTud4WEi
If the Rams win this in OT it'll be seriously tainted by one of the single worst no-calls in playoff history
If the Saints lose this game it'll be as a direct result of a clearly terrible call and that's a shame
How much is the ref getting paid for this garbage call? https://t.co/fGz9krpvU2

If a giant rock monster is destroying London it kind of seems like you should call Captain America, or Dr. Strange, or even Hawkeye, for some backup
In Thor: The Dark World (which was bad) the stakes of the final boss battle involve literally destroying the Earth,  but for some reason only Thor is involved in saving us. Was Iron Man not available for that battle?
Also just a side note it's always weird in these standalone films when some big bad shows up and destroys a bunch of stuff but instead of calling the whole Avengers crew to deal with the giant flame and water monsters they just let one guy handle it
And if it takes place before then why not just say that?
I know it's a small point but *that* scene in Infinity War was moving, but if this takes place after it just sucks the air out of it completely
They should probably make it clear about whether this takes place before or after Infinity War

I know it's hard to imagine, but imagine the Chargers slapping around the Patriots and keeping them from an AFC Championship game.
Let's not forget the most important thing this NFL playoff season: Tom Brady losing. 		I know we lost the Bears to God's crushing punishment. I know the Eagles continue to succeed because of the arrangement between Foles and the Underworld		But we can still see Brady lose!
Ok if you're an Eagles fan you're allowed to be happy but how are some of you BRAGGING right now? You won because God punished Chicago, not because you played some amazing game
Dallas will lose to the Rams and the Saints will beat the Eagles....I hope....
@scottfaughn oh my sweet lord...
I honestly hope the Eagles get crushed by New Orleans next week but I think Foles' arrangement with The Dark Lord guarantees him at least one more improbable win
On an unrelated note, anyone wondering what Nick Foles had to give Lucifer in exchange for all of this? I can't believe only his soul would be enough

"Hmmm I see Adam McKay is doing a move about Dick Cheney. This, I am certain, is why Donald Trump got elected" - a person who is definitely an intellectual
This line from the piece sounds like something a condescending liberal columnist would write: " Those on the right elected Trump more to fight those like McKay than to fight those like Nancy Pelosi."
I actually think it's insulting to Republican voters to frame their support of Trump as a purely emotional act, which is what Shapiro does. How is that not an insult to Republicans who voted for Trump because they sincerely agreed with his "vision" for America?
"Hollywood being liberal is how Trump got elected" is a laughably dumb take. Like, as if voters in Missouri were *this close* to voting for Clinton until some famous actors told then to and then they were like "to hell with Tom Hanks! I'm voting for the other one!" https://t.co/wUH7CWyzsI

@jrosenbaum So maybe for clarity I should just call it "Clean MO" not "campaign finance reform." That's fair. But my underlying point stands I think. Hawley has been on the opposite side of 3 of the last 4 major statewide ballot initiative votes (if current results hold)
Missouri might very well elect a senator who took a position OPPOSITE how Missourians voted on 3 of the last 4 major statewide ballot questions because, again, Missouri is weird.	#mosen
@eapenthampy Oh ok so.....2 out of 3
So....Missouri is gonna approve medical marijuana, raise the minimum wage, and pass campaign finance reform but NOT re-elect McCaskill? (Her opponent opposed them all, right?)		Missouri you're so weird. #mosen

Fast forward 6 months. Tesla is launching its newest rocket into orbit around the Earth. Millions are watching as it shoots into the sky. Suddenly, everyone's TV and computer screen flickers at the same moment
But it's too late now. He awakens with the ability to control electronics with his mind. He's scarred from the lightning, and it has driven him mad. He rises from the ashes, Professor Catastrophe
Suddenly something happens. Just as he touching a delicate piece of equipment plugged into a socket a bolt of lightning hits the building and Musk is blown from the socket.

But I dunno I guess “immigrant saves money, enjoys soccer but wishes it was easier to watch in America” doesn’t really fit the president’s narrative that immigration is harmful and diversity is bad
My first job was working for an immigrant who came here and (at the time) ran 6 Subway franchises and was saving up to start a business of his own
One of my best friends came here from Colombia and he graduated college and his current job is to help immigrants find jobs and start businesses.
If he needs ideas there’s an excellent Greek restaurant not far from my place and the food is amazing, they recently expanded because business was booming, and both their kids will be going to college in the next two years.
Just for balance it would be nice if the president occasionally tweeted about immigrants that come here and start businesses to put their kids in college

@PressSec Yes that's what is shameful here very good Sarah you're doing great
@baseballcrank I don't have my bible handy but pretty sure "not everyone is my children with an equal claim on my time &amp; money" found its way into any of Jesus' sermons
@baseballcrank So treat everyone as a child of God, but also our fellow Americans are God's favorite kids? You can't say "put these people first" but also "we are all God's children" because you're implying some of God's kids deserve priority.

“Hey ‘Bron. It’s Chris Paul. I play for a  playoff-ready team  with James-freaking-Harden and we all know the score of every game we and pay no state tax. Also it never snows here. You down?”
And I want LeBron to stay. Hometown hero. Legendary player. It all makes sense. But he’s playing one of the best teams ever and every single year it’s like it’s more and more a 1-on-5 situation
Sorry but if you have a single man on your team who is even a little confused about the *score of the finals game you are playin in* in the final 5 seconds then it’s time to move on
There are Greek tragedies that aren’t that sad
Possibly the greatest NBA player ever and one of the best athletes of all time just lost a finals game against his greatest rival because his own teammate didn’t know the score of the game
I like LeBron and he’s amazing but if this game didn’t perfectly capture what it’s like to be him and play for this team then I don’t know what does

Then, he says they planted informants in his campaign, opened a corrupt investigation into “lies” about collusion, as well as investigating his past business dealings and the trump organization
The Vast Deep State Conspiracy that Trump is peddling is objectively hilarious. 		First, he’s claiming that the FBI/DOJ/Obama all made a decision before the election to stop him from winning

I understand not everyone is a good driver. But every cab I’ve ever been in is driven by someone who appears to be tempting fate.
How is it that every single cab driver is the worst driver on Earth?
Oh. 		We get to do the safety recording again. 		Awesome
The cabin door is closing! Are we close to leaving?
Some guy in a vest has been talking to the pilots for at least 5 minutes now so who the hell knows what happens next
It’s gonna be fun when we end up sitting in this full, tiny plane on the runway for longer than we are going to be in the air
Everyone is cramped, hot, and becoming angrier by the minute as they reopen the cabin door for the “paperwork” issue 		I sense the mood will darken quickly
“There’s been a paperwork error we have to correct. Not cause for concern” 		Paperwork
The recorded safety thing stopped in the middle and the flight attendant keeps talking in the little phone up front and staring out of the door window so I’m sure this is all great
Alright we are about to do this thing so everyone take a moment of silence for me.
The flight attendant is new enough that she’s reading the security thing from a script. She hasn’t memorized it yet. Fun.
Flying doesn’t make me nervous at all but I already had one very bumpy landing today because I assume they let one of the little kids up front fly
“Don’t worry folks it’s a quick flight of about 25 minutes. It’ll be real pretty except for the bumps” 		I’m clearly being pranked
Oh also I’m in the back row next to the toilet and someone has been in there about 20 minutes so it’s only downhill from here
“It’s gonna be pretty bumpy going up and coming down” 		This thing seems like one good bump will tear it in half
We’re flying to Hartford FYI
Pilot just now: “welcome aboard. We’re heading to......where we heading today? Hold on” 		If I die make these tweets go viral
This plane is so small I don’t know why they bother with an intercom system when thr crew could just raise their voices slightly
They sat me next to this man and my wife is 4 rows in front of me so obviously I’m being pranked somehow
I’m on the smallest commercial plane I’ve ever seen and they planted me and another big dude in the very back of this thing. Not sure which of us is more physically uncomfortable

@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd Thanks for the clarification
@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd That's fair enough. Quick clarification I'm curious about as a MO resident: Your proposal is that a 1% spending cut should be implemented equally among all federal departments, yes?
@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd Ok no complaints at all but how is cutting federal spending a solution for a state budget problem?
@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd Super fun fact: 1 complete 1% cut to the entire federal budget, even if all the savings was equally distributed to all 50 states and every dime distributed to Missouri went solely to roads, would ALSO fall short of the $825 million we need.
@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd I'm aware of that. But you said you didn't want Missouri to raise their gas tax, a proposal floated by folks looking to makeup for the budget shortfall needed to maintain roads and bridges here in Missouri.
@AP4Liberty @mcbridetd A 1% cut to the entire state budget would provide roughly 1/4 of the amount we need to fully fund our transportation needs

"Bill Murray shows up at the end to help"	Exec: "How does he get to the Toon World?"	"He knows the movie producer. A teamster drops him off. that's literally gonna be his line"
Exec: Um how does he die?	"The aliens also breathe fire"
"Oh and Foghorn Leghorn dies"
"Jordan will have a really fat sidekick who is bad at sports. He's super devoted to Jordan, but we'll never explain why"
"We'll see Jordan's house in this movie, but it won't be a massive mansion. No he just lives in a pretty nice house in the suburbs. Same house like a rich dentist would have"
Exec: What happens to the bad guy at the end?"	"Oh they shoot him back into space"	Exec: "Isn't he from space? How is that punishment?"	"SPACE JAM"
This movie has everything: cartoon performance enhancing drugs, a bunny love story, and Tweety Bird in an iron lung
“Also there’s gonna be a lady Bunny that Buggs really wants to get with”
“The half-time pep talk features Buggs Bunny and Jordan convincing other cartoon characters to take a fake performance-enhancing drug”
Exec: "How exactly do the Loony Toons make contact with Michael Jordan"	"Oh man did we not say? They yank him down a hole on a golf course in front of multiple witnesses!"
"Did we mention that Bill Murray's arc in this movie is that he, comedian Bill Murray, wants to play in the NBA"
Studio Exec: So how do they get good at basketball exactly?"	"They can steal talent. Like, steal it right out of someone"	Exec: "What does that look like?"	"After they do it the players forget how to drink water or walk straight. It's pretty debilitating actually"
The movie clearly states there's a cartoon character union, and I have so many questions about that detail
"The aliens are tiny and kind of cute, but they have 5 terrifying laser guns that could probably tip global power in favor of whoever had them."
"So when the aliens arrive they smash into a Piggly Wiggly parking lot"	Exec: "Why?"	"Uuuuh because deep underground is where Loony Toons live, obviously"
A huge alien spaceship roars over a crowd of baseball fans in broad daylight and it somehow doesn't merit more than "oooh wow" from anyone
And to be honest it's understandable that the park isn't doing well, since one of the rides is literally designed for the passenger to be blown off the ride and hurled across the park.
Bet you didn't remember that said theme park is named "Moron Mountain" which is definitely some anti-Disney shade being thrown
Think about how weird it is that the main villain is just an alien who smokes cigars who is mad that his alien theme park isn't doing well
At one point the main song has the following lyrics:	"Everybody get up it's time to slam now	We got a real jam goin' down	Welcome to the Space Jam	Here's your chance do your dance at the Space Jam	Alright"
The soundtrack for Space Jam is a brilliantly insane national treasure
And yet this movie is so beloved by people my age that the idea of remaking it with LeBron James was opposed solely on the grounds that it would sully a cinema classic
"Anyway after he saves all the Toons the aliens leave and Michael Jordan bumps into Larry Bird and some other dudes who make fun of him for being bad at baseball, so he decides to play basketball again. The End"
"So despite it basically being a 1-on-5 matchup and a few of the Toons possibly being cartoonishly killed during the game, Jordan still wins at the last minute with a final dunk after he's told that the laws of physics don't apply here"
"Oh, and Bill Murray is in this movie"	Studio Exec: Oh cool! Is he voicing an alien or something?	"No. No no. You misunderstand. Bill Murray isn't playing a character. Bill Murray is in this movie just being Bill Murray"
"See the aliens secretly sneak into the bodies of Charles Barkley, Shawn Bradley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues and steal their basketball talent. And like obviously there's a side story where all those dudes need therapy afterward but we'll get to that later"
"So the Toons recruit Michael Jordan to help them win this game. Should be a breeze right? NOPE!"
"And they want the Toons to be the new attraction. It's totally villain stuff."
"See the aliens have this evil plan to expand their theme park"
"So here's the idea: the Loony Toons have to play basketball against a race of evil aliens. If they lose, they become their prisoners"
If you had a severe fever and treated it by taking peyote, it would sound like the Space Jam pitch
Space Jam is an amazing movie but imagine how insane the pitch for that movie must have sounded to the studio heads

They think it's a victory. It's a scam. My taxes are going up. Vote in 2018 https://t.co/MbdTrzyTW1
RT @jonfavs: Democrats should talk about what happened tonight every single day from now until November of 2018.
So excited for all these big companies to get this tax cut and then give out raises
Look this is a side note but if you’re a senator named “Whitehouse” and you don’t run to for president then what are you even doing
McCain and Manchin seem like they’d get together.
Gotta factor in the alliances and assume McConnell and Schumer go down fast
Rightly pointed out: Tester could hang. Look at that haircut
@MitchMoonier the point is well taken
@jonesmarkh I make the rules here. No weapons. Senators ARE free to make alliances, however.
@MitchMoonier weak chin
@jonesmarkh Tell skinny dudes definitely have an advantage. Also, quality reference
Thune could hang for a while. Quick reflexes, big hands.
Sullivan has some serious evil behind his eyes, so he'd survive a while
Ben Sasse would do his best and go down fast. He's the dude who tries to be brave and dies fast
Harris seems like she could throw down. Manchin has an ugly streak. Kaine clearly has anger issues.
@Tom_Wright12 Sure but Yoda taught us the size matters not
Booker is a big guy. Strange is even bigger. Tom Cotton seems like he'd be fast on his feet...
Obviously we're bias toward the young in such a fight but guys like McCain and Sanders seem like the kind of dudes who would fight dirty as hell. Lots of biting and spitting
To be clear: Senators have no weapons. They enter only with the clothes on their backs.
100 Senators enter the thunderdome. Who comes out on top? Let's talk, Twitter.
I'm all for intellectual debate but I say we just decide all text legislation via Thunderdome battles
Honestly there's no way Marco Rubio is old enough to vote
@jasecart So will someone call me when they give my car to a 61-year-old millionaire or do I have to fill out a form

I turned off CSPAN did Republicans give my checking account to rich people yet?
McConnell: This is for regular Americans		People who do economics for a living: Actually it doesnt		McConnell: No but for real		People: No it doesnt at all		McConnell: Ok but like what if I do it		People: Please dont		McConnell: ...I'ma do it 		People: Why are you like this
Imagine that this is your take. Imagine being this dumb and then being asked to feed and bathe yourself https://t.co/6WbUzq0OQH
The GOP is about to raise my taxes https://t.co/7Yq0BeY3vI
So after they vote for the tax bill can we at least flip the script and be honest and make the GOP the party of raising taxes on average American families?
@jeremylafaver Someone needs to tag me in them

Probably high-time for Dems to remind folks that they don’t oppose tax cuts for people who need them. They oppose tax cuts for people who can already afford private jets.

There's something odd happening with the https://t.co/tdcQ76kqkP live stream link for today's briefing. Anyone know where I can find the ACTUAL live stream?
I'm not an economist, but it seems like giving the bulk of tax cuts to people who already have a lot of money is bad and giving tax cuts to people who don't have a lot of money would be good. Am I doing it? Is this economics?
