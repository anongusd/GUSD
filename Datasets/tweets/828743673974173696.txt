@mattbc The ability to explore the causes of and solutions to societal disadvantage imposed on people with impairments.
@mattbc This is where the work of the social model theorists like the newly late Mike Oliver meant so much to me. The ability to prise apart the difficulties that flow from my own being from those imposed by a society that does not support all members equally was central.
@mattbc Even if everyone was eventually forced into the long-term patient rolls, it would not follow that they accurately understand it's implications or predict what they would want when it happened. The myth that all our suffering flows from our own bodies and minds is entrenched.
@mattbc These are subordinate roles enforced by people who are me as their inferior.		Then when you throw in that those in the dominant roles have -- for many of us -- the power to control quality and/or quantity of life....
@mattbc There is a reason I am called an "autism patient" although I am not being treated for autism and that staff at my CIL call me (but not their disabled colleagues) a "consumer" although I do not use their services.
@mattbc First, there is a difference between having a relationship to a healthcare provider and being forced into a long-term or lifelong role, even if we do use the same word for both.		Second, not everyone has access to the relationship.

@kendallybrown @Amtrak They "need" to know that I will not ask the car attendants for help toileting.		The presumption that I will do that is appalling. All kinds of people behave inappropriately in various places: that does not void their communities' civil rights.
@kendallybrown @Amtrak @Amtrak has pretty much confirmed today that yes, this is the policy for certain disabled people. 		And that they do not have an ADA Coordinator or any formal ADA compliance although they say they do. 		And that I cannot pursue the ADA issues without a lawyer.
@kendallybrown @Amtrak When I said I did not know what I could do in the bathroom I was told that unless I answered those questions right then in front of everyone I would be denied boarding.
@kendallybrown @Amtrak I had not been into the bathroom because I did not have access on the Chicago to Denver leg so I held it and the car attendant who knew me from that leg was present.
@kendallybrown I checked in with @Amtrak ahead of time. I had multiple private convos with employees. They waited til I got in front of all the other passengers on the track and then asked questions about how I toilet that I cannot answer without going into the bathroom.
https://t.co/lt6No6vx2y
Or whether this web page might lead someone to believe there is an ADA Coordinator and the fact that the only humans it connect to only sell tickets means @Amtrak is pretending it cares about civil rights when it doesn't?
Anyone want to weigh in on whether singling people out for public discussions of toileting in public solely on the basis of disability is a violation of the ADA?
Shavonna continues to insist that @Amtrak has nobody whose job it is to comply with the ADA and if I want to pursue my claim that they violated my rights I am required to hire a lawyer.
She is forwarding the complaint. My case # is 5028261. @Amtrak agrees they can ask any passenger about their ability to use the toilet independently but basically acknowledges that only disabled people get asked.
I have explained what happened. Shavonna says this should not have happened. She does not appear to have any record of my earlier contacts with @Amtrak but that is not surprising as nobody took my information.
Shavonna is researching Monday's complaint. She says there is nobody who takes ADA complaints and no disability department.
Now I am on hold with Customer Relations.  I am dancing to the catchy music because that is the point, right?
2:59 I was told I was being transferred to Customer Relations. Omar denies being the ADA person.  He says he is in Rapid Rewards and will transfer me to Customer Relations.
To recap while I am on hold, I was informed on Monday that it is @Amtrak's policy that I must accept being sexually harassed in order to ride and this appears to be a disability-specific policy.
I am having trouble understanding Julie, the automated agent.  But after I clearly indicated that I needed ADA help and then just a live person she is transferring me to a reservations agent. This, by the way, is the same department that I got transferred to last time.

@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak When the car attendant came to ask me a question and I let the customer service supervisor know I needed to pause to answer it, she hung up on me.
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak I called customer service, which suggested this is policy and advised me to wait until this morning to negotiate boarding on last night's train, and advised me if I wanted to file a complaint to do so with the car attendant.
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak Apparently it is Amtrak policy to refuse boarding to any passenger who cannot give a credible account of how they will go to the toilet?		But as I was required to board last I had the chance to see no-one else was even asked.
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak The car attendant from the outbound leg confirmed that I traveled without incident a few days ago. But because I did not have access to the bathroom from Chicago to Denver I cannot confirm my ability to use it. This was not good enough.
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak Then I was informed that Amtrak policy requires them to deny me boarding unless I make certain statements about my toileting. Note that there was a line of passengers right there.
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak I was then specifically asked about toileting. I said I could not speak to how I managed in the train bathroom as I hadn't been in one of this design (on the outbound leg I had not been able to get TO the bathroom so I just held it from Chicago to Denver).
@WCTravelOrg @GreggBeratan @Amtrak I showed up at the station, checked in, followed all directions...		The woman taking my ticket asked me whether I need assistance. It is unclear to me what is regular versus special assistance so I specified that I needed the ramp deployed and my backpack removed from my chair.
Also @Amtrak thank you for telling me my only recourse if I did not agree to be sexually harassed was to miss the train and call someone tomorrow and then hanging up on me. That was excellent customer service.
Hey, @Amtrak , any reason you would single out a minority group passenger and demand they discuss their toilet habits in front of all the other passengers or you will refuse them boarding? Because this is ridiculous.

@SocialKeenan Oh, believe me, I know. This is in response to a filicide apologism article.
@meaghan_newell @slooterman @Nicole_Cliffe Your lack of empathy is showing. This child is a person too.
Only one perspective matters: that of the (presumably allistic) parent. 		To the point that it is literally still okay to go around talking about the desire to murder a child who is criticized for getting upset about pain, fear, or frustration.
You know why? Because nobody actually cares about the autistic child's perspective.		If the adult feels love in their heart while doing it, it is beyond criticism no matter what the effect; if the adult feels distress from it, it is beyond defense no matter the reason.
How come when a 5-year-old that we all agree can't help it is behaving in ways that are super distressing to the adults in their life that's "abuse" but you can't even say the choices the adults make that cause that much distress to the child are suboptimal?
@GreggBeratan Well, I was enjoying all the buttering up, though I did feel slightly bad when I pretended I could get you Oscar tickets.
The fact that the mother is described in the same terms as a police officer would be should tell you something. Just like a registry, this is a tool to help them manage us, not to help us avert danger.
And if you are in a dangerous situation with a cop or EMT, handing them something to read won't help you, and reaching for something to hand them can be a spectacularly dangerous thing.
People of color and Deaf/disabled people are wildly disproportionately shot and killed by police in this country.		Encounters with first responders can be fatal. Situations can start bad or turn bad fast.
Just watched a video about autism wallet cards, populated by white autistics who speak and only ever encounter calm respectful police. In one case the cop uses the wallet card to call a guy's mom and she "responds to the scene."
To the charming woman at the train station yesterday who stared, open-mouthed, from the moment the wheelchair-accessible cab pulled up to the moment I disappeared into the station...		...it's an easy mistake to make but I am not actually a Kardashian.

@AutieSpeaking The use of a wallet card to facilitate dealing with the police requires you to *reach* for it.		Reaching for something is an action police regard as threatening.		Part of the police mindset us that they deserve to go home unharmed.		So using a wallet card can get you shot.

@notanautismmom There are things I cannot express as clearly or effectively without AAC. 		And the device is part of me, part of the armor I put on to face the world and part of the interface I use to let the world face me.
@notanautismmom I'm a part time AAC user, and I have been a full time user as an adult. I have a full range of communication strategies, from a set jaw or a raised middle finger to signs to a chunk of echolalia that'll highlight absurdity to a friend and get her laughing. AAC is vital.

@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking You don't have black and white kids in the same classrooms?
@ClearAutism @sarahayars But the practice of accommodation-- which still needs major overhauling -- that is the on the ground work that teaches the skills.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism Of course we normalize it. That is what I am saying. But we don't take away the apparatus that enables us to provide it reliably.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking We don't need to teach ppl to make the perfect environment because it isn't possible.  We need to teach them to struggle with bad environments, adapting them while balancing needs.  It's messy but that is how it is done.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking You can't wait to see who shows up to build the toilets but you can do that with a lot of things in classroom and instructional design.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking In the US we have ADA Accessibility Guidelines. We have "accessible" toilets. Not everybody can use them. Some people who can't could use the toilets if they were higher -- but other people who could use them now would lose the ability.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking But we have access needs in conflict. 		Build really good lighting in for the blind people and if nobody blind shows up and you have photophobic ND people there, you have just increased their marginalization. 		Universal design is a great goal but it's also impossible.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars And yes, you have to also establish that William has a right to be there and be accommodated. Which we in the US have on paper but it's not really enforced.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars If x, y, and z are just nice things to do then when they vanish it is a lot harder to make the case that William isn't the problem.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars Little William shows up for school and you have in place an understanding that William needs x, y, and z to succeed, then when they get pulled and he fails you have an argument that William was sabotaged.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars Not real training because that has to be started years before the student shows up.		You are talking trying to patch specific holes.		And you're also proving my point.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking If just having more privileged people be around people who are marginalized brought genuine understanding and equality, school desegregation would have brought us a lot closer to racial justice than it has.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking People assume they know what we need. 		Put us in spaces they design and we get what they think we need and they conclude we are doing awesome.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking Not just geographic integration. Without the actual work of identifying accommodations we just reproduce the old systems. 		Here is a really old example of the kind of problem:  https://t.co/MDIKbeBsLK

And he is already getting PT and OT and internalizing the idea that he should be as abled and "independent" as he can. So this is a self-esteem thing.

Because everyone is already accustomed to thinking of things in ways that do not take those...
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking Is anybody going to stop and consider the impact on Dante and Lupe and Esther? Realistically, probably not. So one good thing gets weighed against a conflicting good thing, and maybe you pick the project, just for 3 weeks.

@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking So you are going through the year. There's a group of kids, they really don't need the space. They are okay with less movement. There's a group of kids, they benefit. Then There's Dante in the wheelchair and Lupe who is ND and Esther who is just going through hell at home.
@sarahayars @ClearAutism @AutieSpeaking Great, these are perfect. Let's say more space.		Now suppose the teacher has been trained that space to move around in is a general good thing and he sets up his classroom that way. But he is not trained to tie that good thing to specific kids. 		Anyway, space, yay.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking But anyway. Something that makes things better for everybody because everybody is human.
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking ... For one, that is literally what the label is meant to convey, and its use thus normalizes inaccessibility. For another it is rejected by most adult PWD for multiple reasons. For a third research suggests use of the label *itself* reduces inclusion and increases stigma.)
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking Also "kids with special educational needs" *means* "students the school is not equipped to educate." Do you mean "disabled kids" or do you want to preserve the unpreparedness? (I know this seems picky. But the issues around this label are complex...
@ClearAutism @sarahayars @AutieSpeaking How does that improve things for typical children who are successful in school?		How does training a 3rd grade teacher to reach Braille literacy help a sighted autistic?

I don't even really know how to talk about it. I don't.		But the deliberate use of physical pain to silence people is -- even when not a hate crime or even a crime -- a bad thing.		And still people argue with me on that. "It's who we are!"		Do they hear themselves?
And then you don't want to talk about it, lest you hurt those who do it by accident, who would never want to, or those who struggle when you put yourself in a position that you know has to be conducted painfully.
I don't know who is advocating the use of extreme pain on the Southwark protesters.		I know which of my "friends" are fine using it on me. 		The knowledge, actually, is worse than the pain.
I don't like conflict. But I want peace enough to engage in it.		I don't like being hurt over and over by people who tell me they love me. It may be unknowing, aware, or deliberate. 		But I'm not going away because I want to get closer to peace.
I keep going back to that MLK quote. The difference between the absence of conflict and the presence of peace.		I recall my parents on long car trips, demanding peace and quiet so they could relax in the front seat while I crouched in tiny spaces among the luggage, in pain.
"Divisive" is meant as a curse but may be an honor.
Creating divisions out of thin air is divisive.		Exposing existing divisions, even when they are unnoticed by others, is not.		But it is hard to tell if there us no division or one you can't see. Especially if you benefit from it.
There are diverse analyses, priorities, etc.		There are divisions.		Those divisions are the fault lines at which the shifting tectonic plates that produce hierarchies and relative privilege/oppression within the community and among the communities can be observed.
This is not meant as an attack on people but on the idea that we are one community with one culture and one set of needs. 		We are diverse as hell.		There are conflicting access needs, experiences of oppression, cultural expectations, etc.
It is fascinating to me that I am now watching srs discussions about whether something is a hate crime against disabled people (def. not in US, btw, but certainly intentional violence) that over and over disability rights leaders have defended doing "because it is who we are."

@acemindbreaker Again, my expressive power is better than core.		My ability to translate that into communication is severely constrained.  And as someone who was long-term total nonspeaking, now intermittent, mouth-communication makes a huge difference in if I am allowed to communicate.
@acemindbreaker Or efforts to empower people that stress learning appropriate conversational rules.		Yay fluid social navigation. But people get to choose to break the rules. And a lot of convos with certain types devolve to reasons I should not say this or that, not responding to content.
@acemindbreaker I'm an alphanumeric typist. More freedom in principle than core.		When I quit bothering with SLP it was partly I  response to their plan to train me how to order coffee at Starbucks. 		I don't have $ for Starbucks, I don't drink coffee, and I can already order food.
@acemindbreaker I mean, core vocabulary is vital.  I remember being handed an AAC device with all kinds of preprogrammed stuff that was ALL about going to the bathroom.		But I am talking more about the methods used and how they constrain communication even despite that.
@acemindbreaker Have you found that people trying to give you core vocabulary have unambiguously helped?		Because I have found it to be a whole lot more complicated than that.  But I already knew the vocabulary and needed the tools so I may be missing something.

@hayxsmith @jendatabasegeek @disabilisaur @adrparsons @ets_elec I take it back. I'm starting to see stuff to the effect that it is humiliating to see wheelchairs with Deaf people's names on them.		It is not humiliating to be mistaken for a different kind of person unless they are inferior to you.

@NJDC07 @RutiRegan Telling someone "Stop talking, you don't need to talk about that any more" is *exactly* a form of the ablism leveled at autistic people. What we "need to" talk about is our call. Ours. And you may not see how that plays out, but we who fight it every day do.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan Well, I am trying my best to convey my respect for you, but I would like to be respected too, and I would like my autistic ADAPT siblings to be respected, and if you are effectively telling people to shut up when they are trying to communicate clearly, I don't feel respected.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan You are not coming across as someone who is comfortable with autistic culture and communication.		At all.		If I am misreading you, I apologise.
@RutiRegan @adrparsons @hayxsmith @jendatabasegeek @disabilisaur @ets_elec Yes. Though it is unclear whether Nyle DiMarco would have had that experience or understand it.  Possible but not certain.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan But you are coming across as saying "My vision of disability rights depends on allistic people having the authority to decide whether autistic people can even communicate." And I think if you think that through, that is not a helpful way to deal with us even inadvertently.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan You may not have the cultural familiarity to understand this particular minority group communication and that is okay. Nobody knows everything.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan I can't speak for Ruti but I have had AAC snatched from me. I have been punished for saying things in institutions. I have been physically harmed -- recently, too -- for communicating in ways allistics don't like.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan Okay, I did read you correctly then.		And while I understand that you may not see the point in how different subgroups of disabled people communicate, I would ask you to consider the way telling us to shut up, basically, comes off to people routinely silenced.
@hayxsmith @jendatabasegeek @disabilisaur @adrparsons @ets_elec Yeah. As a wheelchair user I don't worry much but I get upset when people do it about intellectual disability.  I think for me it depends what prejudices I see far too much of.
@hayxsmith @jendatabasegeek @disabilisaur @adrparsons @ets_elec And it goes both ways.  I've known people to say, "Just because I use a wheelchair, that doesn't mean It's okay to treat me like I am Deaf!"		Nuance is hard on Twitter. I can't always sort competing interpretations.
@jendatabasegeek @hayxsmith @disabilisaur @adrparsons @ets_elec I think there is a level of nuance here.		If he's saying "Deaf/disabled people aren't all the same, make a system that gets us what we need instead of a hodgepodge of random "needs," I agree.		If he's saying "How dare you compare me to a wheelchair user!" I don't.
@NJDC07 @RutiRegan Could you rephrase this, please?		I'm not at all sure I am parsing it the way you intend, and I want to understand it.		Thanks very much.
@SnoringDoggo Hype up people who aren't your friends, too.

@dontony18kb @NBCNews You can use salt as a drug, by the way, to affect things like fluid retention and (thus) blood pressure. Salt is a drug that has a risk of cardiac harm. Nobody is trying to regulate Morton's though. Good thing, because we need salt.
@dontony18kb @NBCNews It's a drug. Anything you put on or in your body to change how it functions is a drug. And yes, that implies that we all use drugs all the time -- and that we should, though clearly we shouldn't be using them indiscriminately.
That looks like lazy or unskilled writing, casting, directing, and acting.		It's not coming off as just "punching down," but really low quality punching down.		I'd love to be convinced otherwise, but I'm not holding my breath.
And Southwark is expecting to get away with it literally because of the belief that someone like Laurence has no real viewpoint to convey, because they are depending on abblist/oralist ideas about nonspeakers not communicating, because of stereotypes about people like Laurence.
And we are calling this "representation."  It's not representation. It can't be. It's theatrical tokenism.
This can't possibly be a portrayal of a character that gets at a depth and individuality because in a context where every other character has the full range of bodily and vocal nuance to work from, Laurence is stripped down.
Laurence is nonspeaking and so communicates in many subtle physical ways: with his face, and his fingers and the way he holds himself on his toes and so on. The puppet shares legs with the puppeteer, but from the waist up all that nuance is lost.
... the motor and sensory issues that lead to that sort of thing happening unintentionally. By similar reasoning we could conclude Mummy and Daddy think it is okay to lock children up in ATU's where they will be horrifically abused, or whatever ... but I bet THEY have viewpoints.
We have a character who appears to lack a viewpoint. Literally the only internal info I have about Laurence is that he thinks it is okay to wee on Mummy's pillow, which probably just means he does it and nobody has thought through ...
We have a child character from a loving home that can't be portrayed by a child because they would see and hear things no child should experience.
We have a character from a group portrayed as inhuman violent, in a role whose physicality no human can match. (A small adult has not been discussed as a casting option, but that is a possibility.)
We have a human character whom no human can relate to. We have a character from a minority regularly portrayed as inhuman and controlled by outside forces, portrayed as inhuman and controlled by outside forces.
The remarkable thing is that nobody is talking about #AllInARowPlay as lazy writing.

@thinkingautism Oh, hell.		How my parents prepared me:		...		So that was a moment of panic.  Easter morning.  When, once they convinced me I was not dying, I was expected to wear a garment that was both white and crotchless (a dress).		Almost 40 years later it remains traumatic.
@ajmissu @RutiRegan @DemsLGBT It is possible to disagree with people without impugning their intellectual honesty.
@slooterman @frakincaprica @RebeccaCokley @SenSanders M4A *done right*, can definitely be a piece of a disability platform.  A piece.  And only if done right.
I don't always know what the right thing is, but if I have finally, after 20 years, found a place I can go and relax and it means I don't incite certain people who don't seem to mind me lacking access ... I'm not inviting certain people. 		Moving on.
How many of the people who want me to give this guy a hard time over his restaurant because it wouldn't work for them are going to go to one of the multiple inaccessible-to-me events I wanted to go to in Chicago in the near future?		Solidarity is hard.		But it goes both ways.
We discussed laws and physics, what you can and can't do.  He's got lower tables, happy to swap them out if I brought someone in who needed one.		I liked him.  I liked his place.  I'll go back.  It's far from perfect but it is one of the most accessible-to-me places I've found.
Was at a restaurant today.		The website said "wheelchair accessible entrance."  It was.  I don't know how you'd get a lift to the basement.  There is no elevator.		The tables are high -- which works for me.  The sensory environment was great.		I talked to the owner.

And yes, I **am** going to keep talking about job requirements in disability community adverts that screen out disabled people. Maybe you didn't consciously think through what the effect would be but we were having these talks in 1994, so it's time to catch up.
Autistic children are a gift.
It is never a good idea to say "No other minority group gets treated like this." Yes, the nuances differ, but the patterns of oppression are not creative. What's probably happening is, you are missing what others experience. We're nowhere near "the last acceptable prejudice."

@DieAloneFrail @MavenOfMayhem Yeah. Many but not all disability subgroups like IFL. It's a matter of learning the defaults and then adjusting for individual preference, because we are not unanimous. In general, people with intellectual disabilities prefer PFL -- for important reasons.
@MavenOfMayhem Thank you for listening. It can be hard to be criticized when trying to do the right thing. But it means a lot when one takes constructive criticism well.
@Theremin_Dee @freyaodin8 @glyphzau @AbbyNomNomNom @MavenOfMayhem Many disability groups prefer IFL.  Not all.
@glyphzau @AbbyNomNomNom @MavenOfMayhem What's better is listening to people about what they want to be called.  By and large, autistic people prefer "autistic people" so it is the right default; an individual may prefer "person with autism" so you would use that for them. Some disability groups, the default is flipped

@QueerlyAutistic @ish_vanilla @allinarowplay But this character is a puppet because no human can play him. That's dehumanising. It ties into the idea that autistics do things "for no reason," that we lack the same motivations and needs as other people.
@QueerlyAutistic @ish_vanilla @allinarowplay I personally would be fine with an all-puppet cast.		I MIGHT even be fine with the one character being a puppet if there were articulated reasons for it that were respectful and made sense and the puppet did not look like that.

@ZackBergerMDPhD @Ethnography911 There is stuff I know about my long-term disabled body my doctors don't.  And stuff they know that I don't.  And that's life.
@ZackBergerMDPhD ARGGH	That second should be hypOkalemia
@ZackBergerMDPhD There are some AMAZING docs out there.  There are some others too.
@ZackBergerMDPhD Other things doctors have told me: 		Hyperkalemia is dangerous, hyperkalemia is fine. Eat less potassium. (My potassium was 2.8.)		Nobody was ever harmed by fluid in the lungs. Stop whining. (Not long after: CHF diagnosis.)
@ZackBergerMDPhD The ER and inpatient doctors concluded this was "behavioral" and refused me a neuro eval. Now, most of it has resolved, so maybe no big deal? I can't tell.		But this is WHY I get medical information from non-medical sources.
@ZackBergerMDPhD Meanwhile, the hand strength doctor claims I have 50% strength in my dominant hand and arm as the other one. This was not true 4 months ago. 3 months ago I went to the ER with blackouts, altered consciousness, loss of speech and speech processing, and motor impairment.
@ZackBergerMDPhD Then it turned out a nurse in another department bungled the OT referral I asked for, to see if I could learn to use a helpful device given the leg issues, by specifying an OT who works on hand strength.
@ZackBergerMDPhD And I only even found this out because when I asked if his hospital was the place for the surgery, what with no wheelchair accessible patient bathrooms in it, he suggested I'd be walking 2 days after the surgery. Dude, I have a Parkinsonian condition.
@ZackBergerMDPhD Thank you. I am struggling to explain to a doctor now that the vascular surgery he wants to do on my legs will not cure a neurological condition that predates the condition he is trying to treat by decades. Yeah, I totally get stuff wrong. Not the only one.
@meowcarriemeow I'm done. I'm not twisting anything. If I'm not understanding it, you can explain it or give up -- your choice -- but saying "I don't understand" and then complaining when I try to explain is just not behaving fairly.
@meowcarriemeow What I am saying is, this stuff is regularly NOT in the news, and then people don't hear about it. Your assumption that it would be in the news is based on you NOT hearing about it when it's NOT.
@meowcarriemeow You have said this would not be allowed if it were any other group. I think that is naive.		You have said mainstream media would be all over it. This is clearly untrue.		You have agreed that there would be public protest &amp; this would be different somehow than this public protest.
@meowcarriemeow @MelanieCreane Suppose someone portrayed a person with Down Syndrome or ALS this way.  Or a refugee.  Or a terrorist.  Or a death row inmate. What is it you think would be different in the response?
@meowcarriemeow @MelanieCreane Okay, you are saying there would be protest. There is protest. You agree. It would be public protest. There is public protest. You agree. So what would be different? It would be bigger? No, you say. It would be... what, then?
Etiquette is the art of making other people comfortable in your presence. It is not a weapon to be wielded against those who haven't learned the same systems you have. Sure, there are plenty of people who do it the second way. They're jerks. https://t.co/DlLaWw78Tp
@meowcarriemeow @MelanieCreane Yeah, and we are not unique there either		Look, the exact nuances are always unique, but the way people get mistreated, the apathy or failure to understand, etc., are pretty consistent.
@meowcarriemeow @MelanieCreane I'm seeing outrage from the public. We are the public.		As for media outrage, a lot of stuff from other minority groups never makes the media or the kind of large-scale protest you envision ... and we miss that. That's the point.
@MelanieCreane @meowcarriemeow I think it is highly unlikely that there are rules preventing the portrayal of exactly one character in a play using a creepy puppet when that character is a member of a minority group.		Also, dehumanisation is hardly unique to us.
@meowcarriemeow @MelanieCreane When anyone says, "No other minority gets treated that way" they are invariably wrong.

@RyanLooney8 @DeafShowRunner ...well, I won't speak for you, but it's profound for me. 		This is not unique to the Deaf community and all people are individuals but in my experience it's pretty consistent.
@RyanLooney8 @DeafShowRunner Where you have to do 98% of the work to accommodate the mismatch between you and sighted people on a good day, Deaf people are doing 98% of the work to accommodate the mismatch with hearing people. And when you are suddenly facing someone willing to put in real effort...
@RyanLooney8 @DeafShowRunner And yet, once I explain the situation, Deaf people as a rule are kind, welcoming, and willing to work to communicate with me to a degree that is rare. 		I would encourage you not to shy away from working with Deaf people even where there are access conflict.
@RyanLooney8 @DeafShowRunner I'm gonna say this, Ryan. I have visual and auditory processing deficits. I watch terps in order to understand. I have repeatedly tried and failed to learn ASL. I have trouble with eye contact. I just behave like a boor according to Deaf cultural standards in so many ways.
@ThCornbreadHour Yes, but that's not what's being said.		If you know what you are looking at, disabled people are amazing. Because they have to be. They gave no choice.		Someday we will see true mediocrity because people will have the freedom to be mediocre.
@SemanaThompson If they were able to set up adequate supports for her to live with or near the people who love her she would be in better shape . The question is: is that realistically possible, and I don't know the answer to that question because I don't know that.
@SemanaThompson I'm sorry if I suggested otherwise.  That is one thing that shines through in the press coverage.  But she is probably being taken far from them and that means that in her everyday life they will gave little ability to keep track.
@SemanaThompson I apologise for jumping in like this.  I am totally unqualified to say anything on indigenous issues but I do know a bit about institutionalization and physical and intellectual disability.  If I have been unintentionally rude I am terribly sorry.
@SemanaThompson If those are not answers that would work, maybe they can at least get people started thinking about ways to get her a better life, a life where she isn't just an object of care but a daughter, sister, mother, aunt, valued community member, ... whoever she is to her community.
@SemanaThompson It's not a life.		I'm not going to presume to tell anyone how someone I know so little about, from a culture that is not mine, should live, but my hope would be that someone would talk to those who love her about things like home and community-based services and microboards.
@SemanaThompson And there may be good, kind, caring people working at the place who will do their best for her, but there will also be those who are just not skilled, or don't care, or are outright dangerous -- and there will be limits on what even the best staff can do.
@SemanaThompson She will virtually certainly be even farther from those who see her in those latter terms.  She will see them even less often, and whatever communication there is between them will weaken for lack of practice.
@SemanaThompson It is almost impossible to get a good fix on what someone with that level of physical impairment actually understands, but she will likely be treated as a collection of physical but few or no intellectual, social, emotional, cultural, spiritual, etc., needs.
@SemanaThompson So it is likely that they will be shipped out of state to an ICF elsewhere. They will be in a place designed for people with extremely high physical support needs who are assumed to have significant intellectual disabilities.
@SemanaThompson Yes. They have indicated that this was the only private intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF/IID) in Arizona. The state-run ones are unlikely to take many, if any, of these residents.
If everybody's guaranteed something, and that guarantee's enforced, it's a right. If certain kinds of people can have it taken away it's only a priv. If some people only have privs, nobody has rights, because the people in power can always re-designate anyone as a priv person.
Word of the day: priv 	Derived from: privilege		Noun. Freedom to have or do something which is contingent upon the agreement of the people in power.
@GreggBeratan @lauralovesian1 Either way, we are people, not props. I have little use for those who argue pro-life saying it's wrong to abort disabled but throw them away when they are born OR those who argue pro-choice saying it's wrong not to let ppl abort disabled.
Exactly.		It'll hurt too. But I love it when someone my age looks at a youngster and asks, "Is this what we fought so hard for? For them to take this hard-won victory for granted?"		Yeah. That is how we measure progress. When they don't have to know what we gave them. https://t.co/cjLq1kewTs

@SFdirewolf And yet that is what's going to be on offer, because no other institution in Arizona is likely to be able to meet what are seen as "her needs," which are all about the maintenance of her body and nothing about the maintenance of her rootedness in a community.
@SFdirewolf "Better" institutional practices rooted in seeing her as an object to be maintained rather than a person with relationships and a culture are not the solution here.
@SFdirewolf And all the forces that permitted this horrific abuse to happen to her -- all the racism, all the ablism -- will still be in force, but she will be even harder for her indigenous community to reach and try to mitigate them.
@SFdirewolf The best way to protect people like her from neglect and abuse is to support them in their own communities, where people know and care about them and see them regularly and will speak up of they notice anything wrong. Odd are she is now getting moved even farther away.

@cindymccain "If you see something, say something" can be valuable when you are able to recognise danger in what you see. An adult and child who may not be closely genetically related is not itself a danger sign. Could be an adoptive mom, stepmom, aunt by marriage, nanny, neighbor....

@JessicaVdV @Hannahgadsby @The_Kris_Guin No, you clearly don't, because you are proposing taking our ability to communicate before finding out if an emergency is going to happen.
@JessicaVdV @Hannahgadsby @The_Kris_Guin I don't have diabetes. But no, people on continuous glucose monitoring are on it for a reason.		We've reached the limits of my willingness to participate in this conversation if you are seriously proposing your aesthetic preferences trump other people's health.
@MelanieCreane Oh, yeah, ALL of this comes from an allistic "autism expert" who claims to be a disability rights professional and is backed by a number of people who claim to represent us.
@MelanieCreane Crap I have heard: 	Autism is a "behavioral health need."	If people in "sensory overload" (meltdown) do not follow directions, they need to be forcibly transported to a health care facility for immediate treatment.	This treatment may need to include seclusion.
@Wes72971 @slooterman @GreenDayAngel @thinkingautism Thanks for acknowledging what kind of entity you're working for, @Wes72971 		We are working toward a society in which that kind of thing isn't tolerated.
@Wes72971 @slooterman @GreenDayAngel @thinkingautism So if 90% of people would "fail," that's just evidence the providers are incompetent.
@Wes72971 @slooterman @GreenDayAngel @thinkingautism He's probably right because most DD providers set the independent living programs up wrong and guarantee failure.		Independent living, done right, provides needed supports to ensure success but unethical programs insist that people have to manage with highly restricted supports.
@ClearAutism Good luck. I'm glad your son has you.
@hassankhaderali I'm hanging in. Thanks for your friendship.
@ClearAutism Also you will be laughed at and criticized. You will be counseled to be realistic. You will be told you are abdicating responsibility and exposing him to danger. And some days you will wonder if these criticisms are accurate. You will doubt yourself and him.		But it matters.
@ClearAutism And framing it as supporting his choices will itself help you to see how he can be helped to choose better than if you see them as your choices. It will help others to see him as a young man with agency who is to be respected.
@ClearAutism Though I would suggest that it is important for you to support him in making his own choices, with appropriate supports, to the maximum extent possible. And yes, I grasp that we are literally asking you to blaze new paths through what looks like impassable brush. But it matters.
On the subject of how people get treated when they are/aren't presumed to be able to communicate:		https://t.co/sKavsMp9k0
@hassankhaderali Hi Hassan.  Thinking of you.  How are things?
@Metra you're telling us the elevator is our at Van Buren. There are TWO elevators at VB. There is a workaround for ONE. The other does NOT affect all trains. Please tell us WHICH elevator so we can plan. It's winter and adding unnecessary blocks to the commute is a big deal.
I'm plugging this again in case anyone wants one.  It's an April autism anti-awareness tee I designed on @Bonfire.  Available in green and pink, it has a blue light bulb with a red circle-slash. https://t.co/l9D96juP19
The only comfort I have is that in order to be in that thread, a person has to have SOMEONE who is receiving the communication, paying attention, and caring. That is far from nothing. But it is not enough. Because what was done to them can't be undone and is being done to others.
And with that comes the presumption of humanity and the moral obligation to treat people as human. I've been tortured in an institution. It is shattering. I have never recovered. And the people in that thread are talking about torture too. How do we DO this to people?
The presumption of competence -- which includes actively observing and following up on clues, it is a way of being in relationship, nor an attitude -- is one of the necessary anti-ablist steps that people confronted with those they believe are "too disabled to ___" must take.
I went to an advocacy director once when I couldn't speak and said, "I'm in the room but not getting enough access to understand, so my participation is limited. I could do SO much more if I were accommodated." She told me she thought I was doing a GREAT JOB. I cried.
This is part of what abled privilege looks like -- the ability to decide that someone is unable to do something and therefore stop them doing it. It's not necessary consciously or cruelly intended but it hurts.
If everybody in a nonspeaking person's life thinks they can't communicate, they are right. Nobody can communicate without a receptive communication partner. If everybody thinks they can't engage in self-determination, they are right -- because the people are stopping them.
Just read a thread with parents talking about what their nonspeaking kids are doing after institutionalization that they never did before, that indicates the specific ways they were abused by staff.		I am not inclined to draw the trolls over, so not linking. But hell.
@BlondeHistorian If people are acting like they are lost, I might ask them if I can help them find something.		Don't think I have ever seen a blind person acting lost. I'm sure it has happened at some time in history. I just wasn't there when it did.

@speakingautie @DeafShowRunner I can buy a DVD at one price and watch it myself. If I want to show it to a group, I need to pay more for the bigger audience. (Which I can't afford so I don't.) 		This isn't about anger or your Twitter skills. This is about you taking other people's labor without paying them.
@speakingautie @DeafShowRunner But a lot of creatives, they do the work first, then they go looking for the contract. Maybe they get paid, maybe if nobody wants what they made, they don't. But when you show the film, you are under obligation to pay. That's the deal.
@speakingautie @DeafShowRunner Listen, this is not about your feelings. It is not even about @DeafShowRunner 's feelings. You remember when those TSA agents were working and not getting paid? That's wrong. You work under contract, you get paid. We all get that.
@speakingautie @DeafShowRunner @FilmDigMedUCSC Okay. Get a DVD. Put it in. Read the anti-piracy warning. This is what it means. If you are a film student, then even if you don't want to work in film some day you probably know someone who does. This is how that person hopes to eat every day and live under a roof. By being paid
@DeafShowRunner It surprises me that film students wouldn't see the value in paying filmmakers for their work.
@JessicaVdV @Hannahgadsby @The_Kris_Guin That's 2. There are others.

@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman Okay, go back and reread the definition.  It's not the number of people. It's the loss of control. Group homes depend on shared support staff employed by the provider. That guarantees a loss of control.		I have no idea what support needs you have or how they were met.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman That is not even a good pretend attempt to answer my efforts to grasp what you are attempting to convey.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman Now, the Settings Rule does not treat all group homes as institutions.  So okay, you can make a case there.		Also the Settings Rule, while it offers important protections, is far from adequate to guarantee self-determination or integration.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman Yes, group homes are institutional. This isn't exactly a real point of contention. It's like asking "Would you consider a 7-11 a store?"
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman What two?  		And how does the fact that New Jersey now offers some limited protection against some of the worst institutional settings mean nobody is advocating for any institutional settings?
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman And yes, we are making slow progress toward disabled people being guaranteed the same liberty rights as others.		Your claim was that no parent in Jersey advocates for institutional placement. Go look up the People First of Canada definition of "institution." It's continual.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman A developmental center is a kind of institution. If it weren't, we wouldn't be having this conversation because their existence depends on funding earmarked for institutions. In fact, it is one of the paradigmatic examples of institutions.

@aneeman The most exhausting part of the health care nightmare is not watching my life dribble away because of provider apathy and incompetence;  it is having to cooperate with the pretense that they are caring and skilled and that I personally like them that is required to get this much.
@PuckerSjb @ElenaHung202 @voxdotcom Even if it were clinical terminology, your suggestion that you as a parent and clinician should have more power over what people are called than the people the themselves us ridiculous.
@PuckerSjb @ElenaHung202 @voxdotcom That's nice but irrelevant since it isn't clinical terminology and it isn't appropriate.
@mattbc Being an adult often comes down to looking around, not seeing anyone who is both better placed and willing to do something scary, and plunging in.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman It happens next to none of the time that parents advocate loosening the settings rule, that they build neo institutions like the ones they report building, that they try to get the DC's and ICF's and SNF's and group homes to admit their children?

We can do better as a society, and justice demands that we do better.
So no, disability institutions are neither places for people who can't be supported in the community (though they do collect people who have been failed by existing community services), nor are they beneficent places filled with experts. They aren't even benign.
Everyone is capable of some kind of self-determination and should be supported in having it -- because it is a universal human need.		(And before you tell me about people with "profound" Impairments you don't think I know about, yes, I have supported a number of them.)
Some people's need for self-determination is actively denied; some people's capacity for self-determination is active denied. But while self-determination can look so different for some groups than others that we literally do not yet know how to promote it for all ...
In an institutional setting -- in the best institutional setting -- this need is compromised by the very structure of institutional settings. The institution's needs must also be met, and must often be prioritized, for it to keep going, and that limits self-determination.
Meanwhile nobody has special needs, though some of us meet those needs differently than others.  And one common need is self-determination, the ability to control significant aspects of our lives.
And no, those relationships do not look the same for all pairs of people, but EVERYONE is capable of having them -- with supports.
In fact, nothing can be made perfectly safe, but an integrationist model with well-trained, well-supervised support workers and everybody being regularly seen by people who are in voluntary, mutual, caring and reciprocal relationships is the safest.
You also have structural forces protecting the harm done by the careless, incompetent and malevolent.  Their neglect and abuse literally cannot be rooted out by the nature of institutional settings.
Even where you have skilled and devoted professionals, you also have the careless, incompetent and malevolent.  In small facilities you have an ebb and flow; at times you can have really solid staff.  But that can change fast.
Thread.		If your argument for institutionalizing people is based on the idea of skilled professionals devotedly meeting their special needs, you do not understand institutions.
@Wes72971 @thinkingautism @slooterman I do mind you asking.  And yes, it happens all the time in New Jersey.

@aligits @SFdirewolf @GreggBeratan @RebeccaCokley Or if you think "If she can buy peas, I bet I can rise to the top of my profession!" no.		Rebecca can be legitimately inspiring. "Oh, I'm gonna be like Rebecca and refuse to book jobs that aren't fair to people with less privilege to me" is legit.
@aligits @SFdirewolf @GreggBeratan If they are a passive part of your imaginings of the world and you yourself are passive or are inspired to unrelated action, not legit.

@adrparsons I've sat in too many meetings where someone said something and someone else repeated it and took credit to want to be that person. &lt;wry grin&gt;
@adrparsons Sorry.  Did not mean to repeat. I missed it.
Thanks for listening, @KamalaHarris
But including us also means tapping into a rich, diverse, passionate, innovative, tenacious community, a people I believe you would love as much as I do.		We have as much to offer you as you do us.		And I hope you, and all the candidates, will take advantage of it.
Including us means meeting with a diverse array of us and learning about the complex patterns of injustices our extremely diverse community struggles with, because #NothingAboutUsWithoutUs		It means actively addressing voters with disabilities. #CripTheVote
But we need to hear it.		We need to know we are not an afterthought to you, or a community to be taken for granted.		And so I am asking you, please, @KamalaHarris , to acknowledge ablism in your list of wrongs and to include us fully in your vision for the future.
@KamalaHarris  I believe you believe in an America where disability discrimination is a thing of the past. I was in your office last year meeting with one of your staff members about the Disability Integration Act and I celebrated when you became a cosponsor.
... but you have also seen your colleagues elevate the judge who made that ruling to the Supreme Court.		Yes, we have come a long way, but disabled people in America still face overwhelming injustice.
In your Senate tenureship you have seen a woman with an intellectual disability testify as to the consequences of a ruling that women with ID do not even need to be allowed to voice their opinions before being forced into abortions ...
In your Senate tenureship you have seen your colleagues move aggressively to take from us the health care protections President Obama put in place and you have seen us fight back.
In your lifetime you have seen the resounding promise of the ADA issued from the White House lawn. But you have never seen full enforcement and consequently we are still denied some of the most fundamental goods of our society.
In yr lifetime you have seen children with disabilities win the right to public education &amp; the closing of Willowbrook and Pennhurst. But many disabled kids still don't get that education &amp; many states still have state institutions full of people with developmental disabilities.
We have come a long way in this society since the days of the Congress of Milan, since the days of the so-called Menace of the Feeble Minded, since the founding of organizations like the National Federation of the Blind and Little People of America.
Deaf and disabled people of color face significantly worse conditions than Deaf and disabled white people. Deaf and disabled women face significantly worse ... well, you get the picture.
It goes on and on, @KamalaHarris 		I could tweet at you all day about the structures of ablism in the United States, and still my disabled community would be able to point out glaring omissions in my list.		And then there are the intersections.
When people in unremitting pain cannot access pain management and people dealing with addiction cannot access medication-assisted treatment and face calls for Narcan rationing, that is ablism.
When people in mental health crises asking for help are frequently turned away but others are forced into traumatic institutional settings, that is ablism.
When people with mental illnesses face a dearth of community services so dire that many are homeless (and discriminated against in shelters) or caught in the correctional system, that's ablism.
When people with physical and developmental disabilities and elders are routinely forced into institutions simply because they need services and the Medicaid system is set up so that there are waiting lists for funding to receive them in the community, that's ablism.
When people with chronic illnesses are simply left out of society, over and over, while in many cases struggling to access health care they need to survive, while constantly having their access to insurance threatened by their own government, that's ablism.
When blind people cannot access much of the internet and other information necessary to full participation in society, that's ablism.
When young adults disabilities face a loss of critical services as they leave K-12, and disabled people generally face staggering unemployment rates, that's ablism.
When disabled schoolchildren continue to be tracked into segregated settings or given inadequate supports in the mainstream, may be denied literacy, numeracy, and general academics, and are too often just sent home, that's ablism.
When deaf toddlers are denied access to language out of the fear that is they learn to sign they will not put in the Herculean effort to accommodate the audist prejudice that speech is superior (although acquiring a first language sets a kid up to learn more), that's ablism.
When the abortion rate for fetuses with Down Syndrome is roughly 4 times the abortion rate for all pregnancies, largely based on inaccurate information and stereotypes held by the general public, that's ablism.

3. Access is a right.		Explain clearly, in language that is easy to process. This isn't always easy but it's a skill, and you can improve.

@LidsRodney @LauraSedorPhoto @ClearAutism @girlziplocked Because it isn't about support. It was never about support. It is about anxiety. It is about preventing bad things from happening and we allow the bad things we imagine might happen to distract us from the bad things we know are gonna happen the way we do things now.

Also he is probably the best primary care doctor I have ever had.
And okay, maybe there is nothing anyone can do about it, but wouldn't it be worth, I don't know, a really minimal neuro exam such as I have been asking for since the blackouts and stuff started months ago?
So rapidly progressing neurological impairment is being written off as "Eh, that's life" because he assumes it is caused by lymphedema.
And he does not think this is unreasonable.
So today I was asking my primary care doctor about significant loss of function since November, and it turns out he is just making assumptions about the cause of my disability that directly contradict what I have told him, without any investigation.

@SFdirewolf And yes, I have seriously thought about not getting care there. But so far they haven't tried to force me into an institution and they haven't told me they think the best thing is to let me die, so I am disinclined to go back to one of the other places just for the potties.
@SFdirewolf In fairness, he works at the hospital without wheelchair-accessible bathrooms in ANY patient rooms. So even though he is right next door to a "senior residence" I suspect he has not got experience with people who aren't going to just accept barriers.
@RutiRegan It makes me angry and sad.

A real commitment to consent is hard. It means living with anxiety and doubt and sometimes with the knowledge that something bad happened that you foresaw and didn't do everything in your power to stop.		I think it is worth it.
I'm not a big believer in the people who tell me about their commitment to consent.		If you are only pro-consent when the choices go that way, it isn't real, you know?
... and it's still consent if you've been sat down and credibly told the only way you're seeing daylight again is to submit, ...
And once I found out it's still consent if you agree to it only because a couple of big, armed cops are standing there saying, "It's going to happen. We can do it the easy way or the hard way, your choice," ...
Consent also goes out the window when politeness gets dragged in. Well, you can't say no, you'll hurt my feelings. (My feelings are hurt that you are trying to manipulate me this way, so we'll call it even.)		Or social convention. "You have to, everybody does it."
Or just "You have to." You have to. 		Not even "Okay, there are formal rules here, and so it's not a choice between A and not-A, but A and not-A-but-also-no-more-B." Just "You have to."		Or the A/B thing but where the consequence is just made up on the spot.
Or "If I were you, this is what I would want." That is the fundamental idea behind substituted judgment, that someone else knows better than you what should be consented to.
CN: rape, abuse		When someone says "It's not rape if you like it," we all get horrified, but there are a lot of things where people justify force by saying "Most people are grateful later."		Which is usually not true - you just learn what you gotta say - but also irrelevant.
Basically, consent is awesome as long as everybody consents to the right things. But if you say "yes" to a "bad choice" or "no" to something "important," then consent is redefined or thrown out the window.
CN: rape, abuse in thread		Consent is a fascinating thing.		Almost everybody likes it in the abstract, but when you get into individual situations it's a different matter.		Suddenly exceptions abound.

@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro One of the ways to treat us as people?		Respect our preferences -- the general defaults and the individual choices -- about how to describe us.		I'm not a person with autism because autism cannot be prised apart from who I am. And I don't need it to be. I like myself.
@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro And let's be blunt -- anyone who has to be prompted by person-first language to see someone else as human wasn't ever gonna respect their humanity anyway.		That is a reality every autistic I know lives with: most people don't see us as human. So it matters when treats us as ppl.
@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro Of course, we wouldn't need to be humanized were we not already dehumanized. One of the ways we get dehumanized is other people trying to sever our rights from us -- such as declaring how we should be referred to.
@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro But as it is, I'm pretty much in line with the majority of the group, which means that the most humanizing *default* description is the one we prefer.
@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro As a human, I have certain rights. One is to define myself. If my preferred terminology were not well-liked by other autistics/disabled ppl, it wouldn't be a good default, but it would be the right terminology to use if you knew me and were talking about me.
@bigvegannerd @NPRJoeShapiro Where exactly did you hear @NPRJoeShapiro use the word "autistics"? Over breakfast at yours? Then maybe the circle did not include any autistics. If it was on the radio ... we're out there. Some of us have radios. And "humanizing" language is language that treats us as human.
It really is amazing the lengths people will go to, to ensure that we know we are not welcome.		Today the doctor's office is all upset that I showed up with a wheelchair. This is not my first appointment here. The wheelchair is not new.
@Help4Aspergers Would you try to make friends with someone if the main thing you "knew" about them was "lack of social or emotional reciprocity"?		It's not *remotely* accurate, but that belief is so incredibly damaging to the lives of autistic people.
@Help4Aspergers You know, one reason autistic people struggle to make friends is that parents and professionals are out there telling everybody what lousy friends they are.

@CoryMoesta @DennisG_Shea @xan_desanctis Wrong again.
@WolfKomoki People on welfare are often disabled in such a way that they cannot navigate the process of getting disability.		And with more people than jobs, people who desperately want jobs can't get them. Those people can't eat.		Etc. The moral model of welfare is inappropriate.
@CoryMoesta @DennisG_Shea @xan_desanctis No, it's not. This comes from Paul. The Gospels carry a message of radical love, which you are conveniently forgetting.
@CoryMoesta @DennisG_Shea @xan_desanctis No, I adhere to the standard that your personal morality is your business but politically we must treat one another as equals. 		And that includes these students.
That disabled people, far from having less value than others and far from being perpetual saints, are some of the most beautiful and ugliest, most joyful and hardest-grieving, complex, wonderful people in the world. 		#ThingsDisabledPeopleKnow

This is #AccessToProtest -- finding ways for people who struggle with the existing ways to be heard. And I think it is vitally important.		Because if there is one thing disability teaches us it is this: there is not one right way to do anything.
We can do two things about this: 		We can and should broaden access to old ways, using remote lobbying and teaching potential callers to use scripts and voice-mail hours, fundraising, etc.		We can also invent and celebrate new ways for new constituencies to participate.
So how well do our tactics serve us?		I would argue, not well. Not the whole community. So often we fall back on direct action with at least the threat of arrest, lobbying, or call-in days. Each of these is highly valuable, but each is also inaccessible to many.
And then there are the tactics. To some extent the activists discipline themselves to serve the tactics, because that is part of working in concert -- but it only works if the tactics serve the activists.
Another barrier is financial. 		Some kinds of activism are more costly than others but even very inexpensive forms are inaccessible to poor people.
Another barrier is access to each other. 		One person cannot achieve much, but in groups we are powerful. Who has access to group membership? Who knows when and where the meetings are and can get there? Not everyone can travel; not everyone is online.
Different subconstituencies have different information needs. Some need different information than others; some need information presented differently. Some need different amounts of time to think. All need reliable sources and the chance to ask for whatever has been missed.
One barrier, clearly, is information.		To participate, people need to be able to make up their own minds. To do that, they need reliable and thorough information, both about the issues so they can decide what they want and about the context so they can decide how to get it.
We shut our own people out. 		We suppress our own people's participation.		And then we wonder why so few people are out there with us, protesting, speaking up.		So: what are the barriers, and how do we address them?
And every one of us deserves a chance to participate in that conversation. Every one of us.		But the forms of that participation are too often ritualized to the point that there is only one way to do it, or a few ways, or only one way or a few ways are celebrated.
If the last two years teach us anything, it should be this: access to the political process is vital.		And I don't just mean voting. Voting is one piece of it. It's a vital piece. But the rhythm of communication between elected official and constituent is faster.
If disability teaches us anything, it should be this: there is not one right way to do anything.		The expectation that we will all do things one way excludes people.		Celebrating only people who do things one way devalues people.		And we deserve better.
That no-one has rights. Your "rights" can so easily be stripped from you in a heartbeat under existing procedures. And even before that happens they aren't enforceable. It's all privs. 		#ThingsDisabledPeopleKnow

@epballou @johnrobison @slooterman @IACC_Autism As for the others, you will have just made it harder for them to get the community supports they want and need -- and some of them will go into institutions because their families can no longer cope, and institutions are all that is available.
@epballou @johnrobison @slooterman @IACC_Autism Now, some of those 20,000 will take those funds and go to institutions, not because they want to but because they will have been assured by the government and by people who make policy that they are NOT institutions -- and they will be trapped.
@epballou @johnrobison @slooterman @IACC_Autism What you are talking about is taking limited funds available for the community -- in my state we have 20,000 people with developmental disabilities alone waiting for those slots -- and redirecting them to institutions.

And yes, you have to add in the fact that the people doing the traumatising often do not mean it that way, legitimately have no clue, and really struggle with the concept that what they think of as benign or praiseworthy should be changed.
And yes, supporting already-traumatised-to-the-point-of-violence people rather than resorting to "violence is the only thing they understand" is really challenging.
Yes, it absolutely takes more effort to design schools, adult supports, crisis services, etc., that are in fact non-traumatising and supportive of self-determination than to find slightly less lethal ways of destroying lives.
I do not, and never will, regard finding "better" - less lethal and more aesthetically pleasing - ways to be violent against disabled people "disability rights."		Yes, all else being equal, no guns, no prone restraints, etc., is better.		But all else doesn't have to be equal.

@notanautismmom @fishytaste @ddmfhsuk Twitter is harsh but I am grateful I saw this post today. 		And grateful to Mr. H for talking about the consequences of constantly being subjected to the moral model too.
@fishytaste @ddmfhsuk @notanautismmom Yeah. I get that a lot too and I am sensitive to it.  But I just honestly don't think this was that.
There is more that I want to say about this, about the social acceptability of slipping the suggestion that things would be better -- for me, for the world -- into the conversation, but I don't know how to say it without risking hurting the feelings of people I love.
The 8 of us, usually social, sat silently and looked at each other and stared at our plates. I don't know what the others thought. I don't know what I thought. I was recently diagnosed as autistic, a fact my coworkers knew. I didn't know what to say or how to say it.
The dinner table conversation, which was exclusively between the other two staff, was about Christopher Reeves, and it came down to this: if they were disabled, they'd kill themselves.		In the home of 7 people whose lives were contained by the disability system. At their table.
We were all disabled: I had first met one of the other staff1 in a day program for group home residents, and the third staff had mobility impairments.		3 were nonspeaking; a 4th was functionally nonspeaking and a 5th was very hard even for those who knew them to understand.
The night of Christopher Reeve's injury, I was working a shift at a group home.		There were 10 of us at the dinner table that night: 7 people who were funded to live there, me, the live-in staff person, and 2 people from the 3 to 11 shift.		https://t.co/SjaeMDcAK4

#DisabledLife is friends sharing vacation snaps of accessible and, er, "accessible" bathrooms they have visited.
Keep in mind that this is the same health care provider who does not understand that just because a Foley cath would mean I could use bathrooms I can't use now, that doesn't mean straight cathing will achieve exactly the same results.
Okay, anybody want to help me explain to a health care professional why 		[Dyspraxia] + [Used to could do it] + [Substantial loss of function] + [Can't do it now] = / = [Spend the money to buy the device that requires me to do it] + [Guaranteed success]		?
@lokisfool Oh, yeah.  It's a freaking spiral because as more and more that I can't do piles up, I'm hardly getting less overwhelmed, am I?
@maysoonzayid And I've had a fair amount of solicitation to kill myself for others' convenience, too. A teacher. Am employer. Students, when I taught.
@maysoonzayid As someone who has not always been able to speak I get it from other disabled people too.

Yes, we should be upset by it. But in practice almost nobody ever is.		This is a perfectly palatable idea to almost every allistic I know. 		So why is it upsetting people today?
I don't understand why people are so upset by this.		The idea that autistic people, by being autistic, force allistic people, especially family members, teachers, and other people close to us, to murder us or place in life-threatening situations, is thrown at me every day. https://t.co/JhVzI0zhbd
@DrSamiSchalk Suggesting that the ANYTHING of a 51-year-old is not that of an adult is a whole other thing.  		And that is the idea at the core of a whole bunch of human and civil rights abuses, so I'm not going to agree to silently disagree on that one.
@DrSamiSchalk But suggesting that the mind of a 51-year-old is not the mind of an adult is a whole other thing.
@DrSamiSchalk On a separate subject, my reasoning at 16 wasn't much different than it is now.  I have vastly more information, 35 years later, but the basic processes were there.		Now, you can feel free to say "Cal can't reason worth a damn" and I will disagree, but okay.
@DrSamiSchalk And mental age theory has been used to subjugate a number of different groups regarded as the intellectual interiors of their subjugators.
@DrSamiSchalk I am 51 years old. 		Whatever the qualities of my reasoning abilities, they are the reasoning abilities of an adult.		To say otherwise is to embrace the ideas inherent in "mental age theory," which posits that some adults are childlike, or "really" children.
@KathleenSoprano @slooterman This is something "disability advocates" have told me in the last year.

@mattbc Saying "Well, let's ignore what happens after people need health care misses the point and will miss the point as far into the future as we can now imagine.
@mattbc Once people need health care, how should it be distributed?		On the basis of "willingness" (often code for ability) to pay?		On the basis of a utilitarian scheme?		Or on the basis of need?
@mattbc Certainly there are social determinants of health and we should take those seriously.		But social determinants are not the only things that result in ill health and/or disability.		Moreover, we cannot control all the social determinants because some people immigrate.
@mattbc But inside airports?  They make sense.  Other than getting felt up by TSA (I can't go through the scanner) and assuming I accept that my brain is not going to work well enough to do work, it can be fun.		The flight is another matter. 25% chance of damage to chair, 50% to me.,

@stevesilberman @slooterman @JustStimming @autismspeaks Interesting fact: apologising to YOU is not the same as apologising to US.
@slooterman You don't need a BA to do most things.  Employers use it as a proxy for having certain skills, but not all 4-year graduates have those skills and plenty of non-graduates do.
@slooterman In general, if you are hiring in the disability field ESPECIALLY you should be thinking through what your requirements are intended to achieve and whether they actually are necessary.

@GreggBeratan @smartasscrip And a fair number of neurodivergent people are photophobic, and a fair number of those specifically have trouble with fluorescents.  		Now, maybe there is a system built in for accessing it that I don't know about ... but almost nobody considers that access issue.
@GreggBeratan @smartasscrip Realistically from the picture it is highly unlikely I could be in that room long enough to do my business but also given how airport work it's not at all clear I could get into it in the first place.
@GreggBeratan @smartasscrip Second, there is no way they aren't going to restrict access to something like that, which basically guarantees that you have to interact with people to get in.  This makes AAC use challenging and requires a host of relatively typical social interaction skills.
@GreggBeratan @smartasscrip Well, so far all I have seen is the coverage.  It's pretty much got to have no windows so you have to have lifhting.  Odds are the lighting is fluorescent and not variable -- two issues -- and clearly it is all white, maximising the lighting issues.

@AndyEyeballs @slooterman @JustStimming @Sblahov Further, it has the effect of continually denying certain people access to protest, and not only is that wrong, we can't afford it.
@AndyEyeballs @slooterman @JustStimming @Sblahov And it makes more more sense to impose a way of doing things that best fits one disability subgroup on others than a way of doing things that best fits abled people.		It's generally ablist and tactically uncreative and it doesn't work.
@AndyEyeballs @slooterman @JustStimming @Sblahov When it comes to certain kinds of disability.  As a white middle-aged wheelchair user generally identified as female, I have a completely different risk/reward than a young black man who walks unassisted but moves in atypical ways.

@RobBrady3 @SheenaMcfeely @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @NAACP I am well aware of that and that racism, audism, and other forms of ablism all disrupt what should be a unified movement toward universal justice today.  There is a specific black Deaf strand of the movement for a reason.
@RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @SheenaMcfeely @NAACP You are comparing one small piece of one movement to the entirety of another.  Of course the parallels fail.		But this is how we move toward equality. One fight at a time.
@SheenaMcfeely @RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @NAACP No, they aren't protesting in the streets. They are doing it in the courts and the state houses, in Congress.  Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it isn't happening.
@SheenaMcfeely @RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes And I apologise to every Deaf person in this thread if I have overstepped my bounds here.
@SheenaMcfeely @RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes And take a look at black Deaf history in particular some time.

@SheenaMcfeely @RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes I am not Deaf. I am hearing with auditory and visual processing disorders so I use captions but am unable to learn ASL. But the history of Deaf resistance in this country is a proud and defiant fight for equality against horrific oppression.

@RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @SheenaMcfeely The majority should not have the power to deny the minority full and equal membership in society.
@RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @SheenaMcfeely And since you are going to ask, yes, I have been jailed, beaten, raped, imprisoned long-term, and experienced other similarly unpleasant things for wanting equal rights in this society. Not everyone I was young with survived this.
@RobBrady3 @cowboysarah @jon_jmp3362 @AMCHelps @seanforbes @SheenaMcfeely Actually, while race and disability are certainly distinct issues, the ability of disabled and Deaf people to live in the same places and use the same facilities as everyone else is a civil rights issue.

@slooterman I agree but they can also be awful.  A good faith community is amazing but not all are.
@Marcieee94 @ShannonDingle Does that help you understand what we are doing? If not, feel free to ask some more.
@Marcieee94 @ShannonDingle But if someone self-identifies using a word for a category they fall into  (I have "earned" "crazy" but not "blindie," for example), it is ablist for someone else to correct them.		So while I realise you intended no harm, you went a little close to the edge.
@Marcieee94 @ShannonDingle And that gets us to point two. A disabled person self-identified using a label appropriate to their disability. It's nobody else's role to judge that one. 		I get being curious and asking "Why do you use IFL, not PFL," that is cool.
@Marcieee94 @ShannonDingle But many others, like the neurodiversity and independent living movements, prefer identity-first. So that is a good default for people in the categories those movements grew from.		If someone prefers something other than the default for themself, respect it.
@Marcieee94 @ShannonDingle First, there are substrands of the dis. movement. The self-advocacy movement, which derives from the people put in what were 100 years ago called places for "the feeble minded," prefers person first.  Person first language is a good default 4 ppl with intellectual disability.

Quick Guide to Apologies		5: Reality		If you owe an apology it is not about you, but about the person harmed. It is really easy to shift from the real issue to how you feel or why you aren't a bad person but that makes it about you. So don't. 		Take care of yourself later.
Quick Guide to Apologies		4: Notpology Examples:		A. I am sorry you ....		Apologise for what YOU did.		B. I am sorry but ....		The focus is on the harm, not why it happened.		C. I am sorry this happened.		This is a statement of regret, appropriate when you're not responsible.
Quick Guide to Apologies		3: Expectations		5. You don't have to think you are a bad person. You probably aren't. You do have to agree that you messed up and that your intentions don't make it okay.		6. Nobody else owes it to you to stop being angry/hurt or accept your apology.
Quick Guide to Apologies		2: Followup		3. Change your behavior so it doesn't happen again.		4. Make amends to whoever you have harmed, at least indirectly if they don't want you to or you can't do it directly.
Quick Guide to Apologies		1: Initial apology		1. Grasp that you did something harmful. Acknowledge what it is and that it was you who did it. You don't have to agree that you meant to harm, just that you harmed.		2. Express regret that you did it and for its effect on others.

@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful YOU came into a discussion where people you didn't know were discussing something that is painful to them and then did the thing.		That does not entitle you to "understanding."
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman Feel free to enlighten me on how I did that.
@LikeJanus @mattbc I agree with you there except for one thing. Mental illness advocates *are* disability advocates. It is ALSO an issue that certain people have hijacked the word.
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman Anyway, I'm out. If you want to bump it up to a conversation about the ideas, feel free to ask me to get involved again.		But if you can't do any better than name-calling, it's boring. They sell toys where you push a button and get more valuable discourse for $14.99.
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman We are on Twitter discussing preschool level ideas that elude you, not in a seriously challenging discussion. 		"Don't use who people are as a putdown. It's not nice" does not require expertise. Just social skills at the same level as "Don't knock down Jane's block tower."
@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful It was ugly. 		And if it is a one-time glitch, fine. Everybody makes mistakes. But literally all we know about you is that your child's grief and pain only appears to matter to you for how it makes you feel.		And we get to have feelings about that too.
@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful But that is EXACTLY the formulation  you used to express your beliefs about your child. You attacked her. In public. To strangers. As a way of diminishing their own pain and focusing on how awful it is for you to have someone like them in your life.
@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful Suppose I said "The problem with you is your lack of love for your child. Her cat was put to sleep and not one hint of understanding of how she expressed her deep emotional pain."		How would you feel? Attacked. Justifiably. Because I would have said you do not love your child.
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman No, I just thought you would find it comforting to hear from someone you would regard as an expert.
@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful Seriously, something this child loved died and she is getting trashed in public for not following NT conventions for expressing grief.
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman I'm sorry, did someone's words upset you?		Wait, I know someone who can explain to you what a loser he thinks that makes you, if that helps.  He's called @joeytradesstuff
@slooterman @joeytradesstuff @salbob16 I am sure this person is vastly more educated about disability politics than little old me.  I have only been doing it for 25 years.		Let's not disregard the vast experience it takes to use slurs in casual conversation.
@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman Sorry, what laws have I advocated for?  I missed where I did that.		If you remind me what I said I will review it.
@mthcklbrry @neurowonderful What has been difficult for me is the knowledge that my emotional and physical pain is utterly irrelevant to allistics.

@joeytradesstuff @salbob16 @slooterman Really?		Guardianship law is ALL WORDS and results in people losing all rights.

@slooterman There's a good chance you will get better at it as time goes on.		I'm not good at it because I DO feel ravenously hungry when I have had plenty or full when I need to eat, but I get by.
And it's not okay to give someone a hard time about it if they aren't drinking. https://t.co/5glqfGTaoE
@slooterman I have always been in kind of this position.  I have cues, they just don't line up with whether I need food.		One thing you can do is menu planning.  Figure out roughly what you probably need, eat a good estimate, and then check secondary cues, like do you feel alert or sluggish?
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Confirmation bias.		I really dislike interacting with parents of disabled kids -- oh, except [reasonably long list].
@RebeccaCokley @criprights And I know these people are parents, and I may interact with them as parents (if you matter, then what matters to you matters, so your kids matter), but again, that is not how I am classifying them in my mind.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights The good encounters? Either I am not thinking of them as a parent because that isn't the most relevant part of their life to our relationship, or I already know and like them and they're just [Name] who is brilliant at X and likes Y and also has a Z-type kid.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Almost any time I have a brief encounter with someone I think of as a parent of disabled kids, it goes badly, to the point that I will go out of my way to avoid them.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights The parents who aren't like that? They aren't honing in on your disability. Either they're raising their kids and leaving you alone and you never meet them, or they are in the same spaces as you doing something relevant and *that* is the focus of the interaction.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Not suggest that the kid would be better off with a wheelchair than too tired to learn because all her energy goes into struggling with that walker she can barely move with.		Whatever.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Not suggest that maybe drawing with marker on the wall is not actually a safety issue and should not be treated as a life or death thing.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Not recommend graphics interface AAC for their kid with really major motor control issues because "his mind is fine" and "pictures are insulting."
@RebeccaCokley @criprights So it's not about you finding a way you are comfortable with to help them. It includes an expectation that you will support them in their ablism.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Now, in principle, that doesn't have to go badly. People fill wants and needs in each other's lives all the time.		But combine it with the "Parents know best" attitude and the pervasive ablism, and most of the time they see their ablism as a virtue.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights Because why do you know that?		Because your disability is the one thing on which they want to base a relationship.		Usually that means they want something. That's the relationship. You filling a want or need in their life.
@RebeccaCokley @criprights I think the thing is, when you aren't a parent run into someone and the first thing you know about them is that they are a parent of a disabled kid, that is a bad sign.
@temasmith @slooterman Also, not having the infrastructure to build inclusion -- except in cases of genuine, unavoidable and known scarcity -- is a form of conveying exclusion.
@slooterman @spacedoutsmiles I read this post out of its context in the thread and wondered why you were buying up exceptionally loud guns.
@NeedsNYC @RebeccaCokley I hear that.
@RebeccaCokley At the same time, though, I want to stress the difference between friends and flesh-based reference works.		I know you don't do this, Rebecca, but a lot of parents of disabled kids say we are their friends but ONLY value us as tools in childrearing.
@ada25celebrate Maybe when we get to @ada50celebrate the posts will be about the lives WE build FOR OURSELVES, whether or not they approximate abled lives, not the way that the abled pat themselves on the back for our ability to "overcome" the obstacles they imagine for us.
@NeedsNYC @RebeccaCokley This is really cool.		Question, though:  do YOU have nonspeaking friends?

@mattbc If you start saying, "Every child can be educated in a properly designed and supported inclusive program and this child has a right to that," then suddenly the focus is back to program design and supports.		It's much easier to blame the kid for being "special."
@mattbc And who is served by that distraction?		Not the kids. Not even the parents (as noted, they get other rewards from the euphemism). It's the people who do not want to restructure schools and teacher ed to ensure that schools are prepared to meet all students' needs.
@mattbc The ideology of "special needs" in school is, "this kid doesn't fit into our school because there is something non-fitting about this kid." "Special needs" is a euphemism for "unmet needs" that distracts from the fact that not meeting certain kids' needs is a choice.
@mattbc You know how abled people are always saying about (some of) us, "all behavior has a function"? It works the other way, too. Asking who benefits from something and what role they play in it can be useful.
@madisonlessard Ablism.
@linedancepro @RebeccaCokley @DrJasonJohnson @Starbucks Children do not deserve to be treated that way.
@linedancepro @RebeccaCokley @DrJasonJohnson @Starbucks "Wheelchair bound" is inaccurate and rude. Preferred term: "wheelchair user."		Dismissing someone as "a down's" is dehumanizing. Preferred term: "person with down syndrome."		"Nonverbal" is problematic although there is disagreement there. I recommend "nonspeaking."

And just as you would not appreciate "heartwarming" videos about how you totally messed up your septic system but out of the goodness of their heart a plumber came out and fixed it up even though you don't deserve it popping up on YouTube, let's drop the inspoporn.		Thanks.
Look, if you can go potty "all by yourself" (hint: thank a plumber for your "independence"), by all means, do it. It's very convenient. If someone else can't, let's make sure they have assistance, just like there are plumbers available to you.
We need 		1. Better education on diversity.		2. A commitment to ensure the supports are there.		3. An unmistakable line in the sand: we are ALL entitled to full membership in society.		4. An understanding that controlling others is abuse, and abuse protections.
4. It serves certain people to have others in their control. Some (not all) parents and a distressing number of (not all) professionals reap significant benefits from controlling others and do not want to give them up.
(cont.) We have a fire department because people need help to put out fires. We support members of our society all the time. We should support all of us, not just those in valorized groups.
3. A belief that needed supports should not be provided. This requires seeing certain typicalities as necessary for full membership in society. We have a transit infrastructure because people need help (roads, tow trucks, public transit) to go places. (cont.)
2. Fear that atypical supports will not be provided. It seems easier to "fix" the person than provide the supports.		It's not.
1. Lack of imagination. When "everybody" who has a good life pees in a toilet by themselves and can mix juice from concentrate, it starts to seem like those things are integral to having a good life. Then they become the focus.		Knowing people with atypical but good lives helps.
We know this. We know this. We have known it all along.		So why do parents and professionals hold the building blocks of a good life hostage to not needing atypical assistance?		There are at least 4 answers:
Parents and professionals get very upset about people not being able to dress themselves, feed themselves, and so on. But none of that is actually a barrier to a good life. 		What is a barrier to a good life? Not having access to self-determination.  Isolation. Stuff like that.
And then what?		"Not independent" is used to DENY you the other kind of independence, freedom from control.  		Let's use the independent living movement's definition of independence: controlling your own life, including any needed support services.
If you need supports that are not typically provided, suddenly they say you are "not independent."		Remember, nobody is independent that way.  But you get singled out.		It's not about what you can do, it's about whom society is willing to enable by providing the needed supports.
But what if you need different support systems than a lot of people?  What if you need help bathing and dressing, or you need a wheelchair or AAC, or you need structured help with decisions?		No, these are not "special needs" -- they are ordinary needs met in uncommon ways.
What you may be is dependent on common support systems that are pretty much invisible.		Try living in a neighborhood with no grocery stores, or getting a safe drink of water in Flint -- try managing where those systems have broken down -- and you will get the picture.
Guess what?  Nobody, or almost nobody is independent in the "without help" sense. Did you weave the cloth or spin the yarn that made your clothes?  Raise, butcher, grow, and harvest your meals?  Fell trees to make your house?  You aren't independent.
"Independent" means two things.		Sometimes it means "without help" and sometimes it means "without being controlled."

Second, those things are not what give you a good life.  You can walk and talk and go potty?  Yay you!  Enjoy it.  I know plenty of people who use wheelchairs and AAC and diapers and physical assistance and are cool people with good lives.  Yay them too!
First, many people with intellectual disabilities can do those things.
Finally, this is always correlated with a bunch of blanket statements about things people with intellectual disabilities can never do.
Third just because one thing is correlated with another thing and the second thing is bad, that doesn't make the first thing bad.
Second, not only is autism not an inherently bad thing, neither is intellectual disability.
First, saying something is not a bad thing is not saying it is a good thing.  It is a thing.  There are all kinds of things in the world, and they are different, and that is fine.

@slooterman @emccoy_writer @AutisticLocs That is true.
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav Sure you did. What do you think all these unnianced people are reacting to?
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav You have been defending parents having a bad day and coming online and saying all kinds of horrible stuff. Because people aren't responding to what they can't see.		You keep saying "two sides." We have heard your side. Now you hear the other one.
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav Imagine an employer knowing the kid used to do something work inappropriate, or a college asking if this kid will fit in.		Is you venting here rather than there worth those risks?
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav You don't know how this will boomerang on your kids. You don't know.		I believe they are cherished. But you don't know.		And this is minor. Imagine a kid being taunted "your mom wishes you were never born."  "Your dad thought of leaving because of you."
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav There are consequences. Imagine your kid's future in laws reading this and sitting the betrothed down to say, "Do you really want to raise kids like these?" and having it sink in. Or the kids in high school taunting them "your mommy thinks you're a burden. It happens.
@Sophie88403973 @lennydotdotdot @ahnya_rambles @autisticbruce @ShonaDav Oh, for crying out loud.		Acknowledging the challenges and putting them out there for the whole world to see are different things.		And the internet is forever. How they feel today and how they feel later may differ.
@ahnya_rambles @Sophie88403973 @autisticbruce @ShonaDav Okay, then I have no idea what you are talking about and I am too embroiled in dealing with the ppl who are promoting what happened at Guiding Hands to sort it out.  It is not your fault that I don't know but I need to step away to cut down on the frustration and overload.
@Sophie88403973 @autisticbruce @ShonaDav But there is no nuance in someone who has been horrifically abused reaching out over and over and being name-calling and subjected to details of how other parents abuse their kids and venting?
@autisticbruce @Sophie88403973 @ShonaDav If someone explains how to handle that like we are all on the same side and there is nuance so you know the child is surviving.....
@autisticbruce @Sophie88403973 @ShonaDav See, the ones I get into fights with are openly and actively promoting physical violence and the denial of human rights.		And yeah, I try the nuance thing.  At a certain point "I am maybe taking a drive to the country with my kid and he is never coming back" isn't venting.
@Sophie88403973 @indigocrosley @ShonaDav You do not think the parents who fight for guardianship, institutionalization, seclusion and restraint are oppressors?

@Sophie88403973 @ShonaDav And are there things about neurotypical children that create burdens?		Because we only ever talk about one set.
I have a question.		What happens to a Christian child who says "That much oil couldn't possibly last for 8 days"?		Is it the same as a Jewish child who says "Santa is your mom and dad"?		(Not conflating miracle/Santa, just looking at beliefs someone else might doubt.)

@slooterman @KaiserKarinna It's like claiming royalty is open to all classes because every time you go to the palace you see stable hands from impoverished backgrounds.
@slooterman @KaiserKarinna A CIL just told me autistics with policy backgrounds were not needed in the conversation about what autistic interests are because they have "people with the diagnosis" present when the crips decide for us.
@slooterman @KaiserKarinna There are times I deliberately refuse to claim all that stuff even when I can.  When everyone else in the room lists all their accomplishments and I say "I read and write" and then proceed as if OF COURSE they will treat me as an equal. But unless it comes from you, yes.

@slooterman @Silverstar98121 @lauralovesian1 @aneeman @JustStimming The ability to have any chance to affect the things Access Living is doing is a privilege compared to not.  And trust me, they have zero interest in benefitting me or people like me.

@lauralovesian1 @slooterman @Silverstar98121 @aneeman @JustStimming Actually there is something I am trying to learn about that might interest you.  It will take a little time.  I will tell you if I find out anything good.
@lauralovesian1 @slooterman @Silverstar98121 @aneeman @JustStimming I would start by going to an existing union and saying, "I want to unionize my people. Where do you suggest I start?"		I think there is a challenge because usually people unionize around specific jobs.  But I know in segregated workplaces disabled people are starting.
@slooterman @Silverstar98121 @lauralovesian1 @aneeman @JustStimming The problem I have is, no access AT ALL to the work, which itself matters to me, if I don't do it for free.		And yes, I struggle with the ethics of that.

@Spectrum Until you learn the difference between people and those who want to manage them, you aren't ever going to address the people's needs.
@Spectrum Where is the variability in furniture?		Why is the running around space cavernous, echo-ey, and full of unavoidable light?		Why does it all have a Panoptocon feel?
@Spectrum The part of how a sensory environment affects seat-time stamina?  That is managing a child for an adult's purposes. Designing a sensory environment FOR an autistic person addresses the need for a sensory environment no matter what the person does with the increased resources.
@Spectrum And what is that "shutting out the world" garbage?  You see the students actively engaging with the world -- the point of modulating light/sound is to make the world accessible for engagement.
@Spectrum Nowhere is that more apparent than in the section where you address the bit about being able to increase and decrease sound and light -- the coolest bit. But it is clear that the adults manage that. Design FOR autistic people would be used BY autistic people.
@Spectrum First, this isn't a video about designing for autistic ppl, or even autistic children.  (Note, although you are describing 21-year-old autistic people as children, they are adult students.)  It is a video about designing segregated spaces in which autistic ppl can be managed.

@Autisticsensat1 I certainly blame specific parents for the glee they take in literally inflicting torture on vulnerable children.		Which seems different to me from "Your hair is a joke."
@Autisticsensat1 I haven't seen that yet.
What is it with allistics and mocking people for irrelevant things they often cannot control?		People do evil things and you mock them for grammar, or their hair?		Why is NT culture so cruel?
@ClearAutism @thalestral How did all that happen before the start of disability rights?		It was disabled people organizing for equality.  But the wheelies weren't in it yet, so it doesn't even count.		Look at the many arguments that ppl with ID are "beyond" disability rights and check out SABE.
@ClearAutism @thalestral I'm going to leave the Deaf movement out for a moment because I do not wish to offend people who do not identify as disabled.  		But ask yourself: is access to Braille ed a disability rights issue? Access to employment? Where do you think voc rehab came from?
@ClearAutism @thalestral Look into when "the disability rights movement" allegedly started and who the founders were, then go look at the organizing that followed the Congress of Milan and everything the early Blind Civil Rights Movement did.
@ClearAutism @thalestral Pick up a book on "the disability rights movement" (not Shapiro's).  Take a look at the ADA Accessibility Guidelines.  Listen to the chants of anti-institutionalization activists doing "cross-disability" work.  Look up "disability culture."  It is all phys-dis-skewed.
@ClearAutism @thalestral Enough of that.  It is time to liberate everyone.
@ClearAutism @thalestral I got into this in the mid-90's.  It was "We need to liberate the physically disabled and then we will get to the cognitively disabled."		Today it is better but it is still largely "We need to liberate the physically disabled and then we will get to the cognitively disabled."
@ClearAutism @thalestral If you look at who runs the "cross disability" orgs with funding, it's mostly white, mostly phys-dis, overwhelmingly socialized through the ILM.  		And that has consequences.		Including what we consider paradigmatic disability and whose needs come first.
@ClearAutism @thalestral There are at least 7 major disability submovements and quite a few smaller ones.		Look who is considered "the disability community."  It is all independent living movement based.		The ILM has a hierarchy. To simplify, it is physical over sensory over cognitive.
@ClearAutism @thalestral Given that decades later, the disability elite can't cope with the existence of other disabled people, I do not think prioritizing some over others in the expectation that we will eventually get to the others works.
@ClearAutism @thalestral I understand the point.		I just dislike disability advocacy in the expectation that no other disabled people will exist.
@thalestral @ClearAutism Sign language can NOT be used by everyone.		Not everyone has the vision to use visual sign.  Not everyone has the tactile perception to use tactile sign.  Not everyone has the motor ability to use sign.		And yes, we should teach it to everyone who can learn.

@GHMansfield I have had offers to help with that.
You can sponsor me or find a different runner at https://t.co/kfG3xPErmE. Half the proceeds go to our chapters and half to national (big donations are split up differently). $5 helps. $500 helps. Whatever you can afford.		Thanks for all the many ways you move this cause forward.
We couldn't have gotten this far without teamwork, and we won't finish the job without teamwork. If you can be a financial backer of the team -- and we all know that not everyone can -- that would mean a lot. If you participate in other ways, thank you for that.
Your support enables people like me to stretch our resources as far as they will go. It means we can advocate locally and nationally, lobby, protest, and work on the full range of issues relating to ensuring nobody gets stuck in an institution.
As an ADAPT member, I put as much of my own time, money, and effort into disability rights as I can.		But this work costs money, and we are a poor community. I get help from my chapter and national with things like hotel rooms (we pack our activists in) and legal fees sometimes.
A large portion of my time between now and July 26, 2019, will be spent working to get the #DisabilityIntegrationAct passed. 		If you would like to support this work by sponsoring me in the ADAPT Fun Run for Disability Rights, the link is at https://t.co/kfG3xPErmE		Thank you.

I am sick of what happens when people not part of a group assume leadership roles, impose their ideas which contradict the group's own organic movement, and justify it by reference to some mystery people with the label who demand privacy so nobody knows who.
But group members must be part of who represents the group'sperspective, and must assume leadership roles.
1. Presence.		2. Perspective		At a minimum, they need to overlap. I can speak only to my own movement but I believe there is room for nondisabled people, or people from different disability groups. And we must have diversity of opinion.
1. Presence. This is in part because people need to see it, so closeted/passing group members are not enough.		2. Perspective. This is where the voice of the most impacted is carried out, so people have to be socialized to some extent in those movements.
Representation has (at least) 2 parts:		1. Presence. The involvement of members of the group. 		2. Perspective. The characteristic viewpoints developed by the group.

@st_vockrodt I have heard of "fighting words" but not "fighting FOIA."
@DagbokDog I bet we look like that at times. The other choice is to crate him when I need to use the phone.		Uncrated indoors, he still needs interaction to keep him from destructive boredom.  He's young. I only have so many hours of undivided attention.
@adaptanita @TransitCenter @DanceforMyself I am all for space for strollers as long as there is space for strollers AND disabled people.  Too often we get pitted against each other.
@DagbokDog I admit I do this sometimes. My dog is far more self-entertaining outside. After 3 hours of intense interaction inside, I sometimes take him out for a break.
@talilalewis Also unless you are deeply involved with the relevant communities and the work on related issues, it is an amazingly arrogant thing to say. 		There are almost no areas where I am connected and involved enough to be sure I have a full picture. And where I do, the field is tiny.
What I want is open captions.  Open captions right out there for everyone to witness, just like ramps at the front door and so on.
In fairness @slooterman, I also think sometimes it is other things. But distress. And often anxiety. And I have spent the morning thinking of things my speaking friends who deal with anxiety say when they are overwhelmed, and what it would mean if they couldn't.
I firmly believe “aggression” is just what we call anxiety when someone who doesn’t speak has anxiety. - @slooterman
So closed captions beats no captions but they still make me sad.
Yes, there are occasions where captionless videos need to be in place to meet specific needs, but we need to push the pendulum pretty far.
If they don't know they don't get used to access being built into the world as a default -- and it will never be easy and automatic that we can do what you can do.
I hate closed captions.		When access is hidden from the main group -- when it is closed rather than open captions, when the CART link for the phone call is sent separately and the accessible formats are not on the same table as the default -- people who don't use them never know.

@MorganCShields @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy And while some people do need intensive supports either short- or long-term, that doesn't mean those supports need to be provided the way inpatient psych care currently is.
@MorganCShields @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy It's why microboards and supported decision-making are so exciting.  		It's why congregate care and even agency-provided care in people's homes if there isn't real choice about what you are signing up for are issues.		You can't mass-produce care.
@MorganCShields @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy The best options we have seen are highly individualized and promote self-determination. It is why people in the independent living movement fought to be able to recruit, hire, train, schedule, supervise, and fire their own personal assistants.
@MorganCShields @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy Mass-produced "care" is rarely high-quality and often an outrage.		But we do it, over and over.		Take a look at how hard it was for Florida to close Carlton Palms. That is an example of what we are up against and why funding the wrong things is devastating.

@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy We deinstitutionalised for a reason. We did it badly. Finish the job we saw the moral imperative to start.
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy Build a system that provides for community integration WITH the services people need. Model it on the best of the HCBS waiver systems and tweak it to meet the individual needs of this population.
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy The thing is, we already know how to support people to live in the community. Even people the average person might think needs an institution. So why take this third system, psych, and build it in such a way as to replicate the failures of the other two systems?
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy It is basically a better deal for everyone except those who profit from institutionalizing people. But that is a powerful lobby. So the institutional bias stays intact.
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy HCBS is vastly preferred to the sort of people who need long-term services and supports. It results in better quality of life and health care outcomes. It means people can stay in their communities and participate in them.
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy HCBS is, on aggregate, less expensive than large congregate settings. (Some individuals need more expensive care to live in the community but this is offset by those whose care costs less without institutional overhead.) So states save money.
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy So some people get it, but in every state there are enormous waiting lists for HCBS. 		Consequently people are forced into unwanted, unnecessary institutionalization. 		This is called "institutional bias."
@ellenfromnowon @slooterman @MentalIllPolicy See, here is the thing.  The DD system and the nursing facility already have this problem. People have an entitlement to institutionalization. Medicaid has to pay for it. But home and conmunity-based services are optional.

@adaptanita @aneeman @slooterman And I an going to have a hard time with the disability leadership that effectively told us today that they didn't matter.
@aneeman @slooterman They were disabled people too. They were us. &amp; no-one who let it happen is unambiguously our community's friend. &amp; they are being pushed to the side on #WorldAIDSDay by leaders who seemingly consider the ADA an okay tradeoff for their deaths -- and the sterilizations and all.
@aneeman @slooterman And many are not grieving 1, or 5, or 10 loved ones, but an almost unimaginable number.		People who died because there wasn't research. People who died because they got abstinence only education and didn't learn about condoms. People who were cursed and shunned.
@aneeman @slooterman I don't actually think they have been.  I think a lot of people lost it when the statements started coming out that implied that the ADA meant his track record on disability was unambiguously good.  It is #WorldAIDSDay and how many people are grieving?
@aneeman @slooterman I am not saying the guy didn't do good things or that we shouldn't celebrate them. Nor do I want to recycle every bad thing he did. But to deny they should matter ....
@aneeman @slooterman The ADA is an amazing thing.		But that is not all Bush meant to disabled people.		And to suggest it is, is to rule the experiences of those whose subcommunities he actively harmed unimportant.
@aneeman @slooterman I agree with you.		But when we have major figures going on about how he was a friend to every person with a disability or a champion of disability rights, I think that warrants a response.		Because he harmed a lot of disabled people. He created a lot of disabled people.

@SeeMiaRoll The whole day I have been contemplating how small "the disability community" seems to be in the minds of some of our leaders.  You gotta be white.  You gotta have a degree of wealth.  You gotta be cis.  You can't have HIV.  Your disability has to be mobility or maybe sensory. &amp;c.
Stop saying "Speak up for those who can't."		#EveryoneCommunicates and if you want to support nonspeakers, you support THEM in being heard.		You don't drown them out.
If you are going to use stats like "1 in 5 people are disabled" or say things like "Everybody might become disabled," don't turn around and say "George H. W. Bush was a champion for all people with disabilities."		Because you have just ruled a whole lot of people out.

@ekverstania @PaulaMc007 I have not been able to watch all of it.  It's horrible.
@ekverstania @PaulaMc007 Paula, I apologize for what I did, and thank you so much for pointing it out, because it gives me a chance to realise my error. 		I wish I had had a chance to know Oliver.
@ekverstania @PaulaMc007 I think Paula knows what I meant.		I also think I moved too quickly past her loss, and I am sorry I did that.  Because yes, what continues to happen to other people matters, TOO, but Oliver's experience and death should not be glossed over.		Good intentions aren't always enough.
@adaptanita It is almost impossible for me to imagine people getting worse treatment at hospitals than I just did, and it fills me with terror for you.
@ShonaDav and just in general suggests that personhood is disconnected from communication.		Technically a seizure is "behavior." The meaning of a seizure is not observer-dependent.
@ShonaDav That said, "all behavior is communication" is pretty dehumanizing in its own right.  It reduces everything disabled people do to its meaning to nondisabled people, decontextualizes communication from the context of interpersonal relationships, ignores communicative intent ...
@ShonaDav But the best possible spin I can put on "All behavior is communication" is as a response to the idea that if it isn't speech it is without meaning and doesn't have to be considered.  Which ... yeah, I see that.
@ShonaDav Anything observable you do is potential communication. And anything observable you do can be used to get information from.
@PaulaMc007 Yes.

This is an important thread and worth reading. It does, however, conflate all disability types and thus gloss over the ablist violence often advocated by certain disability groups against others. https://t.co/dM8dpUCkZN
@ShannonDingle @disability_acts That it is structural and pervasive and we all absorb it -- including people with different disabilities than the one in question -- and therefore must all grapple with it.
@alexhaagaard @sabrina_tess_ I "refused" to take oral potassium supplementation when suffering hypokalemia in the hospital because I CANNOT take oral potassium supplementation.  It is documented.		So they took away my potassium-sparing diuretics as a consequence and just gave me potassium-wasters.
There is no point in reporting this to 311 because they bury the reports. 		You are reportedly unwilling to reopen the contract and see if someone else has a way to do a better job.		Open Taxi has been better recently but this is a joke. And I can't find a city agency that cares.
@ChicagosMayor I set up my accessible cab ride for 3:30 WELL in advance because I needed to arrive at a certain time. Open Taxi sent a vehicle with no ramp using 2 slippery metal shelves instead. No guarantee of strength, no guides so you can tell before you go off the side.
IN GENERAL, I am tired of my life only mattering as it affects people unlike me. I am tired of being reduced to an object of humor, grief, pity, or fear.		I want my personhood to count and I want what my life means to me to matter more than what it means to you.

By age 30, you should have		* enough of a support network that when useless people lecture you about whether or not you have gotten past enough barriers to the life you want, you can tune them out.		If you don't have that, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You deserve better.
@Samanticka The main advantage of educational robots is that it's assembly-line ABA.  The allistics can still hurt us, but they don't have to put effort into it.  I want it to be hard work to hurt a child.  Really hard work.  It would dissuade abusive dilettantes.
@HijaDe2Madre @Imani_Barbarin You have disappointed me.		I was imagining that the unicorn prematurely ate the first one.
@Samanticka And in fairness, that does not actually look like a FACE to me.
@Samanticka But also, there are perfectly social blind people who can't see facial expressions either and have a lot of friends.  So clearly you can manage other ways.
@Samanticka Because right now we are being set up to think doing this is REALLY important and to fail at it, and that's just a nightmare.
@Samanticka We use different cues -- not the same ones for everyone -- or we go without the information. 		Maybe we should be allowed to work out what we can work out and teach each other instead of having people try to teach us processes they don't understand and we can't learn.
@Samanticka ... and more likely distorted as well.		And we largely can't learn it that way even if the whole system is deciphered and taught for the same reason they don't consciously know it: it is too much information to be conscious of all at once.
@Samanticka Honestly, I think this is another area where NT's themselves know stuff without consciously knowing how they know (the grammar of your first language is like that, as well as many social norms) so they are teaching something that is at best so simplified as to be useless...

It's so matter of fact, too. "Yeah, my cousin was abused. The whole family knew. Moving on." (No, that is not what they SAID, it's how it FEELS.)		There is no respect for the fact that other people who have been broken, too, are reading.

@SallyShuttle @ekverstania The most important thing I think they need to hear is this: you don't have to be "normal" to have a good life. You have to be loved, you have to be able to love others, you have to accept yourself and be accepted, you have to be supported.

@slooterman @Tuesdaywithliz And I get that the ADA is a model in some ways, but it largely leaves enforcement to ppl with few resources, so nations that regulate better shouldnt emulate that part.

@slooterman @theoriesofminds @M_Kelter @AgonyAutie @NationalADAPT The idea that if you can subordinate your needs to the wants of those outside your impairment group, you should, is wrong. But yes, it can be hard to be a wheelchair user or swimmer in public when people clearly don't want you to be. I was hit yesterday. It makes me angry.
@slooterman @theoriesofminds @M_Kelter @AgonyAutie @NationalADAPT The fact that I CAN restrict my biological needs in public doesn't mean I should.

@slooterman @theoriesofminds @M_Kelter @AgonyAutie @NationalADAPT It is something I need to do. I have learned not to, to make other people comfortable, so it now has to be consciously initiated.

Access means recognizing that there is no one way to do things.		We don't all do anything one way.		And access is for everybody or it is hollow.
Access is about washing away the treacle and letting people propel themselves easily through life.
Access is about how disability and every other reality of our lives and one another's lives creates a force field that drags on some people more than others, slows them, stops them, makes them swim through treacle rather than clean open water, stops them entirely.
Access is opening up every expectation: how we move around the physical environment, how we get and give information, how we socialize, the ways in which we expect our children to learn and grow -- all of it -- and refashioning the sociophysical environment.
Access is more than wheelchair access. It is more than mobility access. It is more than rethinking how people move around the physical environment.

@aneeman @judithheumann That is a really good story, but it is not about organizing on the inside.
@aneeman @judithheumann And the irony that we accept a movement that systematically ignores disabled people regarded as less human as the pinnacle of cross disability work.		We can do better.

@aneeman @judithheumann ...and dates that start to long after others were doing it.  I am talking about who has a near monopoly on the infrastructure of a disability rights movement that doesn't get to know many of the people working in disability rights.
@aneeman @judithheumann I am talking about a movement that says "Nobody but us does this" when demonstrably other disabled people are doing it, that says "We are cross disability" with an almost total absence of certain kinds of disabled people are doing it, that says "We started it"...
@aneeman @judithheumann I'm not criticizing your research. I am aware of the limitations of historical work.
@aneeman @judithheumann I don't know that it has ever been documented.
@aneeman @judithheumann The tradition from that period is oral, or erased entirely, to the best of my knowledge.
@aneeman @judithheumann If we are not including the history, traditions, perspective and leadership of a group because it is identified with intellectual disability, that does not speak well of our cross-disability nature.
@aneeman @judithheumann And I specifically think the lack of awareness and celebration of the work those people did, many of whom would still dismissed as "beyond our movement" by so called cross disability leaders today, is one of our failures as a cross disability movement.
@aneeman @judithheumann If you are talking about the specifically politically successful movements, yes. It was very impairment-specific.		But it is easy to both overestimate how successful we have been at cross-impairment teamwork and underestimate that movement that grew up in the state schools.

@myceliorum I am experiencing this now.
I find it especially heartbreaking that people calling for an end to the mistreatment of other marginalized people consistently valorize ablist mistreatment, even down to "disability rights" groups calling for certain disability subgroups to be more oppressed.
As with a great deal of discrimination and mistreatment directed at disabled people, this is held up as justified and even right by people who generally oppose the most closely related discrimination and mistreatment against other groups.
The violence people with mental illness absorb because their perpetrators choose to target people with mental illness is not morally different from equivalent violence intentionally directed at other minority groups.
The effort to restrict the rights of people with mental illness over mass violence, which we know FOR SURE is not caused by mental illness, is no different, morally, from the effort to restrict the rights of members of other minority groups.
I agree with this thread.		I also, however, want to say that if we accept the idea that it is wrong to demonize people for morally irrelevant and unchosen traits, such as being Jewish or trans or black, that includes having a mental illness. https://t.co/GgX0V5L7Um

An entire Latinx family is killed in front of a cheering white mob as they travel home from the CIL.
An autistic nonbinary person is killed after being pressured by staff to not be "antisocial" and go out with the killer.
A woman with a chronic illness is killed offsite and nobody notices for 3 weeks because not showing up reliably is taken as not being a real part of the community.
A black man with a learning disability runs from the killer to the police and is shot by them.
A wheelchair-using trans woman who tries never to be alone is killed in a busy bathroom after everyone else leaves when she rolls in.

My parents had massive flaws, but I would have been institutionalized for life if I had grown up as therapized as a lot of kids today.		And so I am grateful to them.
My ability to take care of myself comes in large part from trial and error when I was a kid.		One of the reasons I am not like a lot of people's kids is that my parents didn't raise me to be.
Who was going to teach me?  NT's? They don't know what it takes!  They teach form, not function, and they teach that you are incompetent at the same time. I face different risks which require different skills than my parents and siblings. I draw on different talents.
Let me note that if I had not taken off on my own on a regular basis as a child under the age of 9 (at which point I was on lockdown for awhile and then substantially more anxious) I would not have developed many of the skills I use every day to have an active life and be safe.

@Gordoncairns3 @AnnMemmott @autismage I do all kinds of volunteer work in contexts where everyone else is a volunteer. 		In contexts where people expect to be paid ... well, I'm a person.
And if they are right and you did an ablist thing, isn't it better to learn and try to do better and help dismantle structural injustice?		'Cos that is the goal, right? A more just society, not all of us feeling okay with the roles we play supporting the society we have?
The question is, what are ya gonna do about it?		I would suggest that you at least start by trying to understand what they are saying and how it applies to what you did.		Look, they could be wrong. It happens. But they could be right too. That happens as well.
So when someone says you have done something ablist they are not necessarily saying you are a bad person. They probably aren't. They are probably saying you have unthinkingly absorbed the ablism that pervades society and are reproducing it. AS WE ALL DO.
Even if ablism were not structural, the fact that ablism affects different impairment groups and different intersected groups differently means that it is possible for disabled people to exercise abled privilege over one another.
Ablism is structural. It is a system that pervades everything. We have all absorbed it. Therefore every single one of us is not just capable of acting in an ablist fashion but guaranteed to do so.

Or if you don't know and won't learn, go collect stamps instead of pontificating about what life is like for people trapped in an underworld you help support. Go ride your bike.		Stop supporting the structural violence, or get out of the way of people trying to break it.
It's okay that you don't know. It's good. I am grateful for every one of you who never lived that reality, who has been protected from it.		Not everyone is that privileged.		And I am tired of people sitting in that privileged place insisting they don't have anything to learn.
I don't often wake up in a cold sweat after nightmares of the rspe or the takedowns or any of the stuff a filmmaker would use to show how bad it was.		I wake up, heart pounding in terror, over things that people who don't know think were mundane.
The violence was always there. It was not always visible to those people who confuse structural violence with cuddles, when disabled people were involved.		The day 3 staff raped me was, in the context of that period of my life, a good day.
What happened to me wasn't a couple of bad actors and a few moments to weeks intermittently in a fundamentally benign setting.		What happened to me was a structurally abusive setting that intermittently erupted into visible violence.
I can sit here and talk about being raped and being beaten and being tortured and everybody understands those things. What people who still want to think of institutionalization as care/support do not understand is that the whole thing was abuse. Every second.
In other words, if unwanted institutionalization (with or without congregation/segregation) is not IN ITSELF a form of abuse, it's at least closely related.
The core feature of abuse is an effort to control another person.
The core feature of institutionalization is loss of control. In this I am following definitions from people like Roland Johnson and the self-advocacy movement, not the independent living movement which focuses on congregation/segregation. The ILM is wrong.
@ekverstania @johnrobison @slooterman @myceliorum You also need to recognize that the only way we make this about "children" is to infantilize adults, because this always was addressed at adults as well. That particular rhetorical move is not cool.
@johnrobison @slooterman The default assumption that caregivers are benign is itself a driver of abuse. And nobody said all or most. Not all or most people who seem drunk/high are fleeing a serial killer but when the police have Jeffrey Dahmer's victim back to him that one time they were still wrong.

@Tuesdaywithliz @AUCDNews You represented our community at the Kavanaugh hearing. I wasn't called to testify, but that was okay because in a sense you spoke for me and you did it well.
And I do not know what to do about it.
But it distresses me that people who should know better are promoting this quote as an example of good disability representation. It only even makes sense if you make some appalling, unwarranted assumptions about the people being represented.
It is not my intention to shame anyone. Everyone messes up. Journalists misquote people. Things are taken out of context. Etc.
@Tuesdaywithliz does "speaking for" -- representation -- beautifully. It is what makes her an amazing disability advocate.		The quote in the article I read was an example of horrible "speaking for" -- of misrepresentation.
"Speaking for" is going to happen. Our community got TWO voices at the Kavanaugh hearing. There was no time for all of us to speak.		And "speaking for" is fraught. It is hard, messy and complicated.		But there are people who do it well. Who do it beautifully.
Remember Lucy Gwin's term PLOD -- people living off the disabled?		We have a whole class of at least part-time disabled plods.
"Nothing about us, without us" has been pretzelled until other disabled people advancing themselves by silencing/misrepresenting us gets sold as better FOR US than abled people conveying and boosting our messages and interests. They step on us and expect thanks.
So as I read this article, in which a person with disability A badly misrepresents people with disabilities B and C, I think, "This is where 'nothing about us, without us' has become a perversion of disability rights."
In other words...		I would rather be represented by an abled person who can convey my message than a disabled person who can't.		Ideally you get both in one package but not always. If you have to choose....
And yes, it is important that the bodies often be bodies of disabled people, but it is also important that the minds of disabled people, the worldviews and the aims, be on full display. On balance I would say it is more important.
"Nothing about us, without us" doesn't just mean there is the body of a disabled person at the podium. But it also does not mean every disabled person in a group is at the podium. Representation needs to happen.
All of this is in the context of disability representation, in a context where this spokesperson and her cheerleaders would say it is a "nothing about us, without us" context. But what does that mean?
If someone cannot recognise, respect, understand and convey another person's worldview, they aren't a legitimate spokesperson. The only person who has a right to garble your message when we are talking basic representation is you.
Whether or not you are able to communicate effectively with someone, the idea that they have an actual, respect-worthy, internally consistent worldview is vital. 		An internally incoherent and nonsensical worldview? It should at the very least raise enormous red flags.
... instead of listening to disabled people, she listens to family members and professionals, and neither she nor her informants start with the assumption that the disabled people are people with actual, legitimate, internally consistent worldviews that deserve respect.
I am still really struggling with a recent article in which a (-n alleged) spokesperson described some disabled people's thoughts in ways that are not remotely plausible.		The reality is, I know enough of the backstory to believe ...
@phineasfrogg ...because only by shifting it to the end does any glimmer of personhood show through the linguistic construction.
@phineasfrogg I would say "If they actually thought we were people..."		If autism is one trait without great significance, IFL works. If it's identity with great significance, IFL works.		If autism is both hugely significant and delegitimizing, it has to be shifted to the end...
@phineasfrogg Actually I think it highlights exactly why word order matters. It is precisely because "autism" is seen as dehumanizing or delegitimizing that some (not all) people promote PFL. They have to deemphasize autism because it is the only way to concede personhood at all.
@ArwenFalvey @jeshGio @NyleDiMarco @TheCW But the tools of disability are just that, tools.		The fact that I am autistic is both note visible on my body than the fact that I have mobility impairments, and also more overlooked because the wheelchair is a vastly better recognised symbol than the other stuff.
@ArwenFalvey @jeshGio @NyleDiMarco @TheCW ...problematic.		And of course as long as we are saying "not all disabilities are visible; those people may be disabled" it is worth noting that many "visibly disabled" may not be disabled. We often react to the tools of disability as if they are disability.
@ArwenFalvey @jeshGio @NyleDiMarco @TheCW I think the thing is, nobody was coded as disabled. Which in our society means the default assumption is they are not.		The assumption is problematic.

When you talk about 25-year-old "children" with disabilities, you are reonforcing an old and very harmful stereotype about people whose place in the "natural order" (since we are in an adults-over-children society) is below that of abled people. 		#WeAllGrowUp

@RutiRegan I've pulled voting off, like, once.		For years I was refused registration over illegal "competence" questions.		Then I got registered and FINDING the polls was hard.		I think I have it solved this year.		Thanks for caring. Most people in dis-rights don'y.

@womensmarch @senjudiciary @KishaBari Well, wait, you are BLOCKING elevators so women with mobility impairments can't participate but everyone else just gets a greeting?

Also, some people get that support built into their lives and some don't.		Everyone should get it.
Under no circumstances, however, should one people's freedom be held hostage to another people's employment.
Should institutional staff automatically become DSP's and PA's to formally institutionalized disabled people?		No. Not all are suited to that work.		If they want it and disabled people want them, they should get good working conditions.		But training for other fields works too.
As a rule, I am pro-union. When unions work to protect jobs that involve harming vulnerable people, I draw the line.		I would support institutional closure plans including robust transition planning for both residents to integrated lives and staff to other jobs.

@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats Actually, you know what? Never mind. I am moving on.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats Please explain how it is gaslighting to ask you to either stop telling me mischaracterizing others' beliefs is abusive or stop mischaracterizing mine? If you think it's abusive, stop abusing people. If you think it's not, stop saying it is.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats I disagree that you have been under constant attack. People disagreeing with you giving, opinions &amp; explaining facts is not an attack.		But if I did agree you were under attack, I would note that you have given at least as good as you got.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats p.s. If you believe it is abusive or whatever to misstate others' beliefs, please stop doing it.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats And I am not trying to force you to do anything.  I am just annoyed that when you ordered me to drop it and I did, you did not have the good manners to do the same.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats Disagreeing does not make you less informed than I am.		Not understanding LTSS, Medicaid, the current Medicare4All proposals as they apply to disabled people, incentivization, discrimination, and disability rights does.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats And if you support people using LTSS, why do you insist that people who employ individuals using LTSS should be punished.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats No. Plenty of people who disagree with me are comprehensible to me. You are not.
@AnneLaBarbera @wyrecats We have moved on. You are making increasingly incomprehensible-to-me accusations, and it has gotten boring.		You don't have to believe us about how disability policy works. We don't have to take seriously the ill-informed ramblings of an anti-benefits "socialist." Two-way street.

What you get from simulations is not empathy, not understanding, not real.		If you move to Chicago, get to know Chicago in all its glory. If you join the Disability Nation, welcome to a whole new experience.		Otherwise, accept the limits of what you can learn, and...

Chicago has beauties and ugliness, richness and poverty, music, Rahm Emmanuel, potholes, the Obamas, the Bean and the lake and uncollected dog feces.		If you simulate it by sitting somewhere cold listening to gunshots and think you are acquiring empathy for Chicagoans...
Simulating disability by pretending to lack an ability is like simulating living in Chicago by surting somewhere cold, listening to gunshots. 		Yeah, gunshots and winter happen in Chicago. So do summer and deep dish pizza. So do barbecues in parks and racial segregation.

@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 You are right.  I misjudged you as a person.  I thought you were capable of conversation. Just saying "I don't believe charging people thousands of dollars to do X will discourage them from doing it" over and over does not count.
Hey @Metra the street elevator at Van Buren is down again.  Would have been nice if the train staff had told me.  Would have been nice if the sign explaining what to do hadn't been removed.		Going through garage again.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 At this point this isn't communication.  You are just free associating. I give up.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 That is not what I said.  Would you pay twice as much for the exact same thing?
@Samanticka @AnneLaBarbera @AngelaQueensNY1 No, it's not.  How many Sanders supporters have LTSS in their single-payer plan?
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 It's actually a useless bill anyway.  But there are ways to make it a useless bill that does not explicitly incentivize forcing disabled people out of jobs.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 Unless you are saying, "I will gladly pay $12.65 for a Big Mac when I could just pay retail!" I am not sure why you are defending charging businesses extra to hire certain minorities.  And if you would pay $12.65 I don't know what to say to you.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 Just as you would not but a plane ticket on Airline A if Airline B had the same route and time for half as much, large employers will not hire minorities who cost them more than less marginalized people.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 And whoever wrote the bill added that specifically.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 If they hire my friend H, who has a kid with complex medical needs, and pay her a living wage, they will have to pay more than her whole salary to the feds in additional taxes.  		So they won't hire her if they know, and they will look for a way to fire her if they do hire her.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 And whoever wrote the bill added that specifically.  It wasn't an oversight.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 No, I am not saying that.		I am saying that if this bill passes and Amazon hires my friend B, who would do a good job for them, and pays him a living wage, they will also have to pay thousands of extra dollars a month.		So they will not hire B.  They will hire someone else.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 Sanders did not have to do that to us to achieve his purpose.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 So not only are you living with the burdens of systemic ablism, but now it is literally more expensive for other people to not make it worse.		And every good thing in that bill could have been achieved without explicitly incentivizing added discrimination.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 But they won't for the same reason they won't hire anyone they think needs reasonable accommodation.  It attaches the cost of living in a society that plans for most but not all members (in certain ways) to the individual whose needs are not routinely met.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 That is a tax on hiring people at the bottom.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 And Sanders' people are smart enough to know EXACTLY what they did. They could have exempted LTSS stuff, which basically NOBODY  can afford without benefits and only included stuff that people with a living wage don't need. But they EXPLICITLY included LTSS when they said waiver.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 No. But how are you ever going to prove that Amazon didn't hire you because they know you use a wheelchair or have a kid with Noonan's?		There is a reason our joblessness rate didn't change after the ADA. It's because you can't prove it.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 So yeah. That is a tax for hiring people with disabilities and heads of households with disabled members.  In practice.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 And kids with complex health needs growing up at home? Probably on Medicaid waivers. Kids with disabilities growing up in institutions? Probably on Medicaid. Even if Mom and Dad have good jobs, because insurance isn't great.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 And if you are able to work you can. BUT you can't earn too much or you lose your services and get bounced back to an institution. And almost nobody, even with a good job, can afford that stuff out of pocket. Some people are able to buy in with part of their paychecks.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 This may not have posted. Trying again. Waiver services let ppl who autonatically qualify to live in institutions at taxpayer expense live in the community expense. Better, safer, on average about 1/3 the cost, don't get torn out of your family, etc.
@AnneLaBarbera @Samanticka @AngelaQueensNY1 Medicaid waiver here means home and community based services for people who qualify to live in institutions at taxpayer expense because they are disabled and need long term services and supports but who choose (and have the chance to) live in the community.

@MaryStGeorge @JessHealyWalton It is not remotely possible to simulate any disability. It is possible to simulate loss of ability, which is what you wrongly think disability is, without adaptive skills, which are central to the experience of disability.
@MaryStGeorge @JessHealyWalton What we are telling you is, "Don't do it."
@HTTOrganizers @JessHealyWalton @outofmyplanet No. AT MOST it teaches that it is really hard to be brand new to disability and not know how to do it. It teaches pity and fear and helplessness. And we've been asking you to cut it out for decades. How about simulating empathy by caring about that?

@deruman1 @ALT_uscis See, I AM connected to her. She is from MY COMMUNITY and you are using her as inspiration pornography for your own gratification rather than treating her, and by extension all of us, as human.
@ALT_uscis Yep.  Diluting the tweet was the point, since I usually respect what you post but in this case you are actively contributing to bigotry and harm against disabled people.
@ALT_uscis First, the "overcoming disability" trope is dehumanizing. The idea that our disabilities are what get in our way is false and it allows people to feel virtuous as they oppress us.		Secondly, even if there was sense in the "overcoming" thing, blindness does not limit singing.
@ALT_uscis I'm not sure I am grasping the significance of her blindness here.
I wish we had more visible support from our independent living colleagues on key issues of disability rights like whether OUR PEOPLE have ANY SAY AT ALL in their own lives.
Strategy and tactics are legitimate subjects of disagreement among us, but the above are not. And the focus on nursing homes to the exclusion of the DD and psych institutional systems is divisive and ablist.
I am tired of hearing complaints about being connected to people with ID.  It's not an insult.		That we are all one people is a FACT.		To be mentioned in the same breath as Liz Weintraub is a COMPLIMENT.		These are OUR PEOPLE and their freedom MATTERS.

We criticize Kavanaugh's belief that women with ID do not even get to give an opinion before being forced into abortions, but you do not give women a chance to say no to institutions where rape is the norm.
At a moment when we are justly criticizing Republicans for ICE ripping apart families, you condone institutionalization ripping apart families.
@NancyPelosi and @WhipHoyer I am disappointed that, as @DNC asks for my vote in 2 months, you are unwilling to commit to my most basic civil rights. If I do not have the freedom to decide who touches my body and how, let alone attempt to shape my own destiny, what do I have?

@Metrorailinfo But my disorientation in space means I need to be told where to wait and dropped off somewhere recognizable, not at random locations. I do not consider instructions to figure out my own transport after I have already paid to br transported equal access.
@Metrorailinfo Oh, this was apropos of my ridiculous expectation yesterday that, as the Capitol South elevator was broken, a shuttle would be sent whose driver could locate the pickup and destination sites. At the Accessibility Advisory Commission meeting your rep. said you do that.
Today the Metro guy at Capitol South informed me that Metro does not provide shuttles from station to station because we can just take the bus. When I told him buses are not accessible to me he abruptly turned his back. Yeah, @wmata, I can see how seriously you take the ADA.
People who want to work should have good jobs at a living wage.		When the jobs workers already have hurt people - as is the case with a number of jobs in the disability field - they should end.		The institution worker's right to work is secondary to the inmate's right to freedom.

And @wmata still refuses to answer my question how will I recognize the shuttle?

If they can't be trusted to say, "Hey, is it okay if I ...?" before performing procedures on someone they know damn well can communicate with them easily using AAC, why would we trust them to learn to communicate with someone who is a little harder to understand?

And -- yay!   BCBA-approved solution to the problem of BCBA's.
So be sure to institute a dumpster diving training program before you fire them.
They are child abusers as a way to convey "I like to eat every day."
At any rate, you don't want to extinguish the behavior before choosing another way for them to obtain their objective.  Because all behavior is communication!!
This, of course, means they will lose precious socialization time with their child-abusing peers, but it can't be helped.  Maybe someone can take them bowling instead.
Damn ethics guidelines!
Unfortunately, this misguided policy means they have to lose their jobs.  If they just kept coming to work and not getting their tokens on payday, the bosses could get into trouble.
But current employment law creates a problem.  It is actually illegal to do this -- take away the tokens they trade for preferred objects -- unless you fire them first.
Eventually the behavior will extinguish itself.
Now, there will be initial behavior problems as they get upset about losing access to preferred items like groceries.  But hold strong!  It's inportant to teach them socially relevant behavior, like non-abusive interpersonal interaction.
Take away the tokens.
So if you have a socially imappropriate behavior that is maintained by regular reinforcement like that, you put it on extinction.
Look, they're doing it for tokens.  Money.  Which, when they get enough, they can trade in for preferred items.
BCBA's themselves think they should lose their jobs.
Well, yeah.
Sometimes, when you #SayNoToABA, people ask you, "Do you really think BCBA's should lose their jobs?"

@stucam7771 This country has done this before -- the eugenics movement was also about reinforcing "natural" hierarchies and ensuring purity of the nation.  And that was progressives.		There is a strong streak of "We must make a moral society" here and this is the current content.
@stucam7771 Obama, by this reasoning, was not the sort of man who should ever have come to power; social welfare programs promote the advancement of the undeserving over the deserving, etc. It's absolutely tied up with racism, sexism, ablism, etc. ... but they do not see that.

WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOU ARE HURTING PEOPLE, CUT IT OUT!		And until neurotypical people can figure that one out, let's quit wailing about how WE have deficits.		#TheRealTragedyOfAutism
This is not a comprehensive list.  But "1. You're hurting people. 2. You're hurting people. 3. You're hurting people. 4. You're hurting people. 5. You're hurting people" ought to be enough.
... here is a simple rule that you can probably learn:  when you find out you are hurting people, CUT IT OUT.		#IxnayOnTheBickba #ProtestAgainstABA
A fifth thing is, an overwhelming number of survivors (yes: survivors) say it is traumatic as hell.  Look, we know you have deficits in empathy or you wouldn't have given the world developmental centers, but ...
A fourth thing is, it is  ridiculous amount of work. Preschoolers should not have 40-hour-a-week jobs.  If you really want to increase the amount of child labor in the world, how about starting with the kids that remind you of yourselves?  Don't come after ours.
Y'all already abuse and murder us at ungodly rates.  We would prefer that you not increase that.  Actually, we would appreciate it if you would take steps to address the neurotypical violence problem.  Hurting people doesn't fall under the category of "be you."
A third thing is, it is compliance-based.  Compliance training decreases the chance that people will be able to comfortably direct their own lives and increases the chance that they will be abused.
Y'all may not value communication or emotional expressiveness and that's fine.  Be you.  Don't mess it up for those of us who do.
For another, the "skills" they want to teach are ones neurotypicals like but they are frequently harmful to us.  Eye contact, for example, decreases our ability to engage in two-way conversation.  Quiet hands decreases our ability to express our emotions.
In other words, alienating us from ourselves, altering our relationships with ourselves.  Our relationships with ourselves are our own business.
We don't act like neurotypicals in the first place because our brains are different from theirs and they cause us to act differently.  Changing our behavior without appreciably changing our brains means causing us to act in conflict with our brains.
For one thing, it is traditionally used to make people act less autistic and more neurotypical.  The presumption is, the closer to neurotypical, the better.  We reject that.  Autism is behaviorally *diagnosed* but it's neurologically *caused*.
Let's talk A.B.A., neurotypicals.		A.B.A. is a behavioral technology that is used by neurotypicals, among other things, to teach skills to autistic people, especially kids.		Autistic adults have some concerns.		#IxnayOnTheBickba #ProtestAgainstABA
How come it is a bad thing if Avital Ronell pressures a student to have a warmer tone with her but a good thing if a BCBA does compliance training to force an autistic person to say "I love you"?		#IxnayOnTheBickba	#ProtestAgainstABA

Now ... watch them blame Mr. Williams, who clearly doesn't have the support of his supervisors to do hos job well, instead of taking responsibility. 		I am tired of my health care, safety, and other needs being jeopardized because I don't have access to reliable transportation.
In short, it sure looks like Metra administrators are figuring they can get away with violating the ADA, the settlement agreement, and the implicit agreement that they will try to get ticketed passengers to their destinations, at least on the Metra Electric line.
(Note also that the door to the elevator at Van Buren was blocked with traffic cones AGAIN.)
... because collecting tickets from other passengers is more important. 		They routinely forget to deploy the bridge plate so I can't get off.  And when I do get trapped, nobody knows what the rules of the settlement are.
Look, I've got nothing against Mr. Williams here.  But I travel between 51st or 57th on one end and Van Buren or Millennium on the other, and 3 of those stations have routine elevator outages.  		The train staff are encouraged to not provide us with the information we need ...
... so the train could leave. He indicated that the other passengers came 		I reboarded the train and came to Millennium.  Mr. Williams announced to others that "a wheelchair" had caused a delay.
I called Metra, did not get a response. I asked Trainman G. Williams which elevator was out. He said it isn't their job to find out. He said he would go with me to find out if the track elevator (no workaround) was working, then tried to trick me into going by myself ...
@Metra is doing its usual excellent job. I got on with my wheelchair at 51st Street to go to Van Buten. Once on I discovered that the website says "the" Van Buren elevator is not working. There are 2 -- there is a workaround for 1.

@SFdirewolf Those who are forced into institutions in other ways than by the use of state-authorized violence also experience a loss of control. So they have some idea.		Guardianship or the blanket determination that you will never be competent? These are traps that often have no exits.
@SFdirewolf For those who have been under guardianship or have only narrowly averted it, those who have been in court-mandated treatment or have struggled with the tactics of "consent" in systems where nonconsenters are coerced, this is deeply personal on a level many cannot grasp.
@SFdirewolf I think it may hit even closer to home for those who have struggled with pervasive issues of substituted judgment.		The stripping of the most basic rights is practically automatic at 18 for some people. Kavanaugh's decision suggests it should be literally automatic.
That's pretty mild, actually, I think.
Yes, there should be room for redemption. I am not the Redemption Fairy. And I shouldn't have to be. It's okay to say, "You nearly killed me once. I don't want to take you out to lunch and support you in your desire to be a better person. Best of luck, but go away."
I am so tired of other people hurting me being considered a moral obligation for me to let them hurt me more.		And this comes from friends, or at least people I used to think were my friends.
Moreover, this is framed as a favor everybody is doing for Y, to help make the world better for Y.		So now X has caused harm to Y, Y is supposed to help X, and when X is then still a jerk, Y is not supposed to get upset because what does Y expect? Perfection?
The other thing about redemption is, other people can opt out.		I am running into way too many situations where X has caused real harm to Y, and everyhody's solution seems to be for Y to help X be better.		If that is what Y wants, fine, but it's nobody else's right to choose.
@michaelianblack Fame and fortune is not the *default status*. Plenty of people who have never done significant harm to anyone do not get comedy careers and are not wealthy.		The fact that a person previously had power does not mean they have a moral claim on it again.

Pick up the phone and call your two Senators and your Representative in the House - the number is (202) 224-3121 - and ask, "Are you a cosponsor of the Disability Integration Act?"		If they are, thank 'em.		If not, tell 'em that as a constituent, you hope they'll take care of it.
... what you eat and wear, etc.  Because sometimes you want to go out with your friends or decide for yourself wgat to watch on TV, because you want to grow old with your spouse and surrounded by grandkids.		But so it.
Or do it for yourself. Do it because you hope you will live a long life and you don't want to risk being forced into a place where you lose all control (and however hard the staff try to make it a good life, you still want to decide when you get up, bathe, dress, ...
If you have a grandparent or older parent, do it in honor of them, because they should have a chance to choose where they live as they age, and right now, unless they are very wealthy, they probably won't.
If you care about freedom, do it in memory of Roland Johnson, who grew up in Pennhurst and worked tirelessly to give people with disabilities the chance to be in charge of their own lives.
... because you believe people should have a right to decide who touches their bodies, and tou lose that if you are in an institutional setting and you need personal care.
If you care about sexual violence, do it in honor of James Meadours, a survivor working against the sexual assault of people with disabilities ...
I don't know why you wouldn't. 		If you care about kids getting ripped from their families, do it in memory of Katie Beckett, who became disabled in infancy and was hospitalized for 3 years before her mom could bring her home and raise her, JUST because of institutional bias.
You can learn about the #DisabilityIntegrationAct, the widespread, bipartisan support for it, the reason it is fiscally responsible as well as an investment in civil and Constitutional Rights, etc., at https://t.co/FMplTsSA9Z 		And then you can act.
... families stressed to the breaking point and people eventually being forced into higher-cost, lower-quality care than you can provide in the community, ripped from their loved ones and faith communities, losing jobs, ... losing everything.
If this was the law now, all of the families in @ksophiewill 's article could have paid assistance providing supports for disabled family members, which would make life easier. And the families wouldn't burn out, and we wouldn't have what we do today, which is ...
In other words, you can't be forced into a place where you don't have any control over your life, even a choice about who touches your body, just because you are disabled and need assistance that other people don't need.
So right now there is a bill before Congress called the #DisabilityIntegrationAct.		It's a bipartisan bill that basically everyone supports. And what it says is, if you have funding to be segregated in an institution, you have a right to funding for community integration.
And -- and this is important in the #MeToo era -- because the best protection against abuse and neglect is to have regular contact with people who care about you and will notice if something is wrong, real community integration means less violence than institutionalization.
People maintain their friendships. Those who can work are able to do so when they live in the community. People can volunteer. They can practice their chosen religion if they have one. They can have rich, active lives integrated with their neighbors.
HCBS is vastly preferred to institutionalization in state developmental disability institutions, intermediate care facilities (ICF's), nursing facilities and the like.		It's also cheaper by far. People are healthier with HCBS. They are not torn from their families.
Some of those people are in institutions now and some are with their families, who are struggling to support them and ensure that they have good lives. That latter group could, at any time, choose to enter institutions ... but again, nobody wants that.
...are probably in the developmental disability system. There are, last time I looked, 19,354 Illinoisans with developmental disabilities who need LTSS waiting for Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS).		https://t.co/9p9ELD3vW7
What you don't have a right to is to live in your own home or a community-based program. Some people do, but states can and do limit the number of spots available. A number of the families in the article are in Illinois, for instance, and the family members with disabilities...
Right now, if you have a disability that means you need long-term services and supports (LTSS) and you are on Medicaid, as many people are, you can definitely get funding for an institutional placement.		But nobody wants to live in an institution. Nobody.

@JustStimming I know.  And it NEEEEEDS to be addressed better than it is (not suggesting anyone in particular isn't doing enough, just overall).
@JustStimming I also think the institutional advocates deliberately coopt others' language. And by "think" I mean "know for a cold, hard, immutable fact."
@JustStimming I know!!  I just kept wanting to say that and then wondering if I was missing some important context.
@JustStimming I have wondered about that. That is how I always heard it. But now I hear it in disability and adoption debates. I thought maybe I didn't understand the history.

@vavroom What, diversity is not like BINGO?
If what you mean is something else, say that.  For instance, "I don't like it when you do that."
If that is what you mean, don't bother.
And while that message may be obscured to you, we can recognise it just fine.
For instance, when a neurotypical "friend" tells a neurodivergent "friend" that their behavior is inappropriate, this can be an effective way of saying, "Neurodivergent ways of being are unacceptable;  be more neurotypical."
When one of a pair of putative equals from a less marginalized group uses it on someone from a more marginalized group, it can be an expression of the supremacy of the less marginalized group.
When one of a pair of putative equals brings it out on another, it is an assertion of the right to tell others how to behave.
When it comes from someone who has a legitimate role in helping socialize someone else - a parent to a small child, for instance, or a mentor to an eager mentee, or a friend to a friend who has asked for guidance in navigating a complex social situation - it can be a kind thing.
"You are being inappropriate" is a tacit appeal to a standard of behavior to which we should all subscribe.
Thank you. https://t.co/4NwYXyzKqS

Since issues of autonomy and the body are shot through disability rights, it surprises me to hear you suggest that there are people discussing sexual freedom who have not thought this through, @rsocialskills
This is a disability rights issue.
When people are taught to submit quietly to authorities who manipulate their bodies, as the medical and educational systems do to disabled people, they aed vulnerable to sexual manipulation and assault. Having the ability to say no taken from you makes sexual  freedom impossible.
This is a disability rights issue.
When other people have control over you, as in guardianship, institutionalization and many other systems disabled people are subject to, they make sexual decisions for you, uncludung whether you may have sex, may have gay sex, may have sex ed, or must be sterilized.
This is a disability rights issue.
Being sent to congregate settings means who you spend time with, your access to privacy, etc., are under the control of others. People are separated from loved ones. If you can't get together with the people you want to have sex with, you don't have sexual freedom.
This is a disability rights issue.
Eugenics is an effort to root out "undesirables" by controlling who's born. New tech has unleashed a eugenic assault on the Down Syndrome community. The autism establishment is diligently working toward one on the autistic community. Eugenics is incompatible with sexual freedom.

@RutiRegan @slooterman @autismage Note: I am speaking for no-one but myself.  My experience may be wholly idiosyncratic.  There are ... significant atypicalities ... in my life experience.
@RutiRegan @slooterman @autismage I did not purposely construct a mask.  One was grafted onto me and tightly secured.  And yes, it does interfere with my ability to represent myself honestly in the world, which is important to me.
@mattpfeff @RutiRegan @emilycrockett And yes, abled people seem to feel surprisingly warm and fuzzy as they watch child abuse, murder, torture, etc., in the name of "humanizing" their alleged inferiors.
@mattpfeff @RutiRegan @emilycrockett Not remotely.		It is a response to atrocities committed daily against disabled people regarded and treated by abled people as subhuman.		I was not expecting a sudden influx of new readers unfamiliar with my body of work.
@emilycrockett You have made your point.  You have heard mine.  Move on.
@emilycrockett I do not think you understand to whom you are talking, or whose words you are echoing, or what evils those words have been used to justify.		But I ask you now to go elsewhere if you want to use the language of those who justify torture, because I am a survivor of that torture.
@emilycrockett It's not about empathy. 		And suggesting they are fundamentally different from everyone else directs attention away from the danger.
@mattpfeff @RutiRegan @emilycrockett This is not about empathy. The original tweet was not about the administration. 		Since we are talking about the political situation now, suggesting that evil acts are the result of inhumanity means misunderstanding the situation and therefore preventing an effective response.
@emilycrockett Consider, for instance, the reasoning behind Judith Newman's widely celebrated plan to forcibly sterilise her then-13-year-old son, when he reached adulthood, by means of a court order stripping him of self-determination rights.
@emilycrockett You are saying certain people lack humanity because they lack empathy.		Though you may not intend it, you are echoing exactly a line of argument used to justify the denial of basic rights and protections to at least two distinct groups of disabled people.
@emilycrockett That members of this administration make unconscionable choices does not warrant attacking them by means of drawing on and reinforcing the history of treating certain marginalized people as subhuman.		We can address the political situation without punching down.
@emilycrockett There is a long tradition of assuming that people who express empathy differently lack it entirely.		A long history of treating those people, and anyone with the same labels that get slapped on them, as subhuman.		A history of harm.		That's what I'm saying.
@emilycrockett They don't lack humanity, and to suggest that they are fundamentally different from us is to underestimate the danger they pose.
Assume humanity in others.		Even when you cannot perceive it directly.		Even when you have been assured it is not there.		Everybody thinks, feels and makes connections.		Assume humanity in others.  		Express that assumption as you deal with them.
@MorenikeGO @slooterman @AmazonAutism The world, for all the beautiful people in it, is a brutal and terrifying place.
@MorenikeGO @slooterman @AmazonAutism Yes.  There are dangers in all of it.  I came very close to being shot by cops once, and I still am not sure how I moved wrong.  And I understand the immense privilege as a white person and an autistic with a mobility aid that likely saved my life, and I grieve.
@MorenikeGO @slooterman @AmazonAutism I used to not be able to.		I also used to get the !#&amp;@ beat out of me, and restrained mechanically and chemically, and starved and dejydrated, and secluded, and worse, for it.
@slooterman @MorenikeGO @AmazonAutism I cannot force myself to stim most places even when I desperately need to.  I cannot force myself to touch people when I want to, need to, know it is appropriate.  I cannot force myself to do a number of survival-level things.

@MentalNOS @thinkingautism And in fairness, I come from the home of "If you knew them you'd want to murder them too" as an awareness message.
@MentalNOS @thinkingautism ... which is how Awareness tends to go.  You should get to be there because you are the moral and political equal of the others, not because it's nice to let defectives hang out.
@MentalNOS @thinkingautism Okay, so I don't know where you are.  I don't know what laws apply.  From your phrasing, not the same laws that I work with.		But I would rather see "If x, then the student has a right to y" than "Well, thus student is a Z and Z's are defective in the following ways..."

It's a rhetorical move we see all the time: talking about a minority of disabled people like that is all there is.
@DagbokDog @RutiRegan @AndrewPulrang So let's assume for the sake of argument that there were 3: Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy.		In a context where so-called invisible disability is already treated as suspect and where cognitively disabled people are frequently erased from "our" community, ...
@DagbokDog @RutiRegan @AndrewPulrang FDR was not the only disabled President. Besides Wilson, Kennedy surely counts. Again, there may be others we know about for sure, and almost certainly there are some we don't know about.
@DagbokDog @RutiRegan @AndrewPulrang FDR was not the first disabled President. We have always known this. Wilson came before FDR. I'm no Presidential scholar; we may know for sure someone else was before Wilson, but at the least he probably wasn't the first. But we know FDR wasn't the first.

I am dying to see the destination I bought a ticket to, but apparently since I use a wheelchair Greyhound thinks honoring the ticket is optional.  #AffordToExplore https://t.co/r7yFQColLz
3 hours after denial of service for wheelchair use, and @GreyhoundBus has sent a bus without an operational lift, complained and just now decided to pay for a cab to take me the rest of the way.  They now want me to sign a paper saying that this is good enough.  No.
So @GreyhoundBus I am wondering what your solution is, other than to keep telling me violating federal law is an "inconvenience," not your problem, and no big deal?
The disability help line say they have canceled my ticket and I can rebook another day.  Chicago customer service says maybe I can get transported later if a bus with a lift becomes available.  The ADA compliance office is "not available."
@GreyhoundBus I'm sitting here in the Chicago Greyhound station, where I have been denied transport to the final destination on my ticket because I use a wheelchair.
