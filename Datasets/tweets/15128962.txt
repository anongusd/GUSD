That was the rant of the day, thanks.
I can't freaking believe it I have to EXPLAIN this.
If you think the Oscars have been "shattered" by what just happened, you don't know what the problem is.
WHY? Because TV networks and streaming services COMPETE.
In the realm of TV/streaming, diversity is THE NORM.
The Academy and how it works is the very example of what happens when monopolies sit pretty, undisturbed by COMPETITION.
Hollywood is only still standing to this day because of privileges granted by the govnt (due to the crony relationship btw H &amp; Washington).

@_LuckyBastard vc √© racista, diferente. @greatbarda
@_LuckyBastard quem manda nesses pa√≠ses? governos absolutos, tiranos. ngm tem liberdad, obvio. como em Cuba!
@_LuckyBastard nao tem nao. hahahahaha
@greatbarda e olha q ele ja compartilhou artigo dizendo q o q o MidEast precisa √© capitalismo. as coisas mudam! @_LuckyBastard
@_LuckyBastard a viagem √© tua. deve ser mta maconha estragada. viver no brasil da nessas.
@_LuckyBastard √© so largar mao q a cultura muda. o prob do middle east √© falta de capitalismo, nao √© a religiao. vc costumava saber disso.
@_LuckyBastard seja no MidEast ou na America latina.
@_LuckyBastard existe uma grande diferen√ßa nesses pa√≠ses por conta dos seus governos. a "cultura" nao importa quando o gov √© absoluto
@_LuckyBastard ah, e Dubai. Vamos falar dos pa√≠ses ricos como a Saudi Arabia, que sao tocadas por dinastias RADICAIS. @greatbarda
@_LuckyBastard mas movimento LGBT na palestina EXISTE. @greatbarda
@_LuckyBastard se vc ta preocupado em sobreviver numa guerra contante, vc nao liga mto pra parada gay. @greatbarda
that's why folks can't have anything nice!
"libertarians" who think that a community is poor because of their culture... can't even look at the roots of the group's problems.
@_LuckyBastard n tem parada gay na palestina pq eles nao conseguem nem achar emprego, imagina se preocupar com parada gay. @greatbarda

Watching a show about a criminal attorney who actually fights to get innocent people out of jail makes me miss my dad more.

@FergHodgson + yet all of those groups deny such representation. It isn't a government. :)
@FergHodgson and, the IS is not a nation. They claim to represent a group that shares the same ethnic/religious background, +

@FergHodgson Alright. :) I still prefer the US government, the one I pay taxes to, to get out of the way.

@FergHodgson KEEPING people from engaging as they see fit is immoral.
@FergHodgson "we"? no entangling alliances, Fergus. No entangling alliances. No micromanagement of people's lives.
@FergHodgson it's what has been going on for the past decades. hehehehehehe
@FergHodgson + severed means more surveillance for Americans, more tax$$ for policing, more restrictions.
@FergHodgson they don't, but the first step obama took was... well, a step in the right direction. Keeping diplomatic ties +
@FergHodgson + And for what? to feed the Cuban lobby from Florida while the US continues to act like big daddy of all?
@FergHodgson so? What is the solution then? Allow the US micromanagement of the relationship btwn Americans and Cubans to continue? +
@FergHodgson that's misguided at best.
