@BeckyQuick Hey I think we still do that in West Texas and New Mexico...
@BiondoLia @MoneyBadgerFC @CBKimbrell @katynell @BeefCheckoff Absolutely. In order to understand, or have a better understanding of something, we have to step outside our comfort zone. Best thing a person can do is to book a trip to DC with an organization and then walk the halls. See how the game is played and why compromise is vital.
@CBKimbrell @katynell @BeefCheckoff BTW Thank you for your devotion to agriculture. The passion and drive that you and others in the industry have are the reason people like me take pride in telling the story and reporting about the industry.
@CBKimbrell @katynell @BeefCheckoff As an outsider, I can see both sides of the issue. My job allows me access to more than most "steak-holders" see. It all begins with one relationship. If you can build rapport with one person on the other side,  it will open the door to discovery (for both sides). DM for contact.
@CBKimbrell @katynell @BeefCheckoff Just appears there is a divide and maybe the conversation needs to move to a smaller venue (ie in person). Not sure how to help facilitate it, but would be happy to introduce you to someone who could answer tough questions, not just provide talking points.
