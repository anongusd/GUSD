Phew and I am done. These are the Q‚Äôs at top of my head I strongly recommend being asked at Wednesday‚Äôs hearing.
25/End 	Q30: Did Trump org lobby U.S allies or U.S adversaries to stay at their hotel in exchange for foreign policy favors?
24/ Q29: Has Trump org ever tried to bribe officials in NY to ignore their tax violations? Has Trump org used National Enquirer to collect blackmail on law enforcement to avoid trouble?
23/Q27: To the best of your knowledge are you aware of Trump partaking in crimes like Robert Kraft owner of the Patriots; soliciting sex at undercover brothels? 	Q28: Does Trump know about the prior criminal of the people (like Manafort, Gates) before hiring them?
22/Q26: Are NDAs used by Trump org also meant to prevent employees from speaking about illegalities like falsifying undocumented workers papers? Have undocumented workers at Trump properties also signed NDAs?
21/ Q25: Recalling every piece of information related to individual investigation of DT and speaking in a general sense would you say that Donald Trump is not working on behalf of the American people?
20/Q23: Currently, Trump has plunged America into a trade war with China and put tariffs on U.S allies. Would you say this is similar to the shakedown negotiating tactics used when running Trump org?	Q24: Did the Trump family signal they would use presidency to enrich itself?
19/Q22: In a biography by a former Trump associate, Trump talks about hating black workers counting his money and calls Blacks ‚Äúlazy‚Äù. Before 2018 midterms you said he used the ‚Äú****holes‚Äù about places run by African Americans. Just verifying , you consider DT racist?
18/Q20: Based on the man you used to work for would you say his non-response to Saudi Arabian government dismembering a journalist is an internalization of the business relationship?	Q21: Prior to his presidency did Trump say he would still stay in touch with his business?
17/Q19: @AnibalRomeroLaw the lawyer for Undocumented workers of Trump golf properties called the Trump organization a ‚Äúcriminal enterprise‚Äù. Do you agree that assessment?
16/Q18: Early last year the Trump tower in Panama was closed down due to controversy over organized crime using the hotel to launder money. Are the Trump towers in NY or D.C being used to do the same? Also did the Trump org and DT know about this?
15/Q17: Has Trump regularly paid hush money to women he has had relations with?
14/Q16: Has anyone in Trump‚Äôs circle reached out and made threats to you or your family?
13/Q15: After the search warrant conducted by FBI last year on your office+hotel Trump called it ‚ÄúAn attack on our country.‚Äù Was his response because they were beneficial in Campaign finance probe, NY tax crimes, Russia probe or all three?
12/Q14: Two wks ago House Oversight cmte notified WH that Trump lawyers Sheri Dillon and Stefan Passantino provided false statements. Besides yourself, has Trump used atty-client privilege to conceal fraud or have his lawyers lie on his behalf?
11/Q13: The day the FBI carried out a search warrant on your office and hotel Trump called you. In that call did he promise you a pardon?
11/Q12: The day the FBI carried out a search warrant on your office and hotel Trump called you. In that call did he promise you a pardon?
10/Q12: On January 23rd @DonnyDeutsch on @DeadlineWH said that he called you after Trump made his inflammatory threats about your father-in-law. Recount the events of that day please?
9/ Q11: Along with the recently closed Trump foundation are there any other charities that had its money funneled to personally enrich the Trump family?
8/ Q10: An @nytimes article back in October (https://t.co/jeTJ0Y8Czv) gave an overwhelmingly detailed account of Donald Trump‚Äôs violation of NY tax laws via tax dodging. Is DT still doing this and has his children(Don jr, Eric and Ivanka) engaged in the same misconduct?
7/ Q9: Based on the man you know, do you think he would hesitate to use the Natl Enquirer to dig up dirt on Dems or Repubs in congress? Did he ever hint he wanted to do so prior or during presidency?
6/ Q8: In an article from the @thedailybeast (https://t.co/eeEjPcvhey) It said that Kushner took over your job of serving as a liaison to the National Enquirer. Can you confirm this?
5/ Q6: Donald Trump during his presidency has made threats against Democrats. Do you have documents showing he did the same using individuals (other than yourself) to do this?	Q7: Trump has been called a mob boss for calling you ‚Äúa rat‚Äù. Based on Trump org practices do you agree?
4/ Q5: Around the beginning of his presidency Trump demanded loyalty from former FBI Comey. Is the demand of loyalty from Trump your former boss‚Äôs way of doing things no matter how unethical or illegal? Is it the norm in Trump org?
3/ Q3: Trump has repeatedly said he has no business or investments in Russia. When Congress subpoenas his tax returns will it show otherwise? 	Q4: Has Trump‚Äôs business relationship w/Saudi govt factored into inaction against MBS for WaPo journalist murder?
3/ Q3: Despite Trump‚Äôs racist and inflammatory language against immigrants he hires undocumented workers. Have you seen first-hand account of him denigrating then? Also based on your decade long relationship would you call Donald Trump a racist?
2/ Q2: According to articles from the  Washingtonpost Trump golf properties hired undocumented immigrants and helped them falsify their documents. How many people in Trump family involved in the business were aware of the practice of falsifying documents?
1/	Q1: Trump‚Äôs media ally the Natl Enquirer and it‚Äôs chairmen David Pecker aided Trump in hush money payment of 2016 and tried to extort Jeff Bezos 2/7. Has Trump used Natl Enquirer services to blackmail pre presidency and would he use them post-presidency?

It would be irresponsible of Mueller‚Äôs team if they only dropped bits of the conspiracy/collusion and didn‚Äôt adequately elaborate on it. It would probably distract direction of the memo if it was listed in the doc. https://t.co/Ng0SeC0Zsd
Just so we‚Äôre clear everyone: Mueller‚Äôs team needed to clarify why Manafort is a danger to society in the sentencing memo. Adding tidbits about conspiracy/collusion would take up the bulk of the memo. The goal was illustrating depth of Manafort criminality. https://t.co/3x6Bvhrl6D

Besides the ‚Äúpolling data‚Äù bit mentioned by @KenDilanianNBC  	There‚Äôs also Mueller‚Äôs team rebuttal to Stone saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not involved‚Äù with the GRU officers indicted last summer. In Mueller filing it was said that the emails were ‚Äútimed‚Äù. https://t.co/CnjYrSolwQ

@mayawiley @sarahkendzior @amjoyshow On another note: the polling data bit reinforces the conspiracy charge towards the Trump team.

@reb_henderson @PoliticusSarah @RepSwalwell @NRA @GabbyGiffords @SpeakerPelosi @reb_henderson Yeah. They took money from Russia and are closely under the microscope of investigations of congress.
@sam_vinograd @realDonaldTrump Roger Stone vouched for Manafort. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he knew about his connections to Russia and the way Stone got Trump to pick him was because of his connections to Russian oligarchs.
What Manafort did in Ukraine is no different than what he did with Trump. He sought to install a Putin stooge both here and there. https://t.co/JQebS8RU10
In response to what was stated by legal commentators on @kendisgibson just because Russia wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the filing doesn‚Äôt mean that there wasn‚Äôt any collusion/conspiracy.	There‚Äôs Kilimnik and polling data incident. https://t.co/Fyj3BxahZy

@ryanjreilly She is really, really, really, REALLY pissed.
OMFG...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ https://t.co/Wi3ewlYCGj
@SpicyFiles @ZoeTillman @BritainEakin It‚Äôs like going to an officer to go **** himself and when you‚Äôre arrested saying the reason you did it is because you don‚Äôt like police.
Lol okay so I know what I was sick with on Sunday. I had a cold and now my mom has it.üòÖ
Here‚Äôs my thoughts on Roger Stone‚Äôs apology: üñï	Get bent cuck. https://t.co/buQ7yWzw12
@KatiePhang She‚Äôs kicking his ass.
@BritainEakin I‚Äôm not buying this apology.
@SpicyFiles @ZoeTillman @BritainEakin ...Really? So just because he‚Äôs worried about being raped in jail he decided to attack the judge?
@BradMossEsq That‚Äôs an insult to the court and an insult to all Americans that know EXACTLY what that symbol is.
‚ÄúHow hard is it to find an image that doesn‚Äôt have crosshairs?‚Äù https://t.co/GMnTX62rw3
Another opportunity that he‚Äôll likely squander. https://t.co/htcvoA9ROS
@BradMossEsq üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇHe said the other day it was an assistant that posted that pic. ü§£

@atrupar Silver lining: this is a good way to make your kids behave in the future and not make controversial posts on the internet.
@ryanjreilly Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison!
@jmk_bnr @KenDilanianNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @mitchellreports @jmk_bnr @KenDilanianNBC isn‚Äôt a lawyer but @JoyceWhiteVance is. Investigators are going to look at everything Trump has done and take it into account.
@AndrewFeinberg @BetoORourke @AndrewFeinberg I bet you got three cavities.
@ZerlinaMaxwell MAGAts don‚Äôt understand black people!
@AynRandPaulRyan @FoxNews Sup snowflakes!  Didn‚Äôt want this aired cuz ya didn‚Äôt want viewers to see your golden boy taken to task?ü§£
@AnushayHossain Finally watched and just wow...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Along with the impending Russian asset charges from Mueller there already enough reason to begin impeachment hearings for individual-1. https://t.co/bT4Em5ozGb
If only @seanhannity cared this much about what he was saying about Seth Rich as much as the footage of the racist Convington brat. https://t.co/d951M7cWa0

@AuthorKimberley @LibsInAmerica Stone going to prison would the biggest treat of the day.
The Republicans crying of voter fraud is a parody in itself considering how Mark Harris participated in it. The only reason they claim voting fraud is a bigger deal than hacking is so they can cheat voting laws. https://t.co/Al8rrv6HH9
@NightlyPolitics @joncoopertweets Good. Let the fear consume you.
@TimHannan I forgive repentant former MAGA like @davidmweissman but those that continue to make lies for this horrendous, vile, racist, stochastic terrorist radicalizing, xenophobic,anti-Semitic white supremacist scumbag needs to get bent. He‚Äôs a danger to the country.
RT @ZoeTillman: There are now legal challenges to Trump's national emergency declaration pending in three circuits ‚Äì DC, the 9th, and the 5‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump /Mangolini would never attack a white supremacist. That‚Äôs what makes up majority of his base. üòÇ https://t.co/pCiqhcMhk7
‚ÄúYour honor I didn‚Äôt read the law about murder being wrong and only found out when I read the Bible.‚Äù https://t.co/vZBL1VFsFv
@JoyceWhiteVance If @realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt inspire #MagaBomber and responsible for torrent of attacks on the press his condemnation would be okay. The reality is that Trump is part of the problem.
@CevallosLaw @JussieSmollett @EmpireFOX The hate monger in Chief is incapable of self control.
There‚Äôs a word for this...It starts with a T. Hmm...Trying to remember...Oh yeah I remember now! It‚Äôs called Treason! https://t.co/b525k1ktK3
@rebeccaballhaus Awwwww Senate intel gets first crack?! Boo!
@politicususa Cool he‚Äôs committing perjury now too.
@kazweida And here comes the fake outrage from Earth 2/Fox News.
@MiekeEoyang Trump should be impeached if Mueller report shows he‚Äôs a Russian agent.
@Vernam @emilyjanefox Eh that works when they‚Äôre in the country.
RT @mcspocky: #MakeMeCringeIn4Words Agolf Twitler leads America https://t.co/ZSXt8lYHN7
@1IronMan2020 Seriously,he stole this election. It needs to be nullified and either @McCreadyForNC declared winner or a whole new election called.
@kazweida Me either. In the same week that Smollet is indicted for filing a false police report a loony Coast guard officer is arrested for plotting to commit a domestic terrorist attack.
