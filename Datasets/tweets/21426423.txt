@JayCaruso Yes, I was actually the first in media to write about brokered convention questions. Way before anyone else.

If I were @realDonaldTrump or @tedcruz I'd walk off stage now. This isn't a debate. This is an establishment hack job
.@seanspicer knows now there can be no audience at future debates after @reince stacked this place against Republicans
True disgrace tonight. If the RNC succeeds in stealing election from @tedcruz and @realDonaldTrump I won't be shocked when Hillary wins
This is worse than the first debate....  This is truly disgusting. Abhorrent to truth and democracy.
The fix is in! I wouldn't be surprised if a third party comes soon after what the RNC has done to REPUBLICANS tonight.
.@marcorubio is continuing to lie, and now he's admitting that he says one thing in SPANISH and another in English.
.@Reince and @seanspicer have some splaining to do after these phony audience members unrepresentative of SC.
This audience "cheering" these @chuckschumer drafted lies from @marcorubio is proof RNC trying to fix the game to screw conservatives
The boos of @TedCruz PROVE IT. This audience is full of LOBBYISTS AND AMNESTY SHILLS. Totally not representative of SC voters.
.@TedCuz is killing it right now. What an answer against @marcorubio and his "massive amnesty plan"
This is GANG OF EIGHT AMNESTY TALKING POINTS FROM @marcorubio and applause from the $$$$ lobbyists in "audience" that RNC put there
This is #Gangof8 ALL OVER AGAIN. @marcorubio reverting to his @chuckschumer written talking points.
.@marcorubio LIES OUTRIGHT. Says he "never" supported amnesty. Yes, he did. And he still does. Marco's plan IS amnesty.

So, @marcorubio now thinks he's supposed to respond to criticisms of his immigration pal @BarackObama ? Why is Rubio talking right now?

1 Gang of Eight member already out of the presidential race (Lindsey Graham). Now @MarcoRubio struggling BADLY.
.@MarcoRubio is serious trouble right now. His work as Chuck Schumer's amnesty pitchman is coming back to bite him. Wow!
.@TedCruz CRUSHES @MarcoRubio: "RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM WAS NOT INVENTED 24 MONTHS AGO."
.@MarcoRubio had his chance on security reforms to his Schumer-Rubio Gang of Eight bill. He chose not to secure America then.
RT @sahilkapur: That immigration question for Rubio could’ve been written by @mboyle1.
.@MarcoRubio is not answering the question. Where is the follow-up? This was about THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF MASS MIGRATION.
And now Bartiromo asking @marcorubio the exact right question on his plans to replace Americans with foreigners in workforce. Rubio dodges
.@MarcoRubio really doesn't make any sense on any of this. Now @ChrisChristie and @TedCruz are field stripping him.
.@MarcoRubio going down the rabbit hole of weird now.
This is really bad night for @marcorubio. Now he's caught on taxes. Taxes! GOP supposed to be all great on this. Rubio in trouble on this
And now @TedCruz is eviscerating yet another of @MarcoRubio's lies. #VATtax
Yes. He did. It disturbs me that Marco even knows what that is. Maybe that is what he does all day instead of voting https://t.co/ZbQNodSfhU
Now that @marcorubio has wandered into the Obamatrade den, he's in big big trouble. He's gone from lackluster to bad performance.
.@tedcruz becoming the uniter of GOP here. "Both Donald and Jeb have good points"
.@RealDonaldTrump crushes @MarcoRubio: "WE'RE LETTING THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. WE CAN'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT."

Rubio continues struggles on immigration #SCHUMERAMNESTYPITCHMAN #GANGOFEIGHT
WOWZA!!!! Bartiromo question on MUSLIM MIGRATION best question of entire 2016 GOP election cycle. Hands down.
Carson, not a winner or loser, but he's struggled a little bit. Could save himself with a big question down the road here.
Winners tonight so far: Cruz and Trump. Also a winner: Christie. Losers: Rubio. Jeb. Kasich.

Christie's answer here is pretty darned good. He continues to shine in debates.
Cavuto asking Rubio about Christie's comments about Rubio aiming to "slime his way to the White House."
.@NikkiHaley is here...
Ok it's pretty clear there are two serious candidates for president in GOP: Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Send everyone else to undercard.
Marco looks awkward jumping in here
This exchange will go down in history as one of the most amazing in presidential debates ever.
Fireworks in Charleston.
.@TedCruz nails that answer. Wow. AMAZING.
Whoa from Cruz. Wow.
Audible boos in debate hall as Cavuto asks about natural born citizen issue with Cruz.

PREDICTION: Fox Business is going to find itself in big trouble over waiting 18 minutes to ask frontrunner Trump a question.
18 minutes in and Fox Business finally goes to the runaway frontrunner Trump.
Reporters in spin room talking now about how ridiculous it is that Fox Business has ignored Trump so far.
.@RealBenCarson jokes re Fox Business moderators ignoring top candidates to go to lower ones like Marco, Bush, Christie, Kasich
.@MarcoRubio takes @RandPaul line. Rand has been saying "disqualifies" re Hillary for over a year. Rubio just now saying it.
OK, Fox Business has gone to several other candidates but has ignored the frontrunner so far. How can they do that?
"Job creators" -- most people aren't "job creators," they are "American workers." Talking to billionaires doesn't win elections.
Christie hits "storytime with Barack Obama" -- good line.
Kasich's use of term "JOB CREATORS" (just like presidential election losers @mittromney &amp; @SpeakerRyan) is bad.

@vtg2 @scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso bc Paul Ryan lied when he said TPP didn't contain immigration provisions.
@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso the text of the TPP clearly has immigration provisions in it. Clearly. Which means Paul Ryan lied.
@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso how much did George Soros pay the Cato Institute for you?
@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso all of that is there in the text Scotty. But we all know Soros-backed CATO is open borders.

@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso it's going to increase the number of L1 and tourist visas. Aka increase immigration.
@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso again the living agreement means anything can change w/o Congress after approval.
@scottlincicome @JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso living agreement. while no commitments NOW, can change w/o Congress AFTER fast track ratification
@snlester @scottlincicome and the living agreement means that can change real quickly after ratification WITHOUT going back thru Congress.
@JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso @scottlincicome and of course w living agreement anything can change easily after ratification.
@JGodiasMurphy @JayCaruso @scottlincicome but immigration/guest worker provisions are in the text even w/o commitments. Aka: It's in there.

@AllieinMO that was someone impersonating me. I still can't believe @twitter @Support has not verified me! 3rd time now

@JGreenDC and it's because of all that that @BuzzFeedAndrew is afraid to debate me on this. Bc he knows I'm right.
@JGreenDC so while Rubio may have voted party line on other things driving up some of his score card ratings where it counts he's been lefty
@JGreenDC meanwhile Rubio has been 1 of biggest champions of Obama 2nd term agenda: Amnesty, trade have been O's 2 signature goals
@JGreenDC Trump represents that swing. His stances are basically conservatism's future. Cruz is catching up to him on that stuff
@JGreenDC there's lots of interesting things happening in the conservative movement. A swing towards populism and nationalism is one of them
@JGreenDC Trump isn't a movement conservative. But he is a conservative. A populist/nationalist conservative.
@JGreenDC but conservatives aren't currently taking it aggressively seriously. For good reason though because Rubio is flailing
@JGreenDC to conservatives like Trump and Cruz, Rubio is the only serious threat from establishment.
@JGreenDC yes. But Rubio COULD emerge as a credible candidate in establishment lane if others get out/Establishment coalesces
@alex @JGreenDC I'm kinda in the same boat as you here. It's New year's eve
@JGreenDC he has been hasn't he? That's what I've noticed. He just hasn't been too aggressive or focused with it.
@JGreenDC Trump hasn't been focused in Rubio criticism. Why Rubio is still standing. Everyone else Trump has zoned in on has fallen apart

@KimGOP60 @youzoob Are you not a regional chair for the Rubio campaign? That's what your profile says.
@KimGOP60 @youzoob Your profile says you're a regional chair for Rubio campaign. Are you not?
@KimGOP60 @youzoob Amnesty is what Rubio did. Are you really going to argue this for the Rubio campaign right now? Please keep talking.
@youzoob @KimGOP60 She works for the Rubio campaign. This is very instructional not for her, but for everyone else.
@KimGOP60 @youzoob Marco could have walked away whenever he wanted. He stood with it in collusion with the now indicted Bob Menendez.
@KimGOP60 @youzoob AMNESTY=LEGAL STATUS FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS. end of discussion. Thank you very much.

@KimGOP60 @youzoob And that's not to mention all the goodies and giveaways contained throughout. Believe me, I was there in the middle of it
@KimGOP60 @youzoob In addition, it would have increased K-1 Visas (Tashfeen Malik immigration) to America and more.
@KimGOP60 @youzoob Kim the bill would not have secured the border. It was amnesty instantly, citizenship down the road. No consequences.
@KimGOP60 @youzoob No. It didn't. Marco even admitted it to me later that it was a screw up.
