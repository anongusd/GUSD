@JanBrogger I think through pride in Estonia's digital system, though 56% of voters still vote with paper. In many countries though, absentee balloting competes heavily with showing up on election day, especially in the U.S., where election day is a workday.
@schaerdaniel @jaakkokorhonen This, slightly more technical journal article by @LiisaPast of NATO's @ccdcoe goes into greater detail. https://t.co/dQ9KaSTqlo
@OssoKuka @schaerdaniel fine, but e-voting ends before paper voting so if there are irregularities, paper is the default for all. Here is a paper on the topic https://t.co/dQ9KaSTqlo

@goooligan @andreaskaju T√µsi. Tublid.
@aisling_bn @DmitryDibenko @MollyMcKew Here is a rather good overview for the layperson: https://t.co/dQ9KaSTqlo
@FHenriques perhaps but people screaming paper ballots when Russia penetrated U.S. voting or that paper is just one step in a digital chain doesn't give me confidence about their knowledge. No one has evidenced knowledge of the security systems in place, they merely shoot from the hip.
@jaakkokorhonen it's statistical, inductive evidence. I'm a Humean, I don't know the Sun will rise in the East, but evidence suggests it will. I also remain civil.
@FHenriques I think this intro covered the ignorance part:"I am perplexed why so many people living in places with no digital voting, let alone digital anything else, feel compelled to trash Estonians' choice of voting and with no clue that almost everything in Estonia can be done digitally"
@FHenriques My problem are people who know nothing about the system in Estonia. Basic ignorance, intellectual laziness and based on that knee-jerk ignorant reactions. I have been called all kinds of things, especially by nationalists, but never a nationalist. A first.
@jaakkokorhonen Alas, the system is the same that underlies all interactions in the Estonian system from 99% of bank transactions to digital prescriptions. Daily. With nearly a billion authenticated digital signatures and no manipulations, stolen money, etc why then would elections be different?
@MichaelGarrood yes
@jaakkokorhonen I must be the dumbest ex-president my country has ever had, slapping his head realizing how stupid he's been all these years. Jesus.
@jaakkokorhonen I guess you don't read much since books have been written on the 2007 massive DDOS attack on Estonia, which were *not* averted. Clearly you are trolling me.
@FHenriques nationalism? intellectual snobbery perhaps, but nationalism, hardly.
Putins Informationskrieg trifft auch Deutschland https://t.co/T1wgAqWM1l via @nzz
@MichaelGarrood Generally the people who question Estonia's voting system know nothing about it, and indeed nothing about 2fa, e2e encryption, gated distributed data layers or the confirmation receipt every i-voter gets. Nor do they grasp that all paper ballot votes end up on a computer anyway.
@jaakkokorhonen Last time I bother to answer questions that you can research yourself. His electorate did not vote digitally. Paper voting can just as easily be manipulated, and deleted no differently from e-voting since all votes end up in a computer. Good night.
@jaakkokorhonen The process is so tediously monitored that instead of immediately providing e-results at 20:00, it takes 34 minutes so every step can be explained to observers. Why don't you do your own research? I'm not your research assistant. Nor anyone else's, just a simple Stanford fellow.
@jaakkokorhonen "appeared to be"... 12 years ago.
@trulysarahwest Q.E.D.
@jaakkokorhonen no. In fact he was the most anti-e-voting candidate and leader of his (then) anti-e-voting party and his party then (2014) had by far the lowest percentage of e-voters -- 9%. Another theory down the drain.

@jowr_what With enough security features the probability of hacking falls to the same level as "voting early and often" in the paper world. 2fa, e2e, distributed data exchange done right and used in all daily transactions, not just voting every 4 years, gives a high level of confidence.
@DigitalscotNews Thank you.
@bradmac_nz Bud? Bud??? No different from paper in that regard, but without knowing how it is done in Estonia, it's just shooting from the hip. Bye,... "bud"
@neiby No doubt, but that has to do with the US' insecure electronic voting machines in polling places, nothing like what Estonia does. Yet knowing nothing about how it is done in Estonia and without bothering to check, they pass judgment.
Yes you are. That coalition came in in 2007. Up to April 2007 Reform was together with Center. https://t.co/fd4TNvgekW
@MichaelGarrood I said nothing about forbidding, just amazed. Free speech is fine, uninformed speech is tedious. But hardly forbidden.
It's a curse. As soon as I wonder why people from elsewhere with no knowledge of Estonia feel a need to give lectures on why digital is bad, I start getting more lectures from elsewhere by people who know nothing about my country on why Estonia's digital choice is bad. üòï
Oh please... read up https://t.co/y4GCowQlsN
@zoyashef @BrusselPlaybook There are a number of possibilities, none of which make forming a coalition without Euroskeptics difficult. BTW Reform and Center were last together in a coalition in 2007, not 2003 as you mistakenly report.
What??? Has @BrusselPlaybook even bothered to look at the results? Try harder please. ‚ÄúBoth Reform and the Center party have ruled out governing with EKRE, but the Euroskeptic party‚Äôs strong showing is going to make forming a coalition without it difficult.‚Äù@zoyashef

@devonrevenge @wolfniya @rejectionking and as I keep having to stay to the deadtree lovers, paper balloting is but one step in a long chain, the rest of which is digital, from US voter lists (breached in up to 39 states in 2016) to tabulation of paper results. Not to mention hanging chads.

@devonrevenge @wolfniya @rejectionking What voting machines?
@dvdjaco @ptaipale What's flawed? You simply aver voting "is not the same" as a bank transfer. That's metaphysics, not an argument about security of the system. If it is hacked, the default is paper for all.  i-voting ends 4 days before the paper vote precisely to detect potential irregularities.
@ptaipale @dvdjaco Russians? We call things by their proper names. Yes, Finland has adopted Estonia's X-road distributed data exchange platform because is secure and open source. You put many of the same services online, but not voting. Fine.
@dvdjaco Why? Voting results among parties track with paper voting results. If they track and 1/3 of people wish to vote online, why are you so insistent?  Are we stupid people in your opinion? Is Estonia primitive? You make claims that are not true and clearly have not read how it's done
@ptaipale @dvdjaco A Finn living in Silicon Valley will not bother to fly to LA to vote -- I was told this directly by one who was envious of our system. But why are you all so upset about what we do. If Estonians approve, what's it to you?
@dvdjaco Paper of not, does "any voter" understand the distribution of votes in multiple mandate districts where a complex formula is used for distribution of seats in parliament? Those calculations are done digitally, btw.
@dvdjaco How? Or is this "Hands of the People" romanticism?
@ptaipale @dvdjaco but if you increase voter participation? With 7% of eligible voters abroad? What is more important, a "sacrament" or participation?
@_k4m1_ @wolfniya @rejectionking You cannot download the software over unsecured internet connections. You need to logon with 2fa and connections are e2e encrypted. The trojan didn't work.
@HunterCawood @StirnaGun @ACEurasia True but not educated people but, as Russians for some reason call them "gastarbeiters" from Central Asia.
@dvdjaco I keep saying, read up on this. *there are no voting machines* this has nothing to do with voting machines. Do you simply say these things without reading up on what is done in Estonia?
@dvdjaco Oh, that elite again, as opposed to the People. We have more than enough hackers, pirate party experts and techno-anarchists in Estonia not to allow the "elite" to pull one over the People.
@dvdjaco The identity verification and authentication via 2fa  is undoubtedly more accurate than showing up with a driver's license. The observation of i-voting is just as open to observation.
@dvdjaco Paper, as I said before is simply 1 step in the process. From voting lists to final tabulation, including d'Hondt vote allocation for multiple mandate elections, *all* votes are ultimately digital. The bit about "in the Hands of the People" in caps is meaningless populism.
RT @dvdjaco: @IlvesToomas For me there's a more fundamental concern: with paper voting the core of the election is in the hands of The Peop‚Ä¶
@dvdjaco Fine, but if voting, a once every 2 year event uses the identical platform ID system as all other transactions, why think voting is different?
See answer below. Voting is no different from the 800 million bank transfers made since 2001. As a Humean, I realize there is no reason to assume the sun will rise in the East tomorrow morning, but we can be pretty sure it will. https://t.co/eYCFoZGkNe
@dvdjaco Actually, i claim that since 98% of bank transactions are over the same system, and nothing has been stolen, then we use a system tried and true for all transactions with the government. Aside from the double envelope, it is the same as a bank transfer.
@dvdjaco No voting machines are used. Really do some reading first.
@dvdjaco the software is open source. Please don't make generalized statements about "often" when you quite evidently do not know.
@wolfniya @joepie91 E2e insures transport. From there on no different from paper integrity, as tabulation today is digital, regardless of type of vote. If you have dealt with cyber your adult life go to https://t.co/zJl6qmRwQo for more technical specs. I btw have been coding since age 15. I am 65

@NoPuppet_007 @benjaminwittes @lawfareblog @qjurecic Of course it might be an apt nod to the original, Jonathan Swift line.
@James7Holland Hey, I just read the British press, but I would never use the names used there about Europeans or "Europe". Or tell East Europeans of all people, that the EU is just like the USSR or Nazi Germany.
@formerleft Yes, European nations' elected officials are going to forget how their own citizens working in the UK have been treated and would never respond in kind. "Taking back control" elsewhere may turn out to be just as xenophobic, a great recipe for FANTASTIC relationships.
@JamesRon1980 @GatisSmagars @EvelynKaldoja @MunSecConf @vanessaacker Many people in the US speak Spanish. So offer an interview to the Washington Post with a German official in Spanish.

@DeiviAccounts Well as Uncle Karl famously said, "Philosophers have interpreted the world. The point is to change it". In the real, Hobbesian world of foreign policy, there is little time to ponder the post-modern dimension, as so many IR students later find out.
@MiroWare Give it a break, anonymous trollbot. Estonia *is* NATO.
@DeiviAccounts See on, nagu √ºtlesin, Teie valik: arvamuse t√µsiseltv√µetavus vs. h√ºpoteetiline diskrimineerimine t√∂√∂turul oma arvamuste p√§rast. Elu on raske. Aga p√§ris inimeseks olemine ei v√§lista trolliks olemist. Pigem vastutuse puudumist.
@DeiviAccounts Forget the post-modernist "semantic dimension to foreign policy because it constitutes as meaning". That sentence itself is meaningless. Go work for the foreign ministry for a while instead. It's a Hobbesian world out there and Estonia has to deal with it.
@DeiviAccounts No siis j√§√§b Teie arvamus anon√º√ºmseks ehk ebaoluliseks. Seisukoha v√µtmisel on alati oma hind. Alati, m√µnel on see privaatsus, m√µnel elu. Liberaalne demokraatia, ma kardan, ei ela anon√º√ºmsust √ºle.
@DeiviAccounts Justified in your opinion. I don't take anonymous accounts fully seriously. Hence dismissive. If you don't stand behind your real name your opinions are frivolous. Write in the Estonian press instead of attacking me. I am the enemy for the people you oppose, you attack me instead
RT @michaeldweiss: Not knowing what you‚Äôre talking about is a baseline standard fo today‚Äôs politicians. https://t.co/3v6B4MuryZ
@DeiviAccounts You did not, however, answer my question. Why  *hasn't" the RF apologised but rather justifies killings, deportations etc, while the FRG has? Not a small issue if you wonder about Estonians' so-called "Great Other" narrative. Perhaps you instead do something rather than whinge.
@DeiviAccounts Yeah, that right that holds me a villain for championing gay rights, for being the one who pushed for municipal voting rights for permanent residents. But as for use of language, that's pretty rich coming from an anonymous account.
@DeiviAccounts I don't believe in a "need" to do anything. Simple observation of verified and verifiable behaviour. I state facts. You ascribe to me a grandiose opinion. Why has the RF refused to apologise while Germany has? Please answer instead of imputing to me opinions I do not hold.

@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Little continuity? Defending Molotov-Ribbentrop? Denying Katyn? Killing people abroad? Germany has apologised for the actions of an earlier totalitarian regime, Russian denies or justifies the actions of an earlier regime. Now you are justifying the state, not defending a people.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Leave the post-modernist discourse bit. And are you surprised given 20th (or 18th or 16th Century) history that Estonians don't see Sweden or Finland as "the Great Other". Who did all that killing?
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Yes, but they will hang or shoot me first. You, not so much.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike And perhaps you can tweet under you own name instead of issuing demands and comments behind the safe facade of anonymity. I take people seriously on twitter when they don't hide their identity. For all I know you are just a troll claiming to be Estonian.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike oh please.
I am not an oilshale expert.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Long-term, yes. But short-term, no.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Glad you got that one. You couldn't say "the Arabs" because there is no such country or a unified nation. You make a category error, comparing state actors with peoples.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike That's strictly your interpretation. You see what you wish but don't impute russophobia to me simply because I have done foreign policy most of my life. Who is the main actor Estonian foreign policy needs to deal with? Brazil? If you don't like what I tweet, simply unfollow.

@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike 2. And moreover, the point was that you do not have bilateral meetings without staff along with you.
@DeiviAccounts @erikkannike Oh please. It should be obvious I was talking about meetings with representatives of the Russian Federation, not people who are Russian.
