Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgement for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that house or town.
And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your [my] words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town.
And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it not worthy, let your peace return to you.
And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. As you enter the house, greet it.
As a adventure in this life, Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse leper’s, cast out demons. You received without paying: give without pay.
The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
A poor man who oppressed the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food.
@jordanbpeterson Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand it completely. Amen. Stay Strong lead your followers to the Lord and his Teaching the Holy Bible
Better is a poor man who walks in intergrity than a rich man who is crooked on his ways. #toxicmultiparty
The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding, but a companion of gluttons shames his father. #Proverbs
Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profits gathers it for him who is generous to the poor.  #RT #Sharing #is #to #CARE
Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance. #Current1PercentBeWarn
Seek UNDERSTANDING. COMPLETE COMPREHENSION is KEY. THE KEY OBJECTIVE #TheKeyToSuccess
A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has understanding will find him out.

Where are the GAINTS? How much longer will they hide themselves. #GAINTSrise May all know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Personal Saviour.

Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into Calamity. #DeepVerse
Like a roaring Lion 🦁 or a charging bear 🐻 is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
Cruel Oppressors #YourTimeIsUp #GovernmentShutdown
A ruler who lacks understanding is cruel oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days. (“ I am not the final Judge, God will be, but I assume in Hell. +ghost 01/21/2019)

Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty. #PlantSeedsInOrderToHarvest
A faithful man `or woman, +ghost 01/21/2019.’ will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.
Asavakkit.
To show partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong. (Understanding this verse is such a big important crucial part in life. +ghost 01/21/2019.)
A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him. #UponTheWorld #allmustknow
Whoever rebukes a man (or woman, +ghost, 01/21/2019.) will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his tongue.
Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “That is no transgressions,” is a companion to a man who destroys.
A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the Lord will be enriched. #RiseGaints
Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.
Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse. #2019
When the wicked rise, people hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase.
