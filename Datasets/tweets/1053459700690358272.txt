Hey @realDonaldTrump, don't you have like 3 billion dollars you don't need? You pay that for the wall and I'm sure @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer would be happy to float you the other 2 billion. Plus if you were responsible with your money you'd have like 15 billion.

@2020Junkie @RealClearNews Yeah I was going on the philosophy of name recognition and experience for prez and fresh, young faces for VP. Also Beto is an establishment Democrat, while Bernie is progressive, and Biden is establishment while Castro is progressive, thus appealing to both sides of the party.
@2020Junkie @RealClearNews I think I'd like to see Kamala and Beto both get more experience first but I could see either being VP to Biden. I'd like to see a Kasich/Flake or vice versa GOP ticket, a Biden/Castro or Bernie/Beto Den ticket, and a Rand Paul/Gary Johnson or vice versa Libertarian ticket.
