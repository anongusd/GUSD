And he was unanimously supported by the Ag Committee members. Full Senate vote up next, although no date announced yet.
Finally, it takes a village. This shows all the ways land is used and the importance to continue the conversation from an ag/timber/other land use perspective with the consumers. Consumers may never set foot on the farm, it is our job in ag to tell our stories to them.
3) Forest lands are the 2nd largest land use in the US. A significant chunk is federal/state timberland which are experiencing too many wildfires all things consider. Fires cannot continue like this year. Lives and homes depend on a healthy forest which means proper management.
2) Another good reminder why exports are so important to ag. Total cropland puts exports as 21% of what is grown. And it even specifies that 5% of all cropland are wheat exports. Soybeans are garnering attention these days, but wheat will and is suffering in a trade war too.
This data showcases why farmers are so important, stewards of our land. It also tells me that Urban areas which continue to grow need to "take it to the farm." While there may be many opinions about agriculture production, if people never experience the land they are uninformed.
Norman Borlaug's, the father of the Green Revolution, last instruction to the agriculture community was "take it to the farmer" so that agriculture technology could help feed the world, but only if the farmer had access to it.
I'm obsessing over these maps. Apologies in advance as I tweet my thoughts. 1) Agriculture use (cropland, pasture/range) are &gt;1/2 all land use. Forest are 2nd, producing timber for our needs. Urban areas are a small piece, yet where the most people live &amp; the fastest growing. https://t.co/PKrw0NtQQP

@SdB_dip @wto Thank you for the background. I may just need to take a tour next time I'm there to learn more about the history of the building and donations.
@SdB_dip @wto I did not. Great to know! Thanks for sharing and if there's a story that goes along with the donation I'd love to hear it.
