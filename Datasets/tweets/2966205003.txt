@hokdog91 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Which is why you haven’t seen me beating this horse for the last two years. However, hard to ignore some of this.
Interesting that Peter Strzok bragged about having an FBI “insurance policy” in case @POTUS got elected and now it appears McCabe &amp; Rosenstein were plotting to take down @realDonaldTrump. Hmmm... I’m guessing James Comey would describe this as another case of “gross negligence.”

We can be the Congress that finally solves the decades long border problem, but it will take real action. Specifically, congressional action.
After decades of failed promises and months of debate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the House less than 20 hours to read and vote on a 1,200 page bill that builds just 55 miles of barrier to secure a 2,000-mile border. This flippant approach will do little to stop the border crisis.

@flyfrompti @GeorgeHWBush God’s grace is abundant for all of us no matter our flaws and mistakes and we applaud the comeback story. Yet, the real heroes should be the ones who finish the race strong with integrity intact – not always the ones we often celebrate for a short-lived moment.   #Remembering41

They decided to hold off on having their formal wedding until Jacqueline’s father could return home. They waited patiently for another 20 months, advocating for the release of her father and staying strong in faith and prayer.
Kevin, serving in the U.S. military, could not postpone the wedding. Kevin and Jacqueline were married in civil court in February 2017, while Jacqueline’s father was held in a cell with 21 other inmates that was built to hold only 8 prisoners.
Then Jacqueline’s father was unjustly imprisoned by a foreign government on ginned up charges for sharing his Christian faith.
Meet Kevin and Jacqueline Furnari. 2 years ago, Kevin sent a picture of an engagement ring to Jacqueline’s father and received his blessing.

Unnecessary and harmful taxes on materials our manufacturers need for production, but can’t find in the US, has plagued the growth of our builders and job-creators. Sending this to @POTUS desk means we can level the playing field. Thanks @RepKevinBrady for your leadership on this

@LowesFoods Work is so critical in life, bringing happiness and prosperity. I remember my first job very well – the same as Brad – starting as a bag boy at Piggly Wiggly. Every job has value, giving people dignity and hope for the future.
@LowesFoods Here's why places like this are so important: Yesterday, I met the general manager of the store Brad. Brad started bagging groceries at Lowes when he was 15 and now he runs the entire store. Along the way he also married into the Petty family, becoming The King's grandson-in-law.
Grocery stores like @LowesFoods in Oak Ridge serve as epicenters of our community, creating jobs and helping provide our families with nutrition. Thanks to President Tim Lowe for telling me about their stores and how they have been serving the Carolinas since 1954. #NC06 https://t.co/Gp415pB858

Manufacturing makes up more than 1/5 of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of our people. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill on the House floor today represents a savings of $71 million in 2018 for NC, the most in the nation. #NC06 #MTB https://t.co/MxvX9mAnTG
When #earmarks were allowed and encouraged, bills passed on shady favors and chumminess rather than on their merits. This practice helped produce what we now call the swamp. We need to keep earmarks dead. Read my op-ed in @WSJ: https://t.co/kT6xtad3qj
