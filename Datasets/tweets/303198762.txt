@RwEvans1 @MollyJongFast @DarlaShine While apologists for the pharmaceutical industry continue to influence our mothers and fathers to permanently damage their innocent children with ineffective cocktails of chemicals which claim to produce benefits that have never been proven and by all accounts, do not exist.
@RwEvans1 @MollyJongFast @DarlaShine Considering the raise in autism rates which just coincidentally happen to be in direct correlation with increase in the number of vaccines given to our children, I would say unvaccinated are much, much less likely to be "Darwin Award" winners.
@RwEvans1 @MollyJongFast @DarlaShine Not to mention the presence of common ingredients like: fetal bovine growth hormone, dead monkey liver and kidney tissues, aborted human fetus tissues, and formaldehyde just to name a few. Only so many characters can fit in a tweet.
@RwEvans1 @MollyJongFast @DarlaShine Every vaccine relies on an aluminum adjuvant to "stimulate" the immune system in order to combat whatever virus or disease is being artificially injected into the veins of the baby/infant/child/adult. Aluminum builds up over time and is extremely detrimental to long-term health.
@RwEvans1 @MollyJongFast @DarlaShine Which, even if true, is far too many. What's more frightening is the long-term slow-kill vaccines initiate. Injecting toxic metals directly into the veins of human beings, who are incapable of processing those heavy metals. Compromising function of major organs, causing diseases.

@Maryvest2007 @raven72076 @KarinaJarmy @SambeMoustafa @realDonaldTrump Logical Assumption C: Anyone who can not see the logic behind A and B are either paid antagonists, benefiting directly, or so completely brainwashed that they are hopeless to be returned to logical lines of thinking and reasoning.
@Maryvest2007 @raven72076 @KarinaJarmy @SambeMoustafa @realDonaldTrump Logical Assumption B: If you do find yourself in the situation where you are absolutely forced to provide monetary funding to a terrorist state whom you DO NOT agree. You would not do so in the form of untraceable cash, which can then be used to fund attacks on your own homeland.
@Maryvest2007 @raven72076 @KarinaJarmy @SambeMoustafa @realDonaldTrump Logical assumption A: it is never ok to provide monetary funding and assistance to the World's largest State-sponsor of terrorism. (Unless you agree with their ideal and choose to assist in their promotion.)
@raven72076 @Maryvest2007 @KarinaJarmy @SambeMoustafa @realDonaldTrump If you want facts,  you'll be hard-pressed to find them in the AP/MSM.

Forget the fact that we gave the World's leading sponsor of terrorism billions of dollars, 1.5 billion of which, for some odd reason had to be given in cold, hard cash... we "owed" it to them... duh "idiot"
@Maryvest2007 @KarinaJarmy @SambeMoustafa @realDonaldTrump Yea, 150 billion dollars in cash, that was "theirs" but couldn't be "returned" in dollars because of the illegality, so had to be "returned" in foreign currencies and a series of wire transfers that were one dollar below maximum legally allowed.
