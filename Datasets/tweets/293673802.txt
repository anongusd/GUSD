@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin So what?  That would mean Blagojevich didn’t get a fair trial for which he is still in prison for.	Second it would mean that Robert Mueller comprised a sitting President and is currently targeting a second.	It matters.	Which is why it was swept under the rug.
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin Balanoff was a Prosecution witness
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin From evidence of:	A) the internal investigation report 		B) that Obama gave it to agents BEFORE he was interviewed 		C) the testimony of Balanoff from both trials.		Is evidence that he most likely lied to agents or agents avoided pertinent questions. We’ll never know
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin And you don’t have to be “a target “ of an fbi Investigation, if you lie to the fbi in a criminal investigation you can be prosecuted
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin That he lied and Mueller covered for him as did Fitzgerald.	What is known is that Obama gave 4 agents his internal investigation report, BEFORE he was interviewed. This is important because the Feds already had key players on tape refuting what Obama states in his report.
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin You don’t think it’s a little strange that Mueller fbi interviewed Obama and not a single news outlet (the exception Judicial Watch) has referenced this interview? They have been chomping at the bit for him to interview Trump but neglect 2 mention that he interviewed Obama 4 2hrs
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin That he spoke with Obama directly via cell phone. Still Zagel denied over a half dozen request. Also available online is Balanoff testimony. Point being Chicago’s Mayor was interviewed by Mueller’s fbi and caught on wire taps and not a single “journalist” foia his 302’s? Not ONE
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin What came out was that prosecutors witness testimony of Tom Balanoff contradicted Obama’s internal investigation report written by Gregory Craig. Judge Zagel initially stated that if the defense could show direct contact with Obama he would release the 302’s. Balanoff testified
@MDMcCullough @CarolMarin Yes they were interviewed by Robert Mueller’s fbi in December of 2008. Obama was the first President Elect to be interviewed in a criminal investigation. Obama gave the Feds an internal investigation report that is available online but his 302’s couldn’t be obtained

@RepStevenSmith @WayneDupreeShow Cummings isn’t trying to “figure” anything thing out, he’s trying to demonize anything and everything Trump.....he doesn’t give a ratsass about PR, only the optics of how to blame Trump.
@ABC Mueller put Obama on the record and even though his 302’s have never been released Trump has them. Along with “all the tapes” and all the fisa warrants....check mate

@ABC It took the fbi 35 years and 90 victims and he confessed....maybe of the fbi focused on catching violent criminals who do harm to innocent lives instead of political enemies who oppose their fascist views.
@lawcrimenews Mueller has nothing, this entire investigation is a charade, pathetic.
