@1800flowershelp W00835442781043, this order was not delivered to my recipient today, even though I just received an email that it was. My name is Davis Bauer, email is davispbauer@gmail.com, date for delivery was for today at the recipient's business.
I had completed a ton of gigs and had 50+ 5-star reviews too. Sad that you guys would just delete it over nothing.
I just don't understand how this could happen without notice...I literally never broke any rules except for cursing at a rude customer once months ago. I received a warning. Now you guys are deleting my Level 2 account without any explanation.
@FiverrSupport hello, my account says that it was recently disabled without explanation, even though I had only 1 warning and served that warning through completion. The email associated with the account was: bauerd21@yahoo.com, please DM me about this when you can. Thank you.
