The Guantanamo Bay Executive Order https://t.co/vztE9195Lk
US National Security and National Defense Strategies offer an open hand of cooperation while seeking to strengthen military partnerships and support regional allies. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
CAPT Appleman, citing ADM Harris (USPACOM), stating PRC operations in South &amp; East China Seas seek to restrict, control, and coerce States operating in the region to seek Chinese permission to operate (even in areas not under PRC control). #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Gregory O'Brien points out that China's post-June 2016 claim actually more expansive of previously-ruled unlawful "Nine Dash Line" claim. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
On Freedom of Navigation Operations: @JamesKraska says FONOPS contesting excessive/unlawful claims &amp; restrictions at sea missed a moment to teach China in the early 2000s. If you don't assert your rights, you enable the squatter. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Professor Hunter: Why do we even care [about China's island-building]?	Professor @JamesKraska: We care because there were a set of bargains made wherein every State made compromises to gain some advantage. Also, there are some real geopolitical implications. #SecurityAtSea
@JamesKraska contends that under international law, China's historical claims over rocks and reefs in SCS are so weak that they border on bogus. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
@JamesKraska notes the irony that a non-binding organization (the Arctic Council) has negotiated two binding treaties (on search and rescue in the Arctic, and on maritime pollution prevention in the Arctic). #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Professor Kraska: Making the Arctic Council binding would give more authority and power. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
@JamesKraska says that it is ironic that US policy is to abide by articles of UNCLOS that are part of customary international law, but is still oddly hesitant to ratify UNCLOS (because of seabed mining). #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Does it matter that the US is not a party to UNCLOS? @JamesKraska says that non-member status is a source of embarrassment &amp; an irritant that interferes with US positions regarding disputes at sea. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Professor Hunter: What is the likelihood of the U.S. ratifying the Law of the Sea and becoming a member?	Professor Kraska: It is unlikely in the next few years but you never know. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Professor Kraska: The South China Sea is much less settled than the Arctic Ocean. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Starting the Keynote session with Professor @JamesKraska, interviewers include @AUNatlSecLaw Editor-in-Chief Chris White (@FamousFlipper) and @AUWCL Professor David Hunter. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Dr. Olliver: China also has their eyes of Greenland and their resources. They also see Iceland as a shipping opportunity. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
)Cont'd.) ...their interest and you will most likely see them trying to get their seat at the table. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingICeGrowingIslands
Student: What is the role of China in the Arctic?	Professor Percival: China has declared themselves an "Arctic State." The policy is pretty innocuous. China has been very aggressive in trying to assert... #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The Bering Strait Port Access Study was proposed by the U.S. and we are hopeful that Russia will join us in front of the IMO. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Student: Is a country's scientific research needed to be persuasive in the soft law environment?	Mr. Nevitt: Not necessarily because these agreements are in place but they are not enforceable.   #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Student: Has there been any proposals of a joint effort to move forward in arctic scientific research? 	Dr. Olliver: There is a lot of cooperation in arctic research.
Dr. Olliver: We're suffering for not being members. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Mr. Ellis: There are two things that would move along ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention: national security and industry.
"The Arctic is important enough that we do need to keep a good relationship there."- Ms. Caitlyn Antrim #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
"The models of the past can no longer be used as models for the future" - Mr. Mark Patrick Nevitt #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
There are not enough resources to protect United States' interest in the Arctic. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
There are no assets out of the Arctic circle that could keep up. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
There is no current plan for how, when, or where new funding will come for a new ice breaker. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The Coast Guard thinks they need at least 6 icebreakers to continue their research and keep up but as of right now, there is only one. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
There is no question that the events going on in the Arctic are so fast moving that the Coast Guard is so much further behind than they anticipated. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Changes were happening more frequently than the study count keep up with. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
In 2017, the Coast Guard recognized that in 8 years, things were out of date in the study because things were moving at such a high pace. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The Coast Guard would take this info to configure how to proceed. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The High Latitude Study was created to provide the backdrop for th eCoast Guard to understand what was going on in Alaska. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The Coast Guard used to run 80% of the coast of Alaska because no one else could handle such expansive land. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
If you take Alaska an overlay it over the U.S., it is quite expansive. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Senior Counsel at Blank Rome LLP, Mr. Jim Ellis II, is now at the podium. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
When we think about the development of the Arctic, we must also think about the protection of the indigenous people and the economy in the area. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Economics have slowed the development of oil in the Arctic. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
The Graphite Creek Deposit, if developed, can replace China's contribution to lithium batteries. Again, if it was developed.  #MeltingIceGrowingIslands #SecurityAtSea
The Arctic Domain: Open for Business. #MeltingIceGrowingIslands #SecurityAtSea
Senior Ocean Policy Advisor for the U.S. Coast Guard, Dr. John T. Olliver is now at the podium. #MeltingIceGrowingIslands #SecurityAtSea
Six issues that come up: Russia's baselines, straits transit issues, ice covered EEZ, extended continental shelf, law enforcement, IMO's role in the conflict #MeltingIceGrowingIslands #SecurityAtSea
Russia is developing a satellite system and looking into placement of Seabed Acoustic Monitoring Sites. #MeltingIceGrowingIslands #SecurityAtSea
6 Russian icebreakers work the Arctic transit routes vs. 2 American icebreakers capable of doing the same duty #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Russian icebreakers: 46 total; 42 heavy; 11 under construction; 4 planned. Support Russian operations and mineral exploitation in the Arctic. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Russia's approach to the Arctic resembles a business model &amp; they have been investing heavily in it for some time now. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Russia &amp; oil in the Arctic: the reasons behind their Arctic continental shelf claims are clear. Already control most of region's oil. #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Moderator Professor Percival now introduces Executive Director of the Rule of Law Committee for the Oceans, Caitlyn Antrim. #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Ice had been reduced by nearly 50% in the Arctic. #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
A possible complication? US is only Arctic Council member State not a party to UNCLOS #SecurityAtSea #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Mr. Nevitt brings up Greenland's uncertain future. Is Greenland potentially growing from climate change? #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
4 million people live within the Arctic Circle #MeltingIceGrowingIslands
Mark Patrick Nevitt introduces the 8 Arctic Countries #MeltingIceGrowingIslands

Thank you @kennethanderson, @ Brian Egan, @AlexZerden, and @EricaBomsey for the wonder financial sector panel. It was a great end to a wonderful symposium #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
The reason we have bank over-compliance now is because they used to do everything possible to avoid compliance. It has turned into a box checking matter rather than an effective way to check threats. @ Brian Egan @EricaBomsey #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Good to know that the courses being taught at @AUWCL are having real world impacts. @AlexZerden #SchoolSpirit #InformationPrivacy #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
The U.S. government should not be allowed to monitor us through our cellphones. We have the #4thAmendment for a reason. #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
AI might be able to determine if something is fraudulent, but it can't be substituted for traditional investigative work. @AlexZerden #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Banks probably would like more information sharing under Section 341a of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 - @ Brian Egan #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Who is better at analytics the government or the private sector. They are both looking for different things, so bringing them together should be the best for both worlds, Right? @EricaBomsey #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Do we have too many regulators to be effective in securing financial information? @ Brian Egan @AlexZerden #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
We should be working to update the frameworks in place to help the government work with banks. 1970 was eons ago with regards to technology, but how do we move forward on reforms? @AlexZerden #fintech #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Money transactions are one of the most crucial data points available when discovering networks during counter-terrorism investigations. @ Erica Bomsey #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
"You might dial accidentally dial a phone number, but you don't accidentally send someone money" - @EricaBomsey #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
"Sanctions, sanctions everywhere--are we over-sanctioned?" @ Brian Egan #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Should the government penalize financial institutions for not stopping cyber attacks? Can we ask a financial institution to be able to recognize every threat vector or make the most detailed threat assessment? @ Brian Egan #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Legal issues: financial institutions as law enforcement deputies (sanctions &amp; anti-money laundering), as diplomats, as targets in the cyberspace &amp; government/private roles #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Panel #2 on public-private partnerships in the realm of financial institutions and nat. sec. starting now. #NSLBFallSyposium2k17
Is there a number of voters that Russian bots influenced? Yes, roughly 123 million Americans influenced. Wasn't always for one side or the other, just wanted to divide us. What's the difference between a divisive human and a divisive bot? @merrittBaer #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
For $47,000 USD, Russian bots put out information seen by 123 million Americans during the 2016 election. #Bang4YourBuck @MerrittBaer #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
"Bots are like tunnels where the voices of people echo," but "bots should not be conflated with people." @MerrittBaer #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Why bother hunting bots with bots if there are no tangible effects? @Twitter @MerrittBaer #Effective #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Words are not speech sometimes, and other times action is speech, context matters. The #FirstAmendment doesn't give you a blanket right to say or do what you want. @MerrittBaer #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
@FamousFlipper @AUNatlSecLaw
Is Tim Wu right? Is the first amendment really dead because of bots? @MerrittBaer @superwuster #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
"Are bots Speech? They only exist if someone exerts the effort to create them. They are analogous to a tunnel where a human voice echos."  -@MerrittBaer #Bots #1stAmendment #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Bots are made by humans, for human, but they are not human -@MerrittBaer #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Welcome @MerrittBaer our Keynote speaker today! #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Join us in 15 minutes for our keynote address #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
It can even be hard to tell sarcasm from fake news @TheOnion
"Defamation isn't a right" - @JayCStanley @AllisonJBender. If someone is stating something wrong the other person has a right to make them stop. #Defamation #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
RT @FamousFlipper: @AUNatlSecLaw , should it be filtered or flagged? https://t.co/2JyKU9DnkG
Should there be a right to ignorance? @AllisonJBender says that no, you can't dictate what companies should sell to you. You don't have an inherent right to buy "fake news" #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
One panelists says yes, consider what it would look like to deny that right.
Is there a right to be ignorant? Is someone entitled to receive fake news that confirm a bias?
"It would be impossible to keep up with ISIS videos online in order to take them all down" - @ChrisMulkins #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
One panelist says it's important to consider why that particular content is being targeted? Copyright violations are different from something like a terrorist video.
What's the difference between censorship of copyright violations and censorship of Terrorist Mash-Up videos on social media? #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Are private companies using AI to scrape service providers for copyright infringing data? Is this the same as the government doing it for national security threats? @JayCStanley @AllisonJBender #ArtificialIntelligence #scraping #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Social media has the problem that they don't know who to talk to in the government and there are so many voices they don't know who to listen to at that. @ChrisMulkins #NSLBFallSymposium2k17 #SocalMedia
RT @anthonyrbjelke: @AUNatlSecLaw @YouTube In an ideal world, private sector companies would respect the first amendment, but for a variety…
@YouTube At least one panelist thinks that ideally, companies shouldn't engage in censorship.
RT @FamousFlipper: Fantastic piece by written by Abigail Kittredge of AU National Security Law Brief! https://t.co/ikEdxTglwD
What does the panel think about @YouTube scrubbing Al-Awlaki's videos? #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
You can advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government so long as you aren't inciting violence. Should we allow edge service providers to make determinations as to what should and should not be news? #NSLBFallSymposium2k17 #censorship #FreeSpeech
@StateDept is the lead agency working to counter disinformation. #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Digital is different when it comes to the #4thAmendment, nobody carries around a trunk with all their identifiable information in it. - @JayCStanley #NSLBFallSymposium2k17 #dataprivacy
The fact that a true threat is worth investigating doesn't justify mass social media surveillance. #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
How would Senator Blackburn's legislation change the Internet landscape? Thanks for the question @RyJulio35 #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Should anyone be doing the big data collection and analysis? Our panel's consensus is no the Twitter firehose is not for law enforcement purposes. @JayCStanley @AllisonJBender #BigData
How do you catch the bad guys without creating a ripple effect that affects the good? #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
There's more than just privacy at stake with online monitoring. We have to look at the 1st Amendment to make sure that we sites aren't curating content. @ChrisMulkins @JayCStanley #1stAmendment #4thAmendment #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
The U.S. government should be working with @facebook to access information. #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Social media can be a double edged sword, it leads to positive changes like the Arab Spring but can is also an effective tool for terrorist recruitment. There is a cost benifit analysis in which platform to use. - @AllisonJBender #NSLBFallSymposium2k17 #SociaMedia
Mass monitoring is not the way to collect effective intelligence  - @JayCStanley #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
"We want people to push the boundaries of discussion online, government monitoring could chill free speech online" @JayCStanley #NSLBFallSymposium2k17
Suspicious indicators embodied by attackers are also seen in a huge number of people who don't end up being attackers - @JayCStanley National Security Law Brief Symposium happening now @AUNatlSecLaw

Thank you to all of our panels and attendees. See you all next year! #WCLcyber
Student q: how about partnerships b/w govt and educational institutions?	Panelists: yes, the pipeline is important #WCLcyber
Stewart: govt is getting better at improving the infrastructure. #WCLcyber
Student q: what about the fact that China is also wanting to break into markets? #WCLcyber
Daskal: also have to think about the size of the country and that US is a high priority target #WCLcyber
Stewart: Israel is a good example to show that trust walls are not so high.
Inserra: this may be a question of scale. #WCLcyber
Student q: how about offering private companies incentives? #WCLcyber
Jaffer: threat is in the siphoning of our IP. #WCLcyber
Jaffer: govt needs to give a good reason to share info #WCLcyber
Inserra: need to give something for private companies to share info #WCLcyber
Stewart: there is already information sharing w/ private companies. Govt has to get in this trust circle. Will be a slow process #WCLcyber
Jaffer: don't see a real discussion happening about that trust yet. Hopefully new administration will push this forward #WCLcyber
Jaffer: we have to build the trust b/w govt and private companies. Lack of trust post-Snowden #WCLcyber
Student q: do we know any efforts being done that are trying to push forward an effort for resolution/r interagency efforts? #WCLcyber
Jaffer: it is troubling that the govt has not gone in that direction #WCLcyber
Jaffer: can't objectively deny that Russia is dangerous. Need to call them out and take action #WClcyber
Jaffer: lots of things going on despite early administration so far. But, we are seeing forward-leaning stuff. #WCLcyber
Jaffer: these are very different EO, but wonder where this will land. #WCLcyber
Jaffer: the new administration floated a cyber EO a month ago, looks like the '09 EO, new EO with forward leaning and strange initiatives
Inserra: agrees, but have to think about what will be most effective #WCLcyber
Jaffer: at the end of the day, ultimately, deterrence doesn't work unless you extract pain #WCLcyber
Stewart: it is  slow process to move sanctions forward b/c of govt considerations #WCLcyber
Stewart: sanctions are part of the toolkit that we can and should use more, though not in isolation #WCLcyber
Camille: liability is important to both private companies and govt #WCLcyber
Jaffer: don't see a legal problem with going a step further (beaconing, etc), but need clear legislation #WCLcyber
Daskal: But there are companies already doing this, can this be a model?	Inserra: Yes, but in the end looking to resolve questions #WCLcyber
Inserra: But, we would have to take this slowly. No one else is doing this, and we can expand this. #WCLcyber
Inserra: But, there will be a line. This way we get info to present to the intl community #WCLcyber
Stewart: but, shouldn't we expect an attack from an opposing state? #WClcyber
Inserra: active defense that are limited in attack force after identifying a possible option #WCLcyber
Inserra and Jaffer: but, let's not be risk-averse #WCLcyber
Inserra: middle ground may be Computer Fraud Abuse Act #WCLcyber
Inserra: how do we deal with countries that don't want to deal with those rules #WCLcyber
Inserra: this does need to be an intl effort, but be wary of the Budapest Convention #WCLcyber
Stewart: agrees, and that the govt is looking to what they can utilize in the toolbox. #WCLcyber
Inserra: need to be looking at commercial and financial restrictions, and whole-of-govt approach. #WCLcyber
Inserra: we can use all sorts of resources towards strengthening cyber security, but tailored and proportional #WCLcyber
Jaffer: we need to have more information b/w the govt and the intelligence community #WCLcyber
Jaffer: PPD-41 has some holes in it and doesn't take into account certain actors #WCLcyber
Stewart: threat-response and asset response are divided among govt agencies #WCLcyber
Stewart: PPD-41 focuses on significant cyber incidents
Inserra: we need to do more to stop the nation-state #WCLcyber
Inserra: are there steps we are willing to take to let private companies to engage in limited acts of defense &amp; become active #WCLcyber
Inserra: we don't want a "wild west," but look to "active defense" #WCLcyber
Jaffer: Now is the time to have a cybersecurity debate, not after we have a cyber attack. #WCLcyber
Jaffer: answer may lie in the govt and private companies working together #WCLcyber
Jaffer: we have not come to girps with the nation state threat to access #WCLcyber
Jaffer: there is an active effort to undertake destructive attacks, not just releasing information  #WCLcyber
We are honored to have @CamilleEsq , @jamil_n_jaffer , and @dr_inserra as our panelists for our second panel #WCLcyber
We are honored to have Professor @jendaskal as our moderator. #WCLcyber
We are beginning panel 2 #WCLcyber
Honored to have DAAG Adam S. Hickey as our keynote speaker. #WCLcyber
Jensen: apply proportionality to anticipation of impact of the cyber attack. #WCLcyber
Jensen: question of proportionality is dependent on the paradigm (criminal espionage, etc.)? #WCLcyber
Schulman: the incident should be over. Only time to escalate is during forensics #WCLcyber
Muir: need to have lawyers who know the value of the data that may be stolen #WCLcyber
Muir: it is essential for us to be flexible to prepare for different shapes. Flexibility w/in the bounds. #WCLcyber
student q: should we be able to respond proportionality to cyber espionage because it could easily become cyber terrorism? #WCLcyber
Jensen: Tadic is about when to assign indiv crim responsibility #WCLcyber
Jensen: Articles 4 and 8 #WCLcyber
Jensen: look at articles of state repsonsiblility #WCLcyber
Muir: 2 legal standards: operational control standard and Tadic #WCLcyber
Student question: What about the standard of proof? #WCLcyber
Muir: if this was a wild west scenario, then going to the prize system would make sense. But, this may create chaos. #WCLcyber
Schulman: the prize courts predate the modern intl system. #WCLcyber
Jensen: cyber stuff belongs in a territory, which may be difficult in regards to developing prize courts #WCLcyber
Jensen: international law applies to cyber #WCLcyber
Jensen: the reason we have law is to provide predictabilty. Ambiguity may lead to the wild west. #WCLcyber
Muir: If you're the US, then lean towards LOAC and list of options where your actions impact customary intl law #WCLcyber
Muir: Some groups are operating as if they are nation states. They will have leverage to conduct their own sovereignty #WCLcyber
Teplinsky: imagine if this is a nation state going against a corporation? #WCLcyber
Jensen: imagine the resources that could be used by states and given to cyber terrorists. #WCLcyber
Jensen: the offense has always had the benefit of the defense. More expensive to build defense than offense #WCLcyber
Muir: plausible deniability enabled through harboring cyber terrorism. #WCcyber
Muir: what are the options we can give ourselves #WCLcyber
Muir: after identification, we can determine actions #WCLcyber
Muir: eliminate who the suspects are.
@LawrenceMuir1 : peace through strength is what makes us powerful #WCLcyber
Teplinsky: what do we do after building taller fences, but the hackers build taller ladders? #WCLcyber
Schulman: Option 3 is updating software. #WCLcyber
Schulman: Option 2 is legislation, esp. state legislation. #WCLcyber
@RossSchulman 3 different options. Option 1 is regulation.
Teplinsky: gap b/w where we are now and where we need to be. what is necessary? #WCLcyber
Jensen: DNC Hacking if not unlawful under intl law, then US can respond with retortion. Not act of force. #WCLcyber
Jensen: what are the remedies? What do you tell the president? #WCLcyber
Jensen: if the Russians had hacked into the system and used it to change electoral results, that would be a prohibitive action. #WCLcyber
Jensen: what what the actor did to the united states coercive? Was it meant to coerce the political system? #WCLcyber
Jensen: next step: was this an inhibitve intervention? #WCLcyber
Jensen: Tallinn manual thinks of factors to think of to determine whether cyber attack was use of force #WCLcybe
Jensen: Cyber attack has to have a kinetic element to be considered an "armed attack" #WCLcyber
Jensen: Intl law approach-- is this an armed attack from state/nonstate actor? #WCLcyber
Jensen: Data is not a military objective per Tallinn. Up to debate #WCLcyber
Jensen: is data a military objective? #WCLcyber
Jensen: sovereignty and due diligence are areas that need clarity #WCLcyber
Jensen: black letter rule in Tallinn is where there was consensus, commentary is where they may have disagreed. #WCLcyber
Jensen: Tallinn is a statement where 20 attys looked at the topic and thought about what they thought the law was @ time of publication.
Jensen: Tallinn 2.0 speaks about the situations below use of force. #WCLcyber
Jensen: Tallinn 1 re LOAC and intl law and cyber security #WCLcyber
Jensen brings us back to Estonia in 2007 #WCLcyber
Jensen to speak about the Tallinn Manual #WCLcyber
Jensen: state level violence is in the hand of individual actors and states. #WCLcyber
Eric Jensen to speak on intl law and cyber security #WCLcyber
Muir: Work with the businesses to properly identify and protect trade secrets. Building security protects econ which protects cyversecurity
Muir: need to have ex parte hearings with judges for companies to seek remedies against hackers. #WCLcyber
Muir: Find a way for private companies to secure themselves. #WCLcyber
Muir: how can Congress incentivize people to take cybersecurity into their own hands. #WCLcyber
Muir: What do we have to do in order to protect Am. econ security, thus protecting Am. national security. #WCLcyber
Muir: you can't talk about domestic cybercrime without knowing the role it has in the global sphere #WCLCyber
Muir: stable governments and stable economies lead to stable national security #WCLcyber
Muir: Everyone that wants to be a lawyer...should probably have their own definition of foreign policy. #WCLcyber
Muir: everyone that wants to be a serious lawyer should have their own personal definition of foreign policy
Muir: the difference in the amount of economic impact is effected.
Muir: cybercrime effects the american GDP by .8%
Muir: Economic security is important. One specific area of focus is trade secrets. If these get out, you lose reason to trade with someone
Great quote by @LawrenceMuir1: modern philosopher is The Rock, and he says "know your role." Particularly important in cyber security field
Muir: the fact that the Russian hacking delegitimizes the election effects our national security.
@LawrenceMuir1 : "you cannot have military security without cyber security."
Live stream is here:	https://t.co/ENoBbrtwo9
Schulman: problem is updating every device's software with better protection.
Schulman: vulnerability of management and security updates is 3rd pillar of cybersecurity we should be thinking about.
Happy to have @RossSchulman from OTI ,@LawrenceMuir1 from W&amp;L Law, and Eric Jensen from BYU. @AUWCL_Faculty Melanie Teplinsky moderating
@RossSchulman speaking of the importance of encryption

Punitive Strikes, Keeping the Seas Safe https://t.co/66ksWb1V51 https://t.co/1Y8u1Pofwc
Thank you to all of our speakers and moderators for an amazing symposium. See you all in spring!
Rosenthal: Legally, it takes overt action to cross the line towards lone wolf terrorism. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Think of venn diagram b/w american values, govt capabilities, and what the law allows. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn: Everyone moving in 1 direction in counterterrorism doesn't work, and so does and too much friction #LoneWolvesNSLB
Rosenthal: Problem for the govt is that the American public has zero-tolerance for terrorism. Hard to strike balance in power of govt.
Rosenthal: There are benefits and risks in having a robust/overbearing intelligence community and government. Founders had thought of this.
Hartig: Govt. should be empowering and enabling authentic voices in the community as countermessages, but may be problematic #LoneWolvesNSLB
Hartig: If objective is to prevent this movement, don't associate an entire population with the terrorist movement. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Hartig: there may be a religious aspect in motivation, but it may not be the whole justification for their actions. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Rosenthal: religion as a leverage is not new. It can be a motivator of violence, but it can also be the motivator for peace. #LoneWolvesNSLB
@lawfare is there any way to avoid the religious issues raised in this discussion. Is it the motivator that we need to analyze?#LoneWolfNSLB
@lawfareblog how should we be talking about the role of religion/ideology/God in the radicalization process as a leveraging factor?
@DJRosenthal1 Should rights protect constant engagement of propaganda? What is the limit? #LoneWolfNSLB
If you are pure media, you are not target-able. You can't start collecting info on ppl just because of the videos they watch. #LoneWolfNSLB
@DJRosenthal1 these are case-by-case determinations. There isn't a 1st amendment protection to produce this prop. But viewing it is.
@lawfareblog should we be more worried about counter-radicalization or preventing foreign support or both #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: raises classic debate between law enforcement and intel. Intel officers want it up so they can see wht is going on. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig if you remove the ISIS marketing officers, then you remove a lot of the propaganda. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig the administration is finding ways to more creatively attack propagandists than using the AUMF.
@LukeHartig what does AUMF cover? if you are a pure religious leader or propagandist then you weren't attacked.That's outdated#LoneWolfNSLB
@lawfareblog Foreign extremists are reaching out to American kids. How do we stop that and what tools exist to do so? #LoneWolfNSLB
@lawfareblog but what about going after other people chatting online but not necessarily being in command-control attacks #LoneWolfNSLB
@lawfareblog : what should we do with the propagandists? Are they target-able? LOAC against ISIS propagandists is ok. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: NCTC does not deal with domestic terror. That relies on DHS. Int'l inspired actors are a blend of the two #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Why was the Comey/Apple conversation public? You want to make the enemy think you can read their convo #encryption #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig it's not just the big companies, but apps that allow encryption. What about going to other countries w/ diff laws to make apps
After a large attack, the pendulum will swing to the other side and we may see very anti-#privacy and anti-#encryption #LoneWolfNSLB
@DJRosenthal1 #encryption is a tough debate. How do large attacks change views on encryption? A 9/12 mindset #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig the problem is that ppl have early sympathies and then communicate with #encryption and then make the attacks. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig what pushes people over the edge? What makes the change from propaganda to getting people talking together about attacks?
Flynn: radicalization process is similar for both foreign and domestic radicalization. The issue is the 'acting' threshold. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Nat'l sec act 1947: separate law enforcement from intel activities as well as domestic from int'l #LoneWolfNSLB
@DJRosenthal1 differences between domestic and int'l terror links. ISIS vs environmental for example. What implications exist? #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Secondary, maybe watching videos but not at the tertiary level where you are actually going after terrorists. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Primary, general, few risks. Secondary, some risks take some actions. Tertiary, need to take serious actions. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Public health framework is effective. Primary, secondary, tertiary prevention. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: in 60% of cases lone wolfs tell ppl what they will do. CVE has similar ties to gangs and other organized violence. #LoneWolfNSLB
@lawfareblog Question: any reactions between panelists?
@DJRosenthal1 US policy is forged in the aftermath of devastating effects. Small attacks do not rally sufficient support to change laws
@DJRosenthal1 Local law enforcement will need to effectively allocate resources. Can't arrest everyone watching extremist videos
@DJRosenthal1 confidential informants are perhaps a more effective way to gather intel. Tons of false positives #LoneWolfNSLB
There is less bi-directional communication for lone actors so #encryption isn't the issue. #LoneWolfNSLB
Encryption is less of a problem for lone wolf attacks. They are reviewing public information and getting inspiration online #LoneWolfNSLB
Companies comply because they are forced to comply #LoneWolfNSLB
@DJRosenthal1 aftermath destroys some bridges that existed between public and private sectors. Companies felt compelled to push back
@DJRosenthal1 challenges in tracking lone wolf terrorists. Encryption and threats to the US. Fallout from @Snowden leaks. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig Hollywood, Madison Ave, celebrities are all fighting terrorism. But creating specific DHS office is very important #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig There is hope. Broad community of actors committed to countering violent extremism. Private and public sector #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig the advent of encryption has made interception in ungoverned spaces much more difficult. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig We are not good at preventing areas from becoming 'ungoverned.' serious policy and legal challenges with this. #LoneWolfNSLB
ISIS has much more effective propaganda than Al Qaeda and those messages appeal to a worldwide, open, virtual community. #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig ISIS also wants to occupy territory so foreign fighters can go somewhere to train #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig since there is no or limited connection, less to actually intercept. Enough small attacks at sufficient pace can be catastrophic
@LukeHartig ISIS broke the Al-Qaeda mold. ISIS model calls on people to commit acts in their homelands. No direct command #LoneWolfNSLB
@LukeHartig Tough to define lone wolf terrorism but you need to get it right. Look towards jihadist and religious extremists. #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: ISIS is taking responsibility for #OSU attack. Perp in France made a live video after attack. Similar links. #LoneWolfNSLB
Thank you Professor Kenneth Anderson from @lawfareblog for moderating our symposium on Lone Wolf attacks and Ungoverned Spaces #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Detection is difficult. Profiles don't work as well. Describes a large chunk of the population. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn: Another trend is more use of firearms (not just bombs). #LoneWolvesNSLB
@washdcnews Symposium on Lone Actor terrorism going on right now at @AmericanU by the @WCLNatlSecLaw . Follow on #LoneWolfNSLB
Flynn: Other trends include attacks against military and law enforcement. Faster radicalization in part from social media. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn: Incidents of lone wolf attacks has gone up in the US #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn: In scholastic study on lone wolves: they are acting alone. No material support or command control from outside. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn's definition: a terrorist who uses violence/fear of violence for political aims (have an ideology) #LoneWolvesNSLB
Flynn: There isn't really any fixed definition of lone wolf terrorism. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Panel 2 starting now #LoneWolfNSLB https://t.co/9fqTpLp66m
Daniel Rosenthal, Associate Managing DIrector at Kroll Associates, Inc. #LoneWolvesNSLB
Professor Carol Flynn from Georgetown University Center for Security Studies, Luke Hartig from New America
2nd panel beginning with introduction by Professor Kenneth Anderson.#LoneWolvesNSLB
Coordinating responses across agencies and with int'l partners is very difficult. Sometimes you just can't use a law enforcement approach
Sharing info sounds great on paper but achieving it is much harder. 	#LoneWolfNSLB
Really makes int'l law enforcement and intl cooperation that much more important. Joint Cheifs expanding targeting model worldwide
if you are to lower this threshold, then there are int'l and domestic legal consequences. LOAC make citizens enemy combatants? #LoneWolfNSLB
Should the intensity standard and those used to determine if we are in int'l armed conflict be changed?
Since the tools are limited, we may be forced to disrupt training camps within safe havens. We may need to rethink LOAC stndrd #LoneWolfNSLB
When determining appropriate response, limiting tools may result in bad consequences. #LoneWolfNSLB	few mil tools to fix this
May lead those to believe that use of force against groups in Yemen would fall outside the LOAC and humanitarian law. #LoneWolfNSLB
@ICRC : look towards violent acts in a limited area or specific organization to determine legal responses. #LoneWolfNSLB
If people are radicalized domestically from abroad, are they really alone? What is the most limited nexus?	#LoneWolfNSLB
Are people that go to ungoverned spaces for training Lone Actors? Or communicate online with groups in safe havens? #LoneWolfNSLB
Look to Caroline standards for LOAC for each individual act. 	LOAC is Law of Armed Conflict	#LoneWolfNSLB
If the individuals committing acts of violence are removed from the int'l groups, does the LOAC apply? #LoneWolfNSLB
This is a global conflict with no borders, different rules will apply. #LoneWolfNSLB
LOAC developed from era of state-on-state interaction. Anti-colonial movements in post ww2 era. Violence in one geo area #LoneWolfNSLB
there are intensity and organization requirements of the parties. Similar to ICTY case in former Yugoslavia. what types of arms#LoneWolfNSLB
What body of law applies? Non-international armed conflict beteen US and Al Qaeda. what does this constitute?
doctrines of limited force, using law enforcement would be very limiting. Especially in areas with no law enforcement. #LoneWolfNSLB
AUMF and lex specialis allows for greater uses of forces than domestic law enforcement limitations. Still have low act distinctions and cont
This would apply against Al-shabab or in Yemen. Doesn't apply to Iraq, syria, Libya, etc. Look towards customary int'l law. #LoneWolfNSLB
AUMF allows president to conduct operations against those who supported 9/11 or those planning terror against the USA. #LoneWolfNSLB
Afghan leaders thought that US would not respond with military force following 9/11 attacks. Military was effective in dealing w/threats
#OSU attacks with similar attacks in France, Belgium, are all categorized as lone wolf attacks, best thwarted by law enforcmt #LoneWolfNSLB
Theme: Use of force against lone wolf terrorism. Tying together lone wolfs and ungoverned spaces. #LoneWolfNSLB
Keynote Speaker Captain Todd C. Huntley, Director of U.S. Navy Int'l Operations Law Division. All remarks are his own. #LoneWolfNSLB
Don't let those with economic power to make all of the encryption decisions. #LoneWolfNSLB
Can gov't live with a certain amount of encryption?	Eatinger: up to the people to express what they want. Ppl should decide.	#LoneWolfNSLB
Relationship between law enforcement and community is important but actors are trained to resist detection. #LoneWolfNSLB
Is good police work effective to prevent terrorism? Faddis: gathering info via sources is the best prevention. #LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: if groups find that women attackers are effective then they will use women. Can't rely on dress, background, etc #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: typically preventing 20-something males. Female profiles may have different objectives. 	#LoneWolfNSLB
is there an increase in women committing terror and if so, why?	Szmania: "Bombshell" book with great insight into issues. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: these global companies are reluctant to work with gov't since it might not be appropriate in all countries. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: Identifying search terms. Connections to suicide prevention. Gov't feels like companies will do much of this on their own
Question: Gov't-private company cooperation against extremists	#LoneWolfNSLB
#AttorneyGeneral can step in but many different analytic methods at the table. #LoneWolfNSLB
if the line is too fuzzy, then the lawyers have a higher risk when making a decision. Reasonable minds differ. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: How to recognize limits of governments. Can't access 10% of nation but that's the part under terrorist control #LoneWolfNSLB
If you can bribe a foreign official to move chem weapons through border then is it ungoverned? How do you categorize smuggling?#LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: no black and white dichotomies between safe spaces and governed spaces. Matter of terminology. #LoneWolfNSLB
Press has an interest in getting a story out immediately, big issues on labeling domestic terrorism. No domestic terror dstinc #LoneWolfNSLB
After attack, often unclear to whether it was a terrorist event/ not in the first days of investigation. Reluctance to speak. #LoneWolfNSLB
NOT OK to profile people that view these sites. Like no-fly list, very few people have ties to terror. Easier to put on list. #LoneWolfNSLB
You can't have direct sources from locale to domestic. Everyone would know and you lose sources.	Issues of internet sources that inspire atk
Faddis: need to provide all 'possible' information to public. Leaks are catastrophic for leak when dealing with HUMINT.
We do not interact with media on how to report on terrorism. But happens in Europe more often. #LoneWolfNSLB
How should we balance threat vs role of media?	Szmania: build communities and inform them about threats. More info is better #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: Given unpredictability of threats, we need more people at the table. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: You can't arrest your way out of the problem. This is a problem with low incidence but high impact. Need more than law enforcement
Eatinger: only when you don't have a police force that can reach into spaces, and there is a threat, you use armed conflict. #LoneWolfNSLB
Threat of mass casualties to US was so high that it was effectively like combating a nation state in ungoverned spaces.  #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: you have to act consistently with gov't. In ungoverned space there is no law enforcement so you're left without those tools.
Benefits and drawbacks on War on Terror mentality vs Policing mentality. Law enforcement paradigm more effective?
Faddis: difference between Red Brigades (no mass attacks) vs groups like ISIS. RB more likely called off attacks to prevent collat damage
How do the different ideologies in groups dictate different responses?	Faddis: different groups have different risks, MOs, capabilities
Eatinger: We just need to have a process in place. Can't go off of instincts. Need to get people from all sides of arguments #LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: likely changes to the iran nuclear deal. Don't know how that will occur. In regards to Syria, we have limited options now
opinions on new policy changes in new admin: 	Panel, generally: no idea
Wermiel: if you have someone volunteer their ideas, then not a 1st amendment issue. If there was financial implications there might
leaders do the work of gov't. Europe has more training (like outreach to Imams) but US doesn't do that. #LoneWolfNSLB
Opening to questions: 	issues of speaking religious leaders and 1st amendment issues?	Szmania: reluctance to have domestic religious
Tangential areas in how to maneuver between governed and ungoverned spaces. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: domestically, we look to local communities to develop structures to be safe. Ungoverned spaces have none of that #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: we need an international effort to work together to end ungoverned spaces. Unlikely since so many different views on it
As someone taking teams in 'ungoverned spaces,' you can do some really effective things. But there are times you can't do anything.
@CHARLESFADDIS : let's be practical. Safe Havens are spreading. Much of the world is a mess and the capacity to change that is limited.
Eatinger: can streamline by jumping right into heads of depts, cut out lower review. Up to Presidential process. Pres. decids. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: it is a heated discussion. Tough conversation between policy group and law group.	Wermiel: is there a way to streamline?
Eatinger: its not fast. It is a thorough product from start to President. Once initiative is started then it goes quick. #LoneWolfNSLB
Wemiel to Eatinger: does the CIA structre work? It gives advice for the President. Builds decision making process. #LoneWolfNSLB
Just $10Million to the prevention of terrorism for #DHS. Not enough funding for such a high priority. #LoneWolfNSLB
DOJ wants those charged with material support to speak out and talk on social media. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: 	5)counter-messaging online. Counter-messaging efforts not in homeland per se. But international efforts exist. #LoneWolfNSLB
2) encourage bystanders/family to come forward. 	3) community training and resilience locally	4) public health approaches 	#LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: CVE recognizes that prevention is important. How to provide off-ramps for violence.	1) understand pathways and profiles
Szmania: Lone Actors are typically not trained. #osu car/knife attack is similar to other attacks in Europe. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: Clear indicators that Lone Actors have contact with other people. Not illegal to have radical views, but illegal to use violence
Profile: US has geographic disbursement. Typically young men but more women. 	No answers on how to help family of Lone Actors #LoneWolfNSLB
Finding ideological profile is an important law enforcement approach. Lone Actors have more in common with Mass Murderers. #LoneWolfNSLB
Lone actors are not just inspired by foreign actors. Abortion, white supremacy, etc. Across ideological spectrum. #LoneWolfNSLB
Lone Offenders are rarely alone, they have connections. HVE = homegrown violent extremists. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: Lone wolf term is out of favor in the govt. More of 'lone actor' or 'lone offender.' Lone wolf term is misleading. #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: was on drafting team for presidential policy on CVE which came out in october. "Lone Wolf" is not in favor, gov't likes Lone Actor
Szmania: 1) definitions and terminology 2) data on lone offenders 3) prevention efforts to counter CVE #LoneWolfNSLB
Szmania: CVE is countering violent extremism. DHS works domestically linking to overseas. Hurdle to gov't bureaucracy. #LoneWolfNSLB
@CHARLESFADDIS : ungoverned spaces are growing, as seen in 'shatterbelts' #LoneWolfNSLB
@CHARLESFADDIS AS horrific as the world is, the potential is much worse especially when dealing with people w/ an apocalyptic view
ISIS routinely uses chem weapons. France has issued chem weap. antidotes to civilian health centers #LoneWolfNSLB
We are not winning this war. Destroying the Caliphate won't end the war. This will take a long time. And it could get worse.#LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: Don't know if we are losing this war, but we are definitely not winning. #LoneWolfNSLB
@CHARLESFADDIS Enemy is shifting, changing. Many converts, not your stereotypical view. This is a worldwide process. #LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: Why do we care? We are in an ideological conflict. #LoneWolfNSLB
@CHARLESFADDIS We are not in a war with Islam, most of the people dying are Muslim. Different forms, like red brigades. #LoneWolfNSLB
Faddis: We are not in a war with Islam. Most of the people who are dying are Muslims who are standing against ISIS. #LoneWolfNSLB
@CHARLESFADDIS now speaking. Speaking on a personal basis. NOTE! PERSONAL STATEMENTS
CIA finds the international connection. Nothing more in the domestic sphere. #LoneWolfNSLB
Inspiration to commit these attacks comes from these ungoverned spaces. Domestic enforcement is needed to confront lone wolves #LoneWolfNSLB
CIA is precluded from internal issues unless there is a foreign aspect. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: Online media platforms are also run out of those spaces. Little easier to track. #LoneWolfNSLB
Safe Havens give terrorists space to train, allocate resources, and plan large-scale attacks. Need to preclude groups from these spaces
Why do we worry about ungoverned spaces? Gives an area of control for training and resources and engage in a bigger scope. #LoneWolfNSLB
President can sign for action then congress allocates $0. Proves Congress wants oversight and is capable of doing so. #LoneWolfNSLB
Only the president may decide to follow policy or int'l sec law or not. #LoneWolfNSLB Congress may only cut funding #PursePower
Always a very intensive intra-governmental review when these circumstances occur. What risks they are willing to take or leave it alone
There is a difference between an overt invitation and a covert invitation made by another government.
If there's an imminent threat and the host gov't is unable or unwilling to prevent threat then threatened state has legal right to prevent
What about when gov't doesnt give consent? When can you operate on soil of another country w/out consent? #LoneWolfNSLB
2nd ability of the CIA: covert action and determination of operation. #LoneWolfNSLB
CIA also has covert action as a tool. Influence actions overseas in a clandestine manner. Say one thing do another #LoneWolfNSLB
Still need to follow the principles of int'l law. Need consent of host gov't even though they have no control over the area. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: CIA's gathers intelligence. Determines whether some1 has pure intention or aspiration &amp; what is their plan. #LoneWolfNSLB
Obv. tough to get people into Safe Havens, but that is what we train people for. Just don't get caught! #LoneWolfNSLB
CIA has intel collection: case officers meeting sources and getting intel not from intercepts or sat images. Need that HUMINT. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: Who governs media or telecom in Safe Havens? How do you gain necessary intel? What tools are available #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: How do they get access to internet sources? Terminals? Cafes? Hidden spaces and intelligence needed. #LoneWolfNSLB
Eatinger: Ungoverned spaces and "Safe Havens" No gov't entity or partnership resources. All black hats or some white/gray hats #LoneWolfNSLB
@AUWCL_Faculty Stephen Wermiel opening discussion on Lone Wolf Attacks. Will discuss finance, geopolitics, gov't relations etc #LoneWolfNSLB

#NSLBEncrypt Thank you very much for our amazing moderator @MikeCarroll_US and panelists @jamil_n_jaffer @Robyn_Greene @astepanovich !!
The National Security Law Brief would like to thank Professor @steve_vladeck for his incomparable support and dedication to the brief!!
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich there is a bill going through congress that looks exactly like anti-encryption law passed by China. #UK has one2
#NSLBEncrypt Toomer: on the commercial side there is no benefit in not providing the highest quality product
#NSLBEncrypt Question: if American companies undermine their own technologies, how does that affect the trade of USA technologies?
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene lets not forget that our founding fathers used encryption #America
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene when business are making decisions they aren't thinking about 4th amendment, they are focused on company sucess
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer both  parties are dug in so much that we can't move forward
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer Government needs to be able to work with person who has access
#NSLBEncrypt question for @jamil_n_jaffer: do you hold the owner of the data or the creator of the data's vessel accountable under 4 amend?
#NSLBEncrypt Toomer: Corporations really needed the assurance provided by the government
#NSLBEncrypt #NIST we're securing unclassified uncontrolled information. Brand new associations and controls and all of this adds costs
#NSLBEncrypt we're flying mobile communication systems that have an entirely new risk culture #FAA
#NSLBEncrypt companies engineer to the standards set by gov't agencies. Risk management models have changed over time. QA and safety is key
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US what is the corporate perspective of risks. What about terrorists crashing the #StockMarkets, what is the model
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer but 90K is not mass surveillance!
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US what about the #Utah #NSA storage facilities?
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer the upstream collection is very targeted, there are only 90K selectors. Means less than 90K ppl.
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene 702 contains #PRISM as well as upstream collection. 30 day search pulls. Good evidence of mass surveillance.
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene talking about the FISA 702, which authorizes surv. of foreigners overseas.
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene but there is 90K under surveillance!
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer with the exception of the metadata program (prism) everything was very selective.
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer this is because we've been tracking them down! this forces smaller attacks but fewer causalities.
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich #brusslesattacks was a 'now or never' attack. More likely to have smaller attacks, the 'big one' isnt coming
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene investigating more reliable leads is more important than 'mass surveillance'. Mass surveillance obscures threats
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich TSA is 'national security theater', it doesn't really make us safer. What is the 'cyber' equivalent?
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich recognizing human rights should be a standard in future of privacy discussions
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich Privacy and Security is not a zero sum game. Privacy supports security and vice versa
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene security and privacy can work together. Privacy and security can coexist
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene we dont want to see our gov't engage in 'national security theater' Makes us 'feel' safer but does nothing
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene security affects us all. We are all concerned about our security and economic security
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US how should US manage security risks while providing individual privacy rights
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer smaller nation states are becoming more adept at attacking US vulnerabilities
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer bigger risk of economic security: the theft of IP from foreign nation state actors. Primarily China
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US what about when we get into bio-computers. what encryption would exist then?
#NSLBEncrypt Toomer: Nation states will always counter the counter-measures. Constant game of cat and mouse
RT @OTI: Don't miss @Robyn_Greene talking encryption at @WCLNatlSecLaw now! Watch live: https://t.co/DDqWiRtKIE
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US are humans the weakest link or is there always a way in through software
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US help us understand the tech horizon surrounding recent breaches in security
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene #TARGET hack was through remote HVAC system. lets talk about #IoT vulnerabilities!
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene reality is that the debate has to do with everyone, not just #SanBernadinoShooting
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich low chance that there is anything on the phone. Disputes over the icloud on/off evidence
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich 4th amendment gives access, but if the data is destroyed or blocked by #apple it is not guaranteed
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer what difference does it make to have a court order if you already have access through an undisclosed vulnerab.
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer there are clear links between #SanBernadinoShooting phone and terrorist orgs and there were encrypted texts
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer #apple thinks itcan opt out of 4th amendment. Apple wants to ignore court order. thats what this convo is about
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene new cybersecurity sharing bill limits information sharing by not defining PII requirements
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene 2009 Cybersecurity Act: this type of hand off would be a step in the wrong direction. I.e. OPM and DOD hacks
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene every malicious actor knows now that there is a vulnerability, not a theoretical vulnerability
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene you don't need #apple for proper encryption, most #encryption software is open source
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene this is not the NSA, this is AG's and PDs that want access to civilian phones. Strong encryption exists elsewhere
#NSLBEncrypt @Robyn_Greene lack of clarity as to this undisclosed vulnerability. #POTUS hand picked a cyber security team
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich there is a method for switching out breached CC info, but what about when your emails are compromised?
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich legal penalties for when your CC info and your non-financial info differ greatly. Different laws/priorities
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich we are stuck at the same preliminary question on encryption as we were in the 80's and 90's and it is absurd
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich UK may force developers to include malware in updates to allow gov't #backdoors
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich this precedent effects everyone, not just #Apple. this effects all developers.
#NSLBEncrypt @astepanovich we know #apple hasn't created perfect security. Look at icloud incidents. #Cellebrite etc
#NSLBEncrypt everything must be secure and care must be placed on acquired tech
#NSLBEncrypt 10^-9 probability that customers will be protected from attack. Boeing has 100 years of safety
#NSLBEncrypt Toomer the development of #NIST framework has become a reasonable security investment
#NSLBEncrypt @MikeCarroll_US #Celebrite responsible for iphone breach
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer gov't doesn't need court order when they know undisclosed vulnerability.
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer if gov't has access to vulnerability, why would they disclose it? #Apple wont give them a way in. Are we safer?
#NSLBEncrypt @jamil_n_jaffer what the gov't found is some sort of vulnerability in #iPhone. Gov't has vuln disclosure process.
Thank you for a very enlightening discussion! https://t.co/NR4rVzin2Y
#NSLBEncrypt issues of critical infrastructure and should gov't have 'killswitch'?
#NSLBEncrypt another question will be on the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure. contd.
#NSLBEncrypt Start the discussion on government's role in zero day exploits @MikeCarroll_US
#NSLBEncrypt Whole device encryption is just the tip of the iceberg. Let's go into what other vulnerabilities are out there @MikeCarroll_US
#NSLBEncrypt 	Welcome @jamil_n_jaffer	@Robyn_Greene	@astepanovich
@MikeCarroll_US Thank you for being our moderator for panel 2! #NSLBEncrypt	@jamil_n_jaffer	@Robyn_Greene	@astepanovich
#NSLBEncrypt Panel 2 is about to start! Come listen to a debate on the actions of private companies, courts, and Congress
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender we will see more effective coding and vulnerability management with a wider hiring scope
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender "hackathons" are great, and growing talent is important from both security and economic perspectives
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender talent gov. requires is a security issue. But talent alone is not enough, there are limitations to tech itself
#NSLBEncrypt Q: if we strengthen encryption, will this strengthen gov. capabilities b/c it forces gov. to accept this is a talent issue?
#NSLBEncrypt A: @AllisonJBender 4th amendment is critical in law enforcement context
#NSLBEncrypt Q: what do you see the implications of obtaining information from a 4th amendment perspective?
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender if individuals have skill set that the gov./FBI needs, they should be hired them regardless of who they are
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender if we can reduce amount of easy cybercrime and focus on the hard cybercrime, the public will benefit
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender what drives the market is not availability of devices but goal of criminals to obtain certain types of data
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender vulnerabilities are bought and sold in both white and black markets
@AllisonJBender discussing Nigerian botnet schemes #NSLBEncrypt
#NSLBEncrypt Cybercriminals gain access frequently through the same pathways - either through vulnerabilities or a known backdoor
@AllisonJBender hey guys maybe we should update Adobe Reader... #NSLBEncrypt
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender there are plenty of ways to get unauthorized access, even without backdoors
@AllisonJBender 2015 6K new vulnerabilities reported. Massive resources spent maintaining service.  #NSLBEncrypt
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender if you don't hear about these vulnerabilities or don't have a patch to fix them, they are going to persist
@AllisonJBender better to spend and fix or wait and patch? Opportunity cost of ignoring risks #NSLBEncrypt
#NSLBEncrypt @AllisonJBender vulnerability landscape starts with the code makers - recycling code, not always testing it, not upgrading it
@AllisonJBender you're probably not going to spen $100K to pen-test a $10K piece of software #NSLBEncrypt
@AllisonJBender vulnerabilities aren't always on purpose. Unmaintained freeware #NSLBEncrypt
@AllisonJBender Just like GoT or 300, someone will rat out your vulnerabilities #NSLBEncrypt
@AllisonJBender Vulnerability is like jumping a fence. Backdoor is like cutting a door open in the fence, sometimes intentional #NSLBEncrypt
#NSLBEncrypt Please welcome @AllisonJBender as our keynote speaker https://t.co/cBkY7IaN7g
#NSLBEncrypt There is always a relevant XKCD: https://t.co/ARqasddayM
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm When doing an unreasonable burden test, have to think of all future cases
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm FBI cannot maintain illusion that the Apple case will be a one-off thing (½)
#NSLBEncrypt A: @paulohm there's likely a lot of alternative methods used, it just isn't as well known
#NSLBEncrypt A: @normative there are alternative methods, but none work for every case. Some cases you have to use technological solutions
#NSLBEncrypt Q: why isn't the focus on methods like social engineering or retraining rather than technological methods?
#NSLBEncrypt A: @packetdude no one is going to want to use US services if they have all the keys, so there can be serious economic impact
#NSLBEncrypt Q: encryption debate can't exist solely in law enforcement but involves int'l community, must we consider global implications?
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm Apple is saying "just trust us" in their legal briefs, that being forced to create a backdoor is asking too much

#NSLBEncrypt @jendaskal one answer to government is that there is other non-content data (metadata) that contains other types of information
#NSLBEncrypt @normative nearly impossible to prevent people from securing data that has been concealed or prevent data from being leaked
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm we might be worse off than we were 5 years ago in terms of solving crimes, but we aren't as worse off as we think
#NSLBEncrypt A: @packetdude the ability to pull people over and acquire a wealth of information from their phone is extremely new.
#NSLBEncrypt A: @paulohm inability to look into phones prevents local law enforcement from effectively solving crimes in some instances
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm law enforcement is not a monolith, different agencies have different capabilities. Have to look to impact on local cop

A: @packetdude 3rd party control creates more variety, compared to the government trying to create one uniform standard of encryption
@ElcomSoft Please check out the #NSLBEncrypt symposium live stream on encryption: https://t.co/cBkY7IaN7g 2-6pm EST https://t.co/2DCbj2P2R2
#NSLBEncrypt Q: @jendaskal does 3rd party control create better outcomes, and what is better in terms of security and integrity of systems?

#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm dangerous because you are basically making it a patriotic act to spy on individuals/customers in the name of safety
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm question floating around: is it a good idea for the FBI to invest in creating cyber weapons to fight terrorism?
#NSLBEncrypt @paulohm everyone wants some imperfection in the system b/c you can't fight terrorism unless you look at private information
#NSLBEncrypt Bacci: you can apply another level of encryption to increase security, but doing so makes it difficult to use data.
#NSLBEncrypt Bacci: the minute you open a key, you automatically weaken your system and vulnerabilities will be added to the system.
#NSLBEncrypt @normative you can't have a reliable backdoor that users can circumvent. Otherwise, users could add their own encryptions.
#NSLBEncrypt @normative there is an obligation to create incentives for developers to avoid creating encryptions with negative implications
@normative #NSLBEncrypt in principle you can build a system with vuln. that would only be accessible by gov't. Not real world theory
Sanchez: Central question is whether the extent of access for law enforcement creates vulnerabilities #NSLBEncrypt @normative
#NSLBEncrypt @packetdude Flawed random number generators used in crypto is still being used. Left with long-lasting implications
Harvey: we are still seeing serious vulnerabilities with internet use due to crippled encryption keys on browsers @packetdude
@PacketDude serious vulnerabilities still exist in browsers following legacy of 90's encryption #NSLBEncrypt

Interested in the recent debate on encryption? Come out to our Spring Symposium on March 23rd from 2-6pm! https://t.co/gorQ69eBaK
Rishikof: But many private companies already have all this information.
DeRosa: The way information is handled in Estonia would never work here, mostly because privacy.
@steve_vladeck The auto-population of this form is what this issue comes down to.
Rishikof: If you fill out one form in Estonia, and you fill out another form, the first form's content auto-populates the second form.
Rishikof: If gov't server is attacked, private servers can come in with immunity.
Herr: Where does the burden lie for the standards?
What is the future of standards in the cyber realm?
Herr: Code itself is not dangerous it is the intended use of it and its dissemination.
Rishikof: If code is going to be considered a weapon in the context of export control, this is going to be a big issue.
Question from audience about export controls in the cyber realm.
Rishikof: You are seeing corporate suits, class action suits, shareholder suits, and government suits. They are coming from all directions.
DeRosa: You see lawsuits for data breaches and that is one of the things that is affecting the interests of the private sector.
Rishikof: If companies knew the government would step in at a certain point, that would be helpful.
Rishikof: The key element is the public-private sharing of information. Sharing surrounds the issue of liability.
Rishikof: Four hammers you have to scale: tax code, insurance premiums, regulations/statutes, and lawsuits.
DeRosa: More definition on the below the use of force issues in int'l law is important. #Art51_NSLB
Herr: Congress needs to stay away from security measures. Best practices is sure to come up but a law that locks us in could be disastrous.
Higgins: There is a need to determine what the remedies for armed attacks are. What are the limitations on economic espionage?
@steve_vladeck What should we be pushing for to advancing this conversation? #Art51_NSLB
Herr: It doesn't seem clear yet that there is a consensus of operations on a day-to-day basis.
DeRosa: Ambiguity in an offensive space does not give you more freedom to move.
Rishikof: Major corporations don't see themselves as American companies. These companies might have a heightened interest in int'l law.
Rishikof: At what point does the theft of intellectual property become an issue of national security? #Art51_NSLB
Higgins: Offense is what everyone wants to hear about, but defense is where the game is being played. #Art51_NSLB
DeRosa: The government interest in cybersecurity is different than the interests of the private sector.
Herr: NSA and CyberCom are more focused on the offensive.
Rishikof: One may penetrate but if they get in and your information is encrypted, you've provided a certain amount of security.
Rishikof: Vulnerabilities: Our software, our hardware, carbon units (phishing scam), and ISPs. #Art51_NSLB
Herr: We aren't good at securing our stuff so imposing costs might be difficult. How do we reduce the chance benefit will be gained from us
Herr: Sanctions have been a tool in the nat'l sec box for a long time.
Herr: The spectrum of capabilities matters in response.
Rishikof: There are a lot of other tools we can use that are short of hostility. #Art51_NSLB
DeRosa: What we deal with in cyber intrusions is much lower than what we would classify a cyber-attack.
Higgins: If it doesn't rise to the level of deaths or damage, then it potentially doesn't merit a response.
Higgins: We think the gov't is supposed to protect us from attacks, but what about intrusions?
2/2 @steve_vladeck Why is it that one is an armed attack and the other may not be?
1/2 @steve_vladeck I think we would all agree there is a difference between bombing Sony studios and hacking Sony studios.
DeRosa: Is it possible to have a cyber-attack against a movie studio? What kind of attack will reach the level of armed attack? #Art51_NSLB
DeRosa: Int'l law has been around for a long time. Can we apply int'l law in the cyber area? Yes we can, but it is slow. #Art51_NSLB
2/2 What is new is a non-state sophisticated entity could cause an action that would warrant a response such as taking down a power grid.
1/2 Rishikof: We have dealt with the issue of ambiguity before.
Herr: It is hard to get to a point where we can point to a country in the public domain.
Herr: We have always had difficulty in pinning the efforts of a group on their effects such as tactics and techniques.
@steve_vladeck : How has the cyber realm complicated attribution?
Rishikof: Our first set of attacks were masked to be coming from our enemies, but actually came from two teenagers in San Francisco.
Rishikof: Tallinn Manual II is going to focus on jurisdiction and state responsibility.
Rishikof: Are we looking for an effects test? A strict liability standard?
Rishikof: What is the nature of the penetration under Title 50? Is there destruction of data? An attempt to use cyber for a kinetic purpose?
Rishikof: Determining attribution is important.
Harvey Rishikof: What questions should we be asking in determining whether a cyber-attack has occurred? #Art51_NSLB
Higgins: When you hit a DoD network, you hit the heart of national security. #Art51_NSLB
Danielle Higgins: Attacks to military networks actually makes the situation a lot easier because we have all the intelligence. #Art51_NSLB
Terr: Capabilities and attribution may not necessarily be disclosed to private companies.
#Art51_NSLB @AmericanU https://t.co/Byn0U7nj0i
Herr: The IC may know more about the nature of the attack than a private company. And the IC may not be able to disclose this info.
#Art51_NSLB https://t.co/OU2QWfrxLE
Herr: Finding intrusions is difficult when a company is large and has a lot of data. Especially when the intrusion is on a live network.
Trey Herr: Fire eye and Mandiant, private companies, come into a company to determine the extent of the intrusion that occurred.
@steve_vladeck What if there is an intrusion into a private server? What is the perspective into what should happen next?
DeRosa: What can we practically do to respond? Legally?  Is it wise to respond? @StateDept , DOJ, Jag lawyers, etc. will be involved.
DeRosa: Would this rise to the level of an armed attack?  Unlawful use of force?
DeRosa: Or is it a take-down of a critical infrastructure or a part of one?  DHS, law enforcement, and intelligence would handle this.
DeRosa: If it looks like a cyber-attack, what is the impact? Is it stealing data or the sony intrusion where a lot went wrong?
DeRosa: Where is the information coming from, who is facing the attack, do they go to law enforcement, how does the info come in?
Mary DeRosa: what does the conversation look like when there is a thought a cyber-attack has occurred?
@steve_vladeck is kicking off panel 2!  Last panel of the day.  #Art51_NSLB
Jaffer: "Effects matter in cyberspace."  When it becomes destructive is when you start to pay attention.
An effective D-DoS attack can do serious damage to the economy. We are less reliant on these. D-DoS attacks are in the nuisance category.
One hopes that in cyber, we learn the lessons of "do what you say" if you decide to engage in deterrence.
We have faced D-DoS attacks against our banks for years.
Comment from audience: interesting red lines drawn by Obama: Sony attack was coercive, destructive, and it struck at the First Amendment.
Jaffer on Metadata: helps stop terrorist attacks both here and in Europe.
Old adage: gentlemen don't read each other's mail.  This no longer exists.  #Art51_NSLB
We are not responding to certain breaches or hacks because they do not rise to the level of what we must respond to.  #Art51_NSLB
Jamil Jaffer delivering his keynote speech at the Fall Symposium on Cyber-Attacks and Int'l Law.  #Art51_NSLB https://t.co/asCPqMwR82
2/2: determine when those red lines are crossed, and declare the consequences of the red lines being crossed. #Art51_NSLB
1/2: Deterrence doesn't work in cyberspace because it only works when you are able to declare capabilities, declare red lines...
We don't need to dramatically change what we do today.
Jaffer: You can still apply the same constructs and rules that we and the enemy understand.
You get protections of the Geneva convention when you declare your weapons.
When you see a plane in warfare, you generally know where it came from. But in cyber, it is more difficult to determine this.
There is no need to reinvent the concepts of necessity and proportionality for cyberspace.
The U.S. and China recently reached an agreement to not conduct cyber espionage. #Art51_NSLB #espionage
China is engaged in activity against the private sector for the core purpose of economic gain through espionage.
We have seen the OPM attacks, Sony attacks, among other attacks in the last few years.
Mr. Jaffer is discussing the concept that we don't need a dramatically new legal framework to analyze outside threats.
Will Richmond, Managing Editor, is introducing our keynote speaker, Mr. Jamil Jaffer.  #Art51_NSLB
Panel one is over, thank you panelists! #Art51_NSLB
Walker: not going to know until you see the end effect. Need post event forensics. #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: need to break down each individual step and ask 'is this an armed attack' in isolation #Art51_NSLB Then need to look at the totality
At what point does an operation start and an operation stop? At what point does routine scanning evolve into an 'attack' #Art51_NSLB
Walker: significant discussion on defending the nation in cyber space. what can we do to stop this form occurring? #Art51_NSLB
assuming use of force against US cooperation (person), may bring forth valid self defense issues #Art51_NSLB #Sony
Rostow: there is a duty for the government to protect domestic laws 	#Art51_NSLB	Ramey: domestic and maybe int'l hook for retribution
Rostow: good questions since most of our infrastructure is privately owned. @NDU_EDU Congress has had a hard time with new law #Art51_NSLB
What is the government's responsibility to protect private companies?	#Art51_NSLB
Walker: Intent is hard to judge. There are a lot of limitations on govt use of internet attacks fearing unintended consequences #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: Our nukes are so old they can't even be hacked. #Art51_NSLB #nothackable #tech
can a cyber attack be defined as a physical attack before or after it is carried out? Is force determinable upon consequence? #Art51_NSLB
What does legal escalation of cyber attacks look like? Capabilities are kept secret, deterrence requires public disclosure #Art51_NSLB
Is there a duty to hack? Is there a duty to use a non-kinetic option even though it may be more difficult or more expensive? #Art51_NSLB
Belligerents are held to the standards to which they are capable of rising. #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: IHL reaaally like to make the proportionality distinctions. 	#Art51_NSLB	#IHL 	@ICRC
If you have no way to respond other than kinetically, what are your options? #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: The pressure from places like Geneva to merge bodies of law discriminates against countries with outdated tech. #Art51_NSLB
Walker: also sanctions. look at NK. Don't have to jump straight to self defense.	#Art51_NSLB
Walker: first turn to countermeasures, usually unlawful but justified. Regime of necessity. Several options under int'l law #Art51_NSLB
Codero: what does the int'l community consider as alternatives to Article 51?	#Art51_NSLB
Ramey: not considered an armed attack. essentially, DOD leaves option for use of force when not entirely warrented 	#Art51_NSLB
cont. it.	govt would assume the worst and take measures equal to that	#Art51_NSLB	#MadamSecretary 	@ICRC
Ramey: in regards to #MadamSecretary hypo. Only called Air Force 1 when president is on board. If AF1 goes dark, someone in govt knows about
Rostow: Process and law are not luxuries. You can't abandon them in any event. In cyber it is particularly necessary #Art51_NSLB
Walker: maybe we institute counter-measures but might not raise to level of forceful response #Art51_NSLB
Walker: 'armed' is maybe not 'floor', but it is like the minimum. It is the 'red line'. #Art51_NSLB
next example is from #MadamSecretary	cyber attack against AF1. Didnt do anything to it. Not phys. attack. How would US respond? #Art51_NSLB
the attack will still need to be proportionate. Can't generate civilian losses that are excessive to expected mil. operations #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: Test for use of force is different for test of law of armed conflict #Art51_NSLB	Responding to armed threat with cyber attck-
Ramey: Space treaties govern activities but in bello activities adhere to existing contexts. #Art51_NSLB #space
Ramey: Art51 established use of force as a floor. left possibilities wide open. very tech dependent. #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: Caroline case says we look at each circumstance independently. Very relevant to cyber #Art51_NSLB #NDU_EDU
Don't forget about the bulgarians that told the iranians about their stuxnet problem. #thanks_bulgaria
if a nation state really wants to disrupt, it'll be hard to tell who did it. #Art51_NSLB
dont forget that dams have manual override! #Art51_NSLB #justincase
when data is the value, it can be considered an 'object'. Attacks on finance infra. would be much more insidious. #Art51_NSLB
Walker: using response gap, stuxnet is use of force but may not rise to level of 'armed attack'. designed to be not noticed	#Art51_NSLB
Rostow: nobody got hurt in stuxnet, did it give Iran a right of self defense? What would be proportional? #Art51_NSLB push back on labels
Rostow: measures in self defense need to be proportional and necessary. The min level of force reason. necess. to end situation #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: 1s and 0s are translatable to cash. you destroy that, is there coercion? #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: difference between economic coercion and the manipulation of data that results in loss of value #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: working on second edition of Talin Manual #Art51_NSLB #talinmanual
Sorry, it is not considered a use of force. Although it may be extremely harmful for a state #Art51_NSLB
Walker: under current structure of law, economic coercion may be considered use of force #Art51_NSLB
Not talking about destruction of virtual data, need physical effects with physical consequences. #Art51_NSLB
What about 'destruction' in a cyber attack? Walker: effects based test, need to understand broader impacts on civilians #Art51_NSLB
@NDU_EDU Follow us for live updates!	#Art51_NSLB
@NDU_EDU Dr. Nicholas Rostow, Robert Ramey, and Paul Walker are here at symposium on Article 51 of UN Charter. #Art51_NSLB	-
Talin manual in rule 30 uses 'cyber attack' to reference 'cyber operations' but in bello context. Dont use it in ad bullum cntxt #Art51_NSLB
less use of the term cyber attack in ad bellum context. DOD law of war man. states that 'cyber attacks' are not 'attacks'  #Art51_NSLB
Walker: vast majority of scholars consider use of force and armed attacks are different. Use of force may not rise armed attack#Art51_NSLB
"When do you lock eyes, who gets to shoot first?" Rostow	#Art51_NSLB
contd. people always like to discuss the term 'armed attack'	Today, we can can conceive of many forms of 'attack' #Art51_NSLB
the destruction of the Caroline, was that an armed attack? Better to view whole matter in terms of tech context. #Art51_NSLB
Charter uses narrow 'armed attack' language but does not define it. Caroline case is the most famous case for this. #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: not much of the protocol 1 is regarded as customary by US govt. Parts that are regarded are mentioned frequently #Art51_NSLB
Ramey: Art. 51 tips hat to that it is reflective to customary international law. There is a preexisting right to self defense 	#Art51_NSLB
contd. is fascinating! #Art51_NSLB
-for cyber, we need to look to see what the definition of 'armed conflict' is. Definition of term 'attack'	Advent of DOD law of war manual
exception: Humanitarian exception, protection of nationals. 	Mandate of @ICRC is to protect victims in armed conflicts	#Art51_NSLB
contd. Evidence of illegality of force as policy @ICRC	Consent of target state, Implied or Express	Regional arrangements	#Art51_NSLB
Ramey: discussing jus ad bellum. Art 24: all members shall refrain from use of force against any state	@ICRC #Art51_NSLB
Art 51: nothing should impair the right of self defense if there is an armed attack against a member of the UN #Art51_NSLB	#startingoff
Walker: Disclaimer; listed in the Talin Manual but as peer reviewer. Also participating in Talin 2.0. #Art51_NSLB
cont. very dangerous to apply labels to tech without specific knowledge #Art51_NSLB
cont. writing on law of self defense and Article51 emphasizes realism. Is most central part of security. #Art51_NSLB
Rostow: Fountain pen user. Can't be hacked. #Art51_NSLB
cont. Challenge report prominently features cyber threat #Art51_NSLB
Robert Ramey: Background in Air and Space Law. Where does cyber end and space begin. Appreciate the cyber touchpoints in diff. domains
#Art51_NSLB https://t.co/GQ6CHOPteS

Cantina band song now stuck in my head as well as @steve_vladeck 's head. Thank you to everyone who came out and to those watching online!
You cannot generalize about who #MilitaryK are. Its the Star Wars Cantina band in mess hallls overseas. @ProfSchooner
Burke:	The floodgates won't open. Doesn't make economic sense 	#MilitaryK
Question from audience:	If we opened up civil litigation to #MilitaryK, what would happen?
Burke: Congress should take responsibility of people harmed either by armed forces or #MilitaryK
Are you in the draft? asks @ProfSchooner
Question from audience:	Seeing that we need people to do the jobs required by #MilitaryK, who would take their roles should we limit them
@steve_vladeck We should pursue a regime where people with similar roles should abide by similar rules. #MilitaryK
Question from a #MilitaryK in the audience:	I agree with @ProfSchooner
Burke:	We're essentially dealing with massive staffing agencies. Not a huge barrier to entry and they're making huge profits. 	#MilitaryK
Burke:	If you look at where the money is going then you'll see that the Ks are extremely lucrative. 	#MilitaryK
No truth to the myth that #MilitaryK are more expensive unless you take all of the benefits into account @ProfSchooner
#MilitaryK are cheap because they're easy to fire and aren't getting care for life. 	@ProfSchooner
@ProfSchooner 	until we're willing to have a conversation about the draft, let's not talk about the need for #MilitaryK
Courts can't question military/foreign policy under the political question doctrine	@McKennaLong		@steve_vladeck Some policies relate to it
The choice to use #MilitaryK implicates foreign policy decisions as well as military decisions.	@McKennaLong
The only remedy a #MilitaryK has against his employer is the defense based act	@McKennaLong
Burke: when the gov't contracted with these parties, they assumed the risk and required the companies to buy insurance 	#MilitaryK
Burke: Some of the agencies (CIA) hired #MilitaryK on a case by case basis. Bargained for employees rather than sign massive Ks
The choice of #MilitaryK is on the government. Congress has moved in one direction, increasing liability against #MilitaryK @CACIIntl
Either forgo military operations or supplement the operations with #MilitaryK. The US chose the latter	@CACIIntl
@CACIIntl	by drawing down the US military in the 90s, there was a need for more #MilitaryK. Especially interrogators.
@ProfSchooner	Contd. So who should be liable? They are sharing the same roles.
@ProfSchooner	originally all drones were flown by #MilitaryK but switch seats with US Air force pilots. All the same actions really
@McKennaLong	Although not expressly immune, #MilitaryK have a reasonable immunity.
@McKennaLong	#MilitaryK has to act within scope of K. If not, then the FTCA wouldn't apply. No express immunity to #MilitaryK
Burke: Because the #MilitaryK companies lost the first time
@steve_vladeck 	Why hasn't congress revisited the question of #MilitaryK liability?
Burke: We need to look at how corporate structure exists to control its employees
@ProfSchooner	the only reason that the #MilitaryK were in Abu Ghraib was because the government sent them there.
@ProfSchooner	Sovereign immunity. @ProfSchooner isn't a fan. The reality is that the gov't has it
(Contd) thing as US Forces. That's how important #MilitaryK are. Why should we not apply the same protections to them?
@ProfSchooner	generational political pressure to outsource has led to the widespread use of #MilitaryK. They're essentially doing the same
Question to the audience	On your understanding, should courts understand the FTCA and apply it to #MilitaryK? @steve_vladeck
Captain @steve_vladeck would be safe from suit if he was working alongside #MilitaryK and enemy combatant got hurt and sued.
@CACIIntl 	Federal Tort Claims Act prevents gov't from getting sued. What happens when the gov't works closely with #MilitaryK.
@McKennaLong	The obstacle preemption was what was present in the Boyle case and applies to #MilitaryK
Burke: even if we use the Boyle framework there is no liability for the warzone framework that we see today #MilitaryK
@steve_vladeck Boyle v. United Tech. should apply to this situation as well
Burke (answer): Are we gonna say that all US corporations working in foreign countries are immune to liability?
@McKennaLong	This tort claims act is being transferred to #MilitaryK.
@McKennaLong	The government is advocating the Torts Claim Act which states that you can't sue the US Military for tort acts during wartime
@McKennaLong	Litigation burdens can lead to second guessing, high costs, and a chilling effect on #MilitaryK.
@McKennaLong	Suits against #MilitaryK almost always implicate Federal interests.
@McKennaLong	3rd party state law tort litigation is not a good way to keep #MilitaryK accountable. Leave it more to the US Gov't/Forces
@McKennaLong Not just torture cases. Slip and falls, liability suits are part of this conversation.
Burke: You have a disconnect in the monetary levels. You're getting low dollar amounts in civil suits although it does act as a deterrent.
Burke: People who are tortured by corporate actors (#MilitaryK) have fewer resources available to them in their recourse
@CACIIntl One thing that has happened since AG, #MilitaryK have been subject to more laws than US armed forces.
@steve_vladeck to @CACIIntl Are you comfortable with the scenario where #militaryK in the field are subject to military jurisdiction?
@CACIIntl	Government has the resources has the resources and wherewithal to supervise #MilitaryK, although they have their own war to fight
@CACIIntl	Military is probably in the best position to provide the investigatory resources regarding crim acts of #MilitaryK.
@CACIIntl	gov't has civil and crim recourse against #MilitaryK but it is difficult to follow through given extreme circumstances.
@CACIIntl What happens if a #militaryK engages in conduct that violates the contract and the law?
Panel Two is off to a great start! #MilitaryK #NSLB http://t.co/mmePeAsyna
@ProfSchooner	There are floating arsenals out at sea where #MilitaryK can pick up their weapons rather than returning to ports off of Africa
@ProfSchooner	The one contractor we cared about, we lied to. KBR losing 100+ in Iraq/Afghanistan
@ProfSchooner 2 most dangerous jobs for #militaryK are driving vehicles and interpreters.
@ProfSchooner Is the #militaryK installing a sidewinder missile a #militaryk? Is the drone operator a #MilitaryK.
@ProfSchooner The US Military has, through outsourcing, been able to maintain and sustain the largest presence in history. 	#LOGCAP
@ProfSchooner If you think about #MilitaryK as guns on the battlefield, then you miss a lot of aspects of what their roles are.
Panel 2	Moderator: @steve_vladeck 	Susan Burke	Lawrence Ebner-@McKennaLong	J. William Koegel Jr.-@CACIIntl	Steven Schooner-@ProfSchooner
Panel 2 is about to start: Accountability and how we best design the regime in which #MilitaryK are managed
Thank you for serving as the keynote speaker of our Spring Symposium Chief Judge James E. Baker. #MilitaryK #CAAF
C.J. Baker notes the transparency question where the War Powers Report does not cover contractors. #MiltiaryK #NSLB
C.J. Baker states if you don't have investigators in the field, accountability regime has to take this into account.
C.J. Baker notes legal accountability is the #1 issue people jump to. But C.J. believes criminal law is the base standard of society.
C.J. Baker notes the efficacy and perception issues of contractors. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker asking will contractors be protected by the Geneva conventions? If not, what will protect them? #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker states operational responsibility of PMCs is clouded. There is no clear command.
C.J. Baker stating contractors can serve as an important tactical reserve. They have unique skill sets. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker "Contractors are neither good nor bad, they're essential." #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker encourages the audience to consider contractors in different ways ranging on the contract they work on and who they work for.
C.J. Baker states the OMB focuses on interrogation of PMCs and notes the discretionary aspect of this.
C.J. Baker states that you can go from a non-combat position to a heavily-combative position in little time. Where do you draw the line?
C.J. Baker asks "what role should contractors play in deployed contexts?" #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker notes that contractors in cyberspace count as contractors too and we must consider them. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker says we must not consider contractors that are close to combat, but those in the US that are engaged in hostilities (drones).
C.J. Baker defines a contractor as those near combat, in combat, or near the hostilities. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker, keynote speaker at the @WCLNatlSecLaw symposium. #MilitaryK http://t.co/EoMP67YRb6
C.J. Baker noting over 1,000 of contractors died in Iraq and Afghanistan. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker discussing the post-9/11 period where "contractors have been more noticeable both in number and impact." #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker discussing the history of contractors dating back to the ancient Egyptians. #MilitaryK
C.J. Baker notes the National Security Law Brief is an important part of WCL. #MilitaryK
Chief Judge (C.J.) James E. Baker has served as C.J. of CAAF since 2011 and a judge since 2000. #MilitaryK
The Keynote speech, featuring Chief Judge James E. Baker, is beginning now. #MilitaryK
We will be on a break until 4:00pm. At that time we will hear from our Keynote, Chief Judge James E. Baker of the CAAF. #MilitaryK
DeWinter-Schmitt speaking to transparency of the compliance of PSCs. #MilitaryK
@katericarmola Internal/external compliance can go through the general counsel of a PSC, but typically goes through the PSC management.
Does the Att'y Client Privilege apply to compliance within PSCs?
@katericarmola Iraq and Afghanistan were unusual because we were trying to re-build the country during conflict.
@vanidan believes that the military can respond to short-term conflict without PMCs. But we have to have them if we want to be global.
Navarre the military force sizes will not increase in the next five years. The ability to surge into new conflict without PMCs is difficult.
Could we accomplish military missions without PMC/PSCs?
Time for questions from the audience! #MilitaryK
@katericarmola CIA contracting is immune from pretty much all regulatory mechanisms. #MilitaryK
DeWinter-Schmitt stating nat'l sec concerns will trump other concerns.
.DeWinter-Schmitt responding to @katericarmola stating bringing everything back home is not realistic. #MilitaryK
@katericarmola This is why we need to have smart regulations. These don't often attract Int'l humanitarian lawyers though.
@katericarmola thinks all our int'l activities (carrying guns in our name) should all be US gov't actors...but this isn't going to happen.
.Navarre stating there must be a policing force for internal compliance because these are more important than statutes or regs. #MilitaryK
Panel One speakers discussing the history and current scope of military contractors. #MilitaryK #NSLB http://t.co/mWwYEspQrI
(2/2) Some regulatory mechanisms absolutely tanked based on the personalities of the negotiators. #MilitaryK
(1/2) @katericarmola "Personalities really matter in the business of compliance."
DeWinter-Schmitt What can gov'ts do to regulate extraterritorial activity from PSCs especially when host States can't effectively regulate?
@katericarmola There is an office taking complaints abroad for PSCs at checkpoints. But does this complaint actually make it back to the US?
(2/2) to create this patchwork of statutes that impose accountability to PSCs. #MilitaryK
(1/2) Navarre stating that since the Civil War, the US Gov't has used the False Claims Act, the military extrad. jurisdiction act, etc. ..
DeWinter-Schmitt stating going down the chain of command to the security officer on the ground is key.
@katericarmola explaining PSC1 and PSC2, including convos with every person in the chain of command, is important to the audit process.
.@vanidan stating prior military experience of PSC employees is not indicative of if they will follow regs. #MilitaryK
(3/3) The chain of command makes the accountability system work. #MilitaryK #NSLB #PSCs
(2/3) look very similar to how the military would operate and how PSCs are held accountable.
(1/3) .Navarre stating PSCs with folks who are out on the ground, being commanded by supervisors and their chain of command...
.Navarre responding to @katericarmola discussing that individuals that work in PSCs typically have a military background.
@katericarmola Under PSC1, the behavior of subcontractors is the responsibility of the contracting company. #MilitaryK #NSLB #liability
@katericarmola discussing the organizations that audit PSCs abroad and hold them to high standards. #MilitaryK
DeWinter-Schmitt If you want to get a contract with DoD, you must be able to demonstrate you adhere to certain standards. #MilitaryK
DeWinter-Schmitt reiterating that voluntary regs is not an accurate way of referring to regs for PMCs. #MilitaryK
(2/2) The doc also talks about ensuring obligations for PMCs. The doc was supposed to be translated into Int'l Law but has not yet been.
(1/2) DeWinter-Schmitt states the Swiss gov't developed a non-binding declaration called "The Mantra Document"to regulate PMCs.
DeWinter-Schmitt discussing how the privatization of regulation of PMCs is not necessarily voluntary. It is an act of choice by the States.
@jendaskal asking Rebecca DeWinter-Schmitt about the development of regulations following the increase in PMCs.
@vanidan posing the question how have the obligations of PMCs evolved over time?
@jendaskal asking @vanidan to discuss PMCs trends over time.
Navarre shifting our attention to the DoD OGC Jan. 2006 opinion on Private Security Contractors (PSCs) in the battle space. #MilitaryK
Michael Navarre of @SteptoeLLP discussing the difference in logistics of PMCs from WWI and WWII to the Gulf War. #MilitaryK
@katericarmola private military companies (PMCs) are looking to provide armed mobile security and static security for embassies. #MilitaryK
@katericarmola discussing the type of work military contractor companies are looking for in non-war time. #MilitaryK
Ms. Kateri Carmola .@katericarmola: the operational environment has changed but, at the same time, the risk environment remains high
Panel one, on the history and scope of military contractors, is starting, moderated by Professor Jennifer Daskal @jendaskal #MilitaryK

Thank you panelists @cullystimson @deviatar @AndrewBorene Andrew Carswell and moderator @steve_vladeck .
@steve_vladeck : Practically, it won't matter. I don't see this admin subjecting suspects to long term detention.
@cullystimson : If we capture an ISIS person it is more difficult in court proceedings to justify detention. 	#NSLB_AUMF
Question: if were were to have an ISIS AUMF, would we be able to claim detention authority?
cont' @AndrewBorene : weigh on on the actions of the US
@steve_vladeck : How far back in the chain of events can you go before it's no longer preventative?	@AndrewBorene : The actions of the enemy
@steve_vladeck : Justice O'Conner det'rmd that AUMF should have detention auth. because it followed the Rules of Law
@AndrewBorene : Delicate issue of contacting armed parties and distinguishing them as parties in conflict. 	#NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : When it comes to the issue of non state actors, the issues comes down to organization and intensity of actions.
@steve_vladeck : There are 143 people in Gitmo. Good check on current events.
@cullystimson : Supreme Court was tired on weighing in on legal authorizations for the long war. 	#NSLB_AUMF
con't: a hangover of the last war. 	#NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : The courts are traditionally very deferential to nat'l sec. 67% of americans support action against ISIS. However, there is
@deviatar : in regards to the last tweet. There is a difference between degrade and destroy and the administration needs to make that choice
@deviatar : congress needs to decide on the objective. Degrade or destroy ISIS? There should be a sunset less than 5 years.	#NSLB_AUMF
previous tweet by Carswell
We need a plan. If we say 'eradicate ISIS', it becomes a political (not legal) question. Is there an end date or just postponing decisions?
@AndrewBorene Tough to make an operational planning to destroy ISIL if there is a 1-5 year limit. Think of 5-10 years
in response to @steve_vladeck. @AndrewBorene : ISIS are not privileged combatants. Is the only endpoint is to destroy ISIS?
@cullystimson : Defining the opposition in the AUMF gives the administration the flexibility to make real time determinations. #NSLB_AUMF
@deviatar : The '01 AUMF by failing to identify opposition has been used to justify much more than what war would be defined as. #NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : You have to allow some level of appropriate secrecy in war and security. #NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : Notice requirements could make you lose surprise aspect. #NSLB_AUMF
Carswell: Can you use extraterritorial force for this? Spillover conflict, can you use lethal force? No, you don't need to use lethal force.
Carswell: Member of ISIS walks off battle field to a place that doesn't have conflict, this individual carries the battle field with him.
@cullystimson : "An AUMF is not a substitute for a strategy." It is the legal authorization to carry out the strategy. #NSLB_AUMF
@steve_vladeck : We are all kind of on the same page that we need a new AUMF. What should it say? #NSLB_AUMF
@deviatar : Specify who and what is the objective. Needs to be clear to the military. #NSLB_AUMF
@deviatar : It is politically advisable to have a new AUMF. Would require Congress to consider who we are at war against. #NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : Any AUMF should require an "in order to" statement to be clear what the purpose is. Not necessary today though. #NSLB_AUMF
@AndrewBorene : It will be helpful on a political basis if Congress re-approves something so we can show we are united.
Borene: A new AUMF is not necessary. The only check on the President will be appropriations not the WPR. #NSLB_AUMF
@steve_vladeck : Is a new statute necessary? #NSLB_AUMF
Carswell: Membership in non-state group, you become a member by virtue of your function (directly participating in hostilities, etc.).
Panel Two is in the midst of a heated discussion on ISIS and the AUMFs. #NSLB_AUMF @steve_vladeck http://t.co/JSxBUyukw0
@cullystimson : This war is going to take a long time. Legally speaking, you can argue ISIS fits nicely or not within the '01 AUMF.
@cullystimson : ISIS didn't exist when the '01 AUMF was passed. But, this is an interfamilial fight so, do you need a new statute?
@deviatar : To go back into Iraq, the US has to decide if it is a conflict we want to be involved in. It's a different conflict than before.
@deviatar : If you don't have limits, the war will keep going. We need to clarify who it is we are fighting and where. #NSLB_AUMF
@deviatar : This issue needs to go to Congress. They need to have the debate, what is the US's interest? #NSLB_AUMF
@deviatar : The '01 and '02 AUMFs are specific and not related to today. It is hard to make the argument ISIL is a part of that al Qaeda.
Vladeck: What is wrong with the status quo with the AUMFs? Why don't we just say everything is fine? @NSLB_AUMF
Borene: It changed so quickly. They are a super-terrorist organization with specific design on how to attack us.
Vladeck: What changed this summer?
Borene: We learned how quickly this Islamic state could move just this year. They are holding a lot of real estate on the border. @NSLB_AUMF
Borene: Rebranding of terrorist groups combining al Qaeda with ISIS/ISIL.
@steve_vladeck is introducing the panelists: Andrew Borene, Andrew Carswell, Daphne Eviatar, and Charles "Cully" Stimson. #NSLB_AUMF
Panel Two moderated by @steve_vladeck  is beginning and will discuss ISIL and the AUMFs. #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: No, it expands. The President has the power to repel, but once 60 days have passed, that might be the limitation of CIC powers.
Jesse's question from floor: Has trouble understanding how the WPR undermines the powers of the CIC powers, what are your thoughts?
Donohue: Military contractors were using SSP to get out of all sorts of matters. Courts would back off immediately without looking.
Donohue: State secrets privilege, Bush Administration was using SSP differently for national security cases. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: Evidence obtained by FISA warrant to prove probable cause has not yet been ruled on. #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: But you can't use this telephony metadata without violating the 4th Amendment. Need a warrant for use of intelligence information.
Donohue: What if you want to use this telephony metadata for prosecution? FBI takes data for 702 and 215 purposes and uses it sans warrant.
Donohue: Responding to question from the floor on surveillance and constitutional issues.
Murray: When do AUMFs end? Can it continue for forever? #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: After the Berlin nightclub attack, President Reagan launched repelling attacks. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The realities of modern Congress show that the full Congress does have to delegate certain functions to committees.
Donohue: WPR Sec. 2(c) and Sec. 5 should be removed because of the Constitutional grabs at power by the Legislature. #NSLB_AUMF
FIsher: The WPR Sec. 8 is very constructive material. Sec. 2(A) could be removed because it lacks the Framer's intent. #NSLB_AUMF
Murray: You would have to define hostilities to make the WPR better. It is an imperfect law we will have to live with. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The WPR has proven resilient. Pres Obama purports to be a big supporter. Is the WPR a bad idea-how would you improve it? #NSLB_AUMF
Fisher: Continued resolution, unconstitutional process of letting other countries give the DoD funding for wars.
Marcus: We are following a stateless enemy all over the world and defining them in a broad way. #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: We can't use Article III courts and the criminal justice system to try terrorists and this is harmful.
Marcus: Does our experience with the AUMF show that the war paradigm for our conflict with terrorist organizations is the wrong one?
Shoon: The 2001 AUMF gives the Pres the ability to use lethal targeting anywhere in the world if they can connect it to al Qaeda. #NSLB_AUMF
Shoon Cont: Obama expanding it to ISIL is taking the scope of the 2001 AUMF far too broadly.
Shoon cont: saw it as an overarching authority including interrogation, NSA domestic surveillance, etc. Obama has also broad interpret.
commenting on the 2001 AUMF	Shoon: historically and going forward. Historically: interpreted far beyond intent. Bush saw it as a dec. of war
Donohue: If the congress says 'no' to war, then the answer is no. There should not be continued attempts to force the agenda of war.
Thank you very much Sandra Hodgkinson for your time on the panel today!	#NSLB_AUMF
Hodgkinson: A new AUMF for the president would absolutely benefit him	#NSLB_AUMF
Hodgkinson: What the AUMF give the presidency 1) legitimacy 2) funding 3) easier to accomplish objectives	#NSLB_AUMF
remember to check out the live stream at http://t.co/6nPaTM6ZKC
Murray: What could the president do? He could write a targeted plan for ISIL.
Murray: The AUMF was a greenlight for a shadow war. Lack of transparency as even to who we are at war with.
Hodgkinson: no one has been held accountable for a violation of the WPR. Even if the president went beyond auth., he will not be accountable
Fisher: There was a recent constructive partisan debate on ISIS within the Senate
Donohue: When Congress does not pass an AUMF, it is not a failure of Congress. There should not be increased steps to go around congress.
Fisher: Bush asked for support not authority.
Marcus: In the Iraq War, the Bush admin. pushed the concept of self defense pretty far. Legal position is that they didn't need Congress
Marcus: A big issue is that Congress is never quick to take ownership of military action
Hodgkinson: The debate really comes from questioning the legality of the president authorizing force when there is a direct threat to the US
Donohue: The administration tried to use the AUMF resolutions to establish authority where there was none.
Fisher: U.N Charter does not allow the president to act inter-laterally.
Donohue: The founders were concerned about the same issues as we do today when creating the War Power Resolution
Donohue on the WPA: We do not want all the power to go to one branch. The founders were well aware that power needs to be constrained.
Marcus: War Powers Act has given vague and general boundaries to presidents and have restrained their actions. It can be improved &amp; tweaked
Murray: War Powers Act gives the president incentive to restrict acts of intensity to 60 to 90 days.
Hodgkinson: How much tension should there be? Do you at some point lose some ability to respond with troops?
Hodgkinson: It would be helpful if Congress could be more responsible and responsive for actual AUMFs. #NSLB_AUMF
FIsher: Sec. 2(A) of WPR, hard to say Framers intended this because the President should not be able to act on his own.  #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: Successive administrations have constitutionally objected to the WPR because it has undermined the CIC powers. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The WPR is a de facto authorization by Congress to commit U.S. troops. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The WPR doesn't and can't enlarge or restrict the Congress's or President's powers. #NSLB_AUMF
Hodgkinson: AUMF instills a healthy dialogue between branches. Although, the Pres will respond immediately to surprise attacks under WPR.
Donohue: Leaving the declaration of war to the Executive would be the very definition of tyranny. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: No one talks about declarations of war anymore. Is the declaration of war a term of the past? #NSLB_AUMF
Panel one is off to a great start. #NSLB_AUMF #historyofAUMF http://t.co/VymkYJAScc
Murray: AUMF is not always the equivalent of a declaration. Was originally used to limit war to the sea. #NSLB_AUMF
Hodgkinson: You don't want your military tactics to be in the media before they are utilized. #NSLB_AUMF
Hodgkinson: It shouldn't be hard to defend the Nation. #NSLB_AUMF
Fisher: Since then, the Framers decided that a single executive should not be allowed to decide whether the nation goes to war. #NSLB_AUMF
Fisher: John Jay in Federalist #4 discussed that single executives would go to war not for national interest, but for personal interest.
Marcus: Congress has the power to declare war without the President.
Donohue: Since the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, we have moved away from a declaration and more towards an AUMF. #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: It should be hard to go to war, this should require Congress to act. It should be easier to make peace than to go to war #NSLB_AUMF
Donohue: Make war v. declare war, James Madison proposed that the word be changed to declare war so Exec could repel an attack. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: Are the AUMFs equivalent to the declaration of war? #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The Constitution talks about Congress declaring war, why don't we do that anymore? Last declaration was WWII. Now we use AUMFs.
Marcus: We grew up thinking the Pres is the "King of War," but that's not accurate. Pres is CIC of the armed forces. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: Introducing Laura Donohue, Louis Fisher, Sandra Hodgkinson, and Shoon Murray as the panelists for panel one. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution gave LBJ and Nixon a blank check. #NSLB_AUMF
Marcus: The War Powers Resolution was the result of Congress's dissatisfaction with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, aka the "first" AUMF.
Daniel Marcus, moderator of Panel One, introduces the panel and the history of the AUMFs. #NSLB_AUMF
Rishikof: Encourages interested students to submit writings on any Nat'l Sec Law topic to the ABA for the upcoming writing competition.
Rishikof: "If you are guilty enough to be held, are you guilty enough to be a target?" #NSLB_AUMF
Rishikof: The AUMF is part of a larger national security issue. Should this be criminal v. military approach? Now it's a military approach.
Rishikof: We do not have clear public policy positions. We need to have some resolution for America, the law enforcement, and the military.
Rishikof: What is the appropriate relationship of the Congress to the Executive when the Executive projects force? #NSLB_AUMF
Rishikof: When you fight terrorism, it turns on info. We are moving from a prosecutorial paradigm to a prevention paradigm. #NSLB_AUMF #FBI
Rishikof: terrorism is a tactical problem. AUMF was unprecedented because we now declare war on non-states and persons. #NSLB_AUMF
Rishikof discussing domestic terrorism, development of int'l terrorism in the '90s, and the realization the world was changing #NSLB_AUMF
Mr. Rishikof is the current chairman of the advisory committee to the @ABA Standing Committee on Law and Nat'l Sec. #NSLB_AUMF

We had a great time at the #ABA national security law conference this week. This is from the cybersecurity panel. http://t.co/c802Tr1VIn
Did you know the ABA Cybersecurity legal task force passed two cybersecurity resolutions through the @ABAhod ABA House of Delegates? #ABA
Prof. Banks, speaking on the special advocate legislation. Advocate would have access to all relevant precedent and materials in FISC.
Professor William Banks, new legislation: The Freedom Act, would ban bulk collection. Applies to ANY use of section 215.
Snap from the heated debate among the panelists of panel three! #NSLB #ABA http://t.co/opX3s3dk3u
Jaffer, But when the gov't knows who you called and who you called called, this surveillance is intrusive. Jones should control this issue.
Litt, no one will deny we have to revisit constitutional doctrines with new technology and this is basic.
Robert Litt, GC of DNI, telephony metadata does not apply to the other records in another program (financial records, medical records).
Cont.: but this is a lot of info to have in gov't hands. Could include medical records, credit card records, etc.
Jameel Jaffer, ACLU, there is no restriction on the gov't collection of data. 4th Amendment isn't implicated.
Beginning of Panel three: the future of foreign intelligence. #NSLB #ABA
Under Secretary Spaulding stated that as att'ys do mergers and acquisitions, they must assess cybersecurity as a factor as well. #NSLB #ABA
Cont.: Working with the private sector to understand the consequences of cyber threats. Understanding is as important as pin pointing flaws.
Cont.: the private sector often has more information than the gov't on threats in the cyber arena. That's why communication is key.
Cont.: Increased security of gov't buildings after Ottowa attacks in fear of copy-cat attacks. Seek to protect the 1.4 million employees.
Honorable Suzanne E. Spaulding, under secretary DHS NPPD, speaking on critical infrastructure threats.
And that ends Panel two. Now time for lunch! Stay tuned for Panel three on the future on foreign intelligence.
A Judge McKeown: But we are weary of the confidentiality of our draft opinions when we read about breaches elsewhere.
A cont.: We haven't seen any cybersecurity breaches in courts yet but we are unsure.
A from Judge Bates: There are no security problems in FISC because the scifs are secure. But courts generally, we need to be vigilant.
Q from former CIA and NSA GC: cybersecurity in courts are not what it needs to be. What do you think?
Cont.: In FISC, generally courts believe an amicus method would be better than a special advocate method.
Cont.: Telephony metadata is collected and a query is run once there is an  reasonable articulable suspicion.
Cont.: For non-routine cases, FISA judges look at these like difficult cases in the district courts.
Honorable Bates: FISA judges come to DC for one week, do all the work (review applications) in the scif, then go back home.
Cont.: FISC and FISC-R judges are crafting opinions with thought in mind that one day may be released.
Honorable Bates on cameras in the court room: For Ct. App. cameras could work, D. Ct. is a little different because of juries.
Honorable McKeown commenting on segment of Jewel v. NSA argument becoming a part of the movie about the Snowden leaks. #transparencyincourt
RT @FBI: #Breaking: Operator of Silk Road 2.0 website arrested by #FBI #cyber agents in San Francisco. http://t.co/SVBI0w6hH5
Honorable Kavanaugh: "The constitution does not apply to non-citizens abroad." The Constitution does apply to non-citizens in the U.S.
"Deference is not abdication." - Honorable M. Margaret McKeown (9th Cir.).
Honorable Bates: "The courts are protectors of liberties." Speaking on the risk of too much deference. "The courts need to be vigorous."
One more correction: Honorable Kavanaugh is a D.C. Cir. Judge. This tweeter needs more coffee. #thanksforfollowing
A cont.: Deference given to ambiguous statutes even in nat'l sec realm. Special duties to clarity, consistency, and prudent restraint. #ABA
A: The courts have an important role and a similar role to every day cases: what does the Constitution and due process clause mean here?
Correction: Honorable Brett Kavanaugh (D.D.C.)
Honorable John D. Bates (D.D.C.): What is a judge's role in national security cases?
Beginning of Panel two: role of the judiciary in national security
And that's the end of Panel one! #NSLB #ABA http://t.co/SJUtBm6BeL
A: focusing on oversight as well as working and corresponding with the House and Senate intelligence committees.
Q: what is the Agency (and IC) doing to explain its activities to the American public?
*Disclaimer: Brigadier General Gross is present and speaking in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.
Brigadier General Gross stating good gov't lawyers lay out the legal risks, pros, and cons of choosing a specific theory or authority.
Brigadier General Gross speaking on the difficulty of finding authorities stating fiscal authorities are typically relied on.
Brigadier General Richard C. Gross, LC to chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, thanks those in academia for digesting complex legal issues.
Carlin speaking on the threat and consequences of ransomware and malware. #ABA #DOJNSD #cyberthreats

Special thanks to our amazing afternoon panelists, moderator, and symposium partner! @PILPG @ICRC @AU_SIS @AUILR #wclsyria
@PILPG's Tyler Thompson: Re #USA as a moral actor, yes. The US is still one of the few countries with the capacity to act
Q: If a country is potentially committing its own war crimes, should/can it take responsibility to intervene on others' war crimes?
RT @AUILR: Harrison: Different justifications may affect dialogue, but doesn't affect adminstration of aid as much as one would think.
Audience Q: Do the different justifications for use of force affect climate on the ground in terms of ability to bring aid? #wclsyria
RT @AUILR:Thompson of @PILPG says no: humanitarian intervention is symptom of #UN Security Council when it is sick
Andrea Harrison: Re: Legit reason? "One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist."
Andrea Harrison: Re: Legit reason? The narrowness of the @UN conventions is the direct reason for why legit reasons cannot be articulated.
Audience Q: What is a legitimate reason for military intervention in the realm of int'l law? Should a legit reason negate the illegality?
Andrea Harrison: Syria is very complex - fracturing of different rebel groups makes getting aid to refugees complicated #wclsyria @AUILR
.@PILPG's Tyler Thompson: The chem weapon 'deal' may have removed intervention for a while - legitimizes Assad in int'l view for now
Audience Q: Could there be renewed interest in intervention, or is it completely off the table at this point? #wclsyria #ILR #NSLB
RT @AUILR: Prof Bachman, @AU_SIS: Nuremberg: crime of aggression = crime of all crimes. #Syria could arguably constitute civil war #wclsyria
RT @AUILR: Panelists discuss chemical weapons and U.S. intervention #Syria #ChemicalWeapons #ILR #intervention http://t.co/FS7mEVYzBe
RT @AUILR: Difference is that #Syria has more actors + it's less clear what will happen, while #Libya had more unified opposition movements…
Andrea Harrison: Interesting that possible Syrian intervention premised on chem weapons, not  Responsibility to Protect #wclsyria @AUILR
.@PILPG's Tyler Thompson: Responsibility to Protect equally in Syria as Libya. Difference? Libya was politcally/int'l simpler #wclsyria
Andrea Harrison of @ICRC (personal views): How do you balance lives you're saving vs. lives @ risk from intervention? #wclsyria @AUILR
Is Responsibility to Protect more relevant to Syria than it was previously in Libya? #wclsyria @AUILR
.@PILPG's Tyler Thompson: Responsibility to Protect definitely a norm. Things to consider: issue of state sovereignty
.@auwcl Prof. Orentlicher: Responsibility to Protect has become a norm; although a legal grey zone. Still evolving #wclsyria @AUILR
Responsibility to protect: What does it mean when the @UN Sec. Council hasn't endorsed military intervention? #wclsyria @AUILR
Andrea Harrison: If a Humanitarian Corridor is established, what are the ramifications? This has never been done before. #wclsyria @AUILR
Andrea Harrison: If Humanitarian Intervention means providing aid, would intervention actually achieve this? #wclsyria @AUILR
RT @AUILR: Andrea Harrison of @ICRC on human rights and military intervention #ilr #wclsyria http://t.co/OivabuqDrt
Andrea Harrison of @ICRC (her views are her own): US has obligation to respect/adhere to Geneva Convention #wclsyria @AUILR
#USA credible threat via naval strike groups in Syrian region also catalyzed int'l action re: chem weapons #wclsyia @AUILR
RT @AUILR: @PILPG's Tyler Thompson: only after @UN Sec. Council failed to act did neighboring states start to intervene #wclsyria #Russia
RT @AUILR: 120k people dead in #Syria , more than 2k due to chem weapons. 6M out of population 22M displaced. #wclsyria @WCLNatlSecLaw
.@auwcl Prof. Orentlicher: 3) where gov't displacement occurs, @UN Security Council must be involved #wclsyria @AUILR
.@auwcl Prof. Orentlicher: 2) collective action via @UN General Assembly or Regional Authorization #wclsyria @AUILR
.@auwcl Prof. Orentlicher: 1) exhaust @UN security council options #wclsyria @AUILR
RT @AUILR: Prof. Orentlicher suggests 3 requirements to allow military intervention outside of @UN Sec. Council authorization #wclsyria

RT @steve_vladeck: Further to last, looks like @HouseIntelComm #NSA programs hearing now rescheduled for next Tues. (10/29); gov't panel @ …
Lederman: any case in which court would get to merits would be so narrowly tailored it wouldn't answer. Court came close over Cambodia.#NSLB
Audience Q: Would it be a good idea for courts to weigh in on whether Pres can act unilaterally and when. #WCLSyria
Lederman: Myth that 60/90 day limit is Unconstitutional. Administration is questioning the definition of 'hostilities'. #WPR #WCLSyria
Audience Q: Obama promised to comply with all statutes, why he strained to continue Libya action under WPR. View on this? #WCLSyria
@AUILR Lederman: Framers put up barriers for "Clogging rather than facilitating war". Want non-belligerent solutions. #NSLB 	#WCLSyria
Lederman: Pres. made the right move, despite Const. issues, by going to Congress knowing the House was unlikley to support. #WCLSyria
Lederman is worried about President acting unilaterally without International support and violate UN Charter. #WCLSyria #NSLB #treatybreach
Lederman is worried of the President's construction of the word "hostilities" in #Libya to avoid 90 day limit. #ILR #NSLB		#WCLSyria

RT @HRFLawSecurity: #Guantanamo Chief Prosecutor: Try al-Libi in federal court. http://t.co/G7kupE3pXJ via @carolrosenberg
@AUILR Lederman: #Libya and #Syria shows the US is the Chief Diplomat of the world. #SC @NATO #NSLB		#WCLSyria
Lederman: #Libya and #Syria does not fit into Truman's statement that US is the World's policeman. #WCLSyria #ILR http://t.co/FflwGCsZNr
Lederman: Framer's concerns 1) Afraid Pres would bring country into war for fame and fortune 2) Huge cost in blood and treasure.	#WCLSyria
This justification of unilateral action for less than full on wars is Lederman's "the Clinton/Obama third way". #WCLSyria #ILR #NSLB
Lederman: Exec branch from 70s to today, trying follow Rehnquist's Cambodia translation in a modern context. #WCLSyria #ILR
Lederman: Shorter duration wars #kosovo #Iraq the Pres. acted unilaterally, but OLC cited they were not wars like Const. defines.#WCLSyria
Lederman: Vietnam- Congress gave authorization for action, but the question was if that covered action in Cambodia. #WCLSyria #Rehnquist
Lederman: Changed in 1950 with Truman- Truman brought us into full-fledged war on his own. He wanted to start precedent. #Korea #WCLSyria
Lederman: Historical consensus was that President needed Congressional approval to engage in lethal force except when acting defensively.
Lederman: If President must go to Congress for unilateral action, there would be no humanitarian action overseas. #WCLSyria
Lederman: We are now talking about Justice Jackson's 3rd category in Youngstown. #WCLSyria #ILR #NSLB
Prof. Martin Lederman starts his keynote on the President's powers to act unilaterally. #Jackson #Zoneoftwilight	#WCLSyria
Dr. Fisher A: there is a good reason for Pres. to question using unilateral acts of war, the blame would be all on him. #ILR #NSLB #WCLSyria
Audience Q: standard of hostilities for when the Pres can intervene unilaterally?		#WCLSyria
@Auilr Daskal: Clarify, R2P is Intl. law doctrine used when gross massacre of the people of a country. #Kosovo		#WCLSyria #NSLB
Comstock A: bar has been set higher to convince American ppl since Afghan and Iraq, esp. if going to dedicate troops on the ground.#WCLSyria
Audience Q: Responsibility to Protect Doctrine. What are the criteria to justify to intervene under R2P? 	#WCLSyria #NSLB
Donesa: This is easier said than done.		#IlR #NSLB	#WCLSyria
Donesa A: Articulate the fact that it is a hard situation and must act in new ways. Be open in defining new activities. #NSLB #WCLSyria
Audience Q for Donesa: Syria is a bad fact pattern, how does US get over the fact that there will be these messy fact patterns? #WCLSyria
RT @AUILR: Donesa says he thinks War Powers Resolution will stay as it is as a statement of principle vs. an effective legal regime #WCLSyr…
Comstock: have and will continue to limit the Pres.'s war powers by appropriations restraints. 	@AUILR #NSLB	#WCLSyria
Comstock answers: there have been talks, but there is a fear of limiting Pres. ability to protect nat sec. #ILR #WCLSyria #NSLB
Audience Q: Dr. Fisher said WPR is a dishonest resolution. If there is a problem, why isn't there serious talk of pulling back WPR?#WCLSyria
Donesa-"Syria is one of the worst fact patterns I have seen in articulating a policy or legal interest in intervention" #WCLSyria #NSLB #ILR
@AUILR Dr. Fisher- Obama in Tues. night address said he was not for regime change, but clearly is trying with Assad. #WCLSyria
Dr. Fisher- "WPR sec. 8 is a fundamentally dishonest statute"- Senate had a strong bill and House had weak. Harm was done here. #WCLSyria
Donesa- If one of the analysis is is it a compeling natl interest, the intl community support seems to import into that analysis. #WCLSyria
Audience Question- Did lack of #UN and Intl support for use of force in #Syria effect Pres. Art. II decisions?
Daskal- clarify "rendition"- With al libi, he was initially detained under AUMF and brought to states to stand trial, not Gitmo.		#WCLSyria
Donesa answers- If go grab people in other countries, may go against their customary laws. President has constitutional auth.	#WCLSyria
Audience Q: Legal justification for capturing and holding al libi? 		#WCLSyria #ILR #NSLB
@AUILR Dr. Fisher would not want to remove pres. powers. Pres. definitely has Article 2 powers, but has gone beyond. #WCLSyria #NSLB
Audience Question for Dr. Fisher @ConPro- Remove all powers of raging war from exec. to leg. Why? Is that possible?  #ILR #WCLSyria
Donesa- if write broad authorization then may allow military intervention in places did not originally intend. #AUMF #ILR #WCLSyria
@auilr Donesa- in 2001 Congress' thought was to give as much authority to do what we needed to do after 9/11. #WCLSyria #NSLB
Daskal- Question: Once Congress decides force, how can or should Congress write the authorization to properly restrict power?	#WCLSyria #ILR
Donesa- Congress put in a position where it can say no when under clear WPR, but not here. Only can so no by appropriations restrictions.
Comstock answers- AUMF allows for targeted drone strikes against Al Qaeda, but difficult to make that argument for Syria. #WCLSyria
Dr. Fisher answers: President has always understood the difference between defensive and offensive. Syria/Libya purely offensive. #WCLSyria
@AUILR Daskal- Question: Any permissible Art 2 allowances for uses of force without Congress? #WCLSyria
NSLB/ILR panel talking about the legal justifications and ramifications for military intervention in Syria. #WCLSyria http://t.co/KK40z5OeLe
Dr. Fisher @ConPro- Court got to answer it late. #Hamdi DOJ asked if torture detainees- DOJ said no. Torture memos proved untrue.	#WCLSyria
Daskal- Q- Is there a strong arg to follow past practice?  #ILR #NSLB		#WCLSyria
@ConPro Dr. Fisher-bad idea for Obama on 2nd day to sign exec. order to close Gitmo. He should have known how strong the opp. was. #WCLSyria
Donesa- members do not want to let down national security and open up for an attack.  #WCLSyria #ILR
Donesa- Syria was hard for many members for the House because the House as a whole was not for military intervention. #ILR #NSLB #WCLSyria
"If it is war it is for Congress, it is not war because there is not likely US casualties" was OLC's reasoning- Fisher disagrees. #WCLSyria
Dr. Fisher @ConPro - senate resolution on Libya- passed in 43 seconds, there was no committee hearings or reports. #WCLSyria #ILR #NSLB
Donesa- "We will see what happens when Congress becomes the dog that catches the car"- Congress was asked late for their opinion #WCLSyria
Donesa- "Syria was just a bad fact pattern" when it came to deciding if there was a national security interest. #WCLSyria #ILR #NSLB
Donesa- legal analysis- OLC standard- Is pres. acting to protect a national security interest? @auwcl @AUILR #WCLSyria
Chris Donesa- Foreign Chief Counsel for House Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence says Issue #1 is "legal analysis light". #WCLSyria #ILR
@AUILR Comstock-  "WPR has a lot of vague definitions" and requirements- no actual ramifications for not following. #WCLSyria #NSLB
@AUILR Peter Comstock, Leg. Aide for Congressman Griffin- Discussion in House on WPR and AUMF first time it was remodified. #WCLSyria
Dr. Fisher @ConPro- "most of the Presidents who have run around Congress have hurt themselves and hurt their parties"  #ILR #NSLB #WCLSyria
@auilr Dr. Fisher- Clinton rightly used forces against Haiti, Iraq, Kosovo- never going to Congress #WCLsyria #NSLB
Dr. Fisher @ConPro, Truman promised that if he ever used force, he would come to Congress first- Created support for UN charter #WCLSyria
