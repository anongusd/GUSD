@Jeremy_Hunt I appreciate your efforts to help #Yemen to get out of its crisis but first you need to find a solution to stop the Iranian regime‚Äôs interference there.
@Jeremy_Hunt are you going to condemn Iranian regime‚Äôs aggressive role in region, and especially in #Yemen??
@Hayder_alKhoei #SaudiArabia spent billions of dollars to secure and build #Yemen, and that doesn‚Äôt include the money spent on fighting radical Houthis.

@KenRoth the #Saudi government is still investigating the case, no one forgot him, so relax and wait till they publish all facts publicly.
@DunyaNews this proves how strong the relationship between the two countries.	#Pakistan considers #saudiarabia as its truly ally in the Arab Gulf which empowers the Islamic countries to fight radical regimes as the Iranian.

@KenRoth of course I believe that because you &amp; your likes want the world to believe your lies and rumors.
@ForeignPolicy in fact, Houthis forces have been accused of stealing humanitarian aids &amp; medical supplies, plus they used to recruit children to fight in battlefield instead of them.
@sunnyjim4 @KenRoth how come they become dictators, in your point of view, while all saudis are respecting them!! that doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
@KenRoth your job is to defend human rights, not to attack governments, look at Iranian or Assad regimes!! they‚Äôre torturing their own people with no mercy and you stand there doing nothing.
@KenRoth you‚Äôll never agree with #SaudiArabia whatever they do, that shows how much you hate them and you‚Äôre taking it personally!!

@PressTV look how desperate you are now üòÑ my advice to you is to rethink about your relationship with terrorism.
@PressTV you mean Houthis‚Äô fire? of course they did launch that cowardly attack which proves you cannot keep your nose out of #Yemen
@PressTV does that scare you guys? declare peace and stop your funding for terrorism then may be @realDonaldTrump will forgive you.
@PressTV they could live peacefully if the regime has stopped its aggressive behaviors in the region and give the Iranians their freedom.
@TheEconomist #Iran must stop its dangerous activities or the world will suffer again!! peace is our dream and we can‚Äôt achieve it while the Iranian regime plays dirty.
@poddar_shashank @Chellaney do you have any proof that he ordered to kill Khashoggi? I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve none.
@Chellaney and your accusations are meaningless!! you totally ignored what Iranian regime‚Äôs actions in Middle East.

@TulsiPress who was targeting the children and the civilians in #Yemen are Houthis and the Iranian regime‚Äôs agents, they tried to take down the legitimate forces in order to control the country.
@TulsiPress which mean the US‚Äôs support was necessary at that time to save #Yemen and its ppl.
@TulsiPress the Yemeni legitimate government itself asked #SaudiArabia and others to help the country to stop the Houthis‚Äô attempts to invade #Yemen &gt;&gt;

@CharlieAngusNDP @cafreeland what‚Äôs the point to host a girl who claimed her family will kill her without knowing the truth about her escape??
@CharlieAngusNDP @cafreeland seeks to show the world that #Canada is home for all refugees but it failed to protect real refugees, the Syrians!!
@GerrySimpsonHRW @SecPompeo who told you that she‚Äôs being tortured there? I don‚Äôt remember any official claims that.
@CharlieAngusNDP death machines that you‚Äôre talking about are the ones used to protect Yemenis and to secure the stability there. 	if you‚Äôre underestimating #Canada efforts then you‚Äôre disgraceful to all Canadians.
@CharlieAngusNDP she‚Äôs issues with her family, so why did you involve #SaudiArabia in your tweet? her case and #Yemen war are two different things.
@NatashaFatah @rahaf84427714 @rahaf84427714 claims that her family threaten her to death, but we didn‚Äôt hear their side of the story. 	what‚Äôll Canada do if it discovers that she was lying the whole time!!
@NatashaFatah @rahaf84427714 #Canada tries to make itself the best place to host ppl in need while it turned its back on poor Syrians who were killed by #Assad regime.
@sam_vinograd @CNN who‚Äôs the murder here exactly üòÑ?
@CNN #Khashoggi death has been politicized by some countries who wish to destabilize #SaudiArabia internationally, but their agendas failed.
@CNN it‚Äôs normal to discuss the latest updates of any affair that concerns him, but for sure @SecPompeo is a professional man and won‚Äôt interfere in those cases.
@LotteLeicht1 if you mean the people responsible for #Khashoggi death, be sure that the #Saudi government is seeking to reveal the truth and hold the killers accountable for their crime.
@c_kennaugh @alfonslopeztena she wasn‚Äôt so clear about her condition, she accused her family of abusing her but no one heard their side of the story.
@alfonslopeztena second, those activists should be ashamed of themselves for using a young lady as their tool to create a show that serve their agendas, it‚Äôs a crime.
@alfonslopeztena first, she wasn‚Äôt trying to escape Saudi Arabia, she claimed that she ran away from her family which we didn‚Äôt hear the full story till now.
@NatashaFatah @Omaima don‚Äôt you see that you‚Äôre interfering in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs internal affairs?? some people are using the male guardianship as a subject to destabilize the society of #SaudiArabia

@JZarif @SecPompeo since Iranian regime started interfering in others‚Äô affairs, chaos happened, destabilization caused. 	don‚Äôt try to blame the United States of your regime‚Äôs behaviors are actions.
@JZarif @SecPompeo whenever/ wherever #Iran interferes, chaos, repression, and resentment follow &gt;&gt; it should be written in this way.
@SecPompeo the regime needs to be stopped and punished for its crimes against humanity, I cannot believe that the rest of the world still silent on Iranian regime‚Äôs actions.
@JZarif really? so you accuse others of harboring terrorists?? okey then the radical people that your regime‚Äôs harboring what do you call them?
@KarenAttiah investigation is not done yet, and the case is an internal one, there‚Äôs no third party here.
@KenRoth he was joking and the interpreter laughed, don‚Äôt try to change the subject here. 	your target is the male guardianship, there‚Äôre thousands of women live under this system and how many of them complained? only few without real cases.
@khamenei_ir you should be ashamed of yourself and your regime‚Äôs behaviors. just quit your operations and leave the world live peacefully.
@khamenei_ir look who‚Äôs talking about being reliable and trusted üòÑü§• you didn‚Äôt keep your promises in cutting your support for terrorism, or to stop the ballistic missiles tests.
@khamenei_ir you mean your defeat will be unprecedented!! if you really care about your country‚Äôs &amp; people‚Äôs future, you wouldn‚Äôt support terrorism and conflicts in region.
@khamenei_ir I don‚Äôt think your regime will endure those sanctions for a long time, Iranians deserve better than serving your radical regime.
@khamenei_ir your defensive capabilities are weak for sure, you cannot launch a direct war against your enemy, that‚Äôs why your regime depend on proxy wars.

@abcnews @monaeltahawy @LindaMottram you said that her father is a powerful man, so who‚Äôs he? your article doesn‚Äôt say anything about him at all.
@sploach @cnni #Thailand said they may return her to her family who lives in #Kuwait, no one mentioned #SaudiaArabia or MBS
@ishagshafeeg @cnni we don‚Äôt know the truth yet, but at the end they‚Äôre her family members and we need to help them to get together not to separate them.
@cnni they should do their part and make the family settle their differences together, try not to make the case go publicly because media may ruin their relationship.
@KenRoth she‚Äôll go back to #Kuwait, not #SaudiaArabia so don‚Äôt try to blame Saudi government for that because the #Saudi embassy will take a good care of her and start an investigation to reveal the truth of her claims.
@KenRoth Male Guardianship has nothing to do with her return home, according to #Thailand she has no right to enter the country or stay there.
@KenRoth no one can harm her as long as she reports that to the authority with evidence, otherwise I guess she lies.
@KenRoth he must be insane!  how dare him to ask help to rebuild #Syria where he keeps destroying the country and killing its people??
@TheRealRiese @cnni is that a joke? it‚Äôs not funny at all my dear üò™. 	you‚Äôll be surprised if you know what #Saudi women have.
@melissa_dinolfo @cnni nope, but the case here is some women don‚Äôt know about their current status which‚Äôs not fair at all, the new method will make sure that everyone will be fully aware of their owns.
@cnni I guess not all countries have reached the level of using technology to help people, saudis did a good job by developing their country.
@LotteLeicht1 #Saudi women have their rights and so happy about the reforms that they whiteness in their country.
@LotteLeicht1 Male Guardianship is something you‚Äôll never change it because it is exist in #islam. 	no one has came to you and complained about it.

@60Minutes #Egypt is one of the most countries that suffered from radical people and terrorist attacks that costed many live of innocents people, so please cut it off and be responsible.
@60Minutes did you just accuse president of #Egypt of committing a massacre? is that your thoughts about Arab countries? the stereotype that you have about #Arabs is totally wrong.
@KenRoth has been showered by #Qatari money, that‚Äôs why he accused @realDonaldTrump of being showered by money from #SaudiArabia 		pathetic response. https://t.co/kFTDyY6CQ7
@KenRoth @realDonaldTrump has no time for his own business, he WAS a businessman but now he IS the president of the United States. 	he has a lot of important things to deal with and you just accuse him because he‚Äôs not serving your agendas.
@KenRoth @60Minutes he just silenced those who supported the #MuslimBrotherhood in #Egypt. for me he did a good job because those radical people were planning to take the country to the bottom.
@KenRoth @60Minutes the interviewer was trying to make him get angry and pushing him to his limit by repeating the question like he‚Äôs hiding the truth. 	I do like the program but recently it started to serve its own agendas.
@trinityaryajoan @KenRoth she doesn‚Äôt need asylum, she can report to her country‚Äôs authority if she was telling the truth and they will help her.
@wheretonow2015 @KenRoth @jennineak why did she traveled to another country? if she was abused, she could report that easily in #Kuwait where her family lives.
@KenRoth she‚Äôs not abused by her family as they said, you don‚Äôt know the truth about her escape from her family. 	if she planned to go to #Australia, she wouldn‚Äôt go to #Thailand in the first place.
@PressTVPrograms #UN didn‚Äôt say that, it‚Äôs just some people who gave that statement because they know that #SaudiArabia isn‚Äôt involved in that murder but they want to blame Saudis.
@PressTVPrograms you created a video by using those who are against #SaudiArabia‚Äôs successful policies because the new #Saudi is not allowing your regime to carry on its radical actions.

@KenRoth you‚Äôre the expert here in closing the eyes for crimes like Iranian regime‚Äôs operations in #Yemen and other places. 	it‚Äôs a shame to be paid by #Qatar and accuse @realDonaldTrump for such a thing.

@MazMHussain that proves #SaudiArabia doesn‚Äôt have anything to hide, on #RiyadhSummit in 2017, it launched the Global Center for Combating Extremism Ideology in front of the whole world.
@KarenAttiah #SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt recruit them, so why should US punish Saudis for that?
@nytimes you‚Äôve reached your deepest level of disgusting, I can‚Äôt believe how much you‚Äôve become pathetic to spread lies in your newspaper!!
@NYTimesAtWar #Sudan‚Äôs policy to join the army is so clear, so if you‚Äôve any problem talk to Sudanese president, don‚Äôt blame the coalition.

@HelenClarkNZ #Sudan is responsible for the safety of its soldiers whether they are young or adults, and if they signed to join the army voluntarily, then we can‚Äôt do anything about it.

@SenWarren that‚Äôs your lifetime problem, you believe every single report you see on media that supports your opinions instead of trusting your government.

@SandraH26502320 @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm following every updates but don‚Äôt forget that your administration has denied any involvement of #Saudi government in #Khashoggi death, which‚Äôs the same administration that heard those audio tapes.
@gratifymenow @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump of course we aren‚Äôt stupid and know how this world works, that‚Äôs why you need to see the picture from another angle, see who‚Äôll gain from ruin the relationship between US &amp; #Saudis
@gratifymenow @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump Iranian regime has kidnapped some American diplomats in US embassy for more than 400 days, does that mean US administration,back then, was cooperating with the terrorists?
@NNABResearch @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump I wasn‚Äôt asking for your opinion my dear, it‚Äôs up to you if you want to believe it or to prove the opposite.
@dremy2 @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is a billionaire who doesn‚Äôt need more money or to be controlled like an idiot, so basically your argument isn‚Äôt as good as you think.

@KarenAttiah @washingtonpost no he meant the #SaudiArabia that rebuilding countries, supporting others, and do whatever it takes to bring stability to the region.
@AJENews #Saudi Arabia will do its duties toward its neighbors, but the question is: will #Qatar do the same and invest its money to rebuild #Syria instead of funding terrorism??
@zaidbenjamin media likes to talk about #SaudiArabia even if they brought up old stories that aren‚Äôt relevant to current situations.
@Rikunda @realDonaldTrump #Iran did and US intelligence has evidence proves that those terrorists were trained &amp; funded by Iranian regime.
@babacar14 @realDonaldTrump so don‚Äôt mix everything up, if #Saudis will help to rebuild #Syria, they‚Äôve the right to ask the international community to remove #Assad regime from the power.
@babacar14 @realDonaldTrump CIA report has concluded that #SaudiArabia wasn‚Äôt involved in that tragedy case of #Khashoggi, some #Saudi individuals did that and now they‚Äôre being investigated by the government itself.
@ERVicSli @realDonaldTrump it‚Äôs not about how many dead journalists it costed, it‚Äôs about seeing #Assad regime still controls the country and that won‚Äôt help to end the civil war in #Syria
@realDonaldTrump necessary money doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll rebuild #Syria by itself alone, but #SaudiArabia has announced that it won‚Äôt do anything as long as #Assad regime still in charge.
@realDonaldTrump did he talk to #Saudis first or he just decided that and tweeted about it without consulting anyone as usual?
@CREWcrew @realDonaldTrump is a businessman and #SaudiArabia is investing in new fields so don‚Äôt be super surprised if they‚Äôd some business together.
@CREWcrew are you trying to make it related to what happened?? come on guys we‚Äôre living in a small planet and it‚Äôs so normal to happen.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @realDonaldTrump you should be a shamed of yourself if your regime is still funding #Hezbollah, #ISIS, and #Taliban.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @realDonaldTrump really? at least he‚Äôs fixing things, unlike your regime who cannot live one single day without killing innocents or starting new conflicts.
@RepLloydDoggett #SaudiArabia allows is people to express their opinions and thoughts, but your target is those traitors who betrayed their country, they‚Äôre not activists at all.
@gregpmiller @smekhennet your source cannot be trusted my friend, @washingtonpost has made it clear that they‚Äôre taking the case personally and they‚Äôll do whatever it takes to blame #SaudiArabia, and if that meant to publish lies.
@frontlinepbs conflicts in Middle East have caused by Iranian regime‚Äôs aggressive policies which are pose real threat to our security.
@Doranimated @davereaboi that‚Äôs right, but they‚Äôll fail and won‚Äôt be able to achieve that whatsoever. 	#qatar has been the partner of Iranian regime in destabilizing the region and US should stop them before it‚Äôs too late.
@m3takl_en we didn‚Äôt hear such a thing about that, so your information isn‚Äôt true, and your purpose is to shake the #Saudi society!!
@netanyahu you murder Palestinians, including children and women, in cold blood without thinking about their families and loved ones.
RT @AshhabDavid: @KenRoth You mean @washingtonpost covering up. He wasn‚Äôt even a writer. He was activist managed by executive member in Qat‚Ä¶
@KenRoth what‚Äôs your point? you published an old photo from 2017, and of course he‚Äôd be smiling because of @realDonaldTrump visit.  	so please stop your pathetic meaningless attempts to politicize the case.
@StateDeputySPOX @SecPompeo @ditmirbushati when the world will recognize #Iran‚Äôs danger and threats?? we should NOT allow the regime to carry on their operations.
@JerryMoran you didn‚Äôt make your mind about Iranian regime‚Äôs roles in #Syria, #Iraq, and #Yemen, so why are you people so upset when @realDonaldTrump gave up!! you didn‚Äôt help him at all.
@NickKristof how do you want him to tell you where the body is and he doesn‚Äôt know the answer too!! he isn‚Äôt interfering in the investigation, and once it‚Äôs over you‚Äôll know your answer.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost at the same time it shows that #Khashoggi was writing his articles by orders &amp; instructions from #Qatar, which proves that he‚Äôs their doll.
@naveensanders1 @KenRoth is it really matter what he meant? he‚Äôs a liar who used his position for his own interests not to help human rights field.
@KenRoth do you really believe what @washingtonpost wrote? they‚Äôre being paid and attacking #SaudiArabia with everything it has.
@KenRoth is your investigation better than the CIA? what‚Äôs your evidence or your sources?? you‚Äôve none.
@KenRoth and your point is? it seems that you‚Äôre calling for protests, which‚Äôs the opposite of your duties.
@ezralevant that proves how hypocritical she is!!	#Canada must treat everyone equally, but its foreign minister has shown us that Canadians don‚Äôt matter.
@rulajebreal you can stop lying now, everything was exposed and it appeared that #Khashoggi was a doll in #Qatar‚Äôs hands and he was writing whatever they wanted which made him an agent.
@UN can we finally see #Yemen in peace and Houthis stop their aggression? can #UNSC prevent #Iran from ruining the ceasefire agreement?
@AJENews is #Qatar gonna do something to ruin the ceasefire agreement!! who knows ü§î.
@UN_Spokesperson I hope Houthis accept the agreement and let #Yemen alone, the people had suffered a lot and almost lost their home.
@foreignoffice @Jeremy_Hunt we shouldn‚Äôt have made it easy for radical militants to move freely in region and destroy our legacy. 	now it‚Äôs the time for payback and returning our peace.
@foreignoffice @Jeremy_Hunt the main reason for destruction in #Yemen is because we let Iranian regime to do whatever they want without consequences, now yemenis are suffering from our selfish decision.
@theIRC @Independent Democrats &amp; Republicans don‚Äôt realize how dangerous their decision is, they want to save money but they didn‚Äôt think for the long term.
@theIRC @Independent their move will help radical people to extend their operations in #Yemen, #Saudi-led coalition will fight alone to protect Yemenis.
@jeremycorbyn ooh you‚Äôre supporting him because his father was a member of Iranian regime!! so that‚Äôs why you remember his birthday because the regime gave you instructions and asked you to talk about it publicly.
@jeremycorbyn peacefully protest? isn‚Äôt it the same protest that was almost caused instability and disorder!!	btw, he‚Äôs the son of a terrorist saudi man who‚Äôs supporting Iranian regime.
@SenSanders and US should be doing everything it can to ensure that #Iran is no longer a threat to our future!!
@KarenAttiah and your big mouth deserve to be silenced, we don‚Äôt wanna hear your meaningless shit.
@naderalihashemi @sarahleah1 @MadawiDr @abdu @Shanfaraa @KarenAttiah @NickKristof #Saudis have discovered a lot of traitors and enemies inside its territory so it‚Äôs normal to secure your country by eliminating those ppl.
@Reuters it‚Äôs necessary and that decision proves that #SaudiArabia is correcting its policies and closing every gaps in its procedures.
@AnnaYearley @Reprieve I guess you guys blinded your eyes of #Iran‚Äôs activities that led to executing hundreds of innocents people.
@AJEnglish it‚Äôs part of the reforms that Qatar didn‚Äôt do the same, it‚Äôs not related to any case so you can stop lying to the people.
@tedlieu @POTUS what about using military force against #Iran? are you against that too? you need to take an action against that terrorist regime of #Iran as soon as possible.
@RoKhanna no it‚Äôs not good while Iranian regime and Hezbollah still remain there funding radical groups and terrorists.
@RepLloydDoggett so you guys insist to interfere in others‚Äô internal &amp; regional affairs? if you refuse to stop Iranian regime‚Äôs and #Qatar‚Äôs aggressive policies, then don‚Äôt stuck your nose.
@Jeremy_Hunt the world seeks to stop the civil conflict of #Yemen and bring peace back, but Houthis‚Äô latest actions are leading the country to face a deeper level of disaster.
@AP violence and aggression made by Houthis have led #Yemen to face the biggest humanitarian crisis in history, we need to stop those radical behaviors to restore peace there.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump so you realize how dangerous the Iranian regime is, but weeks ago you called for stopping your support for #Saudi-led coalition that‚Äôs fighting Iran-backed Houthis!! how hypocrite you are.
@LindseyGrahamSC #ISIS will NOT be defeated as long as Iranian regime still in power and carrying out their terrorist activities in region.
@KenRoth the only thing you care about is filling your pocket with Qatar money, so I advise you to stop it and be reasonable with facts.
@KenRoth that‚Äôs your goal, to save those traitors who served your agendas üòè you‚Äôve lost your credibility and people‚Äôs faith in you.
@m3takl_en they deserve much more if they‚Äôre contacting foreign organizations to harm #Saudi society and its people. 	coming days will show us their true identity and whose their clients.
@ForeignAffairs the murder of #Khashoggi has exposed the enemies of #SaudiArabia and shows how cowardly they are.
@SenatorDurbin do you realize that Iran-backed Houthis almost destroy #Yemen‚Äôs future and killed the ppl‚Äôs hope of having peaceful dreams?	who‚Äôll make it up for them??	#Saudi Arabia has did its role by helping Yemenis but what‚Äôs yours?
@SenatorHassan are you gonna send a message to #Iran also? or you like its regional policies that caused chaos??
@NickKristof @WSJ and should we believe every report we read? are we idiots or what!! journalists and news agencies are using us as their tools to reach their agendas.
@LizSly @margheritamvs @summer_said it‚Äôs a lie, it‚Äôs so obvious my dear!	she‚Äôs still under investigation and there‚Äôs no leaks about the results of hers, so how could some fool people think that we can believe them so easily???
@nytimes it‚Äôs the Houthis‚Äô doing, not saudis!!	Houthis have forced the ppl to run into the sea to survive but I guess most of them didn‚Äôt make it.
@thehill Haley is about to destroy her future &amp; career by taking Qatari money and becoming their doll to get some attention.
@hisham_melhem they don‚Äôt have to, eventually Senate will realize their mistakes and regret every decision they made. 	you‚Äôll see that later.
@KenRoth so obvious the outrage you mentioned has nothing to do with it, in fact, Houthis started losing the battle because of #Iran‚Äôs sanctions.
@KenRoth #SaudiArabia was trying to reach an agreement to end the civil conflict of #Yemen for years, but Houthis were the ones who ruined those efforts.
@AhmadAlgohbary @imobarcelona why didn‚Äôt you ask your friends in #Iran? I thought you‚Äôre good friends and take care of each other.
@PressTV who‚Äôre supported by #Iran regime, Houthis are targeting more people than they did before in order to ruin the latest agreement.
@PressTV she resigned from her job to have another one with anti-Saudi parties that can get her a lot of money üí∞.
@PressTVPrograms @PressTV you won‚Äôt reach or harm the #Saudi Crown Prince whatever you do or say, so keep your mouth shut and try to help your people‚Äôs future.
@PressTV so #Iran hosted a conference and argued for a ceasefire in #Yemen!!! the regime needs to stop its interfering there and cut its support for Houthis.
@PressTV a secret visit? how does it come a secret if you guys still talking about it? Qataris are the ones who‚Äôs ties with #Israel, not #SaudiArabia
@hrw #Saudi women have their full rights and no one has asked you guys to stand up for them, so please stop interfering in things that are not of your business.
@RepRoKhanna @WhipHoyer @SpeakerRyan this resolution shows how much you don‚Äôt care about Yemenis or the safety of Middle East. 	it‚Äôs shame to use your position for your own agendas, not the world‚Äôs.
@RepRoKhanna #SaudiArabia will stand up for its values as well, if others try to harm #Saudi Arabia by way or another, it‚Äôll pay back with a great harm.
@JZarif your regime should stop its aggressive behaviors if you want to live peacefully with others.
@JZarif ooh so yours are defensive ones??	your regime is threatening Israel and US, and you upset because you‚Äôre been sanctioned?? you deserve it my friend.
@hisham_melhem MBS is a reformer. 	what‚Äôre you going to do now?
@Reuters it‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs why #Canada should think million times before taking any action or move toward its relationship with #SaudiArabia
@AnandWrites @chicagoideas this shows that you‚Äôve no idea of what #Saudi Arabia is doing for #Yemen and its people, you need to calm down and open your eyes and see the truth.
@BaFana3 I agree, Houthis have no choice except to fight because they won‚Äôt accept the ceasefire and because they don‚Äôt wanna see peace in #Yemen
@aveeksen @HussainBukhaiti Houthis won‚Äôt stop targeting innocents people there, so that‚Äôs why I encourage the coalition to destroy Houthis‚Äô supplies of weapons.
RT @Layla012066: @_Malik550 @JZarif @DohaForum Yes, America is responsible because it enabled the Iranian militias to rule Iraq, Syria and‚Ä¶
@AJEnglish we can allow the regime to do whatever they want without holding accountable for their violence policies, the international community will support #Iraq if they got affected by the sanctions.
@ReutersIran okey where‚Äôre those human rights activists now? aren‚Äôt they going to do the same as they did with #KhashoggiMurder? or because it‚Äôs #Iran not #SaudiArabia !!
@JZarif @DohaForum your tweet proves that you definitely don‚Äôt care about those ordinary citizens of #Iran, how disgusting!!
@JZarif @DohaForum it‚Äôs funny to hear that from a radical regime‚Äôs official, so now US is the one who sows violence and chaos in region, not #Iran.
@jricole is it wrong to protect your sovereignty and society? I‚Äôm sure no country will be satisfied if others interfere in its internal affairs.
@NickKristof it did that because you‚Äôre telling lies about what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen and the real truth about who‚Äôs starving them.
@RWPUSA it did mean ‚Äúinterfering in its internal affairs like #Khashoggi death‚Äù which is not senators‚Äô business to call for sanctions because of that case.
@KarenAttiah @washingtonpost oh reformers? I guess they‚Äôre serving your agendas but now they‚Äôre not available to help you anymore.
#Khashoggi was and still a #Saudi citizen, and those who tries to convert the case as he‚Äôs an American journalist will get nothing. https://t.co/hwuiMBbfWN
@CNN because it none of their business, it‚Äôs a #Saudi internal affair and they should respect #Saudi ‚Äòs sovereignty.
@Reuters does #Canada want to withdraw from arms deal with #SaudiArabia because it believes some rumors and lies??
@Reuters some senators will harm US‚Äôs relationships with others, including their historical ally -#Saudi Arabia-.
@CharlotteEAllan #Saudi government knows better than anyone else, and your friend was fooled all of us and than including me.
@PressTV so funny üòÜ to work with #Iran and do what exactly? threaten the world‚Äôs security? please be reasonable whenever you tweet later.
@CNBC didn‚Äôt he say that he has everything? then why didn‚Äôt he share the evidence with #SaudiArabia ?? why #Turkey insist on hiding the information it has and leaks it?
@KenRoth @NickKristof Houthis are the ones who kill and stave Yemenis so don‚Äôt lie about it again. 	activists are doing their jobs normally, but if you mean those traitors they‚Äôll hold accountable for their crimes.
@margheritamvs you‚Äôve to admit that #Saudi Arabia is changing now and joining the modern world. 	#SaudiArabia will be number one for tourism in future.
@KenRoth you can‚Äôt live your daily life without mention #SaudiArabia üòÇ you‚Äôre really pathetic mr. Roth.
@AJENews this‚Äôs how you spending your money and investments, not like #Qatar and its way of funding terrorists.
@MARYAMALKHAWAJA @davidguetta what‚Äôs your problem? those defenders you mentioned were using human rights field to cover their agendas but they were exposed after all.
@GerrySimpsonHRW did you forget that Iranian regime is providing weapons to Houthis who do target innocents people in #Yemen ?
@ForeignAffairs then #Iran will do its best to make this agreement fail to do damages to the two countries‚Äô relationships.
@jricole yeah why not? #Saudis have high potentials in new experiences and that will help them to take #saudiarabia to new level of educational activities.
@BuzzFeedBen @JZarif he thinks he can avoid sanctions against his regime but that won‚Äôt last long, at the end he‚Äôll regret his regime‚Äôs roles in funding terrorism and Iranians will be the real victims.
@HillelNeuer he‚Äôs not the only one, there‚Äôre hundreds of Iranians who‚Äôre punished because they tried to express their opinions.
@hisham_melhem @NickKristof which people did he asked? #Saudis are standing together for their country &amp; government so you guys won‚Äôt be able to harm the Saudi society whatever you do.
@BetoORourke did he truly told you that literally or it‚Äôs just your thoughts? because @realDonaldTrump won‚Äôt ignore such a thing if it was real.
@KenRoth #Saudi Crown Prince was the man who helped to reach that ceasefire, so don‚Äôt act like he did nothing.
@BernieSanders choose your words wisely because now you‚Äôre treating #SaudiArabia as an enemy instead of directing your efforts to stop Iranian regime.
@RandPaul @Shawna @vicenews US once invaded #Iraq and killed thousands of people there, their purpose was to destroy the WMD, but their real target was to steal their oils.
@emilyctamkin #Iran needs to be stopped as soon as possible before they extend their influence and threats to harm us.
@RoKhanna so you‚Äôre talking about money now? didn‚Äôt Qataris gave you what were you looking? 		#Yemen civil war will end soon and then you‚Äôll be out of new topics to talk about #SaudiArabia.
@margotwallstrom we hope to see Houthis take on their roles very serious and withdraw from Yemeni sites.
he ignored #Iran‚Äôs role in #Yemen like the regime is NOT supporting militants there which costed us more than we ever imagined. https://t.co/Z7ImzO4Anc
@SenSanders if you vote to withdraw US support food #Yemen, you‚Äôll give Iran-backed Houthis the power they need to continue their radical operations.
@JZarif @SecPompeo save your energy and stop your regime‚Äôs activities immediately, your nuclear programs are dangerous and risky. 		so tell your regime‚Äôs head @khamenei_ir to withdraw his radical forces and leave the people to live peacefully.
@cafreeland what about journalists who are in jails in #Turkey? don‚Äôt they have their rights too?	don‚Äôt they deserve your attention too?
@SecPompeo raising concerns isn‚Äôt enough to secure our future, you need to act immediately and stop this regime for once and all.
@SecPompeo that‚Äôs why the great powers must stop the Iranian regime as soon as possible before they succeed in launching nuclear ballistic missiles that will threaten our safety for the rest of our lives.
RT @SecPompeo: #Iran‚Äôs regime has exploited the goodwill of nations and defied multiple #UNSC Resolutions in pursuit of a ballistic missile‚Ä¶
@ChrisMurphyCT is that what concerns you!!! you‚Äôre a pathetic person to be honest. you didn‚Äôt even think of a way to protect Yemenis from Iranian regime‚Äôs interfered which caused them almost their future.
@ChrisMurphyCT you‚Äôre seeing the picture from the wrong side, Houthis target and kill innocents women and children in cold blood and no one from international community tries to stop their violence.
@khamenei_ir your regime‚Äôs aggression has led the region into a dark future but when @realDonaldTrump becomes the peace defender, your regime won‚Äôt last much longer.
@khamenei_ir you‚Äôve no right to talk in behalf of Muslims while you slaying Yemenis, Syrians and others!! you‚Äôre the head of the biggest state sponsor for terrorism.
@khamenei_ir make it easy for Yemenis and pull out your forces in order to return the country to its legacy. 	Iranian regime has caused so much harm to #Yemen and they‚Äôve suffered enough.
@khamenei_ir it‚Äôs not their crimes, it‚Äôs yours actually so don‚Äôt act like an innocent person and condemn what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen because your regime is standing behind it.
@khamenei_ir you‚Äôre the real criminal here, you‚Äôre the mastermind of all destructions and chaos happened in Middle East.
@khamenei_ir you mean that your regime hasn‚Äôt done anything to harm #Yemen‚Äôs society?? stop lying plz. 	don‚Äôt accuse others for your regime‚Äôs actions!! you supported terrorists to start that civil conflict which caused the tragedy we live now.
@JZarif your regime caused all damages we see now in #Yemen by supporting the terrorists there and providing weapons to them to harm the civilians.
@JZarif withdraw your troops and support from #Yemen first, then praise the UNSC envoy‚Äôs efforts as much as you want.
@khamenei_ir look who‚Äôs talking about racial discrimination!! your regime is killing Muslims and Jewish because they‚Äôre not Shiite as you.
@Ana3rabeya @SarahAziza1 @washingtonpost trust me Saudis have woken and realized who‚Äôre their friends and their enemies, they won‚Äôt be fooled again by some so-called activists who seek to destroy the #Saudi society.
@SarahAziza1 @washingtonpost did you follow up the statements made by #Saudi authorities? of course not and it‚Äôs obvious that either you missed everything or just ignored the facts.
@AJEnglish I won‚Äôt ask about women‚Äô rights in Qatar, but what about Qataris‚Äô rights? do they have the freedom to express their opinions or they‚Äôll be beaten and jailed like the rest?
@thehill they can do whatever they want but eventually they‚Äôll recognize their mistake and we hope they‚Äôll admit it too.
@washingtonpost they‚Äôll fail because their claims are weak. 	their plan aims to harm their interests with their allies, to create instability in home.
@SusannaWhitman @SenBlumenthal don‚Äôt thank him, he isn‚Äôt even care for Yemenis or the stability in Middle East, all he cares about is his ties with Qatar who fills his pocket with money.
@SenBlumenthal @SenJackReed you‚Äôre gonna cause more damages to Middle East‚Äôs security because of your selfishness. 	you‚Äôve to stop the Iranian regime first before taking any move to pull your support.
@JZarif first stop funding terrorism then call for a dialogue that you mentioned. 		how comes that a terrorist state is calling for ‚Äúinternational law‚Äôs respect‚Äù !!!??
@JZarif your regime doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù or ‚Äúrespect for international law‚Äù mean, so cut your crap out and leave the world to live peacefully.
@hisham_melhem you‚Äôre focusing on #KhashoggiMurder alone because that serves your agendas to destabilize the region, which‚Äôs in fact Iranian regime‚Äôs plan.

@krassenstein ‚ÄúFree Pass‚Äù? who told you that #SaudiArabia has forgiven the ones who killed #Khashoggi? the government is still investigating the case in order to reach the full truth.
@ChrisMurphyCT you‚Äôll repeat your mistakes by giving the Iranian regime the power they need to extend their influence in #Yemen.
@ChrisMurphyCT what about Iranian regime‚Äôs roles in #Yemen? they‚Äôre destroying the country and killing its ppl!!
@CNNOpinion @ChrisMurphyCT that‚Äôs a lie, the coalition is not targeting innocents on purpose, they‚Äôre victims of Houthis‚Äô operations in #Yemen.
@Ahmadinejad1956 stop being hypocritical person because when you were a president you helped to create the destruction we see now.
@Ahmadinejad1956 it‚Äôs weird that you‚Äôre the one who wants to see peace and stability in our world and future!!! did you forget that your regime‚Äôs is the one responsible for damages and misery that some ppl have suffered from??
@washingtonpost @IgnatiusPost you still talking about this cyberwar shit!! when you guys start telling the truth and be professionals?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump you‚Äôre not paying for anything, in fact #SaudiArabia tries to get rid of Iranian regime and prevent its influence to extend abroad, so you need to be grateful for Saudis.
@RandPaul the destruction in #Yemen wasn‚Äôt made by #Saudi -led coalition and you know that already. you‚Äôre trying to weaken #SaudiArabia in order to achieve the enemy‚Äôs goals.
@JZarif the regime of #Iran is the main place to export terrorists and fund them to do their radical operations. 	Iranian regime must hold accountable for its violence policies.
@ChrisMurphyCT yeah I agree with you that you allowed that to happen because of your soft actions toward #Iran and #Hezbollah.
@SenBlumenthal what a nonsense!! because your president has hotels and business doesn‚Äôt that mean no official is allowed to book or use those services.
@SenMarkey first, he‚Äôs already told the world that he doesn‚Äôt consider himself as a reformer. 		second, where‚Äôs your manners?
@ChrisMurphyCT it is not, but you guys are trying to make the ppl believe that in order to get your goals done.
@LindseyGrahamSC mr. Graham, do you really think you can protect your security by ruin your ties with your strategic ally? you‚Äôve #Iran as an enemy in the Middle East so its better to keep your allies close to you.
@oamaz7 @LindseyGrahamSC you‚Äôre pathetic dude!! you sold your country for money and fame!! is that your goal in life??
@SenSanders so why did you say that the coalition is causing deaths among the civilians there!!
@SenSanders why #Saudi-led coalition has entered #Yemen in the first place?? that‚Äôs because it received a request from the legitimate government of #Yemen + they‚Äôre fighting Houthis back to save Yemenis.
@TFASorg @RandPaul @jqasociety @CatoFP @RandPaul is a guy who doesn‚Äôt care about US interests or how to secure our safety, he‚Äôs the kind of people who backs up to who pay more.
@thehill @RandPaul @HillTVLive you read it in the media!! how come a classified report issued by CIA was spread all over the media!! who‚Äôs the responsible for leaking this classified information?
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA stop impressing US‚Äôs values, do you really have manners? does your tweet reflect the US‚Äôs behaviors?? is that a good idea to mention an official account of another country and accuse them of lying??
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA dear mr. idiot senator, can you please stop acting silly and impress yourself!! your opinions and tweets are making you look untrusting guy.
@LindseyGrahamSC I guess he started to realize the situation after he heard the briefing from Director of the CIA that concluded #Saudi crown prince has nothing to do with #Khashoggi death as media claimed.
@LindseyGrahamSC I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve realized that #SaudiArabia has many enemies and that includes some senators who were paid to blame your strategic ally for every move.
@RandPaul they invited some members of senators and you all know about it, so why did you try to attend the briefing even though you‚Äôre not invited??
@RandPaul did they select you? if not I‚Äôm glad they ignored you because you don‚Äôt deserve to be a Senator in the Congress.
@OutFrontCNN a change in their leadership?? what does that means? your agendas have become more clear and obvious!!
@AhmadAlgohbary your source cannot be trusted at all. it‚Äôs normal to see Houthis targeting civilians and blame #saudiarabia for it.
@trtworld does he want to file a lawsuit against another party because they exposed his plans? he was planning to create an army aiming to attack his country (#SaudiArabia).
@RT_Erdogan your economy is collapsing and you‚Äôre not helping it for your ppl sake. 	you should work hard and give the ppl their freedom to vote and cheer for whoever they want with suppress them.
@LindseyGrahamSC GIVE to GET, it‚Äôs a simple principle to deal with others so when you call for stopping the support of #Saudi-led coalition then you can‚Äôt ask #SaudiArabia for anything you want.
@LindseyGrahamSC @WSJopinion but the Congress is so soft when it comes to Iranian regime‚Äôs actions!! this‚Äôs the truth that you cannot denied.
@SecPompeo #Iran poses a real danger to world‚Äôs security which won‚Äôt leave us living our lives freely and peacefully.
@KenRoth in other words, you‚Äôll try to harm #Saudi Crown Prince #MBS until you get your goals done!!!!! is that your plan?
@stevenmnuchin1 I hope your sanctions include #Hezbollah and Houthis organizations that are being funded by Iranian regime.
@chiliflake1 @KarenAttiah and your proof is...? don‚Äôt be silly and let media guide you as they want.
@RandPaul your emotional feelings should NOT be part of your job, you hate #SaudiArabia we got it but that doesn‚Äôt allow you to spread your hate in order to achieve enemy‚Äôs agendas.

@JZarif when will you admit your regime‚Äôs violence and aggressive policies!!! #Iran‚Äôs foreign policies are driving it to the bottom, and that includes the future of Iranian people.
@JZarif so US is violating international laws??? is that a joke? then your regime is violating all international and local laws &amp; norms. 	your pathetic claims are truly false and misleading.
@JZarif your regime is supporting Houthis in #Yemen, #Hezbollah in #Lebanon, and Assad regime in #Syria. so tell me who‚Äôs really causing chaos in Middle East!!
@JZarif by providing weapons and money to Houthis, #Iran remains the main cause of deaths and misery we see in Middle East nowdays.
@JZarif and your regime is the mastermind of all those tragedies in #Syria and #Yemen. 	#Iran has been providing more supplies and equipments for Houthis to keep the civil war active till this day.

@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost did #SaudiArabia kill #Khashoggi by using US made weapons?? of course not, in fact Saudi government isn‚Äôt involved in that murder but it punished whoever was involved.
@DailySabah do you have clear evidence or this‚Äôs another report published in order to give your case more attention!!
@business @EliLake @bopinion I really don‚Äôt know why they linked #Khashoggi death to ending the support of #Saudi-led coalition!! this move serves the enemy of peace.
@AJENews even if she did that and talk about #Khashoggi case &amp; #Yemen, she will do nothing because she believes in #SaudiArabia and trust them.
@JZarif instead of talking about #Yemen, try to stop wasting your money on terrorism and use it to develop your economy which will be in iranians‚Äô benefits in the end.
@JZarif whatever you say or do won‚Äôt change the fact that #Iran is a terrorist state and trying to destroy every hope for #Yemen, but guess what: ppl of Yemen won‚Äôt surrendering to your regime so easily.
@JZarif your real plan is to take control of #Yemen which allows your regime to extend its influence in Middle East, but I guess #Saudi-led coalition has ruined everything you planned.
@miss9afi your account violated #twitter‚Äôs law, not Pakistani one only.	yours should be suspended for a long time.

@SenWarren it‚Äôs not too late to stop Houthis militants from attacking innocents in #Yemen, you can call for stopping them and cut every source of help they get from #Iran
@SenWarren my question is: what‚Äôs your next move toward #Iran? are you going to limit their influence in #Yemen?

@SamanthaJPower @ChrisMurphyCT they don‚Äôt target civilians on purpose, in fact the terrorists are using them as shields which you and @ChrisMurphyCT already know.  	so we need to eliminate the threat first, which is Houthis forces if we want to bring peace back to #Yemen.
@SamanthaJPower which lead us to the importance of fighting the Iranian regime, the same enemy of international peace.
@CNNSitRoom @RandPaul so basically he doesn‚Äôt know if #Saudi Crown Prince is involved in #Khashoggi murder or not, then why does he insist every time that #MBS was ordered to kill the journalist??
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA show some respect if you wanted to be respected, it‚Äôs so simple but you used to accuse others for nonsense reasons and demanding impossible outcomes!!
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA you‚Äôre talking to the #Saudi embassy like it lied to you!! tell me please, when will you figure out a way to shut the Iranian regime down?
@BernieSanders you need to have another plan in case your resolution allows Iranian regime to extend its influence and dangerous roles in #Yemen.
@SenSanders shall I remind you of what happened in #Iraq when US forces invaded it and killed innocents ppl?? did you then call for withdrawal or you just ignored it!!
@SenatorDurbin because Gina Haspel has nothing to say, and the authorized ones to talk are the White House itself which denied any involvement of #MBS
@markknoller @SenatorMenendez he wants everything to be as he wants!! there‚Äôs an administration that knows what‚Äôs best for its interests &amp; its ppl so no need to go publicly and attack them as he did.

this‚Äôs an example of a reasonable American official who‚Äôs looking for his country‚Äôs interests without harming its stability. https://t.co/cZkZ60TTVX
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo and Iranian regime is using its economy to fund terrorism, and that includes funding Houthis in #Yemen.
@SecPompeo Yemen needs more actions to help it, and I mean actions that stop more damages caused by Houthis and Iranian regime. 	if we could stop those two forces, we can reach the peace we‚Äôre looking for.
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo actually you admire Iranian regime and its violence policies, and that‚Äôs so obvious from your tweets üòè #Iran isn‚Äôt helping the civil conflict of #Yemen, in fact they‚Äôre providing more weapons to Houthis to keep the conflict on.
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo basically you‚Äôre defending Iranian regime and try to cover their role in #Yemen, but the US administration has another option which you don‚Äôt like üòÑ.

@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSanders @SenMikeLee hard to see cowards senators can‚Äôt stand up for Yemenis and stop Iranian regime from interfering in their affairs and supporting Houthis who attack them.
@SenSanders US is NOT supporting any catastrophic war, Iranian regime does. 	stopping the regime of @khamenei_ir is your responsibility so do your job.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSanders @SenMikeLee the main question here is what‚Äôll you do next? are you going to punish the Iranian regime or you‚Äôll protect them?
@ChrisMurphyCT if #Saudi-led coalition didn‚Äôt help #Yemen 3 years ago, you‚Äôd have seen the most disastrous war crimes committed by Houthis, so we should be thankful for the coalition who went fast and stopped the militants.
@SenSanders then what? what‚Äôll be your next move to stop the civil conflict in #Yemen? are you going to fight Iranian regime? I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd go against your friends in #Iran
@BernieSanders do whatever you want but remember that history will write your names as the one who let Iranian regime to invade #Yemen by helping Houthis.
@KenRoth do you know that your tweets are meaningless and not helpful at all levels?? you changed your role as @HRW activist into a #Saudi critical.
@KenRoth all I see here is Tunisian president greets #Saudi Crown Prince #MBS and welcomes him so warmly. https://t.co/gESAUGfKtb
@KenRoth is that what he says when he announced it? or is it your own opinion? isn‚Äôt your job to defend human rights? so why I see you attacking human rights bodies?
@BernieSanders you‚Äôve been misleaded, and now you‚Äôre misleading us too!! why didn‚Äôt you mention #Iran ‚Äòs roles in #Yemen and its support for Houthis who‚Äôre killing innocents people there??
@BernieSanders #SaudiArabia has help Yemeni facilities by providing medicines &amp; humanitarian aids +	there‚Äôre many #Saudi doctors over there risking their lives in order to save Yemenis.

@MiddleEastEye they‚Äôre not Tunisians, mostly they‚Äôre ppl who were paid to launch rallies that will take the country to its disastrous past.
@KenRoth @hrw is that a threat? are you saying that you challenge #Saudi crown prince #MBS to attend the meeting? that‚Äôs a dangerous move by a man who dealt with terrorists üòè
@AJENews nothing came from #Saudi official media so why should we believe you?
@khamenei_ir no you‚Äôre wrong mr. killer! their actions and sanctions against your regime haven‚Äôt failed at all. 	your regime will suffer the US sanctions until you give up and stop funding terrorists in region.
@SenSanders after that we all can reach a political solution that Houthis don‚Äôt wanna see it.
@SenSanders you want to stop that civil war? first you need to stop Iranian regime‚Äôs finding for Houthis, then stop Houthis from killing Yemenis.
@statedeptspox this kind of successful voting won‚Äôt make Iranian regime happy and satisfied at all.

@Reuters and we the ppl ask @HRW to reveal its director @KenRoth ties with #Qatar and #Iran in order to see if we can trust him or not.
@BernieSanders the humanitarian disaster in #Yemen caused by Houthis, not because of your support for #Saudi-led coalition!! so why‚Äôd you focus on #Saudi Arabia instead of cutting Houthis‚Äô funds??
@BernieSanders is that your goal of life? did you forget to fight for Americans in order to achieve their dreams?? they want a health care insurance not to focus on #SaudiArabia
@hosseinsafari99 @hrw just tell me what‚Äôre his war crimes? don‚Äôt bother yourself to bring Khashoggi case or #Yemen because you‚Äôll fail to prove it.
@hrw so basically your efforts to accuse innocents people for crimes they never did are meaningless and useless.

@FaceTheNation @SenSanders @margbrennan @SenMikeLee did he talk in his book about #Iran‚Äôs influence in Middle East? or about its danger if its influence extend in #Yemen?
@SenatorCollins he didn‚Äôt ignore the CIA report, he told the world that the report doesn‚Äôt confirm anything for sure.
@CNN @joniernst any indicator doesn‚Äôt confirm 100% that #MBS is involved unless you‚Äôve a strong evidence, otherwise your accusation is meaningless.
@CNNPolitics what about your ties to #Qatar? I guess US administration should stop Qatari money that control some senators‚Äô decisions in Congress.
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation I‚Äôm sure that you‚Äôre not allowed to talk about classified information you received from #CIA which means either you‚Äôre betrayed them or you‚Äôre giving false information!!
@HuffPost but you guys don‚Äôt accept the truth, you wanna others tell you what you want to hear. 	#MBS is innocent but you want to blame him because you‚Äôre afraid of his successful reforming plans.
@jonathanvswan so it‚Äôs obvious that some senators are targeting #Saudi crown prince #MBS for personal reasons + to achieve some countries‚Äô agendas.
@thehill one question! didn‚Äôt you read the #Saudi latest statement!? they said they‚Äôll punish whoever involved in that case and betrayed #SaudiArabia and violated its values.
@netanyahu sanctions won‚Äôt be enough to stop those terrorists and murders, Iranians should change this radical regime who controls their lives and prevent them to live peacefully and in freedom.
@MiddleEastMnt your agendas will expose and fail sooner or later, so enjoy your moments now.
@codepink history will remember the day when Finland turned its back on Yemenis by stopping the arms sales to #Saudi-led coalition. 	Houthis will use this chance to expand their influence in #Yemen.
@alvarlaigna @KenRoth did Finland, Germany, and Denmark think of Iranian regime‚Äôs threats in #Yemen?? did they know that if they stopped their support, many lives will be gone by Houthis‚Äô hands??
@KarenAttiah they know for 100% that MBS is a good leader and those rumors are fake. 	they‚Äôre not stupid to make them work for your agendas and plans.
@KarenAttiah what a shame to see Tunisians listening to your pathetic thoughts and do as you say!! they‚Äôre better and wiser than you think so your words won‚Äôt change their minds.
@KenRoth what will #Finland do when it discovers that #SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt play a role in #Khashoggi murder?? are they gonna apologize for their decision?
@SenBlumenthal I guess whatever CIA and Trump‚Äôs administration say, you‚Äôll do your best to accuse #MBS.
@SenBlumenthal what if #CIA said that #Saudi crown prince #MBS is innocent and has nothing to do with #Khashoggi death!! would you believe your intelligence agency or you‚Äôd say that they‚Äôre protecting him!!
@CNNPolitics I advise Turkish FM to quit his job and work as a journalist or a detective!! he released so many statements about #khashoggi instead of fixing his country‚Äôs relationship with regional nations.
@AJEnglish are you guys trying to convince us to launch rallies!! you simply will fail because #Tunisia ppl know that #Qatar is supporting terrorism and seek to destabilizing our societies.
@thehill because it was leaked to media, classified report leaked!! no official can trust a leaked documents.
@borzou okey does mr. Reed received #CIA report which‚Äôs classified?? I don‚Äôt think he read it at all.
@AJEnglish ooh guys you‚Äôre too busy of #SaudiArabia which made you look like you‚Äôre a #Saudi media agency üòèüòÑ
@AJENews seriously?? are those your dolls? did #Qatar pay them to give the world a wrong image of #Tunisia ?
@ChrisMurphyCT so isn‚Äôt better for you to stop the Iranian regime and Houthis from attacking Yemenis??
@ChrisMurphyCT and if you do that, then what? #Iran will continue providing weapons to Houthis, the same weapons that are using to kill innocents children and women in #Yemen.
@JZarif US didn‚Äôt make that up, #Iran has a dangerous regime that will destabilize our safety and security.
@JZarif peace efforts in #Yemen ü§£ü§£ what a joke. 	since when your regime looks for peace? you caused the destruction in Middle East and still funding terrorists.
@sudhaachararts as long as it‚Äôs in the news, then it‚Äôs not a secret visit. 	you even don‚Äôt know is it true or not but you like to manipulate your ppl.
@KenRoth if the #UNSC wants to establish a new resolution on #Yemen, it should be a resolution that prevents #Iran from interfering in Yemeni civil conflict which‚Äôll cut all ties Houthis. 	then we can have the peace we all wanted.
@KenRoth you missed something mr. Roth. 	#SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt murder, chops up, or disposed the body of Jammal #Khashoggi, some #Saudi individuals did that and they‚Äôre being investigated by the government itself.
@CNNnewsroom to defend your ally from those fake campaigns carried out by Qatari &amp; Turkish media doesn‚Äôt mean that the Us is working for #SaudiArabia, so plz ppl stop playing mind games.
@trtworld ‚Äúreports, reportedly‚Äù those are the magic words that media use to spread #FakeNews that serve its agendas. 	there‚Äôs become no credibility or honesty in media from now on.
@CNNSitRoom United States has values and principles that determine who‚Äôre its allies, so it‚Äôs obvious that #SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt committed any violations even though the fake news media are targeting it.
@KenRoth they‚Äôre the ones who helped #Yemen by money, medicines and food. 	I didn‚Äôt see your organization helping Yemenis when they were attacked by Houthis and Iranian regime‚Äôs agents.
@tparsi #CIA has no proof of what media claims so why we should believe #FakeNews!
@KenRoth but #saudiarabia has no problem to sanctions the killers by any country as long as it won‚Äôt reach the country itself.
@KenRoth he came clean when @AdelAljubeir announced that he‚Äôs nothing to do with the incident + @realDonaldTrump reaffirmed it days ago.
@jdawsey1 everyone tries to blame #Saudi Crown Prince for #Khashoggi death in order to achieve their goals but they‚Äôll fail.
@KenRoth and your source is a Turkish one!! wow you‚Äôre so close to convince me.
@KenRoth I guess you‚Äôre talking about a #Saudi person who‚Äôs been investigated by his country, so what‚Äôs your business?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS but @realDonaldTrump may become the president again!! is that mean you‚Äôll go against your president for another 4 yrs??? is that your duty? is that how you serve Americans!? what a shame.
@RandPaul let‚Äôs put the world‚Äôs security first!! which means to stop #Assad‚Äôs &amp; Iranian‚Äôs regime‚Äôs and Houthis from committing more war crimes against innocents.
@SenJackReed don‚Äôt you believe in your intelligence‚Äôs conclusion?? this‚Äôs too bad because you‚Äôre acknowledging that CIA isn‚Äôt good enough!!
@SenatorHassan he‚Äôs standing up for America‚Äôs value and it‚Äôs ppl by providing jobs and investments that will help United States and Americans.
@SenSanders you better focus on your health care program that Americans need the most, and find a solution to (carrying guns) issue that costs many lives so far.
@SenSanders wrong!! #Iran-backed Houthis are the ones who caused most (if it wasn‚Äôt all) destruction in #Yemen, so don‚Äôt defend the Iranian regime and make them the good people.
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump this doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all mr. Sanders. 	if you‚Äôve a problem with #Saudi Crown Prince then say it without bluffing.
@SenSanders you were upset because @realDonaldTrump didn‚Äôt release any statement related to CIA conclusion, and when he announced it you denied and started to accuse him of covering it up!!
@RandPaul either you‚Äôve mixed the two cases or your goal from the beginning is to stop the arms sales??
@RandPaul it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs security first!! when will you realize that #SaudiArabia is your closest ally and your friend that can counter the Iranian regime‚Äôs threats!!
@RandPaul you need to appreciate #SaudiArabia efforts to reveal the facts and punish the murders who committed a brutal crime against a #Saudi journalist.
@RandPaul there‚Äôs no way you can put #SaudiArabia with #Iran in the same list!!	#Iran is a terrorist state and the biggest sponsor of terrorism.
@CNN I wanna know what do they want? to criticize a trusted ally? to cut ties with an ally that can establish stability in Middle East?? are they insane?
@RandPaul you‚Äôre such an idiot and ignorant!! your administration has denied #CIA false report and condemn the leaks and you still believe it??
I guess he thought that his regime‚Äôs crimes would be forgotten, but he‚Äôs totally wrong. 	#Iran was and still the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world unless Iranian people act and change their regime ASAP. https://t.co/PkHRQbgpvM
@JZarif whatever others do, your regime will remain on the top of US administration‚Äôs list until your regime cuts funding terrorists and stop making new tests for nukes missiles.
@JZarif are you attacking mr. @realDonaldTrump just because he withdrew from your failure deal?? is that because he sanctioned your regime which costed you your economy??
@Independent accountable for what exactly?? for saving lives? because it helped its neighbor country? because it did its duty to prevent terrorists to take over #Yemen?
@ChrisMurphyCT how do you want it to stop while #Iran providing weapons and missiles to Houthis? those arms are being used against innocents people in #Yemen
@JZarif @Jeremy_Hunt you can end the catastrophic war in #Yemen by ending your support for Houthis militants and stop sending missiles to them that used to target #SaudiArabia and Yemenis.
@statedeptspox so #Iran claims it has democracy?? every time @khamenei_ir tweets, he makes me laughing üòÜ. 	when will he stop funding terrorists and start living peacefully with regional countries???
@WSJ it‚Äôs okey if it‚Äôs gonna sanction #Saudi suspects, but to blame #SaudiArabia for some individuals‚Äô actions then it‚Äôll harm the bilateral relationships.

@AJEnglish this‚Äôs what #Qatar seeks and it‚Äôll make sure that #Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman isn‚Äôt ruling #SaudiArabia because Qatar will collapse as long as it supports terrorism.

@MarkRuffalo @SpeakerRyan @RepRoKhanna @repmarkpocan you live in Hollywood but you know nothing about #yemen, do you have any idea what Houthis are doing there?? they killed their brothers and sisters and went against their own government.
@RandPaul so #SaudiArabia is the reason why you united again!! I thought issues that matter to Americans will make you work together üíî
@NRC_Egeland Houthis blocked every way to give medical aids to Yemenis, and that includes cholera medicine!!
@washingtonpost #SaudiArabia has told the world that it‚Äôll reveal the facts about #khashoogi mysterious death and now it announced the results and held the killers accountable.
@washingtonpost this‚Äôs justice üëèüèº a country that arrests its individuals and punished them for making a mistake is a country that deserves the respect.
@AP I guess #Turkey is looking for more than establishing justice!! is it asking for more death penalty? #SaudiArabia is acting based on Islamic laws and I‚Äôm pretty sure #Turkey is fully aware of that.
@AP #Turkey wants to act like if it was its business, I really don‚Äôt know why it keep hiding evidence and refuse to cooperate with #Saudi‚Äôs intelligence!!
@Reuters and #SaudiArabia proves once again that it‚Äôll not allow such stupid actions to happen, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôll execute those killers.
@RandPaul you‚Äôve disappointed all of us senator, I thought you‚Äôd find a solution to Houthis‚Äô present in #Yemen but I guess your feelings toward #SaudiArabia blinded you to do the right thing.
@RandPaul is this your way to show us how you stand up for justice? what about Iranian regime‚Äôs operations in #Yemen?
@RandPaul your vote will help Iranian regime to extend their operations in region and do whatever they want to make sure they‚Äôre controlling Middle East.
@RandPaul you can stand up for innocent life and speak out against humanitarian tragedy when you condemn Houthis who caused the destruction in #Yemen
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews when will #Turkey release everything it has and give it to #SaudiArabia to carry on its investigation?? #Turkey tries to ruin the #Saudi investigation
@MiddleEastEye what a funny report you have üòÑ	do you think anyone would believe your shit??
@NegarMortazavi @AmnestyNow is this how Amnesty treat official consulates?? wow @amnesty you went to the bottom.
@John_Hudson first, I‚Äôm sure both newspapers never listened to the mysterious audio tapes. 	second, mr. Bolton has listened to thee recordings and as he said there‚Äôs nothing refers to MBS as media claimed.
@John_Hudson why they linked the word ‚Äúboss‚Äù to #Saudi Crown Prince?? is he their target from the beginning?
@RoKhanna I really don‚Äôt know why you keep blaming #Saudi Arabia for the tragedies in #Yemen!!! they‚Äôre helping there.
@RoKhanna #Yemen‚Äôs crisis was caused by Houthis and their supporter (Iranian regime). 	don‚Äôt blame #SaudiArabia because it‚Äôs protecting its borders and joined the battle because the Yemeni government asked for it.
@RoKhanna what about establishing a resolution that seek to start a war against Iranian regime? then you‚Äôll save millions of innocents people in #Iran and region.
@RoKhanna we all care about our safety which means that US must keep its support in #Yemen in order to protect Yemenis from Houthis‚Äô violence.
@thehill so he mean #Iran doesn‚Äôt pose a danger to the world? is he really thinking of our safety and security?

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump the #Saudi authority has nothing to do with the accident, it didn‚Äôt order the operation or was aware of it. but it did the normal thing and arrested all suspects to reveal the truth about what happened.
@UNReliefChief @UN I couldn‚Äôt agree more with you but you need to condemn Iranian regime for its violence actions against Yemenis.
@SenFeinstein keep your thoughts to yourself Feinstein, the investigation isn‚Äôt over yet so be patient and wait until #Saudi authorities inform the world of its investigation‚Äôs results.
@CNN as a senator, you shouldn‚Äôt be fooled by media agencies who try to spread their fake reports to get more attention.
@HulingRichard @CNNSitRoom it‚Äôs not even #Turkey business, #Khashoggi was killed by Saudis inside a #Saudi territory -the consulate-.
what happened to mr. #Khashoggi should not interfere with any deals made by the two countries because it‚Äôll damage their historical relationship. https://t.co/kmtBCcAmOD
@imthemadridista @glcarlstrom @VeraMBergen @JKhashoggi I don‚Äôt see that, #khasshogi‚Äôs son has expressed his appreciation for bringing the ones responsible to justice.
@glcarlstrom @JKhashoggi they look sad, #SaudiArabia has lost one of its citizens. 	do you want them to laugh or joking around!!
@SecPompeo @khamenei_ir is the mastermind behind all tragedies and terrorist operations. he‚Äôs the one responsible for all sadness and suffering we witnessed. 	we‚Äôre preying to see #RegimeChange in #Iran
RT @SecPompeo: 35 years ago, 241 Marines, Sailors &amp; Soldiers were killed in Beirut, Lebanon, by an Iranian-trained Hizballah terrorist. We‚Äô‚Ä¶
the world will remember those brave people who were killed by hands of Iranian regime. 	#Iran must hold accountable for all its crimes against humanity. https://t.co/qTFZEX8FMD
@SenWarren @BuzzFeed one question, why‚Äôd you believe those sources? why wouldn‚Äôt you ask Emirates officials to confirm or deny these rumors? 		your way of believing reports are pathetic.
@JonasPWerner @SenSanders you my friend forgot one important thing, #SaudiArabia is supporting Yemeni legitimate government to stop the danger of Iranian regime and Houthis militants. without #SaudiArabia, #Yemen will be controlled by terrorists.
@SenSanders then what? leaving #Yemen to fall in hands of Houthis and Iranian regime?? is that your principal of justice? your solution to save Yemenis?
@RepRoKhanna pointless war? you see the attempts to save #Yemen a pointless? 	then you‚Äôre okey to let terrorists like Houthis take over #Yemen and launching their operations from there.
@codepink @SenBillNelson you guys don‚Äôt know the specific details of those arms deals you aim to stop, and you for sure don‚Äôt know how‚Äôs that will affect the security of Middle East.
@codepink @SenDonnelly this‚Äôs not a solution to come with, you need to find a way to establish peace in Middle East and stop the Iranian regime‚Äôs policies that destabilize the world.
RT @WajahatAli: Important reminder Turkey's President Erdogan has jailed more journalists than anyone else last year. Don't let the speech‚Ä¶
@waltshaub don‚Äôt mix everything up, you know that #SaudiArabia is helping #Yemen by using that weapons + it protects itself from Iran-made missiles launched by Houthis.
@waltshaub you‚Äôre wrong mr. Shaub!! @realDonaldTrump is waiting for the #Saudi‚Äôs investigation to end and see its results. 	he believed in #Saudi justice and sure that they‚Äôll do what‚Äôs right.
@AJEnglish @KhaledBeydoun you‚Äôve crossed your line way too much!!	I advise you to watch your own words or you‚Äôll pay the price for it.
@jimsciutto @BenSasse and does the #Saudi statement mentioned the bone saw part? of course not. 	then why do you insist that it was exist??
@CNNPolitics #SaudiArabia was and still working transparency in all its activities and reforms, the #Trump administration is very wise to see the truth among the many lies and claims come from Qatari &amp; Turkish media.
@CNNPolitics the US-Saudi relationship will remain strong as ever whatsoever happened.
@Jen03745571 @BaltRevolution @SenBlumenthal but at that time nothing was confirmed yet, so her resignation has nothing to do with #Khashoggi death.
@SenBlumenthal I don‚Äôt see the link between #Saudi Crown Prince and the current investigation of the 18 suspects!! 	mr. @AdelAljubeir has announced that #MBS wasn‚Äôt aware of the accident and hasn‚Äôt ordered anything related to #Khashoggi except the investigation.
@SenBlumenthal are you ready to impose sanctions on #SaudiArabia and throw the historical relationship between the two countries away just because you didn‚Äôt think of future of the relationship?
@SenBlumenthal are you aware of what‚Äôs going on in #Yemen? do you realize how dangerous is Iranian regime if US stopped supporting the legitimate government and #Saudi-led coalition there!!		are your hatred feelings blinded you from seeing the truth?
@SenBlumenthal it‚Äôs an investigation nor condemnation, not all of those 18 ppl are guilty until we see the final results of the investigation.
@CarolineLucas the Yemeni government has asked #SaudiArabia to give a helping hand, then terrorists attacked #Saudi cities which means that #SaudiArabia has the right to protect itself from any danger.
@CarolineLucas media is giving false facts about the reality, #SaudiArabia will hold #Khashoogi killers accountable and punish them. 	in #Yemen, #Saudi-led coalition is supporting the Yemeni legitimate government to retake control of its territories.
@margheritamvs because the Saudi members sent their reports says #Khashoggi has left the consulate, which was unlike the Turkish‚Äôs reports. 	then #SaudiArabia decided to create a joint team with #Turkey to reveal the truth.
@margheritamvs @WSJ okey #SaudiaArabia itself isn‚Äôt involving in #Khashoogi death, some #Saudi members of negotiation team did a huge mistake and did kill him and they‚Äôll get punished for their   irresponsible actions.
@AhmadAlgohbary those fighter jets are there to eliminate every target may pose a threat to Yemenis.
RT @FoxNews: Saudi Foreign Minister @AdelAljubeir's message to the Khashoggi family: "This is a terrible mistake. This is a terrible traged‚Ä¶
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA you‚Äôre insulting #SaudiArabia by the way!!!	Saudis didn‚Äôt lie and told the world the preliminary results of their investigation immediately!	you should be a shamed of yourself if you ignored its efforts to reveal the facts.
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA where‚Äôs the body??? did you read the #Saudi statement?	they announced that investigation isn‚Äôt over yet so why are you trying to create a show here!!!
@RepTedDeutch your values are the world‚Äôs values, you don‚Äôt have different values, so that‚Äôs why #SaudiArabia can‚Äôt let this accident pass without bringing the ones responsible for #Khahshoggi death to justice.
@SenJackReed you‚Äôre accusing a country of something without having evidence, you‚Äôre risking your reputation and ties with #SaudiArabia just for claims which are not true.
@SenJackReed the investigation isn‚Äôt over yet as #Saudi authorities said in their statement so don‚Äôt rush to conclusions that based on guessing.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump in #Yemen, Houthis are committing crimes against Yemenis and attacking #SaudiArabia with #Iran-made missiles. 		doesn‚Äôt #Saudi Arabia have the right to protect itself and the Yemenis?	or you‚Äôve something else in your mind?
@RepAdamSmith #SaudiArabia isn‚Äôt afraid to admit its mistakes, that‚Äôs why it did that corruption campaign to fix itself and develop its potential. 	days ago #Saudi authorities announced that #Khashoggi was killed and it has 18 suspects and investigation is on.
@RepAdamSmith #SaudiArabia also has an obligation to prevent anyone from interfering in its internal affairs, and that includes #khashoggi death, but it will share the results of the investigation with the world, including the #UnitedStates.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump mr. Schumer, you‚Äôre a wise man and aware of how important the historical relationship between United States and #SaudiArabia. 	you know very well what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen and the Iranian regime‚Äôs role there. 	don‚Äôt ignore that #Saudi Arabia is doing its best to secure ME.
@SenJackReed you‚Äôre accusing an ally without having evidence, you‚Äôre risking your reputation and ties with #SaudiArabia for claims which are not true.
@summer_said @Ola_Salem @saudq1978 @SAFCSP so what? he might be under investigation now but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs guilty of #Khashoggi death. 		focus guys.
@VaughanPappy @My_Own_Opinions @cafreeland do you have a problem with his/her freedom of expression? @My_Own_Opinions expressed his thoughts and did nothing wrong or asked @cafreeland to shut up!!
@cafreeland you can take about the tragedy accident that hurts all Saudis but you cannot interfere in the internal investigation.
@cafreeland without your calls, #SaudiArabia is going to bring all who‚Äôre responsible for #Khashoggi death to justice and hold them accountable according to Saudi‚Äôs laws.
#SaudiArabia is a country of justice and no one cares about #Saudi citizens more than @KingSalman or his Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. https://t.co/15LY7WTobD
@John_Hudson it‚Äôs the @washingtonpost üòÑ	they‚Äôre trying to create any story to steal the spotlight but as always it‚Äôll fail.
@KenRoth do you say that #SaudiArabia is lying about what happened to #khashoogi? do you realize what you‚Äôre saying here??		stop accusing others who‚Äôre not involved in this case.
@RandPaul I don‚Äôt advise you to do that if you care about the security of the world!!	Iranian regime is waiting this moment to happen to extend its influence in #Yemen.
@RandPaul be careful mr. Paul, stopping the US participation in #Yemen will leave a remarkable impact on Middle East and #Iran will use that for its own interests.
@RandPaul why do you describe it as unacceptable? don‚Äôt forget that #Khashoggi was and still a #saudi citizen and the Saudi authorities said they‚Äôll reveal all facts about his death.
@deenainalex @aliShihabi Saudi person died, his killer or killers will hold accountable, then why are you so upset?
@KarenAttiah the statement was so clear, they went to #Turkey to talk to him as he requested (#Khashooggi), the situation went wrong and tried to cover it up. 	they did a mistake and #SaudiArabia will hold them accountable for it.
@timkaine you‚Äôre trying to make the situation like if #Khashoggi is an American citizen! come on!!		you lost the election to @realDonaldTrump who values the relationship with #SaudiArabia 		put your feelings out of the case.
@margheritamvs it lost nothing as long as it was honest and clear with everyone. 	those who caused the death of #khashoggi and tried to cover it up will bring to justice as soon as possible.
@margheritamvs @WSJ acknowledged that after it received the first results of its investigation, which does make sense because it has no idea of what happened there.
RT @aliShihabi: BTW senior sources also confirmed to me that the famous "bone-saw" NEVER existed and was purely a product of Turkish media‚Ä¶
@astroehlein you‚Äôre an ignorant person, you want to blame #SaudiArabia for #Khashoggi death whatsoever. 	relax, you won‚Äôt do anything if you wasn‚Äôt paid to say those claims.
@astroehlein do you think you can figure out what happened without investigation? üòèüòÇ	be reasonable dude. 	they‚Äôve investigated and concluded that there‚Äôre 18 suspects, and that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt mean they all fought him.
@TheBeatWithAri @AymanM anyone involved in that incident will hold accountable for what happened. 	#SaudiArabia will make sure justice is going to be done.
@SenBobCorker isn‚Äôt #khashoogi a #Saudi citizen?? why would you call for investigation?	if you don‚Äôt like #SaudiArabia then don‚Äôt let your feelings interfere your job.
@SenBobCorker they told the world that they don‚Äôt know anything, and started their investigation which concluded to the preliminary results that announced the death of #Khashoggi. 	the investigation is on.
@GormanJay @RandPaul @jaketapper you‚Äôre mixing everything up, arms sales are there to protect the region from Iranian regime‚Äôs aggression. 	the world felt empathy after 9/11 incident, which #Iran planned that operation.
@RandPaul #SaudiArabia respects all international laws that protect human rights &amp; nations as well. 	in #Khashoggi case, it reassures the world that it‚Äôll bring those responsible of his death to justice.
@RandPaul and that may serve your agendas as well üòè. 	I guess one day you‚Äôll blame #Saudis for the extinction of dinosaurs, not only #Khashoggi death.
you cannot cut the ties to get answers, this‚Äôs wrong. 	#SaudiArabia is sharing all information with all concerned parties. https://t.co/dh3YpZ2xZu
@RepMikeCoffman do you think you‚Äôre more caring about Saudi‚Äôs affairs and international human rights? you‚Äôre wrong mr. Coffman. 	#SaudiArabia since day one has started looking at the case of #khashoggi disappearance and now it announced the first results of the internal investigation.
you can see his plan in his last tweet, it isn‚Äôt about #khashoogi, it‚Äôs about his thoughts toward #Iran and Houthis who tried to take over #Yemen. https://t.co/tHNrn1vygO
@ChrisCoons okey this‚Äôs your goal from the beginning, you want to stop arms deals, to stop supporting #SaudiArabia to save #Yemen, so it isn‚Äôt about America‚Äôs values in the first place.
@ChrisCoons not credible? what do you want them to say!! they didn‚Äôt hide or lied about anything and they tell the world the preliminary results.
@ChrisCoons how didn‚Äôt you conclude that while you don‚Äôt have all evidence!
RT @_Malik550: @ChrisCoons every country has almost the same values, you‚Äôre not different at all. 	shall I remind you about #Guantanamo pri‚Ä¶
@ChrisCoons every country has almost the same values, you‚Äôre not different at all. 	shall I remind you about #Guantanamo prison? the place when U.S. was torturing prisoners to death, ignoring all human rights!!
@ChrisCoons he‚Äôs a #Saudi citizen who fought with Saudi man in a Saudi consulate, which is being investigated by Saudi authorities, I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre talking about free speech or human rights.
@sfahey_imp @RepTedDeutch #SaudiArabia cares more than anyone else about its citizens, that‚Äôs why it formed an investigation team to clarify the truth.
@RepTedDeutch the #Saudi statement announced that the investigation isn‚Äôt over yet, it‚Äôs preliminary results and it didn‚Äôt say who really killed #Khashoggi
@John_Hudson if Washington did that and it won‚Äôt for sure, #SaudiArabia will have to buy its weapons from others like Russia, it‚Äôs its right to protect itself.
@AP ooh so @anadoluagency announces that he‚Äôs disappeared nor murdered! üòÑüòè	I guess their anonymous source has mixed everything up.
@AP it‚Äôs a normal procedure in investigation, you need to question everyone including Saudis and Turks.
@chrislhayes if he‚Äôs murder, then where‚Äôs his body? tell us where is it?	you know he‚Äôs missing, I know he‚Äôs missing, the whole world knows that he‚Äôs missing. 	so stop your games.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad @UN what do you want him to say?? investigation isn‚Äôt over yet and if you acted professional you wouldn‚Äôt ask him such a thing.
@MoDualeh @sobiazia @KenRoth @kbsalsaud I‚Äôm a journalist and I take my job seriously, I won‚Äôt accuse anyone without evidence, I won‚Äôt do the same as those idiots who write based on who pays more.
@Joyce_Karam ABC is misleading its audiences, it lost its credibility and the people‚Äôs trust just because it published fake news. 		@POTUS was right about #FakeNews

@realDonaldTrump we‚Äôre sure #SaudiArabia has nothing to do with @JKhashoggi disappearance. 	#Turkey must provide the evidence it has or apologize to #Saudis for the claims it published.
@KenRoth why you insist that he‚Äôs behind @JKhashoggi disappearance?	I can think of one reason that make you keep doing this and that because the money you receive from specific countries.
@funder where‚Äôre those audio tapes? why we hear a lot of fake leaks but nothing about the tapes?	I guess there‚Äôre no tapes and Turkish authorities are in trouble.
@AJEnglish isn‚Äôt Joe Biden the guy who supported #Qatari and Iranian regimes to expand their funding to terrorism?
@sobiazia @KenRoth FYI, he went also to #Saudi consulate in Washington before and met the Saudi ambassador @kbsalsaud there. 	if #SaudiArabia wanted to arrest him, it could do that so easily before so don‚Äôt believe those rumors.
@KenRoth is that your way to tell the world how to respect human rights while you‚Äôre insulting the #Saudi Crown Prince?		shame on you.
@sitinanu @AJEnglish using innocents and children as shields is a crime too, but I don‚Äôt see you so upset about that, actually you didn‚Äôt condemn Houthis in your tweets.
@AJEnglish are you waiting him to say #Saudi forces never make mistakes!! okey we all hope to reach this level of professionalism, but again mistakes happen everywhere.
@tburages @KCDurling @LGHelebra @MarcucciMatt @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump so what!! can‚Äôt the son practice his own hobbies??? you‚Äôre pathetic. 	next time when you wanna play the investigator role, please bring some evidence.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump you again are repeating the same lie that US &amp; Saudis denied months ago. 	I really don‚Äôt know how come you guys believe everything you read.
@DomaLady @HLaverdiereNPD @JustinTrudeau yeah and let #Iran the new member?? be reasonable.
@HLaverdiereNPD @JustinTrudeau do you think it‚Äôs the best solution? do you realize how dangerous is the Iranian regime if the world allowed it to extend its influence in Middle East? are you ready to take the responsibility of your decision?
@toomadj @tutatt @KenRoth @liamcunningham1 you people are idiots üòÑ how do you want #SaudiArabia to show you the body while it reassures that @JKhashoggi left its consulate?? https://t.co/Hh0HtRBKly
@KenRoth okey then ask #turkey to release its audio tapes, if it really has them.
@miss9afi @realDonaldTrump isn‚Äôt he spending his sentence based on #Saudi laws? so how come you asked foreign people to interfere in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs internal affairs to release your husband?
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen @washingtonpost so you already made @JKhashoggi a dead person!! where‚Äôs his body or the evidence that proves his death??	is so then based on what you accuse #SaudiArabia of his death as you claimed??
@RandPaul then you intend to interfere in #Saudi‚Äôs internal affairs!!! is this your principal of respecting others‚Äô sovereignty?
@rulajebreal @JKhashoggi @chrislhayes @allinwithchris so you moved from kidnapping and murdering allegations into accusing @POTUS to use his position for his own interests!! 	no comments.
I‚Äôll tell you why, because the Qataris media is leading this case and misleading the whole world. 	while in #Yemen, #Qatar can‚Äôt cover Iranian regime‚Äôs or Houthis‚Äô war crimes. https://t.co/E5f6a9SFE5
@KenRoth his murder? no one proves that till this moment so how come you know this information and being sure?
@shaneharris take a side please, his death or disappearance? üòÑü§î	don‚Äôt play the words and act like an idiot.
@RepAdamSchiff the truth will expose itself soon and we shouldn‚Äôt jump to false conclusions that‚Äôll affect international security.
@EihabAD @KenRoth if investigation didn‚Äôt prove anything then the student is innocent.
@KenRoth as @POTUS said: ‚Äú#SaudiArabia is innocent until investigation proves the opposite‚Äù. 	be careful about your speeches mr. Roth.
@manal_alsharif @KarenAttiah @washingtonpost this‚Äôs a fake account created by @AJENews @AJEnglish, you can see that by following the qataris tweets.
@KarenAttiah @manal_alsharif US itself denied that, how come you tell they knew something didn‚Äôt happen?
@manal_alsharif @JKhashoggi are you the anonymous source who Turkish authorities hides? üòÑ	I hope you‚Äôre satisfied with your false opinions you spread via twitter.
@WSJ he‚Äôs a true leader and that‚Äôs why he became the president üëçüèº. 	the leader should not take any action without thinking about consequences.
@nytimes you‚Äôre reporting your news from local unknown Turkish  agencies ü§•ü§î	you‚Äôre not sure if these rumors are true or fake, so don‚Äôt risk your credibility and put it in line because of that.
@KenRoth ‚Äúreportedly‚Äù is the magic words to spread lies.
@SheilaKhani @NegarMortazavi again you need to have permission or your plane will be a target by Turkish Air Forces.
it‚Äôs really disgusting when you see the media spreading rumors by the name of officials while in fact no ones are making any statements.
this proves nothing unless they show the evidence they‚Äôve found. 	I really don‚Äôt know why everybody publish their news with no mention of names, everyone says ‚Äúreportedly, official, etc...‚Äù https://t.co/9F4CTcWQ4P
@SheilaKhani @NegarMortazavi your source please?!	FYI, no one can leave a country by a private jet without having permission to takeoff.
@NegarMortazavi wow what a fantastic story üòÑ 	everyday we see some exclusive news from unknown sources that are totally opposite of officials say üòÇ.
@NegarMortazavi you said he was murdered in the consul‚Äôs office, but #Turkey didn‚Äôt find evidence there when it searched the place. 		then why didn‚Äôt Turkish authorities release the audios they talk about lately?
@ProdMichelle @FoxNews @RandPaul those 15 you mentioned were Saudis but they were trained and lived in #Iran.
@FoxNews @RandPaul your opinions mr. senator are dangerous and risk the future of U.S. so please be wiser and think of America‚Äôs interests.
@FoxNews @RandPaul I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not the president, otherwise U.S. will be isolated with no allies at all.
@Bahadiman @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight stop saying things which don‚Äôt make any sense at all. 	since when a country is controlling the United States??
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight so you‚Äôre annoyed because @POTUS is defending his ally while there‚Äôs no evidence to deny #SaudiArabia?	I‚Äôm so disappointed that you‚Äôre a senator.
@astroehlein they‚Äôre the real killers you look for. 	#Saudis are buying weapons to protect itself and #Yemen from the danger of #Iran. 	so cut your crap and condemn Iran for its actions.
@astroehlein really? is that what concerns you?	don‚Äôt you care about the real problem in #Yemen? look at what Iranian regime is doing there!! they‚Äôre supporting terrorists who target civilians there.
@nytimes #SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt threaten U.S.  directly, it said it will act if a country decides to sanction #Saudi because of allegations.
@AP which evidence exactly because Turkish authorities didn‚Äôt say they found something supporting all claims of @JKhashoggi death.
@realDonaldTrump you‚Äôre the president of the United States of America, it‚Äôs so obvious you cut all of your ties with your own business. 	ignore those people who spread rumors to force their opinions on you.
@ChrisMurphyCT leave your differences with #SaudiArabia aside and do your job.
@ChrisMurphyCT you talk about your president like you were better than him üòÇüò™ wake up. 	look around and you‚Äôll see the lies made by anti-Saudi media.
@SenSanders if you do so, and you succeeded, you‚Äôll destroy every single hope of all Yemenis who dreamed of seeing their country‚Äôs future again.
@SenSanders #Iran was and still dangerous to the world‚Äôs security. 	if Iranian regime continues its brutal actions in #Yemen, then I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see any future there.
@SenSanders you‚Äôre very aware of how important the relationship between U.S. &amp; Saudi Arabia, you also are very aware that what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen isn‚Äôt #Saudi-led coalition‚Äôs fault.
@nadaburger @LouiseMensch @PhilipRucker @20committee @MrFelt_ @911CORLEBRA777 and why did you assume that he‚Äôs dead or killed by Saudis?	didn‚Äôt you think that Qataris maybe took him and created this story and MAYBE they‚Äôll kill him later to cover their dirty hands?
@PhilipRucker he meant that @JKhashoggi may be killed after he left the consulate by unknown killers. 	maybe they were from #Iran or brotherhood group.
@RoKhanna #Saudi-led coalition never targeted civilians on purpose, in fact Houthis are using them as their human shields to protect themselves. 	you must condemn them for their cowardly actions toward Yemenis.
@RoKhanna you can achieve peace by stopping the Iranian regime and Houthi forces who seek to destroy #Yemen and destabilize the Middle East.
@AJENews and tell me how did your anonymous source get the AUDIO you mentioned? üòèü§•
@NickKristof did @SecPompeo told you that? or you‚Äôre guessing?	if none then you‚Äôre unprofessional reporter who takes his job so recklessly.
@JRubinBlogger @abbydphillip if you concluded that, then you‚Äôre an idiot who doesn‚Äôt care about consequences at all.
@abbydphillip he‚Äôs totally right about that üòåüëçüèº. 	you cannot accused others without having evidence, and doing so will lead to cutting ties that harm everyone.

@ragipsoylu and you think they‚Äôll hide @JKhashoggi inside a laptop bag? üòèüòÇ	please stop misleading the people!!	I guess if you saw @RT_Erdogan enter the consulate, you‚Äôll say he‚Äôs a part of the scenario. üòÇ
@andrewrsorkin murder üò™ü§•. 	did #Turkey, #SaudiArabia or even #US announced his death? 	please stop manipulating the people‚Äôs feelings and thoughts.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth there‚Äôs nothing impossible, no one thought @realDonaldTrump will keep his promise and be a president. 	Middle East has its chance to change only if the Iranian regime stops its aggressive policies in region.
@KenRoth it‚Äôs a shame to be a senior human rights activist while you manipulating people who look at you as the savior.
@KenRoth wow you sure are annoyed because of #SaudiArabia or maybe because you got blinded by money that you no longer can see the truth.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth again you‚Äôre not funny at all. 	this‚Äôs a real situation where countries may enter new different &amp; difficult era.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth are you trying to be funny? 	you failed my friend, don‚Äôt involve yourself in this situation.

@UnfilteredSE @RepKinzinger @secupp you cannot cut all relationships with your ally because you heard some untrue rumors and reports.
@BBCPolitics @EmilyThornberry she‚Äôs against #SaudiArabia in the first place, so it‚Äôs normal to condemn Saudis for @JKhashoggi‚Äôs disappearance because she‚Äôs interests in doing so.

@RandPaul #Iran has killed journalists, diplomats, and politicians and I never saw you condemning the regime or call for sanctions!!	why #SaudiArabia even though there‚Äôs no evidence that condemn it? do you have problems with Saudis?
@SenToddYoung I really don‚Äôt know how you got elected to be a senator ü§® these fake reports that aim to harm the relationship between the two countries must not fool you so easily!!	look who‚Äôs going to have benefits of accusing #SaudiArabia and you‚Äôll find the truth.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS is the president, he‚Äôs not like you guys accusing others with no proof. 	you‚Äôre attacking him because he did things that don‚Äôt suit your agendas.
@HLaverdiereNPD @cafreeland before he became a journalist, he‚Äôs a #Saudi citizen and his country is more concerned about his sudden disappearance after he visited the Saudi consulate in #Turkey. 	so don‚Äôt try to use this case to spread your agendas.

@BazziNYU @TheAtlantic you don‚Äôt know if @JKhashoggi is dead or not, and Congress won‚Äôt take any move based on reports from anonymous sources.
@BazziNYU @TheAtlantic did #SaudiArabia kidnap @JKhashoggi? I don‚Äôt see any official saying that.
@iLayth @FinancialTimes @astroehlein do you hear yourself? #Turkey itself didn‚Äôt accuse #SaudiArabia till this moment which means there‚Äôs something wrong behind these fake reports we heard last days.
@FinancialTimes it‚Äôs gonna be a stupid move if they quit their relationship with #SaudiArabia just because they believed fake reports.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi this‚Äôs your problem, you believe whatever the media agencies said because they‚Äôre getting paid to publish what their clients want.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi are you kidding me? üòÇ	two planes and black vans don‚Äôt prove anything üòÇüòÇ	how can you prove those covered-faces are Saudis? did the Turkish authorities announced that? of course not.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi 1. which report you say? one Saudi consul in #Turkey has said that, and I gave you a specific name, not anonymous one as you doüòè	2. yeah I wanna see the thugs arriving and leaving. show me videos.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi @JKhashoggi + he‚Äôs a Saudi citizen who was trialed by a Saudi court based on some Saudi laws‚Äô violations. 	it‚Äôs 100% a Saudi‚Äôs business, not others‚Äô.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi @JKhashoggi I know what does takfiri means, no need to show me what you‚Äôve memorized. 	mr. Badawi has his trial with his lawyer by his side and the court made its final decision -10 years in prison with lashing-.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu sorry I meant to punish the guys who deserve it. 	we don‚Äôt like torturing as well. so it‚Äôs simple, if you violated a law you‚Äôll be punished.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi you‚Äôre repeating the same shit with no meaning üòÑ	again, I advise you to stop your whatever you do now because who‚Äôs ever paying you is for sure a part of @JKhashoggi ‚Äòs disappearance.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi as per the many reports, @JKhashoggi has left the consulate and none was murder inside it. 		I can do the same as you do, depending on unknown sources.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi then show me the video types.
@PressTV do you want them to accuse #SaudiArabia for everything? is that your wish? 	you guys are pathetic.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi Q. another one, where‚Äôs his body if he was killed inside the #Saudi consulate as you guys claimed? you can‚Äôt hide a body so easily especially when the eyes of the world is watching you.
@t_morrin Q. why didn‚Äôt Turkish authorities release video tapes of those 15 men, who claimed to killed @JKhashoggi, when they arrived and left the consulate?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi I don‚Äôt see names here üëÄ didn‚Äôt you find one?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu too big difference between torturing innocent and torturing someone who deserves it. 	don‚Äôt try to turn the table off because you‚Äôll always fail üòè.

@estechlin @AJENews guilty of what exactly? you people accused him with no signal evidence.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi never said her husband is being tortured in prison, she only demands for releasing him. 	I advise you to reconsider your opinions before you claim fake things.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu don‚Äôt give me names and claim that they‚Äôre tortured and beaten up with no evidence. 	anyone can write a report and say whatever he or she wants as long as this report brings money.
@AJENews what a funny story you guys wrote ü§•	aren‚Äôt you going to say that his body was burned to ashes or they ate him!! üòÇ
@hisham_melhem @JKhashoggi @washingtonpost used this story for its own interests, and idiots like you were fooled so easily, even though all Saudi‚Äôs affairs‚Äô are what made #Qatar pays your salary.
@Ola_Salem @LovedayM @smekhennet @kfahim we need names, not unknown sources or anonymous people familiar with the investigation. 	i doubt that there‚Äôs true sources behind this story.
@Qattouby @ragipsoylu @JKhashoggi I don‚Äôt see him wearing the uniform üòè I guess it‚Äôs a random pics you found them on website.
@Qattouby @MustaAlmadani @Sabah account‚Äôs name and picture‚Äôs name is so different üòÇüò™ who‚Äôre you trying to fool?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu the whole world is watching, and #SaudiArabia will never harm or threaten one of its citizens. 	so stop claiming things that don‚Äôt exist.
@ahmedbinrashid6 @ShafikFM those who‚Äôre in #Ritz also had secret trials and now they‚Äôre free. 	don‚Äôt be a fool.
@m3takl_en so basically your claims are fake 100%. 	the truth will rise soon and we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs behind this scenario.
@m3takl_en if he thought he‚Äôll be investigated if he come back, that means he admitted his mistakes. 	but he used to visit #Saudi‚Äôs consulates and embassies in #UnitedStates &amp; #Turkey and never said he was banned to enter them or being arrested.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu which people you mean? that women who pretend to be his fianc√©e?	his family denied that, and she has some links to #Qatari government which means that #Qatar is playing a role in this scenario.
@EMAW_GT @MailOnline I really want to know this anonymous source that nobody knows üòÇüíî.
@AP #Saudi authority has announced it‚Äôll open its consulate‚Äôs doors and cooperate with local authorities to reveal the mystery of @JKhashoggi‚Äôs sudden disappearance.
@rosemaryhopkin @MailOnline mr. Kashoggi is a Saudi citizen, and if #SaudiArabia wanted to investigate him, it could easily ask #Turkey to cooperate with it. 	so there‚Äôs no truth behind these rumors that Carmen from anonymous source as media said.
@MailOnline cut into pieces?? sure about that?	you need to be a professional media, not to spread lies.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu which freedom you‚Äôre talking about? is it the same freedom when @RT_Erdogan suppressed all of peaceful rallies and arrested all of his competitors? not to mention the shutdown of newspapers and other media stations.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu I don‚Äôt think #Turkey is currently in its best times while its economy is collapsing and feeds by #Qatar‚Äôs money. 	it won‚Äôt be a surprise if investigation shows that your country helped Qatari agents to create this scenario.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu they already told you that he came and finished his business and went out of the building. 	also #SaudiArabia sent a team of investigators to cooperate with #Turkey‚Äôs authorities to reveal the truth behind his sudden disappearance.
@Reuters #SaudiArabia has given the Turkish authority the green light to search inside its consulate as @Reuters did. 	#Saudi Arabia care about its citizens‚Äô safety and will do its best to cooperate with #Turkey to find him.
@RoKhanna why do you insist that #Saudi-led coalition attack civilians on purpose? for your information, Houthis are using them to cover themselves, they hide among Yemenis citizens and launching their operations from there.
@KenRoth don‚Äôt manipulating by using different words, you mean the women who were in contact with foreign states and provided to them sensitive information üòè	yeah don‚Äôt involve the real #Saudi women who love their country and will never ever do something stupid to harm their home.
@ShafikFM @ahmedbinrashid6 I‚Äôm pretty sure that @AlJazeera is paying you a lot of money as long as you‚Äôre working with them, you‚Äôve no credibility at all.
@ShafikFM @ahmedbinrashid6 this‚Äôs your reply? if I disagreed with you then you‚Äôll accuse me of being paid? trust me not all people are being paid as you.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker @BenCardinforMD so you‚Äôd believe some reports from anonymous sources rather than believe #Saudi officials??
@LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker @BenCardinforMD okey Senator, do you really believe that #SaudiArabia will kidnap #Saudi citizen who came to finish some business??? into-Saudi media did their best to spread this fake story.
@ahmedbinrashid6 @ShafikFM no one disappeared, the #Saudi authority has announced that they‚Äôre being investigated.
@ShafikFM are you whining because they said the truth that you cannot denied?
@kennyloza_no @KenRoth you‚Äôre so sure that he was killed!! did @Reuters find his body as you claimed?
@KenRoth I can see that your recent tweets are all about @JKhashoggi‚Äôs disappearance, I‚Äôm pretty much sure that your account is receiving too much checks.
@KenRoth based on what you say that he‚Äôs been killed by #SaudiArabia? did you see his body or a photo of it? did someone acknowledge that? 	if you want to make a story, please don‚Äôt use people‚Äôs feelings.
@KenRoth take a side, once you say he‚Äôs murdered, and in other tweet you say he‚Äôs disappeared or kidnapped!!!	can you please tell us what‚Äôre your final thoughts?
@chikogeorge1 @KenRoth @MachangolhiDhek wow, your opinions must be published everywhere, in fact you must write a book to enlighten your likes. üòÇ
@KenRoth why‚Äôd #SaudiArabia bother itself to kill him in the first place? because there‚Äôs no truth behind this claim. 	so stop creating fake stories and help the authorities to find him.
@KenRoth he entered and left the #Saudi consulate, he‚Äôs been going to other #Saudi consulates around the world and no one arrested or stopped him.
@AhmadAlgohbary then enlighten us with your intelligence, where‚Äôs his body if he‚Äôs dead?
@waltshaub U.S. administration knows very well what‚Äôs best for its interests and people, don‚Äôt make things look too bad just because you disagree with them.
@AJEnglish and Turkish authorities have no idea about this certain news üòÇ	next time when you want to spread fake news, try harder and cover it well.
@MiddleEastEye Ooh so now the same source told your agency about this exclusive news!! the same source who told @washingtonpost and @Reuters!!!	it‚Äôs obvious now that there‚Äôs unknown organization works secretly to blame Saudis.
@jrezaian but no Turkish officials confirmed this report of @washingtonpost!!!	I really don‚Äôt know why such a journal news insist to accuse #SaudiArabia of his disappearance and now of his fake death???
@ChrisMurphyCT #Saudi official denied this fake report of @washingtonpost and @Reuters 	make sure of your sources before claiming false things that will harm the relationship between the two countries.
@RepTedDeutch @washingtonpost too much rumors say that Qatar‚Äôs involved in his disappearance, I think it‚Äôs their new way to embarrass #SaudiArabia.
@ChrisCoons you talk like they kidnapped him and took him to unknown place. 	#Turkey is looking for #Gulen who hides in United States, why don‚Äôt you verify his location!?
@tomfriedman #turkish and #saudi security forces are searching for him at this moment and no one heard anything about him since he left the #Saudi consulate.
@KenRoth whatever he describes himself, he‚Äôll be considered as the great reformist who cut all ways for introducer to interfere in #Saudi‚Äôs society and affairs.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost based on what you accused #saudiarabia to kidnap a #saudi journalist? he entered the consulate and no one banned him, in fact he was welcomed, then he left the place.
@KenRoth maybe he‚Äôs sitting on his office at Qatari consulate.
@shepelutca @Shahnameh_ @SaraMassoumi @mehdirhasan @AJUpFront what about interview with the brutal dictators of Iranian regime @khamenei_ir and @HassanRouhani !! I wanna see them talk about their obsession with wars and chaos.
@mehdirhasan @AJUpFront regime of #Iran has committed war crimes and no one tried to stop them except @POTUS who faced struggles from #EU leaders.
@KenRoth wherever #Iran involves, there‚Äôll be no peace or end of conflicts. 	the regime is obsessed with blood, destruction, and chaos.
@KenRoth keep in mind that #SaudiArabia has many enemies like #Iran and #Qatar who‚Äôre willing to do anything to harm #Saudi Arabia.
@KenRoth the consulate itself told the media that he left its building immediately after he finished his business, why do you accuse #SaudiArabia of his disappearance?
@JZarif do you really think that Arab countries will cooperate with your regime? your regime is seeking to spread destruction and chaos in all over the Middle East and you call to cooperate!!!
@carlbildt and #SaudiArabia told press that he left the consulate, and it‚Äôll cooperate with Turkish security forces to search for him.
@AJENews maybe he went the the Qatari consulate and disappeared ü§î it‚Äôs possible when we think of it.
@khamenei_ir instead of tweeting, try to fix your regime that damaged your economy, Iranians deserve a better future for themselves and their children.
@khamenei_ir it‚Äôs not the US administration who‚Äôll change your regime, true Iranians are. 	your regime will soon fall from the inside, Iranian people will do it to make the country as it should be.

@RoKhanna why didn‚Äôt say that we should stop #Iran? you always focus on #SaudiArabia even though your country knows that Iranian regime is the threat here.
@hs88_hs88 @RoKhanna @SocialistProf you see the picture from wrong side, those countries know how dangerous Iranian regime is, if it controlled the country then Middle East will lose its stability.
@RoKhanna until Iranian regime &amp; Houthis militants withdraw their forces from #Yemen and leave it for good.
@m_audin @NegarMortazavi @NickKristof pathetic. 	the world acknowledged #Saudi‚Äôs efforts to help #Yemen + #SaudiArabia has donated money &amp; aids more than any country or organization.
@codepink @LockheedMartin no one is happy with wars, even those companies that build weapons, so stop focusing on #Saudi-led coalition and see what Iranian regime is doing in #Yemen.
@AJEnglish if #Qatar stopped its funding for terrorist groups such Houthis militants, I guess the civil war would be ended long time ago.
@AJEnglish the same war that #Qatar supports Houthis against the legitimate government of #Yemen. 	history will write that #Qatar was a negative party in this civil conflict.
@QatarAtUN @UNICEF @UN how hypocrites Qataris are!!	#Qatar secretly supported Houthis militants who brought crisis to #Yemen, and now you try to show yourselves as the good people!!
@Independent if the international community doesn‚Äôt act immediately against this brutal regime, I‚Äôm afraid to see a dark future for Middle East.

@JZarif you need to learn how to keep your promises before lecturing others. 	#Iran couldn‚Äôt commit to its obligations because its goal is to bring the region into chaos, it doesn‚Äôt care about its people‚Äôs future or safety.
@JZarif your regime has threatened countries, blown up embassies, and killed diplomats. 	Iranian regime‚Äôs actions cannot be described or imagined.
@JZarif the only country in the world that seeks to destabilize the whole world is your regime. 	don‚Äôt even try to look like as a victim here.
@JZarif are you serious? don‚Äôt you see that your regime has lost its credibility with others?? you promised to stop your regime‚Äôs aggressive policies and nuclear programs, but yours kept running its facilities secretly.
@JZarif your regime isolated itself by supporting terrorists and funding them. 	by doing that, you prevent Iranians to live their lives freely because your policies are not acceptable to others.
@Faye0100 @pamaddo1 @AhmadAlgohbary each media sees the situation from its own view that supports its agendas, they don‚Äôt believe what the coalition‚Äôs media center says because that doesn‚Äôt serve its interests.

@pamaddo1 @AhmadAlgohbary it bombs terrorists‚Äô weapons bases that used to attack civilians in #Yemen. 	this‚Äôs the only way to protect the country till Yemeni legitimate government get control of its territories.
Houthis have destroyed Yemeni health and water facilities which lead the #Yemen to face starvation. https://t.co/6iu4dCS011

@astroehlein at least @POTUS has courage to praise his truly allies, unlike others. 	but did he praise #Qatar? no	do you know why? because it supports terrorists.

@SecPompeo I feel sorry for Iranians who‚Äôre suffering from the regime that control their lives and rights, they deserve to live in peace and have their full rights.
@SecPompeo what a shame!! instead of helping them with millions, the regime used its money to fund terrorists in Middle East.
@SecPompeo we all know that facts, Iranian regime has been the greatest threat to all countries in Middle East and the world by its support of terrorism.

@AFP anyone tries to destabilize the Saudi society with zero intention to make life better will face trial.
@ADIsaddlers @KenRoth if #Spain canceled the deal, there‚Äôre others willing to make deals with #saudiarabia.
@KenRoth it canceled the deal because it didn‚Äôt want coalition to target terrorists (the Houthis) anymore.

@hannah_allawi @GarethPorter @VioletVampire2 not all, only #Iran and whosever support the regime like Houthis and #Hezbollah.
@GarethPorter it‚Äôs been done by accident, and coalition admitted that. but you can‚Äôt compare that to many attacks targeted innocents people by Houthis.
@LotteLeicht1 they‚Äôre two different things, don‚Äôt mix everything up to use it for your agendas. 		#SaudiArabia is protecting its security from inside and outside, and Canada must stop interfering in others‚Äô internal affairs.

@JZarif #Iranian regime is an active actor in Middle East, in negative way. 	your country is the biggest sponsor of terrorism and number one supporter. 	you‚Äôve no right to talk about others while you kill innocents and torture others.
@JZarif so funny how you describe it!	Iranian regime has been and always be a terrorist &amp; destabilizing state.
@JZarif joke of the year üòÇ no nuclear weapons in #Iran? stop playing the victim role here. 		we all know the truth about your regime and its goal to obtain nuclear weapons.
@Gallagher4NY @ABC then you prefer to believe some unknown reports and ignore officials‚Äô statements!!
@ABC but who understand!! hatred people try to blame coalition &amp; US for civilians deaths and ignore the fact that Houthis are the ones who slaughtered them.

@Desert_Vox @PressTV in region my friend.
@Desert_Vox @PressTV and who gave Persians the right to represent #Islam? don‚Äôt forget that most Muslims are Arabs, and the gulf are surrounded by Arab countries, which means it‚Äôs the Arabian Gulf.

@DOSTOYEV1 @PressTV so funny but don‚Äôt throw jokes again ü§≠ your regime has suppressed all peaceful rallies that called for change foreign policies and develop the economy
@PressTV look who‚Äôs talking here about executions üòÇ didn‚Äôt Iranian regime execute dozens of innocents people in #Iran and #Yemen!!!
@PressTV for what? he had nothing to do with economic collapse after #IRGC got all money to fund their terrorist operations in region.
@ZaidZamanHamid it‚Äôs so obvious that you cannot face the real killers, and instead you attack dead people.
@ZaidZamanHamid Iranian regime has been killing innocents people in #Syria, #Iraq, #Yemen, #Afghanistan, #Pakistan, and other countries, and here you are attacking him after he died.
@ICRC what‚Äôs the common element among those 3 countries?????? 	the Iranian regime of course, every time the regime interfere in any country, it collapsed and destroyed.

@FoxNews that‚Äôs our goal, just remember how much Gulf countries have suffered from Iranian regime and its aggressive policies.

@AJENews at least US didn‚Äôt launch attacks on #Iran as the regime do toward #SaudiArabia and other regional countries.
@Aremu1986 @Ahmadinejad1956 yes you can say the Iranian regime, don‚Äôt be afraid üòÑ the regime seeks to control #Yemen to make it their new base and launch its operations so easily.
@Ahmadinejad1956 you‚Äôve no right to talk about tragedies in region while you were a president of the regime that destroyed people‚Äôs dreams of live in peace.
@Ahmadinejad1956 look who‚Äôs talking about establishing peace and prevent wars üòÇ did you forget the terrorist operations you launched when you were in power?? forgot 9/11?
@Ahmadinejad1956 you did nothing for your people when you were in power, in fact you destroyed their lives and dreams of having a bright future.
@SarbazSart @Ahmadinejad1956 he was the main reason for economic collapse because when he was in office he used the Iranian economy to invest in terrorism.
@Ahmadinejad1956 and the clearest example is the Iranian regime who controls Iranians who seek to live in peace. 	Iranians are the victims of your presidency, you used all money to fund terrorism while you should spent it to develop the economy.
@SenatorDurbin to release them all with no condition!! who‚Äôre you to ask a government to do such thing? maybe you didn‚Äôt learn from #Canada‚Äôs mistake.

@Kathryn69457678 @Marcdelmas3 @Reuters it‚Äôs up to you but when it comes to security we all care about our safety and future, as long as the Iranian regime has money to fund its terrorist operations, we won‚Äôt live in peace.
@Reuters totally unacceptable act from #EU, European nations should help protecting the world and make sure our people live in peace, and giving 20 millions aids to Iranian regime doesn‚Äôt achieve our goals.
@PressTV hope soon Iranians live freely without the regime‚Äôs control.
@britton_durham @RT_com which wrong message exactly you mean?	US is trying to cut funding terrorism to one purpose: TO SAVE THE WORLD.
@sirasaf @RT_com those 20 millions can fund 2 or 3 terrorist attacks on United States or another country, innocents will die because of that aid.
@RT_com then what‚Äôll happen? Iranian regime will use that money to fund its terrorism operations that risk the whole world.
@PressTV #EU doesn‚Äôt care about world‚Äôs safety, just like the Iranian regime. 	supporting terrorism isn‚Äôt acceptable and the international community must act ASAP.

@AhmadAlgohbary so you start using displaced people as victims to blame coalition!!!! shame on you. 	you should stop your Houthis friends from playing dirty and leave innocents people out of the war.
@kalofye @RoKhanna @Mpeacemaker killing innocents people is inhuman and Houthis must stop using Yemenis as human shields.
@RoKhanna and based on what you determined they‚Äôve been killed by American weapons? why you didn‚Äôt say maybe they‚Äôre killed by Iranian weapons?
@PandActivist @RoKhanna and not forgiving those who‚Äôre in power and helped the Iranian regime to have more power to destabilize Middle East
@RoKhanna how disgusting you are!!	so you blame #SaudiArabia for the war and ignore the fact that Iranian regime &amp; Houthis are the ones who started the war in #Yemen
@i24NEWS_EN @ambmcg @MichelleMakori the #Saudi minister meant to say that the brutal #Israel didn‚Äôt prevent Muslims from performing #Hajj this year, unlike #Qatar
@PressTV #SaudiArabia is doing its best to serve all Muslims who came to perform their rituals. 	its efforts are appreciated by all nations except Iranian regime who‚Äôs trying to control all muslim nations.
@ArnMenconi @AhmadAlgohbary @RepRoKhanna you‚Äôll blame US &amp; #SaudiArabia for what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen and don‚Äôt say a word to Iranian regime and Houthis who‚Äôve been killing &amp; torturing Yemenis.
@AhmadAlgohbary are you trying to fool us? we know who‚Äôs killing innocents people in #Yemen, your Houthis friends and their ally (the Iranian regime).
@AhmadAlgohbary which means the coalition has a full support from United States, the support that seeks to protect Yemenis and the regional countries from the danger of Iranian regime and Houthis.
@humdard73 what‚Äôs your source? because what you have said isn‚Äôt true at all!!!! it‚Äôs a shame to lying to people who believe you.
@AJENews #SaudiArabia did allow Qataris to travel to #Makkah but Qatari regime has blocked their way.
@andr5452 @rmmtenterprises @TorontoStar okey then why didn‚Äôt #Canada talk about human rights in #Iran?
@Musasalifu007 @AJEnglish it‚Äôs totally wrong and fake news. 	since when #SaudiArabia started to ban Muslims to come to #Makkah and perform one of the 5 religious rituals!!!!
@Ilyas5138 @AJEnglish seriously? you believed that lie?	#SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt ban Iranians from #hajj, so you think it‚Äôd do that to poor Qataris???
@AJEnglish liars. 	#SaudiArabia has opened all ways for Qataris to perform #Hajj this year, and it created 2 sites for them to complete their applications, BUT Qatari regime has blocked the sites and prevent its people to go to #Makkah
@rmmtenterprises @TorontoStar crown prince needs not to do that to tell anyone how strong and effective he is. but #Canada violated international norms and interfered in its internal affairs and that was unacceptable at all.
@TorontoStar your attempts to make #SaudiArabia looks like it is a dangerous place is unacceptable, you‚Äôre not attacking #SaudiArabia only, but all Muslims countries also.
@TorontoStar all Muslims appreciate what #SaudiArabia is doing for them to make #hajj much easier, its efforts are indescribable and great. 	no country can host 1.7 millions of visitors in one place and mange that so professional.
@karl_haynes @codepink FYI, Houthis are using Yemenis as human shields, to protect their asses. 	this‚Äôs inhuman and unethical.
@codepink it even hosted Yemenis children and provided all they need to start their lives again after what they saw in #Yemen
@codepink #SaudiArabia has been helping children in #Yemen since the civil war started, it gave them health care and built schools for them.
@codepink isn‚Äôt there any chance that Houthis launched the attack and manipulated the crime scene to make coalition looks like it‚Äôs their doing?
@codepink @SenBobCorker @RepEliotEngel @RepEdRoyce I agree that #Yemen can‚Äôt wait for too long but as long as Iranian regime &amp; Houthis have their presence in #Yemen, there‚Äôll be no peace.
@RepRoKhanna you can end the civil war in #Yemen by stopping Iranian regime‚Äôs support for militants there.
@paray1 @PressTV your defense minister is manipulating you guys ü§≠ there‚Äôs no new fighter jet with great capabilities made in #Iran
@PressTV is it real jet or just a big toy to show off as always!?
@ChrisMurphyCT I wanna see what‚Äôll you do about that?	will you condemn and call for stopping the regime, or you‚Äôll keep silent?
@ChrisMurphyCT you keep talking about that a lot recently but no mention about #Iran‚Äôs present &amp; influence in #Yemen. 	Iranian regime is destroying the country and killing its people by providing weapons to Houthis.
@ChrisMurphyCT all operations are within the international laws, and US administration aware of that. 	US support is necessary to protect Yemenis there from Houthis‚Äô violence.
@ChrisMurphyCT the problem isn‚Äôt with the bombs, it‚Äôs about Houthis use of civilians as human shields, this‚Äôs unacceptable and inhuman, US administration have to do more to stop terrorists in #Yemen
@ChrisMurphyCT but investigation is not done yet, why did you conclude it‚Äôs launched by #Saudi-led coalition? did someone asked you to say that?
@KoenSwinkels @RoKhanna @ChaseMadar you maybe right, sites controlled by Houthis have many people and we don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre all okay or not.
@CherylC43735341 @RoKhanna it‚Äôs not about money or oil as you said, it‚Äôs about securing the world from militants in Middle East, those terrorists if they did take over #Yemen, then one day you‚Äôll see them in your neighborhood as #ISIS
@RoKhanna for your information and you already know that, Houthis &amp; Iranian regime are the ones responsible for tragedies are happening in #Yemen, you should condemn them for their actions not to protect their asses.
@RoKhanna and you immediately jumped into blaming #SaudiArabia, the one that provided aids to Yemenis, and let Houthis walked away without condemnation!!!!!!		shame on you.
@tparsi there‚Äôs no country on the planet that can pay 4 billions immediately, and #SaudiArabia won‚Äôt do that as long the brutal regime still in power in #Syria.
@AhmadAlgohbary you don‚Äôt have the right to talk while supporting terrorists!!	you don‚Äôt have the right to speak on behalf of Yemenis while you praise your Houthis friends!!	you don‚Äôt have the right blame the ones who help #Yemen while you attack them!!
@carlbildt each and every country should respect the other, and that includes stopping interfering in others‚Äô affairs, and arresting of innocents without trials.
@AhmadAlgohbary peace will come when Houthis and Iranian regime stop killing innocents in #Yemen
@GaryOrrell @rulajebreal I agree, Houthis don‚Äôt care a bit about Yemenis who have nothing to do with that conflict. 	international community must act quickly and stop those militants before it‚Äôs too late.
@rulajebreal did US administration say that? US‚Äôs defense? any official? No?	don‚Äôt depend on unsure reports that aim to distract people from discovering the truth.
@PressTV you such big liars, Yemenis know who‚Äôs destroying their country, it‚Äôs the regime of #Iran.

@PressTV @hrw @UN @amnesty the question is:	how did you film this video before it bombed? it‚Äôs clearly obvious the whole story was planned by Houthis.

@jricole yes, their voices were and will always be heard. 	#Saudi women do have their rights and are satisfied with everything the government has done for them.
@ElectroWave @RT_com respect it for what exactly? for its brutal policies in Middle East? for its support for terrorism? for its goals to launch nuclear war?
@RT_com this man cannot be trusted whatsoever, he‚Äôs radical thoughts that focus on killing anyone doesn‚Äôt obey his revolutionary  message.
@AhmadAlgohbary very good, you memorized everything #Iran taught you to say in front of the camera. 		I hope that #Yemen will be free of Houthis very soon.
@amazinggrac @CNN all of us are concerned about #Yemen, but there‚Äôll be no end of civil war there as long as #Iran supports the militants.

@khamenei_ir they‚Äôve strategic and powerful relations in many fields and that includes humanitarian field, which your regime doesn‚Äôt acknowledge at all by providing weapons to terrorists in #Yemen to kill poor innocents children and women.
@reza_banihashem @khamenei_ir which missiles Houthis used to kill Yemenis? Iranian missiles of course.
@khamenei_ir it‚Äôs too sad to see the brutal dictator who killed Yemenis tweets about the the suffering they live everyday and blames others.

@saltaf01 @EverettColdwell @GhamadiAbdullah @cafreeland all I see is #Canada making deals with regime of #Iran. 	if it ever condemned , I wouldn‚Äôt be serious about it.
@khamenei_ir there‚Äôll be a chance to reach a better deal with the current administration when your regime changes. 		this will make everyone happy.
@khamenei_ir your economy is being used to fund terrorism, there‚Äôs no way you can reach the level you mentioned while Iranians don‚Äôt get any benefit from their country‚Äôs economy.
@khamenei_ir negotiations are the safest way to calm down crazy terrorists, such as your regime!!	it‚Äôs not a business when US tries its best to save the world from destruction.

@AJENews #Qatar stole its people‚Äôs rights to perform #Hajj, the regime forced the people to keep their money home in order to avoid economic crisis because it insist to fund terrorists.
@AJENews let‚Äôs compare it with poor Qataris who‚Äôre prevented to travel to #Makkah for #Hajj, at least #Saudi students are okey with the decision, but Qataris are complaining about their regime‚Äôs selfish decision.
@mattyglesias wrong!	according to coalition, it‚Äôs been informed of every operations the coalition launched, with full details because the US is a valuable &amp; friendly ally of #SaudiArabia &amp; #UAE
@EmmaMAshford but who said that US is unaware of every operation of #Saudi-led coalition? it‚Äôs aware very well and supporting all operations that aim to counter terrorism in #Yemen
@cnni he‚Äôs totally right, #UK shouldn‚Äôt help the regime of #Iran whatsoever, that‚Äôs why it should take the advice and stand up for what‚Äôs best for the world‚Äôs future.
@Raindropsbc @CNN to side with terrorists? hmm I‚Äôm wondering what‚Äôll happen!! ooh it means any country allies with #Iran will consider as funder of terrorism.

@astroehlein Houthis used those children as human shields to cover themselves, they‚Äôre recruiting children and women to do their dirty works. 	international community must save those lives from Houthis‚Äô aggression.
@astroehlein are you trying to be funny! nice try. 	#SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt cut all ties with #Canada because it values its relationship with it, it made the door open to resolve the situation later.
@astroehlein rights defenders you mentioned are people who betrayed the country and tried to harm the society.
@astroehlein #SaudiArabia cares about its citizens‚Äô human rights more than anyone, but it won‚Äôt allow ANYBODY to interfere in its internal affairs and especially the security one.
@codepink #Canada made a mistake and didn‚Äôt have the courage to apologize, that‚Äôs why it made the whole situation relevant to human rights and forgot it also has issues in human rights.
@asadabukhalil you guys are the ones who brought destruction in the world by your hypothetical situations and speeches.
@DemolitionBlond @guardian who told you that account was representing #SaudiArabia??? only #Saudi officials make statements by officials means.
@margheritamvs it can give a sincere apology and vow not to do it again.
@raznochinets @AMPicard1 @guardian 9/11 attack was planned by Iranian regime and there‚Äôs plenty of evidence, that‚Äôs why was #Iran considered as the biggest sponsor for terrorism.
@mgsylvestre @guardian whoever posted it has no desire to such thing, he wasn‚Äôt lucky of choosing the photo that‚Äôs all.
@guardian it was a mistake and #Saudi authorities acted quickly by deleting the infographic and apologizing.
@aarondmiller2 + US knows its interests more than you, its interest in Middle East is to cut all ways to fund terrorism and that includes #Qatar and #Yemen
@aarondmiller2 #SaudiArabia and United States are allies for decades, they‚Äôve disagreements over many things but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can interfere in other‚Äôs internal affairs like #Canada did.
@mitchellreports @StateDept both of US and #Canada have issues with human rights in their countries, and #SaudiArabia didn‚Äôt mention that before and asked them to correct their internal situation because it‚Äôs their own business.
@RT_com did you see one #Saudi official threatened #Canada by launching an attack? of course not. 		as a professional news channel, you must check of how true the news is before publishing a report about it.
@DrZuhdiJasser you‚Äôre talking bullshit here!!	all world‚Äôs experts and analysts admitted how successful the reforms are.

@LindseyGrahamSC that‚Äôs why we all should support @POTUS decisions that aim to stop the violence of Iranian regime.
@cafreeland ooh really? aren‚Äôt you going to apologize for your interfering?	you should respect other countries‚Äô sovereignty and stop crossing the red lines.
@JAS_QATAR @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen of course you didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs your official source to fund terrorism.
@sunlorrie 2. You should hear official statements from #Saudi officials, not accounts you don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs running them.
@sunlorrie you‚Äôve to know 2 things:	1. #SaudiArabia doesn‚Äôt agree with that infographic, therefore it asked the owner to delete it and brought to investigate.
@JAS_QATAR @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen at least they apologized for it and started investigation, unlike your country which denied everything while the world see the opposite.
@aarondmiller2 @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen first, #SaudiArabia has nothing to do with 9/11, go and check. 	second, whoever running that account is not representing the #Saudi government. 	finally, #saudiarabia will never do such thing, never ever!!
@Ola_Salem @media_ksa I can bring to you plenty of verified accounts that threat Saudi Arabia everyday, does that mean they represent their governments? of course not.
@Ola_Salem that account made a mistake, and #saudiarabia had asked the account‚Äôs owner to shut it down, and started investigation. 		so don‚Äôt spread lies.
@realDonaldTrump we can‚Äôt let the regime do whatever it wants anymore, Iranians and the regional countries are suffering from that regime so tough sanctions are necessary.
@realDonaldTrump establishing peace is everyone‚Äôs goal, so that‚Äôs why we need to take action against the regime of #Iran in order to achieve that goal.

@RepRoKhanna @kbsalsaud the only cause of that crisis is #Iran‚Äôs interfering in #Yemen‚Äôs affairs and supporting Houthis to start that civil war.
@MehrnewsCom just say that you cannot respond to facts ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@rtcornwell @Ahura6666 @SecPompeo US has been one of the biggest supporters of freedom, and it won‚Äôt let the regime keep its aggressive activities and policies continue, so US will help the Iranians to change their government‚Äôs policies.

@ICRC #Yemen and #Syria have something in common: the Iranian‚Äôs presence that poses a great danger to civilians.
@PressTV @UNICEF the coalition will never ever attack or bomb something that will make live harder for Yemenis, but Houthis will do that so easily.
@AhmadAlgohbary because there was no one stoped the Iranian regime‚Äôs support for Houthis for the last three years until @POTUS came and threatened to make things right.
@AhmadAlgohbary why did that happen in the first place? the answer is simple: 	because of #Iran &amp; Houthis who terrified people and bombed them.

@AJEnglish she meant #Qatar to be specific. 	Qatari regime has history of supporting Israeli figures and hosted them home.
@AJEnglish will Houthis stop their aggressive attacks and don‚Äôt bomb medical centers? 	I guess no as long as they‚Äôve #Iran by their side.
@AJENews @AJEnglish look who‚Äôs talking üòÇ	since when #Iran committed to its word in negotiations!!
@imcorinnemec @RT_com the plane didn‚Äôt inform the coalition about its reasons that made it change its path.
@RT_com the plane changed its path suddenly, so it‚Äôs normal to force it to land after it ignored all attempts to make contacts.
@m3takl_en totally wrong. 	haters are the only ones who‚Äôll see these reforms as a threat.
@RepRoKhanna @RepBarbaraLee what about the people who‚Äôre tortured and killed by Houthis? aren‚Äôt you gonna do something about that too?
@BalstyFromUSA @WFP @jonathandumont1 @WFP_MENA Houthis started the civil war by killing their own people and brothers, they don‚Äôt represent #Islam at all.
@WFP @jonathandumont1 @WFP_MENA my heart with all people who failed to escape from Houthis‚Äô air strikes.
@UNICEFmena this tweet should be mentioned @HassanRouhani &amp; @khamenei_ir because they‚Äôre the ones who brought chaos in #Yemen.
@PressTV whatever #Iran does, sanctions will remain until the regime changes its foreign policies.
@carolecadwalla actually protests are exist in #Qatar but the regime suppressed all peaceful rallies there.
@KenRoth you became such a jerk!!	shame on you if you‚Äôre trying to cover up Iran‚Äôs ass and blame others.
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen aren‚Äôt you gonna call #Iran to stop its interfering in #Yemen and supporting for Houthis?
@AJENews next time when you guys write a fake report, try to make it sense and reasonable.
@MStephensGulf it‚Äôs the Qatari regime who took the case and involved others in the gulf boycott.
@AJEnglish new attempt to cover his regime‚Äôs actions in funding terrorism.
@PressTV hope #Iran, this year, respects the #Hajj and don‚Äôt do anything that poses danger to pilgrims.
@Fact__Matters @Craig26222841 @SenSanders #Iran has attacked many countries over the past decades, and that includes United States. so yes America is already at war against #Iran‚Äôs regime.
@DeniGoekfromGer @SenSanders #Iran doesn‚Äôt have the power to protect itself in the first place. 	don‚Äôt worry, if there‚Äôll be a WW3, it won‚Äôt be with #Iran
@SenSanders BTW, protecting the world has nothing to do with US election. 	can you focus on securing our safety from #Iran‚Äôs aggression?
@Shibuya34 @BahmanKalbasi tell me something, since when #Iran seeks to establish peace in Middle East?
@BahmanKalbasi his statement is so clear, no need to cover him up.
@FoxNews I guess @HassanRouhani has gotten things mixed up üòÇ he should ask himself to stop threatening Middle East‚Äôs countries and never interfere in their affairs.
@PressTV are you guys trying to change the fact that you‚Äôll lose if US starts a war against your regime?
@tedaduke @NBCNews Iranian regime‚Äôs power is a joke.
@Rrogerian @NBCNews since when #Iran‚Äôs regime looks for peace?	it only seeks to destroy everything.
@Joseph4Meg @NBCNews there can be no peace with a brutal regime like #Iran until it changes its violence policies in Middle East in general.
@NBCNews does he really think his regime can threaten the United States üá∫üá∏!!! üòÇ	@POTUS needs only one missile to destroy the regime and free Iranians.
@FaranakAzad1 @ForeignAffairs @PahlaviReza US must be close to Iranians who seek to regime change.
@ForeignAffairs #Iran‚Äôs policies are so dangerous, and its people are sick of its aggression toward innocents people in #Yemen and #Syria.
@WalidPhares add #Yemen too. 	the regime is aiming to spread destruction all over the region in order to achieve their agendas.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump the regime of #Iran needs someone, like @POTUS, to stops them for once and all. 		we sick of their aggressive behaviors toward ME countries.
@WalidPhares @LindseyGrahamSC this‚Äôs one of the best news I‚Äôve ever heard recently. 	so the regime needs to be careful about its next steps in its foreign policies or otherwise it‚Äôll face tough consequences.
@MostafaMe4 @WalidPhares @RaymondArroyo the regime doesn‚Äôt have the power to launch any direct war, so it‚Äôll use its militants to do their dirty work as usual.
@WalidPhares @RaymondArroyo international community must support people of #Iran to change their government‚Äôs foreign policies, and especially in Middle East where the regime funds the terrorism.
@WalidPhares Barack #Obama had to do that from the beginning before he made that awful deal with the regime.

@halone @JZarif so he tweeted a wise tweet because he said a lot of lies and tried to play the victim there! nice try.
@niloofar__s @JZarif yes, like stop feeding terrorists and training them.
@JZarif so US is destabilizing the world and #Iran not? ü§≠üòÇ	quit as FM and try to work as a comedian LOL.
@JZarif those arms exports are only to stop your regime‚Äôs aggressive operations in Middle East. 	so stop accusing others of your country‚Äôs actions.
@JZarif evidence say that the attack on 9/11 was planned by your regime, not #SaudiArabia. Just don‚Äôt deny it anymore.
@ChrisMurphyCT you‚Äôve been criticized the coalition‚Äôs present, not a word about Iranian‚Äôs !!!!	I‚Äôm wondering which side you‚Äôre taking!
@Desert_Vox @PressTV to thank terrorists? are you out of your mind?
@PressTV not Yemeni forces, they‚Äôre Houthi forces who launched the failed attack.
@WalidPhares does it surprise you to see terrorists upset about #MBS‚Äôs new strategy!!
@WalidPhares the big question is what does Iranian regime want from #Syria?? new base for terrorism?
@mohdsalj it‚Äôs not surprising that #Saudi Arabia is helping #Yemen to surpass its humanitarian crisis, a crisis that classified as the world‚Äôs worst crises in history.	shame on Houthis.
@mohdsalj no one can deny the Saudi‚Äôs efforts to help #Yemen to survive its misery that was caused by Houthis and their ally, Iranian regime.
@mohdsalj as always, #SaudiArabia supports their brothers, the Yemenis, from the humanitarian crisis that made by Houthis &amp; Iranian regime.

@ICRC Houthis were trying to put their hands on the port to control all shipments and aids in order to make more suffering.
@ICRC yeah because Houthis will use any opportunity they see to make more damages among innocents people.
@SenFeinstein #Saudi-led coalition and US aren‚Äôt bombing civilians there, Houthis are. 		you need to support the Yemeni legitimate government to win against radical militants who have #Iran‚Äôs support.

@TulsiGabbard if you do so, Houthis &amp; Iranian agents will control the whole country and make it a failure state.
@TulsiGabbard you can‚Äôt ignore Houthis‚Äô actions there against innocents who suffered their attacks.
@TulsiGabbard and who prevent the humanitarian aids to reach Yemenis? Houthis for sure. 	they try to block the aids and sell it to the people or give it for free for those who support them.
@davidicke no way the coalition will allow Houthis to control the port with all humanitarian aids that arrive there.
@TulsiGabbard are you ignoring Houthis‚Äô roles in attacking innocents by Iranian missiles?
@TulsiGabbard why you didn‚Äôt mention #Iran‚Äôs role in #Yemen in escalating the war there by providing weapons and missiles to Houthis!!
@repmarkpocan US needs to protect its interests in Middle East, and helps its allies there, therefore it supports the coalition‚Äôs operations in #Yemen where it fight against Houthis and Iranian regime.
@repmarkpocan @justinamash @RepRoKhanna @RepThomasMassie @RepBarbaraLee @RepWalterJones @RepTedLieu @RepMcGovern @RepJayapal @keithellison @RepRaulGrijalva remember that if you allowed to Houthis to control the port, you‚Äôll put an end for #Yemen‚Äôs future.

@waheedparker @FaisalbinFarhan @mohdsalj to be specific, the coalition are targeting only Houthis who attacked the legitimate government and its people. 	you can‚Äôt deny that Houthis tried to over take the country by force!!

@waheedparker @FaisalbinFarhan @mohdsalj I‚Äôll give you two reasons:	1. Saudis are protecting their borders from Houthis &amp; Iranian attacks. 	2. they responded to Yemeni legitimate government‚Äôs request to help it against Houthis militants. 		and UN is aware of every move made by coalition.
@khamenei_ir what about your regime‚Äôs issues? yours did interfere in others‚Äô affairs in region and support terrorists attacks and operations.
@waheedparker @FaisalbinFarhan @mohdsalj nope, Houthis target children and women to make it as coalition did that.

@RoKhanna do you consider Yemenis‚Äô suffering from Iran-backed Houthis‚Äô attacks?		you should support your administration in its plans in #Yemen.
@RoKhanna in #Yemen civil wars, Houthis -with Iran help- are using civilians as human shields, ignoring all international laws.
@RoKhanna US and its allies in Middle East are helping Yemenis by protecting and giving them humanitarian aids, while #Iran and Houthis making the situation more worse than ever.
@BREAKING_PTV I don‚Äôt know why you insist on spreading fake news while everyone else knows the truth?
@iyad_elbaghdadi the same goes for Iranian women unless the regime has another opinion.
@iyad_elbaghdadi biggest fear! really?	Saudi women has the right to wear their headscarves or not, it‚Äôs their choice.
@AhmadAlgohbary Houthis‚Äô boats? if yes, then I doubt they‚Äôre fishing.
@UNReliefChief Houthis broke their promises in allowing access of humanitarian aids to Yemenis, they blocked the aids in order to sell them and use the money for their operations.
@PressTV are you going to blame Saudis for that too?
@guardian key agents who work for foreign organizations that aim to destabilize #Saudi Arabia.
@charliekirk11 who funded and trained 9/11 terrorists is #Iran. 	we agree some of them were Saudis but they were against Saudi Arabia.
@RandPaul arms race? your country has been threatened by Iranian regime that chants for ‚Äúdeath to America‚Äù, it‚Äôs clear US administration will stand with its allies to combat Iranian danger.
@ramprasad_c #Iran has beheaded thousands of innocents, if #SaudiArabia will use it position, it will sanction Iranian regime but that‚Äôs not easy to do.
@hibahastam @noornymar @Babak_1992 @SecPompeo @PahlaviReza we know that Iran used the money it got from #IranNuclearDeal to fund and support its radical activities and militants. people didn‚Äôt have any access to that money.

@SecPompeo I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs #iran goal after its plans to destabilize the region and run its nuclear program!!
@RoKhanna so you want to see Yemen controlled by terrorists like Iranians and Houthis? do you even care about Yemenis? their future?
@State28Progress @RoKhanna US wants to protect its interests in Middle East so it shares the same values with its allies there to counter the Iranian aggression.
@RoKhanna yes, Saudis alongside UAE are caring about Yemen‚Äôs future and they want to make sure it won‚Äôt fall in militias hands.
@RandPaul so Saudis are the problematic actor in ME? seriously!!	so how do you describe Iran‚Äôs roles there?
@RandPaul okey what‚Äôs going to happen later if you succeed to stop the arms sales? will #Iran stop its activities in Middle East? will Houthis stop their attacks on civilians in Yemen?	you can‚Äôt guarantee that because you know it won‚Äôt happen.
@RandPaul do you know what‚Äôs going in Middle East? do you know a country called #Iran? do you know what‚Äôs its roles there?
@cafreeland every country has the rights to defend its security and stability. 	even #Canada will do the same if someone poses a threat to its own security.
@cafreeland in other words, they‚Äôre traitors üëéüèº
@cafreeland there‚Äôs no peaceful activist among them, they planned with foreign groups to destabilize the country in specific affairs.
@DrJillStein GCC countries and UN did send humanitarian aids to Yemen but Houthis blocked the ways and attacked humanitarian workers.
@DrJillStein it‚Äôs obvious US administration and its allies trying to secure the region and prevent the danger of Iran to reach Yemenis and their future.
@DrJillStein actually he‚Äôs right.	Iran has supported and funded all conflicts in Middle East and even encouraged terrorists groups to even involve into those wars.
@DrJillStein I don‚Äôt understand your point of view, with all evidences that Iran has been the biggest sponsor of terrorism and destruction in Middle East, you still defending the regime??
@DrJillStein so you‚Äôre saying #Iran isn‚Äôt posing a threat to world‚Äôs security and safety? the #IranNuclearDeal is limiting the danger of Iran regime?	nonsense!!
@KenRoth who told you they don‚Äôt have lawyers? they‚Äôre being under investigation so no body have access to them but their lawyers.
@BenjaminNorton there‚Äôs no point of that while Saudi Arabia is the most country donates food and humanitarian aids. 	then it‚Äôs not correct that Saudis target food sites.
@BenjaminNorton wrong. 	Houthis tried to starve Yemenis in order to establish their goals like blaming Saudis for chaos in Yemen.
@apmoorehead #SaudiArabia don‚Äôt need these PRs because its efforts to establish peace and stability have been admitted by all countries expect the ones that don‚Äôt want to see peace in Middle East.
@markcurtis30 you never mentioned Iran-made missiles that killed thousands of innocents in Yemen over the last 3 years.

@PressTV #Saudi Arabia cares about safety of its people and guests, and it investigated what happened and made sure it won‚Äôt happen again.
@KabirTaneja those traitors you mentioned are people who stab their country from the back and disappointed their followers.
@KabirTaneja why‚Äôd he have serious troubles? I see it from another aspect! people will praise him because of his reforming efforts that end a lot of corruption and betraying.
@charliekirk11 #Iran has been headed thousands of innocents just because of they expressed their needs and asked the government to stop its aggressive policies in region.
@charliekirk11 total and complete evil?	first, your tweet full of lies.	second, why you didn‚Äôt tweet about the crackdown against innocents Iranian people by their regime?
@charliekirk11 where‚Äôs your sources? show me some links that talk about your claims? 		you need to check your sources before tweeting fake news!

@Joyce_Karam @Heritage finally we saw a tough American Secretary State who‚Äôll stop the Iranian regime‚Äôs radical activities.
@WalidPhares + Iranian regime doesn‚Äôt decide for Iranian people‚Äôs future.
@WalidPhares funny, since when the regime thinks of others‚Äô life!! they decide for themselves without caring about others.
@JZarif you acted like you‚Äôre committed 100% to the deal while you actually used it as a cover for its activities.
@JZarif your regime used the deal for its own agendas in funding terrorist organizations and prevent Iranians from having any advantages.
@SecPompeo I don‚Äôt think Iranian regime‚Äôs dictators will understand the American message, in fact they are aiming to ignore all international laws and commitments.
@SecPompeo Iranian regime doesn‚Äôt care about any deal or commitments, they don‚Äôt even care about their own people‚Äôs future. 	the international community should help the Iranian people and save them from their brutal regime.
@SecPompeo @Heritage #Iran must not get nuclear weapons or develop ballistic missiles because if it did then it‚Äôll be used against countries in region in the first place then it‚Äôll attack US facilities in Middle East.
@SecPompeo Iranian regime took advantages of the deal to support its radical actions in Middle East and fund all terrorist operations that launched against innocents people.
@SecPompeo Iranian people are the victims of their country‚Äôs regime that used its economy to support terrorists groups.
@SecPompeo @POTUS Totally agree üëåüèº. 	#IranDeal didn‚Äôt secure US‚Äôs interests in region.
@AJEnglish @hrw is looking for anything that supports the Iranian agendas, but they didn‚Äôt praise what Saudis did to protect their country.

@AhmadAlgohbary don‚Äôt forget to mention that Saudi Arabia is hosting thousands of Yemenis who escaped Houthis‚Äô aggression.
@AhmadAlgohbary and who displaced them? Houthis did when they took over the country and launched a war against the government and its people.
@AhmadAlgohbary #SaudiArabia and UAE are sending humanitarian aids weekly under UN supervision.
@AhmadAlgohbary the whole humanitarian crisis were caused by Houthis who blocked all ways for aids to reach civilians in Yemen.

@RepRoKhanna #Iran regime is supporting terrorists groups in Yemen, Libya, Lebanon, Egypt, and Bahrain. US administration took the leadership to combat terrorism all over the region and gulf countries -except Qatar- are helping your country.
@RepRoKhanna try to say something that makes sense, Iranian regime helped Houthis to take down the legitimate government in Yemen and launched missiles attacks on civilians &amp; #SaudiArabia.
@RepRoKhanna each country has its own interests in region, even your country. Iran &amp; Houthis once targeted Americans ships and tried to blow them up, and you said #Saudis dragged it to civil war??

@LarrygHaynes3 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage they recruited Sunnis to blame them for their actions, simple fact. 	also who says #Hamas and #Hezbollah never threatened USA??? most of terrorist operations launched by any groups #Iran supports.
@rob8211 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage ask him @khamenei_ir 	he‚Äôll explain to you how his agents did that.
@SandraVona @colmjocarroll @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage Obviously their regime‚Äôs forcing them to do that. https://t.co/CWFTestgrI
@LarrygHaynes3 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage of course he does ‚ò∫Ô∏è Iranian regime has been the biggest sponsor of terrorism for decades and still.
@SebastienYC_FR @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage he didn‚Äôt have the evidences like Trump administration do, but now the world knows for sure that Iranian regime is behind all terrorist operations.
@LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage who trained and funded those 19 terrorists in 9/11? #Iran did https://t.co/PM3hKETBlE
@AhmadAlgohbary I agree, some media ignored the crisis in #Yemen to cover up Houthis‚Äô roles there in blocking humanitarian aids and killing aids workers and innocents.
@CAATuk investigate itself!! who told you it committed war crimes in #Yemen? all great powers admitted the Saudi‚Äôs efforts to establish peace there.
@rulajebreal modernize the country doesn‚Äôt mean stop killing terrorists and killers!!
@RichardDawkins why? for doing what‚Äôs best for the world!! for eliminating terrorists?
@BrookingsInst terrorists want revenge!! their leader is responsible for many deaths of children and women in #Yemen. 	he‚Äôs also responsible for what happened to Yemen after he allies with #Iran.
@LeandraCme @snarwani ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your award‚Äù ü§î	there‚Äôs huge difference between ‚Äúhere‚Äôs‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúhe‚Äôs‚Äù, I can teach you the basics if you want üòô.
@LeandraCme @snarwani I win. ‚úåüèºüòù
#IranDeal allowed the regime to gain money and powers that used for starting wars and proxies, funding terrorism and terrorists groups, supporting terrorists operations all over the region.
@LeandraCme @snarwani Iran is not interfering in Morocco‚Äôs affairs? the brutal regime is not interfering? you mean the biggest state of supporting terrorism is not interfering there??
@PressTV no sudanese officials confirm your claim!! which means it‚Äôs a fake one.
@Fat_hiSaid @PressTV is that how Houthis threaten peaceful Yemenis?
@AJEnglish #Saudi Arabia is standing with people of Palestinian, unlike #Qatar who supports Hamas, the terrorist group.
@snarwani does Morocco say it took orders from Saudi Arabia?
@snarwani so you want Morocco praises #Iran‚Äôs interfering in its internal affairs and welcomes it?
@foxandfriends @netanyahu Iranian regime have to stop its aggressive policies and cut its fundings for terrorism.
@foxandfriends @netanyahu he‚Äôs totally right, #Iran regime‚Äôs spreading destruction and chaos all over the region and Trump administration didn‚Äôt respond to its actions until this moment!!
@BenjaminNorton @AhmadAlgohbary Houthis won‚Äôt bomb one of their soldiers‚Äô wedding. 	or maybe they‚Äôd do it to blame saudis as usual.
@PressTV Iranians were beaten up by saudis üòÇ
@PressTV the world is willing to take down your regime and free the innocents Iranians who were tortured to live under your brutal regime.
@jricole when did he say that?
@DrAlakbarov some MPs came weeks ago to Saudi Arabia and witnessed the aggression that Houthis did to Yemenis. 		don‚Äôt blame UK or others for things they didn‚Äôt do.
@DrAlakbarov there‚Äôs no evidence until this moment that #SaudiArabia is targeting civilians in #Yemen 		it‚Äôs all rumors made by Houthis.
@CassandraRules are you preferring to have #Iran as an ally? or maybe #Hezbollah !!
@AJENews really? so now Americans are the one who destabilizing the region and making wars? and your regime is innocent?
@OrwellNGoode Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the one who‚Äôs protecting US &amp; UK interests in Middle East, both governments are respecting his efforts to establish peace there.
@jjz1600 #Hamas group ruined all political solutions to end the conflict, with help from #Iran of course.
@markcurtis30 complicated in a war crimes against terrorists, and I mean Houthis &amp; Iranian agents? yeah I‚Äôd cheer for them.
@tparsi #Saudi Arabia will always stay beside their Palestinians brothers and support their case to restore their land.
@marwanbishara you must know that these kind of reports are fake especially if there‚Äôs no confirmation form Saudi officials.
@AhmadAlgohbary are their any Houthis killed in that air strikes?
@AmirAminiMD you based your analysis on insured report, intelligent üëåüèº		weeks ago, #Saudis announced they‚Äôre still supporting the Palestinians against #Israel &amp; Trump‚Äôs decision to move the embassy.
@miss9afi your husband insulted #Islam, plus he impose his opinions on people and asked them to turn against the government and its laws.
@MGee8600 @khamenei_ir no one because there‚Äôs NONE.
@BarakRavid @axios @news10 he didn‚Äôt say it publicly, which means it‚Äôs a fake report as most of the time.
@khamenei_ir wherever your regime entered, it created instability and chaos, it also brought misery and sadness to people, that‚Äôs why US &amp; #SaudiArabia will end your regime‚Äôs present in region forever.
@khamenei_ir seriously??	so you‚Äôre saying your regime did nothing wrong in region??		US is the power that will end your brutal regime.
@khamenei_ir when will your regime stop its interfering in #Yemen, #Lebanon, and #Iraq? 		let the world lives in peace without your aggressive policies in Middle East.
@khamenei_ir your regime‚Äôs goal is to make Muslims fight each other, to destabilize the whole region, to spread chaos everywhere.
@Bahebbaq @SallahAmadou @PressTV you said it, it was fragments not a direct missile.
@KenRoth you can blame Houthis &amp; Iranians for that, they started a civil war against Yemeni legitimate government.
@PeterTatchell are you repeating your old tweet?
@Independent a move that will cost the region a lot if Iranian regime used that for its interest.
@nytimesworld next time publish real statement. 		Pompeo didn‚Äôt say anything about #Qatar crisis and sided with #Saudi about #Yemen
@tedlieu my dear Ted Lieu, #Saudi Crown Prince did not say that fake claim, so please make sure of what you say before publish it.
@AJENews I don‚Äôt think #German will take this choice because it‚Äôll allow Iranian regime to continue its policies in Middle East.
@AJENews all thanks to #Iran who made Houthis coup against their country and launching a war against their legitimate government.
@SallahAmadou @PressTV Houthis can‚Äôt even know how to use them!! I guess they blowed up themselves several times.
@PressTV those are Iranian missiles launched to target #Saudi Arabia!!	I guess that called ‚Äòstarting a war‚Äù!!
@Chellaney after hearing Pompeo‚Äôs statement in #Riyadh, are you still thinking he delivered a tough message to #Saudis? üòÇ
@DailySabah did he really say that? I mean the thing about #Qatar?		no peace will be achieved with Qatar as long as it supports terrorists groups.
@dadmehr_d @DailySabah yeah gulf countries, there‚Äôs no such thing called Persian there.
@ibrahim_moh9900 @weinbergersa when did USA admitted that it‚Äôs launching a war against #Yemen??		it did say it‚Äôll counter the Iranian regime exists in region.
@KenRoth reforming means to end corruption and funding for terrorism. 		#SaudiArabia is heading to new era where justice is one of the proprieties.
@AJENews funny guys, enjoy the rumors üòÇ.
@KenRoth when did he say that? I didn‚Äôt hear it when he told his statement to press. 		you‚Äôre repeating unknown report that was published in @nytimes.
RT @StateDept: Secretary Pompeo: Saudi Arabia's security is a priority for the United States. We'll continue to work closely with our Saudi‚Ä¶
RT @StateDept: Secretary Pompeo: Muslim majority countries must take the lead in combatting terrorism and radicalization around the world..‚Ä¶
@yarotrof no proves that Pompeo said that, it came out from unknown source and he didn‚Äôt mention that in his statement in front of the media.
@PressTV does #Iran have women-only gyms?
@Cirincione is there any prove that whatever targeted the wedding was by US missiles? 	of course not because the case is  still under investigation.
@LotteLeicht1 #Iran is beheading a lot more and no one is mentioning that!!
@DailySabah you‚Äôre really focusing on #Saudi women‚Äô news! just like Qatari media üòèü§î		what about trying to cover the situation in #Iran?
@DrZuhdiJasser @loladeantonia26 there‚Äôs no such thing called Wahhabism, it‚Äôs something #Iran create to blame someone for its actions in Middle East.
@DrZuhdiJasser keep your sarcasm for yourself please!		we don‚Äôt really know if those 48 were terrorists or not, plus we don‚Äôt even know it the report was fake or not!!
@ibrahim_moh9900 @weinbergersa don‚Äôt blame USA for your actions that caused Yemenis a lot of suffering and misery.
and Houthis are a toy used by #Iran üòè https://t.co/nmAWDdQ4kK
@weinbergersa both of #UAE and #Saudi Arabia are having a great relationship and acting together for their joint interests. 	it doesn‚Äôt matter who assassinate that terrorist as long they‚Äôre working together üëçüèº
@IntheNow_tweet it‚Äôs his thoughts, you don‚Äôt need to agree with everything he says!!		are you upset because #Iran will lose its proxy if US keeps its support for #Saudi-led coalition?
@nntaleb it‚Äôs his opinion, you may disagree with him but you should respect his point of view. 		for me, I‚Äôd say stopping arms sells would allow Iranian regime to extend its present in #Yemen.
@BaFana3 @POTUS @Raytheon you claims based on local media? üòÇ	seriously!!		do you think Houthis will condemn themselves? he‚Äôll no they won‚Äôt.
@NRC_Egeland we can do something, like calling to stop aids blocking by Houthis, providing weapons by #Iran.
@aliShihabi it doesn‚Äôt matter, they‚Äôre working together. 		they succeeded in eliminating one of their terrorism‚Äôs wanted list. üëçüèΩ
@miss9afi #Saudi is changing, but not ignoring its principles.
@AhmadAlgohbary you‚Äôre wasting your time because you‚Äôre on the wrong side!!	don‚Äôt ally with Houthis, the terrorists, and look at the big picture.
@piersmorgan still upset because you didn‚Äôt interview #Saudi Crown Prince? üòÇ	just move on lol üòÜ
@Dr_Ulrichsen #Saudi Arabia &amp; #UAE are working as one unity, #MikePompeo ‚Äôs trip to Middle East and not visiting UAE doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt go there later.
@AJEnglish there‚Äôs no way you guys can compare between #Saudi Arabia and the Iranian regime who‚Äôs making proxies all over the region.
@stranahan no #Saudi official sources confirmed that claim!!		@hrw has many activists who‚Äôre against #Saudi Arabia, so these kind of claims aren‚Äôt surprising.
@lloyd_rm @LRB Iran is giving Houthis deadly weapons, no condemnation yet!!
@snarwani so killing terrorists is radicalism!!	is that your point of view?
@BenjaminNorton the claimed incident is still under investigation, wait till the truth comes to light. 		if it wasn‚Äôt fake report, I‚Äôm sure Houthis targeted it.
@AJEnglish is that your way to confess the world that #Iranian regime is strong? üòÇ		we all know that #Iran can‚Äôt win a direct war  if happened.
@hdagres #Saudi Arabia don‚Äôt mind to cooperate with #Iran if it stops its aggressive policies in region and cut its support of terrorism.
@PeterTatchell @Obey___ simply because they didn‚Äôt do war crimes in #Yemen, but Houthis &amp; #Iran did.
@theIRC @DMiliband and who blocked the aids to reach Yemenis?? Houthis. 		UN must do something before we lose the civilians there.
@tedlieu if you really depend on those sources as you said, then you should condemn Iranian regime‚Äôs roles in Yemen. 		the regime has killed thousands of innocents there without and condemnation from you, senator!!
@KenRoth Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to change #Saudi Arabia, but anyone insults Islam and challenges the laws will get punished.
@KenRoth correction:	he called #Saudi king Salman, not the Crown Prince!		don‚Äôt misleading your followers next time.
@RT_com are you kidding?	you can‚Äôt fool anyone with that lie!!		#Iran, your regime, aims to control the region with your aggressive policies.
@DrJillStein FYI, the ones who reported the attack are Houthis, got it?	they targeted the wedding party to blame #SaudiArabia and get the international community‚Äôs attention.
@tedlieu wait a sec, your source is Qatari one!!	they‚Äôre allying with Iranian regime who‚Äôs fighting Yemeni legitimate government and #SaudiArabia in #Yemen
@mehdirhasan @theintercept war criminals are #Iran &amp; their ally Houthis, alongside Assad‚Äôs regime.
@CarolineLucas but there‚Äôs no proof till this moment that #SaudiArabia targeted the wedding party!!	keep in mind maybe Houthis did that.
@CarolineLucas The crisis caused by Iranian regime &amp; Houthis, so it‚Äôs normal to aids the #Saudis to restore peace there in #Yemen
@AndrewBlackmer @hennyh53 @AhmadAlgohbary they‚Äôre killing innocents children and women, do you want us to support them!!!
@hennyh53 @AhmadAlgohbary it‚Äôs clear, iran provided missiles to militants in Yemen to target innocents and blame someone else. that regime aims to destabilize the whole region in order to control it.
@AhmadAlgohbary you‚Äôre trying to manipulate the people with your claims but guess what, no one will listen because they know the truth.
@AhmadAlgohbary Houthis won‚Äôt bomb a wedding belongs to one of their supporters. 	simple fact!!
@AJEnglish who blockade what???	no way you guys can confess the people about your lies and claims. 	Houthis are the ones who blocked all aids and every means to help Yemenis.
@business because it‚Äôs a new step for #Saudis, especially for those who‚Äôs never watched a move in cinema, yes they would pay that price.
@PressTV wow? when? in Houthis‚Äô fantasy?		they can‚Äôt even aim at one target correctly üòÇ
@WWE @WWENetwork new journey for #WWEStars to be in a new place like #SaudiArabia.	hope they &amp; audiences have fun.
@BenjaminNorton @nikkihaley @USUN wow!! so you‚Äôre defending the Iranian regime at the expense of innocents in #Yemen!!! 	shame on you.
RT @nikkihaley: RT @USUN : ‚ÄúTo achieve peace in Yemen, Iran must stop its interference and its violations of the arms embargo.‚Äù https://t.c‚Ä¶
that‚Äôs right, no peace will be achieved until #Iran stops its aggression. https://t.co/H8WwveDMk0
@nikkihaley @USUN if the regime didn‚Äôt stop its policies? what‚Äôll be next? launching a war against #Iran?		I hope yes.
@GeorgeMonbiot civilians who‚Äôre stucked in civil wars are the real victims. 	which hurts me is seeing the Iranian regime continue its aggressive policies in region by arming the Houthis who keep killing the innocents there.
@PressTV killing a terrorist who ordered to kill innocents is must. 	#Iran should stop providing weapons to Houthis in order to end the civil war immediately.
@innercitypress @Shuaibalmosawa @farissaeedtaiz @teddy_cat1 @SaadAbedine he should condemn Houthis‚Äô Attack on that wedding which costed innocents lives.
@RichardWellings but there‚Äôs no mention of Houthis‚Äô attacks on civilians there in #Yemen!!	that‚Äôs weird, don‚Äôt you agree?
@RichardWellings there‚Äôs a possible chance that Houthis were behind the attack on that wedding party.
they‚Äôre reporting from @AJEnglish üòÇ told you weak source of information. https://t.co/XOnffzIv83
@Liam_O_Hare will you condemn the Iranian regime who killed innocents in #Yemen?
@Liam_O_Hare you trust one of @AJEnglish reporters, which is the wrong move you made. 		those reporters are only seeking for misleading the audiences by their agendas.
@ZaidZamanHamid you‚Äôll see them on Wednesday and then it‚Äôll be too late to recognize that your claims were based on weak sources, the qatari ones.
@Ndawsari you mean son of Houthis‚Äô leader?	so no plans to withdrawal their forces and leave #Yemen to its people!!	too bad üíî
@Ndawsari it‚Äôll have a big impact on Houthis especially his death will led to eliminate all militants in near future.
@AliAlAhmed_en @AlArabiya_Eng @UN @UN_DPA he‚Äôs a terrorist, who managed some terrorist operations. 	plus, the legitimate government praised the attack that killed him as one more step to defeat terrorism in #Yemen
@AliAlAhmed_en @BBCWorld @UKinSaudiArabia @FCOArabic @FCOHumanRights this‚Äôs how it happened: find a place to bomb and get the world‚Äôs attention, then bomb it and take pictures of victims, after that tell pro- Iran press that #Saudis are behind the attack. 		Houthis are pathetic to use innocents for their goals.
@ggreenwald it‚Äôs so funny that everything Houthis do in #Yemen become #Saudis‚Äô act üòÇ	is that Houthis‚Äô way to get some attention from international community!!		it‚Äôs useless as long #Iranian regime helping them.
@MaxAbrahms #Iran is making the situations there in #Syria &amp; #Yemen much worse than ever. 	it supports terrorists militants and funds them by money and weapons.
@OwenJones84 there‚Äôs no proof till this moment that it was destroyed by #Saudis, it may be by Houthis to blame #Saudi as always.
@Harryslaststand do you think UK government will believe any report that come from nowhere!!	trust me if all governments do act based on fake reports then wars won‚Äôt end.
@MaxAbrahms ‚Äúhealth officials said‚Äù ü§î	who‚Äôre those!! there‚Äôs no names which make this report suspicious!!
@BrentToderian @RiyadhTransport @ArRiyadh_ADA @humantransit @grescoe @MassTransitmag @sustrans @SPUR_Urbanist @Richard_Florida this‚Äôs how to develop you country and give the people everything they may need, not like in #Iran where the regime shuts down all applications and prevent its people to communicate with outside. https://t.co/VRuxzwKouS
@AlexEmmons do you want them to admit fake facts? is that your way to support those pathetic reports made by pro #Iran!
@AlexEmmons wrong!	US is trying to protect its interests in #Yemen and counter the Iranian present there.
@NRC_Egeland I don‚Äôt know why Iranian missiles were targeting innocents on wedding party!! 	shame on Houthis and their ally.
@OxfamYemen it seems Houthis don‚Äôt want a political solution as they got orders from #Iran to kill anyone tries to help civilians.
@IraqiSecurity looks like you cannot report one correct claim. 	how taking down a toy drone becomes a terrorist attack üòÇ.
@JSchanzer you know why?	because Iranian agents are among those activities, they can‚Äôt condemn a regime that pay their salaries.
RT @JSchanzer: Also, I‚Äôm curious why we don‚Äôt see a broad condemnation of Iran‚Äôs proxy war in Yemen from these groups. The evidence of Iran‚Ä¶
@JSchanzer you‚Äôre right, Iranian regime should stop its proxies over the region
@_malbayati @evilepicface1 @ZaidZamanHamid I don‚Äôt see them! all I see is true leaders who care about their citizens and other people.
@rulajebreal anyone can see the real picture here by knowing the source who tell the story, Qataris are faking facts just to claim that saudis are against the government üòÇ		are #Iran @ #Qatar so desperate to create this show üòÇü§î
@Cairo67Unedited since when Qataris have become a trusted source üòÇ		Check the media &amp; press again.
@_malbayati @evilepicface1 @ZaidZamanHamid are you saying in next years terrorists will protect the two holy mosques? üòÇ		what about to letting them control the world.
@danishevskiy31 @ZaidZamanHamid Coup üòÇüòÇ 	you‚Äôre so funny üòÜ 		tell me what happened with that coup you‚Äô said about? I‚Äôm interested.
@ZaidZamanHamid no one can ever dare to attack #KingSalman or his Crown Prince #Mohammad bin Salman. 	#SaudiArabia is safe &amp; secure country, unlike that regime &gt; üáÆüá∑
@FullSteam15 @UrDSU @IraqiSecurity very fake one üòè.
@IraqiSecurity your source is weak, make sure next time to bring a good source üòù.
@AliAlAhmed_en @USAinKSA it‚Äôs a no fly-zone, so obviously security forces will take down anything suspicious.
@AliAlAhmed_en @GhanemAlmasarir @KingSalman @ForeignAffairs your sources are enough to tell it‚Äôs a lie üòÇüòÇüòÇ. 	try harder my friend.
@BenjaminNorton anyone can write a fake report and says: ‚Äúaccording to residents‚Äù. 	this‚Äôs not professional.
@markcurtis30 even in #Yemen, UK should sanction the Iranian regime for helping Houthis there.
@Francescorocca @ICRC_ye do you think Houthis militants will understand what does ‚Äúhumanitarians are #NotaTarget‚Äù mean?	I guess the answer is no.
@WHOYemen #Yemen suffered too much, we shouldn‚Äôt allow it to fall in hands of Iranian regime or Houthis.
@StylianidesEU @ICRC shame on Houthis üíî. 	is that the way how to treat people who helping innocents!!
@PressTVPrograms Houthis are the one who don‚Äôt want political solution üòè.
@riskparty63 I hope you enjoy your staying there and see the new #Saudi Arabia where all people can live together peacefully.
@ericgkelsey @stephenkalin @SarahDadouch there‚Äôre no ban on movies in #SaudiArabia , only cinemas.
@ICRC Gulf countries are helping Yemenis but all aids were blocked by Houthis and Iranian agents!!
@MikeGapes @bbcquestiontime it‚Äôs all war crimes caused by Syrian &amp; Iranian regimes. 	international community must act against them as as soon as possible.
@MikeGapes so you‚Äôre saying that #Russia and #Iranian regime are making the situation in both #Syria &amp; #Yemen much worse!!
@MikeGapes I agree with you, but look at the common force there, it is the Iranian regime!!
@AliAbunimah is there any UAE official announced it‚Äôll participate with Israel Air Force? or is it another fake report?
@StateDept @UN @USEmbassyYemen @USUN I hope they discussed the Iranian role in blocking aids and causing the humanitarian crisis.
@BaFana3 weak source!! 	is that kind of your sources which you come up everyday?
@mhdksafa me too, Syrian &amp; Iranian regime‚Äôs made the worse crisis in the world in both #Syria &amp; #Yemen
@RawyaRageh so Houthis torture, kill, and kidnap Yemenis! and with Iranian help!	this civil conflict went beyond humanity.
@AhmadAlgohbary @jeremycorbyn @tedlieu you‚Äôre happy because they didn‚Äôt mention the support of Iranian regime. 	you know what, it doesn‚Äôt matter what they‚Äôre saying, Trump administration knows the whole situation in #Yemen, that‚Äôs why it supports #Saudus.
@DailySabah you‚Äôre repeating their news üòÇ &gt;&gt; @PressTV 	try to find a good fake one next time.
@SamWalton there‚Äôs no proof that UK‚Äôs forces caused that destruction!!	sometimes we should think it MAY BE caused by Iranian missiles üòè.
@RoKhanna do you have anything to say about #Iran negative roles in Middle East which caused civil conflicts, wars, migration and tragedies!!
@RepRoKhanna the only common enemy in the two crisis is #Iran. 	Iranian regime is supporting both Syrian regime &amp; Houthis to attack and kill their own people!!!	US administration must stop that regime‚Äôs aggressive policies in region.
@SenToddYoung @ForeignPolicy we can alleviate #Yemen crisis by cut the Iranian regime aids to Houthis.	#Iran has been the biggest supporter of the civil war there.
@RandPaul you need to mention #Iran‚Äôs policies in #Yemen too.
@DanCardenMP while you supporting one of the Iranian agents, go to #SaudiArabia and by yourself the lies behind what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen. 	#Iran-backed Houthis are attacking innocents children &amp; women and blaming the #Saudi-led coalition.
@PeterStefanovi2 @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may but saudis tried to help yemenis unlike Iran-backed Houthis. 	@jeremycorbyn is a friend of #Iran‚Äôs regime so he‚Äôll fight to ensure that his terrorists allies will be safe from any strikes.
@Harryslaststand Iranian regime is supporting the civil war there by giving weapons and money to Houthis who‚Äôre torturing &amp; killing the innocents people in #Yemen
@Harryslaststand do you really know what‚Äôs happening in #Yemen? 	do you know who‚Äôre the conflict‚Äôs parties?	I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a wise man so be sure to know what‚Äôs happening there before you judge.
@AhmadAlgohbary is that the Houthis‚Äô daily report? üòÇ	I advise you not to misleading whoever read your tweets.
@mattzarb @jeremycorbyn is an Iranian agent, so no surprising he went against the air strikes on Syrian regime and asks for bombing #Saudi Arabia
@AhmadAlgohbary @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may @EmmanuelMacron why you satisfied with #iran intervening in#Yemen?	why Houthis are killing Yemenis by orders from Iranian regime?	why you defend the aggressive role of Iran in region?
@USUN the American administration knows how dangerous is #Iran but when it‚Äôll act against the regime?
the question is, who‚Äôs gonna stop #Iran? https://t.co/Elj9FQ2Aeq
@SenToddYoung your ambassador said #Iran is the one who destabilize the region by its aggressive policies and missiles which were given to Houthis. https://t.co/IDRrjNnxJK
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen @SenatorCollins @ChrisCoons did you senators consider the Iranian regime‚Äôs role in #Yemen where it pushes the civil war forward and uses the Houthis to attack #SaudiArabia.
@tcwittes Arabs are united, and latest summit that took place days ago in #Saudi Arabia proved that. 	#Egypt won‚Äôt take backward steps for stability in region as #Qatar did.
@LauraLoomer @POTUS has advisers for a reason, to think with him about future moves. 	we don‚Äôt have to agree with him 100%, but for sure he‚Äôll do his best for his great country.
@LauraLoomer this‚Äôs the problem with #FakeNews that media spreads. 	no one said #Iran is the one to blame for 9/11 attack, which‚Äôs true based on its terrorist operations that it funded.
@Cernovich wow, I guess this‚Äôs the most stupidest analysis I‚Äôve ever read. 		you didn‚Äôt mention #Iran‚Äôs aggressive role in #Yemen, does that make you a supporter for Iranian regime!!!!??????
@Osman_Marwa1 it‚Äôs so funny when you tries to manipulate facts and use that for your own agendas.
@illmatador @Hussam_h70 @Cernovich that case are based on lies, not evidences.
@Cernovich you‚Äôre telling fake facts!!	terrorists groups were Iranian agents who supported regimes like Syrian &amp; Iranian. 	#Saudis have nothing to do with 9/11, #Iran has. 	#US present in Middle East is must.
@KyleWOrton he‚Äôs repeating his Iranian ally speech!!	we all know that #Iran is the one who funded terrorists organizations, not #SaudiArabia
@ChrisHazzardSF do not mix all conflicts in Middle East, each country has the right to defend itself from terrorists groups like #Hamas in Palestinian or Iran-backed Houthis in #Yemen.
@DonteStallworth you never mentioned Iranian regime‚Äôs role in #Yemen, I‚Äôm wondering why!!		are you telling me that #Iran has nothing to do with civil war in there!??
#Yemen was being destroyed when #Iran entered it and helped Houthis to take over the country +3 years ago. 	US alongside with #Saudi Arabia are trying to protect the innocents there. https://t.co/ThZOcRwsuR
@PrisonPlanet won‚Äôt happen at all üòå. 	#Saudi Arabia will remain the strongest ally in Middle East for western countries.
@AhmadAlgohbary this‚Äôs the misleading information!!	even poor children used for their dirty propaganda. 	pro-Iran agents are in everywhere in #Yemen üíî
@MaxAbrahms In #Syria, Assad‚Äôs regime used chemical weapons against its own people. 	In #Yemen, #Iran is attacking Yemenis by supporting Houthis to do that. 		two faces for one coin.
@dancohen3000 @secupp any place #Iran involved in will be a disaster. 		if Iranian regime enters #America for example, trust me it‚Äôll never see the sun again.
@Cernovich saying facts has nothing to do with money!!	previous US administration told media that #Saudis didn‚Äôt plan 9/11 attack.
@Cernovich BTW, there‚Äôs no evidence that #Saudis were behind 9/11 attack, evidences showed the terrorists were in #Iran where they got trained &amp; funded.
@Cernovich people support #Saudi Arabia because it suffered a lot from terrorism, and they appreciate its positive role to fight terrorism and cut its fundings.
@AliAlAhmed_en @Tobias_Ellwood then international community must act ASAP against Houthis and Iranian regime who starvation #Yemen &amp; killed thousands of innocents.
@rulajebreal #Russia &amp; #Iranian regime are making the situation more difficult for all sides.

@khamenei_ir targeting military bases that used to launch the latest chemical attack IS NOT a war #crime. 	responding to the latest #chemical attack who killed innocents IS NOT a war crime. 		protecting the regime who killed its own people IS a war crime.
@khamenei_ir international community defeated #ISIS in #Syria &amp; #Iraq. 	your regime was trying to get there in order to save them for eliminated.
@khamenei_ir what a lie, all terrorist groups were raised in #Iran where they got trained &amp; funded. 		your regime is the one responsible for all wars in region.
