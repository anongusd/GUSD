Every single day we learn about a new crime or corrupt act committed by Donald Trump. Every day. Our last president was intelligent, ethical, and honest. The United States is America deserves so much better than this. #ImpeachTrump
Trump believes Kim Jong Un when he says he didn‚Äôt torture Otto Warmbier. He believes Putin when he says he didn‚Äôt meddle in our election. But he never believes his own intelligence officials.		Trump is working for foreign dictators and against the United States. #ImpeachTrump
After decades of shameful inaction, after thousands of innocent Americans killed, Democrats have led the House to finally pass the first meaningful #GunSafety legislation in years. It‚Äôs time for Republicans in the Senate to choose the people over their donors and pass the bills.
The #GunSafety bill just passed by House Democrats closes the very loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to massacre worshipers at a Charleston church in 2015. Every Senate Republican who fails to support it is spitting on the victims of that heinous massacre and their loved ones.
It‚Äôs obscene that after abusing the security clearance process and putting US secrets in jeopardy, the Trump Administration won‚Äôt willingly comply with Congressional oversight requests. We need to get these crooks out of the White House! #DrainTheSwamp
Today, Trump insults the family of #OttoWarmbier, who was brutally murdered by Kim Jong Un. Yesterday, Trump insulted our brave men and women in uniform. Which Americans will he turn on tomorrow? #TrumpResign
@JHenline Yeah... if you think your blind rage is going to intimidate us out of impeaching a criminal president, think again. We put country first.
@JHenline Lol I‚Äôd urge you to look up the definitions of the words ‚Äúlynching‚Äù and ‚Äúcoup‚Äù my friend
@JHenline Have you... heard of the Constitution?
@585Conservative Dude go read the bill. Nobody is taking guns away from anyone. You‚Äôre trying to generate fear about legislation without having any clue what the legislation does. You should ask yourself why lol
With #HR8, House Democrats have just passed some of the most impactful #GunSafety legislation in decades. This is a public safety emergency. Senate Republicans, it‚Äôs time to step up to the plate and protect your constituents!
@585Conservative @AOC As a Californian, I can assure California is anything but failing.		As for the green new deal, I‚Äôm curious how that has anything to do with power... unless you mean renewable energy! üòâ
@DMDesign101 I hope she‚Äôs not a criminal like the rest of them. I do wish she wouldn‚Äôt get up every morning and make it her mission to see how many lies she can tell to the American people!
Sarah Huckabee Sanders says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt comment on security clearances.‚Äù Apparently there‚Äôs an exception for lying to the American public about whether Trump gave one to #JaredKushner‚Äîover the objections of the CIA.
@JHenline I‚Äôm encouraging Republicans in Congress to put country before party. That‚Äôs all.
@JHenline LOL what?? üòÇüòÇ
Jared #Kushner has all sorts of shady ties to foreign governments, which is why the CIA wouldn‚Äôt give him a top secret security clearance‚Äîbut Trump gave him one anyways, and then lied about it to the American public. #ImpeachTrump
BREAKING: despite numerous public denials, Trump overrode the CIA‚Äôs recommendations and gave a top-secret clearance to Jared Kushner, so he could profit off classified information. #AnotherTrumpLie #ImpeachTrump
@gage_elton Sitting there tweeting* lol
@585Conservative Impeachment would expose one thing: that Democrats are the only party still looking out for the best interests of Americans and the nation.
We now know beyond doubt that Donald Trump both committed numerous crimes while in office, and directed others to commit crimes on his behalf. This is on top of #TrumpRussia collusion and flagrant corruption. It‚Äôs time to #ImpeachTrump.
Republicans in Congress were eager to hear #Cohen‚Äôs testimony when they thought he would exonerate Trump, defending his character and honesty. Just over a year later, they‚Äôre screaming that not a word out of his mouth can be trusted. The #GOP hypocrisy is stunning.
@jtpipkin75 These craven and power-hungry Republicans will continue to let Donald Trump rape our country until they think they might have to pay for it at the ballot box.
@noverdose He‚Äôs going to jail for it, so, yes.		Is he lying about Trump this time around? Most likely not.
It‚Äôs clear that Michael Cohen is the kind of person who will tell Congress whatever they want to hear. But to any impartial observer, it‚Äôs even more clear that the president of the United States is a criminal. #ImpeachTrump #CohenHearing
Donald Trump truly doesn‚Äôt know which end is up. The US faces real and increasingly sophisticated threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Meanwhile, Trump is obsessing over Venezuela, chasing Venezuelan Americans‚Äô votes. He is a national security menace. #TrumpResign
If Donald Trump truly knew, as Michael Cohen alleges, that his campaign staff was coordinating with WikiLeaks, he is guilty of #treason. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
After reading about his attempt to intimidate Michael Cohen out of testifying before Congress, I did a little digging and learned that @mattgaetz tried to have the parents of a Parkland shooting victim‚Äîa murdered child‚Äîejected from a House hearing on #GunControl. I have no words
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Wow. We‚Äôve learned a lot about what kind of person Michael Cohen is, and you‚Äôre clearly no better. I feel bad for the constituents who thought you‚Äôd be focused on solving their problems with dignity and honor.
BREAKING: The House of Representatives, led by a strong Democratic majority, voted overwhelmingly against Trump‚Äôs illegal #FakeEmergency power grab. It is now up to Senate Republicans to choose between defending the Constitution and defending Donald Trump.
@Cittizen1 I am not for any of those things except Medicare for all, if it can give people better healthcare at less cost (why wouldn‚Äôt anyone support that?)		It seems like you don‚Äôt actually know what Democrats stand for; maybe that would be a good place for you to start before you tweet.
@Cittizen1 Ok, why don‚Äôt you point out to me which specific parts of my politics are harmful to America
Republicans wanted to impeach Obama for giving Americans healthcare. They wanted to indict Hillary Clinton for working in the government during a terror attack. But when Trump colludes with Russia, obstructs justice, and ignores the Constitution? Deafening silence. #CorruptGOP
@Cittizen1 I‚Äôm thinking of all the Democratic officials in office right now and not coming up with any who match that description. Now Republicans, on the other hand... yikes! What are we going to do about all this corruption?
Trump‚Äôs panel to ‚Äúexamine‚Äù whether #ClimateChange is a national security threat (lol) includes a partisan hack who believes that science is a hoax. Republicans are paving the way for the destruction of humanity, and profiting off it on the way... #CorruptGOP
@Cittizen1 lol why‚Äôs that
@e92sam Oh Jesus.
Today 25 former lawmakers and 60 former senior national security officials, all Republicans, wrote a letter denouncing Trump‚Äôs illegal #FakeEmergency power grab. They come from a different era, when Republicans actually cared about the Constitution.
Even as Putin makes explicit and specific threats against the United States, Trump can‚Äôt bring himself to do anything about it. It‚Äôs as if he knows his election was thanks to Russia... #TrumpRussia
Donald Trump is undeniably making the United States more isolated and less safe. #ImpeachTrump #25thAmendment
Trump set his second show summit with Kim Jong Un for the same day Michael Cohen testifies to Congress. One can only assume Trump will make some sort of damaging concession to North Korea in an attempt to distract us from the #TrumpRussia testimony
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre probably the only American who would forget when the 4th of July is.
@JamisonNewland Exactly! They literally tell us what they‚Äôre up doing accusing other people of doing it...
Giving Congress exclusive authority over spending is one of the fundamental checks on the presidency designed by the founding fathers. Any Republicans who look the other way while Trump violates this American principle with his #FakeEmergency are helping him destroy our country.
It‚Äôs almost funny: Republicans love to scream about #VoterFraud, but they‚Äôre the ones committing it! I feel deeply for the people of North Carolina whose votes were changed by corrupt Republicans. What a horrific violation of their Constitutional rights.
It‚Äôs not election season, but an election has been ordered in North Carolina. Why? Because the Republican cheated, illegally collecting people‚Äôs ballots and changing their votes! #CorruptGOP
Trump is unwilling or unable to defend us against China‚Äôs increasingly dangerous cyberattacks because he‚Äôs desperate to end the trade war he started. He‚Äôs all over the place, and the only common theme among his decisions is that they hurt America. #SaveTheRepublic
@Cittizen1 Lol no it isn‚Äôt, because it is expressly illegal to let non-citizens register to vote in state and federal elections.		Democrats don‚Äôt hate America, buddy‚Äîyou just hate Democrats, and that‚Äôs your own problem.
@JamisonNewland I have to say, half the time I learn about a new Trump scandal it‚Äôs because he tweets out of blue denying the scandal. Certainly makes it easier for us to know what he‚Äôs up to!
Reminder: the Trump campaign sent polling data to Russian intelligence. They literally helped Putin refine his attack on our democracy and see if it was working. That is treason. #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump
‚ÄúMaster negotiator‚Äù Trump rejected Congress‚Äô border security package in December as insufficient, causing the #TrumpShutdown. When he got even less the second time around, he resorted to violating the Constitution and declaring a #FakeEmergency
Let me get this straight: Republicans deny Democrats their right to vote by claiming they‚Äôre fighting #VoterFraud. Meanwhile in North Carolina, Republicans are literally taking people‚Äôs absentee ballots and changing their votes. Holy crap. #CorruptGOP
@realDonaldTrump Looooooooooool
@realDonaldTrump oh man this is a dumb one....
@ninjaswat @realDonaldTrump Democratic*, but yes, you‚Äôre exactly right. The hypocrisy of the modern GOP is absolutely staggering...
The GOP must realize that their campaign of fear-mongering, distortions, and demonization hurts America‚Äôs national security by further polarizing our society. It‚Äôs time for the venom and lies to stop. #SaveTheRepublic https://t.co/u6F6Aa6K4e
@JHenline Lol yes. Really. 8 years of zero corruption, zero indictments, zero disgraces. What a different time we live in now...
It took about 2 weeks for Mitch McConnell to switch from defending the US Constitution to defending Trump‚Äôs #FakeEmergency power grab. He barely hesitated to sell American Democracy up the river in order to please Donald Trump.
During the 8 scandal-free years of the Obama Administration, Mitch McConnell‚Äôs shrill cries that Obama was somehow usurping Congress‚Äô authority were almost incessant. Fast forward to today, when he‚Äôs advising Trump on how to declare a #FakeEmergency to violate the Constitution.
With his #FakeEmergency declaration, Trump made clear that he is not interested in the Constitution or in democracy. He is motivated by only two things: power and racism. It‚Äôs time to #ImpeachTrump
Outraged House Republicans sued Obama in 2014 for spending billions of federal dollars without congressional approval ‚Äî and won. Now many House and Senate Republicans could side with Trump for doing what they saw as a grave abuse of power by Mr. Obama. -@nytimes #CorruptGOP
So bizarre how Trump loves to tell people that Obama was on the brink of war with North Korea‚Äîa total lie. The truth is that Trump is the only modern day president who has threatened war on North Korea. #25thAmendment
It is time for both Democratic and Republican members of Congress to unite as Americans, first by annulling Trump‚Äôs unconstitutional #FakeEmergency declaration and then by removing the offending politician from office. #ImpeachTrump
The real emergency is that we have a president who is using a fake national emergency to violate the Constitution and waste taxpayer dollars on a political gimmick Congress specifically said no to. #ImpeachTrump
Trump‚Äôs fake emergency declaration marks a distinct turn towards authoritarianism by his administration. It‚Äôs time to rid ourselves of this corrupt, illegitimate, and incompetent president as provided by the Constitution. #ImpeachTrump #25thAmendment
@Cittizen1 I actually doubt that
It‚Äôs actually pretty funny that Trump chose El Paso for his lie-o-Rama of a rally:	1. He got humiliated there in 2016‚Äî25% of the vote!	2. Crime was dropping steadily until they started building border fencing there in 2008	3. Crime rose slightly after the fencing	#BorderSecurity
@Cittizen1 So weird to me to think that there are people in this country who want their fellow countrymen to get screwed over, but oh well. 300 million people, you‚Äôre bound to get some angry ones.
@thelawanon Congress controls federal spending, and they gave an emphatic no to wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall. What does Trump do? Attempt to illegally circumvent Congress.
@Cittizen1 Congress has clearly said no to the wall. Seems like what‚Äôs happening here is that you just hate the Democrats...
Trump just delcared a fake emergency to achieve his political goals in violation of the Constitution. At this point, what would stop him from declaring martial law? We know it sure wouldn‚Äôt be the Republicans. #ImpeachTrump #TraitorGOP
Trump‚Äôs declaration of a fake emergency for political purposes marks the official transition of the Republican Party into authoritarianism. It‚Äôs time to #ImpeachTrump before they can totally destroy our democracy!
@angryshortguy And the irony is, those are all actually emergencies. Our border? Generally quiet on the southern front.
The only state of emergency in this country is that our illegitimately elected president is making an illegal power grab, seeking to subvert the Constitution and destroy our democracy. For the good of the nation, it‚Äôs time to #ImpeachTrump now.
@dawnkk1 Easily one of the most destructive figures in American history.
Reports are now coming out of the Senate that Trump plans to declare a fake emergency in order built his wall, in violation of the Constitution. If that happens, it will be time to #ImpeachTrump immediately. America WILL NOT become a dictatorship.
Trump is so miserably unfit for office that top Justice Department officials discussed whether to begin 25th amendment proceedings. That says all we need to know. #ImpeachTrump
As the effects of the #GOPtaxscam come into focus, millions of Americans are seeing their tax refunds drop or disappear. Republicans are stealing money from normal Americans to enrich themselves and their donors‚Äîbut don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre also bankrupting the country! #CorruptGOP
Trump claims that #SouthKorea is increasing its payments for US troops by $500 million. The actual number? $70 million. It‚Äôs just #AnotherTrumpLie to the American people.		(Possibly worse, he has no clue how many troops are actually stationed there!)
@585Conservative Is it ok? No. Do we have more important issues to be focusing on? Absolutely. Once we actually secure the border (fencing and sensors), we can make a one-time program that lets them get in line for a $1000 fee and not get deported. Boom! Non tax revenue. Win win.
@585Conservative Oh I understand. I also understand public safety, which is why I want law enforcement to prioritize removing immigrants who are actually dangerous, rather than wasting their time persecuting the millions who are hard working and otherwise law-abiding. Not a hard concept really.
Concerned about Democrats giving Republicans the chance to endanger the country by transferring DHS funds from critical missions to detention beds‚Äîbecause they will. Trump does not understand or care about national security; he cares about imprisoning immigrants. #ImmigrationDeal
@faith_nAmerica Lol wait what? Crime is up‚Äîslightly‚Äîin El Paso since they built fencing, not walls, along that stretch of the border in 2008. It has always been safe city.
@585Conservative Lol I watched. It was more reruns of the same old lies. Meanwhile in reality... https://t.co/8L7cQxpJcx
Tonight Trump plans to repeat his lies about #Immigration and #BorderSecurity in El Paso‚Äîa city that soundly rejects his false and racist narratives, because they know from experience that immigrants are good and walls are bad.
This morning, Trump tweeted that Democrats don‚Äôt want to detain criminal aliens, when in reality, they ONLY want to detain those who are criminals‚Äîand stop wasting taxpayer dollars harassing otherwise law-abiding immigrants. Watch out for #FakeNews from POTUS on #BorderSecurity!
Democrats want to make it easier for all eligible voters to vote. Republicans call it a ‚Äúpower grab.‚Äù Are they acknowledging that they‚Äôre only in power because of their ability to prevent people from voting? #VotingRights #Democracy
The people who actually live near and protect our southern border are virtually unanimous: we don‚Äôt need a wall. Trump‚Äôs plan for ‚Äúborder security‚Äù is nothing more than a political stunt, and a huge waste of money. #TrumpResign #BorderSecurity
@Bagehot99 What are you talking about
Thank you to @HouseDemocrats for taking care of Americans while @SenateGOP is busy taking care of their wallets!
@realDonaldTrump Lol nope
@realDonaldTrump The indictments are piling up, but sure, keep calling it a hoax. Yours will be soon enough. #TrumpRussia
@realDonaldTrump North Korea is not a rocket
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Who wrote this tweet lol
@realDonaldTrump Your campaign manager literally sent Republican polling data to Russian intelligence. I wonder who told him to do that... #TrumpRussia
Trump‚Äôs illegally-installed acting AG Matthew Whitaker says he won‚Äôt go through with his testimony before Congress unless they promise not to subpoena him. It‚Äôs hard to see this as anything other than an admission that he planned to lie to Congress. #CorruptGOP
Never before have we had a president so terrified of his opposition that he can‚Äôt even bear to say the word ‚ÄúDemocratic.‚Äù #SOTU #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump Omg üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ hahahahahahahaha where to even start?? have you ever heard of a place called Benghazi?
@realDonaldTrump ...You think voters who are angry about their leaders‚Äô blackface and sexual harassment scandals would instead choose a racist president who brags about committing sexual assault?
@JHenline Lol yeah elections do have consequences, including 2018. Hello Democratic House!
@JHenline Lol calling a fake emergency is done all the time‚Äîin fascist countries. 60% of the country is opposed to wasting money on a wall. It‚Äôs not going to happen, and I suspect you know that.		By the way, there‚Äôs nothing evil about disagreeing with a fascist.
The United States currently faces more threats than at any time since 9/11, and what is Trump worried about? That his #SOTU is ‚Äútoo gentle on Democrats.‚Äù What a disgrace. #TrumpResign
@JHenline Do you really not follow? The amount of money has nothing to do with it; what‚Äôs fascist is declaring a fake emergency to bypass congress, flout the Constitution, and subvert the will of the people. It‚Äôs sad that doesn‚Äôt bother you at all; Republicans used to be pro-democracy.
@JHenline I know you‚Äôre smart enough to differentiate between a fence ($) and a wall ($$$)
If Donald Trump declares a fake emergency in an attempt to illegally waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a wall, the Republican Party will have a clear choice: say no, or officially become the party of American fascism. #BorderSecurity
@msdeeislearning ...it is
@msdeeislearning I am certainly not, and I don‚Äôt think anyone else is either
Trump's dangerous and wasteful plan is to have more US solders deployed at our border with Mexico than are deployed to Iraq. He fundamentally does not understand national security, and it makes all of us less safe. #TrumpResign
Trump tells us he never spoke with #RogerStone about #RussiaCollusion. He also stood on AF1 and told us to our faces that he never directed Michael Cohen to pay hush money to his mistresses. The president lies every time he opens his mouth! #TrumpRussia
@Indivisible19NY The word is Democratic, but yes ;) have you noticed Republicans can't even bring themselves to say the word Democratic anymore? The word alone scares them.
Hey @mike_pence, you want to talk about a ‚Äúshameless embrace of a culture of death?‚Äù How about your attempts to force women in dangerous pregnancies to die for their unviable fetuses? #Abortion #RightToChoose
It's incredible to me that Republicans are STILL trying to bar women from ending a pregnancy that will kill them. Do they really want to force women to sacrifice their lives, even when the fetus isn't viable? #Abortion #RightToChoose
What does the president think about FBI agents arresting a treasonous Republican operative who conspired with Russia corrupt our presidential election? "A very sad thing for this country." #TrumpRussia #RogerStone #ImpeachTrump
If Mitch McConnell calls plans to make Election Day a holiday a "power grab," does that mean he's admitting that his own power is tied directly to his ability to suppress your vote? Asking #ForThePeople.
@ridingwithc Easily one of the most destructive figures in American history.
One would think that making it easier for citizens to vote would be a common goal for any democracy‚Äîyet Republicans like Mitch McConnell, who know their own power is tied to their ability to suppress your vote, call it a ‚Äúpower grab.‚Äù #ForThePeople #HR1
In lifting sanctions on a corrupt Russian oligarch linked to the #TrumpRussia attack, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin conveniently erased hundreds of millions of dollars in debt held by the oligarch and boosted the business of one of his own political donors. #CorruptGOP
Public information contained in the indictment of longtime Trump associate Roger Stone makes more than clear that Republican operatives conspired with Russian intelligence to elect Donald Trump, an illegitimate president. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
Within a few weeks, the number of US troops deployed to our own border (as a political stunt) could exceed the number deployed to Iraq (a major conflict center). This deployment will waste more than $600 million and harm military readiness. #ImpeachTrump
Donald Trump, who knows next to nothing about anything, says his intelligence chiefs should go back to school? When will this president stop attacking the brave men and women trying to keep our country safe? #TrumpResign
Trump‚Äôs lawyer claims his statements that Trump was trying to secure a project in Moscow up through Election Day 2016 were ‚Äúhypothetical‚Äù‚Äîbut if you watch the interview, it‚Äôs clear they weren‚Äôt. Trump is placing his business interests before the national interest. #TrumpRussia
The pointless #TrumpShutdown started when Trump tried to force Congress to waste $5.7 billion on a wall. 35 days later he backed down‚Äîbut not before wasting $11 billion on the shutdown. Are Republicans just bent on wasting our money one way or another?
@Seven_Soldiers Absolutely!
@JHenline The only thing Trump is doing differently is that instead of pretending China is willing to be a responsible player on the world stage, he‚Äôs lying and pretending to act tough, but still bending over. We need someone who actually understands the threat.
Because he‚Äôs already teeing up another #TrumpShutdown in 3 weeks, Trump should do 2 things:	1. Repay federal workers who went without pay with interest on the paychecks he needlessly withheld	2. Offer advances on their pay for the next 2 months, in case he does it again
With China taking an increasingly aggressive posture towards the United States, it‚Äôs critical that we replace Donald Trump with a leader who is capable and willing to defend the interests of our country.
Trump‚Äôs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says American workers who didn‚Äôt get paid during the #TrumpShutdown should take out loans. It‚Äôs the perfect embodiment of today‚Äôs GOP: we don‚Äôt care if you go into debt, as long as our donors get what they want. #CorruptGOP
@Cittizen1 Lol dude you get all your info from partisan news sources and make no effort to actually learn what Democrats stand for or propose. Help yourself: https://t.co/KhY9ipaynt. But I‚Äôm not doing any more of your research for you after this
So Trump finally reopened the government, but only for 3 weeks?? What about the workers? Maybe Republicans should stop playing games with these people‚Äôs lives and give them advance pay for what one can only assume will be the next #TrumpShutdown in 3 weeks.
@sesauls Let‚Äôs not call people bitches just because they‚Äôre bigots
@Cittizen1 I think much more than half wants our border secured. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre not hung up on a wall; most of us want real solutions!
The deal that Trump just signed to open the government is the exact deal that Democrats proposed, and that he's been rejecting, since December. Kind of begs the question: what was the whole point of the #TrumpShutdown? Just to toy with 800,000 federal workers? #TrumpResign
@EWErickson Right, because before today, it was totally going to be built! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Trump finally ended his #TrumpShutdown, but rather than apologize to the millions of Americans he cruelly subjected to extreme financial hardship with his political games, he continues to praise himself. Republicans seem to have fully embraced the post-shame era. #TrumpResign
There‚Äôs something disturbing about watching Trump bask in applause for ending the longest government shutdown in history, after inflicting needless pain on millions of Americans with his demand to waste $5 billion on a symbol of fear and hate. #TrumpShutdown
Reminder: the government is still shut down because Congress won‚Äôt pay for a wall we don‚Äôt need that Trump promised Mexico would pay for. #TrumpShutdown
Posing as a charity, we now know that the Trump Foundation served one main function: shelling out millions to Republican operatives before the 2016 election in an illegal vote-buying scheme. #ImpeachTrump
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump Question: do you actually believe a wall is gonna be built? Do you actually believe Trump cares whether a wall is built?
@JHenline They are literally trying to lol
Reminder: the House has already passed the 6 bills needed to end the #TrumpShutdown. Republicans in the Senate refuse to touch them, terrified that Trump will tweet about them if they move to reopen the government.
By offering to restore the #DACA protections for dreamers that he himself took away, Trump is like a bank robber saying he will let the hostages go if he can keep the $5 billion he stole. He seriously doesn‚Äôt understand the first thing about negotiating! #TrumpShutdown
@JHenline ...and therefore the other 90% are fraudulent liars looking for jobs and free stuff? Come on man lol this is ridiculous
@JHenline Lol neat statistic where did you get it
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have read the news while eating, because I was just sickened to learn that Senate Republicans are now holding renewal of the Violence Against Women Act hostage to their #TrumpShutdown. They say they‚Äôll renew it‚Äîif Congress shells out $5.7 billion for a wall!
It seems the new #TrumpShutdown hostage is asylum seekers, whose ability to receive protection would be severely curtailed by Trump‚Äôs latest demand. I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why the GOP seems so intent on hurting the most vulnerable people...
Since Trump declared #ISIS ‚Äúdefeated‚Äù and announced his cowardly and dangerous retreat, the number of American troops killed by ISIS has doubled. Trump is putting politics ahead of US interests, and it‚Äôs getting our troops killed. #TrumpResign
What‚Äôs essentially happened is that Trump took 800,000 American workers hostage in an attempt to force Congress to waste $5 billion on his wall. Now he‚Äôs tying to take the dreamers hostage too? #TrumpShutdown #DACA
Everyone knows there‚Äôs not going to be a wall. It was a clear lie from the very beginning. Why don‚Äôt Trump and his corrupt Republican cronies reopen the government and stop hurting the American people and economy? #TrumpShutdown
As the egregious self-dealing of the Trump Foundation is revealed, it‚Äôs clear that Trump became a politician for one reason and one reason only: to get rich.		Who‚Äôs paying for it? Us. üá∫üá∏	#ImpeachTrump
#DACA was a done deal. It‚Äôs the only morally correct approach to the dreamers. Americans overwhelmingly approve of it. Now Trump thinks he can ‚Äúoffer‚Äù it for a wall to end the #TrumpShutdown? Why would Democrat‚Äôs agree to waste $5 billion in exchange for something Trump ruined?
@NikiBrooks76 @jagne_r Neither have I...
It‚Äôs incredible that even after finally agreeing to condemn racist Iowa Congressman Steve King, Republicans still can‚Äôt bring themselves to condemn Trump, who is clearly every bit as racist. Republicans are putting the R in racism!
@JHenline Let me get this straight: out soldiers die in the line of duty, and it‚Äôs their fault for being in the wrong place at the wrong time? It‚Äôs truly incredible to me how today‚Äôs Republican Party is the antithesis of everything they used to stand for.
Since Donald Trump declared his cowardly and dangerous retreat from Syria, the number of American soldiers killed there has doubled. #ISIS isn‚Äôt defeated yet, and the #TrumpRetreat will only embolden it to redouble its attacks on US soldiers and allies.
#China has just sentenced to death a Canadian civilian they took hostage after a Chinese businesswoman was charged with bank fraud and sanctions dodging in #Canada. This is all but an act of war; totally unacceptable.
@Cittizen1 Impressive that Trump‚Äôs terrible policy decisions can still be Obama‚Äôs fault! Haha
It‚Äôs disturbing that it took them so long, but I‚Äôm pleased that 11 Republican senators have finally decided that protecting the US is more important than protecting Trump and Russia. Meanwhile, the rest of the Senate Republicans still want to lift sanctions on Russia #TrumpRussia
Correction: the 4 Americans killed were 2 soldiers, 1 civilian defense employee, and 1 contractor.
We lost 4 American soldiers in a tragic #ISIS bombing just days after Trump‚Äôs reckless decision to withdraw from Syria‚Äîunder the false premise that ISIS had been defeated. Trump‚Äôs lie-based policy could not be more dangerous. #TrumpResign
Trump tells us the nuclear threat from #NorthKorea no longer exists, while Mike Pence admits they haven‚Äôt taken a single concrete step towards denuclearization. Are these people idiots, or do they just think we are? #TrumpResign
It‚Äôs now coming to light that the Trump Administration separated thousands more children from their parents than they initially told us. It‚Äôs time for accountability for these heinous crimes, and justice for the victims. #ImpeachTrump
Iowa Congressman Steve King asked what‚Äôs wrong with white supremacism, but his Republican colleagues endorsed him for re-election. These kind of people put the R in racist. #CorruptGOP
@JHenline @realDonaldTrump LOL
@IsraelNewsLinks @realDonaldTrump ?
If there‚Äôs a silver lining to the #TrumpShutdown, maybe it‚Äôs that @realDonaldTrump is finally in the White House, where we pay him to be, instead of on vacation in Palm Beach or off playing golf. Laziest president of all time? #TrumpResign
PG&amp;E was found responsible for at least 17 of the 21 major NorCal fires in 2017, and their responsibility for the #CampFire seems beyond doubt. As a Californian, it‚Äôs hard for me to see how ratepayers can be expected to keep picking up the tab. It‚Äôs time for accountability.
@JHenline Correct. Europe does need to contribute a lot more for their own defense. That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that abandoning NATO would be the most idiotic and harmful thing a president could do to US foreign interests.
@Salatrel42 Presumably, several smaller European nations will get very familiar with Russian soldiers.
The United States built NATO after WWII to keep itself safe, and for decades, our network of allies has been the root of our power and sovereignty. Donald Trump is either so unintelligent‚Äîor so compromised‚Äîthat he wants to give all that up. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
The longest shutdown in US history grinds on as our corrupt and inept Republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Washington continue their absurd demand to waste billions of dollars on a wall. Americans don‚Äôt want a wall, but do Republicans care? Not at all. #TrumpShutdown #CorruptGOP
This morning Trump rejected yet ANOTHER attempted deal to end the #TrumpShutdown, now the longest in US history. Millions of Americans are in a financial emergency because Republicans in Washington are withholding their paychecks. This is so wrong.
@JHenline We‚Äôre talking about more efficient gas vehicles, not EV‚Äôs. If you wanna talk about EV‚Äôs, your points are correct, although there also some definite upsides‚Äîlike way more torque, which is critical to towing capacity
@JHenline You gonna explain this one or not? Lol
It‚Äôs truly saddening to see that Congressional Republicans‚Äô loyalty lies with a criminal president, rather than with the United States, the Constitution, and the people. #CountryOverParty #TrumpShutdown
Just learned that after his meeting with Putin in Helsinki, Trump confiscated his interpreter‚Äôs notes and instructed the interpreter never to discuss what was said in the meeting. This is a deeply disturbing development. #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump
Trump‚Äôs order to have the IRS process tax refunds during the #TrumpShutdown (which is probably illegal) is a cowardly attempt to dodge the political pain of a pointless crisis he created, instead of solving actual problems. Absolutely disgraceful. #TrumpResign
In 2016, the Trump campaign shared polling data with Russian intelligence, which was running a campaign to influence American voters. The Trump campaign provided Russian intelligence with the feedback they needed to refine their operation. That is #collusion. #TrumpRussia
We are now in the longest shutdown in US history, caused by Trump‚Äôs purely political demand to waste $5 billion of taxpayers‚Äô money on a border wall. Republicans have proved themselves totally incapable of governing. #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
@JHenline Right after we fund a space elevator lol
Republicans in Washington seem to have no problem standing between millions of Americans and their paychecks. If they had their pay witheld until they decided to end their #TrumpShutdown, I bet this whole fiasco would be over real quick. #CorruptGOP
@Women4Applause I mean, these are only the crimes that have been uncovered so far...
We are now in the longest shutdown in US history. The government isn‚Äôt functioning. 800,000 Americans are going without pay. Stocks are down almost 20%. We are ceding power to Russia, China, and North Korea. When do we start making America great again? #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
If Trump wants to see what an actual crisis looks like, he should come to the fire-ravaged communities of California. If he wants to take relief money from disaster victims to build his wall, California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico should sue immediately to protect victims.
@Cittizen1 ...am I missing something, or was I just supposed to assume it was in there and not click the link? https://t.co/C9OmTR3I4n
@Cittizen1 Illegal immigrants do not automatically become legal residents just by being here for five years. If that were true, literally every Dreamer‚Äîand all their parents‚Äîwould be legal residents. Where did you get that idea?
Truly incredible: a sitting president of the United States launches a 6-part Twitter broadside against US law enforcement. What happened to justice and equality under the law? These used to be American values. #TrumpResign #TrumpRussia

@realDonaldTrump Trump: "There's nobody in the White House but me. Everything is going is going great!"	üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Catastrophany Fortunately, I am capable of keeping my eye on more than one crime at a time ;) Trump desperately hopes that each new violation or misdeed will distract us from the last. Unfortunately for him, most of us are smarter than his base!
@Cittizen1 You do realize that illegal immigrants literally can‚Äôt get welfare, right? Like, it‚Äôs physically not possible. They can‚Äôt enroll in the programs. Because they‚Äôre not citizens. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs now coming to light that Paul Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with Russian intelligence. The level of #collusion with a foreign adversary is incredible and treasonous. #TrumpRussia
Illegal border crossings are down 70% from their 1999 high. The only crisis at the border is the one Donald Trump created, enabled by the callous cruelty of Republican politicians. #TrumpShutdown #BorderSecurity
@Cittizen1 In what way do you think congress supports illegal immigrants?
When Republicans finally end this #TrumpShutdown, their next move should be to give the 800,000 Americans going without paychecks their backpay‚ÄîWITH interest. It‚Äôs the very least they could do after treating these innocent workers as political hostages.
Starting tomorrow, Miami International Airport will close one terminal every day due to the shortage of TSA agents. Trump, you are throwing our country into chaos! End the #TrumpShutdown now!
Hey @SenateGOP, the House has now sent you the legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown. Pass the damn bills! Every day you are inflicting more pain on millions of innocent Americans. This has to stop.
The fact that Trump is even CONSIDERING taking relief money from Americans whose lives have been upended by disaster and using it to fund a political stunt is nothing short of sadistic. It‚Äôs time for Republicans to stop using vulnerable Americans as political pawns. #CorruptGOP
Even extreme anti-immigrant Republicans acknowledge that building a wall would have zero effect on immigration; that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre quietly urging Trump to end his #TrumpShutdown, afraid if he gets wall funding he‚Äôll move on from the issue of immigration. Fix the system!
Trump is now setting the pretext for declaring an emergency at the border, but the only emergency is one he willfully created: a situation in which migrants are being routinely denied their human rights, and in which children are dying. #TrumpResign
Even as he tries to blame the #TrumpShutdown on Democrats, Trump sent Mike Pence to the Capitol to warn Senate Republicans against joining their Democratic colleagues in trying to end the crisis. The lies and hypocrisy are truly unbelievable. #AnotherTrumpLie
@Cittizen1 It is. Our own Border Patrol tells us it‚Äôs not what they need. Are you unwilling to listen to the actual experts?
Of course there isn‚Äôt going to be a wall; Congress simply won‚Äôt support wasting billions of dollars on a symbol of hate and fear while the national debt balloons under GOP control and actual problems go unfixed. End this ridiculous #TrumpShutdown! #TrumpResign
Trump is now preparing to employ a tactic straight out of Fascism 101: declaring a fake ‚Äústate of emergency‚Äù in order to illegally enact harmful policy for political gain. It would be one of the greatest abuses of power in American history. #TrumpAddress #ImpeachTrump
@Cittizen1 Lol wow! There‚Äôs a hell of an accusation! What are you referring to?
Reminder: the House of Representatives‚Äîwith a responsible Democratic majority‚Äîhas already passed the bills that end this #TrumpShutdown nightmare. It‚Äôs done. However, the Republicans who control the Senate are refusing to even let Senators vote on the bills!
@Cittizen1 Lol I love how being against wasting billions on a useless wall in your mind equates to being for open borders üòÇ
Fact: most illegal immigrants are people who overstayed their visas; they never crossed the border illegally. A wall is totally unrelated to actually fixing our broken immigration system, so why won't Republicans end the #TrumpShutdown and help?
@realDonaldTrump ...aren‚Äôt you supposed to know how to negotiate?
‚ÄúMaster negotiator‚Äù Trump walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders who were trying to end the #TrumpShutdown. This guy is worse than useless!
@Cittizen1 See above
Donald Trump is now arguing that the humanitarian crisis on the border‚Äîwhich he created‚Äîmust be fixed before the government‚Äîwhich is supposed to fix problems‚Äîcan be reopened. What the actual &amp;$@%?! #TrumpAddress #TrumpShutdown
@JHenline Hahahahaha ‚Äúfake news!!‚Äù üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Cittizen1 You love wasting taxpayer funds, don‚Äôt you??
@JHenline Of course! üòä	Border patrol doesn‚Äôt want a wall: https://t.co/tWtUNJQOwR	And neither do the people who actually live near the border: https://t.co/NMCUDdv43w
Donald Trump: former presidents are calling me to tell me the #TrumpShutdown is a good idea		Former presidents: ...what?		#AnotherTrumpLie #TrumpResign
@Cittizen1 Chain link fence, with sensors to alert us if it gets cut. Way cheaper, just as effective.
@WHOLEINTHEHEAD @washumom News flash: there were no submarines, drones, or airplanes in the time of the Great Wall. There weren‚Äôt even cars.
Fact: when asked what they needed to improve border security, less than 0.05% of Border Patrol agents even mentioned a wall. It's time for Republicans to end their ridiculous #TrumpShutdown and come to grips with reality.
Here‚Äôs the emergency at the border: migrants are being abused and their children are dying in US custody. Here‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs solution: spend billions of dollars on a wall. Meanwhile, millions of Americans are at risk of going hungry due to the #TrumpShutdown. What country is this??
‚ÄúThis is not a wall between Mexico and the United States that the president is creating here; it‚Äôs a wall between reality and his supporters.‚Äù -@SpeakerPelosi #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
The government is shut down and 800,000 hardworking Americans are working without pay because Congress won‚Äôt pay for Trump‚Äôs wall‚Äîa wall he said Mexico would pay for. This is absolutely insane. Do Republicans really not see that?? #TrumpShutdown
@WResistards Lol dream on üòâ
I am deeply concerned that tonight‚Äôs #TrumpAddress is a pretext for Trump to declare a fake state of emergency and unconstitutionally bypass Congress for his own political gain. If so, it may well be time to #ImpeachTrump.
Trump‚Äôs auto emissions rollbacks are going to hurt all Americans‚Äîeven US automakers are opposed to his dangerous plan. But there‚Äôs one big beneficiary: the oil lobby, which donated immensely to Trump and his #CorruptGOP.
@benshapiro Lol wait why don‚Äôt you stop tweeting about her then
@benshapiro Critical difference: those addresses weren‚Äôt filled with lies and political disinformation üòâ		I got you, buddy!
Trump‚Äôs reckless decision to pull out of #Syria before #ISIS is fully defeated is yet another example of this president putting politics ahead of national security. American lives will be put at risk.
@JHenline @realDonaldTrump Smart
The ‚Äúrationale‚Äù behind Trump‚Äôs auto emissions rollback (sponsored by‚Äîyou guessed it!‚Äîbig oil) is actually kind of funny: that a truck that gets 30 MPG is somehow less useful than a truck that gets 15 MPG. üòÇ#RepublicanLogic #CorruptGOP
It‚Äôs not that Democrats don‚Äôt like concrete, @realDonaldTrump. It‚Äôs that we don‚Äôt like wasting money! Why don‚Äôt you stop obsessing over this wall and start doing something to address the border crisis? #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
It‚Äôs not just #TrumpRussia #collusion or his decisive loss in the popular vote that call the legitimacy of Trump‚Äôs election into account; it‚Äôs also the staggering amount of election crimes Trump himself committed in order to ‚Äúwin.‚Äù
@OllyTeregulova @magicdmw Fair enough üòä
@sleepygramy Well now, there‚Äôs a thoughtful and well-reasoned argument!
There are two big winners in Trump‚Äôs dangerous decision to leave the rest of #ISIS alone in #Syria: Russia and Iran. So much for Trump claiming he‚Äôs tough on Iran?
@theclew24 Bolton doesn‚Äôt call the shots; he‚Äôs regularly and humiliatingly contradicted by Trump. This administration is a complete mess; zero plan, zero coordination
@OllyTeregulova @magicdmw That is indeed what I mean (as it generally is when people refer to countries in the context of foreign affairs)
Trump‚Äôs #Syria withdrawal is a massive betrayal of our Kurdish allies who helped us fight ISIS, but a huge gift to two of our most dangerous enemies: Russia and Iran. What is he thinking?? #TrumpResign
It‚Äôs truly incredible that the Trump Administration can‚Äôt stop tripping over itself. After claiming to love #Israel and hate #Iran, Trump is now effectively ceding Syria to the Iranians, putting Iranian militias right on Israel‚Äôs doorstep. #TrumpResign
@Cittizen1 If I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd think you were excited by this hostage situation. Trump has you right where he wants you ;)
@Cittizen1 Lol is that... a Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory reference? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@angryshortguy Well, we know who won‚Äôt: the Republican Party. In Trump v. America, they‚Äôve made it perfectly clear which side they‚Äôre on.
@JHenline ...Nobody‚Äòs gloating. I‚Äôm pointing out that the president is easily tricked by any second-tier dictator. Anyone with an ounce of sense can see that having Trump in the White House is a serious national security threat; there‚Äôs nothing petty or political about it.
To be clear: the House of Representatives has already passed the two bills that end the #TrumpShutdown. It‚Äôs now entirely up to Republicans‚Äîin the Senate and the White House‚Äîto do the right thing and start governing responsibly. Stop taking our government hostage!
Today, Trump threatened to continue his #TrumpShutdown for ‚Äúmonths or even years.‚Äù It‚Äôs clearer than ever that the 800,000 hardworking Americans who aren‚Äôt getting their paychecks are nothing more than political pawns to Trump and his corrupt Republican cronies. #TrumpResign
Boy, did Trump fall for it! #NorthKorea finally came out and admitted that they have no intention of denuclearizing until the US disarms completely in Asia. Donald Trump is selling our country out! #TrumpResign
@585Conservative @Brutananadilew1 Lol that was an impressive leap!
@Bagehot99 Going nowhere? There‚Äôs an investigation underway, my friend. Look at all the crimes by Trump cronies uncovered so far. Look at the 33+ indictments. The American people will have justice. I, for one, support that!
Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from Syria without defeating ISIS has huge national security implications, but he made the call for a purely political reason: to distract from the growing #TrumpRussia investigations. #TrumpResign
@Brutananadilew1 @585Conservative Exactly. To say it‚Äôs fine because they‚Äôll get paid eventually is to completely disregard the fact that they‚Äôre actual people with real lives and real bills to pay. What if Trump decided to withhold your paycheck until he felt like it? Better yet, what if Obama had?? üòÇ
@585Conservative Let me get this straight: nobody who hasn‚Äôt served in the military is a patriot?		There are plenty of ways to love, respect, and serve your country. You‚Äôd do well to realize that.
The fact that Republicans are rejecting the Democratic offer of $1.3B for border security‚Äîwhile sitting on billions more in unused border security funds‚Äîmakes it clear that the #TrumpShutdown isn‚Äôt about the border; it‚Äôs about appeasing Trump‚Äôs political base. #TrumpResign
@msdeeislearning Not at all! https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
Not a penny has been allocated and not a shovel picked up, but Trump is now telling his supporters that ‚Äúmuch of the wall‚Äù is done! Give him another few months and he‚Äôll tell them it‚Äôs finished, and then we can all finally move on from this colossal waste of time and money! üòÉ
@realDonaldTrump This is incredible!! Not a penny has been allocated and not a shovel picked up, but Trump is telling his supporters ‚Äúmuch of the wall‚Äù is done! Give him another year and he‚Äôll tell them it‚Äôs finished, and then we can all finally move on from this waste of time and money! üòÉ
@realDonaldTrump Everybody knows that‚Äôs bs.
@JHenline Lol. Commissioners absolutely have to follow the law. You define it by party affiliation. Bernie is not a communist; if you know anything about communism, that should be obvious. Romney is every bit as Republican as Reagan. That was a hell of a tweet! üòÇ
Today, 800,000 hardworking American patriots didn‚Äôt get their paychecks because of the ridiculous #TrumpShutdown. When will the president end his assault on these innocent public servants and their families? #TrumpResign
@JHenline ...the commissions are made up of equal numbers of Democratic and Republican commissioners. This is already a thing. It‚Äôs already in practice. Do you understand?
Here‚Äôs the thing: the American people don‚Äôt want a king. We don‚Äôt want a leader that‚Äôs above the law. The very premise of this country was ending that oppressive system. If Donald Trump thinks he doesn‚Äôt have to play by the rules, we will end his presidency too. #ImpeachTrump
@JHenline Lol what? I just told you the solution! Nonpartisan redistricting commissions, as are already used in 17 states.
@585Conservative @pjoyfarra @Dalton642 I‚Äôm confused what you mean by sponsor. Again, nobody is asking anyone to sponsor or adopt anyone.
@JHenline You‚Äôre an adult; I‚Äôm not going to teach you about government. You should know that the United States is by definition a representative democracy. You‚Äôre thinking of a ‚Äúdirect democracy.‚Äù If those definitions are too much for you, you‚Äôre on your own man.
@585Conservative @Dalton642 @pjoyfarra I absolutely agree that people who want to immigrate need to follow the process. I also think it‚Äôs clear that our immigration process is broken, as evidenced by the insane wait times. Fixing that process should be a top priority, along with increasing border security
In withdrawing US troops from Syria and ceding the region to Russia and Iran, Trump sided with one man over virtually every official in his own administration: Putin.		Something is clearly up. #TrumpRussia #TrumpResign
@585Conservative @Dalton642 @pjoyfarra And just so we are on the same page, you are aware that no one is asking you to adopt an immigrant or anything like that, right?
@JHenline Good sir, you are aware that the United States is a liberal democracy, aren‚Äôt you? And that a republic is a form of democracy?
@585Conservative @pjoyfarra @Dalton642 Better to work a low wage job in safety than to have no job and get killed by gang violence, no?
@585Conservative @pjoyfarra @Dalton642 Many of them still work. Have you ever seen a farm? Or a restaurant kitchen? The vast majority of illegal immigrants work hard and contribute regardless of their education or language skills‚Äîand STILL don‚Äôt get benefits. That‚Äôs dedication!
So Mexico is paying for the wall, yet Trump shut down the government because Congress won‚Äôt pay for the wall. Got it. #TrumpResign #TrumpChristmasShutdown
@JHenline It‚Äôs people with that attitude that are destroying our democracy üòä thanks for contributing to the decline of America!
@Dalton642 @585Conservative Exactly. I mean, are you calling the millions of hardworking Americans with no education leeches too?
@realDonaldTrump So Mexico is paying for the wall, yet you shut down the government because Congress won‚Äôt pay for the wall. Got it. #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump Wheel is not a proper noun, dude. #TrumpResign
As defense secretary, James Mattis was one of the few competent members of the Trump Administration and one of the only ones still looking out for American interests. His resignation marks a dangerous new chapter in the decline of America under Donald Trump.
@JHenline All states should use nonpartisan redistricting commissions. Many already do. Gerrymandering is always a violation of our rights, regardless of which party does it
@585Conservative Liberal immigration policies:	-don‚Äôt waste billions on a concrete wall when chain link fence works	-don‚Äôt punish dreamers for something they didn‚Äôt do	-don‚Äôt demonize immigrants just because they aren‚Äôt white	-fix the system so we can actually control/document who comes in	Scary?
@theclew24 Sure, as long as we help people get set up so they can vote without a hitch
@beneaped It‚Äôs been allowed because judges like Sam Alito aren‚Äôt interested in the Constitution; they‚Äôre interested in making sure their party stays in power.
Republicans can no longer be allowed to deny millions of Americans their right to equal representation by cheating in elections. We must end the unconstitutional practice of #gerrymandering now.
@Nocnurse1H Got em lol
The US created 4.8 million jobs in the 22 months before Trump took office (#ThanksObama!) In 22 months under Trump, we‚Äôve added 600,000 less. Is Trump hurting the economy with his dysfunctional governance? #TrumpResign
@585Conservative You‚Äôre not a very good translator, my friend.		Worse still, you tweet this even though you know my actual stance on immigration (if you‚Äôve forgotten, I‚Äôm happy to remind you), and you know what you‚Äôre saying is false. 		What‚Äôs the point? You want people to think I‚Äôm a threat?
@Nocnurse1H Yeah we‚Äôll see
.@realDonaldTrump children are dying at the border. This is a serious situation. Instead of tweeting about a wall, why don‚Äôt you open the government back up and actually do something to address our broken immigration system? #TrumpResign
The dangerous reality is this: Trump is unable to distinguish between his own personal political interests and the national security interests of the United States. He must be removed from office before he gets innocent Americans killed. #TrumpResign
Trump all over the place on most policy matters, but when it comes to Russia, he‚Äôs disturbingly consistent: undermine the US, and help the Kremlin. #TraitorTrump #TrumpResign
Trump, who claimed to be a master negotiator, announced a unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan just as US negotiators were sitting down with the Taliban, completely destroying any American leverage. What an idiot. #TrumpResign
@JHenline This is hilarious! They use the word ‚Äúadmits‚Äù like it‚Äôs a secret. Like it‚Äôs not common sense. And then people like you eat it up! üòÇü§£üòÇ
@Vintagevandal2 @ninjaswat That‚Äôs because fencing is MUCH cheaper than a concrete wall. Fencing is what we need. It‚Äôs an actual sensible solution. https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@Vintagevandal2 What‚Äôs it meant for and what are they using it for?
@Governor_LePage @_YvonneBurton "Stolen election?" Shameful conduct for a governor.
Zero funding or construction of the wall, but Trump has gone by himself from saying "build the wall" to now demanding we "finish the wall." I reckon we could simply keep denying funding and move on to real issues, and eventually, he'd tell his supporters the wall was finished.
Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall. Now he‚Äôs shut down the government because Congress won‚Äôt pay for the wall? #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpResign
Let‚Äôs just back up here for a moment and realize that Trump shut down the government over funding for a wall‚Äîa wall he promised Mexico would pay for! #TrumpResign
Incredible: Trump is trying to take all of Central America hostage in his bizarre quest to waste billions of dollars on a border wall, threatening to cut off all aid to Central American nations if Congress doesn‚Äôt fund his wall. #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
Donald Trump‚Äôs dangerous quest to create an America that is weak, isolated, and alone must be stopped before it‚Äôs too late. #TrumpResign
Brett McGurk, a US official who under Obama oversaw #ISIS losing half its territory, felt Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from #Syria was so dangerous he had to resign. We need to have #TrumpResign instead.
@585Conservative @POTUS I don‚Äôt think I know of anyone who thinks there‚Äôs nothing wrong with illegal immigration. I sincerely doubt if you do either
Hilarious: take any one thing that Trump has done and imagine the Republican response if Obama did it üòÇ
4 Americans died in the fight against #ISIS, but our Kurdish allies lost 10,000. Now Trump betrays those allies, running away and leaving them to be slaughtered by Turkey. Is his goal for the entire world to hate America?? #TrumpResign
This Christmas, I‚Äôm thinking of the thousands of brave American troops who have been deployed to the border as a political stunt. They can‚Äôt be with their families this holiday season because Trump is more concerned with pleasing his base. #TrumpResign
Merry Christmas, America. You deserve so much more.
@585Conservative @mitchellvii Your entire statement suggested that not having a wall on our border‚Äîwhich we‚Äôve never had because it‚Äôs a dumb idea‚Äîthreatens our sovereignty‚Äîwhich has never been under threat. We don‚Äôt need a wall. We need better leadership
The Treasury Secretary‚Äôs bizarre statements and Trump‚Äôs blatant ignorance of how the economy works are giving Americans the worst Christmas present they could have asked for: a further reduction in their retirement savings. #TrumpResign
‚ÄúTough on terror‚Äù Trump retreats from the fight against #ISIS. ‚ÄúMaster negotiator‚Äù Trump causes another #TrumpShutdown. ‚ÄúLock her up‚Äù Trump is implicated in major campaign finance crimes. There‚Äôs only one way to save this country: #TrumpResign
@585Conservative @mitchellvii We are already sovereign you drama queen lol
@585Conservative Use you noggin, man. https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@mitchellvii Because it was a symbol of hate, ignorance, and fear.
@585Conservative Because it was a symbol of hate, ignorance, and fear.
@JHenline Not aware of anyone who ever hated Mattis. How do you feel about him?
Even more amazing than Trump‚Äôs temper tantrum over #Mattis‚Äô resignation is that fact that Trump read the resignation letter days before the tantrum started‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt understand it. He didn‚Äôt get that Mattis was resigning over his policy until the news explained it! #TrumpResign
Trump‚Äôs dangerous retreat from the fight against #ISIS betrays the Americans who sacrificed everything for our safety, and may well result in thousands of captured ISIS fighters walking free. Truly unbelievable. #TrumpResign
The big question is this: why do Republicans allow Donald Trump to continue harming the United States? #TrumpResign #ComplicitGOP
@JHenline But also, blame the Democrats, right? üòÇ
This is the third #TrumpShutdown in the barely 23 months that Republicans have had total control over Washington. Absolutely pathetic. #TrumpResign
Merry Christmas, America! Trump‚Äôs gift to you: one last spasm of classic Republican dysfunction. #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
In hindsight, I guess we should have known that the guy who can‚Äôt run a casino also can‚Äôt run a country. #TrumpShutdown
@JHenline That was neat how you just totally dodged the question. I guess you have to be willing to do that if you‚Äôve decided you‚Äôre going to defend a corrupt politician no matter what.
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ahhh I thought you meant Saddam lol. Why do you refer to Obama by his middle name?
@585Conservative Not sure if you‚Äôre aware that the border with Mexico is about 2,000 miles long, and much of it is a river. Not really comparable to the walls of a house lol
@theclew24 What are you basing this off
McConnell says Trump‚Äôs demand for a border wall would be ‚Äúquite uncontroversial‚Äù in a ‚Äúnormal political moment.‚Äù I, on the other hand, find it hard to imagine a scenario where essentially lighting $5 billion on fire would be acceptable. #TrumpShutdown
Remember when Republicans pretended to be responsible? Remember when they claimed they were against wasteful spending? Say hello to Trump‚Äôs GOP, which just shut down the government because they weren‚Äôt allowed to blow $5 billion on a useless wall! #TrumpShutdown
@Scott16039071 @theclew24 LOL
@JHenline Haha come on man. ALL of those crimes are still being investigated, and as more crimes are discovered, we‚Äôll get to the bottom of those too. Think about all the crimes committed by the president. You just named a bunch. Are you really ok with that?
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It‚Äôs also hilarious that you described Hussein as ‚Äúmy favorite,‚Äù even though Trump is the one who‚Äôs got a hard on for dictators (Putin, Xi, Kim Jong-Un, MBS...)
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS By destroying them do you mean pulling out before finishing the job? Great idea
Democrats are absolutely right not to allow billions of taxpayer dollars to be wasted on a useless wall. They are the bulwark of responsibility in our chaotic government‚Äîwhich Trump has now shut down! #TrumpShutdown
@Scott16039071 @theclew24 Dude learn English lol
@realDonaldTrump Trump: I know tech better than anyone	Also Trump: *doesnt know how to use email*		Oh man this tweet is gold!! üòÇüòÇ
@Scott16039071 @theclew24 Lol thanks for weighing in, Comrade ‚ÄúScott16039071‚Äù üòÇ
@j200610 Why
@theclew24 Let‚Äôs get one thing clear: since 2016, the Republicans have controlled 100% of the federal government. The Democrats couldn‚Äôt shut anything down if they wanted to.
@realDonaldTrump Oh don‚Äôt worry, the Democrats will vote. They‚Äôll vote not to waste $5 billion in taxpayer money on a wall that won‚Äôt do anything. #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump I gave this tweet an ironic like because it‚Äôs so &amp;#%$ing hilarious!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@realDonaldTrump LOL
@realDonaldTrump ISIS only existed during yours and the previous presidency! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs now being reported that Trump won‚Äôt even tell Republican Senators  what his demands would be to avoid another #TrumpShutdown‚Äîhe‚Äôs just set on doing it! What a lunatic!
The votes to waste $5 billion on a border wall simply don‚Äôt exist, and yet Donald Trump is threatening to shut down the government unless Congress magically passes such a bill. He is totally divorced from reality, severely harming our security and economy. #TrumpShutdown
In Ohio this year, Democrats won 50% of the vote, but only got 25% of the representation. How are state Republicans okay with totally ignoring the rights of millions of their constituents to equal representation?? #CorrupGOP
Year after year, Trump signed statements to the IRS swearing that his Trump Foundation ‚Äúcharity‚Äù wasn‚Äôt engaging in illegal political activity. Year after year, that was a lie. #ImpeachTrump
Gotta hand it to the guy: after 8 years of Obama‚Äôs painstaking achievements, it took Trump less than 2 years to have this country headed straight for the ground. Incredible.
North Carolina is experiencing nothing short of a crisis of Democracy: Republicans won 50% of the vote, but 70% of the representation. Half of the state is being denied their Constitutional rights!
@Ferneau_J Seems INCREDIBLY light.
Michael #Flynn, who led chants of ‚ÄúLock her up!‚Äù about an innocent American citizen, now faces up to 6 months in prison for numerous felonies. It was obvious who the real criminals were all along. #TrumpRussia #DrainTheSwamp
The New York Attorney General has found that Trump committed numerous state and federal crimes through his fraudulent Trump Foundation. Get this criminal out of the White House! #CorruptGOP
Putin is now openly supporting Trump‚Äôs idiotic decision to withdraw from #Syria before defeating #ISIS. This dangerous move gives Russia a free hand in the region, at the expense of US safety and security.
@EriqKunz1 Thank you, and same to you!
The investigation of the Trump Foundation is the first charity fraud case to involve a sitting president of the United States. Every day, Trump finds a new way to bring shame on this great nation. #CorruptGOP
@realDonaldTrump God you‚Äôre getting desperate lol
For once, Republicans in Washington do the right thing and back down from their ridiculous threat of a third #TrumpShutdown. It shouldn‚Äôt have been this difficult.
@katieschwartz Except when it‚Äôs happening to your country üò°
After claiming the FBI "tricked" him by not reminding him lying to federal agents is a crime, Michael #Flynn now admits he knew it was a crime all along‚Äîbut that didn't stop him. Six months is nothing for effectively committing treason lite; he deserves jail. #TrumpRussia
According to a study by JPMorgan Chase, ‚Äú2018 has delivered losses on almost every asset class and investing style.‚Äù It didn't even take 2 years for @realDonaldTrump to ruin Obama's economic achievements. Welcome to the #TrumpEconomy. Buckle up.
There are signs everywhere that the global economy is beginning to slow, and thanks to Trump's reckless mismanagement of the US economy, we are now less prepared for a downturn than at any time in recent memory. This probably won't end well.
@SierackiDavid Couple things: 1. Canada arrested her. 2. Regardless of how China (or you) feel about sanctions, it‚Äôs still a crime misrepresent yourself and your company when conducting business with US banks for the purposes of breaking US law.
@JHenline I‚Äôm sure we agree on plenty
After a Chinese businesswoman was arrested in Canada for evading sanctions, China responded by taking two random Canadian citizens hostage. This is unacceptably aggressive behavior for a country that wants to be respected and taken seriously on the world stage.
Every day I‚Äôm stunned by all the GOP snowflakes in Trump‚Äôs orbit. They commit crimes, lie about those crimes, then turn around and whine that they were ‚Äútricked‚Äù by the FBI into lying. Republicans really are ushering in the post-shame era, and it‚Äôs disgraceful.
@JHenline The point of the sensors and cameras is to prevent people from crossing, or at least catch them immediately after they do. A shutdown would indeed be a waste of money, which is why I encourage the president not to shut the government down again.
@gage_elton An excellent clarification. And who runs the DOJ? The president. Clearly this needs to be fixed by law or amendment.
@585Conservative @gage_elton @POTUS Correct, I‚Äôm not going to cite the code. You can look that up if you‚Äôre interested. The fact of the matter is individual campaign contributions over $2700 are illegal, and Trump coordinated $280,000 in donations from Cohen. You already knew this‚Äîwhy waste your time and ours?
@JHenline 1. 3.5B may not be a lot for the feds, but it has many far better uses than concrete. Could be put towards actual border security, like sensors and cameras	2. I‚Äôm not interested in humiliating anyone, and I‚Äôm sure as hell not scared of anything. I just don‚Äôt like wasting money
The notion that a sitting president can‚Äôt be charged with election crimes is unacceptable and blatantly at odds with the intent of the Constitution. Nobody is above the law in this country, Trump will face justice for his crimes.
@JHenline lol the rich elitist in the White House is the loudest proponent of a border wall. He probably knows it won‚Äôt make any difference, but what he does know is that it will keep people like you voting for him! üòâ
@JHenline Lol Vatican and Israel are both tiny and don‚Äôt have cartels trying to sneak drugs in. Not comparable at all. What wall in Mexico are you talking about?
@JHenline A concrete wall would have minimum impact on national security. https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
Bizarre news conference at the White House this morning in which Trump repeatedly confused the political issue of a border wall with the very real issue of border security. He‚Äôs now threatening to shut down the government yet again?
‚ÄòSome officials say that the reflexive animosity is the inevitable result of Mr. Putin‚Äôs determination to restore his country‚Äôs arsenal and Mr. Trump‚Äôs paralysis on Russia...‚Äô -@nytimes hitting the nail on the head. Trump is paralyzed. #TrumpRussia
The Trump presidency would be hilarious if it were happening to another country.
China is being increasingly transparent in its attempts to undermine the United States at every turn. We need a President who won‚Äôt assist them in that effort!
According to Trump, Rex Tillerson is ‚Äúdumb as a rock‚Äù and ‚Äúlazy as hell‚Äù‚Äîjust like the idiot who hired him! üôÉ #TrumpAdministration
Donald Trump: the first president of the United States to literally not care about what happens to the United States.
Trump broke with decades of US decorum and dignified the dictator of North Korea with a meeting. He got a boatload of empty lies and broken promises in return, so naturally, he wants to meet with Kim Jong Un again. It‚Äôs classic Trump idiocy.
@JHenline Only one elitist billionaire manipulating the market here: Trump.
With a nothing more than a stupid tweet, Donald Trump just wiped out $800 billion in American investments and sent markets plunging by more than 3%. This presidency is a disaster.
North Korea made Donald Trump the same empty promises they‚Äôve been repeating for decades and he ate it hook, line, and sinker. Now China is doing the exact same thing. Trump is selling our country out to foreign leaders who are smarter than him!
The state of Georgia cancels voters‚Äô registration if they don‚Äôt vote in several consecutive elections. Whose idea was that? The same corrupt Republican who just purged thousands of voters from the rolls before his election for governor. What happened to democracy?#CorruptGOP
Ivanka Trump says there‚Äôs ‚Äúno equivalency‚Äù between her use of a private email server for government business and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs‚Äîwhich is hilarious, because it‚Äôs literally the exact same thing. #LockHerUp? ü§î
Ryan Zinke, Trump‚Äôs corrupt Secretary of the Interior, steered millions of dollars in government contracts to unqualified firms that he‚Äòs connected with. Now he‚Äôs slandering a sitting member of Congress? What an embarrassment to this great nation. #DrainTheSwamp #ZinkeResign
@RyanL1979 @sarah_margolis @jasoninthehouse @HillaryClinton This is beautiful üòÇ
@TWW_Pod Corte Madera is great any time of year! üòâ
@EriqKunz1 After a trial, of course ;)
Stop for a moment to consider the fact that 34 people have been charged with crimes in relation to the #TrumpRussia investigation, and #Mueller hasn't even gotten to the most important parts yet. The level of criminality by Trump and his corrupt associates is astounding.
A 20-month old girl died as a result of infections she got while being detained with her mother in an unsanitary ICE facility. I am so ashamed. Trump‚Äôs cruel and inhumane immigration policies must be fixed immediately.
And there goes the ball game. #TrumpRussia #Collusion https://t.co/QEJrrh9jAg
@realDonaldTrump What I love about Twitter is that it's a totally unvarnished window into Trump's imagination. Truly incredible to see how this guy thinks.
@e92sam I don‚Äôt even know if the dumbest we have could be rolled by Trump and Manafort üòÇ
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Lol what üòÇ
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump HAHA what, were you hoping nobody would watch the video?? Hillary Clinton is playfully mocking the other lady‚Äôs mix up! This tweet is literal #FakeNews
We now know that Donald Trump and Paul Manafort conspired to align their testimony to the #Mueller investigation. That is obstruction of justice in and of itself. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
Having a rough Tuesday? Just picture Donald Trump sitting in bed at 4:30 AM, terrified about the #TrumpRussia investigation, tweeting a stream of lies about #Mueller. Because that‚Äôs exactly what happened this morning.
@realDonaldTrump I love how it took you 12 minutes to come up with another 280 characters of lies üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@realDonaldTrump This is what you were doing at 4:30 AM?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Even for the criminals of the #TrumpSwamp, Paul Manafort sets a new low: lying to investigators after being caught lying and promising to cooperate. Justice will be served.	#TrumpRussia
Trump‚Äôs illegally-appointed acting attorney general was on the board of a company that defrauded thousands customers out of millions of dollars. He will be right at home in the #TrumpSwamp.		#DrainTheSwamp
By 2050, scientists forecast that hotter temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns will reduce agricultural productivity in the Midwest to levels last seen in the 1980s.		@realDonaldTrump DO SOMETHING
@GrayWolf1775 @ninjaswat ‚ÄúProtecting the border?‚Äù From what?
@realDonaldTrump LOL as if Donald Trump knows the word ‚Äúbedlam‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
A very happy Thanksgiving to the 5,900 American soldiers who can‚Äôt be with their families today because Donald Trump sent them to the border as a political stunt. Your country respects and appreciates your service and sacrifice to our nation, even if the president doesn‚Äôt. üá∫üá∏ü¶Éü§ó
Donald Trump‚Äôs open hostility to the idea of equal justice under law is unacceptable and threatens to corrode the very basis of this country.
@cpaletz 18 or 19 Republican senators who would put country ahead of party? Absolutely not. Not in today‚Äôs GOP.
We are now learning that Donald Trump made moves to have the Justice Department indict his perceived political rivals, Hillary Clinton and James Comey, last April. If true, this attempt to prosecute two innocent Americans is eminent grounds for impeachment.
I‚Äôm patiently waiting for Trump to have his supporters chant ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù about Ivanka and direct the Justice Department to investigate her‚Äîyou know, like a non-hypocrite. #ButHerEmails #CrookedIvanka
Today in the news: Ivanka Trump regularly uses personal email for government business, and Donald Trump disparages a decorated American general as a ‚ÄúHillary Clinton fan.‚Äù		...they really don‚Äôt understand anything, do they?
I‚Äôm pretty sure there is no bigger #snowflake than a person who thinks a group of refugee families constitutes a lethal military threat. Just saying.
Even more disturbing than the authoritarian move of barring a reporter from the White House is Trump‚Äôs decision to fabricate allegations against that same reporter. It‚Äôs further proof that Trump feels free to make up lies about anyone or anything if it serves him politically.
@MommaWasilla @ClaraJeffery @darth Hahaha thank you!
Trump accused football players of disrespecting the military by protesting during the anthem, but won‚Äôt visit our fallen on Veterans Day and sent troops on a fake mission to the border with no combat pay during Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm almost starting to think he‚Äôs just racist!
Just learned that not only did he fail to visit an American WWI cemetery in France because of ‚Äúrain,‚Äù Trump couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to visit Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day (no excuse for this one). What an insult to America‚Äôs soldiers and veterans!
Of course Trump refused to visit America‚Äôs WWI fallen. He doesn‚Äôt care at all about our soldiers and veterans! He mocked an American prisoner of war and sent our troops to miss Thanksgiving at the border for no reason. He uses our military for his own gain and never looks back.
@EriqKunz1 Beautiful photo...
It‚Äôs a very sad #VeteransDay for the thousands of brave soldiers wasting time and money at the border with nothing to do. They will miss Thanksgiving with their families because Trump is using them as a political prop.
This Veterans Day, I‚Äôm thinking about our brave soldiers who are missing the holidays with their families because they‚Äôve been sent to do nothing the southern border. This political stunt is a gross abuse of our soldiers by an incompetent president, and my heart goes out to them.
@realDonaldTrump Lol you would call for ignoring the votes of thousands of Americans. You hate democracy.
@realDonaldTrump I think that‚Äôs just your cluelessness.
@MommaWasilla @realDonaldTrump Darn it!
@sisrum I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who noticed that! And yet he hasn‚Äôt called our troops back from the border. Maybe he forgot that he sent them there...?
Trump promised me a 10% tax cut BEFORE the election. The election was 5 days ago; where the hell is my tax cut??		Just #AnotherTrumpLie from a president willing to say or do anything to hold onto power. Disgusting.
A great day for America: after 30 years in Congress, Dana Rohrabacher is out! He put Russia before the US, and was so important to Russian intelligence that they gave him a code name. America: 1 ‚Äî Compromised Republicans: 0 üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@MGuy207 @RBMEllis So why are Republicans so terrified of counting every vote, if they‚Äôre sure they‚Äôll win?
The flurry of baseless accusations and desperate lawsuits coming from Republican candidates in #Florida is just embarrassing. It‚Äôs time for all candidates to step back, let the votes be counted, and respect the will of the people.
@realDonaldTrump You literally just made this up.
The plain, simple truth is this: if Trump didn‚Äôt collude with Russia to hack the 2016 election, he wouldn‚Äôt be making attempt after desperate attempt to undermine the #Mueller investigation. #TrumpRussia
@585Conservative Lol what‚Äôs with the hashtag
@585Conservative @POTUS Yes lol I‚Äôm aware. That doesn‚Äôt address my response to your tweet though, so I‚Äôm not quite sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make in relation to my original tweet you‚Äôre responding to.
Anyone suggesting ignoring the ballots of American voters in #Florida and #Georgia has already lost the argument. The will of the people will prevail, and their voices will be heard.
@JHenline If our gun laws failed, let‚Äôs fix them!
@585Conservative I don‚Äôt want to put words in your mouth, but your tweet almost seems to suggest that in Donald Trump v. American democracy, you‚Äôre on the side of Trump...
Donald Trump is threatening a ‚Äúwarlike posture‚Äù agains the House of Representatives if they move to investigate his crime? Please‚ÄîTrump has been in a state of war with our democracy for years, and it‚Äôs not a war he‚Äôs going to win.
@katcomin We will know.
@JHenline Just gonna point out that none of the last 3 terror events here had anything to do with religion. Mental illness, for sure. The fact that mentally ill people have such easy access to guns is idiotic.
Donald Trump is a politician; he knows his desperate attempts to undermine the #TrumpRussia investigation carry huge political risk because they make him look guilty, and yet he keeps trying. Clearly he‚Äôs even more afraid of what #Mueller will discover.
@JHenline You do realize the idea that a night at a bar would even need to be protected is a reflection of how insane the levels of gun violence in this country have become, right?
@JHenline It wasn‚Äôt an event. It was an evening at an LA bar. We already have armed guards for these general situations: they‚Äôre called police.
So saddened to hear about yet another tragic mass shooting, this time in my home state. When are we going start honoring these innocent victims and do something to keep guns out of the hands of the deranged?? #CaliforniaShooting
@585Conservative No, I can assure you, there really aren‚Äôt.
I love how @realDonaldTrump thinks he can scare the Democrats out of investigating his crimes against the nation with threats. What a complete and total fool! #JusticeIsComing
@585Conservative Lol dude. Nobody wants immigrants to be able to just waltz on into the country. That entire idea was is a ridiculous breitbart fantasy. All people want is not to be treating would-be refugees like ‚Äúinvaders.‚Äù
Yesterday, like most days, Donald Trump collected his salary of our tax dollars without earning a penny of it. He didn‚Äôt work at all, instead spending his time talking on the phone with friends and political allies, freeloading as usual. #DrainTheSwamp!
@cpaletz Definite disappointments in Tennessee, Texas, Georgia, and Florida.
@585Conservative I would hope with the cooperation of reasonable Republicans‚Äîor do you think that‚Äôs asking too much?
Tonight the people of every congressional district voted, and they said enough is enough. There remains much work to do, but this is a solid start to rebuilding the United States of America.
Here‚Äôs one thing we know for certain: when Republicans lose seats tonight, a desperate Donald Trump is going to call the elections rigged. You can help respond to his attacks on our democracy by making your voice heard. GO VOTE!
If you are an American, do your civic duty and vote.
There‚Äôs something truly incredible about watching Trump stand before ‚ÄúMake America Safe Again‚Äù signs and encourage violence against protesters and reporters, while a rabid one of his supporters mails pipe bombs across the country. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
@desertopus I‚Äôm sorry to hear that‚Äîbut you know what to do! #VoteBlue ‚úÖ
@realDonaldTrump Josh Hawley has cost Missouri taxpayers MILLIONS as attorney general by bungling case after case. Now you think he deserves a promotion?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
One of the creepiest modern political phenomena is how Republicans will tell voters one thing and then go do the exact opposite. They say they will protect people with preexisting conditions, but vote again and again and again to deny those people healthcare. #VoteThemOut!
Hey @GOP, if you‚Äôre so scared of George Soros donating to Democrats, instead of trying to villify or murder him, why don‚Äôt you just support campaign finance reform? üí°#VoteBlue2018
@TRGG0101 Don‚Äôt blame your troops for following orders from a sicko president‚Äîbut you‚Äôre absolutely right about the vote!
@JHenline Pretty much the opposite. She burnt a flag with a confederate symbol in protest. Whoever told you it was an American flag was clearly hoping you‚Äôd react this way.
Wake up, #Georgia: if you don't vote for Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp wins, you could lose your right to vote. Brian Kemp proved time and again that he is hell-bent on stopping Georgians who don't like him from voting.
The United States military is not a political prop. More than being another colossal waste of money, Trump's decision to send our troops to the border to "defend" against a group destitute migrants hundreds of miles away is an insult to the service and sacrifice of our soldiers.
@mams4 That is ridiculous too, you‚Äôre exactly right. But the answer is not for every Jew to buy a gun. The answer is to unite against anti-Semitism, continue improving our policing, and work towards a more tolerant society.
Republicans have had an iron grip on Washington for two years now, and let‚Äôs look at what they‚Äôve done: given their donors a giant tax cut, blown out the deficit, tried repeatedly to take away your healthcare, and divided the nation. It‚Äôs time to #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica!
@McdouglasAlex @LuiseGaze @thelisarenee @realDonaldTrump Why would I bring up the trade deficit? It‚Äôs an entirely meaningless metric. It‚Äôs a reflection of how much stuff Americans buy...
@McdouglasAlex @LuiseGaze @thelisarenee @realDonaldTrump What do you mean by a budget constraint?
@mams4 That‚Äôs ridiculous.
Democratic closing argument: protect people‚Äôs healthcare, protect people‚Äôs liberties.		Republicans closing argument: THE IMMIGRANTS ARE COMING!!!!!!!!!!!!!		#VoteBlue2018
Donald Trump controls the White House and now the Supreme Court, and his corrupt Republican enablers control Congress. Republicans have never been more powerful‚Äîand yet, before the midterms, he‚Äôs telling voters to ‚Äúblame Democrats‚Äù for all his mistakes? üòÇüòÇ
Democrats are in it for the people. It seems like Republicans are only in it for the profit. #VoteBlue
@realDonaldTrump We‚Äôre ALL laughing at the stupidity we see. If it bugs you so much, you should either stop screwing things up or resign.
@realDonaldTrump Republicans literally vote against protecting people with preexisting conditions.		Every. Damn. Time.
@realDonaldTrump Lol but you and your Republicans are the ones literally running this country....
@JHenline What point are you making?
@JHenline I‚Äôve read the entire constitution. The US has jurisdiction over everyone in the United States except diplomats. That‚Äôs why illegal immigrants are deported.
Trump apparently thought an executive order to end birthright citizenship would motivate his base to vote‚Äîbut even by the standards of today‚Äôs Republicans, it‚Äôs hard to see how attacking the Constitution is a winning move.
Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be so hard on Trump‚Äîif all I cared about was getting rich at the taxpayers‚Äô expense and passing terrible policy that would hurt the country, I‚Äôd probably resort to making up lies about the Democratic Party too üòÇ
It‚Äôs a week before the midterms, and Republicans are literally just making things up and throwing them at voters, trying to see what sticks. Vote these clowns and liars out. Let‚Äôs clean up Washington! #VoteBlue
Gov. Rick Scott of Florida has to be one of the most corrupt politicians in US history. He made his fortune through corporate Medicare fraud, and now protects it through his actions as governor. Florida, don‚Äôt send him to the Senate, send him to retirement!
@TimBillett @realDonaldTrump Nobody wants open borders. By that logic, Republicans want crushing deficits and martial law lol
@realDonaldTrump Lie about the other side rather than say what you really want to do. Smart.
Birthright citizenship is one of the central tenets of America, laid out by the founding fathers in the Constitution. Trump‚Äôs attempt to end it by decree is anti-American on so many levels.
@HornSanford Nobody‚Äôs blaming him for the shooting, my friend
Are you a resident of Corte Madera, Marin County, or California? Check out this month's Beckman Briefing for my recommendations on selected ballot measures! https://t.co/zCJ6Ccf0d7
Domestic terrorists are now being radicalized by Trump‚Äôs extremist rhetoric. Republican lies aren‚Äôt just reckless; they‚Äôre dangerous, and will ultimately cost American lives.
Debbie Cox, the Republican clerk of Ford County KS, has just moved ONLY polling place in majority-Democratic Dodge City OUTSIDE the city. Rather than attacking democracy and our right to vote, Republicans should try improving their policies!
Can‚Äôt help but notice that Trump got $11.5 million from the NRA, and now whenever there‚Äôs a mass shooting, his proposed solution is to buy more guns. He sees violence against innocent Americans as a chance to make money for his donors. #PittsburghSynagogue
@585Conservative Lol nobody wants to limit or censor speech
There must be an election coming, because Donald Trump and Republicans are kicking the lying into overdrive. Creepy. #VoteBlue
Let me get this straight: Donald Trump openly encourages violence against news media, and when his supporters obey, he then criticizes the media for reporting on that terrorism instead of writing about politics? It‚Äôs past time to #ImpeachTrump; the guy is a menace.
The authorities have arrested the right-wing terrorist mailing bombs to Democratic activists and politicians across the country.		We are now seeing the very real and dangerous effects of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign to incite hatred and division. This #terrorism must stop.
Every day, teams of Russian government hackers are working tirelessly to undermine our elections. The Trump Administration‚Äôs response so far: telling them ‚Äúwe are watching you.‚Äù #TrumpRussia
I‚Äôd just like to point out to everyone who claimed the #Mueller investigation was a political hit job that Mueller has intentionally gone quiet around the midterms to avoid influencing the elections. #TrumpRussia
@realDonaldTrump Republicans literally vote EVERY SINGLE TIME to cut coverage for people with preexisting conditions. This is one of the clearest lies I've ever seen.
Donald Trump's new line at rallies is screaming about a "left wing mob." Meanwhile, his supporters are chanting "lock her up" about innocent Americans while mailing pipe bombs to former presidents, news outlets, and an 88 year old man. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Trump keeps tweeting as if he‚Äôs somehow helping our economy, but the reality is this: like many Americans, almost all the growth in my retirement account from the past year has been wiped out in recent months by Republicans‚Äô mismanagement of the economy. #VoteThemOut!
Donald Trump woke up at 6 AM yesterday morning and immediately tweeted a stream of lies about immigration to try to scare voters.		I think he‚Äôs getting really nervous about the #BlueWave...
Every time @realDonaldTrump lies your face, think of and blame the Republicans in Congress who REFUSE to hold him accountable.		The elections are in 15 days, and you have a chance to help fix our broken government. You deserve better than this.
@realDonaldTrump Wait a minute, in your last tweet you tried to scare us by saying it was actually all the Democrats‚Äô fault, and there‚Äôs nothing we can do to stop the migrants. It‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre making this all up...		#VoteBlue2018
@realDonaldTrump Every time @realDonaldTrump lies your face, think of and blame the Republicans in Congress who REFUSE to hold him accountable.		The elections are in 15 days, and you have a chance to help fix our broken government. You deserve better than this.
Josh Hawley is running for Senate in Missouri, but he can‚Äôt even do his own much simpler job as AG! He‚Äôs so inexperienced and incompetent that Missouri taxpayers are paying over 300% more in legal expenses than they were before Hawley became AG. Vote for @clairecmc!
@585Conservative Yeah sure. The ridiculous ‚ÄúTax Cuts and Jobs Act‚Äù (üòÇ) and the giving of huge contracts after Hurricane Maria to obscure, incompetent companies with zero experience or qualifications but ties to Ryan Zinke.
@SocialPowerOne1 God damn, this guy has totally lost it!
Republicans are looting America, distributing the riches to corporations and donors and pocketing the rest. #VoteBlue to reject the culture of corruption that has taken over Washington!
@annievanleur I knew, and yet I still hoped.
@GOPChairwoman Lol go to a Trump rally and then tell me where the mob is
@jillyjaxon I would die before voting for Donald Trump. At least I‚Äôd die for my country.
@Jackie85971004 Intelligent argument right there!
Not sure who to vote for on November 6th? Let‚Äôs make it easy:		Democrats are for people. Republicans are for corporations and Donald Trump.
@dieeane And if not control, at least some semblance of willingness to stand up to him for the good of the country.
I had secretly hoped that Trump would prove us wrong, and that rather than a divisive idiot, he‚Äôd govern like a brilliant businessman, drawing on expertise from the best and the brightest. I never told anyone about this hope, because I worried it was stupid.		Turns out, it was.
2 years after scrapping the Obama Administration‚Äôs brilliant TPP‚Äîwhich would have protected the US and our allies from China‚Äôs manipulation‚ÄîTrump finally understands the threat, and is now scrambling to catch up by renegotiating trade deals. What a huge waste of precious time!
Marsha Blackburn, running for Senate in Tennessee, is just as corrupt as the rest of the Trump swamp. Where do Republicans keep finding these people??		#CorruptGOP #DrainTheSwamp
Let‚Äôs look at the two candidates for governor of #Georgia:		@staceyabrams has worked tirelessly through her nonprofit to get Georgians registered to vote.		@BrianKempGA has worked tirelessly as Secretary of State to cancel the registration of Georgian voters who aren‚Äôt white.
The big midterms news of the day is that Democrats are way outraising Republicans. Whatever. The amount of money in our politics is disgusting.		The real news is that a big chunk of Democrats‚Äô fundraising is coming from small donors. Let‚Äôs take our democracy back from the donors!
Throughout the campaign, Trump loved complaining about two things: US aid for foreign countries, and government waste.		Last week, he created a new government agency to give aid money to other countries‚Äîeven though one already exists.		This is almost funny.
Sheldon Adelson has donated $55 million to Republicans this election cycle. Among other things, that $55,000,000 buys him a DIRECT line to Donald Trump.		The level of corruption in our politics is absolutely sickening.
Our strong network of alliances has long been a major source of this country‚Äôs strength and security. Now, Donald Trump is systematically alienating America from our allies, doing the work of our enemies as he makes our country weaker and weaker.
I always thought Republican claims of voter fraud by using the names of deceased voters was BS.		I guess it was a confession; @Scotttaylorva (GOP congressman running for re-election in VA) submitted a candidate petition with the names of dead voters. Shoulda seen that one coming.
18 months ago, Trump loved to claim that the world lost all respect for our nation under Obama.		This year, Trump gave an amateurish speech at the United Nations, and the world laughed openly in the president‚Äôs face.		This is no longer funny; it‚Äôs just sad.
At last year‚Äôs #UNGA, Trump demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons immediately. At this year‚Äôs meeting, he said he has ‚Äúall the time in the world,‚Äù even as they continue amassing nuclear bombs. It was all just #AnotherTrumpLie from a totally incompetent negotiator.
The most corrupt president in American history has now added to the Supreme Court a rabid partisan who believes presidents are above the law.		It‚Äôs time to take our country back.
The seat that Brett Kavanaugh is seeking belongs to Neil Gorsuch. Gorsuch‚Äôs current seat should be filled by Merrick Garland. If Trump cares about the working order of this country, he will withdraw Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination and nominate Merrick Garland instead. It‚Äôs that simple.
Trump says he ‚Äúfell in love‚Äù with Kim Jong-Un. Kim Jong-Un‚Äôs response? There‚Äôs ‚Äúno way‚Äù North Korea will denuclearize without huge new US concessions (in addition to the big concessions Trump already made and got nothing in return for).		These guys are playing him like a fiddle!
While Trump gushes about how he ‚Äúfell in love‚Äù with Kim Jong-Un, North Korea is increasing production of nuclear weapons and demanding huge new concessions.		Make no mistake: Trump‚Äôs weakness is allowing a major national security threat to grow much more serious.
@JHenline You may have noticed I‚Äôm not trying to get on the Supreme Court lol
Brett Kavanaugh should be held in contempt of Congress for his disrespectful, indecorous, and utterly contemptuous treatment of the Senators attempting to ascertain his fitness for the Supreme Court‚Äîespecially his treatment of Senator @amyklobuchar.
Under penalty of perjury, Kavanaugh went out of his way an extraordinary number of times while testifying to focus his remarks about his drinking entirely on beer, claiming ‚ÄúI did not drink beer to the point of blacking out.‚Äù Are we to assume that‚Äôs all he drank? Give us a break!
Obstruction of justice requires a corrupt intent, and Donald Trump‚Äôs intentional undermining of the FBI‚Äôs investigation into Kavanaugh‚Äîattempting to make sure they can‚Äôt find all the facts about his nominee‚Äîis just about as corrupt as it gets.
‚ÄúF.B.I. agents know time has very little to do with memory... They also know that little lies point to bigger lies. They know that obvious lies by the nominee about the meaning of words in a yearbook are a flashing signal to dig deeper.‚Äù -James Comey	#KavanaughInvestigation
@585Conservative Lol you live in an exciting world
The president is lying to the public about the Kavanaugh investigation. He says the FBI has ‚Äúfree reign,‚Äù but he put an artificial time limit on the investigation and barred them from interviewing all but 4 witnesses. He‚Äôs intentionally hampering their inquiry into his nominee.
@Roxygirl1960 I mean if we‚Äôre being strict he was dead wrong and I took his comment out of context to make him appear right. He was really saying it‚Äôs shameful that Democrats are demanding to know the facts rather than rubber-stamp a misogynist onto the Supreme Court.
Regardless of what one believes about Brett Kavanaugh and his accusers, no one should be able to deny that it took incredible courage for Dr. Ford to come forward and testify in the face of ceaseless threats and personal attacks. She is an inspiration.
@marthaleephelps Can‚Äôt really blame you haha
@gigispeaksmind He‚Äôs going to vote the way that helps his political career and hurts the country‚Äîjust like he always does.
Ted Cruz is right: the Kavanaugh saga has become one of the most shameful chapters in the Senate‚Äôs history. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way; there was no need to nominate such a deeply flawed individual, and no reason to defend him once his true character was revealed.
@R8RFAN67 @Silkbrah That face is shopped‚Äîas you can tell if you watched the hearing, which  I assume you did
Trump said that Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony showed the nation why he nominated him for the Supreme Court. What Kavanaugh showed us is that he feels entitled to power, and entitled to attack those who disagree. What Trump showed us is that when it comes to justice, we are on our own.
@MikeFreethinker Thank you!
Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony before the Senate betrayed exactly why he must never sit on the Supreme Court: beneath his mild-mannered facade lies an amoral core of vicious partisanship, supreme entitlement, and utter contempt for all who dare question him.
@jmarlene7 @norvilgirl Now there‚Äôs an intelligent and well-reasoned defense of Kavanaugh!
@Critterdude1 Well put
@TheRealWeeg People call this this post-truth era, but that‚Äôs BS. The truth still exists, even if the president chooses to constantly lie. What this is is the post-shame era.
@norvilgirl I can see exactly what he‚Äôs feeling, and that‚Äôs exactly the problem. A Supreme Court Justice has to be able to handle their feelings much, much better than that.
Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs performance before the Senate Thursday‚Äîseething, aggressive, partisan‚Äîwas some of the least judicious behavior I have ever seen. If I were him, I would withdraw in disgrace.
@mayhue96 Duly noted
This says it all. This is the face of a man successfully convincing the 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee that he should be one of the most powerful judges in the country. Absolutely ridiculous. https://t.co/ttgRGup3dI
It‚Äôs a small concession to the notion of good governance that Republicans delayed the final Kavanaugh vote while the FBI investigates‚Äîbut we didn‚Äôt have to be here. All Trump had to do was nominate someone who isn‚Äôt a power-hungry misogynist, and he just couldn‚Äôt do it.
Can somebody please give me one good reason why Kavanaugh and Judiciary Committee Republicans are unwilling to let the FBI look into Dr. Ford‚Äôs assault allegations? If they‚Äôre convinced there‚Äôs ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù of an event that ‚Äúnever happened,‚Äù why not let it be proven?
@Belleskye39 @JeffFlake He‚Äôs not running for reelection
Jeff Flake‚Äôs ‚Äúpresumption of innocence‚Äù defense of his vote for Kavanaugh is a craven cop-out. Nobody is asking him to convict anyone of anything, but only to acknowledge what is patently obvious: that Kavanaugh is totally unfit for the Supreme Court.
This is it: one of the ugliest, saddest moments in modern American politics. Lindsey Graham makes complete and final his transition from representative of the people to vicious, partisan hack. He is no longer interested in serving the public; only in serving Trump. https://t.co/yd8R06b2V3
There can be no doubt that Brett Kavanaugh should never sit on the US Supreme Court. His history of violence and misogyny, volatile temper, dubious honesty, and rabid partisanship make clear he doesn‚Äôt have what it takes.
Brett Kavanaugh called the confirmation process a national disgrace, but through that process, the American people saw clearly just what kind of person he is: a national disgrace.
Before long, we are going to be spending more on interest payments on our debt than we spend on the military.		The Republicans are literally driving this country into the ground. #VoteBlue2018 to save America!
That Senate Republicans hired an outside, and female, lawyer to question Dr. Ford isn‚Äôt just cowardly‚Äîit‚Äôs pathetic. They know they have no grounds to doubt Dr. Ford‚Äôs honesty; they‚Äôre only interested in playing politics and accumulating more power. #VoteThemOut!
@585Conservative @RepChrisCollins It was an idea, not a conclusion. Your bio does not specify where you live, as you know
@585Conservative @RepChrisCollins I didn‚Äôt come to any conclusion; that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking. Presumably your Twitter handle is a reference to your area code, and his district partly overlaps with the 585 area code. Is he your rep?
@585Conservative @SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Seems to me that Kavanaugh is also being judged by the American people‚Äîand their representatives in the Senate
When Trump claimed at the #UNGA that his administration has accomplished more than any other, the nations of the world laughed in his face.		I get that he‚Äôs too out of touch to feel shame, but I can‚Äîand right now I‚Äòm feeling a whole lot of shame at how far our country has fallen.
@585Conservative @SenateDems @SenateGOP Hmm. Don‚Äôt I recall you being on the bandwagon of all the ridiculously outlandish allegations against Hillary during the campaign?
@585Conservative wait a sec, is @RepChrisCollins your representative??
@585Conservative @SenateDems @SenateGOP What we‚Äôve seen is accounts from numerous people throughout his life that make it perfectly clear he‚Äôs the type of guy who feels entitled to force himself on women against their will. That type of person has no place on our Supreme Court.
@KeysToTheCourt1 @SenateDems @SenateGOP One would‚Äîbut not when corrupt Republicans are the ones making the call.
@cocobadu I think not.
Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh are a match made in hell for the American people: the most corrupt president in US history and a would-be Supreme Court Justice who believes presidents are above the law.
@585Conservative @SenateDems @SenateGOP I think we‚Äôve seen plenty to have a clear idea of just what kind of person he is. Why not pick, since you mentioned it, a good judge for the court?
Attention United States Senate: you do not have to confirm Brett #Kavanaugh. There are plenty of good judges in this country; you do not have to place one with a history of sexual assault and misogyny on the Supreme Court.		@SenateDems @SenateGOP
@Gallaecian Voting her conscience. Sign of a good public servant
@kathcor Good for her!
Josh Hawley complains that Sen. McCaskill won‚Äôt say how she‚Äôll vote on #Kavanaugh‚Äîbut how could she when Brett‚Äôs accuser hasn‚Äôt been given the chance to speak yet? Hawley‚Äôs attack underscores that the GOP has no interest in learning the facts or taking sex abuse seriously.
@JHenline Nobody‚Äôs picking and choosing, my friend. Presidents aren‚Äôt above the law. Period.		Had there been reason to believe Obama had committed any crimes, I‚Äôd support a subpoena. That‚Äôs how justice works.
@JHenline It‚Äôs about Trump because he‚Äôs the president, and we are talking about presidents.....
@JHenline Have you read the constitution? Because I have, and I can tell for a fact that nowhere in there does it say the president is above the law. If you disagree, show me the text backing you up.
One of the foundational principles of the United States is that NOBODY is above the law. The notion that Trump can't be subpoenaed just because he's the president is like saying your local police chief can't be pulled over for speeding. In a word, it's corruption.
@PaulRoundy1 Yes
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt involve me. This has nothing to do with Russian collusion."		That was Trump on Manafort's conviction, seeming to admit he colluded with Russia to subvert the election and is now desperately painting the Mueller investigation as a "witch hunt" to avoid justice.
@PaulRoundy1 Your later point about about valedictorians is true, but I‚Äôm gonna have to challenge this one. Just yesterday I read about a female shooter. I‚Äôve read about nonwhite shooters in CA, NY, TX, IA, FL...
Mueller's instructions were to investigate #TrumpRussia collusion and any other crimes he discovered along the way. Paul Manafort's bank and tax fraud fit squarely within that scope.		In the United States of America, crimes have consequences‚Äîeven if you're a powerful Republican.
When a young female college student in Iowa was killed last month by a latino immigrant, the entire Trump-GOP-Fox universe went ballistic.		When a young female college student in Iowa was killed Monday by a white American, they didn‚Äôt notice.		Our worst suspicions are confirmed.
In recent weeks we learned that Trump committed serious campaign finance crimes, Manafort and Cohen committed bank &amp; tax fraud, one Republican in Congress committed insider trading, and another used campaign money on vacations to Italy. America is drowning in the Trump Swamp.
@bobhaydensson @tedcruz Probably because the GOP is corrupt af
One of the slimiest swamp creatures, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, is sending voters a fundraising letter marked as an ‚Äúofficial summons.‚Äù That‚Äôs right‚Äîhe‚Äôs literally tricking Texans into donating to his campaign. Unbelievable!! #CorruptGOP #VoteBeto
@585Conservative I mean... the climate has always been changing. The problem is that as of very recently it has started changing at a VERY different pace, due to the skyrocketing concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. We should do something about it, shouldn‚Äôt we?
@585Conservative Not at all; the Paris Accords haven‚Äôt even gone into effect yet. However, if we continue to pretend climate change doesn‚Äôt exist, people will absolutely die who wouldn‚Äôt have died had we taken it seriously. Of course, that may be after your time, so perhaps you don‚Äôt care
@585Conservative Lol wait each of the last 5 or so years have been the hottest year on record...
It's a sad day for the United States when a sitting senator (hey @LindseyGrahamSC) describes the president committing coordinated and severe campaign finance crimes as a "partisan" issue.
Thinking about everyone in North Carolina dealing with #Florence right now. Stay safe, stay strong. We are with you.		Now if only the federal government would take the threat of hurricanes and the effects of climate change seriously...
@boris3324 I believe that‚Äôs where
It's important that justice be served in Trump's campaign finance crimes, but I hope he doesn't think any of us will be distracted from the much more serious issue: his collusion with Russia to win the election. #TrumpRussia
Michael Cohen hid $14 million in debt from the bank when he took out a loan to pay off Stormy Daniels. He broke the law to break the law, at the direction of Donald Trump. Let that sink in.
Trump is complaining it's "sad" that Paul #Manafort was convicted for crimes he committed. At this point, it's hard to understand what Trump's idea of "justice" is; he's certainly not a fan of law and order.
Never before in history has a president so sought to damage and undermine the law enforcement and intelligence agencies that keep our country safe. Donald Trump is a dangerous maniac and must be removed from office immediately. #ImpeachTrumpNow
Thanks to Trump and the #CorruptGOP‚Äôs reckless slash-and-spend governance, the deficit is the highest it‚Äôs been since 2012 (the middle of the recovery). Don‚Äôt worry, though‚Äîthey‚Äôre making a killing off it! #VoteThemOut

@Cittizen1 @JohnKerry Oh, I see. Yeah that sounds potentially like a Logan Act violation
@Cittizen1 @JohnKerry lol are you talking about the Secretary of State negotiating with another country??
As #Florence heads for the Carolinas, it‚Äôs pretty discomforting to see that rather than learn from the mistakes of his response to hurricanes #Maria and #Harvey, Trump instead chooses to make up fake death tolls and denies hobbling FEMA. So sorry, Carolinians...
Trump: "The wall is getting longer and taller and stronger each and every day."		Reality: the wall hasn't been started, and it won't ever be started, because it's an awful idea and a colossal waste of money.	#AnotherTrumpLie
@Cittizen1 Lol
During the 2016 campaign, Trump requested that a hostile foreign nation break US law and intervene in the election to help him. That is attempted collusion. Hours later, Russia complied. #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump
By undermining all attempts to hold Russia accountable for their attacks on our democracy, Trump is effectively inviting Russia to intervene in future elections as well, implying there would be no US response. That is collusion‚Äîand treason #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump #TraitorTrump
After writing the #GOPTaxScam law that will push deficits past $1 trillion and initiate a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the donor class, Trump‚Äôs swamp creatures are now cashing in and becoming lobbyists. The corruption of this administration is repulsive.
Trump promised to #DrainTheSwamp. Instead, Washington is more corrupt than it‚Äôs ever been, as the #CorruptGOP politicians who wrote the disastrous Republican tax scam are moving in droves to become lobbyists. Just #AnotherTrumpLie
The Democratic Party is not about hatred of Trump. With that said, every American who cares about the wellbeing of their country should feel the pressing urgency to free our country of this corrupt, incompetent, and destructive maniac.
Trump enacted a regulation that would allow him to detain migrant children even longer‚Äîan action that is both amoral and illegal, and something he claimed to ‚Äúhate‚Äù doing. The cruelty of this administration is sickening. #AbolishTrump
Just so we are all on the same page: the economy is still doing well, as it has been since about midway through Obama‚Äôs presidency. That‚Äôs it. Everything else about our country‚Äîour society, our credibility, and our democratic institutions‚Äîis on fire. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
By letting the criminal Chinese company ZTE continue to buy sensitive American technology, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are prioritizing jobs in China over US national security. What the hell is wrong with these people??
The Russians are working every day to undermine and compromise not just our elections but also our power grid. Meanwhile, the president goes golfing every weekend and tweets that the problem doesn‚Äôt exist. This isn‚Äôt just dereliction of duty‚Äîit‚Äôs treason. #TrumpRussia
Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to let the criminal Chinese company ZTE stay in business is a downright shameful capitulation to Beijing.		Make no mistake: Trump‚Äôs profound weakness is the United States‚Äô most serious national security threat.
Donald Trump is both a product and perpetrator of the obsessive, crazed hyper-partisanship that is a sickness in our nation. His politicization of critical US institutions like the census bureau and the FBI is an assault on the United States that will take years to undo.
Today:	-Trump in day two of meltdown over critical op-ed in New York Times	-Administration unilaterally extends the amount of time they can imprison immigrant children for	-Republicans argue to a federal judge in Texas that Obamacare is unconstitutional	#VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
Today: Trump publicly obsesses over a scathing op-ed written in the New York Times by a senior administration official, and Republicans continue to work quietly and diligently to destroy Obamacare and take away your health insurance with arguments before a federal judge in Texas
By firing James Comey for corrupt political‚Äîand likely criminal‚Äîreasons, Trump weakened the FBI and thus US national security; an internal survey shows FBI agents have less confidence in the agency‚Äôs current leadership than they had in Comey. #ImpeachTrump

@realDonaldTrump Yes. Clearly. #ImpeachTrump
Internal FBI surveys make it perfectly clear that when Donald Trump said he fired Comey because the FBI had lost confidence in his leadership, he was lying through his teeth. #AnotherTrumpLie #ImpeachTrump
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump But they have uncovered enough crimes to warrant umpteen indictments, convictions, and guilty pleas. Let‚Äôs clean this place up!
Hillary Clinton called racists deplorable and Fox News melted down. Donald Trump calls Jeff Sessions a ‚Äúdumb Southerner‚Äù and Republicans don‚Äôt bat an eye. That‚Äôs logical.
Recordings seized from Cohen make clear that Trump and the publisher AMI illegally conspired to silence witnesses to Trump‚Äôs infidelity, despite months of lies to the contrary. This is another clear-cut campaign finance violation from the most corrupt president in history.
To the #CorruptGOP politicians still trying to demonize Hillary and Obama despite thousands of man-hours and millions dollars of ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù turning up zero evidence to substantiate any of their wild claims: thank you for making the point for us. #VoteBlue
@albybrava They never DID such a thing lol. You don‚Äôt have to talk in hypotheticals here. We saw 8 years of a clean, drama-free presidency. Now we have the ultimate contrast
Donald Trump tweeted this morning that the attorney general shouldn‚Äôt bring charges against two extremely corrupt GOP congressmen because he‚Äôs worried it will hurt their electoral chances.		Trump is absolutely the most corrupt politician in US history.
@realDonaldTrump You are absolutely disgusting to suggest that justice should be delayed or denied to boost Republicans‚Äô electoral chances
@realDonaldTrump Unethical conduct? Coming from the most corrupt politician in US history? Wow!
Trump is going out of his way to skew the #census with a citizenship question, hoping to continue over-representing Republicans. He probably doesn‚Äôt know that the census is mandated by the Constitution, but it‚Äôs also entirely possible that he just doesn‚Äôt care. #CorruptGOP
Looking at the actions of Donald Trump and the Republicans who control Congress over the past year and a half, it‚Äôs clear the American people are a very low priority for them‚Äîwell after China, Russia, and North Korea. #VoteBlue2018 to put #AmericaFirst!
One of the Russian spies who was literally working here in the United States on the #TrumpRussia election interference operation has been arrested and indicted, and Trump STILL pretends the #Mueller investigation is a baseless. This guy has no problem lying to the American public
Washington has never been more of a swamp than it is under Donald Trump, with special interests influencing every cabinet decision and corrupt insiders selling access to an easily-bought president. #VoteBlue to #DrainTheSwamp!
‚ÄúI and your friends in America can‚Äôt make it any easier for you than that.‚Äù Those are the words of a Republican operative to arrested Russian agent Maria Butina after aiding her efforts to influence the election.		They colluded. #Collusion #RisForRussia
Especially proud to be a Californian after our state legislature passed the nation‚Äôs best net neutrality law. @MarcLevine_CA and @ilike_mike, thank you for sticking up for Californians!
New emails show that the Trump Administration took office already set on undermining the #census by adding a citizenship question. It‚Äôs yet another lie from a president with no respect for the American people or the Constitution.
‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing and what you‚Äôre reading is not what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù		That‚Äôs right: Donald Trump is now trying to convince the American people that the things we see him do with our own eyes are not actually happening.
@theclew24 That ‚Äústudy‚Äù was debunked. If we‚Äôre spending billions of dollars, it‚Äôs gonna be for a real reason.
Trump is doubling down on his threat to shut down the government unless Democrats in Congress agree to throw billions of our tax dollars away on a useless wall. This guy is a maniac and a threat to the country. #VoteThemOut
@tabatkins It‚Äôs tactics (family separation and inhumane imprisonment of children) are dictated by Sessions and Trump. It‚Äôs duties (immigration and customs enforcement) have always existed, but they were carried out by INS before INS was dissolved. Would you prefer to bring INS back?
Just gonna point out something Trump doesn‚Äôt seem get: Putin says the Russians are so slick that if they interfered in our election we‚Äôd never know, but they totally botched their assassination attempt in England and ended up killing an innocent bystander... ü§î #TrumpRussia
Trump and the GOP claimed the FBI withheld the political motives of the Steele Dossier when presenting its claims to the FISA court, but the documents Trump released show the FBI spent more than a page disclosing that fact. Trump and the GOP lied to the public‚ÄîAGAIN  #TrumpRussia
@mongo_ebooks Trump is the human rights violator. Don‚Äôt let yourself be distracted.
@dogbulb What about it
@AlexJayBrady At the end of the day, Putin doesn‚Äôt care what Trump does to children. All he cares about is weakening the US by polarizing and dividing our society
@585Conservative Lol what a fantasy!
Many Republicans in Congress who enable Trump‚Äôs lies and corruption will cruise to reelection, while the honest few who put America before Trump have a difficult fall ahead of them. It‚Äôs a clear sign of what the #GOP stands for: protecting Trump, and nothing else. #VoteBlue
‚ÄúI am ready for further orders.‚Äù		-Arrested Russian agent Maria Butina to Russian oligarch/official Alexander Torshin immediately after the 2016 election, in which she worked to get Trump elected. #TrumpRussia
@ATPJudge Exactly! There‚Äôs something reasonable to get behind.
By releasing the FISA warrants to surveil Carter Page, Trump not only damaged national security, but proved that the #GOP memo and Trump‚Äôs twitter tantrums claiming impropriety were somewhere between misleading and total lies. #TrumpRussia
With the growth of ‚ÄúAbolish ICE‚Äù on twitter, I worried that the Democratic Party was becoming as reactionary as the GOP. Now, we know that much of this growth was being fanned by Russian bots to make the Dems look extremist before the midterms. I should have known. #TrumpRussia
@realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre always freaking out about leakers in the White House, right?
@realDonaldTrump Dude how the hell are you still employed by anyone
@realDonaldTrump Lol it‚Äôs always kinda creepy when you play pretend president, but this is an entirely different level of bizarre.
It‚Äôs no coincidence that Trump tweets ‚Äúit‚Äôs beginning to look a lot more like the DNC colluded with Russia‚Äù just as it‚Äôs beginning to look a lot more like Republicans knowingly colluded with Russia to get Trump elected. #TrumpRussia
Ron DeSantis, GOP candidate for governor of Florida, told voters not to ‚Äúmonkey this up‚Äù by voting for the state‚Äôs first black governor.		What‚Äôs wrong with these people? Has every Republican politician in the country lost all sense of basic human decency? #RacistGOP #RisforRacism
To me, the essence of being a Democrat is the belief that nobody should have to get screwed over. That‚Äôs the antithesis of today‚Äôs Republican Party, which‚Äîas has been made all too clear in the last few weeks alone‚Äîstands for self-enrichment at the expense of anyone they can screw
It is now clear Donald Trump broke a range of laws in his bid to be elected president, ranging from campaign finance violations to possible treason. It is time for him to be impeached.
Trump actually believes he can convince Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons‚Äîwhich, of course, he can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a symptom of his malignant narcissism; he believes he is so irresistible that Kim won‚Äôt be able to say no to him‚Äîa delusion with potentially dangerous consequences.
@JHenline Lol and how is that clear
After reading administration officials‚Äô testimony in sanctions hearings before Congress, it‚Äôs clear that the Trump Administration is protecting Russia. The question every American should be asking is why.		#TrumpRussia
His politics aside, John McCain was a national hero. He endured torture while serving his country, and chose to continue serving‚Äîand Trump had to be shamed into making such a small gesture of respect as lowering the flag over the White House. So sad.
On the question of who will be appointed to fill John McCain‚Äôs seat, convicted criminal and racist-sheriff-turned-Senate-candidate Joe Arpaio says he wants someone who will ‚Äúprotect our president‚Äù‚Äînot the American people or the Constitution, but Trump. Disgusting.
@Amber_305 A lot of the people that cross the border illegally come in vehicles through the road crossings or go in tunnels. A lot of the drugs that come in come by boat. It‚Äôs most definitely a waste. What we need is a simple fence and better sensors
It‚Äôs sickening to watch how Trump goes to rallies and whips the crowd into a frenzy with lie after vicious lie about Democrats. It‚Äôs not even about making a point to him‚Äîit‚Äôs just about stoking blind hatred and division. So destructive to our country.
@BayhiBab012 @POTUS Convinced? I‚Äôll wait for the full report. But all the evidence we‚Äôve seen so far is pretty damning
@Amber_305 No, I‚Äôm not really for wasting $25 billion...
Trump likes to complain that Democrats are blocking his appointees, but he hasn‚Äôt even bothered to make nominations to extremely important posts like our embassies in Saudi Arabia and Australia.		It‚Äôs not obstructionism; he‚Äôs just terrible at his job (or busy tweeting &amp; golfing).
@tweetsbynumber3 @GOP Right, but Trump isn‚Äôt interested in reducing border crossings. He‚Äôs interested in building a wall.
Trump went out in front of a crowd of West Virginians and told them ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù is already being built. He lied to their faces.
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos wants to divert schools‚Äô money to buy guns and put them in schools. This is the NRA‚Äôs wet dream, and every parent and student‚Äôs nightmare.		I am speechless.
@Poconosguy ICE isn‚Äôt the problem. Trump‚Äôs sadistic policies‚Äîwhich he orders ICE to enforce‚Äîare the problem. Impeach Trump to restore lawfulness to our borders!
@mdash310 ICE isn‚Äôt the problem. Trump‚Äôs sadistic policies‚Äîwhich he orders ICE to enforce‚Äîare the problem.
If you‚Äôre a Democrat who believes we should abolish ICE, I question your judgement. If you‚Äôre a Democrat who SAYS we should abolish ICE‚Äîright before the midterm elections‚ÄîI question your sanity.
Donald Trump reportedly asked his aides, ‚ÄúWe started with collusion. How did we end up here?‚Äù		The answer: by continuing to make bad choices, commit crimes, lie about it, and not resign.

@cathykaku1 @Rep_Hunter @GOP It‚Äôs starting to look like maybe not...
In his indictment, you can read GOP Congressman Duncan Hunter‚Äôs texts to his wife about buying his ‚ÄúHawaii shorts‚Äù with campaign funds and writing off the expense as a donation to Wounded Warriors. Now he has the nerve to call his indictment ‚Äúpolitically motivated?‚Äù Shameless.
Rudy Giuliani has been saying in interviews that he‚Äôs discussed pardoning Manafort with Trump, but also that pardoning Manafort is ‚Äúnot under consideration.‚Äù		If Trump is talking about it with his lawyer, it is by definition under consideration...	#TrumpRussia
Unbelievable that Donald Trump would go on Fox News and declare that testifying as a witness to crimes committed by the president and his inner circle should be illegal. He really has lost all ability to hide his authoritarian fantasies.
@raijjn2 I‚Äôd agree with you there, although using illegal campaign contributions to silence mistresses is almost as bad
Bank fraud. Tax evasion. Collusion. Campaign finance violations. Lying to investigators. White House. Congress. Presidential campaign. 		The one word that ties these things together in Trump‚Äôs Washington?		#Republicans.
@raijjn2 I think you might be in the wrong country
For Donald Trump to say he‚Äôs not sure whether to trust American intelligence and law enforcement officers over the dictator of Russia about crimes that dictator committed against our country is a searing insult to these patriotic Americans, who are trying to help Trump succeed.

@e92sam @Rep_Hunter That‚Äôs really sad to hear. Reading the evidence in the indictment, and seeing the scheming texts between him and his wife, you honestly wonder how people end up like that. 		Anyways, thank you for your service.

@IminHisbook @MrWonderful054 Lol good point
@gardedan @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends He was trying to use an adjective, because he was describing a person. Democrat is the noun and Democratic is the adjective, so a person who is a Democrat is Democratic. 		Thus, an Assemblyman who is a Democrat is a Democratic Assemblyman. üòä

@SaffirahShadow @krobin1014 I think the vast majority of us are.
Sorry, but the argument that a sitting president can't be held accountable for campaign finance crimes is totally ridiculous; it's effectively saying "You can cheat in elections as long as you win." Trump will face justice.
@TA_WYMAN @SABER2555 There has to be evidence beyond reasonable doubt that you committed a crime in order to be prosecuted.
With yesterday's developments, Americans have gotten a distant whiff of justice for the first time in nearly two years. Now it's time for Congress to do their job and ensure that justice is served: #ImpeachTrump.
@realDonaldTrump Campaign finance violations are absolutely crimes, you liar.
@585Conservative I am (pretty clearly, I think) not saying that. I'm saying it seems like they're not even trying that hard to hide the fact that revoking the clearance was an act of partisan retribution, which is disgusting and lowly.
Giuliani said ‚ÄúWe could find out a lot of reasons that [Brennan] should have [had his clearance revoked].‚Äù So... he's admitting they revoked his clearance without any reason?
President Trump had some touching words for Paul #Manafort this morning. Maybe he‚Äôll get lucky and get the cell next to him.		#CohenFlipped
@realDonaldTrump Sweet of you. Maybe you‚Äôll be lucky and get the cell next to him.		#Manafort #Cohen #Guilty
@realDonaldTrump Lol having a little buyer‚Äôs remorse?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The word is Democratic, but I guess your mind is elsewhere at the moment.		#Cohen #Manafort
For the first time in my life, I cannot wait to see what @realDonaldTrump tweets when he wakes up.		#Cohen #Manafort
Even as Trump continues to claim he has ‚Äúsolved North Korea‚Äù (?), Mike Pompeo admits that they are continuing to produce nuclear material‚Äîthat is, the threat is continuing to grow. #AnotherTrumpLie #TrumpLiesMatter
Mike Pompeo in one breath says that we should only worry about the administration‚Äôs policy, not Trump‚Äôs words‚Äîand in the next says that Trump‚Äôs words ‚Äúare, in fact, policy.‚Äù What a disgraceful and disingenuous excuse for a public servant. #TrumpRussia
Donald Trump tweeted that North Korea is ‚Äúno longer a threat‚Äù‚Äîand all Kim had to do was recycle the same empty promises his regime made to the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations. Trump is dangerously gullible.
@realDonaldTrump You hired Jeff Sessions, idiot!
Kudos to the 1,000+ Google employees who signed a letter protesting Google‚Äôs work to build a censored search engine for the Chinese government. Enabling repression is far beneath such a great American company.
Desperate to claim a success, Trump has been tweeting that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat. Meanwhile in North Korea, Kim Jong Un is firing up a massive new nuclear reactor that will allow him to quintuple his nuclear weapons production capacity.
Chris Collins, one of Trump‚Äôs earliest and loudest cheerleaders in Congress, will not run for re-election‚Äîbecause he‚Äôll be busy dealing with the fact that he was just caught committing insider trading. #VoteBlue2018 to kick the #CorruptGOP out of Congress!
Sheldon Adelson‚Äôs casino made $700 million off the GOP tax scam. Valero made $1.9 billion in one quarter alone. Republicans in Congress aren‚Äôt working for us; they‚Äôre working for their donors.		#VoteBlue2018 to kick out the #CorruptGOP
Trump claims that Brennan used his ‚Äúaccess to highly sensitive information‚Äù to make ‚Äúunfounded and outrageous allegations.‚Äù		But if Brennan‚Äôs observations were really unfounded, revoking his access to classified info wouldn‚Äôt change anything. Sometimes Trump is so dumb it hurts.
I can‚Äôt help but notice that there seems to be a direct correlation between Republican officials‚Äô support for Trump and their level of corruption...
Under Trump, hate crimes are up 12% from 2016, at their highest level in a decade. We need to elect a Democratic president who will be tough on crime and tough on hate‚Äîunlike the current president, who turns a blind eye to both.
The sad truth is that Russia will not cease its attacks on our democracy unless Trump makes clear they will pay a price, which he refuses to do because Republicans benefit politically from Russia‚Äôs meddling. He is complicit. This is #treason. #TrumpRussia
Trump‚Äôs decision to cancel the military parade is a small victory for American taxpayers‚Äîbut in an era when Republicans are sending the deficit towards $1 trillion, I guess we should take anything we can get.
Kris Kobach has just been nominated as the GOP candidate for governor in Kansas‚Äîthe same Kris Kobach who led Trump‚Äôs crusade to disenfranchise voters. This does not bode well for the people of Kansas.
Trump admin calls new #Russia sanctions severely harsh, but ‚Äùoutside experts said the actual amount of exports involved is fairly small because the Obama administration already banned exports to Russia that could have military purposes.‚Äù Typical. -@nytimes
Saw some photos from a small racist rally over the weekend. Always interesting to me to see how white nationalists choose to wave American flags; do they not realize that flag stands for the polar opposite of everything they represent? üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@Cittizen1 @YouTube @CNN @TheDemocrats @TODAYshow @GMA @SenSanders @TheView @chuckschumer @HuffPost Yes, because it‚Äôs illegal. Welcome aboard.
Giuliani to ABC: Trump told Comey to go easy on Flynn	Giuliani to CNN: Trump and Comey never discussed Flynn	CNN: but you told ABC they did	Giuliani: no I didn‚Äôt! That‚Äôs crazy!		I think I finally get why Trump calls it Fake News CNN: because they keep broadcasting his lies!
‚ÄúPeople always complained about prices, but they still vote for the one guy they complain about. We used to call such people sheep, but sheep are clever. When it rains they go into the barn, not under the tree. But... they still voted [#Erdogan] in.‚Äù -Turkish retiree
Paul Manafort‚Äôs lawyers couldn‚Äôt find a single witness to testify that he isn‚Äôt corrupt. Even #Manafort couldn‚Äôt bring himself to testify. Why did Trump put a bankrupt stooge for pro-Kremlin Ukrainians in charge of his campaign? #TrumpRussia
Trump seems to believe his own lies, tweeting that the #Mueller investigation should end now that the FBI has fired Peter Strzok (which he pressured them to do). But Strzok just worked there; he didn‚Äôt start the investigation, and he wasn‚Äôt the reason it existed. #TrumpRussia
@realDonaldTrump This is exactly what happens when you start to believe your own lies. Strzok didn‚Äôt start #Mueller‚Äôs #TrumpRussia investigation, nor was he the reason it existed. You‚Äôre not doing yourself any favors with all these alternative facts; you‚Äôre just confusing yourself.
Obama and the leaders of the Pacific built the #TPP to protect against China‚Äôs attempts to strongarm its neighbors and undermine the US. Trump knowingly threw all that away, jeopardizing the future of our economic security, and all out of petty jealousy. #ChinaFirst
...Mueller
@Jose10765510 @NRA @elibeckman Good catch
The #TrumpRussia attack is the Pearl Harbor of our era‚Äîexcept this time, the enemy had help on the inside (Republicans operatives), and instead of defending the nation, the president willingly invites the same attack to happen again. #ImpeachTrump #Treason
Trump repeatedly denied knowing about the hush money paid to silence his mistress before the election (an illegal campaign contribution). Now, we can all hear the recording of him discussing that payment as it happened. Congress must #impeach this pathological liar! #TrumpLies
You know Trump is terrified they‚Äôre about to find evidence of collusion when he starts tweeting that collusion (aka conspiracy, treason) isn‚Äôt a crime. #TrumpRussia #TrumpColluded
@BKaysac ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Cittizen1 If you‚Äôve already given up on him keeping his promises in the first term, I‚Äôd ask why you think he‚Äôd suddenly start keeping his word in the second.
The @NRA helped arrested Russian agent Maria Butina in her efforts to compromise the 2016 election, even repeatedly flying her to the United States before she had a visa. #Muller should investigate whether the NRA was complicit in Russia‚Äôs attacks on our democracy.
Mike Pence wrote that high officials should be removed from office if they demonstrate extreme immorality. By his own criteria, both he and the president he voted for should be impeached.
Trump campaigned on two primary, incredibly destructive ideas: repealing #ObamaCare and building a hugely expensive border wall. Every American should be thankful that he has done neither.
@SmargJones @fmkaplan Pretty interesting that this graphic was made when we all know millions more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump, right?
After the Helsinki meeting at which Trump all but bowed down to Putin, Republicans in Congress admitted they were disgusted‚Äîand still did nothing to hold Trump accountable, because they‚Äôre too worried about staying in office.		#VoteBlue to get some moral courage in Congress!
We have never had a more corrupt president than Donald Trump.
Participating in a panel discussion on #PublicService with @canalalliance and @DowntownStreets, hosted by @MarcLevine_CA and some very impressive local interns! https://t.co/BogUd1RKfw
By letting ZTE continue to steal sensitive American intellectual property, Republicans in Washington are giving China a HUGE leg up in its bid to beat the US to developing the technologies of tomorrow, such as 5G. What happened to #AmericaFirst? All we are seeing is #ChinaFirst!
Had a great time at @MarcLevine_CA‚Äôs Intern Summit this afternoon! Thanks so much to Assemblyman Levine, the other panelists, and the awesome interns for putting it all together! #PublicService for the win https://t.co/tRf7Do81pL
I support ICE (not the cruel policies Trump orders them to enforce), but I have to notice that Republicans see abolishing ICE as sacrilege while they think of dissolving the Department of Education and the Department of Energy as ‚Äúsmall government.‚Äù More GOP hypocrisy.
One of Trump‚Äôs earliest supporters in Congress was just arrested for insider trading. Enough with these corrupt Republicans; #VoteBlue2018 to put regular people first!
@BobcCrews He‚Äôs a devout hedonist
Here are some ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù Republican policies:	-tearing children away from their parents	-imprisoning kids in cages	-preventing family-based immigration (unless Melania‚Äôs family)	#VoteBlue2018
@Cittizen1 @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump So why is it a huge deal when other immigrants legally obtain citizenship for their parents?
@IreneEggink @ylimaf6 @angelamblas @ShepRose Without a doubt
@hotjamalle Fair point
@angelamblas @ShepRose What country are you in?
@ShepRose @djh0002002 It‚Äôs Russian
@Vitriol781 The lack of shame in that family is disturbing... almost inhuman...
@IppolitoMari @mampdx Well put
@GrismoreLori @ShepRose I guess that would lead me to question your definition of the word ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù ;)
@GrismoreLori @ShepRose Lol do I?
@angelamblas @ShepRose What part of this tweet are you mistaking for conjecture? Genuinely curious.
@EarlBCurtis1 Not complaining about family based migration‚Äîcomplaining about the disgusting level of hypocrisy.
@5dogs2catsBrown @mr_oogy_boogy @FLOTUS You better believe it
So... Melania Trump‚Äôs parents became citizens today through ‚Äúchain migration‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs right, the same ‚Äúchain migration‚Äù that Trump and his extremists won‚Äôt stop screaming about. The levels of hypocrisy are incomprehensible.
One of Trump‚Äôs earliest supporters, @RepChrisCollins, was just arrested for insider trading. #DrainTheSwamp was a total lie; these people are getting rich off Trump‚Äôs corruption. It‚Äôs time to throw out the #CorruptGOP and put regular people first! #VoteBlue2018!
Statement of fact: it‚Äôs a violation of US election law for a campaign to receive help from a foreign power. However, the Trump campaign‚Äôs #TrumpRussia collusion rises to the level of treason because Russia is an adversary of the United States intent on weakening us. #ImpeachTrump
@realTimPruitt Doing opposition research is one thing. Receiving stolen materials on your opponent from a foreign adversary interested in undermining your country is another thing entirely, and it‚Äôs illegal. You know this, though.
Trump says he‚Äôll spend six or seven days a week campaigning for vulnerable Republicans. Why doesn‚Äôt he actually do some work, and fix some of the problems he‚Äôs created? We aren‚Äôt paying him to campaign! #CorruptGOP #VoteThemOut
Trump‚Äòs efforts to further sabotage our dysfunctional #healthcare system‚Äîby removing protections for those with preexisting conditions and allowing insurance companies to peddle junk insurance‚Äîwould enrich insurance companies while endangering tons of Americans. #VoteBlue2018
The Director of National Intelligence‚ÄîTrump‚Äôs Director‚Äîhas made clear that the level of Russian cyberattacks against our country today is directly analogous to the terror threats immediately before 9/11. Why doesn‚Äôt Trump do something?? #TrumpRussia #TraitorTrump
Director of National Intelligence: ‚ÄúToday, the digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under attack.‚Äù Trump not only doesn‚Äôt respond; he pretends it‚Äôs not happening. It‚Äôs not just that he doesn‚Äôt understand; he doesn‚Äôt care. #ImpeachTrump #TrumpRussia
Donald Trump needs to understand that #wildfire isn‚Äôt a partisan issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a public safety emergency. It‚Äôs time for the sociopath in the Oval Office to stop looking for political points on the backs of thousands of Californians threatened by the fires, and start helping people.
Republicans in Congress have completely caved to Trump‚Äôs #ChinaFirst policy, letting Chinese company ZTE off the hook after repeatedly breaking US law. Turns out #AmericaFirst was just another Trump lie...
As a public official, Ivanka Trump leaves much to be desired, both in terms of what she does and doesn‚Äôt do‚Äîbut she deserves unqualified praise for being one of the few to stand by the free press as a corrupt and dishonest administration viciously demonizes them.
At events in Ohio, Trump and Pence told voters that House candidate @dannyoconnor1 is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi‚Äîeven though they both know that‚Äôs not true; O‚ÄôConnor has said repeatedly that he wouldn‚Äôt even back Pelosi for speaker. Enough with these lying #Republicans! #VoteBlue
Trump says Russia is unhappy that he won, even though our own intelligence agencies‚Äînot to mention Putin himself‚Äîhave repeatedly said Russia wanted him to win. #TrumpLiesMatter #TrumpRussia #Mueller
In 2014, @RandPaul wrote that the United States should isolate #Russia ‚Äúif it insists on acting like a rogue nation.‚Äù Not sure what could have changed his mind, but today he is in Russia‚Äîpraising them. Maybe he‚Äôs just grateful for all their hard work getting #Republicans elected?
A new report from @USGAO confirms what we already knew: Trump‚Äôs border wall would be a totally useless waste of billions of dollars. Republicans in Washington are playing politics with our money. #VoteThemOut #VoteBlue2018
@jadegreen64 Not a chance lol
Trump: ‚ÄúPresident Obama failed very badly with Crimea.‚Äù	Also Trump: we‚Äôll be reviewing whether #Russia‚Äôs actions regarding Crimea deserve a response	Explanation: he has no clue what Crimea is or that Russia invaded and annexed it	Alternate explanation: Trump is beholden to Russia
@realDonaldTrump Omg haha you‚Äôre insane
‚ÄòIn July 2016, the @FBi learned that Russian operatives had offered help to a Trump campaign aide. A second campaign adviser traveled that month to Russia and met with a suspected Russian intelligence officer.‚Äô -@nytimes #TrumpRussia #Mueller
@DavidJLightman Correct, but it further illustrates that, contrary to what the president continues to insist, the Russian influence campaign that spawned the Mueller investigation was very much real
When Trump campaign officials met a Russian agent at Trump Tower, the campaign said the meeting was about adoption and that Trump had no idea. Trump now admits both were lies: the meeting was #collusion, and Trump personally ordered the false explanation to be made public.
@mystifiedbiu That‚Äôs why he has to be impeached first ;)
Donald Trump now admits his top campaign officials met with a Russian agent to receive dirt on Hillary Clinton. That is collusion. Trump needs to be impeached and charged with treason. Let the trial begin. #TrumpRussia #Mueller #ImpeachTrump #TrumpColluded
@rachelgoodstein @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker Out of curiosity, why did you single out the three reasonable Republicans in the Senate? Definitely all guilty of not doing much to defend our country against Trump, but I‚Äôm just curious why you didn‚Äôt call out the ones who actively aid and abet him
The Trump Administration‚Äôs attempts to undermine the #census with a citizenship question is a perfect example of their corruption and ineptitude, as these crooked partisans attack critical US systems in the hopes of political gain. #VoteThemOut
Here‚Äôs a nice photo of @waynelapierrejr, executive Vice President of @NRA, smiling with arrested Russian agent Maria Butina. The #NRA is apparently happy to work with Russia to undermine our country if it means more money for their corrupt lobbyists. https://t.co/qGEZ8OSfAT
Every single day I am stunned by how many laws Trump, his campaign, and his associates broke and continue to break.		We will have justice. We will have law and order. #ImpeachTrump #Mueller #TrumpRussia
@brasherscott1 Yeah, that‚Äôs not okay. I agree with you. It‚Äôs also the only time Obama ever ‚Äúlied.‚Äù So while I totally agree that that episode was unacceptable, it‚Äôs not really reasonable to compare that situation to a president who happily uses lies as his primary political tool.
@KevinBl47047492 @realDonaldTrump Trump in FL, 7/31: ‚ÄúU.S. Steel just announced that they're building six new steel mills."	Trump in PA, 8/2: ‚ÄúU.S. Steel is opening up seven plants." 		You can lie like the president, but neither of you can change reality. #FactsMatter #TrumpLies
@HC_Richardson @KevinBl47047492 I‚Äôd say ‚Äútroll‚Äù or ‚ÄúRussian agent‚Äù would be a more accurate term in this case (since he responds), but yes, you are clearly right. I reported him after his first tweet to me yesterday afternoon.
@KevinBl47047492 Yeah, that‚Äôs not okay. I feel for you. It‚Äôs also the only time Obama ever ‚Äúlied.‚Äù So while I totally agree that what happened to you was unacceptable, it‚Äôs not really reasonable to compare that situation to a president who happily uses lies as his primary political tool.
@sharonmatt20194 @WileyJeanann The angry kind
@EriqKunz1 Thanks! I really appreciate the kind words!
@AtTheSuper @macasu @Kayjr You‚Äôd probably have to respond as if you were interested. Could actually be a good little investigation! Do you see a way to?
@SerenityFoods Sadly, I fear that‚Äôs exactly the point.
@macasu @Kayjr Interesting. Contact the poster and ask what their affiliation is. Do they just buy merchandise to sell? Are they with a PAC?
@Kayjr @macasu Also gonna point out that an ad like that would be incredibly easy to fake. I can‚Äôt stand when Republicans pretend support for liberal causes is fake, and I‚Äôm not about to assume the people that go to Trump rally‚Äôs aren‚Äôt real fans
@CHebert08745686 @Coalminetweety Let‚Äôs hope to god not
@raijjn2 There‚Äôs nothing manipulative about correcting a lie, my friend
Trump told a rally in #Pennsylvania that US Steel is opening up seven new plants. It is opening zero. He then told the audience not to watch or read the news‚Äîpresumably so they wouldn‚Äôt know he‚Äôd just lied to them. What kind of sick politician manipulates the public like that?
.@marincountyfire we are thinking about your brave firefighters, and especially for the three injured while fighting to protect a community far from their own. Their bravery and compassion inspires us, and we thank you all for your service. #CarrFire
@__bobbyp__ Non-citizens can‚Äôt vote. Unless you‚Äôre a Russian bot, you‚Äòre presumably an adult who grew up in this country, and you should understand the most basic elements of our democracy. We shouldn‚Äôt have to be telling you this.
My statement on the three Marin County firefighters injured while fighting the Carr Fire near Redding. So glad all three will be okay, and very admiring of their sacrifice. https://t.co/y8SBgShx7b
The root of the problem we have with Russia is that ignoring Russia‚Äôs provocations and attacks hurts our country‚Äîbut it benefits Trump personally, so he doesn‚Äôt think twice about it. The president is compromised by the Trump Organization‚Äôs financial ties to Russia. #TrumpRussia
Ironically, Trump‚Äôs right about one thing: we are now, without doubt, the laughingstock of the world. #VoteBlue2018
@baobann Thank you!

@Emma76494286 @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @SenateMajLdr @PressSec @GOP @FoxNews @foxandfriends @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @Judgenap Nope
@DarqueQueen7 @cobalttash Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not a valid option. We cannot let a traitor and sociopath stay in the White House for political reasons.
Donald Trump just got on a stage in Pennsylvania and took credit for passing a law that Obama signed in 2014. Then he told the audience not to trust the news, in a cynical bid to keep voters ignorant of his lies.		For the good of the country, he needs to be removed from office.
@linda_brickley I was gonna say... pretty sure it used to be ‚Äú8 angry Democrats‚Äù or something like that back when he started this particular lie
Can somebody tell me who Trump‚Äôs ‚Äú17 angry Democrats‚Äù are? #Muller is Republican, Rosenstein is Republican, Wray is Republican... looks like just #AnotherTrumpLie to me.
@Wendy_Miles1970 @CKJactor @ccharlamb8 @FBI Truer words have rarely been spoken.
@Asa789 The choices of quotes are hilariously ironic, given that Trump was whining about the elections being rigged against him even as his own campaign was colluding with Russia to make sure he won. #TrumpRussia #Mueller
The @FBI‚Äîone of the pillars of American security‚Äîhas become collateral damage in Donald Trump‚Äôs war against those who would protect the US from Russian aggression. Every day Trump remains in office is a threat to our county. #ImpeachTrump
@steves7943 @thegoddelusion1 @PressSec Good on you. I have no compunction saying her eagerness to lie is by far and away the most grotesque thing about her‚Äîalong with her rudeness and indifference to violence against the press. Appearance does not even enter into the equation.
My heartfelt thanks goes to the members of our intelligence, defense, and law enforcement agencies. These patriots just vowed to defend the country from Russian attacks against our midterm elections (attacks happening right now), in spite of Trump‚Äôs complicity. #ThankYou
@steves7943 @thegoddelusion1 @PressSec That‚Äôs fair, but nobody here is talking about her appearance. There are, however, plenty of misogynists who are, so I suggest directing that particular argument to them, rather than at people who agree with you
@steves7943 @thegoddelusion1 @PressSec Any human who lies as much as she does deserves to be berated. That‚Äôs just unacceptable behavior from a public official. Why do you think we berate Trump? #TrumpLiesMatter
Based on their actions, I am concerned that the #NRA‚Äîwhich used to focus on teaching #GunSafety‚Äîsees perpetuating fear and violence as a way increase gun sales, making more money for its lobbyists.
@datdumbfuk @realDonaldTrump Nuclear fuel=fissile material=what creates the nuclear explosion
@steves7943 @thegoddelusion1 @PressSec Talk about a straw man! Nicely done!
The @PressSec‚Äôs refusal to condemn violence against the press is grotesque, disturbing, and deeply un-American.
@realDonaldTrump ...Do you not know what the word ‚Äúrecused‚Äù means?
@realDonaldTrump You forgot to thank him for continuing to produce nuclear fuel and continuing to build ICBMs‚Äîor are we supposed to just pretend that‚Äôs ‚Äú#FakeNews‚Äù while the threat to our country grows?
@realDonaldTrump You literally went out of your way to protect a Chinese company that steals American intellectual property‚Äîbecause the dictator of China told you to. You say #AmericaFirst, but with you it‚Äôs always either China First or Russia First
@MiroWare @JohnCzer1 ‚ÄúNo evidence?‚Äù Why do you think they indicted them? Grabbed a Russian phone book and pointed at names? Come on lol
Maria Butina is the 26th Russian to be indicted by the United States for interfering in our 2016 elections.		26 indictments.		Anyone still claiming the #Mueller investigation is a witch hunt is only interested in protecting Trump, not in protecting the country. #TrumpRussia
Alert: Republicans in Washington are now looking to pass a #GOPTaxScam, part 2: another deficit-busting tax cut, but this time for the wealthy only. This looks like a concerted effort to loot working Americans. #VoteBlue2018
The recorded conversation between Trump and Michael #Cohen makes it almost inconceivable that they did not coordinate an illegal campaign contribution from the National Enquirer. Thank you Robert #Mueller for uncovering another crime on the part of the #Trump campaign.
@realDonaldTrump Lol, the documents you just released last week prove this tweet is a lie...
Even as Republicans move towards bringing us our first trillion-dollar #deficit, Trump is demanding we waste billions more on a pointless wall and threatening to shut down the government if he doesn‚Äôt get it. I honestly didn‚Äôt realize the GOP would #SlashAndSpend like this.

@Cittizen1 @BarackObama @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Again, I‚Äôve told you before and I‚Äôll tell you again: until investigators tell me the Russians swayed the outcome, I have no reason to believe the Russians swayed the outcome
Gerrymandering is disgusting and anathema to the American principle of representative democracy, but Republicans in power are fighting tooth and nail against citizens‚Äô efforts to #UnhackTheVote. #VoteBlue2018 to make your vote count again!!
@Cittizen1 @BarackObama As I recently told you, I do, and I am not overlooking that failure
@585Conservative @POTUS Lol right, because if the president doesn‚Äôt work in IT, there‚Äôs nothing he can do to defend the country but launch nukes
Russia has already launched cyberattacks against two Senate Democrats running for re-election (and zero Republicans, it seems). Why is the president golfing instead of defending our country? #TrumpRussia #TraitorTrump
Thank you @CNN for broadcasting the recording of Trump and Michael Cohen conspiring about hush money payments to Trump‚Äôs mistresses. It‚Äôs critical for the American people to be able to hear these things, because #FactsMatter. #RealNews
Trump campaigned on the lie that he would be tough on #China, yet when the president of China makes demands, Trump obeys. He either thinks we‚Äôre all idiots, or he‚Äôs compromised.
@LadyJFlyte Lol whoa so bitter
@MapwifeJodi Exactly
@ChrisBehner1 @bechey Exactly
@realDonaldTrump If you want ‚Äúno weakness,‚Äù you‚Äôll have to resign
@CathesComicz No doubt Trump has lied often while trying to score political points on the backs of fallen US soldiers, but there are thousands of US remains unaccounted for in North Korea, and many families here waiting to get their relatives back. It‚Äôs sick how Trump politicizes their pain...
@ThisJustInLIVE Absolutely
@CathesComicz ?
Of course, while the return of American remains is an important goodwill step that will help build trust and bring closure for veterans‚Äô families, we must be cleareyed in recognizing that it does nothing whatsoever to reduce the threat North Korea poses to US national security.
@BCAri2016 ?
In an administration marked by ineptitude and corruption, the repatriation of Korean War veterans‚Äô remains appears to be a rare and welcome moment of unmitigated success. Congratulations to all the diplomats who brought about what we hope to be closure for the veterans‚Äô families.

@teresaontwit What is the point of this and why are you bringing it up?
@doncroyal In order to go to prison there has to be a trial, in order for there to be a trial there has to be evidence, and in order for there to be evidence there has to be a crime. I guess conspiracy theories are fun though lol

@DrNostradumass Good point. On the other hand: https://t.co/y36GHQ884X
As EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt relentlessly defrauded the American people. While it would be foolish to hope for justice from the Trump Administration, I fully expect the next president to conduct a full investigation and hold Pruitt accountable for his corruption.
@shep5556 Lol sure, but as you might recall, the whole point of the US is government by the people of the people for the people, not government by the counties of the counties for the counties. I have a feeling you know the ‚Äúlook how red this map is‚Äù argument is totally meaningless haha
@jhillmurphy Boycott their advertisers
@OurRightsCount What kind of fake news does CNN report? What answers did they feed Hillary?
@ShardGooner Trump‚Äôs declaration that he was canceling Ulchi Freedom Guardian took both the US and South Korea by surprise. Xi likely recommended the demand to Kim, and Trump capitulated immediately‚Äîprobably because he had no idea what it really meant
A free and independent press is critical to a democracy‚Äôs health, and I worry that Fox News‚Äô transformation into nothing short of State TV is one of the most corrosive forces acting against our democracy today.
@doctorcherokee 2 problems:	1. Nobody wants North Korea to nuke us	2. They are no further from nuking us than they were when Trump was screaming about fire and fury
There‚Äôs nothing noteworthy or threatening about a hysterical all-caps tweet from the same impotent dotard who canceled US-South Korean exercises‚Äîa huge concession to North Korea‚Äîin exchange for nothing but promises that never materialized. We can all move on with our days.
Regarding Donald Trump‚Äôs threats last night to Iran: we‚Äôve seen him use this same rhetoric towards China and North Korea, only for those standoffs to end with massive US concessions in exchange for broken promises and empty pledges. Why would anyone in Tehran take him seriously?
In an apt metaphor for what they‚Äôre doing to our country, Republicans in Washington are now targeting the Endangered Species Act, which literally saved the bald eagle from extinction. The level of corruption is totally sick.
@realDonaldTrump Lol right
Donald Trump damaged national security by releasing sensitive FISA warrant applications in the hopes of scoring political points‚Äîbut then lied about the contents of those applications, which begs the question: why bother releasing them in the first place?
@HEAVYSOUL67 @BayhiBab012 Now there‚Äôs a false equivalency if I‚Äôve ever seen one!
You are absolutely right. Luckily, the Democratic Party will continue to espouse a platform based on the simple principle that no one should have to get screwed over üòä we will continue trying our best to make lives better! #ProudDemocrat #VoteBlue2018 https://t.co/acMTurudxq
@Cittizen1 @CNN @MSNBC @HillaryClinton @TODAYshow @HuffPost @GMA @TheView @TheDemocrats @Ocasio2018 You are absolutely right. Luckily, the Democratic Party will continue to espouse a platform based on the simple principle that no one should have to get screwed over üòä we will continue trying our best to make lives better! #ProudDemocrat
@nowismytime1 Hahaha
@BeantownBop Thank you for noticing!
@wolters_ann @PamelaPffarrow Which lies are those
Donald Trump told us in Singapore that North Korea was destroying its nuclear missile engine test sites. More than a month later, satellite photos show none of those sites have been touched. #AnotherTrumpLie
It‚Äôs pretty telling that #FakeNews, originally coined to describe the propaganda pieces put on social media by Russia as part of the #TrumpRussia influence operation, is now one of Trump‚Äôs favorite ways to describe unflattering facts about himself.
Trump claimed for months that he knew nothing about the payment of hush money to women he had affairs with. Turns out, Michael Cohen recorded them conspiring about the payment scheme.		Trump also claims to know nothing about Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election. Enough said
@EriqKunz1 Thank you!
@lisa1truth But he said he is the ‚Äúsuper elite!‚Äù Wow this is confusing
@lisa1truth Lol
@Cittizen1 Valid points in there: fast &amp; furious and VA. Both failures, both pale in comparison to letting #TrumpRussia happen to us
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump 1. Tell that to Trump. Maybe it will help him get with the program and start reacting to Russia‚Äôs attacks	2. That said, an election swayed by a state-sponsored hacking operation and Kremlin-sponsored propaganda (#fakenews) is questionable at best and illegitimate at worst
@giufuliafa @Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump If vote tallies differed dramatically from exit polls I‚Äôm sure we would have heard alarms going off immediately.
@lisa1truth Haha, uh... wow.
Donald Trump will never accept the reality that Russia attacked our elections. He can‚Äôt because he is afraid. The president is terrified that Russia‚Äôs actions made his election illegitimate, and so refuses to accept the facts. 		His weakness puts our country in danger.
@Sabron44977345 For one, I‚Äôd love all these Russian propaganda bots cleaned off Twitter, @Name########
@PaulRevisited It‚Äôs not real dude. Keep looking
@Cittizen1 That is a great question and, in my opinion, probably the greatest failure of his presidency
@WiseWitted They‚Äôre already happening again, just so you know.
@Cittizen1 Tallies were not hacked, thankfully, but voter rolls and elections infrastructure were hacked and probed for vulnerabilities to exploit in future elections. We can‚Äôt allow that to happen
The European Union just signed the largest trade deal ever‚Äîwith Japan.		Make no mistake: with Trump in the Oval Office, the rest of the world is leaving the United States in the dust. Why won‚Äôt Republicans in Congress act? #VoteBlue2018
@Cittizen1 You are aware that their operation to corrupt the election was MUCH more extensive than just hacking the party servers, right? Those hacks, leaking stolen documents, hacking voter systems, tons of online advertising, bots, fake news, fake social media groups and personas...
@Cittizen1 HHahahaha dude nobody refuses to acknowledge that! It‚Äôs a basic fact. You say the most incredible stuff!
#Treason is defined in the Constitution as giving aid or comfort to the enemy. It‚Äôs hard to see how Trump‚Äôs turning a blind eye to and even covering for Russia‚Äôs attacks on our country don‚Äôt meet that definition.
@PaulRevisited Lol show me where ICE said that
@Cittizen1 Define damaging. One breached US national security and undermined the foundation of our country (democracy), and the other revealed that a political party was trying to tilt its primary towards a particular candidate. I think it‚Äôs clear where the more serious problem lies.
@Cittizen1 Obama: ‚ÄúTo be concerned about [police brutality] is not to be against law enforcement. When people say black lives matter, it doesn‚Äôt mean blue lives don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù		Hard to see how you could reasonably construe that as being anti-police, frankly.
@Cittizen1 Calling Putin out would have showed him (along with us and the rest of the world) that Trump is actually capable of standing up to Putin to defend us and our democracy. That would have been big.
Trump‚Äôs comments while standing beside Putin suggest he is wholly unopposed to Russia‚Äôs attacks on our democracy, so long as he continues to benefit from those attacks. #TreasonSummit
@PaulRevisited ...you know noncitizens can‚Äôt vote, right?
@Cittizen1 Trump has been denying that Russia attack our elections for almost two years now. Why in the world would you believe that suddenly, on this most recent instance, he misspoke?
@Cittizen1 NOBODY IS AGAINST THE POLICE DUDE
Despite what the president may believe, there is no doubt among US law enforcement or intelligence officials that Russia attacked our democracy in 2016. Trump‚Äôs refusal to hold Russia to account is a betrayal of our country. #TrumpRussia
@willownorkiki Lol it wasn‚Äôt reported, Trump made it up
After two years of fighting tooth and nail to undermine American intelligence and law enforcement agencies and their investigation into the #TrumpRussia election attacks, Trump‚Äôs sudden claim that he accepts their conclusions rings totally hollow.		Sorry, we‚Äôre not that gullible.
@TomBlohm1 What does any of this have to do with the tweet you‚Äôre replying to?
@TomBlohm1 Lol we can play this game all day, and you‚Äôre correct in hinting that it‚Äôs meaningless‚Äîwhich begs the question: why did you ask about California?
The fact that Republicans in Congress aren‚Äôt unanimous and resounding in condemning Trump as he does Putin‚Äôs bidding isn‚Äôt just disgraceful‚Äîit‚Äôs treacherous. #TrumpPutinSummit
@TomBlohm1 How much MORE does she win by without Texas?
@outnleftfield88 Source?
@BayhiBab012 Definitely an outdated system
A reminder for those that need it: even with a massive Russian influence operation being waged against her, millions more Americans STILL voted for Hillary Clinton than voted for Donald Trump. #FactsMatter
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@585Conservative It should be different in different places. $30 in SF will put you up in a garage. $30 in rural Mississippi is a killing. Fed min needs to be the lowest reasonable min, and states/cities should raise it from there as appropriate. It‚Äôs one reason I voted for Hillary over Bernie
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs interesting to me is to see how the need to defend Trump from charges that he was illegitimately elected overrides perhaps the most valid opportunity ever to attack Obama. National defense should come before party politics!
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump Believe me, I am painfully aware of that
@585Conservative When have we discussed minimum wage?
Tough news: the United States is currently engaged in a conflict‚Äînot by our choosing‚Äîwith Russia. While Russia continues to attack and undermine us, Donald Trump is too weak and compromised to respond. The fact is we cannot win with Trump as president.
When asked at a press conference‚Äîwith Vladimir Putin‚Äîabout Russia‚Äôs attacks on our 2016 election, Donald Trump literally brought up Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails.		Some day, I hope we are able to laugh about this, but for now, there‚Äôs only one thing to do: #VoteBlue2018
A truly disturbing spectacle: Donald Trump standing proudly beside Vladimir Putin as he covers up for Russia‚Äôs attacks on our 2016 election‚Äîan influence operation that may well have elected Trump. #TrumpRussia
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump We know for certain Russia attacked our election, and while it‚Äôs a painful possibility that the Trump presidency was a result of that attack, we don‚Äôt know for certain. We can‚Äôt ‚Äúknow‚Äù that Trump is illegitimate, but we do know he‚Äôs not defending us from Russia, and that‚Äôs not ok
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump I can‚Äôt tell you how or even if the Russian operation changed the outcome of the election, and I still think it‚Äôs an unacceptable attack on our democracy. This isn‚Äôt about Trump. This is about our sovereignty and defending our freedom.
A Russian agent who sought to broker two Trump-Putin meetings during the campaign has been charged with espionage. Anyone who still denies a Russian interference operation in our election is not looking at the facts. #TrumpRussia
@Cittizen1 If you consider an attack on your country ‚Äúnothing to see,‚Äù then I have nothing more to say to you.
@Cittizen1 Question: if the answer was yes, would that make you okay with having our elections attacked?
For Trump to honor the president of Russia with a summit just days after the release of new evidence showing how Russia attacked our most basic freedom in the 2016 elections is an insult to the American people. #TrumpRussia
@BayhiBab012 Where in CA are you? What are the biggest problems you see/experience?
@BayhiBab012 @585Conservative @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Look, guys. I get that you may hate Obama, but look at the man. Look at his words and actions. The idea that he wasn‚Äôt trying to help the US succeed‚Äîregardless of whether you agree with how he went about it or not‚Äîjust isn‚Äôt reasonable.
@BayhiBab012 It‚Äôs a little early in my term to be passing judgement, I think. (I was just sworn in July 3rd)
@BayhiBab012 ‚Äúthe idea that any president (before Trump) did not make US interests their number one priority is straight up idiotic.‚Äù
@JamalWilliamz Lol what
To anyone who actually bought into the whole #AmericaFirst campaign: the idea that any president (before Trump) did not make US interests their number one priority is straight up idiotic.
Kudos to Theresa May for keeping a straight face when Donald Trump tells her that because his mom was born in the UK, being there ‚Äúmeans something maybe just a little bit extra‚Äîmaybe even a lot extra.‚Äù Well done. #DotardDiplomacy
@terihayden57 You sure can!
Only Trump can give an interview and then, twelve hours later, call that interview #FakeNews.		Somebody get this man some help.
I *cannot wait* for the day Trump calls Fox #FakeNews.		We all know it‚Äôs coming.
@jodierappkeeton I‚Äôm just looking at Trump‚Äôs actions. That‚Äôs it.
@jodierappkeeton None of that is what we are talking about. You called a tweet and news coverage dishonest because they were unflattering to Trump. Now that we‚Äôve proven they‚Äôre true, you keep trying to change the subject.
In a reminder of what we‚Äôre up against, the US indicted 13 Russian intel officers in the #TrumpRussia investigation.		In a reminder of how compromised Trump is, the best he can do is say he‚Äôll ‚Äúfirmly ask‚Äù Putin about election hacking‚Äîdespite all the evidence and indictments.
@Skeeterhawk2018 Yesterday, Trump gave an interview criticizing how May is handling Brexit. We heard the interview.		Today, we watched him call news reports of that interview fake news and deny criticizing May.		It‚Äôs pretty clear cut. The guy‚Äôs a filthy liar.
@jodierappkeeton Yesterday, Trump gave an interview criticizing how May is handling Brexit. We heard the interview.		Today, we watched him call news reports of that interview fake news and deny criticizing May.		I tweeted a summary of those comments. You called my tweet lies.		What am I missing?
@jodierappkeeton My friend, just because Trump says something is fake news doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fake news. Here‚Äôs the recording of him being highly critical of PM May to The Sun, in an interview he today denied and called fake news: https://t.co/HUUSuJiSxG
@jodierappkeeton If you feel I‚Äôm deflecting by responding to your contention that the chyrons on the video were biased, why don‚Äôt we leave that whole discussion aside until we resolve the issue about the actual news conference.
@jodierappkeeton Lol, back up a sec. My post was a summary of what he said at the news conference. You called it lies and fake news, so we looked up the video, and watched him say it. Now you‚Äôre back to calling it gibberish?
@jodierappkeeton The only thing I remember seeing posted on the bottom of the screen is ‚ÄúTrump: whatever UK does on Brexit ok with US.‚Äù How is that negative?
@jodierappkeeton Okay, but presumably you're not going to continue calling quotes from the news conference fake news while refusing to actually watch the news conference, right?
@LvCa2 Elections have consequences, and now this deranged egomaniac represents us and our country to the world. #VoteBlue
@Skeeterhawk2018 Hahaha what? You can watch him say it yourself!! https://t.co/FHoniVt00V
@jodierappkeeton Yep, not a problem here. Just watched the video, and everything I read in the news was indeed true. You can watch the event here if you're interested: https://t.co/9PiuSQlZn5‚Äîwhich may have been a good thing to do before calling my tweet "lies" and the news "fake."
@jodierappkeeton How do I know he said that? Just the regular news. But since you brought up the idea that it could be ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù I‚Äôm going to watch video footage of the event now and make sure it wasn‚Äôt a lie.
@jodierappkeeton At the Prime Minister‚Äôs house in Buckinghamshire? No, I wasn‚Äôt. Why?
@jodierappkeeton LOL what in there was a lie?
"[Trump] first tried to deny he had criticized [Theresa May] and blamed the embarrassing episode on the news media. When that rang hollow, he then tried to compensate by lavishing Mrs. May with compliments..."		What a pathetic and embarrassing representative of the United States.
@realDonaldTrump Hahahahahaha		Is this website referring to "the biased mainstream media" as it pretends not to be biased?? This is too good! üòÇ
@BernieFechter @realDonaldTrump Lol tell me that‚Äôs not what you really think
After months of Trump asserting that he was brining US Korean War remains home, North Korea stood the Americans up for a meeting on how to do just that, leaving only one question: just how stupid is @realDonaldTrump?!?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews What do you mean by ‚Äúthe other side?‚Äù America? Justice? Get a grip and resign already.
Donald Trump‚Äôs incessant attacks on our allies and unwillingness to defend us against the aggressions of our adversaries poses the most serious threat to US security in at least two decades.
@Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump Lol come on man, that‚Äôs such a ridiculous argument. I literally just told you I support babies getting full nutrition and reasonable limits on abortion, and you‚Äôre suggesting I‚Äôm a hypocrite for being against policies that hurt babies?
Hey @CaseyCagle, I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell you this, but buying a car from a car company and buying a condo from a lobbyist 24% below market value are two VERY different things, you corrupt politician. #DrainTheSwamp
@Cittizen1 It should definitely be legal at and past 2 weeks. In general, it should not be legal once the fetus is conscious, except in extenuating medical circumstances.
Trump‚Äôs Republicans want to include a citizenship question on the census in the hopes of deliberately undercounting the population‚Äîyet another example of these corrupt politicians setting out to subvert the Constitutional order. Our founding fathers would be mortified.
@LogicalZephyr ...If you own a $20,000,000 piece of property, you can afford to pay the estate tax.
@Cittizen1 Lol calm down. This does https://t.co/T9seiNbTsk
@Cittizen1 You‚Äôre suggesting that aborting a ball of cells with zero consciousness is more anti-baby than depriving an actual living baby of proper nutrition?
@Artfull01 Also per Constitution: nominee must be considered by the Senate. Garland wasn‚Äôt considered, was he? (That wasn‚Äôt a question, BTW.)
The Trump Administration threatened to veto a World Health Organization resolution endorsing breastfeeding, placing the financial interests of the baby formula industry above infants‚Äô health. If that isn‚Äôt anti-baby, I don‚Äôt know what is.
A British citizen has now died as a result of Russia‚Äôs attempt to assassinate an ex-spy on British soil. The death of this innocent civilian at the hands of the Kremlin demands a strong international response; it‚Äôs time for Trump to stand up to Putin.

@JC7U Haha compliments to my dentist
It‚Äôs one thing for Russia to use a banned chemical weapon in an assassination attempt on British soil. It‚Äôs another thing entirely for them to do such a sloppy job of it that at least four innocent bystanders have now been poisoned as well. Britons deserve better than this.
@FetchAlmighty @scootser In all reality, true justice in the legal sense will have to wait until after the end of the Trump Administration.
We know he will only be replaced by another corrupt industry lobbyist, but Scott Pruitt‚Äôs resignation is still a token of justice for the American people and their land. Our fight for the health and safety we deserve continues.

@Whamfries Constitution requires Senate to give advice and consent on SCOTUS nominees. They refused. Simple.
@585Conservative @GregPoliteia ? 2013 was Obama‚Äôs second term. You‚Äôre saying Democrats weren‚Äôt considering his nominees for something?
Gorsuch‚Äôs Supreme Court seat belongs to Merrick Garland, nominated by President Obama (per Constitution). McConnell refused to give advice or consent (unconstitutional), but now wants to play by the rules when a Republican is in power? The level of corruption is insane. #VoteBlue

Corruption is the game in Trump‚Äôs Washington, but the voters of #Georgia should not allow @CaseyCagle to commit such crimes in their state. Cagle bought a condo from lobbyist 24% below market value and sold it for a huge profit. He should be prosecuted, not elected governor. #DTS
@Leecard0 @realDonaldTrump Amen!

All you need to know about @tedcruz: called Trump an ‚Äúutterly amoral‚Äù ‚Äúpathological liar‚Äù who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know the difference between truth and lies,‚Äù but now supports Trump 100% because he thinks it will get him re-elected. #DrainTheSwamp #VoteBlue2018

@barbtries (Did know about Border Patrol haha). But I feel like if ICE went away this instant, Trump would simply direct another agency to perform all the objectionable things ICE currently does. Any agency can be fixed; Trump's bigotry is the root problem that can't.
@barbtries Interesting, I did not know that
@barbtries So what do you propose to replace it? Can we agree that the country still needs immigration and customs enforcement?
Can we knock it off with this #AbolishICE crap? The problem isn‚Äôt the agency; it‚Äôs the guy directing it. #AbolishTrump
After firing Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia (which he originally claimed to know nothing about), Trump is now trying to convince us that Flynn never lied to anyone...? #TrumpRussia #AnotherTrumpLie
Mid Continent Nail Corp, the largest US manufacturer of nails, employs 500 people. Trump‚Äôs tariffs have already forced it to lay off 60 hardworking Americans, and it may have to cut another 200 jobs in the next weeks. This isn‚Äôt #AmericaFirst, this is #TrumpTradeWar.
The global effort to repair the ozone layer, protecting us from sunburns and cancer, has been dealt a major setback by #China‚Äôs continued, illegal production of the harmful chemical CFC-11. This is unacceptable, and an international response is absolutely warranted.
Trump's meeting with Putin right before the midterm elections is such a bad move that one almost has to ask: did Trump really have a choice? #TrumpRussia
Well, he‚Äôs done it: after touting them as an ‚ÄúAmerican icon,‚Äù Trump has forced @harleydavidson to move US production overseas to avoid his imbecilic #Tariffs. This is what the #TrumpTradeWar means: Americans losing their jobs.

@johnsonjack580 Fair point. The ban is discriminatory, not racist. Better?
Trump‚Äôs racist #MuslimBan isn‚Äôt even the most disturbing news from #SCOTUS today; Kennedy‚Äôs retirement has potentially ruinous consequences for our country in the areas of civil rights (abortion, gay marriage), public safety (gun control), and corruption (campaign finance)
@hemmcue @patrice_noonan Honestly, I am‚Äîalthough my rational side knows that's foolish. McConnell has shown us too many times that nothing is below him.
McConnell says the Senate is "ready to fulfill its constitutional role by offering advice and consent on President Trump‚Äôs nominee to fill this vacancy.‚Äù		What a stunning turn of events from barely two years ago, when the Senate decided the Constitution and POTUS could go to hell
The decisive failure of @HouseGOP's extremely partisan immigration bills are clear evidence that if they want to get anything done, the #Republicans that control #Congress must be willing to work with #Democrats on bipartisan legislation. Ignoring half the country does not work!
@realDonaldTrump lol nope
#China is now censoring mention of its #MadeInChina2025 policy, in the hopes that #Trump will forget about it and surrender to them on #trade and intellectual property theft. The scary part is that it may well work.
By saluting a North Korean military officer, Trump has telegraphed to the world that he is lower than someone who engineers the massacre of innocent civilians. Unbelievable.
@Cittizen1 @teezgramma @ImmoralReport @realDonaldTrump @obama @BillClinton @POTUS That is such a bizarre thing to say lol
@Abuelo1932 @Cittizen1 @realDonaldTrump @obama @BillClinton @POTUS You are aware that the parties have switched platforms multiple times throughout history, and that in the era you‚Äôre referencing, the Democratic Party was the conservative party and the Republican Party was the liberal party, right?

The people of #SouthCarolina know that @henrymcmaster is corrupt creature of Trump‚Äôs swamp‚Äîwhy else would Donald Trump be trying so desperately to get him reelected? South Carolina should place itself above the #corruption of the Trump era.

So @henrymcmaster brings in @realDonaldTrump to rail against BMW... one of #SouthCarolina‚Äôs biggest employers. It‚Äôs like these guys are so busy being corrupt they have no clue what‚Äôs going on in the state. #CorruptGOP
@BeantownBop I'm gonna guess they're about ready to look for a new main ally‚Äîas would, frankly, any US ally with half a brain. Trump is going to dismantle everything we've built, leaving us isolated and the world less safe.
@Cynrancour Trump is only working for one American, and that's @realDonaldTrump.
@GayEthics Joint military exercises are a routine part of foreign relations, not an excuse for war‚Äîor a bargaining chip.
It‚Äôs outrageous that Trump would betray the United States by protecting Chinese companies like #ZTE even as China brazenly steals critical intellectual property from American companies like Idaho‚Äôs @MicronTech. Trump‚Äôs loyalty to Russia and China is an economic &amp; security threat.
@LunaGir50479505 I guess not surprising then that Trump wants to pardon the convicted insider trader Martha Stewart?
The agreement Trump signed with North Korea promises major US concessions in return for vague and unenforceable pledges from Pyongyang, but Trump described it as a deal that gives us ‚Äúeverything.‚Äù He either has no idea how to negotiate, or he‚Äôs lying through his teeth‚Äîor both?
@SelfishI But the poor workers who get laid off sure as hell won't.

@Motherpriestess It‚Äôs funny that you‚Äôd want to be attacking people on Twitter, but aren‚Äôt willing to do so under your own name. Also interesting that you‚Äôd spread misinformation on Twitter, but not under your own name either. Doesn‚Äôt make you seem very credible... or confident.
@Motherpriestess What's your name?
@JohnCornyn You're close. Ds are the party of legal immigration, and Rs are the party of no immigration. #VoteBlue2018
Let‚Äôs be clear: there is no immigration crisis.There is illegal immigration, and we need to gain control of our borders so we can know who is in our country and where they came from. That‚Äôs common sense. But immigrants in general pose no threat in any reasonable sense of the word

Hey @realDonaldTrump, instead of shipping them off to military bases, what if you took these innocent immigrant children and gave them back to their parents?
‚ÄúEverything we do is very scientific, very data-based, very numbers-based.‚Äù		Real quote from @AkashJC, a director at @AFPhq, the Koch-funded special interest group that pushes far-right positions and denies the very science behind basic facts like #ClimateChange
It‚Äôs outrageous that it took weeks of public outcry for @realDonaldTrump to sign an executive order ending his sadistic policy of #FamilySeparation, after lying multiple times to the American public that he was powerless to act. Shameful doesn‚Äôt begin to describe it.
And so, after days of insisting to the American public that his cruel policy of #FamilySeparation was mandated by law and that only Congress could fix it, Trump caved and signed an executive order ending the policy. He was lying this whole time; it was just him being sadistic.
Trump has decided to have the US join Iran, North Korea, and Eritrea as the only countries not on the UN Human Rights Council, months after beginning his #FamilySeparation policy‚Äîa crime against humanity. Here‚Äôs to justice for both Trump and his victims. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Trump admitted to lying about dictating the statement regarding his campaign‚Äôs Trump Tower meeting with a Russian agent even while calling the @nytimes ‚Äúphony‚Äù for reporting on the false story he gave them. How dumb does he think we are??
@Cittizen1 Lol those are two very extreme scenarios. One of the many alternatives would be to simply stop detaining the kids separately from the parents.
@Cittizen1 I assume that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre fine with continuing to traumatize children until ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù is built
@kdreed3164 @DrPolitics1 How about we stop griping about where each other are from haha. The fact of the matter is that traumatizing children by separating them from their parents is inexcusable and immoral.
@khemory Kylie, this was not happening under the Obama Administration, and the Democrats have not been in a position to pass new laws since Trump was elected.
@DrPolitics1 You‚Äôre damn right I would say that. Any government that traumatizes children for no reason is totally illegitimate.
It is clear to me that the Trump Administration‚Äôs practice of separating immigrant children from their families at the border, which is greatly traumatizing to these innocent children, constitutes a crime against humanity.
Trump claims his policy of #FamilySeparation is the result of Democratic laws. In reality, this practice wasn‚Äôt happening under the Obama Administration, and began during the Trump Administration, when Democrats have zero power in Washington. #AnotherTrumpLie
For the Secretary of Homeland Security to lie to the American public with the intention of misleading us about a Trump policy that amounts to child abuse is inexcusable. She has lost our trust and surrendered her credibility in defending #FamilySeparation. https://t.co/wYusqq8oed
The Trump Administration may not have a policy of separating families at the border, but it has a policy of prosecuting migrant parents, which necessarily involves taking them away from their children, and @SecNielsen knows this. https://t.co/wYusqq8oed
When Trump says something like this, there‚Äôs reasonable doubt that he might simply have no idea what he‚Äôs tweeting about. Not @SecNielsen; she knows better. This tweet is not just wrong; it is baldly dishonest. https://t.co/wYusqq8oed

I‚Äôm not ashamed that the President of the United States met with the dictator of North Korea for the first time. In fact, I‚Äôm glad it was Trump; he deserves this disgraceful place in history, because he‚Äôs the first president to be as low as a dictator of North Korea.
Scott Pruitt is one of the most corrupt public officials the United States has ever seen, and yet Trump still continues to defend him because he‚Äôs passionate about slashing environmental protections. This is administration is sick. #VoteBlue2018

#China continues its military buildup in the #SouthChinaSea, threatening global security in violation of both their own promises and international law. Is America under @realDonaldTrump too weak to respond?
The reason Trump failed miserably at negotiating #trade at #G7 is because he doesn‚Äôt know anything about trade or US economic relations. All he knows is what his advisers tell him, and they purposely give him only biased, negative, and partial information. We can‚Äôt win.
The deck has never been more stacked against the United States than it is now, with an ignorant and incompetent president surrounded by manipulative advisers looking to get rich.
Donald Trump‚Äôs belief that being president means he‚Äôs above the law is, in many ways, a symbolic undoing of the American Revolution, in which the American people overthrew a monarch with infinite power and zero accountability.		Donald Trump is the antithesis of America.
Can somebody explain to me why Donald Trump is attacking US allies while bending over for adversaries like Russia, China, and North Korea? This is the total opposite of #AmericaFirst...

The Republican Party is embracing the idea that this is a white country for white people in a way we haven‚Äôt seen in decades. It‚Äôs no wonder they don‚Äôt want to let minorities vote!
Trump‚Äôs lawyers‚Äô letter to #Mueller makes it appallingly clear that their legal strategy now boils down to the idea that Donald Trump is above the law. That is never what this country has been about. #TrumpRussia
Why is Donald Trump spending his time and effort pardoning corrupt partisans and tweeting conspiracy theories instead of working to solve any of the huge challenges facing our country?
Plug Power, a manufacturer in New York, slowed hiring and canceled plans to expand because of Trump‚Äôs #TradeWar. These are the real-world consequences of making economic policy that‚Äôs based on ideology instead of on economics.
There is literally no point in listening to anything Trump says. TPP was off then on then off. The border wall was obnoxiously on but really off the whole time. Tariffs were on then off then on. The North Korea summit was off then on then off and now on again.
When Obama was president and the economy was roaring, Trump routinely called the jobs reports fake. Now that he's president, he's changed his tune.		Yet further proof that Trump's willing to lie about anything to serve his political purposes. #CorruptGOP #ImpeachTrump

Donald Trump‚Äôs catastrophic #TradeWar on our allies will harm the US in every way‚Äîeconomically, diplomatically, and strategically‚Äîwhile ceding the upper hand to #China and #Russia. There‚Äôs a clear pattern emerging in his policy...
Donald Trump lives in a permanent state of confusion about what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt, and he‚Äôs supposed to be running our country. This is not safe.
@Carpophores This is an investigation, not an attempt to convict anyone of anything. All we want to do is find out what, if anything, happened. If Trump is totally innocent, I wanna know that too!
#Spygate? More like #Liegate.		If Trump thinks he‚Äôs so guilty of collusion and obstruction that his only chance at escaping accountability is to make a ton of stuff up, he should just resign.

Trump knew his decision to blow up the #IranDeal would cause oil prices to spike, hurting Americans at the pump but bringing desperately needed relief to Russia‚Äôs oil export-dependent economy. His allegiances couldn‚Äôt be more clear. #TraitorTrump #TrumpRussia

It‚Äôs interesting to reflect on Trump‚Äôs claims that the election was rigged against him, knowing now that the election was being rigged in his favor the whole time by the Russian government and a network of shady Republican operatives. Justice is coming. #VoteBlue2018
New details suggest that in addition to Russia, #TrumpColluded with Middle Eastern states looking to sway the election in his favor. Congress must protect #Mueller so he can get to the bottom of this and lay the facts out for the American people. #TrumpRussia

After hearing a Trump staffer say US war hero John McCain doesn‚Äôt matter because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs dying anyway,‚Äù I am now concerned that we are reaching the point where the #GOP‚Äôs unvarnished contempt for our soldiers and veterans could hamper our military‚Äôs ability to fight and recruit.
A Trump Administration official said that John McCain‚Äîan American hero who was taken prisoner and tortured while fighting for his country‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt matter because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs dying anyway.‚Äù And so, I say again: there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with today‚Äôs #GOP.

The release of Natalia Veselnitskaya‚Äôs personal emails proves once and for all what we all knew, and what the leaders of Trump‚Äôs campaign knew when they invited her to Trump Tower: she is an agent of the Russian government. #TrumpRussia #Collusion
The fact that Trump would even nominate Ronny Jackson to lead the VA in the first place is an insult to our veterans, shows the true contempt in which he holds our society.

Like most of Trump‚Äôs ideas, suspending recovery aid to #Syria is a terrible one. Continuing conflict and poverty breed desperation, and desperation makes people vulnerable to radicalization. Suspending relief aid may well undermine US national security.

Under federal law, you have to be 21 to purchase alcohol, but only 18 to purchase an assault rifle. Both are perfectly safe when used responsibly, but I would argue that an assault rifle is much more dangerous when misused than alcohol. #GunReformNow
Consider the gross irony of Jeff Sessions firing McCabe in a political hit job intended to please Trump, and accusing McCabe of a ‚Äúlack of candor‚Äù‚Äîjust months after Sessions perjured himself before Congress. Conclusion: this administration has to go. #TrumpRussia #VoteThemOut
Trump‚Äôs head #TrumpRussia lawyer was willing to unethically allege that the #Mueller investigation is illegitimate, only to resign a few days later? One has to wonder what Trump could have tried to make him do Thursday that would have been even more humiliating...

@cpaletz @pameladubsky49 @FoxNews @MSNBC @CNN @realDonaldTrump Totally agree
Kudos to @Citi for taking the initiative on #GunSafey where our Republican-controlled government has failed. It‚Äôs a sad day when corporations have to take responsibility for public safety, but we‚Äôre grateful someone is doing it. #GunReformNow
@pameladubsky49 A fabulous question
@BlondeinBklyn @FoxNews True, and that even he is having this realization is damning of the company as a whole.
Yet another @FoxNews employee has quit for ethical reasons: retired Army officer Ralph Peters says he can no longer work for a propaganda machine that knowingly undermines our #democracy for profit. THAT, my friends, is how you put #AmericaFirst.

@tulaholmes @facebook Already did. I‚Äôm not putting any of my money in a company that puts profits over country.
@Lena_PSlope Or at least minus the fake news and election manipulation...
@MommyDearest64 Never to late to send a message to a company that puts profits above country.
@JamaKBrown Not at all! I can‚Äôt respect Twitter as a company, which begs the question: why do I keep using their product? That contradiction is getting harder to live with every day, and unless something changes, I may not be on here for much longer.
@realDonaldTrump #AnotherTrumpLie
@jeancosme No problem. I‚Äôd be happy to!
@Alloverthemap10 If you look at the roles Instagram and Twitter also played in allowing Russia to interfere in our democracy, and then look at the unacceptably weak response by those companies... deleting their apps too might be exactly what they deserve.
I‚Äôm having serious second thoughts about continuing to use #Facebook, as troubling signs about their commitment to the principles of transparency, security, democracy continue to mount. If we don‚Äôt see some quick and dramatic changes, it may be time to #DeleteFacebook.

Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin‚Äîthe dictator of Russia who is currently overseeing a multi-pronged assault on the US and our allies‚Äîto congratulate him on winning a fake election. Trump‚Äôs allegiances couldn‚Äôt be more clear. #TrumpRussia

I‚Äôm curious if Donald Trump was actually crying when he wrote this. Because it sure seems like he was crying when he wrote this. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/6tH3H0mF1a
Donald Trump either lied through his teeth when he explicitly said he wanted comprehensive #GunSafety laws, or he‚Äôs so afraid of the #NRA that it only took an hour with their lobbyists for him to do a complete 180. Either one is terrible news for our country.

Watching House #Republicans argue there‚Äôs a difference between Russia ‚Äúhelping Hillary‚Äù and ‚Äúhurting Trump‚Äù‚Äîin an election between Hillary and Trump‚Äîis a stark reminder of how the #GOP has totally surrendered its dignity. #TrumpRussia
@WilliHyde The best way you can help the country is getting as many people as you can to vote!

@cpaletz @realDonaldTrump @GOP Very interesting indeed!
Republicans spent more than $10,000,000 trying to keep #PA18 red‚ÄîTrump carried it by 20% in 2016‚Äîand #ConorLamb still won. Maybe now they‚Äôll finally be ready to talk about getting dirty money out of politics? #CampaignFinanceReform

While Donald Trump was busy schmoozing big Republican donors in California (whom he claimed he didn‚Äôt need?) voters in #PA18 showed that they still intend to #DrainTheSwamp, even as Trump actively builds it. Beautiful.
@585Conservative @POTUS Or, if he wanted to show he‚Äôs not whipped by Putin without starting WWIII, he could just say ‚ÄúRussia poisoning someone in England with nerve agent is unacceptable.‚Äù I would opt for that one, personally.
When Assad used chemical weapons in Syria, Trump ordered a 59-missile air strike. When Putin uses chemical weapons in England, it‚Äôs crickets from the White House. The president is looking increasingly compromised‚Äîin more ways than one. #SalisburyAttack #TrumpRussia
Failure by the United States to show its total support for our allies in London after the Russian nerve agent attack would be deeply embarrassing to our nation, and raise further suspicions about a compromised White House. #TrumpRussia
@Chrysler300Jack Correct lol
@Chrysler300Jack But ‚ÄúDemocrat‚Äù policy is also an invention of the Republican Party. Democratic policy, on the other hand, has one main goal: trying to build a country where nobody has to get screwed over. üëèüèºüá∫üá∏üëèüèºüá∫üá∏
Deeply saddened to learn of Steven Hawking‚Äôs passing. Let him go down in history as a heroic contributor to humankind, who with his eyes and one finger revolutionized our understanding of the universe we inhabit. What an unparalleled inspiration.
Can‚Äôt help but notice that Rex #Tillerson was fired immediately after finally saying, ‚ÄùI‚Äôve become extremely concerned about Russia.‚Äù	#TrumpRussia
@KEverhard I don‚Äôt mind at all, but I guess it all depends on the context. Are you asking about reasonable news? Reasonable relations with Russia? Something else?
If you‚Äôre a voter in #PA18, this is your chance to turn things around by voting #ConorLambForCongress. You deserve a representative who exemplifies your strengths and understands your challenges!
@KEverhard I mean... it‚Äôs not a guess if it‚Äôs based on the actual discussions being had in the White House
@KEverhard The order may not have been given in November, but given that they were already planning on doing it then, and it just happened, it sure seems like the decision had been made. How do you define fake news?
When the New York Times reported in November that Trump would replace Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, Trump called it ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù 		Today, Trump replaced Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo. #AnotherTrumpLie
If Trump cares at all about the security of our country, he will order international arrest warrants for the Russian nationals indicted in the #TrumpRussia attacks. If he won‚Äôt defend our most basic freedom‚Äîself-determination‚Äîis he not complicit in the attacks on that freedom?
Conor Lamb is going to be the kind of leader Pennsylvania‚Äôs 18th has been missing for a long time: a defender of regular people and an exemplar of common decency. #ConorLambForCongress
Lying is now the central tool in GOP politics: Conor Lamb has come out and said he doesn‚Äôt support Nancy Pelosi, and yet outside Republican groups are flooding Pennsylvania‚Äôs 18th with attack ads falsely claiming he does. #ConorLambForCongress #VoteGOPOut

Pause for a moment and consider the sheer irony of the fact that people wouldn‚Äôt vote for Hillary because they thought she was ‚Äúa criminal,‚Äù so they voted for Donald Trump instead. #TrumpRussia
The US #economy added 313,000 jobs last month. That‚Äôs more than we‚Äôve seen since... the end of the Obama administration! #ThanksObama
@macauley_monica Now you‚Äôre talking!
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is right: a foreign purchase of a strategic national asset like #Qualcomm would indeed be a national security issue. We need to protect critical American companies and industries against questionable foreign actors.
Russia‚Äòs shrill demands for respect from the world will continue to fall flat until it stops committing international crimes like interfering in our democracy, occupying Ukraine, bombing civilians in Syria, and murdering its exiled citizens. #TrumpRussia
@Chrysler300Jack Guess what, pal. You can call me a liar because you don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm telling you, but the law says what it says. If you wanna complain about a particular CA law, go read that law first so you understand what you‚Äôre talking about.
That the Trump Administration still hasn‚Äôt approved imminent danger pay for our troops in Niger is reprehensible and completely unacceptable. We need leaders that don‚Äôt take the sacrifices of our #military for granted.
@Chrysler300Jack Politicians in California (or anywhere in the country, to my knowledge) do not protect immigrants who pose a danger to society. You don‚Äôt seem very familiar with the policies you‚Äôre so upset about.
@Chrysler300Jack Except criminals aren‚Äôt defended or kept here...?
@Chrysler300Jack Nobody‚Äôs placing anyone over anyone else over here. You need to understand that just because you don‚Äôt treat immigrants like shit doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre somehow disadvantaging everyone else.
Similar thought: imagine the world we would live in if @realDonaldTrump spent 1/10 as much effort preventing Russia from manipulating our country as he spends trying to keep a porn star from telling the truth.
If @jeffsessions spent half as much time and money fighting Russia‚Äôs attacks on our democracy as he spent fighting California‚Äôs immigration laws, we‚Äôd all be a lot safer. I guess that‚Äôs not a priority for Trump‚Äôs Republicans. #VoteThemOut
@Marcyhomesley In his defense, he‚Äôs a brave man for traveling to a city and state where he‚Äôs so completely unwelcome!
As you read this, Jeff Sessions is #Sacramento, announcing a lawsuit against our great state of #California. Such attacks from the Trump Administration are unsurprising; this White House sees California‚Äôs defense of its values as a threat. #VoteThemOut

Congratulations to the brave #WestVirginiaTeachers, whose insistence on standing up for their rights paid off and showed the party in control of their state legislature that they can‚Äôt continue to run roughshod over the people our society relies on most. You earned this!
When taken in whole, it seems increasingly plausible that Trump‚Äôs sustained assault on the justice system, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement officials make this the most damaging presidency in the history of the United States. Our country needs your help!#VoteBlue2018
@585Conservative @POTUS Fair point, although you‚Äôre including in that number all the people who made a protest vote assuming their vote wouldn‚Äôt make a difference because they thought Hillary was the guaranteed winner
@NVJim Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for making sure we don‚Äôt have the tools we need to protect our interests!
@WineGuyVenice LOL
@dividedbyzach Lol too real
Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand: we all knew #Trump was going to be a disaster for US interests and national security. Military &amp; intel experts regularly report to Congress that we‚Äôre falling father and farther behind... and yet #Republicans in Congress don‚Äôt do anything about it!
There‚Äôs a 99% chance that #NorthKorea‚Äôs willingness to negotiate on its nuclear weapons is a ploy for sanctions relief (they‚Äôve played this card before), but it‚Äôs our job to diligently and earnestly investigate that 1% chance that they might be ready for real progress.
@jkuehn50 Russian interference in our system of government and military expansionism, Chinese theft of intellectual property, ISIS fighters escaping the battlefield... I could go on.
@scott_regentin Thank you for your service, and for your sound judgement.
If you still need proof the Trump Administration isn‚Äôt remotely interested in defending the US against foreign threats, look no further than Rex Tillerson‚Äôs excuse for his inaction: ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs their intention to interfere, they‚Äôre going to find ways to do that.‚Äù #TrumpRussia
@TerriDF Same exact reaction.
‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs their intention to interfere, they‚Äôre going to find ways to do that.‚Äù		That‚Äôs an actual quote of Rex Tillerson suggesting it‚Äôs not worth doing anything about Russia‚Äôs relentless attacks on our democracy. So I guess we just surrender to Putin? #TrumpRussia #VoteThemOut
16% of Georgians live in poverty, but what is the Republican-controlled #Georgia state legislature focused on? Creating a tax holiday for people to buy guns, ammo, and gun paraphernalia. What the hell kind of #priorities are those?? #VoteBlue2018

It is galling to me that the Trump Administration blames the Obama Administration for Russian interference in our elections, even as Trump continues to decline defending our country from this ongoing attack. #TrumpRussia

@EvanCull @TexOkie65 Haha ok
@EvanCull @KrackaShabazz Lol I can assure you England did not invent ‚Äúthe militia‚Äù
@thurber_michael I‚Äôd love to know what percent of these people frothing at the mouth over their ‚ÄúSecond Amendment rights‚Äù have actually read the whole Constitution.
@sue2cute4u And that‚Äôs an extreme scenario, but honestly, if we start filling classrooms up with guns, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until one goes off, for any reason‚Äîangry teacher, disgruntled student, simple accident... it‚Äôs a hugely dangerous idea.
@EvanCull @KrackaShabazz Not even close. Our ‚Äúwell-regulated Militia,‚Äù which is literally what the Second Amendment says, is clearly the National Guard.
@MattWilly28 @fmgagne My guess is of those 100 million armed Americans, most are reasonable people who would applaud if we finally made it more difficult for those who can‚Äôt be trusted with guns to get their hands guns, so I‚Äôm not too worried lol
@MattWilly28 @fmgagne Define disarm
@MattWilly28 @SerenityFoods Bro. It‚Äôs entirely true. Go through and read the whole thing. It makes several references to the ‚ÄúMilitia,‚Äù and it‚Äôs not at all unclear what they‚Äôre talking about. Todays‚Äôs popular 2A interpretation is a ridiculous NRA-funded joke.
@MattWilly28 @Pink22Karen @Spikearoonie @Markwil50187274 @NRA That‚Äôs ridiculous. Most of the people I know are Democrats, and 90% of them are not ‚Äúanti-gun.‚Äù In fact, the very idea of being ‚Äúpro-gun‚Äù or ‚Äúanti-gun‚Äù is ridiculous. Guns exist‚Äîthat‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is how well these lethal objects are regulated for public safety.
@GunsProtectToo I mean, people buy heroin illegally, but it‚Äôs still illegal. Why? Because if it weren‚Äôt, you can bet a lot more people would be doing heroin.
@GunsProtectToo There‚Äôs no need for anyone to be shot by that shooter if that shooter, who is an unstable teenager, doesn‚Äôt have a gun in the first place.
@KrackaShabazz @rubyrae4resist Yeah... there‚Äôs a huge difference between the damage a sociopath can do with an AR-15 vs. a musket.
@KrackaShabazz ...You‚Äôre telling me an Amendment to the Constitution is not part of the Constitution?
Our schools in this country need a lot of things, and I‚Äôm pretty sure more guns isn‚Äôt one of them. #GunReformNow #VoteThemOut
@RetroCrone You‚Äôre absolutely right
@mahler_kurt @SpencerRMeyer Lol. Dude. I just glanced at your twitter feed. Half the stuff you share probably comes straight from the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg.
@TexOkie65 True. Any patriotic American wanting to join the militia to defend their country should do so. Call your local National Guard recruiter and get going!
@mahler_kurt @Nick_S_79 True
@mahler_kurt @SpencerRMeyer By the way, that sure was an interesting collection of kings hahaha
@mahler_kurt @SpencerRMeyer If you believe that, Putin has you right where he wants you: fearing and hating your own country.
@evilleclarks @Rosie How about cutting to the chase and reading the Second Amendment, along with the rest of the Constitution? Makes it pretty clear what was intended, and‚Äîspoiler alert‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt for Nikolas Cruz the deranged teenager to have an AR-15.
@mahler_kurt @vej328 @Rosie Lol
@KrackaShabazz ...I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything confusing about the text of the Second Amendment as found in the Constitution.
@RetroCrone Although I would question who is villifying all gun owners, besides those on the fringe...
@Neilz60938209 @rubyrae4resist Right. Everyone knows Paul Revere maintained a fleet of galleons and had a world-class collection of organ guns üôÑ
@evilleclarks @Rosie Ah, the old slippery slope argument: one of the lamest logical fallacies.
Enough GOP talking points. If you read the entire Constitution, it‚Äôs clear the Second Amendment has nothing to do with random individuals owning assault weapons; it guarantees the right to bear arms for the militia, which we have created as the National Guard. #GunReformNow
@evilleclarks @Rosie You are equating banning assault weapons with repealing the Second Amendment. That doesn‚Äôt make sense.
Problem solved? What happens when that ‚Äúsicko shooter‚Äù decides to go shoot up a daycare or a grocery store instead? The GOP needs to put kids over guns and offer some #GunReformNow instead of just regurgitating NRA talking points. If not, #VoteThemOut! https://t.co/si25XrtBEe
@585Conservative Dude, I do think it can‚Äôt happen. Neither you nor I is in danger of being found mentally ill. Let‚Äôs not resort to theatricals.
@SCShout @gregmurphy39 Spreading fake quotes, huh? Nice one, Comrade. #TrumpRussiaBot #Reported
@SCShout Uh oh, your English is starting to slip up a bit! Can you say ‚Äú#TrumpRussia troll?‚Äù
@Debhasnocontrol @SpencerRMeyer Nobody‚Äôs calling them illegal, because they‚Äôre not illegal. That‚Äôs the whole problem lol
@Debhasnocontrol That shooting didn‚Äôt involve assault weapons‚Äîand you can bet if it had, innocent people would be dead.
@585Conservative I mean, they really shouldn‚Äôt be. That‚Äôs kind of the essence of why we get so confused when we ask for sensible gun laws, only to have the NRA and gun nuts scream at us about ‚Äústripping people of their rights‚Äù
When you go to the polls this November, ask yourself: do you want to support the party that protects kids, or the party that protects guns? #GunReformNow #VoteBlue2018
@Spikearoonie @Markwil50187274 @NRA Oh look, a reasonable person! ü§ó
@GeorgeBain14 üò±you mean a reasonable person??
@vej328 @Rosie It‚Äôs been decades since the NRA was a ‚Äúgun club.‚Äù Today it‚Äôs nothing more than a powerful special interest.
@GeorgeBain14 It would say calling an extremist organization a terrorist organization looks pretty ironic.
@SCShout The very idea that people who want less crazy people to have assault rifles constitute ‚Äúlunatics‚Äù looking to rob you of your freedoms is extreme. Congratulations. You‚Äôve validated the argument.
@evilleclarks @Rosie Nobody is cool with that, I can assure you.
@SerenityFoods If you read the entire Constitution, it‚Äôs clear the #SecondAmendment is meant to secure the right to bear arms for our militia: the National Guard.
@SCShout I‚Äôll call both physical terrorism and vicious attempts to pit our country against itself ‚Äúextremism.‚Äù The qhestjkn is: why won‚Äôt you?
@SpencerRMeyer That‚Äôs because they have one of our two political parties ENTIRELY in their pockets.
@Summersgod1992 The NRA started as an organization to teach people about gun safety, if you can believe that: https://t.co/cTpPt5HIU9
@Nick_S_79 The NRA was initially founded to teach people how to use firearms safely, if you can believe that: https://t.co/cTpPt5HIU9
NRA Leader: ‚Äú[Democrats‚Äô] goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment and our firearms freedoms so they can eradicate all individual freedoms.‚Äù		It‚Äôs time to recognize the #NRA for what it‚Äôs become: an extremist organization.		#GunReformNow
@realDonaldTrump @NRA LOOOOOOOOOOOL
@jtpipkin75 @585Conservative Lol don‚Äôt waste your time. People just decide the DOJ must be corrupt because, hey, why else would you decline to investigate the latest Hillary Clinton conspiracy theory? Why else would you possibly open an investigation into Dear Leader?!
@jtpipkin75 @sookie1_ @trueblueusa1 Sookie doesn‚Äôt quite have a grasp of those English phrases. Somebody‚Äôs a #TrumpRussia bot! Block and report.
Andrew Pollack, whose daughter was murdered in #Florida by a psychopath wielding an assault rifle, has it exactly right: how many more children have to die before the @GOP finally allows gun reform? #VoteThemOut
@judyziva @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre talking about...
Hey @realDonaldTrump, still waiting on you to impose those sanctions, passed by Congress, in response to a massive attack on our democracy. #TrumpRussia
Why is Trump only just now beginning to move against bump stocks? He said he‚Äôd do that immediately after Vegas. This has nothing to do with the #Florida shooting. The nation deserves solutions, not distractions. It needs #GunReformNow.
@585Conservative The Justice Department today is doing the same thing it always has: pursuing justice. Trump won‚Äôt stop screaming that the department is corrupt because he doesn‚Äôt like where the facts are leading, and that‚Äôs dangerous to our democracy.
Even as Nixon turned his fire on the prosecutor investigating him, he refrained from undermining the entire Justice Department. Trump shows no such restraint, instead making a reckless lunge at the pillars of our democracy. He must be stopped. #VoteBlue2018
Trey Gowdy‚Äôs decision not to run for re-election is a gift to this country; his tenure has been marked by endless partisan vitriol and millions of taxpayer dollars wasted on politicized faux-investigations of manufactured scandals.
Given that no evidence supports his conspiracy theories, it‚Äôs no wonder Trump spends his energy attacking career Justice Department employees, who are barred by law from publicly defending themselves. #VoteBlue2018 for #LawAndOrder!
It‚Äôs chilling to read #Mueller‚Äôs indictment and recall seeing those very same Russian Facebook pages and propaganda pieces shared by people I went to school with. Trump keeps saying we need to ‚Äúget smart‚Äù‚Äîhe has no idea how right he is. #TrumpRussia
So we just received conclusive proof that Russia attempted to subvert our democracy in the 2016 elections, and this is the president‚Äôs first response: trying to defend himself. Unbelievable. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/uAjUJSLbKs
@realDonaldTrump LOL what
@realDonaldTrump No üòÇ
@realDonaldTrump But you said all polls are fake news. I‚Äôm confused.
@Julian_A_Cox (He was a member of a far-right extremist group, but ok)
In the face of relentless Russian aggression, Donald Trump has completely abandoned his country. It‚Äôs time to elect leaders who will hold this corrupt president accountable and defend the United States. #VoteBlue2018 #TrumpRussia
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @TheDemocrats Sweet dodge
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @TheDemocrats Lol what does school prayer have to do with any of this
Stop for a moment and consider the fact that since his inauguration, the president of the United States has been waging full-scale war on first the US intelligence services and now our top law enforcement agencies, all in the hopes of saving himself from the #TrumpRussia inquiry.
13 Russians and 3 Russian organizations were indicted today for posing as American citizens with the intent of corrupting our political process. It‚Äôs a refreshing sign that even as Trump cries ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù the facts remain and the processes of justice continue. üá∫üá∏ #TrumpRussia
Even with the #TrumpRussia investigation still far from complete, I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that Trump is an even more dangerous and lawless president than Nixon. We must #VoteBlue2018 to defend our country and restore the rule of law.
@ALANDexter2020 @Motherpriestess Something tells me Saya is not actually from Japan...
If I had a nickel for every time I heard ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù after a school shooting, I‚Äôd be able to buy these Republican lawmakers away from the NRA, and maybe we‚Äôd have some common sense #GunSafety laws.
@ALANDexter2020 @Motherpriestess They said the same thing about the Vegas shooter after that incident. It‚Äôs their standard line, and they try to get it in peoples‚Äô heads immediately after the tragedy, before the actual facts come out. Despicable.
@ALANDexter2020 @Motherpriestess As do I. Thanks again for clarifying!
Even as #Trump publicly claims that #ISIS is on the brink, thousands of their fighters are slipping out of Syria and escaping into the surrounding territory. Does he think they‚Äôre just going to go away, or does he figure they won‚Äôt resurface until someone else is in charge?
@ALANDexter2020 @Motherpriestess Thank you both for clarifying, and for being able to distinguish between a lie and an error. We need more people like you.
@bfd_am Thank you!
@papahagy69 Lol. Okay, here‚Äôs the news article: https://t.co/AlZUQNxCLm		And before you start crying about ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù here‚Äôs the report it‚Äôs based on: https://t.co/xpdf7UHr15		Let‚Äôs get this corrupt scum out of our government.
The VA chief of staff falsified emails so @SecShulkin‚Äôs wife could vacation in Denmark on taxpayer dollars. Of course, the Justice Department declined to prosecute, because under @jeffsessions, Trump Administration officials are above the law. #Corruption #VoteThemOut
There have been 273 school shootings since Sandy Hook, and with each new tragedy, Republicans in power don‚Äôt flinch. Are the #NRA‚Äôs donations worth so much more to them than the innocent lives of their people? #GunControlNow
@Motherpriestess And yet, despite everything you just said, seatbelts still save thousands of lives every year. I will repeat the question for you: do you think they‚Äôre pointless, just because they don‚Äôt prevent every injury imaginable?
There have been 30 mass shootings in the 46 days of 2018. If you pick a random day in 2018, it‚Äôs much more likely there was a mass shooting than wasn‚Äôt. The truth is, these tragedies are more than foreseeable: they‚Äôre a regular occurrence. #VoteBlue to save lives. #GunControlNow https://t.co/on54dJFTT8
@Motherpriestess You are aware it‚Äôs proven that seatbelts save thousands of lives per year, right? Are you suggesting since they don‚Äôt prevent every injury imaginable, they‚Äôre useless?
@Motherpriestess There have been 28 mass shootings in the 45 days of 2018. If you pick a random day in 2018, it‚Äòs more likely there was a mass shooting than wasn‚Äôt. To claim we can‚Äôt ‚Äúforesee‚Äù a regular occurrence is to forfeit your claim of caring about the problem.
@Motherpriestess Is that a serious question? How do people prevent themselves from dying in car crashes all the time?
Recap of today: another tragic mass shooting at a school, another 17 innocent children killed, another corrupt member of the Trump Administration caught using our taxes to fund his vacation. This has to stop‚Äîour country is being run by people who don‚Äôt care at all about our lives

We‚Äôre 13 months into the Trump Administration, and it‚Äôs painfully clear: Hillary Clinton was THE law and order candidate in the 2016 election. I will #VoteBlue2018 to help reverse the damage to the rule of law in this country.
The 40 million Americans in California just went through drought, wildfires and mudslides, and now it looks like we‚Äôre headed for another drought. But sure, @GOP, keep pretending #ClimateChange is fake. #VoteThemAllOut
@LimmerEd Thank you! üòÉ
That Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee are choosing not to enforce the subpoena of Steve Bannon makes a complete travesty of their #TrumpRussia ‚Äúinvestigation,‚Äù and constitutes a dereliction of their duty to the American people. We need the truth. #ReleaseTheDemMemo
It‚Äôs time for all states to end the perversion of #Democracy that is partisan #Gerrymandering, no matter who these illegal maps give the advantage to. If they won‚Äôt do it, the courts should.
@norie0509 Thank you!
I just received my Nomination Papers from Corte Madera‚Äôs fantastic Town Clerk, and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited to be running for Town Council! I urge everyone out there who wants to solve problems to get involved in their communities. Change starts with you! #DemocracyFTW
The nation is outraged that #Republicans followed up their misleading #NunesMemo with a refusal to release the clarifying #DemocraticMemo. We will see you at the polls. #ReleaseTheDemMemo #VoteBlue2018
After years and millions of dollars wasted on faux-investigations, #Republicans seem to have finally moved on from the Benghazi, emails, pizzagate, and Uranium One conspiracy theories, all having come up empty. Moral: when the #GOP tries to get you outraged, ask for evidence.
@fakenewsnack @Cama_milashka Trump bashing does not figure into my campaign at all. I‚Äôm not running against anyone or anything; I‚Äôm running to help solve problems. This is my personal Twitter account.
Trump is making his strategy to retain the presidency perfectly clear: scream about transparency when it‚Äôs politically expedient, hide the truth and spew lies when it isn‚Äôt. #ReleaseTheDemMemo
@fakenewsnack @Cama_milashka Lol you missed the fence part
@fakenewsnack I‚Äôm curious, where did the whole ‚Äúbleach‚Äù thing come from?
@Chrysler300Jack If politicians aren‚Äôt standing for what you believe in, why don‚Äôt you run for office?
@TXwoodshop21 @hale4jesus ...You know the Republicans on the House Intel Committee voted to #ReleaseTheDemMemo, right?
How are people supposed to take Republican complaints about the #TrumpRussia investigation seriously, when even other Republicans are telling us the Democratic memo proves there was nothing wrong, but Trump won‚Äôt #ReleaseTheDemMemo?
@fakenewsnack I‚Äôm not a Republican, my friend. I want Trump to #ReleaseTheDemMemo because the American people deserve to see the truth‚Äîregardless of who doesn‚Äôt like it.
@LizUSA7 Lol how do you figure? You just claimed this was all a plot by Schiff.
What are you hiding from the American people, @realDonaldTrump? #ReleaseTheMemo
@hale4jesus Unless, of course, it was written by Republicans. Then I guess you release it before you ever even see it! üëçüèºüôÉ
@LizUSA7 You know Republicans on the House intel committee voted to release it, right?
@OracleOfFreedom Lol nice argument
@fakenewsnack Classic trumpster to advocate destruction of information that contradicts your beliefs. Just like climate change
@BrebrBB Idk you tell me
President Trump‚Äôs desperate move to repress the clarifying #DemocraticMemo saps any credibility from Republican complaints about the #TrumpRussia FISA warrants. What is he hiding from us? #ReleaseTheMemo
@Chrysler300Jack People like you, because they vote for it!
Some would call it ironic, but it‚Äôs true: if you want a stronger economy, some fiscal responsibility, enhanced national security, and Russia to stay in Russia, #VoteBlue2018.
@Cama_milashka And a fence with drones and cameras will do equally as well as a wall with drones at and cameras, at a fraction of the cost. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm calling for a fence with drones and cameras
@Chrysler300Jack Great philosophy. Let‚Äôs keep spending and never look back!
@Cama_milashka Nobody‚Äôs saying we should make or enforce laws. Do you realize we already have a physical barrier?
@accebersmith Ew
@Cama_milashka Ok here you go https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@Cama_milashka Lol therefore this is all okay?
Trump originally said he‚Äôd sign just about any #Immigration/#DACA bill Congress sent him. Now he‚Äôs rejecting proposals left and right and insisting that any bill incorporate a set of extremist demands, including billions for a wall Mexico was supposed to pay for.
Genuinely curious: is anyone in Congress even thinking about the enormous deficits they‚Äôre creating? Is there a plan? #FiscalResponsibility
@courts_decision #VoteDemocratic* üòâüëçüèº
By preventing America from taking the steps necessary to address #climatechange even as they dole out billions in aid to areas ravaged by abnormal hurricanes and fires, Republicans in Washington are flushing US dollars‚Äîand lives‚Äîdown the toilet. #VoteBlue2018
@AlphaMikeFox2 Conspiracy theories are much more interesting when they make sense. Page and other Trump associates were being investigated long before the [totally valid] FISA warrant was granted. #TrumpRussia
Did you mean ‚Äúbig unnecessary cuts in your savings?‚Äù #StockMarket https://t.co/zhmycI2kl1
@AlphaMikeFox2 As far as Trump is concerned the problem with the upper echelons of the @FBI seems to be that they‚Äòre hell-bent on doing their jobs. Tough cookies; shoulda thought of that before he committed #ObstructionOfJustice! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The thousands of #ISIS fighters escaping from combat zones in Syria represent a serious threat to American interests and innocent civilians around the world. Trump‚Äôs preference to congratulate himself instead of addressing this threat is disturbing.
@AlphaMikeFox2 Sorry dude, my tweet was not about you lol
@AlphaMikeFox2 Always have appreciated the FBI, always will. If that reality bothers you, I question your priorities
To those who don‚Äôt think Trump‚Äôs incessant attacks on law enforcement pose a threat to national security: a poll released last weekend found that only 38% of #Republicans have a favorable view of the FBI‚Äîperhaps the agency most directly responsible for keeping Americans safe.
@AlphaMikeFox2 Lol, observations? The vast majority of this country supports and appreciates law enforcement. Don‚Äôt try and vilify half the country by pretending otherwise.
@AlphaMikeFox2 Oops, someone doesn‚Äôt appreciate the law enforcement officers putting their lives on the line to keep you safe. I‚Äôm curious, where did the year 2011 come from?
Prediction: the way the tyrranical reign of this ‚Äústable genius‚Äù will end is with his lawyers pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.
@Rhonda4life I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just because he has no clue it even happened
@blainekell6 For the good of the country, I hope you‚Äôre right!
@LeeAMullen1 Exactly haha
@blainekell6 It sure does, doesn‚Äôt it?
@redleg81 https://t.co/6P1T609xh7
@ckelly36139592 Of what, being an obvious #TrumpRussia bot? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@NanInKansas Hell yeah! Check this out: https://t.co/6P1T609xh7
The FBI just arrested a man in Oklahoma who applied 20 years ago to join an Al Qaeda training camp, after matching fingerprints found on an IED in Iraq to his fingerprints on the application. Think about how impressive that is!! #ThankYouFBI
@Chrysler300Jack @TheDemocrats @TheView @HuffPost @TODAYshow @maddow It‚Äôs all that comment deserves.
A new poll suggests Trump‚Äôs endless attacks on the FBI have brought Republicans‚Äô faith in the agency down to 38%. Some of these people will sit on juries for cases in which their own disbelief of the FBI may well let criminals go free. Think about that. #LawAndOrder
@Chrysler300Jack @TheDemocrats @TheView @HuffPost @TODAYshow @maddow Lol
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative It seems as though you‚Äôre taking the intentionally misleading Nunes Memo is the whole truth, when in reality, even Republicans in Congress are telling you it‚Äôs full of omissions and mischaracterization
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative No it just won‚Äôt work, because warrants aren‚Äôt granted based on gossip. They‚Äôre based on evidence collected by law enforcement
The chair of the House‚Äôs extremist ‚ÄúFreedom Caucus,‚Äù @RepMarkMeadows, called passing yet another stopgap spending bill ‚Äúa good play call,‚Äù because to him, governing is nothing more than a game‚Äînever mind the millions of Americans affected by this irresponsibility. #VoteBlue2018
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative Is that all you‚Äôve got? If so, it won‚Äôt work
@585Conservative @DrunkAllah I guess we‚Äôll see soon enough
Let me get this straight: Trump spent months begging for a shutdown, and when Republicans finally gave him his #TrumpShutdown, he threw a fit and tried to blame the Democrats. Now he‚Äôs... doing it all over again?
The recent #StockMarket turmoil shows exactly what happens when the party in power takes a political dogma‚Äîtax cuts for the wealthy at all costs‚Äîand tries to turn it into policy without considering the consequences. #VoteBlue2018 to put people who actually think back in charge.
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative Saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a dossier of unverified allegations assembled by an expert as corroborated by what we‚Äôve observed‚Äù would not be false evidence in any way...
@MarcKamhi1 @DevinNunes @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats The #Democrats play by the rules because they‚Äôre the party of law and order. Sooner or later all of this will catch up to Trump and his abetters.
@585Conservative @POTUS There‚Äôs a difference between protecting national security and suppressing information that‚Äôs politically inconvenient for you, which is what Republicans are trying to do now. They don‚Äôt want us to see how misleading the #NunesMemo was.
@UrVaPId What solution did you lay out? You just said what you think will happen and threw in some random insults...
@papahagy69 I find that real-life observation is often more reliable than twitter and partisan media.
@papahagy69 Was he not...married to a citizen?
@UrVaPId Why does it seem like a bonehead move?
@papahagy69 No, I have not seen them do any of that, and I know several of them. All of them are grateful for the life they‚Äôve been granted here, and understandably anxious about having that life upended.
@papahagy69 I‚Äôm sorry about your injury and appreciative of your service, but my question stands.
Trump was already promising Republicans he‚Äòd release the misleading #NunesMemo before he had even seen it. Now that there‚Äôs a clarifying #DemocraticMemo, he feels the need to scrutinize and redact it? Why does he want to keep the American people in the dark? #ReleaseTheMemo
@papahagy69 What makes you think DACA recipients don‚Äôt appreciate what‚Äôs been given to them?
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative Presenting to a judge a document of allegations assembled by an expert that are not conclusively verified but corroborated by the rest of the body of evidence is not fraud; it‚Äôs how you show probable cause, letting you get a warrant to ascertain whether the allegations are true.
@papahagy69 1. I can assure you none of your money went towards my education. It seems you‚Äôre strongly opposed to helping your fellow countrymen get a quality education, so you‚Äôll be pleased to know that.	2. Where‚Äôd you get the idea ‚Äúmost turn out to be liberals?‚Äù
@Christy52950422 Very true, although I see value in reclaiming that phrase. Instead of being about releasing misinformation, let‚Äôs use their line to advocate letting the public see the whole truth!
@585Conservative @DrunkAllah It‚Äôs odd to me to see you make these kinds of statements since I‚Äôm not a consumer of CNN or MSNBC. Can you humor me and explain to me where the fraud was?
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative 1. You‚Äôve gotten fraudulent warrants?	2. Who are you accusing of fraudulently obtaining a warrant now, and how so?
@teeheeheemcfee I mean... I think anyone who‚Äôs half awake blamed them for the last one too lol. #TrumpShutdown
@ShaolinKungFu81 Most Democrats agree we desperately need tax cuts for the middle class, but the GOP tax bill was nothing more than a huge giveaway to the wealthy, many of whom can now get the permanent 20% corporate rate. Wrapping that in a small, temporary tax cut for the middle class looks bad
By pushing another short-term spending bill they know can‚Äôt pass the Senate, House #Republicans are trying to set themselves up to do the same thing they did just a few weeks ago: shut down the government, and blame it on the Democratic minority. #VoteBlue2018
@ShaolinKungFu81 Like which, for example?
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative I think your concepts of economics and the word ‚Äúillegal‚Äù are funny
@Christy52950422 Why not?
@DrunkAllah @585Conservative Lol
@ShaolinKungFu81 General overspending is a definite problem (except when fighting recession/depression), and the benefit of any regulation should always outweigh its burden‚Äîbut Obama gets little credit for his long campaign to weed out and cancel silly regulations left on the books
The House Intelligence Committee must be commended for its vote to release the #DemocraticMemo. There‚Äôs still plenty of opportunity for corrupt actors to suppress it, and we‚Äôll doubtless have to continue to fight for the truth‚Äîbut credit where credit is due. #ReleaseTheMemo
@585Conservative And let‚Äôs get one thing straight: I have nothing against rich people. Good for them. I‚Äôd like to join them one day. What I do have a problem with is how they are continually given these huge, permanent tax cuts, while the rest of us get tax cuts that are tiny and expiring.
@585Conservative Ignore the weather remark. Sorry for the attitude. But seriously, what do you think caused this then?
@585Conservative It has nothing to do with tax cuts? Then do tell me, what does it have to do with? The weather?
@585Conservative We have indeed had this discussion for, but I‚Äôll remind you: rich people can now file as corporations to get the permanent corporate tax cut. You and me are stuck filing as individuals, and when our cuts expire in 2025, you‚Äôll be see why that matters
@papahagy69 1. That didn‚Äôt make sense	2. Whose tuition do you think you‚Äôre paying? Lol
@ShaolinKungFu81 Yes of course! Those 8 years of stagnation in which unemployment fell by half and the stock market rose my 150%! Forgot all about them. It all makes sense now.
@585Conservative Trump may be the first person ever elected president not to understand that strong economy + tax cuts = inflation = fed pumps the breaks = stocks go down. That is very, very basic economics.
@585Conservative Oh don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll get your money back from you in 2025. I‚Äôm talking about blowing out the deficit in order to lavish tax cuts on the rich, then selling that as a boost to the economy, which has been strong for years and was already growing at about maximum speed.
@realDonaldTrump Cool fake dictionary. Is covfefe in there too?
Trump keeps reminding us the stock market is breaking records, and yesterday was no exception: the largest single-day drop in history. When your economic policy is based on political ideology, you get a #StockMarketCrash. #VoteBlue2018 to bring back policy based on economics!
@NoGOPNo The truth is, neither are treason, but only one is an obscene and disrespectful stain on the history of politics in this country. Guess which party did it. üôÑ
@Sospanfach3 Only like 2.6 trillion weeks!
Were some of those billions of dollars wiped out by the #StockMarketcrash yours? Fear not; thanks to the Republican tax law, some of you are now taking home an extra $1.50 a week! #VoteBlue2018
@MarcKamhi1 After listening to his speech in Ohio, I think you might be right
Sad and cynical, but classic Trump: in a blatant attempt to distract the puclic from the #StockMarketCrash, he accused Democrats who didn‚Äôt clap at his speech of treason‚Äîall too happy to throw our nation under the bus if he thinks it will save his political skin. #TreasonousTrump
@Johntylerpress It‚Äôs really not hard. It‚Äôs better to release no classified memo at all, but if you‚Äôre gonna release one that‚Äôs intentionally misleading, you damn well better release on that‚Äôs accurate. #ReleaseTheMemo
@BettyIngelsby @seanhannity Too good hahaha
@TheRealTicha Apparently hannity already blamed Obama lolololol
@John_B_Rad Wow... that‚Äôs too good lol
I‚Äôm waiting for the #Trump tweets claiming Hillary Clinton and the deep state caused this market sell-off. #StockMarketCrash
@Johntylerpress @novablue18 Although, to be fair, Paul Manafort showed up to a meeting with Russian agents to get information stolen from a US citizen, and Flynn coordinated with Russian officials to undermine US security/foreign policy strategy. That is basically the definition of collusion.
@Johntylerpress @novablue18 Implicated in the #TrumpRussia investigation* but yes, point definitely stands
@kenute2 Ooh another #TrumpRussia bot! Following 3 with 0 followers? A fresh one too!
The argument that the #NunesMemo somehow discredits the #TrumpRussia investigation is completely absurd; the #SteeleDossier is and always has been a minor piece in the larger investigation, and the Democratic memo will further prove that to the American public. #ReleaseTheMemo
@JamesMa67750068 Greetings comrade. I see the Internet Research Agency is still at it! #TrumpRussia #Bot
The #NunesMemo presented an incomplete, one-sided version of events to the public, with the transparent aim of misleading us. It‚Äôs time to see the Democratic memo, so the American people can have the whole story on this FISA warrant. #ReleaseTheMemo
@stonecold2050 I don‚Äôt think I know anyone who‚Äôs ever watched a single episode of the apprentice lol
@BigDaveW355 That was from the New York Times, and I trust their journalism‚Äîalthough the article didn‚Äôt specify what kinds of cuts it was talking about, so when all is said and done, I‚Äôm sure many of these billionaires will have had their taxes cut but millions
@bstnboy @jojoblais86 Truly unconscionable.
Under the #Republican tax plan we‚Äôre all now living under, the average middle class taxpayer gets a tax cut of $930. The average one-percenter gets a cut of $51,000‚Äîin other words, a middle class salary. This is obscene. #VoteBlue2018
@PoliticalGPS Uh... ALL lives matter.
@crosa1988 Only a #BlueWave2018 will show #Republicans that this country is for all Americans.
These recurring, tragic crashes of #Amtrak trains should serve as a wakeup call to President Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress: the state of our national #Infrastructure isn‚Äôt just embarrassing, it‚Äôs dangerous. Best wishes to the victims and their families.
@PoliticalGPS I mean... black lives do matter. All lives matter.
@MalissaPetre @ptufano17 Make sure you‚Äôre only getting news from verified sources. They‚Äôre not messing with the vote tally, just with peoples minds
@SerenityFoods That wasn‚Äôt the quote I don‚Äôt think, but that‚Äôs what he meant
@PoliticalGPS Can‚Äôt lie, that‚Äôs a pretty disgusting thing to say
It‚Äôs insulting that Trump tries to claim credit for low African-American unemployment, a trend that began six years before his inauguration‚Äîunder the first black president. #ThanksObama
@cruxotbiscuit As in, they submitted the yahoo news article to the judge as evidence that the investigation was now being discussed in the media, which they were worried might prompt Page to destroy evidence
@cruxotbiscuit No no. The article wasn‚Äôt evidence of the dossier being public, it was evidence of the investigation being public‚Äîbecause it was in this news article
Our country is in the midst of an unprecedented and sustained effort to delegitimize law enforcement, all for the benefit of a few corrupt politicians. It‚Äôs time for the American people to defend their country and their laws. It‚Äôs time to #Vote.
@cruxotbiscuit If you read an analysis of the memo, experts all agree the Yahoo news article was most likely used to show the investigation had become public knowledge. Baselessly claiming it was used as further evidence of collusion is unreasonable and disingenuous
Kennedy: ‚ÄúAsk not what your country can do for you‚Äîask what you can do for your country.‚Äù	Trump: ‚ÄúI could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it!‚Äù	#VOTE2018
@PoliticalGPS Which by no means means the dossier was the only piece of evidence, right? An unverified dossier alone can‚Äôt get a warrant‚Äîonly when reasonably corroborated by the rest of the body of evidence
@PoliticalGPS I have to ask, did you read the memo? The memo actually acknowledges that the investigation started because of Papadapoulos‚Äô actions, not because of the Dossier
@PoliticalGPS 1. The Dossier was never the basis for a FISA warrant; it was one piece of evidence among many	2. I am hearing that the FBI did explain the Dossier was political in nature
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump The Steele dossier was not the basis for the investigation, because it is a collection of unverified allegations. Every expert knows they‚Äôre not facts, even though they came from a generally credible source.
Devin Nunes‚Äô intentionally misleading memo is just another sordid attempt to distract us from #Mueller‚Äôs #TrumpRussia investigation. Remember the manufactured ‚Äúunmasking scandal‚Äù claiming Susan Rice broke the law, complete with fake whistleblowers? That was also Nunes.
@585Conservative Let me get this straight: you‚Äôre telling me this memo, incorrectly claiming the FBI withheld info from a judge, proves that Obama had Trump wiretapped? Tell me I‚Äôm missing something here lol
@PoliticalGPS Wow: all sorts of conflations going on here. The Washington Post, the media at large, the Democratic Party, and whoever made that movie are four very separate things, which you seem to be jumbling together in an attempt to make a political attack
Just read McGahn‚Äôs letter on declassifying the #NunesMemo, which seems to imply that Trump‚Äôs national security staff agreed with the decision to declassify‚Äîdespite the fact that officials at Trump‚Äôs National Security Council, FBI, and DOJ were all opposed to this reckless action.
The FBI has ‚Äúgrave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo‚Äôs accuracy.‚Äù How this obscenely recklessness move doesn‚Äôt disturb the same #Republicans that talk endlessly about national security is beyond me.
To make a false and deeply insulting blanket statement about two pillars of our justice system, claiming they‚Äôre politically corrupt, and then try to win back the support of their employees with a trite platitude isn‚Äôt just dangerous‚Äîit‚Äôs insulting. #StandWithFBI #LawAndOrder https://t.co/Isibo6Myy1
@585Conservative I‚Äôd imagine their editorial board opposes releasing the memo‚Äîassuming you‚Äôre correct; I wouldn‚Äôt know‚Äîfor the same reason GOP experts at the FBI and DOJ do: it compromises US intelligence means and methods, and paints a misleading picture by omission of critical facts and context
@585Conservative Lol right, like Hillary Clinton‚Äôs pizzeria child trafficking ring or Obama‚Äôs Muslim-ness?
@garybehle Of course they don‚Äôt care! He‚Äôs a Republican! He‚Äôs above the law!
#Republicans in Congress and the White House are now engaged in an effort to actively mislead the nation‚Äîagainst the legal and national security advice of experts of their own party at the #FBI and Justice Department. This is not what you were elected to do! #VoteBlue2018
@Decreevy More damage seems to be one thing this GOP is not worried about in the least.
It‚Äôs one thing for House #Republicans to #ReleaseTheMemo, misleading the nation and jeopardizing our intelligence processes‚Äîit‚Äôs another thing entirely for them to also block the release of a Democratic memo providing the necessary facts and context they left out of theirs.
@anticommunist0 @RepJoeKennedy It‚Äôs literally a central part of the bill. Corporate tax cuts (which the 1% can now use personally) are permanent, while the individual cuts for people like you and me end in 2025. Did you not know this?
Rebuilding our #Infrastructure was just about the only smart idea in Trump‚Äôs platform‚Äîbut the vague and unrealistic infrastructure ‚Äúplan‚Äù Trump released today makes clear that it was nothing more than #AnotherTrumpLie. Guess we have to #VoteBlue2018 if we want real infrastructure
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Obama got 48 million viewers, which is more than 45.6. You also spelled teleprompter wrong, but it‚Äôs closer than covfefe, so we‚Äôll let that one slide. #AnotherTrumpLie
@anticommunist0 @RepJoeKennedy You‚Äôre talking about the tax plan that will raise all our taxes in 2025 higher than they‚Äôve been in years? The tax plan that hurts everyone in this country who can‚Äôt reorganize themselves as a ‚Äúpass through business?‚Äù Gimme a break lol
@anticommunist0 @RepJoeKennedy How‚Äôs it a hilarious joke? Talk to any real live Democrat (like this one, for example) and ask them if they care. Spoiler alert: they do.
@pppatticake Seems to me like right now there are several statements of the obvious that our country could sorely use
@pppatticake It‚Äôs a pretty important thing to get right, wouldn‚Äôt you say?
Democratic @RepJoeKennedy was absolutely right in his #SOTU¬† response: we don‚Äôt have to choose between helping rural communities or inner cities, and anyone who tells you otherwise isn‚Äôt telling you the truth. #WeChooseBoth #VoteBlue
@RepJoeKennedy was absolutely right in his #SOTU response: we don‚Äôt have to choose between helping rural communities or inner cities, and anyone who tells you otherwise isn‚Äôt telling you the truth. #WeChooseBoth #VoteBlue
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews Lol. Who cares if a 72 year old man wears dentures
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews Lol where did the dentures thing come from
@dafactsjack @chriswhiz4u @TerriKincaid @BewareTheBeliev Looooooool
I‚Äôve never much cared for partisan responses to the #SOTU‚Äîon these occasions, let the president speak and judge his words for yourself, without the filter of party politics‚Äîbut this year, the response was more worthy of my time than the real thing. Thank you @RepJoeKennedy
@dafactsjack @adrianaslreci @TerriKincaid @chriswhiz4u @BewareTheBeliev Lol don‚Äôt hold your breath
@dafactsjack @TerriKincaid @chriswhiz4u @BewareTheBeliev ^can‚Äôt handle reality, substitutes lies instead because they make you feel better. Reminds me of a certain president lol
For the first time since I was a kid, I won‚Äôt be watching the #StateOfTheUnion‚Äînot as a boycot, but because I know there‚Äôs no chance it will contain useful information or inspiring sentiments. Instead, I‚Äôll be reading the news so I can remain an informed member of our democracy.
@LuvStarsStripes Lol, are YOU serious?? This is a screenshot of his ‚Äúfollowers:‚Äù https://t.co/HKMA2y4bnT
It‚Äôs a testament to this dark moment in US history that Andrew #McCabe, a top FBI official, felt forced to resign because the president didn‚Äôt like that he was doing his job. #TrumpRussia
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews You‚Äôre looking at their system of rule (totalitarianism), not at their political ideologies. Their political ideologies couldn‚Äôt be more opposite. Communism is about forced ‚Äúequality,‚Äù fascism about forced subjugation. They both result in the same thing: oppressive dictatorship
@Savanna39257956 Yep, California!
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews Obama is like 50 so I don‚Äôt think anyone thought he might wear dentures. I‚Äôm pretty sure his smoking was well-discussed throughout his presidency
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews They‚Äôre very similar in that they were both brutal, deranged dictators. They‚Äôre the polar opposites in terms of political ideology: communism (extreme left) vs fascism (extreme right)
@MsLisaBaby Thank you!
@MarcKamhi1 Thanks so much!
@SerenityFoods Thank you! üòÉ
@lilzboyzz Couldn‚Äôt agree more üòç
My hometown of Corte Madera is at a turning point: after a tough recession, we‚Äôre finally on stable enough footing to be able to invest in our own future. I‚Äôm excited to announce that I‚Äôm running for Town Council, because I want to help our community seize that opportunity!
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews Far left: Stalin. Far right: Hitler
@PoliticalGPS @littleirishmua @FoxNews The only way you could look at this graph and conclude it means the media is biased is if you start with the assumption that Trump is qualitatively deserving of positive coverage. An unbiased report will cover a negative thing negatively ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@jifisherohio @realDonaldTrump He has millions of fake followers. I just wanna know how many millions.
Question: how many of @realDonaldTrump's twitter followers are fake? And is he buying them with our tax dollars?
@murray_tim Thank you sir!
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex He may have lied to you about it during the campaign, but he supports it, and that‚Äôs what matters!
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex That‚Äôs a flawed way of looking at it seeing as he won a minority of the votes in the election and his support has only dropped since...
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex But he supports DACA... he said so many times himself
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex Tell me in what way you think not deporting the Dreamers is incompatible with American values.
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews If you‚Äôre coming at this from the perspective of ‚Äúwhy are they writing things about Trump they didn‚Äôt write about Obama,‚Äù I can see why it might seem unfair, but the answer is simple: Trump says and does things Obama (or any other president) would have never done. That‚Äôs news.
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews News organizations like the Times or the WSJ see their job as not ‚Äútreating‚Äù anyone at all, but merely reporting on what happens as it happens. You hear about the Russia investigation because it‚Äôs happening; you didn‚Äôt hear about Obama investigations because they didn‚Äôt happen.
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews You‚Äôre correct that most coverage of Trump is different than coverage of Obama‚Äîthey‚Äôre very different people pursuing VERY different policies, are they not? Where you‚Äôre not correct is in thinking the two are ‚Äútreated‚Äù differently. They‚Äôre not.
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews I noticed you didn‚Äôt acknowledge the economic stories I shared yesterday either. You might find it interesting to go and check other news sources once in a while. I‚Äôll tell you I certainly check in on Fox‚Äôs homepage once a week or so, just to see how it differs from othet media
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews Interesting. Just checked the Times homepage. The attached article was at the top, but there was no coverage of the TrumpRussia investigation today. Again, it seems like you‚Äôre repeating what Fox News tells you is true, rather than going out and verifying for yourself. https://t.co/9dIhoMrYal
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex Yeah. My certification is that I was born in this country, I‚Äôve lived my entire life in this country, and I spent a good deal of that life learning about the history of this country. That‚Äôs how I know what we as a nation stand and have always stood for.
@Davenunyabuzz @ProtectDaca_ You couldn‚Äôt really be more wrong. Americans DO want #DACA https://t.co/9e0bgF3IoW
@Bexofeasttex @JayStylus Looking at people who‚Äôve been put in a though situation and saying ‚Äúnot my problem‚Äù is not what this country is about. That‚Äôs what being an asshole is about.
@Bexofeasttex @JayStylus Lol what are you even talking about
The #GOP used to be the party of fiscal responsibility... now they‚Äôre hell bent on wasting billions of taxpayers‚Äô dollars on a pointless wall, and they forced a government shutdown to do it.
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews The problem with that assertion, good sir, is that it‚Äôs simply inconsistent with reality. Here are three examples of the very mainstream @nytimes giving me the facts I need on US economic strength. You‚Äôll find as many more as you want if you do your own research. https://t.co/tauOhYvFIC
@PoliticalGPS @FoxNews In what way is the media biased?
@MartyMarty222 @Suprmanj @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @WhiteHouse @GOP @rdsanchezjr @weeklystandard @WSJ Lol when
In a bizarre twist, the leader of the #GOP has become the primary consumer of @FoxNews propaganda designed solely to increase support for the GOP. https://t.co/Ykn6bSLj0G
Trump promised 4% economic growth a year. Reality: last quarter came in at 2.6%, and after a year under Trump, we still haven‚Äôt seen 4% growth since Obama was president. #AnotherTrumpLie... just sayin‚Äô.
@LuluJaynes @SenThomTillis Call his office and tell him that!
Trump promised Senators to their faces that he‚Äôd sign just about whatever #DACA bill Congress passed. Fast forward five days, and he shut down the government because it didn‚Äôt include his list of ridiculous demands. Shoulda seen this one coming.
@585Conservative I believe it‚Äôs 4 West in Bobtown, so I guess that would mean it‚Äôs probably bituminous
@Boudicca2017 You know, now that you mention it, that does ring a bell...
No Senator who wants to be seen as reasonable should give in to Trump‚Äôs demand to waste billions of dollars on a border wall. The good news: they don‚Äôt have to. If Donald thinks he can create a false choice between financial responsibility and #DACA, he‚Äôs wrong yet again.
@RetroCrone @DevinNunes An excellent question.
It‚Äôs beginning to seem as though @DevinNunes and #Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee will stop at nothing in their attempt to derail the #TrumpRussia investigation; even the Trump DOJ is warning them it would be dangerous to release cherry-picked classified info.
@mywritinginprog Very true
@EastinCM @realDonaldTrump 100% yes
@AnnTruwe @mywritinginprog No need to demonize the miners. Sure, some are stubborn about the changing economy, but plenty of others gratefully accept training and assistance. As for the rest, they can take as long as they like to come around, but we should help them when they do. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs right.
If the texts demonstrate an intent to act, show us. So far all we‚Äôve seen is texts showing that they disliked Trump, which shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone‚Äîthese agents chose a career protecting law and order. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/giLKIg272A
@grandpamike1 No, but we can wait until they‚Äôre ready to accept help. How long that wait is is up to them.
@MargoJBrosnan No sympathy is almost never the right move ;)
@grandpamike1 That‚Äôs the same line Republicans say about the working poor üòî
@Bckrda They‚Äôll come around, and we should stand ready to help when they do. It‚Äôs the right thing to do.
@reece_norwood I completely agree that subsidies for coal are wrong
@grandpamike1 I bet you most of them will come around, and we should be ready to help them when they do.
@juney9800 Plenty do want to rejoin the workforce, and voluntary training needs to be made available to them.
As another coal mine in #Pennsylvania succumbs to market forces, one has to ask: what is the Trump administration going to do for those 370 miners, many of whom have never held another job? It‚Äôs time to help former miners get job training so they can get back into the workforce.
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenSchumer Likewise üòâ
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenSchumer Still hung up on old Hillary Clinton, retired grandmother and avid trail-walker, eh? Haha
@woltz1975 You clearly don‚Äôt know how the law works in this country.
@woltz1975 Yes, but we make our own laws. We can do that, meaning we can make a law that says the dreamers can stay. I‚Äôm not talking about their parents, I‚Äôm talking about people brought here as kids
@woltz1975 I mean... they are by definition legal. That‚Äôs what DACA is. What we are talking about is not taking their legal status away because of something their parents did
@PoliticalGPS Yes, although I think any halfway reasonable person would tell you that goes without saying. Non-citizens who commit serious crimes here should be deported. That‚Äôs common sense. Also common sense: let the hard-working, law-abiding dreamers stay!
@woltz1975 Dude these are people who were brought here against their will as children. Why upend their lives when they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong?
The #Dreamers must be allowed to stay in the US; it‚Äôs the only stance compatible with traditional American values. They didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. #DACA
@KerriAdams10 Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about. Please explain
Even with total control of the federal government for the last year, @realDonaldTrump and #Republicans in Congress are still trying to blame #Democrats for the #TrumpShutdown. Where is the leadership? Where‚Äôs the responsibility?
An @ENERGY department photographer exposed @SecretaryPerry‚Äôs #corruption with a photo of him hugging a coal executive. Then he was fired. #TheFascismIsReal
Before calling something fake news, one should first understand what news means. First place in @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #FakeNewsAwards was given to an ~opinion~ writer for the New York Times...
@davidco93445617 And it needs to be fixed regardless of which party is the perpetrator.
It‚Äôs sad for the people of #Pennsylvania that, after the State Supreme Court found the state‚Äôs #Republican-gerrymandered maps to be illegally silencing voters, state Republicans vowed to focus not on restoring their democracy, but on defending their #Gerrymandering.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump The fabric I‚Äôm talking about is the reasonable trust that has always existed in this country whereby people don‚Äôt automatically assume someone is out to hurt the county just because they vote differently. Trump actively undermines that trust by sowing political extremism.
This is so reckless and irresponsible. For the president of the United States to demonize an entire party with falsehoods isn‚Äôt just a sad act of desperation‚Äîit‚Äôs an assault on the very fabric of our nation. https://t.co/sjjG64A9dv
‚ÄúWe will attack Conor Lamb, we will define Conor Lamb.‚Äù -#Republican strategist, all but admitting that there‚Äôs no real reason to support @RickSaccone4Sen over @ConorLambPA.
What Trump doesn‚Äôt understand is that nobody wins a government shutdown. It‚Äôs time for Republicans in Washington to show some responsibility. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/bYlofCoWpR
Turkey, a US ally, is now attacking the Syrian Kurds‚Äîanother US ally. Yet because he has squandered America‚Äôs international influence and goodwill, @realDonaldTrump is powerless to stop this attack on US national interests. This president is dangerously weak.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump You may recall that in the summers of ‚Äò15 and ‚Äò16 there was a story about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs emails on the front page of almost every news outlet almost every day‚Äîeven though it was obvious there was nothing there.
@kosmokittie Just wrong.
@soleilbrille18 @RebelRunning You just heard from one.
@cpaletz Nice work! üëçüèºüëçüèº
@HeidiLiFeldman Thank you for all the support, Heidi! üòÉü§ó
Interesting that almost all the instances of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù named in @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #FakeNewsAwards were innocent errors that were very publicly corrected. Meanwhile, you never see corrections from Trump, Breitbart, etc.‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre not just making mistakes, they‚Äôre lying.

#TrumpRussia bots are now being used in an attempt to convince Americans that the #TrumpShutdown is the Democratic minority‚Äôs fault. Block and report to fight back against Trump and Putin‚Äôs disinformation offensive. https://t.co/QTWtibohdk
@papahagy69 Only if they go through the system fair and square.
@papahagy69 ...Are you talking about the dreamers who were brought here against their will as infants?
@papahagy69 Nobody is breaking in and demanding citizenship. Quit being dramatic.
@dwp4401 @JasonStonehouse @clairecmc Mitch McConnell is the one who willfully chose to submit a bill that wouldn‚Äôt pass, and chooses now to reject all bills that could pass. That‚Äôs why the government is closed.
@Laurelsson Believe me, Democrats are against holding up the budget too. The problem is, even though they run the government, Republicans still aren‚Äôt willing to submit a bill that can pass!
The dramatic decline in global respect for the United States under #Trump is allowing China and Russia to fill in the gaps, making regions across the world less safe and less stable.
In a telling sign of how completely #Republicans in Washington have abandoned the idea of fiscal responsibility, @CFPB director @MickMulvaneyOMB has requested a budget of zero, so he can wipe out the organization‚Äôs reserve fund. Because reserves are somehow bad.
@PoliticalGPS It‚Äôs a #TrumpShutdown in every world. Republicans are in control. It‚Äôs their job to submit a CR that can pass. By refusing to do that, they ensured a shutdown. Then they blamed the Democrats for ‚Äúharming the military‚Äù‚Äîjust before explicitly blocking military funding. How insane!
@HaeringMike @clairecmc My mistake! Even more disgusting.
@papahagy69 Was that or was that not the meeting where he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to say gee I want this or I want that. I will sign it?‚Äù
@LuAnneOstby99 @clairecmc He objected to her attempt to continue paying the military.
@michiganderboy They‚Äôre not the ones who blocked Sen. McCaskill‚Äôs effort to fund the military through the shut down. That was all Mitch McConnell, because he thought he could trick people like you into blaming the Dems. You‚Äôre smarter than that!
@Berniepage12 @DarvinsReturned @jynclr You know the government has only been shut down for 2 days, right?
Day 2 of the #TrumpShutdown, and still struggling to understand why Republicans in Congress would rather shut down the government than fix DACA and fund CHIP. When will they decide to do their jobs?
NO WORDS: After shutting down the government, Mitch McConnell sought to pin the blame on the Democratic minority, who he accused of harming the military. Just hours later, he blocked Senator @clairecmc‚Äôs motion to keep funding the military through the shutdown. #TrumpShutdown
If Republicans in Congress were really that upset about service members not getting paid during the shutdown, they‚Äôd simply reopen the government. It‚Äôs a shame their actions contradict their hollow words. #TrumpShutdown
@Cauliflower5150 @KenBonnie But only until Republicans decide to reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown
@Cauliflower5150 @KenBonnie You should get some of the other #TrumpRussia trolls to follow you. Makes your account look less fake
Well Donnie, it took you 8 months and innumerable lies and flip flops, but you finally got your #TrumpShutdown. This may be the first achievement of your presidency you can actually take credit for! https://t.co/PFEB3623jl
@OBlondie48 It‚Äôs been a long, long time since the GOP was interested in ‚Äúfamily‚Äù
Want to talk about recklessness? Republicans refused a deal that would‚Äôve added funding for border security, all because it also included provisions to not screw over the dreamers. The result: #TrumpShutdown
@WatchChad Lol wow. I guess dream big, right?
@Veronic79656622 @benwikler @crzyuncletrump Ew lol
@nwri99416 What they needed was to submit a bill that could pass. They refused to do that, thinking the public is dumb enough that they could blame the powerless Democrats and people wouldn‚Äôt think twice. It seems they were mistaken
@ABarnes13046679 Howdy #TrumpRussia troll. Blocked and reported üòä
@tommyobrien Not at all. It was the GOP congress‚Äô fault then, just like it‚Äôs the GOP congress‚Äô fault now. I‚Äôm merely pointing out the absurd hypocrisy üôÉ
@dukeiyer @JumpTheRework HAHAHA so real dude
@MaryCat1988 Don't forget Hillary! She is the literal antichrist! But also Obama. Maybe they take turns? Idk how it works
@KerriAdams10 You're being deliberately unreasonable. What's the point
@KerriAdams10 I can‚Äôt for the life of me understand why these sort of common sense ideas weren‚Äôt passed with bipartisan support decades ago. By the way, what does blue dog mean lol
@KerriAdams10 I am very sure I‚Äôm arguing the right side lol
When Republicans in Congress shut down the government in 2013, they blamed Obama because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs the president.‚Äù How do they think they‚Äôre going to do the same thing today and not blame Trump? The #TrumpShutdown defies all logic.
@etherealjester Lol dude, I know because for the last several of weeks Donald Trump wouldn't stop saying that funding for the wall has to be part of any spending agreement
@KerriAdams10 https://t.co/tK6LA5xdjQ check out immigration. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
@KerriAdams10 Like I just said, Trump killed the deal before it even had a chance to get to the committees. Sadly, Republicans in Congress seem to be literally incapable of disobeying Trump, lest he should tweet about them.
@EgJacki The visa lottery was signed into law by a Republican president in 1990. The problem is that today's Republican Party has become so extreme, they think traditional Republican principles are socialist. It's honestly pretty sad.
@dpinsen I don't really understand how you see two Senators put forward a deal that adds extra funding for border security and come to the conclusion that they're for open borders lol
@BertW86 @ToddRabenberg Fair enough
@EdHeileson Sounds like you're not aware that DACA was part of the deal long before CHIP. It was in the deal Graham and Durbin took to Trump, but Trump freaked out, so the Republicans had to scrap it and look for other leverage: innocent CHIP kids, whose funding they let lapse months ago.
@EgJacki Oh, it had plenty of GOP principles alright. The problem is today's GOP has no use for principles.
@2014racer Are you kidding me?? He told them on 1/9: "‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to say, ‚ÄòOh, gee, I want this or I want that.‚Äô I‚Äôll be signing it.‚Äù Then, when they came to him with their deal, he freaked out. Just #AnotherTrumpLie
@iversong21 Now there's a logical argument if I've ever seen one lol
@albybrava Yeah, "hard leftists" who had just reached a solid compromise fixing DACA and providing extra funding for border security, only to have Trump throw a fit.
@CaroleE48386394 There is no choice. That's what Republicans in Washington are telling you so you stay loyal. The fact is Congress can fund the government, fix DACA, and fund CHIP, and the fact that they didn't do all 3 is a huge disgrace. (Also, no federal works are laid off; who told you that?)
@KerriAdams10 Because before that could happen, Trump had already thrown a fit over it‚Äîjust days after telling them "I'm not saying I want this or I want that. I will sign it." #AnotherTrumpLie
@texasnaomi @sengraham2016 @SenateGOP @SenateDems @POTUS In Trump's meeting he said "I'm not saying I want this or I want that. I will sign it." Then he completely went back on his word‚Äîjust like he does every. single. time.
This is #Republican obstructionism at its finest: they claim to support #CHIP, but they let its funding lapse, then used these innocent kids as political leverage. What happened to common sense and American values? #TrumpShutdown
@colbymonterey There is no choice. Republicans in Congress need to fund the government, fix DACA, and fund CHIP, and they need to do it now. It‚Äôs been months already!
Seems like all of a sudden Republicans forgot how our government has always worked: if your bill doesn‚Äôt have the votes to pass, you should change it. If you refuse to change it, you‚Äôre not doing your job. #TrumpShutdown
@JoleneDoty Thanks same to you
@Galea430 Lol even more nonsensical the second time
@Pepe_the_froggy Where are you from
@JoleneDoty I said nothing about your intelligence. I was insulting your lack of argument, as I'm sure it wasn't arguments like that that got you your doctorate.
@divabusiness He would have been if he hadn't freaked out and scared all the Republicans away from the deal they made lol
@Galea430 Lol got 'em
@colbymonterey It's simple: fund the government. Fix DACA. Fund CHIP. Do all three, and do them now. It's time for the GOP to grow up and govern already!
@JoleneDoty Ah yes, a well-reasoned and irrefutable argument. Well done.
@KerriAdams10 Whoa, some cracks in your English showing there! You're not a #TrumpRussia troll, I hope! One more English fail and I might have to block and report, so Google Translate carefully, comrade. By the way, the Durbin/Graham bill included extra funding for border security. Sorry.
@KenBonnie @Valerie74189942 @Twitter Block and report. Repeat when they get unfrozen. Let's clean this place up
@KevinJoeWV Oops looks like someone's a racist
@divabusiness Then I don't suppose you believed him either when he said he'd sign any agreement (he freaked out), he was a good negotiator (blew up the deal), Mexico would pay for the wall (we now have a #TrumpShutdown because he wants money for the wall)...
@KenBonnie @FDTProgressive @TheObamaphile @ToddRabenberg Can't blame them. Trump makes so many empty promises every day, it would be impossible to keep them all in your head
@KenBonnie @Valerie74189942 I reported that #TrumpRussia troll a few days ago. I guess @Twitter already unblocked her...?
@baxterbill46 hahaha tell me you're joking
@feru012 @TheDemocrats I love the color scheme though. So unabashedly fascist. Classic.
@feru012 @TheDemocrats Lol they made a website?? This #TrumpShutdown must be putting a real dent in the GOP propaganda fund!
@eriktweets @ToddRabenberg Shhh he was already forgetting! Donnie is going to be very angry with you.
@DarvinsReturned @Berniepage12 @jynclr Honestly, so bad at it! Shockingly so.
@candyq50 Two out of the three Senators you just named are Republicans...?
@kohljm I'm curious: did you actually think that was true, or did you just decide to throw it on out there? https://t.co/L3rxDVAd6z
@kohljm ...CHIP funding that Republicans let expire months ago, because they don't care. Now they're using those same sick kids whose funding the ended as political leverage, hoping they'll get off the hook for fixing DACA? This whole #TrumpShutdown is completely disgraceful.
In case anybody forgot: Senators Graham and Durbin reached a solid compromise, but then Donald ‚ÄúArt of the Deal‚Äù Trump freaked out and moved the goalposts. Shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone, given he‚Äôs been saying he wants a shutdown for months. #TrumpShutdown
@PolitikalNUT You mean... the last time Republicans shut down the government for no good reason? Lol
@PoliticalGPS Glossing over the fact that DACA recipients are inherently here legally (hence DACA), Durbin and Graham had a solid deal that fixed DACA while adding border security. That was a completely win-win for the country. Donald "I'll take the heat" Trump then promptly blew it.
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex Bro learn about DACA if you wanna have this conversation. The dreamers were brought here as children. They grew up here. This is the only country they've ever really known. Now they're about my age, working and paying taxes, like me.
@KSTksti Any yet it's somehow "the Democrats' fault." Completely unreal.
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex Presumably all of them, since they are working here lol
@Cauliflower5150 By the way, CHIP doesn't "expire today." It expired last fall, when Republicans in Congress let its funding run out‚Äîbecause they don't want "handouts" for sick children. That's deplorable any way you cut it.
@Cauliflower5150 It's not a choice at all. I don't get why Republicans in Congress (and I guess you too) seem to think the three are mutually exclusive. Fund the government, fix DACA, fund CHIP, and do it now. This is literally your job.
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èthey ARE American taxpayers! What did you think DACA was all about, dude? It‚Äôs work permits! So they can keep working! And paying taxes on the money they make by WORKING!
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex In this case it‚Äôs not about what we need. It‚Äôs about doing the right thing. It‚Äôs about not screwing over people who didn‚Äôt do anything wrong
@MericaFirst2016 Were you on a debate team ever? You‚Äôre really good
@JayStylus @Bexofeasttex I think you‚Äôre deeply out of touch with the values that have defined this country for centuries. That‚Äôs a bummer.
@ProphetDano I didn‚Äôt realize the Democrats caused Hurricane Maria lol
@JayStylus We both know why Congress can‚Äôt pass it: because Congress is controlled by Republicans, and these Republicans are terrified to do anything that might make Trump tweet about them
@MericaFirst2016 That doesn‚Äôt look like anyone building anything to me. It looks like someone whining about someone else
@Bexofeasttex @JayStylus Do you really believe that the Dreamers, who were brought here as little kids against their will, deserve to have their lives totally upended?
@MericaFirst2016 Oh haha nice send pics
@ToddRabenberg Border security yes, wall no
@MericaFirst2016 Lol don‚Äôt hold your breath
@ToddRabenberg Correction: Democrats are trying to vote for three things: funding the government, fixing DACA, and funding CHIP. Where are the Republican votes??
@MericaFirst2016 Lol how dumb do you have to be to believe this kind of stuff
@JayStylus The reasonable majorities of both their parties?
It seems to me that if the #Republicans controlling Congress don‚Äôt have the votes for their spending bill, their bill needs to change. If they‚Äôre not willing to submit a bill that will pass, that‚Äôs on them. Isn‚Äôt that how governing works? #TrumpShutdown
@scott_regentin Apparently not
@kohljm You know that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre trying to get the Republicans to agree to, right?
@ChipKellysystem How did you end up trapped in a country where people help people? Gross!
@ProphetDano Nobody‚Äôs trying to get more voters. Just doing the responsible thing.
@JayStylus Durbin and Graham reached a fine bill. Then Trump freaked out and pulled the rug out from under them. He sabotaged this whole thing! He‚Äôs been saying he wants a shutdown for months...
@MissionSJWTears @Sonny762x39 Lol spoken like someone who understands
@karenpiscopo1 Yes, they need 60 votes. So why are they still playing around with a bill they know doesn‚Äôt have the votes? Time to get to work on something that can actually pass! #TrumpShutdown
@Sonny762x39 Correct. Government funding, DACA, and CHIP are three totally separate things. #Republicans in Congress need to do all three, and do them now. Enough of these ridiculous #GOPshutdown antics.
@scott_regentin No kidding!
@PoliticalGPS I don‚Äôt know why Republicans in Congress‚Äîand apparently you too?‚Äîseem to think the three are mutually exclusive. Fund the government. Fix DACA. Fund CHIP. Do all three, and do them now. It‚Äôs your job. #TrumpShutdown
@Bexofeasttex @JayStylus Are you aware that #DACA has nothing to do with Dreamers‚Äô parents, and that without it, they could be subject to deportation? You wanna get your facts straight before making wild accusations.
@Bexofeasttex @JayStylus Actually, Durbin reached a very fair deal with Graham‚Äîonly to have the rug pulled out from under him by Trump. If Republicans want a #TrumpShutdown, they should keep moving the goal posts.
@KerriAdams10 That‚Äôs not how government works. If you‚Äôre submitting a bill that doesn‚Äôt have the votes, change your bill. If you refuse to change it so it can pass, that‚Äôs on you. #TrumpShutdown
@SharCLARK4 Lol, right. Chuck Schumer, with essentially zero power in Washington, holds the mighty Trump administration in his fist. As if. #TrumpShutdown
@JayStylus It seems that if Republicans don‚Äôt have the votes, their bill needs some tweaking, doesn‚Äôt it? Isn‚Äôt that how voting works?
The Republicans controlling Washington have three VERY EASY jobs in front of them: Fund the government. Don‚Äôt screw over the dreamers. Don‚Äôt toy with CHIP. Act like responsible, compassionate, American leaders and do all three. Start solving problems already. #TrumpShutdown
@PoliticalGPS Why in the world would #Republicans in Congress feel the need to use these poor dreamers‚Äô lives as political leverage? Just do your jobs already! #TrumpShutdown #GOPShutDown #RepublicanShutdown
@CamDrugich45 You know that they‚Äôre... supposed to choose the lowest bid, right? To save money? For the people?
@CamDrugich45 Lol that totally misses the point. We don‚Äôt need the government to build roads because they‚Äôre complicated. We need the government to build roads because I don‚Äôt think you can afford to buy all the land between your house and the grocery store and pave it.
@CamDrugich45 Are... highways a problem? Just curious.
@CamDrugich45 I‚Äôm glad to inform you that your vision of a, to borrow a phrase from Trump, ‚Äúshithole country‚Äù where people are sick, ignorant, and paranoid isn‚Äôt the country we live in.
@CamDrugich45 That‚Äôs why I say these are easy yes‚Äôs. Fund the government. Don‚Äôt screw over the dreamers. Don‚Äôt toy with CHIP. Act like responsible, compassionate, American leaders and do all three. Start solving problems already.
@CamDrugich45 The kids that benefit from CHIP aren‚Äôt ‚Äúillegals‚Äù either. Do they deserve to have their CHIP funding callously ended, then dangled in front of Congress as leverage? Shouldn‚Äôt they be more than a political football?
@CamDrugich45 Glossing over the fact that DACA participants are inherently not ‚Äúillegals,‚Äù do you think they should be kicked out? Should they have their lives totally upended when they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong? They were brought here against their will.
A #TrumpShutdown would be perhaps the clearest sign yet of just how incompetent the people leading our government are. Truly shameful. https://t.co/PFEB3623jl
@IamNitishSingh Gerrymandering is unconstitutional and anti-democratic no matter who perpetrates it.
@CamDrugich45 If you‚Äôre only interested in doing what you‚Äôre required to do and only interested in helping yourself, this probably isn‚Äôt the country for you.
@webber_9esw9 That is exactly what happened!
Democrats in the Senate are totally right to demand a real spending bill with real solutions to #CHIP and #DACA. It‚Äôs time for the Republicans controlling all three branches of government to step up to the plate and demonstrate a little responsibility. #TrumpShutdown
@CamDrugich45 My reply is: why are we in this situation at all? Because Republicans refuse to govern responsibly. They refuse to solve DACA and they refuse to fund CHIP, both easy yes‚Äôs. They choose instead to use these programs as leverage for yet another 1 month spending extension. Insane.
@PoliticalGPS Maybe people there aren‚Äôt quite as obsessed with immigration as they are here?
@mpratschner @GOP Go read my tweet again dude. The whole quotes thing shouldn‚Äôt be that hard.
@mpratschner @GOP LOL
@NancyAlfer Well-reasoned and articulate. Nice üëåüèº
@mpratschner @GOP You know your tax cuts are going to expire in 2025, right?
#Trump literally told us months ago that he was going to force a #GovernmentShutdown shutdown. Now he‚Äôs trying to blame it on the #Democrats? Give us a break! https://t.co/PFEB3623jl
@Motherpriestess Do you really believe these kids who were dragged here by their parents deserve to be kicked out? They didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, and screwing over people who didn‚Äôt do anything wrong is anathema to everything this country stands for.
It‚Äôs absurd that #Republicans in Congress are posturing as supporters of #CHIP‚Äîa Democratic program started by Bill Clinton‚Äîafter letting its funding expire last fall. #RepublicanShutDown
@PoliticalGPS Other countries don‚Äôt seem too perturbed by Germany‚Äôs small (but very well equipped) military; Germany is still increasingly the country they look to for leadership and guidance. And if you look at her recent moves, I think Merkel learned her lesson about immigration
Why can‚Äôt North Carolina #Republicans just stop the unconstitutional #Gerrymandering?
@PoliticalGPS Lol
It‚Äôs really not hard. Fund the government. Fund #DACA. Fund #CHIP. Quit it with the #RepublicanShutdown games and do your job, @SenateGOP &amp; @HouseGOP!
@DeplorableFinch @GOP Do you not understand that Republicans are unwilling to move a simple spending bill that doesn‚Äôt waste money on the wall? They had such an easy job to do...
@DeplorableFinch @GOP Right. The Democrats who control zero branches of government. Good one
@PoliticalGPS Lol people liked Obama because he wasn‚Äôt an asshole. Pretty simple. No POTUS puts other countries‚Äô interests first‚Äîexcept maybe #TrumpRussia?
For those who don‚Äôt understand how #Trump hurts US interests internationally: global approval of US leadership has dropped nearly 20%. Germany has taken our spot as the most-approved of global power, and we‚Äôre now almost even with Russia and China.
Senators @MarkWarner and @timkaine are right: no #TrumpShutdown, no recess, and no vacations for Congress until they reach a bipartisan and long-term deal on #DACA and #BorderSecurity.
@_forlorn_hope @GOP wait... are you saying TARP caused the recession?
@JacksonOrley Good man
@JacksonOrley Please do. I‚Äôll be here
@_forlorn_hope @GOP I like how you blamed Obama for the economic disaster that happened before he took office. Did you think if you just slipped it in among all the other lies we wouldn‚Äôt notice? Haha
@blackmonp But Trump loves China now because they made him feel special...
@JacksonOrley Yes. Crossing the border illegally is illegal, and needs to be stopped. Now where did you get the idea that Obama encouraged illegal immigrants to vote?? Hahaha
@puckroger @GOP Lol
Then I guess we‚Äôre doomed to another #RepublicanShutDown. https://t.co/pIkmIDdqAe
@rebeccamoucha @GOP You‚Äôre saying the Democrats, who control no branches of the government, are the ones threatening to shut it down? Give me a break lol
@_forlorn_hope @GOP I can only remember one #governmentshutdown during Obama (9/30/13-10/17/13), and it was brought to us by the #GOP-controlled House...
@Golfpgtaa That is perfectly compatible with what I said...?
@JacksonOrley You realize that people who aren‚Äôt registered to vote can‚Äôt vote, right? If so, do you realize you can‚Äôt register to vote if you‚Äôre not a citizen?
@PoliticalGPS Lol why would that be interesting? But I‚Äôm pretty sure you can buy that data. Go for it!
@leslymill Voter suppression groups*		And backed up is really pretty misleading, because it suggests they have evidence. They merely ‚Äúagree‚Äù
@TheTruthWorker Lol typical #TrumpRussia troll response!
@DargDarg2 Yeah... he also said he was going to bring back the steel and coal industries, solve North Korea, end the Iran deal, get tough on China, build a wall, get Mexico to pay for it...
@sule_hansen Well put!
@Laurelsson Obstructionism? On the part of the party trying to PASS a #DACA bill? I think you‚Äôre confused my friend.
Error: when CNN falsely says Trump had early access to Wikileaks documents, then very publicly corrects itself	Lie: when #Trump says millions of illegal immigrants voted in 2016, then says it again, and again, and again...	#FakeNewsAwards
@TheTruthWorker Lol work on your English, comrade.
@TheTruthWorker @realDonaldTrump Lol that‚Äôs for sure! üòÇ
So @realDonaldTrump comes up empty again‚Äîbut when his target is a central pillar of our #democracy, you have to be glad. #FreePress #FakeNewsAwards https://t.co/daoJ4NSYda
@joeyess @GOP Hahahaha I‚Äôm dying. You couldn‚Äôt make this stuff up!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@realDonaldTrump I think this really sums up the entire presidency: https://t.co/8MucTgvAo9

@realDonaldTrump #ThanksObama! üòÉüôèüèºüá∫üá∏
@yakendo @realDonaldTrump Ok, I see the problem here. Naturalization means conferring citizenship. If you‚Äôre open to naturalization, you‚Äôre open to letting these people who were brought here against their will stay. If you‚Äôre open to letting them stay, you‚Äôre open to #DACA. I think we‚Äôre on the same page.
@mf_buckley Perhaps he‚Äôs better suited to protecting the country than running it.
‚ÄúMy message has always been be kind, be considerate, and we need to help people when they‚Äôre down.‚Äù	-@PattyforSenate. No wonder she just took back a Wisconsin State Senate seat held by Republicans for 17 years! Congratulations!!
@Motherpriestess The past 10 years should speak loud and clear: that moment will arrive much sooner than we think.
@AaronNeff2 @cpaletz Thank you for your work!
@Motherpriestess It sounds as though you just denied they‚Äôre a threat and then acknowledged that very threat...?
@cpaletz So the key is to report the #TrumpRussia trolls as impersonating someone else I think. Is that what you used?
@cpaletz Nice!
The Korean decision to field a joint team at the #Olympics is a welcome sign of det√©nte‚Äîbut it must not be mistaken for substantive progress on the very real threat that #NorthKorea poses to millions of innocents in South Korea, Japan, and the USA.
@yakendo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What does the word ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù mean to you?
@Mari_Huskey Bummer
@snowball1926 You and I both know nobody actually wants ‚Äúillegals first, security second.‚Äù That‚Äôs just something you tell yourself because it makes it easier to hate the responsible people unwilling to waste billions of tax dollars on a useless symbol of racism and fear.
So, @realDonaldTrump was adamant Mexico would pay for the wall... now he‚Äôs threatening to force a #GovernmentShutdown if Democrats don‚Äôt fork over the tax dollars to pay for it? #AnotherTrumpLie
@russhanson LOL talk about bigotry!
@paulkel84279181 You‚Äôd probably do better writing in Russian lol
@russhanson You seem to be forgetting who‚Äôs in charge of the entire federal government lol. Way to pass the blame
@onlydutt You essentially just said ‚Äúthe compromise you supported doesn‚Äôt matter. You reject compromises.‚Äù ü§î
Just so we‚Äôre all on the same page: Senators Graham and Durbin had the outlines of a solid win-win deal (extend #DACA, more money for border security), but when they told Trump, he threw a fit. Now Republicans have caved to Trump, moving the goalposts and threatening a #shutdown.
Empowered by @realDonaldTrump, @MickMulvaneyOMB is using the @CFPB to draw a curtain around shady banks, so Americans can‚Äôt see what they‚Äôre doing with our money. Hey taxpayers, get ready for another #Bailout!
@onlydutt You seem a bit confused. Senators Graham and Durbin had the outlines of a deal that would benefit the country (extend #DACA, more money for border security), but when they told Trump, he threw a fit. Now Republicans have caved to Trump, moving the goalposts and dropping the deal.
@Laurelsson You can blame whomever you want, but the fact remains that the government is completely controlled by Republicans. And by the way, wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù be all about funding the government?
@Mescalero09 @PatedBears @ChuckGrassley I noticed that too haha
@585Conservative @PatedBears @POTUS Interesting that these tax cuts aren‚Äôt coming with smaller government‚Äîthey‚Äôre just coming with more debt.
@iamAtheistGirl @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha
@PatedBears Yes.
@PatedBears You know we already have a barrier, right?
@gregpalmerx Like any of them? Ever?
@PatedBears @585Conservative Cool #AlternativeFacts. I think the real number is closer to 60%, and those that do get cuts will be paying more taxes than ever before when their cuts expire in 7 years.
@PatedBears @PoliticalGPS https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@russhanson @GOP Speaking of talking points üòÇ
@russhanson @GOP Lol what? You‚Äôre gonna not only not respond to my valid arguments, but then claim I didn‚Äôt actually say anything?
@russhanson @GOP And how about when it expires in 2025 and I‚Äôm paying more taxes than ever before in my life‚Äîall so the 1% can keep filing as corporations and paying next to nothing?
@cpaletz Let‚Äôs clean this place up!üòÉ
American #immigration law should not involve cruelly tearing children away from their parents. That‚Äôs common sense.
@SpindocOnCall Because 1. Having a scumbag as president is embarrassing and an insult to this great nation 2. When the president needlessly insults other countries, it damages US interests
Let me get this straight: Trump‚Äôs #shithole comment comes out, and although people are outraged, even the #LiarInChief can‚Äôt bring himself to deny it. Then, after several days of public outcry, two #GOP Senators say it was all made up? What must Trump have on them?
@calihatestrump Haha so true
@PMueller2 I don‚Äôt want a #governmentshutdown... but what I don‚Äôt want even more is for our country to waste billions and billions of dollars on a wall that won‚Äôt impact border security at all.
@KSnedski Haha touch√©
I am stunned to see #Republicans in Congress on the verge of forcing a #governmentshutdown, all because common-sense Democrats won‚Äôt consent to wasting billions of dollars on a useless wall. #VoteThemOut
@gtsnidow Interesting indeed. @Twitter, care to explain?
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve set new records, and I think they‚Äôll be continued to set.‚Äù		-The same guy who yells that immigrants should ‚Äúlearn English,‚Äù @realDonaldTrump ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@heathertromble1 It means we‚Äôre scaring Vladimir Putin
Two #TrumpRussia trolls in one morning! But it‚Äôs nice when they come to you instead of you having to go out and find them. Time to block and report! https://t.co/vY75RC8T6t
@RickHunter7 @GOP Amen!
A #governmentshutdown by the @GOP would be the ultimate signal of corruption: all they can manage to do is cut taxes for themselves and their donors before they hang up their hats.
@MsTex_as4now Yep. They all retweet one another to boost their impact.
@jenk264 I went with ‚Äúpretending to be someone else,‚Äù since Dimitri Popov or whatever their real name is obviously isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúValerie Johnson 362846728‚Äù
@realDonaldTrump Just #AnotherTrumpLie... https://t.co/BNPWkMOhIg
Got another #TrumpRussia troll, courtesy of the Internet Research Agency. You know the drill: block and report. https://t.co/jFECl8kmxQ
@Valerie74189942 Ok jk, you‚Äôre a #TrumpRussia troll. Don‚Äôt bother trying to respond.
@Valerie74189942 Can you please explain to me why you think illegal immigrants are voting? They can‚Äôt register to vote, and you can‚Äôt vote without being registered to vote.
@CKJactor Thanks!
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Blame the students (and mob psychology), not the colleges
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Let‚Äôs fix it!
@SerenityFoods Haha thank you
@585Conservative Me too lol
If Republicans are so worried about immigrants voting Democratic (and again, illegal immigrants can‚Äôt vote), why don‚Äôt they just adopt better policy positions?
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP What I assume you‚Äôre referring to is when students band together to prevent extremists like Ann Coulter from preaching ideas that are not conservative, but simply hateful. They do this because they are outraged by the ridiculous (and radical) stances so popular on the right today
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP I also find the idea that conservative ideas aren‚Äôt allows on campus quite misleading. They are, and are taught. We learned about the potential benefits of deregulation and small government. Furthermore, no ideas are banned from campuses. That would be a violation of rights.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP I will say that part of the GOP‚Äôs drift right seems to be redefining socialism to encompass social democracy, which it doesn‚Äôt. I also question where you got the idea that colleges are teaching capitalism is evil...?
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Our democracy isn‚Äôt functioning as it‚Äôs supposed to, and until we fix it by restoring real competition of ideas, it won‚Äôt. In the meantime, yes, the Democratic Party has lurched left and the GOP has lurched right. The results are scary and actually dangerous to our country. 2/
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP It seems both parties are getting more extreme, when political science tells us they should be converging. The reason that‚Äôs not happening is because our democracy is being distorted by gerrymandering and obscene campaign finance laws that basically codify softcore corruption 1/
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP I completely agree
@Dean_Simmonds_9 @realDonaldTrump @GOP ?!??!!!!!?!
@twitturbug9 No, but extremely detrimental to impinge US foreign relations and even more detrimental to hamper counterterrorism operations.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP That is true. Also true: in our country it would be very easy to make it so that even if some people have better lives than others, nobody has to have a shitty life. We can achieve that without taking anything significant from anyone, and Democratic ideals say we should.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP No it has not‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt know of any serious/credible person who does support Marxism, so I‚Äôm not really sure why we‚Äôre discussing it.
@twitturbug9 I am not vilifying anyone. I am acknowledging the severe and detrimental effects of her ill-conceived actions.
@twitturbug9 Nope. I care about the whole truth, which I can handle without flying to irresponsible overreaction
@political_twee Thank you sir! I try my best
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Totally agree; if all we have is hating Trump, we deserve to lose. Fortunately, the Democratic Party represents the principles of equality, justice, prosperity, responsibility, and putting people first üòäüá∫üá∏
@DavidWFlaugher @realDonaldTrump @GOP God I can‚Äôt wait to cast my votes.
Here‚Äôs what I know: in the 2016 presidential election, the majority of American voters said they didn‚Äôt want @realDonaldTrump to be president, but the @GOP continue to prop him up. There‚Äôs only one way to vindicate American democracy: #VoteBlue
@isobel_starling @JP_ColdSteel Only in that they are two totally unqualified Senate candidates (for totally different reasons). I too admire her desire to continue making changes‚Äîbut I would not feel comfortable with her having access to classified info as a Senator.
@QueenbeeAxs Very true
@585Conservative I do indeed. What district do you live in?
@MsLisaBaby Another very valid reason to be unsettled by her candidacy.
@andradare Unfortunately, the two are not always mutually exclusive. Based on news reporting and the statements of US officials, there can be no doubt she damaged US security and interests. I can only speak for myself, but she didn‚Äôt tell me anything I didn‚Äôt already know
@jimjamescomey @EvaTarnawski THANK YOU. Everything you said should be perfectly obvious.
@EvaTarnawski Lol what about it? And what happened to you exiting this thread?
@EvaTarnawski Also like that, yes
@EvaTarnawski the more I think about this tweet the more incredible it is. Did you look at any of my other tweets? Did you read my bio? Or did you just see my tweet about Chelsea and fly into a rage? Did you try at all to learn who you were talking about before making hysterical accusations?
@BostonCore Amen, for the sake of democracy
@Northsiders1985 Hahahahaha
@Kizzysmom She filed to... ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@StephenPJohnso3 Fortunately, the choice is not ‚ÄúChelsea or a Republican‚Äù
@andradare I‚Äôm sure she isn‚Äôt afraid, and she has overcome much‚Äîbut none of that reverses the damage she caused to our national security. I wouldn‚Äôt trust her with classified materials as a Senator
@JP_ColdSteel Exactly. Part of me immediately felt like this was the left‚Äôs response to Roy Moore...
@EvaTarnawski It has nothing to do with her being transgender. It has to do with her willfully impairing the national security and interests of the United States.
@EvaTarnawski Where did you get the idea that I‚Äôm ok with the whole concept of the trump presidency?
Deeply unsettled by the prospect of Chelsea Manning in the Senate; we‚Äôve already seen what she does when entrusted with the responsibility to serve her country.
@Northsiders1985 The idea that Barack Obama doesn‚Äôt know how many states there are is hilarious
@585Conservative Gerrymandering is clearly a perversion of the founding principles of this country, and I have faith the Supreme Court will recognize that.
@585Conservative The will of the people? The people who have had their voices silenced by ridiculous maps? Give me break haha
You don‚Äôt have to be an expert to understand that partisan #gerrymandering, which silences American voters because of how they think, is completely at odds with our Constitutional principles. It‚Äôs time for the courts to step up.

@TheSirFatty We could really go on lol
@clintonredding There is zero chance the government would allow deployed forces to be put at risk by a shutdown.
@Ewing619 @CNNPolitics The Netherlands should call the White House right now and tell them to take this clown back or they‚Äôll expel him.
Doesn‚Äôt get any more ‚Äú#Trump‚Äù than this: US ambassador denies own comments, then denies denial @CNNPolitics https://t.co/Kvku4fYEqe
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock Why wouldn‚Äôt anyone believe what I just wrote?
For PM Abe to boycott the #PyeongChang2018 #Olympics would be a petty and erroneous move. It‚Äôs time for Japan and South Korea to respect and accommodate each other, so they can work together to face the ever-growing threats to their security from China and North Korea.
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock I highly doubt that. The average citizen hears Trump say he turned the military around and figures it could be true, but a soldier hears that line and they know nothing has changed. They know the guy who‚Äôs supposed to be in charge is all talk, and that‚Äôs not good for morale.
@TsinKletsin A fantastic question!
@Rightturnclyde4 @realDonaldTrump We should be so lucky.
@BobJSilverstein @realDonaldTrump Not canceling the Iran deal
@habeshagardener Terrifying.
@habeshagardener That is incomprehensible!
Why is it that whenever @realDonaldTrump happens to do the right thing, it‚Äôs the complete opposite of what he promised to do during the campaign? #IranDeal
@habeshagardener Are you quoting Trump?! Tell me he didn‚Äôt say that... or babble that. Whatever you call that.
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock I guess I just pay attention ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but thanks to you and your parents for your service
Literally nobody wants people and drugs to pour into country from the southern border. The president of the United States is using his twitter account to spread #FakeNews.	#AnotherTrumpLie https://t.co/stt3kuCYS6
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock Yeahh... that‚Äôs not really how it works, but if you can tell yourself that and be unconcerned about actual military strength, good for you üëçüèº
@Bckrda Exactly!
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock All of those things are true (except for our military getting stronger; it isn‚Äôt changing). Trump‚Äôs effect on those things ranges from some to none at all
@PaoloPissoffi That‚Äôs a definite no. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòî
@grwaltonsr Maybe it wasn‚Äôt pee... he did rock it pretty well :p
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock Dude it does happen. It is happening. It happens all the time. It‚Äôs a central part of how foreign relations work
To all Republicans: stop for a moment and think about how you‚Äôd react if Obama spoke at a press conference about selling other countries F-52 jets, which don‚Äôt exist.
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock This will make some foreign leaders dislike the POTUS and not want to help him advance our interests, but it also turns foreign publics against the US, which can make it politically hard for foreign leaders to help us, even if they personally don‚Äôt care what Trump says. 2/2
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock Countries are most likely to support our foreign interests when they feel that the US is worthy of their support. When the POTUS makes vulgar insults to other countries for their own misfortune, it makes the rest of the world view the US as less worthy of their support. 1/2
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock They are part of the explanation. Are you interested or not?
It‚Äôs disturbing to see the president try to confuse several important national security investigations; it‚Äôs sad to see him confuse only himself. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/5gklAppNbf
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock Sure. As a starting point, some questions: do you think the US has interests around the world? Do you think we have influence around the world? Do you think other countries can have an impact on our interests around the world?
Donald Trump continues to spread #FakeNews; a government shutdown doesn‚Äôt affect military operations or other critical national security functions. The saddest part is, I‚Äôm not even sure if he knows that. https://t.co/XZaT0VKNvQ
@MartinZane3 @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs actually kind of an amazing argument to me... that one cannot know what is going on unless someone tells them what‚Äôs going on. Speaks volumes to the mindset of trump supporters and the way they take his every tweet as holy fact, ignoring what‚Äôs right in front of them.
@MartinZane3 @realDonaldTrump 1. It‚Äôs common sense	2. Those without common sense can have this concept clearly explained to them by the British public discourse
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump @HowardStern @chrisrock I am not personally offended by his insult towards those countries. I am offended by the idea that our president would behave himself so dishonorably, and in a way that is strategically damaging to our country
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump Nobody is question his right to say them. People are merely reacting to what his words say about him as a person, and to the effect they‚Äôll have on our standing in the world and therefore our ability to advance our interests.
@MartinZane3 @realDonaldTrump The UK doesn‚Äôt want the queen to embarrass herself by meeting Trump. The queen invited him knowing the government would protect the dignity of the crown. Pinhead üòä
@Markwil50187274 @realDonaldTrump Hahaha
@Chrysler300Jack Lol are you suggesting that people being disgusted by what a piece of shit the president is constitutes a violation of his first amendment rights??
@jendew400 @TomSteyer 100% damaging our democracy‚Äîseverely.
@Chrysler300Jack Every vote counts. That‚Äôs kind of the whole point of this country.
@sesauls @realDonaldTrump @GOP The @GOP doesn‚Äôt care that Trump lies like a rug. They care about keeping their donors happy. #VoteThemOut #VoteBlue
@realDonaldTrump Or is it that you weren‚Äôt invited to London?
Thank you @TomSteyer for not running. You‚Äôve done much for the Democratic Party (including that), and until we‚Äôre all free of #CitizensUnited, we will continue to need your help offsetting the disastrous influence of far-right megadonors on our democracy.
@Chrysler300Jack Tell that to the people of Virginia‚Äôs 94th district.		Do you not vote?
@arcimperii However long, it‚Äôs too long.
@James01716401 What part of my phrasing confused you?

Donnie, EVERYBODY is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing.	#StableGenius #ShitholePresident https://t.co/Z664QIyYIA
@blkbored @realDonaldTrump You can thank Vladimir Putin and Steve Bannon for that!
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump Lol dream on dude üëçüèº
With his vulgar and condescending comments today, @realDonaldTrump definitively proved that we‚Äôve never had a president more ill-fit to lead. His lack of intelligence and respectability bring new shame on this country every day, and we all deserve better. #Resist
@Pm1Pierre What the hell?!
@Pm1Pierre Who is referring to countries as shithole countries?
@JubalEHarshaw0 @585Conservative It‚Äôs much easier to attack a point of view you assign to someone than their actual point of view. Classic straw man.
@blakemankansas @BarackObama Lol illegal immigrants have never been allowed to vote in this country. Get a grip.
@585Conservative It‚Äôs disingenuous to suggest I am anti-border security when you know that I am very much pro-border security, as is clearly spelled out in my essay‚Äîwhich you‚Äôve read.
@Pm1Pierre Who is?
@bmeier79 Sadly he‚Äôs already begun üò¢üá∫üá∏
@Pm1Pierre Hahaha so true!
@585Conservative I‚Äôve already sent you my essay on border security‚Äîreal border security‚Äîso it seems pretty disingenuous of  you to keep reverting back to this claim...
@blakemankansas Of course I vote
@MariMFry :(
@wyn_a Perhaps!
Just so we are clear: if any of my representatives vote for a bill wasting billions of dollars on a totally useless wall, I will never vote for them again. Ever. https://t.co/WjZr0fsj3p
@An_fibrofog The question of this era
When will these relentless attacks on our judicial system by the President of the United States stop? It‚Äôs time for some law and order. #RuleOfLaw https://t.co/Ma1xXljE0J
Hey @SeemaCMS, how come you can‚Äôt even make a simple #Medicaid announcement without spewing lies about Obama? ‚ÄúSoft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the previous administration?‚Äù You shouldn‚Äôt be in government. #Disgraceful
Given that #FusionGPS itself urged the Senate to release its testimony, @ChuckGrassley‚Äôs warning that releasing the transcript would discourage other witnesses from testifying is downright disingenuous; he‚Äôs not fit to lead an investigation of this gravity. #TrumpRussia
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump I had hoped so, but then you came at me with the whole ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt want the wall because you want open borders because you think it will help your political party,‚Äù which is an extremely silly put down
@Deborah00796667 @realDonaldTrump Which is grossly irresponsible for any 71-year old president, to say nothing of Trump!
@mblackburn Dangerous.
There‚Äôs an alarming level of confusion evident in @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs tweets this morning, both about FISA and the #TrumpRussia investigations. For the sake of our country, I hope his physical today includes screening for cognitive impairments.
@realDonaldTrump So then... polls aren‚Äôt fake news?
@GilmoreUSHouse @AngelRafPadilla @jordanXrachel @Alyssa_Milano @FWD_us @NilcOrg @tizzywoman @perfectsliders Good luck, Michael! I know you‚Äôll serve your constituents well!
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump Lol what? Folks on the left don‚Äôt want the wall because it‚Äôs a gargantuan waste of money. But there‚Äôs a win-win: Trump can simply tell his supporters ‚ÄúI never said we were building a wall. Wall is a bad idea‚Äù and they‚Äôd forget all about it, and none of us have to waste our taxes!
@FinneyTay We need McCarthy out before he endangers the country by trying to derail important investigations
@logarasbeach @Chris24405745 Hahaha k glad it wasn‚Äôt just me seeing that
@greerichardson @joycemarieh66 @realDonaldTrump Almost dystopian...  churches indoctrinating the masses
@jackgalt64 @realDonaldTrump Hahaha you just repeated what I said and then added some lies onto the end!
@FinneyTay Absolutely. For what a great state this is, we really have some of the worst Congressmen ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@charlesreed85 @SenFeinstein I love Dianne. I don‚Äôt find her ‚Äúaccommodating‚Äù at all‚Äîjust clear-eyed.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah good luck with that
@katieschwartz Wow! Thanks so much! üòÉ
@Chris24405745 I read. What was your point?
@jackgalt64 @realDonaldTrump You probably didn‚Äôt see most people who‚Äôd never met them at their funeral.		We already have a fence. What we need is better technology and more patrols.
Over the past year, our beautiful California has been battered by a stunning array of disasters, from raging fires to horrific floods, thanks in part to #ClimateChange. It‚Äôs time for us to say that we won‚Äôt elect another climate-denying politician to Congress‚Äîever. #Montecito 2/2
As the scope of the terrible mudslides in Montecito becomes clear, I hope emergency personnel are able to find and rescue the 13 people who remain missing after this unbelievable tragedy. 1/2
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump The wall is not part of border security, because it would have no real effect on border security. What it‚Äôs part of is keeping people like you worshipping him
@katieschwartz Don‚Äôt hold your breath üòî
In a vicious move that will shock almost no one, @realDonaldTrump is now essentially holding the #Dreamers and #DACA hostage. His demand? To be allowed to waste billions of taxpayers‚Äô dollars on a pointless wall.
@realDonaldTrump Correction: I meant to say $5.5T and $1.5T, respectively.
@mammo49 @realDonaldTrump Yes, thank you for catching that!
@sandra_9224 @realDonaldTrump The problem is they like it
@joycemarieh66 @realDonaldTrump Many of them probably don‚Äôt; the rest probably don‚Äôt care. Anything that Dear Leader says must be true!
It is cynical and disrespectful for @realDonaldTrump to get on a podium in front of farmers and lie to their faces, telling them he passed $5.5B in tax cuts instead of the actual $1.5B. #AnotherTrumpLie
Justice for the #Dreamers in exchange for more border security is a great deal‚Äîbut that must be REAL border security, not a 13+ billion dollar wall that will do nothing except symbolize hate and fear. It‚Äôs time for the @GOP to get serious about our border, and drop the wall.
@gatorKayla2 As I understand it, no‚Äîbut if/when the NC GOP appeals it to the Supreme Court, that ruling will set a national precedent
Rather than appeal the federal judges‚Äô ruling against their egregious #gerrymandering, #NorthCarolina Republicans should do the right thing and serve ALL their constituents by creating fair and legal district maps. If they can‚Äôt do that... #VoteThemOut!
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump That would only help if the main issue was people simply walking across the border. The much bigger issues are drug smuggling and larger scale human trafficking, which usually either go through ports of entry or around the land border
@RickBhasin I didn‚Äôt call anyone racist (that was you, of people with ‚Äúwhite guilt.‚Äù) I said the wall was a symbol of racism.		And again, have you heard of airplanes, submarines, boats, tunnels, or drones? Learn a little bit about drug trafficking dude. The wall wouldn‚Äôt accomplish anything
@585Conservative @Cindylo64062788 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You know whether or not you‚Äôre rich; I don‚Äôt. But unless you‚Äôre reorganizing yourself as a pass-through business, we‚Äôll all be suffering together when our tax cuts disappear in 2025, leaving us paying more in taxes than at any point under Obama!
@RickBhasin Lol, don‚Äôt have an answer?
@RickBhasin Haha I‚Äôm genuinely curious now, what did you think a straw man argument was?
Just a few days ago he said it was six trillion. #FakeNews #AnotherTrumpLie https://t.co/ricYzt4ThL
@RickBhasin Clearly‚Äîbut don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll tell you: it‚Äôs when you assign someone else a point of view that‚Äôs easy to attack because you can‚Äôt attack their own, i.e. ‚Äúyou feel guilty about being white‚Äù
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump That when you advocate murder people will think you‚Äôre a freak? I know, typical. üòÇ
@RickBhasin I don‚Äôt know why you bothered replying lol. You just took what I told you‚Äîabout myself‚Äîand said I was lying. You can‚Äôt win an argument by assigning someone straw man points of view
@585Conservative @Cindylo64062788 @realDonaldTrump Lol, you would know ;)
@ccgrimm @ChuckGrassley Apparently not üòî
@RickBhasin No white guilt here, buddy. The doors and windows on my house actually accomplish something: they keep me warm. A giant concrete border wall would accomplish nothing real, hence, it‚Äôs only purpose is as a symbol of keeping ‚Äúthem‚Äù away from ‚Äúus‚Äù
@JamesJT99 Your statements are true, but it‚Äôs a symbol of keeping ‚Äúthem‚Äù away from ‚Äúus.‚Äù https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump So you‚Äôre an advocate of murder, huh?
@TulsaTalkin @realDonaldTrump Apparently...?
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump Then you should really understand it better, but thank you anyways for your service.
@Mescalero09 @ChuckGrassley It really does make you wonder...
It is a shame that @ChuckGrassley tried to keep the #FusionGPS transcripts secret in the first place, even more so because the only plausible motive is that the transcripts did not support the misleading narrative he sought to paint. Our country deserves better. 2/2
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump Given that you can‚Äôt respond to my points other than to assign me one that‚Äôs easier for you to dispute, I think we‚Äôre done here.
A huge thank you to @SenFeinstein for releasing the #FusionGPS transcripts, providing the nation more transparency into the #TrumpRussia investigations. Your courageous action demonstrates that the only way to fight lies is with the truth. 1/2
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump What isn‚Äôt proactive about investing in border security measures that provide more bang for the buck? What isn‚Äôt reactive about throwing billions at a useless wall, when the problem is largely boats, drones, and airplanes? Get a grip dude. This is important.
Even as he continues to lie that Mexico will pay for the wall, @realDonaldTrump is trying to cut funding for actual border security operations to build it. This president is a national security threat.
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump Lol you strike me as the type of person that‚Äôs not impressed by anything more complex than ‚ÄúBUILD THE WALL!‚Äù
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
Thanks to the effects of climate change, 2017 was the most expensive year in American history when it comes to natural disasters‚Äîmeanwhile, the @GOP continues to insist that addressing the issue is a ‚Äúwaste of money.‚Äù #VoteThemOut
@DrunkAllah @realDonaldTrump Have you heard of this phenomenon called the tunnel?
@585Conservative I don‚Äôt think I mean investors like you, and certainly not investors like me‚Äîunless you‚Äôve got tens of millions in the stock market. I don‚Äôt want to assume.
PLUS 6 trillions dollars for the investor class. MINUS 1.5 trillion for the United States, to cut the investors‚Äô taxes.		Retweet if you‚Äôve had enough.	#VoteThemOut https://t.co/ricYzt4ThL
@LeenaNevaTuuli @realDonaldTrump Hahaha that was insane
In a sign of how little he actually cares about border security, @realDonaldTrump wants to reduce funding for proven security measures like radar, sensors, and patrols in order to fund a useless wall. #Moron
@elindburg @realDonaldTrump In the political science sense, it‚Äôs fairly accurate. The unprecedented extent to which lies and deception are employed by this administration makes it almost a different form of government than American democracy...
There are two kinds of resistance in this country: those who resist truth and reality, and those who #Resist the regime of @realDonaldTrump.
Just watched the interview; I think our #stablegenius might have forgotten which one is Jake Tapper and which one is Stephen Miller. https://t.co/LHvFjpEAvT
Important to this president: trying to discredit the #FreePress.		Not important: us.	#RealNews #FakePresident https://t.co/LQB3PkdLvo
@PoliticalGPS And the US should secure its borders. A wall would be of almost no help in that, but would be hugely expensive. https://t.co/5uqQ9atuEK
Trump says he‚Äôd ‚Äúlove to take care of #DACA,‚Äù but that‚Äôs #AnotherTrumpLie. What he‚Äôd love is to waste billions of dollars on a wall that does nothing except symbolize racism and fear.

Six trillion dollars in value created, and almost all of it goes straight to the 1%: this is a @GOP government doing exactly what it‚Äôs designed to do. #VoteBlue https://t.co/BJovuwxlwg
Can‚Äôt lie, waking up this morning without any tweets from @realDonaldTrump insisting he‚Äôs a #stablegenius was quite a let down.
@Chrysler300Jack @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying we‚Äôre ‚Äúcreating‚Äù them, just that we‚Äôre making them stronger and more common than they would otherwise be. Scientists won‚Äôt attribute any one weather event to climate change, because you have to look at the broader trends‚Äîwhich aren‚Äôt normal at all.
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @TruthinGov2016 I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying anyone prevented Hillary from going to Wisconsin...

@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump Lol 2 more just popped into my head: drafting Don Jr.‚Äôs false statement on his campaign meeting with Russian agents and pressuring Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn‚Äîwho he knew had committed a crime. Disgusting.
@GrammaGaz @realDonaldTrump That honestly wouldn‚Äôt shock me at this point lol
Does anybody else find it bizarre that @realDonaldTrump would even try to take credit for 87 consecutive months of job growth, when he‚Äôs only been in office for 12? #FakeNews
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump 2 easiest obstruction cases: firing Comey in an attempt to derail the investigation, and ordering Sessions not to recuse himself in an attempt to block it. This isn‚Äôt hard at all dude.
@PoliticalGPS @realDonaldTrump Lol. No. I don‚Äôt know whether there is evidence or not, because I‚Äôm not working for the special counsel. If there is evidence, it will come out. If there isn‚Äôt, we can all move on.
#AnotherTrumpLie. Democrats are doing exactly what the #Dreamers deserve: standing firm on #DACA until Trump backs down from his racist and political games. https://t.co/OgqRjfJ3sb
@bfd_am @realDonaldTrump VERY
A White House lawyer misled Trump about whether he had the power to fire Comey, because he was worried Trump would commit #ObstructionOfJustice... and Trump did it anyways. What a #moron. #TrumpRussia
@AltLeftFreeBird @realDonaldTrump Then let‚Äôs get to flipping! It‚Äôs time to see some justice for the American people.
@MereteVonDOE @Amniot @realDonaldTrump Again: our modern alliance with South Korea is not about communism.
Trump‚Äôs corrupt decision to open nearly all coastal waters to drilling is not just a huge environmental mistake (someone didn‚Äôt learn the lessons of Deepwater Horizon)‚Äîit‚Äôs also a massive economic threat opposed by a huge constellation of small businesses nationwide.
@poozwah @realDonaldTrump Very well put!
While we don‚Äôt yet know to what extent @realDonaldTrump colluded with Russia, we know without doubt he obstructed justice on multiple occasions. For the sake of the nation, Congress should begin impeachment proceedings now. #TrumpRussia
@AlresfordBear There‚Äôs nothing warmongering about this South Korean administration, I can assure you.
@dvalls1006 Not unless we #VOTEVOTEVOTE!!!
@Donaldomondi17 @realDonaldTrump I, and many other Americans, are painfully aware of that truth üòî and I think many of us want to help once again make the US a country the rest of the world is willing and eager to work with
@Donaldomondi17 That‚Äôs somewhat understandable, but still incorrect. He makes a mockery of American values every day.
@PoliticalGPS How does that constitute audacity? Multiple sources‚Äîincluding several at the FBI‚Äîhave made perfectly clear that the dossier was not the basis for the investigation. The dossier is essentially all hearsay. Nobody takes it nearly as seriously as Trump and his worshipers do.
@darwin_hannon .......‚úÖ
I know many will enjoy Steve Bannon‚Äôs abandonment by his allies and the crumbling of his hateful movement, but this is much more than poetic justice for the nation he viciously tore at‚Äîthis is a moment of fundamental correction, however small, for our society.
@Mytweetydogs @realDonaldTrump And she is!
@GingerSue42 Thank you!!
@JBradshaw_SCV @realDonaldTrump But perception is everything, and people know that the horrible new tax law took effect on the first of the year. They know what‚Äôs coming...
@Dean_Simmonds_9 @realDonaldTrump 2018 is gonna be a big year for us!
@Amniot @realDonaldTrump Our modern alliance with South Korea is about mutually beneficial commerce, military cooperation, and shared democratic values‚Äînot about keeping South Korea from going communist.
@PoliticalGPS You seem confused. The dossier was begun with GOP funding, and is typical opposition research. Not sure why you‚Äôre so excited about it. The FBI is, of course, not corrupt at all. And Trump‚Äôs claims that Obama spied on him have been proven to be lies.
@Booseresists @realDonaldTrump Looooooooool
A seven-year growth streak in US auto sales just broke‚Äîare we already seeing the effects of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam, as buyers react to losing the deductions they relied on?
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump Lol
@Amniot @realDonaldTrump Well, you certainly have a perspective on the war that I don‚Äôt‚Äîbut I think one could certainly argue that our inability to win the war precluded us from improving the situation, and in fact made the Vietnamese people‚Äôs current plight possible.
@Rose58582386 @realDonaldTrump Hey bot! How‚Äôs the weather in St. Petersburg this time of year?
@585Conservative We‚Äôve all seen this movie before. It‚Äôs classic Trump: when something comes out portraying him in a way he doesn‚Äôt like, he makes a big show of the libel threats and the cease and desist letters, and then backs down. He tried it on the New York Times, as a matter of fact!
@rashaverak_day Approximately none.
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a little ridiculous to believe something about someone for literally no reason (except that it makes him easier for you to hate), when it‚Äôs common knowledge that what you believe is untrue, and all the evidence disproves your belief?
@585Conservative https://t.co/1uy9qgodob
@Amniot @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt think I understand. The Vietnamese government is brutal, authoritarian, and oppressive. That‚Äôs not good.
@esk5212 A scary thought.
@Zigmund_Fraud @realDonaldTrump Starving people is never good
The President of the United States is now attempting to censor a book about him and his administration. This #moron never ceases to insult American values and traditions.
@Varulven16 @realDonaldTrump They‚Äôre trying to drive a wedge between the US and Sourh Korea‚Äîand Trump is most likely dumb enough to let them.
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump Although now that you mention it, CNN has probably said it too, seeing as it‚Äôs true and all üòâ
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump Mmmm nope says reality. You can go to his church lol
@BettyIngelsby @realDonaldTrump Completely disgusting.
@s_2_th_honda Absolutely. It‚Äôs a genuine threat to the country, and as usual, Trump couldn‚Äôt care less.
#NorthKorea and #SouthKorea are holding a dialogue for the first time in years‚Äîand because of Trump‚Äôs constant strategic failures, the US doesn‚Äôt have a seat at the table. Yet another example of how @realDonaldTrump is a national security threat.
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump I see. You are aware Obama is Protestant, right?
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump You avoided the question: why do you keep called him Hussein?
@Sunstruk @realDonaldTrump Barack and Hillary are both... out of office. Lol.		Although I am curious why you call Obama by his middle name. Pretty unusual, no?
Intelligent and articulate. We need more of these kinds of people in office! https://t.co/6zyxk50laL

Thanks to the @GOP, internet companies can now gouge you for adequate service, coal companies can pollute our water sources, and the mentally ill can buy guns. But don‚Äôt worry! Some of you get a 7-year tax cut to finance permanent tax cuts for the 1%. üôÉüò° #VoteThemOut

@TheJimiThing_1 Lol and how did you arrive at that number?		Dream on haha. If only silencing reality were so easy!
@KZ40_alpha @MittRomney @OrrinHatch 1. Not barking	2. Yes, there are‚Äîbut I was thinking about a potential Romney win when I tweeted that, not about a much preferable @JennyWilsonUT win. It‚Äôs okay to think.
@Barbistall @MittRomney @OrrinHatch I agree with most of what you said‚Äîbut having dinner with Trump doesn‚Äôt make you as bad as Orrin Hatch.
@isthe_Sun @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Long story short: @JennyWilsonUT would be an infinitely better senator than any of them!
@isthe_Sun @MittRomney @OrrinHatch My hope/inclination is yes, but of course I can‚Äôt know for sure. I am also unspeakably disappointed in the three senators you named for their votes on the tax bill (and I‚Äôm sure Romney would have voted with them)
@shrum_dave @ritamary6 @MittRomney @OrrinHatch (Neither would I.)
@shrum_dave @ritamary6 @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Undoubtedly true‚Äîand yet he would still be many times better than most of the rest of those who voted for it
@billammo @MittRomney @OrrinHatch That we do. Best of luck, @JennyWilsonUT! We‚Äôre here to help you and the people of Utah!
@fusedmortal @MittRomney @OrrinHatch No.
@isthe_Sun @MittRomney @OrrinHatch I certainly do to some extent, but to me it seems more likely that he‚Äôll remain in line with the GOP establishment of the last 40 years‚Äîand that‚Äôs immensely better than what most of today‚Äôs GOP has become
@isthe_Sun @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Hahaha
@realDonaldTrump Are you fucking kidding me?
@NastyLexWoman @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Amen to that!
Donald Trump‚Äôs idea of deal-making appears to be threats, extortion, and insults. It‚Äôs no wonder so many of his ventures fail! https://t.co/4r0PsZM4sJ
@ritamary6 @shrum_dave @MittRomney @OrrinHatch I also think Romney as Secretary of State would have been by far and away the most professional and trustworthy member of the Trump administration, so I don‚Äôt fault him for trying
@ritamary6 @shrum_dave @MittRomney @OrrinHatch I do, but I also remember how he called Trump out for being the fraud he is during the election. That counts too, and I try to take all evidence into account. I trust Romney‚Äôs character, if not his policies
@lilzboyzz @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Sad but oh so very true...
@Bfragrancefree Hey, I‚Äôd take @JennyWilsonUT over @MittRomney any day!!
@kitty4hawks @MittRomney @OrrinHatch Let‚Äôs do it! @JennyWilsonUT
@MattEIce913 @MittRomney @OrrinHatch @JennyWilsonUT Could not agree more!
@HenryIsOurDog @MittRomney @OrrinHatch A Democrat would be fantastic‚Äîboth for Utah and for the country as a whole!
While I don‚Äôt agree with all of his ideas, @MittRomney would represent a much-needed injection of decency into the Senate‚Äôs Republican caucus, and a vast improvement over the vindictive career of @OrrinHatch.
Republican @FrancisRooney is now calling for a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù of #FBI and #DOJ employees insufficiently loyal to #Trump‚Äîa startling new offensive against law and order in our country.
It‚Äôs sad that in the face of popular unrest stemming from repression and corruption, all the dictator of Iran can bring himself to do is blame the situation on ‚Äúenemies.‚Äù Good luck to the Iranian people in enacting the changes they deserve. #IranianProtests

@Chrysler300Jack @ElcStarGarden But you can‚Äôt both pay less taxes, because somebody has to pay for the country you live in. Small detail. So, that said, who should be paying less? You who‚Äôs already struggling, or the rich guy who could pay more taxes without feeling a pinch?
@Chrysler300Jack @ElcStarGarden Unfair taxes* are not a burden to the rich like they are to yourself. There‚Äôs no reason you should struggle pay taxes while others don‚Äôt even notice. Your taxes should be lower and theirs should be somewhat higher. Neither of you should struggle to pay taxes.
@MichelleAdamov Thank you! üòÉ
@Chrysler300Jack @ElcStarGarden A well-reasoned counterargument.
@allabouttrump @Jeremy4Trump14 @USAisWinning I take it your love doesn‚Äôt extend to those with views different than your own
@Chrysler300Jack @ElcStarGarden No. They are morally obligated to feel the same burden as everyone else.
The fact that 0% of Democrats and 95% of Republicans in Congress voted for the #GOPTaxScam is a sign of how broken our democracy has become. Bills deeply affecting the entire country MUST be passed on a bipartisan basis.
@JohnOwe03918653 Sadly, absolutely.
@wakey1160 @realDonaldTrump Probably not the best approach to take towards your fellow Americans. Many of them need help more than you or I, even if they‚Äôre happy with their vote.

#AnotherTrumpLie: @realDonaldTrump promised to bring back thousands of steel jobs, but his backwards economic policies are leading to layoffs instead. When will he admit he‚Äôs wrong and stop hurting American workers??

The #GOPTaxScam illustrates the difference between #Democrats and #Republicans: Democrats want to put money directly in the hands of the middle class. Republicans want to put it in the hands of the rich, and tell us it will eventually make its way down (spoiler alert: it won‚Äôt).

@Desertpuma @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt let them fool you. Those corporate cuts (including ones allowing wealthy to use corporate tax rate) are permanent, but for the rest of us, cuts phase out in 2025, when we‚Äôll be paying more than we are now! #GOPTaxScam
@NatashaAForte I‚Äôve long thought that step 1 is to say that deficits must shrink every budget from hereon out (even if only by $1), step 2 is to set a binding plan to reach a surplus, and step 3 is a balanced budget amendment. Exceptions to all 3 for emergencies like war, recession, or disaster

Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for the worst Christmas gift ever: tax hikes on the working class and $1,500,000,000,000 in debt. #VoteThemOut #GOPTaxScam
Steel imports in 2017 (Trump) are almost 20% higher than they were in 2016 (Obama). As a result, US steelworkers are being laid off, all because of Trump‚Äôs moronic economic threats and his refusal to invest in American infrastructure!
Trump‚Äôs annual SAVINGS under the corrupt #GOP #TaxScamBill could be $11,000,000‚Äîmore money than most Americans will make working in a LIFETIME. #DrainTheSwamp
@585Conservative A tiny, temporary tax cut for middle class workers like me isn‚Äôt going to fool me. People are a little smarter than the #GOPTaxScam accounts for; we know our taxes will shoot up when our cuts phase out, while the wealthy will keep raking it in.
@realDonaldTrump #AnotherTrumpLie. For those in the middle class who are lucky enough to get a tax break (about 75%), the cuts are temporary. As soon as they expire, they‚Äôll be paying more in taxes than ever before. #GOPTaxBillScam
Republicans are celebrating their big ‚Äúwin:‚Äù tax cuts for the 1%, tax hikes on workers, and stripping healthcare from millions. To quote the president: #Sad.
@NelsonForTruth Tell me how it‚Äôs possible that tax cuts don‚Äôt add to the debt. Then read about the effects of the bill, especially past 2027
After a year in total control, Republicans in Washington have accomplished exactly one thing: a debt-funded tax cut for the wealthy that further empowers their own corruption. The American people will not forget this. #VoteThemOut #DrainTheSwamp #BlueWave #2018
@arrogantz I‚Äôm so sorry üòî
95% of Republicans in Congress voted to raise taxes on working Americans in order to cut taxes for the rich. On the bright side, a grand total of 0 Democrats voted for the #GOPTaxScam. I couldn‚Äôt be more proud of my representatives and my party! #VoteBlue
And by the way, 30% of Puerto Rico still has no power. I know the #GOPTaxScam is awful, but don‚Äôt let @realDonaldTrump distract you from his litany of other failures. #2018
@Dean_Simmonds_9 @1402News That‚Äôs kind of hilarious though
üö® #FakeNews Alert: üö® Trump is now beginning to claim that by ending the individual mandate (and in the process taking health insurance from millions), he has repealed all of ObamaCare. #AnotherTrumpLie https://t.co/xKj8plHZvC
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr But still at the rate of one per year, I hope, given that your idea of victory is wringing out the middle class and lining your own pockets. #StopGOPTaxScam
The corruption and contempt for voters displayed by Republicans in Congress is nothing short of stunning. True Republicans of the past would not recognize these people. #StopGOPTaxScam #VoteThemOut #BlueWave2018
@dnj732 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump THANK YOU
@DonnaMauro @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I have a strong feeling God would forgive you for that. Very strong.
@AnniemharrisAnn The irony of your graphic is next-level.
What are the odds that, once he realizes working Americans are mad as hell their taxes are being raised and their health insurance stolen to finance tax cuts for the donor class, @realDonaldTrump tries to blame the #GOPTaxScam on @BarackObama? I‚Äôm thinking very good.
@PeterGilkes1 And rightly so!

Poor choice of argument; if @BarackObama had truly accomplished nothing, @realDonaldTrump wouldn‚Äôt be president right now, and Trump supporters wouldn‚Äôt be nearly so angry. https://t.co/6PWdXc0fwC

@PeterGilkes1 Wrong; I‚Äôm referring to colonization. Are you familiar?
@LauraShick8 @dnj732 I struggle with this. On one hand I totally see the benefit‚Äîon the other hand, term limits seems slightly undemocratic. Perhaps the benefits outweigh that fact?
@herewegokids7 Clearly.
@tullyframe @GOP It kinda seems like you know this bill is crooked as all get out, so when people point that fact out, all you have left is bigoted insults.
@paul1994loan Wishful thinking, I‚Äôm afraid.
And here we see the most corrupt president in the history of the United States, congratulating Congressional Republicans on passing the most corrupt tax scam in the history of the United States. Remember this in 2018. #VoteThemOut #BlueWave #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/9hPHXjEejW
@PeterGilkes1 Hahaha I‚Äôm sorry, but aren‚Äôt you... British?
@paul1994loan They‚Äôre next to vote on it
@herewegokids7 That‚Äôs an amazing trick for writing off all of reality‚Äîbut, to quote Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, ‚Äúthe beautiful thing about science is that it‚Äôs true whether you believe it or not.‚Äù Sorry for bursting your bubble!
@herewegokids7 What‚Äôs ‚Äúwinning‚Äù about this?
@herewegokids7 You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôve been reading about the impacts of the bill all day, and you still believe ‚Äúnobody‚Äù will be adversely affected by it?
@herewegokids7 Read about the impacts of the bill, ma‚Äôam.
And there you have it, folks: the House of Representatives passes the #GOPTaxScam that will cut taxes for the rich at the mere cost of raising taxes on workers, taking health insurance from the poor, and adding $1 trillion to the #deficit. #VoteThemOut!
@herewegokids7 Sounds like you think you stand to benefit. If so, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre doing well, but what about the millions of others who will be set back immensely? Do they matter?
@PeterGilkes1 Ah, yes, the classic ‚Äútwo wrongs make a right argument‚Äù‚Äîor is it just apathy? Either way, it‚Äôs a poor approach to the world.
The #TaxBill under debate right now will be a devastating blow to millions of middle class households, but Republicans in Congress are celebrating‚Äîthey‚Äôre about to give themselves and their donors a huge tax cut! #GOPTaxScam
@PeterGilkes1 Suffice it to say that China does not act as a force for good in the world.
Ironic: Obama talked about China as a partner, but his actions show he saw China for what it really is. Trump publicly screamed that China is ‚Äúraping‚Äù the US, but never misses a chance to cede global leadership and influence to them. #Hypocrite #SoCalledPresident #Moron
@InsecureDonald Hahaha thank you! But mine‚Äôs grey so I can‚Äôt quite join that club yet :/
Senator @BobCorker is a no on the tax bill because it explodes the deficit. The bill doesn‚Äôt get any cheaper, but a provision is quietly inserted benefiting companies he has stake in. Suddenly he‚Äôs a yes. Isn‚Äôt that, like, the definition of #corruption? #CorkerKickBack
@Dean_Simmonds_9 @GOP Question is: if he did, would he care? Definitely up for debate, based on his words and actions.
@Dean_Simmonds_9 @GOP I am quite sure he doesn‚Äôt.
@1960weave In a way, it‚Äôs almost scarier if it‚Äôs not a commandment, but rather a survival tactic to continue their science and secure funding from politicians who see science as a threat.
CDC officials say they had to avoid using phrases like ‚Äúscience-based‚Äù in order to increase their budget‚Äôs chances of approval by Republicans in Congress‚Äîin other words, the #AntiScience stance of the @GOP is officially impacting public safety.
As you read this, Republicans in Washington are scrambling to pass their #TaxBill before its details and impacts come to light. Most of them haven‚Äôt read it, but they know it‚Äôs a transfer of wealth from the everyday Americans to the 1%, and that‚Äôs what their donors demand.
Meanwhile @realdonaldtrump continues to:	1. Pour millions into Saudi Arabia‚Äôs war in Yemen	2. Pursue reckless budget cuts to the infrastructure and services Americans rely on https://t.co/0SGPdCuZ1k
Between the GOP #TaxBill and the loss of #NetNeutrality, this past week has made it alarmingly clear that Republicans in Congress serve no one but their donors. Good news, America‚Äîthere‚Äôs still one thing you can do: #VoteThemOut!
@Pm1Pierre Isn‚Äôt it scary??
@helianthus77 I based it off my understanding of the points made by reasonable people on both sides of the aisle. I avoided issues with no legitimate other side and arguments that have no merit, like ‚Äútransgender people shouldn‚Äôt have rights‚Äù and ‚Äúclimate change is a hoax.‚Äù
I gotta be honest with you: some days, it‚Äôs hard not to feel like @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP are just making a punching bag out of the American people. üòîüá∫üá∏#TaxBill
The @GOP #TaxBill is nothing short of an attack on every wage earner in this country. It rewards the investor class and penalizes wage earners. How is that acceptable?
Question: if they were really trying to spread #FakeNews, wouldn‚Äôt they insist they‚Äôre right even when proven wrong‚Äîkind of like, you know, @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/6XTb8eQGRr
Under the @GOP #TaxBill, wages‚Äîyou know, the money everyday Americans make for working their asses off‚Äîwill be the HIGHEST TAXED type of income. That is so wrong.

@AEGray313 @MimiLeroch Wait, I‚Äôve heard of the Cold War‚Äîcapitalism vs. communism, but which side were we on, because whenever I hear anyone propose investing in infrastructure or education or just about anything else, Republicans call them a communist!
@KenSimonSays @Stephlnix @Projectvj1 They didn‚Äôt have the internet to look up answers in WWII :/
@Marinapurenkool @GOP Some will see their taxes go up immediately. Others will see a temporary tax cut (long enough, the GOP hopes, to get them to vote Republican in 2020) only for those tax cuts to disappear and their taxes increase dramatically.
My dad just told me that when he was a kid, the Republicans were the party that was tough on Russia. Huh. ü§î #TrumpRussia

@maddpig Sad but true
Alabama, regardless of what you think of the allegations for Roy Moore, remember this: a vote for Roy Moore is a vote for raising taxes on Americans who work for a living, and then we‚Äôre all screwed. #VoteDougJones #NoMoore
Sending Roy Moore to the Senate would guarantee a vote for the @GOP #TaxBill that will penalize everyday Americans while rewarding political donors. #VoteDougJones

@585Conservative The changes necessary to truly realize equality and mutual respect for all our fellow Americans can only come from inside us. I felt Obama was good at using his position as a leader to guide us in that direction.
@585Conservative I know you‚Äôre not alone with that feeling, but it‚Äôs hard for me to understand, because it‚Äôs basically the opposite of the feeling I got. To me, the idea that government policies can significantly change how Americans see one another is crazy, and I have a hunch Obama would agree.
@585Conservative You don‚Äôt believe Obama wanted black and white Americans to coexist peacefully and equally?
@585Conservative Did you notice that one of the parties was much more emphatic than the other in denouncing the views of the white supremacists in Charlottesville?
@585Conservative I‚Äôm curious: do you imagine the KKK members that showed up in Charlottesville vote Democratic? What about the neo-Nazis? What about the other factions of white supremacists there?
@585Conservative The VAST majority of people who consider themselves Democrats want everyone in this country to coexist peacefully and enjoy equality, and I‚Äôm sure the same goes for Republicans. That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see me labeling the GOP party of the KKK despite their questionable affiliations
Translation: Doug Jones can balance right to life &amp; right to choose, tough on crime even when committed by elites, won‚Äôt waste your money, supports public safety, and again won‚Äôt waste your money. Roy Moore would be a Trump puppet. #VoteDougJones https://t.co/bZsjzcwpmp
@585Conservative I assume when you say ‚Äúit‚Äôs the truth‚Äù you‚Äôre speaking in a historical sense and willfully ignoring the total absurdity of the statement with respect to today‚Äôs America, because I know you‚Äôre perceptive enough to see that today‚Äôs Democratic Party reviles the KKK.

@twighlight3000 Yes it is.
Alabama has a choice between the man who convicted the perpetrators of the Birmingham church bombing and an accused child molestor who was removed from office as a judge twice. As moral choices go, it doesn‚Äôt get any more clear cut.
If @realDonaldTrump were actually tough on crime, he‚Äôd support the prosecutor who convicted the KKK terrorists of the Birmingham church bombing over the accused child molestor‚Äîbut he‚Äôs not. It was just another #TrumpLie. #DrainTheSwamp #LawAndOrder
No thanks. üòâüá∫üá∏ https://t.co/YYr1GkY1hE
@DustinCahoon84 @Pissyfits @585Conservative @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor According to Fox News, she wrote the date and location under the inscription. Is that what you‚Äôre talking about?
The #Kremlin is considering making all foreign news outlets register as foreign agents. I say, do it: show the world how autocrats like Putin cower before the truth. #Russia #FreePress
The amount of energy the far-right expends campaigning for an alleged child molestor is truly breathtaking. What happened to family values?? #NoMoore #GrandOldPedophiles https://t.co/rlM9MmTAWZ
Proud to see a small measure of justice for Walter Scott. Cops who needlessly shoot unarmed civilians are not worthy of the ranks of our esteemed law enforcement officers.
The @GOP #TaxScam makes perfectly clear that Republicans in Congress are serving only one constituency: their donors. It‚Äôs time to remind them who they really work for. #VoteThemOut
We need #TaxReform that brings relief to the middle class, instead of continuing to line donors‚Äô pockets at the expense of working Americans.
You know @realDonaldTrump is nervous when... https://t.co/eBnHdGo38t
@Bagehot99 Yes‚Äîwhich is why I expect no justice for the women. One of the sad realities of our society
I love when Kremlin-funded twitter accounts call me a communist because that‚Äôs how they think Americans still talk. #TrumpRussia
@suiteplat @FallonFalsmr95 That is just sick.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Most 14 year olds are more emotional than reasonable...
@marms88 It‚Äôs never enough for these greedy bastards. Pretty sure Trump has literally stated that his dream is to become the richest person in the world, and yet people still pull the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs immune to corruption because he‚Äôs already rich‚Äù shtick...
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Uh... you're gonna have to explain to me how the outcome of Tuesday's election dictates what happened in the past.
@Bagehot99 We can‚Äôt know for certain, that‚Äôs true‚Äîbut we can make an informed assessment based on what we do know. In this case we know 9 unconnected women say they were molested and others remember him as a creep, and we know he says he‚Äôs innocent.
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor üëçüèº
@Bagehot99 Dismissed like never happened, or dismissed like you don‚Äôt care?
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Define condemn. All I think is it‚Äôs pretty clear here who is likely telling the truth and who is likely lying, and I think any reasonable person would come to the same conclusion.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @Pissyfits @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Like I said, I understand that she‚Äôs trying to bring the issue before Congress. That doesn‚Äôt make anything bunk. I also said I agree she should just release it now.
@Bagehot99 Hence the lack of criminal case. The yearbook is in all likelihood authentic, but you can‚Äôt convict someone of molestation because they signed a yearbook.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @Pissyfits @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor You can drop the snark man. Not necessary.
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor What, you think when he wins I‚Äôm gonna suddenly be chanting ‚Äúlock him up?‚Äù
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor No, we convict people in courts. Everyone had opinions about just about everything; that doesn‚Äôt make them courts. All I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôd keep my daughters far away from Moore.		And I assume I don‚Äôt have to tell you that, no, we shouldn‚Äôt bring back lynchings.
@585Conservative @Pissyfits @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor But saying things like ‚ÄúDemocrats don‚Äôt believe in due process‚Äù is a ridiculous generalization to make about half of this nation, and a disservice to our country.
@585Conservative @Pissyfits @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Based on the information I have I believe Moore molested them (as I think any reasonable person would), but since I can‚Äôt know for certain, I will only call him an alleged molestor from hereon out.
@585Conservative @Pissyfits @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor The ‚Äúdue process‚Äù thing is ridiculous because I am not a court. Let‚Äôs be reasonable here. People form opinions based on what they know. I will, however, agree that because I didn‚Äôt see it happen and no trial is possible, I don‚Äôt know for certain if it happened or not.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Right, at 9+ against 1. In my view that means no legal conviction, but ample evidence for the public to figure out who is most likely lying.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Could be. Could also have been recognition of Moore‚Äôs name in connection with his antics in and removals from office, leading them to opt for the non-Moore candidate
@DustinCahoon84 No dude, because your forged proof is ridiculous on its face; there is zero connection between myself and your grandma, whereas there are ample connections between Moore and these women. Again, false analogy
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor I strongly disagree with you there‚Äîprobably because I don‚Äôt think these allegations are a fabricated political hitjob.
@DustinCahoon84 But wouldn‚Äôt you agree that words of 9 unconnected women plus random locals who remember him as a creep is more compelling than the denials of the accused?
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor How does one bring such a suit? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs evidence, right? What would they have to do‚Äîdig up the car Moore was driving 40 years ago and search if for their hair? That‚Äôs the fundamental problem here. We have nothing to go on but the public info
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Seems unlikely that that‚Äôs actually the case, unless 45% of AL Republican voters live in Montgomery. But that‚Äôs not important anyways
@DustinCahoon84 Of course I am. Anything is possible. But with that said, you also have to assess what is realistic/logical/likely. And pro tip: that‚Äôs usually not the latest conspiracy theory.
@DustinCahoon84 No, because your grandmother and I have never met each other. Not an accurate analogy.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Yes indeed. But what I‚Äôm saying is, if Moore did molest them, they have ample reason not to like him, and to want to hurt him politically.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Good point. I forgot about those. So I‚Äôd say the theory that they didn‚Äôt know he was still around is unlikely, and it‚Äôs more likely that they were just biding their time. But again, that doesn‚Äôt make it any less true
@Pissyfits @DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor That‚Äôs kind of a ridiculous thing to say, don‚Äôt you think?
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor ...a Republican wins this race, because we all know the Republican will (again, it‚Äôs Alabama). To us, it‚Äôs about WHICH Republican. We find it obscene that in a state with so many perfectly eligible Republicans, the nominee would be someone credibly accused of molesting children.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor 4. I don‚Äôt think anyone honestly believes Jones has a shot at winning in Alabama. I can‚Äôt speak for the whole country, but I‚Äôm surrounded by liberals, and they talk politics. Nobody I‚Äôve spoken to about it thinks Jones has any chance. To us, its not about whether a Democrat or...
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor 3. Please show me the article where the manager said he was never banned. I have read that people who lived in the town at the time recall that he was banned from both the Gadsden Mall and the local YMCA.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor 2. Yes, and while I understand her goal of using the yearbook as leverage to force a congressional hearing, I agree with you that she should just release it now. I don‚Äôt doubt it‚Äôs authenticity, but if she doesn‚Äôt release it within 3 months of the election, I might reconsider.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor To me, those are two very plausible explanations for the timing. One is malicious and the other is benign, but neither of them have any bearing on whether or not the molestations actually happened.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor ...don‚Äôt follow local or state politics. It wouldn‚Äôt shock me if they didn‚Äôt even know Moore was still in politics until his Senate bid gained national attention, and now that they‚Äôre adults, they decided to speak out about their past experiences with him.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Don‚Äôt worry, I read it nice and slow. My thoughts:		1. Yes they did, and I see 2 possible reasons: 1) they want to end his Senate dreams. They hate Moore for molesting them, but wouldn‚Äôt you too? Biding their time is low, but it doesn‚Äôt make the past less true; 2) Most people...
@Charles37780621 Based on the information publicly available, there is far more reason to believe the women than there is not to.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Frankly, given the totality of the information publicly available, it‚Äôs more logical to believe the women than not to. Illogical would be to assume that they‚Äôre part of a grand conspiracy for virtually no reason except political convenience.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor McConnell does suck, but Senate rules are Senate rules, right?
@ES03784893 https://t.co/EhJW5rQRs2
@585Conservative Lol I think the point is understood but thanks
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor And even that is a far cry from his original implied threat to expel Moore
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor No fallacies here, my friend
@ES03784893 Americans for Prosperity is recruiting local high school kids to try and convince people the #TaxScam helps them.
@DustinCahoon84 @585Conservative @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor That sounds messed up
Mitch McConnel said he wanted #TaxReform that was ‚Äúrevenue-neutral.‚Äù Turns out he‚Äôs perfectly happy to pass a #TaxScam that costs $1.5 trillion and simply CALL it revenue-neutral! #GOPlies
Tough news: in this country, you‚Äôre only punished if you commit a crime. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/C3cHomGhJd
The Koch brothers are literally sending canvassers through American neighborhoods to tell voters they should be happy their taxes are going up to fund massive tax cuts for‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe Koch brothers. #Corruption
@585Conservative Whereas liberals like me would prefer we don‚Äôt have Americans being crippled for life by healthcare costs.
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor What I don‚Äôt get is why the AL GOP didn‚Äôt just swap Moore out with a better candidate. ANY Republican can win in Alabama‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt have to pick a child molestor!
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor I mean they could, but it‚Äôs kind of crazy story to go with just because the reality is damaging to your candidate haha
@585Conservative @DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Oh, don‚Äôt worry. McConnel is enough of a rabid partisan that if Moore made it to the Senate, I bet Mitch wouldn‚Äôt lift a finger.
Here‚Äôs a simple truth: the president‚Äôs job is to enforce the law. If he pressures the FBI to stop investigating a crime he knows was committed, that‚Äôs #ObstructionOfJustice. #TrumpRussia
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor I wouldn‚Äôt expect anyone to go as far as believing them if it were 1, or even 2... but 9?? If you don‚Äôt see a pattern there, it‚Äôs probably because you don‚Äôt want to see it
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument that Bill Clinton is guilty of everything everyone has ever accused him of. Does that excuse Roy Moore?
@TweetsByDewey I wish them the best!
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor I get your point dude. But my point is that just because you can imagine a situation like that doesn‚Äôt mean Moore‚Äôs 9 unrelated accusers are part of some grand conspiracy
@585Conservative Uh... if health insurance companies are at risk of going belly-up, it‚Äôs primarily because Trump cut off their subsidies, effectively taking them hostage in his bizarre war on Obamacare.
The Republican plan to slowly choke off #Obamacare by increasing premiums is not only dishonest, it‚Äôs a vicious attack on the American people and their #healthcare.
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Sure, but none of them are accusing me (or anyone else who‚Äôs ever ‚Äúangered‚Äù them) of molesting them...
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Send me the article where you saw that
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor It would still be obvious, because unlike Roy Moore, my accuser would be someone I‚Äôve never met, not someone I ‚Äúdated‚Äù or molested when they were a teenager. Get it?
@Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP Hahahaha let me get this straight. Because I don‚Äôt think a child molestor should be in the Senate, I hate America??
@HynesStephen @Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP Here are the first 8 lol. Pretty sure at least one more has come forward since this was published 11/17: https://t.co/R0rtEKW5nB
@HynesStephen @Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP Lol damn! Must be easy to ‚Äúwin‚Äù arguments when you can change the facts at will!
@DustinCahoon84 @nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor If someone were to accuse me of being a predator it would be demonstrably false, because I wouldn‚Äôt know them. Someone I do know wouldn‚Äôt accuse me because I‚Äôm not a predator. Roy Moore, on the other hand... get it?
@CatieSienna @slindsey09 @GOP I see, you‚Äôre just gonna completely dodge the issue and instead make baseless attacks on half the country. Makes sense
@HynesStephen @Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP Why exactly are you ruling out the other 6-7? So what if it came out now. Timing and veracity are not related
@HynesStephen @Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP Facts always matter, my friend. And the fact here is that 9 unconnected women all say they had similarly disturbing experiences with Moore. Their stories match the recollections of locals who lived near him, including that he was banned from the local mall. That‚Äôs credible
@HynesStephen @Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP I posit that your statement is clearly ridiculous on its face because you have no idea who I even am.
@nw_anna @Pissyfits @585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Damn haha the Trumplings are eating this propaganda up!
@JaredBeck @nw_anna @CharlesOrtel If you stopped and thought for a second you might realize you just equated thing to orchestrate a smear campaign with running an investigation lol
@585Conservative @RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor So the timing doesn‚Äôt make me skeptical at all. Who would wanna see their molestor in the Senate?? As for the allegations themselves, like I said, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily believe it is it was just one... but 9, plus the locals‚Äô stories? That‚Äôs a pattern.
@585Conservative @RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Dude that‚Äôs not fair. You have to divorce the motive of the timing from the veracity of the allegations. I don‚Äôt have any doubt that the timing was because they want Moore to lose‚Äîif someone had molested you when you were a kid, wouldn‚Äôt you hate them?
When the Senate passed the $787B stimulus package to save our economy in 2009, @senatemajldr decried it as ‚Äúone of the most expensive votes in history.‚Äù Now he‚Äôs thrilled about his $1.5T tax cut for the rich?! #Hypocrite
@585Conservative @RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor We‚Äôre not talking about one bitter woman whose dog Moore ran over seeking revenge. We‚Äôre talking about 9 unconnected women telling of behavior corroborated by the locals who lived near Moore all his life. If you don‚Äôt consider that credible, it might be because you don‚Äôt want to.
@585Conservative @RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Kind of applies to the larger sexual assault debate. Sure, you can‚Äôt legally convict someone without evidence‚Äîbut as for the ‚Äúcourt‚Äù of public opinion, it doesn‚Äôt take irrefutable evidence to get a pretty decent idea of what went down.
@585Conservative @RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor We can agree that there‚Äôs probably almost never evidence of molestation, right? I mean, what would that evidence even consist of? So do you think allegations of child molestation should just never be taken seriously?
@Pissyfits @Trishster @GOP If you want to ever want to be taken seriously .. learn how to have conversation, minus the snark and memes
@slindsey09 @CatieSienna @GOP Lol right, because only by living ‚Äúsomewhere in the south‚Äù can you have access to counter-arguments...
@norvilgirl @realDonaldTrump @MooreSenate This is true. But then again, when there are 9 separate accusers and locals remember him as the creep who was banned from the mall, it‚Äôs not exactly hard to know if he‚Äôs worthy of your support.
@RUArebel2 @StewartHansen3 @585Conservative @Trader_Moe @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor That doesn‚Äôt mean the Senate can‚Äôt convene a hearing...?
United States President endorses accused child molestor for US Senate race. Holy cow. @realdonaldtrump @mooresenate #NoMoore #GrandOldPedophiles
I think I get it: when Obama signs bipartisan legislation bringing healthcare to poor, it‚Äôs a gross abuse of power. When Trump fires the FBI director to obstruct an investigation, it‚Äôs ‚Äúusing his executive authority.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs a video of now-convicted felon Michael Flynn leading the crowd in fevered chants of ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù at the 2016 RNC. #Irony #Justice	https://t.co/2HLXsPczC4 via @YouTube
@TheColorArmy Lol what are you talking about
@hiranger223 @RanyhynMyrha @GOP Define disappear
@CatieSienna @slindsey09 @GOP In the meantime I‚Äôll rely on what‚Äôs obvious to anyone with any semblance of morals: you don‚Äôt support a man who‚Äôs probably a pedophile for Senate.
The problem with Republicans in Congress is they want to slash taxes while raising defense spending and then complain about the national debt. #Hypocrites
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor Pick your favorite and go. I‚Äôll read it later lol. I‚Äôm working
@Pissyfits @GOP Not yet :)
@MaryBal57650553 *when you write someone off because of where they live* #bigot
@n129bz @PoINews2 @GOP Hahahahaha I‚Äôm gonna stop you right there. You‚Äôre telling me you think anyone who is disgusted by a pedophile must be a pedophile??
@slindsey09 @PoINews2 @GOP I‚Äôm not a court, buddy
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor That‚Äôs for sure haha
@Shady_Senator @GOP ‚ÄúBaseless‚Äù would imply he hasn‚Äôt been accused my multiple unconnected women or banned from the local mall lol
@slindsey09 @GOP Hopefully soon! :)
@trumps_all @GOP Except nobody does, and for all I know, you don‚Äôt even have kids. Get it?
@ThomasWictor Lol what?
@Dryblizzard Interesting that it never seems to happen that way lol. Also interesting: these giveaways aren‚Äôt for ‚Äúconsumers,‚Äù they‚Äôre for the 1%
@sampson_elaine Haha thanks
@daddyrabbitofLA @sirteampossible What I‚Äôm saying is it was already open for recreational use as a monument. That‚Äôs what a national monument is: preserved land for the public to enjoy
@jones_sarabeth @InvisiblePinkNP @GOP Kind of irrelevant whether it‚Äôs $4M or $7M; it‚Äôs a tiny amount of money very well spent! #TrumpRussia
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor 2. I am a person, not a court. I formed my opinion of Moore based off the information I have. My opinion of him is not a conviction, it‚Äôs just a reflection of common sense.
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor And before you start, Id like you to consider 2 things:	1. How many of the ridiculous conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton, totally unsubstantiated despite years of investigations, so you believe?
Trump wants everyone to know the #TrumpRussia investigation has cost $7M so far, but I‚Äôm confident that‚Äôs not a problem‚Äîafter all, the @GOP just passed a $1,500,000,000,000 tax cut for the rich, and they‚Äôre all about ‚Äúfiscal responsibility.‚Äù We must be running a huge surplus! üôÑ
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate As for Moore: it‚Äôs clear to me that the accusations against him are credible. Given his background (banned from the mall‚Äîneed I say more?) and the number/diversity of the accusers, there‚Äôs no reasonable doubt that molested these girls. And THAT, my friend, is disgusting.
@585Conservative @GOP @MooreSenate Lol Jesus! ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre DISGUSTING?‚Äù Harsh haha. As for the no reply: I didn‚Äôt see this. I get lots of notifications. If you tweet at me in the middle of the night, your notification will be buried by the time I wake up.
Decades of experience have showed us that #TrickleDown economics doesn‚Äôt work, so why do Congressional Republicans keep trying? Here‚Äôs a better idea: why don‚Äôt we put the middle class first and give #TrickleUp a try?
@sirteampossible Hahahaha that‚Äôs a good trick! If you can‚Äôt beat someone‚Äôs argument, change their argument for them! üòÇ
@daddyrabbitofLA @sirteampossible Until there‚Äôs a spill. Look, I‚Äôm all for responsible resource extraction, because we need resources obviously. But it doesn‚Äôt have to happen everywhere right now, you know? I say don‚Äôt extract from protected lands unless there‚Äôs some kind of severe shortage
@daddyrabbitofLA @sirteampossible You know they‚Äôre already open for recreation, right? That‚Äôs why they were made monuments‚Äîto protect them for recreational use.
On one side of history you have Mueller removing a potentially biased agent from his investigation and ABC news suspending a reporter for making a mistake. On the other, you have Trump tweeting a new lie once an hour. #TruthMatters #TrumpRussia
@PoINews2 @GOP Even if he‚Äôs a pedophile, huh? You‚Äôre sick.
@sirteampossible @daddyrabbitofLA You‚Äôre calling me a hypocrite as if I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use anything that comes from logging, mining, or drilling‚Äù lol. Settle down dude. Take a breath. Think a little
@RanyhynMyrha @GOP Honestly, as dumb as it sounds, yes, I‚Äôm still surprised. I think I just can‚Äôt keep up with how rapidly their depravity grows
@Trishster @GOP You‚Äôre far from alone üòî
@jones_sarabeth @GOP @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs a confessed predator, but where did you get the idea that Trump raped a 13 year old?
This is unbelievable. The president of the United States endorsed a child molestor for Senate, so naturally, the entire @gop endorses that child molestor for Senate too. #GrandOldPedophiles #NoMoore
@KBenkjn @heartofmel What are you talking about lol
@shearer412 Absolutely. Probably sitting at the internet research agency in St. Petersburg running 15 different fake twitter accounts.
The only deep state here is a deep state of delusion. Look out for this Kremlin-paid #TrumpRussia troll, Twitter. #FactsMatter https://t.co/NVgDq9j2po
@RandyHarris43 @RevFrBobHutchis Lol
@JoMills21888279 Right?? It‚Äôs the least they could do lol. The very least.
@daddyrabbitofLA That was why Obama made it a monument: so people could enjoy the land! All Trump did today is open most of it up to logging, mining, and drilling. See how enjoyable it is then...
@c_hispanic ‚ÄúSo he can further control Americans?‚Äù What, like, just for fun? Hahaha
@PoINews2 Then why do you keep calling them obstructionists? Lol
@heartofmel @KBenkjn He just slashed the size of two national monuments today. Probably any news outlet
@PoINews2 Lol. Explain to me what point you think you‚Äôre making, because nobody got kicked out of Bears Ears to make room for homeless people.
@snowdove133 @pattylee616 Ma‚Äôam, ‚Äúthe left‚Äù hasn‚Äôt treated him anything. People just react negatively to things they find offensive or unfair. If you cite some specific examples I‚Äôm happy to talk about them with you
@PoINews2 Irrelevant statement to the tweet you quoted; typical work of a #RussianBot. #TrumpRussia
@braden_rose I would guess that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs going to happen.
@PoINews2 Hahaha
@Het32000 I didn‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt.
@jjmartini21 @SuezWillson Vote your heart indeed, but if your heart leads you to vote for the party of Trump,	I have some questions for you.
@KBenkjn You got one part of that tweet right!
@Bagehot99 By taking it FROM the American people and delivering it straight to special interests? Lol
@snowdove133 @pattylee616 ‚ÄúAccusations‚Äù about drilling?
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs called JUSTICE, LAW, &amp; ORDER üá∫üá∏
@realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs scary when people start to find out the truth, ain‚Äôt it? #TrumpRussia
@realDonaldTrump #LittleDonnie‚Äôs nicknames just keep getting weirder and weirder üòÇ
@pattylee616 @snowdove133 I‚Äôd rather not. Please let our courts protect us
@ruthbeall @realDonaldTrump Lol
@PoINews2 @CNN @POTUS I will let the proper authorities‚ÄîMueller &amp; staff‚Äîdetermine that. That‚Äôs how law and order works.
@PoINews2 @CNN @POTUS @FoxNews Its rightful owner is the United States of America and everyone in it üá∫üá∏
Donald Trump just stole two million acres of public land from the American people, so that special interests (his donors) can profit off it. There‚Äôs only one thing you can do about it: #VoteBlue. #DrainTheSwamp
I‚Äôm deeply troubled by this recurring theme of congressional #Republicans denying empirical data and rejecting hard research in the fight to advance their agenda. That‚Äôs completely backwards. #FactsMatter
Senate Republicans just passed the most corrupt #TaxBill ever‚Äîa bill most of them haven‚Äôt read. They did this because they wanted to be able to say they did *something* this year. #VoteThemAllOut #DrainTheSwamp
Sooo... @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs lawyers are now claiming the president can‚Äôt obstruct justice. Are they aware Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice? #TrumpRussia
After claiming to be the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù president, @realdonaldtrump publicly attacks the #FBI for investigating the crimes of his inner circle. Trump is the literal opposite of everything he promised!
üö®Irony alert: the Electoral College was designed to protect the country from ignorant people who couldn‚Äôt be trusted to vote responsibly. In 2016 it gave us @realdonaldtrump.
@PoINews2 @nytimes Tough news pal: counties don‚Äôt vote, people do. Votes won by Clinton: 66M (48%). Votes won by Trump: 63M (46%)
‚Äú[A Trump campaign official wrote in an internal email] ‚ÄòThe sanctions could also make it much harder for Mr. Trump to ease tensions with Russia, ‚Äòwhich has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him.‚Äô‚Äô‚Äù -@nytimes	So... is that it then? #TrumpRussia
@PoINews2 Tax reform would indeed help. This is the opposite.
Ladies and gentlemen, @senategop just passed the swampiest, most corrupt giveaway to corporations, political donors, and the 1% in our history. And you know who gets to foot the bill? US! #VoteThemOut #DrainTheSwamp
@jojonyc45 The problem is that the new administration is COMPRISED of lobbyists!
You know your electoral system is fucked up when the first female to win a presidential election is not the first female president. @hillaryclinton
@PoINews2 Let‚Äôs see it then! Or is that not possible... for... you know, reasons.
Make no mistake: the Republican #TaxScam and the corrupt senators who passed it are a threat to the United States.		#VoteThemOut #DrainTheSwamp
@wyn_a Hahaha
Let me get this straight: Trump now acknowledges he fired Flynn for committing a crime he claimed he had no knowledge of at the time, and then pressured Comey to drop the inquiry into that crime?! #TrumpRussia #ImpeachTrump https://t.co/zmEJ2XQud2
If enacted, the Republican #TaxScam will immediately be on top of the pile of things that need to be fixed about our country. #VoteThemOut #CorruptGOP
@SerenityFoods Disagree
@RedbeardRay Let‚Äôs see: when the ACA passed the Senate with 60 votes, 39% of the public approved of it, and 16% of the public approved of Congress (the passage of ACA increased public approval of Congress to 23%).	#ACA: 60, 39, 16	#TaxBill: 51, 25, 13	Arguably similar, definitely better.
The Republican #TaxScam is a bill that 25% of the country supports passed by 51% of a body that 10% of Americans approve of. That‚Äôs a pretty poor excuse for representative democracy. #VoteThemOut
@585Conservative Who‚Äôs we? The minority of Americans who will have their taxes cut by this bill? Newsflash: there are plenty of other ways in which this #TaxScam damages the country, such as a $1 trillion in new debt. That‚Äôs not winning!
@RustyOneTwo @SenateGOP That sounds like it cannot be correct.
For most Americans, the #TaxBill that @SenateGOP passed last night couldn‚Äôt really be worse. It‚Äôs not just that your taxes will increase to fund giveaways to the 1%; it undermines our healthcare, education, government, society, and more. #VoteThemOut
@585Conservative Lol. Were talking about a bill that 25% of the country supports passed by 51% of a body that 10% of Americans support. That‚Äôs a pretty poor excuse for representative democracy.‚Äù
Really glad to see #Mueller removed an FBI agent from the #TrumpRussia inquiry over possible bias. Fairness is a two-way street, and in order to be credible, this inquiry MUST be fair and nonpartisan.
@bkaputnik @CaptDocMike The Democrats also pander to their donors to some extent, but let‚Äôs be real: the typical Democratic donor and the typical Republican donor are VERY different. They have very different motives, only one of which could ever have lead to this #TaxScam.
Senate Republicans just passed a massive tax hike on most Americans with their #TaxScam that only 25% of the people support. If you feel like this isn‚Äôt democracy, you‚Äôre right: this is what corrupt politicians catering to their donors looks like. #VoteThemOut
@SenKamalaHarris @SenBillNelson Yeah obviously I mean come on what were you thinking
I‚Äôm no expert, but I‚Äôm pretty sure molesting children is not a Christian value.	#NoMoore #GrandOldPedophile https://t.co/LyhGCQz8sx
@realDonaldTrump I haven‚Äôt been able to find a single article saying you fired him. Can you point to one, or is this just another #TrumpLie?
Question: how many of Trump‚Äôs inner circle have to plead guilty to felonies before people start to realize this administration is no good? #Corruption #TrumpRussia
It‚Äôs hard to think of a worse choice for @CIA director than @TomCottonAR, an extremely partisan politician with no real experience except at undermining US interests. Putin would be proud.
Note: by ‚Äúbetter and better‚Äù he means for himself and the rest of the ultra-rich. For everyday Americans, it just gets worse and worse. #TaxScam https://t.co/D3MqciY8Vd
He said he‚Äôd ‚Äúsolve‚Äù #NorthKorea, but all @realdonaldtrump has done is tweet about it. I guess we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised the threat to the US is only growing.
If passed, the Republican #TaxBill is going straight to the top of the pile of things that will need to be fixed by the next president. It‚Äôs puts America on VERY unstable footing.
@Chrysler300Jack Fair enough haha
@Chrysler300Jack Are you also the type of person who freaks out when someone says they‚Äôre ashamed the president is from their state? Genuinely asking.
@585Conservative I assume you are aware that the victim‚Äôs family does not appreciate being used as a prop for Trump‚Äôs backwards policies, and that they‚Äôve said as much?
@585Conservative Trying to propagandize this tragedy to turn hate on illegal immigrants as a whole group‚Äîthe same way he tried to propagandize acts of violence by Muslims to paint all Muslims as violent. It‚Äôs a shitty way to behave for a normal person, and completely unacceptable from a president
This is a tragedy for our city, our state, and our country, but you try to spin it for your hateful gain. Politicians like you disgust me. https://t.co/Lw4ZmksDs7
It‚Äôs hard to blame the UK not wanting @realdonaldtrump in their country‚Äîheck, I‚Äôm American and I don‚Äôt want him in my country!
So basically what happened today is @realdonaldtrump got on a stage in Missouri and lied to everyone‚Äôs faces for an hour about the #TaxBill. Cool. #TaxScam
With his retreat from the world, @realdonaldtrump is creating space for Russia to expand its nefarious influence to US allies like Egypt, who are now closer with Russia than at any time in the last 40 years.
‚ÄúNo puppet, no puppet, you‚Äôre the puppet.‚Äù -@realDonaldTrump during a presidential debate, 2016	#TrumpRussia #Moron
To the Republican senators now under pressure from Trump to pax the GOP #TaxScam: you‚Äôve been a senator, you‚Äôve secured a giant pension‚Äîwhat do you need re-election for? Put your constituents first, and if Trump tweets about you after, feel good knowing you did the right thing.
Just so everybody knows what‚Äôs ACTUALLY happening, last year was commerical banks‚Äò most protiftable year‚Äîever. #LiarInChief https://t.co/0AYmMXVMrW
@BilliamBoltz I know they do; I used to think that too. Then I realized that if a rich person‚Äôs taxes go up by 5%, they don‚Äôt feel it. If a poor person‚Äôs taxes go up by 5%, it could easily mean skipping meals
@585Conservative @giraffeguy1962 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre right that we don‚Äôt know for certain, but decades of complaints about the same behavior seem more credible than one man‚Äôs denial, don‚Äôt they?
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump The Mongols didn‚Äôt have drones and submarines lol. The Berlin Wall was meant to keep people in, and the East Germans didn‚Äôt have drones or submarines either. Read about how people and drugs are crossing the border, and I think you might reconsider the effectiveness of the wall
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump As if rich people don‚Äôt want to be richer üòÇ news flash about humans: we ALL want more money.
@585Conservative You seem to be glossing over the firsr sentence, where I affirmed the importance of knowing about ISIS‚Äô atrocities.
@thefu1000 So then perhaps that isn‚Äôt common sense gun control, which is what we are talking about.
@Pamforrest3 If it‚Äôs true, get him out of here. That behavior is disgusting
Hey America, for those of you who haven‚Äôt figured it out, the only reason Trump wants you to support this #TaxBill is because it gives rich people like him a massive tax cut‚Äîand he‚Äôll lie to you to get it.
@zakuformer Aptly put.
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump I would argue there‚Äôs a massive difference between sinking billions into an ineffective wall and leaving your doors ‚Äúwide open‚Äù
If you‚Äôre having a hard time getting through this #HumpDay, take a moment to enjoy the fact that @realdonaldtrump just said ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù wants a border wall üòÇ(reality: about 35% of Americans support ‚Äúthe wall‚Äú)
@585Conservative That‚Äôs great for you, although it is far from impossible to create a plan that helps the middle (where we are) without harming the rest of the middle and those less fortunate than us, and without blowing up the deficit. A worthy goal, no?
@585Conservative @MooreSenate I guess we will see whether your ‚Äúnope‚Äù is correct on Election Day!
@585Conservative That is... definitely common sense haha
There‚Äôs a part of me that cannot wait to see the angry #LittleDonnie tweets about PM Theresa May after she called him out for spreading anti-Muslim videos #üçø
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with informing the public of ISIS‚Äô atrocities‚Äîbut there is something VERY wrong about the president of the United States intentionally whipping up anti-Muslim sentiment. What about the Muslim Americans, whose lives this will undoubtedly impact?
This is sickening. What kind of president takes to Twitter to talk shit about an American citizen, and holds it over a father‚Äôs head when he gets his son out of a foreign jail? #TrumpResign https://t.co/IM4F6IaiKP
@MarkDickins Au contraire, my friend: given their goals, they actually operate VERY logically.
Of course; just remember how well they served the public by wiping out our retirement savings in ‚Äò08! Nothing like a clean slate, right? https://t.co/0AYmMXVMrW
@realDonaldTrump Where is this coming from lol
@MarkDickins I‚Äôm not making it up. It‚Äôs pretty basic logic.
@MarkDickins It would create a stronger incentive for DPRK to denuclearize than currently exists, as they would want US weapons out of South Korea as soon as possible.
Denuclearization is a two-way street; it‚Äôs time for the US to announce that further ICBM tests by #NorthKorea will be met with the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea.
All you need to know about the GOP #TaxBill: the rich pay less, and the poor pay more.
Roy Moore‚Äôs campaign created a website to let supporters report ‚Äúinappropriate news organization contact.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt @mooresenate have much larger ‚Äúinappropriate contact‚Äù problems to address...?
When people say the first step to common sense #GunControl is fully enforcing the laws already on the books, they are absolutely right. The Air Force‚Äôs role in the Texas massacre makes that clear.
It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see how @senategop operates by listening to Republicans while completely ignoring their Democratic colleagues. They accuse the Democrats of obstruction when all they want is some help for lower-income Americans! #TaxBill
The #DoddFrank Act set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to insulate it from corruption by politicians‚Äîenter @realdonaldtrump, who‚Äôs illegally trying to replace its leader with a politician!
@Johnwjgt @Project_Veritas @washingtonpost Omg how did I not see it
It‚Äôs both sad and ironic that the right-wing misinformation firm @project_veritas tried to feed @washingtonpost a fake story‚Äîin order to ‚Äúcombat the lies and deceipt of the liberal MSM.‚Äù #FakeNews
@88weighted Stealing a Supreme Court seat might be most egregious abuse of the Constitution since the Civil War...
Hey Republicans, you had better take your party back ASAP.
A senior Pakistani official just had to resign because extremist groups accused him of blasphemy. Moderate Pakistanis need to take their country back before this gets any crazier.
Angela Merkel: ‚ÄúWe need to create stability; the people expect that of us.‚Äù	@realdonaldtrump: https://t.co/I9umCjIUBA
Despite growing crises in East Asia and the Middle East, the US has no ambassadors to South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt or Qatar. Don‚Äôt worry, though‚ÄîJared Kushner does all that!
@realDonaldTrump Jones wants to raises taxes?! üò±
Well, he‚Äôs certainly not my favorite president. Does that make this #FakeNews? https://t.co/I9umCjIUBA
@realDonaldTrump I guess this must be #FakeNews, because you‚Äôre not our favorite president.
It‚Äôs difficult to overstate how difficult  @realDonaldTrump is making it for the next president to succeed.
A new bipartisan Senate report confirms: under the @GOP #TaxBill, the rich pay less, and the poor pay more. #TaxScam
By repeatedly attempting to intervene in and politicize @TheJusticeDept investigations, @realDonaldTrump has shown that he is fundamentally indifferent to the concept of justice.
#Russia has once again used its veto power to prevent the U.N. from releasing its report on the chemical weapons attack in Syria earlier this year, which killed scores. What are they trying to hide?
If the @GOP repeals the estate tax to help the 0.2% richest Americans, the rest of us will have to make up the $151,000,000,000 in lost revenue. Does that sound fair to you? #TaxScam
Massive terrorist attack against a mosque in #Egypt kills 235 Muslims, further proving that Islam isn‚Äôt the problem‚Äîterrorism is.
@Chrysler300Jack @HillaryClinton ...like what?
I‚Äôm grateful for the millions of Americans who are more interested in making our country work well again than in making the other side look dumb. Happy Thanksgiving!
@Chrysler300Jack @HillaryClinton Damn! I‚Äôm not likely to believe any of the allegations against Hillary until they‚Äôre proven, but that was the most rational and articulate thing I‚Äôve ever seen you tweet.
@SAHinchcliffe @Marlborolts5150 @DebolDog @_thymes @AdamPiersen @gooseycheeks @OldeeBully Lol alright guys. If you read the whole Constitution, it‚Äôs clear 2A lays the groundwork for organized militias, which became the NG. That‚Äôs it. This isn‚Äôt about your fears of the big scary world and the scary govt and scary liberals. It‚Äôs about creating a country that works well.
@Marlborolts5150 @DebolDog @_thymes @AdamPiersen @gooseycheeks @OldeeBully I completely disagree. Anyways, just out of curiosity, can I ask what you think I mean by gun control?
@Marlborolts5150 @DebolDog @_thymes @AdamPiersen @gooseycheeks @OldeeBully What a ‚Äúrespectful, open-minded debate‚Äù this is!
@AdamPiersen @Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @OldeeBully @_thymes Have you read the Constitution? It‚Äôs pretty clear throughout
It‚Äôs completely unconscionable that @gop claims their #TaxBill lowers taxes for the middle class, when in reality it lowers taxes for a portion of the middle class‚Äîby raising taxes on the rest of the middle class! #TaxScam
@darwin_hannon Hahahaha so accurate
@DONNABELLINI1 @realDonaldTrump Oh please, they weren‚Äôt babies, they were just young girls! ü§¢ #GrandOldPedophiles
@KLWorster @OldeeBully @Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @_thymes It can, but the primary/day-to-day control rests with the states
@Chrysler300Jack @HillaryClinton I was gonna say that contradicts your assertion, but actually, most of the things that came out of Trump‚Äôs mouth came out of his mouth because of Russian propaganda... so you might actually be right! üòÇ
@Chrysler300Jack @HillaryClinton Lol. My belief that Hillary was the best candidate was based in large part on the things that came out of Donald Trump‚Äôs mouth.
This is a great tool that could bring clarity to millions of Americans, and helps redress the civic damage caused by Facebook‚Äôs massive failures. If they keep making moves like this, I‚Äôll put their app back on my phone. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/7BYs17uCKE
@KLWorster @OldeeBully @Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @_thymes But the federal government really doesn‚Äôt have control over the National Guard, the states do
Why is it that @realDonaldTrump is more willing to believe Putin than American intelligence agencies? #TrumpRussia
@blackreduxfall @gooseycheeks @_thymes Guys, cut it out. This isn‚Äôt accomplishing anything.
@Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @OldeeBully @_thymes You should read my analysis of the Constitution: https://t.co/FnknYauxWU
@RHH01NJ @_thymes All good points
At this rate, how long until the #ReligiousRight claims it‚Äôs under attack from the religious right??
@donnalhowell5 @realDonaldTrump I was just thinking about that! ‚ÄúNFL‚Äù players and now this dad...
@RHH01NJ @_thymes Hey I‚Äôm not claiming the law isn‚Äôt the law, I just think the current laws and how we interpret them aren‚Äôt serving us well.
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes I guess I‚Äôm just a little bit more of a realist than that. Tell you what: why don‚Äôt you go to Russia and exercise your natural right to demonstrate against Putin. See how far your ‚Äúrights‚Äù get you there. You might be surprised to find you don‚Äôt actually have any!
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes Lol so... our parents?
@OldeeBully Which is a type of‚Äîwait for it‚Äîdemocracy!
@gooseycheeks @OldeeBully @Marlborolts5150 @_thymes The government itself is a construct of the people, isn‚Äôt it?
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes You‚Äôre right about what I said. I didn‚Äôt learn that our rights come from god, I learned that the framers wrote that in the Declaration of Independence‚Äîwhich doesn‚Äôt make it true. It‚Äôs just what they believed, and that‚Äôs cool
@OldeeBully Good luck to you, sir.
@OldeeBully When the foundational principles of democracy seem ‚Äúcommie‚Äù to you, you know you‚Äôre in the wrong country.
@OldeeBully @Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @_thymes Lol dude! The National Guard was created as the ‚Äúwell-regulated militia‚Äù authorized by the 2nd Amendment.
@_thymes @rogerthatone I‚Äôm not really interested in playing games with you. ‚ÄúThe People‚Äù doesn‚Äôt refer to a militia, and you know it‚Äî‚Äúa well-regulated militia‚Äù refers to a militia, said in the context of granting the people the right to form such a militia.
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes Which begs the question, what gave you the idea I didn‚Äôt recognize it? My school taught me about the DoI, who wrote it, and why. My school did not teach me that rights come from God, because that‚Äôs a belief, not a fact. You asserted it as a fact. I pushed back on that assertion.
@Marlborolts5150 @gooseycheeks @_thymes Probably because the Guard hadn‚Äôt been created yet lol
@TheGimpfuel @_thymes Ok, sure. The way I see it, the government is nothing but an extension of the people, and I think that‚Äôs exactly how our founders intended it. We shouldn‚Äôt fear the government, and if we do, that just means we need to reassert our control
@rogerthatone @_thymes Similar concept: ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù enjoy a right to self government in that we elect the government. Just because we aren‚Äôt in that government doesn‚Äôt mean we aren‚Äôt self-governing; just because we aren‚Äôt in the NG doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt our militia.
@rogerthatone @_thymes In reading the Constitution in its entirety I found it clear that the manner in which ‚Äúthe people‚Äù bear arms is in the formation of a ‚Äúwell-regulated militia,‚Äù i.e. the National Guard.
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes Yeah way to totally ignore the insulting part of that tweet lol
Why does @realDonaldTrump wake up and immediately start tweeting insults at American citizens, but it‚Äôs not until hours later that he bothers to mention yet another naval disaster? #priorities
@rogerthatone @_thymes If you think it contradicts yourself, you‚Äôre misinterpreting what I wrote. If you want to talk about it, I‚Äôm more than happy to
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes I find it interesting that people like you are unable to encounter opposing viewpoints without immediately reverting to hostility and insults.
@TheGimpfuel @_thymes That‚Äôs what I just said :)
@RHH01NJ @_thymes SCOTUS can be and is sometimes wrong in their interpretations of the law, often owing to ideological judges. This is one of those situations.
@rogerthatone @_thymes Yes. And we do. It‚Äôs called the national Guard. If you‚Äôre dying for a piece of that ‚Äúwell-regulated militia‚Äù action, why don‚Äôt you join! We would all welcome and appreciate your service.
@gooseycheeks @_thymes Lol I think it already happened ;)
@rogerthatone @gooseycheeks @_thymes Are you aware that is not part of the Constitution?
@rogerthatone @_thymes ...both of which we‚Äôve done before, and that process requires either a direct vote of the populous or ratification by the states. It‚Äôs a safeguard against making changes for the worse (like repealing 1A, which we would never do). (2/2)
@rogerthatone @_thymes If we wanted to, we absolutely could. But keep in mind ‚Äúwe‚Äù means ‚Äúthe people,‚Äù not ‚Äúthe government.‚Äù Trump couldn‚Äôt just wake up one morning and amend the 1st amendment; if you read the Constitution, it lays out a very clear process to both add and repeal amendments... (1/2)
@RAndrewCastel @_thymes What mirrored right are you talking about?
@TheGimpfuel @_thymes The government IS the people. If there‚Äôs a problem in this country, it‚Äôs how many people have forgotten that, and are living in fear of this giant scary ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù that they themselves ultimately control
@gooseycheeks @rogerthatone @_thymes Maybe because I went to a school that believes in the separation of church and state?
@gooseycheeks @_thymes You haven‚Äôt actually read the whole document, have you? If you had, it would be clear that we created the militia they refer to, and it is the National Guard.
@_thymes @rogerthatone For eight years people screamed that Obama was about to take their guns, and for eight years no one ever even tried. Wake up.
@JosephAschiero @rogerthatone @_thymes Good sir, I am well acquainted with US history, and with the Constitution. The rights we enjoy stem from we the people, not ‚Äúthe government‚Äù‚Äîbecause in a democracy, the government stems from the people.
Donald Trump is, quite literally, damaging our country.
@_thymes @rogerthatone Nobody is stopping you, my friend.
@paul1994loan @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs not piloting the planes, but he does have zero concept of how the military does or should work, and that filters down through the chain of command. A smart president would take one look at our overstretched military and order IMMEDIATE remedies, I.e. training and repairs
@rogerthatone @_thymes Incorrect! Our rights are the foundation of our entire legal and political system‚Äîthey cannot be taken away unless the laws (amendments) that grant them are repealed, and government can‚Äôt do that; only the people can.
@JosephAschiero @rogerthatone @_thymes Humans have natural rights because we wrote them into law. In the Bill of Rights.
With all these crashes and mishaps, the US Navy under @realDonaldTrump is looking more and more like the Russian Navy... although I guess that really should come as no surprise. #TrumpRussia
@rogerthatone @_thymes Lol oh really? So where do your rights come from then?
@OldeeBully Lol
@rogerthatone @_thymes The purpose of the Bill of Rights is provide rights, like the right of the people to form an armed militia, which we have done. It‚Äôs called the National Guard.
There really is no moral or economic justification for repealing the #EstateTax‚Äîit‚Äôs just blatant self-dealing by wealthy members of Congress and an even wealthier administration. #Corruption
@_thymes The Second Amendment is about giving states the right to establish their branches of the National Guard. If you read the entire Constitution, that‚Äôs pretty obvious. ‚úÖ
The truth is that there is zero conflict between the #SecondAmendment and common-sense #GunControl.

@PoINews2 Lol you are totally a Russian troll üòÇ
Unless you want your internet provider to tell you ‚ÄúNow, you can only watch YouTube in 360p unless you pay an extra $40/month,‚Äù you should be outraged by @AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs attack on #NetNeutrality.

@LeenaNevaTuuli Wow! I meant to type westward! You‚Äôre the only one who caught that ;)
@ljalawless Yep they do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm waiting for the investigation to be completed before judging
@ljalawless Obviously if there was no interaction with other people that caused their fall, then the Trump/Cruz/GOP response is a complete scandal
@ljalawless Not quite, I‚Äôd still like to know why they fell
@ljalawless Fox seems to think they were ‚Äúambushed by illegal immigrants, bashed with rocks before death,‚Äù which is classic Fox. I suspect the truth is somewhere between that and a simple ‚Äúhe fell down a hill.‚Äù Right?
@ljalawless I need more info
@ljalawless Are you kidding me??

@realDonaldTrump What horror? Are you talking about elephant hunting, which you briefly un-sanctioned until you saw how people reacted?
The #deficit under @realDonaldTrump has already grown 10%, yet he wants to keep spending more while slashing revenues. Our country is not one of his casinos!
If you want to destroy a country‚Äôs legal system, it‚Äôs hard to think of a much better way to do it than packing the courts with unqualified and extremist idealogues. @realDonaldTrump
A radioactive cloud drifts eastward over Europe, but #Russia claims they‚Äôre not the source, saying none of their nuclear facilities are detecting above-normal radioactivity levels. Funny, I remember hearing something similar about their Olympic athletes and steroids...

@LynneAvVer @WhitefishEnergy Exactly!! Same goes for #TrumpRussia: if nothing happened, why are they so worried about the investigation?
The @WhitefishEnergy CEO called the investigations into their highly questionable contract ‚Äúa witch hunt.‚Äù Pro tip: if you want to convince people you‚Äôre not on the dole from Trump, avoid copying his favorite excuses verbatim. #Corruption

Rather than capitulate in return for Xi‚Äôs flattery, @realDonaldTrump must be firm: we will gladly work with #China where our interests align, but where they don‚Äôt, we will not be able to give another inch.
Hard to fathom: @realDonaldTrump is asking Congress for extra hurricane relief money, but he‚Äôs ‚Äúworried about the deficit,‚Äù so he wants them to cut student financial aid too. Meanwhile, @GOP is pushing a $1.5+ trillion tax cut for the rich...
I know Judeo-Christian values, and I cannot for the life of me understand how someone who believes in those values can support a #Pedophile and #Hypocrite like @MooreSenate.
@Quanellxdoofus How about the Virgin Islands?
@Quanellxdoofus Ever heard of Puerto Rico?
It‚Äôs appalling that @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP refuse to adequately fund hurricane relief, but they can‚Äôt pass their $1,500,000,000,000 tax cut for the rich fast enough.
I‚Äôm sorry, but this has to be one of the dumbest moves of the year. #Hypocrite #Predator https://t.co/1Ffz8zJ4XL

I would say the @GOP #TaxBill is one big loophole, but at that point it‚Äôs not really a loophole anymore, it‚Äôs just one big gift to the rich at the expense of everyone else. #TaxScam #Corruption

@ObligedFriend Who said it was?
@PolitiSass @HouseGOP Without doubt. That‚Äôs the number they‚Äôre publicly sticking to because any higher would require *gasp, shudder* #bipartisanship.
So, @HouseGOP just passed a $1,500,000,000,000 bill without a single hearing. I don‚Äôt think that qualifies as governing. #TaxScam
@winetast3r @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs hilarious is he was probably being ironic, and trump just has zero clue

@YvetteRifkin @MicheleDiane8 @BBackerman1 @PingChoing @alfranken @MooreSenate I agree.
@TMech21 @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Lol go for it
@FShagW ...Are you suggesting the framers wrote the second amendment with tanks in mind?
Can I just say: @HillaryClinton tried to warn us about @realDonaldTrump, and she was 100% right.
@loganm111 Why don‚Äôt you try to guess
@loganm111 The word is Democratic. English isn‚Äôt that hard dude.
@Barbistall @HouseGOP Almost every Republican in the House, I‚Äôd have to assume.
Enough with #Republicans saying they‚Äôll vote for people like @MooreSenate or @realDonaldTrump, but ‚Äúwon‚Äôt endorse‚Äù them; YOUR VOTE IS THE ONLY ENDORSEMENT THAT MATTERS. #DrainTheSwamp
Welp, @HouseGOP just passed a bill that explodes the deficit so they can cut taxes for the rich. Cool story. #TaxBill #TaxScam #TaxReform
@YvetteRifkin @MicheleDiane8 @alfranken The apology and photo are convincing enough for me, just like the fact that @MooreSenate was banned from his local mall for accosting minors is enough for me to believe his 9+ accusers.
@paul1994loan @alfranken We don‚Äôt. The apology and photo are convincing enough for me, just like the fact that @MooreSenate was banned from his local mall for accosting minors is enough for me to believe his 9+ accusers.
@kanzaz @alfranken Agreed, although his apology and the photo are enough for me to believe her, just the like the fact that @MooreSenate was banned from his local mall for accosting minors is enough for me to believe his accusers.
@lindamama02 @alfranken This is exactly what desperate Republicans say about the women @MooreSenate molested. Don‚Äôt go there.
@crispycrise What?
#SexualAssault is a huge problem in our country, and while I‚Äôm glad many victims are finally feeling empowered to come forward, I‚Äôm deeply disappointed to hear of the allegations against Sen. @alfranken. I respected him.
#Russia‚Äôs decision to retaliate against @CNN for the designation the propaganda outlet @rt_com as a foreign agent illustrates the futility of dishonesty‚Äôs fight against truth; where the US strikes at his lies, #Putin has nothing to strike back at but the truth.
@ceeehmjay Thank you for your service!
Full panic: @MooreSenate calls the allegations against him, ‚Äúcompletely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever heard more desperate words from a politician. #NoMoore
During the campaign, Trump promised repeatedly and emphatically to repeal the carried interest tax loophole for millionaire investors‚Äîso it should come as no surprise that the #TaxBill his party is pushing doesn‚Äôt touch it. #AnotherTrumpLie
@GingerSue42 I guess just the people who care about the dignity of our country.
The massive surge in #Obamacare enrollment makes clear what we‚Äôve always known deep down, and what Republicans in Congress learned the hard way: people don‚Äôt want to lose their #Healthcare!
Petty is the new presidential. https://t.co/KCt9FkpbJH
@Asw2belle @SuziUrell Not enough, clearly.
I‚Äôm always amused by politicians like @Ed_Henry_HD9 who love to talk about ‚Äúpoliticians‚Äù and media fixtures like @TuckerCarlson who love to rag on ‚Äúthe media.‚Äù #CognitiveDissonance
It‚Äôs almost hard to believe what we are seeing: the so-called ‚Äú#AmericaFirst‚Äù president congratulating #China on leaving the US ‚Äúso far behind.‚Äù Seems like when it‚Äôs not #RussiaFirst, it‚Äôs #ChinaFirst.
@Asw2belle @SuziUrell He has already been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Clarification: @Ed_Henry_HD9 is the Alabama State Representative who said the women @MooreSenate sexually assaulted when they were kids should be prosecuted for not coming forward sooner. #SexualAssault #Pedophilia
@LuvWestCounty Thank you for verifying the things you read! Wish more people were like that
@mhartart @MooreSenate It was Ed Henry. Feather away.
@Thumpr1982 @realDonaldTrump don‚Äôt believe so
@darrenpuscas @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs kind of a funny tell though haha
@LuvWestCounty You know what, I‚Äôm talking about different sanctions actually. Congress passed more limited sanctions in response to #TrumpRussia and Trump never implemented them. You‚Äôre right
@LuvWestCounty I do not believe that is true. Russia has been under increasingly tough sanctions since they invaded Ukraine in 2014, and it sent their economy into recession
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned.‚Äù -@realDonaldTrump	Oh, we know‚Äîwe did that because they attacked our democracy! #TrumpRussia
@WendyMarcinkie1 @MooreSenate It was Ed Henry
@Areopagitica1 @MooreSenate Ed Henry
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP His average includes the recession, which he had nothing to do with. That‚Äôs a ridiculous measure
An #Alabama state representative said the women whom @MooreSenate sexually assaulted when they were minors should be prosecuted for not coming forward sooner. #WhatIsHappening
Donald Trump nominated for a lifetime federal judgeship someone who has never tried a case and was unaimously deemed ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù by the American Bar Association. That is nothing less than an attack on our judicial system.
@585Conservative @GOP @POTUS @NYGovCuomo If you‚Äôre going to say things like ‚Äúthe rich people you despise,‚Äù we‚Äôre not going to be able to continue this conversation. That‚Äôs beneath you
Past US presidents have condemned countries that steal American intellectual property‚Äî@realDonaldTrump congratulates them.
@rights_state @GOP @DNC  https://t.co/ItQ7Nj6WQD
@585Conservative @GOP @POTUS @NYGovCuomo You just switched topic from individual income taxes to corporate taxes, from federal to state, and from Trump to Cuomo...
@rights_state @GOP @DNC To look at but one function of the government, compare the relative cost of the military in 1913 with the inflation-adjusted relative cost now. The modern United States‚Äîa superpower‚Äîcould not exist without taxes.
@rights_state @GOP @DNC You are arguing that the Constitution is unconstitutional. That is an untenable position.
@585Conservative @GOP @POTUS I get what you‚Äôre saying, I just don‚Äôt understand your point. A rich person doesn‚Äôt need tax breaks as much as a working class person does, regardless of how they got rich
@585Conservative @GOP @POTUS Yay for you indeed, but not yay for the other hardworking Americans who will see their taxes go up, also do taxes on the rich can be slashed.
@rights_state @GOP @DNC 1. Yes it does, read the Constitution (and before you say it, and amendment to the Constitution is, by definition, part of the Constitution)	2. How will we find fund the country?
If you‚Äôre in the middle class, you have to ask whether your taxes will go up or down under the @GOP #TaxBill. If you‚Äôre rich, all you have to ask is how much your taxes will go down by. #TaxReform
@585Conservative @MooreSenate Lol ok. So according to your theory, did the alleged assaults actually happen and were just bottled up until the opportune moment, or are they complete fabrications on the part of innocent Republican women under ‚Äúleftist‚Äù mind control?
@585Conservative @MooreSenate Leftists? Are these Alabama women not Republicans?
@585Conservative @MooreSenate Dude, I‚Äôm at work. I have a job.
@585Conservative @MooreSenate @ThomasWictor What does TL stand for
@585Conservative @MooreSenate I cannot possibly know what dictated the timing of their revelations, but timing doesn‚Äôt impact whether something is true or not. When a woman admits that she‚Äôs been sexually assaulted, you listen. When 5 separate women say the same thing, a pattern of behavior emerges.
Five woman have now credibly accused @mooresenate of sexually assaulting them when they were minors, but the Republican Party can‚Äôt seem to decide if this is a problem. #GrandOldPedophiles
@PoINews2 Two words: Hillary Clinton.
@585Conservative @MooreSenate Do you have any reason to believe that, or is it just a gut feeling?
With these disturbing new developments, one has to ask: how many other children did @MooreSenate abuse who haven‚Äôt come forward? #NoMoore #SexualAssault
@design2liv @realDonaldTrump Did he... forget to read it? Lol
@RetroCrone @MooreSenate They said yes. I am speechless.
@Dargamogirl @SueJRN @mizelectra True. She‚Äôs obviously a troll.
Under @barackobama, some of America‚Äôs values rubbed off on #China: the Chinese people were finally allowed to question their government, at a news conference between the two presidents. Under @realDonaldTrump, all that is gone.
@SueJRN Your comment raises a lot of questions, but the biggest is: why would you vote to elect a pedophile to the Senate?
I‚Äôm only saying this because certain Republicans feel it‚Äôs appropriate to defend @MooreSenate: sexual assault on a minor is NEVER okay. #NoMoore
@PoINews2 @MooreSenate Not interested in answering the question, I see. St. Petersburg, perhaps?
Great news! @realDonaldTrump wants to make so doctors are paid more based on the quantity than the quality of their work. Isn‚Äôt that reassuring? üôÉ #Healthcare
@PoINews2 @MooreSenate Hmm. Your English isn‚Äôt so good, buddy. Where ya from?
Tillerson says @realDonaldTrump hasn‚Äôt met Putin in Vietnam because they might not have ‚Äúsufficient substance‚Äù to talk about. I‚Äôm here to assure you they have PLENTY to talk about. #ElectionHacking #FakeNews #TrumpRussia
@PoINews2 I just wish @MooreSenate‚Äôs depravity had ended decades ago.
Two #Republican Party county chairmen in #Alabama said they think the allegations against @MooreSenate are a hoax, and wouldn‚Äôt change their minds‚Äîeven if they saw proof. #WhatIsHappening
@HerbNow @realDonaldTrump I mean, it‚Äôs been 10 months...
It‚Äôs almost as if @realDonaldTrump thinks he can flatter Xi into making huge concessions to the US. Come on, Trump, what kind of leader would be dumb enough to fall for‚Äîoh. Nevermind. #China
@realDonaldTrump LEARN. ENGLISH. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Think about it: Trump publicly bows down to Xi Jinping, but the White Houses insists that behind closed doors he pushed #China hard on trade. Give us a break‚Äîif Trump were really going to stand up for the US, he‚Äôd make sure that‚Äôs all his base saw on @FoxNews for weeks.
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP You don‚Äôt have to hear it from anyone, you can check the numbers for yourself! You what they say: people lie, numbers don‚Äôt ;)
@manon1165 @FoxNews They‚Äôre not a foreign agent, they‚Äôre just a shitty partisan blog.
@sherds34 Lol. You get my point though
It‚Äôs about time that @RT_com, one of #Russia‚Äôs most potent propaganda outlets, is designated a foreign agent‚Äîbut this move is too little, and way too late. #TrumpRussia
@PoINews2 ‚ÄúMOAB for ISIS:‚Äù the first one I read, at random, a complete red herring. The US has been bombing ISIS for years!
@gmworboys @MooreSenate Unreal, right??
@gmworboys @MooreSenate Democratic* don‚Äôt fall victim to the GOP marketing scheme üòâ
This is the type of nonsense that comes out of one‚Äôs mouth when one knows one is totally screwed. #NoMoore https://t.co/NVlezfC8h5
@PoINews2 You tweet about me quite a lot, and I‚Äôve noticed you‚Äôre consistently 100% insults and 0% thoughts. Interesting.
@PoINews2 @realDonaldTrump Lol, that‚Äôs exactly the problem: he said both things. He means neither.
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to allow #China to rape our country, and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù -@realDonaldTrump, 2016 https://t.co/KTMQlaVBjw
@doctorashwinkr They are there because they were ordered to be there, and I‚Äôm sure many of them are no happier about it than you are.
@MarketAphorist If our nation truly had a problem with war, we‚Äôd elect representatives who wouldn‚Äôt continue with war. I‚Äôm glad you voted for what you believe in, but until enough of the nation feels the same as you, don‚Äôt expect change. You can‚Äôt run the country by yourself.
@MarketAphorist That‚Äôs kind of my point‚Äîwhen you feel a particular war is pointless, you can be sure there are thousands of US soldiers who feel the same. But they follow their orders anyways, because that‚Äôs what they swore to do. Isn‚Äôt that admirable?
@yiizo Yeah. Thanks kind of my point: these people aren‚Äôt out there stuck in awful situations because they had to; they‚Äôre there because they volunteered to be, so we don‚Äôt have to.
You don‚Äôt have to support a particular war or war in general, but this #VeteransDay, please make a point of supporting our veterans, who do what they‚Äôre told by our nation because that‚Äôs what they promised to do‚Äîeven if it kills them. (9/9)
@yiizo Once you're in a battle, you don't really have a choice of just jumping ship.
The fact is that thousands of us have avoided dying on a foreign battlefield because we didn‚Äôt have to serve. In a way, we have those who decided to serve to thank for that. This #VeteransDay, please think about that. (8/9)
@PoINews2 Wait, does that mean you don‚Äôt think climate change is a hoax??
@dukebriscoe The use of private contractors is abhorrent
@Boodoggy3 At these international summits it's very common for all the leaders to put on the same costume for the big group photo.
This #VeteransDay, think about how the luxury of going to the mall while soldiers die overseas has enabled us to keep up sustained warfare, because we at home don‚Äôt perceive the costs. (7/9)
@PoINews2 If I couldn‚Äôt write the word ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôd wanna call other people fools üòâ
@1960weave Sadly, I have heard some people disparage the military, and I find that ignorant and ungrateful
@sean98765 Yeah, I‚Äôm all for not attacking people. And I have a feeling we have a lot of common ground... I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpro-gun,‚Äù but I‚Äôm certainly not ‚Äúanti-gun‚Äù
America has been at war for more than 15 years‚Äîbut who here has actually felt it, besides our veterans and their families? This #VeteransDay, think about how we abuse that luxury when we disparage the military or take it for granted. (6/9)
@SerenityFoods @RnShinobi Thanks :)
As America has grown richer and more powerful, the people have become removed from war‚Äîdangerously so, in my opinion. When you sit down for dinner with your family this #VeteransDay, think about the soldiers who have no choice but to be in Afghanistan, fighting. (5/9)
@88weighted AMEN
@Jackrea40163054 Exactly what Putin would want. You‚Äôre good at your job!
@RnShinobi Nope, nothing too deep about understanding and appreciating the sacrifices of our veterans. It‚Äôs actually pretty common sense.
@rebeccaslake Under our constitutional system the government is the representative of the people.
This #VeteransDay, consider the fact that we have been given the option not to serve in the military because others are willing to do it for us. Think about the things we‚Äôll never have to experience because someone else has volunteered to experience them for us. (4/9)
We may not always support the wars our soldiers fight, but we must always support our soldiers. A soldier doesn‚Äôt go to war because he or she wants to; a soldier goes to war because we the people ordered them to. This #VeteransDay and every day, that deserves gratitude. (3/9)
This #VeteransDay, think about the admirability of the conviction that you need to serve your country, knowing you may well be ordered to fight for something you don‚Äôt believe in, but doing it anyways because you believe in your country. (2/9)
This #VeteransDay, please take a moment to think about what others have done to help build and protect our country. Regardless of your thoughts on ‚Äúwar,‚Äù consider the bravery and discipline required to put yourself in danger simply because you‚Äôre ordered to do so. (1/9)
@wyn_a That‚Äôs my photo from work lol
@sean98765 Ok, so buy it. Show me that a regular unlicensed citizen can buy a tank with a working gun lol
@soxen2013 Obama never ‚Äúbashed‚Äù America, and if he did, I sure wouldn‚Äôt love it.
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP Indeed... although that was already true before the election.
@Chrysler300Jack @MooreSenate Not quite, because Roy Moore is not a carpenter and the girls he molested are not boys
@sean98765 Not with an operational gun dude come on don‚Äôt waste our time
@muthaucker @Benito35ddDavis All I can tell you is the six veterans I spoke with tonight (four from Vietnam) feel very differently.
@Furf_7 @DegreaseTony Thank him for his service‚Äîand sense‚Äîfor us.
Compare @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs words about Xi (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very special man‚Äù) with Xi‚Äôs words about Trump (wholly unimpressed). Pretty much says it all. #China
An #Alabama state official just defended @MooreSenate with, ‚ÄúMary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter.‚Äù		Is this real life?
Today, Donald #DraftDodger #BoneSpurs Trump met with US vets in #Vietnam and signed a commemoration of the war. If that isn‚Äôt a huge middle finger to our Vietnam #Veterans, I don‚Äôt know what is.
@ruthbeall @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs almost impressive: shell out a few hundred thousand on making Trump feel special, and reap hundreds of millions as his tough talk on trade and intellectual property theft crumbles. What an investment!
@ruthbeall @realDonaldTrump Yep, they sure know how to deal with people whose only guiding force is a fragile ego! üòÇ
@RKennerB @realDonaldTrump Yeah... if you‚Äôre waiting for Trump to do something in the national interest, don‚Äôt hold your breath. üò°
There‚Äôs something profoundly wrong about a US president prostrating himself before a communist dictator. @realDonaldTrump #China
Can‚Äôt help but notice that while in #China, @realdonaldtrump was too busy praising President Xi to say three little words: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT. #AmericaFirst
@MaeveMagdalen In this case, it‚Äôs not Hollywood, it‚Äôs reality. Ever heard of Roy Moore?
@LadyRose666 @realDonaldTrump What about nuclear nonproliferation?
We always knew @MooreSenate was the poster child of perverting Christian values‚Äîwhat we didn‚Äôt realize is that he‚Äôs a literal pervert for children. #Alabama #RoyMoore #NoMoore
@PolitiSass @realDonaldTrump Hahaha
Fact of the morning: @realDonaldTrump is more popular in Vietnam than in the United States. üáªüá≥üáªüá≥üáªüá≥
@funder @5_2blue And yet he campaigned as a ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù Sickening.
@rights_state 1. A republic is a type of democracy	2. A dictatorship is not a type of democracy
@Sambacon25 @govsambrownback Incidentally, it‚Äôs also why our schools went from best in the nation to almost the worst
If you‚Äôve heard someone argue that reckless tax cuts will boost the economy, look at #Kansas, which @govsambrownback brought to its knees with unconstitutionally massive tax‚Äîread: service‚Äîcuts. The state legislature finally raised taxes to avert further damage. #TaxReform
@darlene09465021 They were also frustrated by Obama... because he showed strength.
@mkanau @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs fallen in love lol
Xi Jinping has proven a master at accepting @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs concessions while always stopping short of actually helping us address #NorthKorea. Does the president not understand what‚Äôs happening? #China
Hey voters: the @HouseGOP #TaxBill would raise taxes on half of the middle class by 2026. Call your representatives and say no tax hikes on the middle class to finance tax cuts for the rich! #TaxReform
@DimitriNosarev @ginger6516 Lol. Buddy. You seem to forget how all this started: you began this thread and made me aware of your existence by attacking me as part of some ‚Äúregressive left,‚Äù and you tacked on a fake Lenin quote for good measure.
@DimitriNosarev @ginger6516 That‚Äôs a pretty reprehensible thing to say.
#Gerrymandering is one of the most corrosive forces threatening our democracy today. We need to draw districts fairly so the voters pick their representatives‚Äînot the other way around!
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 Same to you. Gnight
@cww233 @heine_geary Not to butt into your conversation, but are you talking about Texas? The account I read said the armed bystander got in someone else‚Äôs car and chased the gunman (after he had already carried out the shooting), at which point the gunman crashed and shot himself.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 Of course it does! It sets up the National Guard. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty darn important!
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 Except VASTLY more deadly, and not kept safe the way colonial militias did their muskets.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 ...As of 2001. Aka, after 215 years of not being interpreted that way. Why the sudden change? NRA lobbying is a big factor.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 If you‚Äôre getting hung up on the phrase ‚Äúmilitary-grade,‚Äù let me rephrase it to ‚Äúcapable of killing hundreds in minutes,‚Äù because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really at issue here. You could argue rocks were military-grade weapons at one point, but nobody‚Äôs talking about banning rocks.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 Yes, because a reasonable person has to draw the line somewhere in terms of the amount of firepower in the hands of a militia. The framers knew only muskets‚Äîa vastly different amount of firepower than AR-15‚Äôs or bombs. Do you think they would have allowed those?
@cww233 @heine_geary We always had, and still have, the right to form a well-regulated armed militia. If you want to be a part of it, join the National Guard.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 If you read the entire Constitution, it‚Äôs obvious that #2A provides for the states to organize their militias. They did; it‚Äôs called the National Guard, and they have all the guns they need to keep us safe. 2A is not about letting private citizens own assault rifles.
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 ...no? What do you mean?
@RobbyTheremin @DimitriNosarev I like this good troll bad troll routine haha
@RobbyTheremin @DimitriNosarev There‚Äôs nothing to refute about a quote that was never said, my friend.
@DimitriNosarev Thank god Twitter raised the limit to 280 characters. It would have been almost impossible to pack all those stupid assumptions and ignorant accusations into 140!
@tjd1307 Haha what
I woke up this morning thinking about the fact that voters in Virginia, New Jersey, and New York City decisively rejected grievance politics, opting instead for candidates who will work on building a stronger nation. Today was a good day. #BlueWave
@cww233 @Mike_D_39 It was absolutely inconceivable at the time of the founding that private citizens would own weapons that could kill hundreds in minutes. Even the minutemen, you will recall, kept their guns safely in armories.
@DimitriNosarev Shouldn‚Äôt your name a Russian flag next to it? Thanks for your attempt at harming the United States. Better luck next time!
@rebelatl2000 Lol wtf
@Mike_D_39 Fair enough
@rights_state It‚Äôs pretty amazing (and upsetting) to think about how much consensus we used to be able to find in choosing a president‚ÄîReagan in 1980 (489), Roosevelt in 1936 (523)...
Congratulations on what? And didn‚Äôt you say it was @TheDemocrats who couldn‚Äôt get over the election? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/AX0g2upeQz
@1960weave Haha oh no! You quoted a tweet of mine with a typo! üò≥üòú
@Mike_D_39 The notion that the Constitution gives individual private citizens the rights to own military-grade weapons was not widely accepted for the vast majority of our country‚Äôs history. The NRA pushed that idea to the Supreme Court in 2001.
@Chrysler300Jack Lol. Democratic has two meanings: related to democracy, and related to the Democratic Party. We were talking about the first; you just switched to the second. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@BeChangeToday @republicans Ok. Was just a theoretical poll.
@pharmalady See above
@Lucypuff For the sake of argument, let‚Äôs say no to heavy weapons and military equipment, but yes to fully automatic rifles.
@RobRoy14451352 The majority of American care what liberals think üòâ
@1960weave It‚Äôs funny because everything you said is 100% common sense, and yet Republicans in Congress act like you‚Äôre suggesting adopt full-fledged communism.
We need real #TaxReform that doesn‚Äôt raise taxes on the working and middle classes, and that doesn‚Äôt blow the bottom out of the deficit.
@BeChangeToday I agree. But for the sake of argument, were you convinced that the only possibilities were the above compromise or no change in our gun laws, would you support it?
@Chrysler300Jack Democratic* state üòâ
@RadiumLovesIt @mauisrf7 For the sake of this opinion poll, let‚Äôs assume there was an enforcement mechanism you trusted.
@Mike_D_39 Can I ask why a database of who bought what guns, for tracing guns in the event they are stolen or misused, seems ‚Äúgestapo‚Äù to you?
@pharmalady For the sake of argument, suppose it was clear that the only two possible outcomes were the above compromise or no change in our gun laws. Would you support it then, even if only as an initial step?
@Lucypuff For the sake of argument, if the choice was either the compromise above or no changes in our gun laws, would you support it then?
RT: would you support a potential #GunControl/#2A compromise that opens restrictions on the kinds of weapons allowed in return for universal background checks and a national database of gun sales?
@585Conservative Democratic*. Anyways, take a look at the down ballot races, good sir‚Äîespecially in VA. Also, in NYC, DeBlasio was the first Democratic mayor to be re-elected in a long time. You‚Äôre right about NJ, though‚Äîthat‚Äôs a liberal state at its heart, and Christie was an aberration
@PoINews2 @DeborahGore54 @ClintBoyington @CNN @FoxNews Thanks!

@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP You will recall that consumer confidence was the one topic of those you listed where I agreed Trump has had a positive effect
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag Either way, an unorganized militia certain could (and should) keep assault rifles and other military-grade gear in an armory, where it‚Äôs safe.
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag Lol before I go where. And what was your point in distinguishing between organized and unorganized militias? 2A doesn‚Äôt specify what kind it means, so I think opting for organized is perfectly reasonable
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag I would be perfectly comfortable with a ban on assault rifles, automatic and semi auto. I‚Äôd probably even support it
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag 2a has nothing to do with private citizens owning assault rifles either. If you read the entire Constitution, it‚Äôs extremely clear that 2a gives the states the right to organize their militias: the National Guard.
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag I have a feeling you‚Äôre not interested in my point, but I‚Äôll make it anyways: some guns are meant for shooting game, and that‚Äôs fine. Others are meant for killing as many people as possible, and that‚Äôs not fine. Those kinds of weapons shouldn‚Äôt be public‚Äîlike tanks, or AR-15‚Äôs.
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag My dude assault rifles are military equipment. It is literally a piece of military equipment that has been made semi-auto.
@jdo916 @OpenCarryMag Sure! You can buy a tank because it‚Äôs just a vehicle, but not one with an operable gun, because it‚Äôs a military-grade weapon‚Äîjust like the AR-15, the semi-auto version of the military‚Äôs M16. Wait for it... anything else?
@candice90265 @toddstarnes Well that sure is a stark change in tone from someone who just minutes ago responded to a view that differs from their own with ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù
@jdo916 @RetroCrone Lol read it yourself
@rights_state @RalphNortham State first, sure‚Äîas long as they‚Äôre both adhered to.
@candice90265 @toddstarnes It‚Äôs ironic because the candidate who wasn‚Äôt running on a platform of painting all immigrants as dangerous criminals and defending the confederacy wasn‚Äôt the one race-baiting üòÇ
@sandyaschneider @jendew400 @srcla88 @RalphNortham But let me just reiterate, I agree with you that that ad should never have been made or published.
@sandyaschneider @jendew400 @srcla88 @RalphNortham ‚ÄúMy guy‚Äù didn‚Äôt put that out, and I‚Äôm pretty sure you know that. His supporters did. Either way, it was a bad ad and was rightfully pulled. It pales, however, in comparison to the overtly racist and scaremongering ads put out by Gillespie allies!
@rights_state @RalphNortham Yeah I think that part goes without saying for most people. (The federal one, too)
@jendew400 @sandyaschneider @srcla88 @RalphNortham It‚Äôs like they took the irony knob and cranked it to 11 üòÇ
@sandyaschneider @srcla88 @jendew400 Lol says you
@sandyaschneider @jendew400 @srcla88 @RalphNortham Lemme give you a hint: the candidate who wasn‚Äôt running on a platform of painting all immigrants as dangerous criminals and defending the confederacy wasn‚Äôt the one race-baiting
@toddstarnes @candice90265 Hint: the candidate who wasn‚Äôt running on a platform of painting all immigrants as dangerous criminals and defending the confederacy was not the one race-baiting üòÇ
@toddstarnes @candice90265 THE IRONY. IT IS TOO REAL. üòÇ
@rights_state @RalphNortham Haha! So what qualities do you look for in a governor? Just ‚Äúable to read?‚Äù
@jendew400 @sandyaschneider @srcla88 Congratulations to @RalphNortham, next governor of Virginia! Today‚Äôs elections were a clear response to the division and dishonesty we see attempting to take root in our country, as the American people said: not on our watch! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@sandyaschneider @srcla88 @jendew400 Sandra, what‚Äôs your point?
#VAGovRace @RalphNortham is exactly the kind of Democratic leader we need to elect: smart, fair, and pragmatic. #VoteBlue, #Virginia!
@sandyaschneider Jeez, what kind of person says a veteran ‚Äúhas done nothing for the military?‚Äù Have a little respect please.
@sandyaschneider How about served in it honorably?
@yuanwife @realDonaldTrump @RalphNortham There are zero sanctuary cities in VA. That this even became an issue shows how useless @EdWGillespie is! #VAGovRace
@candice90265 @realDonaldTrump @RalphNortham üö®Bot alert! How‚Äôs the weather in St. Petersburg this time of year, @candice90265?
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yeah dude I‚Äôm sure. You can look those numbers up pretty easily and see for yourself
Unreal. @RalphNortham IS one of our great vets! Don‚Äôt let Trump lie to you, Virginia‚Äîvote for your future, vote Northam! #VAGovRace https://t.co/3n8ow9kqE2
Don‚Äôt let @realDonaldTrump scare you‚Äî@RalphNortham is ready to focus on helping Virginians achieve the better life they deserve! #VAGovRace https://t.co/3n8ow9kqE2
@realDonaldTrump @EdWGillespie Virginia is doing great, and it‚Äôs thanks to pragmatic liberal policies!
@CardinalTheBirb @alienpatriot79 @BigFatDave @TylerBlackwell4 Just trying to reassure you...
@bleedingonpaper @realDonaldTrump Wrong. You do not want to enter negotiations looking desperate.
@AtomicFB And I am clearly talking about the live weapon, not a giant armored vehicle. #context
@dontiann With an operable gun? Oh yes it is.
@RetroCrone The 2nd amendment doesn‚Äôt even necessarily allow a private citizen to own a handgun. That interpretation was pushed by the NRA just recently
@PoINews2 @DeborahGore54 @ClintBoyington @CNN @FoxNews There is no democrat party lol
@DeborahGore54 @ClintBoyington @PoINews2 @CNN @FoxNews I‚Äôve seen plenty of fake Hillary quotes... usually they at least try to make it sorta plausibly believable maybe hahaha
@CardinalTheBirb @alienpatriot79 @BigFatDave @TylerBlackwell4 Nobody‚Äôs after your rights lol chill dude
@rights_state @RalphNortham @EdWGillespie Btw how does one ‚Äúvote anarchy?‚Äù
@rights_state @RalphNortham @EdWGillespie Lol what and ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù will?
#VAGovRace @RalphNortham is going to make a great governor of #Virginia!!
@stainless10fp @TylerBlackwell4 @alienpatriot79 It‚Äôs called no background check
@Michael31300435 don‚Äôt forget #RussianBot		@Twitter, get this shit out of here!
@Jenkins100Rose With a functional gun? It absolutely is
@Kirstenjoyweiss You do know the armed bystander didn‚Äôt do anything except chase the shooter and wait for the police, right?
@Kirstenjoyweiss @mrsprenger @JosephAschiero You will not want an assault rifle in CQC.
@rights_state @RalphNortham @EdWGillespie Lol ok
Thank goodness @RalphNortham is focused on helping #Virginia prosper. Ed Gillespie is busy focusing on statues and immigrants. #VAGovRace https://t.co/7UpkZ17j18
@JosephAschiero @mrsprenger Exactly. The gun has to be inoperable, because it‚Äôs not safe for military grade weapons to be publicly for sale‚Äîotherwise this happens
@alienpatriot79 Lol the point is you couldn‚Äôt, even if you had the money. How would you even start to go about buying a tank? Abrams dealership? Lol
@OpenCarryMag Ok, go buy a shiny new tank. Let‚Äôs see.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing hurts your negotiating position like insisting you have a strong negotiating position. #AmateurHour
@realDonaldTrump @RalphNortham is focused on helping #Virginia prosper. Gillespie is focused on statues and immigrants.
The epidemic of #Russian accounts attempting to polarize the nation with fabcricated quotes and #FakeNews didn‚Äôt stop after the election. https://t.co/sXMHqi4yK4
@PoINews2 @CNN @FoxNews You tried pulling that fake quote on me last week! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@alienpatriot79 Ok buddy, go buy a shiny new tank.
@Bagehot99 Not that either of those things would ever happen, but I just gotta ask: would you seriously die over a fucking gun?
@Bagehot99 Haha ok. If you wanna play cutesy semantic games instead of discuss the problem, you‚Äôre gonna have to play by yourself.
@Bagehot99 None. Do you feel like you‚Äôve sacrificed freedom by not being allowed to own nuclear weapons?
@bob16066 That is a ridiculous intreptetation of the phrase ‚Äúbear arms‚Äù lol
@combatveterin Created by Russians to further polarize the US? Entirely possible.
It‚Äôs illegal to own a tank. Why isn‚Äôt it illegal to own other military equipment, like assault rifles? #GunSense #TexasShooting
@Bagehot99 Have you heard of Australia? Read about the results of their gun buyback program
@Bagehot99 ‚ÄúTriggering a civil war‚Äù quit being a drama queen hahaha
@Rattle50snake @Bagehot99 Some would, others would not. I dunno about you, but I‚Äôd rather have less shootings than the same amount of shootings.
@Rattle50snake @Bagehot99 Both are problems, and both need to change
That @SenateGOP would even CONSIDER capping 401k contributions shows that despite false rhetoric, they‚Äôre not thinking about working America
@BKaysac What is your statement based on
@Bagehot99 3. If there are less guns, it will be more difficult for would-be shooters to acquire a gun.
@Bagehot99 2. Buying a gun can be done legally or illegally. I wasn‚Äôt just talking about legal purchases
@Bagehot99 1. I‚Äôd happily prevent some shootings rather than do nothing at all
Hey America: if it wasn‚Äôt so easy to buy a gun in this country, I GUARANTEE you there would be less of these awful shootings. #texasshooting
@FreeorDie5 @CindyHess65 @GOP Haha ok
Wow, @TGowdySC must have been crushed to learn that the conservative @FreeBeacon was first to hire #FusionGPS for research on Trump‚Äînot Dems
@FreeorDie5 @CindyHess65 @GOP A plain white shirt looks Russian to you?
Can someone explain to me why when @FBI told @DNC about #TrumpRussia intrusion, their IT did nothing for 7 months? Need #CyberSecurity now!
@585Conservative @GOP Huh. Proof I guess that a perfectly ‚Äúfree‚Äù market is not required for prosperity! What do you know
If you consider @FoxNews to be a serious news source, perhaps this might help you. https://t.co/kGhDTqspfS
#Perjury: @jeffsessions testified under oath that he knew of no #TrumpRussia connections in the campaign. We now know that to be false.
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP And you think all that happened in the last 10 months? Consumer confidence maybe, but no way on the rest
The Murdoch media empire‚Äôs sustained campaign of obfuscation and confusion regarding #TrumpRussia is damaging to the national interest.
The @GOP under Trump is no longer the party of the free market‚Äîit simply picks its own winners and losers according to who donates the most. https://t.co/sxOs5XaTO4
@DonnaVVoVV Not super familiar with the details of it but it seemed clear from what we learned during the campaign that it wasn‚Äôt a level playing field
There‚Äôs plenty of #justice to go around for all the corrupt #lobbyists‚ÄîManafort, Flynn, Gates, Podesta: #Mueller will find out what you did.
Russian propaganda account @TEN_GOP, impersonating @TNGOP, had 130k followers before it was stopped. @Twitter, care to explain? #TrumpRussia
@NoBadHairDays2 Yes, I‚Äôm aware. You were also not the only one to suggest Trump might have staged/allowed an ISIS attack in New York City
@Lonniedelray1 @realDonaldTrump Some people are just sociopaths.
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions Shocking, but ok. Now let‚Äôs say hypothetically we knew it occurred and that Clinton would have won had it not. Would you feel differently?
@LATiffani1 @ladydwinter @NFL 100% unrelated
To anyone who thinks @realDonaldTrump is focused on his job: sorry, but check his Twitter feed.
@DriverX_ The official explanation of events being that Stephen Paddock committed a mass murder from his hotel room? Yes, obviously.
@DriverX_ I wasn‚Äôt being a smart ass. What happened in Las Vegas is an unmitigated tragedy, and I‚Äôll wait for law enforcement to draw the conclusions.
@barbn1943 I assure you, it is VERY far fetched.
@shannongalloway Lol real. He can‚Äôt even spell ‚Äútap‚Äù
@DriverX_ Tragic.
@metrofla No. Idiocy, lunacy, blind hatred, conspiracy theories, polarization, lies, reckless conjecture, and baseless allegations bother me.
If you‚Äôve publicly suggested Trump might have arranged the #NYC attack as a diversion, please unfollow me. Leave that shit to InfoWars.
@mommacq @realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs not go there. That‚Äôs InfoWars crap
@NoBadHairDays2 Let‚Äôs not go there
@Lonniedelray1 @realDonaldTrump I can see why you‚Äôd think that, but I disagree. I analyze objectively, including credit where credit is due (I.e. trial for NYC terrorist)
@Lonniedelray1 @realDonaldTrump Does that mean NYC, Vegas, Niger, the USS McCain, the USS Fitzgerald, and all the other Trump calamities didn‚Äôt really happen?
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions Ok. Let‚Äôs say we knew for a fact that it happened but didn‚Äôt influence the election at all (hypotheticals). How would you feel about it?
@mommacq @realDonaldTrump I would.
All the terror attacks, avoidable military deaths, corruption, collusion‚Äîare they just diversions, or is @realDonaldTrump really that awful?
@FreeorDie5 @CindyHess65 @GOP Haha what makes someone look Russian?
@585Conservative @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions Out of curiosity, were it true that collusion isn‚Äôt a crime, and were it proved that Trump colluded with Russia to win, how would you feel?
@NihilMagus @Monaheart1229 Thank you, but subtitles aren‚Äôt working for me :/
@NihilMagus @Monaheart1229 Can I get a video clip please
@PoINews2 And you called me a pervert! If were you I‚Äôd keep my hobby of photoshopping dicks onto women to myself lol
@FreeorDie5 @CindyHess65 @GOP My liberal friends (and my conservative ones) know that. Do you not?
@dl_foutch @realDonaldTrump @GOP There‚Äôs only one place someone with any interest in truth gets their economic data: the people who collect it. https://t.co/IzHRd0GA5o
@FreeorDie5 @CindyHess65 @GOP Lol what? I‚Äôm russian?
@NataschaKRoss Don‚Äôt hold your breath.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @jeffsessions claimed to know of no Russia contacts in the campaign‚Äîwhich we now know is false. THIS IS BIG	#TrumpRussia
@PoINews2 Also I like how they threw in a picture of Michelle Obama just for good measure hahaha
@PoINews2 Yes, it says that. Which is how you knew I‚Äôm a Democrat. Which is why I said you know I‚Äôm a Democrat. You‚Äôre trying way too hard man!
@SugarBe14747139 @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn Of course shady and dumb are basically two biggest criteria‚Äîbesides blind loyalty, of course‚Äîfor @realDonaldTrump to take an interest in you
@SugarBe14747139 @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn But was... wait for it... fired! When it became clear that he was super shady! (Not to mention, pretty dumb)
@PoINews2 Except that I‚Äôm a Democrat, I guess üëçüèºüá∫üá∏
@PoINews2 Lol you don‚Äôt know anything about me
Reminder: @realDonaldTrump hired @GenFlynn as national security advisor knowing he was under federal investigation for being a foreign agent
@PoINews2 Lol wtf
@PoINews2 Hey don‚Äôt talk crap about my brother he‚Äôs a good guy
@KekistanJarhead I‚Äôm at work right now so not reading news but have been following events in Ukraine very closely for almost a decade. No facts distract meüòâ
@KekistanJarhead Anyways I haven‚Äôt seen anything yet to suggest that $75M wasn‚Äôt the money he and Gates kept. Podesta/Mercury money is separate I think
@KekistanJarhead Well, minus the part he blew on clothes, of course. Haha
@KekistanJarhead 1. Disagree	2. Had we interfered in Ukraine, would that make it ok, in your book, for Russia to interfere here?
@KekistanJarhead I believe Mueller is pursuing legal action against those firms as well.
@KekistanJarhead To broker PR work on behalf of a foreign government is indeed to act as an agent of that government.
@KekistanJarhead I‚Äôm a little confused. On one hand you claim to be #AmericaFirst, but on the other you seem to question US support for a pro-West Ukraine?
@KekistanJarhead Lol that ain‚Äôt me pal
@KekistanJarhead Tough news: Arizona‚Äôs senator are federal (I.e. American) officials.
@KekistanJarhead We did not overthrow anyone, nor did WE interfere. You‚Äôre conflating the United States, and Paul Manafort
@btrader @TEN_GOP Lol
#TrumpRussia troll account TEN_GOP spread propaganda before election‚Äîonly to turn around and ridicule the idea of Russian meddling afterward
@jendew400 @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha true... except he brought those people into the swamp in the first place!
Robert #Mueller did more to #DrainTheSwamp on Monday morning than @realDonaldTrump has done in a year.
@KekistanJarhead Sjw?
@KekistanJarhead Haha dude one of the reasons he was indicted is because there was no lobbying report
@KekistanJarhead Lol. Because this is the United States. A pro-EU Ukraine is our policy, because it‚Äôs in our best interests. #AmericaFirst?
@KekistanJarhead @realDonaldTrump The US legal system is based on fair and unbiased trials. Trump‚Äôs comments prejudice trials. That‚Äôs basic American law.
Reckless tweeting by @realDonaldTrump is literally helping an ISIS-inspired terrorist avoid #Justice at trial. Incredible. #NYCAttack
@KekistanJarhead Lol that‚Äôs a very cynical view of the United States
@KekistanJarhead A statement by a lobbyist is not official interference, no.
@KekistanJarhead And I firmly believe that there is plenty of justice to go around, to crooks on both sides of the aisle. This is not a political issue
@KekistanJarhead Official foreign policy is public; it‚Äôs the State Department. That means US diplomats traveling and talking with foreign officials
@KekistanJarhead Sorry, I thought you were saying Mueller uncovered US state interference in Ukraine‚Äôs democracy, which is also untrue
@KekistanJarhead This indictment itself does not suggest Trump-Russia collusion, and I‚Äôm not suggesting it does lol
@KekistanJarhead Yeah dude I know! I see the indictment as Mueller duly pursuing unrelated crimes he discovered while investigating something else
@Amniot I greatly appreciate your skepticism and unwillingness to blindly criticize, though!
@Amniot I personally don‚Äôt think that interpretation of his response to a situation having nothing to do with Europe makes sense
@KekistanJarhead Yes and yes. Not sure what your point is‚Äîno one is denying that Manafort, Gates, and Podesta were paid to advance Yanukovich‚Äôs position
