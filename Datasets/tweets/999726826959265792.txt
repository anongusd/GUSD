@sarahgj_ @KaitMarieox I just explained My opinion about that statement 😁👍 Did You Read it?
@sarahgj_ @KaitMarieox A Crime, She deserves Community Service and Probation!
@sarahgj_ @KaitMarieox I understand, as a Woman You do not want a random Man just coming up to You to Kiss You, I don’t advise any man to ever try to pull that Movement! Lol 	Still didn’t make it right for the person to vandalize something She had no property of, That’s A Misdemeanor
@Brad_Tweetin @KaitMarieox The Me too Movement Individual That did this was wrong, The woman He kissed didn’t  take it as Sexual Harassment!  😒
@sarahgj_ @KaitMarieox He Kissed Her, She liked it.	I do not see it as disrespectful or as some sort of Sexual Harassment.
@Brad_Tweetin @KaitMarieox Yes this was very Disrespectful. I would hate to see the one in My City Vandalized with a movement that has nothing to do with the statue’s meaning.

@ZoiesGrandma @EdKrassen @Futures1973 @realDonaldTrump Yes, I agree. The Population Of Immigrants Claiming Asylum Has Increased Since October. It’s Sad. I just don’t Understand why They can’t be treated like Regular Human Beings, They aren’t animals. Many of them have nothing to do with Drug Trafficking.
@ZoiesGrandma @EdKrassen @Futures1973 @realDonaldTrump This just increases the Homeless Population here in San Diego. They are also at risk of getting their Kid’s stolen and sold to Human Traffickers. I understand They should know the consequences of Trying to come over illegally, Doesn’t mean  They are Animals!
