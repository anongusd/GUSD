And it‚Äôs why we absolutely must send @VoteDannerKline to Congress because his agenda doesn‚Äôt come from a think tank or a donor but it comes from the kitchen tables of the working men and women of District 6 #alpolitics
It‚Äôs why we need @peter_joffrion in Congress understanding and working on the issues that affect the 5th District. He‚Äôll place people over party and results over rhetoric as he‚Äôs done his entire career #alpolitics
This is also why we must have @LeeAuman2018 in Congress because he knows the needs of the 4th District and he‚Äôll represent a new generation that isn‚Äôt beholden to the corporate DC donors that hold his opponent captive #alpolitics
We‚Äôve got to have @HaganforHouse representing the 3rd Congressional District bc she‚Äôll show up, she‚Äôll listen, and she‚Äôll represent more than the DC donors. #alpolitics
It‚Äôs why we need @TabithaK representing the Wiregrass in Washington DC. She‚Äôll govern like she has campaigned: being accessible to her constituents and keeping voters needs at the top of her priority list #alpolitics
We must have @Kennedy4Alabama in Congress to represent the people of South AL. As a veteran, he understands public service is about results and not just walking the line of the party bosses. #alpolitics
It‚Äôs why we‚Äôve got to have @VoteMirandaJ as our next state auditor. She‚Äôs the only candidate with the qualifications, the experience, and the desire to serve the people instead of the party #alpolitics
We need @willboydforAL as our Lt. Gov and a voice in the AL Senate for the issues AL voters care about most: ending corruption, better infrastructure, stronger public education, and more efficient and affordable healthcare for all Alabamians #alpolitics
It‚Äôs why we must elect @VoteCaraMcClure and  @electkaripowell to the Alabama Public Service Commission. They‚Äôll defend the utility ratepayers of AL instead of being a rubber stamp for increased utility profits. #alpolitics
That‚Äôs why we need @MilamForAL as our Secretary of State. She understands that voting is a right and not a privilege. She will fight for early voting, automatic registration, and will respect all her constituents, Republican and Democrat #alpolitics
That‚Äôs why we need @JoeSiegelman as our Attorney General. Advocating for the people of Alabama, instead of siding with the corporate and special interest who want to purchase political favors. #alpolitics
That‚Äôs why we need @BobVanceJr and @DonnaWSmalley on the Supreme Court. They‚Äôll treat everyone fairly, no matter their race, income, or political influence. They‚Äôll leave their politics at the door when they put on the robe. #alpolitics
I love my job bc I get to go out and meet the real people of Alabama. On the campaign trail we meet the people behind the headlines &amp; the statistics, people who #believe that AL can do better and want leadership that will take us there. That‚Äôs why we need @WaltMaddox #alpolitics
