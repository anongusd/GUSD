@buffalocharging @mikebhungry @adamzyglis @TheBuffaloNews Bc he likes to make broad sweeping statements on most things. Just an all around hater
@WBFO @RepBrianHiggins Who didn't vote?
@B_Lo_Beatdown @ThuyLanWKBW @WKBW Noted
@B_Lo_Beatdown @ThuyLanWKBW @WKBW OK
@B_Lo_Beatdown @ThuyLanWKBW @WKBW A few but that's not the point. U telling ppl to get a life bc they care about their community is ridiculous and what's wrong with Buffalo
@B_Lo_Beatdown @ThuyLanWKBW @WKBW This affects our lives
@kevinhardwick Thank you for speaking at @LU_Progressives meeting. Hope to work with you in the future

@LU_Progressives @NY31Alcantara Called her office &amp; was told shes still 100% committed 2 NYHA but didnt want 2 hold budg up ne longer Much better exp than @JacobsforSenate
@NYSenatorFelder Have you reached a position on #NYHealthAct yet? https://t.co/sBPsKs7PmP
@MayorByronBrown Investing in the east side promotes equality and progress for those left behind by you. @MarkforBuffalo cares #PoliticalRevolution #Buffalo
@MayorByronBrown Who cares. Why do you ignore the needs of the East Side? I don't think @MarkforBuffalo will...
