Today I participated in the Rockford Ministers Fellowship community celebration honoring Dr. King. The fight for equality still continues to this day. As we remember the legacy of Dr. King, we must redouble our efforts to achieve his vision for social justice and equal rights. https://t.co/Yffas4XwW1
@thepatrickross @daveweigel @TammyTammy2020 As long as Tammy is at the top of the ticket! https://t.co/qmOG1rkcDO
Today is the 6th anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, a tragic reminder that we've not done enough to enact meaningful gun control. In fact, 2018 has been the worst year for school shootings to date. We must redouble our efforts to end this epidemic of violence.
I look forward to working across the aisle to get the bill passed into law. It is a great example of what bipartisanship can accomplish.
Yesterday the Senate unanimously passed the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act, a bipartisan bill I introduced with @SenatorDurbin and @SenJohnKennedy to help grow Veteran-owned businesses that will create jobs &amp; strengthen our economy.
I know well what it’s like to live with a disability. Please join me in recognizing the International Day of Persons with Disabilities today. You can read more about it here: https://t.co/g96KA8hmex
Rest in peace President George H.W. Bush. While I did not always agree with him, his lifelong commitment to public service will continue to inspire generations to come. May that legacy bring comfort to his family at this difficult time.
Trump’s daily horrors didn’t rest once Election Day ended. Neither can we. 		Our November deadline is at midnight. Please contribute today to help us reach our $11,000 goal. https://t.co/i4W1nmLAvF

Today is #BlackWomensEqualPay Day. It is the day when the average black woman finally earns what the average white male earned LAST YEAR. It is time my colleagues join me in taking action to close this wage gap.
I am voting no on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. His radical interpretation of the Constitution and unwillingness to defend individual freedoms and legal protections, as well as his willingness to empower an unchecked President to act above the law, are disqualifying.

Serving my fellow Veterans is my life's work. As senator, I will make sure our Vets get the best care &amp; receive the benefits they earned.
When our nation asked them to serve, our Vets didn't hesitate. We have a solemn obligation to fulfill our promises to them in return.

A lot of Americans are hurting right now, and we need to get to work them. (2/4)
Across IL, people have told me that they hear the economy is growing, but they're not seeing it in their communities. (1/4)

Trump's comments on sexual assault in the military are disgraceful. He is unfit to lead the men &amp; women who honorably serve our nation.

Throughout his career, Mark Kirk has been quick to sound the drums of war - and he has been tragically wrong. #ILSEN
Mark Kirk’s not a fiscal conservative. He’s a fiscal phony. #ILSEN
When it comes to social moderation, it seems like Mark Kirk is only there when you don’t really need him #ILSEN
It's time to seriously invest in our infrastructure, including replacing lead pipes nationwide. It's needed &amp; will create good jobs #ILSEN

For the 21st century, Illinois should be a leader in the renewable energy revolution #ILSEN
I'm working to give small businesses - the backbone of our economy - the same advantages as multinationals #ILSEN

Watch &amp; RT: What took Mark Kirk so long to disavow Trump? #StillTooRacist #StillTooSexist #ILSEN	https://t.co/97HopxxzdE
Kirk endorsed Trump despite a long list of #StillTooRacist remarks. And Kirk's own history of offensive rhetoric makes him unfit for #ILSEN
A month ago, Mark Kirk even called Trump a "net benefit" to his campaign - despite Trump's racist &amp; bigoted remarks #StillTooRacist #ILSEN
When Trump mocked a journalist with a physical disability, that still wasn't offensive enough for Kirk #StillTooRacist &amp; #StillTooBigoted
Mark Kirk didn't object when Trump called for punishing women who have abortions or attacked Megyn Kelly #StillTooRacist #StillTooSexist
Kirk called a fellow senator a "bro with no ho" &amp; didn't object when Trump called women fat pigs &amp; dogs #StillTooRacist &amp; #StillTooSexist
Kirk, who called for the mass arrest of 18,000 African Americans, was apparently fine w/ Trump's #StillTooRacist call for mass deportation
Kirk was ok w/ Trump's #StillTooRacist lie about U.S. Muslims celebrating 9/11 &amp; also said a letter to Iran would "bounce off their turbans"
Kirk's repeatedly called @POTUS "Barack Hussein Obama," so no surprise he thought Trump's #StillTooRacist birther hype was ok #ILSEN
Trump's #StillTooRacist proposal to ban Muslims didn't cost him support from Kirk - who said "I'm OK w/ discrimination v. young Arab males"
When Donald Trump called Mexicans rapists, that was #StillTooRacist. But Mark Kirk didn't let it stop him from endorsing Trump #ILSEN
Yesterday, Kirk called Trump's attacks on Judge Curiel “TOO racist &amp; bigoted” - as if any racism &amp; bigotry were ok #StillTooRacist #ILSEN

Any politician, Mark Kirk included, who stays silent, or hopes to fly under the radar, is complicit in Trump's campaign of hate and division
Trump’s statements are outrageous &amp; un-American. They betray the weaknesses of a man who is fundamentally unsuited to the Presidency.
No matter where any of us comes from, we are Americans, we are in this together, and our love of this great country is sincere.

Mark Kirk should immediately say whether he supports the Constitution, or if he’ll rubber stamp McConnell’s obstructionist gambit.
That oath does not cease in an election year or when a political party that lost the last Presidential election wishes to impose a do-over.
As a Congresswoman &amp; as an Army officer, I swore an oath to support &amp; defend the Constitution of the United States.
I'm disappointed in McConnell’s pronouncement that the Senate will refuse to perform its Constitutional role regarding any SCOTUS nominee.
While I frequently disagreed with Justice Scalia’s rulings, I’m saddened to hear of his passing and send my condolences to his family.
Mark Kirk's irresponsible rhetoric only helps ISIS frame the conflict as a war between the U.S. &amp; Islam, fueling recruitment. #ILSEN
Or when he said the letter he &amp; 46 other Republicans sent to Iran last year “will just bounce off their turbans” #ILSEN
It's not just fear-mongering over Syrian refugees - it's also all the times he's called the president "Barack Hussein Obama" #ILSEN

I held a press conference @ChicagoState today to talk about Gov. Rauner's failure to keep the school funded: https://t.co/rp2QjTby3c
You can count on me to stand up for working families, and against the cruel, counter-productive Rauner-Kirk agenda.
Rauner &amp; Kirk believe public universities &amp; helping working &amp; middle-class people afford college are giveaways. But they're an investment.
A quality public education — for every child, in every community — is a fundamental American right, not to mention a good investment.
In Congress, I helped introduce the Student Loan Relief Act of 2013, &amp; as a senator I will make access to higher education a key priority.
Mark Kirk opposes student loan relief, free community college &amp; Pell Grants. The Kirk/Rauner agenda is anti-affordable higher ed.
Other colleges are taking emergency measures. Layoff notices may be coming @EIU &amp; @WesternILUniv. #MAPGrants recipients are worried.
.@ChicagoState is a gateway 2 opportunity 4 some of Chicago’s most disadvantaged kids, but b/c of Gov Rauner, it's a month away from closing

New moms are too often stuck without a place to breastfeed while traveling. Let's fix that: http://t.co/hRdKsrn7N7
I don’t ever want my crew to look at what I’m doing &amp; be ashamed. So every day I dedicate myself to doing more to make them proud.
Lifting one another up doesn’t cost nearly as much as leaving other Americans behind. I'm here today b/c my buddies didn’t leave me behind.
It's nice to mark Mother’s Day &amp; Memorial Day. But it’s wrong to ignore the sacrifice of our moms &amp; military families the rest of the year.
Equal pay &amp; paid maternity leave aren’t just women’s issues - they are economic issues.
The only way I could have Abigail was through in vitro fertilization. No woman should ever lose her job for trying to start a family.
Moms who travel need a clean place to breastfeed. So I introduced a bill to require airports to provide lactation rooms.
I didn’t think I would be able to be a Mom. My little girl is truly a miracle &amp; she has made me a better public servant.
I was proud to lead the fight against a GOP-led effort to delay protections that keep predatory lenders from preying on military families.
Most of our Vets suffer from wounds that are not visible. So I passed legislation to improve Veteran mental health care.
One of my 1st pieces of legislation was the Troop Talent Act, which helps Vets get the civilian certification for jobs they have mastered.
It dishonors us all each time a Vet sleeps on streets he risked his life to defend. @DeptVetAffairs, we cut the # of homeless Vets by 1/3.
When companies do the right thing, we should recognize that. So we passed a tax credit for businesses that hired returning Vets.
At @ILVetsAffairs, we started the 1st-in-the-nation, 24-hour crisis hotline for Vets b/c anxiety &amp; panic don’t just happen 8-4:30 weekdays.
At Walter Reed, I was looking for a new purpose in life. Taking care of Vets became my way of giving back for the second chance that I got.
I got a second chance at life. I view my time now as a bonus. That has allowed me speak up without fear &amp; stand up for what I believe.
What my crew did was nothing short of heroic, to carry what was left of me to safety so they at least could return my body to my family.
On Memorial Day, I also think about those who gave everything just short of their lives &amp; of my crew who risked theirs to pull me to safety.
I'm excited to speak @CityClubChicago today! Keep following for live-tweets from my speech! #talkcityclub
Good luck tonight, @NHLBlackhawks!

I want others to love &amp; benefit from the military as much as I have. That's why I want to remove sexual assault from the chain of command.

It's about being a servant to the public you represent. #debate8
I have to look in the mirror every and live up to the heroism of the men who rescued me in Iraq. #debate8
When you're part of a unit, it's not about an individual, it's about the mission and banding together to get things done. #debate8
We need to be willing to come together as Democrats &amp; Republicans and not demonize or confuse people. #IL08
I'd support GOP Rep. Sullivan's bill to give tax credits to companies - like the ones in #IL08 - that retrofit cars to burn natural gas.
The keystone pipeline would send oil to China and profits back to Canada. It's a bad deal for Americans. #debate8
RT @Spiderwort52: @Tammy4Congress My friends in Schaumburg don't want to pay Walsh's extra $1500 taxes, neither do me or my husband. Sta ...
One idea to create more jobs - from the mostly GOP mayors I've talked to - is to pass transportation bill that Walsh voted against. #debate8
Let's help businesses get access to capital, provide a tax credit for hiring long-term unemployed &amp; reward companies that keep jobs here.
I think the unemployment rate is still too high and we have a lot of work to do. #debate8
My mom lives on the federal pension my dad worked for. That pension is her dignity. I will be a strong advocate for keeping our promises.
I have lived my entire life defending people's rights. I'm not going to be part of taking rights away from people. #debate8
Voter ID laws are a red herring. There are no real cases of voter fraud. They disproportionately disenfranchise the poor. #debate8
Walsh says "he'll seriously think about" eliminating mortgage deduction. He's said before he'll repeal it. #debate8
Walsh supports privatization of the post office. Tammy's answer? "Two words: heck no!" #debate8
The average family in Schaumburg would pay an additional $1500 in taxes if Walsh has his way. #debate8
Walsh's solution is to reduce Romney's capital gains tax to 0% while eliminating mortgage tax credit that helps middle-class. #debate8
Tammy on working with GOP: I support Rep. Roskam's bill that looks at fraud in Medicare. #IL08
Helicopter company that received federal investment at height of recession started making windmills &amp; doubled number of employees #debate8
Don't forget to text questions for Tammy or Walsh tonight to 64636, using the code "debate8" #debate8
It's time for serious talk and serious action, not games. #debate8
I think you've just seen classic Joe Walsh grandstanding. #debate8
Voting 37 times to repeal ObamaCare does not get us anywhere. #debate8
RT @1kecko: .@Tammy4Congress is dominating this debate!! #IL8
There are things that can be done in DC, but they can't be done when Members of Congress are yelling and screaming at each other. #debate8
At VA we were able to reduce waste in software projects that were over budget and saved taxpayers over $30 billion. #debate8
Ending the Dept of Education and getting rid of all Pell Grants, affordable education &amp; federal standards is not the solution. #debate8
The only person here who's trying to get re-elected is Mr. Walsh. #debate8
RT @meganmekel: @Tammy4Congress good luck Tammy! :)
Walsh wants to "cut off foreign aid to every single country" #debate8
When America is attacked, we unite. We form one group and we stand and oppose terrorism wherever it is in the world. #debate8
When we expend precious resources - the men and women who wear the uniform - we must do it responsibly. #debate8
Israel is our greatest ally and the only true democracy in the Middle East. #debate8
Walsh: I would get rid of the Department of Education tomorrow. #IL08
You are the status quo in Washington, Congressman. #IL08
Let Medicare negotiate for prescription drug prices, like we did at the IL VA. #debate8
I just proposed $2 trillion in cuts. I haven't heard any proposals from Walsh. #debate8
@dawnerv yes, at http://t.co/HznLCdwM
We need to go after government waste. $9 million a day wasted in unsupervised defense contracts. We simply cannot do that anymore. #debate8
You cut where you need to cut, but we must protect investments in our future, our most vulnerable and our small businesses. #debate8
There 2 trillion dollars in cuts I'm proposing right now. It's not enough, but it's a start. #debate8
For most of my adult life, I've worn one color. It's called camouflage. #debate8
RT @donjuanw: OMG! Tammy Duckworth is on fire at this debate #debate8
.@ChicagoTribune says Walsh has "fueled the political vitriol that has paralyzed Washington" #debate8
To bring jobs to the district, we need to invest in transportation infrastructure and in small businesses. #IL08
Not once has someone said, "Please, Tammy, turn Medicare into a voucher program like the congressman wants." #debate8
The issues I'll stress are the ones constituents have told me for the last 18 months are more important. #debate8
Walsh: I'm glad we're fighting right now. #debate8
RT @christianfic: Good luck @Tammy4Congress in your debate tonight!
The people of the 8th don't want to be yelled at anyone. #debate8
I do say roll up our sleeves and get to work, I do say compromise, cause that's what we need. #debate8
Walsh has voted against this district time and again. The choice is clear: do you want more of the same partisan gridlock? #debate8
When I've met with mayors, they've said the same thing: transportation, transportation, transportation. #debate8
When you're on your knees and you need a hand up and you're not willing to give up, we're not going to give up on you either. #debate8
You are practicing democracy, which is something precious in the world indeed. So thank you on both sides for coming out. #debate8

At last night's debate, Tammy promised to work with all sides to achieve results for the people of #IL08: http://t.co/nRIHFTL0
I hope to be able to serve my community and my nation in Washington. #IL08
Joe Walsh wants to get rid of the mortgage tax deduction while giving tax breaks to millionaires. #IL08
We should allow taxpayers with good credit to refinance their mortgages and support local community banks that are lending. #IL08
I'm not running to say yes to everything President Obama does and I'm not running to say no to Speaker Boehner either. #IL08
I will always place the needs of the 8th district above everything else. #IL08
Joe Walsh has been in Washington. He is the status quo. #IL08
Small business owners are saying "we've grown a bit, we've hired more people, but we need more help." #IL08
I don't understand why Mr. Walsh was the only congressman in Illinois to vote against the transportation bill. #IL08
Small business owners &amp; mayors all say the same thing: let's get back to work. #IL08
I live in the district and I'm all over the district. Just because you say something over and over again doesn't mean it's true. #IL08
I trust a woman to make a decision about her own body with her family, her doctor and her religious institution. @IL08
My question for Mr. Walsh: what was your reasoning for signing on to Todd Akin's bill to redefine rape? All rape is forcible. #IL08
Joe Walsh is against access to abortion even in cases of rape, incest and to protect the health of the mother. #IL08
This is a pretty complex issue. What the people in the 8th district want is real dialogue. #IL08
When you're a Member of Congress, your words carry the weight of your office. #IL08
Identifying specific towns with large Muslim communities put a lot of Americans who love this country dearly at risk. #IL08
We need comprehensive, sensible, and humane immigration reform. #IL08
We shouldn't be surprised when reckless words result in reckless actions. Members of Congress need to conduct themselves as such. #IL08
We need to remember that it's about serving everyone in our district. #IL08
My faith absolutely informs how I make decisions and how I conduct myself. #IL08
We don't need a 37th vote to repeal ACA, we need to roll up our sleeves and fix what's wrong with it. #IL08
We can't resolve this if we continue to demonize one another. #IL08
I am deeply concerned that there will be kids left out who don't get vouchers or don't get into charter schools. #IL08
I don't think the mayor is 100% right, I don't think the teachers are 100% right...The side I'm on is the children. #IL08
We can't let large coorporations like GE pay nothing while business in my district pay their fair share #IL08
We also need to look at defense spending...tax subsidies for oil and gas industries...there are a lot of places to look. #IL08
The Ryan budget, which Joe Walsh voted for 3 times, would get rid of the guaranteed Medicare benefit. #IL08
We need to look at fraud in Medicare and allow Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices #IL08
There have been very few instances of voter fraud...voter ID laws target the poor who can't afford to get an ID. #IL08
If we go to war, it should be as a last resort out of concern for the men &amp; women who will bleed for this nation. #IL08
Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. #IL08
Political statements on Libya from both the Romney &amp; Obama campaigns were "completely inappropriate." #IL08
On Libya: "This is a time for cool heads." #IL08
The bigger the obstacle, the more we need to work together. #IL08
If it wasn't for hard work, sacrifice, food stamps &amp; pell grants, I wouldn't have been able to go to college. #IL08
We'll also be live-tweeting tonight's debate with the hashtag #IL08. Join the conversation!

A lot of teachers at this afternoon's stop--great comments on education!  http://t.co/ojSG7om3
Great discussion at this morning's American Dream Tour stop about preserving Medicare  http://t.co/AOimPegV
Biggest take-away tonight: Walsh would end Medicare as we know it. Tammy will cut the deficit without hurting our seniors. #IL08
People need some wins right now and that's not what they're getting from Washington. #IL08
Before banks start handing out bonus checks, they need to allow responsible homeowners with good credit scores to refinance. #IL08
It might have been political expedient to change my position on immigration, but we need courageous leadership on this issue. #IL08
We need comprehensive immigration reform and whatever we do, it has to be practical, fair and human. #IL08
Tammy: I think what you've proposed at the national level is irresponsible and extremist. #IL08
What we need are practical solutions and leadership. I will work with anyone I need to. #IL08
I've spent my entire life living up to my responsibilities...I'm proud of the last 6 years I spent working for Vets. #IL08
Walsh cites as his biggest legislative accomplishment a bill that didn't pass.
Walsh has called Medicare "a ponzi scheme" and voted 3 times for the Ryan budget, which would end Medicare as we know it. #IL08
Walsh: I voted for the Ryan budget. Tammy: You certainly did. #IL08
We cannot balance the budget on the backs of our most vulnerable, but we certainly can look other places. #IL08
Small businesses in the 8th district are paying their fair share in taxes. Large corporations like GE should too. #IL08
Let's roll up our sleeves, find practical solutions, and make sure people in the district have access to health care. #IL08
In two years, Walsh hasn't introduced any legislation to create jobs that has passed the House. #IL08
We need an economy that will reward hard work and responsibility. #IL08
Walsh claims government has no role in creating jobs. #IL08
I've been meeting with people and business owners in the district and they need help. And there are places where government can help. #IL08
On contraception: Walsh was part of the committee that held the all-male panel and said hearing was "not about women" #IL08
Walsh just said he voted to raise student loan rates. #IL08
We need to preserve Medicare. We need to keep student loan rates low. It's about priorities. #IL08
Two other people in a loving relationship does not affect my marriage one bit. #IL08
I've always supported equal marriage. I would have been devastated if my husband had not been able to be with me at Walter Reed. #IL08
15 minutes until tonight's debate! Use #IL08 to follow the conversation.
The next American Dream Tour stop is at the Hanover Park library at 12 pm tomorrow. See you there!
Thrilled to join @MachinistsUnion District 8 at a rally to ask Caterpillar and labor to negotiate in good faith: http://t.co/MNPQtOg5
