One of the most chilling statements from Michael Cohen today: “Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020 that there will never be a peaceful transition of power, and this is why I agreed to appear before you today.”
The testimony of Michael Cohen alone suggests the president could be guilty of: 	—Conspiracy to defraud the United States.	—Lying to the DOJ &amp; the Special Counsel. 	—Campaign finance violations. 	—Encouraging perjury. 	—State &amp; local tax fraud.		Let that sink in.

Let’s get one thing straight: a president who “rejects the politics of revenge” does not threaten to jail his political opponents, mock his adversaries after their death, or use the government as a bargaining chip.
Ahead of the State of the Union address, here's a list of Trump's 30 biggest broken promises. https://t.co/1bKW3bJb30
Under Trump, GM has received more than $600 million in federal contracts, plus $500 million in tax breaks. This is generous socialism for the wealthy and corporations, cold, hard capitalism for American workers. https://t.co/0EXX2CJesp
When Trump crows about the wall, remember: 	1) Most Americans oppose it. 	2) Most drugs come in through ports of entry. 	3) Mexico won't pay, taxpayers will. 	4) Border crossings are at historic lows. 	5) There's no evidence of terrorists crossing the southern border.
Never in history has a president had more to say about something less urgent than Trump’s border “crisis.” Never has a president who says he’s seeking unity used a State of the Union address to so blatantly to divide.
If Trump and his enablers defy Congress to block the release of his tax returns, it would constitute an unprecedented level of obstruction. 		The federal government is not a firewall to protect the president from congressional oversight. https://t.co/X3PwWz21Xz
Tonight, when Trump mentions: 	— "Family values," remember children in cages. 	—"Fiscal responsibility," $1.5T in tax cuts for the rich.	—"America first," concessions to Putin &amp; Kim.	—"Border security," federal workers in bread lines.	—"Unity," attacks on Schumer and Pelosi.
Trump and his enablers would rather opponents focus on the ethnic, racial and gender differences he uses to divide and conquer, than the mounting power of the wealthy and corporations over our political system.

Until Reagan, buybacks were illegal. But now they have become the norm, last year exceeding $1 trillion. It is time to rein in this buyback bonanza, and get corporations to invest in workers, not pad their own nests. https://t.co/qYr26WmL8f
It is impossible to understand economics and politics without knowing history. Our current political-economic system is a consequence of what came before. There is no equilibrium. It is all reaction, response, vicious and virtuous cycles, and aspiration. https://t.co/G5mFdm3XWD
Trump has turned the EPA over to a former coal executive, the Department of Health and Human Services to a former pharmaceutical lobbyist, and now the Department of the Interior to a former oil lobbyist. 		This is government of, by, and for the lobbyists.
Over the last 4 decades, the median wage has barely budged. But the incomes of the richest 0.1% have soared 300% and the incomes of the top 0.001% (the 2,300 richest), by 600%. The net worth of the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans almost equals that of the bottom 90% combined.
National Emergencies Act gives Trump power to declare one, but also gives House and Senate power to terminate it. If House Democrats pass such a resolution, Senate GOP must vote within 36 days on Trump’s end-run around Congress’s power of the purse. (Another Pelosi Trump card.)

Pelosi forced Trump to reopen the government before negotiating over Trump’s wall, and to cancel the State of the Union. Does this make Trump weak? A loser? A wimp? Perhaps in Trump’s eyes. In reality, Pelosi has forced Trump to behave a bit like a President.
Any businessperson who backed out of an agreement to demand more money for a vanity project, grinding the company to a standstill, costing billions and ruining morale, only to ultimately take the same deal would go bankrupt...oh wait...
The Art of the Shutdown: 	1) Generate crisis at the border, deploying troops.	2) Back out of a deal, shutting down the govt. 	3) Spread lies on national TV, stoking fear. 	4) Throw tantrum.	5) Ask for less funding. 	6) Get nothing. 	7) Declare victory.
Nancy Pelosi just showed that Congress remains a coequal branch of government, despite Trump's refusal to accept the limitations of his own power.

The FBI opened an investigation into whether the President of the United States was working on behalf of Vladimir Putin to undermine American interests. 		That's the real national emergency, not the fake crisis Trump wants to distract us with at the border. https://t.co/09SrZCasRr
Under no circumstances should Democrats even suggest Trump declare a national emergency in explicit defiance of Congress’s constitutional power to appropriate funds. That would mark the end of democracy as we know it.
A genuine national emergency would require immediate action, but Trump is using the specter of an emergency declaration to threaten Congress during negotiations. This man has no respect for democracy. https://t.co/Bsl6PbaXrb
If the government shutdown continues for another 2 weeks, the total cost to the economy will exceed $6 billion, according to a new report. That's more than the cost of the wall. 		Trump is hurting the economy to feed his ego &amp; score political points. 		https://t.co/cMxHQMMMmA

800,000 federal workers won't receive paychecks due today. Tomorrow sets a new record for longest shutdown in history. Trump doesn’t care. To him, everything is about gaining leverage to win, at whatever the cost to working people, the U.S. government, our democracy, our economy.

Real border crisis is due to lack of resources to process asylum requests of thousands of mostly women and children coming to the U.S. to escape violence in Central America, under the legal immigration system. Fixing this would cost a fraction of the cost of building a wall.
The Art of the Shutdown: 	1) Promise to build a wall, claiming Mexico will pay for it. 	2) Get rebuffed by Mexico. 	3) Generate crisis at the border, deploying troops.	4) Back out of a deal, shutting down the govt. 	5) Spread lies on national TV, stoking fear. 	6) Throw tantrum.

On one side: truth, tolerance, equal protection, the rule of law, freedom of the press, democracy. 		On the other side: lies, hate, racism, rule by a strongman, vile propaganda, and authoritarianism. 		Rarely in our history has the choice been so stark. America will soon decide.
It is time to renounce the fearmongering and race-baiting that has engulfed this land. It is time to affirm that we are a tolerant and courageous people – not bigots and fearful cowards Trump has made us out to be.
A party that limits the right to vote, uses women and children to stoke hatred and fear, cuts taxes to boost their campaign coffers, and deploys the military for a political stunt has no place in government.
The Republican Party has lost its right to govern. The party now stands for nothing but Trump’s abuses of power, Trump’s nativism, and Trump’s budget-busting tax cuts. It has become the party of Trump.

6) Research the candidates. Spend some time looking into candidates on the ballot. Make an informed decision. 		7) If you've already received your ballot in the mail, but still haven't filled it out. Stop reading this and do it right now.		8) Ignore the polls.
4) Have a photo I.D. ready. States are making it increasingly harder to vote by instituting I.D. requirements. Don't be caught off-guard.		5) If you live in a state with early voting, vote early to avoid lines on Election Day.
2) Make time to vote. Know when your polling place opens and schedule enough time to cast your ballot. 		3) Call friends and relatives to encourage them to vote. The most powerful way to motivate others is the personal touch.
We are on the verge of the most consequential election of our lives. Here are 10 things you can do in preparation to take back our democracy: 		1) Find your polling place. Know exactly where you need to go ahead of time.

Make no mistake: The upcoming election is about Trump’s demagogic use of fear and hate, versus American decency and democracy. All of us -- Republican, Democratic, independent, young, old --must repudiate Trumpism next Tuesday.
If you need any more clarity about what's at stake this election, consider chants that can be heard on the campaign trail: 	Trump rally: "Lock them up!" 	Obama rally: "Vote, vote, vote!" 		We are engaged in a struggle for our democracy. We must defend it at the ballot box.

Sens. Collins, Murkowski, &amp; Flake: 		You have heard Dr. Ford’s testimony. You have reviewed the information she has provided, including a polygraph report. She has identified an eye-witness. She’s prepared to cooperate with FBI investigators. 		History is watching.
Senate Republicans have 3 options: 	a) Call on the FBI to investigate the allegations. 	b) Expand the Senate inquiry, subpoena Mark Judge.	c) "Plow right through," discrediting Dr. Ford's testimony, insulting the women of America, and reinforcing a culture of silence.

I hope today’s hearings convince a critical mass of American women to do what must be done November 6, to give themselves a firm and clear voice to empower themselves at a time when the President, the majority of Congress, and a majority on the Court intend to disempower them.
Brett Kavanaugh showed himself to be a vicious partisan – a Trump-like figure who suspects left-wing plots against him, who refuses to take responsibility for his actions, who uses emotional bullying and intimidation to get his way.
Dr. Ford was poised, articulate, clear and convincing. No one who witnessed her testimony and her responses today can conclude that she failed to tell the truth. More than that: She radiated self-assured power.
On the other side of today's drama was the power of women with the courage to tell what has happened to them, to demand an end to white male privilege, and to preserve and enlarge their constitutional rights.
Make no mistake: The drama in the Senate today was about power. On one side, the power of men who harass or abuse women and get away with it, the power of privileged white men to entrench their power on the Court, the power of men to take away a woman’s control of her own body.
This clip struck me as especially telling:		Durbin: Will you support an FBI investigation, right now? 		Kavanaugh: I will do whatever the committee wants to do. 		Durbin: Personally, do you think that's the best thing for us to do? 		Kavanaugh: **silence** https://t.co/ZE1QPKZcWU
"Kavanaugh's hysterical and aggressive testimony not only calls into question the legitimacy of his claims, but also demonstrates a temperament unbecoming of Justice on the Supreme Court." 		(If Kavanaugh were a woman)
"I welcome any kind of investigation*" -- Brett Kavanaugh 		*Except by the FBI
I repeat: https://t.co/JVW4BZa5fx
Kudos to Dick Durbin for getting to the heart of this. Devastating line of questioning. https://t.co/Ski0rckuFy
I remember the Bork hearings. I remember the Thomas hearings. This is the most painful. Kavanaugh is directly insulting at least half the population of the United States.
"Calculated and organized political hit... pent-up anger against Trump... revenge on behalf of Clintons... millions from left-wing opposition groups." Could this man ever be an impartial and unbiased member of the Supreme Court?
Kavanaugh says that because of the charges leveled against him he can no longer be a teacher or coach. But he can be a Justice of the Supreme Court?
Kavanaugh didn't offer a word of sympathy or concern for women who have been sexually harassed or abused. It was all about him -- portraying himself as the victim of a partisan conspiracy. How can this man ever be a non-partisan justice?
Remember: As Kavanaugh continues to call the hearings a “circus” and demands due process, he has still not called for the FBI to conduct an investigation. There are experts who investigate these allegations every day, and he knows it.
Hearing Kavanaugh's emotional and indignant testimony, why doesn't he call for an FBI investigation? Doesn't he have an interest in clearing his name?
“Thanks to what some of you on this committee have unleashed I may never be able to teach again,” “I may never be able to coach again,” it's “enough to destroy a person’s life and career.” Wrong. The question is whether he will have a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.
RT @aterkel: This absolutely sounds like someone who will give liberal groups a fair shot before the Supreme Court.
RT @Lawrence: Who told Kavanaugh that anger is the right tone?		Is Trump his media coach?
If Republican Senators still have any doubt about Dr. Ford's allegations, they could: 	--Call for an FBI investigation. 	--Subpoena Mark Judge.	--Allow the polygraph administrator to testify.	 	Otherwise, they're just casting aspersions to protect Kavanagh's nomination.
Dr. Ford's poise, discipline, and bravery was remarkable. Her testimony will give strength to countless survivors of sexual assault living in silence across America.

Suggestion to Dr. Ford for how to hold Republican senators accountable at her grilling on Thursday by the Republicans' “female prosecutor": Before responding to each question, politely ask which Senator has requested an answer to it.
Here's the bottom-line: 		1) Either McConnell and Grassley assume all these women are lying and don't deserve a full investigation. 	or 	2) They know the allegations are credible, but don't think sexual assault should keep Kavanaugh off the court. 		Both views are abhorrent.

4. And, of course, the lion's share of the gains from Trump's corporate tax cuts have gone to the top in the form of stock buybacks and executive bonuses.
3. Wages: Today’s hourly wage, adjusted for inflation, has less purchasing power than it did 40 years ago. In fact, adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage in January 1973 would be $23.68 today. Yet today's actual average hourly wage is $22.73.
2. Economic growth: The economy is now growing at annualized rate of 4.2 percent (that’s for the 2nd quarter). That’s not as good as the 5.1 percent and 4.9 percent achieved in 2 quarters in 2014, or the 4.7 percent in one quarter in 2011.
Trump is saying the U.S. economy is now better than ever in history. He’s lying again. Here’s the truth:		1. Job growth has actually slowed. In the last 19 months of the Obama administration the economy created 3.96 million jobs. In the first 19 months of Trump’s, 3.58 million.

How trickle-down economics really works: 		1) Trump and Republicans in Congress pass massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. 	2) Donors use their savings to help their lackeys stay in power. 	3) Republicans offer more tax cuts as the deficit explodes. 	4) Repeat. https://t.co/1fJbXNwDvP

Kavanaugh's nomination also has the stamp of approval from the Federalist Society, a conservative advocacy group with ties to major corporations and the Koch Brothers. https://t.co/GmN1c2sdfF
During his tenure on the bench, Kavanaugh has been a powerful ally for big business and Wall Street. Notably, he has challenged: 	1) Emissions standards for mercury and other pollutants. 	2) The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 	3) Net Neutrality.
Kavanaugh's nomination is a huge win for corporations and the GOP's donor class -- the culmination of decades of corporate efforts to stack the courts in their favor. We must make a ruckus to block his nomination.
Trump could pick Jeff Sessions for SOCTUS. It's the easiest way to get him out of the Justice Department, so that Trump can fire Mueller. And the Senate will confirm one of their own. (I hope I'm wrong.)

Remember when Trump said he was a no-nonsense manager who’d whip government into shape?

In all these ways, Shkreli defies what might be called “the common good.”
Shkreli's attitude toward the law is that anything he wants to do is okay unless it is clearly illegal (and even if it’s illegal, it’s okay if he can get away with it). He shows contempt for anyone who gets in his way—whether judges, prosecutors, or members of Congress.

Trump is not the cause of our loss of common good. He is the consequence -- the culmination of 30 years of "whatever it takes for me to make a fortune," "whatever it takes for me to get elected," and "whatever for me to come out on top." From my new book THE COMMON GOOD: https://t.co/Pbky4u3qOu
We know from history that tariffs inevitably lead to trade wars that hurt the economy. But Trump doesn't care about facts or analysis. We have never had a president so completely detached from reality.
The common good is a set of shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound together in the same society. A concern for the common good—keeping the common good in mind—is a moral attitude. It recognizes that we’re all in it together. https://t.co/bmHgdSqAHq

FACT: Immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than do U.S.-born citizens.
FACT: The earnings of workers at the federal minimum wage continued to decline in 2017, adjusted for inflation, as Trump and his enablers in Congress refused to raise the minimum from $7.25 per hour -- where it’s been since 2009.
FACT: The wages of blue-collar (production and non-supervisory) workers grew only 0.17 percent in 2017 – the slowest wage  growth for these workers in the past four years.
FACT:  Hourly earnings grew by only 0.4 percent in 2017. That’s less than the1.8 percent growth in 2015 and 0.8 percent in 2016.
FACT: The economy produced fewer new jobs in 2017 than in any year since 2010.
