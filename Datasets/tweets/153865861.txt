Gun violence costs each American taxpayer about $700 each year. This is not normal. Today, Congress will pass #HR8, a bill that will help save lives and help #EndGunViolence.
Nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of gun violence. Enough is enough. I am proud to vote today for #HR8, a bipartisan bill to keep our communities safe from gun violence by expanding universal background checks. #EndGunViolence
Today is a new day ‚Äì Congress is taking bipartisan action to keep communities safe by passing #HR8. We must #EndGunViolence because one life lost to gun violence is one too many.
Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed by a gun than people in other developed countries. That is unacceptable. Today, we will take historic action to #EndGunViolence by passing #HR8.
Background checks work: our current system has already stopped more than 3 million sales to convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers. Today, I am proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to help save lives by passing universal background checks. #HR8
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That‚Äôs why I am voting today to support #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks.
We can‚Äôt afford efforts to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue. Americans demand action to #EndGunViolence. We must make the Bipartisan Background Checks Act law. https://t.co/TVYDCcaMXq
More Americans consider the opioid crisis and climate change to be ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù than the situation at the southern border, but Trump has failed to address these issues and his policies have actually made them worse.

Despite Trump‚Äôs claims that other presidents have done this, no president in history has declared a national emergency to overrule Congress and the will of the people.
Trump‚Äôs fake national emergency is a gross abuse of power, a waste of taxpayer dollars, a danger to our national security, and a pointless distraction from the issues that matter most to working families.
Every member of Congress should back the House resolution to halt Trump‚Äôs national emergency. They took an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and Trump‚Äôs declaration undermines Congress‚Äô vote against funding his unnecessary border wall.
Today the House of Representatives is expected to pass a bipartisan resolution to block Trump‚Äôs national emergency declaration.

The American people have made it abundantly clear that Trump is alone in his quest to build a vast, ineffective border wall.
It also resolves troubling uncertainty for vital agencies and workers, and most importantly ends the threat of another pointless shutdown -- assuming our President doesn't change his mind again at the last minute.

It is critical that Trump joins our intelligence experts in speaking with a unified and accurate voice, in order to protect our national interests and keep our country safe.
Our nation‚Äôs top intelligence officials confirmed that Trump is ignoring, and even outright denying, some of the greatest worldwide threats. Trump is making us less safe.
North Korea is not moving toward complete denuclearization.	Iran is not in violation of the Iran deal.	Russia interfered in our election.	ISIS is not defeated.	Climate change is real and a national security threat.	The border wall is not a national security necessity.
Here are a few things top intelligence officials contradicted him on:
In response, Trump lashed out his top intelligence chiefs. Trump‚Äôs inappropriate criticism is dangerous and could undermine the public‚Äôs trust in the intelligence communities efforts to protect our national security.
In their report and testimony to Congress, the nation‚Äôs top intelligence officials contradicted Trump on some major foreign policy and national security issues.

Today, the House will consider H.R. 266, FY 2019 Interior-Environment Appropriations bill, a bill that is virtually identical to the bipartisan appropriations bill that Senate Republicans and Democrats passed in August by a vote of 92 to 6.
Democrats believe health care is a right for all, and we must build on our success in 2018 by beating Donald Trump, taking back the U.S. Senate, and electing more Democrats up and down the ballot who will fight to ensure that every American has access to the care they deserve.
Millions of Americans will pay higher premiums this year because of Trump and Republican sabotage, and millions more are priced out of the market and unable to afford coverage.

Working together, Democrats will honor the public‚Äôs trust, and put the power back in the hands of the people: (1) Reducing the role of big money in politics; (2) Advancing fair elections by strengthening the Voting Rights Act; (3) Restoring ethics and integrity to Washington.
The next day, Democrats unveiled H.R. 1: the For The People Act ‚Äì our transformative legislation to clean up corruption and return integrity to Washington, so that we can restore the people‚Äôs faith that government works for the public interest, not the special interests.
Last week, @TheDemocrats made history ‚Äì welcoming the most transformative, dynamic class in history to the Congress.  Now, we will deliver on our promise to the American people to work together to restore transparency, ethics, and unity to government.

Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions could face discrimination from insurance companies if the GOP‚Äôs lawsuit succeeds. The new Democratic House will protect health care for all Americans  #ProtectOurCare
Annual costs due to #ClimateChange could exceed $100 BILLION in the energy, agriculture and health sectors by the end of the century. Trump tried to bury these findings last week jeopardizing the health and wealth of the American people

The Affordable Care Act goes a long way to guaranteed coverage for all Americans. Instead of working with Democrats to bring costs down &amp; make the law work even better, Republicans worry about insurance profits &amp; have been sabotaging the law. #ProtectOurCare with a Dem Congress.
Republicans turned their back on seniors with planned cuts to Medicare &amp; Social Security to make up for huge tax cuts they gave the very rich. They also made it legal for insurers to discriminate against those 50+ by charging them up to 5x more based on age alone. #ProtectOurCare
Prescription costs are rising faster than any other area of health care. Democrats have a comprehensive plan to stop drug companies from fleecing working families with increases that make life-saving drugs unaffordable. If Dem win the majority, Congress will #ProtectOurCare.
Democrats continue to improve how the Affordable Care Act works for American families by bringing down the cost of insurance premiums and making coverage more accessible, including with Medicaid Expansion that Republicans blocked at the state level in the past. #ProtectOurCare
Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in part because many with insurance found they were not covered for specific illnesses when they got sick. The law brought fairness &amp; certainty, giving families peace of mind to know they are covered if they face illness. #ProtectOurCare
Republicans voted to allow insurance companies to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger people.  Now, older Americans are feeling the brutal pain of higher health costs from Republicans‚Äô health care sabotage and rising prescription drug costs. #ProtectOurCare
Republicans in Washington are putting in dire peril the health care of 130 million Americans with health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, mental illness or substance abuse ‚Äì including 68 million women &amp; girls nationwide, and millions of pregnant women. #ProtectOurCare
Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act, ending discrimination and denials for preexisting conditions for the first time in US history. Republicans worked loudly to end those protections for the last 8 years! Remember ‚ÄúRepeal Obamacare.‚Äù Vote for Democrats to #ProtectOurCare.
After voting to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions in their brutal #Trumpcare bill, Republicans are now claiming they *never voted to gut our health care*. This, in many circles, is known as a "lie".  #protectOurCare
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 17 million kids are no longer subject to lifetime caps in the cost of their care. For them, it can be the difference between life &amp; death. These kids are partly why Democrats passed health care reform as a matter of conscience. #ProtectOurCare
Republicans in Washington are running scared on the issue of health care. They see the writing on the wall. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre simply hoping people will fall for their careless lies about health care. #ProtectOurCare
No American should die because he or she rationed life-saving medicine or was forced to decide between vital medicine and food. Democrats agree that we can and must do better to reduce costs and improve our healthcare system. #ProtectOurCare
House Republicans have voted with one voice to repeal the ACA more than 65 times. ALL of those seats are up for election &amp; many have TV ads lying about supporting protections for preexisting conditions that come only from the ACA. Trust their record! Democrats #ProtectOurCare.
FACT: The Affordable Care Act has faced ruthless attacks from Republicans in Washington and from Republican governors &amp; state attorneys general. Now, Republicans are pretty much saying they‚Äôve never attacked our health care. #ProtectOurCare
Trump has drastically reduced the budget for getting information to Americans families about our health care coverage rights &amp; options. This sabotage raises premiums and increases the number of uninsured. Democrats want more of us covered, not fewer, and will #ProtectOurCare.
For 8 years, Republicans promised to ‚ÄúRepeal &amp; Replace‚Äù the Affordable Care Act. With 130M American relying on its protections for preexisting conditions, Republicans are hoping you forgot that &amp; will take their word today, not their word from 2010 ‚Äì Sept. 2018. #ProtectOurCare
Today, 130M Americans count on the Affordable Care Act's protections for preexisting conditions, but it protects ALL of us by ensuring our RIGHT to care from insurance companies that would prioritize profits over our lives. A Democratic majority in Congress will #ProtectOurCare.
We‚Äôre all one car accident or diagnosis away from needing protections for preexisting conditions created by the Affordable Care Act. The law prevents insurer discrimination and requires coverage of preexisting conditions. Democrats will #ProtectOurCare against Republican attacks.
The Affordable Care Act protects ALL Americans, including 130M who have a preexisting condition now, from ever being denied care &amp; accessible coverage. Republicans want to take us back to the days of insurance company denials. #ProtectOurCare by electing a Democratic Congress.
When Republicans are not running campaign ads lying about their health care record, they are in court actively trying to kill the Affordable Care Act and &amp; the protections it gives Americans with preexisting conditions. Democrats fought for the ACA &amp; will always #ProtectOurCare.
The #ACA protects ALL Americans from denials and hardship because of a preexisting condition. Without these protections, all of us would be vulnerable to losing or being priced out of the healthcare we need. We can #ProtectOurCare by electing a Dem Congress on 11/6.
When Republicans are not running TV ads lying about their voting record on healthcare, they are committed to their party‚Äôs promise to gut the #ACA and its protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Democrats fought for the ACA &amp; will always #ProtectOurCare.
Since the Affordable Care Act was passed 8 years ago, Democrats have fought consistent Republican sabotage of the law. Democrats can do even more to #ProtectOurCare and to improve how the law works for average families by winning control of Congress on 11/6. #TakeItBack
Vote for Democrats at all levels of government to #ProtectOurCare. Today, millions of Americans are denied access to affordable health care because we happen to live in states run by Republican governors and legislatures.
The Affordable Care Act protects the right of American families to meaningful, accessible, and affordable coverage. Republicans are more concerned with protecting insurance company profits. We need Democrats in charge to #ProtectOurCare from Republican sabotage.
When Republicans lie on TV about supporting Democratic policies they have fought against like protecting preexisting conditions, they accidentally show voters that they know the right thing to do but have chosen not to do it. Voters cannot trust Republicans to #ProtectOurCare.
Under Democratic control, Congress will work to bring down prescription drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate directly w/ drug companies; requiring drug companies to justify price increases; and holding companies accountable for shocking price hikes. #ProtectOurCare
When they did not get the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Trump &amp; Republicans in Washington resorted to sabotaging our healthcare system to create an excuse to try again. Voting for Democrats to take control of Congress will #ProtectOurCare from more Republican attacks.
Action speaks louder than words. And unfortunately for Republicans in Congress, their voting record shows they have consistently and viciously attacked protections for preexisting conditions under the Affordable Care Act. They are lying in TV ads about that now. #ProtectOurCare
Here‚Äôs something Trump will deliberately fail to mention tonight: he and dozens of Republican states are suing the court to ensure you no longer have protections for your pre-existing conditions. This is who they are. They don‚Äôt want to #ProtectOurCare.

HEALTH CARE: Trump and Republicans continue to sabotage the ACA. Their assault has increased health care costs for millions and made it less accessible.
TRUMP TAX: Trump &amp; GOP passed a bill that gives massive new tax breaks to big corps &amp; more than 80% of benefits to the top 1% by the end of the decade. CEOs have used these massive giveaways to further enrich themselves, but not to benefit their workers. https://t.co/ZhiaB5WahR
Trump fuels corporate greed and will always empower wealthy special interests. Trump‚Äôs most consistent policy is to help CEOs and rich corporations while hurting workers and families. Look at all he‚Äôs done so far:
A majority of Americans say the Trump tax law has not helped their family financially. https://t.co/i1kiZbGdcZ
64% of Americans say they have not seen an increase in their take-home pay from the Trump tax law. https://t.co/i1kiZbGdcZ
In fact, polling shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans say they have not seen their take-home pay increase as a result of the Trump tax law. It‚Äôs clear why more Americans still disapprove than approve of the law.
While Democrats are fighting for the people, it is clear who Trump and Republicans are fighting for. With each passing month, they continue to build an economy focused on rewarding wealthy corporations at the expense of working families.

Since President Trump signed the first Republican tax law, wages aren‚Äôt keeping up with inflation, health care costs are rising, and companies are laying people off and shipping jobs overseas. The second #GOPTaxScam is more of the same failed policies that don‚Äôt help workers.
As if the first version of the #GOPTaxScam wasn‚Äôt bad enough (remember: it raised the debt by $2 trillion), now the @HouseGOP want to hand tens of billions of $$$ in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1% every year.

Americans are already concerned about Trump's continued push to undermine the ACA. Now, we must also worry that Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee will gut the ACA entirely. #protectourcare
The Trump administration decided to end critical ACA subsidies that help reduce costs for lower-income Americans, despite knowing in advance that doing so would drive up health care premiums. #protectourcare
The Trump administration refused to defend the ACA‚Äôs pre-existing condition protections against a GOP lawsuit, a move that could threaten access to care for as many as 130 million Americans. #protectourcare
For the second time, the Trump administration slashed funding for programs that help Americans sign up for health insurance. #protectourcare
Despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans want to keep and improve the ACA, not repeal it, Trump has continued to sabotage the law. His latest attempt: short-term junk plans. https://t.co/4gJdN8bLGn #protectourcare
These junk plans wouldn‚Äôt be required to insure pre-existing conditions or cover benefits like Rx drugs &amp; hospital care. As a result, people who enroll in these junk plans cld find themselves locked out of care just when they need it most.  https://t.co/4gJdN8bLGn #protectourcare

The Trump administration promoted and expanded junk insurance plans that don‚Äôt include key ACA consumer protections, a decision that could undermine the insurance market and drive up costs for those who need health care.
For the second time, the Trump administration slashed funding for programs that help Americans sign up for health insurance. https://t.co/VCFE5AaxJC
The Trump administration refused to defend the ACA‚Äôs pre-existing condition protections against a GOP lawsuit, a move that could threaten access to care for as many as 130 million Americans.
Despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans want to keep and improve the ACA, not repeal it, Trump has continued to sabotage the law.
Democrats are offering A Better Deal for the people, with stronger health protections, better coverage and lower health care costs, including lower prescription drug prices, for American families.
The GOP health agenda means dismantling protections for people with pre-existing conditions, shattering the guarantee of Medicare and Medicaid and handing billions in enormous tax breaks to the same Big Pharma companies hiking prices on seniors and working families.
"Short-term plans are cheaper bc insurers can refuse to cover people w pre-existing conditions and limit coverage of services like mental health treatment. Short-term plans typically cap coverage, so customers can still end up getting socked with expensive medical bills."
POLITICO: Trump whacks Obamacare by boosting short-term health plans ---&gt; https://t.co/tp9Vas75sc
The GOP is now touting ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô health care, but the American people know the truth.  Under this rule, people with pre-existing conditions will face new discrimination and higher insurance premiums in the marketplaces.
These plans exclude people with pre-existing conditions, at the same time that open enrollment for ACA Marketplaces for 2019 begins this fall.
When it comes to sabotaging Americans‚Äô health care, Republicans just won‚Äôt stop. Today, Trump issued a final rule allowing for the massive expansion of so called ‚Äòshort-term, limited-duration‚Äô junk health coverage plans that don‚Äôt provide essential coverage.
Words aren‚Äôt enough. If @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP are truly committed to protecting our elections from Russia, they must allow Congress to increase funding that helps states secure our elections.
I will vehemently oppose #AderholtAmendment. Same-sex/LGBTQ-headed families are an integral part of our adoption and foster care system. Same-sex couples are 6 times more likely to foster children and 4 times more likely to adopt than different-sex couples #LicenseToDiscriminate

Unfortunately, the American people have seen that they cannot trust this president to put our national security over his own political interests ‚Äî he always puts himself first.
Instead of denying these facts, the Trump administration should take steps to protect our democracy and the American people ‚Äî that's what a leader would do.
DNI Dan Coats even compared the threat we face today with what U.S. intelligence officials said before 9/11: "Here we are nearly two decades later and I'm here to say the warning lights are blinking red again."
FBI Director Christopher Wray yesterday warned that ‚ÄúRussia attempted to interfere with the last election and that it continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day."
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have repeatedly confirmed that Russia interfered in our election, and Trump‚Äôs own appointees have warned Trump about Russia's work to undermine future elections. Yet, Trump continues to cast doubt.
1) Increase sanctions against Russia	2) Pass bipartisan legislation to secure election systems	3) End partisan attacks on DOJ, FBI, &amp; Mueller	4) Take action to protect Mueller's investigation	5) Demand that Trump insist Russians indicted last wk be sent to US to stand trial
It‚Äôs time for Republicans to hold Trump accountable, put country over party, and join Democrats in taking necessary action to defend against future attacks. Here‚Äôs what Republicans can do:
U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have repeatedly confirmed that Russia interfered in our election, and Trump‚Äôs own appointees have warned Trump about Russia's work to undermine future elections. Yet, Trump continues to cast doubt.
1) Hacked the Democratic National Committee.	2) Hacked the website of a state election board.	3) Stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters.
Trump‚Äôs repeated denials of Russia‚Äôs interference in our elections came just days after his own Justice Department charged 12 Russian officials for conspiring to interfere in our elections, charging that as part of this attack, the Russians:
Trump was asked if Russia continues its efforts to interfere in our elections, and he responded, ‚Äúno.‚Äù
The next day, Trump questioned our intelligence community‚Äôs finding that Russia interfered in our election, saying it could have been someone else.
In a press conference with Putin, Trump said he didn‚Äôt see any reason why Russia would be responsible for interfering in our election.
At least three times over this past week Trump has denied Russia‚Äôs interference in our elections and continuing threat to our democracy:
Republicans in Washington will stop at nothing to destroy the health coverage of people with pre-existing conditions. Democrats will continue to fight to #ProtectOurCare.

This is unprecedented. At no point in our history has an American president failed so spectacularly to stand up to a hostile foreign power.
The president, who is supposed to serve selflessly as our nation‚Äôs chief executive, even went as far as to blame America for Russia‚Äôs history of aggression and adversarial behavior. This logic defies all thinking.
Meanwhile, as Trump sided with Putin, his own Justice Department issued new charges against a Russian agent of working with Americans to carry out a secret Russian effort to influence the 2016 election.
Only days after Trump‚Äôs very own Justice Department indicted 12 Russian officials for interfering in our political process, the president eagerly put Putin‚Äôs interests in front of the American people.
The president is supposed to be in charge of protecting our country, and his dismissal of Russia‚Äôs attack is a failure to stand up for American democracy.
Time and time again, U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that Russia interfered in our election. Yet, Trump continues to side with a dictator over the dedicated patriots in our intelligence agencies.
This shameful performance was downright dangerous to our national security. Not only did Trump let Putin off the hook for attacking our country, he effectively invited him to continue meddling in our democratic process by refusing to demand that Russia stay out of our elections.
It‚Äôs time for Republican patriots to actually take action to stand up to Trump. The only way to protect America from our adversaries is to put country over party. We call on Republicans to stand up for the rule of law and hold this reckless president accountable.
The Russian government attacked our democracy in 2016 and the Democratic National Committee was a primary target of this attack. Those are the facts.
The American people deserve to know the truth and the special counsel's investigation is ongoing. The Kremlin's efforts to disrupt our electoral process have grave implications for our democracy.
Trump‚Äôs disgraceful performance at the Helsinki press conference made clear that he is unwilling to protect our national security and protect America from Putin‚Äôs Russia.

HOUSING: As Trump and his family make hundreds of millions from their real estate holdings, Trump has aimed to gut housing programs and make it more difficult for people to afford to put a roof over their head.
GAS PRICES: Meanwhile, higher gas prices have more than wiped out the extremely limited benefits that Republicans claimed the Trump tax passed on to working families.
DRUG PRICES: Pharmaceutical companies received an excessively large break from the Trump tax - disproportionate even to the huge breaks received by other wealthy corporations. Yet, drug prices continue to increase and Trump‚Äôs drug plan might make them even more expensive.
HEALTH CARE: Trump and Republicans continue to sabotage the ACA.  Their assault has increased health care costs for millions and made it less accessible.
TRUMP TAX: Trump &amp; the GOP passed a tax bill that gives massive new tax breaks to big corporations and more than 80% of the benefits to the top 1% by the end of the decade. CEOs have used these massive giveaways to further enrich themselves, but not to benefit their workers.
Trump fuels corporate greed and will always empower wealthy special interests. Trump‚Äôs most consistent policy is to help CEOs and rich corporations while hurting workers and families. Look at all he‚Äôs done so far:

If Donald Trump and Republicans get their way, millions of Americans will be at risk of losing their health coverage. These are our children, parents, grandparents, people with disabilities, and those who need health care the most.
No one should be discriminated against bc they're sick. That‚Äôs why we enacted historic protections for people w pre-existing conditions &amp; prevented insurance companies from charging people higher rates bc of health status. Americans overwhelmingly support these provisions
This is morally reprehensible. The Trump administration is refusing to defend the law of the land and going to bat for big insurance companies so they can once more deny health care to people with pre-existing conditions.

#Trumpcare was a sign of the @HouseGOP's immoral obsession with cutting off health care coverage for American families.
Our veterans fought for us -- but if Republicans got their way on #Trumpcare, NY veterans would have lost their Medicaid coverage.
NYers living with pre-existing conditions would have faced serious new costs if #Trumpcare became law. Thankful that did not come to pass.
Today marks one year since the @HouseGOP rammed through their shameful #Trumpcare legislation.
The president has set the tone for this wasteful spending by spending tens of millions in taxpayer money on his weekly excursions to his golf clubs and resorts.
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not just Pruitt - this is a pattern of corruption and abuse of taxpayer dollars that comes from the top and has spread across the Trump administration.
There are currently at least ten federal investigations related to Pruitt‚Äôs security practices, travel expenses, and other issues.
Amidst news of all these offenses, the federal government‚Äôs top ethics official even took the rare step of sending a letter to the EPA questioning Pruitt‚Äôs actions and asking the agency to take action to address any violations.
A government watchdog agency concluded that the EPA violated federal law in spending more than $43,000 to install a private phone booth in Pruitt‚Äôs office.
Scott Pruitt wasted more than one hundred thousand taxpayer dollars on first class airfare during his first year in office.
Pruitt reassigned EPA staff who questioned his lavish spending and outlandish requests, and then lied to Congress about it.
Pruitt went around the White House and took advantage of an obscure provision to give raises to two of his aides, and falsely claimed that he knew nothing about it.
The EPA signed off on a project for an energy company, which was represented by the firm that employs the lobbyist who has been linked to the Washington condo that Pruitt rented at far below market value.
The lobbyist husband of Pruitt‚Äôs landlord asked him for help getting three people recommended by his firm‚Äôs client appointed to an EPA advisory board.
One of Pruitt‚Äôs lobbyist friends on the verge of securing a $40,000 monthly contract with the Moroccan government helped arrange his controversial trip to Morocco, which cost more than $100,000.
Two key EPA aides facing an array of ethics investigations abruptly resigned Meanwhile, Pruitt faces at least 10 federal investigations.
Pruitt‚Äôs latest move to scale back the EPA‚Äôs use of science will sharply reduce the research the agency can rely on when crafting new protections for public health and the environment. Here‚Äôs just a sampling of recent headlines of Pruitt‚Äôs troubles:
Pruitt has led the Trump administration‚Äôs reckless dismantling of Obama-era protections, favoring industry and special interests over the environment he is supposed to protect.
Enough is enough. It is long past time for @EPAScottPruitt's tenure to end.  From cozying up to industry insiders, to wasting taxpayer dollars and breaking ethical norms, Americans cannot trust Pruitt and he should resign immediately.

The #GOPTaxScam exploded the debt by nearly $2 trillion ‚Äì and now the @HouseGOP wants to fill the gap by ransacking Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security. We can't let that happen.
We should balance out budgets by ensuring the wealthy and well-connected are paying their fair share -- not on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.
After exploding the national debt to hand massive tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP are moving to destroy our nation‚Äôs commitments to hard-working families. #GOPTaxScam

#PaycheckFairnessAct is part of the solution for #EqualPay, but we also need #paidsickdays, #paidleave, affordable #childcare &amp; #raisethewage to close the wage gap. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would help close the #wagegap by giving workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination. #EqualPayDay #talkpay
Moms earn 70 cents of what dads do each year. That means they have to work past Mother's Day to earn what dads earned last year.  #equalpayday
In workplaces where sexual harassment is not addressed, women may feel less empowered to negotiate salaries and raises, depressing long-term earnings and advancements. #MeToo #EqualPayDay
Over a 40-year career, the avg woman loses $418K to the #WageGap. But many groups of women lose so much more than that. We need #EqualPay now! #EqualPayDay #TalkPay
If the #wagegap closed, #AAPI women working full time, year-round would have enough money for nearly 1 additional year of tuition and fees for a 4-year public university or the full cost of tuition and fees for a 2-year community college. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/OnZBSFCspY
Unequal pay means less rent &amp; food on the table for working families. #equalpayday #talkpay
On average, women are paid just 80 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. For women of color, the #wagegap is much larger. #EqualPayDay #talkpay
#Equalpay is not just a women‚Äôs issue. It impacts our families, businesses, &amp; economy. #EqualPayDay
DYK: It's #EqualPayDay on April 10. Women must work 3 extra months just to earn the same pay as men #equalpay
Women who experience sexual harassment at work are 6.5x more likely to change jobs than women who do not ‚Äì often to a job of lower quality or with lower pay. #MeToo #EqualPayDay
Nothing could be more important than ensuring that all workers receive equal pay for equal work. It's time for #EqualPay.

There are certainly other ways for Trump to drain the swamp. But his Cabinet picks are proving a particularly stark example of where that effort has come up short.
Not all of these are created equal nor are they all scandal-level situations. They do highlight what's been a rocky year for Trump's Cabinet. Repeated controversies suggest administration isn't running a tight ethical ship or trying to keep Trump's promise to "drain the swamp."
Personal controversies (2):	Labor nom Andrew Puzder: Withdrew over concerns about employment of an undocumented housekeeper		HUD Sec Ben Carson: Ignored warnings about letting his son organize a "listening tour" which officials warned were to advance his children's business

RT @WAMCNews: Now on #MiddayMagazine: We speak with @PaulTonko about tonight's State of the Union. https://t.co/U5ctYvJLoq
Recy Taylor represents the voice of many marginalized women who have spoken up, spoken out and have long been ignored. Tonight her legacy lives through the many allies advancing the #MeToo movement. #SOTUBLACKOUT
Plain and simple -- @POTUS turned his back on the American worker. From a massive tax giveaway that does little to help the average family to making it less safe for those on the job, Trump failed! Workers deserve #ABetterDeal https://t.co/SOOPCeY67y
Work OT? Saving for retirement? Trying to get a raise? Trump doesn‚Äôt care. #AYearOfTrump: @POTUS &amp; his Wall Street cronies rolled back an Obama-era overtime rule that would have raised pay for more than 4 million hardworking Americans.
.@POTUS turned his back on America's workers, and his tax cuts will increase the very things he rallied against as a candidate ‚Äì sending MORE jobs overseas and increasing the trade deficit #AYearOfTrump #SOTU
Under @POTUS, American workers are less safe than they were a year ago. #OSHA conducted fewer inspections since Trump's inauguration thanks to Trump's budget cuts to @USDOL https://t.co/WLRi8RYeyz
Under @POTUS, subcontractors and franchisees are worse off if they get hurt on the job https://t.co/B3R27vnUjR
President Trump is master of ‚ÄúArt of the Fail‚Äù: Despite @POTUS‚Äô vows to save jobs, Carrier laid off 215 more workers from Indiana plant. Where was the great dealmaker when Indiana's workers needed him? https://t.co/RY6APxJ2ES
Trump failed on infrastructure. @POTUS promised all of us a ‚Äúbig beautiful‚Äù infrastructure plan in his first year. One year later... and we are still waiting. https://t.co/pfcTjODrKz
What happened to looking out for the little guy? @POTUS' lifetime appointment of @SCOTUS Justice Neil Gorsuch was a devastating blow to workers ability to negotiate a higher wage, with his record of ruling against them and siding with corporate interests.
When Trump says #AmericaFirst he really means corporations first. #AYearOfTrump = #GOPTaxScam stacks the deck against workers and families to give permanent benefits to the wealthy. 83% of the benefits go to the ultra-wealthy. @HouseDemocrats want to provide workers #ABetterDeal.
.@realDonaldTrump wants to make it easier for big banks to divest in underserved communities. We have to fight back. https://t.co/KOW3IiGSIM
What do you hope to hear from @realDonaldTrump in tonight's #SOTU? https://t.co/yhs8QK7tvJ #askhousedems
President Trump‚Äôs HHS weakened protections for nursing home residents. That‚Äôs what a #YearOfTrump means for seniors. #AYearOfTrump
The @USCBO predicted that the #GOPTaxScam would cause $25 billion in cuts to Medicare in 2019. #AYearOfTrump
The #GOPTaxScam raises premiums for 50-64 year olds ‚Äì an age tax they cannot afford. #AYearOfTrump
Medicaid covers 4.6 million low-income seniors, and President Trump just can‚Äôt seem to stop attacking the program. #AYearOfTrump
Remember when OMB Director Mulvaney said slashing Meals on Wheels funding would be ‚Äúcompassionate‚Äù? Seniors do. #AYearOfTrump
Candidate Trump promised he wouldn‚Äôt touch Medicare and Social Security. President Trump blew a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit that he‚Äôll use to go after our earned benefits. #AYearOfTrump
After President Trump and House Republicans drive up the deficit with their #GOPTaxScam, they‚Äôre going to turn around and slash programs like #Medicare, #Medicaid, and Social Security. #AYearOfTrump
Seniors and people with disabilities rely on Medicaid for long term care, yet Pres. Trump spent his first year trying to harm this vital program. #AYearOfTrump
#AYearOfTrump put seniors‚Äô earned benefits like #Medicare under threat. I‚Äôll keep fighting to they programs are protected.
#AYearOfTrump started with one of the darkest inaugural speeches ever given by a president. It will likely end with another speech full of threats and blatant falsehoods.
Main takeaway from #AYearOfTrump? The only major bill passed by the GOP is a #GOPTaxScam that raises taxes on the middle class in order to hand massive tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest 1%.
The @realDonaldTrump #GOPTaxScam amounts to a big cutback on tax credits for investment in affordable housing, just as many low-income #millennials are entering the rental market.
By cutting the mortgage interest deduction, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam makes it harder for #millennials ‚Äì especially in high-cost areas - to achieve the American dream of home ownership.
Too many #millennials are crushed by #StudentDebt, but all @realDonaldTrump has done is tried to kill the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program ‚Äì a step in the entirely wrong direction.
#Millennials benefitted from the Affordable Care Act, but @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs #GOPTaxScam undermines it and makes health care less affordable.
Climate change will cost future generations hundreds of billions of $$$ unless we act now. Instead of investing in our future, @realDonaldTrump is setting us back.
After #AYearOfTrump, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs agenda continues to cost young people dearly. #Millennials deserve #ABetterDeal - a promise of better jobs, better wages, and a better future.
Weighed down by #studentdebt, #millennials struggle to save up to buy a home or start a business. @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs agenda has just set them further back. Where‚Äôs his agenda for a brighter future?
From the #GOPTaxScam, to attacks on the Affordable Care Act, the real cost of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs reckless leadership will land on the backs of #millennials.
#AYearOfTrump has seen‚Ä¶	-A #GOPTaxScam that raises taxes on the middle class	-Republicans pushed the monstrous #Trumpcare plan	-@realDonaldTrump sow division &amp; chaos like it was his job
-Threats	-Blatant Falsehoods	-Bluster		That‚Äôs all Americans saw from @realDonaldTrump in the last year ‚Äì let's hope for something different tomorrow night. #SOTU

‚ÄòDuring 17-day shutdown of 2013, ‚Äòthe Republican Party‚Äôs favorable rating dropped 10 points in a matter of days, and it took a year to fully recover ‚Ä¶ It would take an act of extraordinary political agility to avoid a similar fate today.‚Äô ‚Äì Republican Pollster Whit Ayers [1/17]

Pass the bipartisan DREAM Act: Democrats are adamant that Congress must vote on the bipartisan DREAM Act immediately.
Saving Americans‚Äô endangered pensions: Millions of hard-working Americans‚Äô pensions are at risk, and Democrats are calling for bipartisan action to enact a responsible reform plan, introduced by Ranking Member Neal, that ensures these struggling pension plans will keep going.
Emergency disaster funding for all hurricane- and wildfire-impacted communities: Democrats are pressing for the urgently needed funds to heal the communities in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Island and all those impacted by wildfires.
CHIP and Community Health Centers: Democrats are calling for an immediate reauthorization of these vital initiatives ‚Äì one that does not steal from the health care of other children.
Additional veterans funding: Dems urge GOP to join us to provide urgently needed resources to vets facing a dire shortfall at the VA, meeting our responsibility to ensure no veteran is left behind or denied the care and opportunities they deserve upon return from the battlefield.
Funding for the opioid epidemic: Democrats are pushing to give communities the resources they need to fight the opioid epidemic, which is inflicting a savage daily toll on Americans in every corner of the country.
One-third of the non-defense domestic budget already goes to national security ‚Äì to veterans, homeland security, the State Department, and Justice Department counterterrorism initiatives.
Raise the caps: @TheDemocrats want a strong national defense. We also need an equal increase in our domestic budget, which includes critical national security functions &amp; commitments to hard working families.
Keep government open: While Republicans control the House and the Senate, and President Trump said earlier this year that ‚Äòour country needs a good shutdown,‚Äô Democrats want to keep government open.
Democrats are pressing for action on the critical, long-overdue and bipartisan priorities of the American people:
The Republican-controlled House, Senate and White House spent all of 2017 stacking the deck for privileged, the powerful and special interests.  Now, Congress faces a huge list of urgent, overdue priorities for the American people.
Explodes Debt by $1.8 Trillion, Targets Medicare &amp; Medicaid ‚Äì GOP has stuck our kids with the bill for their debt-exploding giveaways to the wealthiest, will use the debt they created to justify ransacking future of Medicare, Medicaid, education, veterans, &amp; working families.
$1.3 Trillion Tax Break for Corporations ‚Äì instead of simplifying the tax code or making it fairer, Republicans handed permanent tax breaks to big corporations, rewarded corporations shipping jobs overseas, and added even more loopholes for special interests to exploit.
Raises Taxes on 86 Million Middle Class Families ‚Äì the GOP tax scam‚Äôs meager, temporary benefits for the middle class evaporate in a few years, and the scam ultimately raises taxes on 86 million middle class families.
Gives 83 Percent of the Tax Cuts to the Wealthiest 1 Percent ‚Äì the GOP tax scam puts corporations and the richest ahead of everyone else.
A Quinnipiac Poll found that American voters reject the Republican tax plan 2 to 1,  with only 25% approving and 52% disapproving.  But Republicans defied their constituents to hand a massive tax break to their wealthy donors:

The Republican plan is a complete rip-off for middle-class families. In order to provide massive giveaways to billionaires and wealthy corporations, millions of Americans would see tax hikes under the Republican tax scam.
The final Senate #GOPtaxscam bill was so rushed that Republicans put it out in the eleventh-hour, even as it still contained illegible, handwritten notes crammed in the margins
Republicans know that their tax plan is a bad deal for American families, and that‚Äôs why the House and Senate both worked in secret to force through their tax bills..
The American people deserve to know how the Republican tax scam impacts their families. The GOP must return to regular order and debate their tax bill in an open and transparent process.
No matter how House and Senate Republicans reconcile the differences between their tax scam bills, any compromise between the two would be a disaster for American taxpayers.
Wondering how the #GOPTaxScam impacts you? This is necessary reading: https://t.co/L94AVHQrdV
Seniors and people with disabilities would be among the biggest losers from the #GOPTaxScam, and we‚Äôre not giving up without a fight!

Republicans have a responsibility to keep government open and confront actual priorities of Americans. They have control of the House, Senate and White House. They alone have the power to shut down or keep the government running.
RT if you agree that middle class families shouldn‚Äôt suffer while the millionaires &amp; billionaires are given a tax break. #GOPTaxScam
The #GOPTaxScam:		Step 1: Give tax breaks to the wealthiest and corporations. 	Step 2: Explode the deficit.	Step 3: Make American seniors and their families pay for it.
Who are some of the people the #GOPTaxScam hits the hardest?		Teachers	‚Ä¶ and seniors	‚Ä¶ and veterans	‚Ä¶ and students	‚Ä¶ and ppl w/ disabilities &amp; chronic illnesses
-Food Stamps	-Pell Grants	-Medicare	-Medicaid		The GOP will put them all on the chopping block after the #GOPTaxScam explodes the deficit.

There‚Äôs no time to waste. Congress needs to confront the issues facing our country. I look forward to continuing to work with my GOP colleagues to reach an agreement on keeping government open.
What‚Äôs on the chopping block if the #GOPTaxScam passes? Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other vital initiatives for millions of Americans.
The #GOPTaxScam gives tax cuts to big corporations while penalizing Americans caring for children with disabilities or parents with Alzheimer‚Äôs.
Republicans control the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives ‚Äì yet they‚Äôve spent the last 11 months running away from the actual problems facing American families.
This isn‚Äôt a time for GOP games. Congress needs to address the sprawling issues Republicans have been ignoring and keep government open. Anything less is unacceptable.

4) New Yorkers pay plenty in state and local taxes. We should retain our ability to make that deduction. #taxreform
3) We should incentivize research and development to foster growth in new ideas, businesses and jobs. That's how tax cuts help everyone.
2) The Bush tax cuts cost taxpayers $3.5 trillion and led to an economic crash. It was an experiment that failed by any standard.
1) Working families and middle class deserve tax breaks. Connected corporations &amp; ultra-wealthy individuals are doing just fine.
As I analyze any #taxreform plan, here are the five things I will keep in mind:
Many believe any plan, if one is released at all, will be a massive giveaway to billionaires &amp; wealthy corps to no benefit to middle class
When we're talking about people's wallets and the critical services they receive, we can't hide our plans and ambush voters or their Reps
Whenever that plan comes, a critical lack of details are making GOP leaders nervous about real #taxreform ---&gt; https://t.co/ekVxX0lZEv

@POTUS That is a figure, by the way, which has been dwarfed in six months by @realDonaldTrump's vacation spending to his properties.
@POTUS The average estimate of transgender specific health care in the military budget is ~$5million. That's about 0.011% of our defense budget.
@POTUS Recent studies contradict Trump‚Äôs claims, and showed minimal medical costs or disruption from transgender service members.
An estimated 4,000 transgender Americans already serve in the armed forces. It's a sad message sent by @potus, effectively kicking them out
... and they have received nothing but hostility from the Trump administration.
The transgender troops who serve proudly and bravely in our military deserve better, as do all members of the #LGBTQ community

@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump That's it. 5 things everyone should know about the #CBOscore of #Trumpcare. Thanks for making it to the end of this thread.
@SenateGOP Quite simply @SenateGOP's #Trumpcare bill falls far short in that regard. &amp; @realdonaldtrump's label of "mean" doesn't begin to describe it
@SenateGOP That should be our ultimate shared goal. Both GOP &amp; Dems. For the #ACA, the #BCRA or the #AHCA. To improve outcomes for patients &amp; providers
@SenateGOP Moving premium payments from actual care for patients to a company's bottom line does nothing to improve care. Nothing at all. #Trumpcare
@SenateGOP #Trumpcare repeals the 80/20 rule &amp; lets insurance companies rein in spending on actual care &amp; divert those $s to admin &amp; CEO pay
@SenateGOP #ACA makes it so insurance companies have to spend 80 cents of every $ they make on health care for enrolees. It's the "80/20" rule.
@SenateGOP 5)#Trumpcare takes premium dollars meant for health services and hands them to insurance companies. #cboscore
@SenateGOP I don't know why anyone would think low-income community has had it too good for too long, but clearly GOP has that mindset with #Trumpcare
@SenateGOP #CBOscore further projects the uninsurance rate to DOUBLE among people earning less than 200% of poverty because of this.
@SenateGOP #CBOscore finds that #Trumpcare would make costs so high that ‚Äúfew low-income people would purchase any plan‚Äù.
@SenateGOP #ACA has rules built in that make premiums, co-pays &amp; deductibles affordable for low-income families. #Trumpcare dissolves those rules.
@SenateGOP 4)Premiums &amp; deductibles would be so high for low-income community, no one could afford them. #trumpcare #cboscore
@SenateGOP #CBOscore estimates that HALF of Americans live in areas that are expected to waive these essential health benefits. #trumpcare
@SenateGOP GOP says this will lower premiums. It won't. Those w/ pre-existing conditions will pay substantial increases in out of pocket spending.
@SenateGOP #Trumpcare gives states &amp; insurers choice to not cover essential health benefits like Rx coverage, maternity care, mental health and more.
@SenateGOP 3)#Trumpcare forces those w/ pre-existing conditions to pay "substantial increases" (CBO) in premiums and out-of-pocket spending. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP We should always work to deficit reduction, but ripping coverage away from poor &amp; disabled to pay for tax cuts for rich doesn't help anyone
@SenateGOP Over the next decade, #Trumpcare cuts $772 billion from #Medicaid and kicks 15 million enrollees off their coverage. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP 2)@SenateGOP #Trumpcare Destroys #Medicaid as we know it, will kick millions of their insurance. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP Under #ACA, that same 64yr old pays $6800 for the same coverage. That's a difference of almost $14,000 dollars (!) per year. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP Another example: A 64yr old that makes $57k/yr would pay $20,500 annually for a silver-level health plan. 1/3 of entire income! #CBOscore
@SenateGOP That's an extra $4800 that person could be spending on food, medicine, gas, or maybe even a birthday present for a grandkid. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP Example: A 64yr old making $27k would pay $6500 in premiums under Senate #Trumpcare. S/he currently pays $1700 under tne #ACA. #CBOscore
@SenateGOP 1)Seniors will pay much, much more than they're paying now. #CBOscore #Trumpcare

Under-resourcing our fight vs opioid &amp; other overdose epidemic all but guarantees throwing millions back into addiction and likely death.
This Senate GOP #HealthcareBill is taking care away from people suffering from substance use disorder when they need it the most.
That $2b is less than even the House HC bill, which offered $45b over the next decade - an adequate &amp; underfunded response to begin with
In the middle of a growing opioid OD epidemic, Senate #HealthcareBill offers only $2 billion for recovery treatment programs for one year.
It certainly doesn't sound like the #BetterCare that @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell kept secret for more than a month and is now selling.
This isn't just "mean" as @realDonaldTrump called the Republican health plan. It's downright cruel. And it goes against our own values.
Senate GOP #HealthcareBill also decimates our ability to pay for nursing home care for seniors. All to pay for more tax cuts for the rich.
It will devastate women's health as it defunds @PPact &amp; allows insurance companies to treat *being a woman* as a pre-existing condition.

10) Massive #AHCA cuts to reinvestment in our health care system, which goes to the wealthiest 0.1 % of Americans. #Trumpcare
9) AHCA forces schools to ration care for students who need special services. States would no longer have to include them as Medicaid prvdrs
8) Large multi-state employers in NY would no longer have to offer plans with essential benefits (mental health, Rx, maternity care, etc).
7) #AHCA potentially ends practice of employer-sponsored coverage to NYers by removing requirement biz w &gt; 50 employees to offer insurance
6) #AHCA takes away tax credits for NYers when purchasing insurance. Bill was written to exclude assistance for plans sold in NY. #Trumpcare
5) #AHCA eliminates the Essential Plan, which helps 685k NYers gain access to high quality coverage with premiums less than $20/month
4) #AHCA steals more than $117 BILLION frm Medicare, cuts life of trust fund 3 yrs. Medicare Part B prems would also increse by $8.7 billion
3) Blows a $4.7 BILLION hole in state budget #AHCA #Trumpcare
2) #AHCA ends Medicaid expansion in NY, puts 8 million kids, seniors, disabled at risk of cuts to service. #Trumpcare

To clarify, offense was at House leadership who said disaster aid to help Irene victims needed offset. Never done b4. Emergency req's action
is in Farm Bill. I have said let's vote on it. House Leadership says no. Farmers deserve better. Bipartisan support in House, must act *
That was offensive. We have fought for many $ to community, will cont to do so. In future, need to work on mitigation plan. Crop ins 4 ag...
Irene destruction was great. Resilience/strength of ppl greater. Fought for debris removal and ag help - GOP said it needed to be "offset"
Agree reckless behavior on Wall St was source of recession. Required reforms. Dodd-Frank put cop on beat of Wall St. I supported it. *
Compromise on what "upper income" amount is possible, but can't afford for millionaires and billionaires #518elex *
Need what's affordable and reasonable. Trickle down that was promised didn't work. Middle class purchasing power rebuilds econ
Tax cuts brought us into recession, not paid for. Need to help middle class. Can't afford it for upper income #518elex
Next question is fine*
Fed funds for incubator programs and advanced mfr at places like @RPI allow for  21st century workforce = good jobs, here at home *
Specific example Kintz plastics needed trained workers, funds for local comm college HVCC trained and strengthened workers for them
Invest in advanced manufacturing to maintain competitive edge in global clean energy race. Invest in research #518elex
ACA provides private sector model - 30 million new patients on private health plans, not a govt takeover * #518elex
Finally put incentives for patient wellness over fee for service, paradigm shift, outcomes trump multiple procedures
of deep pockets and influence of industry on DC. Also preventative care and clinics that are part of ACA, yet to be implemented #518elex
Bulk purchasing of prescription drugs for federal programs - drives down cost by purchasing all at once. Hasn't happened yet b/c...#518elex
