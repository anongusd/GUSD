@StaceyPlaskett Thank you Congresswoman Plaskett. I was both impressed and proud of you today. Great job!
@StaceyPlaskett thank you Rep Plakett. You did good today.
@RepCummings Thank you sir. Your final remarks today inspired hope. You spoke from the heart. I believe Michael Cohen is remorseful. I can forgive but he needs to pay his debt for crimes. His life, and ours, will never be the same. Excise the tumor in our democracy.

@JudyWoodruff @shareitarie10 Lots of White supremacist Nazi‚Äôs in prison. Cohen may pay for his crimes with his life. I think that‚Äôs too big a price to pay when sentenced to 3 years in prison. Donald Trump &amp; his 3 older children must be held accountable for this mess.
@JudyWoodruff @shareitarie10 I believe Cohen is sorry for his crimes. His life is in ruins. I despise him for contributing to the downfall of this democracy, but I can forgive him if you continues to try to make amends. My forgiveness does not mean I forget his crimes. He needs to pay for the crime.

I saved 20% of my salary in a 403b last 15 years + 3% match from hospital. It saved me in retirement. Save as much as you can for as long as you can young people. There was no 403b available to me in my youth. Take advantage of it. You are going to need it.
Social security is a safety net for our citizens. I get benefits and I want my children &amp; grandchildren to get back their contributions too. It is our money, not an entitlement. We pay, and we need to know our investment will be returned at retirement.
Did you know...retirement is a blessing. Employed in high stress positions past 45 years. Retired 2 weeks ago. It is glorius resistors. A dream come true. Never thought I could be so stress free (except for Trump...he is my stressor now). https://t.co/QdoTateNib
