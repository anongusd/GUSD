Collins Applauds Funding for Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station Fitness Center #AmericanBudget - https://t.co/EZkhdQoYAv
The current fitness facility is outdated and does not meet the needs of the brave men and women in Niagara Falls that defend our county. I have been outspoken in the need for this funding and applaud @POTUS for including it in his budget
Great news for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and the men and women serving in the 914th Airlift Wing and the Air National Guard 107th Airlift Wing. In the @POTUS budget, $14 million for a state-of-the-art fitness facility has been included
This is a difficult day, but we stand together to honor the lives lost during the Flight 3407 crash. I'll continue to work w/ the Trump Admin to make sure the safety of our flying public is put first by keeping important pilot training rules in place. https://t.co/BhmrHbft92
Today marks the 9th anniversary of the Flight 3407 crash and we remember the lives that were lost too soon. Because of the tireless efforts of the Flight 3407 families advocating for flight safety reform, we can also mark 9 years without a fatal commercial crash.
The @HouseCommerce committee will be looking into this important issue and we need to hold @NYGovCuomo accountable. This type of behavior puts lives in danger during emergency situations and he should be ashamed.
Since @NYGovCuomo has been in office, NY has diverted an estimated $400 million, or about 42% of the money collected for these important 911 services. This is one more example of our Gov selling our rural areas short again #WNY
NY has some of the highest surcharges on cell phone bills for 911 services, meant to improve the way callers are pinpointed by 911. Hardworking NYers pay for these services. Looks like @NYGovCuomo has been diverting this money to his slush fund for years https://t.co/DGT0g0m38N
The FCC released a report that found NY was wasting money paid for 911 services, diveritng it to non-emergency services. @NYGovCuomo can you let us know where this money is going? Are you continuing to squander money to your taxpayer funded slush fund? https://t.co/GtJy6gd8nU

Companies like @ATT know that less regulations are better for business and better for consumers. We are committed to working together to never block websites, discriminate against the content consumers see, or allow some websites to load faster than others
My colleagues and I on @housecommerce are working to keep the internet free and open, unlike @NYGovCuomo who has signed an executive order that will drive away innovation and stifle business
As a result of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct being signed into law, @verizon has announced employees will receive 50 shares of restricted Verizon stock and they will increase their philanthropic work. Companies are taking action and changing the lives of everyday employees.
Today @NYGovCuomo once again made a decision that’s bad for business. I fully support a federal approach to maintain a free and open internet, this patchwork approach will disincentive innovation in broadband and hurt consumers.

#GovernorGrinch has been stealing money from New Yorker’s paychecks for years &amp; he trying to steal Christmas with a govt shutdown. Today the House passed historic tax reform that will be a Christmas gift for families across my district, despite @NYGovCuomo’s lies &amp; misinformation
Today @NYGovCuomo vetoed a bill that would have increased assistance for the elderly, and put the blame on Republicans in Congress. #GovernorGrinch is stealing Christmas for tens of thousands of seniors by denying them additional supplemental security income
Not only is @NYGovCuomo demonstrating himself as the Grinch who is trying to steal Christmas, but that he is incapable of ever being our nation’s President or should continue as New York’s Governor. #GovernorGrinch https://t.co/gKwJTBbv7v

A survey of #smallbiz owners shows 75% intend to act to avoid the employer mandate, including moving more full-time employees to part-time.
The consequences of this 30hr-per-wk definition are fewer work hours for employees and administrative nightmares for #smallbiz.
Most Americans &amp; federal statuses define a full-time employee as one who works an avg of 40 hours per week. The health law defines it as 30.
As @SmallBizGOP has examined, the health law’s employer mandate is a disincentive for businesses to grow and add new jobs.
A number of small businesses have told @SmallBizGOP the health care law is increasing the cost of their health plans significantly.
