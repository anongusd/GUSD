Michael Cohen's punches about Trump's TV lawyer would land a lot better if he didn't have Lanny Davis sitting right behind him.

@rgoodlaw @SkullduggeryPod those obstruction witnesses from the Trump WH all did voluntary interviews, but the WH reserved the right to claim exec privilege later, so I suspect there may still be wrangling over release to Congress or the public if they assert the privilege.
Who has more credibility: someone who has admitted to lying, or someone who lies as frequently and casually as the rest of us breathe oxygen but has never once admitted to it? Seems to me it's the former.
I really can't read that Trump's strategy is to accuse someone else of lying without doubling over in laughter, even if that someone else is an admitted liar like Michael Cohen.

@marty_lederman @AaronBlake @joshtpm @TPM That‚Äôs part of it for sure (though I don‚Äôt agree most DOJ people wanted him out in May 17 - extenuating circumstances), but I think succumbing to presidential pressure in his first few weeks on the job is undoubtedly another.
@marty_lederman @AaronBlake @joshtpm @TPM he did realize what was going on. He had seen the draft Trump letter, and Trump had asked to him include Russia in his memo. Also, because he‚Äôs a sentient human being. He got played because he let himself get played.
Anyway, the McCabe book is definitely worth your time. The stuff on Sessions alone will keep you up for a week just realizing he ran DOJ for two years.
I want to believe this phrasing is a brilliant troll: ‚ÄúTrying to interest Sessions in matters that he was not predisposed to care about was a lost cause.‚Äù
Also funny: Sessions kept thinking the FBI had some sort of navy that could be used to interdict drugs off the coast of Colombia. ‚ÄúSometimes he went on like this for fifteen minutes.‚Äù (The FBI does not have a navy.)

@JRubinBlogger Yes, clearly. I think the three things that produced the turnaround (and Mueller) were: 1. Rod‚Äôs reputation getting hammered, 2. Comey memos leaking, 3. McCabe opening the probe into Trump.
What doesn‚Äôt add up is Rosenstein‚Äôs supposed sudden concern about Trump after the Comey firing. Trump had asked him to mention Russia in his memo, and that didn‚Äôt give him pause enough to pull out of the whole charade. Then he turns on a dime when it all goes terribly.
@KenDilanianNBC Asking Rod to put Russia in the memo wasn‚Äôt known publicly at the time. But I think the biggest reason was what he said right before - looking for a way to make the investigation harder to kill.

Important because reporting about how Trump has pressured Whitaker over the SDNY probe has been quite incriminating. @Mimirocah1 and I wrote about it here. https://t.co/A98mtnZOoZ
I find it very telling DOJ says Whitaker was willing to testify the WH did not ask for any promises or commitments about the Mueller probe, but is notably silent about the SDNY probe. Nadler had raised both in his letter. https://t.co/Adt4PovpPq
RT @PostOpinions: The Mueller investigation has sprouted, @JoyceWhiteVance and @matthewamiller write. Therein lies the jeopardy for Trump.‚Ä¶
DOJ's game all along has been to try and avoid Whitaker testifying until after Barr is confirmed. Now Nadler can subpoena, go to court to enforce the appearance, but they are going to thumb their nose until he's dragged in months from now, and hope he's old news by then.
"I won't testify unless you promise to not make me answer hard questions" is an outrageous stance for the nation's chief law enforcement officer to take. They have been looking for any excuse to avoid what was going to be a disaster. https://t.co/I00aSWdSP6

@emptywheel maybe to tie up loose ends or pursue other threads that will be referred...who knows. But if they were looking for key evidence for the big enchilada, seems they would‚Äôve done the searches before now. I could be wrong, but seems more likely to me he escapes a conspiracy charge.

Trump and Kushner initially think firing Flynn will end the Russia investigation. Christie tells them thats not true, so Trump immediately intervenes directly with the FBI to try and get at least the Flynn piece of the investigation ended. Important piece of the timeline.
The timing of this lunch is really interesting: 12:30 pm on Feb. 14, according to Trump's public sked. It's later that day, after getting this warning from Christie, that Trump kicks everyone out of the room and asks Comey to back off the Flynn investigation. https://t.co/G5VV7ZAGeB

@jonathanchait agree it seems likely eventually. Maybe Trump decides it's too great a political cost to do it pre-trial. So Stone goes to trial knowing he may end up spending a couple months in jail (by time trial happens, sentencing, etc) before a re-elected or lame duck Trump can pardon him.
@jonathanchait that's certainly the big question

One of the key differences between an investigation into Trump and anyone else is that he can‚Äôt be indicted, according to DOJ. So to some extent the usual dynamic of indict or shut up doesn‚Äôt make sense. https://t.co/5xxVofwgSK
You can see him getting more confident of his chances of confirmation and thereforw less deferential to Senators as the hearing goes on. https://t.co/GXaYmEOSUk
This exchange really takes me back to July of 2016 when John Cornyn was out publicly criticizing Comey for his inappropriate press conference. üôÑ
Barr‚Äôs commitment to seek but not necessarily follow the advice of ethics officials is the Whitaker standard and falls short of what Holder, Sessions, Rosenstein, and Yates all committed to - to follow that advice. It‚Äôs obviously deliberate that he‚Äôs breaking precedent.
According to Barr‚Äôs testimony, the behavior described in this story would constitute a clear violation of Trump‚Äôs oath of office. https://t.co/wVwQ5zTHIp
The facts are pretty clear that Trump has done this repeatedly both publicly and privately. Did Barr just implicitly endorse impeachment? https://t.co/rsZApzyFjA
Graham is following his Kavanaugh playbook to a tee. When there are real concerns about the nominee, hijack the hearing by attacking someone else instead.
Chairman Lindsey Nunes
Barr says he shared his memo broadly so other lawyers, i.e all the president‚Äôs men, would have the benefit of his views. So why didn‚Äôt he share it with his good friend Bob Mueller?
So in addition to advocating before DOJ and sharing his views with WH counsel, Barr shared his memo with Trump's personal attorneys (including Kasowitz's firm), Kushner's attorney, and Pence's attorney. He was essentially a member of the president's legal defense team. https://t.co/kW54yPUHFI

Also extremely strange Barr sent it to Noel Francisco. He has no role in the Mueller probe at all, but would‚Äôve overseen it had Rosenstein been fired.
The details of this are stunning. In addition to discussing his memo with Trump‚Äôs personal attorneys, Barr also shared or discussed it with Kushner‚Äôs lawyer. There is no world in which he doesn‚Äôt need to recuse. 	https://t.co/DPApNxJHBZ
You can debate whether Barr will be fair or not, but is there any doubt at all that this memo is why Trump nominated him? https://t.co/00wCX0s8is
Fairly remarkable that, given his public comments about Mueller and his memo, Barr's statement doesn't even contemplate possibility of recusal. Notable because in his committee questionnaire, he promised to consult with, but not necessarily follow, advice from ethics officials.

Short of publicly proclaiming he takes Putin's word over that of U.S. intel agencies, I can't really think of anything more suspicious Trump could do than this. Oh wait. https://t.co/haoEUsJ8rs
Not to say the facts didn‚Äôt justify it (they clearly did), but the FBI doing it on their own is bureaucratic hardball. And it worked. A few days later Rosenstein appoints Mueller and the probe is now basically impossible to kill. A good result from an unprecedented 8 days at DOJ.
So if you‚Äôre the FBI and you‚Äôre worried your investigation is about to get squashed, what do you to to make that impossible? Up the ante and formally expand it into Trump himself. Tie DOJ‚Äôs hands.
The story doesn‚Äôt say this explicitly, but it seems the FBI expanded the investigation into POTUS himself without approval from Rosenstein. Wow. That is, shall we say, suboptimal. In their defense, they would‚Äôve had real questions about Rod after he wrote the Comey memo.
More I think about the NYT story, the more the takeaway for me is the tension between DOJ &amp; FBI in that period, with a worrried and angry FBI taking a dramatic step that would make their investigation unkillable.
Wait, is he criticizing the details of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs FBI interview again, when he refused to talk to them at all? Go away, please. https://t.co/o0Vii32FDt
@harrylitman to me it‚Äôs more of a story of what was going on between DOJ and FBI and an angry/worried FBI trying to protect its investigation by making it unkillable than anything new about the underlying investigation.
You‚Äôre Rosenstein in May 17 and you‚Äôve just tanked your own reputation by helping fire Comey. Then you find out Trump has been trying to block the probe for months and the FBI has now opened a counterintel probe into POTUS. No wonder he was melting down.
Can also see another reason Rosenstein appointed Mueller. Not just to protect the probe from Trump, but because the FBI was vulnerable to accusations of acting too quickly out of anger over Comey and needed someone unimpeachable in charge.
This has always been the underlying question of the investigation, but what a call it must have been to make it explicit so early. Bold. https://t.co/aEYTrxNMnc

So even aside from questions about a Mueller report, Nadler and Cummings should be able to get their hands on every FBI 302 from the Mueller probe. It's all coming out. Way to think ahead, Mr. President.
Trump and House R's worked together to make DOJ turn over all kinds of stuff that has heretofore remained secret. Good luck making the argument now that DOJ investigative materials shouldn't go to the hill. Pandora's box is wide open.
One thing I'd add about this smart @benjaminwittes piece is that many of the arguments DOJ could make against providing a report to Congress have been completely undermined by DOJ turning so much over to Meadows &amp; co. the past two years. https://t.co/KTpVeDdQRN

DOJ is taking out all the trash before the holiday. We really need to know the specifics. Ethics advice is often of the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt technically need to recuse, but you should really consider it given all the issues your involvement presents‚Äù variety. https://t.co/do5W5oWJyc
@jonathanchait bingo. btw, I suspect the person the story refers to is Flood, not McGahn. McGahn had recused himself from it because he was involved in underlying events, was taking to Mueller, etc.
@jonathanchait it's the headline news! The views he presents in the memo are even more definitive than what Whitaker said in his tv appearances that most people found disqualifying.
Remember that the day Trump announced Barr, he said he was "my first choice since day one." Well now we know why. The WH had been told over the summer that Barr thought Mueller's obstruction probe was inappropriate. https://t.co/t6hcxlUzqT
Very odd that this sentence, which is maybe the biggest piece of news in the WSJ story on Barr's memo, wasn't in the original version that posted at 10:19 last night and now shows up in graf 23 as if it is no big deal. It is a huge deal. https://t.co/qwDn21q5ux
@marty_lederman @emilybazelon I can think of a few reasons, but I suspect we won't know until a few weeks from now. Never know from the outside of a confirmation the universe of things the team is dealing with.
@sgurman but are we to believe his counsel (who I presume was Flood) hadn't told him about it beforehand? Or if he hadn't told him explicitly about the memo hadn't assured Trump that Barr's views on this issue were favorable to him?

@benjaminwittes @marty_lederman @emilybazelon I meant its existence, sorry. No, not posted. The WSJ just got to review it, according to the story. But I assume they figured out it had to go to SJC with his questionnaire.
@marty_lederman @emilybazelon pretty sure the reason it's public today is because DOJ knows they have to turn it over and so decided to get it out on best terms possible.
@page88 stop it
Barr‚Äôs views on executive power have long been at the extreme end of the spectrum. But for him to have argued the merits of this specific case - on Trump‚Äôs behalf, to Rosenstein, with Trump‚Äôs counsel (and presumably Trump) knowing he did it - means he needs to pledge to recuse.
It is true, as ‚Äúpeople familiar with the matter‚Äù say, that former officials sometimes provide unsolicited thoughts to DOJ. But 20-page memos that are also sent to counsel for the subject of an investigation? That is not common, and it doesn‚Äôt happen by accident.
Clever for Barr‚Äôs confirmation team to try to bury this right before the holidays, but it raises major questions about whether he should be allowed to oversee the Mueller probe. https://t.co/6CCns2xIWk

If indicting isn't an option, per OLC, seems DOJ has to send a referral to Congress. Theoretically you could wait and indict in 2021 (before the statute runs) if he loses re-election, but that's both an abdication of responsibility &amp; risks losing any mechanism for accountability.
One of the biggest open questions is not about Mueller, but SDNY. They've concluded the president committed a crime, and they have hard evidence to prove it. What do they do with that? They can't just drop it.
"By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what had occurred in hopes of limiting the investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election." -- Mueller cares if you lie to the public.
This is an interesting line from Mueller: "The defendant amplified his false statements by releasing and repeating his lies to the public, including to other potential witnesses."

This has always been the hardest part of the investigation to understand, even with some really great reporting around it. But everything about the facts we know have stunk, and it's clear Mueller has been all over it.
Very interesting that Flynn has cooperated with other probes and done interviews with other DOJ offices. The UAE/Broidy/Nader piece has always seemed ripe for referral, &amp; we know Flynn attended a mtg with Nader and the UAE crown prince. Seems a likely candidate.
@Tom_Winter It was a joke (mostly)
One byproduct of this filing, intentional or not, is the information is now in the custody of a judge, not just housed in the executive branch. Even if Mueller is fired, it doesn't disappear -- can all be unsealed and made public.

We all get so inured to Trump's defining deviance down, but I for one will be happy when we once again have a president who acts like it's his obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed rather than behaving like a mob boss.
A lot has happened the past few days, but it shouldn't pass without notice that in addition to calling Cohen "weak" for cooperating, Trump attacked DOJ for "flipping" people, which of course is what they do to solve crimes. Absolutely shameful stuff from a sitting president.

Sometimes this stuff just isn't that complicated.
So during the summer of 2016, Trump tried to cut a business deal with Russia while publicly attacking NATO and praising Putin, asking Russia to hack his opponent's emails, and while his son and senior staffers met in secret with Russian government intermediaries.
Trump's attacks on the Mueller probe late last night and again early this morning raise a huge question: did Whitaker brief him on what was coming today?

@MLevineReports Good point. But if "when appropriate" doesn't include this case, given the Clovis connection, his public comments, and his convos with Trump about Mueller, then it doesn't include any case and that statement was meaningless drivel.
Today would be a good day for authorities in Virginia and New York to kick any tax or money laundering investigations into Manafort into overdrive.
It's been more than two weeks since DOJ said Whitaker would consult with ethics officials about recusing from the Mueller investigation. So whatever happened with that? It's a one-hour meeting, tops.
@kyledcheney but I feel like the lesson of the last two weeks is that he sometimes lets things slip that we misinterpret by trying to connect only to publicly known-events. For example his nov. 15 tweets now seem clearly about Manafort, which no one knew at the time. So who knows.
@kyledcheney Yeah, probably who he means.
Corsi, Manafort....and who? Is there a third person in Trump's orbit in play who we don't know about? Stone says he hasn't been contacted by Mueller. https://t.co/VxLkWGyWEh
@SykesCharlie Surely it‚Äôs a feeling you‚Äôre accustomed to by now.
Seriously, if the legal community cares as much as it says it does about self-policing bad actors, Kevin Downing would be a good place to start.
The answer involves a deeply unethical president and his lawyer who are at least implicitly dangling pardons and a deeply unethical defense attorney who ought to be shamed and ostracized by the white collar bar. https://t.co/julgBu8gQ8

One thing about this Manafort story: if it's true, the US government (&amp; by extension Mueller) will definitely know it. They have surely been logging everyone who comes in and out of the embassy since Assange holed up there.

This tweet on Nov. 15 was sent a few hours before Mueller asked for the ten day delay in updating the judge on Manafort‚Äôs sentencing (which they ultimately did yesterday). Maybe Trump knew what was coming. https://t.co/kSvKySZMqO

@benjaminwittes Very interesting question!
@benjaminwittes Of course it‚Äôs possible he might be behaving rationally. I.E. the need to have Whitaker intervene in some way (subpoena? report? family member indictment?) is important enough to outweigh all of the policy, political and legal downsides. Desperate times and such.
@benwikler Indeed
Everything about Whitaker‚Äôs finances - the five amendments to his disclosure forms right before release, the FACT fundraising while he was at DOJ, FACT‚Äôs tax status &amp; payments to him - stinks to high heaven. If people keep pulling the string, they‚Äôre likely to find much more.

Of course, that has always existed somewhat on the right. G. Gordon Liddy and Oliver North didn‚Äôt flourish after what should have been career-ending scandals because of their thoughtful contributions to the national discourse.
The best argument against Matt Whitaker protecting the Mueller probe because he‚Äôs afraid of tanking his own career is the emergence of a parallel MAGA world, where rather than slink sway into obscurity, people flourish solely because of their connection to cronyism. https://t.co/mhZMjDS7NQ
@ericuman @waltshaub Sure. But it‚Äôs easy to make a mountain out of a molehill. Sometimes people to do it to avoid disclosure, but sometimes by accident, sometimes because someone emails their personal account and they reply. On the scale of government problems, it‚Äôs hardly a major one.
The most surprising thing I learned in the Post story about Ivanka is that she has a chief of staff. Why?
Honestly, I don‚Äôt have any ethical issue with a government official using personal email for occasional business. But if you entered government after the 2016 campaign and were doing it, you are guilty of criminal stupidity.

@AshaRangappa_ That‚Äôs just for the explanation of recommended actions that were blocked, no? I meant any underlying report about presidential conduct, as contemplated in 600.9(c). So he would tell Congress he was blocking release of the report, but then fight a subpoena for the report itself.
@AshaRangappa_ Yep. And DOJ would resist the subpoena presumably and it would take many months to litigate. We‚Äôre down several leaps of speculation here of course, but if I were trying to bottle it up that‚Äôd be the path I‚Äôd take.

Just as a point of reference, in the Obama admin, DOJ kept the WH updated in real time on developments in major investigations like this. Would assume that's still the case, but who knows.
I don't know if the timing of Trump's "bomb" tweet so close to the FBI arresting a suspect suggests that he wasn't being updated by DOJ, or that he was up to speed and was trying to detract from the coming announcement, but either way it's quite disturbing.

@ElieNYC great piece
And 2. D's can't continue to play by rules the R's long ago abandoned. At least not if they ever want to be in power. END.
I very much get the arguments (and have made them often myself) about not politicizing law enforcement. But 1. it's clear the investigation being conducted here is a sham. And everyone involved needs to answer for their role in that sham, &amp; whether they helped perpetrate it.
They could demand the FBI 302s be released publicly. That would be unprecedented and not great for the long-term process. But same was true about FBI releasing Clinton 302s in Sep. 2016, which they did in response to GOP pressure.
They could be demanding Wray and Rosenstein recuse themselves, given their longstanding connections to Kavanaugh.
Jerry Nadler, who the FBI knows is likely to be Judiciary Chairman come January, could make clear that he will subpoena every document from this investigation, interview FBI officials, and hold public hearings next year.
But absent pressure from D's, they're more likely to just execute the orders the WH gives them. So what should D's be doing? Here are some ideas:
It's true that the WH calls the shots in this investigation, but there is a lot the FBI can do to make sure it was complete if they wanted to. For example, a memo to the WH (preserved for posterity) that says the current scope of the investigation will not find the truth.
What do we think R's would be doing in this situation? Consider that they have spent years accusing lifelong Republican Jim Comey of orchestrating a coverup for Hillary Clinton and you get some idea.
Supervising Wray is Rod Rosenstein, who goes back to Ken Starr with Kavanaugh, and who personally attended his confirmation hearing.
Consider who is in charge of the FBI investigation: Chris Wray, who (like Kavanaugh) was in the Federalist Society at Yale and who served with him in the Bush admin - in jobs where they would've worked closely together.
Comes back to the asymmetric way the two parties treat DOJ/FBI, where the GOP continuously pressures it to do inappropriate things while D's just ask it to follow the normal process. Guess which one the FBI responds to?
Watching the way D's are approaching the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, &amp; it feels like they are making some of the same mistakes they made during the Clinton email investigation &amp; as Rosenstein has ceded ground to the WH at various times in the Russia probe.

I‚Äôm sure the president‚Äôs decades-long history of tax fraud ended in the 1990s, the period covered by this NYT piece. No reason at all to think it has been ongoing, especially since he‚Äôs been so open with his tax returns.
@MiekeEoyang Ideally I think neither background investigations nor results of criminal probes should be released. But also believe we can't live in a world where such rules apply only to people from one political party.
@JRubinBlogger well, Comey broke the norm. Or established a new one. But precedent is precedent, and that's now the standing one.
That was a criminal investigation, of course, while this is a background investigation, but if anything, that would argue for more transparency here -- results of criminal probes are kept much more closely held than background investigations.
While this was long the standard protocol, Comey set a new precedent when he released all of the Clinton investigation records (in the middle of a presidential campaign) because of high public interest. Why wouldn't that apply here? https://t.co/wc1julLP2s

A good question to ask the WH is if they'll ask the FBI to re-open its background investigation into Kavanaugh. If they're really interested in the truth, there is no legitimate reason for them not to.

@jaketapper @JamesRosenTV @Thomas_Drake1 @JesselynRadack @ggreenwald @trevortimm not exactly eager! I have said publicly I think the Drake case was a mistake, as evidenced by it falling apart right before trial. I have yet to hear anyone make a good argument why prosecuting Kiriakou for disclosing a CIA agent‚Äôs identity wasn‚Äôt justified.
4. With all respect, we have a lot bigger problems to worry about right now. I will take my lumps for the excesses from the Obama years, &amp; defend where I think we were right, but it feels a little like the three pigs arguing amongst each other while the wolf is at the door. End
3. Reporters, like all of us, bring their own biases to the table, and this is one area where it‚Äôs hard to have a conversation that gets beyond the ‚Äúrecord number of leak prosecutions!‚Äù line to discuss whether those prosecutions were actually justified.
2. Not every leak prosecution is an attack on the free press. There is no whistleblowing goal served by, for example, disclosing a CIA agent‚Äôs identity, as I argued in this 2012 piece. https://t.co/aDoJiObOPV
I know I will regret banging my head on this particular wall again, but:	1. The Obama DOJ made mistakes w/r/t James Rosen, admitted it, &amp; reformed the rules governing media subpoenas. It‚Äôs incomplete for reporters to attack the former without at least acknowledging the latter.
Sessions may not (partly because he can not) carry out Trump‚Äôs most outrageous demands, but he is still running an incredibly partisan, political DOJ. https://t.co/nv9HLzTbkA

He absolutely has no interest in it, but someone clearly convinced him he needed to clean things up, hence his post-Helsinki retreat and today‚Äôs press conference (which he promptly undermined tonight). https://t.co/DFQVpkNImO
Trump has a serious message problem.

Broidy and Gates are unsympathetic figures to everyone on the left of course, for good reason. But the same news judgment the NYT is applying here could just as easily apply when the Russians start hacking Democratic candidates again. (end)
We get some of that context in the story -- in the 22nd graf, framed as an accusation by Broidy. But both the casting of the story and the way the NYT reporters are tweeting about it makes clear what they think the news is, and it's not the criminal act that took place.
The hackers aren't noble whistleblowers trying to expose wrongdoing either. They are almost certainly foreign state actors trying to influence U.S. policy by dirtying up another foreign state through the U.S. press, in this case the NYT.
The behavior exposed in this story is ugly, but it's not criminal, which seems relevant when balancing it against the hackers who did commit a crime to obtain the documents leaked to the NYT.

In this case, manufactured by people with no interest in the truth - they attacked the decision anyway and beat the FBI up for months. Comey gave the R's an unjustified gift and they went nuts anyway. Better to stick to the rules.
@ggreenwald @NicolleDWallace "We examined this many records, interviewed this many people, comprehensive probe, looked at everything possible..unanimous recommendation of every agent and prosecutor on the case that no charges be filed." Period.
@ggreenwald @NicolleDWallace it wouldn't have been permanently damaged, no. And the alternative, the path he took, damaged it even worse. There was a way to tell the public what DOJ/FBI had done without crossing into maligning someone who wasn't being charged.
George would be horrified if he knew someone mentioned his name on national tv. Fortunately, he spends all day in a SCIF sealed off from the world and will never find out.

To be fair, there is a lot going on, which is how Trump beats most controversies. And as I told @mattfleg, they're likely to be less responsive to negative press coverage (understatement). But still odd to see most reporters suddenly so passive on this issue.
If this is the first battle in a Trump DOJ war against the press, the press has surrendered without firing a shot. When this happened under Holder, was a lead story for weeks until DOJ backed down. Today, the press is mostly already moving on. https://t.co/sO1qoNXXEv

@emptywheel it wasn't overnight in 06 either. there were a couple of NE Dem Senators with really aggressive flacks who pushed things along until the fire went bipartisan. Pete King, naturally, was the first to flip.
@emptywheel yeah, I phrased that poorly. Meant the parallels between the deals and the politics are strong, but wasn't trying to predict GOP members would cave so much as point out that's what happened in 06.
There are strong parallels here to the Dubai Ports deal in 2006 -- when the wheels really came off for the Bush administration and GOP members of Congress first felt free to criticize the WH on the record. https://t.co/lVNWecB1eU
@vermontgmg p.s. I am going to delete the previous tweet (obviously) if the investigation stretches into next year.
@DevlinBarrett a recurring Trumplandia phenomenon is background quotes that sound like what people who watch too many movies think people in politics sound like.
@vermontgmg yes, though a big part of me thinks it is all about to wrap up with a massive bang around July or August. (also, it's not really taking that long, relatively!)
This @NatashaBertrand scoop is a great read in its own right and also as a reminder of just how many Mueller threads there are that we mere mortals have no insight to. https://t.co/BJXO6Kx5UB
With all respect to @MarkSZaidEsq, I don‚Äôt understand why Cohen-Watnick‚Äôs attorney is serving as his spokesperson here. Don‚Äôt the NSC and DOJ have press teams?

@steveschale Pretty appalling, but I still think vodka and Sprite Zero is worse.

The message of Trump‚Äôs ZTE tweet at the same time he is re-imposing Iran sanctions is that US companies who violate sanctions with Iran will be punished. Chinese companies who do will be let off the hook. America first!
Uh, US companies were banned from selling to ZTE because it violated sanctions with Iran, which this administration claims is such a threat that it just imposed new sanctions. https://t.co/4PK5PmJSyP
Once again, seems like Giuliani has accidentally confessed that Trump did something inaproppriate without either understanding that it‚Äôs inappropriate or even knowing if Trump did it or not. Helluva thing.
Quite the thing for Giuliani to say, given Sessions has refused to answer Congressional questions whether the WH weighed in with DOJ on this merger (as the NYT reported they discussed doing). https://t.co/4pdw4IrX6y

As usual, @KamalaHarris is getting to exactly the right point through her q's. Haspel said she won't do anything immoral going forward, but if she won't say whether torture was immoral, what does that even mean?
Haspel would be so much more convincing if she just said CIA, DOJ, &amp; the US govt lost its way &amp; made a major mistake in torturing detainees. Without that admission, she's asking people to endorse the appropriateness of what happened by voting for her.

@JRubinBlogger probably. though I think there is a chance Mueller will just move on and finish up without the interview if he already has evidence of criminality.

@jpodhoretz the question is when. DOJ doesn't as a rule turn over materials during ongoing investigations because of the chance it will harm the investigation. And once you do it once, it's harder to say no the next time. Which could relate to a politician, a bank, a union, whatever.
@chrislhayes @thegarance DOJ would refuse to turn them over until the investigation is over. once it's over, they make what info available that they can (for example, FBI 302s) while withholding things like grand jury info.
@emptywheel agree in the short-term -- this probably won't harm the investigation because info is already known. But medium- and long-term it creates real problems. this won't be the last ask.

At some point Rosenstein needs to tell them to stop interfering in ongoing investigations. Let them hold him in contempt. The goalposts for Congrsssional involvement in criminal probes are shifting in a dangerous way. https://t.co/YDixLi8YLd

It would‚Äôve never occurred to Mueller that he was in an ‚Äúimpossible position.‚Äù He wouldn‚Äôt have thought about himself and his position at all. He would‚Äôve just done his job, followed the rules, and let the chips fall where they may. As you‚Äôre supposed to.

@charlie_savage Same DOJ that referred repeatedly to ‚Äúassistant attorney general Christopher Ray‚Äù in that announcement of the appointment, so maybe details of names and titles wasn‚Äôt their strength.
@Teeples32 @TheJusticeDept @ZoeTillman right. Holder assigned matters to several prosecutors (Fitzgerald, Rosenstein, Machen, Durham) as quasi-special prosecutors but without relying on the regs that create all sorts of separate rules and requirements.
@charlie_savage nevermind -- I think what you're saying in the story is that Comey didn't use it, not just that he bypassed the supervisory part by delegating the AG's powers.
@charlie_savage though it's always been unclear, I don't think Fitzgerald was appointed under the regs. For one thing, he was inside the government, so his appointment wouldn't be in compliance with them. seems to me Comey messed up the title then had to clarify:  https://t.co/QjB6LaDF4I

@jpodhoretz @MaxBoot the story had one source saying that. I took the fact his lawyer wouldn't confirm he didn't know to mean that he did -- because it would very much be in his interest to confirm it.
@jpodhoretz @MaxBoot even if you don't think the investigation was justified, it's enough reason (and there were already others) for Sessions to recuse and leave it to his deputy.

Good for Olson for declining. Stand by what I said yesterday: if Trump's strategy is to win by tearing down DOJ and the FBI, going to be hard to find respectable attorneys to join him.

@chrisgeidner @KDbyProxy @marty_lederman @emptywheel I believe it is due to the special counsel regs. Has to be someone who has the full powers of the AG. Non-Senate confirmed officials don‚Äôt.
@chrisgeidner @marty_lederman @emptywheel No, as long as the acting DAG is a senate-confirmed official. E.G. Francisco or a US attorney (or Pruitt!)...not an associate DAG or something.
@emptywheel @marty_lederman suppose you could file to have them dismissed. But that would be awfully suspect. As would all of this....at some point the entire department would be up in open revolt.
@emptywheel @marty_lederman Would depend on what the then-AG (or DAG or whoever is in charge) wanted to happen. Corrupt as it would be, he/she could always order the case shut down.
@emptywheel @marty_lederman My understanding (from Marty and others) is that Pruitt or another PAS acting AG would have power to fire Mueller. There is some dispute over whether he would (versus going down the succession line), but presumed OLC would say yes.
If the deputy director of the FBI is fired for lack of candor, a standard well below lying, what to do with an AG who lies under oath?

About the FBI's interim report on Porter in March: those aren't routine. Usually means the check has turned up something disqualifying that the FBI wants to elevate to decision makers immediately.
Colbie Holderness gave the photos showing abuse to the FBI last January. Anyone who has dealt with background checks will tell you it is hard to believe the FBI didn't at least make the WH aware of them in their partial report in March.

@qjurecic fundamentally a question of faith, I think. Good faith criticisms of law enforcement should be welcomed. Bad faith ones that just try to tear an institution down (for whatever bad faith reason) should be treated for what they are.

@page88 Yes, this tweet was definitely @page88 bait.
@lucykaplansky Thank you! Been a fan of yours for years, btw, and have seen you live several times, including way back when with Cry Cry Cry.
Inspector Nunes is now rummaging around the State Department with his magnifying glass and secret decoder ring searching for malfeasance. https://t.co/A3n0p3NKEP
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about John Dowd &amp; Jay Sekulow squaring off against Michael Dreeben over whether POTUS has to comply with a grand jury subpoena. Like a Pop Warner team taking on the Eagles.
@ddben @NicolleDWallace Knowing you need to earn that thank you tweet definitely inspires you to give it your all.
The rule of thumb for White House staff has always been that you can take the fifth, but you have to leave government to do so. The president shouldn‚Äôt have a lower bar than his staff.
Private citizen Donald Trump would be well within his rights taking the fifth. But we should obviously expect more from the president of the United States, charged with faithfully executing all laws.

It‚Äôs not the main takeaway from the memo, but the casual slandering of Strzok and Page with false &amp; misleading info is really gross.

Unbelievable. Sessions is giving credence to accusations his own Department has said aren‚Äôt true about an investigation from which he is recused and for which he has been interviewed. Crossing multiple lines here. https://t.co/dGTE84Dysg

@DevlinBarrett @DelWilber @brkend @WSJ so much sadness
@marty_lederman @joshgerstein @dsamuelsohn for arguments sake, what do you think would happen if, say, Trump shot someone on Fifth Avenue (in a federal building, for purposes of this argument) and Paul Ryan threw up his hands and said "he's just new at this?"

After all this build up, going to be hysterical tomorrow when the Nunes memo drops and a Gates plea is unsealed 30 minutes later.
@ryanjreilly @JessicaTarlov why are you doing this?
@Susan_Hennessey Congrats!
This supposed process is a total sham. Not only is the outcome pre-ordained, but no WH official has seen the underlying FISA application, so they can‚Äôt possibly know what harm the memo‚Äôs release would cause. https://t.co/kI9volIxwE
Well. So is Gates just flipping on Manafort....or someone bigger? https://t.co/UcuId1Vn02
@Nate_Cohn if @chrislhayes asked him the odds would go to about 95%. "Maybe. I'm not sure. Yes."

It‚Äôs fun to laugh at Nunes‚Äô constant displays of incompetence until you remember he‚Äôs also the person charged with secret oversight of the entire intelligence community. https://t.co/1AnOqnsBpb
@brianefallon @EricColumbus that is an interesting theory. you can imagine alarm bells going off as they watch Trump's behavior in crafting the statement.
The sourcing in here is something else. All the rats are jumping off the ship. https://t.co/RY7mXXvhnU
@DougHeye @RuthMarcus The president was not under investigation by DOJ when Holder said that. Big difference.
@KFILE not to mention that President Obama, members of his campaign or WH staff were not under DOJ investigation at that time or any other.
Aside from being completely unethical and possibly illegal, Trump's interference with DOJ on the Nunes memo was also a major tactical mistake. Let a thousand leaks flow.
