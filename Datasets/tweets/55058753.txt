@CynthiaBarrett Thanks, we're very happy to be coming home!
@kats2009 It certainly helps to see them up close, to gain an appreciation for just how impressive they are, but we do our best to describe!
More BIG but HOW big: Stennis has its own ZIP code (96615), fire/police/EMTs and feeds 5,000+ Sailors every day on deployment!
Stennis is BIG, but HOW big? 1,092 feet long and 257 feet wide at flight deck, 244 feet keel-to-mast, & 97k tons of PURE MUSCLE.
