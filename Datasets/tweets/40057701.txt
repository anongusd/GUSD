Running as an Independent‚Äîwhich could secure Trump‚Äôs reelection‚Äîis not ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù at all. In fact, it is extremely reckless.
If Schultz really thinks he can lead the country and wants to help ‚Äúthe American people win,‚Äù he should join this field running for the Democratic nomination and make his case.
We are encouraged by the conversations taking place within the Democratic primary process, and the new dynamic faces joining the race with each passing week.
This moment calls for a leader who can take on Trump head to head and win. And the person best positioned to do so is a Democrat with vision who can marshal a broad progressive coalition of liberal and moderate Democrats and Independent voters.
The stakes are just too high. Our nation is in crisis: civil and voting rights are being eroded, families are being separated at the border, ongoing cyber threats, climate protections are being dismantled, international alliances floundering, and SCOTUS seats are on the line.
Trump is doing everything he can to alienate Democrats and Independent voters, but even if a third-party candidate takes just one-half of one percent they could be a spoiler. Remember Ralph Nader and Bush‚Äôs 537-vote FL ‚Äúwin‚Äù?
What matters in 2020 is removing Donald Trump from the White House. Full stop.

These cruel changes from DHS could allow them to block aspiring immigrants in the future and kick out even established lawful immigrants here today. /end
An immigrant family of four, making close to the median income of $61,000 will face intense scrutiny under the new rule, regardless of whether they actual used social safety net programs. /8
Green card holders and other legal immigrants generally wait years to receive visas and then are still ineligible for the vast majority of federally funded safety net programs for the first 5 yrs they are here‚Äîeven while they are paying taxes &amp; contributing to our communities. /7
But this is also not solving a real problem with our immigration system. Most immigrants are already prohibited from most major federal safety net programs. /6 https://t.co/VwZL96fjWQ
And for legal permanent residents who are already here, it could be grounds for deportation for up to 5 years after their arrival in the US. /5
Here‚Äôs how Trump can use this rule to restrict legal immigration: an immigrant found to be at risk of becoming a "public charge" under this expanded definition could be denied a visa from abroad and barred from applying for a green card if they are already here. /4

That is exactly the approach of modern #OpportunityDems‚Äîand it puts Abrams in a great position to make history in Georgia and deliver progress for millions of its residents. Talk about hope and change.
She rightly notes that GA businesses desperately need access to capital to succeed, she‚Äôs pledged to expand Medicaid to cover more Georgians, and supports raising the minimum wage (which unites all Democrats).
Rather than running on the policies advocated by some further to the left, she has energized the base while promoting a platform to ensure that economic opportunity is available to all Georgians.
Abrams is modeling how Democrats can and must speak directly to the values and desires of people from all parts of the Democratic coalition. That‚Äôs why she attracted such wide support during the primary and won 153/159 counties.
.@Edsall's latest piece includes polling on the bold policy ideas from our Opportunity Agenda. It shows that Dem voters favor these modern ideas, but we‚Äôd say Stacey Abrams (also referenced in the piece) has made them central to her pitch to GA voters. https://t.co/kfUVBKiVmh

Health care decisions should be between a patient and her doctor, not politicians pushing their own dangerous agenda. #NoGagRule
Doctors need to be able to talk to their patients about ALL health care options. This new rule dangerously restricts health care access for millions of Americans.
And 4 million patients receive vital health care services because of Title X. Today‚Äôs rule means fewer cancer screenings, STI, and pre-natal care for women.
Make no mistake: these sites are where millions of women receive basic health care. @TWSocialPol reports 60% of women seeking contraception considered it to be their usual source for medical care. https://t.co/MEGhQ5kJsw

That's important because they lead to good jobs! @ChrisCoons notes in @thehill more than 90% of those who complete #apprenticeships land jobs with annual wages that exceed $60,000.
These Apprenticeship Hubs are organizations that connect local employers, colleges, unions, and other players to determine the needs in their community and create an apprentice pipeline that fills workforce gaps with the skilled workers employers need.
To create significantly more apprenticeships, @ChrisCoons' new initiative to create #Apprenticeship Hubs across America would stand up new registered apprenticeship programs in high-growth industries.

Congress must give our gun laws the teeth they need to shut down the iron pipeline and keep guns out of the wrong hands. https://t.co/g1SxQLSWkp https://t.co/146LLjDa7u
This amendment also prohibits ATF from requiring gun dealers to perform regular inventory checks and requires the destruction of all background check records within 24 hours of a gun sale. Ridiculous. https://t.co/uzAbWRfzAZ
Yes, you read that correctly. On paper. This is absurd, especially considering that ATF receives about 1,118 requests per day. https://t.co/d2LWLpdVbn
It is critical that we encourage states to submit mental health records to databases used for background checks. This is an important step to keeping guns out of the wrong hands. https://t.co/ptAGdJmpen

The least Congress can do is expand background checks to online gun sales and/or at gun shows. If you‚Äôre too dangerous to buy a gun at a store you shouldn‚Äôt be able to purchase one online. Period. https://t.co/g1SxQLSWkp https://t.co/rx9c7IcZuE

#TaxReform could boost growth with targeted investments in worker training, left-behind communities, and research and development. 		The Republican-only plan does not.
#TaxReform could strengthen the opportunity to earn by letting low- and middle-income workers keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, while asking the most fortunate to give up some of their tax breaks. 		The #GOPTaxPlan does the opposite.
#TaxReform could strengthen the opportunity to earn a good retirement by putting our nation‚Äôs fiscal trajectory on a more secure path. 		The #GOPTaxPlan adds $2 TRILLION in debt.
#TaxReform could expand opportunity for workers by increasing the EITC for those without kids. 		The #GOPTaxPlan does not.
#TaxReform could create jobs and opportunity by investing international transition revenue in repairing America‚Äôs infrastructure. 		The #GOPTaxPlan does not.
There are several ways #TaxReform can achieve this. But on nearly every count, the #GOPTaxPlan falls short‚Ä¶ or goes backwards.
#TaxReform genuinely has the potential to grow the economy and expand opportunity for American families who value the opportunity to earn a good life.

@InnovateEconomy @mikeallen @GovRaimondo Amazon alone won‚Äôt fix the scarcity of opportunity. But public and private leaders working together to create opportunity is a great start.
@InnovateEconomy @mikeallen @GovRaimondo That means entrepreneurs and workers in huge parts of the country have been left behind, anxious for the opportunity to earn a good life.

@InnovateEconomy 1/6 Cleveland has a population of 2M struggling to find the opportunity to earn with the area unemployment rate at 6.8% https://t.co/9g1Ao7R0WD

@HorwitzGabe The American private sector cannot compete against entire nations for investments in innovation. (see https://t.co/LEW4HEOnBN) #TrumpBudget
@HorwitzGabe #TrumpBudget shows at best a tenuous understanding of investment economics and at worst a malicious intent to Make America Fall Behind.
@HorwitzGabe Jon Cowan was 100% right when he said of the leaked #TrumpBudget "If it were to be enacted, this budget would be a catastrophe for America."
@HorwitzGabe Grants for oceanic research, updated community learning centers, &amp; healthcare quality improvements are gone altogether in the #TrumpBudget.
@HorwitzGabe #TrumpBudget reductions to energy technology investments are massive‚Äîabandoning America‚Äôs economic, national security, &amp; science leadership.
@HorwitzGabe And the #TrumpBudget decimates American innovation across the board. Discretionary funding for NIH set to drop by a fifth, NSF by a tenth.
@HorwitzGabe It will decline if we eliminate initiatives to revitalize American #manufacturing like the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. #TrumpBudget
