@SmallMetalOwl I wish we could. People choosing to care for others instead of outsourcing it to government is better for everyone. Requires a spiritual growth that our culture seems to fight though :(
@iowahawkblog @redsteeze You‚Äôre a blast in a glass.
Sure, let‚Äôs depend on a government, in which a huge number of lawmakers just publicly supported denying care to infants who survive abortion, to guide us in ‚Äúpro-family‚Äù policies.
But yeah, lets encourage people of faith to depend on a godless government that actively persecutes them for practicing it in the workplace. Good grief.
@SmallMetalOwl Well, let‚Äôs think. For days you don‚Äôt get paid, your church, your village, your community could/should assist where and when needed, be it a bill payment as an example.
We‚Äôve outsourced voluntary stewardship of our fellow man to government, which does a horrible job, and exploits the opening to exceed its enumerated powers.

@OGPapaware Private transfers are still federally regulated and there isn‚Äôt a shred of evidence showing the homicide rate is driven by legal transfers between law-abiding people. 2017 GAO study shows it‚Äôs black market-fueled. Car ownership is a privilege, firearm ownership a natural right.
I just think it‚Äôs weird for a lawmaker to talk so much about ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and then fight against notifying law enforcement when people who are in the country illegally try to buy guns. He refuses to answer why on this, btw.

Every aspect of firearm ownership, purchase, carry, and transfer is federally regulated. To assert otherwise is irresponsibly misleading and you‚Äôd be right to question the motive of those who falsely state otherwise.
I've purchased firearms both online &amp; at gun shows &amp; every single time have undergone a background check either with FFL on site (if in my state) or through my FFL at home if out of state. Furthermore, evidence shows legal private transfers are NOT what is contributing to crime.
This is incorrect. All of this falls under federal regulation and purchases through Internet still go through FFL for pickup. A criminal act is not a ‚Äúloophole.‚Äù You do a disservice to your constituents by misleading them on gun law. https://t.co/TOl69lw22X

@GunReformRyan @AndySmith9999 I‚Äôm repeating myself now. He was charged with a felony which in that state renders someone a prohibited person, regardless. It was never entered when he was charged, meaning the existing law was not followed.
@GunReformRyan @AndySmith9999 When a 4473 is filled out and processed through NICS to NCIC, it is a BGC. The flaw isn‚Äôt in the law, it‚Äôs in the human error of improper input or negligence, which itself is a violation of law. Yours isn‚Äôt the correct focus.

@GunReformRyan @AndySmith9999 @RepTedDeutch @SenatorMenendez Furthermore, in this state simply being charged with a felony renders one a PP until proven innocent or determined guilty. Bottom line is that the record was incorrectly entered and remained such for weeks. No waiting period solves that.

@springerthings It wasn‚Äôt a lie that this amount of cases where legality couldn‚Äôt be established raised red flags resulting in an investigation. I understand you read one leaning story and think that covers it, but you should really listen to the actual interview.
@chriskromm @realJacobAirey It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúthrown out‚Äù arbitrarily; they were cases where legality couldn‚Äôt be established thus triggering a county-by-county investigation. Initially it was higher until a number were proven to be naturalizations not req‚Äôd for record by DPS.
@MacMargi Or maybe you‚Äôre projecting? God bless.

Abrams‚Äô response was better than the bizarre joint Schumer - Pelosi remarks, but you can‚Äôt fake people out of believing in job creation they personally benefit from and an increase in their take home pay.
Abrams says upholding voting integrity ‚Äî like the 58,000 people who illegally voted here in Texas or the sophisticated voter fraud ring in Tarrant County (I spoke today to AG @KenPaxtonTX re this) ‚Äî is suppression. Votes cancelled by fraud isn‚Äôt though?
Abrams‚Äô response is highly negative, insisting the tax reform effects ‚Äî resulting in record low unemployment in every demo &amp; allowing Americans to keep the money they earned ‚Äî was imaginary. Simply not true.
What‚Äôs missing from Abrams‚Äô story is that her dad had the free will to give, and edify himself through giving. The intimated socialism robs individuals of the ability to choose improvement. Even God gives free will. Big gov‚Äôt won‚Äôt allow for that.
Sort of awkward for Abrams to have a bunch of people standing behind her like a choir.
He‚Äôs setting up the framing for the fight of 2020: The positive, world-changing freedom defined by America vs dreary socialist stagnation, the likes of which ruined Venezuela‚Äôs economy and stalled Europe. Smart. #SOTU

@sportsjunkie781 @KeithApland I think u misunderstand me. Even private transfers are subject to GCA. Alabama isn‚Äôt excluded as it‚Äôs a fed law. Prohibited persons cannot just go to another state (and legal purchases still must go thru one‚Äôs home FFL). But, nothing substantiates mass crime from legal prvt sale.
@sportsjunkie781 @KeithApland Furthermore, a prohibited possessor in possessor‚Äôs state of residence is a prohibited possessor no matter where they go; another felony on top of the felony of not going thru FFL. I‚Äôve purchased many, many guns in other states. Always go thru FFL.
@sportsjunkie781 @KeithApland Wrong. Private deals are regulated under GCA and persons must transfer purchases through FFLs (like I just did when I got a rifle in Vegas) ‚Äî&gt; 	18 U.S.C. 922(a)(3) and (5), 922(b)(3), 27 CFR 478.29 and 478.30. Violation is a felony.

And ‚Äúfrat boys‚Äù don‚Äôt stand there peacefully while a group of grown men bang drums in their faces and scream at them on camera to go back to Europe, while the other grown men call them ‚Äúincest babies‚Äù racial and gay slurs on camera, you barely literate biased hack.

I love the MO of these legacy hacks: Pen poorly written hit piece wherein you maliciously impugn the character of innocent people, then cry ‚Äúpoor me!‚Äù when you‚Äôre criticized for using your rag as a cudgel. You people are NOT the victims.
To which it seems the entire rag‚Äôs staff spent literally an entire day attacking me, in addition to attacking children. Attack, not disagree, which is what you grotesquely label any civil challenge of presented policy while whining that I publicly criticized your actual smear.
And let‚Äôs not forget, this began because your rag spent a DISTURBING amount of effort attacking children ‚Äî not disagreeing with them, ATTACKING them for wearing red hats, one authored by the cowardly @jschladey who lacks the courage to even defend her own bizarre bully piece. https://t.co/u4tgVmeVMu

And I‚Äôve never engaged in that level of discourse during this ongoing debate as it helps nothing. The @NYDailyNews has treated the Covington kids horribly and now seeks to cover their backside by presenting disagreement over policy regarding Parkland as worse. Shame on you Nancy.
I will absolutely disagree with points made during policy discussions ‚Äî even as I‚Äôm repeatedly told I ‚Äúown Congress,‚Äù and am responsible for ‚Äúmurder,‚Äù called a ‚Äúterrorist,‚Äù by those involved in the discussion. But good ol @NYDailyNews omits that side of the discussion.
The @NYDailyNews news is so mad that I defended the Covington kids from these awful media hit jobs that they‚Äôve now printed two maliciously false hit pieces on me, hid when I called them to account and irresponsibly presented disagreement as persecution.

When I told him this on camera at the CNN townhall, Scott Israel denied it. Prosecutors across the state disagreed: https://t.co/gZTvVpm1nQ
Because of the murderer‚Äôs digital death threats, Scott Israel could have arrested him under state statute 836.10, and rendered him a prohibited possessor.
The murderer‚Äôs threats to kill were made before it was reported that he had purchased a firearm, December 2016; he reportedly purchased the firearm in February 2017.
The murderer sent digital threats and left a huge, actionable digital trail https://t.co/zxJVc0Akg3

By playing this game, politicians make it look like they‚Äôre doing something to help but really, they‚Äôre just giving themselves a pass to do any actual work that would truly reduce illegal use and possession of firearms and reduce gun homicides.

What classifies something as an ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù is none of the things described here.

Last thought: These people disagree with this report, but know it would look bad for them to argue with the security experts, police, teachers, parents who actually made the determinations, so they dishonestly try to attribute the whole thing to me to continue with their agenda.

I don‚Äôt think this is solely an issue of simple, legitimate criticism; the timing is weird, the charge rather big, and there are a couple of aspects of Romney‚Äôs op/ed with which I take some issue (discussing on air today; live in 45 minutes).
@BobbyBroad Happy new year my friend.
@BobbyBroad So then Romney would have to acknowledge that he benefitted at least one way from Trump in the WH, lol.
@Seanfucious What moral failing of his has adversely impacted policy? While this is no defense, and he wasn‚Äôt my candidate during the primary, I‚Äôm amused that people think elected officials aren‚Äôt simply reflections of themselves.
Perhaps you don‚Äôt share this view, but realize many voters do. It will be a problem with which Romney must content going forward. He could be a real unifier ‚Ä¶ or we could essentially have another intra-party war. Time will tell.
I‚Äôve heard this more times than I can count from listeners across the country. Some now are struck by this newfound aggressiveness in pols like Romney, who, to them, seems to be doing more here to oppose the GOP than Democrats. A top radio topic today due to listener email.
Here‚Äôs what some still don‚Äôt realize: Many voters interpreted the lack of aggression in fighting for them (from previous GOP pols) to mean a lack of concern for their problems. Voters know they didn‚Äôt pick a nice guy. It‚Äôs why they voted the way they did.
The Romney v Trump war has begun. Couple observations:	1) Interesting to see some conservatives who rejected what they called Romney's big government-ness now embrace him now as the anti-Trump pol.	2) Everyone is being played to divide the field for 2020.
@ljkenn177 We‚Äôre talking about legal adults here, which I should have clarified by drawing pictures to illustrate for the deliberately obtuse.
RT @michaelmalice: Elizabeth Warren would be more unlikable if she were a man
@_chickmiko Once again, she‚Äôs no clue what she‚Äôs discussing. They could have adjudicated him unfit then and confiscated his arms. FL prosecutors disagree with her: https://t.co/XZrgDfT7ha

@tedlindsay66 So your correct response is ‚Äúthe Broward Sheriff could have started by limiting his access to guns.‚Äù
@tedlindsay66 I am not responsible for the Broward Sheriff refusing to follow up on scores of calls directly to his department, some from the murderer‚Äôs own family members, begging him to confiscate his weapons after he attacked his mother and threatened to kill fellow students the first time.

@normiss2000 Here‚Äôs me addressing this misinterpretation a couple of years ago: https://t.co/m8Y8pNwjh5
The media that went at Romney over things like ‚Äúbinders full of women‚Äù is happy to use him as a cudgel against Trump, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they find him more palatable today than they did in 2012. I hope no one mistakes this strategy for that.

The sad truth is that Twitter can‚Äôt regulate the hate in people‚Äôs hearts and the tribalism in their minds. At the very least though, they could make their platform more inclusive and enforce consistent TOS.
Twitter was fun before the bots, the anonymous cowards who issue horrible threats, the antisemites who post awful comments presented as sermons. At the very least Twitter should go the FB route and demand accountability over anonymity; prevent farmed mobs from targeting accts.
Sure, private companies can do what they want, including running their platforms into the ground, but can we stop pretending now that progressives aren‚Äôt trying to silence people?
I took a five day break from Twitter over Thanksgiving and it was glorious. The platform has become the epicenter of hate in national discourse. As @willcain said, it‚Äôs also full of fakery: Fake accounts/bots, fake concern, fake TOS, fake overtures to consistency and fairness.

And since I lived there most of my life (downtown, not burbs and it was in my hood) and covered it extensively, the problem is a spike in gang violence, drugs, and a rotten judicial system that lets repeat offenders off with minimum penalty. Recidivism is high.
@marneyike 2 was in response to early reports that he carried a rifle, evidenced by subsequent Tweets w link. Carry is still banned in IL hospitals. Also, applying for a card isn‚Äôt the same as reciprocity. One must still apply through TX and only a handful of states are allowed to do so.

If y‚Äôall are looking, Hobby Lobby comes through with shotgun shell lights since Walmart is sold out. üá∫üá∏üéÑü§òüèº https://t.co/tyFdZzRf3y
All of this is why Swalwell wouldn‚Äôt answer my question. It‚Äôs impossible without having to admit the goal is to ban all semi-auto firearms. /finis.
Lastly for real this time, the presence of a pistol grip doesn‚Äôt affect the velocity of a round. I‚Äôm not even sure why anyone would intimate such.
@jeffersonianguy @ScottAdamsSays This exactly.
Lastly, threatening (either seriously or even facetiously, progressives tell me nuance and euphemisms are dead and everything is literal in meaning) voters with nukes because you, not they, don‚Äôt understand the argument is both bad lawmaking and advocacy.
Instead, people who claim to care so much for life and solutions, as you will see in the comments, would rather yell ‚ÄúWHORE!‚Äù and ‚ÄúTERRORIST!‚Äù at law-abiding gun owners than engage in any real good faith discussion on the issue, which is why we get nowhere.
The argument also completely excludes a multitude of contributing variables from consideration, like the recidivism rate, the percentage of homicide driven by prohibited possessors, a cultural rot eroding respect for life, etc etc. (cont)
Second, the argument is inconsistent. Example: you want to ban a .223/5.56 but not a .308 or 30.06? Have you actually compared these rifles? See photo for reference. You‚Äôre arguing for an unknowledgeable ban of things based strictly on cosmetic appearances. https://t.co/RNbt0K4YG5
First, the majority of gun homicide is due to illegally possessed handguns. This is supported by FBI UCRs (2016 for example https://t.co/R93AZfNrQB ) .
He and others know enough to stop short of saying ‚Äúsemi-auto rifles‚Äù so they use the vague and non-technical ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù descriptor as though they only mean some rifles and not all of them. Two problems with this. (2 of a few)
This simply reinforces my suspicion that Swalwell uses ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù interchangeably with ‚Äúsemi-auto rifle.‚Äù He wants to legislate based on a rifle‚Äôs appearance and not the actual mechanics or caliber of the rifle. (1 of a few)
I guess @RepSwalwell is unable to answer this question. https://t.co/9sWPLWdHsf

@chesire2050 I read the exact same article that you did.
This is why it‚Äôs important to wait for facts and allow the investigation to continue. (End for now)
Also ‚Äî (and again, spoke with @guyrelford on this) most DGU is from 5-7 feet. Roberson had the armed perp pinned to the ground. Fair to ask if he was worried perp would shoot him if he let up. We weren‚Äôt there and do not know. (cont.)
(I‚Äôve personally done stress training where I missed some commands because I was pushed to my limit. It‚Äôs an actual thing backed by scientific research. Again, why we train).  (cont)
‚Ä¶ knows that your senses go haywire. It‚Äôs why people train, because you fall back on highest level of your training. Some people legitimately do not hear. Spoke of this yesterday with @guyrelford . (cont)
Third, and I‚Äôm speculating here, I‚Äôd imagine that Roberson was in fight or flight mode at this point. Article states police shouted commands to drop weapon, fair to ask if Roberson heard ‚Äî anyone who‚Äôs done stress training or been in this mode ‚Ä¶ (1 of few)
Secondly, according to available info, he held the perp as LEO arrived to respond. The info available doesn‚Äôt read as though he was going to turn the tables and become the aggressor after subduing the perp. (1 of a few)
First, Roberson absolutely did intervene when the perp opened fire, stopping or impeding what would be legally defined as a mass shooting. (1 of a few)

@flungoutofspace Buying across state lines in CA is irrelevant since upon entering the state you have to register your weapon or be considered an importer. How does a federal law make that more illegal?
@LiesLies45 @NRA @karenhandel There are literally two different laws. 2000 criminalized sale. 2016 criminalized possession and was unenforceable. The murderer obtained his illegally, unless your argument is that he bought it in 2000 when he was 10. Either way, he violated law.

@MultaniSaint @ClockworkDan Are you deliberately obtuse? These are two different laws. One barred sale, one barred possession. Have as much knowledge as you do zeal.
@ClockworkDan He got the gun legally, not the mag. You don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre talking about thus adding nothing to this conversation.
@ClockworkDan It changed nothing of the fact that they were made illegal in 2000. For your argument to make sense the murderer then got his extended mag at age 10 ‚Äî or he got it illegally. My point stands.

@aplusk We do have BGCs. CA has universal BGCs, plus a 10 day waiting period, registration, mag capacity limit, red flag laws, ammo only through an FFL, &amp; an assault weapons ban. What we desperately need is awareness re mental health, education, and follow through on adjudication.

@Joshua_Mikel How do you enforce mag restrictions considering they‚Äôre incredibly easy to fabricate and all someone needs is a second mag for reload? Please explain.
@BalamutAG I believe that kicks in after the first of the year.
@Joshua_Mikel Explain how. If he purchased the handgun outside of CA he still had to register it with the state or be labeled an unlawful ‚Äúimporter.‚Äù The mag was illegal capacity in state regardless of fed law.
@MIGR8Heart No, you are a chauvinist who incorporated a sexual slur into your hateful response to a woman. You aren‚Äôt worth speaking to anymore. Be better.
@McKenzieMcCabe It‚Äôs in the first sentence because I was literally asked a question about mental illness. If it was stereotypical I would have not deferred to waiting for facts.
@MIGR8Heart I responded to questions. What sort of chauvinist are you to shame a woman just because you dislike her beliefs? Please step into the modern era.
@ERICstein63 I do believe it is a mental health issue. That‚Äôs where focus and discussion should start.
@LaLinda63 That argument doesn‚Äôt make sense though. If he purchased handgun out of state CA law requires him to register it with the state. Mag capacity was over legal limit. Appeal to fed law isn‚Äôt applicable due to state.
@GABkicksass @ABlackAmericanM @mgio90 @hoggomcswineass @maddyainey1 Actually, the issue is the same group of 1400 prohibited possessors driving the majority of the crime, according to the Chicago PD superintendent: https://t.co/yeAxEaFPdv

@ERICstein63 @WalshFreedom Respectfully, I absolutely DID answer your question. Furthermore I‚Äôve participated in countless panel discussions and a very heated townhall where nothing could be discussed. So I think that shows they have and are. Question is, why did CA laws not stop?
@CoupleDumb False. Obama admin changed rule to allow non-health professionals to declare social security beneficiaries prohibited possessors sans mental health eval. Trump admin reversed and restored eval. Learn of what you speak.
