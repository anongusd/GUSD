The Republican tax bill gave Big Pharma a huge tax cut and the seven CEOs who are testifying today made over $100 million in compensation in 2017. Can someone explain why they aren‚Äôt bringing down drug prices?
It‚Äôs pretty clear. Big Pharma charges more because it can. People in Michigan deserve better and they should be able to afford their medicine here at home. https://t.co/Xw0T5ZPJSr

Humira is the world‚Äôs best-selling drug. It treats arthritis, Crohn‚Äôs disease, and ulcerative colitis. AbbVie Pharmaceuticals, which makes Humira, is offering up to 80% discounts to people in Europe to buy Humira.

None of this has to be happening. The President can easily end the #TrumpShutdown by signing the bipartisan government funding bills that have been passed by the House and Senate.
And beyond SNAP, school meals, support for women, infants, and children, and food for seniors are all at risk if this shutdown does not come to an end.
The #TrumpShutdown threatens the 38 million people who rely on SNAP to put food on the table, including many seniors, children, and people with disabilities. They should have long-term certainty that food assistance will be available.

It is absolutely critical that we find new opportunities for our workers who have lost their jobs. I told Mary Barra that @GM must also make sure that future investments are made in Michigan ‚Äì not overseas. I will continue to stand with Michigan‚Äôs autoworkers no matter what.
I just finished meeting with @GM CEO Mary Barra and members of the Michigan delegation. I am deeply disappointed by the GM plant closures in Michigan and the devastating impact it will have on our workers, their families, and our communities.

And given last week‚Äôs devastating report on climate change, this is absolutely not the time to be scaling back our support for electric vehicles. https://t.co/2MeSPIU3xD
It is absolutely critical that these workers have new job opportunities and support for their families and communities.
My focus is the more than 1800 people in Michigan who will be losing their jobs because of GM‚Äôs decision to stop production of certain vehicles and close their plants in Detroit-Hamtramck and Warren.
President Trump‚Äôs call to end the electric vehicle tax credit is the exact opposite of what we should be doing right now. This is a time when we should be supporting the new jobs being created for our talented auto workers, not doubling down on policies that will hurt them. https://t.co/YDfKPRw1Q6
These updates, including the construction of a new Poe-sized lock, are vital for our Michigan businesses as well as national defense and will benefit us for years to come.

I will continue to stand with Michigan's autoworkers and our communities no matter what.
As GM considers future investments and products, it is critical that those investments be made in Michigan - not overseas! And most importantly it is critical to find opportunities for the workers who've lost their jobs because of today's announcement.
I am deeply disappointed by the GM plant closures announcement today and the devastating impact it will have on our workers, their families and our communities. Michigan has the best autoworkers in the world and I know there's no job that they can't handle.

Patients should have the right to know if they can save money by paying cash out-of-pocket rather than using their insurance and their pharmacists should have the right to tell them.

This is yet another reason why Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. But if he is, he must recuse himself from Mueller probe matters.  https://t.co/8is9510HpH
We need a SCOTUS justice who protects our democracy, not one who has already opened the door to letting foreign adversaries interfere in our elections.
That‚Äôs why I will vote no on President Trump‚Äôs nominee to lead the IRS  until he makes it clear that he will stop this undercutting of our  elections process!
Now, just days after the DOJ indicted 12 Russians as part of Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian interference in our election, the Administration is making it even easier to hide spending by special interests! This is appalling and must be stopped! https://t.co/wAt6T0GKaY

Today on #Juneteenth we commemorate the end of slavery and recommit to the fight for equal rights, opportunity and justice for all Americans.
The bill includes a bipartisan amendment that overturns a Trump Administration decision to lift a ban on ZTE, a Chinese telecom company that violated US sanctions on Iran and North Korea and is a threat to our security and privacy. This provision needs to stay in the bill!
We also included funding for upgrades to the A-10 fighter jet that will help keep A-10s operational at Selfridge Air National Guard base in Macomb County as well as funding to develop a Next General Combat Vehicle prototype at the Detroit Arsenal in Warren.
In the bill, we increased support to address PFAS chemical contamination and are making important progress towards upgrading the Soo Locks.
Last night, I voted in favor of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which passed out of the Senate and how heads to conference with the House. Our bill invests in our nation‚Äôs defense and gives our men and women in uniform a pay raise.

This week, we added a bipartisan provision to the Senate National Defense Authorization Act to restore the ban on ZTE. It is critical that this stays in the final bill. https://t.co/pmT9rxL2mX
That‚Äôs why I was very concerned when President Trump decided to side with ZTE and China and overturn the ban. That decision threatens our national security, our economy, and our privacy.
These were the right things to do. ZTE‚Äôs actions were deeply concerning and many national security leaders feared that the company was looking for a backdoor way to spy on our military and our businesses.
Soon after, the Pentagon banned the sale of ZTE phones on military bases amid fears the phones could be used to spy on our troops.
Earlier this year, the Commerce Department issued a ban on Chinese telecom company ZTE for violating our sanctions on Iran and North Korea.
This week, the Senate is voting on the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides important support for our troops and includes my provision to complete a critical study that will move funding for the Soo Locks forward.

The reports have been completed but they haven‚Äôt been released to the public or to Members of Congress! The public has a right to see whether our Buy American laws are working, and if they‚Äôre not, what actions can be taken to strengthen them.
Last year, Pres. Trump issued an executive order calling for federal agencies to report on how they can better comply with our nation‚Äôs Buy American laws, which protect American workers and manufacturers.

It‚Äôs clear that the Veterans Choice program has failed many of those it was intended to serve. That‚Äôs why I am introducing a new bill, the Veterans Deserve Better Act, to ensure that these serious issues are addressed so that our veterans get the care they deserve.
Jerry is not alone in facing issues with the Veterans Choice program. This program was designed to make it easier for veterans to see their doctors, especially veterans who live in rural areas.
Jerry contacted my office about this problem and we were able to work with him and Veterans Choice to finally schedule an appointment. But it shouldn‚Äôt have taken Jerry five months to get the care he needed, especially for something so scary and serious.
I heard from one veteran of the National Guard, Jerry Sorensen, who was diagnosed with a lesion on his brain and needed to see a specialist.  Veterans Care sent him to the wrong doctor not once but twice!  That‚Äôs outrageous!
I am hearing repeated complaints from veterans, providers, and hospitals across the state of Michigan about serious problems they‚Äôre facing with the Veterans Choice program.
Our veterans should not have to stand at the back of any line, especially when it comes to seeing their doctors.

Michigan families deserve better than this tax bill. You deserve real reform that creates jobs, increases wages, and puts more money in your pocket.
If Republicans are serious about putting more money in the pockets of the middle class, they should support my amendment. The proof is in your paycheck!
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve offered an amendment that will ensure that the benefits of this tax bill go to the middle class. Under my amendment, if the average household wage doesn‚Äôt go up by at least $4000 by the beginning of 2020, the corporate tax rate would return to its current level.
The White House promised that the average American family would get a $4000 raise under this tax bill. Well, the proof is in their paychecks.
And it would balloon our deficit and give Republicans an excuse to make huge cuts to Medicare and Social Security.
It would cause health insurance premiums to go up by 10 percent while 13 million fewer people would have coverage.
It increases taxes on 87 million Americans who earn less than $200,000.
There‚Äôs no question we need tax reform that creates jobs, helps small businesses, and puts more money in the pockets of middle-class families in Michigan. Unfortunately, that is not what this Republican bill does.

January will also be a bad month for Michigan‚Äôs community health centers. Nearly 20,000 people will lose access to health care if Congress doesn‚Äôt act. Last year, Michigan‚Äôs community health centers treated more than 680,000 patients, including 12,710 veterans.
97 percent of kids in Michigan can see a doctor today, the highest percentage ever. We cannot backtrack on the progress we have made and we cannot turn our backs on families who rely on the children‚Äôs health insurance program!
Many states are preparing to shut down their children‚Äôs health programs if Congress doesn‚Äôt act soon. That means wait lists, cancellation notices, and kids across the country not being able to see their doctors.  https://t.co/BByyuGki6r
In Michigan, 100,000 children are covered by MIChild. Yet unless Congress acts soon, MIChild will begin running out of funding as early as January.
It has been nearly two full months since Republicans let funding expire for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program and community health centers, even though there is bipartisan support for these programs.

I remain committed to tax reform that makes it easier to do your taxes, puts more money back in your pocket and actually helps our small businesses, manufacturers and farmers. This Republican bill falls short!
The Republican tax bill also would allow big businesses to deduct their state and local taxes, including property taxes, from their tax bill. But,   when you‚Äôre doing your taxes, you would no longer be allowed to deduct your state and local taxes!
For example, the Republican tax bill keeps a tax loophole allowing corporations to write off their expenses when they ship jobs overseas but if you are moving to Michigan to take a new job, this bill eliminates your tax deduction for moving expenses!
It‚Äôs becoming more and more clear every day: this tax bill is a huge giveaway to the wealthy. Republicans can‚Äôt hide the fact that it hurts middle-class families! https://t.co/uEB56o7sx0

We need tax reform that does not ask middle-class families to shoulder the burden so that taxes can be cut for the wealthy.
It would give 80% of the benefits to the top 1%, take away important tax incentives for Michigan small biz &amp; manufacturers + add to deficit
But this Republican plan is based on trickle-down economics, which has NEVER worked! It's a bad deal for the people of Michigan.
I‚Äôll be the first to say our tax code is too complicated and we need reform that helps create jobs and puts more money in your pocket.
They want to cut taxes for the rich and hope we believe economic growth will make up for the loss to our schools, communities &amp; natl defense

There is no reason why the Senate cannot take up my bipartisan bill to fund CHIP &amp; pass it now. My statement: https://t.co/rHAbU9pWTL
We could see cancellation notices going out to families, wait lists or enrollment changes, and kids could be unable to see their doctor.
It is unacceptable that Congress failed to meet the deadline to extend critical funding for children‚Äôs health insurance.
Here we go again. The Republican budget is just a backdoor way to cut Medicare and Medicaid! https://t.co/UiBzLob1WA
@SenateFinance The answer was no. I‚Äôll continue to take on the drug companies to bring down costs for #Michigan families.
Today in @SenateFinance, I asked if the most recent tax proposal holds pharmaceutical companies accountable for paying their fair share.
One of the concerns I hear about most from #Michigan families is the astronomical cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/IfdutDs7WX

Congress needs to do its job and pass our bipartisan bill to extend CHIP for five years so that all kids can see a doctor.
We could see cancellation notices going out to families, wait lists or enrollment changes and - ultimately - kids unable to see a doctor.
If that happens, states will run of out of funding and children in #Michigan could lose access to coverage.
üö®Funding for the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program is set to expire this weekend.

@USCBO If your parents or grandparents rely on nursing home care provided by Medicaid, this bill could take away their coverage.
@USCBO If you have cancer or diabetes, this bill could take away your health coverage.

Costs go up and care goes down, all to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires.
Republicans are hiding their bill because they know it‚Äôs a bad deal for the American people and Michigan families.
And if you‚Äôre a senior whose rates are going to skyrocket, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill.
If you‚Äôre a woman who will be charged more for insurance, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill.
If you have epilepsy and will lose your insurance, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill.
If you have cancer and won‚Äôt be able to get coverage, you have a right to know what‚Äôs in the bill.

If your son or daughter has a preexisting condition like diabetes, autism, a heart condition, cancer they might not get covered.
Their bill would kick 24 million people off their health insurance and create chaos in the health care system.
House Republicans instead are voting on a plan that raises costs for less care &amp; takes us back to days when insurance co's were in charge.
We need to work across the aisle to lower health care costs for Michigan families &amp; small biz, bring down prescription drug costs &amp; more.

Senate Rs are failing Government 101. The refusal to hold hearings on Judge Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court is unprecedented.
Our Fall Roadmap for Senate Rs is simple. Reverse their failing grades and #DoYourJob for American families. https://t.co/lOnZ5PNYsG
