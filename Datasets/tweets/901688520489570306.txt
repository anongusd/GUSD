@RenaDescartes The question becomes are we as a human race so caught up in our own self image that we lose sight of what is happening all around us...
@RenaDescartes Unfortunately nowhere in our Galaxy are there moons detected as close to the planet as ours in tidal lock		 that we have observed.		Stands to reason when it happens especially with a lessening gravity eventually it will go from an erratic wobble to throwing the Moon from orbit
@RenaDescartes The Moon is traveling outward that about an inch and a half 4 year which could lead to a lessening of overall gravity at the same time it is slowing also potentially causing a pooling action.	This will eventually cause #TidalLock 	where the moon stays consistently in one place
@RenaDescartes Exactly, if you looked at that graph though whatever magnetic movement we have going on currently is happening very quickly.		I think a lot of it has to do with the moon myself.	The faster the moon spins the more likely it is to stay evenly distributed throughout the Earth
