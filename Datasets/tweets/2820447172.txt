I told @BloombergTV that under no circumstances can one seriously argue that European auto imports pose a threat to national security. European companies are heavily invested in the U.S. and create hundreds of thousands of jobs:	https://t.co/JuLQipPWxi https://t.co/uHEPZy4PkH
Today I therefore urged the U.S. to conclude its national security investigation of imports of autos &amp; auto parts with a finding that those imports do not threaten U.S. national security. Watch my testimony here (panel 6, after lunch break): https://t.co/C38dOPsZiN
EU auto companies producing in the U.S. contribute significantly to U.S. welfare and employment. They are well integrated in the U.S. value chain and export about 60% of production to third countries, contributing towards improving the U.S. trade balance https://t.co/H2L3bILBp9 https://t.co/ryyBYILM3o
This development harms trade, growth and jobs in the U.S. and abroad, weakens the bonds with friends and allies, and shifts the attention away from the shared strategic challenges that genuinely threaten the market-based Western economic model https://t.co/H2L3bILBp9 https://t.co/oyHa4CAgHV
The EU believes that this current investigation lacks legitimacy and factual basis and would lead the U.S. into a breach of international law. The notion that those imports from U.S. closest allies could threaten U.S. national security is bluntly absurd https://t.co/H2L3bILBp9 https://t.co/C9fCrUeaK3
At today's @CommerceGov hearing on the U.S. national security investigation of imports of autos and auto parts, I expressed the very serious concerns of the EU and its 28 Member States https://t.co/H2L3bILBp9 https://t.co/H12TDGCsq0

.@vestager: We need to step up cooperation to deal w government subsidies. Because those subsidies can seriously harm competition. They can mean the companies that succeed aren't the best &amp; most innovative, but simply the ones with the best connections to government #eurocon2018
