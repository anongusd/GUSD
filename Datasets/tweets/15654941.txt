It is insidious. It is exhausting (to watch). And it is supremely depressing to see journalists betray their own ideals of professionalism and ethics (to seek truth and report it, for example) by giving voice to a source who is so often demonstrably and provably false.
Her lies and distortions and attempts to smear the press, all while smiling and acting as if it is all a huge game, is doing, I think, real damage not just to this administration and to the news media but to the idea of truth itself, to the belief in shared values and mores.
And other viewers are likely to be outraged and frustrated too by how easily and casually she disregards facts, reality, what her boss actually said or did (or tweeted) in furtherance of an "alternative" narrative in which Trump, and ONLY Trump, is right.
I can only assume that networks book her to outrage and infuriate their viewers, regardless of their politics: Trump supporters are likely to hate the interviewer (because Conway always, ALWAYS makes it about how the press, and by proxy, the interviewer, is unfair to Trump).
It stuns me that CNN et al. still book Kellyane Conway - the one who coined "alternative facts" as counterpoint to, I suppose, REAL or TRUE facts. In my entire life I have never seen a spokesperson who defers, deflects, dissembles, distorts, and disinforms as much as she does. https://t.co/1GFMF3RpBD

BUT, since you've asked ME to judge, I will - I'd say one funhouse-mirror reflection on an astronaut's visor is NOT sufficient proof that the picture is a stagehand. (It looks like a space suit to me, even if it is a bit thinner due to being reflected on a curved surface.) https://t.co/N5VVZXmwuX
It's really rather disconcerting when a supposedly trustworthy news source throws its proverbial hands up and says for "you" to "be the judge" as to whether something in the news is fake or not. Especially something not seriously in question like NASA's manned moon missions. https://t.co/N5VVZXmwuX
Umm, I just defended Fox News for this story, pointing out that Newsweek also featured this "story" on their website. However, Newsweek did not tell its readers to "be the judge" whether the picture was fake. (I guess they let NASA do that, seeing as how that's their job.) https://t.co/N5VVZXmwuX
To be fair, Newsweek also featured this, um, "story" on their website, and Fox News did also begin their headline with "Wild conspiracy theory..." I take your point, though - this is hardly worth devoting any time to. (Though the time I just devoted to it was fun - old moon pix!) https://t.co/GyT16gKwD5
Many Trump supporters are more like acolytes in a cult - and on the day after the death of Charles Manson, one of history's most notorious cult leaders, that is a scary thought. They have drunk the Kool Aid (which, remember, is a metaphor from another deadly cult leader). https://t.co/YHQBMmMWIJ

McCain: Lot of blinking.
"My Republicans in hte House of Representatives"? HIS Republicans?
McCain isn't talking into the camera. And he didn't hear that Ted Kennedy has gone home.
...and it's on. Go, Jim!
I graduated on that stage four years ago. Wow.
30 seconds
less than a minute
is getting ready to "twitter" during tonight's presidential debate. (Go to twitter.com to tweat yourself.)
wants to wish a happy 111th birthday to Mr. William Faulkner. And good luck to everyone in Oxford this week ... assuming there is a debate.
wonders if the media is having another "Katrina moment" and waking up to notice what's actually being said in the presidential campaign.
is still shocked, SHOCKED!, that the GOP used a 9/11 "tribute" video at their convention. And that there is gambling in this establishment.
McCain wins the balloon race. More than Reagan! Impressive!
"Balloon wielding thugs." Brian Williams made a funny!
shame on the Republicans, attacking Andrea Mitchell with balloons like that!!!
applause lines that got no applause. ouch.
Chris Matthews: crowd applauding McCain's "DIVORCE" ... from the current GOP administration. (Not his ACTUAL divorce in 1980.)
I mean, balloons. oops.
here come the baloons. missed those last week. BALOONS!
video flag seems a tad fake, even for political theater such as a convention. what, they couldn't get REAL flags?
that giant flag on screen has been bugging me all week.
Crowd is drowning him out. Losing some of the effect. And he doesn't seem quite strident enough. Not much fight left in him. Ouch.
more fighting. fight WITH me. fight WITH me. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT. FIGHT!!!
Why is the U.S. always a HER? We only fight for a "her"?
@ricksanchezcnn me either. it's incredibly disjointed. a few good riffs, but you can'd dance to it.
He missed everything about America. Doesn't mention his wife, Carol.
rowdy youth. must be moving toward the Moving Concluding Personal POW Anecdote.
blessed by misfortune. actually, that's a pretty good line.
He doesn't care who gets the credit for good ideas. Does that mean he doesn't mind if OBAMA gets, uh, "credit" if/when he gets elected?
Putting down Obama for not having scars. Classy guy!
don't hear many "my friends" ... hmmm
and now, our obligatory message of CHANGE. Vote for me - I can make change.
here comes a personal war story; war: the family business.
@Slate Well, he WAS a Naval aviator ... off he goes into the wild blue yonder. Oh wait, that's the Air Force, right?
Oh, we're even going to ATTACK this problem of energy independence. Can't these guys stop all the WAR-mongering???
McCain just ended our dependence on foreign oil. Yippee!
Blame the media, blame the teachers. Do I detect a theme here?
sorry, all you BAD teachers. McCain ain't your friend.
@Slate YES. Very astute observation.
@ricksanchezcnn yes, i think you're right
the CHANGING economy. Nice use of euphemism.
right, the evil SOCIALIZED MEDICINE bogeyman. Boo! Tell that to ... well, sick people in virtually every other industrialized nation....
he's just spewing words at random now ... they don't even have meaning in context
we're all americans. okay.... reward hard work and risk takers. believe in SERVICE??? like ... COMMUNITY service?
oh yeah, OBAMA all BY HIMSELF passed a "corporate welfare" bill for oil companies.
okay ... list of random people who are supposed to represent ... something? 'cause it's better to help a few than to help many.
some more protesters. and they're supposed to keep us SAFE? they can't even keep the "terrorists" out of the HALL.
sounded like a second of silence -- five-second delay for profanity? is someone in the hall CURSING?
was a nice moment when he honored Barack Obama and his supporters for their achievements. too bad it sounded fake.
crowd is looking demoralized.
Interest colors -- greenscreen, and pink. and chants of USA ... to drown out the protesters. yikes
the McCain video is ripping off the musical theme from the TV show "Dallas."
is tired of the same ol' song and dance of "blame the media."
is anxiously watching CNN to see what Gustav does.
is still in amazement about who John McCain chose as his running mate ... and not in a good way.
wonders, now that the Olympics are over, what can I watch on TV for two weeks that might affect the next four years? oh wait...never mind.

is jotting, twittering, netvibing, digging, diigo-ing, blogging, im-ing, and texting ... all while watching the Olympics on an analog TV.
is hoping to get a few more hikes in this week before having to go back to work next week.
