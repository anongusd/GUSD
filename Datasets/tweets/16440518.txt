Romney--"what it means to be poor is different in different States? "
@JamesKotecki Perry probably forgot Ron Paul was in Congress--it's a "Texas" thing - Bush had the same disease- I.Q. glitches
Santorum attacks Ron Paul, is it just because he likes to attack or is he afraid Paul is gaining ground?
@JamesKotecki The Camera operators are also on their facebook page at the same time!
Grover Norquist is put on par with Warren Buffett on who is right about the economy-Grover grows more prominent day by day!
Newt hits the press again for their questions-- He says why does the press always equate balancing the budget with pain
Santorum- "budget pain" question--means testing, food stamps, housing programs-shocker, he did not say cut items that only gay people like
Huntsman gets a good zing to Romney when Romney hit him on taking a job with Obama- he said people are tired of that type of attitude
What is Perry doing on the stage? Thought he was back in Crawford Texas with his clone
when asked about Romney, Paul says question is superficial and proceedings so far is superficial, but, hits Romney's record with civility
Ron Paul is just looking at all of them, he should be good when he speaks
Newt really comes out swinging again against Romne,  said "drop the pious" stuff.  Newt hits hard
Romney answer is good.  Staying on mantra of not being a career politician.
Santorum slams Romney too. Asked, why didn't Romney run again for Governor is his record was so good.

@kevinbinversie I know I should stay on bread, water, and lashes, but tune into the show - http://www.wvly.net 1-3 pm mon-friday edt
@hambypcnn Yes,back, but without the stress of townhalls :-)
@danpatterson POTUS defined the nature of the issue, related to the average working uninsured and walked thru the public option minefield
@danpatterson HELLO, I thought he did an exceptional job of getting the focus back to working toward a solution-he hit the right lingo
Every President has a line  they are rembered for-- ,tonight was Obama's-::,:"we did not come here to fear the future, we came here to s ...
Very strong ending regardless if you agree with him or not
Big round of applause on that last line
:"we did not come here to fear the future, we came here to shape it"
Talking about d's and r's standing together over the years during critical times -
"Sometimes government has to step in"
He is pulling out all stops--relating Kennedy and his causes and the Republicans, including McCain that worked with him
To try and get it back
The propsals for reform are on life support--that is simply why the President is here tonight-He is utilizing the "bully pulpit" and som ...
President says he will not waste time with "those" that just want to use politics to kill reform
I mean't medical malpractice reform not tort
Republicans applauding at the mention of tort reform--president proposes range of ideas of how to have safety yet let doctors practice m ...
He is really stressing payment by getting at waste-fraud-and abuse
The President sure sounds like a moderate tonight
Talking about medicare -not a dollar of the trust fund to be used--(he is re stressing he ability to pay for reform  by attacking waste- ...
Obama says plan can be paid for by finding waste within the system
The president says he will not sign a bill that adds one dime to the deficit (THERE GOES THE BILL !!! )
"If americans cannot find insurance, we will provide a choice"
To not use it as a tool against reform
Pres says that public insurance option has to be self sufficient and therefore provide competition for the private sector--onl one part  ...
Additional step is a public option (only Democratic members are standing)
Congressman Gomert is sitting with a sign on his lap that says "what bill" (I think Gomert thinks he is in a townhall meeting)
Addressing "death boards" "it is a lie, plain and simple" and "reform would not apply to illegals" (some republicans jeered with skepticism)
President is addressing key controversies
Individuals will be required to carry insurance-and business will have a requirement-but large business cannot "game" the system
He is talking about competition to get more affordable insurance
Now getting into second part of the plan, which deals with the uninsured
President now getting into what his measure would do to the insurance companies (both sides applauding)
Tight camera shot on Boehner (he is chewing nicotine gum- I guarantee it)
"Blizzard of charges and counter charges" "time to move on health care" that got applause from both sides
Big applause on building on what we have vs starting from scratch
The President is laying out the gut of the issue-single payer and private sector solution
He is talking about the insured that  get insurance dropped in the middle of tratment. Now he is into the cost issue of health care
President is putting a face onto the uninsured-working Americans
Looks like the State of the Union all over again
He was shaking quite a few Republican hands!!!
