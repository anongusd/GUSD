@kmill3r_ I‚Äôm so glad there are people like you becoming educators who are aware enough to worry about stuff like this.
@kmill3r_ Exactly! The way people think sometimes scares me. On a deeper level, hunger in school decreases the child‚Äôs chance of success, further reinforcing the cycle of poverty and food insecurity when they grow up and don‚Äôt have the skills to escape the cycle.
Prohibiting a child from eating is not only ridiculous, it‚Äôs inhumane. Not to mention the fact that it directly violates Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
So let me get this straight...		If their food is taken away, children will be more motivated to read to get it back?		The whole reason kids eat lunch at school is so that that they‚Äôre nourished enough to continue learning. https://t.co/LyntviNYkb
