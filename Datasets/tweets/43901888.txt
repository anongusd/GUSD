The legislature made positive changes. But there are gaps in the system like child-on-child abuse and case management - Kate Freeman https://t.co/oKt2BGsKod

@lgniteowl ‚ÄúOne of the biggest issues we have right now is building foster care capacity and then sustaining it" #txlege
‚ÄúFor the 1st time, we‚Äôll be providing case management through single-source contract providers. We want to be the best in these initiatives"
‚ÄúThere were a lot of wins for child welfare, so we will be monitoring the implementation phase of the bills that did pass.‚Äù PM @TexProtects
‚ÄúIn the interim, something to focus on is how to elevate the voice of practitioners and stakeholders in the field?‚Äù - Wendy @TexProtects

Thanks for tuning in and thank you to all of our guests who attended this event! #forchildren
"Buyers don't complete the purchase 40% of the time. Most of the TR bc of their personal beliefs. But not because they think of HT victims."
"We are creating a buyer landscape by gathering their information thru fake ads. Once we analyze this data we can see who is buying sex"
"It's not about preventing a scandal. It's about living a dignified and respectable lifestyle and eliminating this demand for victims"
"We have to go to the roots of a buyer. A lifecycle of a buyer. We have to reach out to young boys and educate them about respect."
"Don't call them johns, they are predators. And buyer shaming has been effective in reducing demand. But there are other ways to do it."
"Houston PD has a great track record in ending demand. TX buyer arrest rates are 5% of prostitution arrests. Houston's rate is 50%"
"By deputizing men and women helps the average person get involved and help shutdown these illegal massage establishments"
"Project AWESOME is a way for us to shutdown illicit massage establishments because they are unlicensed"
"A lot of orgs and NGOs don't understand that it's the demand driving this crime."
"We're very fortunate to be in Houston where human trafficking has a permanent government employee. It's not just a conference or an event"
"We also want to focus on labor trafficking and domestic child labor trafficking. We're still learning about this."
"People have an idea of human trafficking in their heads that is vastly different than reality. It's not like Taken"
"In Texas, it's hard to talk about sex in the classroom. But we have to to educate these kids about how to avoid exploitation."
"If these victims can get a job or an education,  where are they going to go when they can't eat? Right back to those some traffickers"
"We have to improve victim services. It can take years for these women to rebuild their lives. https://t.co/K8jJNO2aIs
"Victims shouldn't be punished for crimes or situations they were forced in to committing. We need to focus on the victims"
"The Nordic Model helps sex sellers have the ability to move on with their lives. And we're trying to stop these victims getting felonies"
"Sex sellers (women) go to jail, buyers (men) have their charges dropped or very little punishment if  at all. We need equality in the law"
"Buyer penalties are hard to pass in Texas. And there's some rationaliziton of it. But these men must be penalized bc they are predators"
"We need to enforce the law against johns, who often don't realize that they are encouraging sex trafficking" - Dr. Pfeffer @uhdowntown
"The Nordic model completely decriminalizes the selling of sex but has high punishments for traffickers and Johns" https://t.co/X85oNIWwKj
"There is a lack of opportunity for survivors to be advocates and leaders against human trafficking, and that's something we need to fix."
"Hopefully in a few years we can have best practices and techniques for child trafficking. But right now there isn't enough research out."
"If there are an estimated 75,000 child victims but we're only identifying a few hundred victims a year, there's a problem"
"Texas is big and diverse. We have to work on a state level and a regional level to take care of these children."
"Justice isnt just prosecuting johns and traffickers, it's helping the children get better and br in a safe space"
"No one department was responsible for these child victims, so the task Child Sex Trafficking Task Force was established to figure that out"
Todd Latiolais from the Child Sex Trafficking Team from the Office of @GovAbbott and our old colleague! https://t.co/ShA72VvwwW
"Human trafficking is a bipartisan issue. We want to work across the aisle on this issue"
"Texas must stand up, because as long as there is demand, there will be supply." #forchildren
"Penalties must be enhanced and more buyers must be held accountable." #forchildren

"In 2016, Houston had the most human trafficking in the cases. It all comes down to the demand and appetite for commercial sex." E. Freeborn
"It can be a good neighborhood or a bad neighborhood. These massage parlor fronts can be anywhere" Emily Freeborn
"Child trafficking signs are: knowledge of sex at an early age, unexplained money or gifts, tattoos, and frequent address changes."
"We're pushing for harsher punishments for landowners this #txlege session. These owners know what's going on and don't care." J. Caruthers
"What makes it trafficking is the commercial sex act coerced or forced, but it doesn't require physical transportation" Emily Freeborn
"The majority of strippers are under pimp control.  And with pimp control comes the force and coercion that facilitates #humantrafficking"
"How easy is it to order sex in houston? Easier than ordering a pizza." E. Freeborn explains how websites faculitate sex trafficking for $$$ https://t.co/2hMzMp7ZiS

Recess is an important part of childhood, and we have too many administrators saying we can't do recess, and our kids suffer #RecessInSchool
For military kids and others who move a lot, recess gives them the opportunity to not just be "the new kid", but actually make friends
"We're failing our kids by not offering these brain breaks and recess. There's still more to be done" #RecessInSchool

"There are a lot of innovative ideas that schools and policy makers need to learn about" @TEPSAtalk on physical activity &amp; #RecessInSchool
"It seems counterintuitive that letting kids play will enhance their learning, but they don't see the plethora of research that supports it"

In regards to policy "Texas isn't a red state, Texas is Texas". We have to focus on what works for specific areas #EarlyInvestment
The reality is that learning begins at birth #EarlyInvestment
We need to do a better job making sure our kids understand child development so they're equipped when they become parents #EarlyInvestment
The science of education all points to "Start Early" #EarlyInvestment
The solutions to complex problems must derive from those closest to the problems @WK_Kellogg_Fdn #EarlyInvestment
Working Americans need affordable, high quality childcare #EarlyInvestment
Between 0-4, besides loving parents, highly qualified teachers are the most important indicator of child success #EarlyInvestment
If we know what's in the best interest of our kids, we have the obligation to fight for it #EarlyInvestment
How can we offer parents the resources they need in a place where they can actually access it? #EarlyInvestment
Childcare is not babysitting, we can have accountability and quality teachers to get them ready for kindergarten #EarlyInvestment
Wouldn't it be great if we didn't take a punitive stance around parenting, but were more proactive? #EarlyInvestment
Our goal is to show how Texas is doing with investing on early education, both pre-k and 0-3 #EarlyInvestment
The ingredients are there, the timing is perfect, to sustain this effort @HoustonISD #EarlyInvestment

New parents are offered birthing classes, breast feeding classes, why not parenting classes?

Kellie O'Quinn on government spending to support parenting efforts https://t.co/5cdUzmpnVc
Community support and interest in parenting is high. We need to work together to continue to provide more opportunities for our parents
We need to be implanting programs that we know work. There are plenty of resources out there. -Kellie O'Quinn
There are so many benefits to evidence based parenting academically, socially, emotionally
We can't stigmatize that parenting education as something just for those who have messed up, prevention is important for all parents
