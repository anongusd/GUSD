Mehdi Hasan: "To not mention the batshit craziness with which Trump approaches issues of huge importance like a national emergency, to turn a blind eye to the way he behaves in front of all of us, is journalistic dereliction of duty. It’s media malpractice."

If Jess wins today, it will be an indication that there is no ceiling on the number of seats the GOP can lose tonight. And the big bonus is that if she gets into Congress ,she will owe NOTHING to the corrupt Democratic Establishment, everything to her #PA11 constituents. https://t.co/cVK8cSPrq3
In June, 2011 Ted Cruz pledged to some right wing corporate, big-money climate change deniers that he would never work to ameliorate Climate Change. That's one pledge he has kept... scrupulously https://t.co/de7pfxHPb6

yeah, I know. And I don't disagree... but it leaves me queasy. I have a post about it going up tomorrow (no him specifically, but self-funders this cycle in general); believe me, he's one of the only ones talking about good policy. I keep hoping he's like his grandfather https://t.co/8wxqch2Y4H
If he's as good in the House as he's been in the state legislature, he'll be on a leadership track in no time. Congress needs more young, skilled &amp; principled members like Jared to help reform that hellhole https://t.co/EB7qUe4DPI
I hope you're right because I think he's going to win and be in Congress. I had a good talk with him &amp; was impressed but he never followed through on anything we talked about. But what do you think about self-funders who spend $12,756,892 of their own to win? Gives me the creeps https://t.co/blj5Y5ONZn
A dozen races to watch tomorrow for only one reason-- they're the 12 best candidates running and they can help reform a grotesquely corrupt &amp; unaccountable Congress https://t.co/S4VcFvFCu7 https://t.co/IQ8Nkr5gWZ

Turnout in #WA05 is higher than the rest of the state-- approaching 2008 levels-- a great sign for @Lisa4Congress. She's turned this into a neck and neck race with no help from the DCCC whatsoever. https://t.co/dekLDdxhLk
See you that campaign sign behind him? That’s who he is. That’s what he is. Do you want to vote for that? https://t.co/4AEHwN0P7J
Who are the best Democratic candidates running tomorrow? And who are the worst? Not everyone even knows there's a difference between, for example, a champion of working families like @IronStache &amp; a corporate whore like Jeff Van Drew. The 2 lists: https://t.co/Wr1nfCn8oV https://t.co/AMumqp29pF
Candidates asking you to send them money tonite, are being dishonest unless they're telling you they're asking for help to pay off their campaign debt or-- more likely-- to pay themselves back for the money they loaned their campaigns. They should disclose that
Bryan Steil’s entire career has been about screwing working families. It’s who he is. Now he’s lying about it https://t.co/hkGtiKpaQs
