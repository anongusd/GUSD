The President is considering raiding disaster recovery funds from my district and other parts of CA and Puerto Rico to pay for his border wall. That would put 250,000 constituents at risk in the region I represent. Stop this nonsense, Mr. President.
The President is using the American people as a bargaining chip to get his border wall and deliver on a campaign promise. It's shameful and we will not cave in to his abhorrent practices and ridiculous demands.

3/5 We want to ensure that things like our national parks and transportation services are re-opened and no longer held back by the President‚Äôs government shutdown.
2/5 It‚Äôs entirely inappropriate to close the federal agencies that have no bearing on the border wall debate that caused the Trump Shutdown in the first place.

Thank you to @RepMcNerney, @RepPaulTonko, @RepDonaldPayne, and @RepSchneider for joining this important discussion tonight. I appreciate your leadership and insight on this issue.
My grandson was born last night. I think about him and his entire generation when I consider the actions we must take in Congress to address #ClimateChange. His generation will either thank us for taking decisive action on this issue, or curse us for inaction.
This should be the goal of every policy we enact in Congress--and it's what we will be doing if we #ActOnClimate. https://t.co/Pi7KGpe3ZR
With the existing climate change scenario, by 2030, water scarcity in some arid and semi-arid places will displace between 24 million and 700 million people--creating hundreds of millions of #ClimateRefugees. Source: UN https://t.co/J4UW7LTo35
The 2015 California drought demonstrated that households in affected counties (Tulare and Mariposa) experienced drought-linked health impacts like asthma, allergies and other breathing issues, along with high stress levels. https://t.co/Y2UbbhIxwt
Sea levels have already risen 7-8 inches since 1900. We can expect sea level rise of as much as 8 feet by 2100. https://t.co/BF2DOkWwkH
To my colleagues in Congress and the President: We have an existential crisis posed by #ClimateChange on our hands, and we have an obligation to address it immediately. Let's not wait for another disaster or climate refugee to be created to give this issue the attention it needs.
The 2015 drought in California cut over 10,000 agricultural jobs, and cost the state over $900 million in gross crop revenue. The Southwest has warmed by 1.6F since 1901, with more warm nights and fewer cold ones.
Climate Change has doubled the area burned by wildfires across the West since 1985. https://t.co/c7A5wbCvvN
It shows that climate change has played a role in increasing the number of natural disasters, and the severity of the disasters in our country. Over 80 people just North of my district have died in the Camp Fire. Climate change helped contribute to this tragedy.
The U.S. government issued a national climate assessment report the day after Thanksgiving. The Trump administration tried to hide it by burying it in the middle of a holiday weekend, but it is one of the most important studies this administration has conducted to date.

1/ I just joined over 120 of my colleagues in the House in supporting the Keep Families Together Act of 2018. This bill, which is the House companion of Senator Feinstein's bill in the Senate, will put an end to the abhorrent practice of separating children from their parents.
The Trump Administration's inhumane policy of separating children from their parents shocks the conscience. I will be leading a group of Democratic members to speak out against this atrocity on the House floor at approximately 7:15 pm Eastern, 4:15 Pacific, this evening.
@Indivisible_Col STAFF RESPONSE: Mr. Garamendi will be speaking out about this inhumane practice at length on the House Floor tomorrow evening.

These are just a few ways in which we can deliver #ABetterDeal for the middle class and create a tax code that truly delivers for working Americans. 		What do you think? Pass along your ideas and opinions in the comments section below.
Reduce the ridiculous loophole for pass-through businesses in the new #TaxScam that heavily benefits the wealthy and redirect the tax savings to the middle class.
Make it easier for companies of all sizes to support job training programs.
Expand deductions that help Americans keep their health care costs under control.
Shore up loopholes in the new tax law that give some corporations greater incentive to outsource American jobs. Let's put the middle class back to work by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure with American materials and workers.
Ensure that the highest wage earners pay their fair share, so the middle class doesn't have to subsidize their tax break anymore.
Create a tax code that makes it easier for middle class Americans to start a business or work for themselves from home. That goes hand in hand with expanding rural broadband access.
Focus on small business tax relief that allows local businesses to hire more workers and provide better benefits.
Prevent corporations from using a disproportionate amount of their tax savings on on stock buybacks and executive salaries. Force them to invest in wage and job growth for the middle class. They've proven that they won't do so unless they have to.
It's obvious to me that the new tax law is a raw deal for the American people. The American middle class deserves #ABetterDeal--one that prioritizes real wage and job growth for low and middle income earners. Specifically, Congress should do the following...
Of course it is, that was the plan all along. https://t.co/ebG5JIVio9
Fewer than 45 of 500 corporations have shared their tax benefits with workers through bonuses, which ‚Äì again ‚Äì is not the same as raising wages. https://t.co/FnZPqAuwIN

"Well-Heeled Investors Reap the Republican Tax Cut Bonanza" https://t.co/ljMt6pGpT9
"The boost to paychecks has frequently been small, and sometimes unnoticeable." Unless, of course, you're in the top 1% or run a major corporation. Because that's where 83% of the tax benefits in this law go. https://t.co/7Xl1m2lMou

Again - people don't want Congress to pass tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and then offset the costs by cutting Medicare and Social Security. But that's exactly what Paul Ryan and others are angling to do. I won't stand for it. https://t.co/yaaUYbCmNI

Solutions like universal background checks, prohibiting the sale of assault-style rifles, and no fly no buy can help reduce gun violence in America without undermining the Second Amendment.
Our hearts are heavy today for all of the victims and survivors of Columbine, and the best way we can honor them as lawmakers is to come together and pass commonsense gun safety reforms that an overwhelming number of Americans support.

2/ Yes, think about the horrible death these children endured. 14 students and three faculty of Stoneman Douglas High School will never know their hopes and dreams. They were murdered in three agonizing minutes with an assault weapon.
1/ I dropped two grandchildren off at preschool today--3 and 5 years old. I thought of the Sandy Hook families as 26 of their sweetest youngest children were murdered with an assault weapon--ripping their tiny bodies apart.

Thank you to @RepJeffries for joining me on the House Floor tonight to discuss the #GOPTaxScam's giveaway to the 1%, and what Democrats are proposing as an alternative to create increased wages, job security, and an overall better deal for the middle class.
The #GOPTaxScam eliminates a tax policy that helps communities recovery after oil spills. It's a clear and disgusting giveaway to the oil lobby.
I want to invest in rebuilding America's infrastructure. The #GOPTaxScam made that harder by increasing the deficit by $1.5 tril. That's $1.5 tril. less for an infrastructure plan. Let's instead invest in American infrastructure and jobs rather than corporate welfare.
@RepJeffries @RepJeffries "There's no evidence that trickle-down economics does ANYTHING for the everyday American." We've seen explosive debt and recession rather than explosive economic growth every time we've tried it. #GOPTaxScam
@RepJeffries joins me on the House Floor now: "We know that at least 36 bil. middle class families will experience a tax increase" under the new tax law. We're shifting $1.5 tril. in debt on to the next generation.
Cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to pay for massive tax cuts for the 1% is a disgusting proposal. Yet it's what the GOP Congress is currently trying to do. This is a fight about the very future of our nation.
Passing the tax law was the first step in the GOP's "Texas Two Step." In an attempt to offset the $1.5 tril. in deficit increases from this tax law, Speaker Ryan says he plans to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
This new tax law makes me wonder where the deficit hawks went. It eliminates nearly $200 bil in federal revenue each year, and blows a hole in the deficit, to give 83% of its tax savings to the 1%. That's money taken from infrastructure to pay corporate executives even more money
There's not one legitimate economic analysis that says tricke-down works. Yet that's the economic basis for this tax law.
83% of the $1.5 trillion in tax savings in the new tax law goes to the top 1%--who already control 90% of the nation's wealth. Why would we hold the middle class and poor ransom so we can add abundance to the richest Americans? This is a historic betrayal to the middle class.
Turning to taxes now: the new tax law adds to the abundance of those that have much by taking from those that have too little. That is backwards and dangerous public policy.
If they don't like the laws then they can change them. Until then, the Special Counsel investigation must be allowed to continue unabated to uphold the rule of law in our country.
The partisan heat that has been put on the FBI and the Special Counsel to try and discredit their efforts seems to be out of fear that there's something to fear.
@cspan We are a country of law and justice. Partisan efforts to discredit and undermine the Mueller investigation are contrary to these hallowed principles on which our nation was founded.
@cspan STAFF: Rep. Garamendi is on the House Floor now. We will live tweet his remarks.
I'm going to be on the House Floor at roughly 5:45 pm ET/2:45 pm PT to discuss the new tax law and infrastructure. You can watch it live on @cspan.

American corporations are sitting on $2.5 TRIILLION in cash. Apple alone is sitting on a quarter trillion. That money is just parked. Not going to employing more people.
Corporations have seen the share they contribute to federal revenues drop dramatically as it is. And yet, Republicans want to cut their taxes even more. Meanwhile, the burden continues to shift to the middle class.
Congressional Republicans are doing their best to prime the pump for Trump to fire Mueller. I won't stand for that.
The #FCC is preparing to eliminate #NetNeutrality protections in America this Thursday. Allowing an unelected board to make policy decisions that affect every American is shameful. It's time for Congress to do its job and pass legislation to make net neutrality law of the land.

The #GOPTaxScam eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax, which cost Trump $31 million in 2005. So, of course it's being eliminated.
128,000 of my constituents deduct state and local taxes to the tune of $10,000/year on average. The #GOPTaxScam would eliminate the state and local tax deduction and raise taxes on thousands of Third District residents.
18,000 of my constituents rely on the medical expense deduction to help care for a loved one in a nursing home or a cover their own medical bills without going into debt. The #GOPTaxScam would eliminate this deduction in order to give corporations and the 1% a tax cut.
The #GOPTaxScam eliminates the deductions middle class families rely on in order to give massive tax breaks to corporations and super wealthy. https://t.co/Tt4aZHwklT

Let's get back to our roots and pass a tax reform plan that benefits every American, not just the select few at the top.
Instead of doing all of this, the current tax reform proposal abandons American workers and blows a hole in the deficit. https://t.co/udpHbhXR69
Let's create a business env that encourages private investment in hiring American workers and investing in career and technical education.
We could simplify the tax code by eliminating deductions that only benefit a select few and make the process easier for the middle class.
If we are going to bring down the corporate tax rate then we need to ensure we also include clear incentives to Hire American &amp; Buy American
No, repealing the estate tax won't put money in the pockets of middle class Americans. It will provide more to those who want for nothing. https://t.co/42zJgXFbdM
Who is one of the major beneficiaries from President Trump's tax proposal?: President Trump
I don't understand how any of my CA colleagues could support a tax plan that will substantially increase their constituents' taxes.
@cspan @RepDonaldPayne California is in the same boat as New Jersey. We pay more to the federal government than we get back in services, and we would be punished.
@cspan @RepDonaldPayne Rep. Donald Payne says that 2 million people in his home state of New Jersey deduct their state taxes. Trump's tax plan would forbid that.
@cspan joining me tonight is @RepDonaldPayne, who, like me, objects to the way the Trump tax plan will hurt workers in urban areas.
@cspan a tax cut for the wealthy will be a burden on American workers. and if it happens, it will be the largest transfer of wealth in America.
@cspan AT&amp;T laid off 80,000 workers even as they paid an 8 percent effective corporate tax rate. cutting corporate taxes doesn't guarantee jobs.
I'm live on @cspan now discussing how we can pass a tax reform plan that truly benefits the American middle class, instead of Trump's plan.

@RepEspaillat w/me on the Floor: "Instead of looking at crisis in #PuertoRico &amp; #VirginIslands, our President chose to look the other way."
Now that #GrahamCassidy is dead we must continue bipartisan negotiations on health care reform, which Graham-Cassidy cut short.
Instead we've had 2 wks of attention on #GrahamCassidy, which would have ended Medicaid as we know it and kick millions off their insurance.
I'm on House floor right now to demand a humanitarian aid package be passed for #PuertoRico today, and that the aid be delivered immediately
Where is our bill to help #PuertoRico and #VirginIslands? All we had was the devastating #GrahamCassidy health care "plan."

The health care debate isn't over. Democrats are committed to an ever more perfect union. More ideas here: https://t.co/NC2OBy8wcq
#ACA isn't just talking point on TV. It can be improved but millions of Americans helped. Let's build on what's working, improve what's not
Trump says let the #ACA die. He's squandering his opportunity to actually improve America's #healthcare system. Democrats have lots of ideas
Imagine how different this conversation would be if the health care bills in Congress had room for real debate &amp; amendments?
Want to reduce health care costs? Reduce onset of expensive diseases, stroke &amp; diabetes. Let states experiment w/ early diagnosis incentives
When #ACA passed House in 2009, there was a public option included in it. Let's bring #publicoption back for nationwide affordable option
If you want to improve health care, you want to expand the risk pool to include more healthy people. The GOP plans do the opposite.
Want to improve #ACA? Under existing law #Medicare can't negotiate price of drugs. That would lower costs for seniors &amp; improve solvency!
Does the American public want to eviscerate #Medicaid? 60% of its resources supports seniors in nursing homes.

@cspan The President's actions have already created uncertainty in the health insurance marketplace. It is irresponsible to want the #ACA to fail.
Today, #POTUS said he would let #ACA die, meaning he will take action to deny insurance to over 20 mil. Americans.
@cspan Under #Obamacare, we ended discrimination based on pre-existing conditions. Today Trump said he would let it die.
ACA made it illegal to deny health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions.We cannot go back to the dark days before this protection

Want to improve care &amp; save money in #ACA? Let's revisit public option. Let's publicize exchange in states that haven't designed their own
Want to improve care &amp; save money? Why not allow #Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices &amp; allow cheaper drugs in from Canada?
Would love to work together with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to actually improve health care in America. We have lots of ideas
The Administration has taken multiple steps that destabilize the insurance market, presumably to make the argument that #ACA is collapsing.
Under Senate GOP health bill 18m Americans would lose health care next year to give multi million dollar reduction in taxes to super wealthy
#Trumpcare would be the largest transfer of wealth from poor &amp; middle class Americans to the richest Americans ever signed into law.
... or whether the individual mandate will be enforced have led to some insurers to leave the market." --@KaiserFamFound
"Mixed signals from the Administration and Congress as to whether cost sharing subsidy payments will continue ...
Important @KaiserFamFound report on individual market stabilization. https://t.co/3ZdMTiMsEN
From 2010-2015, 87000 lives were saved due to reduction in medical errors &amp; hospital infections. #ACA incentivized this progress
Under the #ACA, annual &amp; lifetime limits on coverage are in the dustbin of history, unless a GOP health bill brings them back.
The #ACA is closing the prescription drug donut hole, the gap in coverage that left many seniors w/ prescriptions they couldn't afford
27% of Americans have preexisting. It was common for insurance companies to deny them coverage b/f the #ACA, especially on individual market
6.1 million young Americans have been able to stay on their parents' plans through age 25 thanks to the #AffordableCareAct.
A metric we should judge all legislation by... https://t.co/w5dD2dHD5n

@PeaceCorps If not for them, then for us. #JFK understood that our greatness, our potential, our brightest future doesn't arise in isolation.
@PeaceCorps We're a resourceful &amp; powerful country that is capable of doing tremendous good. Global stability, peace, famine relief, we must be engaged
@PeaceCorps What I can say is this: I've seen policies that work &amp; policies that fail. I've seen crises averted w/ action &amp; crises made actively worse.
@PeaceCorps I'd like to say they never lost hope. That can't possibly be true in every case. Hope is constantly tested when you're pushed to your limits
@PeaceCorps Off &amp; on we'd visit Ethiopia. Lifelong friends there became parents &amp; grandparents. They survived war, famine, destructive public policy
@PeaceCorps Patti &amp; I could help with the basics. We improved their access to clean water &amp; helped build a school. Life on a ranch prepped me for that.
@PeaceCorps Through @PeaceCorps we met caring, perceptive, hardworking Ethiopians born into rough conditions, looking for a better life for their family
As we wind down #JFK100, the centennial of his birth, I remain forever grateful for the @PeaceCorps &amp; what it meant to my family https://t.co/d0qYumjjcz
I joined 21 in Congress asking California, Oregon &amp; Washington to maintain our #climatechange leadership in light of #ParisAgreementPullOut https://t.co/ox1eXDqcmj
How does #climatechange impact #California? Expect more smog &amp; dust, meaning more lung issues like asthma. A big concern in Central Valley.
How does #climatechange impact #California? Rising sea levels will expose more homes, businesses &amp; travel destinations to flood risk.
How does #climatechange impact #California? One-third of fresh water we use comes from Sierra Snowpack. As planet warms, snowpack depletes.
Every state, county &amp; city in America now has a chance to shine. We know what's necessary. Our future depends on real #climatechange action.
Solar panels &amp; wind turbines were invented in America. We were leaders! We will be again. #ParisAgreement is a framework we will fight for
I authored 1st state alternative energy tax credit in U.S. history. We've known for a long time that #cleanenergy is a vital job creator
The silver lining today: numerous leaders in America embrace #ParisAgreement. We won't back down. We understand #ClimateAction is essential
@ENERGY 4/ The Trump Admin can‚Äôt hide the facts: abandoning the #ParisAgreement is bad for American workers. https://t.co/qGFWlEUvHR
RT @elonmusk: Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today https://‚Ä¶

Make no mistake: #California &amp; the other states that lead the way on #climatechange will be rewarded in the economy of today &amp; tomorrow
My statement on Trump's announcement that America will abandon the #ParisClimateAgreement. This is a sad day. #ClimateChange https://t.co/oN9KISDYtp
3/ @ENERGY Department reports 3 million Americans worked in #cleanenergy jobs last year. Exiting the #ParisAgreement puts them at risk.
2/ This will mark a low point in American leadership and set our world on a frightening course. I hope all #Congress will #ActOnClimate w/me
1/ I strongly oppose @POTUS' decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreement .This removes vital protections for our health and environment.
June is #ImmigrantHeritageMonth -- a time when we honor the remarkable contributions immigrants make to our county every day.
RT @KidneyFund: .@RepGaramendi thank you for signing on in support of charitable premium assistance for people w/ chronic illnesses! https:‚Ä¶
6.7 million also had pre-existing conditions, which would hike up premiums even more for these people under #Trumpcare. This is backwards.
Roughly 27 million people had a gap in their health coverage in 2015. #Trumpcare would allow insurers to charge those people 30% more.
Why is #ParisAgreement important? @NASA Global #ClimateChange Page a good resource on the science, at least for now. https://t.co/spTXynJ2pg
7/ President Trump still has time to pull back from the precipice. I pray he does. We can't ignore the threat of #climatechange.
6/ If America is pulled out of the #ParisAccord, it will set our world on a frightening and devastating course.
5/ If President Trump rejects a climate accord embraced by 194 other nations, it will mark a low point in modern American leadership.
4/ But coordinated global action right now can still create much better outcomes for our children alive today &amp; the children yet to be born.
3/ ...worse air quality, and the ruin of vast agricultural lands are already in our future.
2/ We've already reached the point of irrevocability. Rising sea levels, increased fresh water scarcity...
1/ Reports indicate Trump will pull out of Paris Climate Accord. I'm reminded of immortal words of #JFK, "If not us, who? If not now, when?"
Why does #TrumpBudget cut support for disabled elderly #veterans? I can't recall anyone ever advocating for this. https://t.co/YPNDIsiwMV

4/ In strongest possible terms I urge Trump Administration to show America will keep its word &amp; reaffirm our commitment to #ParisAgreement
3/ No American leadership will doom #ParisAccord accelerate ecological &amp; humanitarian crisis &amp; create less prosperous &amp; more dangerous world
2/ We know that #climatechange is a real and imminent threat that requires close coordination among the world's great powers. #G7Summit
1/ Disheartening that under this Administration, US only #G7 nation not affirming commitment to 195-nation #ParisAgreement on #climatechange

10/ There is much more going on. We've never seen anything like this. It is a paramount national security concern.
9/ We cannot count solely on FBI &amp; Special Counsel Mueller investigation as it will be limited to issues of criminality.
8/ If majority in House sign it, this discharge petition would require vote to establish that independent commission https://t.co/cvhQlWGu9t
7/ Congress must immediately create bipartisan independent commission to get to bottom of Russia's involvement
6/ Kushner's security clearance needs to be immediately revoked.
5/ Why did Kushner neglect to disclose this meeting w/ Russian ambassador when applying for his national security clearance?
4/ Why precisely was the Russian government so interested in seeing Donald Trump elected President?
3/ We must know why and for what this request was made. This puts renewed focus on Trump's and Kushner's business ties in Russia.
2/ Kushner asked Russian Ambassador to use back channels of communications owned by Russian intelligence to evade American intelligence?
1/ This is one more alarming report about Trump and his team's inexplicable relationship with Putin's Kremlin. https://t.co/styplrIhO8

5/ Muslim Americans form integral part of the American fabric. We cannot sacrifice our values for misguided policy that won't make us safer.
4/ The #TravelBan is discriminatory &amp; must be rejected. Let‚Äôs remember: all of these immigrants are vetted before entering the United States
3/ Trump called for #MuslimBan during campaign. People close to him admitted that #TravelBan backdoor attempt to implement it by other means
2/ America is a stronger nation when it welcomes immigrants and embraces religious freedom. #TravelBan
1/ 4th Circuit made right decision upholding lower court ruling on President Trump‚Äôs #TravelBan from six predominantly Muslim countries.

This #Budget2018 directly impacts your life. Finding cures. Going to college. Keeping kdis &amp; seniors insured. All on the chopping block.
Today headline stories in Washington, DC papers were all about the President's scandals. The President's budget is a scandal too.
The top 40 families in America receive $7 mil tax reduction in #TrumpBudget. Raids $ from #NIH and the #MiddleClass in order to do this.
#TrumpBudget includes $7 billion reduction in #research at #NIH. That research finds cures &amp; treatments to diseases that plague us
#trumpbudget reduces National Institute of Health research by nearly $7 bil. This means less research for cancer, Alzheimer's, HIV &amp; more.
#Trump promised no cuts to #Medicaid. Budget + #AHCA = $1.4 TRILLION cut to Medicaid. Make Poor Americans Uninsured Again wasn't the promise
Watch carefully America. The #TrumpBudget is not an America we want to see &amp; it's not even what #Trump promised in 2016.
If you're at all concerned with income inequality, #TrumpBudget combined with #TrumpCare will create vast transfer of wealth to wealthiest
The #AHCA #Trumpcare was already the largest transfer of wealth in history from the poor &amp; middle class to richest. #Budget2018 doubles down
Trump supports major cut to #SCHIP, the children's health insurance program that makes sure kids don't go through childhood uninsured.
$300 billion cut to student financial aid in #Budget2018. How does pricing students out of an education Make America Great Again?
For aged, blind &amp; disabled, $64b cut to #SSI in #Trump budget. That's real harm to people you know.
Trump budget cuts #Medicaid $610b over ten years ON TOP OF $800b cut in #TrumpCare. Almost $1.5 trillion reduction. That is immoral.
#Medicaid exists to ensure lower income Americans, especially children &amp; seniors, have healthcare. Trump vision for Medicaid is terrifying.
@cspan It would be gross mistake not to analyze what it is President's budget. It's what the President wants. Does it live up to his promises?

3/ 240,000 of my constituents rely on Medi-Cal (CA's Medicaid program).I urge Trump to keep his word and help us protect and expand Medicaid
2/ Now, he's about to unveil his next budget proposal, which--you guessed it--is expected to include further cuts to #Medicaid.
1/ In January, President Trump vowed to protect Medicaid from funding cuts. Then he unveiled #Trumpcare, which cuts Medicaid by $880 billion

Ongoing investigations can continue, but independent investigation vital to preserve public's dwindling faith in our justice system.
Allegations in #ComeyMemo very serious &amp; revealed just days after Trump admitted Russia investigation a reason for #ComeyFiring
We need an independent investigation into Russia interference in election &amp; any subsequent obstructions of justice by the Administration.
Seemingly every day, a new revelation emerges. We need an independent investigation &amp; special prosecutor	https://t.co/avwwwLyAK3
Our nat'l security depends on allies trusting us w/ intelligence. When trust eroded, it endangers Americans at home &amp; those serving abroad
If sensitive intelligence is compromised by commander-in-chief, sources will be less willing to divulge information that could keep us safe.
When intelligence is considered so sensitive that it can't be shared with our closest allies, it certainly shouldn't be shared with Russia.
If allegations in @washingtonpost are true, I'm astonished that even Donald Trump could be this careless.

4/ Either through special prosecutor above reproach or independent commission, we need to get to bottom of Russia's involvement in election
3/ Without independence, how can ongoing investigation be handled without political influence? The timing of #ComeyFiring is troubling.
2/ By taking this action in middle of FBI investigation into Russian interference in 2016 election, President cast dark cloud over DOJ.

Shortly after 9 am pt / noon et this morning, I'll be on @msnbc for a conversation on #Trumpcare.
At 9 am pt / noon et, @RepGaramendi will appear on @MSNBC to discuss the #AHCA -STAFF
.@USCBO 37/ Health care is a life and death struggle. It isn't a game. Yes, we can improve health care, but the #AHCA doesn‚Äôt do that.
.@USCBO 36/ This process was terrible &amp; the final product, the #AHCA, is a travesty. It deserves to die in the U.S. Senate. I hope it does.
35/ By comparison, House Republicans rushed a vote on the #AHCA within weeks without even seeing an updated nonpartisan @USCBO analysis.
34/ As President Trump acknowledged at the White House after the #AHCA vote, we passed the #ACA after ~17 months of public debate.
33/ Indeed, the Affordable Care Act incorporates ideas first proposed by Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney &amp; Heritage Foundation.
32/ When we passed the #ACA / #Obamacare in 2009, we never said it was the final chapter. Democrats are open to good ideas.
31/ Giving the richest Americans a $600 billion tax cut at the expense of health care for everyone else doesn‚Äôt improve health coverage.
30/ Making #Medicare less solvent by taking $75 billion out of the trust fund doesn't improve health coverage.
29/ Allowing insurers to opt-out of coverage for things like emergency services &amp; prescription drugs doesn't improve health coverage.
28/ Cutting support for the lifesaving #Medicaid program by 25% doesn't improve health coverage.
27/ Allowing insurers to practice rampant age and gender discrimination doesn't improve health coverage.
26/ Making it a lot harder for people with pre-existing conditions to attain coverage doesn't improve health coverage.
25/ Kicking 24 million people off their insurance doesn't improve health coverage.
24/ The #AHCA, #Trumpcare, #Ryancare, whatever you want to call it, would make health coverage in America less reliable &amp; attainable.
23/ And yes, we could pass a #MedicareforAll system that lowers administrative costs while preserving diverse service provider options.
22/ We could eliminate the ‚Äúfamily glitch‚Äù that disqualifies some families with workplace coverage from insurance subsidies.
21/ We could expand the pool of middle-income Americans eligible for insurance subsidies.
20/ We could cap insurance payments at a proportion of household or family income.
19/ We could invest in a nationwide e-records overhaul to make sure that all systems can transfer patient records seamlessly.
18/ We could make it easier for independent contractors &amp; the self-employed to pool themselves into a single group plan.
17/ We could make it easier for small businesses to join other small businesses to pool their employees into a single group plan.
16/ We could raise the age of eligibility for children to remain on their parents' health insurance plans.
15/ That means don't cut federal support for Meals-on-Wheels &amp; stop shaming students who need free or reduced school breakfast &amp; lunch.
14/ We could ensure that lower income families &amp; seniors have easier access to nutritious &amp; healthy foods.
13/ We could reduce costs by expanding opportunities for telemedicine, particularly for people with less mobility.
12/ We could expand eligibility for the #SCHIP program to ensure that no child is left uninsured.
11/ We could find incentives for states to embrace the #ACA's #Medicaid expansion where the governor and/or legislature rejected it.
10/ We could increase funding for In Home Supportive Services, which allow more independent living at fraction of cost of nursing home care.
9/ We could create a national public option that ensures there's a strong insurance competitor in every market, one not driven by profit.
8/ We could increase support for community clinics, particularly in regions underserved by existing insurance companies.
7/ We could allow #Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices. This would lower prescription drug costs &amp; extend #Medicare solvency.
6/ Here are some significant steps we could take to improve health care delivery, access &amp; affordability in America‚Ä¶
5/ I authored a 73-page report, "Priced Out", that detailed 43 concrete recommendations to improve health care coverage.
4/ I authored a universal health care bill that passed the CA state legislature but was vetoed by Governor Pete Wilson. We were close.
3/ I‚Äôve been working on improving health care for a long time. I served 8 years as California's Insurance Commissioner.
2/ But many people have asked... What would actually make the #ACA better? I‚Äôm glad you asked.
1/ #Trumpcare would make healthcare in America a lot worse, with approximately 24 million Americans losing coverage.

No one is talking about the economic drag #AHCA will create. In CA alone, 207,000 jobs could be lost by 2022. 1.8 mil jobs lost nationally.
B/c Speaker Ryan required Dems to pass short term 2017 funding extension, we at least avoided a lot of pain in areas other than #healthcare https://t.co/IJgqQzW3gO
President Trump promised ‚Äúinsurance for everybody" w/ #ACA repeal. Nobody is pretending #Trumpcare does that. 24m people will LOSE coverage
.@USCBO I served 8 years as CA Insurance Commissioner. I know what insurance companies do when given free rein, and that‚Äôs what #AHCA does.
The Republican majority rushed #AHCA to a vote without even giving the nonpartisan @USCBO a chance to tell us just how bad it is.
#Ryancare is an outright assault on the poor and the sick, and a huge transfer of wealth to the rich.
#Trumpcare will provide a massive, $600 billion tax cut to America‚Äôs richest. That is taken out of coverage for everyone else.
#AHCA will practically eliminate the guarantee of coverage for pre-existing conditions, which could affect over 300k people in my district.
#AHCA will destabilize funding for #Medicare, taking $75 billion out of the trust fund, and blow a $10 billion annual hole in #MediCal.
#Trumpcare will strip 24m people of their health insurance. It is also a crushing age tax on Americans 50-64 years of age.
The #AHCA is atrocious. It is cruel. I simply cannot believe that something this bad could pass the House of Representatives, but it has.
My statement on the atrocious bill that just passed the House to repeal the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/DBlWSW1795
It's a sad day in America. I hope a majority in Senate has more wisdom &amp; compassion than to take insurance away from ~24m Americans. #AHCA
Under #Trumpcare, the 400 richest households in America would receive a tax cut of $7 million a year while the middle class suffers. #VoteNo
#Trumpcare also steals $175 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund, shortening the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by three years.
#Trumpcare would result in 24 million Americans losing their health care coverage over the next 10 years. 14 mil will lose it just next year
That means under #AHCA 7 mil. vets could lose the tax credits that help them pay for affordable health care. I'm voting no on #AHCA.
#AHCA Fact:It would prohibit veterans who are eligible to receive VA care from receiving any tax credits to help pay for care outside the VA

Congratulations to @CityofDavis for turning 100 today!
I reject the choice of this President to eliminate needed #NIH research to make room in budget for #borderwall. There's a better way.
We should cut $5+b from #NIH budget, sacrificing life saving cures, to pay for 1/4 of the #borderwall? I challenge that value statement
Congress has a choice: do we increase funding for #NIH &amp; #Alzheimers research or do we build $20+b #borderwall?
Alzheimers not hopeless disease. We just haven't spent anything close to research funding it deserves. $1b research v. $153b care right now!
#Alzheimers is going to impact more lives and skyrocket Medicaid/Medicare costs in the future. We must #FundAlz to end this nightmare. https://t.co/dvJmgpKln9
Big drain on #Medicaid budget is institutional care like nursing homes. Over time Alzheimer's patients will overwhelm system w/o cure
As @RepRaskin noted during my Special Order Hour, 1 in 5 Medicaid dollars is spent on Alzheimer's. We must fund Alzheimer's research. https://t.co/AZ3hSIwymA
"The NIH is at the forefront of protecting our population from serious disease"- @RepRaskin, who represents the NIH headquarters in Congress
.@RepRaskin says diseases like colon cancer "can happen to anybody." We should be united in support of disease research. We share risk.
.@RepBonnie also identified important #NIH research for cancer, diabetes &amp; brain trauma. All at risk w/ President's major budget cut
.@RepBonnie identifies success from #NIH funding: stem cell therapy showing results for adults w/ sickle cell anemia
Guess which of these diseases received the least amount of research funding? Alzheimer's is too serious to ignore. #FundtheNIH https://t.co/aEaywmJOKd
.@RepScottPeters notes bipartisan Congress coalition increased Alzheimers research by 1/3, to almost $1b. That is undermined by Prez budget
"Research funded through NIH is our best chance at a cure for Alzheimer's"-@RepScottPeters joins my Special Order Hour on the House Floor.
.@RepScottPeters says Alzheimers kills more people than breast &amp; prostate cancer combined. For every patient there are 3 unpaid caregivers
.@MaxineWaters, cochair of Task Force on Alzheimers Disease, worried #NIH cuts will directly harm progress we've made on Alzheimers research
Rep @MaxineWaters reminds us that #Alzheimers is the 6th leading cause of death in America. 67% of Alzheimers costs in #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid
After relaying his personal history with polio, @RepCohen said "The #1 enemy we all have is catastrophic disease." Research should unite us
"My enemy is disease. The NIH is my Defense Department" - @RepCohen joining me for my Special Order Hour on protecting crucial NIH funding.
.@FASEBopa recommends a $35b #NIH budget. President proposed $25.9b. This gap means delayed &amp; cancelled life saving research
Major progress in diseases like HIV &amp; cancer a direct result of #NIH research. It is one of our most important federal investments.
@POTUS' proposed budget cuts $5.8 bil from the National Institute of Health, which funds crucial medical research that saves lives.

"When you tinker with people's health insurance you are playing with fire." @RepMarcyKaptur
#Trumpcare is #MaliceNotMercy. I won't support a bill that throws million of hard-working Americans off their health insurance.
"#Trumpcare will cost us 1.8 mil. jobs. The bill is a job killer" - @davidcicilline
Under #Trumpcare, the 400 richest families in America, including the Trumps, will see an average tax break of $7 million.
The gutting of #Medicaid in #Trumpcare means less support for the elderly in nursing homes
If you're 64 and making $26,500 you pay $1,700 in premiums under #ACA. Under #TrumpCare you'll pay $14,600--more than half your income.
Under #Ryancare, most Americans can expect to pay more for less, particularly people 40 years and older.
Americans will #PayMoreForLess under #TrumpCare. 24 mil lose insurance over 9 yrs. and Medicaid loses $800 billion.
"When you get wellness care (included in #ACA) you lower costs because you get healthier people" - @JacksonLeeTX18.
The 24 million Americans losing insurance will delay preventative treatment &amp; force patients into much more expensive emergency rooms
if you're between 40-64, you're premiums will rise significantly under #TrumpCare. #Trumpcare imposes an #AgeTax and guts Medicaid funding.
Part of 14m Americans who would lose their health care next year under #Trumpcare are adults age 50-64 who will see massive premium increase
Thanks to #ACA, Medicare solvency was extended by 11 years because of efficiency in delivering Medicare services &amp; early diagnosis
In order to deal w/cost of premiums you must deal with cost of services. #ACA did this by lowering inflation rate for premiums.
In #ACA, there are powerful mechanisms to reduce expenses, including electronic medical records &amp; penalty for hospital-acquired infections,

#Trumpcare can lead to increased shuttering of community health clinics. That hurts rural America.
Shrinking #Medicaid program will be devastating to clinics in rural areas. Many clinics in underserved communities will shut their doors.
If GOP rushes "replacement" bill out of committee this week, it will be before we get analysis from nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office
#ACA supports community health centers. The #ACARepeal puts that in jeopardy and can lead to less people having insurance - @BobbyScott
There is a justifiable fear for what is coming to Americans. Undoubtedly, #Trumpcare will increase number of uninsured Americans.
When you tinker with someone's ability to access healthcare you create fear and uncertainty #ACARepeal.
With #ACA in place, one of the fastest job growth areas is in health care. It made it easier to become nurse or primary care doctor.
Thanks to regulations in #ACA, we've seen reduction in hospital acquired infections. That saves lives &amp; reduces costs in the system.
#ACA meant to pool a large population of people previously uninsured. It's an insurance mechanism to reduce cost curve systemwide
Uncompensated care a huge burden. Uninsured pass costs on to hospitals, insurers &amp; ultimately the insured when they need emergency room care
Early analyses show the #ACARepeal kicking 11 million or more off their health insurance.
What we're seeing in #ACARepeal is the shifting of cost on to the elderly.
Insurance depends on a large pool of people, including healthy people. The sicker your market, the more expensive your coverage.
Thanks to #ACA, seniors on #Medicare also get a free annual screening to help diagnose serious ailments early. Means healthier &amp; cost saings
.@BobbyScott calls for a @USCBO review of #ACARepeal before a vote. I agree, we must know the impact of legislation before supporting it.
Under #ACA, many benefits for #Medicare. For example, closing of prescription drug donut hole, a coverage gap scheduled to close by 2020.
.Rep @BobbyScott notes that you can go to emergency room w/ a stroke but you can't get the blood pressure pills to prevent it w/o insurance
@FamiliesUSA called the GOP's #ACARepeal "laughable."
.Rep @BobbyScott says of #ACA replacement, "You have a plan with fewer people insured and watered down benefits. That's not an improvement."
When you repeal #ACA taxes, there's less funding for Medicaid and Medicare. You set it up for failure - @BobbyScott on the House Floor.
The taxes on the wealthiest Americans in the #ACA are a key way we fund the subsidies to purchase insurance for everyone else.
The top 0.1% of earners in America will receive an average tax cut of $197,490 under #Trumpcare #Ryancare "replacement" plan.
The top 1% of wage earners get over 50% of the tax cuts in the GOP's #ACARepeal.
The top 20% of earners will receive 74.6% of the tax cuts provided under the GOP health care "replacement" plan.
Garamendi on the Floor just now: GOP's new healthcare legislation has billions in tax cuts. A majority of it goes to the top wage earners.
In general terms, we know that under the GOP plan, there will be worse coverage and higher costs for just about everybody.
The more than 3.5 million Californians who have health insurance through #MedicaidExpansion could lose it through the #ACARepeal.
3.4 million Californians acquired ensured through #MediCal, the state's #Medicaid program, thanks to its expansion under the #ACA.
1.2 million Californians have received subsidies to purchase private insurance through @CoveredCA, our state's exchange created under #ACA
Thanks to the #ACA, lifetime limits on coverage &amp; denials of coverage for preexisting conditions have been ended

"I ask my colleagues to ponder the needs of your communities. ... Build a solid foundation that won't fail" when disaster strikes.
$15-30 billion #borderwall is a choice. $1 trillion #nuclearweapons a choice. Not investing in needed life saving infrastructure a choice
Policy is about choices. We're in process of spending $1 trillion to rebuild entire #nuclear arsenal, full #Triad. Is that the best choice?
We should never delay infrastructure investments. Bridges collapse. Spillways fail. We know the needs. The question is will we meet them.
We know our infrastructure needs. #Congress must come together to meet those needs for the American people.
"We need to build a modern infrastructure for a modern economy." Can we all agree on that? Roads, transit, clean energy, airports, ports
We must invest in #ruralbroadband to increase connectivity among our communities.
Women &amp; minority owned businesses active in infrastructure &amp; equipment industry. We meet many needs beyond infrastructure w/ investment
@SenSchumer's plan would devote $20 billion to expand access to broadband, something that's incredibly important in my rural district.
Infrastructure investments also give us a chance to directly invest in good American jobs through #MakeItInAmerica requirements.
Democrats in Congress have introduced multiple infrastructure bills focused on all our needs. @senschumer bill alone would create 15m jobs.
Public-private partnerships in #infrastructure are part of the solution to overall needs. Not clear how it would have helped at #Oroville.
The #OrovilleDam is the key dam for the California water system. Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, Central Valley, entire state impacted.
Public transit investments have a $90 billion backlog in America. Highways, bridges, levees, ports, airports also woefully behind.
We need to be aware of the extraordinary need our country has for infrastructure improvements. Failures can have fatal consequences.
When @RepGaramendi was Dep Interior Secretary, he recommended improvements to New Orleans levees. Instead, a catastrophic lesson of history.

#9thCircuit made right decision. President Trump‚Äôs travel ban not just shortsighted, destructive, and counterproductive‚Äîalso likely illegal.

My colleagues and I sent a letter to @POTUS imploring him to protect vital programs for the manufacturing and small business communities. https://t.co/ibBcmvnKXU
House GOP voted before to replace #Medicare guarantee w/ coupon to purchase private insurance. It was stopped by Senate. Now? I'm worried.
Pay close attention to how any #ACA "replace" deals with #Medicare. Will we remain on track to close prescription drug coverage gap by 2020?
1 of my biggest concerns this year is the future of #Medicare. It's solvency was extended 11 years under #ACA. That progress can be reversed
H.R 861, the bill that would abolish the #EPA, would put public health and the environment in jeopardy. I vow to #DefendEPA in Congress.

Thank you @RepRaskin, @RepKhanna, and @RepJimmypanetta for joining my special order hour. I am grateful for your time and leadership.
We can delay Alzheimers by 5 years w more research. Countless savings for Medicare/Medicaid. Yet we're talking about $15 billion #borderwall
There's a lot you can do with the $15 billion Trump wants to spend on the wall. Like rebuild Flint's water pipes 270 times over.
What did GOP Congress do to you? Remove requirement for federal contractors to disclose labor violations. Should have been unanimous no vote
House GOP voted to remove oil company mandate to reduce wasted methane on public lands. #climatechange concerns earned Garamendi's no vote
A lot of the bills @RepGaramendi is talking about on House floor right now can be found here: https://t.co/Hy9VskKjPm #cspanchat
I voted no on that legislation (H.J.Res. 40)
What did GOP in Congress do last week? Vote to let individuals with severe mental health issues who are prone to violence purchase firearms
Much of what majority in Congress doing to hurt everyday Americans being eclipsed by Donald Trump‚Äôs antics. We're working to fix that.
We're seeing roll back of protections for Americans: clean water to #NetNeutrality to mortgage guarantee. Big issues "flying below radar"
.@RepRoKhanna concerned about #FCC Chair Ajit Pai's decision to "roll back Internet access for low income Americans." #cspanchat
What did Congress just do? Vote to harm land planning process that seeks input from communities, agencies &amp; good science. Garamendi voted no
.@RepRaskin notes that by 6-3 party line vote, GOP in committee voted to end federal election entity #EAC charged w election cybersecurity
.@RepRaskin says "absolutely outrageous" to "suggest moral equivalency" w/ America &amp; Russia #cspanchat
.@RepRaskin says "America has woken up to fact that #ACA repeal is real" this time. More than 60 votes to repeal. No comprehensive replace.
Executive orders "have been tossed around with very little thought to how they impact local communities." --@RepGaramendi on @cspan
Staff livetweeting @RepGaramendi &amp; friends on House floor for roughly next 50 minutes. Watch live on @cspan #cspanchat

GOP has no "replace" plan yet but #ACA "repeal" includes a proposed massive tax cut for 1% &amp; chaos and uncertainty in marketplace
Insurance companies right now are figuring out how to price insurance policies. They have no idea what to expect in new marketplace.
70% of the #ACA tax cuts would go to the 1%. A majority of the remaining 30% goes to the top 10%. How does that help the #MiddleClass?
34 health clinics in #CA03 district that provide critical primary care services. If the #ACA is repealed those clinics could go under

6/6 We can't count on bad bills stopping at Senate or White House steps. Be vigilent. Here's last week's summary: https://t.co/Hy9VskKjPm
5/6 GOP also voted to repeal a clean air rule focused on reducing wasted methane on public lands. (H.J.Res. 36)
4/6 In vote against American workers, GOP voted to eliminate rule requiring federal contractors to disclose labor violations. (H.J.Res. 37)
3/6 GOP voted to eliminate requirement for oil companies to disclose payments to foreign governments. (H.J.Res. 41)
2/6 Republican in Congress voted to allow coal companies to pollute streams and rivers last week. (H.J.Res. 38)
1/6 None of these made headlines last week but there were some consequential votes before the House of Representatives. I voted against them
I was just on @TeamCavuto and told the truth about #ACA tax repeal--70% of $700 billion would go to the top 1%. Will hurt average Americans.
I'll be on with @TeamCavuto at 9:30 (PST) this morning to talk about the latest with the Affordable Care Act. Tune into @FoxBusiness!

Here's the letter f/ @CityofDavis Mayor Davis on local impact of travel ban. List has grown since this was written. https://t.co/SIXdULsZie
"High profile scholar was set to come to @UCDavis to do research on responses to humanitarian abuses in his country." Ban put plans on hold
The ban is "already having impacts on people in our town and university, on their academic, professional and personal lives." --Davis letter
Int'l students "are our neighbors, friends &amp; colleagues. They have faces &amp; stories we know well," say Davis's Mayor &amp; Interim Chancellor
"UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya" -- @CityofDavis Mayor Robb Davis &amp; @ucdavis Interim Chancellor Ralph Hexter
Just now on House floor: Steve Bannon doesn't represent American values of inclusion, unity, acceptance. I oppose his appointment to #NSC.
On House floor, @RepGaramendi just introduced into Congressional record letter written by Davis Mayor Robb Davis about impact of travel ban
We expect @RepGaramendi on House floor &amp; @cspan soon to discuss the travel ban &amp; how it is directly impacting his constituents -STAFF

@yieldcurve23 Especially for funding affordable health care for all Americans.
The $15 billion we're spending on the #BorderWall could fund a new Ford-Class Aircraft Carrier and 1 Virginia-Class Submarine.
The $15 bil. we're spending on #Borderwall could fix the #Flint water infrastructure 270 times over.
@CSU has over 460,000 students. The $15 bil. we're going to spend on #Borderwall could fund the tuition for all 460,000 students.

7/12 Over the past 40 years, not one refugee from the countries listed under this ban has carried out a fatal terrorist attack in the U.S.
6/12 The translators, guides, and others who risked their lives to help America when it mattered most deserve better than this.
5/12 Refugees, greencard holders &amp; contributing members of our society who did everything they were supposed to, deserve better than this.
4/12 Friday's Exec Order violates U.S. fundamental values while failing to increase natl sec. We don‚Äôt want climate of fear &amp; uncertainty
3/12 Our energy &amp; resources are precious. Should not waste them on policies that cause chaos &amp; heartbreak while failing to make U.S. safer
