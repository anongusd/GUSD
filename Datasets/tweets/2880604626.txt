@EdanClay I have traveled throughout Europe and America since 1988. It is common for people to indulge in anthropomorphism. We tell stories where animals, plants, insects, toys and aliens behave and think like humans. And so God in a patriarchal society is a He.
RT @ObamaPlusKids: Have a good Memorial Day, everybody &lt;3 https://t.co/u3smUBrsFX
@EdanClay The onus then is on us: we have been given much and much is demanded of us. The work is plentiful but the laborers are few. 	Go into this world in pairs and teach people about this treasure but if they won‚Äôt listen, wipe the dust from your shoes and move on.
@EdanClay So why does God allow bad things to happen? Because He does!		We have been given the ability to create and destroy; we have become similar to God, yet still trapped in our mortal coils. 		Lao Tsu says that if we didn‚Äôt have bodies we would not suffer calamities.
@EdanClay Many pray for money or wealth but God is not concerned with the riches of earth that will all rot and turn to dust. Enlightenment, being born again, changing the way one thinks (not what one thinks) are terms describing the Kingdom of Heaven.
@EdanClay For many, they treat God like a Genie who grants wishes. In my experience He does answer prayers, but not always in the way we want. Jesus tells us to pray in secret. Former prophets tell us to pray without ceasing. Later apostles taught that one must pray in earnest.
@EdanClay One might ask: why did God tell Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when, being omniscient, He knew Adam would disobey? My answer would be that He wanted Adam to suffer, to enter the wilderness of free will and learn from it.
@EdanClay All this to say, spiritual maturity enables seeing things as they are, rather than how our egos would like things to be. Such a perspective does not ask Why therefore but says, this is how things are: the world of humans is corrupt, tending towards evil.
@EdanClay Anyway, to cut to the point, the Kingdom is not of this world, it is eternal and, it is within you, meaning that it exists only in the present moment. The Future and Past exist only in our imaginations and is where most people‚Äôs minds spend their time.
@EdanClay Indeed, most all of the 43 parables Jesus taught, reference the Kingdom of Heaven/God. The first one speaks of 4 types of people however. Some instinctively have understanding, some will never get it and, others will get it and then lose it and then get it again, on and on.
@EdanClay To paraphrase Jesus, he is reported to say, quoting Isaiah, that if understanding God were easy, everyone would turn to Him. He goes on to say that he speaks in parables so that people won‚Äôt understand but to his disciples he reveals the secrets of the Kingdom of heaven.
@EdanClay There are lessons to be learned from these allegories. The story of Babel tells of the confusion of language, which can be a barrier to understanding, for example. It seems God wants man to put some work into the learning process.
@EdanClay The stories in Genesis are often interpreted literally. It is possible those stories were borrowed from earlier myths and legends as similar stories appear in earlier, surrounding cultures like that of the Sumerians.
@EdanClay Hey there Edan,	It seems quite a few people have an opinion about God. I can empathize with your questions because i ask them too. I‚Äôm going to offer what may be a somewhat unconventional interpretation...
There are 67 Christian churches of various denominations surrounding my nearest city of 10,000 people.
When I went to several Rotary club lunches, Area Realtor Meetings, City Zoning Meetings, Chamber of Commerce Meetings, and other public events, there is always a pledge made to the flag and a Christian prayer.

@realDonaldTrump Those that know better and still lie and cheat and steal and force their will on others, are possessed by evil. Be delivered from evil: confess.
@realDonaldTrump No one is a genius in truth. We are all idiots. The Great Architect is the only genius. If we quiet our minds we can hear that creative voice of truth; that holy advocate. Be still therefore and listen through the silence for that still, quiet voice of consciousness.
@realDonaldTrump If none of what I have written resonates with you then you may be forgiven. If, however, you do know what I am talking about then, in the words of a former President: fool me once, shame on you.
@realDonaldTrump Those who have been reborn in the way they think, bear a great responsibility. They should remain vigilant. Those who are still lost, stumble around from mistake to mistake. They live blindly, leaving a trail of unhappiness.
@realDonaldTrump I refuse to be a victim of criminal abuse.
@realDonaldTrump When I asked in earnest for fear to be removed, it was. When I asked for strength, it was added. I wish the same for you. Words no longer have effect. Insults and praise alike cannot sway those who know themselves. Propaganda becomes obvious, sickening.
@realDonaldTrump A mature person will boast about their sins from before they knew any better. An immature person will boast about how they think they regularly get away with sinning.
@realDonaldTrump When insight arises, I write it down; I record it on my phone. I reflect on it later. Sometimes it is calm reflection, other times it leads to pain and self-loathing. To be honest about one‚Äôs failings in an effort to correct them is worthy of praise.
@realDonaldTrump When I began only saying things I knew to be true, I was amazed at how many little things I had said before that were inaccurate. Now, I speak rarely. For how much of what we say, do we actually know to be true for sure?
@realDonaldTrump The Truth will set you free. We are prisoners of the mind. If you only speak truth, you never have to remember anything, Twain said.
@realDonaldTrump I spent time in the Mark Twain National Forests. They reminded me of The Royal Forest of Dean where I grew up. These Ozark forests are young. Buffalo once roamed and kept down the saplings. The forests in England are thousands of years old.
@realDonaldTrump For the first three years I relied upon the kindness of people I barely knew. I worked for board and lodging just like I had in ‚Äô92 at the Youth Hostels I stayed at. It is incredibly freeing to lose attachment to all material possessions.
@realDonaldTrump That may be one of the major differences in our experiences. You have never been poor. You have never given up everything you own and trusted the wind. I have. I did. Consciously. Ten years ago.
@realDonaldTrump It is never too late to awaken: even those who arrive in the field to work in the final hour will receive the same reward, which is worth more than all the money in the world. Why are the poor so blessed? Because they are not shackled with the fear of losing material wealth.
@realDonaldTrump We reap what we sow and do not reap what we do not sow.
@realDonaldTrump We were taught the Golden Rule at school. But like all truths, its opposite is also true. If you do not consciously treat your neighbor the way you would like to be treated, then you will unconsciously be treated the way you wouldn‚Äôt want to be treated.
@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm trying to put myself in the shoes of a child who has lived here almost all their life but then is exiled to some foreign land. I think a few of them might feel resentment should that occur. They might even seek revenge.
@realDonaldTrump To leave voluntarily would be an inconvenience but not be a hardship for me. My American wife is resilient too. She‚Äôs a nurse. It would be a huge upheaval for my kids though.
@realDonaldTrump Along with an attorney in town, I created a fiduciary mechanism that would help spur new products and could help reduce the wealth gap too. I need help from a programmer to take it to the next level. If I don‚Äôt find a firm here, I will have to look elsewhere.
@realDonaldTrump For my part, I am content to leave once more, should it come to that. The Earth is an awesome planet with much to discover. There is no shortage of favorable places to move to. I would prefer to stay and help but I dislike outstaying my welcome.
@realDonaldTrump A people can suffer from group think, customs and traditions. They become homogeneous in their thoughts and ways, like dinosaurs. A visitor sees things with fresh eyes, bringing with them experience in alternative solutions.
@realDonaldTrump I believe that as an outsider I have something of great value to contribute: namely, perspective.
@realDonaldTrump It became possible to outsource nearly everything. You didn‚Äôt have to know how to build something. You could create a brand name and stick it on virtually anything.
@realDonaldTrump How we got here is not the fault of recent immigrants but rather the established ones. The business world changed back in the eighties. If you had money to invest you could get a plant overseas to make a product about twenty times cheaper. You could make huge margins.
@realDonaldTrump If I didn‚Äôt have to keep replacing junk with junk, I would be able to buy new inventions.
@realDonaldTrump The US used to produce quality products that lasted. Classic cars hold their value. Modern crap is crap. The customer ends up replacing cheap products over and over again. It is hardly an efficient use of time and energy.
@realDonaldTrump I am lucky in that I grew up without TV in a country that heavily restricts advertising. Indeed, advertising is akin to brainwashing so I avoid it as much as possible.
@realDonaldTrump Supply-side economics is a sophisticated ruse. It is the idea that if products are produced cheaply enough, there will be a market. But it requires constant badgering of consumers to make them believe they need to buy the latest thing.
@realDonaldTrump Since the 70‚Äôs the dollar has been a fiat system. The government of a sovereign currency can never run out of money. The challenge is creating new things to buy and distributing that money to the consumers.
@realDonaldTrump Unemployment is due to a lack of imagination, a lack of mobility and, adaptation. Traditionalists have an addiction to outdated Keynesian economics that were intended for gold-standard, limited money supply.
@realDonaldTrump The US is ten times less densely populated than the UK. The time to prepare this domain is now.
@realDonaldTrump England and much of Europe have been through what the US is experiencing today. Coal and oil will run out. Land will become more congested. Major infrastructure projects will be more difficult to implement.
@realDonaldTrump A tax cut to someone without a job is meaningless. Corporations treat workers like warm bodied commodities when they should be considered co-owners, co-wealth creators.
@realDonaldTrump Investment in retraining workers is required. Private capital is unlikely to move here without a technologically adept workforce. The lack of reliable high-speed internet is another disadvantage.
@realDonaldTrump If the system were to collapse, they would survive. Entitlements are a God-send in an emergency, but protracted support has made many lazy, much like those who have been endowed with a large inheritance.
@realDonaldTrump I see great potential in areas like the Ozarks. Real Estate is cheap and plentiful. The people have great talent. But hope is diminishing. Many are survivalists, relying on hunting, canning, yard sales and charity.
@realDonaldTrump Your fans still hold out hope that you will help improve their situation. There is plenty of infrastructure to be built and repaired. I thought it was going to be the first thing you would sanction.
@realDonaldTrump The people here are some of your most fervent supporters. I recognize the carnage that you spoke of relating to the factories that got shipped overseas.
@realDonaldTrump I find myself now in the Ozarks. Descendants of the Scots-Irish make up a large part of the community. Their ancestors migrated for economic reasons just as your mother did. They settled in Pennsylvania first, then the Appalachian Mountains en route to this region.
@realDonaldTrump But we created nothing truly new. It was all built on the sweat and tears of forefathers and foremothers. We are but worthless parodies of God obsessed with our own image.
@realDonaldTrump As for vanity, I think it is the worst sin of all. It makes us feel like we are the center of the universe; like demi-gods. Behold what I have created, we gloat, like Ozymandias of old.
@realDonaldTrump Successful people are happy for the successes of others. Unsuccessful people wish for their downfall.
@realDonaldTrump I personally suffered from jealousy a lot. I wanted to be like many people I admired instead of focusing on being me. I should have taken that desire and turned it into respect, so as to learn from others.
@realDonaldTrump Anger can come from many factors. Impatience is rife in this modern age of instant gratification. Regardless of its cause, I have found that anger feels like having sinus pressure that stops me from thinking clearly. Poor decisions arise.
@realDonaldTrump For those that have a tiny seed of faith, their horizons will expand. To those without hope, the walls close in. There is a balance to Life that meets her needs. The desires of men are insatiable and lead to inequality and war. One man‚Äôs gain is another man‚Äôs loss.
@realDonaldTrump Work without rest leads to exhaustion. Continued growth without regulation leads to destruction of resources. Work without purpose is drudgery, to quote an unknown medieval philosopher. People that retire with no future purpose often soon die.
@realDonaldTrump Without a certain amount of greed, a desire for more, we perish and starve. Without charity we should not expect help in our time of need. We can be suspicious of charity, in fact, if we do not know the joy of giving without wanting anything in return.
@realDonaldTrump I think that is why so many celibate priests, while expounding the virtues of abstinence, secretly practice perversion. It is unhealthy. The promiscuous lifestyle nevertheless has its own problems of disease and unwanted pregnancies.
@realDonaldTrump With a strict moral mother there was a lack of basic sex education plus a guilt association. This lead to experimentation and deviancy of thought.
@realDonaldTrump Without sex, no offspring; without work, destitution; without rest, fatigue; without abundance, poverty; without empathy, loneliness; without respect, ignorance; without wholeness, alienation.
@realDonaldTrump As they relate to Maslow and the basic survival of a species, I see a central way: Reproduction, Work, Rest, Abundance, Empathy, Respect and Wholeness.
@realDonaldTrump The sins would be Lust, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Wrath, Jealousy and Vanity. Correspondingly the virtues are Chastity, Charity, Diligence, Temperance, Patience, Kindness and Humility.
@realDonaldTrump Of the seven sins and virtues, I prefer a different order to the established one. I see them related to Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs.
@realDonaldTrump People may think we are divided at present, but I believe we are currently in balance. There are egotistical ideologues on both sides. The majority hold the center. Sadly, extreme positions get more attention. The meek have held their silence for far too long.
@realDonaldTrump Maturity in thought comes from being able to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and not go crazy, to paraphrase F. Scott Fitzgerald.
@realDonaldTrump As many prophets have said, those who cause division are evil. Some do so consciously, most unconsciously. There is no ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem‚Äù in truth. In our immature state, we are binary thinkers. Up and down, left and right, good and bad. These are childish ways of seeing.
@realDonaldTrump It felt embarrassing at first when I discovered that a lot of my perceptions about society were really projections of my own insecurities. When I had considered someone vain, for example, I was really thinking about myself.
@realDonaldTrump When I reached thirty-nine, I went through a shift. I discovered that everything I disliked about others was in truth something I didn‚Äôt like about myself. I had been so blinded by my self importance as to not see clearly.
@realDonaldTrump Some of the most high-minded individuals can be corrupt. Some of the poorest can be the most charitable. Indeed, people are full of contradictions. Those who appear tough on the outside are often soft on the inside. Beware of the seemingly quiet ones, therefore.
@realDonaldTrump Most people whom I‚Äôve met do not fit an extreme stereotype. People are complex. They surprise me constantly.
@realDonaldTrump Dad says there are only seven plotlines in all stories. He took me to every Shakespeare play he could do at the famous Stratford Theater, Swan and Barbican. Dad never explained what those seven plotlines are. I have come to see them as being related to the seven sins and virtues.
@realDonaldTrump A person‚Äôs culture creates a thematic style wherein there are a range of villains and heroes and those in between.
@realDonaldTrump After 17 years here, my conclusion is that people are largely the same the world over. Not that each person is the same, but that families and groups contain similar characters like in a play.
@realDonaldTrump My impression of America before leaving was one of a ‚Äúcan do‚Äù attitude: skyscrapers, inventions, men on the moon. The USA dominated the Olympics. US athletes seemed super-human. The US military appeared invincible.
@realDonaldTrump I have come to envy those who choose a simpler life. They build a life around community. They have friends they can count on. I am a transient. I have few true friends.
@realDonaldTrump I spent a long time searching. I used to get bored easily. I have lived in a score of different places since leaving home. I could never envisage being content to settle in the place where I was born.
@realDonaldTrump At the time, I was searching for a more egalitarian society. I could have ended up in any of several countries, but the Fates brought me to the States.
@realDonaldTrump My own country, England, was stifled by class in the seventies and eighties. She has changed a little since, but there are still plenty of private school elites in office.
@realDonaldTrump I came to the US first in 1992 for an Amtrak adventure and became a temporary resident in 2001. I do not think of myself as an immigrant, however. I am an emigrant.
@realDonaldTrump The desire to escape life‚Äôs challenges made me an expert in running away. I left relationships, I left jobs, I even left my own country.
@realDonaldTrump She used to worry a lot, my mother. Did yours? I used to see this as a weakness but now I see it as prudence to examine all the options. I wanted simple solutions, but I also just didn‚Äôt want to have to think about problems in general.
@realDonaldTrump I did the same with people. I would compare myself to them, look for their weaknesses. In management, I learnt to give a person space to be themselves and they would blossom; the interaction richer. Before that, I put people into pigeonholes. They were lifeless figurines.
@realDonaldTrump I was pretty much done with reading literature after university. I‚Äôve read the beginning to most of the classics but rarely finished a book. I could tell how the plot was likely to unfold.
@realDonaldTrump I like day-dreaming, playing games, finding diverse distractions. I‚Äôm not much of a talker though. I like to strum a guitar or watch movies or write.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe it is delusional to think one person can change the world, but this was the feeling I took from my mother. Maybe you felt the same way? Maybe your dad didn‚Äôt make you feel that way, but I‚Äôm guessing your whole life has been dominated by these two forces.
@realDonaldTrump Mother was strict about being a gentleman. Victorian in her teaching of manners. Edwardian in her approach to sex. For this reason, I eat peas with a fork and lost my virginity at the late age of twenty-one. Sex was one of two things we didn‚Äôt discuss. The other being religion.
@realDonaldTrump I imagine you having a mother who was similar in nature. One who believed in your abilities way more than you did yourself. Mine made me feel special, like I was going to do something important one day.
@realDonaldTrump Being socially awkward does not help when trying to be a playboy. We weren‚Äôt religious, but we were strict about manners and comportment. I have always felt torn between knowing what a gentleman should do and what I saw those do who knew no better. It didn‚Äôt seem fair.
@realDonaldTrump Both parents love me immensely, but my mother loves me so much that she sees past my many failings. I think this is why I much prefer the company of women to men. Indeed, I have been jealous of women to the point of wanting to conquer them.
@realDonaldTrump I subconsciously rebelled. I tried to find shortcuts. I would find the easiest way of doing something, which later turned into manipulating others to do things for me. Some might rightly deem this laziness, but I thought it clever.
@realDonaldTrump My father is a successful businessman. Your father focused on real estate but mine specialized in dairy farming for the butter industry, building a pedigree herd of Holstein-Friesians. Added to the fact that genetic diversity breeds strength, was a simple mantra: work hard.
@realDonaldTrump You may appreciate, I expect, that my father‚Äôs love was conditional upon success. This lead to resentment, coupled with a hidden desire to impress him. His criticism was often couched in humor but still hurt on the inside. He is generous and charming, yet emotionally distant.
@realDonaldTrump I reference my parents because it seems that yours and mine may have been similar in some ways. You and I share similar personality traits, copied from similar parental dynamics. Some traits were beneficial, others detrimental.
@realDonaldTrump Vividly, I remember the Holy City. I can still see the bustling streets and feel the confusion of foreign languages. We visited the birthplace of Christ, the ascension rock of Mohamed and the Palestinian slums that are all still there forty years on.
@realDonaldTrump It is possible I was conceived abroad. My parents journeyed often. As a child, they took me to France, Spain, Holland and many parts of Great Britain. When I was nine we went to Jerusalem.
@realDonaldTrump I am a traveler. I learnt to blend in like a background actor. Often it meant being someone else for other people. It helped them accept me; feel less threatened. It was a survival strategy in new places.
@realDonaldTrump As a business graduate, I wanted to apply to be a contestant on your show, but I was secretly too shy. I could play the part of an extrovert in public, so my friends couldn‚Äôt understand my hesitancy.
@realDonaldTrump I first heard about you via The Apprentice. My colleagues and I talked about the show incessantly. We held parody competitions at work. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fired!‚Äù was such a fun catch phrase.
@realDonaldTrump I think many people continue to underestimate you. The way you crafted your campaign showed shrewd marketing acumen. Yours was an impressive electoral victory.
