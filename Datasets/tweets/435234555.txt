@CatchWrestling The stories she and Shayna could tell would be amazing. That's a year-long program that practically writes itself.
@CatchWrestling Short answer: Brie Larson said there should be more diversity among movie critics, and ever white male with a dick 6" or less felt threatened and shriveled up and decided to down-vote a movie they'd never seen on Rotten Tomatoes.

@mattkoonmusic @VinceMcMahon @brutusbeefcake_ Judging by this casting decision, I think Seth Green would make a great Andre The Giant, and Ken Jeong would play a mean Vince McMahon.
@SportsHideout @IAmJericho It's a matter of metrics. Jericho should be making Brock money as I'm sure he'll be present more than once every three months. Brock is essentially being paid to sit on the major belt of a brand that only has good ratings when Becky Lynch shows up.
For instance, where the hell was Aubrey Plaza in the casting? Where was Lisa Lampanelli? Sarah Silverman? These are women who could actually improv and make a great movie. The weak spot was the director.
Everyone on social media is in rage mode over Jason's comment. People, the movie did poorly because it was awful, not because of sexism. If the new movie were all women but it actually captured the Ghostbusters vibe, everyone would be all in. https://t.co/SFhJrV2Bvg
@MattKoonTE His first WCW theme was way cooler than that later song. It had a nice groove to it. Metal guitars, but a pop sensibility with the rhythm section. Though the bassline could've been better.

A Trump supporter just liked something I tweeted. Either he can't read, or I need to reevaluate my morals.
@FrankConniff @paulfeig I'm gonna say something weird here: It's okay not to like a movie. Taste is subjective. A person is not a sexist for not liking an over-acted mug-fest that looked like a Scooby Doo movie with Ghostbusters added last minute. That's from someone who loves every lead in the movie.
Maybe it's the evolutionary biologist in me, but I not only love the modern Planet of the Apes trilogy, but the movies genuinely touch me. Not only do I think the social commentary is underrated, but if Caesar doesn't move you, you have no soul. #MovieOpinions
This knife thrower on America's Got Talent looks like the love child of David Blane and Voss from @FarCrygame 3. With some spliced Chris Angel DNA for added douchery.

@imabigfatdynamo @ScarlettFrost @JoeyRyanOnline As a male, @ChynaJoanLaurer was my favorite act from the late 90s. Strong, independent, beautiful before and after "enhancements," and she was kicking guys' asses and winning traditionally male championships. She was pro-wrestling's Xena/Red Sonja.
@JoeyRyanOnline The idea that scripted, simulated intergender wrestling matches are "simulated abuse" and "man-handling" is an incredibly sexist view and it throws the idea of equality out the window. I.e., it somehow wasn't abuse when Nia tossed the much smaller Ali out of the ring? #Dude

Many Republicans refuse to act against Trump because they fear being primaried by his base. What they're failing to remember is it's going to be a long time before the center to left voter turnout will be "2016 low" again. It's moot.

@WRESTLEZONEcom White meat baby faces don't get over anymore, and he needs to understand that. Daniel Bryan was the only exception to that, and even he was still a heel when he really got over. Becky's attitude got her over, not her penchant for kissing babies and playing by the rules.
I must say, so far #Homeland season 7 has pretty much nailed what a Clinton presidency would've been like. While I'm sure the Russians wouldn't be assassinating generals in federal prisons, there still would've remained the political assassination therein.

I'm finally getting around to watching #WWETLC, and anyone still complaining about Ronda is stupid. She sold her ass off for Nia, and honestly, she carried that match. You could see Ronda calling it.

3/4 of the orchestra stops playing during the RDR2 part. That's quite analogous to the gaming experience by comparison. Lol. #TheGameAwards
@CassHummel Same with Far Cry 5. It's all a matter of timing. FC5, Spider-Man, and AC Odyssey are all far superior games to RDR2.
@CassHummel Kassandra has been my gaming life since early October. That game deserves so many awards, but RDR2 is taking everything. If there were a VGP award, it would at least win that.
@MidknightJN @CassHummel Especially best voice actor. That should've been either God of War or AC Odyssey.
Oh my Zod, finally Grand Theft Horsey doesn't win a fucking award tonight. RDR2 is a last gen game on new gen consoles with a really good story. That is all.
The most entertaining part of the #GameAwards2018 is watching X-Box desperately trying to make a comeback. Lol. You're dead. Just deal with it.
I didn't even think. My $10 I was wasting on @83Weeks, I could double my patronage to @MuellerSheWrote. Because nobody on that podcast is a piece of human garbage who would defend the childish piece of shit who is are President.

@MarinaShafir @MsCharlotteWWE @QoSBaszler @jessamynduke @RondaRousey The 4HW vs 4HW Twitter feud is the hottest angle in wrestling at the moment, and not a single writer has touched it. That's probably why, actually.

One should never mask their pride in their heritage. People of all ancestry should learn more about their genetic past and appreciate it. However, you should always condemn those who pervert it. Every time I see Thor's Hammer on a white nationalist, I want to throw punches.

@CAMPEON_PAPI @davemeltzerWON And you think they can afford to pay him what WWE can in all metrics. They can move just as much AJ Styles merch as WWE can, or provide the same product licensing. The same exposure worldwide. AJ Styles will make NJP the biggest company in the world overnight? üòÇ
@CAMPEON_PAPI @davemeltzerWON I understand Japan just fine there, dude. "Trying" would be the key word. I love New Japan but they won't have WWE's influence in the states for a long time, even if they were to succeed, and therefore would not be able to offer him the financial security WWE can.
@ShaneHelmsCom @TheRealDisco @Konnan5150 @jffeeney3rd @neilhimself already did a great job shutting Bill down. What got me was Bill calling professors stupid for liking comics.

@CatchWrestling Entire threads on different variations of Nelson holds, complete with gifts. You don't see that anywhere else on Twitter.

@WWE @ShinsukeN @RusevBUL Even this match isn't enough to make me support this event. Kudos to the few WWE stars for refusing to be a part of it. More would have refused if they had the kind of pull Cena and Bryan do.
@CatchWrestling I first started developing my grip strength at about 7 or 8 using Nelsons. Friends and I would wrestle around and I'd always manage to hook one. Then I discovered the reverse Nelson and experienced what real control felt like. It's a wonder I found Jiu Jitsu eventually.
@BiancaBelairWWE There's some serious talent in this photo. Just like in genetics, diversity in wrestling creates the strongest result.
@echter_Stock @Trebzz003 @assassinscreed I'm not complaining. Someone is having issues and I'm offering solutions. You know, like making a contribution. You should try that sometime.
@Trebzz003 @assassinscreed Yeah, it can be a little annoying when they don't die. Especially when you've got mercenaries swarming around and you're trying to stay hidden. But it works most of the time for me even with captains since I added some stealth related engravings. Try that?
@Trebzz003 @assassinscreed Not sure what you're doing wrong, dude. I stealth-killed at least half of my current 5,000+ kill-count. Make sure your stealth attack is upgraded, and make sure you're holding the button instead of just pressing. Unless it's a captain or something, it should work all the time.

@CatchWrestling I think if they're going to do a yearly Kayfabe list, there shouldn't be anything subjective about it. They should have to list metrics like win-loss records to justify the standings, like any other sports ranking. That would at least make it somewhat interesting to me.

Get the rest of the four horsewomen out here and there will be a reason for this match to be on last. Otherwise... #WWEEvolution
Why is this match on last? The main event is already done. Why set Ronda up for failure? #WWEEvolution
I feel really bad for Nikki and Ronda having to follow that. Also, I thought the NXTUK Women's title was supposed to be defended. Wtf? #WWEEvolution

I can honestly say that I only have one complaint about @assassinscreed Odyssey. It's the unbelievable vastness of the map. Then again, it's not really a complaint since there's fast travel and all. I only wish your ship would follow to the closest dock when fast traveling.

@KayfabeNews "I've wined and dined with kingth and queenth, and... well thath pretty muth it, daddy."		Just doesn't have quite the same ring to it.
@LanceStorm @OldWrestlingPic And could those "interviews" and "decision moments" be any more rehearsed and poorly acted. Scripted television, be it wrestling or otherwise, are the realest things on TV, since at least they're honest about what they are.
So, decades of oppressing women, murdering homosexuals, the fact that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, decades of theocratic terrorism - nothing. Wait, a journalist is presumed dead? We may have to pull out of this. Priorities, priorities, @WWE. https://t.co/gclboyOiXw

@bstevewhite @EBischoff You're accusing me of "calling for war" because I directly quoted Donald Trump. Now that's reaching.
@bstevewhite @EBischoff Correct. In bringing up an example of when other far more powerful politicians have far more directly called for violence. Look, I disagree with what she actually said, because I don't believe we can't be civil with one another, but it was far from a call for war.
"I never claimed I wasn't a hypocrite. I merely said OTHERS shouldn't be hypocritical."		Best quote I've pulled out of my ass mid-conversation in years.
Okay. Here's a moment where I say something nice about someone I detest. This is long overdue. https://t.co/xoI3oQNxae
@bstevewhite @EBischoff If you're actually seeing parallels between what she said, and what is depicted in the cartoon, you're buying into the hyperbole. I don't like Hillary, but I don't see her calling for "second amendment solutions" against her detractors like some politicians.
@EBischoff Agreed, but let's not pretend that's a one-sided issue in our current climate of extremism taking over both major parties.

And of course he had to clarify that the moisture from the storm was caused by liquid water. It could've easily been a liquid nitrogen or liquid helium hurricane. I personally thank Mr. Trump for his descriptive clarification!

Listening to @WHWMonday and watching along with Heatwave '98. I'll have to double check my original copy, but I seem to remember a whole lot more commentary bumpers between matches, with a whole lot more Francine on camera. What say you, @HeyHeyItsConrad?
@ECWDivaFrancine @WHWMonday @HeyHeyItsConrad @tonyschiavone24 I've tweeted that PPV to then every time they've asked for suggestions. Not only my favorite ECW PPV, but the only one I ever attended.
@jhoffman I loved ALF but I think the whole reboot thing is going a little far. While I prefer it to reality TV, it won't be long until my guide looks like it would've in 1989 had onscreen guides existed then. üòâ

I gave @NBCMakingIt a shot tonight. I really didn't know what to expect going into it. The competition part seemed a bit scattered, and I'm surprised there wasn't more comedy from Amy and Nick, as they're both probably hilarious while merely sleeping. I'll watch again next week.
@WWE @mikethemiz @MizandMrsTV @WWEDanielBryan Gold, but come on. This is a Mania match. Keep the rivalry going and don't give it away so soon.
@WWERamsey "HEY! *clears throat* I mean, hey, CBS Sports? My name is Joe Blou...sen...berg...heimer... or something. I'm at attendance at WWE Raw tonight and I just saw Hulk Hogan and The Rock. Just thought you'd want to know. Bye!"		--Vince McMahon (5:00 PM, Monday)
@RumblingRumors Yep. Also, Suicide Squad did tremendously in theaters. Just like with Suicide Squad, I'm pretty sure well over half the people who watched Raw last night wish they could take back their contribution.
Notice how quiet the NRA has been over the 3-D printed gun situation? Could it be they're trying to figure out how to come out against 3-D printed guns without making it blatantly obvious to everyone they're nothing more than a lobby for gun manufacturers? Just a thought.

@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON Wow. Ad hominem attacks. You must be quite the intellectual. Lol
@EBischoff I was attacked by several people on @davemeltzerWON's account for suggesting open discourse. That's all I needed to learn about that camp. They're the types who think they should believe whatever is in the headlines without skepticism.
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON You forgot the comma, by the way. English is a good class to attend. Lol
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON Considering the word "nerd" is in my handle, I don't take that as an insult. Just remember you're the one who objects to an open debate. That says a lot, dude.
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON Lol. Whatever, dude. I was trying to be explanatory and nice, but I forgot that shit doesn't fly on today's internet. But by all means, keep believing whatever you read at face value. That's Trump's America. Lol
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON I would disagree with that. I'm skeptical of everything I read. I have an education in science that teaches me to be that way, and considering the current state of American media, more people would do well to be skeptical. But hey, we can agree to disagree.
@1ChicagoDave @RNS You're not a Christian. You're a modern conservative Xtian. There's a difference.
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON I couldn't disagree more. If he's actually right about all of his claims, and could prove so in a debate (the objective stuff instead of the subjective, mind you) it would legitimize him to those who are skeptical of his work. That alone would bring in more money for him.
@ToyBoxSuperFan @davemeltzerWON Debate is never a waste of time. Discourse is important.
@QU4DZER0 The only reason some want the split is so that there are two MORE conservative senators, and even more conservative electoral party votes. It's blatant gerrymandering at best.

#ExtremeRules I love both of these guys, but the psychology here is greatly lacking. When Dolph was fresh, Rollins pinned him twice in three minutes with roll-ups. Now that Dolph is blown up, Rollins can't pin him with signatures. ü§î

@83Weeks was tremendous today. Though I'm a bit sad to hear @EBischoff for the Raven character or his promos. As a teen at the time, Raven was easily among the top five reasons I watched Nitro instead of Raw. I agree, though, that his pre-tapes were better than his promos.

#NerdOnNitro #WCWNitro June 16, 1997: 	2nd week in a row hour two started with fireworks going off out of nowhere in the middle of an #nWo match. Also, the second week in a row half the crowd shit themselves in unison.		Hey, nobody flipped over to #Raw! Nicely done @EBischoff. üìà
#NerdOnNitro #WCWNitro June 9, 1997: 	Great main event but possibly one of the clumsiest endings ever. All of the performers did their best with what they had, but sometimes everyone's timing gets thrown off all at once. Three minutes later, Sting and DDP finally ascend. #nWo
#NerdOnNitro #WCWNitro June 9, 1997:	Finally, The Wolfpac arrives! And they're taking on Ric Flair and "Rowdy" Roddy Piper. This would've been one of those times in 1997 when I let the VCR watch #RAW for me. #ICON #nWo
#NerdOnNitro #WCWNitro June 9, 1997:	Ugh. The Dungeon of fucking Doom. Well, at least Miss Jacqueline is out there so there's something interesting while Kevin Sullivan cuts a promo. The man could book heat, but he couldn't get it himself to save his life.
#NerdOnNitro #WCWNitro June 9, 1997:	Deborah accompanies the guy she'll soon leave her husband for to the ring. He'll be facing Dean Malenko; the man who Bret Hart insists is dangerous in the ring. Of course, who hasn't Bret said that about aside from himself?
#NerdOnNitro June 9, 1997:	After two brawls that nearly kill Mean Gene and Deborah McMichael, we finally get a match, and it's Luger vs Hogan... to cap hour no. 1 for some reason. Liver wins with what should've been a bigger pop IMO.
@HeyHeyItsConrad @PrichardShow @bruceprichard That's fucking gold right there!
#NerdOnNitro June 9, 1997:	How did @Madusa_rocks hit a German suplex so bloody well, let alone three in a row, with those funbags on her chest? Damn she was a pro. Only real pop of the night so far.

@claudsbelanger @TheRealXPac You're absolutely right, which is why psychologists started referring to them as clinical conditions as opposed to mental health conditions. It just hasn't quite caught on with the general public yet. Stigma and all...
@TheRealXPac @gerryravioli It was, and it kind of got my bone as a healthcare worker myself. But I wish I'd read all of your comments afterward before I'd responded. Different things work for different people, because no reuptake disorder is identical to another.
@TheRealXPac Issues need to be addressed, obviously, but reuptake inhibitors save a lot of lives. I'm one of them. They're not meant to fix underlying issues, but they do effect the reuptake disorder within the brain causing the clinical depression.

@EBischoff @HeyHeyItsConrad You and I don't agree politically, but that didn't stop me from listening to your last podcast. I'm happy, however, that this podcast is working out better and is successful. The lack of politics has little to do with it, it's just the @HeyHeyItsConrad magic. üòâ

@ShaneHelmsCom Totally with you. I get expressing criticisms on social media, as we all do that, but some people just take it too far and bash every little thing. There's a shit ton of good in today's wrestling. The indie scene is off the chains and WWE is practically 2010 ROH.
@tonyschiavone24 @DDPYoga @RealDDP That's a bit more weight than is healthy to lose in a week. But kudos anyway. I've done the program off and on for a couple of years. It's very effective when used properly. Let's see that six-pack by Christmas! üòÅ

Today's @whyitended really hit me hard. So sorry to hear about @PJPOLACO's wife in the midst of his struggle with addiction. I say this not as a mark for you, PJ, but as a fellow man and recovering addict: I'm among thousands who are here whenever and wherever.
@EBischoff You actually shouldn't drink at all when doing keto. You put a huge strain on your liver, and from what I've read, you put yourself at risk of ketoacidosis. Though while on keto, you greatly reduce your risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, so there's a balance I guess.
@hankgreen I think it depends. If you're just wearing one, and you have the attention span to fully interact with others, then I think it's fine. I'm a morning to night podcast listener and almost always have one in, but I've never had issues hearing or fully interacting with others.

@MattSingh1 @EBischoff I said they had no contact with anyone in the company? Is that straw I smell? I said they had nothing to do with the ins and outs or day to day operations of the company. Also, on the subject of fallacies, what is your source on the Meltzer-Bischoff communication? Meltzer?
@MattSingh1 @EBischoff Did you read that book? It's filled with even more ad hominem attacks than your tweets.
@MattSingh1 @EBischoff DDP, Benoit, Jericho, and Raven. Yes, those company execs battling with TW/AOL for all of those years running a wrestling company.		Also, the fact that you can't get through one tweet without acting condescending is a true sign of your exceptional intellect.
@MattSingh1 @EBischoff So, a book by two people who had nothing to do with the ins and outs, or day to day operations of WCW, who also contradict most first-hand accounts from those inside the company? Sure. Let's also go to https://t.co/jBMVLq8wEq for political discussion. üòÇ
@MattSingh1 @EBischoff What's embarrassing is that you found my reply verbose when it was clearly dumbed down for 280 characters. Also, I wouldn't refer to others as pompous while you're saying, "Reading would be your friend." As if to infer that if others disagree with you, they must be illiterate.

@RondaRousey @RealKurtAngle @WWE You four saved what was an otherwise odd night. You are legit, ma'am!
#WrestleMania So let's recap. U.S. Title goes to Jinder who pins Rusev. Asuka's streak ends pointlessly with no story going forward after almost three years undefeated. Shinsuke turns heel for some reason. Bayley and Sasha barely get a Mania moment. And now this.
#WrestleMania Thinking I should take my ear buds out before @WWEDanielBryan's entrance. I'd like to be able to hear tomorrow.
#WrestleMania Who's ready to walk... with Elias?
RT @JerryTravone: #WrestleMania #RondaRousey #TripleH #KurtAngle #stephaniemcmahon https://t.co/oRNMWmUP44
@TheMikeLawrence *Worm rather.
@TheMikeLawrence Yeah, but I'd rather have them wrestling on a pre-show than dressed as pancake stacks and doing the work.
#WrestleMania I never doubted @RondaRousey for a second. I knew she'd pick the business up right away. Life-long fans have a way of doing that.
#WrestleMania Jebus, I can smell the Turinabol on HHH's breath from here. Lol
#WrestleMania Man I wish I were watching #NXTTakeOver right now instead of this shit. "I know. We'll end Asuka's streak, then make Jinder Mahal the champ. Oh, and he'll go over Rusev!"
#WrestleMania Can we get #RusevDay trending?
@WWEUniverse @RandyOrton @REALBobbyRoode @JinderMahal @RusevBUL I think you know what day it is.
#WrestleMania That referee told @JohnCena there is a sale on bright orange hats and denim shorts on Bourbon Street.
#WrestleMania Well, once again @WWE makes a stupid decision to end a streak and kill a story for no reason. And again in New Orleans.
#WrestleMania Seth Rollins is a white walker. Lol. George R. R. Martin would be proud.
#WrestleMania Okay, who lost the run sheet? Individual entrance, group entrance where the ad was supposed to be, individual entrance, then an ad playing during the last individual entrance.
#WrestleMania You know I'm trying to watch a fucking match here, @WWENetwork.
#WrestleMania Black Panther VS Sub-Zero? Lol
#WrestleMania Now can @MATTHARDYBRAND put the trophy into the Lake of Reincarnation?
#WrestleMania Why is there an ad in the middle of a match? And an ad for the thing I'm already watching? #wtf @WWE
#WrestleMania Battle Royal time. #forearm #forearm #forearm
#WrestleMania We really ought to get these pre-show matches started. Fewer than 90 minutes to go.
Why do I feel like there will be a lot of people in Japan skipping work today to watch @ShinsukeN win the gold today? #WrestleMania
#WrestleMania I can't wait for the Wrestle Kingdom 10 rematch. If they were that good over an Intercontinental championship, I can't imagine was a world title match will look like.
#WrestleMania Hour one of seven hours of wrestling begins. Kick off show starts now.
There may have been a bit of a lull for a while, but after the last two #NXTTakeOver shows, I'm back to feeling bad for the @WWE "main roster" shows having to follow them.
#NXTTakeOver That was incredible.
#NXTTakeOver I'm prepping myself for the best wrestling match I will ever see.
I don't think I've been this happy about a title change since Daniel Bryan won the championship. Congrats again, @WWEAleister! https://t.co/gmDlVTOITX
#NXTTakeOver I love NXT so much right now! Congrats @WWEAleister!
#NXTTakeOver That double moonsault brought to you by Kota Ibushi btw. Lol
#NXTTakeOver Pete Dunn is the only person alive who never skips leg day, but skips arm day weekly. Lol.
#NXTTakeOver Outstanding performance by both @QoSBaszler and @WWEEmberMoon. Great storytelling and tremendous selling. Women's wrestling is still alive in @WWENXT.
#NXTTakeOver @QoSBaszler may be green but she's a hell of a seller.
#NXTTakeOver There's my quad-goddess, @WWEEmberMoon. Complete with @Halestorm.
#NXTTakeOver Jebus bloody Christ that was insane. I think everyone was bleeding from somewhere by the end of it. Here's hoping everyone is okay. That being said, I just had a wrestle-gasm. Someone get me a cigarette. Congrats @AdamColePro BAY BAY!
#NXTTakeOver @KingRicochet just gave me chills with that entrance.
@wwe did a hell of a job with that Chronicle on @ShinsukeN. I think his English is improving as well.

@Littlemisskate4 I tweeted this five years ago, but hopefully after this year's speeches, it'll be true next year.

#WWEHoF I fucking love this kid. He even makes up for Dana Warrior putting herself over for 20 minutes.
#WWEHoF Oh she's done putting herself over. Now we can talk about JJ finally.
#WWEHoF Jeff Jarrett had the best speech yet and he did it in a tenth of the time it took Hillbilly Jim, complete with music outro.
#WWEHoF I almost thought it wouldn't happen. I'm loving this. #DoubleJ #WithMyBabyTonight

#WWEHoF Nice to see Kid Fuck-Banana dressed up for the occasion. Was the Goodwill having a sale?

@JPBark @ShaneHelmsCom @TheJimCornette https://t.co/tI3M4Z2ZhA
@CubanRedNeck27 @ShaneHelmsCom @TheJimCornette And everything said is very sensible. I'm a person who is a gun owner who hasn't smoked weed in nearly 16 years. I'm ashamed to live in a country where a 19-year-old can be arrested for an ounce of weed but can buy a military machine gun.
I just listened to the greatest conversation about sensible gun laws I've ever heard. It wasn't between two politicians or philosophers. Sorry to burst your stereotype bubble, but it was between two professional wrestling personalities. Follow @TheJimCornette and @ShaneHelmsCom.
@WWERamsey I like it, but first priority needs to be either a Bryan vs Nakamura or Bryan vs AJ program. Plus there isn't much left of The Authority as it was then, so I like the suggestion from a former commenter to have Joe represent The Authority.
@WWE @MustafaAliWWE @DrewGulak You just don't see the Koji Clutch enough in American wrestling.
@HeyHeyItsConrad @PrichardShow @bruceprichard Maybe it's telling of my personality, but I do adore an angry @bruceprichard.

@PAGNOTTI_ @Madusa_rocks @AJStylesOrg @ShinsukeN As good as Asuka vs Charlottle would be, AJ and Nakamura have worked together before. I guarantee they would take the sails out of the Wrestlemania ship no matter who follows it. üòâ

Didn't expect @bruceprichard to put @CMPunk over so much on @PrichardShow today. Pleasantly surprised. Great f'n show as always!
@HeyHeyItsConrad Wow. Way too much arguing on this thread. Let's just be happy we're about to see the most physical match in WWE history.
As someone old enough to remember #GLOW from the 80s, @GlowNetflix is absolutely fantastic. @marcmaron is hysterical.

@HeyHeyItsConrad @THEVinceRusso @PrichardShow After the fourth incorrectly pronounced word I stopped. Ablum? Are you retarded?
It's so awesome to hear @SeanMooneyWho's voice the air again. Such a huge part of my childhood. #EventCenter #Primetime
@im_matt5 @WWENeville Umm... Lol. If your dad smoked .75 tons of weed in less than 15 minutes, I'd love to see the bong he used.
@WWENeville Cruiserweight legend right here.
@TheMikeLawrence @MaskedManShow Deeply ashamed. Lol
@Zepravity Hopefully you're right, but I'm pessimistic at this point. But at least all of the matches were awesome. The talent made salad out of shit.
RT @AdamTheBlampied: #MITB https://t.co/clqebz1FHk
#MITB I've never seen a show that was so great overall, but had such shit finishes. Sad that I re-subscribed for this event.
@amy_monks Agreed 100%. It was a slap in the face of the "women's revolution."
#MITB There was a theme to the night. Two fantastic #MITB matches with horse shit endings. #SmackDownLIVE is losing its cred quickly.
#MITB Prettiest sunset flip powerbomb I've ever seen on a ladder match. Congrats @iLikeSamiZayn and @HEELZiggler.
#MITB Careful with the dives, @iLikeSamiZayn, you'll make the dinosaurs take to Twitter again. Those who know how to internet, anyway.
#MITB Love the Fashion Police. Great talent and their videos are loaded with hilarious insider and old school references.
@Kevster823 @WWE Here's hoping.
#MITB Mike Bennett and Maria... Finally in @WWE... And that's the fucking gimmick they give them? Okay, well let's give it time I guess.
People are shitting on this match, but aside from a couple little things, @LanaWWE is actually doing wonderfully. #MITB
So the message being sent by @WWE at #MITB is in the first women's MITB match, the person who retreaves the briefcase is a man. Seriously...
Blacking out: It's like your body saying to your brain, "Bro, I got it from here."

@HeyHeyItsConrad @PrichardShow Goddamn, pal! That's no way to talk me into the building. But shit, I'll listen anyway. I love me some @bruceprichard!
@TheJimCornette better share the location of his meeting with Russo, because he talked me right the fuck into the building with that promo.

@HeyHeyItsConrad That and it would turn into a blame-game storm on Twitter. It's better to celebrate Owen than dwell on the macabre.
@WWEAsuka Most hypnotic eyes in the business, as well as the most dangerous kicks. üòç
@mauroranallo It's so great to see you back in a high. Or maybe this is mid-range Mauro. Either way, it's great to hear your voice again, sir!

@VinnieTortorich Well, it's from Fox News, so only morons would take it seriously.
@RicFlairNatrBoy Stop embarrassing the industry. You're not the "Nature Boy" anymore. Sober up and be an adult!
I can't be the first to suggest @netflix should carry @RedDwarfHQ. One of the greatest shows ever.
@TazShowLive AOD on Spotify.
@PrichardShow @bruceprichard My masochistic tendencies forced me to vote for Katie Vick just to know once and for all who the fuck thought that was a good idea.
#RAWaftermania Seriously, @WWENeville has the best upper body physique in the business. I will pay hundreds for those DVDs. Lol. @WWE
@WWE @WWENetwork I knew you'd come!
@WWE @WWENetwork Will Matt be Breuken talking about Vince Meek Mahon? Lol. Where is Vanguard One? Lol
@paulmurrell123 Absolutely. He's a natural heel.
@baileighoffic @WWERomanReigns He's a natural heel. And as much as I've bashed him, this year is Roman's year if he maintains that persona. I love to hate him. üòÉ
#RAWaftermania Anyone else on Twitter watching in the gym instead of your parents' basement?
#RAWaftermania DELETE! OBSOLETE! DELETE! OBSOLETE!
@baileighoffic @WWERomanReigns Right, but booing is what they're going for. Roman just made himself the hottest heel in the business with four words. I'm proud of him.
@paulmurrell123 I never thought I would favorite a tweet containing those words, but I completely agree.
#RAWaftermania Roman finally has good heat. FINALLY!
@baileighoffic @WWERomanReigns But that was the point. Roman just made himself the biggest heel on the business, and that was undoubtedly the plan. It's good for Roman.
#RAWaftermania That promo said it all. Roman can't turn heel when he already is one.

#WrestleMania They could compromise over the yard. Roman could take care of the garden and the landscaping. Se√±or Roman.
#WrestleMania Instead of having this match, can't someone just produce the deed to said yard? Property lines are available at City Hall.
#WrestleMania Come on, @BeckyLynchWWE! #FourHorseWomen
#WrestleMania Well hello, Alexa!
#WrestleMania If the Ramones can make a career off of four chords, why can't these two make a career off of four moves? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
#WrestleMania Michael Cole doesn't know the difference between a midsection and a sternum.
#WrestleMania Why?
#WrestleMania Hell of a match with great psychology! Kudos @WWERollins and @TripleH! And to @StephMcMahon for the table bump!
#WrestleMania John Cena is mouthing in her ear, "Now you know this is just for TV right? I'm not really gonna marry you."
#WrestleMania Nice of Cena and Nikki to go out on there... Oh wait. I forgot this match was just an episode of Total Bullshit.
#WrestleMania Cena has to delay as that ramp was all of his cardio. 200 Dbol cycles can do that to you. #EverythingInModeration
#WrestleMania Could we be introduced to the fucking UN AFTER @MaryseMizanin's entrance is over please?
#WrestleMania Vanguard One should swoop in a get the titles!

#WrestleMania Nia Jax loses first but still walks out a monster. Good booking. Should have done the same with the Authors of Pain last night
#WrestleMania I love these girls and all, but I swear I saw this same match last night. Nia Jax, Authors of Pain, whichever.

#AskHeyman Did they ever find out who cut off your ponytail? Was it Brutus Beefcake? Or was it Tommy Dreamer?
#WrestleMania So awesome seeing @notsam on @WWE events! So proud of that little fucker.
#WrestleMania Why did Mojo have a mark from an AED on his chest? Did he get a little too hyped earlier? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
#WrestleMania Getting my laundry out. Has Braun won the battle royal yet?
@shockmasternuno @RealMickFoley You forget that @shanemcmahon is wrestling. It'll be used. Lol
@WrestleGirlsAss Thank you for that!
#WrestleMania There was my 13 point victory for the @TazShowLive picks. Lesnar better do me right for my 12.
#WrestleMania If more cruiserweight matches incorporated storytelling the way Neville and Aries just did. It would command more respect.
#WrestleMania All hail King @WWENeville!
#Wrestlemania proving again that @WWENeville isn't just king of the cruiserweight, but also the king of chest day.

#NXTTakeOver Excellent performance, and I hope that finish means we'll see a rematch. And maybe another after that! @WWEAsuka @WWEEmberMoon
#NXTTakeOver No more pink on the women's title. Good.
@WWEEmberMoon vs @WWEAsuka at #NXTTakeOver. This is going to be an instant classic. Best in the world.
#NXTTakeOver That match was like having the best sex of your life, but toward the end, the woman shits on you. Seriously. What the fuck?
#NXTTakeOver is the only reason I subscribe to the @WWENetwork. This match more than justifies the purchase. Astounding. #DIY #AOP #Revival
#NXTTakeOver To translate for Razar, he just said he prefers his potatoes mashed.
#NXTTakeOver No! Get rid of the AOP first! Then we can see the title match we all really want to see.
