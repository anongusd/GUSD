@DonaldJTrumpJr Or just maybe it’s PTSD? PTSD is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

@EqualityCouple @JudyChu06634420 @ThomasKlineMD The Pain Management Drs (at least in AZ) use threats if you don’t follow the plan they will block any pharmacist on feeling any pain meds regardless who prescribed  them. These threats is why most senior hoard their meds. This is a huge problem.
@JudyChu06634420 @EJSIZEMORE @ThomasKlineMD Every 6 months is one thing but PM Dr in AZ has it done every month.
@JudyChu06634420 @ThomasKlineMD I recorded the conversation because no one would believe it. To top things off if she had any “addition” the hospital would have reported it before the surgery so it would have been in the file. If Medicare wants to save money stop monthly pee tests for people over 65!
@ThomasKlineMD Think you Dr. Kline. I wish more Drs would tweet about how ridiculous this has become. My mom just had open heart surgery and when she was released from care she only was given one week of pain meds. The pain Dr made her pee in a cup a week later when she could not even stand.

@realDonaldTrump Agents Registration Act? “On June 9, 2016, a meeting was held in Trump Tower in NY City between three senior members of the 2016 Trump campaign – Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort – and at least five other, including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya”.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It’s almost like the GOP never took an economic course. This means overall cost of living will go up. People who will benefit the most are home owners with fix mortgage. https://t.co/yFeAa14MPH

@GOP 2nd what about the 14th? “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”. https://t.co/RsHrjlRRga
