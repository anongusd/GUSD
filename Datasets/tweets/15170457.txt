Bisexuals and pansexuals often find that they are not accepted by the general public nor the LGBT community. It is time that we work to change this. #LoveIsLove #BiVisibilityDay #BiVisibilityWeek
Bisexuals are much less likely to be openly about their identities: 28% of bisexuals reported that all or most of the important people in their life know that they are bisexual compared to 77% of gay men and 71% of gay women. 	You are still valid.
Men are significantly less likely to identify as bisexual than women: more than half of LGBT women identify as bisexual, whereas substantially more than half of LGBT men identify as gay. Bisexual men, you are still valid.
Over half of the LGBT community identifies as bisexual or pansexual, but these identities are notoriously forgotten and sometimes outright denied space within the LGBT community.
We are proud to celebrate #BiVisibilityDay. From our members to openly bi elected officials, we stand with and support the bisexual community who constantly have their identities erased and invalidated. https://t.co/OyEWInLkKZ
