In 2006, when the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized, not a single Republican in the Senate voted against it. #HR4 deserves the same response. The right to vote is not a partisan question.
The evidence of the continued need for these important safeguards couldn‚Äôt be more clear.  Previous history of discrimination in a jurisdiction?  Yes, that jurisdiction should be required to receive approval for changes to voting procedure. https://t.co/3E7gf9aXYO
Voter ID should never have been on the ballot in November. NC GOP continues to try and make it more difficult to vote and influence the political process. It‚Äôs pointed. It‚Äôs wrong. And once again, it‚Äôs unconstitutional. #ncpol  https://t.co/NUFnlQ3sjW

Dems continue to introduce ways of making VOTING easier.  Reps continue to search for reasons to stymie those efforts. This is cyclical and will remain that way until Rs concede that voting (regardless of race or preference) is an inalienable right #HB1	https://t.co/II2lFjSZGB

Many republicans at the hearing seem to be uncomfortable with the idea of making it easier for people to vote. They suggest that HR1 will hurt their electability.
No matter how you look at it, people are still trying to make it harder for people to vote. #HR1 will make it easier to vote.
