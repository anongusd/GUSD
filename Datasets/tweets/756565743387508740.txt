@mschlapp Flake is living up to his name!
@tgwimages @LisaMarieBoothe @ChuckGrassley It really shouldn't be tough to vote at all...because not voting is having more resistance and obstruction. Do you really want more of the craziness spewed by the Dems and have them being in absolute control??? The thought scares me!
@sjaramillo2003 @BobHugin You must be joking @sjaramillo2003
READ THIS --&gt; This November, we have a clear choice between left and right, and I look forward to voting for @tedcruz: https://t.co/Q2aBJgNtbC I #ChooseCruz for #TXSen! #TXSenateDebate
I'm tuning in to watch @tedcruz #CruzToVictory in the #TXSenateDebate. Watch LIVE at 6 pm CT: https://t.co/xOyogf0GJH or https://t.co/6kBUGltzMI #TXSen #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
WATCH: @betoorourke wants to decriminalize unauthorized border crossings. I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because we need a leader to stop the chaos at the border. Help keep Ted's new TV ad on the air --&gt; https://t.co/pA0uL7pEfU #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
@CarmineSabia between this latest malfeasance and her Chinese "driver"...its time for Sen. Feinstein to pack it up and head west
@SenFeinstein With all due respect, perhaps if you truly were concerned about getting to the bottom of the accusations towards Judge Kavanaugh, you would have used all that time between July and now to have it properly investigated. It is shameful. Have you not learned anything?
WATCH: "I support @tedcruz because of where he stands on protecting the liberties Texans hold dear." Join me and #ChooseCruz to #KeepTexasRed --&gt; https://t.co/1swrWQImTo #TXSen
@BuzzPatterson Way to keep it classy @mjfree. There are ways to voice negative opinions without taking it to the gutter. I dont think I will ever watch Driving Miss Daisy in the same way again.
I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because unlike @betoorourke, I think refusing to stand for the national anthem is disrespectful to those who have sacrificed so much for America. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ #ChooseCruz #IStand
@BuzzPatterson @SenWhitehouse is obnoxious and rude. If you ask a question, allow an answer.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenJohnMcCain I loved your beautiful and heartfelt tribute to your dear friend  @SenJohnMcCain.  God Bless
@JoeConchaTV And Hannity is not part of the White House press pool representing himself as a journalist
.@SenBooker say no to this 2,000+ page monstrosity that no one has had time to read. Cut spending. Repeal Obamacare. Build the Wall. #Omnibus #CutSpending
.@SenatorMenendez say no to this 2,000+ page monstrosity that no one has had time to read. Cut spending. Repeal Obamacare. Build the Wall. #Omnibus #CutSpending
.@SpeakerRyan do you remember this? "When we rush to pass bill that a lot of us don't understand, we are not doing our job." #JobFailure #CutSpending #NoBailouts #BuildtheWall https://t.co/NcLHWhSUUm
.@SenateMajLdr the American people expect more from Republican ‚Äúleaders.‚Äù This omnibus looks more like something Schumer/Pelosi/Obama would pass. #CutSpending #KeepYourPromises

@ShepNewsTeam @FoxNewsSunday @POTUS If I wanted to watch such a liberal biased news show I would watch CNN. UGH!
RT @Ford: Some call it competition. We call it family. Who are you rooting for at #Daytona500? #FordDaytona https://t.co/HFgDWgbtSw
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton #hillarysemail Is ehe for real???
@thehill  I guess all the "onservatives" that are worried about supporting @realDonaldTrump are forgetting the big picture...SCOTUS
@MelissaAFrancis @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Great job on @Judge Jeanine! Really enjoyed your interaction with your guests.
@FoxNews @DavidGoodfriend @ClintonFdn could he be any more skewed in his opinion.
