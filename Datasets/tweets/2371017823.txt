@JRubinBlogger @PhilippeReines @djrothkopf @EricBoehlert The answer to that question would be no and note to her Bush is no longer President. She is not the equal of Potus. The judicial is the 3rd branch of govt and not the House and Senate.
@JamesDissent @brithume Next step is to read the article and learn Steele says his dossier is bullshit. Your response tells me your TDS is so bad you cant accept the truth. Even from the guy who create the fake dossier.		https://t.co/6Lydkqwzpd
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Tell us then - where does the $93 trillion come from for your deal?
@brithume https://t.co/6Lydkqwzpd
@JamesDissent @brithume If you dont believe me then how about from the author himself - Steele		https://t.co/6Lydkqwzpd
@JamesDissent @brithume absolutely nothing has been proven about the dossier.
@brithume No worries though. Congressional Democrats are opening up investigations into what Mueller spent the last 2+ years looking at and not finding.
@thehill Once again Bernie / Democrats are projecting their actions onto Trump. Democrats are the ones who keep invoking the race card. Guess Democrats are still smarting from losing the civil war and their slaves.
@RepSwalwell Its the truth and instead of being a man and owning your TDS hate you respond with a snowflake image.		Pussy.
@JuddLegum Mueller already investigated these. My guess is he found nothing criminal so Democrats are going to manufacture crimes - again.
@tedlieu @POTUS A - He is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. B - you need a crime to investigate a person and NOT the other way around. C - You are continuing to show the American people all Democrats care about is removing potus.		A coup will not be tolerated by the people.

@thehill The FEC and a Federal Court have also  said hush money is not  a crime.

@therealcornett He is violating Federal law and needs to be charged.
@votemarkgreen @1982Firefox @starsandstripes Was his death tragic - Yes	Should hhe have died - No	Should NK be held accountable - Yes	Trump has absolutely nothing to do with what occurred. Stop trying to blame him for what the guy did on his own accord.
@votemarkgreen @1982Firefox @starsandstripes It is no different than a foreigner trying to enter a country while smuggling drugs knowing full well the sentence for that is death.
@votemarkgreen @1982Firefox @starsandstripes Really? Does potus know everything the FBI is doing? What about US prisons? He is not a victim. He traveled to a country knowing full well where he was going and how things work there. He never should have went, let alone breaking NK law.
@1982Firefox @starsandstripes You morons on the left need to join the rest of us in reality. Make a counter argument to refute the facts. Instead you bitch and moan. Clinton colluded w/ Russia ass hat.

@OptimisticPer10 @EdKrassen Secondly all people charges were for crimes decades ago... like manafort.
@OptimisticPer10 @EdKrassen And yet not one person of all those indicted were charged with collusion. U can NOT investigate a person to find a crime.
@churcham32 @RepSwalwell The other issue is civilians dont get access to all the info let's do.
@churcham32 @RepSwalwell The amendment requires notification now.
@churcham32 @RepSwalwell Illegal aliens aren't in our databases for background checks. Only US citizens are (and some perm lawful aliens). An attempt to purchase by an illegal will flag. Prior no notification was given to ice even though it's illegal for foreigners to buy a gun in the US.
@ABC While desperately trying to block an amendment that requires ICE notification if an illegal alien tries to buy a firearm. Aside from 26 Democrats the remainder need to explain why, if they think this law is so important, its ok to exempt illegal aliens.
@RepSwalwell Explain to us all why Democrats didnt want an amendment that required ICE be notified if an illegal alien attempts to purchase a fire arm? Care to comment on the 26 Democrats who supported the Republican amendment and helped pass it.
@RealJack Witness tampering actually.

@TomJolly @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Hush money payments are not illegal as the FEC noted in John Edwards case.
@EdKrassen No he was disbarred for crimes Cohen committed and they are unrelated to Trump Russia collusion.
@paulsperry_ Even if it were its not illegal and does not violate campaign finance laws.
@JamesAGagliano Or do US law enforcement agencies not investigate Democrats?
@JamesAGagliano Then they should have just made their own server in someones basement and assign fake names to the high ranking people so they can communicate w/out others knowing. Or open a gmail account, give everyone logins and communicate using drafts.
@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump and its because of Obama/Clinton lying to Gaddafi about not being removed if libya gave up its wmd's. The position you see is Democrats fault.

@RepSwalwell @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump Remember this. Cohen is going to jail for several reasons, including lying to Congress.

@ThomasNovth 2/  While prosecutors dont need anyones permission (in general) its nice to have investigating agencies on board. Especially when you are dealing with 40+ counts of inappropriate behavior involving minors.
@ThomasNovth Actually they do. The FBI doesnt pass out plea deals so you are correct their. However when a prosecutor is giving out deals of this nature coupled with the fact he was an informant for the FBI they are going to be involved in the prosecutors plea deals.
@RevJJackson @SantitaJ @PatriotAM1150 @RealTalk910 35 is just right. Next time include a status quo option.

@SenBlumenthal and if you did research you would know NY state law prevents the state  from charging a person who was charged at the federal level or pardoned  at the federal level. NY state law sees it as double jeopardy.

@RickyRayinGA @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump If a judge says she a citizen then I agree completely.
@jaketapper So did Mueller. The excuse was he was an informant.
@jaketapper Ask Mueller. He signed off on the deal using the bs human source crap.
@RickyRayinGA @dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump A person has to be a US citizen for treason to apply. She is not a citizen as her dad was a Diplomat to the US when she was born.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump Birthright citizenship does NOT apply when your parent is a diplomat.
@michaeljknowles So I guess the part about justice being served only applied to the right. She deleted her tweet and has not commented on the change of events (that I have seen anyway).
@Thomas1774Paine Is Sanders even eligible to run as a Democrat? He returned to being an independent after the 2016 fiasco and the DNC, I thought, changed their bylaws to require a person to serve as a Dem for so many years in order to run for potus as a Democrat.
@politico The Dems / Left seem to forget the part where legislation must be signed by potus.  Joint resolution's / Concurrent resolutions dont mean shit and neither do bills passed by Congress if they arent signed into law.

@joshdcaplan He is a Democrat / leftist. Laws / Constitution doesnt apply to the left.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr You guys demand we listen to and act on science yet you reject science when it comes to 2 genders. You have no room to lecture anyone Chuck. Secondly your in the minority in the Senate so start acting like it.
@exfogcity @AhNahChedz @eorden and the crimes they are charged with are decades old and have nothing to do with Trump Russia collusion. You should have paid attention when Schiff kept claiming he had the smoking gun yet after all this time he never leaked it (like he / dems have on everything else).
@exfogcity @AhNahChedz @eorden Again point out any person who has been charged with collusion. They are charged with crimes unrelated to it and are from a time period before Trump ever ran for President.
@kalbzayn @AhNahChedz @eorden Trump has not committed any crimes.
@kalbzayn @AhNahChedz @eorden and Cohens charges arent related to Trump Russia collusion. Contrary to what you / left think a crime must occur before a person can be investigated. Toy cant investigate a person in search of a crime. You up to speed now or do we need to review the Constitution?
@RealSaavedra The use of the word lynching in all this smacks of a plan by Kamala Harris et al to pull this hoax to drum up support for her ignorance on lynching laws and to paint Trump / Supporters as racist homophones. The left once again proves they are what they claim to be against.
@exfogcity @AhNahChedz @eorden If you have to deny reality to get thru your day not only are you a democrat but a clinton sycophant. The OIG/Huber is almost done with their investigation into her. Lets see what happens.
@AhNahChedz @exfogcity @eorden The only ones full of shit are the deranged left. Clinton was a shitty candidate and broke the law. Even James Baker wanted her prosecuted and was overridden. My guess is you ignore it because it doesnt support your agenda. Hence the OIG/Huber investigation into it now.
@kalbzayn @AhNahChedz @eorden No where did I say Trump committed a crime. Stop seeing what you want and accept the facts that dont support your agenda.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump She is not even a US citizen.

@Mariesatwit @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump If people want to participate with a booth at a gun show they are required to perform the background checks, even when the law says they dont. Its a requirement imposed by the venues. Again, back to my statement that Kamala is reinventing the wheel.
@Mariesatwit @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Thats nice but doesnt address my point. Gun shows require the background checks, even when the law doesnt.
@exfogcity @AhNahChedz @eorden I do and she didnt cooperate. Evidence to date says the investigation was rigged so she was not prosecuted. Hence the OIG investigation and Hubers assignment.
@kalbzayn @AhNahChedz @eorden Something the left cant seem to grasp.
@kalbzayn @AhNahChedz @eorden I am saying the crimes you guys keep referring to have nothing to do with Trump Russia Collusion.. You know, the accusations you guys have been making since Clinton lost. The point is the crimes they committed arent even remotely related to Trump Russia collusion.

@KFaulders and the coup by Democrats continues...
@JackPosobiec She never had US citizenship. Her father was a diplomat. Secondly US citizenship for anyone other than a naturalized citizen cant have it revoked. They must willingly give it up.
@ROCKONOHIO @DaRealGrizzle @pinkk9lover @AppSame @LVNancy @Mjhall412 @buzzman888 @TheTrumpLady @ColoradoGirl2A @Trump454545 @baalter Shes not a US citizen.

@benjaminwittes This is the part the left cant seem to wrap their heads around.
@MichaelAvenatti Shouldnt you focus on staying out of prison for running a ponzi scheme?
@CarmeninSD @SpeakerPelosi @OversightDems @HouseIntel Why? Congress is oversight and not criminal investigation. Congress cant do shit but give referrals.
@SpeakerPelosi @OversightDems @HouseIntel Schiff MUST recuse himself after undisclosed meetings with Simpson. Or is it your position that a double standard is ok when it works in Democrats favor?
@paulsperry_ The Dems will use anything absent of a complete unredacted release as insufficient. It provides political cover for Dems to continue the investigation to find anything they can use against potus. Look at Cummings question focus for Cohen. Its all Trump related.
@MarkWarner The decision is up to the AG and not you. Dont like that then rewrite / change the law. Secondly all it will do is give the left / never trumpers ammo for the 2020 election cycle where they lie and since we cant see the entire report, morons will believe the lies.
Oh how I love it when idiots try to lecture on gun background checks, get called out for a blatant lie, only to then be blocked by them. The left either needs to educate itself on the laws or quit talking on the subject and going mental when you are wrong.
@AhNahChedz @eorden For crimes unrelated to Trump Russia collusion - yup. Why is the left so ignorant on facts? Is it because it doesnt support your agenda? I look forward to the same standards being applied to those on the left.
@eorden So the witch hunt continues...
@Mariesatwit @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Good idea.. Tel me how many gun show venues require the sales to include background checks. 		If your going to challenge the facts educate yourself on all of them first.
@meowmix67 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump person to person sales are it and only in some states.. As I said kamala is once again reinventing the wheel.
@RichardJDouglas @JackPosobiec She is not a US citizen so she has no legal standing. Her father was a diplomat when she was born.
@LeighHelberg @KamalaHarris @March4RLivesLA Tell us how.
@KamalaHarris How? Lay out your plan. You keep bitching on this topic but have offered nothing  to resolve it. Is that because the ultimate goal is gun confiscation and removal of the 2nd amendment? Are you to chicken shit to claim thats your goal?
@pcally19 @Breaking911 She snot a US citizen sop she cant hold office. Even though she was born in the US her father was a diplomat so automatic US citizenship is not granted in those cases.
@KamalaHarris Once again educate yourself on the state laws on this topic. They are years ahead of you on this reform.
@RyanAFournier Interesting the lynching word gets thrown around by the left at the same time Kamala Harris is trying to make it a federal law because apparently murder laws / hate crimes arent enough for her. Why is a black woman trying to keep race politics alive in the 21st century?
@RepAdamSchiff Yup.. and you have known those entities do that because conservatives / republicans have been on the ass end of that scandal for a while now.		BTW you need to comply with your own standard and recuse yourself from the Russia probe for your undisclosed meeting with Simpson.
@charliekirk11 Well some of those same people / entities participated in a coup and are still free so what do you think?
@oliverdarcy The media has done its fair share of attacking Trump, his supporters coupled with wingnuts like Waters and Holder calling for violence against anyone with a different opinion. The 1st amendment applies to all and not just people posing as journalists.
@AshaRangappa_ Actually he can just close investigations. The term you are looking for is prosecutorial discretion. Secondly Mueller / SC has leaked they were wrapping up their investigation. I guess your trying to help lay groundwork to discredit Mueller's investigation b/c it found nothing.
@zeusFanHouse Political retribution? What an ignorant ass. You got federal funds to build a high speed rail project you canceled. I am guessing the cancellation was done so they could use the federal funds on illegals or some other scam the CA gov. is running.
@Breaking911 Answering the question, once again, why Australia is an island continent.
@WalshFreedom Then either one of you need to explain how the start of the investigation was even lawful. A crime is required (just 1 requirement) for the SC. No crime occurred and the scope memo is classified. You want transparency but only if its politically beneficial. If its not u ignore it
@RepSwalwell Then either one of you need to explain how the start of the investigation was even lawful. A crime is required (just 1 requirement) for the SC. No crime occurred and the scope memo is classified. You want transparency but only if its politically beneficial. If its not u ignore it
@charliekirk11 He can consider his jail time as background research for the show he needs to be fired from.
@RyanAFournier Never mind the fact NY State is facing a 2 billion dollar short fall in their budget.. The left doesnt care about US citizens. They need a new voter block thats loyal to Dems and it appears illegal aliens are it. So they promise them "free" stuff to get their illegal vote.
@JackPosobiec Lets see how long it takes before the left attacks CPD and, if indicted, the grand jury members for being racist homophobes.
@KamalaHarris So is securing our border and preventing illegals from voting. Voter ID also helps secure our elections in addition to keeping clean up to date voter rolls. Ending ballot harvesting by 3rd parties is another one. Dems dont seem interested in that so you cant be taken seriously.
@RepSwalwell So you are setting the stage to dismiss Mueller's outcome so you can continue with the failed coup - check.
@RepAdamSchiff Why arent you recusing yourself from the Russia probe? You did the exact same thing Nunes did and you forced him to recuse himself pending the outcome of a 10 month investigation. Or are you demonstrating the fact you are a liar and have a double standard?
@KamalaHarris or the fact our intel community participated in a failed coup against Trump? Our intel community is no more believable than Democrats, which includes yourself. So spare us the lecture.		https://t.co/OvztePurMe
@KamalaHarris You mean like where Osama Bin Laden was at? Or the WMD's in Iraq? Or the fact the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led us into the Vietnam war was faked and never occurred. Or the attack that killed our Ambassador in Libya was from a spontaneous protest over a youtube video? 1/
@RepSwalwell @redsteeze @lyndseyfifield That they must be the idiots who voted for Ocasio-Cortez.
@meowmix67 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Actually it is. The only transaction not covered by federal law is person to person sales. State law picks up the slack in that area.
@Mariesatwit @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Try again.
@Kimmer4444 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The only background check that wasnt universal is person to person. Every other transactions requires a background check.
@RepAdamSchiff Apologizing now for what u and the others involved in the coup wont save you schiff.
@EdKrassen And? What's your point?
@AOC Blinders
@AOC Because we use a capitalist system and rightly so. How many jobs created? Effect on income tax collections for city state? Effect on local economy like merchants? You failed to see the big picture with your socialist blonders.
@thehill Secondly 1 trillion is a drop in the bucket on our national debt, which stands around 22 trillion dollars. Also politicians cant be trusted with that money. They would spend on on everything but paying down the national debt.
@thehill wtf... No.
@davereaboi She needs to be  arrest for supporting terrorists and for treason.
@washingtonpost I think for these types of trails there should be a mile / distance marker along the trail for incidents like this.
@EdKrassen This is yet another attempt by the left to seize control of the government in their coup.
@EdKrassen None and there was no obstruction by congress.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Yes, Federal Court in California, where the judges are liberal and legislate from the bench. His rallies arent toxic and to suggest they are is not only insulting to Trump but also to his supporters. Once again you prove your racism and hate while projecting it on others. Ironic.
@washingtonpost All the while the top 3 Democrats running Virginie still have jobs and Omar still has a seat on the foreign relations committee.		Psst... Democrats.. your hypocrisy and racism is showing.
@SenatorHassan Do Democrats know how to do anything but point out the obvious and talk about? We have known about these problems for a decade + and yet all Dems do is bitch but never seem interested in fixing it.
@JackPosobiec Let her return.. via US Marshals to stand trial for supporting terrorism and committing treason.
@charliekirk11 Then, if they still want socialism then they can move to Venezuela.
@charliekirk11 Socialist need to read the book Animal Farm. In Bernies mind he falls under the 'everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others".
@RealSaavedra and by indigenous people she is referring to undocumented democrats. If our elected officials cant represent the American people then they must be voted out of office / expelled from Congress for violating their oath.
@KamalaHarris and require voter ID and more stringent checks to prevent illegals from voting. Voter rolls must be cleaned up to prevent Democrats from being elected on the dead voters block they enjoy. No more ballot harvesting by 3rd parties. No more jungle primaries.
@tedlieu @nytimes @MattWhitaker46 @HouseJudiciary @realDonaldTrump All based on anonymous sources.. For all we know Ted you lied to the NYT to push the lie so you could jump on it when it was published. Name the sources.
@thecjpearson I would like the left to explain how we need to trust science on climate change but not trust science on their only being 2 genders.
@OversightDems @RepCummings Its nothing more than Elijah Cummings being an ignorant ass.
@OversightDems @RepCummings Secondly its no secret Saudi Arabia was going down this road and has been since the Obama admin. Specifically because of the Iran Nuke deal. Saudi Arabia has also received assistance on nukes and ballistic missiles from China. This story is nothing new.
@OversightDems @RepCummings Yup - as a result of Irans nuclear weapons program. Obama gave Iran the bomb. So Saudi Arabia cant defend itself?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Reinventing the wheel once again. Background checks are required and states already took action to plug a loophole for person-person sales. But by all means keep attacking the 2nd amendment.
@KamalaHarris How many illegal aliens attend US schools?
@abibascencio Hey look.. another ignorant racist attacking a person for their support of Trump.		The irony.
@AshaRangappa_ As the court stated the gag order only applies to the lawyers. She specifically said Stone can speak about anything he wants, including the case. The only caveat she placed was he could not comment on the case while on court grounds.
@KamalaHarris all the while you beg the federal government for money to pay for illegal aliens while ignoring wildfire prevention. CA wasted 3 billion on a high speed rail project that was canceled.		Can we have that money back please.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump If these people love socialism so much then maybe they should move to Venezuela...

@SethAbramson and if you paid attention you would see the gag order only applies to both sides lawyers but does not apply to Stone. As the judge stated Stone can talk all he wants but must remain off court property to do so.
@bradheath That would be because its true. The left engaged in a coup and failed. They must be held accountable.
@peterbakernyt and over all of those years the "press" never went after a sitting President like they have with Trump. The press started this whole thing and then got pissed because they forgot potus is protected by the very amendment the media hides behind to lie.

@TheJusticeDept Now get to work cleaning up the mess that is the DOJ/FBI and start prosecuting these people who attempted a coup against potus, Hillary Clinton, Comey, Brennen etc etc etc.
@AnnCoulter Actually Yes, he can.
@AriFleischer That's no better than telling Jews they must stand with Heinrich Himmler.
@RepAdamSchiff It is not bypassing Congress when potus is using the very law passed by Congress.
@BillOReilly How quickly we forget Dems spied on journalists. Never mind the fact they advocated to "license" journalists in order to silence outlets like Drudge report. The "media" brought this on themselves when they opted to lie instead of reporting facts.
@PersistenceTee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Signing the bill keeps the government open. He will declare a national emergency to build the wall. In this instance I believe Schumer and Pelosi got out-maneuvered. He will get $1.3 billion while Schumer/Pelosi maintained they wouldnt give 1 dollar. They did/Trump got wall.
@AdamSchiff Maybe you should read the Constitution considering Trump is using the very law Congress passed. Or are you once again ignoring facts that dont support your agenda?
@Utleyjacobite @mschlapp Try again Kamala and this time research before opening your mouth and being wrong.
@AshaRangappa_ @steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump Secondly the National Emergencies Act of 1974 also gives him the authority to do it. There are currently 31 national emergency declarations still in effect since 1979. Obama issued 11 and 9 are stil in effect. https://t.co/KLMpLonmY6
@AshaRangappa_ @steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump Congress passed the very law that authorizes potus to declare an emergency. If Congress doesn't like his interpretation of the law thats one thing (however it is the executive branches purview on that topic). Congress authorized = no end run around Congress.
@AshaRangappa_ @steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump The flaw in that argument is the government did know the 9/11 style was possible b/c hey have trained for it. Second its totality of circumstances. Are there 20k illegals on the way. I would say yes given what we have seen before on this very topic.
@FoxnewsTV @AshaRangappa_ @steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump Sure and if you set ignorance aside you need to see what the actual law says and whats defined in it. 		Feel free to research it.		We'll wait.
@Utleyjacobite @mschlapp and yet you ignore it. Rosenstein also committed perjury when he cl;aimed to congress it was a conversation at only one meeting.		So who is the liar then? 		McCabe or Rosenstein or both.
@AshaRangappa_ @steve_vladeck @realDonaldTrump It's not and end run around Congress when potus is using the very law Congress passed. Last I checked declaration of a national emergency is not defined and is at the President discretion.
@Utleyjacobite @mschlapp So you didnt understand what McCabe said - check.		Ignoring the facts doesnt mean they go away.
@NBCNews undermine the  role of Congress? Congress is the one who created the very law Trump is using.
@Utleyjacobite @mschlapp Treason. He conspired with other former top officials to illegally remove a duly elected President. Or did you ignore McCabes statements?		What they did is treason and a coup.
@brianstelter and there was no "hunch" for the raid on Stone. CNN was tipped off.
@SenBlumenthal Stop lying.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump "Lawless act" is the new talking point from Democrats.  Declaring a national emergency would be lawful. We know this because Obama used the same law during his presidency. Surprise surprise Dems didnt give a shit then.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump and yet completely lawful.
@Barnes_Law and yet he is correct.
RT @MZHemingway: Perhaps now would be a good time for Republicans and others in Senate/House who allegedly care about rule of law to finall…
@mschlapp Only if its to drop him off at prison.
@JacobAWohl Pelosi already said she wont remove Omar but did force her to apologize, once again showing their hypocrisy.
@RealSaavedra Of course it is.. Newsweek and Omar.. They are both liars.
@Breaking911 Nope
@tedlieu While Dems exploit the situation for political agendas while ignoring the fact the FBI/BCSO failed to do their job when the suspect was reported time after time after time. Given BC is a Dem stronghold maybe you should reflect on Dems failures to protect these kids.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Exactly... Federal workers should be doing their jobs to support the country during their work hours.
@Jim_Jordan and when are these people going to be prosecuted for their treasonous crimes?
@EdKrassen @KamalaHarris or how the GOP had to pass modern legislation for / to protect minorities for voting rights. Or how Democrats assassinated President's Lincoln / Kennedy - D.		Had it not been for the GOP Democrats would still be treating blacks like it was the 1800's, slavery and all. https://t.co/yqre2peNfb
@EdKrassen @KamalaHarris You mean when Democrats were lynching blacks and fighting to protect slavery while the GOP wanted to end it? Or when Democrats/ Dem states seceded from the Union / causing a civil war to keep slavery intact? Or when the GOP passed laws protecting blacks/native Americans 1/
@KamalaHarris Thats b/c it is a state crime in all 50 states. For wanting to end racism you sure do go out of your way to put race into everything you complain about. Maybe, if you stopped complaining, you would see the laws are already on the books. Do your job and stop reinventing the wheel.
@Jim_Jordan @RepCummings Compelled to testify? The son of a bitch needs to be arrested and prosecuted for treason.
@NoahShachtman Finally 1.5 million people were required to be removed from LA County voting rolls b/c CA refused to keep legally required updated rolls (old rolls made voter fraud easier). Texas found 55+ thousand illegals voted in their elections over the years, Yet Dems say no fraud exists.
@NoahShachtman It should be understood that how elections are held is the purview of the states and not federal government per the Constitution. So my question is why haven't state governments gotten off their asses to do something? Why must we always rely on the federal government? 2/2
@NoahShachtman Wow are Democrats hypocrites. Trump tried several times to do this and  blue states blocked him at every point. Hence the reason an identity fraud task force was created and supervised by DHS. We need voter ID and strong border security. Since Dems like to lie 1/2
@KamalaHarris Stop exploiting their deaths for your own political agenda. Had the FBI/BCSO done there job when they got the warnings, multiple warnings I might add, this would not have occurred. It was a failure of government from top to bottom.		For some reason though you ignore the truth.
@ChrisMurphyCT You mean becoming law --- again.  		Maybe this time around Democrats can stop lying about the background checks that are already in place and required.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP and Democrats in the Senate are going to get a vote on the insane new green deal your new member of the House put forward then lied about.
@JacobAWohl Apparently their engineers didnt stay at a Holiday Inn Express the night before.
@swimjohn2199 @mitchellvii @AOC She cant run for President. She doesnt meet the age requirement.
@RepAdamSchiff and yet still no charges relating to Trump/Russia/Collusion.
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary Still exploiting dead children for your own political agenda I see.
@KamalaHarris We are $20+ TRILLION dollars in debt. Yet all you and Democrats want to do is spend spend spend. Increase taxes so you can spend. Nothing is free and what we have that is, is paid for by the American people. Please stop destroying this country.
@axios Good.. Now we can apply the same to the plea deals / immunity deals the DOJ passed out like candy on Halloween to Clinton and her co-conspirators.
@NickBaumann If she is going to lie about her past I can only imagine what else she has lied about since then.
@dcexaminer Then sanctions, like the one in place during the cold war, needs to be reintroduced.
@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump and yet your the one who married her brother and made antisemitic remarks while supporting the terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah while being funded by the terror group CAIR. You, of all people, have no room to talk. Lying about Trump also doesnt help.
@GOPChairwoman I wonder of the failure of those and other networks to cover the results is their way of invoking their 5th amendment rights against self-incrimination?
@TheDCVince It's Menedez.. He went off on Fox News for reporting on the Democrats junket to Puerto Rico with lobbyists and donors with photos of him on the beach during the shutdown. He said they should not have reported on the trip.		This is the left which makes you wonder who voted for em.
@tonyposnanski @brianstelter @mkraju @IlhanMN Hypocrite
@brianstelter @IlhanMN You just cant call out a Democrat who is anti Semitic. You have to drag Republicans into it. She made the statements. Make her own them like you would if she were a Republican and stop running interference for the hate from the left, hypocrite.

@krassenstein @JohnBrennan He had surgery and the SSCI agreed to the delay. Maybe get all the facts before speaking.
@JohnBrennan Charges against people involved would also mean you.

@AriMelber Besides it took Obama 8 years to make a mess of his legacy and it took Trump a few years to undo it.
@AriMelber If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.

@DracoThings @Newsweek He is not required to release them nor is it required to run for President. As I said, Waters must have a valid reason for issuing a subpoena for them. No legal reason = court will quash the subpoena (and rightfully so).
@stephanscheuss @Newsweek If you think Mueller has not seen them then you are as deranged as Waters. Tax returns arent required to run for President and she must have a lawful reason to obtain them.

@RepSwalwell Then publicly condemn Omars anti-semitic comments.
@Newsweek Secondly thanks for proving that Democrats use any illegal act they can to do this while ignoring their own. Like Waters steering 12 million in tarp funds to her husbands bank. She was charged with 3 ethics violations that seem to have disappeared. 2 tier dems above thee law bs.
@Newsweek God she is an idiot and needs to be expelled from Congress. You cant issue a subpoena for restricted tax files just because. You need a reason and Russia doesnt qualify. Absent that I look forward to any subpoena you issue on this topic being quashed by a judge.1/2

@Heminator @derekwillis @CBSPolitics Fair enough.		Respectfully though would it not be appropriate to delete the tweet with a follow up tweet on the mistake? Leaving the post intact is coming across shady and smacks of an attempt to cause an issue when its already been dealt with.		Just my 2 cents.
@derekwillis @Heminator @CBSPolitics Not so much the members but the process itself.  Let me rephrase though - Any sitting member of Congress on the ethics committee dealing with accusations would be a conflict of interest. Either by friendship, political affiliation, personal bias etc etc etc.
@derekwillis @Heminator @CBSPolitics I think we all have done that however I am always skeptical when its come to people posting articles that deal with specific politicians that are old. To me it seems like an attempt manufacture outrage. Even more so when they post the info but fail to comment / add context.

@AshaRangappa_ Funny.. the left didnt seem to give a shit with regards to Kavanaugh and how far back the loony left went. Once again you demonstrate hypocrisy.
@HuffPostPol Then that must be why Obama and Clinton flooded Syria with weapons.
@KTHopkins I would hope, whomever your sovereign is at that point, would exercise their right to dissolve parliament and replace the government that is constituted with the consent and request of the sovereign so it never gets that far.
@KTHopkins Hopefully the UK will never see that day however, should it appear on the horizon, I quote Thomas Jefferson.		"I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing,  and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
@studentoflife08 @DoubleNW @CNN Read up on exactly what she did. The moment he was killing himself she should have stooped him and not encouraged him. She failed to call 911 or anyone else. Read exact;y what she did.
@DoubleNW @CNN When the bf was in the process of killing himself they were on the phone. He stopped and said he was scared and she ordered him back to kill himself. She bragged to a friend what was occurring. In this instance she belongs in prison. She knew what she was doing.

@Kevin5740Arnold @TheDemocrats Yup.. Have a good day.
@AsOneWeOvercome @Coll1313 @MSNBC Bush and Cheney didnt put us in Syria, Libya or Yemen.. Democrats did in fact vote to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. 		Anything else your clueless on that we can correct for you?
@MSNBC and those same poll takers said Clinton had a 98% chance of winning the Presidency in 2016.
@Kevin5740Arnold @TheDemocrats Apparently you didnt because you thought less than 60 votes were needed in the Senate. If you knew the requirements you would not have asked a stupid question. 		Have a good day.
@JFKucinich If an official survives and comes before the DS then that person is sworn in and not the DS.  If I remember its something like  (used to be) St. Dapliacle (sp) Secretary of State, Treasury, Defense etc etc etc.
@JFKucinich The DS is not acting anything. They hold their title and should something go massively wrong then the COG is activated and the designated individual is acting until sworn in by a federal judge. This is for potus only. Not sure about Congress/Judicial COG. 1/
@Acosta You and the left are so fixated on hating Trump and putting illegal aliens before US Citizens you throw common sense out the window and then constantly bitch about everything. Also a wall has been in the ocean in San Diego for decades.
@AsOneWeOvercome @Coll1313 @MSNBC Intel comes from many sources and not just military ones. In the end though the decision is, as Commander in Chief, the Presidents. I am surprised Obama fanatics have issues with this given how many times Obama ignored his military advisors.
@AsOneWeOvercome @Coll1313 @MSNBC The same reason any officer or noncom can make a decision without consulting those under his command. Consultation is nice but not always an option. Why do Democrats want to stay in these wars with no end in sight? Their hatred of Trump is destroying this country.
@Kevin5740Arnold @TheDemocrats Because genius the Senate requires 60 votes to pass legislation. The  change to 51 applies only to appointment confirmations. You would have  needed about 10 Democrats to vote in favor of a border wall bill and  Schumer wont allow it. Anything else I can educate you on?
@MarkHertling @dougayoung I just find it difficult to say Flag Officer ranks arent based, in part, on politics and political view points of the officers in question. With that said I will defer to your expert position. No disrespect intended.

@drawandstrike than he discusses and thats based on the DIA issue for Flynn.  It is also possible the AAG is just keeping an eye on hings until a new AG can be confirmed. Maybe that is what is meant by Mueller wrapping up. Being shut down by the new AG.
@drawandstrike Being the AAG is overseeing the Russia probe he should have known how/why the extension was needed for a SCGJ when its supposedly due to wrap up. I guess the question becomes what time frame(weeks/months/years) "wrap up" actually means. Grasssley knows a lot more than 1/
@drawandstrike I am of the mindset the left wants Mueller to investigate the bullshit into the 2020 elections and if Trump wins they will want it continued until 2024. They are using our own government to undermine our own government.

@TeamPelosi You are not leadership either.	- You represent illegals over US citizens.	- You jump thru hoops to get illegals money/housing/healthcare.	- You dont care when an illegal kills a citizen	-You say walls dont work yet live behind one.	- You are a traitor.

@mar1f70 @KTHopkins car markings are entering into the realm of impersonating a police officer. In the US we use Federal, State and local laws. We do NOT use any religious laws, whether its Muslim, Jewish or Christian. The 1st amendment protects freedom of religion as well as expression, 2/

@brianstelter @KatiePavlich @hogangidley45 Chuck/Nancy promised negotiations after gov is open. Pelosi promised the SOTU when govt is open. The bill is for 3 weeks. At the end Chuck/Nancy are going to demonstrate that they are nothing more than liars intent on protecting illegals.
@tonyschwartz If your head gets any larger you are going to be mistaken as a fugitive from Easter Island.
@Movietime77 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He wont see it. It goes to the DOJ.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Mueller already has and no collusion exists. Secondly if your going to  open that can of worms prepare for the same on you from the Senate.
@JohnBrennan I look forward to your perp walk Brennan.
@JackPosobiec It is not based on the Federal body of law.		2/2
@JackPosobiec Sadly he is correct. Impeachment is a power reserved solely to both houses of Congress, which means it falls under the political question doctrine. Supreme Court has already ruled on this, requiring courts to stay out of it. High crimes/misdemeanors are whatever Congress says. 1/

@RealJamesWoods Faith in humanity - restored.
@POTUS 	   Chuck and Nancy will not learn. They wont fund a wall so the Dems will shut the government down in 3 weeks - again. Pelosi wont allow the SOTU. In 3 weeks people supporting Democrats need to reflect on what their Democrat leadership just did. They just lied.
@POTUS Thank you for reopening the govt for 3 weeks. During this time we will see if Chuck/Nancy will be true to their promise to negotiate and hold the SOTU. If they fail in 3 weeks close the government and declare a national emergency. Call Congress into session till fixed.

@haaretzcom and since you missed it the government of SA said sometime back that if Irans ballistic / nuclear programs arent reigned in they would start their own to counter.
@RealSaavedra Chuck and Nancy didnt learn. They wont fund a wall so the Dems wil shut the government down in 3 weeks - again. Pelosi wont allow the SOTU. In 3 weeks people supporting Democrts need to reflect on what their Democrat leadership just did. They just lied.
@tedlieu Still not capable of telling the truth eh Ted.... No collusion exists. If it did Stone would have been charged with it. 		Has he been charged with collusion Ted? We will wait for a retraction from you or you providing evidence and charges of collusion.
@AshaRangappa_ Still no collusion.
@SputnikNewsUS The more alarming part is the fact it is true. Given the number of media clips russian media ran attacking Ukraine while using video footage from earlier wars is a perfect example. When the USSR collapsed I had high hopes for Russian civilians. Thats been wasted by Putin.
@NBCNews No he reopened the government and gave Democrats 3 weeks to either comply or shut down the government and expose themselves as the liars they are. Schumer already said no wall and Pelosi is saying quietly no SOTU. Think about that.
@KateHydeNY It was way over the top - plain and simple.
@RJC She needs to be expelled from Congress before she gets someone killed with her support of terrorism.
@jtrujillo109 @Q2K90 @KatiePavlich @benshapiro @POTUS Congress cant declare a national emergency, let alone only one house of Congress. Dont liberals bother with educating themselves or do you just repeat what you're told by your masters?
@KatiePavlich As we knew would happen. Dems wil once again, in 3 weeks time, shut the government down again while proving to the American people that they are liars and that their words cant be trusted.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nothing and Muellers indictments prove that fact. Clinton and Democrats on the other hand, conspired with Russia/Ukraine/UK/Australia/NZ to effect a coup that failed. 		Tic Tok nancy,..
@charliekirk11 It's only a matter of time before California falls off the edge of the point of no return for being a failed state.
@charliekirk11 Because any restrictions on illegal aliens, whether from voting or entering the US, is viewed as voter disenfranchisement by Democrats. The illegal vote is the Democrats leading voter block. Look what illegals gave to Democrats - California, a super majority, Governor. 1/2
@BuckSexton Muller / DOJ / FBI desperately needed something to distract away form their illegal acts. Notice how Ohr / Bakers testimony that the DOJ//FBI knew about where the dossier came from. No longer being discussed now.
@dbongino Not true. Plenty of collusion between the media, Democrats and Russia / Ukraine / UK / Australia and New Zealand exist.
@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She wont allow potus to give his SOTU.		Just watch. She and Chuck arent going to comply with their responsibilities to reopen government. In 3 weeks Dems wil shut the government down again. At that point the Goc should remain shut down until Dems start protecting Americans.
@jimsciutto and?
@MSNBC It is a start. Now the left wing media needs to do the same.
@RBReich ATC should be aware of August 5, 1981. Playing the game you are is dangerous.
@bennyjohnson Because a funding bill in the Senate needs 60 votes to pass. Democrats weren't going to give it to them. Next time brush up on requirements in government before making  a claim thats not supported by facts.

@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Did he? Think about it. He called Pelosis bluff. The government is open for only 3 weeks. Plenty of time for her and Chuck to negotiate on the wall. Dems have 3 weeks to figure it out or they shut the government down - again. Dems claimed they would negotiate after 1/2
@jonathanvswan No - he called her bluff. The government is open for only 3 weeks. Plenty of time for Pelosi / Schumer to nego2tiate on a border wall. If it doesnt happen Dems wil close the government in 3 weeks.
@SpeakerPelosi For 3 weeks. You left that out of your victory lap. Now that the government is reopen get off your ass and find a solution to the border wall. 		Again - you have 3 weeks before another shutdown.

@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Ok.. you are to stupid to continue debating with you on this topic. Ill rely on my education, training and experience in this area. You feel free to use your opinion and be wrong.		All info you require has been provided. Next step is to accept the fact you are wrong.		Later
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis I did. I pointed you to the US code for immigration laws. Dreamers are not claiming asylum / refugee status. DACA gives them the 2 year exemption on deportation.		Maybe read instead of running your mouth and going in circles with an argument that already been debunked.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Dont try and use examples that are off base and not rooted in actual law. Your opinion does not trump law.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Actually its not.  Contrary to what is portrayed by the media all states have laws that give the discretion to the officer and not the Mayor. Officers get qualified immunity and not the mayor. Finally LEO's are required to ignore illegal orders.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis It is and the ruling by the liberal courts proved that by ordering a stop to the administration and to restore DACA.  DACA spells out who is eligible  and who is not. It prevents deportation for 2 years. Trump ended the EO and yet they are still protected.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis It means immigration laws allow for the AG to issue exemptions based on actual law and NOT on executive orders. Since dreamers are not claiming asylum / refugee status they are present illegally and subject to deportation. DACA violates immigration law.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Immigration law does not allow what the EO did and since the EO only targets children brought into the US illegally it is restricted to just those individuals. A specific group who are protected from deportation.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Again - read and comprehend -		"...individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S."
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Because the EO Obama issued is illegal/unconstitutional. She tried to reenter as an illegal alien. Had she not gone to Mexico she is protected. The moment she left she was no longer protected.		Again, you arent stupid so stop acting like you are.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Except when the law in question prohibits it. The sections you are referring to are case by case basis and only for specific reasons laid out in immigration law.		Educate yourself -	https://t.co/CLw8WmmP40
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis It does mean what I know it means. You cant accept it because it destroys your position. Willful ignorance on your part doesnt invalidate the facts or current immigration law.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis and since no law exists for dreamers an EO cannot create law / modify law to create DACA. Hence it being illegal / unconstitutional.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Except under DACA it is. As I have pointed out top you 2 times now. My guess is you are ignoring it because it doesnt support your position.  Dreamers are "protected" for 2 years from deportation and granted work permits. Again, what part are you not understanding?
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis They were deported because they tried to reenter the US and were not a lawful citizen nor alien resident. 		Again you are proving my point.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Since you ignroed it, here it is again -		"...individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S."		What part confuses you?
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis At the appeals level and only because scotus had 8 judges instead of 9. Anytime a 4/4 split occurs the last ruling stands until a full court is available. A request for review by scotus is submitted, reviewed and they decide if they will reconsider the case.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Point out in immigration law where it says dreamers can not be deported for 2 years because of their status as dreamers. Next show me in immigration law that specifically uses the term dreamer and conveys on them exemptions from the law on deportations.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis and as I have explained to you the EO prohibits deportations for 2 years and grants temporary work visas.  Now, show me in immigration law that allows for that. Spoiler alert - Immigration law does not allow for it.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis The udges ruled as if the EO were a law and not an EO. Just like we see with liberal judges on the left coast and federal district / appeals courts.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis The liberal judges ruled against the administration. At the time Scotus had 8 judges (Scalia died). When scotus ruled the court was split 4-4. When that happens the lower court ruling is what we use. Now that we have a full scotus the case will be pushed back to scotus.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis In violation of existing immigration law, which does not allow for delayed deportations.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Immigration law is clear on being in the US illegally. Obamas EO protected "dreamers" illegally. His EO can NOT add items to a law that the law already prohibits. The EO gives protected status tO "DREAMERS". This is not a hard concept to understand. His EO changed the law.
RT @BuckSexton: A lot of people-including many journalists- owe this kid from Covington High School an apology.		They owe all those student…
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Obama issued the EO. President Trump ended it. Because an EO was used to create the illegal policy a following President can end the EO. Obama tried to unilaterally change their status with the protection from deportation.  Ending it restored the law w/ deportations.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Yes it does -	"...individuals who were brought to the United States illegally as children to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit in the U.S."
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis Because the Legislative branch is constitutionally required to draft and send legislation to potus for his signature. Its also required to change existing law. DACA changes the law by EO, skipping the legislative branch.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis It did change the law, as I pointed out. Current immigration law says no path for citizenship. DACA delays their deportations. Since immigration law says they are to be deported and DACA gives them protected status, DACA is in fact illegal / unconstitutional.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis DACA is unconstitutional. It provides deferred treatment of kids brought to the country illegally. The fact there is no pathway to citizenship included is your clue.The EO shields them from deportation. Congress failed to draft legislation. Hence they are here illegally.
@whatisyouranswr @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @StevenTDennis and yet it still shows why DACA is illegal.  An EO cant changer existing immigration law chief. Again thanks for proving my point.

@MarkG623 @SBlackula @HorizonUnltd @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Migrant, as the media keeps referring to them as, is a person who voluntarily leaves their home country. Economic reasons arent recognized for asylum / refugee status. Neither is domestic abuse. If you want to use the asylum road then do it correctly.
@MarkG623 @SBlackula @HorizonUnltd @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Not when they enter and fail to apply for asylum. When they are coached on what to do and say its not a valid asylum request. Secondly Asylum is not a guaranteed right and any nation can reject the request. Finally the term migrant is not a protected classification. 1/

@HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Upheld in the state of CA and 9th circuit. DAPA was ruled unconstitutional by the 5th Cir in LA.

@HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis If it did we would not be having the government shutdown over illegal aliens coming into this country.  DAPA is unconstitutional. DACA, which is what DAPA was based on, is also unconstitutional. Secondly it was never a law but an EO. An EO lawfully ended by the President.
@HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis They were brought to this country illegally and did nothing since becoming an adult to fix that situation.. Their presence in the US is in fact a violation of US law.  You need to learn how the law works and stop substituting your personal ignorance for the actual law.
@inhartsnkiss @StevenTDennis DACA kids, who are now adults and have been for years, did nothing to correct their illegal presence in the US.
@inhartsnkiss @StevenTDennis I love when people ignore the point when they cant refute the argument nor support their position. Like you for instance.
@SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis No they arent. If they were trying they would have started the process when they turned 18. They didnt.  This mess is courtesy of Obama and his unconstitutional EO on DACA (DAPA was already struck down as unconstitutional). Dems open borders is also a part of this mess.

@Evildoer_Esq @StevenTDennis Yes, a high court misdemeanor can carry the same punishment as a Felony, which by definition is more than one year in prison. A misdemeanor is less than a year except for a high court misdemeanor. Anything else I can correct you on or are you ok with your willful ignorance.
@Evildoer_Esq @StevenTDennis And in both examples I gave, that you cant comprehend, deals with benefiting from the illegal acts of your parents. BTW if your parents brought you along you would be punished because you would be removed from your parents custody and care. Learn the law before mouthing off.
@MarkG623 @HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis I doubt it but you keep making comments you cant back up. For being a Vet you sure are backwards on this topic. Or did your oath mean nothing when you took it? My oath means something and for a good reason.
@inhartsnkiss @StevenTDennis If you took the 500k and kept quiet for decades yes. If you didnt take the money but knew they robbed a bank and kept quiet for decades yes. If you are knowingly violating US immigration law then yes.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Then dont come to the US with a plan to break US law.

@HorizonUnltd @SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Gee I dont know. Lets see what my career in law enforcement in 2 states say.
@SBlackula @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis and I think you didnt read or understand / comprehend my post so maybe try again.
@Lynn_Rose1 @whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Robbing a bank is a felony. Identity theft can be a felony.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis If you want to come to the US then do it lawfully. Plain and simple.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Actually it does. You cant benefit from a crime - plain and simple. If you cant understand that then that would be your issue. The law is clear.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Not at all. I just dont believe non citizens should be abler to benefit from breaking US immigration laws intentionally.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis and again it doesnt matter. The child should not be able to benefit from the crime of their parents. Continually getting caught in the US illegally can make it a felony.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis If you had your bank robbed and the robbers gave 500k of your cash to their child you would want it back. Secondly it is also illegal to profit from a crime committed by someone else.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Immigration law is administrative. Infractions, misdemeanors and felonies are criminal infractions. Contrary to what you think they are not the same thing.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Speeding tickets are infractions and are not administrative. Also certain speeds increase it to a misdemeanor and if you flee law enforcement it can be a felony.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis Being in the US illegally is a violation of immigration law. A child should not benefit from the crimes of the parents.
@whatisyouranswr @StevenTDennis My description the kid didnt rob shit either. The parents did and gave the uninvolved child 500k. That child should not be able to benefit from the crimes of the parents.

@RealMattCouch My question is - why was this info leaked if true? It seems to me to be strategic and meant to distract.

@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Your reference is the case of General William Belknap. He resigned however the House went ahead and impeached however the Senate acquitted him.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed As a matter of fact any person eligible for impeachment in the Federal system can be impeached. Even after they left office. No time restrictions exist.
@charliekirk11 Yeah it would need 60 votes in the Senate and Democrats would not vote for it.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Only if we also impeach Obama and Clinton and charge everyone in those circles with the crimes they committed.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Thats because the government, as reported by CNN, was not the same Cohen. But again way to lie to your followers by inserting the debunked Prague claim.
@merehut @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed As reported with the info coming from anonymous sources. Repeating the same line of what they have while ignoring where it came from is problematic. If the info is a nail in the coffin then why leak it now instead of prosecuting?
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed The double standard bullshit needs to end.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Here is my issue on that topic. Would pro Obama or pro Clinton people support their impeachment in the same circumstances? I believe in Supremacy of Law and equal application of the law. I would not support impeachment if the left wouldnt support it for their own.
@cafunk @happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed I didnt vote for Trump. My trepidation comes from being in law enforcement and understanding how investigations work and whats required.

@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed from an ongoing criminal investigation. That fact is also why I dont trust these sources completely. To me its a ploy by the left to keep the SC going into the 2020 election cycle. Everything has leaked about the SC except for evidence trump did what he is accused of doing.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed I agree. However I exception to the way the info is reported and I have serious concerns about the left immediately moving into the impeachment bullshit before doing anything to verify the info. The anon sources, if info is true, also broke the law by disclosing info 1/2
@cafunk @happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed The left hates Trump so much they are more than happy to run with incorrect info so long as it hurts Trump.
@cafunk @happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed The issue with them doing their best is the media has consistently ran anti Trump articles that have turned out to be untrue / skewed / omitting context etc etc. Just like we saw with Cohen the last time when media ran with a story that never occurred nor involved Trump.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Especially when the 2 anonymous sources broke the law in an ongoing criminal investigation by releasing the info (if true). I dont think you comprehend the legal problems that creates for an investigation.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Again those points have nothing to do with the anonymous sources. Trying to falsely claim the info is right simply because known people report on it does, in fact, not make the info true.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS For a meeting that never occurred and no money ever changing hands with cohen and russia. Way to ignore previous facts when they dont support this latest bullshit.
@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed and those same anonymous sources have been wrong. Secondly stop trying to move the goal post. Your argument got called out and you are still trying to shift around it.		Anonymous sources are just that and the people reporting it have no clue if the info is correct or not.
RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: Top Obama Lawyer Made False Statements to DOJ... https://t.co/OrdScpmAha
@EricHolder and the 2 anonymous law enforcement sources should be terminated and prosecuted, if true, for leaking restricted information about an ongoing investigation.

@happyassowl @RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed Of which is being reported by 2 anonymous sources. What part of that confuses you? The info you listed came from the anonymous sources (on the off chance your still having issues understanding it).
@JRubinBlogger Not even close but you keep pushing those lies.
@RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed It also taught me to verify info completely when it comes from a person facing prison time. Contrary to what the left thinks people will lie to get themselves out of trouble. Cohen did this under oath so he already has credibility issues.
@RBK_Green @JoaquinCastrotx @BuzzFeed I didnt vote for Trump so you would be wrong.  However my law enforcement background, experience and education tells me how investigations work and the problems with anonymous sources. So before you attack someone find out who they are / what they are about before lipping off.

@BernardKerik Wouldnt it be easier to just say they are spying on Americans for colluding with Russia to get the Mayor to shut up?
@MrSparkleJoinMe @SaraCarterDC @tedlieu Democrat Ted Lieu says otherwise. Other dems said it was for refueling only.  All ignored Egypt. If Pelosi wants a photo op then she can pay her own way. She is worth more than 100 million dollars.		So the liars would be Dems and you.

@SaraCarterDC and people like @tedlieu are already lying when they discuss it. He left out the trip to Brussels and Egypt and then used the troops in Afghanistan as the only reason for the trip. It is sad and pathetic when Dems not only lie, but exploit the US military for their own agenda.
@tedlieu @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump What part of White House approval confuses you? Do you bother to get the facts for anything you bitch about?		Brussels and Egypt are NOT war zones (2 of the stops). Afghanistan is however a photo op for Dems in a war zone is problematic for many reasons.
@SenBlumenthal It is NOT a constitutional right. Read the constitution for once would ya.
@honig_liz @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Everything I am seeing says she disinvited him from giving it. If she requested he postpone thats one thing. If she disinvited him then it means she canceled it. Potus has to be invited by the Speaker to give the SOTU. If she disinvited him he cant give the speech.
@MikeDelMoro No you are not.
@AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi trip from DC to San Francisco without having to land and refuel.		None of which has anything to do with her trip to Europe,  Africa and Asia.
@AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi She canceled the SOTU and got caught lying about it. If she is going to play politics with the government shutdown then she should not be taking another vacation on the tax payers dollar.

@SenBlumenthal Democrats really have issues when it comes to laws and how you demand they be ignored when it doesnt suit your agenda. Barr pointed this out. Apparently you ignored it.
@TheViKingDebate @paulsperry_ @steph93065 28 CFR 600 is the DOJ internal regulation.  The actual law lapsed in 1999 and was not renewed over constitutional problems with it. During the issue with Bill Clinton a judge chimed in noting the law was probably;y unconstitutional however an internal policy would work.
@paulsperry_ Someone should point out to NBC that the President is the chief law enforcement officer of the US and not the AG.
@RealMattCouch Once again Obama's policies hurt Americans.
@jbsmith22 @donnabrazile All states allow that except for New York state, where its considered double jeopardy. The other 49 fall under the doctrine of separate sovereigns.
@donnabrazile Putting New York state on a list to watch during elections. This early voting, ballot harvesting , jungle primaries and Democrats in favor of non citizens / illegals to vote.. More Democrat vote rigging is on the rise.

@leslieturneraz @esaagar Its not since the quote given by Saagar ignores the second part of his response. He is open to states being able to decriminalize it. The part he selected led into his statement Congress needs to decide if we need one federal law or allow the states to decide / remove federal law
@esaagar Any reason you ignored the other part of that response which says Congress needs to decide to have 1 federal law or allow the states to make their own laws. Pick one and stop the selective enforcement based on federal law and state law.		He is open to both.

@chrislhayes Immigrants are NOT guaranteed entrance - That is a privilege. Dems bend over backwards to bring in illegals, which is linked to the effort on the left to do away with the electoral college. Dems only care about power and a wall is seen as voter disenfranchisement.
@Acosta Illegal aliens and if you enter the country illegally it is, in fact, a crime.
@tedlieu @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump Considering Democrats care more about illegal aliens / foreign citizens than US citizens and are unwilling to do anything but ignore US citizens a declaration is needed to build the wall.

@blkirisherri2 @billingsgazette BIA police, in some areas, are spread so think they can be dispatched to calls 200 miles away (I saw this in Oklahoma). While the FBI has some jurisdiction generally speaking the only time they get directly involved is when something happens on tribal land dealing w/ a non indian
@blkirisherri2 @billingsgazette As for more info Congress has oversight so all they need to do is pick up a phone and get the info they want. As for public inquiries I can see no info coming based on your info. It sounds like a jurisdictional / lead agency problem coupled with inadequate resources.
@blkirisherri2 @billingsgazette I have only had 1 encounter with BIA police when one of my investigations came across the name of a suspect responsible for breaking into a bunch of vehicles at an Indian owned casino. It took a few days to get an officer to call me back and they seemed uninterested in the info.

@NateOnTheHill Then Democrats should never have supported the law that gave potus the authority to do just that.
@JackPosobiec https://t.co/ASMZoTVNmK
@jimsciutto Assad using chemical weapons is a red line - President Obama.
@ChadPergram Yeah declaring a national emergency, which democrats have said he has the authority to do it, is not grounds for impeachment. To be clear a coup will not be tolerated.

@canible_kitty @yerch @RealTimBlack Also - her actions did not meet the requirements for use of deadly force. Hence the reason she was charged. Never mind the fact she lied to law enforcement until finally admitting what actually happened.
@canible_kitty @yerch @RealTimBlack Also I am, not defending a pedophile. The fact you even attempted that bullshit excuse is beneath you. Pretending she is a victim while ignoring her criminal involvement is disgusting however and demonstrates a complete lack of objectivity from you.

@LyamLovett @dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Guns are inanimate objects and cannot kill anyone. The same holds true for knives, swords, bats, alcohol or a motor vehicle or airplane. It requires human manipulation. An airplane can kill more people faster than a person with a firearm.
@nun07328099 @AshaRangappa_ Try again.. A national popular vote is nowhere in the Constitution. So no its not a fact that she won something that doesnt exist. Trump got more electoral college votes which is why Clinton lost.
@LyamLovett @dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews I said with other criteria. A person who kills 3 people is not automatically classified as a serial killer.		I raised the issue because of the 3 stabbed in the UK I linked you to. Is that considered a mass stabbing?
@LyamLovett @dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Hence the reason I raised the issue of the require criteria to designate it as a mass shooting. Just as a serial killer in the US is partially defined by killing 3 or more people.

@amjoyshow @MichaelSteele and the current facts says he is lying and you are repeating that lie.

@RepSwalwell Whats sad is also using the incident for a political agenda. Its a good thing California's tough gun laws worked.

@franksskintags @ZHollowayy @SkyNews If they did you would see a lot of shootings reported are done so incorrectly by the media, especially when its ruled justified.
@franksskintags @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Secondly people in the US and UK dont seem to understand how homicide designation works.  Any person who is killed - lawfully / unlawfully / executed by the state - is listed as a homicide. The justification on those homicide conclusions is the part people need to look at.
@franksskintags @ZHollowayy @SkyNews In the US the first person at any crime scene starts with the suspect. The second is the victim. Contrary to what the left lies about law enforcement is almost always the last to respond. The first line of defense starts with the person who is targeted by criminals.
@LyamLovett @dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews https://t.co/i4J9FImKih
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle Not one indictment for Trump/Russia/Collusion/hacking elections.
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Its from your own source -		https://t.co/FVJCHHzAo1
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle 3rd an indictment is NOT guilt. Only a court of law, via judge or jury, can say if a person is guilty. Absent that everyone is innocent of everything they are charged with nationwide until a court of law, and not public opinion, says so.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle Mississippi vs. Johnson for starters.	2nd - assuming sealed indictments are for Potus is inaccurate since it could be argued sealed indictments are for Clinton / Obama etc. There are active investigations into a lot of Democrats linked to obama and clinton.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle I am acutely aware there are bad LEO's for the very reason you just provided. With that said the 1st amendment protects the media, Potus and LEO's. With that said no LEO's should investigate a person in search of a crime. It is illegal and unconstitutional.
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews and as I said they occurred in gun free zones.
@Ryans_Girl_xx @ZHollowayy @SkyNews One other thing - You need to take into account the difference between US law and UK law in terms of what the definition of a minor and adult are and what age is used.
@ZHollowayy @Ryans_Girl_xx @SkyNews So when your argument gets refuted you go for a personal attack and implore people not to listen / think on their own.		How typical.
@Ryans_Girl_xx @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Also trying to downplay UK stats by claiming its gang related is a bull shit and you know it. The issue in Torrance involved to large groups of people involved in a massive brawl. 		So it must be treated with the same standard you just tried to use.
@Ryans_Girl_xx @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Facts are your friend -		https://t.co/gWVfReTlDM
@Ryans_Girl_xx @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Not at all. However you seemed to have missed my comment that's schools / colleges are gun free zones. Just as is most if not all of the UK.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle Not one indictment / guilty plea has anything to do with Trump/Russia/Collusion.  It would help if the left actually read the indictments instead of repeating the lies of the left wing msm.		Read -	https://t.co/xhvOx7iCEc
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews You posted it. Provide your source. If you cant then it means you just threw up a map with red circles and lied in relati0on to what they represent.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle Considering  its not against the law to speak ones mind it has no impact on me / law enforcement. What did have an impact was Obama / his admin blaming law enforcement for everything. Speaking ones mind applies to al, including LEO's who dont like him - see CA for examples.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews So you excuse the death count in London by saying it was one more than NYC. Dont make comparison if you cant argue them logically.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews Comments were made about knife crime so its only fair to point out the flaw in that argument. Secondly Las Vegas is no where near Torrance California so explain again how your not being hypocritical?
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Then cite your source / link to it for the map you put up.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews Guns, nor knives, kill anyone. It requires a person with sinister intent to manipulate those items in order to end someones life. Cigarettes kill 400+k in the US yearly but we are concerned about guns being used in places they shouldn't for actions that are illegal already.
@avdrst @Uniguy96 @NBCNews It seems the only ones who want to violate our laws and drain resources are illegals from down south.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews https://t.co/7UfA5j4epa
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews Yup - look up each one and where they occurred.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle I refer you back to my previous statement.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle No - however my decade plus in law enforcement and my education allows me to understand the requirements of the law and whats required to start an investigation and what level is needed to establish probable cause.		Any other questions?
@Ryans_Girl_xx @ZHollowayy @SkyNews How is it possible for London to have a higher murder rate than NYC?
@Jason_Berube @MrDuh2u @IngrahamAngle Fair enough.. Al one has to do is look at how much Democrats in Congress / potus are worth to come to that conclusion. Hint - It needs to be condemned on both sides and not just against people who you hate.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews You made the claim on knife violence. Just pointing out your mistake.
@ZHollowayy @SkyNews As I already pointed out these shootings occur in gun free zones.
@Jason_Berube @IngrahamAngle Considering the IRS has not filed charges the answer is yes. You guys need to get it thru your heads that IRS tax disclosure is not a requirement to run for President. With out PC you have nothing. You need a crime to investigate a person and not a person in search of a crime.
@ZHollowayy @dannyjcascarino @SkyNews Really? No massacre with knives?		https://t.co/jHRjuNZZi9
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews and had the event not banned firearms the death count might have been a lot lower. Has it never occurred to you that mass shootings occur in gun free zones in the US?		As for your knife comment - 	https://t.co/jHRjuNZZi9
@IngrahamAngle I cant see Pelosi or Feinstein, who are worth more than 100 million dollars, reacting to paying their "fair share".
@ZHollowayy @SkyNews Yet accurate. If you are going to go after the US and its Constitution then you open the door to be educated on the topic sir as well as having your own laws put front and center.
@dannyjcascarino @ZHollowayy @SkyNews So you are saying strict knife control is next in the UK? Oh, wait, its already started.		For help understanding the purpose of the US 2nd amendment I refer you back to your Royal Family.
@dbongino When our government uses it as a slush-fund.....
@ZHollowayy @SkyNews lol. still hypocritical. Given the UK's gun laws explain why you need armed police.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Given your ignorance by claiming you would just use an old Senate bill to reopen the government you have no room to lecture. 2/2
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Democrats shut the government down before for placing illegal aliens over that of US citizens an u did it again during the Holidays. You seem to forget the House needs the Senate to pass bills and potus to sign them into law. 1/2
@RepAdamSchiff You seem to forget the President is the Commander in Chief of our armed forces. Trump has more experience leading US military forces than you ever will.
@SpeakerPelosi If CA is any indication of what you plan then you need to resign immediately.
@KrobinJr @thehill Hence the reason for wall funding. You cant spend funds that are designated. Besides the more the left makes the claim you just did the more hypocritical they look.		Case in point -	https://t.co/g3flci7UAP
@greaves46 @davidfrum Says the person calling for Trumps resignation based solely on your own ignorance and TDS. You have failed to support your psition and not liking someone is not grounds for resignation nor impeachment. The sooner you get Clinton was a shitty candidate the soonr you'll understand.
@KrobinJr @thehill Actually its not. It has already been stated that if the House sends over legislation that Trump said he wont sign then McConnell wont wast the time by having a vote. Provide wall funding and reopen the government.
@thehill The Schumer / Pelosi should include funding for a wall. A wall that both are on record as supporting under Obama.
@RepLoisFrankel @HouseDemocrats So they are going to release all the names of the representatives who used the tax payer funded slush fund to pay of harassment victims? We want a complete list - all names (dont care about party affiliations) and amounts and number of payouts.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Oh come now guys and gals. You made it thru 8 years of Obamas propaganda.  If you can get thru that a little bit of truth from Trump wont hurt you.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @GOP The dow dropped when Dems regained power. Trump was elected President in part on building a wall. That is something you have to accept since you are so fond of pointing out what people voted for. Dems need to fund the wall and stop putting  illegals over US citizens.
@JamesOKeefeIII How about we go after all corrupt elected officials regardless of party and then keep the pressure on to ensure criminal violations are investigated and charges issued. If they fail that then investigate why they are covering up crimes.
@chuckwoolery Democrats are going to secure our southern border by moving the southern US border up to the Canadian border.

@GoodbodyStanley @thehill No luck is needed. Like I said, read the constitution.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill what documents are republicans withholding.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill What documents are republicans withholding?
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill What documents are Republicans withholding? You made the claim now support it.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill Our Constitution also says he is innocent. You need to read it.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill What documents are being withheld?
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill Well he is innocent under our system of law until a judge or jury says otherwise. Secondly its incumbent on the prosecution to make his case and not for the person the SC is investigating.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill He wont. He is holding down the fort until the new AG is confirmed in the coming weeks.		Congress trying to restrict what can be done to the SC is a violation of separation of powers.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill The original "law" (dealing with Bil Clinton) was assigned by Congress and not the DOJ. The constitutionality of that appointment was front and center and the law was not renewed because it violated the constitution separation of powers.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill US Judge Amy Jackson had to deal with the issue before his 2nd trial (now a moot point). The SC can be fired by the AG/DAG at any point an works at their pleasure. DOJ policies are used and the SC is assigned to the executive branch and not the legislative.
@CNNSitRoom @tedlieu Got to admire his hypocritical irony.
@RepJoeKennedy and yet Democrats have voted against many laws that protect US citizens  from illegal aliens. Democrats dont serve US citizens. You guys serve  illegal aliens.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill Familiarize yourself with the concept of separation of powers.
@GoodbodyStanley @thehill So you dont understand it then - check.

@SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow Mississippi vs Johnson says otherwise.
@wolfblitzer Huh.. Trump only has 8 trillion++  more to go to catch up with Obama.
@ChrisVanHollen @chrislhayes include funding for the wall so democrats can show they value US citizens lives over that of illegal aliens and we can reopen the government.

@greaves46 @davidfrum No they wouldn't be forced to resign. Not liking potus doesn't meet any requirements for removal from office. If it worked that way Obama would have been out after year 2.
@greaves46 @davidfrum When Trump comes off Marine 1 and salutes the Marines with a coffee drink in his right hand then you have room to bitch. Until then check the hypocrisy at the door.
@davidfrum While the left is actively pushing Russian propaganda with the trump Russia collusion bs. Russia doesnt need to attack the US. Democrats hate Trump so much they have no issues doing Putins dirty work for him.
@mkraju Yeah Democrats are going to be all over that issue considering they would lose upwards of 20+ seats if illegal aliens arent counted.

@Hashtag_MAGA I said it before and I'll say it again. Any attempt to remove Trump from office will be seen as a coup and wont be tolerated.
@Hashtag_MAGA If a President does something that would qualify removal under the 25th then we move forward. However not liking a persons policies, political affiliation,  opinions etc are not qualifiers under the 25th.
@Hashtag_MAGA Well the left is using it to effect a coup to remove Trump. With that said only a mental health expert can make determinations on a persons mental health. As I said the constitution has 2 requirements. You cant add more unless you amend the constitution.
@Hashtag_MAGA Being on that drug does not disqualify a person from running for president. The ONLY things that make a person ineligible is if they are not a natural born citizen and have not yet achieved the age of 35. Im not a fan of hers but at least get the facts right.

@chrislhayes You mean like constantly drawing red lines and then not doing shit when those red lines arent enforced? Save us your bitching on this topic since you failed to act when it was Obama.

@DLoesch have an idea of how the mental health laws work in the US. As always do your due diligence and check your individual state laws for more detailed info on this topic.		Even people w/ mental health issue have a presumption of innocence and are covered by due process.
@DLoesch If the person voluntarily complies with medical and no threats are made then the persons psyche history is protected as medical confidentiality.		Each state will vary so make sure to check your state laws for more specific info.  The info I provided is an overview so people
@DLoesch remain in custody. The ONLY exception to this is if the patient makes comments that threaten specific individuals / groups with physical violence / death. Then the info cant be reported as an exemption. If a person is held involuntarily it becomes a part of their record.
@DLoesch psyche medication. After so many days the psyche staff is required to file updates with the court. If the patient is to be held for a longer duration (21 days in my state) a court hearing is required and the psyche staff is required to prove their case on why the person should
@DLoesch If he/she is kept against their will the psyche staff is required to notify a court of jurisdiction that a person is being involuntarily held. At this point the person is given their civil equivalent to Miranda warning. They have a right to a lawyer and have a right to refuse
@DLoesch Unless a person is brought in and kept against his/her will by medical psyche staff (in my state its called a 96 hour hold - in CA the law is 5150) the persons psyche history is protected by patient/doctor confidentiality. Release of the info would be a HIPAA violation. 1//2
@RealMattCouch So I say start charging these government officials at the state local levels as co-conspirators every time an illegal alien kills a US citizen or violate US/State/Local laws.
@RealMattCouch the federal government cannot force state / local law enforcement to  enforce federal law / do the job of federal law enforcement. Immigration would fall under that category. Immigration law is defined as administrative by scotus and not criminal. 2/2
@RealMattCouch There is no federal law banning sanctuary cities so there is no federal law to enforce. You could argue the states in question are in a state of rebellion / insurrection for assisting illegal aliens, using federal immigration law. You have to get past the fact 1/2

@SenFeinstein Can you show us your letter you sent in wanting an investigation into the deaths of 18 people in CBP custody under Obama.		Thanks.
@showlady102 @drawandstrike @Breaking911 and yet it was CNN who said cohen to prague trip never occurred.
@Dewey2000 @mayawiley Then name one Democrat who spoke out against it during obama. My point was the hypocrisy demonstrated by the left. You guys always try to deflect while ignoring the issue raised.		Work on that.
@KamalaHarris Yup - the latest death occurred because the father declined medical treatment for his daughter. To bad Democrats dont care for the US citizens murdered by illegals.
@bjay1121 @LittleWashita https://t.co/ZQTcgCvBoa
@NateOnTheHill Why? The 2nd death was a direct result of the father refusing medical treatment for his child.
@drawandstrike @Breaking911 https://t.co/ZQTcgCvBoa
@bjay1121 @LittleWashita Then explain why he has not been charged with anything related to passports. 		Real or fake, a passport still has to be stamped. Secondly all US passports have control numbers to verify they are real.
@Breaking911 How many times does this need to be debunked before the left stops repeating it?
@LittleWashita Yup however there is no passport stamp showing he ever left the US nor the EU. Even if he flew into a non Schengen country and entered he would still be required to have it stamped upon entering the EU. Its already been confirmed he was not the Cohen who visited Europe.

@SenBooker Stop with the lies.
@CNN FAKE NEWS once again from CNN. It was not a campaign event.
@Starjennjenn @mayawiley It is true and ignoring facts that dont support your position doesnt invalidate the facts. It invalidates your argument.
@bigleaguepol Yeah because the Secret Service is going to allow POTUS to just up and randomly fly into a war zone with no advance notice or planning. The left is out of touch.
@Starjennjenn @mayawiley Never mind the fact in this latest case it was the father who denied medical treatment for his child.
@Starjennjenn @mayawiley and you are the one who dismissed what occurred under obama while trying to argue its different under Trump. A death is a death regardless of age or citizenship status. Try to argue its bad if kids die but ok if its an adult then there is an issue you need to resolve.
@ChadPergram and Democrats agreed to 25 billion with DACA inclusion and 40 billion from the gang of 8 proposal. 		Was not good enough for Democrats.
@KlasfeldReports and that ruling just violated a US Supreme Court decision denying bail/bond to illegal aliens.		https://t.co/YafDAyJi44
@ArthurSchwartz If the economy tanks will Obama still lie about who did it?
@tedlieu Still not a crime in the Federal body of law (criminal).
@1Komatoes @mayawiley You bet.
@smithwilliamtro @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump and which one of those passports is stamped with the date and time / port of entry in the EU?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The US and EU have passenger sharing agreements. The US says this michael cohen was not in Prague along with EU information. Even if he entered thru a non EU country he would still have to show passsport to enter / leave. The left is desperate and is recycling debunked info.

@attackerman @arawnsley @thedailybeast It is not a Trump thing. If you read the Flores ruling you would see its required. A licensed agency is required to be used when housing minors. Since several scotus rulings further defined no bail for illegals space was needed.
@PardesSeleh A lawyer with the ACLU, back in the mid 90's, was refused an apartment because of his political affiliation. His complaint was rejected because the law does not include political affiliation.
@hardy9_t @PardesSeleh @sarahecorda Respectfully can you point out where it does? I cant find it.		https://t.co/vv6sisvVln
@1Komatoes @mayawiley Yet true.
@mayawiley It already was established the Cohen in Prague was someone other than the one the left desperately wants it to be.
@mayawiley and yet there is no record of it. The US and EU have a info sharing agreement when it comes to flights between those entities. Had Cohen been there the US AND the EU would have records. If Cohen tried to enter using a non EU country there, again, would be records.
@jra_jr53 @mayawiley No it makes you hypocritical. All you have to do is look at the positions Democrats have held on the issue. Like many Democrats wanting a border wall under Obama, Immigration law changes, border security only to opposer those very things because its Trump.
@1Komatoes @mayawiley An example of the hypocrisy would be your post. You ignore the law and go for the opinion when the law doesn't support your position.
@1Komatoes @mayawiley It is not my fault if you cant separate law from opinion. If Democrats would stop breaking the law and lying every time they open their mouth by timeline would look different. However, since Democrats cant seem to understand the difference they must be corrected.
@ColenaColena @mayawiley The death of the second child was because the parent refused medical assistance. NOT CBP but the parents.		Again the parent should be charged with multiple felonies.
@ColenaColena @mayawiley 2 Children have died due to the carelessness of their parents dragging them thru the desert on a thousand mile trek with the intention of breaking US law. Under US domestic law the parents should be charged with multiple felonies.
@JileneThomas @mayawiley and im sick of you hypocrites with Trump Derangement Syndrome. We use Federal law and not your personal opinion on morals character and their is a very good reason why. Law applies equally and is defined universally. Your opinion does not. Educate yourself on the difference.
@kyrakaz @LawFoundationSV Yet Trump has been in compliance with Flores and Immigration law when it comes to minors, including the most recent rulings by scotus.		The point is the hypocrisy on the left. https://t.co/ZVrqH9oj98
@InformantGuard @mayawiley Thank you for proving my point regarding how hypocritical the left is.
@Starjennjenn @mayawiley She does deserve the reply since she is being hypocritical. For further evidence of that look at your response. Once again you try to make a difference between Trump and Obama yet they both did the same thing.
@mayawiley Separating families was a result of Flores and occurred under Obama as well. There never was a Muslim ban, regardless of how many times the left repeats that lie. Trying to use the sense of decency argument is nothing more than the left being hypocritical.
@Fleacatt @Newsweek Take your counter argument you just made as an example of what I pointed out. You can start by explaining how your not political when you have resist in your name.
@Fleacatt @Newsweek Not at all. I am just sick and tired of the left playing these hypocritical games. If it happens under Trump its bad. If it happened under Obama its A - ignored 	B - downplayed		Dems are the ones who pushed open borders. Dems represent illegal aliens over that of US citizens.
@Fleacatt @Newsweek Also you seemed to have ignored this as well.		Intentional or an oversight?		https://t.co/hOHDSvJzhK
@Fleacatt @Newsweek Actually it is. They were illegal aliens in CBP custody who also died. Or is it your contention their lives dont matter because they are minors? Or are you trying to ignore those deaths because they interfere with the current push by the left to exploit the deaths of minors?

@RedWavePaige Cool - I would love to see ICE / US Marshal's / FBI / etc then going in and start arresting these officials for violation of US immigration laws.		https://t.co/7unjYUaBqx
@Acosta @CNNSitRoom As opposed to supporting Obamas "they are the JV team"....
@chrislhayes and how many times are you going to keep claiming this?
@HoneyWest25 @RepRatcliffe Typical bullshit...
@PoliticalShort https://t.co/PZmc9MEXLg
@chrislhayes would be for Democrats to start doing their jobs by representing US citizens and stop placing illegal aliens over them. Dems wont give 5 billion for the wall but will give 5 billion to Mexico and 5 billion more to central america.
@christinawilkie Democrats created the shutdown crisis when Pelosi said she will leave the government shut down forever before funding a wall. Ironically they had no issues giving mexico almost 5 billion and central america 5 billion.		Only way to get our reps to do their job is to be a foreigner
@SenKamalaHarris Nothing more than a political stunt. Its been illegal under federal and state laws for decades.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It was to defeat ISIS. The organization that Obama / Clinton created, funded and supplied with weapons.		Also known as the JV team by Obama.. 		You know, when this was occurring you didnt do shit to stop it.

@gatewaypundit They are more concerned in representing other citizens than their own.
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh uhm... sure.
@CharlesAlbon @BernardKerik @GenFlynn Actually he didnt and the judge walked back his treason comment.
@GinaHaspell1 Works for me...		The left however thinks disarming the population would stop gun crime. It didnt in England and it didnt in Australia.		Both countries tout their gun control yet have armed police. The irony.

@RealSaavedra @BrianKarem They were drowned out by Acosta crying.
@Newsweek and seeing the health problems caused from being a Vegan is a good bet we al wont be vegans anytime soon.
@1168_845 @CNNPolitics Apparently people dont know the FBI violated protocols and law when they interviewed Flynn.
@CNNPolitics Even Comey admitted they broke protocol.
@kylegriffin1 Who was the reporter?
@Reuters Of course they are. Certain political parties love to exploit death and tragedy to push a political agenda. Religious houses of worship are gun free zones. Its illegal to kill another person. Just what law do they think would have prevented this.
@pbump Sanders is doing her job. I wish the same could be said about the press corp, who seem more concerned with playing gotcha on live tv.
@SenBlumenthal Sentence delayed with a status report due in March 2019. The judge walked back his treason comment and he smacked down the SC over the logan act bs.
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Can you point  out where a federal prosecutor has charged Flynns son?		Those threats stopped when fled decided to take the SC deal.
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh His comments to  the SC on the logan act was one. His verification questions to flynn about how they arrived at the present position. Over the length of the case he admonished the SC for repeated delays in sentencing. His order to produce documents also supports that irritation.
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Notice the date all this occurred. 2015 -		https://t.co/3DDfS8Sd0r
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Or if Flynn answered the questions the judge asked honestly. The issue oi coercion has come up several times before regarding the threats on Flynns son.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh He walked back the treason commenting. Stop distorting and omitting information.		The only troll is you. You keep coming back to me and commenting.		The irony...
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh He walked back the treason comment. If we infer based on questions asked then it can go either way. He has serious issues with the SC and the way they are doing things.
@TexasLumpy @aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Not really.. I have seen it happen before.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh So you know why the judge was upset?		Love the hypocrisy.
@donnacarrwest Got it from coverage.		What ever works for you.
@JacobAWohl Sector 001.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Thats the coercion complaint.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh So you should stop lying / distorting what others say.
@aarrrgggghhhhh3 @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Well he never said that. He pointed out that he was not bound by the no jail time recommendation.
@donnacarrwest Apparently you do because the SC brought up the logan act. Walked back the treason comment because it had no application.		Hang in there though youll eventually get it.
@TenaciousE5 @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Glad you find it funny when you lie.
@Jschmuck2 @TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Apologies.. FARA violation. Your smarter than that so tone it back.
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and 2 of his associates were charged for a FARA violation. The SC already stated he provided substantial assistance in other cases. Hence the reason for no jail time per the SC.
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Not being charged for a FAA violation and going with lying to the FBI. IUts already been stated by the SC of "substantial assistance" in other cases. Part of his plea deal.
@donnacarrwest @joshtpm Yup - The judge delayed sentencing with a status update in March. The judge walked back his treason comment. The judge smacked down the SC on talk of a logan act violation.		Thanks though.
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The other charge was failing to register as a foreign agent (FARA). A stronger sentence than lying to the FBI.
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup - They plead not guilty so what relevance would it have in flynns case?  Also its possible Flynn assisted in those cases for the government.
@TenaciousE5 @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Shake it all you want. You made a false allegation and I asked you if thats what I said. It was not what I said.		Stop making shit up.
@TenaciousE5 @DrRocketScience @TheBigFoxx @Popehat @LukeAtomic @JudgmentAbounds Yup - Ill go with the update from the judge.
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh They plead not guilty and last I checked that info cant be raised in Flynns case.
@TenaciousE5 @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh I never said it did did I?
@TexasLumpy @JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh yeah just came across my feed.
@JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @elizahecht @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh lol no hes not. Flynn is still actively assisting in other cases.		Stop making shit up.
@TenaciousE5 @DrRocketScience @TheBigFoxx @Popehat @LukeAtomic @JudgmentAbounds Right - Flynn sentencing has been delayed with a status update set for March. The judge just walked back his treason comment and he smacked down the SC over the Logan act talk.
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Sentencing delayed with a status update in march. The judge walked back his treason comment and smacked down the SC over the logan act talk.
@TenaciousE5 @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh His sentencing has been delayed with a status update in March. The judge walked back his treason comment and smacked the SC over the logan act suggestion as a non starter.
@KingTuttski Yup - he just delayed sentencing and scheduled a status update in March. The judge walked back his treason comment and smacked the SC over thew logan act talk as a non starter.
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yeah, hence the reason he clarified his treason comment and walked it back. He also smacked the SC over the logan act violation and its a non starter.		As I said its not over with yet. Next status hearing is in March.
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Way to follow the entire conversation. 		Flynn case delayed. Judge walked back his treason comment. Should be fun.
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Sentence delayed. Judge walked back his treason comment.
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Judge just walked back his treason comment,.
@augustus_divus @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Judge just walked back his treason comment.
@JRubinBlogger @PaulBegala Judge also clarified his treason comment. Its not how you portrayed it.

@augustus_divus @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Flynns sentencing just got delayed.

@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Right... his sentencing just got delayed. Any reason you cant take it for what it is and stop acting like a bitch?
@dcman Flynns sentencing just got delayed.		File the hahaha tweet for a little longer.
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup - Flynns sentencing just got delayed.

@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup - btw sentencing was just delayed in Flynns case.
@DebSkblu @cellinoatt @CharlesAlbon @BernardKerik @GenFlynn Sure.. yoiu got a link to your claim please.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh You dont understand though and that is the problem.
@TexasLumpy @elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Federal judges are appointed and not elected. So can you clarify your vote for unqualified people comment please.
@TexasLumpy @elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Flynn can be found guilty however it doesnt exonerate the special counsel or his tactics.
@TexasLumpy @elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and? I can still disagree with him. You do understand how our legal system works right? Its based on an adversarial system. The most persuasive argument backed by evidence / examples etc usually comes out ahead. This is no different.
@augustus_divus @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup already addressed a few times.		again whats next?
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Thanks for proving my point. Dont treat me like shit and I wont treat you like shit.

@SethAbramson Treason requires a US citizen to assist a foreign entity we are at war with to the detriment of our nation. It also requires 2 witnesses to have witnessed the treason.  Stick with FARA.

@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @TexasLumpy @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Actually it doesnt.		Anything else?
@cellinoatt @CharlesAlbon @BernardKerik @GenFlynn While I agree with you the people we are dealing with are anti Trump so we are only wasting our time tilting at that particular windmill.

@TheBigFoxx @Popehat @LukeAtomic @JudgmentAbounds Already addressed that mistake princess.

@rotorglow @m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Actually im not done. 		Anything else?
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh There is no exit. I did admit I was wrong. Again given how people are tweeting at me you probably didnt see it.		But by all means keep making accusations that were already addressed.
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Not really but whatever works.
@mdj6248 @JudgmentAbounds @GrimSavior @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I don't mind be wrong. Its how we learn. Again I dont know you people and i really dont care why your "laughing" at me. I didnt exaggerate anything. That was done by you guys.
@howardcord @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh That is what happened.
@KingTuttski Already did and with updates. you should read it.
@augustus_divus @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Obviously it wont be nullified.		Next?
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and?   You act like they cant be wrong or shouldn't be challenged.
@rotorglow @m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I didnt spend a lot of time making that statement. I made it twice.	you showed me and i apologized.		Whats next?
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Thanks princess.
@mdj6248 @JudgmentAbounds @GrimSavior @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and what you seem to not comprehend is I dont care your making fun of me. Why would I?
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Dear diary...
@howardcord @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No, I am following it. As I stated Shredding the constitution to obtain a guilty plea / verdict is a non starter with me.
@rotorglow @m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and if the ruling went the other way would we see people claiming the judge was wrong.  your point?
@VirtualTal @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Then you are all set then.
@LukeAtomic @TheBigFoxx @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh yup
@Wrighteous_86 Your issue might be with blocking users. If you block someone any tweets in your timeline should show tweet not available.
@Wrighteous_86 @TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No I am not deleting anything.
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I never claimed I was a legal expert or scholar. I gave my background.		I can disagree with the judge just as others have done in this tweet storm. Had the judge chucked the case the argument would be reversed with people not agreeing with the judges action.
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Still have not walked any of my statements back. and its not over.
@Wrighteous_86 @NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh If you saw the number of replies and post notifications on my side yesterday you would understand why it continued. There were so many cross post conversations it wasnt even funny. I couldnt keep up with all the tweets coming in and could not respond to all.
@howardcord @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh There you go.		Apologies.		Why would I need to pin it? I made my case and still stand by it. Would you prefer something different?
@Wrighteous_86 @NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh I deleted no posts. I stated I was in law enforcement. 		??
@LukeAtomic @TheBigFoxx @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh post the tweet.
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh HEY ASSHAT. Show me where I said it would be nullified. Had you read the discussion it was discussing a possible course of action by the judge. As I said you guys distort like no other. Search my tweets and show me where I said it would be nullified.
@wolfpac_five @webmarc @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Sure thing.
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh as I said show me where the judge said the FBI did nothing wrong.		No, I am going to take the facts and reach a conclusion based on my knowledge and experience.  I wont back away from that. I believe the DOJ/FBI violated the law and procedures. I still believe that.
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I haven't walked anything back and I made no prediction. 		Feel free to search my tweets and show me where I did.
@howardcord @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I made no prediction. Search the tweets.
@Wrighteous_86 @NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Nice try. I did not delete any posts. Stop lying.		I assured no one. I made my argument and people found issues with it. Then they distort what I said, just as you just did.,
@LukeAtomic @TheBigFoxx @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Probably because it got buried under the bull shit attacks people resorted to, losing it in the fodder. There are multiple posts explaining why points. People opted to distort it.
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Shredding the Constitution and disregarding policy in order to obtain a guilty plea / verdict is a non starter with me. Its not a slippery slope argument. Its a slippery sheer cliff argument.
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The judge has not said that that I am aware of. Flynn took responsibility for the lie. His lawyers raised the issues regarding the special counsel.Did Flynn break the law? He says he did. However the way the FBI got to that point is questionable. 1/2
@LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Then use it and post it.
@Wrighteous_86 @NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Why?
@JudgmentAbounds @mdj6248 @GrimSavior @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup.. and I dont care your making fun of me.		Anything else?
@TheBigFoxx @LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh What part confused you?
@TexasLumpy @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I already stated yesterday I had no issues if I were wrong. Doesnt mean I have to agree with the outcome though.
@JudgmentAbounds @mdj6248 @GrimSavior @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh wtf are you talking about
@JudgmentAbounds @mdj6248 @GrimSavior @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Actual misconduct has occurred but not just Flynn.
@LukeAtomic @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I made no such statement that he would get off. I argued he "SHOULD" get off based on the violations by the FBI and SC. You guys have a hard time telling the truth and resort to distortion.

@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh lol and I have other defense lawyers tell me I am correct.  We will see what happens tomorrow when the Judge rules.
@mdj6248 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Gee I wonder why.
@Real_JoeNathan @seanhecht @Popehat @EffLooch @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock actually :D
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh What part of english is throwing you in the section I highlighted? You dont have to be MAGA to understand this. Just a basic understanding of the English language.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No it means they didnt address the issue in question and thats confirmed when they denied the governments request to rule on it. They allowed it by saying its for another court to decide if it happens again. That means its valid for a district judge to do it again.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh law enforcement.		You?
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Dont need to. It supports what I said. This appeals circuit didnt address the issue. They left it for another court if and when it happens again.		Read then comprehend what you are reading. Not sure what part is confusing you.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh In this case it is how it works. Judge Sullivan ordered Mueller to turn over all exculpatory evidence as required by Brady. The Judge most likely believes Flynn plead guilty for a reason other than guilt. It stems from FBI telling Flynn he didnt need a lawyer.

@paulsperry_ https://t.co/cjBjt7wkTO
@webmarc @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Its called a mistake with auto correct that I since fixed.
@NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Considering original 302's weren't turned over I dont grant your premise.
@NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Being in law enforcement I know how it works. It also tells me you arent familiar with any of it and are arguing just to argue.		The Supreme Court established the legal guidelines so go yell at them.
@ChristophSouza @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Willful ignorance is your choice. Have a good one.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Thanks for the link. I guess we wait and see what happens tomorrow.
@JudgmentAbounds @NotPeoriaMayor @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Funny - that was never taught in my academy class. What was taught was how Miranda works and the requirements on its use and application.		I will continue to use legal requirements and supreme court rulings on how Miranda works and applies.		You can do whatever you want.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yeah it also applies to Criminal cases.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Its a required procedure in court and stems from Marbury vs. Madison. It occurs during the discovery phase.		https://t.co/0Zb0IvvkbC https://t.co/nblcOUzWcA
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and a further search and understanding the topic would show we are dealing with a criminal case and not civil. Judges overseeing criminal cases can in fact dismiss charges with prejudice. Just as judges overseeing civil cases can.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Nope - read https://t.co/TXhG0HOTYU
@JudgmentAbounds @NotPeoriaMayor @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Ive already answered this issue. When its done under false pretense and the original 302's / agents say he was not lying only to have a new 302 7 months later contradicting the first its very much relevant. Totality of circumstance and intent is looked at.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No - this is what it says. https://t.co/Ljtfyo5ReR
@NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh It does. 		Any action taken that would lead a reasonable person to believe they are not free to leave. This includes hand cuffs / other forms of physical restraint or any other action that would lead a reasonable person to believe they are not free to walk away.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Flynn's team last week filed a motion with the court to force the SC do disclose all 302's. This occurred when it hit the media 302's were altered, with one being back dated 7 months. Sullivan order that and he als ordered all docu dealing with Flynn, including dearts/notes etc.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh B - Sua sponte no. I have seen, as I stated,  a judge throw a case out over brady violations. They are not the same thing.		Sua Sponte is where a judge uses his own authority to act without a formal motion by either party.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh 7 months later another 302 was taken that says he did lie. The previous 302's fall under discovery per Brady. Anything that can show evidence in favor of the defense is required to be turned over.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh A - the documents demonstrate an inconsistency with policy/procedure, contains contradicting info by the FBI/DOJ, shows they were going to interrogate flynn but opted not to warn him of his rights. The original 302/agent testimony was Flynn did not lie. 1/2
@ChristophSouza @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh and being peppered with guilt seeking questions.		It is the law.
@ChristophSouza @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Actually it is. A person is not required to be in handcuffs in order for them to be in custody. Custody means a person has their freedom of movement restricted. Does a person reasonably believe they are not free to walk away. That can include being followed around by LEOS 1/
@NotPeoriaMayor @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @Popehat @AlanDersh Incorrect. The legal definition of custody is restring ones free movement. It can be more than justy handcuffs. Any action taken that would lead a reasonable person to believe they are not free to walk away. That can include constantly following the person around.

@howardcord @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh https://t.co/aIgFWfYhuK
@Gwatson0008 @RichSeviora @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yup - already stated this. My post was in response to another users comments / question.		As I was saying a judge can throw the case out, even plea deals ,when the government (prosecutors) act in bad faith / violate the law / violate court procedures etc.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yes - Judge made a comment about my background and I answered.		Move on.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh is acting in bad faith its up to the judge to address it. Given prosecutorial misconduct will affect the accused its the judge responsibility to ensure a fair trial.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh explaining to you what exculpatory means and who determines it since what you stated is incorrect.		I have seen it happen before (its called a Brady violation).		The judge does not need a defense motion to hold either side accountable for their actions. If the government 1/2
@donnacarrwest Since you seem to be unaware - https://t.co/PVLTeKq6ed
@donnacarrwest No I will stand by it. The documents released show the DOJ/FBI/SC are caught in several lies. It shows they violated a court order / brady violation.		As I said we will find out tomorrow.
@FadeDaPublic @Popehat @EffLooch @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I would say people with 34 followers and an incomplete profile while jumping into a conversation they know nothing about and have nothing of substance to contribute.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Not really. I love debating people. For me it allows me to recognizes some of my own shortcomings and to improve on them. It forces me to research others people position and gain more knowledge. 		As I said a 1000 notifications ago - we will find out tomorrow.		Good day.
@BeatCane @Popehat @EffLooch @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Feel free to refute my position with facts supporting your claim.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and you couldn't figure it out when a simple look would show you the person who asked the question.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh After seeing the explanation the next step would be for you to understand it to help your position in this discussion. Thats assuming you are more interested in learning than choosing willful ignorance simply because you dont like someone elses view point.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Exculpatory in the legal realm means any information (written / interviewed/taped / notes that contain any info information that could assist the accused. Relevance is determined by the defense and not the prosecution.		It is a requirement under Brady.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Prig is english. Now look up the definition and apply it to your comment.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Again no. Right now as I type this it says its going to you, judge and 4 others. When you see my reply it goes to everyone in this thread. When someone on that list sends a tweet it goes out to everyone listed. Unless a person is removed/blocked.		Again, learn how this works.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Ah, now we move to the conspiracy theory excuse. Used by people who cant refute facts and refuses to accept facts that run contrary to their own agenda based on willful ignorance. If you dont want things explained to you then stop giving false information.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and that's called being a "prig".
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and yet the other users is the one who made the comment to me and not you. Everyone participating in this thread sees all persons tweets unless they block. Again, learn how this works.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and thats why I added to your limited understand of what coercion is and its application in the legal realm.
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh the integrity of the trial and ensure the defendants rights are being observed and fairly applied. You know the job of a judge.
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The judge has a right and legal duty to ensure both sides are in compliance with all laws / regulations etc. The motion Flynns team made also did not include some of the info judge Sullivan ordered to be turned over.  The judge wants to see it for himself to protect
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and again the defense doesnt have to file the motion. Judge Sullivan, once he took over the case, ordered discovery for Flynn. When a person accepts a plea deal he loses the right of discovery. This judge has serious concerns over the governments / SC actions.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Why? Your the one who is not understanding whats going on.
@weprotect_truth @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The irony coming from the "protect the truth" user. I love it when you guys attack others and doint realize what your railing against is the very action your engaging in. For a person who claims to be tolerant you sure are intolerant of info that runs contrary to your own.
@AttyErinS Now - look up the scotus definition of in custody. It means the person your talking to is not free to move around. That can mean following Flynn around the WH while asking questions. An overt effort was made to stay with flynn the entire time. It doesnt mean handcuffed.
@JudgmentAbounds @dabizomb @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and yet you keep posting. If you dont like it then move on. You werent forced to join the thread.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and I wasnt talking to you. It was to Judgmentabounds stated. Try and keep up.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh released tonight they claimed they did tell Flynn why they were present and asking him questions (as you can see below). So either the 2 agents lied, the follow up agent who interview strzok lied or Comey / Mueller lied. https://t.co/yIzpEweULH
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh When they are present in an official capacity of investigating a suspect to the point of an official interview yes they do. As already stated people already testified they didnt want to tip him off as to the real purpose of their visit. At the same time in the docu released
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Secondly, and this brings it back to the start - how do they know what Flynn said to start with?
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh When being interviewed by the FBI in a criminal investigation its illegal. When you are repeating what you said to them and they are not present in an investigative capacity then how can repeating what you already said be lying to them?
@PersuasivePR @Popehat @AttyErinS @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh If you dont know what they mean then you probably should be commenting and looking like a clueless NTAC 2.0 compliant dullard.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Actually it is a key issue and very relevant to Flynns case. If they used threats against Flynns family in order to make him agree to a plea deal then its coercion. That coercion is illegal and any acts taken(by prosecution) after the coercion occurred is suspect.
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh You left out the word "not" and instead said entrapment is asking someone questions.....
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Actually you need to be intelligent enough to under stand legal applications and how courts work.		You do not.
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh was the violations and how does it impact the defendants rights.
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I am too however only if both sides were acting in good faith. In this case I dont believe Mueller was. That behavior is relevant to understand the plea deal reasons for acceptance and determine if the prosecutor was in fact operating in good faith and if not how egregious
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No - Take the plea deal or we start going after your family for anything we can is coercion. Its a requirement for a potential law violation to be present to investigate it. It is illegal to investigate a person in search of a crime.
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Yes however when a plea deal is reached via illegal / unconstitutional means it can be thrown out by  the judge. That is one remedy for the accused when the prosecutor breaks laws / court requirements (like Brady).
@Popehat @elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I'll stick with the legal term of egregious prosecutorial misconduct.
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Not even a closely relatable hypothetical. A minor is involved meaning parents are responsible for care / well bieng / discipline. #2 its not a criminal offense. #3 You need the prerequisite of investigating a potential crime while acting under color of law.		Try again.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh If your going to act like that then why bother asking questions if you know all the answers?
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh werent going to say the real reason why they were there.		which is it?		2/2
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh When you ask a guilt seeking question Miranda is required when your intent is to elicit a response that would incriminate the person. The 302/docu shows they lied in that they claimed they told Flynn the reason why they were there. In other testimony they said they 1/2
@JudgmentAbounds @dabizomb @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Reread my comment and put it into context with the post i responded to.
@elizahecht @JudgmentAbounds @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I am a police officer. Do I need to spell it out for you so you can understand what I have already told you?
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh and yet Comey already publicly stated the opposite. That was compounded by the document released tonight by the court where the agents lied and said they told Flynn why they were there when they already stated they did not. https://t.co/o7IAzsjVNr
@JudgmentAbounds @elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Never claimed I was a lawyer. I am in law enforcement. Hence why I said similar background and profession. Both are part of the criminal justice system. Both require the study of / application of the law. etc etc etc.
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh When a person speaks in public they can lie - its not illegal and the persons not under oath. 		Explain then how Flynn lied. Second question - How did the FBI know he lied?
@AttyErinS @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Then clarify what you said please - https://t.co/2BN4K1MhbM
@Jschmuck2 @Tom4nash @_dirkhh @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @Gwatson0008 @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Which one is confusing you so I can explain it to you.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Says the non lawyer.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The other is coercion by threat. Take this plea deal or we will ruin your sons life / go after him for stuff.		That actions is, in fact illegal. Its like telling a person show me where your husband/wife/boy/girrl friend with warrants is hiding or I will take your child.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Plea deals dont have to be accepted and when a plea deal is reached via 	surreptitious actions by the prosecution, and that info comes out before sentencing the trial judge can act on it. The term your looking for is "acting in god faith".
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Research egregious prosecutorial misconduct and remedies - law and constitutional redress.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No - they can do it because nothing prevents it. As I already stated and you apparently ignored there is case law with judges nullifying jury verdicts and plea deals. Until a appeals court / law changes it, it is a valid act.
@m_c_brilliant @EffLooch @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Plead guilty by a PLEA DEAL. Contrary to your thought process plea deals dont have to be accepted by the court. When they are reached by 	surreptitious means with brady violations the deal can be rejected by the court.
@Tom4nash @_dirkhh @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @Gwatson0008 @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh so is blocking asshats
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Then they have a similar background and chosen profession as me.
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh My position is based on my experience / education and chosen profession. So, not, I am not wrong and it is still up for debate. Unless you have some magic ability to cancel a persons free will and 1st amendment rights when you dont agree wth a position that runs contrary to yours
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh It doesnt prohibit the actions either and as I already stated there is case law where judges have nullifies jury convictions / prosecutions cases. So it supports my point and is in fact applicable.
@elizahecht @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The appeals court also did not prohibit any such actions from being taken by a district judge for egregious prosecutorial misconduct. There is already case law where judges have set aside verdicts / refused deals.		My point is judges can do it and no law/precedent says they cant. https://t.co/k1HsoK0T3b
@Tom4nash @_dirkhh @JudgmentAbounds @Popehat @Gwatson0008 @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh No - just American. Not a member of the asshat club aka not a democrat / liberal / mindless automaton.
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh But,like you said.	"I can be wrong and you can be right all we want, but wait till tomorrow when I’m wrong but will still tell you I’m right"
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh I stated a few times now some 1000 notifications back we have to wait for tomorrow morning to see whats going on. If I am wrong / you are wrong is of no consequence to be honest. This is a debate on what we think / how we see things. If im wrong I have no problem admitting it.
@dabizomb @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh There will always be rulings we dont agree with. However we personally feel about it thats the way it goes in our system. Its why we have appeals circuits, the Supreme Court and the ability top fire elected officials and hire ones who agree with us (or vice versa).
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh As for your other comment dismissal with prejudice is part of that remedy.

@MiriamShulamit @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh The court (judge) weighs the damage of prosecutorial misconduct to the case, namely the defendant, and how far / much the misconduct interfered with the rights of the defendant.
@MiriamShulamit @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh judge does in fact have the right and authority to "nullify" a prosecution when the government (prosecutor) acted so egregiously that the only available remedy is the nullification. All indictments / convictions / plea deals are quashed and dismissal with prejudice attached.
@MiriamShulamit @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh United States v. Acosta, 526 F.2d 670 (5th Cir. 1976 - The Federal judge dismissed the prosecutions case and nullified the conviction based on egregious prosecutorial misconduct. The appeals court reversed the district courts ruling however it specifically noted a 1/
@kimmurphy100 @JosephLPoulin @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh It is also used in criminal court. It means the charges in question cant be refiled by the prosecutor. It is one remedy for prosecutor misconduct.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Even though Flynn accepted a plea deal does not mean the court is required to. Especially if the prosecutions actions violated multiple laws / procedures.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Because they are not aware of it is not my problem. It is rare for a judge to take such action so im not surprised search engines have issues find material on it. A judge can nullify a verdict / plea deal based on prosecutorial misconduct (all encompassing for use here)
@BryanMa18455275 @chrislhayes As much fun as it is dealing with simpletons on the left I reached my quota.
@BryanMa18455275 @chrislhayes that makes you the swallower then or?
@Egregious_XII @CleopatrasHat @Popehat @EffLooch @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh Exoneration as I already stated like 300o notifications ago.
@08mms @Popehat @EffLooch @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh If you arent familiar with a judges authority, like nullifying a conviction / plea deal, dont know how miranda works, what Brady / Giglio / pitchess violations are then I would say you are right.
@LizardKing9316 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh We will find out tomorrow morning.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh That info would then be compared to the 302 that was turned over that was nothing more than an interview of Flynn by another agent 7 months later.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh the narrative was changed, showing they felt flynn did lie. That was then turned over to the SC to prosecute, opening the door.		The original 302 and field notes would show the explanation by agents as to their thought process in reaching the decision he wasntintentionally lying.
@RichSeviora @Gwatson0008 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh People either forget or ignore the fact the first interview by the 2 FBI agents stated Flynn did not lie to them but misremembered. Com,ey, under oath in congress, made the exact same statement - the 2 agents felt he didnt lie. 7 months later Strzok was interviewed at which point
@MiriamShulamit @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh a judge can remove /nullify everything case related, including charges, plea deals / guilty pleas etc etc. Its not common and usual;y is used when the prosecution behavior is beyond egregious that the defendant is owed a clean slate so the issue does not follow him around.
@MiriamShulamit @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh If the plea was reached by such egregious behavior by the prosecution (failing to comply with Brady / failing to turn over exculpatory information / failing to disclose documents the court ordered be turned over / destruction of evidence / obstruction / giglio violations 1/2
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh By the SC failing to comply with the judges order to turn over all 302's/notes / material related to the case in question its not only a violation of a court order (contempt) but it is also a Brady violation because he is refusing to turn over exculpatory evidence.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh never occurred. It prevents the prosecution from refiling the charges (dismissed with prejudice). Because Flynn took a plea deal anything less than the entire mess being thrown out completely will follow him around.
@JosephLPoulin @kimmurphy100 @Popehat @JudgmentAbounds @renato_mariotti @AlanDersh When LEO's fail to Mirandize the case (or parts of) can be thrown out. I am not referring to jury nullification. I am referring to JUDGE nullification. It is where a judge rules the entire prosecution was so tainted that the only recourse for the accused is to make it like it 1/
