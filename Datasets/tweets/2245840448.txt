@usminority Did you listen to Eric Poterfield's podcast? Please understand the difference between the LGBTQ MOVEMENT (socialist group) and loving, caring for, supporting LGBTQ people. You have to address the truth. Please research!!!
@usminority @e_porterfield You have to understand the difference between the "GROUP think LGBTQ Socialist movement" vrs just being for and loving gays. The movement is a socialist movement that hinders free speech. You should be able to say you're a heterosexual and receive just as much love and support.
@thecjpearson @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @RealCandaceO Terrific!!!
@usminority @e_porterfield I just listened to his entire podcast about what he said and what he believes and all of you full of hate for this man are democrat socialists at heart.  You should listen to it to @usminority
@usminority @e_porterfield I have no idea what's really going on with this. But one thing I don't understand is why the T in LGBT is always included. If someone believes they aren't a male or female, transgender "feelings", can't change the science behind what the DNA says.

@MrCInCali @HillaryClinton Think about what you are saying! The right to think and make a choice is before you have sex! Are you that ignorant to think you don't get pregnant from having sex? That is when the choice is made. She has you all wrapped around her finger!
@dian_bristow @HillaryClinton If I were a senator or representative I'd be wholly in favor of ditching ROE vs WADE and getting the TRUTH out!  It was a shame to begin with.  Why don't you search what really happened and what the lawyers wanted not the lady they were representing.
@HillaryClinton The reason why Hillary, aka KILLARY brings this up is to get you thinking in terms of the next SC Justice.  All she does is string you all along.  SHEEP headed for the SLAUGHTER house. WAKE UP!
@Felixkjjr1 @HillaryClinton Yep, before they decide to have sex.  Once you do there are consequences.  If you choose murder, aka abortion your judgement is sealed.
@MDHillRaiser @HillaryClinton Are you crazy? You are mixing up what choice means. Choice is to kill or not kill, not planning to become a parent or not.  They have disguised words with law. THINK!
@Petrel49 @HillaryClinton You never understood how men think?  Is that why women think the choice is after they have had sex and think, humm, I might be pregnant and need an abortion.  It's called thinking first before sex!!!!!  Yes, men want sex, how's that for thinking.
@HillaryClinton Yeah, hopefully it's when they decide to sleep with someone. It's called, sex education. It's not after the fact and killing a baby.  REVERSE ROE VS. WADE! Hillary is all for Margret Stangers view, just ask her.  It's about planned Parenthood killing black babies.

@JoshuaMacias @CptnSpectacular @mitchellvii Any site asking for money like this to spread truth is going to cause havock for you and everyone involved.  That's too bad.  I surely would never pay to enter any website.

@IPOT1776 @civildistress So, I haven't followed all the current Q vids, but have you read/heard info re: RR and his involvement with Set Rich as well as that Voice of America vid, possible non ligit 3 letter agency guys, along with non ligit reportforthePresident site?  Pay?  See @KKNoMates tweets.
@KKNoMates So that site is not legit after all?  What do you think?  I haven't been there more than once so didn't know the "pay" portion.
@KristenClarkeJD @RepMaxineWaters @KembaSmith @Nkechi_Taifa @jbmaclu Wait a minute, you're for Maxine Waters?  She does NOTHING for our country.  You say you are all for civil rights? Is that the ONLY thing you look at it?  I'm seeing that you are the racist. Think about it, what kind of character does she have!!! Terrible.  I'm appauled.
@Stizmaster @DavidKlion It is a serious thing.  We all need to know that those 2 individuals are terrible, horrible candidate's.  You shouldn't vote for either one and it does have to do with voting today.  You're a control freak aren't you. I bet you hate wen peple spell things wrong too.
@Stizmaster @DavidKlion Oh my gosh.  Are you that Democratic? One that can't see straight?  Today you don't vote for either of the those 2. You keep in mind that the candidate that should be votes for is Marc. If you actually went to vote and don't see his name on the voting ticket go back in November!
@Stizmaster @DavidKlion Your ridiculous.  You know the answer.  Why would you even ask in the 1st place.
@Stizmaster @DavidKlion All you needed to hear is that both of those candidate's are terrible.  The real candidate is Marc Molinaro . You know his name and don't need to vote Democrat at all!!!

@KristenClarkeJD @SenatorLeahy What are they hiding? That he has the facts on some of Hillary Clinton's crimes.  If those go public, she is gone. I don't know what else, but if that's thrown in front of the world he will be suicided before confirmation can happen.
