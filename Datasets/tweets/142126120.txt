@Barbaradye921 @forester6291 You have a lot of great comments and suggestions.  You should contact @RepAlLawsonJr  Rep Alfred Lawson’s office about this.  Please post any articles, video, interviews on this issue.  This is really one worth sharing...and following.  Thanks.
@mccaffreyr3 Sir, another good reason for Kloubachar.  Daughter of a newspaper writer.
@JamesAGagliano Likewise, nothing wrong with FBI which can’t be fixed with what’s right with FBI.  Overall jest of question was to rise above questions on current events to look at strategic long-term view of the FBI (ie. where do you see the FBI in 20-30 years?). Sorry for dissertation.
@JamesAGagliano What’s morale like?  Changes forthcoming?  Goldwater-Nichols Act reshaped DoD...painful process, but right thing to do.  Do you see something similar in DoJ future?  President Clinton said “There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America”
@JamesAGagliano On criticism and doubt.  First...criticism.  Let’s take Stone arrest.  Folks questioned/criticized use of force.  Isn’t this dangerous path?  Does it create doubt in whether agents are doing what their trained to do?  Doubt....what is concern over Comey/McCabe dismissals?
@JamesAGagliano Question was what to ask Director.  Retirees represent legacy of org.  The face of it was a lot different when you started than when you retired.  Where does Wray see the FBI in 20-30 years?  What is recruiting base?  How is retention?  How will FBI meet new threats/challenges?
@mccaffreyr3 Hope you’re right!  Am biased Minnesotan.  Believe she’s most “genuine” in the field.  Tough, smart, sincere.
@JamesAGagliano Ask what he believes this group of retired SAs will look like in 20 years, 30 years as the bureau evolves to meet existing and emerging challenges?  I think this is something dedicated current and retired SAs struggle with amid the criticism and doubt.

@JamesAGagliano Having been administered numerous tests also, I think the test CAN be more an indicator than an ABSOLUTE.  This is different than common perception of pass/fail.  They can be useful as a base for further inquiry, but not the sole reason to confirm.

@karagoldin Clean water should be a right.  Privatization takes away our control of this right.  I don't believe someone should profit off our right to clean water.  We should set standards, not lobbyists or corporations.
@karagoldin Exactly....this is why I feel it's an accountability issue.  Once you look at accountability, then you can find motive.  I think its a move towards privatization....which would be even worse for poorer Flint community.
@karagoldin I totally agree with you!  Half fixes will lead to larger crisis later.  The current issue lacks accountability, whether Feds or State....who allowed bottle water to be pulled?
@karagoldin Recent EPA rollback of Obama-era standards allow the Republican governor to vacate Flint while declaring "mission accomplished".  Any federal Flint repair funding managed at state level. State had to be forced into this in the first place, now they don't want to finish the job.
