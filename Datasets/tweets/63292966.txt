@DorisMatsui The Dems failed us.  You did not do everything you could have.  Why not your own investigation into who paid Kavanaugh's debts?  Why are you not investigating perjury in his hearing?  It doesn't have to be over.  But it will take a criminal investigation.
@olaeyes @rodellca @MichaelAvenatti Our Dem Senators did not do all they could do.  We can't go back and change a rigged election.  NOW was the time for the Dems to make a stand with everything they had.  They didn't.  They failed us.  And the consequences are huge.

@CaptainGreenhat @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And the facts don't bode well for Kavanaugh.  It's been interesting.  Have a good night.
@DogHouseGenius @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And lied under oath about so many things.
@DogHouseGenius @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp It's not a race war so much as a women will not be ruled by old white men anymore war.

@sampson105 @DogHouseGenius @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp I saw his temperment on display for myself.  Blaming the Democrats shows that he is not nonpartisan.   Evading questions.  Filibustering on how he likes to drink beer.

@DogHouseGenius @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp They forget that there were objections to Kavanaugh veing nominated to the Supreme Court before the accusation surfaced.
@CaptainGreenhat @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And you need to learn diplomacy.

@DogHouseGenius @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp A race war?  How did he come to that conclusion?   While I wouldn't agree, I could at least understand if he said gender war.

@CalFreedomMom @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And you are blind to not see past the accusation.  Putting the accusation aside he is not fit for office and I'm sorry you are so upset by that fact that you have to swear.
@DogHouseGenius @sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp It is exhausting isn't it?  They can't move past the accusation of sexual assault and see that even without it, Kavanaugh is a liar and cannot put aside his own prejudices to judge anything.  Sigh.
@sampson105 @KajsaJAndersen @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp Sigh.  Take Dr. Ford out of the equation and Kavanaugh is still not fit to be a judge of anything.
@whosthatguy623 @secularcitizen2 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And you are blind, or the top 1%, if you don't see that Trump is not working for us common people.

@secularcitizen2 @whosthatguy623 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp Not just accusations for Kavanaugh.  Lying under oath.  And let's not let what Clinton did slide.  What he did with a young, impressionable intern was wrong.  Hilary attacking Monica instead of her husband was wrong.  Kavanaughs role in the questioning was wrong.
@whosthatguy623 @secularcitizen2 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp Could be he voted for Trump, now regrets it, and is too embarrassed to discuss it.

Kavanaugh has lied under oath, ranted partisan rhetoric and shown he does not have the temperament to be on any judicial bench.  Plain and simple, he is not fit to be a judge.
@LordBartlett @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp He shouldn't be any type of judge.

@CalFreedomMom @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @GOP @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @JoeManchinWV @HeidiHeitkamp And lying under oath.  That's a fact and was televised for all to see.

@stephentetris @pbrantner @bethcorvino @vom_marlowe @mhohn @JessicaValenti @JuddApatow Assault.  The underage drinking is not the issue.  Assault is the issue.
@Trump8year @benlong87 @SecondWalk @RedaMor_ @realDonaldTrump I expect honesty, integrity and country over party.  Someone who represents the entire United States.  What do you expect?
@Trump8year @benlong87 @SecondWalk @RedaMor_ @realDonaldTrump Why do you think impartiality equals fake?
@ElizabethMTHC @MSNBC I was referring to Mark Judge being a teen age black out drunk as a reason for his not remembering the accuser or the party.
@Trump8year @benlong87 @SecondWalk @RedaMor_ @realDonaldTrump I think that you are assuming I am a Democrat when you write "my causes". I am not.  I want a fair and an impartial judge that upholds the constitution not based on any party.  I would think, based on your statement, that you want the same thing.
@ElizabethMTHC @MSNBC Sorry you misunderstood, not Judge as in Judge Kavanaugh,  Judge as in Mark Judge.  I hope that helps calm you down so you no longer feel compelled to call people you don't know names.  Sometimes it helps to deal with the stresses of life by assuming good intent.
@Trump8year @benlong87 @SecondWalk @RedaMor_ @realDonaldTrump Listening to the confirmation hearings.  He lied about receiving hacked emails.  It also bothers me that his rulings run along party lines and are not impartial.   Clinton could be subpoenaed but not Trump.  We need an impartial judge, regardless of party affiliation.
@ElizabethMTHC @MSNBC Judge wrote a book about being a teenage alcoholic.  It's normal to have memory lapses when you're a black out drunk.
@Trump8year @benlong87 @SecondWalk @RedaMor_ @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry you were harassed. I use more than one news source, and do not limit it to one type of media either. He is not the best choice for the SCOTUS, based on his lies under oath &amp; his past judge history. My opinion. Your opinion also has value &amp; I'm willing to listen.
