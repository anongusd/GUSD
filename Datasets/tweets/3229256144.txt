Calls for bipartisanship is great, but there are portions of the parties that we don't need. Left and Right aren't essential to a prosperous American future. The correct answer is essential to that and its found somewhere within the bounds not across both.
I'm just gonna say it, the @VanJones68 bird analogy is a strange analogy to apply to politics. It's almost emblematic of the centrist position that prevents removing unsavory positions from American politics

Obviously, these are broad strokes, but I believe that it would be very useful for those desiring to make a change to study conflict at its most essential level. To think of social movements primarily at a strategic level.
Rather than insisting on large set piece conflicts those in want of justice should flow like water to the points of weakest resistance to change and punch through creating as much impact as possible so as to increase the chaos of our foes not try and limit our chaos.
Am I wrong in believing that large social movements are captured by a Clausewitzian dependence on large decisive moments? People are quick to dismiss incrementalism as ineffective, but I assert that dismissal is a manifestation of a desire for synchronized movements.
I agree that success in conflict is in part reliant on one's ability to increase the amount of chaos experienced by an opponent. Further, I concur with Boyd that synchronizing activities are clearly detrimental to the effective application of the OODA loop.
After reading Coram's biography on John Boyd, I've been thinking a lot about the way Boyd challenges Clausewitz by questioning the insistence on large set-piece battles as the deciding factor in conflict.

i will always defend the person that chooses to be themselves and endeavors to be the best version of themselves		i don't hate people that are fake I feel bad for them 		it's a cruel fate to be trapped in a lie
i'm inspired by those who bring optimism to their life and to those around them		i find people who have the strength to look past themselves and out to where they can help to be the most valuable kind of friend
i resent people who get into arguments with others over who is feeling worse, is worse off, has bigger challenges, etc.  		even if that argument is subtle and draped in subtext it's pointless, self-effacing, and disgraceful

Allowing #Zuckerberg to say that controlling your data is as simple as being mindful of what you post and adjusting your settings is letting them off. Digital natives have had "be careful what you post online" drilled into them from a young age. It's not just about the posts.
@SenMarkey @ChrisCoons @JeffFlake @SenatorDurbin literally any of you... Control of the data that we consciously create is much easier than the data we unknowingly create.
#Zuckerberg -- Here's Facebook's line: When you post content you control it. So Senators can you PLEASE ask how Facebook tracks our viewing patterns and how that data is collected, stored, and used. Not the posts we make, but the pages we view and our patterns of use.
#Zuckerberg -- Get that "permission requirement" out of here. You are asking for a band-aid for something that needs stitches.
#Zuckerberg -- let's see those studies on social media's effect on wellbeing please
@ChrisCoons absolutely slams #Zuckerberg on abusive ad targetting practices (like facebook facilitating discriminatory housing advertisement) and Zuckerberg picks up on content restriction policy instead. Wherein he falls back into technical jargon which sums to "we are trying".
#Zuckerberg Choosing whether or not you post something on Facebook is *not* control over your data.
"#Zuckerberg asserts that the way you can control your data is by deleting your specific photos and comments and likes..." lol that's not control of what is done with your data. That's just mindfulness in what data you create.

Having mandatory training in order to get a firearm license would not only actually increase the defensive potential of the weapons. (Which is the supposed goal of gun advocates) It would also create a vetting process that prioritizes safety. /13
Two more are equally as important. One which is commonly stated is limiting addon features that pointlessly increase lethality such as (Bump Stocks, Extended Magazines, etc.). The other is demanding an extensive coursework for the procurement of a firearm license. /12
In short, there are several good ideas for gun control floating around the public discourse right now (Raising the minimum age, expanding universal background checks, seriously looking at the kinds of weapons that should be allowed to the civilian populous, etc.) /11
Finally, there is the tyranny argument. A semi-automatic weapon is going to do fuck all against a superpower. Not much an Ar-15 with a bump stock can do against an attack helicopter or a drone. /10
The relative deterrent effect of a bolt action rifle vs. that of a semi-automatic rifle with a bump stock is negligible because one or two well-placed rounds has plenty of stopping power. Though these scenarios themselves still demand a tremendous amount of training. /9
The other potential self-defense environment is one where the person you are defending yourself from does not also have a firearm. In this instance, high lethality serves almost no point. /8
Its potential for danger is directly tied to the potential lethality of the weapon because indiscriminate or accidental shooting requires far less control than the precision and poise necessary for self-defense. /7
If gun advocates were truly concerned with self-defense they would be strong proponents of extensive skills training and vetting prior to the purchase of a weapon. Any weapon only achieves defensive potential when the user can wield it effectively, but it's always dangerous. /6
So in almost all instances increasing the lethality of the weapon used by a single individual looking to protect themselves will have a very small impact on their defensive potential against another armed individual.  /5
Law enforcement and the military echo this in their doctrine. A shooter is not responded to by a single police officer. It's a huge undertaking that requires significant coordination, skill, and training. The military won't engage unless they have a three to one advantage. /4
Going to the range or going hunting does not emulate the kind of stressors that you would be subjected to in a shootout. Not to mention how much more dangerous and challenging the situation becomes if bystanders are introduced /3
The idea that increasing the lethality of the weapons used is going to improve their defensive potential is pretty ridiculous. Your average person does not have the training necessary to be effective in a gunfight. Which makes sense. How are you supposed to prepare for that? /2
Let's talk about the self-defense argument for gun control.  /1

@BDizzMySchnizz @chism_rhoda @NPR If we then figure that there were approximately 6,300 Sam's club employees laid off today (63 stores about 100 employees each). If they are working full time (40 hrs) their aggregate yearly salary is about 144,144,000.  /2

@danwlawrence @Kevander5 @NPR That's great news! I am sincerely happy that the program has been effective.

@danwlawrence @Kevander5 @NPR I don't think you have to "have a teenage child" in order to weigh in on this discussion. That sort of gatekeeping is problematic. Reducing distractions is good. My point suggests this is not the best way to do that. What happens outside of the classroom?
@danwlawrence @Kevander5 @NPR Ok, but don't you think that putting an emphasis on artificially removing distractions rather than encouraging strategies to deal with them effectively even when they are present might lead to problems down the line like in the college environment?
@TheEconomist well when you put it that way how could anyone not be excited about a "self-imposed eating-austerity programme"
so true to form after 41600 hours working at Walmart you get a bonus equal to 2 cents an hour. #TaxCutandJobsAct  whoop deeee doooo.
One other interesting tidbit about the Walmart bonuses is that you need to have worked there full time for 20 years to qualify for that $1000 bonus.
