@scottsflights do you still have 24 hours to get a full refund if it's an international flight?
You're telling me an overrated WR like @AmariCooper is worth a 1st rounder but @ShowtimeTate one of the best most consistent WRs in the NFL is only worth a 3rd rounder? I'd prefer to keep Tate, but if the @Lions were planning to trade him why not trade him to the @dallascowboys?

@PaulGlader @AntonBitcoin @YahooFinance @JMPjournalism It might depend on whether it's a private or government student loan. The government loans are typically better about those sort of things.
@AntonBitcoin @PaulGlader @YahooFinance @JMPjournalism Because student loans are the one type of debt that never goes away. You can discharge mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, even gambling debt through bankruptcy. But you can't file bankruptcy on your student loans. So if you stop paying them they won't go away.

When I first heard about Jim Brandstatter's firing, I was afraid it had something to do with #MeToo. But everything I've read about him since then says he was a great guy. So it appears they just ousted him because they think he's too old. Isn't that against the law?
Nothing against @LomasBrown75 (I respect anyone who blocked for @BarrySanders), but I won't listen to anymore @lions games on @wjrradio. The Lions are a sad franchise that doesn't have many icons, but Jim Brandstatter was one of them. They should've treated him better #boycottWJR

@StarFire2258 Gotcha. What about the Luna Apocalypse? Is that designed for a 25% incline or more?

.@LaborSec: No, we took our time to get it right. @RichardBurr_DN @USDOL
1st question: Is Obama administration to blame for the delay in the #silica rule? @RichardBurr_DN @USDOL @LaborSec
One reporter even asked a question that wasn't related to the @USDOL #silica rule and @LaborSec still took time to answer. Mine was relevant
Two reporters in front of me both asked follow up questions, and plenty got to ask questions after me, so it was not an issue of time @USDOL
But when I press him on why Obama administration is not to blame for delay after 7 yrs, @USDOL cut me off
To be fair, @LaborSec did give a decent answer to my first question, said Obama administration is not to blame for the delay.
I dailed *1 to get back in the que, but @USDOL never let me ask another questions.
It wouldn't happen in a physical press conference. @USDOL
If @USDOL can control the flow of questions by disconnecting reporters who ask tough questions, that's a violation of #pressfreedom.

@Safeway Last but not least, they always sell expired items. Purchased old contact solution, yogurt, bread but didn't realize til I got home
@Safeway But if you catch it in time, that just slows things down even more because they have to go back and check the price.
Also, this @safeway is a master of bait-and-switch. Don't know how many times the groceries ring up as more than the advertised sale price.
@Safeway the cashiers are nice, but part of the problem is they don't seem to know what they're doing, or else they lollygag.
@Safeway I try to be patient but it's hard when this happens time and time again, but only grocery store in neighborhood, nowhere else to go
@Safeway Even when the lines are short, like only one or two people in front of you, probably wait 15 mins to check out.
@Safeway Not uncommon to be standing there for a half hour or more.

@thesenanschlag Will you be around on Sunday?
@thesenanschlag Do you work for the tourism industry there? I heard they are renovating the church in advance of the 500 year anniversary.
@vjmfilms i dunno, what did you say?
@thesenanschlag are those two different churches?
@thesenanschlag Thanks. What should I see while I'm there? I was thinking his home, the church where he preached and the 95 theses.

@LEETERRYNE And remember around 2008 when they dropped to about $1.50 for a short time? Those were the days..
@LEETERRYNE I remember the last time they were below $3/gallon. I paid $2.89 in fall 2010, when I was living in Detroit.

@JosiahRyan Yep, here for a couple months, mostly covering the German elections for @WashTimes. What have you been up to?
@ESPN must have realized their mistake, though, because they quietly changed it to "A's beat Tigers" without acknowledging the error.
@ESPN headline WAS "A's sweep Tigers." Sure, they won three straight games against us, but it's a four-game series.
@niksunen Do you need my number?
@JosiahRyan By association, @WashTimes got the first English version of the story. I translated for them and Suddeutsche.
@JosiahRyan @WashTimes No, he gave them to a German newspaper I'm also working with, Suddeutsche Zeitung. They wrote the first story.

@emeliefagel no problem at all, just happy to make calls within Germany for now.
@emeliefagel Ok, thanks. I will be in meetings from 8:30 until lunch (Munich time), but could talk afterwards.
@emeliefagel I will try to call her, but wasn't sure if I could get through since it's an international call and was having difficulties.
@emeliefagel I tried dialing 1 before the number, but a message came up in German and I couldn't understand it..
@emeliefagel The phone works for German calls, but can't dial internationally, and I don't think it's forwarding my US number.
hey @emeliefagel thanks for following up. Pretty happy with your products. The Internet works.
@DailyCaller this tweet sounds like @paconner -- and my next punchline.
There you have it! "@mboyle1: @timdevaney well @USAirways has always been the worst for me too."
@USAirways finally boarding! To put this in context for you, we are departing when we should be arriving.
@mboyle1 what's your worst flight delay? Can it be any worse than @usairways?
@USAirways now the airport restaurants are all closed cause you kept us here so long &amp; we are hungry! RU conspiring to starve us to death?
@USAirways Maybe I should call for a #boycott? We'll see..
@USAirways just tell me this ... Do you plan to fly this plane sometime in the next six months, or will this flight be delayed until 2014?
@USAirways I never thought I would say this, but even @Delta is better than this.
You should fix this -- not just for me but all these passengers. Otherwise, I'll make sure my readers know never to fly @USAirways again!
@USAirways But your staff is standoffish and not willing to take responsibilty. The least you could do is buy us a meal or pay for a hotel.
@USAirways my car can drive in the rain -- but your big airplane can't? Ridiculous!
@USAirways no thunderstorms either!
