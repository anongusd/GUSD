@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting community trust is important and goes along with an organization. Is it for better or for worse?
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting "gang related, what does that mean?" Keeps coverage of certain kinds of crimes down.
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting very good point about "documented gang members." Their lives are discounted in the media.
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting "don't follow the press release." Very good point.
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting good point, you have to know their communities to accurately report on marginalized groups
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting an important mission of the press within marginalized communities is to get them to speak out
@amyjmerrick @spjonadepaul #DPUReporting sounds like Univision fills a role for its community much like ABC etc. used to nationwide
