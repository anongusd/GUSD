@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer You‚Äôre obviously only interested in a dispute, rather than a discussion, @ this point‚Äîso I think we‚Äôre finished. What a shame. Discourse is important, &amp; it‚Äôs a major reason many people are on here in the first place. Good night.

@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer You don‚Äôt own the status of being terrified‚Äîanyone who‚Äôs paying attention is right there. The thing is, terror &amp; panic are antithetical to real solutions‚Äî&amp; that‚Äôs why we need to be careful in *all* this.
@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer Since DiFi is but one Senator in a body of 100, your comparison fails. There are different kinds/levels of leadership. She‚Äôs hardly ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù the GOP contingent‚Äî&amp; as for ‚Äútaking oil money,‚Äù I dare say there‚Äôs a great deal more to it than that surface accusation.
@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer I‚Äôm just as desperate, so please don‚Äôt go there‚Äî&amp; I raise my voice often. Bludgeoning refers to the ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù hallmark of progressives, in so many instances. &amp; you‚Äôre ‚Äòway off on the JFK/DiFi comparison, BTW.
@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer Now you‚Äôre talking apples/oranges. &amp; if you think Justice Dems is a legitimate entity, I suggest you do some objective research‚Äîstarting w/who their affiliates &amp; funding sources are. There‚Äôs some nasty baggage.
@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer Spare me your ageism. Moxie has its place, but in the end it‚Äôs all about balance.

@charlequin @aravosis @speculawyer Paywall.
@teresa_linders @aravosis @speculawyer It‚Äôs about teamwork &amp; balance, which is often difficult for younger people to get into. Passion is part of youth, &amp; it‚Äôs important‚Äîbut it won‚Äôt carry the day.
@AnAdGuy @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer The unedited video I‚Äôve viewed is a 6-part thread, &amp; makes it quite clear that the thing originally making the rounds was a deliberate hit job. DiFi isn‚Äôt the problem, &amp; I‚Äôm quite satisfied w/her track record.
@supertaschablue @aravosis @speculawyer Yes‚Äîwhich is what we‚Äôre seeing, along w/so-called ‚Äústars‚Äù of social media distracting from contributions by new members like Sharice Davids, for whom I have utmost respect.
@Hermionejh @AnAdGuy @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer Exactly‚Äî&amp; this is why it‚Äôs *so* dangerous that our schools don‚Äôt emphasize (or in many areas, even teach) civics/government. People have no clue how things are supposed to work, &amp; it becomes all about attitude &amp; ‚Äúpassion,‚Äù FFS. üôÑ
@AnAdGuy @Hermionejh @McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer No, she wasn‚Äôt. Have you viewed the *entire* video, which is threaded in 6 parts? Presents a very different picture. Feinstein was dignified &amp; courteous, not @ all condescending. What you decry as ‚Äúincrementalism‚Äù is how politics works‚Äînot bludgeoning to make one‚Äôs point.
@charlequin @aravosis @speculawyer If your ‚Äúnotes‚Äô are @ all accurate, you‚Äôll see that that wasn‚Äôt the case for an extended period of time. In any event, this issue isn‚Äôt one that moves quickly, or in linear fashion‚Äîto our increased peril.

@ImNoAuthor @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not the reality we‚Äôre confronting, w/a GOP-dominated Senate. The minority party can only do so much. House Dems are stepping up &amp; taking action in that forum‚Äîbut they don‚Äôt control the Senate. That‚Äôs the harsh reality.
@ImNoAuthor @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest There‚Äôs a *lot* of misunderstanding about GND, &amp; ppl have been jumping on the bandwagon w/o adequate info/understanding.

@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer When it‚Äôs all sorted out &amp; we have the true context, I‚Äôve no doubt that Feinstein‚Äôs responses will stand any test.

@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer I work in law, &amp; what we‚Äôre seeing in these incidents is redefining the concepts under discussion. At this point, it‚Äôs the *effect* that matters, not the technique(s) utilized. False is false.

@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer Thank you for this. I‚Äôll need to see the entire thing‚Äîthis is apparently only Part 1 of 3. It‚Äôll surface. This hits a *much* different note than the edited version that‚Äôs causing such an uproar.
@CBeauvier @HoarseWisperer Now you‚Äôre being downright wicked‚Äîapricot jam! My mom &amp; I used to make apricot-pineapple preserves every summer, w/fruit from our own trees. You‚Äôve made me crave it now! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer No worries‚Äîwhen responses are flying, it‚Äôs easy to lose track. We all do it. üôÉ
@finkelbuster @ComplicitAF_GOP @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer Please reread the thread.  I was responding to you, @finkelbuster.
@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer In this instance‚Äîas is so often the case, in politics‚Äîediting *is* altering. Skewing the facts is unacceptable.
@motherjuggs @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest It‚Äôs already well under way‚Äîcame across a great thread w/abundant receipts, earlier this week. We‚Äôll be seeing plenty more, too. üëçüèª
@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer It‚Äôs all about editing here‚Äî&amp; I see no problem w/words &amp; tone from Feinstein. The truth will come out.

@finkelbuster @ComplicitAF_GOP @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer It‚Äôs definitely questionable, whether this is *truly* the full account of the meeting. Would like some evidence from witnesses who weren‚Äôt part of the Sunrise-organized group.
@CBeauvier @HoarseWisperer That sounds entirely too luscious! Must try! üòã
@ComplicitAF_GOP @finkelbuster @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer First, please note my previous tweet wasn‚Äôt directed to you. Second, please note Sunrise, the source of this video, is connected to Justice Dems. If you don‚Äôt know their history, do visit their website. Their affiliations &amp; funding are highly suspect. This is a hit piece, period.
@motherjuggs @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest Not if we can help it! I‚Äôm pleased to see that plenty of people are on board w/ #VettingBernie, &amp; are bringing receipts, too.
@finkelbuster @ComplicitAF_GOP @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer You‚Äôre missing my point‚Äîthis source isn‚Äôt anything different, it‚Äôs still Sunrise.
@william_1492 @siano2020 Makes sense‚Äîthough it‚Äôs cats who get all the hairball publicity. ü§î
@CBeauvier @HoarseWisperer Yes, indeed‚ÄîI now have a new &amp; thoroughly decadent obsession. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@finkelbuster @ComplicitAF_GOP @donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer Nope‚Äîthis is *filmed by Sunrise*, whose agenda is @ issue here. Skillful editing is evident. You‚Äôre pushing #ProgressivePropaganda.
@ImNoAuthor @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest That‚Äôs not what happened‚Äîthe video was carefully edited to achieve the specific effect it‚Äôs having among many. It‚Äôs #ProgressivePropaganda‚Äîhorseshoe Project Veritas, if you get my drift. Critical thinking definitely required here.
@motherjuggs @AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest Agreed‚Äî&amp; that‚Äôs awful.
@lyndalovon @HoarseWisperer I respect your opinion, but she‚Äôs not part of the problem‚Äîespecially now, when so many are unwilling to stand up to Drumpf. I‚Äôll leave this here: who was it that revealed that transcript ladt year? ü§î We need her on our side.

@ProudSkeptic @HoarseWisperer Look more closely‚Äîit‚Äôs been edited, all right.
@McKenna9999 @HoarseWisperer Same here‚Äî100%! DiFi definitely knows what she‚Äôs doing, &amp; has *always* done her job w/grace &amp; class. This was a deliberate political hit-job effort, &amp; we‚Äôre NOT buying it! #ProgressivePropaganda
@GrayLadysGhost @CherryWanders @HoarseWisperer Precisely. #ProgressivePropaganda
@lyndalovon @HoarseWisperer Nope. Look beyond the obvious here‚Äîthat video is carefully *edited* &amp; is a deliberate hit piece, from start to finish. Propaganda isn‚Äôt pretty.

@donna_shelton @HoarseWisperer Please consider that this video was obviously carefully *edited* to achieve a particular effect‚Äî&amp; people are buying in w/o exercising critical thinking. (Feinstein is my Senator, has represented CA well for many years, &amp; is right on point here.)
@mlxgolfer @HoarseWisperer @garylowco1 I‚Äôll second that‚ÄîFeinstein is exactly the person for the position, especially now. We need her experience, savvy, &amp; guts as we continue to combat Drumpf &amp; now face down this pseudo-progressive BS.
@trailhen @MikeNorrisLFK @HoarseWisperer @lisaray937 Exactly‚Äîdirty tricks in play, folks. Stay woke, &amp; speak up.
@AmoneyResists @HoarseWisperer @adamcbest Since when is it ‚Äúcondescending &amp; dismissive‚Äù to reasonably &amp; respectfully suggest that those who‚Äôre critical of politics/politicians step up &amp; run for office themselves? It‚Äôs easy to criticize. That‚Äôs the message.
