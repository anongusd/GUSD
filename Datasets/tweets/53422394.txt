All rules have gone out the window w/this administration! Now it has leached to the SCOTUS nominee &amp; the process to confirm this nominee! His speech shows just how far Kavanaugh will go 2 play 2 Trump‚Äôs base by playing the partisan game! This is not normal-choose someone else!!
Trump is making this a reality TV show! With explosive hearings,  WSJ OpEd &amp; Fox News interview, Kavanaugh pre-planned &amp; pre-wrote his speech!!! This is not a circus-Vote NO on Kavanaugh!!! #NotFitForSCOTUS There are other choices! @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin @JeffFlake
