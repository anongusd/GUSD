@winding_sios @hkh_uk @redditchrachel The Good Friday Agreement has nothing to do with these provisions, under WTO trade exporting and importing on both sides of the border can be checked for regulatory standards inside the country and not at the border and both sides don't a hard border so there won't be one.

@winding_sios @hkh_uk @redditchrachel true, but they can at least informally agree with a trade deal which has not happened yet.

@hkh_uk @redditchrachel Well as an independent sovereign country, labour can just run on this massage and win an easy majority, you don't need to be in the EU to implement EU law
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel @BorderIrish Nope not true at all, if the British and Irish simply don't want a hard border there won't be one, and if we later down the line agree to a trade deal with the EU, EU regulatory standards can be checked inside the country on both sides of the border.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel why would we be better off inside the EU? we can do everything if not more outside the EU, the only difference is that all laws including immigration, regulations with domestically and with trade can be controlled by the British government and not the EU.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel all sides want peace, there is no problem, but somehow some people think its a problem. Its not about peace at all, its about preventing a hard border, but again two sides don't a hard border so there is not going to be a hard border. The backstop is the fantasy not brexit!
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel We can't control the workers‚Äô rights and equality rules, why can't we just implement them ourselves, thats not being an independent sovereign country
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel We may have a say, but we have no control over the process, but your point is nonsense Iceland dos it alone, Switzerland does it alone, counties in Africa do it alone, South American countries do it alone, southeast countries do it alone, we are more stronger than all of them.ü§£
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel because you agreed to that awful backstop and the eu does not want to give us to good of a deal. However, they aren't giving us a trade deal, they giving us membership of the single market without a say
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel If you count all EU regulations, EU-related Acts of Parliament, and EU-related Statutory Instruments, about 62% of laws introduced between 1993 and 2014 that apply in the UK implemented EU obligations.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel a trade deal, and there are many commonwealth countries that want to trade with us but EU tariffs and regulations are getting in the way
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel but we can't control those trade deals we are in and in many cases we don't get a say in them, and the EU prevents us with doing trade with the rest of the world. Why can't we create our own trade deals as the firth largest world in the world??? It takes 10 years for the EU to
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel You just described the problem with the EU, but why can't we have a free trade agreement with the EU after we have left, you don't have to be in the EU in order to trade with EU countries. Also by leaving the EU we can create trade deals with other countries around the world.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel there can be cooperation or shared development of policies between neighbouring countries, we have good relations with them, but why should we have to be in a political union that takes away 62% percent our laws, why can't we have a free trade agreement with the EU?
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel Well the simple answer is that its bad for the other 27 countries as well
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel yes, we just want to be in control of them, but the EU does not let us do that. What I saying was if you happen to like EU laws, we can just implement them ourselves or in that case get rid of some laws you don't like, but at least if we left we can be able to control them.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel We don't want to be apart of the single market or customs union thats the whole point.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel We don't want to be in a political union in which only 10% of the share of MEPs in EU parliament are British, that means that 90% have a say in our laws, for you kidding me????????? Plus, the EU parliament is the only parliament in the world where you can't propose legislation.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel but you doesn't need to be in a political union in order for that to happen, in fact I would encourage other countries to do the same as us and leave the EU.
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel Your logic doesn't make sense because if we leave the EU, we can just implement the same rules the EU rules, but all the laws could be made and controlled here, which you can't do in the EU. But, if you want to have close relationships with EU countries I am totally for that
@CaballeroDarren Backstop is there to prevent a hard border, but there is not going to be a hard border because all sides have agreed on that position. So whats the point of even including a backstop in the first place?
@StrategNL @NUnl The EU Parliament cannot propose new legislation which is a fact and it is instead proposed by the EU commission which is unelected which is also a fact!
@hkh_uk @redditchrachel Why can't we just make the 10% of the voting rights remain here, there are many laws that are created by other countries that affect us, and that he have no control over, similarly with this law other other countries inside the EU will have no control it.
@StrategNL @NUnl laws here in this country, how can we not create our own trade deals as the world's firth largest economy?
@StrategNL @NUnl It has not made Britain a rich country, in fact it has prevented us from reaching our full potential. EU laws are proposed and are only proposed by the EU commission which are unelected bureaucrats. We cannot control EU law even if we like the legislation, but can't make our own

@cathmci and UK interests to form a trade deal, staying in parts of the EU is just blackmail on the part of the unelected eurocrats. Right now we are part of the single market and customs union, all brexitneers want to have trade and not be of part of a political union which is the EU.

@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 It is a political union that takes away our laws, courts, and is protectionist when it comes to trade, and no matter how we feel about its laws we can't control them. How can't we trade as an independent sovereign country with Europe and the rest of the world?
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 (which it isn't), the problem is the EU is a higher political power that controls 62% of our laws, we are not supposed to be in a united states of Europe, we are an independent sovereign country, and there should be no institution that should be higher than ours.

@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU The only thing is that if you and other politicians like this policy we could implement it any selves once we are an independent country, and we will be in control of it
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU well you could also look at it the other way around and we will be better at importing immigrants in a legal way through Africa and Asia which we cannot do now.

@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU For the thousandth time, EU parliament cannot propose this legislation, and the UK only makes up 1/27th of the parliament, in which if you don't agree but the other counties do, well less there is an exemption clause which doesn't that much, JUST DO WHAT YOUR TOLD!
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU I could name hundreds of legislation that are not really important, the point is that we don't have a say in any of them, in terms of specific regulations that has more to do with the working of tariffs and regulations imposed by the EU on trade, and immigration

@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 fine, but in order for me to answer your question I need to research the specific names to actual laws. To your second point I was just trying to illiterate how undemocratic the EU parliamentary system is.
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU WTO just setts the basic laws for us to trade, think of it as a crossing guard or a police officer, yes you are right about the WTO'S favored nation rule (kind of), but that assumes that we are part of the EU, in which it itself we as a country have no say over.

@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 that is not how a parliament works, a parliament's job is to propose new legislation, what you are basically saying is that lets say my mother were to give me a salad for lunch, but then I didn't want it.

@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 ...the problem is there are always more laws that are coming out all the time, and even some laws we do like we cannot control. When you talk MEPs, the European Parliament is the only parliament where someone cannot propose new legislation, vast majority of power rest with....
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 own interests, including being able to make trade deals like the vast majority of the rest of world. It is not that EU laws are so toxic, even though there are many I could name, it is because we cannot control them. But, lets says both sides were to agree to get rid of laws....
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 Brexit will make us better off, because as we currently stand right now, the EU controls 62% of our laws that are being applied. When we leave the EU MPs in this country we will finally be responsible for making our own laws and by doing so reflect 100% of our laws to our.....
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU Those trading relationships are not tied to a single political union that takes away a nation's laws. The UK after we have left the EU can be able to join several trading blocs or relationships if we wanted to as an independent nation.
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 Please explain to me your point, I really want to understand your position and have a proper debate.
@WeNeedEU @OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 what is factually wrong with what I am saying?
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU Well it is the powerful trade block in the world, not because its the best at trade, but because it is a strong political union which is why being a member of it so toxic. What you mean by wanting to go at it alone? Are African, South American, SE Asia counties going alone.
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 of member of parliament to the house of commons, which in itself is also limited because we handed so much power to the EU bureaucrats.
@OrlandotheCooke @WeNeedEU @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 its not about the laws specifically that are the problem although there are alot I really don't think. The main problem is that whether you like EU law or not, there no way the UK can change them, its not like UK legislation which you can change through the election of.....
@WeNeedEU @OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 A marriage is two people on normal footing, the EU and the UK are not on equal footing, EU basically controlling 62% of the UK's applied law. Even in marriage, should you not divorce if the marriage is so toxic?
@WeNeedEU @OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 Newsflash: the EU and Europe are not the same thing, not in the least bit, at fact I feel bad for other countries being part of this terrible political union.
@WeNeedEU @OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 this is not a marriage at all, the UK is 21 year age that is smart and intelligent, and the grumpy old parents which are the EU, because at home the parents are still in charge.
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU the only trade block in the world
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU Other trading blocs are not political unions, if EU was just a tarding bloc there would be no desire to leave it. The EU is the leaving trade block in the world where we can't be part of any other trading block and in order to do so we need to leave the EU.
@OrlandotheCooke @nickylep @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @WeNeedEU Can the UK break the agreements at any time if they wanted to?

@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU With WTO, we would comply EU regulatory standards when it comes to products be exported to the UK, but that is only with EU products. However, this does not mean that the UK will have to comply with regulations on importing and exporting around the world.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU The beauty about being an independent country is that we don't have to China, hopefully the two counties can negotiate a good fta, but again this is what every country on WTO goes through, but we will be able to trade Africa, the Americas and Asia including China.

@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU no this is not arrogance, I am just trying to make fun your point which outright nonsense.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Well MEPs cannot produce any new legislation and most power rests with the European the EU commission which is unelected, and most people in Britain don't know who is on it. Speaking of the MEPs very few people know who there MEP is because they have no real power.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Not ture, you are talking are regulatory regulations between imports and exports between country A and  country B, but if country A wants to trade with country C totally different regulations apply. But you saying is true of all sovereign nations under WTO which is all countries.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Well it looks like I just lost this debate because I know the UK is one of the weakest nations of the planet, with also an out of date military and nuclear weapons, and we should ignore the fact that we are on the UN security council and already use WTO in the EU, lol ü§£ü§£ü§£
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU There are alot of them, but the real and bigger problem is that whether you like the EU's regulations are not there is nothing the UK can do to change them. THAT IS NOT DEMOCRATIC!
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Actually you have no expedience to prove what you are saying, after all we are the world's 5th largest economy
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU The Brexit deal has nothing to do with Brexit itself, frankly the only thing that should be in the withdrawal agreement is a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU, THATS IT.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Well, you just made my point.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU true, but its the EU's regulations that are the real problem
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU if Labour were to win with a large majority, your seat would still go Tory, but some individual constituencies will always go a certain way!
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU yes, so what, but in doing so you have made the case for leaving the EU even stronger
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU By that logic, it is also a Bad idea for the EU trying expand and look credible on the world stage. You act like this something too hard for us to accomplice, but it isn't for smaller counties around the world.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU When it comes to deal between the UK and the EU, both sides would be hurt by not coming to trade agreement, so it would not be in their best interests to get in a long and bitter dispute.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU What you just said makes total nonsense, because with most counties in the world we would have a trade surplus and more bargaining power. We almost a fully service economy anyway, so actually the UK would do quite well in the long run.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU A trade deal between the EU and the UK is like any other trade deal the UK that make with any other nation in the world. The UK can establish any type of trade with want with any part of the world. It is not mandatory that once we leave the EU that we need a trade deal with them.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU 2. Well just look at every country in the world using WTO and compare it to Britain being the world's 5th largest economy. WE are more than capable of undergoing trade negotiations and if it was that difficult every few counties would be using WTO.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU with other counties, because of the overwhelming tariffs placed on foreign imports, while also putting in place strict regulations that the UK wants to get rid of.
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU First, when it comes to human rights if you don't want a tory government which have always said they would keep them in place then just win an election presumably by voting labour. When it comes to the EU setting up trade deals, it makes to very difficult to form trade deals with
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU the UK can enact its own human rights and even copy down the EU's and as for trade deals, alot of them 10 years to make and will roll over once we leave through WTO. We should be able to create our own trade deals by dropping the EU's tariffs and regulations, making new deals!
@HMYBritanniaUK Yes Threasa May wants us to remain, her wants keeps us in the backstop permanently, we need a clean no-deal brexit, please!

@AngieMeader @IanAustinMP We are going WTO, global Britain and noone is going to stop it!
@OrlandotheCooke @MadeleinaKay @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU Well, if you want to fix the uk system which i am with you on, lets begin with leaving the EU. The major difference is that legislation passed on the house of commons usually becomes law. The most ironic thing though is that the house of lords wants us to remain so badly
@MadeleinaKay @OrlandotheCooke @manbearpig9282 @nickylep @WeNeedEU No there isn't, we cannot elect eu commissions which hold the real power and they do not have our best interests in heart
@LovellPropguru @ProUdin2016 @gr8britbreakoff @is_AnythingReal @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky Correct
@johnleremainer @muschifuss998 We voted to take back 62% of our laws which under uk control would allow us to make our own trade deals, as well as other rules and regulations. We could also go the opposite way and add more regulations and rules and nationalize the railroads if we so wanted to.
@mraza_dev @snappedlv426 @Peston @theresa_may The UK has the card of no deal with article 24 evoked allowing us to have free and frictionless trade
@WalkingForEU @muschifuss998 @johnleremainer @arnhemsmeisje62 Well, as an independent sovereign country after brexit, all labour has to do is win an election, we didn't need to be in the EU
@PaulANettleton If anything brexit will only benefit Japan even more as we can drop all EU regulations and tariffs and negotiate a better trade deal with WTO
@SexyBrexshit @RogerHelmerMEP @theresa_may Threasa May is a remainer, and is not giving the Brexit we wanted
@johnleremainer @muschifuss998 @WalkingForEU @arnhemsmeisje62 Yes, lets listen to the referendum result and finally deilver Brexit!
@AgainstFearGB You are exactly right, the people of the uk beileve they are living in a sovereign country but in fact they are being controlled by the EU superstate
@amriana @tiresistance You meant to say 54% for leave because that is going to be the result of a second referendum
@LovellPropguru @ProUdin2016 @gr8britbreakoff @is_AnythingReal @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky Your argument falls flat because states are not trying to become countries, but actual counties inside the EU do.
@pdsmith74 @philshort If you count all EU regulations, EU-related Acts of Parliament, and EU-related Statutory Instruments, about 62% of laws introduced between 1993 and 2014 that apply in the UK implemented EU obligations.
@pdsmith74 @philshort You mean mean we will be able to control our own laws, trade deals, while also bringing out accountability to the very politicians we spend to Westminster!
@The_ChrisShaw @ProUdin2016 @gr8britbreakoff @is_AnythingReal @LovellPropguru @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky this reasoning is even more laughable than that last comment I responded to.

@NulaTweets actually the tariffs for Pharmaceutical products is 0.0% between the UK and EU in a no-deal situation
@NulaTweets the tariffs would only go up to 10% for medial and food products, but would make it far more easy for all those not in the EU, and it is also more hard for British manufacturers to sell food and meds abroad because of EU regulations
@NulaTweets most of the articles are based on the premise that no-deal is terrible for the uk because we will lose all trade with the EU, but in reality, it all has to do with tariffs
@NulaTweets comes to individual companies, and at the same time the EU doesn't want lose its own trade, so a trade deal will be reached, but even if its not agreed upon, trade will still happen
@NulaTweets well lets take that claim you just made "any food on the supermarket shelves and life-saving meds". However, of those items outside the EU, we can simply trade through WTO to get those products to the UK, and when it comes to products inside the EU, trade will not stop when it...
@ProUdin2016 @gr8britbreakoff @is_AnythingReal @LovellPropguru @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky your reasoning is just laughable, the UK is a much much smaller country than the USA, but its also the world's firth largest economy
@NulaTweets that is there I am currently, but that last claim you made on brexit is complete garbage
@NulaTweets well I will copy and paste what I said earlier well you have made an unsubstantiated claim without any evidence, and you are questioning me for even asking the question
@NulaTweets and its also completely false as well!
@NulaTweets well know you are bringing up a completely different point
@NulaTweets By that definition all independent sovereign countries are a third country, which is what we want
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR well was it advisory when the mps voted for article 50, I DON'T THINK SO
@NulaTweets oops, my mistake for misreading what you said, lol, but a "Third Country" is much better than a third world country hahaha
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR maybe I should point out all of the criminal investigations of the remain campaign, but this has nothing to do with the brexit argument, which is settled anyway
@NulaTweets A third world country is a "the underdeveloped nations of the world, especially those with widespread poverty" so yea.
@NulaTweets "I didn't vote for the UK to become a Third Country!", don't play stupidüòâ
@cros13 @FHS_SW1 @annasoubrymp you have not not disproved what I said, more than 400 mps voted for remain and are know trying to subvert the result of the referendum, as well as May signing up to the terrible backstop, and the EU not changing its position of striking to the deal, so yes the fault is there
@gr8britbreakoff @ProUdin2016 @is_AnythingReal @LovellPropguru @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky no its not, can you set for own trade deals, can you not listen the EU court of justice, can you also control your own fishing waters, can you ignore bad laws or trade deals signed by the EU, NO YOU CAN'T
@lunaperla @theresa_may 17.4 mn voted to leave and you leave by way of evoking article 50, and the MPs HAD TO LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE BY VOTING FOR IT AS WELL, lol
@NulaTweets Well you have made an unsubstantiated claim without any evidence, and you are questioning me for even asking the question
@TaraBash18 well yes ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£I find it inconvenient that the remainers are trying to stop it from happening, lol
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR After all, most leavers I speak to actually know more the EU structure because they care more about bureaucracy than remainers would ever care to know about. You would probably deny this claim way, but that is the president you sett when you claim the vote is not legitimate
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR be applied to any election that has ever been voted on, which leads me to the next point which is that people didn't know what they were voting for. If you are going to apply that leavers didn't know what they were voting for, why can't I make the same claim about remainers??
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR well lets talk about your first point, an 'opinion seeking' referendum. When it comes to constitutional issues, EU is above UK law and big constitutional issues should be put to the people because they are policies promised in a referendum, so to it was 'opinion seeking' can...
@gr8britbreakoff @ProUdin2016 @is_AnythingReal @LovellPropguru @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky much better, as I am in a sovereign country that is not controlled by a court down in mexico
@FHS_SW1 @cros13 @annasoubrymp that is the every problem, the only putting implementing the result are the hard brexiteers, over 400 mps voted to remain
@NulaTweets How is the UK going to be a thrid worl country, please explain
@Gordon1000 Remember only 5 percent of British companies do business with the EU
@TaraBash18 Only to remainers it is
@Taurus_Devil_UK I am completely the other way around, I had no idea how to EU worked, it is so bureaucratic I don't have a clue why 48 percent for it
@HudsonRiverCroc Its in a mess because the remainers trying to subvert the referendum result, so that they could later claim, "look its in a mess, we should cancel brexit".
@ProUdin2016 @is_AnythingReal @LovellPropguru @The_ChrisShaw @PeterWard09 @gr8britbreakoff @evde109 @BBCSimonJack @EdConwaySky Its the fault of all those trying to stop brexit, including the majority of   the uk parliament, the prime minister's blackstop deal, and EU's institutions that control the brexit process
@FHS_SW1 @annasoubrymp Its only because of the remain elements in the uk parliament, EU, and May's deal that brexit is in a mess
@thebuilddoctor @AmberRuddHR She is trying to overturn the democratic vote of exiting the EU, if it was up to her she would cancel brexit, she should be out of her job!
@nickreeves9876 Well actually her track record is letting in as much immigrants as possible and trying to prevent Brexit from happening
@jdpoc I agree, just get rid of those remainers and we'll be ok
@lunaperla @theresa_may Only you are putting party above country I meant to say
@lunaperla @theresa_may Sorry, to tell you but 17.4 million people voted for article 50, only you are putting county above party. Although actually you can make the better argument that both are trying to stop brexit to comply with party interests.

It should be on the type of brexit deal which bests delivers that brexit voted for. Remain cannot be an option because of the result of the 1st Ref

@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr I am actually American from Queens, where he is from, lol
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr The rise of the right in those counties is a result of the EU taking democracy away from those countries
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr What you are trying to do is to make an example of us so that no one else think dares to leave their club
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr ü§£What you are talking about, for real
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr Yes, but if we were on our own couldn't we do the same thing like the EU did, expect with us actually in control
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr Well, these are just words of emotions so I don't think I should take you seriously
@uelmendrado @d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr Actually, If you don't want to trade with the US, the UK can decide not to, but if the EU negotiates a deal with the US which almost happened through TTIP we would have no control over American companies taking over things like the NHS, with us having much say
@WatchPopulistIr @d1ckyr @ElectionMapsUK @Survation Well you just named named one of the main reasons why we left the EU, and that it is much more easier if you can negotiate our own trade deals outside the EU
@uelmendrado @WatchPopulistIr @d1ckyr this logic makes no sense at all, just look at countries some counties outside of the EU and you apply the same standards are any country around the world
@WatchPopulistIr @d1ckyr @ElectionMapsUK @Survation Can you clarify what your saying because you make no sense at all
@WatchPopulistIr @d1ckyr @ElectionMapsUK @Survation yes, the EU's car and aviation industries, but if you want to be a member of the EU, why would you want to be apart of an organization that is willing to be anything in their power to punish us by leaving their groups (this includes tariffs, that they can very well make low).
@WatchPopulistIr @d1ckyr @ElectionMapsUK @Survation No, its a trouble that leaves us half in and half out of the EU,  which in reality that half in the EU we have no say whatsoever, and the opposition would look very weak as a result
@d1ckyr @WatchPopulistIr @ElectionMapsUK @Survation there might be a tariff, be that would be the EU's fault which would actually hurt their economy more than the UK's and the German automotive industry would be most impacted, so it is not in their best interests to have high tariffs in place

@AndyFarnham @JordanUhl well he may be wrong about the argument, but its not racist, when he mentions dirtier, well first off if bring in more people of any background and bring them into America, it adds to unemployment which results in trash in the streets
@MFJones1618 @JordanUhl This is not an objective point I am making, What I am saying is that there is a creditable argument he mentions, and that when he brings up immigrants making America "Poorer and dirtier" it goes right along with the argument
@JordanUhl I really can't find any fault in what Tucker is saying. He is saying that economically poor and uneducated immigrants would hurt the U.S economy in terms so lower wages and limiting jobs to the poor and unskilled that are U.S citizens. Thus making America "poorer and dirtier"

@DocumentsC @kyliemaclellan What I mean is
@DocumentsC @kyliemaclellan What I is, if the UK had voted to remain, it should be just that and the next day we would be EU members, however the Uk has voted for Brexit, so you have to wait like at least 5 years in order to have second referendum
@kyliemaclellan For JRM, calling for a 2nd ref is not anti-democratic because nothing will change if we stay EU, you can have another one in 10 years time, Lucas wants a 2nd ref to stop the brexit process, I am sure JRM would be fine having a 2nd ref to rejoin or stay out, but many years later
@kyliemaclellan Walk right into that one, really! Any person can figure this one out, in terms of thinking ahead of the 1st referendum, a remainer would mark down down on a piece of paper, in the event of a brexit outcome, we go for a 2nd ref, in the event of a remain outcome, no need to think!

@Ruyf actually, there was a second shot at the replay which showed that watson fumbled the ball a second time but on the ground, which means despite the fumble you saw, which should have been overturned, it wasn't the one that actually knocked the ball out

@BautistaBomb @politicsluo yes and proving my earlier point that something is fishy
@CATargetBot all these seats flipping is so weird, I hope this is not getting rigged
@BautistaBomb @politicsluo there different for three reasons to consider, 1) Alot of there election day vote is still being reported, and its only at 100% 2) McAdams is likely going to take back the lead 3) In the other races, the vote was reported to be 100% done, but more is still coming in
@politicsluo because they witnessed an election in which so many seats were flipped after weeks of counting the votes

@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson I know right, the GOP did much better than expected in the state of Florida thus probably also did better among Hispanics
@politicsluo he's actually kind of libertarian minded and he's well principled, but of course I degree with his economics
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson multiple polls before the election also showed a narrow gap between Nelson and Scott when it comes to Latinos, if you are a Democrat you better hope Reps did good with Hispanics, because if they done poorly with them and still won, what if they better with those ethnicities
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson There was big movement of white educated women from Trump to Nelson, actually white people overall moved more democratic as well as highly black turnout helped boost their side, but Hispanics overall when it came to percentage went more in favor to the GOP than two years ago
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson I meant to say: probably meaning indies overall are split between the Dem and Rep candidate, in which leads to the question: what percentage of indies are PRs, thats all I'm saying
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson it there is proof that most PRs are registered as NPAs, and NPAs were probably split in half between both Gillum and DeSantis and Soctt and Nelson, the question becomes what percentage of them makes up the NPAs
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson the same can be said of the 62% you mentioned, but its hard to say because thousands of PRs are coming each year
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson Orange county went 62% for Nelson, but you have to include the surrounding counties, but even if the 38% were mostly PRs, that would be good for the Reps, and make sense as Cubans break almost the opposite way resulting in Latinos going Dem 54-45
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson Orlando has seen the most increase of Puerto Ricans and they are registering as NPA
@jude_scout @reggie_lee1 @guypbenson well thats a given, but he also did well with Puerto Ricans im which most are independents
@DCRangersFan @DrewSutton20 good example, any others you can think of, especially house races
@DCRangersFan @DrewSutton20 I look at like races whether they are close or not, but my point is the difference being seen between the day after election night, by my logic a seat can be 52-48 and go down to 51-49, but I have seen alot of seats go from 58-42 to 53-47, so it doesn't have to competitive
@DrewSutton20 how the heck did the Democrats flip this race and many others weeks later, can you name other seats in past elections that flipped weeks later election day ?

@athein1 @sunhawk02 @LarrySchweikart Do you think that the cumulative is counting the rurals while the week 2 data does not? Which means that it will not go below 22k because its already been counted

@athein1 And Nye's absentees are missing
@athein1 When will all of yesterday's EV come in already?
@athein1 So dem lead will be under 13.2k tomorrow?
@athein1 Ralston is actually getting very nervous at the turnout today in Clark, and it was he only reported there were 17k at 3pm PDT

@alltimehighdebt @LarrySchweikart @athein1 ED actually went to dems in 2016 123k to 121k, but Rs net gained a bunch of many voters from the indies or other, which resulted in a net gain of 22k on ED
@BeyondFables @clmcheesy23 @WordSlingerAD @pml_tray @bae_miami @RalstonReports @NateSilver538 Well, if its a very small sample size as is, its a democrat poll oversampling democrats, because registration favors democrats. Bottom line we shouldn't believe the the two-point dem lead either
@BeyondFables @clmcheesy23 @WordSlingerAD @pml_tray @bae_miami @RalstonReports @NateSilver538 No, you are missing the point, just based on the early vote between reps and dems, if a margin of 14% exists among indies, Heller is going to win
@LarrySchweikart @alltimehighdebt @athein1 based on the data you just laid out, Heller would win by 6k because you take that 20k net gain made on ED take 80% of it and subtract it from the 10k lead for the dems, resulting in 10,000 - 16,000 = -6,000
@BeyondFables @clmcheesy23 @WordSlingerAD @pml_tray @bae_miami @RalstonReports PPP is a liberal poll, and if its showing Heller ahead by 14 points with indies, thats a major problem for the dems! WOW this is really good for the Rs and means that they are at least a couple of points ahead!
@bae_miami @clmcheesy23 @pml_tray @RalstonReports NYTimes shows Heller leading by 9% with indies
@RalstonReports 734 vote difference
@athein1 Which side is up more? Taking account percentage difference and raw vote difference independently
@athein1 You said you expected it to lower to 11.5k, but its now at 11.1k
@tylerjwatsonlv @butterfly_bees @RalstonReports @GovSandoval He should change his name to Jon Maddow Ralston
@athein1 they have corrected Douglas county's Absent/Mailing Precinct Ballots it was Dem: 101 Rep: 71 and Other: 195, flip Rs and indies
@athein1 its actually down to 11,125
@athein1 But the Rs are only doing one percent better in the rural areas
@athein1 Ralston says the Dems have to get at least a 35,000 firewall from Clark, in order for them to win statewide. However, he said the GOP should get nervous if the firewall becomes 40,000+
@athein1 @LSATtutor @RalstonReports https://t.co/mb3iFqmVM5
@RalstonReports Ok, Jon Maddow Ralston
@politicsluo @UgaritNoosphere @RalstonReports No, its not, Dems have to a net gain of 22k in order for them to compete in the final results
RT @athein1: The current state of the NV EV.  The solid blue line is the one to pay most attention.  Now, it's at 12k.  For Dems to have an‚Ä¶
@athein1 why 22k,  @RalstonReports already thinks its lost for the GOP
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer @RalstonReports has some great analysis on this
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer In midterms its all about who shows up to vote, but it this election its more like a presidential year than your normal midterm
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer It may be a little more whiter than two years ago, but its not about demographics, its about democrats and republicans showing up to vote, and indies are down because they are less engaged in politics overall.
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer remember the 2.4 percent margin includes independents and also this midterm is going to be 80% of 2016, so petty much the same type of electorate as two years ago
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer that is 3.6 percentage higher, and Hillary won Nevada by 2.4 percent, so that would result in a Heller +1.2 win, but that discounts turnout
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer now with that said do last week and part of this week and is 51.9 to 48.1 in favor of the dems
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer that 53.7 to 46.3 being in 2016
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer In using the same method of taking out the independents and combining the weeks early vote it was 53.7 to 46.3 in favor of the dems, keep that mind
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer well hold on I am doing more math, as I am trying figure that types of percentages needed in the early vote
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer In taking out independents and only dealing with week one of early vote	in 2016 the margin for dems as 54.4 to 45.6 and in 2018 its 50.9 to 49.1 in favor of the dems
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer wait, I am trying to do some math
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer ignore the numbers and in just dealing with percentages in 2016 the percentages were 42.49%, 35.63%, 21.88% in favor of the dems
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer What are you talking about the dems right now lead by 11k, and since the dems won election day last time round, take 75% to 80% of the net gain made on election day and add it to the dems and that is your result for 2018
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer 2016 In Person Early Voting: Dems: 298,454, Reps: 250,272	2016 Election Day: Dems: 123,763, Reps: 121,057	Where is the 72k your talking about, plus dems won election day
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer how please maybe I don't understand
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer it wasn't a 72k margin, it was 48k which if you include the Absent/Mailing Precinct Ballots is down to 44k, and dems won on election by 2k
@LSATtutor @MichaelENewton1 @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer How, please explain to me!
@MichaelENewton1 @LSATtutor @JC_Marcotte @Garrett_Archer Nevada is looking more doubtful for Heller

@politicsluo lol, Suozzi has 1.6 dollars in hand, and his opponent has 10,00 dollars only, in a red wave or blue wave nothing should change that, so in reality, Martins was outspent by 1.2 million, and Dan de Dono is only down a little more than 100,000 dollars in fundraising, Wow!
@gelliottmorris Beto only has an 11 point in Hispanics, what was Hillary Clinton's lead of which group in Texas?

@politicsluo Dan DeBono I think is a better candidate than Jack Martins, and progressives don't like Suozzi because of voting history
@politicsluo He stands for liberty and the constitution, he is not a hypocrite like other Republicans. My honorable mentions would be Rand Paul and Ted Cruz

@lookner based on the writing of the travel ban, it only bans Muslims and not all people from the counties on the ban. People may look at that as discrimination against a religious group and if it was really based on security everyone from the country of Syria should be banned.

@michaeld021 @Mets @JdeGrom19 LET THE LOSING BEGIN!
@74Astros How many double plays do the Astros have this season, oh and by the way Springer is really good at baseball!
@74Astros Gurriel is good at baseball!
@michaeld021 Yes I am at the game!
@74Astros The rockets need to atleast do something in the draft the greatest teams in basketball come through the draft and then get a great free agent AFTER PROVING SOMETHING like the warriors
@74Astros Apperantly you love Segura so much as a SS, I think we can both agree that we should switch him in a trade with Correa, wouldn't that be a good idea, right?
@74Astros live in New York, I just witnessed Stanton lift a above team all the way the world series, what a fun summer ahead https://t.co/WcZiRBtaLj
@74Astros I love Atluve but 7 hrs is why he is not in consideration YET, when it comes to the mvp batting avg is not actually a big factor
@74Astros For me if I had to be honest it's JD
@74Astros Who do you have as mvp currently in the American league, BE HONEST!

@74Astros I'm just saying the way he is playing RIGHT NOW lol
@74Astros as of right now its Gattis and Correa
Final Score Correa 7 McCullers Jr 4 @74Astros
@shaneford43 @Sweeps2032 @TheRightScoop List the sources please?
@JohnnieMo ok, but can you just give us the score through various points?
@shaneford43 @JohnnieMo now can I have the link to where you found this out?

@74Astros I agree, but what I am afraid of is that it will destroy his confidence stepping out to the plate
@ElectionMapsUK  https://t.co/NdERzrrX6r
@74Astros wow then that's only his second error this year, Lindor has 10 errors and Segura has 9, but oh but look STASSI!
@74Astros it's like the first error he has given up this season, give him a break
IT'S ON! Today @jimmykimmel takes on @tedcruz for charity and I'm #TeamCruz. RETWEET if you are too! #KimmelvsCruz #TeamCruz #CruzToVictory
@ElectionMapsUK Can you also do a map showing if the swing in the by election were to take place in all of the U.K.
@ElectionMapsUK How is this possible, if it were a safe Tory with them losing 8 percent and labour losing much more, proportionally it would benefit the Tories much more than labour in Lewisham east in the opposite effect
@ElectionMapsUK @JoeHarmerLD To me the actual swing is more important than proportionally the difference because if it were a safe Tory seat both factors would be to their advantage
@dabbs346 he said he would wait until the primary was over, and works with the freedom caucus every day despite being in the upper chamber of Congress
@dabbs346 he's not a "freedom caucus member" because they only accept house members and yes he did endorse him in round one of the primary before the runoff
@dabbs346 you are right technically, however, if you are talking about who he supported in the primaries I believe he supported Mo Brooks a fellow freedom caucus member
@dabbs346 they were all long shot underdogs, except for Roy Moore which Paul pulled his endorsement for
@ChadPergram actually, I got my math wrong too, lol
@ChadPergram 10:30 am to 2:30 is 3 hours

@Pat_Dwy3r @BreakingNews @AP it wasn't the economic stimulus that helped balanced the economy
@Pat_Dwy3r @BreakingNews @AP It was really thanks to the Republican congress particularly the house of reps, which was taken over in 2010, and it got really better after the Republicans took over the Senate. Trump and Obama are not really responsible for this improvement.
@michaeld021 it's obvious that Harper is better the Cabrera, the stats you put in the poll are poorly misleading, you should really take into account on-base percentage and RBIs

@ElectionMapsUK So it's a multiple cllr ward, if so, the map did not show that, or maybe there was a by-election from last year, and so therefore it should be considered a Con win?

@michaeld021 are they west of the operational
Some of these are bombs, P003 or P010 would be great!!! @michaeld021 https://t.co/uR4QqOI2dz
@crankywxguy does a secondary low form?
@AMSweather @crankywxguy This is super cold air, a storm closer would bring in dynamic cooling, maybe if the airmass was starting to leave but that's not happening
@crankywxguy 40/70 is not even close enough, so what are you talking about?
When do you never go to bed? @LeeGoldbergABC7
Your brother really really dislikes @realDonaldTrump, what do you make of that and knowing your stance as well @Piers_Corbyn
It seems like a secondly low was trying to develop but never could @michaeld021
@michaeld021 show me because to my eyes it is slightly NW!!!!!
Euro matches the navgem if not better but from the position of where it is at, you want a second low to develop
EURO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @michaeld021
hr 102 on euro is slightly NW of 12z!!!!! @michaeld021
hr 102 on euro is slightly NW of 12z
Euro not looking too bad, there is also phasing at hour 78 @michaeld021
@michaeld021 https://t.co/p7zUS64X7I
@michaeld021 it's east of the benchmark, close though, but if you take a look at my pic you will see the center of the low is east maybe just south of the 40/70 point, which the grid clearly shows
NAVGEM looks to be more west of 18z!!!!!!! @michaeld021 https://t.co/PQOBtN1RjS

@AccuRayno if let's say it is up the coast, what is more likely for Queens, NY		a) a glancing blow		b) major snowstorm
watching Trace McSorley throw an int @michaeld021
yes, I know ots is still a possibility, but the most western arrow you drew was still way out to sea  @Empire_Weather
Why did you make that storm track area so far to the east @Empire_Weather

@crankywxguy If so NYC 2-3 inches?
@michaeld021 the Patriots seem to be cheating away all our snow, what else is new?
@michaeld021 I personally think Rosen is more NFL ready, and that he did well on a UCLA team that was not 100% healthy or fully stacked with talent
By the way, who is going to draft the sometimes disappointing JT Barrett? @michaeld021
@michaeld021 are those red numbers offshore potential low pressures? If so, they gave them the last two digits, without labeling them next to a 9 or 10, like for example 96 should be 996, right?
By the way, I honestly hope the Giants or even the Jets don't draft Darnold. I'm not saying he can't be a great player someday, just wouldn't be my first choice   @michaeld021
Beside the point that USC sucks as well as Darnold performance thus far, here's an even closer closer look at the UKIE  @michaeld021 https://t.co/QtpPLP4K8Z
@michaeld021 The Euro was the on the eastern end of Long Island when it showed the storm. However, the strength of storm I think matters somewhat because if it were to bomb out in the process.........it would be omg
Yet here's an even better look, just needs to be a lower pressure and a tad bit west, unless you are on the east end of LI 	@michaeld021 https://t.co/9BFcY75HtW
Ukie not upside down and low looks to be right on top of cape cod, but its hard to tell  	@michaeld021 https://t.co/zD43ggP8rs

@crankywxguy the only way you get cyclogenesis is if the trof you have it at were more south otherwise it remains flat and happens way out to sea
@crankywxguy @LagoudakisManny trof must dig or else cyclogenesis won't happen in the first place, or else the highest anyone will get is a C-1
@crankywxguy don't *use*
@crankywxguy then don't the word cyclogenesis
@crankywxguy should we be looking at the mid lattitude temperatures though?  also, "cyclogenesis" is broad and what you are explaining is just one type of evolution.  there are other ways to get the low to bomb out
@Bucks looks like Berlin during the cold war
@crankywxguy thanks for the clarification, but can you outline possible storm tracks as well
@crankywxguy are you saying one of those scenarios is a lake cutter? Can you also resent a more clear map of the United States
