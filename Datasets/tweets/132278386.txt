Unemployment insurance is a social contract &amp; a social compact people pay into so it’s there when they need it.

If we’re going to end sexual assault in military, must start by ending it at institutions that train future leaders. http://t.co/Lk8vUahVV9
Service academies should be a point of prevention in stopping illegal &amp; unethical behavior. Cadets &amp; midshipmen learn from their leaders.

RT if you think we can’t wait another 50 yrs to fulfill the promise of  #EqualPay Act. We’ve made progress but we need more! #FairPay
Let’s suit up, square our shoulders, put on our lipstick &amp; fight for #FairPay! Congress needs to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act now!
#PaycheckFairness not just for our pocketbooks. It’s about family checkbooks &amp; getting it right in the law books. #FairPay
My #PaycheckFairness Act builds on  promise of landmark #EqualPay Act &amp; ensures equal pay for equal work! #FairPay http://t.co/NpEMxS7dyo
In 1963, women earned 59¢ for every $. Today after 50 yrs, it’s just 77¢ – costing women &amp; families $434K over their careers. #FairPay
The 50th anniversary of the #EqualPay Act is cause for celebration &amp; a reason to redouble our efforts. #FairPay
50 years ago, President Kennedy signed historic Equal Pay Act with goal of ending gender pay discrimination in the workplace. #FairPay
We want #EqualPay for equal work, and we want it now. I’m calling on Congress to take up &amp; pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.
When #EqualPay Act signed in 1963, women made 59 cents for every $. Today it’s 77 cents. 50 yrs for 18 cents isn’t good enough.
I agree with President @BarackObama, 50 yrs after Equal Pay Act, we’ve seen progress, but we need more. #EqualPay
Please help support I [heart] Equal Pay!, add a #Twibbon now! http://t.co/dMzpQwJi7n

Politics of brinkmanship, shutdown, showdown, slamdown must end-that's what we're trying to do by passing a CR &amp; preventing a gov't shutdown
I think #ObamaCare is a great name for what we did in health care reform. Because President Obama does care
And #ObamaCare made sure preventive care like access to mammograms for women and early detection and screening for children
ObamaCare ended gender discrimation in health care, ended discrimination against people-especially children-  with pre-existing conditions

I am committed to helping communities hit hard by #Sandy &amp; will make enacting a supplemental bill an urgent priority in new Congress.
It is long past time communities in MD, NY, NJ &amp; across nation get resources &amp; support they need from their federal government.
As Chairwoman of @SenateApprops, I’m deeply disappointed House failed 2 act on emergency relief from Super-Storm #Sandy http://t.co/D2xQTYA6
Wishing all a safe and happy new year - especially our troops serving overseas and their families here at home
Will discuss fiscal cliff on Senate floor @ 2 p.m. -- Watch live on CSPAN 2
But clock is ticking-been two months since Sandy hit. Businesses need restarting. Homes need rebuilding. Now up to House to pass bill ASAP
Shows that in America, we are all in this together – that when one community is hit by a disaster, all communities are hit.
Critical legislation provides well-tailored resources to those hit hardest by Sandy.
Senate just passed the Superstorm Sandy Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill in strong, bipartisan vote
American families already are stretched and strained. Why should they pay $7 for milk because House won’t act
House Republicans need to come home in from pasture, get back to Washington, pass the Farm Bill and avoid the dairy cliff
Dock workers and Port able to come together to avoid a strike – need Congress to do same thing and avoid fiscal cliff
Good news for families, jobs and economy– Port strike averted with 30 day extension

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Newton community as we struggle to cope with such senseless violence.
Today our nation mourns for those lost and the families that have been shattered by this devastating tragedy.

Time to put aside differences, come to the table to negotiate in good faith &amp; get the job done.
We've made serious &amp; significant cuts already including $917B over 10 yrs in Budget Control Act.
Need a more frugal gov that will reduce deficit &amp; debt, but only things that caused debt &amp; deficit shld be on the table.
We've reformed Medicare thru Obamacare - took $500B in guaranteed profits from ins companies extending life of Medicare by 8 yrs.
Medicare &amp; Medicaid pay for life-saving health care for elderly, children &amp; families.
If you play by the rules &amp; pay your dues, you deserve Social Security benefit that is reliable, undeniable &amp; inflation proof.
Social Security didn't get us in this mess &amp; shldn't be on the table. We must protect Social Contract between American people &amp; their gov.
Families who have earned benefits of Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security shldn't be targeted &amp; forced over their own fiscal cliff.
Pieces are in place to prevent fiscal cliff crisis. We've had ideas from all sides, now is time to come together &amp; prevent disaster.
