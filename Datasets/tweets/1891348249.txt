@NHASolent @UKLabour @sarahollando552 @theuneasyreaper @mpb The only problem is that if the government prints too much money (which could happen given the expenses of a socialized system), then you will devalue your currency which is not backed by anything, and trigger a recession because foreign commodities will be too expensive to buy.
@UKLabour I like that she‚Äôs calling out how it‚Äôs not working, but I really disagree with her solution. Socialized healthcare inevitably results in the government having to ration care, and since not a lot of money can be made in that profession, there will be less people in it. #freemarket
