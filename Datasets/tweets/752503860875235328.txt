@tedlieu is an embarrassment.  He thinks false accusations are a funny game.  Embarrassing that an elected representative doesn't even know there is no crime called collusion.  Just repeating what he hears others say.  No brain. https://t.co/LkVNUaGLlR
@CNN Breaking:  Female reporters make a conscious decision to ignore trafficking of women and children, instead listen to handsome man talk about Cohen.	@DanaBashCNN @BrookeBCNN
@tedlieu can you actually name a lie?  You know people can see how stupid you are. https://t.co/k3AFDqH8S8
@OperaNowPodcast @realDonaldTrump That explains it.  If you had to pay for it yourself, you would have taken it more seriously.

@Acosta should spend a week at a location without a wall.  Thanks for proving walls work by showing no one was trying to get in where the wall existed.
How does it feel to be spied on without a warrant? https://t.co/hPtZyyEOMR
@PattyMurray Then why won't @TheDemocrats negotiate on the wall?
@OperaNowPodcast @realDonaldTrump All that money, and all you ended up with was ad homimem attacks.  I think you should try to get your tuition money back.

@OperaNowPodcast @realDonaldTrump Great comeback.  Shows lots of intelligence.  Clearly highly educated.
@tedlieu How would you describe turning a blind eye to human trafficking? https://t.co/nmA5Y6QNC0
@SenatorCardin Please let the illegals in, so they can undercut the union negotiated wages of the American workers.  It makes so much more sense for companies to be able to negotiate the lowest employee wages instead of being held hostage by unions. https://t.co/yLlzZAzy76
@OperaNowPodcast @WSJ @realDonaldTrump Yeah.  Because finding the one tunnel means nothing comes in any other way.  Because some people go underground, nobody goes through the open land?  Sound logic.
Well, @tedlieu and @lisamurkowski, it looks like you're in the minority.  Americans hired @realDonaldTrump to protect our border.  Thanks @POTUS! https://t.co/MOxLQLw50b

@SenDuckworth wants more human trafficking!
Are @TheDemocrats worried the wall will make it harder to get new sex slaves?
@SenSchumer, why did you change your mind about the wall?  Why don't you want to stop human trafficking?
@NancyPelosi "why would he not do that?"  Because you didn't include a wall.  Aren't you paying attention?  How as Hawaii?
@donlemon just gave Obama credit for Trump's progress on the wall.
@donlemon reminds me of a kid who found a video camera and makes a pretend news show in his mom's basement.
