@AlleghenyCoDA What is the standard procedure for white terrorist arrests?
@AlleghenyCoDA How is it that an active shooter terrorist can make it to trial, but an African American child fleeing is executed?
@sapientsapien @SixtyFourBox @MarkWarner *insignificant, obvious memory.
@sapientsapien @SixtyFourBox @MarkWarner So I admit, I exaggerated. After all the news about Trump turning my hair gray, this is a pretty miniscule memory.
@sapientsapien @SixtyFourBox @MarkWarner https://t.co/hTO6MHAaF4 	If you watched YouTube like i suggested, you would have known about this about a year ago. But nice try.
@nothxci @superwrench4 @WatergateII @tsdynomite @PeplowThor @dbongino Its almost as though they dont know any 3 syllable words, quite like DT.
@sapientsapien @SixtyFourBox @MarkWarner Did you google it? Sinclair Broadcast Group. Or the YouTube video of them all saying the same sentence? 	https://t.co/FtPBpxVaxX	There, you don't even need to read.
@SixtyFourBox @sapientsapien @MarkWarner Well did you?
@SixtyFourBox @sapientsapien @MarkWarner You cant do anything other than insult us because we have facts! Hahahahahah! I love this part! Prove me wrong then. Truly, on anything I've said.
@SixtyFourBox @sapientsapien @MarkWarner Its called google.
@SixtyFourBox @sapientsapien @MarkWarner Its called google.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Good luck with that whole insulting people when you don't have anything else to say. I'm sure it'll get you far kid.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Just google Sinclaire Broadcast Group. That would be all your fake and scripted news. Perhaps try John Oliver, the Economist, The Young Turks etc. People not on mainstream controlled TV brainwashing everyone. Otherwise you will just keep getting the approved script.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Those are all fake and conservative sites. I'm concerned that you have all the names memorized. The only major one you missed was Fox News.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Says the person who started this whole thread with whataboutism and insults. We will see who gets the last laugh, I just hope you remember how ridiculous you sounded here.
@SixtyFourBox @sapientsapien @MarkWarner The Uranium one deal? You mean the one signed by every head of state department?
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Yeah, Putin has been doing really well in the press. So just because you get your news from conservative sites and I look at global news definitely shows that I am the unread idiot. They also aren't accusing him of murder, just rape, money laundering, involvement in foreign govt.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner Your idiocy is not worth my time. You will be eating your words soon enough. Keep in mind the internet never forgets, and it will remember who was on the wrong side of history. And you can google how Putin handles the press on your own time. Quite masterfully in comparison to DT.
@sapientsapien @MarkWarner I would at the very least be able to control myself in public. Quite like how Putin has been brushing off this whole Russian meddling thing. I wouldn't constantly bring it up. At least I have enough intelligence for that.
@MarkWarner It's like he is scared or something.

@amyklobuchar Then stop trying to lump other things in with this bill! The republicans hold the majority and this their fault!
@CNNSitRoom Seeing as the Republicans are in the majority, this is your fault and nothing you say can change the numbers.
