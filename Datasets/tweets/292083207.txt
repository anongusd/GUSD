Pro tip @BryanSteilforWI. The guy who's trying to cut over $541 billion from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid doesn't get to talk about how much they care about protecting our earned benefits.

.@BryanSteilforWI wants to cut working Americans' Social Security to pay for corporate tax cuts. He's a corporate lawyer fighting for corporate America. He has no idea what working people need.

CEOs got a 17% pay raise in 2017 while working people got just 0.2%. Rather than do something to help the rest of us though, Republicans gave a $1.5 trillion tax cut to their CEO donors instead.		Working people won't forget the way the @GOP sold us out.	https://t.co/zcnCdlSWn0
The good news: More than 714,000 Midwesterners work a clean energy job.		The bad news: OH, MI, IL, &amp; IN are beating Wisconsin for the most clean energy jobs in the Midwest.		Wisconsin can't miss out on the jobs of the future. We need a Green New Deal.	https://t.co/ABMzgfIEWl
