#Volcano--I recently commended about earthquakes/volcanoes.  I feel that the underground testing of nuclear bombs by Korea may have triggered these events. United Nations should ban all future underground bomb testing.
#To families &amp; students--The reason my one tweet said that students need 2 have special accounts is because here n Atlanta last week we had 4 students killed after their graduation 4 their money.  We have deadbeats who would kill 4 money whether than work.  Remember Karma
# the Bradford file &amp; Trump--Trump keeps trying 2 send the Russian invasion 2 someone else when it is his family that met with the Russians.  Trump should just fess up like a man &amp; admit his mistake.  Quit trying 2 make someone else take the blame.
#Trump/Sessions--You r vile evil creatures who take innocent people trying 2 escape horrible circumstances &amp; tear their families apart.  I hope you suffer as much as they suffer.  God does not like ugly.
#Parents--It seems that 2 give money 4 graduation must b put n the history books.  We must set up bank accounts 2  send money 4 presents because of greedy people that cannot stand 2 see someone else have something.  They don't know 2 work 4 something.
#Schools--What if we hire x military 2 guard our kids while n school.  We have lots of military who r returning from war &amp; we have lots of schools. needing protection.  Some schools still need metal protectors.
Here we go again--the last I heard on today's school shooting is the count is ten died.  It seems that we have a shooting every couple of days.  I know that Trump will say that we must stop the killings.  Why don't we put guards at schools instead of the walls?
Sorry but I have been the hospital with a bad heart.  I am heart broken because a teenage boy died 4 he could not afford insulin.  We must put politics &amp; immigration 2 the side when dealing with children.  Medicine has gotten so expensive.  We must make it more affordable.
#To people who cares--Trump did 2 Puerto Rico what Bush did 2 Katrina.  Nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#Earthquake Watch-I have been trying 2 remember when North Korea set off its underground bomb testing.  It could have disrupted the earth plates, setting off these earthquakes.  The volcano erupting is earth's way of letting off pressure.  There's a lesson 2 b learned.
#Earthquake Watch--Well, I was alittle off 4 I thought the earthquake pattern would stay on the Ring of Fire but it took a detour &amp; hit the Hawaiian Iślands.  The islands are in the Pacific so I guess the earth plates of the Pacific are being disrupted.
#Federal Government--I did a book report on what we paid out 4 foteign aid n 1961.  I cannot believe that we have not learned anything since then.  We give out money 2 countries that hate us.  R we so insecure?
#FEMA--At last we found out about the Brown woman who was given the contract 2 feed Puerto Rica 4 $156 million.  She was paid $255 thousand dollars 4 delivery of spoiled food.  Who hired this con artist 2 represent FEMA?  U should b ashamed of yourself.
#Amazon--I am sorry 2 hear that u took Atlanta out of the running 4 your new plant because of a couple of our close minded fools.  Atlanta has alot 2 offer.  We r close 2 so many transport avenues-rail, air, &amp; highway.  We have lots of employable people, also.
#To the gay &amp; transgender community--I have been friends with your community since the 1960's.  I cannot understand in this day &amp; age why people cannot accept u.  I hope whoever is writing those hate letters at Spelman get caught.
#Trump--U may not believe n global warming but it is real, just ask your friend, Putin.  Ask him about Siberia melting &amp; North Pole being warner than Atlanta?  Drinking water is running low.  Everyone needs 2 turn water off when brushing teeth.
#Government--I recently read that we are paying billions of $ 2 some countries &amp; they r converting some of the money 2 Isis. Where r our checklists 2 prevent this from happening?  It seems we r buying guns 4 the enemy 2 kill our soldiers.
#Trump  i am concerned over the fact that a pattern has developed--first-a bunch of train wrecks, then a bunch of semi wrecks, military plane wrecks, now the van wrecks r starting again.  Do I c a terror attack in the works?
#Ambassadors--My most important  environmental concern is the protection of animals.  If I had the money I would hire groups around the  world 2 help save these animals.  There r some heartless monsters out there.  We must protect animals so they will b with us.
#Trump--U. cannot blame Comey 4 your mistakes.  U became president in the way u did all of your business dealings--u just bulliied your way n.  What u did not realize was that u had millions of people following u.  U had better change your business tactics.
We r talking about slavery again because of Starbucks.  When r these CEOs going 2 start teaching their employees race relations?  The military has been teaching race relations since the 70s.  It is ridiculous in this day &amp; age 2 hear of such things.
#Trump--U did good with Syria but it doesn't let u off the hook with Russia or Stormy Daniels.  U have alot 2 answer 2 before we can trust u.   U can't run the presidental office with just your family.
I wish people would not release balloons into the air 4 they kill birds,    fishes, &amp; other.creatures.  Other things that kill these crearures r fish lines, plastic 6-pack holders, &amp; plastic bags.  They cause horrible deaths.
#Syria  &amp; Russia--U both should b ashamed of yourselves 4 let another chemical attack on innocent women &amp; childeen.  Syria, U say u didnt do it, right, u just let Russia do it 4 u.  It is an act of being a rat coward.
#Earthquake--I was afraid that another earthquake would occur in California again.  The Ring of Fire will continue, probably 2 Alaska but it might skip across the Pacific 2 Asia.  Thank God no one got hurt.
#consmover--I am replying 2 your comment about liberals killing more people than conservatives but I beg 2 differ 4 a recent report said that most of the mass killings &amp; endangered animal killings were all conservatives, as far as could b confirmed.
#guardian--U should b ashamed 4 using those pictures of fat women when talking about sugar, etc.  I am fat &amp; it is no fun being fat.  I would love 2 lose weight but, at least it keeps the men away.  U should b more sensitive but.u r republican.
#China--Please b patient 4 we have   a president who wants 2 destroy our country, 1 piece at  time.  I firmly believe that he plans 2 make lt a twin, Germany.  Republicans think he has something else on his mind. I hope I am wrong!   Remember his past family ties.
#I lost some followers since I mentioned my Jewish &amp; my Christian friends but I also have Oriental, Muslim, &amp; African friends.  Remember that I drove a cab 4 over 15 years.  This is what is wrong with the world, no one is happy with their  territory, they always want more.
#Happy Easter Everyone--Please b safe this holiday weekend.  Remember--If u get a bunny this Easter take good care of it &amp; clean up after it.  Bunnies make good pets, just learn it's diet. &amp; keep it out of harm"s way.  Be safe driving!!!
#Police--I made a tweet earlier about the police shooting 2 kill but I want 2 tell u that I know that.u have a very stressful job that entails situations  where u never know what u.r walking into 4 I drove a taxi 4 15 years.  My brother was killed while driving a taxi.
#Trump--I was really impressed with u when u insisted we have a big budget 4 the military but the news today showed your true colors.  U just wanted the money 4 that stupid wall, the wall that people will dig under or climb over.   U r very crafty 2 say the least.
#To all US Citizens--I am totally outraged over the continuous killings of citizens by police.  I realize that there r circumstances where u have 2 shoot but so many times why can't u shoot them in a leg but not kill them??
#Trump--U grew up rich &amp; your father left u $15 million when he died so it is hard 4 u 2 not 2 act like a spoiled brat.  I am sure that your opinion of women is low on your list.   Do I believe the women over u, of course I do?  U need 2 have more respect 4 us.
Retweet--I was called away before my tweet about earthquakes.  A few weeks ago we had a few quakes starting n California &amp; going around thr Ring of Fire, ending n Mexico.  Thank God  it ended there.  California has been through so much this year.
#To the students of America--Congratuations on your march 4 a ban on assault weapons, age limits, &amp; mental health issues.  Saturday will b a great day 4 your march but don't get your hopes up 2 much 4 these politicans r seasoned.  I am very proud of u.  March on!
#Trump--I knew that u would find some way 2 get people's minds off of u calling Putin.  U r a smart businessman.  I think back on all of the news making events of the past &amp; how u controlled the news.  Again, touche'.
#Trump &amp; The Brown Thief--When r u going 2 do something 2 this Brown woman who stole $156 million dollars from FEMA?   This woman got away with this money &amp; left the people of Puerto Rico hungry.  They r still suffering!   R u going 2 just let her get away?
