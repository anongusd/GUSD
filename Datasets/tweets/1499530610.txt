The kids and families of #Parkland became the change they wanted to see in the fight to #EndGunViolence in America.

Our hearts are still healing over Sandy Hook. In the inaction that followed, Congress hit a new low. Born of that grief, Sandy Hook Promise @sandyhook and @NewtownAction took up the fight to #EndGunViolence. Their tireless advocacy made passing #HR8 and #HR1112 possible!
Founded when public tragedy turned into a personal calling to save lives and prevent senseless suffering, @bradybuzz and @GiffordsCourage have been instrumental in the fight to #EndGunViolence and to pass the background checks bills in the House this week! https://t.co/tcQIhMZ6hx
We have a Democratic House Majority that just passed 2 strong bills to help #EndGunViolence because of the hard work and advocacy of groups like the @AFT, @NEAToday, @MomsDemand, and @Everytown. We share their belief that children have a right to be safe to learn in school. https://t.co/7wcUzqV9sy

After voting to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions in their brutal Trumpcare bill, Republicans are claiming they NEVER VOTED TO GUT OUR HEALTH CARE. #ProtectOurCare https://t.co/5xATAWU1WF
Led by Speaker Pelosi, Democrats passed the ACA because many with insurance found they were not covered for specific illnesses when they got sick. The law brought fairness &amp; certainty, giving families peace of mind to know they are covered if they face illness. #ProtectOurCare

Democrats want bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders and creates a path to earned citizenship for immigrants living here who work hard, contribute to our economy, pay taxes and want nothing more than to be U.S. citizens
Our immigration system is broken. That‚Äôs a fact. But it‚Äôs broken because Republicans in Washington have failed to come to the table and work with Democrats towards bipartisan reform. In fact, in 2014, they decided to do nothing
In 2010, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, House Democrats passed the DREAM Act that protects our DREAMers. Republicans killed it in the Senate. In 2013, Democrats passed Comprehensive Immigration Reform; then, Republicans killed it in the House.
Don't forget: there are still over 250 children helplessly stuck in cages, wondering when the Trump Administration will reunite them with their parents. https://t.co/50xy1H57H1

The Republicans promised the tax cuts would benefit all Americans.  In reality, it benefitted the wealthy &amp; corps.  And rather than corporations passing down their windfalls in worker's paychecks, they have used the money for stock buy-backs and dividends. https://t.co/nd2pGGZz73
The Republicans said the tax cut would pay for itself. "the Treasury reported that the 2018 deficit swelled to $779 billion. That level, the highest in six years, marks a 17 percent increase over 2017." https://t.co/HvQE5IpaZV
The tax cut already passed earlier this year did not deliver.  https://t.co/D57AaayDcu

The deficit-exploding #GOPTaxScam for the rich sold out Medicare, Medicaid and the middle class to further enrich big corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent.  Democrats want real, bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, reduces the deficit and is #ForThePeople
üìåWall Street &amp; wealthy corporations have been 1 of the biggest recipients of the GOP‚Äôs massive giveaway, &amp; they're on track to spend $1 trillion on dividends &amp; stock buybacks from the windfall of the tax scam while also announcing 10s of 1000s of layoffs &amp; shipping jobs overseas
üìåBig Pharma companies are reaping massive tax windfalls, while continuing to hike prescription drug prices on seniors and families.		üìåWealthy CEOs are on a private plane buying spree, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
Republicans are deepening the damage done by their original tax scam.  More than 60% of voters say the #GOPTaxScam  will either have a negative impact or no effect at all on their families ‚Äì as the wealthy and well-connected rake in their windfalls https://t.co/5iDKzncp4y
While Republicans enrich their wealthy donors, Democrats are fighting #ForThePeople 	--Lowering health care costs &amp; prescription drug prices;	--Increasing your pay through strong economic growth by rebuilding America;	--Cleaning up corruption to make Washington work for you.
#TaxScam2 will add trillions more to the deficit ‚Äì and Washington Republicans are openly talking about using this new debt to justify devastating cuts to Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Social Security.  https://t.co/g9lgehlb6V
Today, House Republicans are pushing #TaxScam2: their cynical scheme to make tax breaks for billionaires permanent ‚Äì handing tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent every year. https://t.co/uF8HW19eS9

#SexualAssault is not a "distraction."  1 in 5 women will be the victim of rape.  1 in 3 women will be the victim of sexual violence.  These are important issues.  Why not use your power to advocate for women.  Do you care?  Do you do anything? https://t.co/S7iIX30hhw
