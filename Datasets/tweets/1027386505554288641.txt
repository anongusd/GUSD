@EricWolfson Jackson was the first Democrat. Jefferson was a republican (not the same modern Republican Party of Lincoln and Trump). Minor mistake, just felt I needed to point it out.

Heard a great sermon tonight on #1Corinthians 10:23-11:1. Others are watching our actions. They need to see us living lives of Christ, so that they will be brought to Him. Do good things not for your sake, but for those who watch and hunger. They will follow us as we follow Him.
@PreservedBible Furthermore, it’s ironic that this section of Preface argues translated Word is still Word; something that KJV Only-ers can’t seem to figure out. Praying for you brother, that this illogical thinking would be turned away from. Main doctrine and God’s message are most important
@PreservedBible Also from the Preface. They acknowledged the fallibility of human translation. See for yourself: https://t.co/JZwGSY5321 https://t.co/22o6YmIonr
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 From the original KJV preface: “Notwithstanding that some IMPERFECTIONS and BLEMISHES may be noted in the setting forth of it.”	https://t.co/JZwGSY5321
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 Not saying the small things don’t matter; rather we can’t match them. It is better rather to focus on main doctrine and pray that the little things follow. Once again, KJV is not perfect. No human translation is perfect. Original translators themselves denied that it was perfect. https://t.co/WXF84cMDw9
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 Pharisees fretted over small things; Jesus told them off. Love of God needs to be genuine in the heart. We can’t possibly match up to God’s perfection(we live in sin). Best that we can do is love Him with all heart, soul, mind. Not look down on those who read a different version.
@AbdielCabrera8 I am praying for you brother. God loves you; Satan who tries to plant seeds of doubt in your heart. Why would God send His Son to Earth to suffer and atone for our sins if He did not love us? I would also recommend reading Hebrews 12. Please don’t ever lose faith. God bless.
@AbdielCabrera8 Verse out of context. Job initially bitter at what seems to be God’s abandonment. God rebukes this thinking in Job 38-41. Powerful passage about extent of His power. We all experience pain. God uses this to strengthen. Where would love stem from if there were never any trials?
@AbdielCabrera8 I suggest that you read the book of Job sometime, friend. You acknowledge the existence of God, but you have a very spiteful relationship with Him. He loves you, and He puts us all through trials so outsiders will see our perseverance and will come to Him. He does not hate us.
#Ephesians 4:4-6 (#ESV) - 	“There is one body and one Spirit-just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call-one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.” #bible #scripture #dailywisdom
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 KJV only-ers are modern Pharisees. Very judgmental and do not see the truth that God still works in modern light. I pray that you would turn from this strange conspiracy theory that God’s Word is somehow corrupted. God’s care is not in small things but the big picture. Good day
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 Modern versions have minor contradictions, I acknowledge that. So do old versions (KJV, Wycliffe, Tyndale, etc). God cares more about doctrine; are people getting His message? Can one still form connections with modern Bible? Can those who read new versions love God and His word?
RT @desiringGod: If you are in Christ, trials do not mean that God has stopped loving you. The trials are a part of his love. https://t.co/…
#Exodus 15:11 (#ESV) - 	"Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?” #bible #scripture #dailywisdom
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 That’s a pretty pessimistic position. Do you not believe that it may also just be Christian scholars trying to update Word of God to contemporary English? And it’s not like publishers don’t profit off sales of KJV. Many modern translations are freely available online to read.

@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the 1940s, also contain Apocryphal writings. So are you going to tell me that the Apocrypha is part of the original Hebrew and Greek Bible? Because that is what original 1611 KJV and Dead Sea both include. Original language does not include Apocrypha.
@USA_4_GOD @cheymamma1 @DanCovfefe1 Please explain. I find myself fascinated by this belief that #kjv is the only correct Bible(out of the hundreds that have come before and after). A 400 year old antiquated language translation based in Anglican theology(original KJV includes Apocrypha). Prayers for you, brother.
@PreservedBible Always praying for a brother in Christ. You’re splitting hairs on the rejection of other translations; none completely accurate. We need to have faith that the Spirit would guide us to understanding. Bickering over translations is not productive; it turns away new believers.
@PreservedBible Love the enthusiasm for the Word, but I’m a bit worried about the belief of #kjv as a perfect translation, and that all other English translations are evil. “Difficult” in this passage could also be interpreted as Him saying that it is difficult for man by himself without grace.
