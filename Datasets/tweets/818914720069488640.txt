@AaronBlake @MonmouthPoll It's a poll of 805 people divided between Republicans, Dems, and Independents. So it's actually about 150 Republicans who said that, not 52% of all Republicans in the US.
@whyfullyblind @bannerite @RVAwonk The sample is too small for Monmouth to make sweeping statements like "62% of the public believes..." and "Just under half of the public (45%) feels that Trump‚Äôs attitude toward Russia."
@kylegriffin1 Monmouth should not be making statements like this on the basis of what 160 Republicans said on the phone: 		"Just under half of the public (45%) feels that Trump‚Äôs attitude toward Russia presents a national security risk to the U.S., while 51% feel it does not."

@DerekCressman There is an interview in a book from before his campaign where Trump says "I can be vicious." 		He told Bob Woodward that he thinks real power comes from fear. It disturbed Woodward enough that he named his book "Fear."		He should not have weapons, nuclear or otherwise.
By in-depth reporting on Turkey, I mean Trump's many conflicts of interest including:		Trump Towers Istanbul $ 	  (and the anything goes "white gloves concierge" service)	Trumps furniture business	Ivanka and the construction scandals and Gulen	Ivanka's building project in #Baku
Yep, they'll probably end up where they started. But hey, it kept Cohen, Russia, in-depth reporting on Turkey, the stock market disaster, trade disaster, Khashoggi's murder, Putin in the Ukraine, and Facebook off the news, so it's generally a win for Republicans &amp; Trump. https://t.co/27icU2mBVA

@sublime_carrot @CarolLeonnig He's a grown General and NSA Chief at the White House, not some file clerk. Why didn't he just tell the truth? Maybe more importantly, why was he working on a personal project to get wealthy in the Middle East with his nuclear power deals even after the election?

@WendySiegelman Even if Vekselberg wasn't involved, it would be a terrible terrible awful idea to put sensitive Pentagon data on someone else's computers.		How the hell did this happen? Let me guess. A defense contractor did a study, right? FFS.

@PatsyResists @MSNBC @CNN First we digest the Mueller report and have oversight hearings. Impeachment is at least a month or two away. If he is still in office then, I predict Trump will have threatened to use nukes or drag us into a war with Iran. If so, Congress would impeach with great joy.
@KathyA11 @Enobarbarus @cherokeesher2 @PatsyResists @keitheyoung @MSNBC @CNN Republicans may not vote to convict.

@harveyjkaye American democracy is alive and well. Maybe it was taking a little nap for a moment, but we are woke now.
@NYTmag @pulitzercenter During the last 2 years of Trump, we've let a lot of things slide. Now adults need to step up and deal with the reality that we must stop participating in this genocide. 		We need a conversation about what the options are. Not a "CNN panel yelling" conversation, but a real one.

@NatashaBertrand @RepAdamSchiff @CNN Which lawyer?
Great thread. Elliot Broidy is in the middle of so much sketchy stuff! While they were both RNC finance committee chairs, Michael Cohen allegedly paid off Broidy's mistress to have an abortion, Broidy was fronting for Malaysian criminals. Pushing Angola mining deals. Crazy. https://t.co/VUdFGExidp
