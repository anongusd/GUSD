5/I've come to greatly respect your passion for straight-talk and your ideas to bridge gaps between people and problems during @Majority54 on @crookedmedia. I know that with support and perseverance, I know that you'll be able to meet this head on.
4/After finally getting to shore duty, I was able to dig deep back into the things that matter to me and focus on making sure I was okay, to be a better husband, father, son, brother, and friend to all those that I care about. With compassion and determination, things ARE better.
3/Just this last week the VCNO discussed the importance of taking time for your personal health, and mandating a policy that Flag Officers take at least 1 continuous 10 day period of leave annually. It's great to see this, even as an E-6. Personal &amp; Mental Health matter for us.

A 1-1 Finish for #USvMEX #USMNT.  Does anyone else, straight away, feel...BETTER...with Jurgen Klinsmann?  Oh, that maybe the Merlot talking
The possibility of 2 goals gets anyone a bit excited #noworries #usmnt
Remember, counterattacking isn't a clinical feature of the game, it is clearly based upon psyche & pace.
RT @geoffisfamous: .@brekshea had a stellar assist on that goal.
AND THERE IS THE ENERGY!!!! #USMNT!!!!  PACE, MOVEMENT, ESSENTIALLY.  Will is certainly something that is quintessentially American.  Really
THERE YOU HAVE IT!!!!  #USMNT!  1-1 #USvMEX
Let's go #USMNT !!!!

Freak goal....almost looked like he was whipping out a flying squirrel wrestling move.
#USMNT no question following Boca's extension about Captaincy
#USMNT The spinning of the central defensive triangle could be dangerous, as long as they communicate
I say, Michael Bradley seems to feel a bit more free, looks a bit more, um....we'll know in 80ish.
