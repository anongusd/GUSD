And so far no direct questions on boots on the ground for Iraq (or Syria) etc.

Carter's pre-written answers seem tailored to some of the questions he's now getting. example: Gillibrand's line on sexual assault.
on sexual assault retaliation Carter says is a dimension of the problem which to me at least is becoming increasingly apparent.
to ayotte, Carter commits not to let terrorists out from gitmo who HE THINKS will return to battlefield:  "I’ll play it absolutely straight"
Carter says: we can and must stay with Asia pivot/commitment.

if anything happens to those non "boots on the ground" isn't the danger posed to them just as high? it will quickly become semantics
another 475 forces to iraq. in addition to the 1100 or so there. but don't call them boots on the ground, obama says
obama uses "destroy" again but it's not clear he knows what that really means exactly
