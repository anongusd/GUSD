@unlimited_davie @renoomokri Is it only pant that is stealing? In fact is like you are derailing already; you're not grabbing the line of even your own argument..
@unlimited_davie @renoomokri What's your point in essence?
@iweriolo80 @aatikucampaign @fkeyamo Ask the desperate Atikulateds
@unlimited_davie @renoomokri Fight crime in the high places, and poverty will reduce drastically in the system...I sincerely think that, this is more logical.
@unlimited_davie @renoomokri If being rich ultimately stops stealing, rich people would have stopped looting public funds(satisfy with what they have). Or if good economy stops crime/stealing, you wouldn't see those vices in economies like that of China, USA,  etc

@renoomokri You're really twitting from exile not #Nigeria; if u know Nig. well u 'll agree with me that the poverty u're talking about is born out of corruption in the country. When u are in office &amp; loot public funds without establishments to engage people for a living what do u expect?
@renoomokri @MBuhari If you really mean equity you wouldn't have talked against #MBuhari in favour of #Atiku because Atiku becoming a president is very likely to make hausa/fulani to rule Nigeria for at least 12 years. Is like you have not thought of that before...
@renoomokri @MBuhari Must be directed to the #Atikus that are waiting for free falls to earn a living. Atiku won't come to ur houses to give u money if  that's ur reason for supporting him rather u will work out what to eat. If u can't work out what to eat in #MBuhari regime, u may not in another's

@ESPNFC I wonder what all these #Chelseafc players do smoke sometimes....I have not seen this kind of disrespect from a player to his/her manager before. Modern football has gone bananas, lack of professionalism the order of the day right now in the game of football.
As long as #Chelseafc after #Kepa refused to be substituted, he made Chelseafc to lose to #ManchesterCity on penalties, and should be severely punished. What a nonsense from a player to his manager!!!

@adeyanjudeji @akaebube It's never enough posting your wish, what about other people's wishes? Next time try to consider other people's wishes before you send a false post...

After witnessing what #PDP did in Nigeria, if Buhari or any politician joins the master of looting(PDP) should know that I will never support him/her....
#PDP introduced the idea of doing projects when elections are approaching(with almost ZERO projects completed), sharing of public resources meant for development projects among members/associates, etc.

@ChelsTransfer It will be wise of Chelseafc to sell whoever doesn't want to play for Sarri, instead of sacking the manager. If you sack the manager again, these foolish selfish players will continue to dictate for the club who they want and the club will continue losing ¬£s sacking managers.

@FelaOmisakin Copy copy
Sarri is so stubborn that he thinks nobody should advise him...It's on this basis I wouldn't mind if he is fired. Many senior players have been out of form for long time now and you refused to play younger players, even when the later is obviously better than the former....
The only reason why I will like Sarri to leave Chelseafc is the fact that he doesn't like playing with younger players even when the older players are consistently not performing..Cfc need a manager who is very open to make use of their best youth players like CHO,  Cheek,  etc
I think it's time for #Chelseafc to rebuild their squad instead of sacking #Sarri. Clubs like FC Bayern, etc, are focusing on rebuilding their squad with young hungry blood. CFC 've talented young bloods like Loftus-Cheek, CHO, Ampadu, Christiansen, Pulisic,etc. Build on them...

@acct32120302 @TheSunFootball Former Chelseafc player Di Matteo had won UEFA Champions League for Chelseafc as interim manager without much experience....
@Hillquestgh @TheSunFootball The reverse is the case; Manchester United learnt from Chelseafc that after a run of loses you should sack and get an interim manager. Di Matteo that won UEFA Champions League for Chelseafc was a former chelseafc player. Did you start watching football yesterday?
@Matt_Law_DT Instead of sacking managers always, #Chelseafc should try the opposite this time; allow the manager to sieve, sell and buy players that he thinks that suit his philosophy of football.
@CFCPys But this same Sarri opened up and ended the unbeaten run of Manchester City. The problem is not opening things up to play expansive football, the problem lies on the players.
@ChelseaFC @CesarAzpi For how long will you lifeless players continue to humiliate/hurt your fans &amp; say just sorry? They sorry CFC fans need is your performances of a top team not embarrassment here and there, as every team makes meal of you guys. Leadership is a natural thing, CFC lack it right now.
@Adefola16 Oh yeah
@bukolasaraki @atiku @PeterObi @OfficialPDPNig TEACHER: Which party originated massive rigging in #NigeriaElections? 	STUDENT: #PDP
Most of these Chelseafc players are not good enough for a premiership football let alone playing for a big club. Jose and Conte's systems covered them and made them champions, but Sarri's possessive(real) football has exposed them all as average/below average players.
Whoever Chelseafc install as a manager with these set of players with poor spirit, every manager including Pep will be sacked early in the job. It's not enough having football talent; to be on top in football you need to have a die hard spirit to reach the next level. Ask CR7
@liam_twomey Really Most of these Chelseafc players should be sold instead of sacking a manager...Their lack of fighting spirit or poor durability got Jose and Conte fired. They find it difficult to adhere to a manager's football philosophy for a long term; tend to play anything they want..
If #Chelseafc sack #Sarri &amp; still keep the players that got Mourinho and Conte sacked, they're very wrong. Most of them 've shown that whoever the manager is &amp; whatever the football philosophy is, they naturally don't 've the fighting spirit for a club of CFC status. Sell them!!
Unfortunately, Chelseafc no longer have real leaders; they have jokers instead of hot blood players as leaders. After today's humbling, which Chelseafc player will say he is not a championship player? Because superstars couldn't allow themselves to be humiliated like this #MCICHE
If Chelseafc want this odd collapses with each manager they employ to stop, they should fish out and sell all these players that use to down tool or do not have fighting spirit for the club. Unfortunately, most of the senior players in this Chelseafc team should be sold#MCICHE
The only thing I want to hear from Sarri in his presser is his resignation as a Chelseafc manager  From the players, I want them all to know that whatever thing they had achieved and will achieve in future as players they are all not worthy of a #ChelseafcShirt #MCICHE
My question to #Chelseafc players and manager, what is the difference between you and a championship team? Infact, many championship teams are better than this Chelseafc team right now #MCICHE
Sarri and his useless football philosophy should be thrown out right there in Etihad, should not be allowed to reach Stamford Bridge; he should go from there #MCICHE
#ChelseafcYouthTeam would have got a better result against Manchester City than these liverless Chelseafc first team #MCICHE
I will say this again, this time not to #Sarri rather #ChelseafcBoard...Is it not better to play with academy players and lose like this than with the so called established professional players that are obviously confused? #MCICHE
Since Bournemouth beat this Chelseafc team 4-0, why should be a surprise if the same team is losing 4-0 to the reigning champions(ManchesterCity)?#MCICHE
Sarri may run away after first half because of fear of being arrested by Abramovich police üòÇ #MCICHE
If am in this #Chelseafc team I will shamefully resign as a footballer. The worst part of it is that this squad will be remembered as the worst Chelseafc squad in history #MCICHE
#Sarri will pack his bag and run before these unmotivated and confused Chelseafc players give him high blood pressure.....üòÇ #MCICHE
@IshanTi_02 Pogba is used to shinning against weak oppositions, so it's not a surprise that he is happy that PSG are losing their big players to injuries...When I used to play football, if I don't see big players of oppositions playing against my team, I don't enjoy the game.
@abraham_orwa Ole continue to enjoy a lucky run
@Rohandinho_ @fcbRoshan Pogba is best midfielder playing majorly against weak oppositions
@talkSPORT Actually a virus to Jose Mourinho work @ManchesterUnited

@benmurraybruce Whatever bad you'r seeing in the 4yrs Buhari has been in power is as a result of 16years of PDP selfishness in leadership; since it took #PDP 16years to suck down mother Nigeria's "breast"(resources), it shld practically take double of that years to resurrect the dying "breast".
@isaacewa1 @arctiwa @seunvictor1 @benmurraybruce We are concentrating on the 2nd republic

@DanielFaithful1 Can't compare the agility of Higuain with that of Morata
@samywejinya If you are not lying then you should know that those are not real Chelseafc fans because the real fans were angry with Sarri when he substitute him with Giroud against Bournemouth
What is really happening between #Kante and #Higuain, is there going to be a football marriage between the two?#CHEHUD
@ojharbord I can see that the problem Sarri-ball has @Chelseafc is the players that are implementing it; CFC players are not playing the system as Sarri would have loved it, as they are very static instead of more mobile...The worst part of it is that, they do it as if it's an instruction

@holywadie @MadMontana However, Chelseafc have put CHO off transfer market even in the summer. Bayern Munich should look else where.
@holywadie @MadMontana So you mean that Bayern Munich is planning to use CHO when main players are being rested? If that is the case, is like you don't even know what his problem is at Chelseafc

@alemamorim How sure are you that they will leave? Even if they leave, Bayern Munich will definitely go back to transfer market to complete it their usual 5 wingers
@alemamorim Meaning that he can not be sold?
@Patmosfelix12 Chelseafc fan are very cool about drawing with Manchester United because they know that they always beat United irrespective of the manager. During Fergie time referees come to United rescue against CFC...
@alemamorim So also Ruben and Ribery are considered key Bayern Munich players...
@holywadie @MadMontana Mind you, Bayern Munich had Ruben and Ribery, and still added the rest younger 3 wingers(Coman et' al). This means that if Ruben and Ribery go out of the team, they will still go back to transfer market to make it up to their normal 5 wingers.
@holywadie @MadMontana Going by your judgement, Eden Hazard, Willians, Pedro and CHO are perfect for wing position for Chelseafc this season, why then do you guys want him to leave?
@holywadie @MadMontana Then you think that it's Chelseafc that will go back to the transfer market if Pedro or Willians leaves?
@alemamorim Who said so that Pedro Rodriguez has contract to 2020?
@AdamBenM @masha53816 @aristokush @ChelseaFC Do you know the plans of Chelseafc for buying Pulisic? Do you know whether it's certain that Hazard will leave? Do you know whether Willian and Pedro won't play for Chelseafc next year? If Chelseafc bin Willian and Pedro next year, don't you think it's Pulisic &amp; CHO are needed?
@alemamorim Obviously there is more chance for Callum Hudson Odoi to play at Chelseafc next year than at Bayern Munich, giving the ages of their respective wingers
@_samlcfc If you are putting yourself in a shoe, have you also considered whether Chelseafc is planning to cut ties with Willian and Pedro in the summer, to be replaced by Pulisic and Hudson Odoi?
@holywadie @MadMontana If Ruben and Ribbery leave, don't you also think that Bayern Munich will go for more wingers to boost their squad?
@MurphyPongo @SkySportsPL The devil you know is better than angel you don't know; going by what happened to young talented players like #MarioGotse, #RenatoSanchez,  etc it's not a guarantee that #HudsonOdoi will succeed in a new environment like #BayernMunich. As it stands right now, he shd stay put #CFC
@craig_thunder @SkySportsPL This statement is very subjective and laughable...Why then is he with Chelseafc first team instead of being loaned out, if Chelseafc had no interest or faith in him? Are Bayern Munich giving all their under 18 players playing time as Chelseafc have done with Hudson Odoi?
@Moessi81 @AlexHolmes @talkSPORT @RealRomfordPele @Calteck10 Who developed Hudson Odoi?

@Timson_91 @gabrienriquez If you are good you are good and have to have patience; if all those you mentioned were good enough they would have been playing for #Chelseafc...Mind you, none of those mentioned got playing time #HudsonOdoi is getting right now, meaning that Cfc trust him. Patience a virtue...
@12345mb67890 @RealNickGolo @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC If you are a science student or read science course in school you would have known how to compare two or more different things; Lig1 is never EPL and a young player can easily establish himself in Lig1 than in EPL, especially for big clubs due to the pressure
@12345mb67890 @Cramizar_on_LoL @hanny365 @RealNickGolo @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Meaning that you can't even remember what you say...You said shirt money goes to Nike, clubs do not get shirts sale's money
@12345mb67890 @RealNickGolo @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC You guys should always put things into perspective; if #PSG are playing  in #EPL where competition to win the title is so high, do you think they would have the patience to use Mbappe at the tender age if they are so serious to win EPL title?
@12345mb67890 @hanny365 @RealNickGolo @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Both
@12345mb67890 @RealNickGolo @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC We are trying to do both but impatience is frustrating the whole effort. #Chelseafc already saw what Bayern Munich have seen in #HudsonOdoi but trying to integrate him gradually so that he won't suffer the heat of EPL. But you guys want him to do a "#DominicSolanke" Good luck!
@12345mb67890 @hanny365 @RealNickGolo @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Do you know what #Pulisic mean to USA? He is like a ftball god in the country, hence the image of the club he is playing for will be enhanced in the world leading nation. Ftball this days is a big business, so you have to seize any big business opportunity that presents itself
@RealNickGolo @12345mb67890 @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Chelseafc don't want to be just a team people talk about, but a team that compete with big teams in the world with regards to high profile/world class players and winning of trophies year in year out...In a match where experience matters, Willian will excel more than Hudson Odoi
@12345mb67890 @hanny365 @RealNickGolo @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC My point is that clubs make money through shirt sales
@RealNickGolo @12345mb67890 @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Where is #TottenhamHotspurs today in terms of trophies won, as you guys use them as yardstick to judge #Chelseafc in terms of promoting youths?...Big clubs spend much money on transfers to remain competitive and for trophies(e.g #RealMadrid, #FCB, etc)...
@12345mb67890 @RealNickGolo @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC Go and read avenues through which clubs make money, you will see that  shirt sales is inclusive
@12345mb67890 @RealNickGolo @hanny365 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC If your concern is about his transfer fee, have you considered the money he will bring to the club in the form of shirt sales, etc which Hudson can't command even in future time?
@RealNickGolo @hanny365 @12345mb67890 @NJUWAMAINA @Calteck10 @DomSolanke @ChelseaFC What experience does #HudsonOdoi have over #Pulisic? I will take Pulisic any day anytime over Hudson...
#CallumHudsonOdoi had made up his mind to leave #Chelseafc not bc of playing time; he is just using playing time as an excuse to leave. At his age, he is getting the right game time at CFC, and opportunity is there for him to carry on. CFC should let him get out....

@CFCDon @NizaarKinsella Sarri is reluctant to drop Alonso majorly because of height factor; many #Chelseafc players are short, so not playing Alonso would reduce the average height of CFC players against opponents further especially during set piece.

@ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern They can also make ¬£100m if really they are serious...The only thing that matters is what Chelseafc think...
If really #BayerMunich is serious to buy #Chelseafc's wonder kid #CallunHudsonOdoi, they should be serious with their bid; they should start testing CFC resolve with upward of ¬£50m not all this ¬£5m additional money thing. A player they will put ¬£100m price on once they buy him.
@90min_Football You said the same thing when #Solanke was pushing for a move to #Liverpoolfc but refused to say anything when it didn't work out there for him. Same here, when it doesn't work out for #HudsonOdoi @BayernMunich for one reason or the other, you will hibernate.
@Marvitodude @AlexGoldberg_ #PedroRodriguez is very much productive &amp; more important to the Sarri system than #Willian. The mistake #Chelseafc made was not taking #FCB's money for him&amp; ran in the summer. I believe if the situation was like today, CFC would have sold Willy because of the rise of #HudsonOdoi
@RooJameZ @Abdourachid16N @Calteck10 They are teaching me lesson on how to chicken out of the oldest football competition in England, FA cup.

@dannydoes The hatred on #Chelseafc is too much; some people act as if they'r so concerned abt d well-being/good of the #HudsonOdoi but deep down in them they are talking for him to leave out of impulsive hatred towards Cfc, bc of fear of d unknown success d club may record with the player
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern Ask yourself why Manchester United sold Ronaldo,  why Liverpool sold Starling, Courtinho,  Arsenal sold Fabregas,  etc. Even Real Madrid sold Ronaldo...There are different reasons why club sell a player, so stop arguing for argument sake. Try to learn when taught.
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern You're just making myopic argument. You don't follow your line of arguments. You can easily go to prison if this is a law court; Bayern play and develop their youths, why couldn't they develop who will replace Argen Ruben rather looking elsewhere for his replacement?
@iMiaSanMia Fake news, even the price of ‚Ç¨30m posted is fake....Fake news on the player can't help but backfire when a player loves his current club but just wants more playing minutes
@iMiaSanMia @Sky_MaxB False news..Do you have upward of ¬£50m to pay for him?
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern Chelseafc sold players like KDB,  Salah, etc bc they were impatient to challenge the players ahead of them in the club. And Chelseafc is not teams like Liverpoolfc, etc,that always quarrel with a player who wants to leave; if they can't convince a player to stay, they will sell.
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern Mata didn't come good? Oscar didn't come good?  Your analysis is laughable; you said only Hazard is good amongst those players mentioned just bc he is the only one still remaining at CFC? Is that your basis of "good player"...
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern Meaning that you don't even know the topic you raised...You're suggesting that Chelseafc do not value young talented players...Then I had to let you know that if it's true, why then did Chelseafc bought players like Hazard, Oscar, Mata, etc at tender age?
@ayk77 @CmiHD @NkofiDenny @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern In your wildest dream...Let's see what will happen
@ayk77 @CmiHD @NkofiDenny @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern Bayern Munich should come and buy him, he is available.
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern It doesn't matter your age, it's all abt being ready to carry pressure that comes with playing for a big team. How old were Hazard, Oscar &amp; Mata when Chelseafc bought them(even Pulisic)? If CFC don't play youths they wouldn't 've bought those players;what a player offers matters
@CmiHD @NkofiDenny @ayk77 @SarriballEra @Calteck10 @FCBayern If you know football and #Chelseafc as a club, it's a very simple question you should have provided the answer to yourself. If #JT was not patient enough, he wouldn't have been a #CFC legend today. If you're good and have patience to develop, you will become a CFC legend like JT
@TSMTransfers #CristianoRonaldo left #RealMadrid, I tweeted that the club is a one man club(i.e without CR7 that the club is shit, as it depended hugely on CR7 individual efforts to be successful). One of their fan argued sentimentally with me. I guess he's remembering me as I said to him üòÇ
@Calteck10 Who are they?

@EJ_PSolace @5liveSport @BBCMOTD @Calteck10 How somebody that said he was a Chelseafc fan mocked the club by using the same phrase("Pensioner club") oppositions use when they want to mock chelseafc fans?
@EJ_PSolace @5liveSport @BBCMOTD @Calteck10 Can they cope without the break they are enjoying that English teams are not enjoying? Bayern Munich players would burn out if they are in a league where bottom clubs can beat club in first position; a league where every much is like a final.

@EJ_PSolace @5liveSport @BBCMOTD @Calteck10 Champions League contender in a woman league? You think Bayern Munich will be winning league year in year out if playing in EPL? Manchester United would have been winning league year in year out if playing in Bundesliga; men are trying to play in EPL while woman chicken out...
@Chakladar_ @ChelseaDGE @5liveSport Those were German players who Bayern normally develop for their National team....
@Adefola16 @5liveSport It's obviously a hate speech from #TottenhamHotspur old players, so I don't expect anything less from them. Whenever it comes to #Chelseafc I really know how #AndyTownsend bend issues against the club. The hatred is in every issue. Spurs should produce one for #BayernMunich...
@SheikAmeerally @5liveSport @BBCMOTD Obviously, a hate speech from #AndyTownsend,  #Jenas and the likes because it's #Chelseafc. #TottenhamHotspur old and new would always do or say something to hurt #CFC, so am not surprised that such sentimental rubbish is coming from them.
@EJ_PSolace @5liveSport @BBCMOTD @Calteck10 You're obviously not a #Chelseafc fan...You're a #TottenhamHotspur fan and that's what you guys(#Jenas, #Townsend, etc) have been wishing Chelseafc to lose player(s) that you think would make them a football force in future...Produce one that can attract a club of #Bayern level
@SaharaReporters @OfficialPDPNig @ChibuikeAmaechi #APC are not doing. But this obvious truth from #Amechi is the sole reason why I will never support any candidate from #PDP(NEVER). PDP selfishness(careless looting of public funds/belongings) is what has kept #Nigeria in this present condition. D/4, am sitting on the fence...
https://t.co/Cudx34acg3
If #Chelseafc dare listen to offers for #CallumHudsonOdoi, I am prepared to pay north of ¬£100, and keep him to entertain me with those very mature displays. Seriously, sentiments and number of games played apart, I really don't see how #KylianMbappe is than Hudson.
Just one lose in #EPL #Liverpoolfc will be deflated like #Manchestercity. It's all about psychological blow. Manchester city likely to do it to them on thursday...
Do you feel that #APC should be given 16 years of leadership in #Nigeria before making a comparison between them and failures like #PDP?
@danlevene Derby fan be like "Is he a #Chelseafc agent" ‚ò∫
Whether #PDP win or #APC win in #NigeriaElections, the real #question should be "Of what use is it to common people in the #country" bearing in mind that the "#GiantOfAfrica" is in this era blessed with #UselessPoliticians?
WELCOME TO UIS77 BLOG: Clothes: Things On Sale In IfyStev_OnlineFashionst... https://t.co/9WcFNMojH6
If #Chelseafc are to allow #HudsonOdoi to leave, I think the best will be to sell him to a club where he can play regularly and with a buy-back clause(MUST)inserted in the sell arrangement
You know what, agent #MinoRiola is a controversial agent, and controversy in his life is pushed by his love for money; who loves money more than his life/integrity? Riolaaaaaaa

A #Chelseafc front 3 of #CallumHudsonOdoi, #EdenHazard &amp; #ChristanPulisic will be too much for any defence in the whole world...I think #Sarri has in his hands what he has been looking for in attack, the only unfortunate thing being the fact that Pulisic is still on loan @BVB.
@lmabeyofficial @LiverpoolFC You're never sure that it will be a success to Hudson like it's to Sancho, because Bayern is never BVB.... Secondly, some players like #Solanke(urged to join #Liverpoolfc), Cholobah,  etc that left #Chelseafc are they better off? Football is never a thing of 1+1=2
If #Chelseafc can sign #HirvingLozano from #PSV,  I won't be much worried if impatient #CallumHudsonOdoi leaves...As long as #EdenHazard stays, the pairing of Eden, Lozano and #ChristianPulisic would bring to #CFC much needed energy to break stubborn opposition defense line...
@Bluesofchels_gh Lozano should change greedy #MinoRiola as agent; he thinks more of himself/pocket than the welfare of his clients
@HarveyNoble77 @joshbabumba @SkySportsNewssz @PSV @ChelseaFC Obsessed of Eden Hazard issues?
@lmabeyofficial @LiverpoolFC Do you think Sancho would have got much playing time if he was bought by #BayernMunich? Bayern is obviously a massive club when compared with #Dortmund, and pressure that comes with it might hurt development of very young players like #Sancho, #CallumHudsonOdoi,  etc. #Chelseafc
@roomm4 @Churchillnnobi @anuabayomi @atiku Stop ranting and missing the point...The subject matter centers on how he got his money. Anyway, you wouldn't care because mere looking at you, somebody like you is so desperate for money that you can easily use yours for money rituals. Goodluck!
Some people make irrational comparisons as regards to #Chelseafc affairs; they refer to #JasonSancho when the case of #HudsonOdoi comes up as if it's #BorussiaDortmund that the later is going, point at #ChristianPulisic transfer to #CFC as if Odoi and Pulisic play same position.
@Tom_MG_L @TweetingChop @ChazaSmith Are Pulisic and Hudson playing in the same position? Some people need to understand football before making a comment or contribution...
@liam_twomey Obviously
Would #JasonSancho of #BorussiaDortmund get into #BayernMunich 1st team and play as much time he has played for the former?This is a key questn I want #CallumHudsonOdoi of #Chelseafc to ask himself. Bayern Munich is at different level to Dortmund,so won't be easy for Odor there
@llorentefer19 @SpursOfficial @EmiratesFACup So you are still playing football, I thought you had retired
@Revtope @Churchillnnobi @atiku What you bargained, that you will get bah..No be so

@Revtope @Churchillnnobi @atiku When fuel was 87 naira how much do you buy it during festive time like Christmas? 200, 300, 400, 500, some even bought black market 1000 then... It's naturally 145 naira for stability.
@ShedrackLuka @Churchillnnobi @atiku @YouthsForAtiku In what way?
@Anthonycess @Churchillnnobi @atiku Is it not good for you to remain poor than being a rich/wealthy robber, money ritualist, etc?
@Revtope @Churchillnnobi @atiku People like you would say arm robbers are creative and encourage/cheer them on. But I wish they will come for you and yours, so that you will start speaking through the other mouth. .
@roomm4 @Churchillnnobi @anuabayomi @atiku Stop being sentimental in important issues; if it's just hatred why can't he travel to USA?  You have mansion in your village but refuse to travel to your village to make use of your mansion, what then is pursuing you?

@BodeOsanaiye @TorToridb @Churchillnnobi @JeSuisNaija @atiku Were you the only qualified graduate in the year being mentioned? I put it to you that, there were thousands of more qualified graduates that were not employed then. So, it's wrong of you to use your case to make a generalization...Try to be more objective next time, pls.
@BodeOsanaiye @Churchillnnobi @JeSuisNaija @atiku Thank God is your own choice, good for you...You know, some people can only do well in a place/society where evil is the order of the day but failures when the reverse is the case.
@ayi_baba @Churchillnnobi @atiku Can't you read and understand again? Is 1999 today? Was he banned not to enter USA in 1999?
@nebandan @AlexMcGovern11 @Bundesliga_EN What's Chalobah doing right now outside #Chelseafc? Is he not as good as #DominicSolanke who left for #Liverpoolfc and now sold out without playing
@AlexMcGovern11 @Bundesliga_EN And it paying off both on and off the pitch; financially and good positions in bundesliga table every season...
@ScouseSZN Maybe free transfer also
@ScouseSZN The fee #Chelseafc and #Liverpoolfc agreed on #DominicSolanke was undisclosed...So, the ¬£3m reported were guessed work...
So #Liverpoolfc convinced #DominicSolanke to join them from #Chelseafc not for football reason but just to sell him for profit...I wonder what the whole world would have said if it's Chelseafc that did this in #epl
@LukeCFC__1905 It's what I've been saying; I believe that #DominicSolanke wld 've been better off if he remained @Chelseafc instead of going to #Liverpoolfc. Look at how #CFC is handling #TammyAbraham who I think has brighter future right now than Solanke. That shld be a lesson to #HudsonOdoi
@lmabeyofficial #Chelseafc: But a team that bring up players upto to the point that teams like #BayernMunich, etc start being crazy/desperate abt the players. Hw 'r you sure that playing regularly will develop the player further at #Bayern? What's happening to #DominicSolanke @Liverpoolfc now?
@ccakirby Who then developed to the point you start appreciating them as good/fantastic player good for other teams? Was it not the same #Chelseafc that developed them: #LoftusCheek, #HudsonOdoi, etc to the point teams like #BayernMunich start looking for them? So, why should they leave?
@jayshani89 @Bayern_mania Why are Bayern Munich desperate to have him?
@1994yasa @TheSunFootball Is the goal line technology lying against Liverpoolfc?
@benmurraybruce @DemolaRewaju As if you would visit the place if you were the president...We know all of you guys in #Nigeria.. .#UselessPoliticians
@EmiratesHQ A very lucky team with much lucky draws; couldn't finish with highest league point.
@Calteck10 Happy to have you back training...You will surely get plenty opportunity(especially as players like Willians are messing up) and be a great #Chelseafc player/legend
@JoeClarke1985 @DTweeting101 @Matt_Law_DT But he is happy to be back to training according to his latest tweet
@JoeClarke1985 @DTweeting101 @Matt_Law_DT Meaning that #BayernMunich should be paying #Chelseafc above ¬£50m for his signature because you seemed to suggest he is almost in the same bracket with Mbappe, O. Dembele, etc
@TweetChelseaUK @Matt_Law_DT That's the problem I  have with #Sarri/#Chelseafc this season lies; when starters are not doing well consecutively over a certain period,  the logical thing to do as a manager/club is to play the players waiting for opportunities. Some great footballers emerged through this way.
@Matt_Law_DT That's exactly my mind considering the fact that #Solanke thought he was better off going to #Liverpoolfc from #Chelseafc, but at the end I think he is worst off because Chelseafc would have had a better progression part for him than Liverpoolfc...
@Salderson91 @Paddock_Blue Got a chance in a shit and unexposed club... However, Hudson clearly has more talent than Tammy
@Lankapatiraavan If #CallumHudsonOdoi really wants to leave #Chelseafc, they should sell him to any team that will accept a buyback clause; if #Bayern do not want that, being the owners of the player, they should sell him to another interested club with a buyback clause( with lesser T-fee)
Let the rain of fire of not giving #CallumHudsonOdoi more minutes(even when aged players like Williams are missing up) fall on #Chelseafc and #Sarri as #BayernMunich make those bids. Hope Hudson won't end up like #Solanke @Liverpoolfc,  that's, not also playing much for Bayern..
@cfcalex98 @Calteck10 @talkSPORT What exactly does he want other than more playing time especially in EPL?
@Bayern_mania #Chelseafc should ask for straight money and should equally make the deal match exactly that at which Christian Pulisic was signed from BVB
@Kennedy19Daniel Meaning? 1st position in the league?
@Charlzclive Meaning? 1st in the league?
@WazzaEra Meaning? 1st in the league?
@CmiHD @AlexMcGovern11 Fact you said? You have not made any point let alone fact
@burgett_lonnie @hughwizzy It's just only your thought not what is obtainable in transfer market nowadays, where a goalkeeper and a defender can be a club's record signings
@devsuzuki22 @osprey23 @CazzaEdition Am talking about present time because I know you were not born when Liverpool was a football force...The time football shorts were like pant or boxers
@devsuzuki22 @osprey23 @CazzaEdition All the players joined Liverpoolfc when they joined due to playing time; Chamberlain especially just like Solanke chose Liverpoolfc just because of playing time not because of the SURPRISE/LUCKY POSITION Liverpoolfc have found themselves...They're lucky to see draw against CFC
@Naby8i_ @TheChelseaMogul @ClinicalKeeno So you're in need of that "knee reconstructuon" right now?
@ClinicalKeeno When your useless racist self started making racist statement, what did you expect? You deserve more than you got,  because the words used in describing you then were just what you really are. So, no joke at all...
@CmiHD @AlexMcGovern11 Were those players you mentioned still playing for Chelseafc when your so called REPLACEMENTS were bought? Costa had gone before Morata came,  so also JT,  etc
@devsuzuki22 @osprey23 @CazzaEdition If that's the case, many players like Salah, Mane, Suarez, Torres, etc wouldn't have joined Liverpoolfc who last won EPL in 90s; maybe you're not even born then...
@NiceNaby @CazzaEdition Up you ‚ò∫
@NiceNaby @CazzaEdition League is ending in May,  hope you remember
@petesoon @CarefreeMichael @EmenaIo Clap for yourself for at least trying to challenge for the title this season since 90s...
@ClinicalKeeno Your father was sold during slave trade, that makes you a perpetual slave
@ClinicalKeeno You're a cunt of a mad granny
@petesoon @CarefreeMichael @EmenaIo I can smell too much fear in you, calm yourself down to avoid High-BP
@GeneralVVanDijk Because you're the owner of the players you are placing all those laughable transfer fees on...
@FatArsePickford OK ooo
@NiceNaby @CazzaEdition I bet you, you are not happy that you missed out, because you will still say exactly the same thing if you miss out on Fekir
@osprey23 @CazzaEdition He wouldn't fancy a big club that last won #EPL trophy in the 90s
@FatArsePickford It's one day now and no announcement yet, announcing it in the backyard?
@ArmanModel @SkySportsNewsd @ChelseaFC @OL Just as #JurgenKlopp would bring #ChristianPulisic to #Liverpoolfc
@ClinicalKeeno Somebody like you will cry out blood if you hear next that Fekir is also moving to Chelseafc...Take it easy man, I believe #JurgenKlopp should calm down on spending as he doesn't need to spend ¬£1b before he can win a trophy in England.
@merna_dawood96 I am sensing desperation in #Liverpoolfc fans calm since it was announced that #Chelseafc had signed Christian Pulisic. Calm down, would #JurgenKlopp spend ¬£1b before he can win a trophy for  #LFC...
@AnfieldHQ What if Chelseafc also collect Fekir would there still remain something in the background?
@brxdwaIker When you don't understand the game called football...
@UnofficialNadir @OM4RC98 There is no issue of replacement anywhere
@paddypower The last statement doesn't make any logical sense at all...
@RickSamimi @cpulisic_10 @FCBayernEN @BlackYellow Voice of a crying baby üòÇ
@trueblue_ak @tammyabraham It will be absolutely pointless if #Chelseafc sell any of their talented youth team product without inserting a buyback clause. At least past experience should be enough teacher to the club
@alawalaw1919 Hope you won't be surprised in the future when Christian Pulisic will be nominated as a Balloon D'Or contender while then your Sancho still trying to be an England team regular....
@SimonJWinter You have made the whole statement meaningless with the statement "now Chelsea is choosing Pulisic over Hudson Odoi"; Is there any correlation between Pulisic and Hudson? Are Chelseafc buying Pulisic to replace Hudson? You guys should stop listening to road side talks.
@prehfred @SaharaReporters @PoliceNG @dino_melaye Nothing illegal about breaking into a house of somebody that's behaving like a criminal instead of a legislator...
@AkanUmoetuk @SaharaReporters @PoliceNG Everywhere in the whole world, you will be forced if you refuse to respect yourself by obeying the law...Why can't he answer police call or some people above the law? I hate sentimental people, and that's why Nigeria is continuously moving backward...Politics in everything!!!
@n_uwem @SaharaReporters @PoliceNG @dino_melaye Ask Dino himself
@burgett_lonnie @hughwizzy How much would all those player you mentioned command in the transfer market right now? It's always good to be objective(not bias/sentimental) when you are analyzing issues. Do you think that those guys' transfer fees won't be upward of ¬£80m right now?
@AlexMcGovern11 There is no correlation between Pulisic signing &amp; Hudson Odoi(even Hazard)stay at Chelseafc; whenever Cfc sign a player,  people tend to assume the player is coming to replace an existing player. But it's not always like that when other clubs, e.g City,  etc, add to their squad
@ChelseaFC @cpulisic_10 Next season #ChristianPulisic will be #Sarritized @StamfordBridge... Christian Pulisic, you are welcome to #Chelseafc; the 1st English club that managed to win all #EuropeanTrophies). Who say we no get #FootballHistory???
@Andrew_McVittie It's only English clubs that do not quote astronomical price like others;  I know the amount a Bundesliga club(BVB) sold Dembele to FCB at almost the same age. @BayernMunich should pay up or look elsewhere. If ¬£20m, there should be a buyback clause.. @Chelseafc
@Futbol_Oskar @Daniel_Evans56 @ClinicaIEden If #PaulPogba is #Kante that is playing in position that's not his main position he would have started causing problems @Chelseafc?
@Cameron48916923 @SundaySupp @SkySportsPL Meaning that you didn't win any game under Jose Mourinho if you are as sure as you seem to be
@SundaySupp I am not a Manure fan, but I bet you when the team starts having some problems and your Ole starts demanding more efforts from your players, some may not take and start ganging up against him. That's how unprofessional most players are nowadays
@patoskiprp7 @SundaySupp @SkySportsPL Knows them from where and for how long?
@TheWelshChucker @_LukeWilletts @SundaySupp @SkySportsPL You would have struggled because your players chose to
@TheBeardedRauI David Luis should always thank N'Golo Kante because that his beautiful goal will always make that sweet long pass(assist) to be remembered ‚ò∫
@liam_twomey N'Golo Kante deserve every penny he is being paid by #Chelseafc,  if not more; this guy does everything as far as football is concerned. He can even be a goalkeeper if need be  or he is allowed
@manjuraj89 @its_me_jessy @Matt_Law_DT Clear example is #DominicSolanke... #HudsonOdoi should stay at Chelseafc and develop....
@Matt_Law_DT Is there any correlation between #HudsonOdoi's amount of game time and #ChristianPulisic's transfer to #Chelseafc? Left wing is never the same as right wing üôÅ
@AlWillcox When they thought they had won the league from 2nd position, Wolves came from behind and made meal of them...#TottenhamHotspur are typical bottles who always count their eggs before they are hatched
@morganhytes #Spurs are bottlers
@FFScout #Pochettino gives a lot of excuses for poor performances and when his team win he/his team tend to think they have done what others have not done before. I wonder his words if he/his team did what Man City did last season. #Spurs

@GretlvsLotta @iMiaSanMia They then forget it and look elsewhere
@Agh_ikhile007 @MattyHillis1 @LavCFC Football is not as you think it(1+1= 2); the word improvement not in your dictionary? Was Eden Hazard as good as he is right now when he was 20 years old???
@JohnCarrafiell @SebC__ @Borotas_spirit @sidcelery Even with buyback clause on Odoi transfer
@Lampxrd No need
@Zauvaughn Did Chekseafc tell you or roadside talk you are believing?
@iMiaSanMia With a buyback clause
@stabbehubbe @NiiNiiFC Ignorance is the major cause of the baseless logic or argument
@justinweible @gate17marco All because Pulisic did not want to renew his contract with BVB
@MHGooner95 @swearimnotpaul It depends on how many years remaining in his contract
@Bigblacklfc Obviously you are annoyed by him going to another club; those are words of consolation, enjoy it.
@Alfaenshe If they beat Arsenalfc to the signing, Chelsea FC will beat them both for his signature
@DonSim0001 It's just a wish
@dopemosco1 @goal Benching him majorly because he didn't want to sign a new contract or contract extension
@Hazpillian #EdenHazard will do a #ThibautCourtois if he signs for #RealMadrid... You may not recognize him as that fantastic #Chelseafc Eden Hazard
@GoBenzGo Eden Hazard and Oscar signed for Chelseafc at the age of what?
@ShawnaWTF When Sarah was sent to Roma and KDB to Germany, are they not they players that are tearing EPL right now?
@kennethonyeka18 @DahunsiJohnOlu1 @GovAyoFayose So what are you saying?
@MrSon1010 @GovAyoFayose Put you voted for GEJ of PDP,  so what are you saying now?
Seriously, I've been saying it that #Chelseafc have given #EdenHazard enough time to decide his future, and I concur with #Sarri that the club should decide for him his future; his comments/actions are destabilizing/distracting the team..If he wants to leave, is time he says it.
@palefireX When last did Liverpoolfc won epl, I think you have not been born when Liverpool won it last in early 90s..So calm down
@JScho12 @AlexMcGovern11 Football is never a mathematics of 1+1 = 2...It's not always how it sounds in your own ears because at last you may be made to eat up your words

@atiku It's quite unfortunate dt #NigeriaPoliticians play politics with everything they see/hear without minding who gets hurt with their action(s)...Must you use the death of your fellow man to play politics? Don't you(politicians) have limits in your desperation? #UselessPoliticians
#LordGodAlmighty say only a word and #Nigeria my country shall be well....
@CillieVB Ftball competitn is never a joke; bouncing back to lose nxt one to(with due respect)a lower ftball club often is annoying. This group of #ChelseafcPlayers lack die hard winning mentality like #JohnTerry, #DidierDrogba, #FrankLampard, #PetreCech, #AshleyCole, #MichaelEssien,  etc
@footy90com Chelseafc should sign Westham Aurnotovic who will be a better option than Higuain
#Sarri is not helping himself and #Chelseafc at all by his match selection. In football, some players become regular super stars by replacing an underperforming players ahead of them previously. Why can't Sarri replace #Willians with #HudsonOdoi and #Alonso with #Emerson?
@salvation266 @GovAyoFayose I know the reason why I started from 1999 till date; #PDP and #APC that are fighting for the seat of governance in #Nigeria were not in existence before 1999, and when judging the democracy you are "enjoying üòÇ" right now, you need to start from 1999.
@GovAyoFayose How would you get the #Nigeria you murdered and buried "working again "? Is there anytime Nigeria is working beginning from 1999 till date? #PDP and #APC(especially PDP) are not worthy to contest #election in #Nigeria. I don't blame APC much b/c what PDP spoilt in Naija is huge.
@GovAyoFayose I wonder why some people are very poor logically...Going by your induction(if you understand that), does it mean that #PDP(as a party) is already a failure, reason being that you(being their member) is a failure in #EkitiState?
@atiku Since I know #Nigeria good governance has remained only a thing of WORDS OF THE MOUTH(EASY SAID THAN DONE)...When you enter there you will forget all you said and start exhibiting the selfishness which #NigeriaPoliticians are known for. #PoliticalLiars #UselessPoliticians
If #Sarri or whoever makes us to lose #HudsonOdoi to any other team like #Jose did with #MohammedSalah and #KDB, #ChelseafcFans will never forgive you...Do the needful and save us the agony of losing a potential super star.
@footy90com If at all #Chelseafc want to sell him to #BayernMunich or any team,  there MUST be a buyback clause in the transfer arrangement; buyback clause or no deal.
@Blue_Footy If at all #Chelseafc will entertain selling of #HudsonOdoi, they MUST include #buyback clause to the transfer arrangement, irrespective of the club that is interested in him; buyback clause or no deal
#Chelseafc's fans will always remember our good old times with #JoseMourinho especially as he is no longer Manure manager...Jose will always be special in the hearts of us(#ChelseafcFans) as he was and still one of us...I wish him all the best in life...
@FOXSoccer #ManchesterUnited messed with #JoseMourinho's reputation with ZERO title....
@SkySportsNews @ManUtd #JoseMourinho should call it a quit to football or learn to have his team play attacking high pressing football...#Football has outgrown Jose's philosophy of football.

@GovAyoFayose Unfortunately, since 1999 these brains have not been working.... #Nigeria, unfortunately, is blessed with #UselessPoliticians who fight hard during #elections just to win the looting seats...Common man in Nigeria should always ask himself, what's going to be my gain after all...
@atiku @PeterObi I hate hearing #NigeriaPoliticians talking as if, there was a time they tried(let alone) making Nigeria work... Since 1999, #Nigeria has been moving in its usual backwardness due to the crop of politicians the country unfortunately has been having... #UselessPoliticians

If a black man is "fucking black cunt", invariably, a white man is fucking albino cunt...

#EdenHazard will definitely sign a new #Chelseafc contract when it's time for him to do so.... Before then, sit and enjoy dribbling of the #press/#media about his next destination...I think he is enjoying it as he enjoys dribbling players in the pitch. Eden am enjoying it too üòÇ
Do you feel that #APC should be given 16 years of leadership in #Nigeria before making a comparison between them and failures like #PDP?
Are you a #UselessPolitician or a #UsefulPolitician? Answer for yourself....#WorldPolitians.... #NigeriaPoliticians
Who is a #UselessPolitician?	A useless politician is one who holds a #politicalpost to enrich him/herself(and family members) instead of serving his/her #fathersland(#country) honestly...I will be right to say all #Nigeria #politicians fall under this class of #world politicians
#Chelseafc winning #Manchestercity without playing defensive game rather playing same as city is a plus or boost to #footballphilosophy #Sarri wants to introduce in the football club... #EPL
You're a #USELESS #nigeria #Politician if you use the political post given to you to enrich yourself and your family instead of serving your father's land(#Nigeria), &amp; judging by this it's obvious that almost all #NigeriaPoliticians are #useless to the #nation

As far as I am concerned,  no #politician in #Nigeria worth voting for as they are all useless to the well-being/growth of the #Nation. Whether #APC,  #PDP or etc, thesame results(even worse) everytime
@OfficialPDPNig @atiku @PeterObi Of what use are you politicians to common people in Nigeria..In this era of politics in the country, the nation is blessed with politicians that are not useful to her general growth. Whether #PDP or #APC,  the politicians are generally not useful to #Nigeria.. #VoteForYourselves
Whether #PDP win or #APC win in #NigeriaElections, the real #question should be "Of what use is it to common people in the #country" bearing in mind that the "#GiantOfAfrica" is in this era blessed with #UselessPoliticians?
#Nigeria is blessed with #uselesspoliticians.. Common man in the country is suffering of hunger due to political selfishness of the politicians while these looters are still there talking about elections/politics...If #PDP or #APC win, of what use is it to common man in Nigeria?
#Sarri is turning #Chelseafc into #ArsenWenger's #Arsenalfc; team that have beautiful statistics without results....

#NigeriaPoliticians are useless to the country, taking the country's citizens as fools by coming up with the same campaign promises everytime elections are around the corner. What do Nigerians gain in wasting their time, energy &amp; even money campaigning for these uselesses üòÇ
@SkySportsPL #MauricioPochettino should be humble because he has not won nothing since he became #TottenhamHotspur's manager... He would have been sent back to #Argentina if he happened to be a #Chelseafc's manager.... #Sarri üòÇ
@IainRodger1 It's even these current useless #Chelseafc players who do not understand what football derbies mean to the club that makes the number reach that level
@ltarsenal This looks like a comment that backfires after üòÇ
@markgoldbridge A man denied two clean penalties which would have changed the outcome of the match; you need to rough handle him to get a chance on him

RT @PGCFC001: Pep‚Äôs first season: 		Lost 2-0 away to Spurs	Lost 3-1 to Chelsea at home 	Lost 2-1 to Chelsea away 	Lost 4-2 to Leicester 	Lo‚Ä¶
@SpursOfficial I didn't see any wonder in that goal; when you are challenged with players like #DavidLuis and #Jorginho you shouldn't expect anything less...They two players made the goal possible, not Son. Any other player would have done same against Jorginho and Luis
@gunnerqueen A sign that it's giving sleepless nights before yesterday üòÇ
@ChelseaFC If #Sarri proves stubborn like other #Chelseafc managers by not restating #Kante as a defensive midfielder, he should be sacked with #Jorginho immediately. You can't have the best in a position and playing him out of position, that's #puremadness #YouStillDehSmokeWeed?
@ChelseaFC Even "god" of football will be unhappy with #Sarri for playing #Kante out of position. It's an offence playing #Jorginho in a defensive position while #N'Golo(world best defensive midfielder) is playing in attacking position. It shows both players and #Sarri should get to work..
@NizaarKinsella #Sarri talking about playing badly in the physical side of it sounds hypocritical to say the least, considering the fact that he was talking the other time as if taking to gym is not necessary in football...#Chelseafc players looked featherweight against #TottenhamHotspurs
@ChelseaFC #TottenhamHotspurs didn't beat #Chelseafc rather #Chelseafc players beat Chelseafc...#SarriStopWastingKanteTalent... Sarri should use Kante in place of #Jorginho as the later is becoming useless when pressured. Just tell Kante what to do there
@ChelseaFC #SarriBall has been missing for many matches now &amp; am not surprised of the scoreline today because I had been smelling it. #Chelseafc players had been playing lazy ftball lacking purpose for many matches before #Spurs game. They lack the short quick forward passes we saw earlier
@gate17marco If #Jorginho can't play when pressured, then he is useless &amp; shd nt start again. #Sarri by now shld knw that he shd use #Kante where Jorginho is playing right now since Jorginho can't play again.Just teach him what to do there, that's all he needs. #SarristopWastingKanteAbility
For many matches now we are not being entertained again with "SarriBall" by #Chelseafc players. #Sarriball is all about players being close to each other and playing short quick forward passes...
WELCOME TO UIS77 BLOG: Does The World Have Diversities In Marriage? https://t.co/LoIYK0ZT3x
#Chelseafc should give #Sarri the players he wants in order to play his real pattern of football just like #Mancity gave #PepGuardiola... Some players are very hard to coach
@CFCMod_ I love watching #JoseMourinho's mad reaction at Stamford Bridge when #Chelseafc coach celebrated in front of him; his reaction there makes me laugh like never before üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ ....Caption: #JoseMourinhoMadnessAtStamfordBridge...He acted like a wild school boy... #ManchesterUnited
@ayo_satish @CFCMod_ Lucky wins making people open their gutters; these lucky late wins, @ManchesterUnited, won't last and can't get any üèÜ. Jose cried when #Chelseafc coach celebrated in front of him, but derives joy doing to others...

@Lacazettes Is that a friendly match?
@RorySmith @superal999 @Jay82_LFC I put it to you that Man city will lose to Chelseafc, I don't judge with Southampton
@shanu_sas It's because they are playing with 10 man behind the ball in fear of being disorganized and loaded with goals by Chelseafc
@Munchbunch87 @AndyHamilton13 @WingsScotland That's the kind statistics you get from double bus parkers
@CFCMod_ Maybe the person is already seeing Eden Hazard in Real Madrid colours, thus,  did not include him in the his/her count...
@ChelseaRumours With the kind of football #Sarri plays, #Chelseafc can always win with bigger margins without #EdenHazard, as they play more as a unit and faster when playing without Eden Hazard
@CFCMod_ This is sounding like what #Chelseafc paid to get players like #CezarAzpilicueta &amp; #EdenHazard; absolute bargain @RossBarkley... However, he should have #Sarri to thank, for the kind of football Sarri plays suits Barkley well.
@dayo4gold1 @BBCSport As every normal human being would have fought #JoseMourinho when he poked former #FCB's manager, late #Tito in the eyes? Guy, you should know that "PATIENCE AND TOLERANCE" makes one a real/matured man. #Jose always allow emotions to get better part of him; he needs to grow up
@_photoboy @WAGNH_CFC The reason why we have managers is the same reason why we have club captains. More than 95% of winning a üèÜ depends on the quantity of players at your disposal; what is the probability of Pep or Jose winning EPL with championship team?
@dayo4gold1 @BBCSport The club gave him trophies by recruiting the right players; if #JoseMourinho gives trophies he would have given #Chelseafc #ChampionsLeagueTrophy CFC owner was hungrily looking for then. Also, he would have given #ManUnited #epl title, or wouldn't he like to give United that???
@ChomskyHonk @WAGNH_CFC How many goals does he have the energy to celebrate this days? He is a confused humanbeing. How many managers would react the same way he reacted when the chelseafc assistant mger celebrated in front of him? He started disrespecting cfc when he went to ManU, so he is classless
@_photoboy @WAGNH_CFC How did #JoseMourinho gave #Chelseafc 3 EPL titles? Did he enter pitch one day to defend ball,  lay a pass, give an assist or score a goal? If Jose gives title, don't you think he would like to give #ManchesterUnited one or would have given CFC #ChampionsLeagueTrophy?
@KingRVD10 @WAGNH_CFC @Chelsea_HQ Nobody cares whether you are a #Chelseafc fan or not, but the fact remains that #JoseMourinho who started criticizing CFC immediately he went to #ManUnited doesn't deserve respect from CFC, just like #ThibautCourtois...Respect is reciprocal
@JSdeportes @WAGNH_CFC Terry, Lampard,  Drogba, Rubben, etc in their prime made him great, and it's #Chelseafc that bought those players with their money, not that #JoseMourinho picked and natured them from CFC academy
@IrvinDsouza1 @WAGNH_CFC Coconut head you are; did #JoseMourinho entered pitch to play football that he won it for #CFC? Had it been #Chelseafc won #CL üèÜ during his time, he would have said he gave CFC the üèÜ
@CFCDaily @WAGNH_CFC @WeAre_TheShed #JoseMourinho reacted angrily like a baby breast milk was taken away from his mouth @StamfordBridge #ChelseafcVSManchesterUnited
@jowizee @WAGNH_CFC @SpicyMommyy Who made him great in English football? #Chelseafc of course, and he should respect that....#CFC always make average manager to look great
@designatedkyle @WAGNH_CFC You better keep quiet
@ESPNFC #JoseMourinho didn't win any 3 premier league trophies for #Chelseafc rather CFC players gave him 3 epl trophies like they gave CL trophy and FA cup to Di Matteo, gave #EPLTrophy and #FACup to #Conte,  etc. If Jose can give a club epl trophy, he would have given 1 to #ManUnited
@SquawkaNews In control because he(#JoseMourinho) didn't believe that he could get a draw at #StamfordBridge...He could easily lose at #United next time
@SkySportsPL @ManUtd It's always #JoseMourinho's comment when he achieved something he thought was impossible; he didn't believe that #ManchesterUnited could be leading #Chelseafc...I ask him, how many minutes did ManU played well?
@Omojuwa If you don't know football, you shd go and sit down... #JoseMourinho started the fight by continuously picking on #Chelseafc when he joined #ManUnited just like #ThibautCourtois was doing when joined #RealMadrid. He shd know that Cfc made him; let him win epl wt United let's see.
@TheBeardedRauI They shld continue doing it to #JoseMourinho because he was the one that started the fight, just like #ThibautCourtois; he joined #ManchesterUnited and started picking on #Chelseafc instead of concentrating on his new job.Hope you have no short memory. He should ask for 4giveness
@MourinhoMindset Explain yourself....and if you can't, you should stop making useless comments
@BBCSport If #JoseMourinho thinks that he won 3 premiership for #Chelseafc why not him repeat the same thing with #ManchesterUnited. Jose should know that CFC give trophies to managers not the other way round. CFC even gave Di Matteo FA cup and Champions League üèÜ

@frankieifop #Chelseafc will come to Anfield to beat #Liverpoolfc again and you will continue blabbing. I know that you said Liverpoolfc would destroy Chelseafc in today's encounter, after  the later knocked the former out...üòÇ
@frankieifop Without Sturridge #Liverpoolfc would have conceded 3 solid goals without scoring any against #Chelseafc. And I think #Kepa would have kept that goal that passed #Alisson but Alisson would not have stopped the one that passed Kepa

@aaronmacn Only if other clubs didn't come for him; brand of football a manager plays might determine his decision to join a particular club
@Squawka @muhammadbutt If you put #PaulPogba under Mauricio #Sarri of #Chelseafc,  you will not recognize him as the Pogba playing for #ManchesterUnited under #JoseMourinho. Tactics kill many players in football; Jose can play attacking football, so I don't know why he doesn't like that brand of ftball
@_ufeely @George_K_Monch But what does KDB do in football other than his dead ball pingings, for you to even think of comparing him with Eden Hazard?
@ACurtisLFC @SkySportsNews @hazardeden10 You should be banned from watching football
@paavoplatform Is like you just start watching football
@redmanmaiden @Trent66Arnold As players, Eden Hazard, as usual, played better football last season than Mo Salah.The only thing you can say in favour of Salah is his efforts on goal due to position he was meant to play against the one Hazard was playing for Chelseafc. Remove goals, b/w the 2 who is better?

@EHamer37 @LiamWhite94 @markgoldbridge Ask or Google #PhilJones
@AddictedToCFC @markgoldbridge Forget about that person that talks with sentiments, with their talks we shall know them; even if Eden Hazard scores 100 goals, this kind of haters will still find away of talk him that. But the beautiful thing is that your opinion can't change the fact that he is the best
@markgoldbridge Do you know what is called shit? Stop using words you know nothing about; what would you want him or players like Messi do against WestHam United that decided to park bus with all their players behind the ball throughout the duration of the match???
@markgoldbridge Try to appreciate the best; https://t.co/lSP41peczK
@markgoldbridge Which big team in the premier league that #EdenHazard has not scored beautiful goal(s) against, and made their players looked like schoolboys? #Arsenalfc, #ManchesterUnited , #Liverpoolfc, #TottenhamHotspur, #Mancity,  etc?
@markgoldbridge Has those you mentioned scored such a goal in their life before? See, forget this goals issues people like you raise against #EdenHazard,  when you talk about real footballers , those players you mentioned are not upto half of Eden Hazard and those players know it also
@realmadrid @SevillaFC That's the kind of scoreline that goes against you when you have #ThibautCourtois as the GM of your goal post...üòÇ...Sorry #RealMadrid üòÇ
@aa9skillz #RealMadrid sold Hummer(#CR7) to buy basket(#ThibautCourtois)....What I see when watching football, many won't see it in their lifetime; I remember telling one Madrid fan that without #CR7 Real Madrid were as ordinary as he could think about the world "Ordinary"...He said never!

@Sibonginkhosi_G @trulymadlybong @brfootball @Cristiano @realmadriden @thibautcourtois You don't need to remind us that bc we knew he was in goal in that single low match. However, being in goal against a weak team shows that he was bought to warm the bench when serious match is going on, unless the first choice keeper gets injured

@LilHaydar @UberCheIseaFC He forces himself to be the best with mouth...God knows that I never rated #ThibautCourtois few matches after he took over NO. 1 spot @Chelseafc; he was looking weak and basket-like whenever defense was exposed.
@UberCheIseaFC What ever #ThibautCourtois thinks he has achieved in his playing career, he achieved those being in #Chelseafc's payroll, and I don't think he will achieve more even being in #RealMadrid payroll.  #Thibaut has physical presence but lack mental presence(He is dwarf mentally)
@Sporf @thibautcourtois @ChelseaFC It's what being on the bench most of the time during match day can cause a player; #ThibautCourtois has already lost concentration  being on #RealMadrid bench. I guess he is enjoying the bench as you can see he mostly look at the sky and wall of people
@NedumAnselm1 @GoalUK @thibautcourtois #ThibautCourtois is more or less a basket; was a better goalkeeper while at #AtleticoMadrid but mostly gave man heartache inbetween #Chelseafc goal post. His performances against #Roma and #FCB in last season's #UEFA Champions League can testify üòÇ
@realmadriden @thibautcourtois It's laughable seeing this egocentric  being, #ThibautCourtois, accepting to be a backup goalkeeper at #RealMadrid. I am laughing in Latin...How warm is your bench, I guess it was really hot before you were called up against a very weak team? Still like yourself, no clean sheet
@thibautcourtois The comparison you made between #Chelseafc and #RealMadrid we already knew it before you opened your gutters, but what we didn't know was that you 'r going to Madrid to be a backup goalkeeper mostly warming Real bench;can only play matches involving weak oppositions. Enjoy it üòÇ

@MrGeorgeBenson it gets to show that having #Pedro and #Barkley on is better for #Sarriball
@ChelseaFC @marcosalonso03 I was away and therefore not watching the game, but I know that the reason why #Chelseafc have not scored is because players like #EdenHazard, #Willians are not making quick passes which #Sarriball demands
@FetteCity @emeogbonna121 @Forbes_Cfc Therefore, stop making subjective comparisons...When one tries to make comparisons between two persons, all things suppose to be logically equal. For instance, one should be looking at things like "if I give two managers thesame team under same condition(s), who will win more"
@ConteBlueArmy Inclusion of #EdenHazard against #NewcastleUnited slowed #Chelseafc's passing game under #Sarri, as Hazard tended to delay passes while thinking whether to dribble pass opponents. This pissed me off bc #CFC needed to move the ball faster to draw Newcastle United out of shape
@emeogbonna121 @Forbes_Cfc Pep should manage those teams #Sarri were managing then, let see how many trophies he would have won with those clubs/teams. Are you saying that Sarri wouldn't win anything if he inherited the teams #Pep inherited at #FCB, #Bayern &amp; #Mancity?
@MrVincredible #JoseMourinho has made it clear that he can't give you the both of beautiful football +winning like #Pep, etc. He said the #media, #ManchesterUnited and football world that they should choose whether to be entertained without results or to play ugly with good results. Choose! üòÇ
@SunSport @TheSun If #JoseMourinho loses his #ManchesterUnited job which team is his likely destination? Jose Mourinho should ditch defensive mindsets of football and go all out for attacking football; his team will be very dangerous playing attacking football as Jose is a clever person
#ThibautCourtois should make himself comfortable on Real Madrid bench, after all it was what he bargained or signed for...Thibaut do you need #EdenHazard to come and keep you company? Nah! He is wiser than you to know that #Chelseafc is a better place for him to be üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ

@Duniamurakami @oddwreckinReed @ClinicaIEden Oh! now not his fault, but those goals against Chelseafc were Kepa's eeh? Nobody said De Gea was not good, but you sounded certain that he would have caught those goals Arsenalfc scored against Kepa. You guys will start an argument, and will lose track of your argument...Is funny
@Duniamurakami @oddwreckinReed @ClinicaIEden Must he make an outstanding save in every match?  Sometimes, we argue blindly where commonsense should have taught us otherwise...In recent times, the arguments most football spectators come up with are meaningless and deserve no time at all
@Duniamurakami @oddwreckinReed @ClinicaIEden 3 goals have already passed #DavidDeGea against common #Brightoncity under 45 mins. Who knows how many will go pass himself in full time. What excuse do you have for that? Going by your judgement, it's safe to say De Gea is not worthy of the ¬£200k/wk he is earning at #ManUnited?
@ManUtd @RomeluLukaku9 #ManchesterUnited's goal was much like their system/style of playing the game of football, very haphazard/unorganised...
@ChelseaFC #Chelseafc conceded especially the 2nd goal because #CFC players failed/seemed not to recognize things happening around them in their 18yard box; They failed to mark/block off #Arsenalfc players waiting to receive passes in in CFC 18yard box. Sarri should be aware and correct it
@Abiodunlavish @nebsjnr Just prepare your mind, he will sign for Chelseafc on a permanent basis at the end of the season
@madridcentre https://t.co/iCmlYtkeEP
@madridcentre https://t.co/AACqEeEb2l
@madridcentre There is no need mentioning Real Madrid here, he is currently a Chelseafc player and I don't think he is going back to Madrid after this season...In case, just prepare your mind about that
@Squawka #MateoKovacic very much at home and looking finer in #chelseafc shirt...You are surely a blue!
@Squawka His work rate will make him push players like Barkley, RLC, etc out of 1st team squad

@FenomenoSZN @HAMP1NHO @brfootball @hazardeden10 Even if Eden Hazard didn't score a goal or provided an assist per season, he is the best player in EPL. And if scoring goals and providing assists are what matters in ftball, players like N'Golo Kante wouldn't 've been regarded very important, ¬£75m wouldn't go for a defender, etc
@FenomenoSZN @HAMP1NHO @brfootball @hazardeden10 And you know that you can't even use the word "good" when describing Eden Hazard, the better word should be "Excellent" or the phrase "World-class"
@HAMP1NHO @FenomenoSZN @brfootball @hazardeden10 Somebody that knows football and his right senses will know that with or without goals, Eden Hazard is among the best 3 players in the world of football. No argument about that, unless one who is very sentimental
@FenomenoSZN @HAMP1NHO @brfootball @hazardeden10 Do you have control of assists? For instance, he would have gotten two assists if Giroud had scored but in the end he has 1 assist bc Giroud couldn't score. D4 I don't judge him base on goals/assists, rather his overall performance; what Eden brings to a team is more than goals
@theayoadams Copy-copy
@iAdokano Do you know what is clean sheet? What he kept last week is called what?
@_lfcleanne Wait and see if Allison won't concede 2 goals or even more in a match...We deh here deh watch...
@ClinicaIEden You have not seen cheaper goals that had passed Dea Gea? Alot cheaper goals had passed Dea Gea, therefore, how did you know that he would have caught at least one?
@Laykerzpr Keep quiet my friend!
@WAGNH_CFC It's coming from those desperate to see him concedes goal(s) and have been saving all those nonsense for like today he conceded a goal. Did you hear any of them last week Kepa didn't concede a goal?
@badgalmaddie_ Am not seeing the goal rush...Is 2 goals goal rush? Tell us goalkeeper who has never conceded 2 goals per match when defense exposed?
@ogbeni_opa Is that all from you? You can do better...
@fabolous3d So when defense was exposed, goalkeeper shouldn't be scored? If so, why did experienced goalkeeper in Petr Cech conceded 3 goals? Show us goalkeeper in the world that have not conceded 2 goals in a match before?
@Kechy_A Nobody wants to mark #EdenHazard again üòÇ üòÇ
@Swirlkous_Killa @CareFreeRomeo @brfootball @hazardeden10 Everything right without trophies
@HAMP1NHO @FenomenoSZN @brfootball @hazardeden10 That's what people that compare him with players that score alot of goals fail to understand. Things Eden Hazard brings to a team are far more than goals. He can single handedly change a game which those goalscorers like Mo Salah, etc will find difficult to do...
@AlexGoldberg_ Those that compare Eden Hazard with players like Mo Salah, because Salah scores more goals, are very myopic; they don't know anything about football. Mo Salah can never bring the kind of influence Eden Hazard brings to a team. Salah can only play well when LFC are playing well.
#DavidLuiz should be more serious when playing football, you should be making quicker decisions when passing ball. He is slow to my liking. If not, he should feel bad when Andreas Christensen start benching him.
@AFCBvB1410 @Jerry_I_is @Griffsean12 Liverpoolfc was also better than Chelseafc by miles last season, but at the end of the season which team had something to show for the season? #FACup üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
@CRFC_reds05 You think that #LiverpoolfcDefence is good? Never mind, we "lol get an answer when they meet other big teams
@ChelseaFC #Cfc players do not have legs to play #Sarri ball.When players see #Mancity players play the high pressing game  for full time, they feel like being in their team. But question is that, do you have the energy to play that game? #Willian and #Pedro are not helping the full backs

@SilverDeGeneral @foreverchels92 @Koianu @CFC Let me ask you, without goals will you consider Mo Salah as a good player? Does he do enough on the pitch(apart from goals which are put in a plate for him by teammates) for you to even mention him where Eden Hazard is?
@SilverDeGeneral @foreverchels92 @Koianu @CFC Have you seen an injured or unfit player going to worldcup?
@UMAD @shahrezH @magical_Eden @Daniel_Flapjack @abubakr_elnino @Kloppaganda @CFCMod_ @hazardeden10 @LFC @MoSalah @premierleague You will pay the asking price for Real Madrid?

@UMAD @abubakr_elnino @morris_frank15 @shahrezH @magical_Eden @Daniel_Flapjack @Kloppaganda @CFCMod_ @hazardeden10 @LFC @MoSalah @premierleague @ChelseaFC How can you compare a Chelseafc reject to Eden Hazard Real Madrid are begging to pay ¬£200m on his head with just 2 years remaining in his CFC contract? There is always levels in world of football, Hazard sits with the likes of Messi, C.Ronaldo and Neymar. Salah is still learning
@UMAD @abubakr_elnino @morris_frank15 @shahrezH @magical_Eden @Daniel_Flapjack @Kloppaganda @CFCMod_ @hazardeden10 @LFC @MoSalah @premierleague @ChelseaFC Mind you, the biggest stage in football is worldcup...How far with Mo Salah? Mo Salah is good goal scorer but still remain a chelseafc reject
#CristianoRonaldoless #RealMadrid lost 4-2 to #AtleticoMadrid in 2018 #UEFASuperCup...Can they be a force in Europe like when Ronaldo was around?
This solo goal #DiegoCosta just scored against #RealMadrid in the #UEFAsupercup shows the extent of damage Antonio Conte caused #Chelseafc in the striker department. Conte didn't realize that Costa gave him #epl trophy
@WeAreChelseaFC Remember when this black Evertonfc player was considered to be better than N'Golo Kante...When chips are down, Kante always üòÅ last
@UMAD @shahrezH @magical_Eden @Daniel_Flapjack @abubakr_elnino @Kloppaganda @CFCMod_ @hazardeden10 @LFC @MoSalah @premierleague With or without goals, you placing Mo Salah beside Eden Hazard can only be done out of sentiments. The whole world know that there is no comparison between the two; Eden is on another world to Salah

The magic Hazard brings to game of football, how many players do you think can do that?
@UMAD @shahrezH @magical_Eden @Daniel_Flapjack @abubakr_elnino @Kloppaganda @CFCMod_ @hazardeden10 @LFC @MoSalah @premierleague If football is all about goals, Liverpoolfc wouldn't have spent ¬£75m on defender and ¬£65m on goal keeper. Mind you, Salah is a Chelseafc reject üòÇ while Eden is the main man. What Hazard worth in the transfer market, at most Salah is half of it.
@SilverDeGeneral @foreverchels92 @Koianu @CFC Watch Salah, whenever Liverpoolfc are being dominated, you will hardly know that he is on the pitch...
@SilverDeGeneral @foreverchels92 @Koianu @CFC Russia2018Worldcup
@SilverDeGeneral @foreverchels92 @Koianu @CFC Why it's risky having a Salah type of player is that, Salah performance depends on his fellow players; he can't do well when his teammates are not doing well. While for E. Hazard,  the entire team depends on him to do well; in a tight game,  the team depends on him to do well.
@paige_army My #Chelseafc team against #Arsenalfc next week: Kepa, Cesar, Rudiger,  Luis,  Emerson, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, Willian, Pedro, Hazard
@SweeperKepa How many keeper transfered with world record fee didn't concede a goal in a season? Man grow up and stop talking like a kid....Or better still just watch and stop commenting
@SCOANTBJoshua Amen!!!!
@RealTomHoskins @GensCornelia @mbatshuayi All your multiple sources are just making a guess work; they were all making reference to the statement made by #Chelaeafc and #RealMadrid as buy option was not mentioned , missing the fact that thesame two clubs didn't say there was no buy option.
@RealTomHoskins @GensCornelia @mbatshuayi Source?
@RealTomHoskins @GensCornelia @mbatshuayi Was there any place where #RealMadrid or #Chelseafc mentioned the issue of "buy-clause". Therefore, stating it specifically that there was no option to buy is misleading. And from words of the player &amp; a little from Sarri, I will even believe that there is option to buy...
@TodaysFootyNews #Chelseafc can only accept the ¬£200m from #RealMadrid for #EdenHazard if there will be an agreement that he can only join Real Madrid next season #laliga
@Blue_Footy Obviously, #MateoKovacic is a blue4Life...No way he will go back to #RealMadrid; there are more than  one sign that there is silent clause of making his loan move permanent  at the end of the season.
@Bruce_Wayne_05 @RobbieFowIer @CallumWright__ Don't jump into an argument like a mad person; first follow the argument from the beginning before  making useless comment...
@Bruce_Wayne_05 @RobbieFowIer @CallumWright__ Don't just comment bc there is something attached to your body called mouth. In other words, think with your brain not your mouth/hand. B/4 you say anything, you have to understand the issue a hand first. The questn is, the worth of Allison transfer is it ¬£55m or ¬£65m? Simple!
@_AdvaitVeer_ @CallumWright__ When you watch the types of saves Kepa made &amp; that of Allison, you will agree with me that Kepa wld have been preferred to start for Brazil(If a Brazilian) at the World over Allison; Allison mostly have saves with the ball pushed back inside his 18 yard box instead of outside it
@Bruce_Wayne_05 @RobbieFowIer @CallumWright__ What's the "fact" I should accept???
@ESPNUK #ThibautCourtois should know that it's a normal thing for a former player to congratulate the other, just like #JohnTerry did.. But for #EdenHazard whose family is well settled in #London to follow you to #Madrid, you are on your own...
@FootbalIStuff It's you and you alone that is in fear that #EdenHazard is not leaving #Chelseafc
@goal If #ThibautCourtois really wants to play with #EdenHazard he wouldn't have left #Chelseafc for #RealMadrid because Eden's family is happy living in #London and not want to move.
@NatSportUAE #Sarri's #Chelseafc is never complete until he finds a real striker, in the mould/mood of #DidierDrogba or #DiegoCosta... It's the area #CFC are lacking somebody. But I think #MichyBatsuayi will do good job if given good chance.
@NigeriaNewsdesk @todayng #EdenHazard's #family is also happy living in #London as ThibautCourtois' family is happy living in Madrid. Therefore, going by Courtois reasons of living #Chelseafc Hazard won't like to leave London he/his family are well settled in
@standardsport @sjstandardsport Is selfish #ThibautCourtois wanting #EdenHazard to join him @RealMadrid when Eden's family is happy &amp; well settled in London as Thibaut's family is settled in Madrid???
@King_HCQ Is #ThibautCourtois Eden Hazard's father that determine where he will be? #EdenHazard is too big to listen to advice of a betrayer(Courtois) who fucked #KDB girlfriend
@iam_zuby You're on point; #Chelseafc do not need #UEFA #CL to attract players. Their sexy name "Chelseafc" alone is so magnatic that it can attract very good players, with or without CL
@UberCheIseaFC @thibautcourtois Sentiment apart, I never rated #ThibautCourtois since he became #Chelseafc's No.1; We was very good in goalpost for Atletico Madrid than he was for Chelseafc
@Teju_____ It gets to show you the pulling power of #Chelseafc; Cfc do not need any external help,  e.g CL, to attract players. Therefore, don't mention #UEFA competition as a yardstick when #CFC are involved in player transfer. Even their name "Chelseafc" is enough to attract a player
@RobbieFowIer @CallumWright__ What is the worth of Allison's deal to Liverpoolfc?
@CallumWright__ You're moronic.... Just watch football and stop commenting...You know nothing...
@CallumWright__ You are being obsessed by #Chelseafc, did they rape your wife?  When last did Liverpoolfc win a trophy in #Englishfootball? They, with Allison, may still go trophyless this season
@CallumWright__ From ¬£65m to ¬£57m, what are you smoking?
@mdeeks76 @CallumWright__ #Chelseafc can finish d season again winning trophy while #Liverpoolfc may go home empty handed, still asking when #Klopp will smell a trophy. #Conte who came to premiership after Klopp won 2 trophies &amp; went while Klopp is still punching air dreaming when to win a trophy in #EPL
@CallumWright__ #Chelseafc got a better deal than #Liverpoolfc in the goalkeeping department;  CFC will get  ¬£35m by selling Courtois and spend ¬£71m for new fantastic keeper, age 23yrs. Net-spending =¬£36m. While Liverpoolfc paid ¬£65m for 26yr old keeper .
@CaraotaDigital @CaraotaDeportes Legend is back doing what he knows best #EdenHazard
But #ThibautCourtois is not good in distributing ball, therefore not good for Sarri style of play; #Chelseafc should kick him out for another keeper. It's only #EdenHazard deserves to be fought for. https://t.co/LIwEYg2aGg
@crownstory @Denye007 You can only be allowed to watch football not to comment because you know nothing about the game...
@akaebube Who are you that Eden Hazard will listen to you? #akara
@crownstory @Denye007 Your comment shows that you are always afraid of anything concerning Chelseafc; it's people like you that are fasting for Eden Hazard to leave CFC because of fear. Now,  your nerves have calmed  a little bit because Sarri who has managed CFO for like 2 weeks now lost to Man city
@Emperor_derek Does #Sarri need welcome when he is already manager an #epl team. How many years did it take #PepGuardiola to start winning things with his #Mancity team?
@CarefreeDailyFC Whoever talking against #Sarri at this point in time is a disgrace to football world and doesn't deserve to watch game of football. Real football fans are always objective in their analysis because the know football well.
@WAGNH_CFC Sarri system needs young energic runners; many #Chelseafc players are currently not suitable for the system as they can't run slot for 90 minutes. For instance, #CescFerbregas, #Alonso,  #DavidLuis,  etc
@ChelseaFC What I observed is that #Manchestercity players have mastered their system far more than #Chelseafc players and move the ball with much purpose. #Sarri should make them move ball with real purpose
@ChelseaFC @ManCity It's not a surprise or it's expected because #PepGuardiola have been implementing his style of play with #Mancity for more than 2 seasons now while #Sarri has not trained with #Chelseafc players more than a month
#CommunityShield: #Chelseafc players still lack the energy required to play #Sarri ball; in the second half they were very slow and lost ball to #Manchestercity players often than not. #CFC also lack striker presence, and those were the lost of #DiegoCosta comes in
@Audzamash @cy_mureithi @ChelseaFC You know that "like" is no more "mere" it's valuable/expensive right now lol. Let me give you one
@MailSport I don't think #Chelseafc are holding up #ThibautCourtois transfer, it's #RealMadrid that is holding him by not trying to pay something that can be considered reasonable transfer fee for him, with one year remaining in his contract
@E_lighthouse You are on your own with the person lol
@GarryHacker @TheBlues___ Let them sell him to Derby county for ¬£10m so that there won't be competition
@KwakuAhenkorah3 Obviously, Jose Mourinho is too mechanical in his approach to life. Life should be always a do or die affair; he should take things easy with some love
@SaddickAdams #ManchesterUnited and #JoseMourinho in particular, have damaged #AnthonyMartial's career
@SayNoMore33 You guys should allow him go, am blaming #ManchesterUnited that refuse to grow up and allow a player to wants out to leave. #Chelseafc sell without minding the club that wants to buy, and united should do so...
@Guardiolista07 #ManchesterUnited and #JoseMourinho are fighting their player #AnthonyMartial...

@AnfieldAn Going by your view, #Mane could be better than #Zidane, but in reality Mane may never reach the levels of players like #EdenHazard and Zidane in his playing career...You should show respect to who deserves it...
@Skerfy I think so...I pray and hope #Chelseafc get a better deal with #ThibautCourtois...I really can't wait to see that selfish moaner(who made cfc to sell true blue #PetrCech) out of the club
@wadja_roland @ChelseaFC #ThibautCourtois is naturally a selfish person, right from day one I know that. #Chelseafc will be better(more stable)if he leaves. At least, there won't be a moaner in the team. #PetreCech I respect so much.
@ChelseaFC @AlvaroMorata #AlvaroMorata has just realized what I told him when he signed for #Chelseafc not to wear the NO.9 for the club. Now, by not wearing the "cursed" No.9 jersey of #CFC fans should be ready to watch new Morata with loads of goals

@perchal @ChelseaFC Klopp should be considered a total failure or fraud at Liverpoolfc if after spending all this money and he doesn't win anything in 2018/2019 season...No more time

@badr_aldafiri @hazardeden10 Pay up and Eden Hazard will be yours #¬£200m+
@Blue_Footy Have you considered the effect of having Eden Hazard at the right; will he be effective like when he is playing left side of CFC attack? Eden is very important to cfc, d/4 where he will be more effective shouldn't be compromised
@Hustler_Futbol Like I said about Mo Salah when being compared with Eden Hazard in terms of goal,  Mane is never at the level of Eden no matter how many goals he has scored. Mane how far at the #Worldcup2018?
@Blue_Footy I personally think that Eden Hazard should still maintain the left-wing spot while CHO being his understudy; Eden's replacement in each match
@benmurraybruce @OfficialPDPNig @NGRSenate @bukolasaraki @APCNigeria You people should grow up; this man has been using your heads as ladder to climb to a greater height in his political career; he jumping back to PDP is not for your sake but for himself alone
@bukolasaraki #Nigeria politicians can't stay one place and think more about how to meet the general interest or interest of the nation, they will be jumping up and down protecting their own selfish interest
@OgbeniDipo Because he saw that Man united have a head that refuses to play attractive football and he doesn't want a club that only rely on past history; he needs a club he can make his own history with.
@ConteBlueArmy @ChelseaFC Mind you, Sarri has not stayed up to a complete season; I could remember when all were happy with Conte that Jose had left
@ConteBlueArmy @instagram @ChelseaFC For his left mind; what has #NemanjaMatic achieved in his own time with his "best club in the whole world"(#ManUnited), nothing I guess and that is what matters most

@KylianMbappe_7 @AS_Monaco_EN @pfc_cska I wonder how a club will turn a player into a super star under a year üòÇ.  It's all about greed that have entered into football; Bakayoko that cost Chelseafc cool ¬£40m is among the superstar produced by AS Monaco?
@iam_OluwaSkt @SeretteN @MorataReloaded Chelseafc didn't finish in 13th position. However, if there is a good replacement for Matic(and keeping other good players), Chelseafc would have finished in top 4 last season.
@iam_OluwaSkt @SeretteN @MorataReloaded A player can be in a wrong place at any point in time. I mean, we are not talking about United players rather having Matic in a Chelsea FC squad would have had Chelseafc finishing above ManU in #EPL
@iam_OluwaSkt @SeretteN @MorataReloaded Remember that even Burnley at a point had chance to finish in top 4 but what happened at last is what you should be talking about, bc nearly they say can't kill a bird; CFC missed Matic's experience
@CareFreeBailey @MorataReloaded Thanks to Eden Hazard's solo effort. And when I said free of charge I was not referring to money rather transfer without stress or condition such as not wanting to sell to a rival.
@iam_OluwaSkt @SeretteN @MorataReloaded When you beat Manchester United what then happened? They finished above you with Matic on their side. Winning EPL is all about having players with winning mentality not just beating United
@FIFAWorldCup @TeamRussia James Rodriguez did more and how far with him today? #WorldcupGoals do not matter much
@AS_Monaco_EN @pfc_cska Hope you will remember the amount of ¬£m you bought him before you will start quoting an outrageous fee for who wants to buy him in a year or few years to come.
@AS_Monaco_EN @pfc_cska To sell him next transfer window; AS Monaco is more of a business club than football club.
@batey_stuart @ManUtd @ChelseaFC @willianborges88 @SkyKaveh @skysports_sheth The Sky Sports also confirmed that Anthony Marshal is going the other way round(to #Chelseafc)
@yasarleecooper So #ManchesterUnited are thinking that only them have brain of not letting their players to get transferred to another EPL club, but do buy from other #EPL clubs eeeh?
@RedUtdDevil @Daniel42163903 @AnthonyMartial To win EPL that has been eluding #ManchesterUnited for a long time now
@MorataReloaded But we did it for him free of charge when he took away #NemanjaMatic which made #Chelseafc to finish 5th with #Bakayoko. Now, it's time for #Jose to reciprocate the gesture

@delphine9721 @itzdaphenom @ChelseaFC @tammyabraham I will come back to you in fews days to come, by then Golovin must have signed the dotted lines
@AnukaPrince Being #logical there girl
@Na8yKeita @ClinicaIEden @elitealisson1 Whether first or not, the fact is that you are a big spender in your moves to buy trophies #Liverpoolfc as #Manchestercity  did
#Klopp suggestion that "he would quit the game if large fees like #PaulPogba's move to #ManchesterUnited became the norm rather than the exception" was born out of jealousy considering what #Liverpoolfc are doing now in #transfermarket
@10BillionXD @PGCFC001 Hope you will bring part of the üí∞?
@ClinicaIEden @elitealisson1 I wonder when #Liverpoolfc and #Klopp will win something...They are trying hard by pumping in more money but trophies continue to elude them in recent time. Can you do it this year?
@AOkhotko @NateMusic13 Very funny
@edugmng @2kman__ See your head
@kwakutoday2 Their "imminent" no deh finish?
@SiPhillipsSport If #Sarri manages to put Ross #Barkley's football career back on track, Poch and #Spurs will be like "I would have signed him", just like #ArseneWenger
@SiPhillipsSport Barkley naturally has the talent to become a football üåü If he is injury free and focus more on reaching the height he should reach, he will be a star
@marwanoinidzic The odd man there is #ManchesterUnited's Jose Mourinho who does like to park üöå while others like playing attacking football #epl
@AnukaPrince üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ this lady eeeh... Just imagining how sweet your üíã are when making this comment...
@KofiGyabaa @MatteoPedrosi @CarefreeDailyFC Is like Sarri is already leading Chelseafc astray in terms of players to buy. Golovin is the kind of player Emenalo will like to sign,  just like KDB,  Sarah, etc
@Blue_Footy @cozierpanda To me, #Chelseafc has signed #Golovin already and are relaxed. Just like #Mancity, #Monaco maybe doubting until Golovin holds Chelseafc iconic blue jersey
@delphine9721 @itzdaphenom @ChelseaFC @tammyabraham https://t.co/dPk0dsgB2w That is your Golovin
@delphine9721 @itzdaphenom @ChelseaFC @tammyabraham Monaco is going to Golovin
@ChelseaFC If Chelseafc miss Golovin for around ¬£27m, I see same Chelseafc begging to buy same player from AS Monaco for ¬£100m next transfer window...#Madness
@MatteoPedrosi I believe the major reason why AS Monaco are trying so hard to sign Golovin is because they see him as a potential ¬£100m player next transfer window; they are a business club
@slimlaydi @kevinsk97 @ChelseaFC @rubey_lcheek Surely you have watched his YouTube, Golovin is really good and will develop further under Sarri
@jzee4edu @ConteBlueArmy @ChelseaFC Go and watch his free kick goal at the Worldcup

If #JoseMourinho leaves #ManchesterUnited today, we will have managers that more or less play attractive football in the top 6 clubs in #EnglishPremierLeague
@SaintSarri @ESPNFC @SteveNicol61 @CBurleyESPN @honigstein You can ask Klopp of #Liverpoolfc
@BelgianFootbal1 @hazardeden10 @ChelseaFC @premierleague @LaLiga Nobody is stopping him, just drop the ¬£200m asking transfer fee and he will leave. Or do you also think that the player you are rating highly should not bring that kind of üí∞ to Chelseafc?

@BBCSport #JoseMourinho should then make move for a player in the shape of N'Golo Kante of #Chelseafc, because I think that was why he played well
#Deltastate #government should provide refuse bins which should be put in various places in the state where people will come and throw their refuse while the govt employ people that can evacuate them regularly
I observed that the government of #Deltastate left refuse evacuation in the hands of individuals or private person which is not regularly effective and efficient
#Deltastate government should go to #Nigeria states like #Imo, #Rivers, etc and ask their various govts how refuses should be handled.
In the area of #refusedisposal there is no government in #Warri, #Deltastate, #Nigeria. People do not have a designated place to throw away refuse in the state.

@WAGNH_CFC Going by this statement, it's obvious that Golovin is going to Chelseafc, and I believe everything had been agreed before this statement.

@GeniusKDB So where does that leave him? He can only play for a club like Man city not a club with Real Madrid status; he can not influence or boss a game single-handedly(that's the kind of players Real need now)
@GeniusKDB How did he perform in the World biggest football stage? Did he score a goal at the Worldcup? In fact, did he even participate in Russia2018?It's all these things that mighty football clubs like Real Madrid look at. üòÇ
@thibautcourtois It's now time to move on...It's obvious that Chelseafc are not much worried if you leave...They may think twice of selling Eden Hazard...They would careless about your hand round the neck of Eden.
@HasbullahIdris7 Chelseafc are known for their ability to give most managers trophies in Abramovic era, irrespective of the manager's philosophy or idealogy of football...So,  am optimistic that same will happen under Sarri
@GeniusKDB Poor analysis! Their possible transfer is in this summer, d/4, next time you try to analyse transfers base your analysis on the form of players in the period of their transfer...What did your Mahrez achieve in 2017/2018? Not upto one-quarter of Hazard's.
@AnfieldAn Liverpoolfc bought Shaqiri ¬£12.5m and spent upward of ¬£70m for a defender, Virgil Van Dijk. So,  what point are you making? üòÇ
@AnfieldAn How many goals did Virgil Van Dijk scored before Liverpoolfc paid upward of ¬£70m for him?
@AnfieldAn If being a world football star is all about GOALS, nobody would have loved to be goal keeper(or like to create chances for another person to score), and a player like Maradona wouldn't have been placed where he is placed in the world of football
@Elowhite4sure @youneshh I pray so,  but if he wishes to go he must fetch Chelseafc upward of ¬£200m...
@idbusayo007 @Squawka FCB, and more recently Man city, showed that playing entertainment football can win you titles honourably...We're looking at the World of football where every team will love to play football...

@idbusayo007 @Squawka Man city vs Liverpool
@idbusayo007 @Squawka Was Man city is Liverpool last season boring to you? The two teams were playing attacking football and everybody enjoyed it. Then imagine how it would be, two teams just sit in their own halves and refusing to play football
@idbusayo007 @Squawka If you are a good player,  you would 've known the difference between enjoying football and chasing the ball around while your opponent play. Even as a fan, you will definitely not be satisfied irrespective of who win.
@ChelseaFC @nglkante Very humble and successful servant...May God continue to bless your efforts...Epitome of simplicity
@idbusayo007 @Squawka I should have known that am talking to who doesn't understand the beautiful game of football; person that only watch, and watch the back of black/white üì∫
https://t.co/DuISTWnsNn
@idbusayo007 @Squawka What are you counter attacking? Like I said earlier, any team that is coming to the pitch to sit deep(park bus) in their own half, only waiting when opponent will make mistakes(instead of forcing it) should just stay at home.
@idbusayo007 @Squawka Have you ever played football in your life to talk about football? No wonder you don't know what is anti-football.. Belgium vs Croatia would have been more entertaining...

@MailSport Croatia did not have many big names #Russia2018worldcup but as a team,  they are the best or strongest...
@idbusayo007 @Squawka I would rather lost enjoying myself in a pitch than winning without the purpose of playing football. You should entertain spectators instead being also a spectator in the pitch.
@idbusayo007 @Squawka If you go into a football match and just sit in your own half allowing one team to play while waiting for a mistake to score a goal, it's better you stay at home or on the stand. Ball is meant to be played.

Less than four years N'Golo Kante has won 2 titles, 1 FA cup and 1 worldcup üèÜ. It shows that God reward selflessness and hardwork. May God reward your efforts as Kante, IJN, amen. #WorldCupFinal
@FutbolBible When you base your argument on consistency, Eden Hazard was more consistent and won many man of the match award in the tournament. Had it been Hazard played in the final, there wouldn't be any contention.
@hazardeden10 What next now? Just tell your agent to let Real Madrid to bring that world record transfer fee(¬£200+) to Chelseafc for your transfer. We need ¬£m for stadium...
@idbusayo007 @Squawka If you have heard it "anti-football" first here, then know that there is nothing like anti-football but if not then know that what France play in semi-final and so far today is that called "anti-football"
@Sport24news Perisic goal and good passing football from Croatia are the only things am taking home so far from this dramatic #Worldcup final
@guardian_sport In as much as am supporting France because of N'Golo Kanye,  France are making me angry with their high-level anti-football. Croatia playing far better...
@Squawka In as much as I want France to win because of Chelseafc's N'Golo Kanye,  France are playing anti-football to the highest order; Croatia deserve the #WorldCup trophy than France..

@ManCityKD @Flaminiesta I think you wanted to say Chelseafc had fewer European trophies than Man city before Abramovic era, see Man city see who will provide Jorginho with CL, they use city to complete the CL number üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
@ManCityKD @Flaminiesta You're refusing to touch the bigger stage issues, why? üòÇ Are you afraid of mentioning European trophies, you go fear my brother üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ!
@ManCityKD @Flaminiesta You're not rich as a club, rather rich as a person. Real players need clubs with history of European trophies and Jorginho found one in Chelseafc that have won all European trophies
@ChelseaFC He is always a blue, but now the real blue of capital city, London.
https://t.co/u7Ym35Xi11
https://t.co/201rU6EGJI
@City_Watch You can say this as a matter of fact without mentioning that the extra money Chelseafc paid is for Sarri release clause. Jorginho rejected Pep for Sarri
@MorataReloaded It is called Sarri-pull or Sarri-effect
@Chelsea_HQ Are Man city still thinking that Napoli are film-tricking them for more üí∞? Go and pay more, you will still see Jorginho at Chelseafc bc the way he is holding his father Sarri axe can't separate them
@CarefreeDailyFC Hard for them to comprehend
@CarefreeDailyFC Yes We Can!
@AlexGoldberg_ Forward ever, backward?
@ferna_fab @BlueSarri18 @GrowinInstagram @RedDevilsDrive @SkySportsNews I see
@PaddyMcElevey @BilboRocky @SayNoMore33 The special thing about Jorginho is when you cast your mind back and remember what Chelseafc did to Man Utd with Mikel, Liverpool with Sarah,  Spurs with Wllians,  Arsenal with many players...üòÇ
@SiPhillipsSport @AlfredoPedulla Chelseafc always do things practically uncommon....They're magical whenever they want to be...Man city are still learning and will continue to learn
@Guardiolista07 @MOJ028 @luke_morg02 Get your facts right, don't jump into conclusions with what you think...Update yourself with the Sarri contractual arrangement with Napoli and why Chelsea had difficulties making their manager
@JCS_MCFC You have already given yourself the fortitude to bear the lost called Jorginhonic...You all caused it, you guys woke the sleeping ü¶Å Roman Abramovic
@Guardiolista07 @MOJ028 @luke_morg02 Practically, Sarri's release clause was the extra fee as  Napoli would never release Sarri without that extra money that covers Sarri's money. It's an arrangement to confuse/calm City down
@MaraveliasJim @Guardiolista07 @MOJ028 @luke_morg02 How much is Sarri's release clause in your mathematics above?
@djwskyblu It's burning your ‚ô• already üòÇ. I wonder how you will feel when Jorginho lays the pass that makes Chelseafc win Man city home and away, then win EPL.
@Guardiolista07 @MOJ028 @luke_morg02 Sarri + Jorginho = ¬£57.4m, does that make Chelseafc the highest bidder? How much did Man city readied to pay Napoli for only Jorginho?
@ferna_fab @BlueSarri18 @GrowinInstagram @RedDevilsDrive @SkySportsNews But Drinkwater won EPL trophy before more than half of Man city squad smelt it. He is their senior in that regard, so accord him well deserved respect as you are buying him
@djwskyblu Who will see a club like Chelseafc(with sexy name) who has won all the European trophies and located in the major city, then move to Man city of yesterday? Jorginho has foresight
@Je_suis_Donne They will learn and fall back to their real self of big spending spending spending. Man city have no natural charm for players; only üí∞ can get them players
@AndyArm01665015 @ManCityMEN When did Manchester city become more successful than Chelseafc? Mind you City will struggle next season as many will beat them at their game like Liverpool did.
@Guardiolista07 @MOJ028 @luke_morg02 Mind you the ‚Ç¨10m you claimed that you didn't pay, Chelsea FC didn't pay it too rather it's for Sarri release. Hence,  Jorginho rejected Pep for Sarri
@BlueSarri18 @ferna_fab @GrowinInstagram @RedDevilsDrive @SkySportsNews Out of anger, Man city is prepared to buy Drinkwater from Chelseafc for ¬£50(¬£40 up front + ¬£10 in bonuses)
@Itsekiriman After missing out on Jorginho, Man city will buy Drinkwater from Chelsesfc for¬£50m(¬£40m up front + ¬£10m in bonuses). Good signing!
@ChelseaJoint Why can't they take a photo of him? Or don"t he and Sarri appear in pics?
@Collo10_Cfc Chelseafc is sexy in the mouth; sexy brand name...Who won't like to be associated with such name. Hazard even said its shirt fits him
@killer_gorton @TommySmith1992 You then need Felani
@Riyadology_7 @RegistaJorgi Better better everywhere, I then wonder why he is always a bench warmer
@Ayotomi_Cfc @SiPhillipsSport Jorginho arrived London before Sarri
@Riyadology_7 @ftbIdan @LukeCFC_1905 @debrxyne @ClementLenglet @SkySportsNews @NabyRole Kovacic has little CL experience compared to Jorginho in the sense that Kovacic is a bench warmer at both club and country levels
@JorginhoRole He actually boarded a private plane at Milan airport to London
@ItsMrBlueGuy Who is the boss here?
@xo_leem Chill sweet babe, it will be official soon.  You know what Chelseafc do not always care about protocols; they like doing things their own way and I love it
@nazhanCfc @Realmadridplace Eden Hazard should be aiming at leaving with a world record transfer fee if he ever wants to leave Chelseafc
@sportzmove How many times will Jorginho set for medicals? Do you people want to reset all parts of him with unending medicals?
@MMount10 He is signing for a club that have won all the European trophies...Is that not a history? What have your club won in Europe? That's a question.
@es_grimes @Keirakilroy @ChelseaFC Sounds very much like day dream. In fact you are forgetting Cahil and Pedro
@ROI05841958 @ManCityMEN OYO
https://t.co/IBUv6PrWHS
@xo_leem Let me announce it for you, Sarri and Jorginho have joined Chelseafc in a package worth 	¬£57.3m https://t.co/6hS817PQdt
@BreatheChels Is like Sarri like passing game from the back
@SCOANTBJoshua Amen,  in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
@liaqatwaja @Chelsea_HQ @MirrorFootball Chelseafc gave him Championships league and FA cup trophies, will also give Sarri...It doesn't matter who is Chelseafc's manager
@liaqatwaja @Chelsea_HQ @MirrorFootball When Di Mateo took us to glory
@Chelseaista_cfc Football playing managers
@LukeRobinson_86 @talkSPORT When you remember that Di Mateo got them somewhere you will withdraw your statement; Chrlseafc tend to win something with any manager.
@Levi4dCulture You shouldn't bother, it's Chelseafc route to success.Even if they sack Sarri tomorrow, he won't go empty handed; he will go with üèÜ unlike Spurs
@TimNicholsDM Route to the clubs success.Atleast, it's no more news to managers; if you are coming to Chelseafc you should be prepared for sack. CFC is never Spurs

@mediocentroEN Meaning that they lost their brain when they paid upwards of ¬£50m on Walker(a defender)?
@ClassyJorginho Liverpoolfc and Man United you mentioned, were they not spending on players when they 'r real force in football? They're still spending but nothing to show for it.

@BIueLaporte Obviously you 've lost the plot, nothing more for you to say, I can understand...

@GaryLineker Stop being mischievous; how do you mean, you didn't see that coming?
@EcstaticSane Go and check world clubs rankings for many years and see Man city positions compared with that of Chelseafc
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ Mind you, City stadium was very empty in some of champions league matches, making people to believe that city is never a football ground
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ You don't do analysis blindly as if you are blind; CFC stadium always full to its capacity in every match day. City stadium is bigger that's why.
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ When will Man city come close of becoming 3rd best club in the world in their history; obviously there is no comparison between CFC &amp; Man city
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ Higher than chelseafc in what way and year? Chelseafc that was saving England's face for many years in Europe.
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ When somebody is tired of fighting, he/she will resort to pouring sand; speak football
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ Your sugar daddy can never make you smell Championships league trophy no matter how much he spends bc city is never a home of football
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ Liverpool will always be a big club so as Chelseafc, whether they win or not unlike city of yesterday.
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ Do Man city even have supporters? People wear city shirt just for cloth.
@shamilrasheed8 @NizaarKinsella Then you need to listen to Napoli president who said Jorginho would be going to Chelseafc with or without Sari
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ You also forgetting that no matter what you achieved last season many players still know the truth that Man city is still a small club
@EcstaticSane @Hazardizta__ You are forgetting easily that Man city/Pep bought premier league last season by spending hell of oil money recklessly on players including defenders
@grandhustle0 @MckCarlo @Mahrez22 Are you really sure? As in sure!
@SamKirklees that's why I am questioning their manager what he was thinking when he refused to play Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
@Dice_K_Snr Mind you, Jose Mourinho started before Zidane but the later has created a history with Real Madrid in UEFA Champions League. CFC even gave Di Mateo CL üèÜ...So, chill
@Vintage_Utd Pep Guardiola or not him,  real players still see Man City as an inferior club to many; they can only attract players by spending like Chinese clubs
https://t.co/F9CsXtIEA2
https://t.co/wO3PgavWsM
@NizaarKinsella This is what I had refused to agree from the day I heard it; the report of  unlocking Sarri agreement with Jorginho doesn't point at any truth from day 1
@FabrizioRomano You missed the line that says he prefers to live in London to living in Manchester...Who doesn't like capital life???
@AlexGoldberg_ You know, players with Brazilian blood mostly love to play for Chelseafc
Hypothetically, in Jorginho Chelseafc have found a perfect partner for N'Golo Kante.
@AntonDann The thing there is that, immediately Chelseafc called Jorginho answered because Man city was an inferior club to Chelseafc no matter what they achieved last season
Chelseafc are practically fooling speculative football journalists
