@dbongino Say goodbye to the medical industry.  The divide will become even worse. Private pay executive medicine. Or month long waits to get into primary care doctors. Specialists and making decisions for specialized care will be a thing of the past.
@dcexaminer Terrified, no! Shocked! How did someone so ignorant get elected. Her sex, race, and party have nothing to do with any of it. Her ignorant statements, misleading facts, and refusal to know what she is talking about before she opens her mouth; is insulting to the office she holds.
@IngrahamAngle Many Drs are going to executive medicine. Private pay. More service, less patients, better medicine. Bigger division of the classes. Thanks to insurance. They keep driving the costs up! Deregulated across state lines will cause natural competition with supply and demand.
