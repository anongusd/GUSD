5) Follow up and move on! Don‚Äôt give up, handle rejection well. #Advocacy19
4) Sell your op-ed with a great pitch. Never more than 4 paragraphs. Less than 100 words ideal actually. #Advocacy19
The REAL #3 tip, 3) Develop a smart pitching strategy, dictated by your audience. For the #Advocacy19 audience that could mean picking the newspaper of note for your targeted Member of Congress.
These tips are going to be more than 5. Presenters tricked this Tweeter with their slide deck.
4) What‚Äôs your lede? It matters. Don‚Äôt waste a good headline on a bad lede. Work hard on your first paragraph!
3) Headlines matter. Be provocative, witty. It‚Äôs like the icing on your op-ed cake. Headlines gets to read it, not say what‚Äôs in it. You have to convince the editor before you persuade thought leaders, decision-makers.
2) Format properly. Add paragraph breaks. One sentence and then a break is totally fine! Make it easy on the eyes. Otherwise it‚Äôs going in the trash.
The five secrets of writing and placing an op-ed at #Advocacy19. 1) Make sure you have a perspective or topic for op-ed. (Strong thesis, evidence, will it make sense to your target audience?
