Just getting up in the morning is a huge deal. Everyday is a new struggle. Really don’t care about anything, don’t go anywhere, don’t do anything. I totally understand anxiety and depression. It’s horrible. https://t.co/VHgRfidYnA
@askjillian Letting people get a first hand look at what you are going through is a testament to your strength, your very real human emotions and your determination to live. You are not alone. I know I don’t know you personally, but you can vent to me anytime!  Praying for you...
Get her OUT now!! https://t.co/MlyIj29ePS

She didn’t die during the journey, she was “killed” in the custody of the supposedly greatest country in the world!!  Never thought I would ever say this but I will be kneeling from now on till there are mass changes in this country. https://t.co/qYuoCVTdMx

Priceless! https://t.co/cdq6dCTJYd
@NYCASR @NYCACC @ASPCA Yes I did, terrible!!!
@NYCASR @NYCACC @ASPCA I asked that a couple days ago, it was re-tweeted several times ending up going to NY AG. No answer yet. It’s all about $$. They get paid to fix them so they do that first and then kill them, usually within 24 hours or less. Totally F-cked up!!
No ties to Russia?? https://t.co/b6wtMVY5nW
Busted!! https://t.co/b9SlQXFMIR
@JamesPMorrison Fuck’in A!!
@goconstance We don’t give kids enough credit, a lot of them know what’s going on today. Good job mom!
@JessicaGottlieb @Ocasio2018 I wish she was ours!!

The only thing that makes sense is they DO get paid to fix them, so they do it for the money and then kill them for more money. This is really.           F-cked up!!
@NYCASR Can you please tell me why they “fix” them and then kill them?
@nypost God almighty, what the hell is wrong with people?
@SaraCivian Cannot stand that show, so stupid!!
@End_TheFederalR This is ridiculous!  It’s a fucking Christmas 🎄 with trash a a decoration, NOTHING ELSE!
Giving anything but the boot to that racist is ridiculous. https://t.co/UnOnfPnPp8
@Lhultin @reallisa Back in the late 70’s and into the 80’s it was known as the “powerless play”, maybe time to bring it back?

@Change @FereJohn $750K?  I guess that is this company’s estimation of a persons life?  How many people in the US could afford this?  Ridiculous!!  @Ocasio2018
@reallisa This is terrible, we can’t win when Pia sings either!!
@Mommyof3lovesTV @PiaToscano Her voice is incredible!  Do you watch her on Netflix?
@PR_NHL @NHLJets Check out Mike Bossey, the guy was unreal!!

@MinaANDMaya @shaunwalters041 That’s awesome 😎
Hey America, if I was an employee that lied, cheated, wasn’t in my office almost half the time, didn’t protect the business and the employees, ect.....  I would be terminated. Mr. Trump works for US, the people of the United States of America 🇺🇸 Let’s end this embarrassing mess
@Ocasio2018 You are awesome 😎
@CampfireDavis @Ocasio2018 @NaureenAkhter How do I find out when she broadcasts?  I WANT to watch. I follow her on all media’s.
@ananavarro Perfect comment!!

@StLouisBlues @NHLNetwork Losing to the Kings right now is deadly serious.
@PingKNX @KNX1070 I think my Steelers will have something to say about that!
@Muddy_Flower @Elrodh3 @Ocasio2018 @realDonaldTrump I would like to see every politician’s first attempt without prior experience, I think we would all be surprised 😮
@MLB If either of them make it, I will never watch another MLB game!
@Elrodh3 @Ocasio2018 You know what she meant, I know what she meant. Every word she speaks is being analyzed and used against her. She is young, there will be some mistakes until she gets situated. It’s funny, they are all attacking her and why?  Because they are SCARED 😱 to death of her
@jaydestro @Ocasio2018 You are so right!  They are scared to death of her and I am loving it!!!
@PiaToscano You look amazing 😉 knock’em dead!!!
@Alyssa_Milano You tell him girl!  By the way, I love your show!!
@presMedina @PiaToscano She replied to me once too!  Great feeling, love ❤️ her on the show and at Staples Center!!
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt Why doesn’t everyone leave the woman alone!  It’s her business, no one else’s.
@EyeAmRobert @Westside @PiaToscano Dud, I think you killed off too many brain cells. Pia Toscano crushes it every time!!

@ProFootballTalk Best scenario is win Super Bowl this year and let the bitch go next year! The hell with him!!
@PiaToscano @HANNAHLUXDAVIS Why aren’t you at Staples singing tonight?  We ❤️ you and NEED your magic!!!
@LAKings Listen up Kings, get Joel Quenneville now, don’t hesitate.
@ocregister Listen up Kings, don’t hesitate, get Joel Quinville immediately!!
Pia Toscano is awesome. She sings, Kings win; paying attention Dodgers??
@davejosephla @PiaToscano @STAPLESCenter Pia sings and guess what?  3-1 Kings, what does that tell you??
@askjillian I will be praying for you Jillian 💐
@Alyssa_Milano And we love you!  Go Blue.
@Dodgers @TommyLasorda Get’em going Tommy!!
