Okay, the twitter account I just called out appears to be a bot. I have since deleted that tweet. However, his response to me is *not atypical* from what's appearing in my mentions from real accounts who support @BernieSanders
@k1udge @ZiaHakimi2 @BernieSanders @NRA Really? What else am I pouncing on him for?
@koush @TheRealJenBlue Really don't get why you assume that I have some ulterior motive... 		1. he does not mention guns in that video -- that is true. 		2. he had a VERY DIFFERENT position on guns at the beginning of his career, which lined up w/ NRA -- that is also true.
I criticized @BernieSanders for failing to mention guns in the short campaign video he released. 		Some of his @twitter supporters concluded that I was part of a "centrist" conspiracy against him...completely ignoring the fact that I'm trying to push him to the left on guns...
@koush Well, we will have to agree to disagree then. Thanks for the convo.
@curtstead91 @ZiaHakimi2 @BernieSanders @NRA I’m glad you agree with me on the boldness. It’s not a smear to say that for many years of his career he did not have a progressive position on this. And that’s okay — we should give candidates room to evolve in the right direction.  It shows growth.
@curtstead91 @ZiaHakimi2 @BernieSanders @NRA 2). Yes, Bernie has evolved on the issue. He hasn’t always been on the right side of it. I’m asking him to go further and lay out a bit and bold goal for building a future with fewer guns.
@koush I just answered your question directly in the other thread, @koush
@curtstead91 @ZiaHakimi2 @BernieSanders @NRA 1). I only saw the shorter video at the time of the tweet. I’m glad he mentions incremental reforms in the longer video, but I want him to go further and lay out a bold goal to build a future with fewer guns.
@koush There is really no conspiracy. I happened to see the video and I responded. I’m sure I’ve done similar with others.... I mean I called them out in a major paper on the Parkland anniversary. Not sure what you’re trying to imply...
@Doobsac @BernieSanders If your argument is — singling out Bernie in a tweet is 1000x worse than writing an op-we in a major paper — then I guess you can believe that. I disagree with the premise.
@koush I’m arguing he needs to go further on this issue, @koush
@curtstead91 @ZiaHakimi2 @BernieSanders @NRA And I’ve responded every single time. 		1. The video does not mention guns (yes, the longer one does)		2. For many years he had a very poor record on guns. 		Those are just facts...
@Doobsac @BernieSanders How am I being disingenuous? I’m calling Bernie to do something I’ve asked the others to do as well.

It's good to see *some* mention of guns in @BernieSanders' 2020 agenda. 		But b-checks &amp; assault weapons ban is the kind of *incremental reform* that Bernie typically rails against. 		Where is Bernie's big idea for building a future w/ fewer guns &amp; safer communities? https://t.co/4eqbAIz2tg
Frankly, it's infuriating to see reducing gun deaths not even get a mention in @BernieSanders' 2020 video. 		He's allowed @NRA to define his position for years, but if he wants to run as a progressive, he has to move to where most Americans are: building a future with fewer guns.

Believe it or not, the gun industry is purposely designing more lethal, militarized weapons to excite an already saturated customer base as gun ownership rates are shrinking and the gun supply is increasingly concentrated in the hands of fewer people. 3/

@HouseJudiciary @RepDougCollins Gun registration - requiring individuals to record their ownership of a firearm with a designated law enforcement agency- would: 		-help law enforcement to identify &amp; prosecute criminals and ppl in illegal possession		-discourages illegal sales		-protects law enforcement officers

5. Congress absolutely must ensure that all products produced by the gun industry meet safety standards set by the experts at the Consumer Product Safety Commission.		There's a bill to do just that: https://t.co/K09jpua2fU
5. Gunmakers are exploiting new technology and finding new loopholes in existing law in order to sell more-lethal weapons, weapons that Congress intended to stringently regulate and tax.
4. Since these pistols fire rifle calibers, their rounds travel three times faster than pistol rounds, penetrate common police body armor, and create devastating wounds. In Chicago, the average weapon caliber used in everyday gun violence has been ↑, number of people dying  ↑
3. The industry is producing AR &amp; AK pistols, which are guns that mimic short barreled rifles, pistol stabilizing braces, which are being used to function as a shoulder stock, transforming the pistol into a short-barreled rifle, a weapon currently restricted under federal law.
2. Believe it or not: no federal agencies oversees or reviews the products gun manufacturers produce. 		As a result, they've been making deadlier weapons for decades -- people are now dying from wounds they could have survived years ago.

3. Background checks are impactful when they *serve as the foundation* for a gun licensing system that requires individuals to jump through more hoops in order to obtain firearms.
2. But the latest research shows that instant background checks on their own *do not* have population-level impact on *gun crimes* or *gun suicides*: https://t.co/ja75N9LuvP

@katiecouric Hi Katie, my name is Igor Volsky and I run an organization called @gunsdownamerica. We're taking a much bolder approach to reducing gun violence (going after the guns themselves) and I'd love to tell you more about that, if your'e interested. Thanks!
.@NRA is upset b/c doctors see first hand the damage the gun industry's new deadly products are causing. 		Gunshot wounds are deadlier than ever as guns get increasingly powerful.		This is why we must do more to regulate the industry. https://t.co/zgUvb7BSON

Here's how I would answer "if they take any, they will take them all":		Machine guns have been very tightly regulated since 1934. 		In 2018, we have 393,000,000 firearms in civilian hands. https://t.co/ccVBnNc53a
The "gun laws don't prevent every single criminal from committing crime, thus they don't work" argument is really a big insult to everyone's intelligence, tbh.
.@NRA arguing #ThousandOaksShooting proves CA's gun laws don't work. 		They're wrong: 		- CA toughened gun laws in 90s. Gun violence ↓ 56%		- CA has one of lowest gun death rates		- CA laws could've prevented killer from getting more/deadlier gun		- No law will prevent all crime
"The dominance of the semiautomatic pistol greatly increased the firepower in civilian hands. Not only are semiautomatic pistols capable of rapid fire, they utilize high‐capacity ammunition magazines and can be quickly reloaded." 		INDUSTRY IS PURPOSELY MAKING DEADLIER FIREARMS
What's key to understand here is that the mostly unregulated gun industry began to manufacture *much deadlier* firearms to increase profits. 		In the 1980s, it began marketing  high‐capacity semiautomatic pistols. https://t.co/iJR7Wb2xYB https://t.co/h0hDjBjn3X
The shooter in #ThousandOaks used a Glock. It's a popular weapon for mass killers, used in: 		2016 Kalamazoo 6 dead 	2015 Charleston 9 dead	2013 Hialeah 6	2012 Oak Creek 7	2011 Tucson 6	2007 Blacksburg 33	1999 Honolulu 7	1998 Springfield 4	1998 Newington 5	1991 Killeen 24

8. Instead of working to make GUNS HARDER TO GET this administration is considering PUMPING MORE GUNS INTO OUR CLASSROOMS -- significantly increasing the danger to our students and to our teachers.
7. Even with proper training, you cannot expect a teacher to shoot down the attacker without injuring or putting innocent students in harm's way. You are in an adrenaline-filled situation without any clear sense of where shots are coming from, who the "bad guy" is.
6. To make matters worse, for many mass shooters, armed teachers are no deterrent, they’re part of the fantasy. For many, provoking a lethal response IS PART OF THE PLAN. https://t.co/37aEWv8G1w
5. Look at active shooting scenarios. An FBI study of 160 active shooting incidents between 2000 and 2013 found:		21 active shooters were stopped by UNARMED civilians  		1 was stopped by someone carrying a firearm.	https://t.co/2Ihr00tbjz
4. There are no two sides to this story. The research overwhelmingly shows that more guns in more places translates into higher rates of gun violence. Arming teachers in classrooms is absolutely deadly. https://t.co/HbNcHh2n5a
3. There is NO EVIDENCE that presence of armed person can defuse an active shooter. In bank robberies, presence of armed guards actually ↑ likelihood of injury. 		In robberies w/ no guards violent events in 4% of cases		W/guards, rate tripled to 12.8%. https://t.co/eKFUrhrNFT
2. Teachers are not law enforcement officials. They are not trained on an ongoing basis in how to defuse active shooter incidents. We should let teachers do their jobs -- educate our students -- and not weigh them down with an impossible new responsibility.
1. I know arming teachers polls well, but it is an incredibly dangerous policy that will put our children at risk. This is literally a plan that will kill more kids at school.

@MatthewinBklyn @Cybren @NRA I think a lot of this will depend on implementation and ensuring that the system is easy and efficient. 		In terms of legal gun ownership reducing crime, the research pretty overwhelmingly shows that higher rates of gun ownership/more guns = more gun deaths.
@MatthewinBklyn @Cybren @NRA I think the fear of government over-reach is a real one and we should put measures in place to control for that and to provide people who are discriminated against by govt an avenue for recourse.
@MatthewinBklyn @Cybren @NRA I don't want to take people's ability to defend themselves. 		I want responsible people who choose to own guns, to own guns. BUT -- they have to demonstrate that they are responsible by obtaining a license (w/ training requirement) and registering their firearms.

@MatthewinBklyn @Cybren @NRA It's the business of the government to protect the lives and security of its citizens. Right now, 33,000 people die from guns in America every year. I'm arguing we need to make guns harder to get to bring that number down.
@MatthewinBklyn @Cybren @NRA The problem is: you are FAR more likely to use that gun against yourself or somebody else (than you are to use it in an actual self defense situation). That's why in areas where you have stricter gun laws, you have fewer gun deaths.
@RobProvince @bruminger Igor: I actually had to flee communism, I don't want to confiscate all the guns, and I think we should be thoughtful in how we penalize gun owners so we don't over-criminalize entire communities.
@manwith6bands Thanks for your thoughtful reply!
@kleachdesign @NRA I hear that Kara, but NRA will say Dems want to kill #2A if they advocate safe storage laws, so we should not make policy based on what they'll say. 		We should set-out bold, clear, long-term goals and build political support for passing them.
@praisethepepe @NRA We just passed a $2.3 TRILLION tax cut for rich people, I think we can invest some dollars to help save tens of thousands of lives. I'm all for enforcement of existing laws AND passing bold new ones that will actually help solve the problem.
@Cybren @NRA I'm not saying she should run on a platform of federal gun licensing; i'm saying that these are the kind of bold ideas that politicians need to start advocating for. 		So, she would push for licensing in GA, for instance.
@imawhig @NRA 1. Yes, you can require a license to exercise a fundamental right. You need one to hold a protest, while exercising your 1A right. 2. Why would'n you want to use money to create safer communities. 3. No thanks, all good on bridges here.
@brianjacksonXP @NRA I remember people told me I could never get married because I'm gay, Brian.
@NRA 5. What I mean is, we can do: 		federal gun licensing	federal gun registration 	federally funded voluntary gun buyback	tough regulations of gun industry		This is the kind of bold action we need to build a world w/ fewer guns and fewer homicides, suicides, &amp; accidental deaths.
4. And it feels to me that framing answers about gun control with "I believe in #2A" feeds into the @NRA frame of: you can't regulate guns, you can't make guns significantly harder to get b/c of #2a and that's just a perversion of jurisprudence around this issue
3. But the part of her answer I really don't like is here: “I want common sense gun regulation because I believe in the Second Amendment."		This suggests that #2A only allows for incremental, moderate reforms. SCOTUS has repeatedly found govt can take bold action
2. I really think that political candidates need to go bolder here: YES, I want to take guns away from people who are not responsible enough to use them, particularly of those guns are designed to kill a lot of people in a short period of time

Yes, it does seem like that at least at this point, you need a very expensive 3-D printer ($100k+) in order to print a functioning gun. But, as technology develops, that barrier is going to fall as well... https://t.co/VTAzp1sawI
And owning a gun or having one readily accessible increases the odds of suicide and homicide victimization. We need to get serious about building a future with fewer guns. https://t.co/PjnvaEYIei

🚨🚨🚨	Manufacturers of 3-D printers have a social responsibility to demand Congress outlaw untraceable homemade weapons &amp; to develop technologies that will prohibit users from printing guns on their printers. 		Urge them to act here: https://t.co/FwYDywfyiP
@adownie @DebraMessing Yea, you won't be able to eliminate 3D gun printing entirely, but the goal is to make it as difficult as possible for people to download &amp; print undetectable guns.
4. Go to this page to contact the top 3 manufacturers of 3-D printers and demand they do EVERYTHING THEY CAN to make sure their machines aren't used to print undetectable homemade guns: https://t.co/FwYDywfyiP https://t.co/7tFhisCYKi
3. But manufacturers of 3D must also play a role: they must make sure their devices are not used to print homemade guns. https://t.co/FwYDywfyiP
2. And it's great to see federal and state lawmakers taking action to stop these undetectable weapons. GOPers of course remain silent on the issue.
1. Happy to hear that a Washington State federal court temporarily blocking Defense Distributed from posting its downloadable gun blueprints online in the form of Computer Aided Design files for anyone to print on a 3-D printer

@CJSmith7880 @NRA I think the danger is that as this technology develops and becomes cheaper, there's a real danger. And these plans will probably hasten that
5. Lawmakers must overcome @NRA opposition &amp; strengthen Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. Mandate that detectable metal components be permanently affixed to firearms 		Federal &amp; state govts MUST stop manufacturing of these dangerous downloadable weapons		Our lives depend on it.
4. Trump's settlement is incredibly dangerous. 		People have ALREADY used homemade weapons to kill. In 2015, an individual used a homemade AR-15 to kill 5. Just last year, in Northern California another man killed 5 others with AR-15 rifles. Some of them were homemade as well.
3. This is all because Trump quietly settled a lawsuit &amp; now 3D printing tutorials are approved “for public release” and can have unlimited distribution in any form. 		Trump also agreed to pay nearly $40,000 in legal fees for the 3D gun manufacturer. WTF?!
2. Ppl will be able to log-on to a website, and, if they have a 3D print print out fully functional &amp; undetectable firearms. We could have guns in: 		airports	schools	federal buildings 	courthouses 	state &amp; national parks	etc...

@NRA 6. @NRA is an organization that operates **without shame or any concept of decency.** 		They're a perfect match for Trump and Putin's vision of America. And, they are now led by a man -- Oliver North -- who worked with shady foreign actors to advance his agenda in the 80s!
@NRA 5. When children were murdered in Newtown, CT, @NRA organized members of congress to advocate for more guns in schools. When teenage gun violence survivors in Parkland, FL challenged the stranglehold @NRA has on Congress, they were portrayed by gun lobby's allies as crisis actors
@NRA 4. @NRA has a LOOOOONG history of doing *whatever it takes* to advance its gun agenda -- so it's no surprise they would stoop this low &amp; work w/ Russia. Here are just a few examples
@NRA 3. Butina helped @NRA raise money from Russian oligarchs like Torshin who were working w/ Putin to undermine our democracy. @NRA took some Russian $ &amp; spent $30M+ electing Trump, b/c they care more about selling guns than they do about American institutions or American lives.
@NRA 2. I suspect that given its history &amp; the way it has operated, @NRA knew Butina's group "Right To Bear Arms" was a front -PUTIN OPPOSES GUN RIGHTS!- &amp; schemed w/ Butina and her mentor, Putin crony Torshin, organizing trips to Russia for MOCs setting up meetings w/ top GOP leaders
1. DOJ says Russian operative Maria Butina infiltrated @NRA to advance Russian priorities &amp; help Trump		Butina met w/ @NRA officials &amp; they even traveled to Moscow! 		But @NRA isn't a victim of political black ops - they're undisputed heavyweight champion of black ops. Here's why
THE AMERICANS or TRUMP'S AMERICA would make for an excellent board game, tbh https://t.co/nkeUX85nNW

.@NRA has changed its story about connections to @Russia. 		1. @NRA refused to respond to congressional inquiries about financial ties to Russia		2. @NRA admitted to accepting $1,000 from a Russian donor 		3. @NRA admitted to accepting money from at least twenty Russian donors

@nytimes @NRA 6. I'm fighting for a future with fewer guns. #2A, as it's been interpreted, isn't incompatible w/ policies that reduce number of guns. Should that interpretation change, we must have a national convo about what hurdles we need to overcome to build safer communities.
@nytimes @NRA 5. Most courts upheld strict gun laws even after SCOTUS found indiv right to have gun. Scalia wrote: "right secured by the second amendment is not unlimited. ... the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."
@nytimes @NRA 4. Idea that #2a is designed to protect individual's right to own firearms was fabricated by @NRA &amp; it invested millions into legal research &amp; propaganda campaign to convince ppl that they had a right to carry around weapons of war. Their goal: open new markets for gun makers.
@nytimes 3. Even @NRA president Karl T. Fredrick  said in 1934, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.” 		Asked if restrictions interfere w/ #2A, NRA president said: "“I have not given it any study"
@nytimes 2. Our founders *never thought* #2Amendment was incompatible w/ laws that strictly regulate guns. In fact: 		Just 4 of 13 states protected "right to bare arms" 		Major cities -- NYC, Boston -- prohibited firing of guns within city limits 		Founders viewed it in context of militia
1. Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens calls for repeal of the Second Amendment in today's @NYTimes. https://t.co/pQaJQgcFvM		I think this is a public conversation we *should* have, but I'm not convinced we need to repeal #2A to move toward a world w/ fewer guns

When Australia was implementing it's gun buy back program, politicians sold it by arguing: we don't want to be like the U.S. when it comes to guns.

Average civilians are just not equipped to handle the chaos of an active shooter situation -- no matter how skilled they think they are: https://t.co/OVqvavg0jX 3/
We've seen study after study showing that armed civilians don't have the training to stop active shootings. 		From 2000 to 2013:		21 active shooters stopped by unarmed civilians		1 stopped by armed civilian 2/
I'm going to do a quick thread about this idiotic idea of arming teachers in the classroom. It's an effort to distract from the real problem -- we have too many guns &amp; they're too easy to get -- and will only put schools at *greater risk* 1/
There are a lot of “sick” people — to use Trump’s language — who want to harm others. But only in the United States do they have such easy access to firearms that lead to such disastrous and tragic outcomes. 		We must move toward a world with fewer guns where firearms.
To be clear: all the research on this shows that armed civilians are not successful in stopping an active shooter situation. Amid the chaos, they often do more harm than good. https://t.co/vnrZNE0WjP
