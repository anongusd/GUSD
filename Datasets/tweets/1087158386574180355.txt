@BellerGreg @KamalaHarris Billionaire Corps are taking over. Pay nothing in taxes and pay employees wages they can't live on. 65% of Wal-Mart employees are on welfare. Low wages creates a negative domino effect on community's. Wealthy need to pay taxes and a livable wage. Nobody wants a hand out.
@gabiporter @KamalaHarris I agree with you. I personally have never used Section 8 or HUD housing but I know how it doesn't work. Now let's add another type of government housing? Rental prices need to come down in most cities so let the government control landlords and price gouging not citizens.
