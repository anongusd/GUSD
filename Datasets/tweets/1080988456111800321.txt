@Espngreeny Besides when the @Colts shut them down. 23-0
@denocobb @insidethehall His on ball D is terrible (off ball decent but not good) He hasn‚Äôt even made it to the free throw line in 9 games -  decision making has been freshmen like .   Zero blocks all year.  SOS is 3.79.

@denocobb @insidethehall You think ? He‚Äôs averaging 1 point , 1 assist 2 rebounds and has 0 blocks this year.  His defense has become a liability which is why Archie can‚Äôt play him more than a few minutes
