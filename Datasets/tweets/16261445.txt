@Edwardthejust @smerconish @CNNPolitics It depends on who is speaking, but I would hesitate to malign anyone who wishes good things for victims of tragedy
@wolfmanjaks I will defer to logistical experts, and also say that no one can plan for every contingency.

Logistical planning is important but not determinative.Battle plans change after the 1st shot is fired. Response2 the unexpected is key2 PR

"Sometimes [Bernie Sanders is] naive about the Democratic party," says @CenkUygur, "They're going to do what they always do."

@ironmanShub "When Deadly Force is Involved" Bruce M. Lawlor
Currently, police have to argue self defense. "That's probably not the right standard," says Lawlor, "they have a duty to go forward."
If you "bring about.. the confrontation that leads to somebody's death..you'll be denied self-defense" says Bruce Lawlor on legality.
"That's the thing about self defense. It's complex &amp; it's simple at the same time." Bruce Lawlor explores the complexity in his new book.

@TwalshTim Interesting to hear the Democratic VP have to shut it down. Then they got a phote op with him afterwards 📸

@tadmcd or all I need.
@ClaireeMonroe @speechboy71 So why did that not remove @POTUS in '12? Or Dem Senate until '14?
@ASFried ok rephrase: D control in '08 now R control in 16. Why?
@jenheger @POTUS 8 years ago or now?
@speechboy71 And now...?
@tadmcd @POTUS https://t.co/CEmJ6GDgP1
@DavidMDrucker Maybe if they have time for a 4th question
I am remembering that when he started @POTUS presided over a Dem Congress. As he leaves, R's take over Congress &amp; White House. Why is that?
We're still on first question in the @POTUS press conference, btw
@seanindc just summarizing. I do think it's not so simple as that.
Not to mention all the reports about @realDonaldTrump hatespeech. There was plenty of coverage of all these issues
@POTUS I think misstates "dominance" of email...if we are to believe all the reports of @realDonaldTrump getting way too much free airtime
Basic message from @POTUS: I handled Russian hacks beautifully. Media blew it.
@d_twit @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Exactly.
@d_twit @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Then chaos. My point: absent evidence, embrace the legitimacy of Nov 8. It's bigger than Trump/Obama/Clinton
@ChasinItAll @POTUS I think he needs to be forthright in ending doubts and challenges.
See @JaredRizzi to the right in his assigned seat. #gameofthrones https://t.co/ubeLEHtzDm
I would like to hear @POTUS go on the record today: is @realDonaldTrump  the legitimate Pres-elect, and should the inauguration go forward?
