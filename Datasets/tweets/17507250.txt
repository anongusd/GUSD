@JGolden5 @TSA These are the regulations. Nowhere does it say to put it bottles or anything like that. I suggested they test one bag, like these rules state, and they said no. https://t.co/fG3vRKgkhk
@bigbatyankees @TSA I know the rules. They clearly don‚Äôt. They literally were making rules up as I held up the website with the TSA regulations to show them.
@JesseDStringer Oh I made sure all the other people in line could see how they harassed me.
@JGolden5 @TSA I read the TSA site. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about bottles or testing each one. Or the quantity.
@AElderbaum Just brutal.  The rules are that you tell them you have breast milk. There‚Äôs no limit on how much. They visually inspect it. Then they can test it with a special strip if they want to. But there‚Äôs absolutely no reason to open a bag of it.
@sreden @PHXSkyHarbor Of course! One would think they‚Äôd learn! Just terrible, Phoenix. Be better
I‚Äôm not a big Twitter ranter, but whoever‚Äôs is running the show at @PHXSkyHarbor needs to be taught how to handle nursing moms. Just so disrespectful and ridiculous. Again... this is not how it should ever be done https://t.co/WzoXHq2RX4
I‚Äôve done several trips for work already and know the regulations. No airport has ever done this. Nor are they ever supposed to ask you to open a packed milk bag. Just for good measure, of course the red head guy left everything unpacked so I had to repack everything
So this is how NOT to treat nursing mothers @TSA. These clueless dudes at the PHOENIX airport just took out every single bag of the breast milk I had, tried to open it and when I refused (because that‚Äôs unsanitary) made me do a full pat down and search. https://t.co/EMbJYABnCj

Link to the latest on the Lakers &amp; Sixers weird game of telephone https://t.co/tbclTmsRKZ
To further fill in. Ben Simmons‚Äô brother brought the idea of talking to Magic up with a lower level Sixers employee‚Äîwho then emailed the Lakers, per league sources. It‚Äôs unclear if that lower level employee told Elton Brand he was reaching out to LA. https://t.co/HSXYeeWI3Z
@jameslevy21 On radio he left out the backstory and it appeared that the Lakers randomly reached out to ask permission
In other words, Ben Simmons had an idea about talking with Magic, his camp (not Rich Paul) talked to someone with the Sixers (not Elton Brand), who then asked the Lakers, who then went back and asked Brand, who said no. Got it? üòä
In interview with @975TheFanatic Brand said, ‚ÄúRob Pelinka called me and said that Ben wanted to talk to Hall of Famers after the season, Magic was on the list. He asked for authorization... I said no.‚Äù He did not mention Sixers had contacted Pelinka first, which prompted the call
Elton Brand called Magic Johnson Monday afternoon to apologize for insinuating that the Lakers had called ‚Äîunprompted‚Äî to ask permission for Johnson to speak with Sixers forward Ben Simmons in a radio interview Monday morning, league sources told ESPN.

The Warriors players-only meeting with former president Barack Obama‚Äôs was arranged by Stephen Curry, according to a team official. But it was meant to stay private, rather become a political statement.
Unlike last year, nothing about the Warriors trip to DC was political this year. There wasn‚Äôt even a discussion, let alone an invite or dis-invitation to the White House.

Man, the Sixers are something. After the rebound-kerfuffle with Embiid and Simmons tonight, they walked out of Staples together-ish / at the same time. Ben w/ Kendall Jenner &amp; friends. Joel w/ corner Sixer TLC (who is in town  w/ OKC)
Joel Embiid on Patrick Beverley. ‚ÄúI love that guy. He‚Äôs like Westbrook. Plays hard. That‚Äôs how the game should be.‚Äù
Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley both get technicals and are ejected from the game. A little heavy, but probably wise considering how this game is going.
For those keeping track at home. We‚Äôve had one basketball game &amp; three scuffles on the card here at Staples Center tonight: Joel vs Ben; Joel vs Beverly and now Jimmy vs Avery

@MileHighRobert I just like the bad blood in baseball!
@MileHighRobert I can see both sides of the argument. Rox caught a break today when Scherzer decided not to pitch. But they also won 8 in a row to put themselves in great position.
@Ozz_Mejia Dodgers didn‚Äôt blow it. Rockies won 8 in a row! If Colorado wins the NL West, it‚Äôll be well deserved.
@MaureenEF Oh trust me, they were thinking about the Nats this morning. Lots of angry folks
@MaureenEF More like risk injury. I think it‚Äôs really just baseball etiquette that makes it bad form. Very different in baseball than hoops tho
@patrick_hruby But as an example of weird karma. Lakers two years ago won a bunch of games late when they should be tanking. Had 4th worst record but jumped up to 2 in lottery ahead of the Suns (who were outlandishly tanking)
@patrick_hruby The Suns didn‚Äôt even bother pretending the last few years... Chicago even notified the league in an attempt to tank in an honorable way üòÇ
@NiguelLovett Yeah, but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going on here.
@MLRosenfeld It‚Äôs actually great for my fantasy team :)
Dodgers are gonna say all the right things, but privately they are none too pleased with the Nats and the decision not to pitch Scherzer. I even had Dodger people praising the Giants and MadBum for playing this last series out hard.
My experience is that teams who get too cute with tanking or resting players generally get some weird karmic retribution. But what does that mean in baseball with its unwritten rules?
Cards &amp; Giants out of it but sending out real lineups because Cubs &amp; Dodgers have huge playoff implications. Nats &amp; Scherzer don‚Äôt bother despite Rox playoff situation. Brewers are playing Detroit? I‚Äôm used to NBA teams blatantly tanking/resting players the last 6 weeks üôÑ

Would be nice if some of Serena‚Äôs male counterparts had her back and admitted they‚Äôve said a lot worse to the umpire. I know I‚Äôve heard A LOT worse from NBA players directed at refs.
Anyone saying Serena was out of control with the ump has no concept of how passionate and competitive sports can be at this level. She‚Äôs out there playing her guts out, not going for an afternoon tea.
Serena was outplayed until the umpire ruined the match in second set. She was starting to get her game together and just might‚Äôve if the awful decisions and treatment of the chair hadn‚Äôt knocked her out of focus. It‚Äôs really a shame Serena didn‚Äôt have a chance to fight.
You know the phrase, ‚ÄúIt takes everything?‚Äù That‚Äôs become Serena‚Äôs final hurdle to clear in major finals as she tries to make history.  She‚Äôs gonna have to overcome her own emotions, fears, mental blocks as well as tennis‚Äôs. One day she will.

@MarkSP18 Right, because he agreed to take $7.5 buyout
@yurciaga No incentive for Deng to do a buyout next year as he‚Äôd know Lakers needed to waive&amp;stretch to get to the max. This way he gets chance to play now. Lakers really only lose opportunity to trade him, which was unlikely anyway
Here‚Äôs easiest way to understand the Deng buyout.  Lakers stretch 5,5,5 instead of 6,6,6.  By doing this now Deng can play elsewhere sooner &amp; try to recoup the $7.5 m. Lakers lose opportunity to trade him, but that was problematic because they‚Äôd have to attach an asset.

@DougESPN Agreed.  Although in retrospect it hastened the decision to shakeup the front office

This was a very hush-hush operation. Lakers knew they needed to give Bron space to decide and announce it as he wanted. None of us reporters could even confirm they‚Äôd been in touch whereas calls with Cavs &amp; Sixers leaked. Says something on the discipline for all involved
The Lakers all planned to congregate at their facility last night for free agent calls. Magic was expected to be there. Instead he was at LeBron‚Äôs house‚Äî closing.
How did the Lakers close this? Magic Johnson went to one of LeBron‚Äôs houses in LA late Saturday night and met with him for several hours.

@JCLedge He‚Äôd have to send paperwork in if he was opting out.  In this situation, he could have simply let a deadline pass. Instead his agent gave the Cavs a full day‚Äô heads up.
What LeBron deciding to go through with free agency does is remove some of the pressure on his free agent suitors with cap space like LA &amp; Philly. Lakers in particular had been pushing to answer the Kawhi question before LBJ had to make this decision.
LeBron informing the Cavs early in the day he won‚Äôt pick up his option was both helpful to their planning even though it‚Äôs been expected.
To clarify for everyone again. LBJ did not opt-out. He didn‚Äôt have to. He could have let the deadline pass tonight without doing or saying anything and he‚Äôd be a FA. He had a player option to opt-in, which he declined to exercise.

@MattNypaver Not really. But teams invite players with family connections (peep the Warriors for example) all the time who maybe aren‚Äôt there basketball wise. That wasn‚Äôt gonna happen here.
For some perspective, it‚Äôs very common to add a few extra players to a Summer League roster. Just as it is to invite a ton of guys for draft workouts. This case is a bit different as @BillPlaschke noted after LiAngelo‚Äôs workout.
Lakers officially informed LiAngelo Ball he will not be on their Summer League team last night.  They were determined to make this a basketball decision but as one source put it, ‚Äúobviously there‚Äôs more to it than basketball.‚Äù In other words‚Äî the LaVar effect was real.

Iggy‚Äôs injury brings us back to the decision to cut @Casspi18 at the end of the season to make room for QCook. Warriors had to choose between cutting Omri, DJones or McCaw. The young guys are vital to the future with the big $ to the big 4. So Omri goes and so does depth on wing

Iguodala has gotten treatment on his leg bruise several times in the last 24 hours. Warriors will make a final call on whether he plays before the game. Will likely use a pad over his leg if he does play.

From what I understand, the bruise on Iguodala's knee is actually slightly below his kneecap.  One Warriors source I spoke to said there was optimism he'd be upgraded.  But obviously they didn't expect it to get worse overnight so best not to guess until X-rays come back.
Iguodala is going to get an XRay right now. If it comes back clean, he could be upgraded. If not...
Andre Iguodala's knee contusion got a little worse overnight so he didn't practice today. He's listed as doubtful for Game 4.
RT @anthonyVslater: Huge news: Andre Iguodala is doubtful for Game 4 with a knee soreness.
I actually voted for Steve Clifford this year because he's been as thoughtful and accommodating through good times and bad. Plus, Steve/Brad/Doc/Mike D can win every year.
There's this sense that it hurts teams for players to express themselves. Too many organizations try to control and stifle that, rather than trust their players to know how to handle. If it was so detrimental, would Dubs, Rockets, Celtics all be in Conf Finals?

Embiid went through warmups without this new special mask. He‚Äôs clearly into the theater of this. I can‚Äôt wait to see this gray/black translucent mask with protective eyewear built into it.  #Ironman #PhantomoftheProcess
The reasons this was such a ‚Äúprocess.‚Äù  It‚Äôs the second time Embiid has broken this area of his face. First time was at Kansas. All the doctors involved felt there was significant risk of reinjury. So there‚Äôs been a lot of work done in developing this new stronger mask.
The mask Embiid is wearing tonight has protective eyewear built into it! It‚Äôs carbon AND poly carbonate. Hence, it‚Äôs stronger than a normal mask. Let‚Äôs just say this has been a super involved hi-tech project between the Sixers, Embiid‚Äôs camp and the independent league doctors.
League has approved the mask. It's an upgraded version of what he wore on the court previously. Heard it's more translucent looking. https://t.co/7K8MahtIJ3

My understanding is that the mask Embiid is gonna wear is the one he and the Sixers requested. In other words he's comfortable with it.
Both from a healing and a protection standpoint (the mask!) he's been cleared, per sources. But needs to go through pregame warmups before they make the final call.
Embiid has indeed been upgraded to probable for tonight's Game 3. He's gonna go through Pregame warm ups beforehand to make sure he feels OK. Then, final call. But obviously looks good at this point.

Embiid also said he's lost a bit of weight since the collision with Markelle Fultz.  He's gone from "280-something to 275" which he thinks is related to not being able to lift as much.  Normally when he's missed time, Embiid gains weight.
Embiid was on the court shooting for about 30 minutes before Game 1. He wore a black protective mask which he prefers to white or clear masks because those "get foggy." But Embiid says the league hasn't approved the black mask yet so they're still exploring options.
Embiid said he's still gotta prove he can withstand contact in order to be cleared, but he's been ramping that up the last few days.
Joel Embiid said he thinks there's a "pretty good chance" he'll be able to play in Game 2 or 3.  "If it was my decision I would play, but I can‚Äôt get back out on the court if I don‚Äôt have the OK from them," Embiid said. "But everything has been going well."

Once Embiid can do more intense cardio, he can do the exertion test to clear concussion protocol. The healing of the facial fracture is hard to predict. I'm told there's "hope" he can get back for playoffs but expecting him for Game 1 isn't something to speculate on yet.
A little context on Joel Embiid's return from what should really be described as a broken face. He's gonna start riding a bike &amp; walking on a treadmill this weekend. You have to ramp up the exertion level of cardio slowly when coming back from these types of injuries. (Cont'd)

Ronda told me she's been training at the WWE performance center for several months. She'd travel down there on weekends while she was filming in Atlanta. In other words, she's close to fighting shape.
Ronda did not travel back from Colombia with any of her usual entourage so there was no chance of them being recognized anywhere. Her husband Travis Browne stayed home. Too big a risk of being recognized.

Things I never thought I'd see. James Harden has just two Free Throw attempts this game. He's got 22 points on 5 3-pointers. But clearly isn't driving to the basket tonight in just his second game back from injury.
This game has many implications for the Rockets and Warriors, but maybe even more so for the rest of the league. If Houston can take 2 of 3 vs the Warriors, this whole year feels a lot more wide open. If Golden State rallies from down 17 and pulls this out...quite demoralizing
Houston is flat out man handling the Warriors right now, forcing 7 turnovers, out rebounding Golden State 26-12 and leading 64-49. James Harden and Chris Paul have 29 of those points https://t.co/oatUb5gfK0
Today is the 50-year anniversary of the college hoops Game of the Century between UCLA and Houston. https://t.co/QSMqFYzuyQ https://t.co/Bj5ZErai6Y
Hot start for James Harden and the Rockets against Golden State. Houston up 14-7 as Harden has hit three straight 3s in just his second game back. https://t.co/6xqktmaB9q

After the Lakers were warned about tampering by the league following new team president Magic Johnson's cheeky comments on Jimmy Kimmel, Shaw reconsidered whether to participate in the fishing trip and in George's fishing competition, which was being held Aug 13 at Castaic Lake.
Sources told ESPN that Shaw and George frequently went on father-son fishing trips during the summer, trading off between lakes in Indiana and Shaw's home in Oakland.
