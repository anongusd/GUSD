@02catz @MarijuanaPolicy Unfortunately their ignorance is our problem.
@senatemajldr Get with it and legalize marijuana. I'm a Republican and want legal cannabis. Back the Marijuana Justice Act. We know you dont like the people who wrote it but that doesn't matter dont go against the people you serve out of spite. This one is an easy win-win.
@GovHolcomb @RepVisclosky @RepVanNatter @JimLucas0311 @INORML Saw FB comments huh..Ok how can I pacify these people. I know say I did it in college. I'm cool it's the Feds. Do you think that will work Eli? If it's such a bad gateway shouldn't you be a Dopehead now not a Governer? https://t.co/krr2loaOYW
@sluglard @larrysDryWall @CoryBooker The Feds could legalize and Holcomb would still stop the bill. Indiana is horrible about it marijuana laws. We need a big change.
@INHouseGOP @Brian_Bosma Legalize Marijuana
@JimLucas0311 @INORML @GovHolcomb @RepVanNatter @indgop @INDems @KarenTallian Exactly. HB 1283 would help solve the issue.
@DonnaBaileyBai1 @IndStatePolice Every addict deserves forced help but after you get them better what will the do with a criminal record?
https://t.co/M25zrXinFW @JimLucas0311 @inorml @GovHolcomb @RepVanNatter @indgop @INDems @KarenTallian Make CBD legal then arrest,collect fines,give criminal records and cost ppl jobs and lives. So 30g or less have the cops send you on your way if they can't tell the difference.
https://t.co/IFvGHYdm2x @WhiteHouse @GOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats. @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @NORML So what you waiting for. How hard is it to do just one thing for the people when the majority want it done. Do what your elected for... You know what the people want. Remember them.
@RepVanNatter @INORML @indgop Completely disrespectful that many will not listen to the people and do their will. It's always about the people until they get in then it's do as we say. Can't wait to vote them out.
@Levi81501601 @GovHolcomb @FLJanetHolcomb Agreed. As far as I'm concered you served the country more than them. They need to listen to people like you.

@GovHolcomb @CommerceGov @IvankaTrump What is your plan when Senate Bill 420 passes? It will remove Marijuana from the controlled substances. Then Indiana will legalize right?
Will it have a chance?

@realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @CBS Tell us about your plan to legalize marijuana.

@GOP Please like this. DNC are starting their presidential runs using legal marijuana. It will happen the people want it. Be champions of the people and legalize. Let them not work with you on their platform. You win people or they look like asses for fighting you and you win people.
Until my tongue be silenced in death I will continue	to fight for the rights of man." Abraham Lincoln.
A prohibitory law strikes a blow at the very principles on which our	Government was founded. I have always been found labor-	ing to protect the weaker classes from the stronger, and I	can never give my consent to such a law as you propose to	enact.
PROHIBITION will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a species of intemperance within	itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of reason, in that it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation and inmaking crimes out of things that are not crimes.
@SenCapito @SenateGOP Sorry off topic but really its time.
@SenCapito @SenateGOP Can we get marijuana legalized already.
