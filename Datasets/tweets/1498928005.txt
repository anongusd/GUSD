ETR is calling for this religious assets to receive a status but not under Serbian but under @MFA_Ukraine new Orthodox Church protection. No Russia no Serbia but Ukraine. 	Pec Patriarchate and Serb churches in Kosovo will receive an extraterritorial status in Kosovo.
On Energy _ 75% of the power grid will belong to Kosovo and 25% will belong to Serbia due to interconnection. Energy sector will be administered by the US, Austria and Germany. ETR is calling for @Zoran_Zaev to offer @MFA_MKD ELEM to manage this instead of faraway USA,G,A.
The idea of USA &amp; NATO taking JUG” military base in Cepotine &amp; joint management it very good. @NATO @JFC_Naples should be done anyhow.
If President Vucic so powerful to just give Presevo to RKS? Wow what whooping powers the President has in Serbian constitution! Really? The much better sentence is the special status - well there we are South Tyrol for both and yes this powers are possible in Serbia and RKS
The Trepca part is funny - 500 Billion reserves wow how believes in such numbers. What kind of investment is required? The profits are shared 15,35,50 %? What for the investor? Well it is a wishful thinking. And just to have Mitrovica a free city that China can invest? Fantasy!
On Free Cities will nice idea but Bolzano works and Danzig did not. it is much better to have the very same status and legal framework for both regions supervised by the same EU, UNO, NATO under the same rules. Free city Mitrovica but not Bujanovac? This wont work!
Some good ideas like the Chinese in Trepca, the US in Jug base, but all this can be done without land swapping. Please Southern Tyrol for North RKS and South Western Serbia on a mutual basis is 100% possible and fine. But again all only once Serbia join NATO as well so RKS secure
ETR calls on @HashimThaciRKS @Petrit @haradinajramush @pacollibehgjet is this the deal? Why should Serbia accept it? Anyhow please Serbia can only be trusted if in NATO as well. The real deal can only happen in joint NATO Accession. All this seems to be driven by Trepca fantasies

So to sum up Mr Chancellor. @sebastiankurz you are against @NATO against more defence spending. meet with Putin and do business with OMV via North Stream and have not reduced taxes  but lobby against LNG and US agro imports into EU &amp; you do not want to lead Austria to NATO so why
Well and that @MFA_Austria is 100% supporter of @PhilHoganEU &amp; @EUAgri and @USAmbEU is right that USA is big agro producer and needs more market access to EU consumers. Are you for or against including Agro into the EU US trade talks Mr @sebastiankurz - well sorry against?
O Sorry Mr President @realDonaldTrump this is not popular and so we stay neutral, I just came to discuss about @Trade_EU @USTradeRep to make a deal. But Mr Chancellor is this not for EU @MalmstromEU &amp; @JunckerEU &amp; my @WhiteHouse briefed me Austria was even very anti CETA &amp; TTIP?
So you are neutral Mr Chancellor and why are you coming that to see the leader of the West and USA and NATO? Do you want to join @NATO I would be pleased to welcome responsible and mature members as allies and friends! @usembvienna Are you leading @AustriaatNATO to NATO now?
Well Mr Chancellor @sebastiankurz how about defence spending. Remember I bullied European @NATO @jensstoltenberg members in spending 50 Billion a year more from 2019 on defence, how about Austria? Sorry Mr President we are neutral and love to spend little like 0,67%, popular in A

ETR reminds on the terrible and immoral role model of Austrian neutrality, free riding at 0,67% Defense @DeptofDefense spending @USNATO in middle of European NATO &amp; promoting this model from Bosnia, Serbia to Ukraine all part of the new Russia neutrality agenda undermine EU-NATO
ETR reminds that the price for Austrian unity was high. Not only Austria loosing so much for so long but well we gained unity. well but it led the Hungarians desire the same in 1956 - the Soviet destroyed that hope with their tanks. Unity of Austria paid by the Hungarians 1956.
ETR reminds that @GermanyNATO had the same offer for unity for neutrality by the Soviets in 1955 but Adenauer saw the dangers of neutrality and saved Western Europe by joining NATO and Germany unity came by time. @AustriaatNATO @USAmbNATO @usembvienna -accepted Soviet dirty deal
ETR reminds that Chancellor Adenauer called Austrian Neutrality a dirty international socialist scandal back in 1954 when he first learnt about the Austrians dealing in the back of Germany &amp; USA &amp; NATO with Soviets to deal unity for neutrality. @realDonaldTrump @sebastiankurz
@HashimThaciRKS @erna_solberg ETR calls for Kosovo to offer Norways Statkraft the Ujiman-Gazivoda HPP in concession same like DHP Albania &amp; EU @eu_eeas to support Norway to get same concession for Serbian part of that lake. @FabriziSem - so one stumbling block of in safe hands @haradinajramush @JHahnEU
ETR calls on USA to invite Austria to join NATO - Austrians for NATO! Please after 100 years of confusion and lost in central Europe Austrians long journey in Nirvana of Neutrality has to end, it is time be included where all Europe is already. Time for NATO. @StateDept @eu_eeas

@JHahnEU @predsednikrs @avucic @MunSecConf @eu_near @eu_eeas @SRBDiplomacy @Huber62 @SrbijaEU And this matters. Mr @ischinger makes his opening speech in EU colours - calling for European common policy - ETR fully supports that. We need more unity &amp; than we take Serbia in EU that openly sides with hostile Russia on about all issues? Most of all the most important Ukraine!
@JHahnEU @predsednikrs @avucic @MunSecConf @eu_near @eu_eeas @SRBDiplomacy @Huber62 @SrbijaEU ETR understands some might say in NATO or not does it matter as Serbia is a small nation in middle of European NATO. Well in a pre 2014 world it might little. But how Serbia has acted towards @MFA_Ukraine &amp; Crimea &amp; the West response that showed all what is wrong in BG today.
@JHahnEU @predsednikrs @avucic @MunSecConf @eu_near @eu_eeas @SRBDiplomacy @Huber62 @SrbijaEU ETR reminds that the EU Strategy of appeasing Serbia by focusing on Serbia instead of Bosnia and RKS has failed &amp; was never realistic. President @avucic is raised in political tradition of late Tito - the master student of playing off West &amp; East -well &amp; that is just what he does
@JHahnEU @predsednikrs @avucic @MunSecConf @eu_near @eu_eeas @SRBDiplomacy @Huber62 @SrbijaEU ETR would remind that since 2004 all Central Europeans joining @NATO before EU. Why? Because EU &amp; NATO are twin pillars of West in Europe. NATO reforms defence, security &amp; intelligence, civil &amp; military relations - EU does not do that. Not joining NATO shows SRB not ready for EU

In response to this, France is promoting the creation of a pan-African monetary union similar to the EU, with the CFA zone as its core.@ecb
Holding the peg to the euro also forces the two CFA franc central banks to follow the monetary policy of the European Central Bank, which effectively sets interest rates for the CFA franc zone.
So for nearly all intents and purposes, the 14 countries in the CFA franc currency union use the same currency, and that currency can be regarded as a version of the euro.https://t.co/gx0IFhzTCu

@EPP @ManfredWeber @cdavandaag @cdaeuropa @sybrandbuma @Esther_de_Lange @ruthpeetoom ETR recommends be concrete in what means good partnership with Turkey. ETR recommends invite Turkey to CEFTA, Upgrade the Customs Union include Agriculture, Services. Invite EAP &amp; CA to CEFTA. Give Turkey pivotal role in EAP 12 &amp; new Southern Partnership. Strategic Partnership!
@EPP @ManfredWeber @cdavandaag @cdaeuropa @sybrandbuma @Esther_de_Lange @ruthpeetoom ETR agrees that Turkey can not be EU Member but counsels caution with abusing Turkey in EP 19 as simplistic election topic. It might be tempting populistic useful short terms but Turkey is vital ally in NATO, EU has Customs Union with Turkey, vital pillar for EU security.

@KurtBassuener @hannahluci @NATO @thetimes @albinkurti @AHuskic if interested on where the land swap idea comes read this how Russian changes border in Russia	https://t.co/95yO1Lahj9 - the same concept applies.
@KurtBassuener @hannahluci @NATO @thetimes @albinkurti @AHuskic On this I 100% disagree. We have to do it like in 2004 and 2007 Bulgaria and Romania are now a decade in and amazing progress since then. We have to measure progress from where they have been and how fast they improved but compare them to Holland. Yes we have to accelerate.
@KurtBassuener @hannahluci @NATO @thetimes @albinkurti @AHuskic yes that is terrible. It is a idea from Putin, mainly start a debate on land swaps from Kurils to Kosovo mainly to legitimise his Crimea annexation. Have you read about the Chechen border changes in RF? It is a folly some in West think of them so fox smart to play this game

ETR considers the current status of mutual Labor market Access between USA &amp; EU Citizens very limited &amp; unsatisfactorily. #wearenato ready to sacrifice life together in war but not ready to create prosperity in peace via a FTA, simpler visa, work, residence, labor market access?
A Common Labor Market of the USA and EU does not mean full Free Movement of Workers but allowing all who have confirmed work contract simple &amp; easy work &amp; residence permit for all US &amp; EU citizens. @Avramopoulos @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @mariannethyssen @USTradeRep @Trade_EU
ETR considers TTIP - a Common Market for goods and service between @USTradeRep &amp; @Trade_EU the priority but if the President @realDonaldTrump is so positive on legal migration and open to the World let us start with Europeans. #wearenato A Common @EUintheUS @US2EU @USDOL Market

ETR calls @MFATurkey &amp; @GreeceMFA @tsipras_eu to support peace between Greece &amp; Albania and Greece &amp; Kosovo. @MFAKOSOVO @AlbanianDiplo https://t.co/S2ASwAhbyM
Possible friends who help with Euro adoption can be @MFAestonia @LithuaniaMFA @Latvian_MFA &amp; as well @MFAgovge is very digital payment so adoption is getting easier every year technology wise. @MFABulgaria could help as well. Maybe @GreeceMFA is open for support @MFAgovge ?
But as Georgia is a sovereign country it can choice its currency and you can choice the Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Lari your choice. Technically you need only one Euro country you send the volumes of Euro to Georgia. @MFA_Austria did that for @MFAKOSOVO in 2001, @LithuaniaMFA option
ETR is understanding that EU @EUinGeorgia @ecb @eu_near @eu_eeas will oppose such a adoption of the Euro first. They did not like it in @MeGovernment &amp; @MFAKOSOVO as well. But it worked very well for all side - Georgia as well no risk for Eurozone. Much too small economy.

The currency is not only a very powerful symbol for the Georgian consumers, for hostile Russia that your future is EU &amp; for all appeasers in EU @EUCouncil that you are serious with it &amp; ready for concrete action. It is powerful - the most powerful tool there is &amp; is irreversible
ETR understands that Georgia really wants to be a EU Member. ETR fully endorses it but the EU @EUCouncil support for this is minimal. So either wait for the 2040ies when EU is ready or force the issue. You are doing a lot of reforms very well &amp; adopt EU regulations fast, effect?
ETR understands it is easier for @BakhtadzeMamuka @DZalkaliani to keep devaluating the Lari, no need to reform economy, increase competitiveness simple by decreasing value of Lari &amp; having own currency great tool for patriotism &amp; fiscal manipulation. But keeps Georgia down &amp; back https://t.co/rnXN8QKmxs

Big power &amp; economies imposing their tax rates on smaller ones who by nature have to be more competitive as they have smaller internal markets and less natural resources, less people, less reasons for FDI to come, lower consumer market size is a very terrible concept of bullying!
Le Maire was convinced that the majority of G7 countries, “even the United States,” are willing to establish such a tax system, “the whole debate should be focused on tax rates, which promises long nights of discussion for us.”	And how you enforce this? Boycott, Intervention?
That is a terrible idea! In the run-up to the G7 finance ministers meeting, Le Maire repeated his desire to establish a minimum corporate tax, adding that this system could act as a safeguard against tax optimisation practices by companies.
ETR calls @francediplo @EmmanuelMacron 25% “In 2022, all French companies will have a corporate tax rate of 25%. Why 25% when @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse has 21% and why wait for 2022? @ecfin @federalreserve @ecb @peteraltmaier 25% from 2022 is too high, too late, by far.

@TomMayerEuropa @Karin_Kneissl @derStandardat @GOettingerEU @EUAgri ich kann Ihre Sicht als Insider der Auseinandersetzung im Herzen Europas verstehen - Sie erleben die Konflikte hautnah jeden Tag.

So not to Alstom Siemens merger @ManfredWeber and yes to DB-SNCF merger open for all EU @EUCouncil &amp; @BerlinProcess @minfrastucture @MI_GOV_PL to bring in Railway assets &amp; build a pan European Railway system worthy of 21 century European power, Unity EU 37
such a European Railways Company can first plan in European Context of a whole Continental Company @Bulc_EU , @eucopresident fast track the links to Ukraine, Turkey, build major links @UfMSecretariat - compete in high speed network in all Europe with China amazing progress.
But and please spot the difference and @vestager wont like it. For the EU Railways Holding with DB and SNCF as main assets and G,F as main shareholders and all EU MS (&amp;accession states) to bring in their railways assets, become shareholder with @EIB as minority shareholder -YES
Nobody will vote more or less for the pro European parties in EP 2019 because there is a big Siemens Alstom merger approved and European patriotism based on big private corporation is a illusion @ManfredWeber We need a value , principle based EU pride, based on power of values,
ETR is deploring the fact that because both France and Germany are not ready to combine their Railway companies because of the feared political attacks the effort to allow mergers like that against EU Competition policy principles is utterly wrong &amp; part of a failed strategy.
And for this you can make exception to @EU_Competition on basis of strategic security but not for Siemens Alstom, a private sector merger of a company mainly selling to DB&amp; SNCF and so just making procurement more expensive to DB&amp; SNCF. This is not the way for European Champions
ETR is for European SMEs policy as the European Economic Model very much based in Competition enforcement. If you want big EU companies well then unite the DB &amp; SNCF - they are already state companies &amp; than you have a 90 Billion turn over Railway company competing with China,
ETR calls @ManfredWeber @AngelaMerkeICDU @EmmanuelMacron @JunckerEU @akk - @EU_Competition @vestager the debate about European Champions is fully wrong! You can not allow such monster mergers on the back of European consumers and taxpayers just to be proud to be big, impressive https://t.co/fmEYqgFEfV

ETR is fully against all tariffs but unilateral openness can by time be a bit exploitative. the rich USA with 20 Trillion is not happy with still relative poor China continuing and why should much poorer Kosovo be accepting 400 Million imports to zero export &amp; blocking Interpol?
ETR wants to understand if @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @StateDept use tariffs against EU, China, Canada to get progress in politics, trade why is @USAmbKosovo so angry if @haradinajramush does the same with 100% until Serbia behaves a bit more decent? Big Bully OK, small not?

@Petrit there wont be any military conflict including Kosovo ever as it is 100% secured by KFOR &amp; NATO. It is simple scaremongering.
@Petrit The reason why all this is even discussed is the Crimea Annexation which matters a lot for Putin and he wants it still regulated and accepted by Western World and so he is eager to have such debates in Kosovo, Kurils and Crimea as the real target...but nothing will happen
@Petrit The better way is Double South Tyrol for both regions
@Petrit and to be clear even if you had a mandate to give or trade land like in monopoly which you have not who will ensure fair exchange? how to respect the new minorities in the swapped land? It is disaster in making!
@Petrit And RKS future is NATO so work with NATO Allies Albania, Montenegro and North Macedonia -soon - are NATO - Serbia not..remove the 10% tariffs from the 3 NATO members, end border VAT collection, build Customs Union with your allies &amp; friends
@Petrit As I say since 2012 make progress in with the southern Balkans not with the northern Balkans. Focus on Greece recognising RKS - there are 153 for N-MK so why not for RKS?
@Petrit You have what can be called https://t.co/xjhbepcmPi 	Victims being focused forever on the perpetrator
@Petrit Well good luck with the Dialogue. Great if it works and give what it takes! But my assessment is there will no progress as EU, NATO have little real power in Belgrad so it is utter waste of time, btw what result in last 7 years in concrete terms delivered? Interpol? Unesco?

ETR reiterates land swap is nonsense @AmbJohnBolton this is a Russian plot to start debating changing borders from Crimea to Kurils to Kosovo but not a single of them will happen. It is the post War US political order we believe in even when you seem to be -flexible - we trust it
ETR reminds everybody this was started because Serbia blocked the Interpol membership of @MFAKOSOVO so why the USA is not ensuring Interpol membership and Serbia to stop these Anti RKS lobbying from UNESCO to Interpol? And no land swap is involved in this.
ETR is calling @KadriVeseliKS @haradinajramush @HashimThaciRKS @pacollibehgjet Do you really think the US @StateDept @USAmbKosovo will end the support for RKS after more than 20 years just because of the 100% tariff? Certainly not. And you know it.

Good luck @tradegovuk "We have noted with concern statements by certain UK officials indicating a desire to exclude the agricultural sector from the negotiation and an intention of maintaining regulatory harmonisation with the European Union,"

@European_WB @haradinajramush @KadriVeseliKS Instead of blowing up the coalition it is much better to build Balkan Benelux - to reduce customs tariffs to 0% with friendly Albania, Monte, N_MK &amp; end border VAT collection but collect at POS, so you can minimise border controls, show you are not protectionist, win debate

@EU_Taxud Tax incentive for for R&amp;D are corporate welfare which DG @EU_Competition should investigate much closer in future. If there is a case then the company will do the research anyhow - better to reduce corporate tax rates for all. This is most urgent for European success. 20% Max CIT
In any case the division in Greece can hardly get bigger and there is a majority there for Prespa should be good for peace with @AlbanianDiplo @MFAKOSOVO &amp; ETR is sure once Mitsotakis is in power - no progress possible for decade.
The logic is : If @tsipras_eu can make peace with @Zoran_Zaev why not with @ediramaal &amp; @haradinajramush as well. @GreeceMFA has major interests in @AlbanianDiplo &amp; @MFAKOSOVO the sea border was settled in 09 already, Greece has office in Pristina since 15 years @ApostolovaEU
Instead of massive effort to get the really big issues resolved which where is so little reason for both side to give substantial concession and no mandate in real terms to implement it and only one year left possible less focus on what can be done in 2019 and what matters
After the PrespaPeace success now there is a momentum to do similar big steps with the same majority in Greek Parliament required to settle with RKS and AL. Same mechanism, amazing result. resistance can not be worse. Cost worth effort. With Euro as both BiH pegged already-simple
1. @GreeceMFA to recognise @MFAKOSOVO 2. @GreeceMFA to settle Sea Border with Albania. 3. North @MFA_Macedonia to adopt Euro 4. BiH adopt Euro @ecb both currency are pegged since more than decade. @eucopresident @ManfredWeber Why? it is EU, Greece, ECB internal decision only.

Is a powerful undercurrent in Central Europe &amp; in most of Europe for historic socialist, nationalist, underdog, jealousy, fear of responsibility, misunderstandings and it can be easy exploited if you add some Trump statements and than we are where we are in 70 years @NATO
If the West @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @USAmbNATO does not push for @JosephMuscat_JM @AnastasiadesCY @sebastiankurz @RealTaoiseach @dfatirl @SwedishPM @juhasipila to join @NATO well more will see now much easier neutrality is to communicate to public. Latent Anti USA sentiment

@EUwatchers @NATO Moral grandstanding - empty
@EUwatchers @NATO There is no Tyrant in Power in NATO
@EUwatchers @NATO All powers do that all time - issue is to find right balance - well where were our values when the Ukrainians needed us in 14, when the Syrians needed us? When we left Afghanistan and Iraq prematurely? When we did Libya without plan?
@EUwatchers @NATO The US is the only global anchor and super power for now and for long and for good
@EUwatchers @NATO Well the USA gave us these great global infrastructure and secured it and it can from time to time readjust it - why was Communist China allowed to take the veto power of China? How come Russia could keep the Soviet Union Veto in UNO? We need to reform and readjust
@EUwatchers @NATO You have a second fallacy - the one of idealism / there is no ideal world out there and it won’t be - we need the right mix of power and values - both depend, reinforce and check each other - values without power or power without values both produce little long term
@EUwatchers @NATO There might be some in the EU and US who think like you / they are victim to a fallacy of short term thinking - as the success of the last 70 years shows and the need for 2 US interventions before - Europe -and the US need each other and complement each other - same in future

@EUwatchers @NATO It is not Trump, Putin, Erdogan.	But confused Trump, our Ally and partner despite all in strongest alliance ever.	It is hostile, declining post Imperial Russia led by Putin	And it is our NATO Ally and EU Customs Member Turkey led badly astray by a similar confused Semi Sultan.

@EUwatchers @NATO Well it is funny to be called a generation. True we have to convince each new generation of the transatlatantic value and security community again and it takes a major effort but for sure it is strong today as it was and will be
@EUwatchers @NATO Sadly this is an illusion - we were never ready for this kind of unity nor this kind of responsibility and we will not be in the near future. And actually given the costs of what you ask for &amp; the implication from a own nuclear shield to own global power ambition I am against it.

For European centre-right it is very good agreement.
@EUwatchers @NATO Well true he is the big bully on the block &amp; true he came to power with Putins help. Well but we have some progress on key issues MK, UKR &amp; we had really little to none when Charming Obama did do about nothing but retreat from everywhere Afgh, Iraq &amp; did nothing in Syria, Libya.
@EUwatchers @NATO Well that is certainly wrong. We are allies all in NATO since 1949 and some longer( UK, France) and some shorter 1955 BRD and some once free and invited CEE and more to come. EU, USA, NATO just solved major conflict in Macedonia - amazing progress. More to come soon.
@EUwatchers @NATO But to stay serious here in twitter better use a different wording. Nobody likes Big Bully Trump but we are in an Alliance since 70 and for the long term and not with him but with the USA.

Enlarge EU and NATO with all Eastern Europeans who want to join. EU 37 by 2029, NATO 34 by 2020 &amp; we conclude FTA with USA &amp; build common Energy, Labor Market.

Compare to Venezuela disaster mega Inflation in richest oil reserves of World! 	That is extreme but smaller countries with high countries risk have certainly much higher interest rates than CFA 14 and for them it is ideal to join CFA zone and use it as nucleus of African Currency
But all this Anti Colonial Socialist nonsense economic be aware of these populists in Africa and EU. A stable currency with low inflation, no risk of devaluation, respect by markets, domestic and International, lower interest rate, trusted by consumer and savers is fundament!
ETR calls @_AfricanUnion @comesa_lusaka follow this debate https://t.co/Fa933rZrxS @ecb ? ETR is congratulating the 14 countries who have stable, sound, low inflation, no currency devaluation risk CFA pegged to Euro. it is excellent basis for future common currency. Re-Name it.
ETR makes it clear. @ecfin @ecb this matters in all aspects for all EU citizens and Taxpayers so this has to be transferred to European level from Paris. Well appoint the French director but well adopt to Aachen and live the spirit. @francediplo @EmmanuelMacron
By the way for our junior populist @luigidimaio well what would be the effect of massive devaluation - this was Italy before the Euro and no it was not growth but migration so your logic is 100% but the debate is useful. Responsibility, opportunity and cost for Africa is for all
ETR is calling for the French role in CFA backing to be transferred to ECB @ecb @mariofcenteno @DraghiBCE @AngelaMerkeICDU this is too much for one country and too less transparent &amp; it is all Eurozone taxpayers backing Euro, and so CFA and fine. But then let the ECB do it all.
ETR calls for a FTA between @Trade_EU @_AfricanUnion &amp; with the CFA zone the investment security, currency risk, inflation is very low combined with FTA and @luigidimaio is neither competent nor factual. But the debate is reasonable because the @francediplo Treasury role in CFA

100% But supporters of the currency say that the C.F.A. franc has provided stability to fledgling economies, keeping inflation lower than that of other countries in the region and allowing for economic growth.
Both versions of the C.F.A. franc are now pegged to the euro. In return for guaranteeing the currency, France holds 50 percent of the foreign exchange reserves of the C.F.A. franc countries in its treasury.

We should be proud about these major achievements of Western civilisation and not bad moth them and leave them and with it reducing the UK from level 4 to level one by leaving Internal Market, Customs Union, EU FTA and only stay at WTO. And how dare to call that free trade? https://t.co/lCzLq383UU
The European Trade System with the EFTA, Customs Union, Internal Market and Currency Union, the the EU FTA, the WTO and all this are major achievement of the Western post war 2 World Order which major efforts of generation of Western leaders worked hard to establish.
Why? Never in the history of the European continent trade within Europe was so intensive, integrated, free and open and never before Europe had so open trade with the rest of the World. The is no glorious past to look back. It was never there. And creating such a free trade order

In a modern logistic and IT environment it will be costly but not a technical issue like there would be no supplies or no medicament coming as long as the UK does not change its product rules they will only be more expensive - consumer are harmed by higher cost not by no supplies
ETR is reminding that all this nonsense about Brexit as a logistic crisis is wrong. Leaving a @EU_Taxud Custom Union makes products more expensive but it is not a trade boycott nor a Continental Blockade a la Napoleon! All Nonsense. All side just have to pay more! Sad enough!
Now the Brexit extremist have found their ultimate target - the EU Army - anyhow nowhere on horizon in terms of a real Army. But media Jingoist fancy themselves appealing to deep rooted fear of the Huns invading UK again. And guess who are the Huns in that narrative...terrible
In Austria at least we have rules, practises and standards what can be said on TV - You seem to have gone beyond any reasonable standards, tragic indeed

@realDonaldTrump might not know but @federalreserve @USTreasury @USTradeRep @WhiteHouse might remind him and for sure @USAmbEU knows that we have 10 years of excited Anti TTIP debate about these issue - https://t.co/9xaSk9X05B
98% of our Trade potential is not Chlorine Chicken nor GMO wheat. If @realDonaldTrump @USAmbNATO @USTradeRep are only looking for a reason to go for a trade war and are not serious interested than are you really from the GOP? really for Capitalism? Freedom? NATO? What are you?

@MOF_MKD @MeGovernment @MFAKOSOVO @AliAhmeti @Bujar_O @ediramaal and please see the 2019 IMF growth forecast for all world and let us focus on @MFA_Macedonia reason for being almost the lowest growth figure of all CEE CA https://t.co/jC84C6QCuQ - 2,6 % is really very bad at top of economic cycle of this decade!
@MOF_MKD @MeGovernment @MFAKOSOVO @AliAhmeti @Bujar_O @ediramaal As well less FDI and higher tax how shall that help with higher growth please and higher growth is what matters most in terms of lower debt, higher revenues, ability to win election and keep population and accelerate accession by convincing EU MS that N-MK is working very well
@MOF_MKD @MeGovernment @MFAKOSOVO @AliAhmeti @Bujar_O @ediramaal If you have any doubt on what ETR is saying please ask @lulzimbasha_al - And as @AlbanianDiplo highest tax increase in Post Cold War Europe in 2014 has shown there is no positive effect in revenues nor in FDI nor in justice. Just it makes the state control of income higher, why?
@MOF_MKD @MeGovernment @MFAKOSOVO @AliAhmeti @Bujar_O @ediramaal All major investors which @ediramaal is bragging about were already contracted by Berisha and were coming because of 10% and the concrete opportunity of Albania and the security of NATO - now @MFA_Macedonia is in NATO soon but now before the boom you tell investor - not welcome!
