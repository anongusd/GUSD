@Walmart Furthermore, the condition of the tanks -- with the actual fish, not the tanks that are for sale -- I find their condition to be deplorable. Not only are they unclean, with dead fish frequently floating around, but also overstocked. One of the 2-3 gal. tanks had 8 cichlids.
@Walmart In regards to the overpriced issue: I actually found the opposite to be true. I bought a Febreze plug-in from Walmart only to find out the next weekend that I could have bought one from my local Target for two dollars less.
@4everNeverTrump Why don't you just move to North Korea, since you seem to think the leaders are so much more stable and sane there?
@treasonstickers Why don't all the people who didn't vote for Kim just move to North Korea since they think the leaders are so much more stable and sane there?
@OMGno2trump What do you mean 'abruptly' pulled out of the summit? He's been saying from the very beginning that he would do so if NOKO wasn't actually willing to have a productive talk about denuclearization. Also, if anything, this is taking attention away from #SpyGate

@specialkitty2me @SteveWestly Actually, it was 4 bankruptcies, and he was only using the law to his advantage so as to make money, like any good capitalist whose tired of government regulations would do.
@SteveWestly How was he willing to bend over for China? He actually took a pretty hard stance on trade against them -- not exactly what I would call pussyfooting around.
@PalmerReport Actually, it's Obama who begged Iran for peace. This president isn't going to waste his time begging; he's going to take a firm stance like a real leader!

@Drewl919 By saying we didn't want to attack 1st, you're implying that there is no problem until a war actually breaks out...
@Drewl919 NOKO has been plotting a bomb like this for two decades. The threat was identified during the Clinton era, yet remains unresolved. Why?
@Drewl919 So why, exactly, has this issue out-lived 3 presidents -- 24 years -- and gotten to the point where NOKO has become a nuclear power?
