@Acosta Jim, I don't think you're the enemy. I think you're shrewdly staking out a cool, hip, anti-Trump position. It's paying off, too, isn't it?
@DanRather @CNN @Acosta With respect, Dan, don't you think those folks have a point? We've been complaining about media bias for 20+ years. We know that the media is critical to a flourishing democracy. Why do you think we're so pissed off? I wouldn't hurt a fly, but I can certainly understand the anger

@PonsFaciaBella @johnlegend Not born that way. If they'd been raised in your home, mine, or John's, they'd be much different. Conscience isn't genetic, its trained. The only instinct a child has at birth is survival. Pain taps directly into the survival instinct, which is why we slap hands or swat bottoms.
@johnlegend Violence and pain are part of life outside the gates, friend. While a reasonable person can be reasoned with, a violent person requires much more effort. Maybe you should spearhead the negotiations with these folks. Personally. Leave your security detail at home...

@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox How did I miss this witty, highly intellectual reply? Unfortunately for you, there aren't any 12 year olds around so it looks like you're stuck with me and my mindset.
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox ... An ounce of deterrent is worth a pound of actual revolution.
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox But to be clear, I don't advocate folks open carrying ARs. She was posing for a picture and advocating that students be allowed to carry on campus.
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox No ma'am. A frangible round disintegrates when it hits something solid... Your 9 will go through the attacker, both sides of the drywall, and still be lethal to anyone in the next room.
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox "You don't have a chance, so give up and roll over..."  Are you even American, miss?
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox Let me see if there's a 12 year old around to take over my end of the conversation. That might be more fair for you.
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox If my AR were easy to carry and conceal, I'd much prefer it to my .45. Just not convenient, and I'm not trying to call attention to myself. Curious though... Which fact am I wrong about?
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox Now we're name calling? Cool!
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox I'm good with doing this... A 2A themed wedding would be fabulous! The in-laws thing was-again- humour, but I understand that you didn't get it. I don't want to argue. Did you need directions to the door?
@courtney_llove @blagojevic_n @KaitMarieox Sure it is. With frangible rounds, a standard AR is less likely to cause over penetration kills than a standard 9mm handgun.
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox Chartreuse. See, I can post random, meaningless words, too.
@blagojevic_n @courtney_llove @KaitMarieox You'll get no disagreement from me on that point.
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox Stfu? Yeah, get over that thought, cause it ain't happening. You haven't made any points, miss. You've demonstrated your ignorance. Nothing more.

@vothelo It's like they only hear every third word. So bizarre.

@GothamKnight05 @bainslie78 @blagojevic_n @courtney_llove @KaitMarieox Maybe. But someone would have had a chance off stopping or at least suppressing that asshole.
@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox The great news is that you, miss, aren't the only person that dgaf. 1) no. Her AR is not an automatic weapon.  2) you apparently do, because you opted to comment. 3) it's in-laws humor. If you don't get it, that's on you...

@_cninna_ @BrandLogical @KaitMarieox Couple things...1. It's not an "automatic" weapon in any real sense. 2. I think 2A would be a great theme wedding. 3. I'm as dark as it gets, but no one wants to have to use their weapon. Sometimes in-laws just need a reason to behave. ;)
@KamVTV @realDonaldTrump No. Discrediting them with the truth is a better strategic play. I like the intent though.
@bainslie78 @blagojevic_n @courtney_llove @KaitMarieox That's a great observation, however she was posing for pictures, which by definition is attention seeking. If only she'd been in Vegas...
@BrandLogical @_cninna_ @KaitMarieox I hope she carries when she gets married!
@Unpersuaded112 @KaitMarieox I disagree. Respectfully, if more folks carried openly and responsibly, folks might not shit all over themselves at the mere sight of one. I carry concealed out of deference to tender sensibilities, but maybe I'm actually making the problem worse.
@Linda3M @KaitMarieox Is this supposed to be a pick up line?
@blagojevic_n @courtney_llove @KaitMarieox Full auto is garbage unless it's mounted or in a bipod. Her AR10 is 7.62 mm so it has stopping power for days. She's good.

@waylon_coats @sonoravhvets You can't buy an assault rifle. ARs are semi auto only. When you talk about banning ARs based on need, most Gun folks are gong to shut down. I'd say to focus on ownership requirements: mental/train/insurance, and so on.
@waylon_coats @sonoravhvets Apologies. Thought u were trolling. 1 all gun ownership laws have to be federal. Need a unified set of rules. 2 fix the NICS background system reporting. 3 include a mental health screening. 4 armed responders or teachers. 5 end all gun free zones. Every one happens in g/f zone
@Byclemore @bitcoinization @soccorrio @Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, high powered is a stretch for A standard AR, but I know that doesn't matter to you.
@mickey_420 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper If anyone is taking an AR15 to war, we're in pretty sad shape.
@drdan041 @mickey_420 @casawhitby @jaketapper I think freedom is a consideration of the greater good. Surely you agree.

@theDougFields @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA No, I really don't. I know exactly who my representatives are. Hell, I imagine they know who I am by now. Btw, you're acting like I'm the only 2a person that doesn't want to see kids killed. I'm not. Not by a long shot.
@Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @bitcoinization @soccorrio @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I'd need to look into that, and it'll be waiting until next week. Wouldn't surprise me to find isolated pockets where that's true though.

@soccorrio @CanadaRobT @bitcoinization @Antidote4BS @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I didn't say inner city schools, miss. I'm addressing the overwhelming majority of gun crime, which doesn't make the news because cnn doesn't care if black folks kill each other on the city with stolen handguns.
@Jonesy47985411 @bjconk01 @mamagg113 @mr_pitchfork @TooMuchKarate @kailanthropie @Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Is that what you got from that? Sad

@soccorrio @CanadaRobT @bitcoinization @Antidote4BS @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I wasn't making an analogy, I was addressing his statement that gun laws reduce crime. They don't.
@Jonesy47985411 @mamagg113 @mr_pitchfork @TooMuchKarate @bjconk01 @kailanthropie @Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA That's pretty dark... I get it though. Dark humor is really the only way to deal with unspeakable pain. Cheers. To better days on the horizon.
@ScrabsMartina @BrianOKelley1 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA If armed mobs were attacking my compound, I think it would have made the regular news, too. Was there a point to your question, or are you just bored?
@CanadaRobT @bitcoinization @soccorrio @Antidote4BS @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA They may see reduced gun crime, but the overall crime rate is unchanged, unless I'm misrecalling. And isn't the UK having a knife crime epidemic? Still, I don't disagree with the concept of gun ownership reform.
@WickedWalnut Hey, thats great wordsmithing, while completely ignoring the point. Kudos. Get a screenshot of that to share with your friends...
@CanadaRobT @bitcoinization @soccorrio @Antidote4BS @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA We're just as bored with the same arguments from your side, trust me. Meanwhile, reform continues to evade... No analogy is going to be perfect, but you can still get the point. If gun crimes really mattered to you, you'd start in the inner cities. Thats where the majority happen
@ScrabsMartina @BrianOKelley1 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, wouldn't that have made the news? I don't get in car accidents either, but I still buy insurance.
@WickedWalnut I've posted exhaustively on reforms that would help, but yeah, at the end of the day, kids need human connection with decent people to combat the crap pouring into their heads from all sides.

@waylon_coats @sonoravhvets I mean, is an AR really an assault rifle? It's one pull one shot. The round is terribly light. I know they look scary but they're not any more dangerous than a semi auto hunting rifle. Most gun crimes are pistol related anyway.

@mamajeanab @ExactPresence @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA LMAO! Good luck with that, miss. Make sure you personally lead the charge, ok? Don't send those cops you despise so much to do it.
@dilekaksu @PatrickMaas_ @kailanthropie @Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, of course I'd be sorry.

@ricteves @vatthepinters @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, I'm not a therapist, Ric.

@drdan041 @Steven_Cabral @c_cloutier @casawhitby @jaketapper Really? Give it a try. I bet you're wrong. - IDK about social media monitoring, but that kid had plenty of adults in authority aware of his state of mind. he should have been denied when he made the purchase.
@ScottBu90066 @ThatsMorgan4U @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA 1 pull of the trigger from a shotgun can spray multiple lethal projectiles in an expanding pattern. 1 pull of the trigger of a "bullet sprayer" causes 1 projectile to be discharged. Your shotgun can be just as lethal or more than an AR/AK. Especially up close.
@ThatsMorgan4U @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Again, I don't disagree with having basic qualifications for ownership.
@ThatsMorgan4U @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA If we treated parenting half as seriously as we treat guns, we'd be in pretty good shape, too. Obviously guns CAN be banned. Full auto is pretty much banned already. Do you think we don't know just how easy it would be to ban basically anything?
@ricteves @kennethstorr @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Right?	Hey, @kennethstorr , its pretty heavy. How am I supposed to move it? You coming to lift one corner?
@monicaonairtalk You have a special classification... You're flippin awesome!
@Steven_Cabral @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Yeah. Still, a little tweaking to the existing laws -and perhaps a mental health registry- would clear up most of the problems. Hey, how many guns have you seen today compared to cars?
@Wizardoffun @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I was called out on that conventional wisdom a few months ago. Was humbled to discover that nugget is wrong. In many situations, a shotgun is an awful choice, @JoeBiden 's advice notwithstanding. The pellets/slug is still deadly on the other side of drywall. A hp556 much less so.
@wildacrewarrior @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA White Nazi thing was a hoax. 4chan strikes again, and AP took the bait. Secondly, this kid was visited by "authorities" (trying to figure out what that means) 39 times in the last year. He was known, but not in the NICS system. I shoot with a Muslim family. They're good people.
@ScottBu90066 @ThatsMorgan4U @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I could support a training requirement. The rest of that is whatever...
@ScottBu90066 @ThatsMorgan4U @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Scott, the Heller case disagrees with you, and that's the end of that line of discussion. We can talk about how to improve the system (put the "well" back in "well regulated", but the basic fundamental right to be armed -in relative parity- isn't up for debate. Its settled. Next.
@AP I mean, after the white supremacist hoax yesterday, can we believe anything you post?
@ScottBu90066 @ThatsMorgan4U @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA It's not THAT hard to steal a safe. Gun stores get robbed all the time. Why do you want to put my home in the crosshairs needlessly? No need to surrender my right to privacy in order to exercise my right to arms.
@Steve555M @ExactPresence @Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA You know the white supremacist thing was hoax, right? I fell for it too... 4Chan strikes again.
@Steve555M @ExactPresence @Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, you recall who the dems ran against him, right? That's all the justification anyone could possibly need to vote Trump. I hope Tulsi is on deck, because if not, dig in for a second term.
@ThatsMorgan4U @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I don't disagree. Would not have prevented recent shootings though. Until there is a mental health component to the background check they are going to get guns. I end a sale instantly if the buyer seems "off" but that can also open me up to being prosecuted.
@Antidote4BS @ExactPresence @Steve555M @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA The calculator, like the gun, is a great equalizer! You can have my calculator when you pry it from my cold, dead hands. #allcalculationsmatter
@ScottBu90066 @ThatsMorgan4U @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Why do you want every crook in the county to know where the guns are? You planning something? Sarcasm, but the point remains... If that registry is locked down, I could probably be on board.
@CanadaRobT @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA No sir, the law was poorly written and probably unconstitutional. Law makers agreed to leave it alone for fear that it would be overturned. ATF needs to rule on things like bump stocks individually as a result, and there is a high burden of proof.
@CanadaRobT @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Almost no one is advocating for full auto. Most of us were wondering how bump stocks and binary triggers were legal.

@ThatsMorgan4U @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Also, the gun hole loop hole: if the background check later comes back denied, that weapon is subject to confiscation. My shop doesn't complete a sale without a background check return even though by law we could. Its to keep NICS from passive denials. Could use improvement.
@ThatsMorgan4U @ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA My only caveat there is that registry is public record and subject to FOIA. After New Town, a news paper used FOIA and published the address of every gun owner. I mean, that's beyond the pale.
@ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I'm not opposed, but I don't think we should lift current restrictions on fully automatic weapons. That will catch me some flak from the right, but I think there is a line.

@Antidote4BS @ExactPresence @Steve555M @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I'm not getting too deep into that here, but you're describing the ongoing impact of reconstruction more than any inherent virtue of liberal policy. Also Cali sends .09 cents more than it receives if I recall correctly.
@Antidote4BS @Aspine @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Agreed. The NICS background check system is really good, but there is no mental health inputs and there isn't a requirement for jurisdictions to report felons, if you can believe that shit. That's how the Texas church shooter got his ar. Air Force didn't report his discharge.
@thecjpearson Calm down son, this is a long fight and we need you to be around for it. I completely agree, but there's no profit in getting your blood pressure up. Liberals gonna lib.
@BaybeeHair @NostiGirl @kailanthropie @Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA The point is that you're enforcing a technological restriction on one group of folks based on your assessment of need, and contrary to the clear meaning in the constitution. Hunting rifles are also dangerous in the wrong hands. Focus on the process would be more productive imo.
@BaybeeHair @NostiGirl @kailanthropie @Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA By your reasoning then, we should use government to restrict the sale of Ferraris. I mean, what do you need it for? Probably new I phones too... I mean the old one works fine. Any need based argument is going to be met with scorn I think.

@Antidote4BS @Aspine @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I'd need to think about that a spell, Mike. The specific language would matter a lot.

@ScottBu90066 @Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I doubt I'd be successful. Some things are worth dying for, freedom being near the top of that list. There are something like 5,000,000 ARs out here, and I'm hardly the only fella with training that will resist.

@Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA If the infantryman of the colonies carried a musket and the citizen carried a musket, I think the idea was pretty clear. Parity. Infantrymen today carry the M4 which is a high-speed version of the AR15. That's the line. No full auto (generally) and no high explosives.
@JohnLockeFan1 @Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Damn, that's right! I remember reading about that. I took the whole family to the range that weekend...
@bobmorse @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper The AR is a cheaped down version of the M4/M16. I don't support having high explosives, mortars, or widespread full auto, but putting an infantryman's rifle into the hands of an average man seems to be what the founders had in mind. There's the line.
@Quantumbandsman @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Hey, thanks for that advice. Doesn't really work with my particular disabilities, but I still appreciate it...

@RobGibson23 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper When folks talk about confiscation and a mysterious third party determining "need," its a knee jerk reaction.

@Antidote4BS @JarredSeidlich @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I don't disagree, Mike. We really just need to fix the NICS reporting system and implement a mental health reporting system. THAT part will have to go to SCOTUS though. Also much harsher sentences for any gun crimes.

@Joda117 @RikamoMn @jaketapper @KatCapps Yes ma'am. I thought I was being respectful. Certainly didn't mean to belittle you or your opinion.
@bruce_weingart @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Correct. Not unlimited, but... Colonial soldiers carried muskets. Muskets were allowed to citizens. Modern soldiers carry the M4 military version of the AR... Heller also addresses the word "militia" in the 2a.
@RobGibson23 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I mean you're right. The Republicans are chipping away at it like sneaky bastards... I oppose them on that.
@bobmorse @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper And you're opening a door that might just need to stay shut. The law that prohibits full auto is pretty weak and its only a gentlemen's agreement in Congress that has kept it from being reexamined. The musket is what soldiers carried. The AR is the same (almost). Parity.
@bobmorse @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Well, Bob, that may be true, although the Puckle Gun was full auto and available in their time. What hasn't changed is the nature of people who seek to impose their will on others. Timeless human constant there. As long as that remains, we'll need tools to combat it.
@RobGibson23 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper The Heller case put that to bed though. Its only unclear if you don't like their conclusion...
@JohnBourdon2 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Yeah yeah. Look up the puckle gun. Full auto in the age of the founders. Try again... Further, the SCOTUS has ruled that well-regulated militia doesn't mean what you're implying.
@drdan041 @proteus0 @casawhitby @jaketapper What are you proposing. Be specific. I already have to wait 6 months for a tax stamp for an AR pistol and almost a year for a suppressor ya know...
@Chicagofan76 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Breaking down the door would go badly for them... I hope it never comes to that.
@daedwa @Ellieca1673 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA I mean, maybe, but they haven't been able to get the FEDS to require NICS reporting. They lobby, but thats purely advisory. They have no real power to act. I know they donate a lot of time and training for shooters though.
@rokabilyrbl @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper You point out the next shooter and I'll hold him/her down until the FBI arrives and lets him/her go, ok?
@gilbert1dean @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Any way, a 9mm handgun round will pen both sides of drywall and still kill. An AR round tumbles when it hits the first layer and hits the second layer sideways. Most of the energy is gone at that point. Much safer in the house than a handgun.
@gilbert1dean @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Yeah, and the SCOTUS has determined that that doesn't mean what you're implying so... My neighbors are fantastic, btw, and more heavily armed than we are... But I'll keep playing catch up until I get there.

@avemaria412 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Investigate away... Also, I'm illustrating the point that confiscation won't go over very well. I'm hardly the only salty of fucker with training that will resist in infringement on my Constitutional rights. Fun fact: I sell a lot of guns to cops...
@snoWoitCountry @Antidote4BS @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA No. 30 round mags are for the range or for a tac course. We keep 20s loaded with hollow points. lighter and easier to maneuver in the house. Great point. If anyone is loading 30s for home defense, consider 20s or even 10s if you're upper body strength challenged. Also a tac sling
@proteus0 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I provide folks with high quality arms for hunting or personal defense. (Not much for collectors.) I also provide training so folks know how to safely handle their weapons. What, precisely, is your problem with that?

@DrJaneRuby @HenryTravis6917 @DanielBRichard We're so far removed from hardship that we think differing opinions make people NAZIs. I mean in a weird way that kind of means we're doing pretty well, right? Wait until they have to face a REAL evil though. The safe spaces will be overcrowded.
@RikamoMn @Joda117 @jaketapper @KatCapps I mean, I respect your thinking on this, but I disagree. I was a lot more idiotic at 18 than I was at 21. A few years can make a lot of difference. He might have gotten help OR a mark on his record to prevent the sale in that 3 years time.
@alliegata @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Obviously... My AR is a lot more useful than that little old thang. Cleaner, too. ;)
RT @CanadaRobT: @Dave57836192 @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Apart from a fun factor the AR has no place in civilian use
@CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA With respect, Rob... no. The AR is light. Easily adjustable for my girls. Low recoil. Easy to train. Accurate to 1 MOA. The ballistics make it perfect for home defense since the round tumbles on impact and is severely depleted of energy after the second drywall layer. No. Just no
@CableXJ @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper And personally, I like the idea of armed teachers. Volunteers with training or experience who can intervene decisively. You're a parapro, right? (God bless you for that!) Wouldn't that be reassuring? Properly implemented, of course.
@CableXJ @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Its not AN answer, its several things, none of which will function perfectly on their own. THE NICS system needs overhauled to catch mental health flags. We need a mental health flagging system. We need mandatory reporting to NICS and really Draconian punishments for gun crimes.
@loftontech @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Gun folks are usually pretty reasonable, until you push that confiscation button. We don't like seeing kids die either. The background check system could use an enema, I think, speaking as someone who actually uses that system. FBI could use some new tools as well.
@Ellieca1673 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA A mental health database isn't a bad idea, but it WILL have to run through SCOTUS, so thats at least 3 years off, if we started today. Serious issues about the privacy. It would have to be only for gun ownership purposes.
@Ellieca1673 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Step 1: Uniform gun laws across the nation. No one will discuss it, because Cali is afraid they'll have to honor my carry permit and Florida is afraid they'll have to tighten their restrictions... #dumbshit
@Ellieca1673 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA For example, did you know that many states and jurisdictions don't bother to report felons to the NICS database? That's how that shitstain church shooter in Texas was able to buy his infamous AR. The Air Force court dropped the ball.
@Ellieca1673 @CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Different thread, but I support several meaningful reforms. In fact, the NRA has a list of ways we could improve the situation without further infringing gun ownership, but... well you know, the NRA is evil and whatnot.
@CableXJ @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I'm illustrating a point, sir. Confiscation isn't an answer, because I'm hardly the only salty old fucker with training that will resist. If you want to have a dialog, that's the wrong button to push...
@jaketapper They need a tool that allows them to put a temporary no sale flag into the NICS system. Suspension from school should probably be a no sale flag too. Mental health database? Appeal process? Its all mental masturbation until we have a uniform national gun law though.
@DrMekahChica @jaketapper LOL! Molon Labe.
@CanadaRobT @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @NRA Don't send some poor cop to my house to confiscate my ARs/AKs. Please come do it yourself, in person. - We can talk about ownership reform if you like and background checks or mental health certs, but confiscation talk will just get that door slammed.
@Joda117 @jaketapper @KatCapps Yeah, America! We need to lower the drinking age! -Seriously though, In Georgia at my shop, its 21 for anything with a pistol grip. We need uniform gun laws.
@Tdog1954 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I don't want any more kids to die. I'm also unwilling to be stripped of my 2A. The FBI should have never cleared this kid, but the other 90,000,000 gun owners aren't responsible for this. You aren't going to punish us for it.
@danrickli @NRA We could require reporting to the NICS database with an Executive Order. Establishing a national mental health database will end up at the Supreme Court before it can be implemented. I'm not sure what would be required to implement mandatory sentences for gun crimes, honestly.
@FLRealist @youronestop87 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Maybe. I haven't seen anything to support that though. All I see from the NRA is reminders to unload my gun and "Did you lock your safe?" They also do a shit ton of training...
@danrickli @NRA I mean, approach it from a standpoint of acknowledging the 2A. Stay away from any point that smells like confiscation. It'd also help if we focused on where the majority of gun crimes happen instead of these mass shootings. Chicago will beat this number Friday night.
@lilly64 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Agreed. I acknowledged that I was wrong about FL law. In Georgia its 21 for Pistol grip. That's a problem. We should have a fairly uniform set of laws.
@AlysPopTown @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper In the words of Fred R. Barnard, "A picture is worth a thousand words." I have no regrets.
@youronestop87 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper If we followed the NRA's suggestions, we'd have a unified system that all courts reported felons to and MUCH harsher sentencing for gun crimes. Still wouldn't prevent this though. I can't believe the FBI passed this kid. Its Omar Mateen all over again.
@drmammal @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Yup. The federal law says 21 through a licensed dealer, but the state allows 18 through an unlicensed dealer. I was wrong. Its different here, which is part of the problem.
@BigEWill624 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I was wrong. In Florida you can buy an AR at 18. Here in Georgia, its 21 for anything with a pistol grip. Federal law specifies 21 for ARs if through a licensed dealer. Shitty, inconsistent law, I completely agree.
@AlysPopTown @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Ah... Pizza cutter comment. All edge. No point. https://t.co/JEkeEXrQIk
@CableXJ @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper My face is hideous and my name is irrelevant. Why would you want to dox me anyway? Are you trying to hurt my feelings? Good luck with that...
@Archiyan @KarenLMcHale @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I concede the point. Florida law is less restrictive than Georgia. Illustrating what I said earlier about having uniform gun laws at the federal level. In Georgia, you must be 21 to purchase anything with a pistol grip. Why should that be different a few miles down the road?
@joehill1967 @KarenLMcHale @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Hey, Joe... I just took a screen shot off google to illustrate. Do I need a legal disclaimer here? You accidentally made a great point though. Gun laws vary wildly from state to state. Thats another area we could improve things.
@Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @drdan041 @jaketapper Not one inch. At the same time, yeah, we could do better, although I can't think of anything that would have prevented Sandy Hook. The kid stole his mom's gun... that's already a crime.
@casawhitby @jaketapper I agree with the bump stocks thing. Its a cheat around a poorly written law. If we decide full auto is illegal, we shouldn't allow a bump stock to cheat around that intent. You missed binary triggers, which is a similar cheat...
@drdan041 @Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @jaketapper I can not wait to take my granddaughter shooting! She's gonna love it, I can already tell. If you've never been, I really recommend trying it. Very Zen is the only description I can give. Total focus, calm, and peace... (not a tactical range, obviously, lol)
@D_Shuttleworth @2Jackornot2Jack @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper That's a part-time job... I haven't been at the counter in a week. Gun sales were in a slump since the election, other than Christmas. Usually, these stories drive folks in, frantic to get protection. I send them to a range first. Knee jerk buying isn't good, imo.
@lambeflores @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I don't set the state standards for History so... I'm actually not even a gun nut. I own one for each family member (not counting the Chihuahua) and everyone is well-trained. Is that nutty?
@D_Shuttleworth @2Jackornot2Jack @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I've said that the NICS reporting compliance should be mandatory to all jurisdictions. It isn't currently. We should implement a mental health database (with transparent appeals process) and link it to the NICS system. Incredibly harsh punishments for any gun related crime...
@JoeyNCochran @drdan041 @Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @jaketapper Or bolt action, or break action, or pump action, but yes, you're generally on pointe.
@drdan041 @Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @jaketapper Training is essential. The evil NRA spends more time training safety than any other body on the planet to include the military.
@Mikexxxx1 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Agreed. Needs discussing. Also, that database shouldn't be used for anything else.
@Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @drdan041 @jaketapper Ditto. People don't believe me when I say that we had rifles and shotguns in the truck in the parking lot at school...
@D_Shuttleworth @2Jackornot2Jack @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Dave is following the law. Dave has pointed out several areas where the law could be improved. Be like Dave.
@drdan041 @Broman06703773 @casawhitby @jaketapper Dude... Hi caliber gun store in Georgia was robbed 3 times last summer. I'll take responsibility for my own Arsenal, thank you.
@drdan041 @brettdoar @casawhitby @jaketapper I've posted that at least twice... #1 great for home defense due the the ballistic characteristics. #2 light low recoil easy to train. #3 it's what the army trained me with so it's my most proficient weapon #4 reliable operation #5 cheap/ customizable for different shooters/needs
@greatisenough @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Yes, the kids. They've all been through NRA safety training and meet my personal standard for marksmanship. My girls are as well prepared as my son. :) what's sick about that?
@D_Shuttleworth @jaketapper That's Lieutenant Colonel Dave, and yeah, I've spent a lot of time thinking about gun law, gun safety, and how we can balance our rights, duties, and responsibilities.
@drdan041 @Mikexxxx1 @casawhitby @jaketapper Background checks are almost always instant now. WE still need states to report to NICS more reliably though. Also need a mental health database, to be honest.
@jkloc420 @chrisdee12 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I'm arguing for armed responders in schools in another thread...

@greatisenough @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Again, I have no need to justify. There are plenty of reasons to own an AR. It's fantastic for home defense. It has no recoil, so it's a great trainer. The kids like that part and that it's light. I prefer the AK.
@2Jackornot2Jack @D_Shuttleworth @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper If that's the case, the dealer should be in federal prison meeting his cell mate for a late Valentine's date...
@drdan041 @rodivxc @casawhitby @jaketapper For the record, I am not doubting..there are enough stories on either side to feed confirmation bias in either direction.
@D_Shuttleworth The same way they obtain opiates, weed, and everything else... By breaking the law.  Has that been released yet, @jaketapper ?
@c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper We are well regulated. Room for improvement for sure though.
@brettdoar @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I think that guts the intent of the 2a. Also, 5.56 hollow point is the single best home defense round in terms of stopping power AND not punching drywall. It tumbles on impact and loses most power on the second later.
@2Jackornot2Jack @D_Shuttleworth @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Anything with a pistol grip is already a 21 and over requirement. Must pass NICS background check. I hand back rejections (denials) every day I work.
@casawhitby @unhipcat @drdan041 @jaketapper &lt;--- injured in the line of duty. I can't. I'm still going to enjoy both my ARs (plural) and AKs(plural) with my wife and children.
@aka_deplorable @D_Shuttleworth You're welcome, miss.
@casawhitby Just acknowledge that you don't give 2 shits or 1 damn about crime in the inner city, since CNN and @jaketapper doesn't politicize it. It's ok... I love you anyway.
@brettdoar @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Amen! A background check tied to a mental health database. Required training. Even an insurance requirement. Transparent appeals process. I'm onboard for all that.
@unhipcat @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Read up on the SCOTUS determination of the meaning and report back.
@buygoodbonds @casawhitby @drdan041 @jaketapper I'd say that no law will deter a sufficiently motivated individual.
@chrisdee12 @c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper  https://t.co/DrajihLJIx
@casawhitby Well... I am the only me in existence. Tell me ... why these crimes against white folks are more important than a greater number of crimes in the hood?
@brettdoar @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Oh for sure. We need to start with mandatory reporting to the NICS data base. States aren't required. The air force dropped the ball with the church shooter in Texas. That wouldn't have prevented this though.
@2Jackornot2Jack @D_Shuttleworth @rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Do you have any idea how hard and expensive it is to obtain legal full auto licences? I'd say we've been fairly serious about it.
@D_Shuttleworth It's already illegal for a minor to buy a firearm. You have to be 21 to buy an AR. What, precisely, is it that you want?
@D_Shuttleworth The NRA has published a set of recommendations. Let's start there. No need for sarcasm... It's a fairly serious matter.
@Tactical_review Try it on Jake tapper's thread... These folks are dense.
Yeah, so I actually have some idea of what I'm talking about in terms of current gun laws... Did you have a point to make or were you just acknowledging that I'm a subject matter expert? https://t.co/iIjmCdz3IC
@c_cloutier @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper With respect, miss, we are well regulated. Under current regulations, that kid can't possess that weapon in any state. Can't buy it. Can't buy ammo for it. The regulation is in place.
@JenKnollTweets @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper That's already been decided in the SCOTUS. Barking up the wrong tree.
@casawhitby Again, you're only worried about the flash. The vast majority of gun crimes happen in the hood with stolen handguns. You don't care about the majority of the crimes because they only affect black areas.
@rodivxc @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper The local police have taken care of that, thanks.
@brettdoar @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Bullshit. Read it again. The part where no one needs semi automata. No one needs an AR. ask him who determines "legitimate need."
@casawhitby @drdan041 @jaketapper So you aren't concerned with the vast majority of gun crime which is on predominantly black turf and committed with handguns. It's just the high profile shootings in white territory that you're worried about. Once again. Under current law this kid can't have an AR.
@casawhitby @jaketapper So misinformed... Go to any nra training session before you malign them. Those folks put more thought into gun safety than any other body on the planet.
@AlternaFacks @JSG_in_Croydon @Jaxhomegirl @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Jesus has unlimited resources... That kind of statters and economic model available to us.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper If you can point out the next shooter, let's go bag him/her right now.
@SteveoCO21 @drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper We're already well regulated, with a few exceptions, but you guys always seem to forget THAT.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I have relatives and friends who have defended innocent people with handguns and *gasp* an AR... Again, we can talk about ownership criteria, but these won't matter until gun laws are federal instead of state.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Say it with me... "Shall not be infringed." Unless you can prove an imminent danger ... Ps, this kid would not legally be able to be in possession of an AR. Pistol grip weapons are prohibited to folks under 21.
@casawhitby @drdan041 @jaketapper Why? Handguns are the overwhelming number 1 killer. By an order of magnitude... Oh you don't care about gun crime unless it's ona white neighborhood? Got it.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper Then follow the change protocol in the Constitution instead of trying to short circuit it through Congress or executive order. Yeah, I taught history long enough to understand that nothing has changed. Thanks though.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper My guns are safe and secure. Every member of the household is trained and proficient. Why don't you head into the inner city with your convoy. Oh that's right, you can only disarm law abiding folks. I forgot.
@jaketapper Y'all talking about more laws and shit... Anything with a pistol grip is illegal for anyone under 21 already.

Omfg the irony... https://t.co/6PG7ugU4aw
@h2ocoffee @SaltySaltine828 @jaketapper Great spin.
@casawhitby @jaketapper Most of these things already happen. We need central consolidation of gun laws. We need states to actually report felons to the NICS database. We need to stop demonizing tHe NRA and listen. They are the planetary experts on gun safety ffs.
@drdan041 @casawhitby @jaketapper I don't need to justify anything. The founders predicted your brand of ticket and used clear language about it. "Shall not be infringed." We can discuss ownership criteria if you like, but don't send some poor cop to confiscate my guns. Do it yourself. In person.

I don't think anyone is being denied access. Honestly, I don't think they're even considering completely doing away with snap. If we provide staple foods for a base and a reduced snap supplement, I don't see the problem... With respect. https://t.co/nZbawkhf61
@Milmore @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump The reason I'm cynical about that is because I was an alternative school administrator. They went out of the way to provide fresh, nutritional meals which the kids promptly chucked in the trash. They're learning it at home.
@Milmore @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump I mean, neither are Fritos and Takis...
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump I don't want food stamps, but if they're bringing back the cheese and butter from my childhood, I'll be quitting my second job to qualify... Seriously though, I don't see a problem with cutting SNAP by a certain amount and replacing it with good boxes of food. Who objects?
@Patrici15767099 Remove? Sister, if someone commits a crime while on the government dime, they should hang... If we don't hold them to a higher standard, they'll be just as degenerate as the rest of society. (I men, not j-walking, but anything that is like felony level.)

@ericgarland @Tightlight1 I think the press IS focused. They've focused like a laser beam on anything they believe will shake @realDonaldTrump 's core voters. Still haven't learned the lesson of the election. I hope someone is looking at @TulsiGabbard  . She's the dems only hope.
@Tightlight1 As misleading as "Net Neutrality" and "Dreamer?" Couldn't resist. Climate change is not really up for discussion, imo. Cause is. I think it has more to do with that large, uncontrolled fusion reactor down the street (and it's shielding effect on cosmic rays) than with my truck.
@Tightlight1 @SheilaShain @JDiii1210 @MarkSKrikorian Is it rational to ascribe that motive to big business? In a collapse, every sector feels the pain, and business suffers alongside the average person. Businesses know this. A certain investment strategy is relatively unscathed, but that's it.

People are filtering into the office. Successful, well-paid people at the top of their industry donning armor to do battle again. Black, White, Hispanic, Male, Female, and one who is Other... My coworkers are better than your coworkers.
@MsBeautifulAnee @mondayschild09 @KamalaHarris I disagree. Racism exists everywhere at all times in History. We aren't going to fix that, but if our kids despise each other less than our parents did, then we're on the right path. The advice to fixate on skin color doesn't advance that. It enables. Truth is always relevant.
@mondayschild09 @KamalaHarris You're illustrating the great hope I have for us. When your grandfathers served a female officer was a rare bird indeed. A black officer? Same. A black female officer was basically a unicorn. We aren't where I want us to be, but there is no denying the progress.
@mondayschild09 @KamalaHarris My take away from this conversation is that the best advice to give black girls is to focus on the color of the skin in the room; not worry about the content of the character. I disagree. We aren't going to change whats in someone's heart. All we can do is focus on being great.

@stacyatsigns Of course, miss. I try to save my disrespect for people who deserve it, not for those I disagree with. :)
@reasonandlogic But why? We're not supposed to worry about where others put their genitals, so why are you concerned about where we put our faith? Modern Christianity has a focus on charity and love. It provides both hope and a code of conduct for a brazillion folks. We stumble. Who doesn't tho?
If you've followed me and I haven't followed you back, please let me know. Fairly new to Twitter and struggling to keep up. Not a snob, I promise!
@stacyatsigns I hear you. I even agree to some extent. I just don't think it's the government's place, probably because I don't see it as murder in the early term. We'll have to disagree on that. Later term, I'm on board though.
@Mike_Press19 Juan who?
@reasonandlogic @monicaonairtalk Again, with respect, "trust" and "confidence" are synonymous to "faith." The great news is that you don't have to have faith in God, and I don't have to convince you.

@MittRomney News flash. History is over. We're working on the future now. If we don't strive for accrual diversity in immigration and tie that immigration to a policy centered on job skills vs skills demand, we won't have much of one. I respect you, sir, but I think your view is skewed here.

@bartmckinley IDK if its an attempt at morality or an attempt to fight the fat/diabetes epidemic. I don't care either way. Its not their business to influence my behavior... Its also not their business to pay for my medical care. They'll regret their decision soon enough.
@tedcruz My understanding on taxes is that they should be as low as possible to finance the government. Dems shouldn't be using tax money to buy votes. Republicans shouldn't be using tax cuts to buy votes either. So yes, cut taxes. Also cut spending.
@tired_puppy @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Not! lol.
@rdsanchezjr @AnnCoulter Relax, @AnnCoulter . @realDonaldTrump  is following the old infantry adage: "We're surrounded? Good, we won't have to aim!" He won't make the same mistake Reagan and Bush43 made.

@TomFitton @bartmckinley @realDonaldTrump Only in the government could you have such an abysmal failure rate and remain on the job. 9th Circuit needs a Performance Improvement Plan to address their overturn rate.
@bartmckinley This picture hits me right in the feels every time.

@FoxNews #WhitePrivilege Life in prison for vandalism?
What's their overturn rate? 75%? Shouldn't they be on a Performance Improvement Plan by now? Only in the government sector could you screw up that much and remain employed. #twatwaffle @Chefstoli73 https://t.co/aZX3izOs60

@RealJamesWoods Probably the best use for Starbucks though.
@monicaonairtalk love listening to you! Very uplifting. Drive on, girl!
@monicaonairtalk I hate to side with a liberal, but... We need to legalize marijuana and move on. We're either free, or we aren't. Please decide now.

@repjohnlewis Poor Peter can't get a tax break if he's already getting every dime (and then some) back. Also, corporations don't pay taxes, their customers bear that cost.
