With cyberbullying and record high suicide rates, a re-evaluation and re-direction of American‚Äôs education system are in order! It all starts on the home front
Parents: our kids are our future. How do you instill kindness, positivity, and resilience against bullying?
Children that are raised thinking things like ‚Äúthe glass is always half full‚Äù will likely tend to be less entitled and less likely to bully others.
Studies have found a direct correlation between how students felt about their school‚Äôs climate and how well they performed academically. @THE_Journal @Schaffhauser https://t.co/M0qWXqHCTS
Emphasizing strong character, resilience, #positivity , health, and #kindness at a young age instills in children the fundamental character traits they‚Äôll need to grow up to be #successful , productive adults.
Early education and care should focus more on addressing attitude, positivity, and other aspects of emotional intelligence with children.

You guyyyyys - it‚Äôs important that we recognize our own hypocrisy in our anger and understand that if we are feeling outraged by what‚Äôs happening at the border, we should be equally as outraged at how the system is letting down American children every day. Right?
While the nation is infuriated at what is happening at our borders, it is silent about the injustices that are affecting #American children every day. And neither is worse than the other - they both suck. What do you think?
On a single night, there were 40,799 unaccompanied homeless youths under 25. Can you think of a time when the whole of #America united in public outcry over homeless youth? We certainly can‚Äôt. @HUDExchangeInfo
