In 2015, 86% of Americans supported #universalbackgroundchecks. Today, that number is a whopping 97%. 		Only about 60% of Americans use a streaming service like Netflix. 		Only 37% of Americans name football their favorite sport to watch.

#TheLandingMassShooting I’m sorry we weren’t able to fix this for you. We will not stop trying.
I’d love to live in a world where my body, soul, and mind, wasn’t preoccupied with this. And these are only the shootings that make natl headlines. By definition there’s a mass shooting just about everyday.
And to know, truly, that no where &amp; no one is safe from it. Why do we keep letting this happen? Why do we live in a society that checks off ~64 days, &amp; does this whole thing all over again. Mourn, debate, rinse, repeat. We owe the thousands of people we’ve let die so much more.
I know my work/activism puts me in a different mindset than most of America, but in what other country is that a normal way to think and live? To always know a clock is ticking until some city or town or household falls victim to our gun crisis.
I was trying to fit in some self-care this morning, doing some very elementary yoga on my living room floor laughing that my cat was sitting 6 inches off my mat, and the feeling hit me. I thought back to Santa Fe and felt a pang of “it’s been a while, it’ll be soon.”
There was a study or some research out maybe a year or two ago that said a sizable, public mass shooting happens about every 64 days. And I have never forgotten. And it’s to the point where I can feel it in my body. I’ll look at the calendar and think “it’s coming.”

So #KeepFamiliesTogether #StopSeparatingFamilies
This was mostly just to get my thoughts out. But I am heartsick over this and feel very helpless other than to donate money &amp; get people to contact their legislators. We have to think of these children and families now AND later. We’re harming them beyond what we can comprehend.
To convince people that “zero-tolerance”  is the right thing. When really we’re knowingly setting them up for lives filled w just as much trauma &amp; strife as they’re running from. The current treatment is abhorrent &amp; how it will affect the rest of their lives is truly just as bad
And I was talking about this with someone yesterday and they said, “I wonder if they know this, and so it’s part of the plot in 5-10 years to look back at the kids who will then be adults and say ‘look, they’re unproductive, they’re criminals, they’re on assistance.’
It’s something that’s intensely hard to recover from, and the traumas stay with them over the course of their lifetime, making everything that much harder and the likelihood of a “normal” life unlikely.
When they get here. And the trauma of being ripped from your family and placed in a cage for an unknown amount of time around people who aren’t allowed to comfort you and who have no idea when you’ll be able to see or talk to your family, only increases all of those things.
Assuming these children are placed back with their families, or are given citizenship, or are released to a safe home, we are setting them up for utter disaster. The likelihood of them having severe health problems, addiction, aggression, or living in poverty is extremely high
And as the creators of this common ACE test mention, there are many ACEs that aren’t mentioned in the basic 10 questions. https://t.co/puEg75W05c
The intense, long-term mental and physical health implications we are leaving these kids with cannot be understated. It’s safe to assume that they arrive at the border having lived through multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
