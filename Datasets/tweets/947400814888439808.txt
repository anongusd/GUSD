Failure is the opportunity to begin again, more intelligently.
Success is moving from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.
It is not wanting to win that makes you a winner; it is refusing to fail.
Never allow a failure to detour you from an accomplishment.
Set high expectations for yourself, but don't get discouraged if you come up short. With every failure you are one step closer to success.
You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don't try.
Every failure is a step closer to success.
You define your failures. Don't let your failures define you. Just learn from it and move on. Don't be discouraged.
Everybody is always trying to rush things. Success requires great patience. If you rush, you will fail. Be patient and remain focused.
Every successful person has had their share of failure. Your success story is being made now.
How you react to failure will either make you or break you.

Nothing of great value ever comes without struggle and hardship.
It's easy to give up at trying moments, but it pays so much when you continue in Faith.
Obstacles are placed in our way to see if what we want is really worth fighting for.
It will get harder before it gets easier. You just need to make it through the hard stuff first, and know that one day it will get better for good.
Life will always be hard on you, but it doesn't mean you should give up.
No matter how hard the situation is giving up is not and option.
The assurance between a woman and a man relationship is the time where they suffered together.
