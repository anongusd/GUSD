Europe needs to think hard about friendship with President of Ukraine Petya Poroshenko. Who wears chevrons with the name of an SS employee, quotes and praises the communist and executioner of the NKVD of the USSR and worships the USA. https://t.co/0Rc8Cke0t1

In West, Russia is still considered a backward country. But Russia has such discoveries in science and inventions about which in West still do not dream. Paradox is that Russia makes its discoveries and progress with help of advanced technologies of West. Which gets from China https://t.co/Ohb7oYNJpL
Further, the United States decided to place missiles in the belt of the former Warsaw Pact countries and in Georgia. But even here, Russia is ahead of them. By the end of 2019, 380 Peresvet laser systems will be in service with Russia, which automatically knock down any missiles. https://t.co/Rzcy0PdjI2
The USA lost the tactical battle again. The Russians focused on ballistic missiles while the United States planned to strengthen sea-based missiles. But the Russians made rockets capable of moving under water for 1 month !!! The entire US plan collapsed. https://t.co/1XVJOfvU2f
For example, Belarus receives gas at a price of $ 120, and Germany at a price of 380 euros and Germany is satisfied. That is why the US is setting Europe against Russia. Otherwise, gas from the United States has no chance of competition. https://t.co/P3HG729orC
