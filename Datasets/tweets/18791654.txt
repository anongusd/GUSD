Really interesting q ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know the answer ‚Äî is whether @GovAbbott ultimately helps more down-ballot Rs than @BetoORourke helps more down-ballot Ds ‚Äî regardless of outcome of #txsen race. Can Abbott at top of ticket kicking ass and taking names save vulnerable Rs? #tx2018 https://t.co/hM9iKEQ00T
Great great great @cessig viz: How Texas voted in every U.S. Senate race since 1961 https://t.co/RmfidZbNVT
yeah, but you‚Äôre talking statewide races, where geography is less of a factor. you could be right, of course. i mean, you are harold cook https://t.co/0wpm2Pcj5m
Yes, this is partly boring old coattails-slash-the last gasp of straight-ticket. Yes, @HCookAustin ‚Äî if there are @GovAbbott @BetoORourke voters, ticket-splitting not out of the q. But I think in this cycle, more than others, geography = destiny. It‚Äôs all abt the dolls 8/x https://t.co/QQc8Wp6Rum
Only possible hitch in this is @SarahforHD134. Her voting history and affect could be a levee that doesn‚Äôt breach, regardless of the outcome of the congressional race. I *could* imagine Fletcher-Davis voters 7/x
Similar version of this playing out in Houston with @Lizzie4Congress @johnculberson race. If Fletcher wins, q is whether fate of GOP Texas House members in Houston is decided by the larger nesting doll. Are there Fletcher-@gwelkins voters? Fletcher-@dwayne_bohac voters? 6/x
If @DonHuffines is a mid-sized nesting doll, then, of course, the smaller dolls inside are the Texas House races in Dallas County: @MorganMeyerTX @LindaKoopHD102, open @JasonVillalba, etc. Again ‚Äî are there @NathanForTexas voters who are for Meyer, Koop, @lisalubyryan? 5/x
.@rossramsey has been trying to convince me all year that @DonHuffines @KonniBurton may be vulnerable based on 2016 results. I continue to be skeptical about KB but have come around to possibility of DH because KB has no larger nesting doll and DH does. Again, could be wrong 4/x
@PeteSessions @ColinAllredTX Because #geography, the @DonHuffines Senate race is a smaller doll inside the larger Sessions doll, isn‚Äôt it? If @ColinAllredTX wins, isn‚Äôt that bad for Huffines ‚Äî unless you believe there are Allred-Huffines voters. I am skeptical (but willing to be convinced) 3/x
For instance: Let‚Äôs say @UpshotNYT is right about the @PeteSessions @ColinAllredTX race ‚Äî that Allred is up by 4. That squares with assumptions on the street about where the race is ‚Äî Allred by a couple ‚Äî though assumptions are of course sometimes wrong 2/x
DO NOT know what‚Äôs going to happen tmrw in #txlege races but have been talking with Rs + Ds this weekend abt the nesting doll theory of politics. Each race in a doll inside a doll inside a doll ‚Äî and the fate of the largest doll decides the fate of the smaller dolls 1/x
