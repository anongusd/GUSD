The point is how dare someone like him whine and moan about people "hating" him for no reason. He's a hateful, ugly, pathetic piece of garbage. Sorry, but that's just the truth. What is there not to hate about him?
Greedy, venal, malicious, disloyal, spiteful, vindictive, mean, cruel, unkind, arrogant and conceited beyond reason, as quick to take offense as to give it, very thin-skinned for a bully who viciously insults anyone he dislikes- these are just a few of his best qualities.
Trump is and has always been worse than the worst degenerate dirtbag you have ever known.
And in Helsinki, Trump did not even bother to pretend he is not Putin's servant. Trump is acting in the interests of his handler: V. Putin, and in his own personal interests
to address the issue of Russia meddling in future American elections. Instead of addressing this threat to our national security, Trump is actually spending his time attacking and trying to weaken the United States's law enforcement agencies and our intelligence community.
Is it because he was a leading proponent of "birtherism," which was a false and racist  attack on Obama's legitimacy? It doesn't matter why. Because he refuses to believe the Russians meddled in the 2016 election, Trump is doing a total of absolutely nothing
One of Trump's thousands of problems is that Trump just can't stand anyone talking about how the Russians meddled in the 2016 election. He can only see it as someone questioning his "legitimacy" as president. Why is Trump so insecure? Because he did not win the popular vote?

@RepLeeZeldin Lee, how does it feel to know that you will be remembered in history, if at all, as an apologist, lackey, cheerleader, and stooge for the evil, unhinged regime of President Donald Trump?
@RepLeeZeldin What other nations have implemented policies that separated children from their parents and detained families together? Hmmm...was it Germany during the period from 1933 to 1945, while it was controlled by the Nazis? Hmmm...maybe it is actually an apt comparison?
@RepLeeZeldin No, Lee, comparing you favorably to a man who has honor and integrity would be a special kind of stupid.
@RepLeeZeldin Really? What is especially stupid about it?
While ordinary people are successfully distracted by their induced rage at vulnerable people and groups, they are too distracted to notice or care that they are being economically raped by the relatively small number of massively wealthy people who have the real power.
The underlying diseases and illnesses thrive because ordinary people have been successfully made to believe the falsehood that the "problem" is vulnerable groups like immigrants from s-hole countries or the poor or the disabled or gangs of various non-white groups.
If the United States was a biological organism, Trump and Giuliani would be like cancer and psoriasis. The United States is suffering from one or more diseases or illnesses. Trump and Giuliani are symptoms of these diseases or illnesses.

When he doesn't get the love and adulation and accolades that he so desperately needs and wants and feels he deserves,  he acts like a spoiled child, the boy who cried "fake media,"and calls the media the enemy of the state, and bemoans the fact that newspapers can publish
Donald Trump acts like he believes he is entitled to positive media coverage at all times, that the media should only be heard to sing his praises, to ignore embarrassing or inconvenient facts, and overlook his many flaws and eccentricities.

Judging from all the whining and moaning about how unfair and tainted the Mueller investigation is, Mueller must be going in the right direction with his investigation.
Yeah, because "gracious" and "respectful" are definitely two adjectives that define Donald Trump.
Here's a quote from Lewandowski and Bossie's new book, referring to Trump's election night victory speech: "But that night, at that moment, it was important to the country to see Mr. Trump the same way we had seen him for the last two years: gracious, respectful"
@funder If Mueller and his team are the incompetent hacks that Trump supporters have said they are, then Trump has nothing to worry about and the efforts to smear the Mueller investigation make no sense. It only makes sense if Mueller is seen as a viable threat.
