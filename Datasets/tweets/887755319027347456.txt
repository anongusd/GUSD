@senatemajldr @GOPChairwoman Leader McConnell,  I'm  sure the vast majority  of Americans  want effective border security.  What we don't react kindly to is when the president says it's  my way or the highway.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump TRUMP OWNS THE SHUTDOWN. He said it himself ON TELEVISION.
@AnotherFlower @WaPoExpress @AOC Dude, I was gonna say the same thing.

@SusanEvelynHE @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Was Ronna encouraged  to lie when she was growing up ? If yes, then enough said. If not then why does she ? Money, afraid of something, I'll  say anything to get my way?  There's  a self- serving snake oil salesman living in the White House. Does she really  believe in this guy?
@ShopFloorNAM I see 32000 added to manufacturing. Did I read  that chart wrong?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Trump owns the shut down.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I didn't  get 4000 dollars more in my pay. Insurance up, coverage down , record corp. buybacks. Mexico will pay, not. Hey Ronna ... never mind.
@ProudSkeptic Hey jonathan, what did you just say , I never read a book.  I just read you, and it only took 2 seconds. Loser. I'M  NOT FOR TRUMP. Maybe you should take a minute to think before you run your ignorant mouth. Have a nice day.
