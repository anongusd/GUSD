“NO” on $1.1 Trillion Year-End Omnibus Spending Bill https://t.co/XLat1pZWyX via @heritage_action
I voted against #OmnibusBill because it contains $2.5 billion in extra funding for West Africa.
I voted no on #OmnibusBill because it provides funding for #sanctuarycities and increased #refugees admission
I voted no on #OmnibusBill because it contains $865 million in extra Medicare payments to serve as a way to bailout #PuertoRico
I voted no on #OmnibusBill bc it freezes rather than eliminates the Cadillac Tax, which is key to funding wasteful, bureaucratic Obamacare
I voted no on #OmnibusBill bc it provides $60 million to conserve sage grouse habitats, which isn't really endangered. A fourfold increase.
I voted no on #OmnibusBill bc it provides $17.83 million for rehabilitation of a Congressional parking garage, $4.5 million more than asked
Voted no on #omnibus bc allows purchase of Russian engines 4 US rockets. @SenJohnMcCain says will line pockets of Putin's gang of thugs
I voted no on the #OmnibusBill. It contains a $390 million earmark for a new FBI headquarters when the current one is just a few years old.
I voted no on the #OmnibusBill. It provides nearly $400 million to the @UN for radical environmental projects.
I voted no on the #OmnibusBill .  It bails out the #IMF sending more U.S. taxpayer dollars to irresponsible countries like #Greece.
