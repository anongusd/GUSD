RT @endrapeoncampus: U.S. Department of Education Moves to Roll Back Title IX Protections for Sexual Misconduct https://t.co/yYJAwdXkgN via‚Ä¶
More than three-fourths (79%) of the 48,000 public schools with students in grades 7 through 12 disclosed zero reported allegations of harassment or bullying on the basis of sex. These numbers do not square with what research shows students experience. #TitleIX https://t.co/mftDNGWyw9
Under the guise of fairness, Secretary Betsy DeVos is seeking to undermine the progress we‚Äôve made toward preventing and ending discrimination in our schools. Here‚Äôs how you can fight back: https://t.co/PhviZIKkjv #TitleIX https://t.co/is5g9eq0Ui
.@AAUW analysis of data reported under the Clery Act shows that the vast majority (89%) of 11,000 college and university campuses failed to disclose even a single reported incident of rape in 2016, despite numerous studies showing that rape is common on campuses. https://t.co/8u9ievhhqT
Sec. of Education @BetsyDeVosED has proposed new rules that would fundamentally weaken #TitleIX. When students cannot stay in school because they experience sexual harassment &amp; violence, their access to education is fundamentally unequal. Take action: https://t.co/PhviZJ1VI5 https://t.co/i3I9ih3TAD
A crucial first step toward preventing and addressing the sexual harassment and assault is accurate reporting and measurement. But AAUW analysis has found that k-12 and higher educational institutions in the US are failing to take this step. https://t.co/11mnbgGNhJ
We must stand with survivors and continue to uphold #TitleIX! Take action now: https://t.co/PhviZIKkjv https://t.co/3mHHJnkexI
"AAUW stands with surviors and we remain committed to protecting and defending #TitleIX" - @AAUW's SVP @DebVagins 		Read more here: https://t.co/pQtegtjoQy https://t.co/zY8EPlTq7H
The @usedgov is now accepting public comments on these proposed changes and we must speak up - loudly - to fight back. Make your voice heard by adding your name to @AAUW's petition at: https://t.co/PhviZIKkjv #TitleIX https://t.co/mZ1GvoCMGn
Any action that limits recourse for students who experience sexual harassment or assault in schools is WRONG. These proposed rules are completely at odds with the promise of #TitleIX! Read the rest of @AAUW's statement here: https://t.co/OUYWAGyEw7 https://t.co/YDVpY7zrpD
Federal education officials took steps today that could make it more difficult for students to report incidents of sexual harassment and violence‚Äîand easier for schools to ignore them when they do. This is unacceptable! Take action and protect #TitleIX: https://t.co/PhviZJ1VI5 https://t.co/Y5Zz2gEbGq

67M women w/ pre-existing conditions could lose affordable coverage if the	Senate confirms Kavanaugh and SCOTUS considers the TX case challenging the	ACA. Kavanaugh would shift the balance on the court for the powerful and against	the people. #PreExAtStake #StopKavanaugh
The Affordable Care Act made it illegal to deny women coverage because they are	sick or have pre-existing conditions including having had breast cancer or a Csection.	If confirmed, Kavanaugh could take us backwards. https://t.co/s98G63mu0g #PreExAtStake	#StopKavanaugh
If Kavanaugh is confirmed women could:	- Lose #ACA protections of coverage for pre-existing condition.	- Pay more than men for the same coverage.	- Lose coverage if the ACA is gutted.	Call your senators today &amp; tell them to #StopKavanaugh: https://t.co/s98G63mu0g #PreExAtStake
Kavanaugh is a threat to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and will make it impossible for people with pre-existing conditions to get affordable health insurance. He would threaten our access to #healthcare. https://t.co/s98G634T8I #PreExAtStake	#StopKavanaugh
