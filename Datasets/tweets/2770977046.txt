@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman Truth hurts, don't it? I suspect that you are a white supremacist. The #1 rule of WS is deception. You're saying that race had nothing to do with this Cosby case, that it's a conspiracy. You sound just like a WS.
@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman You would know since you are in the same boat with the alt-right.
@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman That fact that Cosby was convicted even when the prosecution's key witness was ALLOWED to lie multiple times tells me that the fix was in. A black man being targeted because of his race is NOT a far-fetched idea in America.
@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman And what testimony? Andrea Constand's ever-changing testimony? That testimony?
@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman Now answer my question without deflecting: Are you certain that ALL the victims are NOT lying?
@HaydenHewitt @tariqnasheed @tarik_kellman Btw here is your answer since you can't comprehend what I'm saying: No, some of the victims could be telling the truth but that doesn't negate that Cosby was singled out because of his race.
@GlobeBobRyan @crosis42 Don't have to ask. They already proven to me that they wanted a consistent double double athletic big to compliment John Wall. Al Hortford is not that guy.

@JimmyMac30 @Syclonis @RealSkipBayless Barely in the frame? Really? Jordan's hand is at the rim with Stark's dunk. Problem is Jordan didn't jump high enough because he didn't expect Stark to jump that high. No one did. https://t.co/AkhNuCGYQl

@Kaliizacktive @Syclonis @RealSkipBayless The reason Jordan look so far away is because Starks was head &amp; shoulders above him. A 6' guard known for his jumpshot towered over Grant 6'8" and MJ 6'6". Plus most of Jordan's blocks came off the ball so everyone expected MJ to block that dunk until Starks kept going up

@TedWinemark3 @Need2BUsed @RevelsHiram @tariqnasheed You remember what you want to remember because in the same testimony where he said he gave women drugs to have sex with them, he also said he did so with their knowledge.
@TedWinemark3 @Need2BUsed @RevelsHiram @tariqnasheed Cosby said he USED qualludes which is a PARTY drug much like molly is today &amp; gave them 2 women 2 have sex. Fyi qualludes is a stimulant which speeds up the heart rate, leaving you fully aware of your actions, removing inhibitions unlike a date rape drug.
@Need2BUsed @RevelsHiram @TedWinemark3 @tariqnasheed Also, that court decision was predetermined. The judge didn't allow character witness 4 the defense cause according 2 him it would sway the jury. Duh! Andrea Constand lied multiple times under oath. A jury member said let's just find him guilty &amp; go home even b4 trial began.
@Need2BUsed @RevelsHiram @TedWinemark3 @tariqnasheed If Cosby is drugged up too, how is he in a position of power?
@_liberals_suck @ShaunKing @tariqnasheed @FBI It sure sounds like you do.
@Need2BUsed @RevelsHiram @TedWinemark3 @tariqnasheed If BOTH are drugged, how can it be rape? Neither one are in their right frame of mind. Whatever happens, happens at that point. Don't do drugs!
@TheFilth57 @tariqnasheed @YahooNewsUK After browsing your profile, I can clearly see you're a Trump-loving anti-black white supremacist, which makes your suggestion of violence against a black man a hate crime.

But eventually it will come back to bite them in the ass.

@MsWAMRights @tariqnasheed Thank you for proving my point! He never said he "drugged" them which gives the notion that the women didn't know about the drug. In fact, many of the women were known drug users like Janice Dickinson.

@MsWAMRights @tariqnasheed Exactly! Can't answer the question so you deflect. Are we done?
@MsWAMRights @tariqnasheed So where did he say, I drugged her?
@MsWAMRights @tariqnasheed What facts? Many of these women were caught lying including Andrea Constand. So we need receipts of these facts you speak of.
@_csquared of the narcotic, then neither these women NOR Cosby can consent to sex. Besides, quaaludes was a party drug like Molly is today. If I was on Molly &amp; a female wanted to get high with me &amp; I give her a pill &amp; we had sex, who consented to the sex? Both of us were high.
@_csquared Cosby never admitted to drugging women. That's a blatant lie. People who say that have a sinister agenda to publicly and symbolically flogged a powerful black man. If Bill Cosby gave these drugs to these women knowlingly and BOTH Cosby and these women are under the influence

@ourstreetstweet @tariqnasheed It's not about the celebrity themself.   The dominant white society use black celebrities to send black society messages. Like with Meek, they're saying that black people can get a fair shake in the judicial system.
@tariqnasheed Haha I've been listening &amp; following you too long, Tariq. I was thinking along the same lines. Philly is full of red-neck hillbilly white boys who are avid Sixers fans. I was expecting at least half the crowd booing him. But the thunderous applause and admiration threw me off.

@DarkSkin_2019 @OckyJ83 I have to agree. It's a harsh reality, but Haiti took care of their coon problem in a similar way, ending in their freedom.

@grymloche @LedianaDomi13 @RevelsHiram @tariqnasheed That's literally not true. Hate crimes are by nature racist.

State-sponsored lynchings of unarmed black men, women &amp; children is not legal, violations of constitutional rights.

@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 So to Tariq's original point, if Daniel Pantaleo was black, he would be in jail right now.
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 Don't worry! I'll answer it for you since you'll simply deflect anyway. Eric Garner's family had an easy win for violations of constitutional rights in civil court but Pantaleo didn't get his job back because he had too many death threats which made it unsafe for cops.
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 I get it! You have no argument! Finally, if Daniel Pantaleo's actions were justified, why can't he get his job back, and why did NYPD settle out of court 2 civil cases against his violations of Eric Garner's constitutional rights?
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 That cop had Eric Garner in an ILLEGAL chokehold even after Eric was on the ground motionless with his hands handcuffed behind his back &amp; several minutes after Eric said he couldn't breath. So miss me with no intent to kill!
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 Again are you saying disobeying an officer is grounds for execution? That's a yes or no question. If you keep deflecting, that's means you have no argument.
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 So an illegal choke hold has no intent on stopping someone from breathing?
@toughbreak78 @tariqnasheed @NewSaint37 So are you saying that a cop has the right to kill you if you don't obey his orders?

@Roni4488 @GregoryNorthLon @GrayMan42 @BradicalCenter @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign @Alex__Katz You show your ignorance for Farrakhan to say that the ONLY way he fights for black ppl is by being a Jew hater. Farrakhan has done more for black ppl than any Jew. Why should we disown him? For Jews? #foh

@Alex__Katz @jacobatkinson99 @GrayMan42 @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign I never blamed Jews. That's your words. I simply stated an undeniable fact, Jews owned slaves.
He finally agreed that Jews owned slaves during the transatlantic slave trade. So he should stop stalking our sista Tamika online now. https://t.co/DqM1gJcaUi
@Alex__Katz @jacobatkinson99 @GrayMan42 @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign Thank you! You agree with me that Jews owned slaves then. I knew we could come to an agreement.
@EchoSerenityXb @jacobatkinson99 @GrayMan42 @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign @Alex__Katz Thank you for clarifying your suspected white supremacist's views!
@EchoSerenityXb @jacobatkinson99 @GrayMan42 @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign @Alex__Katz So it doesn't matter if Jews owned slaves during an era where black people were considered property, beaten, killed, sodomized, raped, sold and auctioned like cattle, etc. How would you feel if I said, Even if the Holocaust happened, so what?
@jacobatkinson99 @GrayMan42 @hiphophistorian @kweansmom @bobblanddesign @Alex__Katz Show me where I used the term openly gay! Are you denying that gay and Jewish people owned slaves? That's really a yes or no question. If you deflect, that means you can't answer the question.

What have those groups done 4 us?

@Theee_Stroups @PremiumFeeling @tariqnasheed One, who is faithful in least, will be faithful in much. We gotta check suspected WS on their fuckery early in the little shit that they do that demeans/degrades blk ppl. This will set the precedent and cause them to move around us with caution for fear they will be exposed.
@fluffness93 @tariqnasheed @ialfreddyate What lie did Tariq say?
@Shawnboy851 @PurpleH8Z @tariqnasheed Other groups throw black Americans under the bus in order to gain approval from white mommy and white daddy. #butterbiscuits

@JairME_ED You sir are clueless about what white supremacy is. Therefore, speaking on it makes you look foolish. Just stop!
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec Thank you! You are a NOBODY!
@garybrustie @tariqnasheed How can we resolve issues behind closed doors while still informing the community? If you see your people being bamboozled by a fraud, airing that out to the community is paramount. In what manner you do it is up for debate, imo.
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec Btw....lol https://t.co/w396ZXmKzo
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec That's all you got, huh? https://t.co/cXeZBSSmBa
@garybrustie @tariqnasheed I disagree. We don't have to agree on everything to be on code. Right now, there's in-fighting among the white supremacists community but they're still on code. We're OK as long as we stay on code when the white supremacist starts to attack us.
@JasonBelmont10 @RealSkipBayless Baltimore Ravens is the only team with playoff wins in Foxboro during the Belichick/Brady era with 2. Even in the losses they had late-game leads. But believe whatever you want to believe to make you feel secure.
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec The king of projection^^^^^
@BarryDevone26 @tariqnasheed If Dr Umar Johnson is a fraud like Tariq says he is, I believe Tariq feels obligated as a man who introduced a lot of us to Umar to inform us esp if we give our hard-earned money to support the school he promises to build &amp; to hear his lectures.
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec And you must have fucked that dog to have that ugly ass baby.....hahaha
@DKnightstick @tariqnasheed @wonderwise_ec Hahaha! You must be slow becuz you "resorted" to insults first. So based on your own logic, I won. And what facts did you present? You word aint a fact!

@DB83Revolt @truth7_truth You misunderstood me. I'm talking about what the gay community thinks, not what I think.
@DB83Revolt @truth7_truth To the LBGTQ community, black ppl are the most homophobic ppl on the earth. Yet, they will say and do nothing when powerful white men and women say and DO some of the most vile things to that community.

@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H And let me be clear, the commercial in its entirety has racial undertones.
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H And you dont see that as a problem, right?
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H viewed as racist to black people? Or maybe they're so racially insensitive that they couldnt see it. Either way, its problematic.
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H WS is not always in ur face. Its very subtle esp on TV. As I said b4, ads like this aint new. So no one thru exp said, Hey, that could be
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Not to me. Cant afford to give DOVE who say they are about diversity the benefit of the doubt. No one in ad dept saw this ad as a problem?
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H *offended you
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Who said its purpose was to offend? And does that even matter? If I offended, yet didnt do it purposely, aren't you still offended?
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H So if a major corporation put out an offensive image of you &amp; your family, you would not speak out against it?
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Which means ANY perceived threat/indifference to our lives will be met with stern resistance.
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Black ppl are not in a position to give WS a pass. We are gettin killed with impunity. And ads like this only perpetuate the harming of us.
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Again, you cannot dictate to black ppl how they should respond. Not your place!
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Then why are you on this thread, reprimanding black ppl about how they should feel? Very disrespectful!
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Where is the third person in this pic ad? https://t.co/4l2kUfopHs
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Do you know the difference between a pic ad &amp; a video ad?
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H You love tellin a lie, dont you? Truth must not be in you.
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H The video ad featured a third person. There's no way around this. Dove apologized 4 the ad. So the only reason ur defending this ad: https://t.co/wJ4C0KnsHm
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H What facts? The original pic ad did not have a third person. You lied!
@fuckinwank3r @tariqnasheed @Leila1H Now you're using this logic. https://t.co/OFXDY9JDmM
