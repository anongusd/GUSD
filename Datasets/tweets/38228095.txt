@olaeyes It was racially insensitive. You don't get to determine what other people of color find offensive. If it didn't offend YOU -- fine. But it offended others and attempting to silence those who feel a way is out of line.

🚨BREAKING NEWS🚨		More on the Chicago PD press conference regarding Jussie Smollett's alleged orchestration of his own attack. 		https://t.co/Pbb3FjRLps
"Absolute justice would be an apology to this city that he smeared, admitting what he did, and then being man enough to offer what was offered up in resources in this investigation."
The one piece of evidence that Jussie wanted (the beating on camera) was not recorded because the camera was facing the wrong way.
"He [Jussie] helped us out when he identified them. He didn't know that we already knew"
On this whole situation...quite frankly, #GrioFam, we are confusion (no typo). https://t.co/gEWtVj3RIq
"It's shameful because it painted this city in a negative light...it's just despicable. It makes you wonder what's going through someone's mind to do something like that."
"We know they talked at least an hour or so before the attack and an hour or so after the attack, and while they were out of the country."
"We have the phone records that indicate [Jussie and the brothers] spoke quite a bit before the incident and while they were out of the country."
"Who is to say the leaks came from us? Just because there were leaks out there doesn't mean it came from Chicago PD"
In response to questions about why the 2 brothers are not being charged -- "They became cooperating witnesses in their 47 hour hold time." "Mr. Smollett orchestrated this crime."
"This shouldn't have garnered the attention that it did, but it is because of his celebrity"
Chicago PD has the check Jussie Smollett used to pay the 2 Nigerian brothers to stage his attack. The brothers had on gloves during the staged attack, but the scratches and bruises on Smollett's face was "most likely self-inflicted"
"This didn't get any special attention. YOU all [the media] gave this so much attention."
"We didn't pull resources for any homicides or police shootings to cover this"
Today at 1:30 PM (CT), Jussie Smollett will be going in front of a bond court judge.
Feb. 19, Chicago PD scheduled an appointment with a grand jury to lock in a statement from the 2 persons of interest. It was at that time, Jussie Smollett's attorney said they had 'new information' in an apparent effort to delay the grand jury.
On Feb. 15, after approximately 47 hours of the 2 brothers being in custody, they were released without charges.
Their attorney came to Chicago PD and said "something smelled fishy" and she did not think the brothers were the offenders as reported.
On Feb. 13, Chicago PD and airport police were able to locate and identify the 2 persons of interest. They were taken into custody and read their rights. They initially asked for an attorney.
Chicago PD initiated over 50+ search warrants to gather facts in this event.
The brothers purchased a roundtrip ticket to return to Chicago approximately 2 weeks after the attack.
The 2 persons of interest left the cab and later got into a ride-share car. That ride-share car was what helped the police locate the 2 Nigerian brothers who headed to O'Hare Airport to fly to Nigeria.
The community came together to provide Chicago PD with video footage after they abruptly exited the cab (the cab, too, had video footage) to locate the individuals.
"We were able to see that they fled in a particular direction and got into a cab. We located the cab, the cab driver and interviewed the cab driver."
Police say they interviewed 100+ individuals during the investigation. The 35+ Chicago PD pod cameras and over 20 private sector cameras helped them locate the 2 "persons of interest"
The police went into action immediately, and quickly found two persons of interest. They then started searching the area for video cams and witnesses.
Feb 29 - Jussie Smollett reports that he is a victim of a hate crime to police while at local hospital. Said the two offenders beat him, threw bleach on him while shouting homophobic and racist slurs and put a noose on him.
Edward Wodnicki, Detective Commander is going through the timeline of their investigation
“I could only hope that the truth about the situation gains the same amount of attention as this hoax did”
Chicago PD alleges Jussie Smollett sent the threatening letter to the Empire staff. When that didn’t work, he paid $3500 to fake the attack because he was dissatisfied with his “Empire” salary.
“The accusations within this phony attack received national attention for weeks”
“Bogus police reports cause real harm.”
“The Empire actor took advantage of the pain and anger of racism” - Chicago PD Lieutenant
The press conference is beginning. The Lieutenant of the Chicago PD says he wishes the victims of actual gun violence would get as much attention as this Smollett case.
Chicago PD will be holding a press conference momentarily explaining exactly why Jussie Smollett has been arrested and charged with allegedly filing a false police report. We’ll be live-tweeting as the story unfolds.

Good idea not to have @staceyabrams in a room solo. Nice touch to have an audience behind her.
Soooo... I can't read ALLL these responses. But I get that y'all weren't feeling #SOTU2019  Time for @staceyabrams !

@SunnyDayze whoa WHOA! I, @TiffanyDCross, am tweeting for The Grio. And NO WHERE did I compare #BLM to #MS13. I was simply making a point that facts matter. Just like our lives. I could make that same point at the end of ANY tweet. Not sure made that leap. Maybe you're in a dayze.
okay, for those who watched- what'd you guys think? #SOTU2019
HEY! You guys better not be falling asleep. The credits are about to roll on this show. And @staceyabrams is about to tell us what we can expect to see this season on Making America Great. Full stop. Period. #SOTU2019
Any chance he's trying to go so long that @staceyabrams will be tired? No chance. Me thinks... #SheReady #SOTU19
All about honoring those who sacrificed so much for our country. Separately, maybe decades from now, Members of Congress might be calling on a previously detained kid to rise and be honored for surviving the Trump admin ripping them from their families? #SOTU
Trump's withdrawal from the #IranNuclearDeal opened up range of negative consequences for U.S. with serious national security implications. Our major NATO allies — Britain, France and Germany — along with the EU, China and Russia remain committed to the agreement. #SOTU #SOTU19
FYI, there's still no #MiddleEast Trump peace plan. There's a new eruption of violence. #SOTU #SOTU19
Trump is talking about his bestie Lil Kim = North Korean leader #KimJungUn Don't believe the hype. Kim’s regime has failed to take serious steps to dismantle the country’s nuclear program. #SOTU #SOTU19
Congressmen @RepRubenGallego (D-AZ) &amp; @HurdOnTheHill (R-TX) introduced a Joint Resolution that would prevent any U.S. suspension of, termination of, or withdrawal from #NATO unless and until Congress is consulted and gives its approval for such a move. #SOTU #sotu19
Trump talks about passing legislation to prohibit late term abortion. Guys, imagine how GREAT it would be if the @GOP cared as much about babies as they do about fetuses? #SOTU #SOTU2019
ok, so back to this #HIV plan. People who are chronically ill need health care they can afford. That takes public spending, which the #Trump admin abhors. So you'll "defeat" HIV? #HowSway? #SOTU #SOTU2019

Trump says he supports pre-existing conditions coverage even as his administration backs lawsuit to scrap it. #SOTU2019 #sotu
HA! After a lot of gully talk, Trump will ultimately agree to a face-saving, inconsequential trade deal with #China. Getting China to play fairly in the global economy &amp; stopping its bad behavior over IP theft (you know, the things he prmised) will have to wait. #sotu #SOTU2019
ha! #Trump talks about creating jobs for women. Newly elected women in #Congress stand to say he created their positions in Congress.  He DOES NOT get it. And says "you weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much." bwahahaha! 🤦🏽‍♀️
2,737: The official count of children separated from their families under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, who were in government custody as of July 2018. #sotu #SOTU19

Trump talks about illegal drugs crossing border. MOST drugs come in the country through LEGAL points of entry. #SOTU19 #sotu

Welp, on the heels of trying to project a tone of unity he's throwing shade. "Partisan investigations," he says -- referencing the #SpecialCounsel You know... the one that has produced 35 indictments. #SOTU #SOTU19
Looking at both sides of the chamber, one side looks like America. The other side looks like what #MAGA thinks is "great again." #SOTU
Trump's argument that the corporate tax cuts would make businesses invest more is a pipe dream. Corporations' effective tax rate (taxes they pay as a % of their profits) was cut in half to an all-time low BUT has yet to unleash more investment. We're waiting... #SOTU
Trump inherited an economy moving solidly down the tracks, but he is set to take it off the rails. His massive deficit-financed tax cuts came at a steep cost. The Treasury had to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from global investors to cut the checks. #SOTU19 #SOTU
