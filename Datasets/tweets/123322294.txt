The (unamended) background check bill passes the House 228-198. There were 3 Republicans who voted with Democrats to pass it and 7 Dems who voted no.		Second big gun control bill to pass this week, but Senate Republicans and President Trump will stop both from becoming law.
Looks like the Democrats are going to avoid being upstaged by Republicans for the second day in a row. Their majority is sticking together to vote down the GOP motion.
Some background on this bill from yesterday. https://t.co/GVqu0Py8Pq https://t.co/PEKRZqzSRn
This GOP amendment would exempt domestic violence victims from this wait period. Not sure how that would work functionally but it doesn't matter, the whole point of this is to make it as awkward as possible for Dems to vote no.
The most infamous example of this was Dylann Roof, who got a handgun after three days when he should have been rejected. He used it to kill 9 people at a church in Charleston.		Today's bill would give law enforcement up to 20 days to conduct background checks, not three.
Currently, a gun retailer can sell someone a gun if their background check hasn't been completed within three days. One in ten background checks are delayed. In 2017 6,000 guns were sold to people who were later determined to have red flags such as domestic violence convictions.
The House is voting on another gun control bill today. Once again, Republicans are proposing an amendment that will put Dems in a tight spot. It would "allow a firearm to be transferred to a victim of domestic violence after a maximum of 3 business days."
@JoePerticone There’s a whole twitter account about it! @JJordansJacket
Here are the 26 Democrats who voted for the GOP amendment to report undocumented gun buyers to ICE.		The 8 Republicans who voted to expand background checks were: Buchanan, Diaz-Balart, Fitzpatrick, Hurd, King (NY), Mast, Smith (NJ) and Upton. https://t.co/1Qx6NGolwz
Speaker Nancy Pelosi concedes the Republican motion succeeding was a surprise. But she says it's "incidental" and doesn't eclipse the "historic victory" of passing the gun control bill.
The House of Representatives just passed a bill to greatly expand background checks - one in five gun sales today do not have background checks - but Senate Republicans and Trump are saying they will block it. https://t.co/cjJggPhYok
Dems celebrating on the House floor as gun control activists cheer and yell "thank you" from the gallery. This would be the most significant gun control reform in many years... but the Republican-controlled Senate and President Trump have said they will block it.
The background check expansion bill passes the House 240-189. Eight Republicans voted with Democrats in favor.
Gets a bit wonky here but after their amendment succeeding, Republicans are now voting against the bill (they still oppose it even with their amendment) and Dems voting for it. So it should pass with the ICE language added in. 		This rarely happens. Again, embarrassing for Dems.
Dems are now scrambling. Looks like they counted the votes wrong and didn't expect the GOP motion to pass. Now they have to decide whether to pass the amended bill or vote it down.
The Republican amendment was crafted to put moderate Dems in a tough spot. It mandates that ICE will be notified if an undocumented immigrant tries to purchase a weapon.
Surprising development out of the House. Dems are moving a bill to expand background checks for gun buyers. Republicans proposed to send the bill back to add language targeting undocumented immigrants.		26 Dems voted with Republicans to pass it - a big embarrassment for the party
Jayapal says that there will be hundreds of millions of dollars spent to fight universal health care (likely more than that if it came down to it) but says powerful forces also fought Medicaid, Medicare and all social security programs but those prevailed.
Outside Congress, 107 House Democrats are unveiling their Medicare for All bill to bring in universal health care.		Rep. Jayapal: "Is this a bold and ambitious plan? Damn straight it is. It has to be because the scale of what's wrong with our health care system is enormous." https://t.co/CQSwYSs3fD
She’s right. The US has middling health outcomes by western standards.		Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says there’s a lot of other factors that go into health outcomes but “if you get cancer or another kind of disease you want to be treated in this country.”
Senator Cortez Masto(D-NV) asks about advertising drugs directly to patients, which is banned everywhere in the world except the US, New Zealand, Brazil and Hong Kong. Pharma execs say it’s a necessary educational tool. Cortez Masto: if so why aren’t our health outcomes superior?
Johnson and Johnson VP Jennifer Taubert is taking the lead on fighting to preserve how drugs are negotiated. She says pharmacy benefit managers and insurers are “extremely effective negotiators” and there’s no reason to believe the government could do better.
The execs were caught flat-footed.		AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said that the tax break did lower drug prices “in a roundabout way” because it kept company profits high despite the costs of some drugs falling.		That one may make its way into some campaign attack ads.
Menendez asks the pharma companies if they put any of the tax break they got from the GOP tax bill towards lowering drug prices.		AbbVie CEO Gonzalez said they did not, but they did put the tax break money towards “stimulating the economy"
This is fun. Sen. Menendez (D-NJ) has several drug companies based in his district and many thousands of pharma employees. He’s a relatively friendly senator. He flat out warned the execs if they don’t lower prices Congress/the white house will		“Consider this a friendly warning"
This is one of the key advantages other countries have over the US. Want your drug to be covered in Ontario, Canada? You’ve got to negotiate with the province, which can throw around its weight to push prices lower.		But the US system is so fractured there's no equivalent
Notably, Senator Cantwell (D-WA) got the execs to concede that states (or the federal government) negotiating on behalf of patients could bring down drug costs, or at least they didn’t deny it. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier said the problem is it would harm other parts of the system.
(The answers were mostly that they’re kept up at night thinking about how they’re going to continue making drugs that will save people’s lives)
Ok Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) literally just asked the pharma execs what keeps them up at night. That was his question.
Here’s a typical interaction. Senator Wyden tried grilling AbbVie Inc. CEO Rirchard Gonzalez on selling the same drugs cheaper in other countries. You’re ripping off Americans, he sez.		Gonzalez counters that they spend $5 billion on R&amp;D and cutting prices means cutting that.
We’ve already seen that today with Pharma execs endorsing a Trump admin plan to lower drug prices that targets other guys, not them. Here’s a thread from a month ago summing up that proposal. https://t.co/hW0SJezxwD
One thing you get a lot in health industry hearings is a call for a “holistic” approach, which translates to “focus on other guys, not us.” And since practically every sector makes loads of money off of sick people, everyone can point their finger elsewhere.
Top pharma executives are making a rare appearance before the Senate Finance committee. So far they’ve told senators to stay away from price controls and “outsourcing” price-setting to other countries by letting in foreign drugs.

After a big shouting match broke out when reporters were shoved, in Lee-anne's case violently, the police have changed their tactics and are hanging back more.
A bunch of Republicans are not supportive of the emergency declaration route (Paul, Murkowski, Roberts, Moran at least) so this would be a very tough vote in the Senate if it comes to that.
This is fucked. The police say they're just "escorting" the senators to the vote. In effect, they're shielding them from taking questions. Never seen this before.
An officer smashed right into NBC's Lee-Anne Caldwell who was walking with a senator. Another reporter, who is pregnant, says she was also shoved. Lots of yelling between reporters and cops here, who are clearly blocking reporters from getting near senators.

Newsroom debate about how significant it would be if Trump gets the cash for 100 miles of border barriers.		Reporter 1: “100 miles is a lot! You could build a wall all the way around DC with that.”		Reporter 2: “That would probably get more votes."
Senator Shelby confirms the budget deal would approve 55 miles of border wall/slats construction along the Rio Grande.
Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows says he opposes the budget deal but "I don't know that the Freedom Caucus has the leverage to go to the mats on it."
Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski says the deal "seems to be a fair compromise" but of course there's no text yet. Democrats seem on board.		The right flank of the GOP won't be happy but this deal seems to be on a good course.
The beds issue is a whole separate thing, but it sounds like by giving Trump flexibility to spend money there that can be a GOP "win" to justify the lack of wall funding.
Republicans just briefed on the budget deal. Lindsey Graham tells us it contains $750 million discretionary spending for tens of thousands of bed spaces to hold people caught coming over the border illegally - a GOP ask. No clarity on whether there's any new wall money.
#2 Senate Republican John Thune says of Trump bashing the budget deal "I don't think he was probably ever going to be happy with it."
Things that have happened:		—Trump demands wall $$$, Congress says no, he begrudgingly signs spending bill.		—Trump demands wall $$$, Congress says no, he refuses to sign and triggers a shutdown.		Things that have not happened:		—Trump calls for more wall $$$ and Congress folds.
Trump says of the last shutdown that lasted 35 days: “I accepted the first one and I’m proud of it.”		Repeats he hopes there won’t be another one but is very unhappy with what Dems are offering.
Trump says of the deal Congress negotiated "I'm not happy about it" and he's "adding things to it" per pool report. (Trump's past additions don't have a good survival rate)		On shutdown: "I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown. If you did have it it’s the Democrats fault.”

Presumably it'll contain some border security funding and one side will call it a wall and the other will call it a fence and everyone can believe what they want.
Government funding runs out after Friday. Because House Democrats vowed not to vote on legislation til it's been public for 72 hours, in practice they'll need to reach a deal by about Monday to pass it in time.
Signs seem to be that we will not have another government shutdown. Per Senate Republicans:		- Sides are much closer today than Monday. 		- Trump being more flexible this time around, not digging in on one number.

@swin24 Check out the Canadian version of The Newsroom, which was so much better than Sorkin’s.
@jaywillis Rep. Tom McClintock (R) says gun laws are only effective at disarming law-abiding citizens, but fortunately there are known solutions. “Executing murderers works. Locking up other gun predators until they’re old and feeble works."
Gaetz tried to have one man kicked out for interrupting him three times. According to @jaywillis the man is the father of a Parkland shooting victim. https://t.co/M8Xpqx8p4t
As Gaetz says that the key to cleaning up America’s streets is building a wall and Sheila Jackson Lee launches yet another procedural objection, one member is caught on mic saying “ohhh Jesus Christ."
This committee hearing has completely broken down at this point with both sides raising points of order about the other. 		So this is going about as well as the gun control debate usually does in Congress.
Gaetz continues: “The greatest driver of violence in the circumstances I indicated was not the firearm, it was the fact that we have an immigration system that allows people to come here violently”		Another breakdown. Rep. Cicelline asks if there’s a rule against making things up
Rep. Matt Gaetz during a hearing on how to prevent gun violence says a background checks bill would not have stopped “the pain and anguish... of victims of violence at the hands of illegal aliens” but a wall may have. 		Committee has to be called to order as members loudly object
Some are mad at Coons over this so when I ran into him I asked if he was conflicted.		"He's the President of the United States. I I have vigorous and sustained policy differences with him and I'm happy to clarify those with him. But it doesn't mean I won't shake the man's hand." https://t.co/cNo0Z8y8yj

Oh hey it's Sherrod Brown making the rounds shaking hands.
Democratic Senators Chris Coons, Doug Jones and, natch, Joe Manchin do go to shake Trump's hand after the speech. Lone line of Republicans wishing him well. Trump gives Mitch McConnell a slap on the arm.
SOTU ends. The speed with which Democratic members grabbed their purses/belongings and headed for the doors is truly incredible.
It is almost over, folks.
Shout-out to the one member who went “ooh!” and clapped when Trump mentioned “the golden beaches of California."
Not sure what this says about the Trump family hierarchy but Don Jr., Eric and possibly also Tiffany are stuck sitting on steps while Jared, Ivanka and Lara get seats.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is one of the handful of Democrats to cheer for Trump's part about recognizing Jerusalem as the "true capital of Israel."
"America will never be a socialist country," says Trump, ending months of speculation.
If you thought the groans about caravans were loud, you should hear the groans after Trump said Hilary Clinton would have gotten into war with North Korea if she was elected. (He skipped a line about "potentially millions of people killed.")
Joe Manchin has been the only Democrat standing to applaud Trump a few times tonight. He just did it again for, of all things, Trump saying the US will withdraw from an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.
Things got real tense in the room as Trump turns to Virginia governor Ralph Northam's recent comments, talks about "executing" babies, and calls on Congress to pass a law banning late-term abortion. Republicans loudly applaud that last part.
Fwiw earlier today Democratic Senator Chris Murphy called Trump's plan to lower drug prices "sneakily radical" and said more Dems should work with him to advance it, but "he makes it so damned hard" with the dismantling of Obamacare also going on.
Nice to see Republicans and Democrats jointly rise and cheer Trump's call to protect people with pre-existing conditions at a time when the parties probably couldn't be farther apart on what to do with the health system.
Rebuilding crumbling infrastructure gets all the bipartisan love. Whatever happened to infrastructure week anyway?
Now Democrats are chanting "USA!" Two can play the chant game!
When Trump talks about all the newly created jobs being filled especially by women, a ton of female Democratic Reps stood and cheered and high-fived each other. Now they’re keeping it rolling for their actual shout-out. For one moment, the Dems are partying.
Her and RNC chair Donna Romney McDaniel seem to have found themselves seated in a very Democrat-heavy section of the crowd, but they are undeterred.
There’s a woman who I’m pretty sure is NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch who is standing and clapping at all the of the illegal immigrant sections, even if she’s the only one in her section standing at some points.
The wave of groans that came out when Trump mentioned "large, organized caravans" on the way to the US can best be described as pained.
@IlhanMN if you're scrolling through twitter wave your right arm.
My favorite Democrat to watch is Ilhan Omar who is not having any of this speech and just finally caved and pulled out her phone.
As Trump declares "the state of our union is strong" Republicans break into a chant of "USA" while Democrats mostly look bored and unimpressed. 		His statement about "ridiculous, partisan investigations" didn't even get a response from Joe Manchin!
We have reached the point in the speech where Republicans are jumping up and cheering every 30 seconds while Democrats (excepting Joe Manchin and maybe a few others) mostly sit staring ahead stonefaced.
The politics of which Democrats choose when to stand and applaud when is so entertaining.		Trump: "Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness!”		Senator Joe Manchin: [Stands and applauds]		Sens Coons and Carper: Well I guess if he’s doing it...
My favorite moment so far was as Trump began his speech Tim Kaine looks up at the press gallery with what I can only describe as a quality Jim-from-The-Office face.
The entire Trump family is here along with Joshua Trump, a sixth-grade student who is not related but who was bullied for his last name.
And Trump arrives to, shall we say, thunderous one-sided applause. (Actually there are a bunch of Dems politely clapping)
@kelmej Four Supreme Court judges are here (Roberts, Kagan, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh.) By Sicilian tradition, a Supreme Court judge cannot refuse a favor on State of the Union Day, so now is the time for lawmakers to beseech them to pardon their unpaid parking tickets.

Amazing Super Bowl nugget from @ezlazar. Pats defense would go to the line in one formation then switch to another with 15 seconds left on the clock. Why? Headset comms are cut at 15 seconds. Goff was cut off from McVay and had to adjust on his own. Clearly he could not.
"It won't work" is what Republican senators say when they don't want Trump to do something. There are a lot of Republican Senators around here who do not want Trump to circumvent Congress to build the wall.
#2 in Senate leadership John Thune: "I would prefer the president not do that. A number of our members have said that. It's a long, unwieldy process which probably ends up in the courts for a long period of time and probably ends up in him not getting the result that he wants."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on if Trump used emergency powers to fund The Wall: "What is the procedure? We've not had the procedure before because the national emergencies that have been issued before have not been contentious. I'm pretty sure that this one would be."
The #AM2DM community finally turned on me for wearing a Patriots shirt on the air. That’s alright. In life you have to stand for your principles. https://t.co/9KMOkak0ay

I’d say this is a major health reform but here’s the thing: it only applies to Medicare. The discount quasi-kickback scheme can still continue for private plans.		So this won’t effect most people, but could be an interesting trial for maybe doing this for everyone some day.
Drug manufacturers would have to actually lower list prices. No discounts. No extra cheese for PBMs. Consumers should benefit from lower drug prices (Medicare premiums would likely rise but the Trump admin projects only in the $5 per person per month range).
You might think “man, that almost looks like a kickback scheme.” Well, these relationships are exempt from anti-kickback rules! 		Until now. The Trump admin is proposing to change kickback rules to ban this practice for Medicare Part D plans. Ok so what this means is:
This works out great for PBMs - they get more money.		This works out great for drug companies — by negotiating discounts they keep the list prices for their drugs high, which others have to pay.		This does not work out great for people who need to buy medication.
Often what happens right now is drug manufacturers negotiate prices with a middle man, pharmaceutical benefit manager or PBMs, that determine what costs people pay when they buy a drug with insurance.		Often, manufacturers give PBMs a discount. The PBMs can take a cut.
Interesting proposal by the Trump administration today that would crack down on middlemen quietly taking cuts of drug discounts, at the expense of patients. Here’s a quick thread on how it works.

Also Graham’s turn aligns with Trump’s power growing. Their ceasefire happened after Trump won the presidential nomination. They became golfing buddies after he became president. If Trump had dirt on him, wouldn’t he have used it earlier when it really would have helped him?
Graham is the most prominent never-Trumper who is not only surviving, but is thriving. Since embracing Trump his polls have shot up among primary voters in SC. He’s chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He’s more powerful than ever.
Exhibit A comes from Graham’s home of South Carolina, where popular former governor Mark Sanford stood up to Trump and got booted in a primary. Others like Bob Corker and Jeff Flake opted not to run again rather than risk this.
Trump is wildly popular in South Carolina. He has a more than 80% approval rating from Republican-leaning voters in the state: https://t.co/IMRk6C1z0h		Graham is up for re-election in 2020. Anti-Trump Republicans have been murdered in primaries by pro-Trump opponents.

So, uh, I guess that’s Trump’s message to undocumented immigrants: only an idiot would go through the legal system properly.
So when you look at the issue of undocumented immigrants not showing up for court hearings — the Trump administration quickly moved to exacerbate this issue and now the president is *openly mocking* people who do show up for their hearings.
So the Obama administration had set up this program, the Family Case Management Program, that worked with asylum seekers, provided them some legal representation. It worked great. Attendance at court hearings hit high-90s percent levels. The Trump admin quickly dismantled it.
He falsely claimed that only two percent of immigrants show up to their court hearings. Actually, a majority do. But then he goes: “those people you almost don’t want because they cannot be very smart.. those two percent are not going to make America great again, I tell ya."
There was a very weird moment in Trump’s speech today where he mocked undocumented immigrants who actually showed up to their immigration court hearings.

THE DRAMA KEEPS ON COMIN. House of Representatives passes funding bill *with* $5 billion of border wall funding by a vote of 217-185		It's now kicked back to the Senate, who passed the bill without wall funding. Pre-christmas shutdown happens if they can't reach a deal
Currently at 136 yeas to 75 nays. Long way to go still but looks like the House is going to pass the border wall funding, setting up a standoff with the Senate and a possible government shutdown starting this weekend.
So the House is now voting on a government funding bill that includes $5 billion for the wall. It may pass, but if so it'll be shot down by the Senate tomorrow and we're back to the drawing board.

I'd imagine even most Republicans want the wall funding vote to fail because otherwise they have to wait for it to get struck down by the Senate, keeping them in DC even longer. 		Only question is how do they convince Trump to sign yet another spending deal with no wall.
So if I've got this straight:		- Trump is threatening to shut down the government unless he gets $5 billion in wall funding		- He has absolutely no leverage to get that		- The House will vote on an amendment to give him $5 billion, knowing it's doomed but maybe it appeases Trump
Here's our story on years of negotiations culminating in criminal justice reform passing through Congress just moments ago: https://t.co/Pt9x9DlPBe
Criminal justice reform passes the House by an overwhelming vote of 358-36! It is officially through Congress and on to Trump's desk to be signed into law.
We had three government shutdowns in the first few months of the year, and since then Congress has quietly been laying the groundwork so this doesn't happen again.
Trump is putting his foot down at the worst possible time. He doesn't have the House or the Senate onside. He can't fully threaten a shutdown because major chunks are funded. In short, he's got very little leverage and this is by design. https://t.co/ZaYfSMBub5

SPEAKING of Obamacare, Republicans say they had no idea when they repealed the individual mandate that it would lead to the whole ACA maybe being thrown out. (But some are just fine with it because a court is trying to do what Congress couldn’t.) https://t.co/aHXd92EaDS https://t.co/U0XUs6PcNB
So the Congress couldn’t repeal Obamacare. Neglect couldn’t destroy Obamacare. And two years of undermining policies by the Trump administration couldn’t bring down Obamacare. I think it’s safe to say Obamacare isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.
The big price hikes had already halted this year. Now we see that enrollment is stable as well — 8.5 million signups on federal marketplaces compared to 8.8 million last year (the feds run the individual markets for 39 states). This despite there being no penalty anymore.
Can’t recall how many times I’ve heard GOP lawmakers say Obamacare was already imploding, and even by doing nothing it would collapse on itself. Measures like repealing the individual mandate, to some, was the coup de grace.		Man do today’s numbers repudiate that view.

It's official! Criminal justice reform bill passes the Senate by a vote of 87-12.		Could be passed by the House and signed into law by President Trump by the end of the week.
Oddly enough Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had held up the bill and frustrated its proponents to the point of exasperation, just voted for it.
This is going to pass by a mile. Up to 85 votes for the reform bill, just 12 against.
An extremely jubilant Senate is voting right now to pass criminal justice reform. Lots of handshakes all around. Mike Lee (R) and Cory Booker (D) had a big bear hug.
Background on what the bill does here: https://t.co/MJHRrDCl6S		A couple Republican Senators (Cotton, Kennedy) oppose the bill and are proposing amendments, but those will likely get voted down.

@TravisJValle We've been over this but the controversial part of the ruling is not declaring the mandate unconstitutional. It may well be. The extreme part is declaring the rest of the law invalid. That flies is a major departure from severability precedent.
@TravisJValle We are still in the 115th Congress.
@TravisJValle No, this Congress did away with the individual mandate penalty while keeping the rest of the law in place. And again, the judge did not rule the ACA unconstitutional. The controversial part of the ruling is that one part of the law being unconstitutional means it all is invalid.
@TravisJValle Congress explicitly chose to keep pre-existing condition protections, Medicaid expansion, etc. in place. This judge undid that with an interpretation of severability that is, let's say, novel.
Common misconception here. The judge did not declare the ACA unconstitutional. He declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and then ruled - and this is the part that basically every expert is baffled by - that this means the entire 900+ page law is invalid. https://t.co/l7Gzu5V7sq
Last night when everyone was at their holiday parties a Texas judge issued a shocking ruling overturning the entire Affordable Care Act. Story and thread here. https://t.co/Ot4bpaZRHt
You can't just undo things like Medicaid expansion with a snap of your fingers. And the Fifth circuit could issue an injunction at any time (in theory even tonight) halting the dismantling of Obamacare.
In terms of immediate impact on the health system, I gotta say I don't think there will be much. Open enrollment in the individual market ends tomorrow, so even if they wanted to it's too late for insurance companies to reject covering people with pre-existing conditions in 2019.
Hard to stress how extreme this ruling is, but to pick one example: this judge prioritizes 2012 legal arguments speculating what the future would look like over the ACTUAL REAL-LIFE REALITY in 2018.
Basically: the judge found one part of the ACA (the individual mandate) was unconstitutional, and thus the whole, widespread law needs to be thrown out.
Can’t stress enough that when we hear about “judicial activism” you can’t come up with a clearer example than this. This judge overturned the will of Congress (technical details of why/how are in the story.) But legal experts I talked to described this interpretation as ludicrous
The ruling will be appealed.		This is a wild ruling. The judge found that a minor change by Congress to get rid of the individual mandate means all of the ACA, or “Obamacare,” is unconstitutional. No lawmaker, Democrat or Republican, intended this at the time.

One more note on this. Hawaii is the only state that mandates employers buy health care and it has the second-lowest uninsured rate in the country after Massachusetts. Senator Hirono says employers there support the system, but it would be a very hard sell nation-wide.
@MikeSheaAP Good point.
All this to say there’s no remotely easy path forward here for universal health care advocates. Getting employers to line up behind an employer mandate would be wildly difficult, but there may not be any better option.
But are employers going to get behind an employer mandate that may bring down costs but also would tie their hands? Seems unlikely. But then they’d hate a payroll tax or jacked up corporate taxes too.
There’s really only one answer. Employers would have to get so fed up with paying high insurance costs that they back a universal health care plan. If you can get Walmart, General Motors, Google, Walgreens, etc etc etc on board then it gets interesting.
If done properly, universal health care should save hundreds of billions of dollars. That means health industries will spend *at least* hundreds of billions to fight it. There’s really never been anything like that level of resistance. What could possibly counter it?

So here's where we are on border wall/security funding:		- Dems are pushing for $1.6 billion for next year		- Trump wants $5 billion		- Senate Republicans are offering $2.5 billion each for 2019 and 2020 (so Trump's amount spread over two years)		Deadline for a deal is Dec. 7.

Scott is going to get a lot of flak for this. But we should note that he was only in the position to begin with because 49 of his colleagues voted yes on Farr (Jeff Flake is voting no on all judicial nominees in protest over not protecting Mueller)
Farr and been attacked for defending voter ID laws the courts later struck down for disenfranchising black voters with "surgical precision." The deciding vote fell to Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate. He stuck with the party line.
In maybe one of the last dramatic votes we'll see in the Senate for a couple years, Republican Senator Tim Scott stayed in the cloakroom for at least 45 minutes as the deciding vote on whether to move ahead confirmation of judge Thomas Farr. He just voted yes.
Lee says the bill is a breach of the separation of powers and is thus unconstitutional.
Because McConnell won’t bring the bill to the floor, Flake/Coons/Booker need to ask unanimous consent to bring the bill forward for debate. McConnell keeps refusing to grant consent.		This time Republican Senator Mike Lee objected.
Flake says he and his partners are going to keep bringing this bill forward. “It’s clear that something has to be done."
Jeff Flake now reading Trump quotes accusing Mueller of going rogue and calling the investigation a waste of money and witch hunt ruining lives.		Flake says Mueller needs to be able to complete and present his findings.
For those wondering why McConnell is so adamant about blocking debate/a vote on a Mueller protection bill, it would put a bunch of Republican senators in an extremely awkward spot. I bet there are many who don’t want to have to publicly pick a side between Trump and Mueller.
McConnell said yesterday dismissed this bill as “a solution in search of a problem” and says there’s no sign Trump will fire Mueller. Others point to, well a lot of things but to start, Trump repeatedly bashing the investigation as a witch hunt.
Coons: Trump has already fired the FBI director, forced resignation of attorney general, and put in place an acting AG not confirmed by the Senate.
Coons says Trump firing Mueller would spark a constitutional crisis that threatens the presidency and the rule of law. “We can work together to prevent a crisis."
Senators Chris Coons, Jeff Flake and Cory Booker are once again seeking to bring forward a bill to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller for debate on the Senate floor. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday he will block this.

I have learned so much about the Constitution from my twitter mentions today.

Because Acosta had already won on Fifth Amendment grounds the judge did not take up or resolve this First Amendment question of whether a single reporter could be barred for their views.
That is technically true. The judge did rule no one has an absolute First Amendment right to have access to the White House. BUT he then said when the President invites in some reporters but excludes others the First Amendment comes into play. https://t.co/5UEP2xj2XN
The judge is ordering Acosta’s press pass reinstated because he found a likely violation of Acosta’s Fifth Amendment right to due process.		Acosta/CNN also argued a First Amendment violation of viewpoint or content discrimination. Judge did not end up having to consider this.
Worth noting the judge says the balance of inequities would not have swung in Acosta’s favor had the White House banned him for safety or security reasons.
The White House argued it could ban Acosta after he held up a press conference.		Judge Kelly: “I find the harm to Mr. Acosta in sustaining an ongoing violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights outweighs the government’s interest in orderly, respectful press conferences.”
RT @Cecchini_DC: Outside the courthouse, @Acosta says "Let's go back to work".
Here’s our story, which we’ll be updating. Jim Acosta Will Get His White House Pass Back, Following A Judge's Order		https://t.co/hesU5sKPsj https://t.co/4PU4VCssnX
CNN and Jim Acosta win today but remember this case is not over.		Judge is not ruling Acosta’s first amendment was in fact violated. This is just an injunction.
And here it is! Kelly says plaintiffs have shown likelihood fifth amendment rights were violated, and there is irreparable harm.		Judge Kelly orders the White House to reinstate Jim Acosta’s hard pass.
BIG: Judge Kelly rules Jim Acosta’s first amendment rights overrules the White House’s right to have orderly press conferences.
Judge says CNN has shown irreparable harm will occur. Says even if CNN sent another reporter, that “does not make the harm to Mr Acosta any less real."
We now turn to the question of if Acosta will suffer irreparable harm if he does not get an injunction returning his hard pass.
Kelly also notes the doctored video the White House pointed to, which was sped up to exaggerate Acosta’s hand movement. Judge Kelly, with some understatement, notes this evidence was of questionable accuracy.
This, clearly, is going well for CNN so far. Judge Kelly says the White House’s later written arguments for banning Acosta were belated and “hardly sufficient to satisfy due process."
Judge is explaining that the White House did not provide due process. He describes the process as “so shrouded in mystery that the government could not tell me…. who made the decision."
Judge Kelly says Trump need not ever call on Jim Acosta again, but Acosta is owed due process if his hard pass is going to be revoked.
Judge agrees with the White House that there is no first amendment right to come onto the White House grounds. HOWEVER once they do open up WH grounds to reporters but denies others, first amendment comes into play.
Judge Kelly is referencing a previous case, which he says did set a precedent where a journalist’s fifth amendment right to due process would apply to a case like this.
Judge Kelly notes Sarah Sanders’ first stated reasons for revoking Jim Acosta’s credentials (his “hard pass”) was that he made physical contact with an intern who was going for the mic. Later, in writing, she said it was about his general conduct in hogging the mic.
US District Judge Timothy Kelly starts his oral ruling by recounting that fateful press conference earlier this month. For a full catchup on what happened and the legal arguments, check out Zoe’s story: https://t.co/H2vJ5eFWds
Also Acosta was standing in the security line behind me on the way in and I would describe his mood as “medium” and his suit as “nice."
I’m filling in today for @ZoeTillman who has tiny shoes to fill in that her feet are small but also large shoes to fill in that she is smart. I will try not to screw it up.		So my understanding is the “White House” is a building where the “President” lives.
Hello! I am coming to you this morning US District Court in DC where we soon expect a ruling in the case of CNN reporter Jim Acosta attempting to have his White House credentials reinstated. The White House has argued it has the right to rescind Acosta’s press pass.
But so far, and here’s the tl;dr, the data is pretty clear: work requirements lead to far more people losing health insurance than new people working.		For more info, I went to Arkansas to see how that’s working out: https://t.co/K1DQkJIjou
There are a lot of issues with the Arkansas system, e.g. you can only register online. As you can imagine this is a challenge for poor people in a state with one of the worst internet activity rates in the country.
The ratio is actually a big improvement from earlier this year, when it was closer to the 50-1 range. However the number of people losing health insurance will also keep rising. It’s on pace for over 20,000 by the end of the year.
The results of work requirements in Arkansas so far:		~12,300 people booted off of Medicaid rolls.		~700 people newly reporting work (or volunteering or training)		In other words: 17 people lose health insurance for every one person spurred into working.
New data came out from Arkansas today.		But first an important note: the vast majority of Medicaid recipients either were already working or qualify for an exemption, such as disability. So we’re talking here about a small subsection.
The Trump administration encouraged these work requirements. CMS administrator Seema Verma not only dismissed criticisms that the policy would be used to purge Medicaid rolls, but went so far as to say people making those claims were insulting Medicaid recipients.
The data we have comes from Arkansas, the first state to enact work requirements.		Basically they work like this: able-bodied people who qualify for Medicaid because they live in poverty have to work or volunteer (usually 20 hours per week) or lose health insurance.
The question at the heart of Medicaid work requirements is is the policy goal truly to get people working or is it to purge people from Medicaid rolls to cut costs. 		Well, we can’t read people’s minds but we can read the data. A quick thread.

“You use what leverage you have. This is priority now,” Flake says when asked why he’s taking a stand now.
Flake confirms he will vote against Trump’s judicial picks both in the Judiciary Committee (where he is the swing vote) and on the Senate floor (where he’d need to get one other R onside.)		So Flake can slow down and nominations on his own. Can defeat them with help.
Flake and Democratic co-sponsor Chris Coons, talking to reporters after McConnell blocked the Mueller bill, say "this is the priority now." Flake says Trump firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions shows Mueller is in danger. https://t.co/JVEQJAl9VE
Flake's developed a reputation for delivering fiery denunciations of Trump followed by not backing it up with action. It appears this time, in his last three months as a senator, he plans to back it up.
Republicans still only have a 51 seats until January so Flake voting with Democrats would cause a tie, meaning they have to bring in Mike pence as tiebreaker. Or, any one Republican siding with him would defeat a nominee.
Ok here we go! Flake says he WILL block judicial nominees until his Mueller bill gets a vote!
Here’s our story: Mitch McConnell Just Blocked A Bipartisan Bill To Protect Robert Mueller		https://t.co/JgLFlkXktJ https://t.co/dxfo4DHFxw
“This is not a moment for our national leadership to be weak or irresolute,” says Flake about the need to protect Mueller and investigate Russian interference.		So the question is… will Flake block judicial appointments or otherwise act in retaliation?
The bill would have made it harder for Trump to fire Mueller by requiring officials to have ‘good cause’ to fire the special counsel.		McConnell didn’t say why he was blocking it but has previously argued Trump will not fire Mueller so it is not necessary.
Jeff Flake attempted unanimous consent to bring his Robert Mueller protection bill to the Senate for a vote.		Mitch McConnell blocked it.
By year’s end Congress could take up hot button issues like criminal justice reform and changing Congress’s sexual harassment policies. But Mitch McConnell just said the first items up are Coast Guard funding and nominating Michelle Bowman to the board of the Federal Reserve.

RT @SarahMMimms: Medicaid Expansion Won Big Tuesday And Hundreds Of Thousands Of People Will Now Gain Health Insurance https://t.co/krfCFCQ…
Hundreds of thousands of low-income people are going to gain health care because of these midterms. 		Only two huge non-expansion states remain: Florida and Texas. Had Florida elected Andrew Gillum governor, he might have expanded Medicaid to up to 1.3 million Floridians.
But the impact of last night is more permanent than that. The more states expand Medicaid, especially red and purple states, the more politically impossible it becomes for Republicans to undo it. We’re probably at that point now.
And of course the big takeaway is expansion is here to stay. After Republicans came so close to repealing it with the rest of Obamacare last year, a Democratic House means there’s no immediate threat of repeal.
In Maine there’s been a huge fight to get Medicaid expanded. The tl;dr is governor Paul LePage fought it tooth and nail, and tried to water it down when he couldn’t fight it anymore. He will be replaced by pro-expansion Democrat Janet Mills.
In Kansas the statehouse had actually voted to expand Medicaid but it was vetoed by Republican governor Kris Kobach. Well, Kobach lost yesterday to pro-expansion Democrat Lauren Kelly.
In Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers attacked governor Scott Walker for not taking federal support to expand Medicaid. Evers won, putting expansion on the table there.
Quick thread here on how last night was a huge night for Medicaid expansion. 		First, all three states with ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid — Idaho, Nebraska and Utah — voted yes.

@UCFJAGFAN I’m not making any claims about this particular line (other than that the goal of any advanced democracy should be to make sure waits like this never happen). I’m saying the phenomenon of voter suppression is real and widespread.
A question to people who know more than me: What is the landscape in the US of mandating paid time off for so that workers can go vote? (e.g., laws that employers must offer, say, 2 hours paid time-off on election day.)
@UCFJAGFAN I can’t speak to why you feel a certain way, but voter suppression is mostly a one-party phenomenon because the people being suppressed tend to vote Democrat.
@kempthead They’ll end this threat to democracy and put you behind bars eventually.
@UCFJAGFAN Except in many cases the places that have issues are not random.
I am being totally sincere when I say a responsible Supreme Court would ban this (it is, after all, just a question of resources.) Hours long waits to vote is just flat disenfranchisement.

Ok this is noteworthy. Trump admin would let subsidies for Obamacare plans (thorough coverage, can’t be denied to people with pre-existing conditions) go instead to unregulated plans. This could really destabilize markets if healthy people do this.		https://t.co/52M75nzyEI
Way too soon to say because it depends what (Republican) state governments decide to do with the laxer rules. https://t.co/hUxlPLmgGH
I think it’s fair to see this as the administration giving a sort of green light to the states. The question now becomes what they do with it and what changes they push for.
So this is the general story — the administration is saying it’s going to let more things fly if states want to experiment. e.g., now even if a change means fewer people will be insured, states can do it if they expect it’ll work out in the long run. 		https://t.co/74X1rlenbs
Obviously how the administration interprets this will be huge. And states will have to explain how their plans protect people who are poor or ill.
Previously a waiver would be denied if it made insurance less comprehensive/affordable for any particular group of people. But the Trump admin says it is now going to look at all of the effects on balance, so worse results for some could be justified by better results for others. https://t.co/WKverLoB6C
Well, the administration today is giving a pretty clear bat signal that states will have new flexibility to set up off-individual market plans.		Let’s take a look at, for example, protections for the poor/people with pre-existing conditions.
This is a microcosm if the whole health debate. Republicans want to allow for cheaper plans that cover less, which work for healthy people.		Dems (broadly) push back because these cheaper plans can drive up costs on the regulated market, where sick people can’t be turned away.
The Trump admin is making a big change by considering the *availability* of health insurance coverage vs. actual coverage rates. 		In other words, as long as regulated Obamacare plans are available, states can set up less regulated insurance plans to compete with them. https://t.co/RufinqXckm
First, the admin says waivers must foster more private insurance. That seems to show Bernie Sanders-style policies like a public option or Medicare for All would be rejected. The White House is pushing the other direction. https://t.co/FhFKsAsQcp
Big health care news day. States have to apply for what are called 1332 waivers to design their own health care systems. The Trump administration today gave guidance on what changes it will approve.		Gonna thread a few of the big takeaways here.

“I believe Brett Kavanaugh is a good man,” says Murkowski. “In my view he’s not the right man for the court at this time.”		Key takeaway is she thinks confirming Kavanaugh would damage the people’s trust in the Supreme Court.
MURKOWSKI: “I have been wrestling to really try to know what is fair and what is right. And the truth is that none of this has been fair.”		Says the process wasn’t fair to Kavanaugh but also the institution of the Supreme Court needs to be seen as fair.

This sets up a final vote to nominate Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court tomorrow, unless it has to be pushed back because of a senator's daughter's wedding or cousin's birthday or dog's vet appointment or something.
Cloture PASSES 51-49.		Key no vote: Lisa Murkowski		Key yes vote: Joe Manchin
Manchin is a Democrat but represents the very pro-Trump state of West Virginia. He is the only Democrat to vote yes on this cloture motion.
This doesn't *necessarily* mean he'll vote yes on the nomination but it sure is a good sign. If he does, the Kavanaugh nomination is all but guaranteed to succeed.
Manchin is a YES
Manchin hasn't voted yet.		Collins votes yes on the procedural vote but isn't necessarily a yes on the final vote.		Both of those need to be no votes for Kavanaugh nomination to fall. Even one voting yes should be enough to pass it through
BIG: Lisa Murkowski is a NO on cloture for Kavanaugh. All it takes is one more Republican to potentially sink the nomination. However Jeff Flake votes yes.
I'm going to be inside the Senate chamber where, for no good reason, we are not allowed to bring phones. But I'll duck out to tweet updates for any significant developments.
Susan Collins said she'll vote yes today on cloture but announce her position on Kavanaugh at 3pm.		The 4 unknowns are Collins, Murkowski and (I guess technically) Flake, plus also one Democrat, Joe Manchin.		It takes any two of those four voting yes for Kavanaugh to be confirmed
We're moments away from the big cloture vote on Brett Kavanaugh to begin. To recap:		- this is to close off Debate (ie, kill a Dem filibuster) not the final vote to confirm.		- but if this vote passes it's a very, very good sign that Kavanaugh will be confirmed.

Republican senators say they gave the FBI no limits and they had “all the freedom they need” to interview whoever they want.		This isn’t the entire story. The Senate may not have placed limits, but the FBI followed White House directions that still haven’t been made public.
Senate Whip John Cornyn says a vote against Kavanaugh is a vote in favor of “the shameful intimidation tactics that have been deployed as part of a shameful smear campaign.”
@KDbyProxy 1) Helps re-election. Have heard from other red state dems they’re getting a lot of pro-Kavanaugh feedback. 2) He’s had a ton of chances to come out as a no vote and hasn’t taken them. 3) FBI investigation gives him cover. 4) In this scenario he wouldn’t have to be vote 50.
Mitch McConnell, dismissing Democrat concerns about the FBI investigation, says they are dug in and there’s no changing their minds. “There’s no way anything we did could satisfy Democrats.”

No one seems to care the Judiciary Committee released a letter yesterday attempting to smear Julie Swetnick with second-hand claims she's into group sex.		Several Rs, including Collins and Murkowski, had no comment. A few Dems condemned it but some had never even heard about it.
RT @sdbcraig: Torontonians don't talk about how we have an evangelical Christian church attached to a strip club enough. https://t.co/mL7VO…
In other absolutely insane news, Judiciary Committee Republicans just published a letter that smears one Kavanaugh accuser with a second-hand account of her being into group sex. https://t.co/9D2XXPRLKJ
The last third of this story tells of Fred Trump in his 80s, his kids facing hundreds of millions in estate taxes when he died. So they siphoned his entire empire to themselves.		I don’t know which is more galling, the dodgy methods or the legal loopholes for the ultra-wealthy.
I mean this is just… jesus christ. Donald Trump owed $11 million to his father and would’ve had to pay taxes on it if his dad just forgave the debt. So instead the senior Trump converted the debt into stock and sold the stock back to Donald for peanuts. This is so blatant. https://t.co/Q4ATak4R21
There’s so much in this story but check out the ease with which Donald Trump and his father dodged a $10 million tax bill by undervaluing their properties to a comical degree. The IRS barely batted an eye. https://t.co/SN4jbNNnWU
To state the obvious, shouldn’t the system prevent things like this from happening? I faced tougher standards when I bought a car from my parents for two grand. https://t.co/jk3D9NOVtL
Whoa, the Times, who looked at over 100,000 pages of financial docs, accuses Trump of “outright fraud” in dodging taxes from his parents wealth. 		https://t.co/d0YlFQf9Pm https://t.co/Bfpr2uHa2T
Asked if Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (the two most likely swing votes) are consulting together on the Kavanaugh decision, Murkowski says "it's good to share notes."
@daveweigel Unfortunately the best person for this type of dystopian speculative fiction is Margaret Atwood and they'll never get her because she's Canadian.
@evaholland Well that was a hell of a flashback just now.
I looked away for a half hour and entirely missed share your bar fight story twitter, and now I have to catch up through ironic reaction to share your barfight story twitter.
In other words, the FBI can look into the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh but they can't pursue whether he was lying under oath about his drinking. https://t.co/Djee6FXs1D
That they went to a reggae show is by far the most incriminating part of this story. https://t.co/a6vi2D8ss6
I even asked Feinstein herself if she was under investigation and she seemed mystified by the whole thing.
Here's a weird one. Over the weekend Sen. Tom Cotton said there is an investigation into Dianne Feinstein's handling of the secret Kavanaugh letter.		I have asked a bunch of senators about that today, Democrat and Republican, and no one has any idea what he's talking about.
Just saw a crowd of young people outside the Capitol freak out with excitement upon seeing Bernie Sanders. They took selfies with him and he left. One moment later they freaked out for, and took selfies with, Ted Cruz.		I am very confused.
Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is very happy with the Canada-US trade deal because it opens up the Canadian dairy market (a bit) to American competition. Maybe worrying to Canadian protectionists, she calls it "a start."
Mitch McConnell said there will be a Kavanaugh vote later this week. That means they'll be voting right after the FBI investigation completes. https://t.co/nD3m4qy543
Reporter asks Trump if he can say what the compromising information he has on Democratic Senators is. Trump says nah. “I think I’ll safe it for a book like everyone else."
The question of Kavanaugh lying under oath about his drinking is pretty big. He claimed he never in his life got blackout drunk, or drunk enough that he couldn’t remember what happened the previous evening. If that’s shown to be false, will it matter?
Asked if it would be disqualifying if Kavanaugh lied about his drinking, Trump says “I don’t think he did!”		Then Trump says he’s never had a beer in his life. “Can you imagine what a mess I’d be if I did?"
So Trump just went on about having seen some unnamed Democratic Senator in compromising situations and seemed to be threatening to reveal it if this person keeps going after Kavanaugh.
@StevenTDennis Yup.
@evaholland Whaaaaaaaat!!!! Evaaaaaaa!!!!
I retweeted this yesterday and want to redo with proper credit to photographer Brendan Smialowski. You can find him at @b_smialowski https://t.co/Yn5zHJ4ijH
This is significant: Flake says the FBI investigation will be limited to *credible allegations.* Says it's up to FBI if that includes Ramirez and Swetnick allegations on top of Ford's.
A very popular Jeff Flake says he's a conservative and he hopes to be able to nominate Brett Kavanaugh, but there needs to be a more thorough vetting first. https://t.co/ZlmJxBDS3u
@kateirby Stop doxxing us.
RT @SarahMMimms: Republicans Have Agreed To An FBI Investigation Of The Sexual Assault Allegations Against Brett Kavanaugh https://t.co/xIq…
The terms will be key. Will the FBI interview Mark Judge? Will they look into the Ramirez allegations? The Swetnick allegations?
To expand on the "up to" one week, what Flake was calling for was to delay the confirmation vote by one week during which time the FBI would do an investigation. In theory, the FBI could decide to conclude before the full week.
Jeff Flake's stand is successful. This is a risk Mitch McConnell did not want to take as the FBI could dig up incriminating evidence against Kavanaugh.
NEW: Senate Whip John Cornyn confirms there WILL be a supplemental FBI investigation for up to one week.
A deal has been reached and a statement is coming soon, says Senator John Kennedy exiting the meeting. He of course doesn't say what it is.
As negotiations in Mitch McConnell's office continue, my guess is within an hour they announce a one-week FBI investigation.		It's a significant risk for Kavanaugh - you never know what the FBI could dredge up. But what choice do him/McConnell/Trump have?
RT @chrisgeidner: Here's @pdmcleod on what went down this morning: After A Delay And Drama The Senate Judiciary Committee Has Voted In Favo…
And there it is! If Murkowski is serious about this her and Flake have the power to make this happen. McConnell/Trump will have little choice but to call in the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh.		https://t.co/FTFVOW6y0N
Ok so to sum up: Flake wants to delay the final Kavanaugh vote until after the FBI investigates (max one week). He has a *lot* of leverage to make this happen, though technically it's not guaranteed.
@StevenTDennis Grassley quickly adjourns. “What?” declares a surprised Dianne Feinstein.
@StevenTDennis Looks like there will be no formal motion, Flake is just declaring his stance. “This country is being ripped apart here, and we’ve got to ensure we do due diligence,” he says. 		Says he’ll ask the White House to open the FBI investigation.
@StevenTDennis Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar basically dares McConnell to now steam forward without an FBI investigation when there are a few key Republicans who still haven’t said how they’ll vote.
@StevenTDennis While this is true, Flake can’t force the investigation himself. He only needs one more Republican to join with him to wield enough leverage to demand this. That should be doable.
@StevenTDennis Lindsey Graham is arguing against an investigation: “It doesn’t matter what we say here, this’ll be up to Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell."
@StevenTDennis Flake votes aye. It’s done, the Judiciary committee will approve of the Kavanaugh nomination but Flake says he has an agreement on a one-week FBI investigation before a final vote.
@StevenTDennis Flake describes this as an “agreement.” But now there’s total confusion about what’s being voted on, Grassley trying to start the vote over Dem objections.
@StevenTDennis Flake WILL vote to move the nomination forward but only on that condition.
@StevenTDennis BREAKING: Flake is calling for a one-week delay for a floor vote so that the FBI can do an investigation.
@StevenTDennis Flake has returned. He’s going to speak.
@StevenTDennis We’re back! Grassley says there is a motion before the committee.
@StevenTDennis I realize this body language, facial expression, whose talking to whom stuff may seem silly but it’s exactly how we learned Obamacare repeal was going down.
@StevenTDennis Aaand Flake and Grassley just went into another room together (couldn’t see if Feinstein did too, but seems likely.) Looks like whatever this is is in the final stages of being worked out.
@StevenTDennis Just caught sight of Flake. Him and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein are talking one-on-one.
@StevenTDennis As are Dems. Seems some agreement has been reached!
@StevenTDennis Republican senators flooding back in now.
The Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote on Kavanaugh 10 minutes ago. Currently no sign when that’s going to happen. 		Republicans have clearly hit a roadblock. To quote the @StevenTDennis mantra “When you have the votes, you vote. When you don’t have the votes, you talk."
Ok Grassley just came back into the room for a moment then headed back out. Hard to read his face because his default expression already looks kind of dour. Hardly any senators in the hearing room right now, most are in the back room.
Coons and Feinstein talk as chairman Grassley heads out to the back room.		Wow, we don’t know yet but it’s possible the women yelling at Flake in the elevator just had a massive impact.
Coons is back! Goes right to talk to Feinstein.
Still no sign of Flake, and there’s a bunch of Democrat senators still in the back room (most notably Coons, who Flake initially gestured to come with him.)		We in theory are supposed to vote on Kavanaugh in one minute.
Republicans do not look thrilled, I’ll say that.
Di-Fi and Grassley huddling, several other senators checking their phones. Looks like they’re all waiting on which way Flake comes down.
Am told CNN is reporting Collins and Murkowski, the other potential GOP swing votes, are also here talking with Flake, though I haven’t spotted them from my vantage point into the room.
My God, Flake may actually be on the brink of changing his vote.
*anti-room not end room.		Grassley is not delaying vote, despite Whitehouse saying he’d get unanimous debate to do so.
A bunch of Democrats just came back in. Some Republicans, Cornyn and Ted Cruz I could make out, are talking to Flake.		HUH Whitehouse says “given what’s happening in the end room” the vote needs to be delayed.
Ok I got a glimpse int the back room and there is a massive huddle of Senators with Jeff Flake at the middle. I even heard someone, I think Cornyn, say his name.
Speeches are over, things are still weird as hell. Towards the end every single Democrat, except Blumenthal who was speaking, was outside of the hearing room. Lotta speculation about what’s going down.
Let’s just say it’s been a steady revolving door of Senators going in and out. We have no idea what’s going on. Still no sign of Flake. https://t.co/QG6TR7Di41
Oh hey theoretical-but-in-practice-probably-not-swing-vote Ben Sasse just emerged from the back area where we last saw Flake go. This is all weird.
Lotttttta chatter over on the Democrat side of the bench. I definitely don’t think they flipped Flake or anything so dramatic, but whatever’s going on they sure are chatty.
So the Democratic Senators who left with Flake came back in after we saw a glimpse of them huddling just outside the door. Flake has not re-entered the hearing room.
Dems could be making a last-minute pitch to flip Flake to a no vote. Which, if so… good luck with that.
Coons, Klobuchar and Leahy went out with/after Flake. Not sure if they’re talking or what’s going on.
Grassley skipped right over Flake to the next Republican, Mike Crapo who looked confused and asked Flake if he wanted to talk. Flake held up his hand and shook his head no, then got up and left.
Ok this is weird. Every senator on Judiciary Committee is giving closing statements of sorts, but Jeff Flake was just skipped over and now he’s walking out of the hearing room. So he’s just going to say nothing about why he decided to support Kavanaugh?
Can I put on my Canadian toque for one moment and say that an openly partisan Supreme Court, where the spoils of elections are to fill red or blue seats, is one of the very most perverted and fucked up aspects of the American system.		Thank you. And sorry.
“I don’t believe ‘boof’ is flatulance and I don’t believe ‘the devil’s triangle’ is a drinking game,” says Sheldon Whitehouse, refuting Kavanaugh’s explanations of yearbook posts.
…huh…. Lindsey Graham just said if he becomes Judiciary Committee chairman next year “I’m going to remember this.”
Graham says he feels sorry for Christine Blasey Ford and he believes something happened to her sometime somewhere, but it wasn’t by Kavanaugh.		Says it’s not in keeping with rule of law to expect someone to prove they didn’t commit a crime when the place and date aren’t known.
Graham says things are so pitched this time because “the middle seat,” in other words the swing seat on the Supreme Court, is up for grabs. “Gorsuch was an even swap for Scalia” but this seat is high stakes, says Graham.
Lindsey Graham: “I know I’m a single white male from South Carolina and I’ve been told I should shut up, but I’m going to not shut up if that’s ok."
Women are standing in silent protest at the back of the Judiciary Committee room. They're now being led out by security. https://t.co/TSC8S8VOLW
It looks like the timeline will be:		1:30pm today — Judiciary Committee votes favorably on Kavanaugh		Saturday — Cloture motion filed		Monday — Cloture vote 		[Up to 30 hours of debate]		(Probably) Tuesday — Final Senate vote on Kavanaugh.
Democrats are walking out of the committee room in protest as Grassley talks.
Democrats are angry about the procedure. “This is totally ridiculous. What a railroad job,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono. 		Republicans pass a motion to vote on Brett Kavanaugh at 1:30
The Democratic motion to subpoena Mark Judge is defeated on a party line 11-10 vote.
Here are the 11 Republican senators expected to move the Kavanaugh nomination forward. https://t.co/I7PZ0ywNC9
Democrats making a last-ditch effort to subpoena Mark Judge, the other man Christina Blasey Ford claimed was in the room when Kavanaugh assaulted her. (Republicans will defeat this motion)
Chuck Grassley kicks off today’s Senate Judiciary Committee vote. With Jeff Flake on board, Republicans are expected to report favorably on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination by 11-10 over Democrat opposition.
There's a good chance this will be the official position of 52 or so senators by the time the Kavanaugh vote comes around.
It's wild how many people right now are doing mental gymnastics to get to a position of 'I believe both witnesses, despite them saying completely opposite things.' https://t.co/HQe2FE8Dlf
SOME NEWS: Mitch McConnell confirms "We're going to vote in the morning." But when asked "do you have the votes?" he kept walking out of the Capitol building silently.
RT @juliegraceb: Sen. Graham says the vote is expected to move forward in committee tomorrow.
RT @chrisgeidner: From @pdmcleod and me —&gt; 	What's Next For Brett Kavanaugh's #SCOTUS Nomination https://t.co/aMRJnE92Q5
Doesn't sound like Republicans for sure have the votes. Asked if the moderates were on board, Whip John Cornyn said "We're working through those issues."
Is the Judiciary Committee going to vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow? Chairman Chuck Grassley just said "We're meeting at 9:30" over and over to every reporter question, but wouldn't say if they will vote.
RT @alexanderbolton: Sen. Joe Manchin after meeting with fellow moderates Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake said no one appeared…
It's like a new pope. We're outside waiting to see what color smoke comes out
After West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin met with some Republican moderates, now the Republican conference is holding an evening meeting. They're sorting out whether to go forward with this nomination.
I asked Chris Coons if it was a tactical decision by Democrats to not ask any questions about the Ramirez or Swetnick allegations. He responds "We're not that organized."
FYI Kavanaugh just left the room heading out of the building. He walked by reporters without saying anything.
The hearing is over. We’ll have more coverage coming out throughout the day. Thanks to everyone who followed along and didn’t get fed up and block me.
Flake ends up giving a short speech to his colleagues about humility. “In the end there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty coming out of this room today.”
Flake is up to talk! This could be extremely meaningful. Or not! But maybe!
Here’s Ryan Grim, who wrote the first story about *the existence* of a letter he had not seen. We were also investigating but we've said this came from a non-Capitol Hill source.  https://t.co/zoVieJwTfw
I really want to jump up and scream here. Word about the letter’s existence did leak. But no one actually saw the letter until Ford started coming forward.
Republicans and Democrats getting into a long argument about who leaked the letter when THE LETTER NEVER LEAKED.
I don’t know why it’s taken so long for Dems to focus on this. If Kavanaugh says it’s all an orchestrated political smear, is Ford a pawn? 		Closest he’ll answer is: “I don’t know her, but I’ve also said that we bear no ill will towards her.”
Cory Booker with a good question: you’ve said this is all a political hit. Are you saying Ford’s testimony was a political hit?		Kavanaugh says he has no ill will towards her. Won’t say how that squares, but says all allegations should be taken seriously.
CALLED IT. https://t.co/Z0vqJFdpDo https://t.co/BUvbaCfwlC
@em_bee_kay FYI I just read this tweet to her and she chuckled and said “that’s good."
In other news, Alyssa Milano got hassled by security earlier. She just told us she pulled out her clipboard which she forgot had “Believe Women” emblazoned on the back and they thought she was protesting.
Huh… Republicans have moved on right to Sen. Crapo, notably skipping Jeff Flake. Maybe they’re just going out of order, but maybe Flake isn’t going to ask anything.
So if Sasse is going to vote for Kavanaugh he’d have to either do it despite believing Ford is a victim, or I guess he’d have to argue it’s not clear Kavanaugh was the one who attacked her. Anyway it’s the first window we have into Sasse’s thinking.
!!! Sasse says he thinks Ford “is a victim, I think she went through hell."
Ben Sasse is taking a moment! Notable because he’s seen as maybe, possibly a swing vote. 		He also targets the process, points out Dems didn’t ask about sexual assault allegations when they had the chance (at the time the letter was secret.)
Wow. Orrin Hatch, who was around for Anita Hill and voted for Clarence Thomas, says “This is worse than Clarence Thomas. I didn’t think it could get any worse than that.”
Kavanaugh sits back down and opens by apologizing to Amy Klobuchar for asking about her drinking.
Jeff Flake still not tipping his hand: "We're in the middle of the hearing."		 Lindsey Graham, though, is still mad as hell and not going to take it anymore: "I've had enough of this charade."
Chuck Grassley is again railing against Democrats calling for an FBI investigation. He says the FBI do not reach conclusions in a background check, and has cited former committee chair Joe Biden a few times to make that point.		Aaaand we’re on break.
Two Demcoratic senators in a row now Kavenaugh has asked about their drinking. He asked Sheldon Whitehouse what he likes to drink, and whether Amy Klobuchar has ever drank so much she can’t remember the night before.
Interestingly, Democrats have not been asking Kavanaugh about the newer allegations so far. Really hammering on the FBI investigation, which is curious because it’s pretty clearly not going to happen.
For deeper updates, follow our live blog here. We’re updating it rapidly. https://t.co/EgF7osBu3G
You know, just normal Supreme Court confirmation hearing stuff.
Whitehouse asks about the yearbook term “devil’s triangle” which some people have interpreted as an MMF threesome. Kavanaugh says it’s a drinking game. 		Whitehouse asks “how’s it played?” K says it involves three cups of beer and quarters.
I’ll just throw this one out there out of context: “It refers to flatulence. We were 16."
Graham declares any Republican who votes against Kavanaugh is going along with a Democratic scam. Says to Dems: “You want this seat? I hope you never get it.”
Graham scoffing at the idea that Kavanaugh was “Bill Cosby” in high school and then just stopped.
“You’ve got nothing to apologize for,” he tells K. At Dems yells “this is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics.”		Asks K if he was a gang rapist. Says he hopes America sees through sham.		“You wanted a fair process. You came to the wrong town at the wrong time."
We’ll have a longer breakdown of the Aaron Sorkin-esque exchange between Kavanaugh and Durbin just now. But now Lindsey Graham, who is also livid, becomes the first Republican to ask questions.
Dick Durbin dares Kavanaugh to turn to White House Counsel Don McGahn and ask for nomination to be put on hold until FBI investigates. 		Grassley interjects. “Stop the talk. This committee is running this hearing, not the White House, not Don McGahn, not even you as the nominee!"
Kavanaugh is clearly not at all afraid about getting into it with Democratic senators. Either he’s not concerned about how it comes off or he’s too angry to care. Will be interesting to see if any Dems try to goad him.
As Democratic staffers hold up yearbook excerpts, Kavanaugh says the yearbook contained lots of "farce and exaggeration." https://t.co/xXM0X56rFU
@dylanlscott This has gotten quickly testy, with Kavanaugh yelling “no, no, no, no” to keep Leahy from interjecting. He accused Leahy of “mocking” him.
@dylanlscott A back-and-forth that started with Kavanaugh arguing Mark Judge does not need to testify ends with Kavanaugh saying “you’d have to ask him."
@dylanlscott Sen. Leahy asks if Mark Judge should be called to testify. Kavanaugh says he’s already provided sworn testimony. They end up talking over each other arguing about it.
This is from an email with the subject “Reunion” sent to friends from his work email in 2001. h/t to @dylanlscott who tweeted about it yesterday.
Kavanaugh just said under oath he has never been told of something that happened when he was drinking that he didn’t remember.		In this email he writes to friends apologizing for “growing aggressive after blowing still another game of dice (don’t recall)”		https://t.co/YufIkC1Jjd
Asked if someone ever told him something that happened while he was drinking that he didn’t remember. He says no.
“I’ve never blacked out. That is the allegation, that’s wrong."
Someone is inevitably going to mashup all the times Kavanaugh says during this hearing he liked to drink beer.
Kavanaugh: “The Swetnick thing is a joke! It is a farce!”		Feinstein: “Would you like to say more about it?”		Kavanaugh: “No."
Kavanaugh says it’s “an outrage” that he couldn’t show up the next day and clear his name. He’s very worked up.
Feinstein asks why Kavanaugh isn’t asking for an FBI investigation.		Kavanaugh, now back to shouting somewhat, says he wanted to testify the next day. Talking about having to wait 10 days and watch rumors spread.
Rachel Mitchell, the outside attorney, will again be handling questioning for Republicans as Grassley stated yesterday.
Kavanaugh concludes. It was a long, emotional speech. The room feels very uncomfortable. Or maybe it’s just me.
Kavanaugh says that if 36-year-old allegations are able to bring him down the country would be "abandoning the basic principles of fairness and due process."
RT @ddale8: Corrected quote: Kavanaugh says that the boys' repeated yearbook jokes about a girl named Renate was "intended to show affectio…
Kavanaugh said he never had “sexual intercourse or anything close to it” during high school or several years after. Says he was “inwardly proud of it."
Democrats and Republicans both stone faced during Kavanaugh's speech. It's been a roller coaster between rage and tears. https://t.co/iBSC4DH2uF
I don't have a great shot but here are the faces of Republicans listening to Kavanaugh talk. https://t.co/FPoOh6vMOR
Kavanaugh says if the party described by Ford happened on a weekend night his calendar shows “all but definitively” he was not there.		Ford hasn’t said it was a weekend night. She can’t remember what day it was.
Kavanaugh spending a lot of time focusing on his calendar from that summer, arguing it is exculpatory because it shows he was out of town almost every weekend night that summer.
Senators have been mostly still and stone-faced as Kavanaugh talks, even when he broke down crying talking about his daughter proposing they pray for Christine Blasey Ford.
Kavanaugh: “I’m not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person at some place at some time. But I have never done this to anyone…. I am innocent of this charge.”
I expected Kavanaugh to be firm in his statements but did not see this coming. He’s accusing Democrats of being part of a “grotesque” conspiracy to destroy him and his family. This is a deep, deep level of bad blood.
Kavanaugh keeps ratcheting it up: “Your coordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my name and destroy my family will not drive me out.”		“You may defeat me in a final vote but you’ll never get me to quit. Never.”
Man oh man. “This is a circus. The consequences will extend well beyond my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades."
Kavanaugh accuses Dems of holding back on the Ford letter until it was needed to bring him down.		Says the last-minute series of false allegations, “crazy stuff,” was possibly planned in advance. Calls it a “calculated and orchestrated political hit” fueled by anger over Trump
Well, safe to say Kavanaugh is going all in.
“I was not at the party described by Ford. This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” said Kavanaugh.		“You have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy."
Kavanaugh says he welcomes any investigation, says he will be cleared. “Listen to the people I know. Listen to the people who have known me my whole life."
Kavanaugh, speaking forcefully, says he wrote his opening statement himself yesterday. Saying he’s had to wait “10 long days” to testify, during which his name “has been totally and permanently destroyed."
Kavanaugh is sworn in (with cameo by the back of Alyssa Milano's head.) https://t.co/1QVxstyCGJ
To keep this somewhat wieldy, starting a new thread for Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to respond to allegations. Will be 50 minutes each for Democrats and Republicans. He just sat down.
Lindsey Graham is not pleased. 		https://t.co/Ow7EHoBhv8 https://t.co/g4yfe8Jjkq
To my mind the single most important question put to Ford was Chris Coons asking what percentage of certainty she had that it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her.		She said 100%.
"The FBI is going to tell us what?" Says Graham, arguing no further investigation. He said Ford should get help.		"I'm not going to reward them for playing a political game."		Wow, he just said Ford is "just as much a victim as Brett Kavanaugh."		Camera people audibly gasped.
Graham says he believes something happened to Ford but doesn't think her allegations hold up compared to Kavanaugh's statements. Says no one will back up her story and there were gaps in her memory.
Graham on Ford's testimony: "If this is enough, God help any nominee."
Whoa, Lindsey Graham, is pissed off. Still angry at Feinstein and Democrats for how they handled this. Said they are trying to set this up to delay the nomination.		"I don't know who paid for her polygraph but somebody did." Says he feels ambushed.
John Cornyn, the number two Senate Republican, said of Ford "She did just fine" and "I have no reason to find her not credible."
Orrin Hatch on Christine Blasey Ford: "she was an interesting witness. She seemed very self-assured." 		Said he hasn't changed his mind on Kavanaugh because they still need to hear from him.
Ford exits, shaking hands with some Democrats like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker who are by the door on her way out. https://t.co/UiBSzz8BlL
Ford is done. We’re breaking for 45 minutes. People in the crowd yell out “thank you Dr. Ford!"
We are done with the questioning Ford part of this hearing, Kavanaugh is to come next.		I think most people expected Russell to go after Ford’s credibility but she didn’t seem to be trying for that. Or if she was, it sure wasn’t effective.
“I believe history will show you are a true profile in courage,” says Harris. She finishes without asking any questions to Ford.		We’re in the final stretch.
Harris tells Ford “You are not on trial” and “I believe you.” Talks about how well established it is for sexual assault survivors to not report right away. She hasn’t actually asked Ford a question yet, she’s talking why the FBI should have investigated this.
Kamala Harris, who has not looked happy about Mitchell’s questioning, is now up.
Mitchell is now asking about the friend that Ed Whelan theorized was the real sexual assaulter, before deleting his thread and apologizing profusely.		No idea what relevance this random guy has to these proceedings.
Mitchell is again going after Ford for costs. Ford says she understands her lawyers may be working pro bono (one lawyer chimes in to says both are.)		Now she’s asking if Ford got questions in advance. She says no.		I remain baffled by Mitchell’s strategy here.
Jeff Flake, seen as the most likely possible swing Republican, has been inscrutable all day. Sitting there with this concentrating expression on his face. With Republicans not asking questions, it’s hard to get a read on any of them. (Except maybe Lindsey Graham.)
Booker is doing that thing he tends to do in committees where he talks a lot and doesn’t ask many questions.
Sen. Cory Booker asks Ford how her children are doing. 		“They’re doing fairly well, considering. Thank you for asking."
Ford says she provided the now-famous letter containing her allegations against Kavanaugh to Rep. Eshoo and Sen. Feinstein, her lawyers, and no one else. She said she doesn’t know how word of the letter leaked out.
It remains surreal to see Mitchell on the ground level questioning Ford while the 11 male GOP senators sit above silently watching the proceedings.
Mitchell asks if she expects any financial assistance for her polygraph/testimony. Ford says she’s aware of gofundme sites to support her, primarily for her to have a security detail, but she has no idea how she’d collect that yet.
Rachel Mitchell, the lawyer handling GOP questions, asks Ford who paid for her polygraph. She says her lawyers paid for it, doesn’t know if the cost will be passed on to her.
Starting a new thread for the afternoon section of the hearing. Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono kicks off by asking Christine Blasey Ford if she has a political reason for coming forward. Ford says no, she does not. She wanted people to know about Kavanaugh.
RT @Emma_Dumain: A woman just told @LindseyGrahamSC she was raped. He said, as he headed into an elevator, "I'm sorry. Tell the cops."
RT @Emma_Dumain: .@LindseyGrahamSC says he has not yet heard anything from Christine Blasey Ford that would change his mind about Kavanaugh
Senator Chris Coons said three women he knows have reached out to him in the last hour telling stories about things that happened to them. "It is striking how many survivors of sexual assault are watching." https://t.co/B1Me9PxTEC
Half-hour recess. We’ll be back after the break.
The fear of flying line of questioning seems to be resonating with the president's son. https://t.co/4o0gOrerYY
Is Mitchell just trying to run out the clock? It kind of seems like it.
Ford says to chairman Grassley she wasn’t clear what Republicans were initially offering in terms of hearing her story.		“If you had come out to see me I would have happily hosted you."
Republicans on the committee mostly sitting still, showing little. Ben Sasse was beaming sympathetic eyes when Ford was talking about what happened. Lindsey Graham occasionally looks annoyed at Democrats but I’m not a mindreader so take this all with a big grain of salt etc.
She ended up contacting her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, and sent a tip to the Washington Post. 		The Post initially didn’t respond, but she reached out again and they did.
Mitchell asks Ford why she contacted the Washington Post in July.		“I was panicking because I knew the timeline was short for the decision.” 		People were giving her advice, saying she needed a lawyer, but she didn’t understand why.
I *think* Mitchell was trying to get at some inconsistency where Ford initially didn’t want to testify due to her fear of flying, yet she has flown farther away for vacations. But Mitchell never went all-in. And also… what? Ford did end up flying here.
Now she’s asking about Ford’s fear of flying. It’s strange, we keep walking halfway down these paths and then turning around.
Mitchell’s line of questions have been interesting. She keeps seeming to lay the groundwork for an attack on credibility or memory — the music in the party, how she got home, her therapy notes — but she hasn’t gone all in.
Sheldon Whitehouse, a former prosecutor, says Ford has met every criteria of a credible witness: clear memories, consistent with known facts, consistent prior statements, taking a lie detector test, willingness to testify.
Ford says she can’t remember how she got home after she left the party. The GOP questioner shows on a map the walk would have been several miles. Ford had said she wouldn’t have walked. Asked if anyone has come forward now to say they drove her home, she said no.
Here are the maps currently being used in the committee. https://t.co/UJfRt1DljX

Senator Grassley and Republicans head back into the hearing room. They take o questions from reporters. https://t.co/LSyWCIj5WU
We're on break and Republicans were very somber shuffling out of the committee room across the hall to another room where they can huddle.
Asked by Sen. Dick Durbin what percentage certainty she has that she was assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, Ford said “100 per cent."
Here are the map documents the GOP questioner will be asking Ford about. https://t.co/q4XwNIwjxj
The format between the prosecutor and Democrats going back and forth is absurd and jarring. This could easily be alleviated with 10-minute question periods instead of 5.
Asked what she remembers most, Ford says: “Indelible is the uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense."
Mitchell asks about whether it was loud downstairs, if music was playing there. Ford says no. 		She seemed to be angling towards a question about music playing in the bedroom, but her 5 minutes are up so we’re back to the Democrat side.
Ford says Kavanaugh and Mark Judge had clearly been drinking prior to the party as they were very inebriated.
Mitchell, the GOP questioner, asks Ford if she was on any medication at the time. Ford says no. She asks if Ford knew in advance who would be at the gathering. Ford doesn’t recall if she expected Brett Kavanaugh to be there.
Feinstein: “What you’re telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity?”		Ford: “Absolutely not."
She says she decided not co come forward, but that changed when a reporter came to her home and workplace. She started to think her name would come out.
Describing her debate whether to come forward if Kavanaugh would be confirmed anyway, Ford says “I wondered if I was jumping in front of a chain that was headed where it was headed anyway." Thought she would end up “Personally annihilated."
Feinstein asks how her life has been affected by what happened?		She says she’s battled anxiety, claustrophobia, PTSD-like symptoms. To deal with the claustrophobia she has a second front door in her home.
Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, will be serving as the questioner for the Republican side. She tells Ford to feel free to stop her if she feels uncomfortable during a question.
Ford is recounting the difficulty of the decision to come forward to the Washington Post. “I believed that if I came forward my voice would be drowned out"
Senators, both Republican and Democrat, are sitting stone faced listening to Christine Blasey Ford. All you can hear in the room is her voice and the clicking of reporters typing.
She eventually told her husband the story while they were going through couples therapy. She says she tried not to think about it because it caused her trauma and anxiety. But over the years she would think about it.
“For a long time I was too ashamed to tell anyone,” said Ford. She didn’t want to tell her parents she was drinking with boys. She says she convinced herself that since Brett did not rape her she should move on. She told very few people over the years.
Ford says Judge alternated between urging Kavanaugh on and telling him to stop. She thought he might help, but he didn’t. He eventually jumped on the bed, giving her the opportunity to run out of the room. She hid until she heard them leave the room, laughing.
Ford: Kavanaugh groped me and tried to take off my clothes. “I believed he was going to rape me.” I tried to yell for help, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me. “Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They seemed to be having a very good time."
She says she had one beer, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge were visibly drunk. She walked up the stairs alone to go to the bathroom when she was pushed into a bedroom. She was suddenly in there alone with Kavanaugh and Judge. They locked the door.
Christine Blasey Ford is telling her story of the high school summer where she spent the day diving and swimming, and later went to a small gathering with Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, “PJ” and another boy.		“I don’t have all the answers and don’t remember as much as I would like to.”

“This is not a trial of Dr. Ford, it’s a job interview for Brett Kavanaugh,” says Dianne Feinstein. Is he qualified for the highest court in the land?
Grassley says committee staff tried to speak to Kavanaugh’s other two public accusers — Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick — but their lawyers did not make them available.
Committee chairman Chuck Grassley kicks off by re-litigating how we got here. There’s been a lot of confusion and misinformation about this. For a breakdown of the messy way these allegations came to light, you can read our story from last week: https://t.co/j8a48akJyK
And she is here. We’re starting. Will be a day. Ford testifying first, then Kavanaugh. 50 minutes each for Republicans and Democrats to question each witness.
Senators seem to all be here at the Judiciary Committee. Just waiting on Christine Blasey Ford. Should be starting any moment. I’ll try not to inundate everyone but will be tweeting out key moments in the hearing.
Alyssa Milano, a guest of Dianne Feinstein, says she's here to show support for Ford. Says she thinks this will be different than Anita Hill. "I think we're standing in solidarity more than we were in 1991." https://t.co/V3lTERw8dX

I guess it's fittingly perplexing that TWO men have come forward to the Judiciary Committee to take responsibility for assaulting Ford. Even if you believe this is all a big mixup there's at very least one guy trying to claim responsibility for a sexual assault he didn't commit. https://t.co/C6YR1aFRhS
@lyndseyfifield You certainly don't have to believe her claims, but there are ways to criticize them that are at least somewhat tethered to reality.

Republicans Are Aggressively Defending Brett Kavanaugh After A Third Woman Accused Him Of Sexual Misconduct		https://t.co/JnwRY8z3Pj https://t.co/qMb8YuNtTZ
Wow. Trump says women making allegations against him in the past “absolutely” affects how he views the Kavanaugh allegations. “I’ve had a lot of false charges against me… so when I see it I see it differently than from someone sitting at home"
Trump says there is a scenario in which he could withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination. “If I thought he was guilty of something like this, yeah sure.”		He’s now, uh, wondering if George Washington had allegations against him in his past.
Trump says there’s still a chance his mind could be changed by Ford.		Asked if he thinks the three women are liars, he said “I can’t tell you whether or not they’re liars until I hear them."		(Only Ford is actually set to testify right now.)
On Kavanaugh, says “allegations can go the other way, as you know… I could pick a woman and she could have charges made many years ago also, and I would look at the character… We’re giving the women a chance to speak."
Trump is asked “why is it you always seem to side with the accused against the accuser?”		Trump says he wasn’t happy with Roy Moore but would rather have a Republican candidate win.
"A big, fat con,” says Trump, describing Democrats as laughing behind closed doors about how they’ve fooled everyone.
Trump on the Kavanaugh allegations: "This is a big con job."
Judiciary Committee Democrats are now formally calling for Kavanaugh to withdraw his Supreme Court nomination. "The standard of character and fitness for a position on the nation’s highest court must be higher than this."
"I take it very seriously," says Collins.
Senator Collins, one of the big swing votes, says she's reviewing the new allegations against Kavanaugh and they need to be investigated. She says she's been told Judiciary Committee staff have asked to speak to the accuser.
Every senator will have just 5 minutes each to question Ford and then another 5 for Kavanaugh. (Of course Republicans will be using an outside lawyer for their questions)		In other words, Dems will have 50 minutes total to question Christine Blasey Ford and 50 for Kavanaugh.
Republican Senator Bill Cassidy says the new allegations against Kavanaugh are "a tactic to delay." Says the third accuser has been invited to be interviewed by Judiciary Committee staff, but he expects Michael Avanetti will come up with some excuse to say no.
Senator Lindsey Graham's response to new Kavanaugh allegations - heavy focus on the credibility of Michael Avanetti; says he has a hard time believing anyone would keep going to parties where gang rapes occurred; says if Republicans bail on Kavanaugh "we deserve our fate." https://t.co/hvg7F5mjwj
Oh I asked Ted Cruz earlier what's going to happen to his debate with Beta O'Rourke Sunday since he's probably stuck in the Senate all weekend now.		He said he still hopes to make it but if he's stuck here they'll reschedule it.
Looks like this will be another Flake speech about civility and toxic politics in the age of Trump — “We have lit a match, my colleagues. The question is do we realize how close the powder keg is.” — but he is not threatening to delay or derail the nomination.
So far no call from Flake to slow down the nomination or to do anything else differently.
Flake says both Ford and Kavanaugh are owed apologies because they’ve both been smeared. Says of the Anita Hill case: “The past couple weeks makes it clear we didn’t learn much at all.”
Jeff Flake, perhaps the GOP swing vote on the Judiciary Committee, is speaking now on the floor of the Senate calling for both Ford and Kavanaugh to be treated as human beings. “We sometimes feel intent on stripping people of their humanity so we can more easily denigrate them.”

IMO it’s risky to go with the “it’s all a smear campaign” attack when there’s going to be a living, breathing woman telling her side of the story to the Senate in three days.
Mitch McConnell on the Senate floor says Democrats are trying to “destroy” Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations. “Whatever it took, whatever the truth really was, they’re going to do whatever they could” to stop Kavanaugh. Calls it a “shameful smear campaign."
The truth of the matter is every reporter uses the same source. We call 1-800-HOT-TIPS and talk to a wizened old man by the name of Leo. He is a fickle man and sometimes turns reporters against each other for sport. https://t.co/EgUioDiIKF
Kavanaugh has consistently denied the allegations against him but he’s taking a much more aggressive tone in this letter:		"I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out."
In new letter rett Kavanaugh goes harder than he has before on accusers and accusations against him. "These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they are also a	threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country." https://t.co/VzTLrgSzfs

Many people, including in the media, condemn Feinstein for keeping the letter secret but won’t say she should have gone against Ford’s wishes. I wish they’d explain how Feinstein could do one without doing the other.
Q: Should Feinstein have disregarded her wishes and released the letter?		Thune: "Well, no, but I think they could have had some consultation with her. I mean clearly, to me, the timing of this I think is very, very suspect.”		You get the idea.
Thune cont: "Sen. Feinstein could have talked to her about doing that. Don’t you find it a little bit ironic that we’ve had two months of this and all of the sudden at the 11th hour they’re launching an ambush attack?”
Q: But you just condemned the Democrats handling of this. What should they have done differently?		Thune: "I think that if she (Ford) wanted to get the letter out there she should probably have given Sen. Feinstein the authority to do that..."
Q: Given that Ford asked for the letter to be kept secret, what should Sen. Feinstein have done differently?		Thune: "Well, I mean, I think ultimately the letter was made public.”		Q: The woman came forward.		Thune: Well Democrats have had the letter for a long time...
Republicans say Feinstein botched the process. When I ask what she should have done differently given that Ford asked her not to go public, I haven’t gotten a straight answer back.		Take this interaction with Sen. John Thune (direct quotes in quotation, the rest paraphrase):
A few minutes ago the top three Senate Republicans all came out and bashed Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s handling of the Ford/Kavanaugh letter. The thing is, it’s hard to get anyone to say explicitly what she should have done differently.

And that’ll be the final bit of drama for today. Day 4 of Kavanaugh hearings ends without any major fireworks.
“Nixon also called me a rat,” says Dean.		“I tried internally to end the coverup. I didn’t succeed."
Senator John Kennedy to John Dean, the lawyer who turned on Nixon (and served jail time): “You and your co-conspirators hurt my country… You did the right thing, ultimately, but you only did it when you were cornered like a rat.”
Nixon’s former lawyer John Dean says Kavanaugh would expand presidential powers and immunize presidents from liability.		“Under Judge Kavanaugh’s recommendation, if a president shot someone in cold blood on Fifth Avenue that president could not be prosecuted while in office.”
Brett Kavanaugh drinks Budweiser, according to witness Rebecca Taibleson.
At the Kavanaugh hearing Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor of the Parkland, Florida school shooting, is telling her story of that day and it is just so devastating.
Cory Booker is up in the Kavanaugh hearing! Will he start handing out confidential documents to people in the room? Let’s find out!

@RealFacelessMan @RobynUrback I don't understand how anyone could view such an op-ed as not newsworthy. And the massive reaction to it, not to mention the reaction from the president, just underscores how newsworthy it was.
So Cory Booker made a huge show of demanding documents, Republicans say they released them. Was it all for show? Fwiw Senate Whip John Cornyn says it was a miscommunication: "Ironically, I don't think Senator Booker knew this, but that document had been vetted and made available"
@RobynUrback So then, in practice, you wouldn't.
@RobynUrback I don't understand. You wouldn't print an op-ed detailing that a faction of staffers in the PMO were actively working to sabotage the elected PM if some elements of that had been published elsewhere?
@ddiamond @Justin_Ling I do love that podcast and they have a great track record of targeting rewatchable movies but this one I just don't get and never did.
@tylerrdawson Please, make the case. I don't see it.
That one scene holds up as iconic tho.
Which is fine! But why are we elevating this movie into the top action pantheon when it does not have the chops.
Upon rewatching, I feel very confident in saying Taken is nothing more than a normal half decent action movie with one great scene.

The usual Republicans who tend to express criticism of Trump are also denouncing his tweet. Susan Collins called it "appalling" while Bob Corker compared the situation to Venezuela.
Senator Lindsey Graham says if Woodward's book is correct and Trump wanted to assassinate Bashar al Assad but Mattis stopped him, then Mattis screwed up. "(Trump) was right. We should have killed the bastard."
"Yes it upsets me. The president's tweet upsets me," says Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski on Trump denouncing DOJ for charging Republican politicians. "I have no idea what he's doing."

When studies show universal health care is much cheaper, this is a big part of why. Bureaucratic haggling is a huge part of the American health system and it comes at a major cost.		And at the end of the day people put up with it because they're just happy to be alive.
So that's just hanging out there. The surgery already cost her $1,300 out of pocket, which luckily she had or she would have had to wait to fix her life-threatening heart condition.		So, the point is this back end stuff is insanely wasteful and expensive, on top of being inhumane
They do, but it doesn't help. There's two bills for her surgery, one for the surgeon and one for the hospital. This charge is on the hospital side, and the surgeon's word can't be applied to it.		The hospital hasn't been getting back to them.
This is clearly a fuckup. Just because it wasn't something she's using indefinitely doesn't mean it wasn't necessary for her HEART SURGERY.		So she fights it and gets the surgeon's office to call her insurer to tell them this.
The surgery was successful. Later, her insurance company tried to charge her for the catheter. They claimed it wasn't covered because, since it was only in her temporarily, that it wasn't coded as medically necessary.
My friend had heart surgery earlier this month. She checked beforehand to make sure it was all covered and in network.		This heart surgery involves the use of a catheter, essentially so the tools don't get crushed by the beating heart.

Mission Impossible III		Pros	- PSH far and away the best series villain and that’s important in these kinds of movies!	- Why isn’t Billy Crudup in more stuff?	- JJ Abrams at his best		Cons	- Plot doesn’t always flow that well	- Needs way more PSH	- JJ Abrams at his best
Rogue Nation		Pros	- Probably the most solidly balanced in terms of pacing/fun/interesting characters/great set pieces.	- “The Syndicate” is a cool name		Cons	- Alec Baldwin’s case for disbanding the IMF was devastatingly convincing and changed how I looked at the whole series
Ghost Protocol		Pros	- The Kremlin! The Burj Khalifa scene! 	- An ultimate rewatchable. 		Cons	- The villains make the Avatar baddie look nuanced and interesting by comparison	- Even by MI standards, the 'give the bad guy what he wants’ strategy here is deeply irresponsible
Fallout		Pros	- They’ve got the formula so fine tuned at this point	- Tom Cruise doing his own stunts really pays off		Cons	- Does anyone — anyone — agree with the moral point of this movie?	- Sounds silly to say about a MI flick but less would’ve been more with the ending
Mission Impossible		Pros	- Opening half hour legitimately excellent	- Has the series’ most iconic image		Cons	- Can we get a Special Edition with the internet stuff taken out?	- The last 20 minutes is what it is and we just have to live with it
Mission Impossible II		Cons	- Where to begin? Much of the movie is terrible.	- Flirty Tom Cruise is unnerving and he should never do that.		Pros	- Second-best villain in the series	- If you lean in it can be a fun rewatch despite being too long	- Screw it, I like the dove

@tomgara It surely wouldn't but when you take away the tax exemptions businesses get for health insurance you can tax it wherever they reallocate that money (depending on how you structure it).

@leonidkruglyak You could always nationalize them.

@MaraRhymesSarah Oh for sure.
The American health care debate isn’t really about value or efficiency — the data is clear and convincing that under universal health care the population gets more care for a cheaper cost — it's about philosophy.
I hear variations of this a lot. It’s true that universal health care systems ration health care (eg, wait times for elective surgeries). But the American system does this too, by pricing out certain people from receiving health care. https://t.co/6t5mY4uAfc
Study is here for those who want to check it out: https://t.co/9U1iP66ZAB
So in conclusion, a LIBERTARIAN THINK TANK just found that Medicare for all:		- Saves money compared to status quo	- Provides far more health care, in particular to the poor	- Could be done without bludgeoning workers with new taxes.
Very tl;dr, when businesses don’t have to pay their employees’ health costs they’re lifted of a huge expense, which leads to a big rise in wages, which leads to more taxible income. https://t.co/IvgHpsUUPA
Ok but of course publicly funded health care is ultimately paid for by taxes so isn’t that a huge expense Not really, says Mercatus  — again, a libertarian think tank! — because it’s offset by removing the massive health costs people pay now.
Where does this money come from? Not from raising taxes, per the study, but from lowering prices paid to health care providers (insurance companies, hospitals, drug manufacturers, etc.) https://t.co/3ZaNs1fGAL
Who does this help the most? People who currently cannot afford health insurance. https://t.co/m6YAYWelC8
Mercatus found that Medicare for all would lead to massive savings which are mostly offset by increased utilization. Translation: people get a lot more health care for the same bill.
$32.6 trillion over a decade sounds like a lot, and is. But it’s actually a few hundred billion less than current projected health care costs.		Mercatus found the two plans cost about the same (just paid for differently, obviously) but what we get is very different under M4A
Let’s talk for a minute about this study from libertarian think tank Mercatus Center. AP headline: "‘Medicare for All’ Would Cost $32.6 Trillion Over 10 Years, Study Says"		While sorta true, this misses that Mercatus is projecting M4A would actually *save billions of dollars* https://t.co/57w9tNeiiZ

Adding E-verify to the bill would drastically lower the chances of the bill passing the Senate. And the chances of the bill passing the Senate currently sit at zero.
They had hoped to vote on the GOP "compromise" bill tomorrow, but that's being delayed. Adding E-verify - mandatory citizenship tests for workers - would be a huge change.
New: Republicans are moving their second immigration bill vote til next week. They're looking at adding e-verify and guest worker provisions.
Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan is pissed at GOP leadership for not pushing the Goodlatte immigration bill. "Imagine if we had one tenth of the intensity on this bill that we had on the tax legislation. We could have probably got this bill over the top."
In closed-door meeting, Republican leadership is trying to win over conservatives on an immigration bill they say doesn't go far enough. Paul Ryan promised them a separate vote on e-verify (mandatory citizenship checks for employees) by end of July.
The first GOP immigration bill was voted down today and it sure looks like the Freedom Caucus is going to kill the second one tomorrow. Last-minute tinkering won't save it, you need "structural, foundational changes" says Rep. Scott Perry.

So if the courts intervene and strike down the indefinite detentions, as they presumably will, the administration can still keep family separation in its back pocket as a Plan B to keep the families detained.
Trump's new position of keeping whole families detained for longer periods, essentially ignoring prior court rulings, means they don't really need to charge the parents anymore. But also, just thinking here, this lets them charge the parents later.
This makes total sense. The zero tolerance policy was purely to separate children and parents to keep them detained. Trump's executive order yesterday basically said "we're ignoring the law" which made this unnecessary. https://t.co/UphHfQZhag

It's possible, since the White House is no longer following the order to release children, that they could be put back into detention with their families. But we really don't know what's going to happen to them.
I asked Nielsen what happens with the children already separated. She said ICE is working to reunify those children and will continue to do that.		Except that's not true. The current policy keeps them separated and does not reunify them by design.

We don’t know all the details yet but it sure seems like this is something that would get struck down. And meanwhile Congress is nowhere near agreeing on a fix.
I don’t understand how a Trump executive order to keep children detained with their parents is legal given there is a 9th circuit court of appeal ruling that they can’t detain kids for long periods of time.
Yes, the Obama administration set up a system to improve compliance that the Trump administration shut down. There is talk in Congress of a middle ground. Some Republicans pointing to ankle monitors as an option. https://t.co/X8eZfAOqOf
These families are ordered to appear for asylum hearings, but many just don't.		This is really the choice - if you want to keep families together are you keeping them together in detention cities or letting them go?
While, again broadly, Democrat proposals would keep families together but, due to past court rulings, you can't keep children detained that long so the whole family would be released after three weeks.
There are at least a half dozen proposals attempting to keep families together. Broadly, the Republican plans keep families together but allow children to be detained indefinitely. Waiting for asylum hearings can take over two years in some cases.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress still very far apart on how to fix the child separation crisis. "This is one of the bigger divides I've ever seen here," says Senator Coons.

Well 1) as long as Trump continues its zero tolerance policy of prosecuting immigrants this law would not stop families from being torn apart. And 2) Sending asylum seekers back to their home country without a hearing is inhumane and against international law. https://t.co/rIhaTXoKEH
Reporter: This started under Jeff Sessions		“That’s actually not true,” says Secretary Nielsen, saying something that is actually not true. 		Family separation did happen under certain grounds under past presidents. The spike, caused by Trump’s zero tolerance policy, is new.
I would like a White House reporter to ask Nielsen specifically how Congress can end child separation when parents are prosecuted, as all of them are. Am very, very curious to hear her answer.
Nielsen asks that when reporters write stories about children being taken from their parents they consider “the sacrifice and commitment to this country” of ICE officers.
Both Democrats and Republicans have bills in Congress that purport to fix the situation. But neither do, because Congress can’t do anything if immigrant parents are sent into the criminal justice system. This is on the executive branch.
Homeland Security secretary Nielsen says only Congress can stop children from being ripped from their families.		The truth is the exact opposite. Congress is powerless to stop this as long as Trump White House pursues zero tolerance policy. Only Trump can stop it.

It also gives ICE sweeping new powers to detain people and brings in sweeping new grounds to reject asylum seekers. If the Trump administration doesn’t support this, what on earth would they support?
It’s basically the Goodlatte bill, the conservative wish-list, but with e-verify (mandatory citizenship checks) taken out and more leniency for Dreamers added in. It’s a very conservative bill.
If Trump wants what he says he wants I don’t see why he’d oppose the compromise bill. It:		- Cuts legal immigration (“chain migration”)	- builds the wall	- kills diversity lottery	- creates a merit-based imm. program	- Very stingy citizenship path for DREAMers

New Republican Immigration Bill Would Give Citizenship to DREAMers While Funding Trump’s Wall		https://t.co/Hjl2C3OHNJ https://t.co/GWyk5rZ02G
- Eliminates the diversity visa lottery and realocates those 55,000 visas per year to a merit-based program		- Creates this merit-based system, for about 80,000 people per year. You get prioritization points for education, english proficiency, military service, employment.
- If a child is coming to America on a Special Immigrant Juvenile visa to be reunified with only one parent, rather than both parents, it must now be proved that they cannot reunify with both parents due to abuse, neglect or abandonment.
- Authorizes border wall, approves Trump’s $25 billion request		- Raises the bar for people seeking asylum to a higher burden of proof		- Gives ICE more authority to keep “dangerous criminal aliens” detained
Ok here are some other things the House Republican immigration bill would do. 		- 6-year path to citizenship for DREAMers	- They must have been under the age of 16 at the time they entered America. Other bills were more lenient, saying they must have been under the age of 18.

Canada has been trying to get America to agree to change the Safe Third Country agreement so that it can stem the tide of migrants from the US moving north. This bill, unsurprisingly, does not help Canada out with that.
To be clear, I’m not talking about turning down the asylum claim after studying it, which can already be done. The refugee doesn’t even get to make an asylum claim.
Now I’m not a lawyer so I could be interpreting this wrong. But basically this would mean the Homeland Security Secretary would have very broad authority to reject asylum claims and boot people back to most countries in the world.
Right now the US can only deny asylum claims if they have a Safe Third Party Agreement with the country they’re coming from. Under this bill, no deal is necessary. It applies to any country in the world.
The bill would do two things. 1) Transfer this power from the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security. 2) Give that Secretary much broader power...
Basically if you’re a refugee and you flee to a safe third country (let’s say Canada) then America, the Attorney General can deny your asylum claim and kick you back to Canada because it’s safe, even if your home country isn’t...
…I wanted to highlight something weird I just came across. The bill would change the Safe Third Countries agreement. This is in particular a hot button issue with Canada right now because of migrants heading north...
Ok so the Republican immigration bill is out and it’s 300 pages long. It provides $23.4 billion for border wall funding, gives ICE more power, tightens rules on asylum seekers, eliminates the visa lottery program. Will get into all of that later, but for now...

@channay Well, alternating overstatement and understatement.
Incredible understatement by Senator Barrasso praising Trump for the North Korea deal just now. "They've reached an agreement to give up their nuclear weapons. Still working out the details there."
One thing Azar has categorically refused is centrally negotiating Medicare drug deals, using the government's bulk purchasing power to bring down prices. This is what basically every other western country does.
“It’s on the table. I’ve looked at it. I don’t think it would be effective, to be very honest,” says Secretary Azar.		He says since Drug companies make most of their money in US, they would just pull out of other countries rather than drop American rates.
Kaine proposes to set up a best price system where the Health Secretary can order drug companies to charge American customers no more than they’re charging, say, British people for the same drug. Americans are regularly charged way higher prices.
The Trump administration has heavily blamed “foreign freeloader” countries relying on American R&amp;D for high drug prices. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine just mocked this as the “blame Canada” strategy.
For example, Azar talks about doing away with the rebate system that allows drug companies to manipulate list prices, which can enrich middle men and burden customers. This would be a big change but there’s no timeline on it happening.
Health secretary Alex Azar, appearing before a Senate committee, gives no timeline for enacting Trump’s prescription drug plans. This is significant because there are skeptics that the more ambitious proposals will actually get done.

Also just seconds ago I asked key Freedom Caucus member Raul Labrador if he's ok with a deal that has no e-verify and he said probably not. So no one knows what's going on.

- No e-verify, the controversial proposal to test that people are legal citizens before they can be employed. If true, this is a big concession from Freedom Caucus who want this badly. 		- Plus there's border security/wall funding of course.
- DREAMers can enroll in the military to get citizenship faster than 8 years.		- These Visa spots will not be new. Will come from "combining" other Visa programs (sounds like they'll take them from the diversity Visa program but this is not confirmed)...

But many Republicans continue to insist they can reach with a single-party immigration bill that becomes law rather than a bipartisan one. This bill would have to be supported by both the Freedom Caucus and 10 Senate Democrats. So... good luck.
At both a closed-door meeting and to reporters today Ryan promoted Trump’s “four pillar” plan. This plan got the fewest votes of any proposal in the Senate. It couldn’t get to 50, let alone 60. And it almost certainly can’t get 218 votes in the House.
Ryan keeps saying he won’t put a bill to the floor that can’t become law. But he also says he’s not going to get hung up on what could pass the Senate. (Fun fact: a bill needs to pass the Senate to become law.)
According to Rep. Sessions, everyone is still pushing for what they want, not talking about what they can live with. So we’re a ways away. Meanwhile Paul Ryan’s position is, well, incomprehensible.
They’re still talking and drafting legislation. But Republicans are split on how to give DACA kids citizenship, how many qualify, e-verify, diversity Visa lottery, and broader immigration reform. Other than that things are going great.
Here’s a quick recap of where Republicans are at in their immigration impasse. 		First, they’ve bought a bit more time as moderates agree not to push the discharge petition forward just yet. Looks like they’ll wait til early next week.
RT @MEPFuller: Paul Ryan: I only want to pass an immigration bill that can become law.		Also Paul Ryan: I can’t worry about what the Senate…
This would be big. Rep. Michael McCaul said moderates made it "loud and clear" that they will not push the discharge petition through for now as talks continue.
While what to do with DACA kids is obviously a huge issue, another big division is how many people would qualify. 700,000? 1.8 million? The higher the number, the more concessions the Freedom Caucus wants elsewhere.
If you're a GOP moderate pushing for an immigration bill, I don't know why you don't push the discharge petition through today. Everyone's already resigned themselves to it happening. Might as well crank the pressure up a bit.
Republicans have the discharge petition - which would force a series of immigration votes and let Democrats into the game - hanging over their heads. It just needs three more signatures to activate. Could happen later today.

@RobynUrback I don't doubt your research here. But if voters didn't sometimes choose between options that sucked they'd go some long stretches without voting.
@RobynUrback I'm anti-endorsement but I'm going to read the damn thing I should at least get something to chew on. I just don't buy this is a unique election where it's impossible to take a position for pundits that see it as their job to do so.
@Jeff_Wheeldon @RobynUrback @OntarioGreens @sunlorrie They matter and in some situations it makes sense to just go with with the individual candidate. But as macro-level advice it makes no sense.
@RobynUrback It's been eye-opening watching this election as a real outsider, seeing how often people fall back on the "they all suck" take and realizing just how unhelpful that is.
@RobynUrback You make a decision. This "they're all just dead even bad" take feels like a cop out. They're two wildly different options! If you're going to do the endorsement thing suck it up and pick one! The complaining may be cathartic but as a reader I get nothing from it.

Both moderates and hardline conservatives say the talks are ongoing and they're making process. Just have some issues to sort out like if DACA kids get citizenship... soo in other words one of the most heated and divisive issues in the country.
- Freedom Caucus says they don't care about the discharge petition and they don't feel like a gun is to their head because a Democrats + GOP moderates bill ultimately goes nowhere.		- In that case, Republicans have til June 24 to reach a deal they can pass on their own.
On the House immigration standoff:		- GOP caucus meeting on it Thursday. Freedom Caucus, moderates and leadership meeting through the week trying to negotiate a Republican bill.		- Discharge petition on the brink. Everyone agrees they've got the votes. Should hit 218 by Friday.

Either the translator misspoke or I missheard, but the actual impact of Canadian counter-tariffs just said in English by minister Freeland is $16.6 billion, not $6.6 billion.
Sounds like Canada is mirroring the American tariffs — 25% and 10% on different products, for the same total amount of value. Takes effect July 1 of this year.
Canada WILL retaliate. Leveling $6.6 billion in tariffs on steel, aluminum and other products.
This is so dramatic. Except my understanding is Trump's (flimsy) national security grounds isn’t that Canada/Mexico/EU are a threat, but that the US needs to preserve its domestic steel industry for cases of emergency.
Trudeau going hard on the supposed national security grounds of these tariffs, saying they’re an affront to the Canadians who died in combat next to American soldiers.
Canada buys more U.S. steel than any other country, and U.S. has $3 billion trade surplus on steel with Canada. “That Canada could be considered a national security threat to the United States is inconceivable” says Trudeau.

@Rafael_Bernal_ Interesting. Could be the case. I guess we’ll know by the end of the week.
Personally I don’t buy the Paul Ryan coup rumors, I think finishes his term. But good luck to McCarthy finding a way to thread the needle so that half his party isn’t livid at him when voting for the next leader comes around.
McCarthy has come out against the discharge petition, just like Paul Ryan. This puts him at odds with his fellow California Republicans pushing hard for an immigration debate. And the Freedom Caucus may very well end up holding this against him in the end anyway.
Which sucks for Paul Ryan but he’s been here a million times. My guess is he burns the Freedom Caucus and the moderates get their immigration votes. But Kevin McCarthy, who wants to take the Speaker job from Ryan, needs the Freedom Caucus to support him.
Meanwhile moderates say if leadership sabotages the discharge petition there will be outrage and it would completely destroy the deal-making process with them. There’s no middle ground here, leadership can only make one side happy.
The conservative Freedom Caucus has made it clear they will blame leadership if the discharge petition succeeds. As to how they retaliate, Jim Jordan says everything is on the table.
Having spent the last few days talking to a lot of Republicans about the discharge petition (which would force a series of immigration votes) my expert analysis is: Paul Ryan is kinda screwed, but Kevin McCarthy is really screwed.
McHenry: “We are a year and a half into the Congress without a series of votes on immigration for lack of a some sweet spot on a bill.”
I asked deputy whip Patrick McHenry how it’s possible to meet in the middle given that those are completely opposite things. He just said “right."
Ryan says he wants to “find where the consensus sweet spot is.” Except the two sides are demanding directly opposite things. One side is demanding a vote on a moderate DACA bill and the other is demanding no vote.
Paul Ryan on the open battle on immigration between moderates and the Freedom Caucus: “We clearly have members at opposite ends of our spectrum who are frustrated with one another... that can happen in a big majority party.”

I’m sorry I’m still not over this. The whole point is supposedly to lower drug prices. They point out other countries successfully doing this and write it up as a bad thing.
This section about other countries using single-payer systems and government intervention to successfully lower drug prices appears in the “What’s the Problem?” section of the report.
There’s an eye-opening part of the Trump drug plan where it notes, disapprovingly, that many other countries use price controls and single-payer health systems to lower drug prices, which “prevents drug companies from charging market rates for their products."
I want to note here that like so much in this plan, the White House isn’t actually doing this. It’s *considering* doing this in the future. https://t.co/n9JMYwbxgq

Blumenthal: “I want to be very clear, we’re not taking people’s guns away for playing violent video games.” 		Asked if their bill can pass, they say a lot of it will come down to a push from President Trump.
Lindsey Graham on guns: “I am tired of going hope and telling people we just can’t do anything.”
Graham says the school shootings have convinced him Congress has to do something. “It makes sense to me to empower our judiciary to do something before it’s too late.”		Challenges colleagues: if you’re not for this what are you for, because can’t do nothing.
Under this proposal, there would be a hearing within 72 hours of guns being seized where the person can defend themselves.		“This is not about losing your gun rights easily,” says Graham. “I am not worried about lawful gun owners, they’ll be fine."
“He did everything other than take an add out in the paper saying ‘I’m going to kill people,’” Lindsey Graham says of the Parkland shooter. “Nobody did anything."
The big question of course is whether Republicans will support such a bill in Congress. The House Freedom Caucus, for example, says these laws impede on second amendment rights.
Blumenthal’s state of Connecticut is one of a half-dozen states in the country that currently have such a law, if you include Florida that voted to enact it yesterday.
In Parkland, plenty of people followed the adage "see something, say something," says Senator Blumenthal. "The problem is no one did anything." https://t.co/oNwQJz1waI
There’s two burdens involved. For the initial order it is probable cause the person could use those weapons for violence.		For a longer, (renewable) 180-day ban, the proponent must show clear and convincing evidence the person poses a danger.
The way it would work is police or a family member can request what’s called an Extreme Risk Protection Order. If granted by a judge, they can seize a person’s guns and ban them from buying any new guns for up to 14 days.
Starting in moments, Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal will unveil a bill to take this a step further — it would enact this law federally instead of encouraging states to do so.
Yesterday Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson introduced a bill to encourage states to adopt ‘red flag’ laws, where police can seize a person’s guns if there is probably cause there’s a danger to themselves or others. 		https://t.co/1jDO8rS8i7

Florida Senators Say Law Enforcement Should Seize Guns From People Who Are Deemed Likely To Be Dangerous		https://t.co/djVPSnCnZX https://t.co/M0WQRCktVD
This bill isn’t quite as bold as it sounds. Really it just incentivizes states, through grants, to pass these so-called ‘red flag’ laws (five states have them so far with Florida soon to be the sixth.)
Rubio says he hasn’t talked to the NRA about this bill and doesn’t know if the Republican caucus would support it, though he says many of his colleagues have said they’re open to the idea.
This would seem to fall in line with Trump’s call to take away people’s guns temporarily if they are deemed a danger. This is, of course, very controversial particularly among Republicans.
Rubio and Nelson argue this measure could have prevented the Parkland shooting since people believed in advance that the killer was dangerous.
Rubio is of course a Republican while Nelson is a Democrat. Nelson says this is merely a step in the right direction, while ultimate solution is “universal background checks and the removal of assault weapons off of our streets.”
Florida senators Rubio and Nelson announce they are introducing legislation to allow courts to seize someone's guns temporarily if there is probable cause they are a danger. https://t.co/zobZnmgAjy

Basically they all seem to be praying someone talks Trump out of the tariffs, or at least exempts Canada and Mexico, and a trade war is averted.
Senator Mike Lee has put forward a bill to rein in some presidential powers (recall Trump is doing this with claims of it being a national security issue) but seems to be no momentum for it.
Republicans overwhelmingly oppose Trump's proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, but in a caucus meeting just now it didn't come up, per Sens. Murkowski and Johnson. No talk of doing something to push back.
A lot of Republican (and Dem) senators in recent days saying Congress has ceded too much power on tariffs to the presidency and it needs to be taken back. But looks like that's fizzling out quickly.

Nunberg’s response to why he’s refusing to abide by the subpoena is “screw that,” which I believe is a legal term though I am not a lawyer and can’t parse it.
Former Trump aide Nunberg claims “I came up with the wall, I came up with the Muslim ban” on live CNN interview.
That whole thing was like when Dave Chappelle’s friend Chip tells the police “I’m sorry officer, I didn’t know I couldn’t do that.”

Democratic whip Dick Durbin on whether Trump will stick to his gun control position this time unlike DACA: "I wouldn't bet the farm on it."
Asked Ted Cruz, who opposes gun control measures, if he's worried about the universal background check bill gaining momentum. He just said "no."
(The NRA opposed Toomey's bill and did not endorse him.)
As for when Trump said he was petrified of the NRA, Toomey says Trump meant that about Congress in general. "If there's one Republican who has demonstrated he's not afraid of the NRA it's me."
Senator Pat Toomey says he's emboldened about the chances for his universal background bill after the meeting with Trump. "It does feel as if the atmosphere has changed."
Orrin Hatch says the universal background check bill "could be something to start with" in debate.
"I don't know how much clearer he could have been," Democratic Senator Klobuchar says of Trump's call for a gun control bill. Says it's different from DACA where Trump kept changing his positions.
GOP Senate whip John Cornyn also doesn't say he'd support the background check expansion after Trump's endorsement, though doesn't rule it out. Says he needs to read the bill again.
Marco Rubio says he would NOT vote for the Manchin-Toomey bill to expand background checks despite the President pushing for it.
Meeting ends with Trump saying “I really believe we’re on the road to something terrific.”		Well that was a hell of a thing.
Feinstein, clearly seeing an opportunity here, tries to nudge Trump to call for an assault rifle ban. Doesn’t work though, he tells them to talk it out.
RT @ryanstruyk: Feinstein's reaction when Trump says she should add assault weapons ban to Manchin-Toomey https://t.co/7dlKxwa1KO
Trump was for years a New York Republican, yet has a fervent populist base that hardliners need to heed. Once elected he was positioned to get a lot done as a moderate GOP president. This appears to be the first time he’s actually trying to do that.
Rep. John Rutherford arguing for doing away with gun-free zones, says he has a concealed-carry license and carries a gun so he can defend those around him who choose not to.
Trump says gun-free zones are the most dangerous places and says he personally supports doing away with them (such as no conceal-carry states). But tells GOP it’ll never get passed so give it up.
Trump: "Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified."
Trump making an optimistic case for getting a bipartisan bill passed. Senator Murphy warns, “I think you underestimate the power of the gun lobby.” 		Trump repeats again that politicians can’t be petrified of the NRA.
Donald Trump is coming out as more aggressive on gun control than most of his party and the confused twitter review is in. https://t.co/p2laI7lqRx
Donald Trump straight up shutting down a GOP proposal to extend conceal-carry laws across state lines. Steve Scalise argues it’ll increase safety, Trump says it’ll never pass so move on.
Trump calling out Republicans, to their faces, for being afraid of the NRA is quite a thing.
Trump showing a lot of interest in raising the legal age of buying certain high-powered guns from 18 to 21. Even pushes back against GOP opposition to the idea.
Manchin and Toomey should just rename their bill “The gun control bill Obama failed to pass” and Trump will do everything to get it through Congress.
Trump again repeats that Obama didn’t push hard enough on gun control. Seems really into the idea of getting a background bill passed that Obama couldn’t.
That was bizarre. Talking about the Background checks bill that failed in Congress under Obama, Trump asks if they didn’t have enough Presidential support and *Democratic* Sen. Joe Manchin said “that was our problem.” 		Obama practically begged Congress to sign that bill.
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy says the reason nothing has happened in the past is gun control lobby has had veto power. If they only do what gun lobby signs off on “this just isn’t worth it, it’s not going to make a difference."
Fix NICS incentivizes reporting to the national background check registry but it does not expand background checks. Proposals to change this system have failed in the Senate in the past.
Trump is going hard on background checks. Wants stuff to be added to Cornyn’s modest Fix NICS bill to make it “much more comprehensive."
Trump again saying Congress doesn’t need to worry about banning bump stocks because White House lawyers are already working on writing them out through regulation.

Another member of Senate leadership, Roy Blunt, says he would be open to upping the age limit for buying certain guns if it's crafted in a way that doesn't prevent someone from buying, say, a .22 hunting rifle.
Senator Jeff Flake says of Trump on gun control "you don't know where he's going to end up." Asked if he expects Trump to have a solid proposal at his meeting with lawmakers tomorrow Flake says "I've heard (there will be) something by the weekend."
It's possible I missed it but I haven't heard Cornyn come out in support of raising age limits before.
Number two Senate Republican John Cornyn says he would support raising legal age range to buy certain guns from 18 to 21, on top of background checks. Wants action this week.
Democrats trying to pressure Mitch McConnell for more than just a vote on the “Fix NICS” background check bill, which he has not actually offered a vote on yet. If Trump plans to back a certain gun control plan, tomorrow’s meeting would be the time to do it.
(It's a big honor.)
Mitch McConnell has immense power to shape the nation's gun laws and with one of two questions he takes weekly from the press a reporter asks "how big an honor is it" that Billy Graham's casket will be in the Capitol.
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy on the background check bill: "Fix NICS is not enough. This unprecedented wave of public support for changing our gun laws is not going to be satisfied by the Fix NICS act."
Murphy and other Democrats increasingly coming out against the Fix NICS bill because they say it goes nowhere near far enough.
Asked about whether Democrats can win if they go hard on gun control, Sen. chris Murphy says "have you been watching the polls? This can win in every single state in every single district."
There are some Parkland students on Capitol Hill today. Two weeks after the shooting at their school it's hard to say whether Congress will pass even a modest background check reform.
The one measure on the table that would impact that is raising the legal age to purchase certain high-powered guns from 18 to 21. Almost every Republican I've talked to so far opposes that, though the President is open to it.
To give you a sense of the scale we're talking here, the plan that is being most discussed for a vote, the "Fix NICS" plan, does some things to beef up the criminal background check registry but doesn't really affect what guns can be bought or sold.
Despite little outward signs of movement on any gun control measure, GOP Senator Jeff Flake says he sees his colleagues' attitudes changing. "It's a new day... it's different this time. I hope."

Insurers offering these plans must “prominently display” that they do not comply with Obamacare rules so people have a heads up that things they’re used to being covered may not be.
These short-term bridge plans don’t need to comply with Obamacare rules so thus can be skimpier and cheaper. Used to be limited to 3-months, so like if you were in between jobs. White House expanding max length of plans to one year.
As is often the breakdown, Republicans say this can bring down prices for people who use these plans, Democrats say allowing healthy people to use a specialized insurance stream can raise prices for everyone else. Both true!

STORY: The Senate Failed To Pass Anything To Fix DACA, Leaving DREAMers In Limbo		https://t.co/zLwqOcWSO9 https://t.co/xSvpdc1pho
Oh Bennet reversed his vote to a no. 		Final tally is White House immigration plan goes down 39-60.		All proposals dead. There is no DACA deal.
That would be 10 Dems *with unanimous Republican support* which they also don’t have.
The White House immigration plan, which significantly curtails family migration, should also fall short of the needed 10 Democrat votes but so far there are four yesses — Bennet, Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin
Final count 54-45 (needed 60) the bipartisan immigration bill fails to move forward. No salvage currently in sight for the 700,000 DREAMers.
Also the two New Mexican Democrats vote against it. Kamala Harris too. 		It’s over, the bipartisan DACA deal does not have enough votes to pass. It’s dead.
Orrin Hatch, a co-sponsor of the original DREAM Act, votes no on this bill, which you could argue is even more conservative because it includes $25 billion in border wall money.
Republican Senator Dean Heller votes no also. Democrats largely standing behind the DACA bill but looks like it will come up short.
Wicker - NO	Moran - NO	Roberts - NO		Republican votes thought to possibly be in play breaking against the bill. Looks on path to fail and there will be no DACA deal.
Marco Rubio, seen as possibly getable, votes no.
No unexpected Republican yes votes yet on the bipartisan immigration bill yet. They’ll need a few to have a chance.
Bashing the bipartisan immigration bill, Tom Cotton calls it the “olly olly oxen free” bill because illegal immigrants are safe to stay in the country. Bill is about to go to a vote.
There was some mixup with the count and it changed last minute. Final tally was 54-45.
The GOP sanctuary cities bill will not move forward after a vote of 55-44 (needed 60). Four Dems supported it — McCaskill, Donnelly, Manchin, Stabenow
Kamala Harris says she hasn't made up her mind yet on whether to vote for the bipartisan immigration bill.

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy says he is currently not a yes vote on the bipartisan immigration bill, though he seemed to leave some wiggle room to being convinced. Any Dem no vote is huge.
Sen. Coons says they won’t know until the bill hits the floor if they have the needed 60 votes, but he’s “optimistic” all 49 Democrats will support it.
This is wild, Lindsey Graham is denouncing Tancredo and Miller as “the most extreme people” sand tells Trump he will fail if he listens to them.
Lindsey Graham says President Trump is “most days pretty good on this.” Says the DHS statement came from “a political hack” (Tom Tancredo’s press secretary). Says two most radical guys, Tancredo and Stephen Miller, are running the White House.
“Let’s not kid ourselves, this is the only bill that has a chance to make it through the United States Senate,” says Sen. King.		Pivotal vote set up for this afternoon.

@MartinPatriquin I’ve got to get back to writing but if you read through the full thread you’ll see that I acknowledge they’re picking apart everything they can, even, oddly, things Brown confirms.
@KenWhyte3 Core allegation was the sexual harassment, not 18 vs 19. Also the date correction ironically undercuts his apartment argument as he moved that July. (He seems to have dropped that claim?) But yes I’m suggesting you’re buying into an obvious Ghomeshi-style discrediting campaign.
@KenWhyte3 But who knows. Maybe it was really the  woman who followed Brown around and threw herself at him. Maybe the Liberals convinced two women to concoct stories to dupe CTV. Maybe Brown’s whole staff goofed up by resigning. Could be. 		But pardon me if I feel less certain than you.
@KenWhyte3 I see a bunch of Brown’s people being offered up mostly anonymously to pick apart the (also anonymous, though known to CTV) women’s accounts. It’s a powerful and well-organized pushback campaign, but doesn’t mean the reporters fucked up the story beyond the date correction.
@KenWhyte3 Assuming you mean with the age corrected, yes I would. Though you’d have to make more room Brown’s friends calling the women liars and Brown saying it’s a Liberal-orchastrated conspiracy.
@KenWhyte3 Meanwhile the smear campaign is in full force. Aiello was falsely accused of being in a romantic relationship with one of the women. And here’s Alise Mills either misreading the CTV story or flat-out lying to attack McGregor https://t.co/jOXu5OyQBN
@KenWhyte3 A friend of his refutes 1) how she got to the party. 2) Whether someone else was briefly in the room with them before leaving them alone. 		Shot to shit indeed.
@KenWhyte3 Yes, it’s a notable mistake and clears him of any allegation of serving booze to someone illegally. Doesn’t impact the taking advantage of a young woman allegation, though. 		As for the “poking holes” part, Brown agrees she was there and they were in the room together...
@KenWhyte3 Given your background, I'm surprised by your view that getting the timeline wrong by a few months a decade ago means the story is "blown to shit" and a politician is definitively telling the truth about accusations of his wrongdoing being a big conspiracy.
A note on the border security provision: it's $25 billion over 10 years. Not a blank cheque, Homeland Security needs to file annual reports and get approval each year from Congress, BUT it would take a super-majority (60 votes) to withhold funding.
Durbin says he'll be pushing left flank of his caucus to support this bill but "we're not there yet, we still have work to do."
Democratic leadership supports the bipartisan plan and is going to be pushing their caucus to support it.
Democratic Whip Dick Durbin: "this is not a slam dunk on our side... there are some painful provisions in here for Democrats."
Sen. Coons says Democrats will take tonight to think it over. "There are some very hard compromises in there."
The trade-off is they get a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers. Again, they will need nearly everyone on board for it to have a chance.
This is a real moment of truth for Democrats. Means voting for 25 billion in border security/wall funding plus zero legal protection for parents of Dreamers.
Need near-unanimous Dem support for the "common sense" immigration bill to pass. Coming out of meeting, many say they do but Sen. McCaskill says "people are upset... a lot of it is hard to swallow."

Lindsey Graham thinks "six or seven" Republicans will support this plan off the bat. That would get them close to the needed 11 (at least) https://t.co/Z03SRrJu9P
Hard to say but seems like this has a shot at getting 49 Democrats/11 Republicans. But even if it does, major questions about Paul Ryan/Donald Trump would allow it to move forward.
But so as to not alienate too many Democrats, the compromise wouldn’t ban parents permanently from citizenship, just say their kids can’t sponsor them. So still potential paths forward.
Basically it hits two of Trump’s four pillars. Pitch to GOP is funding, pitch to Dems is protecting DREAMers. Also many in GOP opposed to parents getting citizenship since they’re seen as the ones who broke the law to begin with.
So a group of senators from the so-called Common Sense Coalition is currently drafting a DACA bill that would:		- Protect 1.8 million DREAMers	- $25 billion for border funding	- DREAMers can’t sponsor their parents (who brought them to US initially)
As immigration debate kicks off, Democratic whip Dick Durbin looks dejected walking in. I asked if the whips were still meeting to talk, he laughed and said no.		Not exactly a great sign.
Senate will vote at 10:30 to (finally) begin the immigration debate.

@IsaacFitzgerald @prmcmenamin Hm. Ok I’ll allow it.
Pictured: The Senate immigration debate kicks off. https://t.co/PqRJwd1QLo
Never underestimate the United States Senate’s ability to get bogged down in the procedural trenches.
Democrats say they’re objecting to moving ahead because McConnell was trying to propose a bill on not DACA but sanctuary cities. Nearly everyone agrees sanctuary cities will not be part of these negotiations.
Yes, this is ultimately just procedural elbowing. But given the extremely tight timeline to get a DACA deal done this week it could mean a lot.
Schumer blocked starting the amendment process because he wants Republicans to put forward the White House proposal first (I guess so it can be defeated first?) while Dems put their plan out.
So currently the Senate is stalled on beginning a debate around immigration because Democrats and Republicans can’t agree what the starting points should be.

@sangerkatz The Obamacare repeal fiasco is always close to my heart.
@paulythegun Agreed. This only works if you can get 20-25 Republicans. I do not know if this would be the case, I just can’t think of anything else that wouldn’t totally alienate Democrats.
Mostly just putting this out there now so that if this happens I can claim to be a genius and if the deal is something totally different I’ll quietly delete these tweets.
I have no idea if this would work but it seems to me to be the only thing that has a chance of getting 60 Senate votes with ~25 Republicans onboard. And if you got that you put a lot of pressure on Paul Ryan and Donald Trump to go along with it.
Democrats can say they struck a deal to save the DREAMers. Republicans can say they got three out of Trump’s four pillars.		The fourth, significantly restricting what family members a citizen can sponsor, is pretty clearly off the table.
The three pillars plan would be:		- citizenship path for 1.8 million DREAMers (no citizenship but temporary visas for DACA parents.)		- Border wall funding		- End the diversity visa lottery and reapply those 50,000 annual spots elsewhere (likely backlog).
I do think a bill that contains just a citizenship path for DREAMers and defense funding could pass the Senate, but with only a handful of GOP votes so it would be doomed in the house.
I’m just spitballing here but I can only see one possible way forward on a DACA deal. I call it my “three pillars” plan because it’s made up of three elements and also because it’s be inherently unstable.

Also some senators giving the impression they're much less close to a deal than others. Key question is: "what can Democrats stomach that wins over enough Republicans?"
How much is that? Who knows. 30ish senators from each side would be ideal. One senator told me he thinks they need at least 20 Rs for it to have a chance. So they're bouncing around proposals trying to get there.
Big part of what the Problem Solver Coalition is trying to do is get a bill not just that will pass (that's relatively easy) but pass with enough Republican votes to put pressure on Paul Ryan.
...is that this bill won't be popular among House Republicans. Even if it could pass the House on a bipartisan vote, Paul Ryan has said he won't bring it forward for a vote (this shields him from the wrath of his Caucus). President might not sign it as well.
They're discussing what we've been calling a narrow deal: pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million DREAMers, border security funding, but not too much else. The catch...
DACA update: the Problem Solver Caucus seems to be close to a deal. They'd be a formidable voting block (20-30 senators) that would seem to have a good shot at pulling in the needed 60 votes to pass a bill.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tells reporters there's no behind-the-scenes deal and DACA will be decided on the Senate floor. "There's no secret plan here to push this any direction."
GOP Senator Susan Collins, who is leading bipartisan talks, says Congress punting DACA would be a huge mistake but she's also heard that's being discussed.
Graham says a deal with citizenship path for 1.8 million DREAMers plus border funding would get a lot of votes, but it's getting derailed by "chain migration" and diversity lottery elements. Basically Republicans pushing for more.
The only thing harder than comprehensive immigration reform is anything smaller, says Lindsey Graham. Seems resigned to short-term DACA extension with no path to citizenship for DREAMers.
@SarahMMimms I think he meant plan BB, like in a stadium after you get more than 26 rows back and they go into double letters.
He doesn't sound happy about it, but Sen. Lindsey Graham just predicted Congress will turn to "plan B" on DACA - a short term extension with some new border security money; no real resolution to the issue.
Every single Republican and Democrat I've talked to has said they hate the idea of a short-term DACA extension that solves nothing, so you can probably mark it down as a lock that it happens.
Still no DACA deal though. More and more speculation they'll punt with a short-term extension.
Good news for people who love shutdown news. Senate whip John Cornyn jokes an "age of Aquarius" has broken out after Senate Dem and GOP leaders met. Hopes a deal could be announced soon.

Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn gives a blunt answer when asked about Democrats saying they can't accept the White House immigration framework: "Then DACA will expire."
Dem whip Dick Durbin, who was hoping for positive signs on a Dreamer deal, looks dismayed. "MS13? No one is defending them. We're talking about DACA and Dreamers for god's sake. It's different worlds."
A single immigrant can sponsor certain immediate family members.
Under the current system a single immigrant can *not* bring in a “seemingly unlimited number of distant relatives” as Trump just said, at least not on their own.
Lindsey Graham told me yesterday the White House framework is not even being discussed in Senate meetings.
Looks like Trump is sticking to the White House plan outlined last week. Thing is there is no way this plan flies with Senate Dems because it cuts immigration levels by 40-50%.

One clear sticking point for Republicans - any bill that grants citizenship to DACA recipients can not end in them being able to sponsor their parents, ie the people who brought them to America.
Emerging from bipartisan DACA meeting, Sen. Lindsey Graham says the White House proposal to cut legal immigration by almost half is not on the table in the Senate.
Sen. Jeff Flake says any immigration plan that cuts immigration levels by a third or half (as the White House plan would) would be bad for the country and bad for the economy.
In other words this would be the most drastic cut to the U.S. immigration system since the 1920s.
The Cato Institute calculates that the White House immigration plan would slash the number of legal immigrants by 44%, or about a half-million people per year. https://t.co/ufuGtZIAV9

Short meeting today, only about a half hour. Talked more about the process than the substance, per multiple senators. Cornyn for Rs and Durbin for Ds will be the lead wranglers.
Emerging from the meeting, Sen. Coons says the focus is on hammering out a "narrow, functional, passable bill." (Ie, likely DACA and the wall, leaving broader immigration issues out)
First big meeting of the bipartisan Senate working group that will try to sort out a DACA deal is taking place now. Let's see how long this sense of optimism and cooperation lasts.

Just saying that if you were *totally hypothetically* an aide to the president hoping to scuttle a DACA deal and blame it all on Congress things are lining up perfectly.
Just speculating here but it's looking likely the Senate will tie itself in knots over the next month to get a DACA deal and succeed, only for the House/White House to toss it away.
There seems to be a loose consensus emerging in the Senate that the way to a bipartisan immigration deal is to streamline it  to just DACA and long-term border funding. Unfortunately, this is exactly what House Republicans will likely reject.

So there you have it. Maybe the shutdown focused some minds.		Note that there is no commitment to a specific DACA bill, more to the process of finding one. Senators starting from blank.

Sen. Thune asked if Democrats caved. "I probably shouldn't say that. I think they took the deal that was offered to them." (Says it was about the same as the deal offered Friday)
Not used to Democrats and Republicans praising each other this much, it's weirding me out.

“It is a good solution, and I will vote for it,” Schumer says of compromise short-term deal with Republicans. So a three-day shutdown in the end.
Depending on the swiftness of the House and White House, the shutdown should be over by end of day today.
Schumer confirms Senate Dems will vote on bill to fund government through February 8th. THE SHUTDOWN IS ENDING
Chuck Schumer says he hasn’t spoken to the president since Friday and the White House sat out of weekend negotiations.
To clarify since someone asked, CHIP would be funded for six years as part of this deal. I didn’t mention it because that was already included in the GOP’s initial offer. https://t.co/7b7hsZSIcP
HOWEVER the huge caveat here is that they did not win a commitment to a vote on a bipartisan DACA bill from House Republicans. We may be in for another shutdown in February as they push for that.
So if they do have a deal, what did Dems win from this three-day shutdown. 1) moved up funding date from Feb 16 to Feb 8 (arguably this gives them more leverage) and won a commitment to a DACA vote in the Senate that the White House can't scuttle
Doesn't answer when someone asks "have you got it?" but he was smiling.

Democrats would get a lot of shit for giving in, but there would be logic to it. They lock in CHIP funding and can still leverage shutdown for a DACA deal February 8th
IF Democrats go along with the Feb 8 funding bill tomorrow with only assurances on DACA from McConnell, it is a cave since the House will clearly block it. BUT it's more a temporary retreat because they can threaten shutdown again in February.
This is a good sign?
Would've been 1am tonight. Instead it'll be noon tomorrow.
Hard to read this, but clearly the two sides are talking and working together somewhat as they just rescheduled the big vote.

I'm a bit skeptical of how unanimous this agreement is considering House Republicans sure are acting like the bill would pass the House if it went to a vote.
How united are House Republicans in refusing to commit to a DACA vote to re-open the government? Rep. Chris Collins says there's overwhelming agreement.		"It is locked in. We're just not going there."

@kate_sheridan Yup, it would require trust. They want a commitment from him.
That said, a wing of the Republican Party would go ballistic over this, and it would require a leap of faith from Democrats, so it's not as simple as it sounds. But it's a possible path forward to avoid catastrophe.
Assuming the bipartisan DACA deal passes the Senate and House (which I'd personally bet it does) that would put a lot of pressure on Trump. It would be directly on him to sign or not sign it into law.
But this does present a way forward. GOP probably will refuse to tie bills together. But if Paul Ryan agrees to a standalone vote on DACA over Trump's objections (which would have good odds of passing) Dems may agree to support a February 8 spending bill.
However, Paul Ryan would not make the same commitment in the House, so he wouldn't go quite as far as McConnell, according to Flake. I think deal probably would've collapsed anyway without an agreement to tie DACA to a must-pass funding bill.
Per Flake, Senate Republicans did commit to put forward a bipartisan DACA bill to a vote (which would likely pass) regardless of whether President Trump supported it. This is a big change for Mitch McConnell.
Flake and several others on both sides say a deal for a spending bill that would've funded the government to February 8 and included CHIP was heavily discussed last night. Dems walked away because GOP wouldn't commit to tie a DACA deal to a must-pass bill. But...
(THREAD) Here's where negotiations are at, according to Republican Senator Jeff Flake, and here's how he thinks a deal will be reached today.
Deal would’ve funded government to February 8 with CHIP and a commitment to tie a DACA deal to this must-pass bill *regardless of whether Trump supported it or not.* Dems say McConnell was open to it but Paul Ryan wouldn’t commit to a House vote. Dems walked away.
Getting from multiple people it was Ryan who killed, at least in large part, a last minute deal. https://t.co/GGHjLb2o7b
Sounds like it was Paul Ryan, via phone, who sunk negotiations. Wouldn't commit the House to tying DACA to a must-pass funding bill.
Piecing this together, sounds like Democrats and Republicans were fine with extending funding to the 8th. Sounds like it fell apart over commitment to get DACA tied to the must-pass bill on the 8th.
Democrats seem to think they were really close to a last-second deal to avoid a shutdown. Republicans not so much. Lankford (R) says Dems withdrew a deal to fund til the 8th.
Joe Manchin says what brought down a last minute deal was the timing. Democrats didn't want to go past next friday.

But let's be honest here things look bad.
Unless a deal is reached any second now, or Democrats majorly cave, looks like this attempt to fund the government will fail. This will almost certainly mean a funding gap but if they pass something by, say, tomorrow morning a full shutdown could still be averted.

@KDbyProxy I’m looking at this from the approach that the majority of people don’t know the details and are up for grabs in a messaging war.
The funding bill on the table goes to February 16. DACA expires March 5. It would be their last chance to use shutdown leverage for a DACA deal, but they would have this last chance.
I’m sure there would be other things at play in a month, but I’m not sure what would be more touchy optics-wise than CHIP. If you’re going to hunker down for a potentially long shutdown you’d think you’d want to not have that hanging over you.
If they supported this funding bill through February 16, wouldn’t they have more leverage in a standoff then because Republicans couldn’t accuse them of stripping insurance from poor children?
McConnell very cleverly kept the Children’s Health Insurance Program kicking around on life support for the past four months so that they could tie it to this bill for maximum leverage. But what if the Dems just took it?
Just thinking out loud here but could it be smarter for the Democrats to just take CHIP now and go to the wall on DACA in February?

There is a bunch of procedural stuff going on right now that principally involves timing and that you will perfectly be fine going to your grave without knowing.
Motion to proceed is at 95-2 in favor. The two no votes so far are notable because they’re Republicans — Rand Paul and Mike Lee. Both likely no votes on the bill itself.
Final vote likely won’t be until tomorrow. Government funding authority expires tomorrow at midnight.
Motion to open up debate/amendments on the spending bill is going to pass easily as Democrats support it. This is procedural, as Dems will try to amend it to a few-day measure to buy some time.
Senate is voting NOW on the one-month spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. It appears doomed.
Schumer is calling for “a very short-term CR.” If Republicans agree, that means we push the deadline back a few days. Schumer hits the tennis ball back to McConnell.
Schumer presents two options: We cut a deal by tomorrow and send it to the president, or we give ourselves a few days to work it out.
Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor appears to be sticking to his guns on voting down a one-month spending bill. If so, no shutdown deal right now.

Unless a large amount of people in the Senate have a very sudden change of mind, the one-month funding bill is doomed. Options left are shutdown or push back deadline by a few days.

That means we're back to all eyes on the Senate, where things are much more tricky because they need to get Democrats on board.
Meadows isn't giving details of Ryan's offer but odds look very good he'll win over enough Freedom Caucus votes to pass the bill through the House.
The offer had to do with military funding. Meadows still has to meet with full Freedom Caucus but says he will recommend voting YES on funding bill. If so this is big. Pressure would now fall on the Senate.
Coming out of big meeting with Paul Ryan, Freedom Caucus chair says Ryan put forward "a few things for our Caucus to consider... we've made real good progress."
RT @acoyne: Personally I would prefer to be spanked with a copy of The Economist, but to each his own I guess.
Meadows just reaffirmed that GOP doesn't have the votes in the House but said Paul Ryan has some offer he's making to win over votes. Wouldn't say what's in the offer
About two hours to go before the House is scheduled to vote. The air is ELECTRIC
Passing a bill through the House was supposed to be the easy part. A shutdown still very possible if they do, but if they can't even do that then they're in real trouble.
Currently Republicans do not have enough votes to pass a spending bill through the House (to say nothing of the Senate) according to Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows.
Q: do you worry the president's actions over the past week will make it easier for Democrats to say it's Republicans' fault if there's a government shutdown?		Senator Jeff Flake: ........................yes.
McConnell told Republican senators to be prepared to stay in DC through the weekend at a lunchtime meeting, according to one senator in the room
Republican whip John Cornyn said yesterday there is no chance of a DACA deal this week, but Democratic whip Dick Durbin isn't taking too much from that. "I think realities are changing by the minute in the Republican caucus."
Per Rounds, passing CHIP on its own would cause Republicans to lose major leverage: "Look, here's the deal. If Republicans simply authorize six years of CHIP that's one less reason for Democrats to work with us on a long-term omnibus solution."
Unlike the press conference last night where House Republicans were aghast about Democrats want children to lose health insurance, some refreshing honesty right now from GOP Senator Mike Rounds on why they are tying the Children's Health Insurance Program to a funding bill...
@MelMcIntire It will be a tailgate built on perseverance.
Congress, if you make me miss the Patriots game I will never forgive you.
brb writing my "CRISIS FORESTALLED" story while canceling all of my weekend plans.
Centrist Democrat Joe Manchin also just said he could support a 3-day(ish) spending bill. Looking increasingly plausible we see Friday's deadline bumped back a few days.
Also Sen. John Thune says there's a lot of appetite for a one or two day deal to push the government shutdown deadline back from Friday. Lindsey Graham says 4-5 days.
So that confirms the "Republicans don't even have 50" belief
Rand Paul is a NO on the CR
Trump confusion aside, Republicans have done a good job of getting their ducks in a row for this standoff. Holding back CHIP until now allows them to frame it as being bout giving children health insurance.
Yesterday: McConnell says let’s hold off til we see what TRUMP wants on DACA.		Today: Trump comes out contradicting Republican plan for CHIP/short-term spending bill.		Republicans are turning on that plan.		Less than 48 hours til government shutdown. https://t.co/kCqdTiBX4h

@StewSays What opinion? Every statement in those tweets was factual, Stew. Calling out politicians for being deceptive isn’t bias, it’s reporting.
There is nothing, not even health insurance for children, that people in Congress won't use as a political football and then stand in front of a mic to blame others for using as a political football.
Of course Republicans chose not to support CHIP so that they can use it to put leverage on Dems now on a public bill ("they care more about illegal aliens than American children" - a thing just said)
Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House and can fund the Children's Health Insurance Program literally any time they want, are holding a press conference to blame Democrats for not funding CHIP. https://t.co/WPdi8ypgRO
I think we've got to start looking pretty hard at the possibility DACA expires in March and 700,000 people lose their status despite everyone in Congress saying they want to prevent that.

Meanwhile, the now-called "gang of six" bipartisan DACA bill seems pretty close to dead even before it's been released. Senate whip Cornyn just said it must be tossed out.
This is actually big. If Trump wants to end DACA he can do it just by being coy. McConnell is saying congress won't pass a bill to his desk and put the pressure on him.
Mitch McConnell says rather than "spinning our wheels" working on a DACA deal Trump won't vote for, they're going to wait for him to say what he wants.
Coming out of a lunch meeting of Republican senators, Sen. Wicker says he thinks zero chance a DACA deal gets done this week. "Just listening in lunch I see no way that anything's going to happen this week."
Graham also accused Kelly of not knowing basic facts about the negotiations or even the existence of the Hurd-Aguilar proposal.
Sen. Lindsey Graham visibly frustrated today on DACA talks. Says Trump's chief of staff John Kelly lectured congress on "sitting around and fiddling." Graham: "I've been doing this a very long time, I haven't been fiddling."
GOP Senator Lisa Murkowski says she supports the bipartisan DACA deal. Some Democrats are arguing the deal has the votes but Republican leadership won't put it to a vote.
Lindsey Graham says he hasn't heard from Trump since his speech earlier today calling for the tolerant Trump to come back. Story on that speech here: https://t.co/lpMdRrmCux
Doesn't sound like DACA talks are chugging along well. Democratic Sen. Menendez says he believes GOP leadership is delaying. GOP Sen. Tillis says big problem is people not getting together to talk to each other.

Here’s a clip of Graham on the dramatic switch between the Tuesday President and the Thursday President. https://t.co/OZ62xmL2LI
Both my twitter and slack have fallen into a black hole of S Club 7 references and man the early 2000s were a silly time.
Graham promises DACA recipients and the American people there will be a deal struck that will solve this problem and allow people to stay.		“Things are going to get better. It’s not going to end this way…. Mr. President, close this deal."
Lindsey Graham openly playing the role of mediator between White House and Democrats. “This has turned into an S-show and we need to get back to being a great country where Democrats and Republicans work together to do something we should’ve done years ago.”
Lindsey Grahm says Trump emphasized “love” in discussing immigration policy in that meeting.
So wow, Booker just accused both Trump and Nielsen right in front of him of being complicit in the rise of white supremacy. He ran out the clock and gave her no time to respond, but Graham gave her a minute to say she shares his concerns and is working to fight hate groups.
“Your silence and your omnesia is complicit,” Booker says to Homeland Security secretary Nielsen.		Says he had “tears of rage” when he heard about the meeting.
Booker says the president’s words “fester, they become poison” and embolden people to hold bigoted and hateful ideas about minorities.
Oh, Lindsey Graham is here. This should be good.		Also Cory Booker has been speechifying for several minutes about the shithouse comments while the DHS secretary sits there awkwardly.
Also the shithole/shithouse count still sits, sadly, at zero. Senators instead using “S-hole” and “S-house” like it’s daytime TV.
DHS secretary Nielsen says what shocked her was the language used by others in the room, not Trump.“Many people in the room were using inappropriate language in front of the president. That’s what struck me."
Durbin going back and forth with DHS sec Nielsen on her opposing a bipartisan DACA/border deal. 		Durbin: “We gave you every penny you asked for.” 		Nielsen: “Sir it’s not the pennies, it’s closing the loopholes.”
Graham pushed back against Trump and reminded the president his own family was an immigrant family, says Durbin.
Nielsen says she remembered Graham giving a strong defense and arguing with Trump. So she remembers the conversations just not the words used.
Durbin: GOP Senator Lindsey Graham argued with Trump, and he repeated “the words which you cannot remember” back at Trump.
Durbin: Do you remember Trump saying “I want more Europeans, why can’t we have more immigrants from Norway?”		Nielsen: She remembers him praising Norway, but it was about moving to merit-based immigration system.
Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin now grilling Nielsen on if she remembers Trump calling countries from Africa shitholes. Nielsen: “I don’t specifically remember how he characterized countries in Africa.”
Then asked if he used vulgar language to refer to certain nations she said: “The president used tough language in general, as did other congressmen in the room, yes sir.”
Full quote on whether Trump used shithole/shithouse to refer to certain countries: “I did not hear that word used, no sir… The conversation was very impassioned. I don’t dispute that the president was using tough language.”
Nielsen disagrees that border walls are outdated technology. “All I can say is walls work.”
Nielsen says she did not hear Trump use the “shithole” countries term.
Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen says Trump’s call for people from Norway not about race but merit. “The people from Norway work very hard.”		Asked if Norway is predominantly white:		“I actually do not know that sir but I imagine that’s the case."

@StevenTDennis From DHS plan to expand from ~650 miles of barrier up to ~1,000. I realize more would be reinforced, but I think people expected vast amounts of barriers built in new terrain.
It took one year from Trump’s goal to drop from a “big,” “high,” “beautiful” border wall to about 300 miles of fencing to be built over 10 years.
