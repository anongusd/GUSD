‚ÄúIt appears that EPA assumed that every glider removed from the market would be replaced by a new heavy-duty truck‚Ä¶this makes no sense.‚Äù - Dr. Belzer, Independent Consultant
‚ÄúEPA assumed that companies that buy trucks are unable to rationally account for fuel economy in their purchase decisions. This is an astounding claim. Fuel is the largest cost of operating a heavy-duty truck...‚Äù -  Dr. Belzer, Independent Consultant
‚Äú‚Ä¶banning gliders could result in a net increase in environmental damage, not $6-16 billion per year in emission reductions.‚Äù - Dr. Belzer, Independent Consultant
‚ÄúEPA estimated the Phase 2 Rule would send $66 billion in U.S. wealth to other countries and counted these wealth transfers as benefits to Americans. This is an elementary violation of accepted practice in benefit-cost analysis.‚Äù - Dr. Belzer, Independent Consultant
‚ÄúOur members who operate glider kits have generally reported better fuel economy rates than those driving newer vehicles.‚Äù - Long of @OOIDA
‚ÄúIn a 2018 survey of owner-operators, 14% of respondents who planned to purchase a commercial motor vehicle in the next several years favored glider kits, while only 12% indicated they would buy an entirely new truck.‚Äù - Long of @OOIDA
‚ÄúGlider kits are appealing to our members because they are at least 25 percent less expensive than new commercial motor vehicles.‚Äù - Long of @OOIDA
‚ÄúOne of the ways small-business truckers can manage their costs while operating at a high level of efficiency is the through the purchase of glider kits.‚Äù - Long of @OOIDA
‚ÄúPurchasing a new truck has become prohibitively expensive for small businesses making it difficult to remain competitive because of excessive federal regulations.‚Äù - Long of @OOIDA
‚ÄúEPA and NHSTA determined that the Phase 2 Rule could potentially have a significant economic impact on small entities.‚Äù ‚Äì Tsang of Congressional Research Service
‚ÄúIn the Proposed Repeal, EPA determined that its previous statutory interpretation of its authority over glider engines, vehicles, and kits was ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù and ‚Äúnot the best reading‚Äù of the CAA.‚Äù - Tsang of Congressional Research Service
‚ÄúEPA stated the petition raises significant questions regarding the EPA‚Äôs authority under the CAA to regulate gliders as well as the soundness of the EPA‚Äôs technical analysis used to support the [Obama era] requirements.‚Äù - Tsang of Congressional Research Service

‚ÄúIt is absolutely clear that there is an ever increasing impact of uncontrollable emission sources on the ability of our states to achieve attainment with the current air quality standards.‚Äù - Stella of Alpine Geophysics
‚ÄúOne of the greatest challenges we face in using these global models is the scaling of the coarse information to match the configuration of our regional models. Each model may have a different temporal, spatial, or chemical composition‚Ä¶‚Äù - Stella of Alpine Geophysics
‚ÄúBecause amounts of ozone measured at ambient air quality monitors cannot be separated into background or anthropogenic origin, this amount needs to be determined using photochemical modeling and source apportionment tools.‚Äù - Stella of Alpine Geophysics
‚ÄúFinding state-level solutions for ozone nonattainment areas are made infinitely more complicated when the area is significantly impacted by international transport of air pollution, as we are in Arizona.‚Äù - Franquist of @ArizonaDEQ
‚ÄúThe EPA has conducted ozone modeling for U.S. background, or what is commonly referred to as international transport, several times over the past 3 yrs. The models cont. to indicate that ozone concentrations are increasing from international sources.‚Äù- Franquist of @ArizonaDEQ
‚ÄúThe San Antonio-New Braunfels MSA has experienced significant improvement in its ozone levels in the last several years, with nearly a 20% decline in design value from 91 parts per billion in 2004 to 73 ppb in 2016.‚Äù - Rath of @ AlamoAreaCOG
‚ÄúWe urge EPA to take advantage of the flexibility in the Clean Air Act to evaluate and actively consider during NAAQS designation the impact of background ozone levels and all foreign transport on a region.‚Äù - Rath of @ AlamoAreaCOG
‚ÄúThe San Antonio-New Braunfels MSA has proven to be a leader when it comes to reducing ozone levels through its numerous public and private initiatives that limit ozone precursor emissions.‚Äù - Rath of @AlamoAreaCOG

FACT: Scientific journals are already moving towards requiring data to be publicly available. Basing EPA regulations on publicly available science would be another step toward more open and honest government.
FACT: The federal government is accountable to the people, and the people deserve access to the crucial data that the federal government is using to justify its decisions. There is no excuse for hiding this data from public view.
FACT: Requiring the EPA to base its decisions on the best available science will better inform the American people and strengthen EPA‚Äôs ability to protect public health.
MYTH: ‚ÄúA lot of the data that EPA uses to protect public health &amp; ensure that we have clean air &amp; clean water relies on data that cannot be publicly released ... It hamstrings the [EPA's] ability ... to do anything, to fulfill its mission‚Äù- UCS rep Kothari https://t.co/x5MhK4TYdN
The bottom line: There are tried &amp; true methods for making scientific data publicly available w/o revealing any personal information.
