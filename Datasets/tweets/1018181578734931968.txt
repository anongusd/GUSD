@SteveHallAuthor The purpose of #COOL is to train people in the knowledge of their freedoms and the interworkings of the #Constitution. We would like to see a significant change in the general view of the government as well as self government.
Education in the United States has clearly lacked legitimate efforts in teaching the #Constitution this is evident due to the number of people who support the elimination of the electoral college #ElectoralCollege @usedgov @POTUS @GOP @DNC @Reclaim1787
If in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the Constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates.  But let there be no change by usurpation... Geo. Washington
The state of the union #SOTU is a responsibility granted to the @POTUS by the #Constitution this is simply what the Constitution says. It should not be a debate. People need to learn what the Constitution actually says.

A newly elected member of Congress was reported to have said  that the three branches of government are the President, the House and the Senate.  In fact, the Congress (House and Senate) are the second branches and the Judiciary is the third branch. #Constitution #Civics #COOL
