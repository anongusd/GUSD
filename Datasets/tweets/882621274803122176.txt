It was a heartfelt loss for our Jaguars, but what a great season!  @Jaguars Your hometown thanks you #Jaguars #newrepublican #Republicans
It’s an exciting time for all @Jaguars fans!  I was in high school when they came to our area, and now they’re so close to playing in the Super Bowl, while I’m in a position to win a congressional run. Dreams can come true for our hometown! Go Guars! #newrepublican #Republican
It is too easy to turn a shutdown into a chance for political gain. That is why I think both sides need to spend less time trying to get on the news to drum up money for re-election and more time doing their jobs. #newrepublican #Republican #Congress
