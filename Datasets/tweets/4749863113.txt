Senator Heller is back at it: avoiding talking to reporters at all costs. #NVDebate https://t.co/9f7JZNstTo
Thanks to everyone who helped put on tonight's #NVDebate ‚Äì @8newsnow, @KTNV, @Univision, @tsitsikifelix, @denisevaldez, and @stevesebelius. And thank you to Senator Heller for a spirited debate.		Most of all, thank you to all the Nevadans who tuned in.

I just stepped off the debate stage. It‚Äôs clearer than ever that Senator Heller has cozied up to President Trump &amp; is out of touch with hardworking Nevadans.		I‚Äôll stand up &amp; fight for you every day as your next Senator &amp; I‚Äôll carry your stories with me to Washington. #NVDebate
Senator Heller didn‚Äôt support Trump until he thought it would help his political career. He said in 2016 he was ‚Äú99 percent‚Äù against Trump. Now, he embraces the President so closely that Trump says they ‚Äúlove each other‚Äù &amp; he has ‚Äúno better friend in Congress.‚Äù #NVDebate
Reminder: Just last week, Senator Heller was a deciding vote to protect the Trump administration‚Äôs expanded junk health insurance plans that don‚Äôt include pre-existing conditions protections. #NVDebate
It‚Äôs simple: Senator Heller is lying about his record of repeatedly opposing, attacking, and failing to stand up for protections for people with pre-existing conditions. #NVDebate https://t.co/W4NxiM08bq
I just asked Senator Heller to explain to Theresa Bohannan, whose son was born with a heart defect and will have a pre-existing condition his entire life, why he supported slashing pre-existing condition protections. #NVDebate https://t.co/VwP5zbklLV

After credible allegations of sexual assault surfaced, Senator Heller dismissed them as a ‚Äúlittle hiccup.‚Äù Then he let down Nevadans and voted to confirm Justice Kavanaugh with ‚Äúno reservations.‚Äù #NVDebate
Justice Kavanaugh has a concerning record on women‚Äôs reproductive rights, health care, consumer protection, and civil rights. But Senator Heller voted to confirm him with ‚Äúno reservations.‚Äù #NVDebate
Gun violence is a growing epidemic in our country. Senator Heller has voted time and time again against:		‚ùå expanding background checks	‚ùå¬†closing the gun show loophole		And our communities are paying the price. #NVDebate

It‚Äôs really very simple. Senator Heller voted for a corporate tax giveaway. Jacky supports middle class tax cuts. #NVDebate
The tax bill Senate Republicans jammed through last year adds nearly $2 *trillion* to the national debt. This is Senator Heller‚Äôs stance on it: ‚¨áÔ∏è#NVDebate https://t.co/1hmx4lHlMy
To pay for the tax breaks for giant corporations in Senator Heller‚Äôs tax bill, GOP leaders now want to cut Medicare and Social Security. That‚Äôs just wrong ‚Äì and we won‚Äôt stand for it. 	https://t.co/AE7c5qxU6Q #NVDebate

Jacky went to the border in June to investigate President Trump‚Äôs heartless family separation policy.		Senator Heller did not, instead choosing to attack Jacky for doing her job. Nevada deserves better. #NVDebate
Senator Heller promised to defend the health care coverage of hundreds of thousands of Nevadans, Medicaid expansion, and pre-existing conditions protections.		Instead, he‚Äôs caved to pressure from his party leaders every. single. time. #NVDebate
El r√©cord del Senador Heller de seguros de salud: decir algo en Nevada, solo para regresar a Washington para hacer lo contrario.

Judge Kavanaugh is a threat to the future of women‚Äôs reproductive freedom, the ACA, consumer protections, campaign finance reform, and our civil rights. I would vote against confirming him to the Supreme Court if I were serving in the Senate. #NVSen	https://t.co/j6c50X0C3Y

I will stand up &amp; fight for Nevada families who risk losing their health coverage.
Republicans will stop at nothing - all so they can give the 1% a tax break. https://t.co/jxnDIKAUd4
Let's not forget: while Trump tweets about personally attacking the media, he's working with the GOP on taking away health care for millions
Instead of providing solutions to improve our health care system, @GOP is creating a health care crisis here in #NV https://t.co/UhvW7UnAxu
GOP's #healthcare plan hasn't changed: millions lose health care, vulnerable Americans lose protections, ultra-wealthy get massive tax cuts
.@SenateGOP postponed this vote but we can't take our eye off the ball. We must keep fighting to protect #healthcare for patients &amp; families
Proud to stand up for #EqualityforAll today as we celebrate the two year anniversary of #MarriageEquality. #LoveIsLove https://t.co/VeRbOuEY3t
Who does #Trumpcare cover? Millionaires looking for a massive tax cut. https://t.co/myp8o2CBzG
By trying to shove their healthcare repeal through w/ 0 input, Republicans are making it clear the only voice they care about is the wealthy https://t.co/oUvi0f2S33
#TrumpCare weakens provisions for #preexisting conditions, leaving people vulnerable to discrimination &amp; putting lives at risk.
#TrumpCare is an assault on women‚Äôs #healthcare and will restrict access to care for millions.
Republicans will stop at nothing to give wealthy a tax cut. This bill insults 1000s of #NV families who rely on #Medicaid.
The @SenateGOP version makes even deeper cuts to #Medicaid - which covers 31,000 in #NV03 alone.
No wonder Nevadans reject #TrumpCare. Senate GOP's bill:	- Guts #Medicaid	- Implements an Age Tax 	- Weakens key protections	- Defunds @PPFA
Happy #FathersDay to my husband Larry and to all the dedicated Dads who bring joy to our lives! https://t.co/B6rP2zsNp7
Even our own Governor is opposed to the @HouseGOP's #healthcare plan. It's time to stop playing games with people's health care. #AgeTax https://t.co/IgJUvbxWOT
