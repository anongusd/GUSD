(6) Budget Comprehensively.		Set rules and targets that apply to all components of the federal budget — including both discretionary and mandatory spending as well as revenues.
(5) Avoid Brinksmanship.		Governing from crisis to crisis with last minute, deadline-driven decisions often produces poor policy. Lawmakers should design process reforms that ensure budget decisions can be considered responsibly with adequate time for review.
(4) Increase Transparency.		Lawmakers and the public alike should have clear and timely information about budget decisions and their impact.
(3) Strengthen Enforcement.		Adding new or strengthening existing enforcement measures would help policymakers stay on the path towards their budget targets.
(2) Set Fiscal Targets.		Requiring Congress and the president to set medium- and long-term fiscal goals, and then report on progress annually, would improve accountability and transparency on our fiscal condition.
(1) Look Long-Term.		Give more visibility to periods past the current 10-year "budget window" to increase attention on our long-term fiscal challenges.

(6) Budget Comprehensively.		Set rules and targets that apply to all components of the federal budget — including both discretionary and mandatory spending as well as revenues.
(5) Avoid Brinksmanship.		Governing from crisis to crisis with last minute, deadline-driven decisions often produces poor policy. Lawmakers should design process reforms that ensure budget decisions can be considered responsibly with adequate time for review.
(4) Increase Transparency.		Lawmakers and the public alike should have clear and timely information about budget decisions and their impact
(3) Strengthen Enforcement.		Adding new or strengthening existing enforcement measures would help policymakers stay on the path towards their budget targets.
(2) Set Fiscal Targets.		Requiring Congress and the president to set medium- and long-term fiscal goals, and then report on progress annually, would improve accountability and transparency on our fiscal condition.
(1) Look Long-Term.		Give more visibility to periods past the current 10-year "budget window" to increase attention on our long-term fiscal challenges.
