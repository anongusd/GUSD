@RiderofWolves Not bad.  An ex-girlfriend messaged me, but my current girlfriend isn't calling.  It's kind of a mess.
@PhilipRucker @1stFanofChicago Mnuchin has a trophy wife who Pence, with "Mother" apparently by his side, conducted the ceremony.  Look at him and her....when I worked retail I had a game, "Daughter or trophy wife." Perfect example.
@nanelvisfan @KeepingitA @LindseyGrahamSC Um, Putin??? President of the United States?
@HuffPost Everyone except Pence watches porn, so we can all criticize Trump.
Can you drink and not have beer breath???
@RiderofWolves Then we need to buy another bottle :)
@RiderofWolves Hold on...I need half of it :)
@Craven7Jessica @tr_williams @TopherSpiro @SenSchumer Yup.  We need to play dirty and hard, like the Republicans...they cheat and we cave.  This BS is over.....elect me President and give me a Democratic Congress and we'll take our MF country back.

@MarieLoerzel Not to the right guy.  My fiancee is attractive, but I could find more attractive women...but she's a wonderful woman.  She's raising an autistic son, supporting her Mom and two other kids.  I want nobody else.  Take care and just believe in yourself.
@The_UnSilent_ The difference between Obama and Trump is so stark. ...a real President and an egotistical idiot....damn, I'm getting worked up.  Guess I'll need to run and kick his, um, large behind.  We are taking our MF country back.
@bjcreigh Crossing your arms is a sign of insecurity, and he does it all the time.  I'm taking his job in 2020 and we're taking our MF country back.  This BS is over...right f...king now.
@dvorakoelling Send him back to Germany.  His Dad immigrated here to avoid the draft in Germany in WW2,  and he evaded the draft with fake "bone spurs."  He's out.  I'm taking his job.  This is over.  We are taking our MF country back.

@yaboyblue357 One of my relatives was supposedly a hit man and there was a front page article on the Chicago Sun Times when he was caught.  My Mom was embarrassed by it so I don't have a copy, but I want to find it and frame it.  It's wild.  What a crazy family.
Friends....this is insane.  The hatred of the Republican party towards the poor is so cruel.  There is more than enough money, especially in the defence budget, to fund food stamps.  Elect me and a Democratic Senate and let's end this BS and take our country back. https://t.co/VxCr0cPs4Y

@EngageJordan_ I have a following on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and am running for President.  Text me at 480 532 3711 if you want me to blog, but only liberal politics.
@Brasilmagic Yup.  Single payer is so much more cost efficient than the mess we have now.  It's actually how small employers offer insurance....they band together for better rates.  When I'm President, we're implementing single payer, like every other developed country.

@stucam7771 @CTO1ChipNagel Voting for me and Kamala Harris.  I just need to get her to realize we're the winning team.
@NBCNews I'm taking the nomination.  @SenKamalaHarris can run with me.  I'm good with being VP or President, although I'd rather be President. We have a lot to fix and she would be great backing me up.
@siano2020 @CTO1ChipNagel He cheated.  His professors have said he never showed up for class.  He paid someone to take tests for him.
So when I'm elected President, we'll fix everything, but I need Def Leppard to do the music at the Inauguration.  If anyone knows their agent, let them know.  We'll have other 80s music so the party might go on for a couple days.

@neeratanden @Utleyjacobite Elect me President and give me a Democratic majority in the House and Senate and we'll pass Universal Health care.  It's far more cost efficient than our current system.  We'll bring accountability back, at least for eight years.

@girlsreallyrule I'm late to the race, but I plan to be the nominee.  We are taking our MF country back.  Count on it.
@SocialPowerOne1 What is it with him making faces?  Between him and Trump, their faces almost overshadow what they're saying.
@SocialPowerOne1 It was a hilarious skit.
@Augustus709 Me.  I'm taking this.
@CallSignSiren How about a lot???
@RiderofWolves I used to, but it's too much time to waste.  I'll watch the last ten minutes of the Super Bowl
@krassenstein It's hilarious.  That landing strip forehead is a joke.  He should just shave it all off
@girlsreallyrule He's getting deported when I'm President.
@CallSignSiren Yup.  My girlfriend will be my wife someday.
@krassenstein Give me two years.  We'll be back in when I'm President.
@kenolin1 @hxernst He's f...king nuts.
@OMGwhredoistart @Lady_Sisyphus22 I totally get it.  Just do your best and reach out to friends or family who support you.
OMG, I'm so disgusted.  Stephen Miller, Mr. gigantic forehead, has blamed left wing judges for that poor girl's death in the concentration camps our Nazi President set up.  I'm firing both of them.
@NumbersMuncher @1lynks14 And he's running the U.S. into bankruptcy.  I'm taking his job to fix our credit.  Vote for me in 2020.

@Getsmart4 I don't know.  When I'm President, we'll get things done, but I need a Democratic House and Senate.  It usually flips at the mid-term, so we need it in 2020.  We'll fix everything in a year if I have both sides of Congress.
@MamaTealRose @girlsreallyrule Yes.  Our system rewards health care company execs millions of dollars...I know...I used to work in compensation.  They get paid for denying care.
@wvjoe911 @idacoll1 I'm getting to the party a little late but I'll either beat both of them or be their running mate.  We're fixing everything and taking our MF country back.  Guaranteed.
@bryanbehar @AussiePunter32 That's why I'm running for President.  We have a horrific President and nobody is stopping him.  I'm going to stop him....RFN.  Sorry, I don't use profanity but the R is for "Right" and the the N is for "Now.'   The other word is the F bomb
@Motorace177 @herprettybones Funny.  My shrink just laughed at all my stories.
@LadyM_07 I am a little silly, but loyal.  She's my soulmate.
@chrissyteigen When I ran movie theatres, we had a contest on the greatest practical joke you ever pulled for a Steve Martin movie.  The winner subscribed to gay magazines in the name of a teacher she hated and put his address as the two houses on either side of his house.  Hilarious.
@politvidchannel @idacoll1 Just more Republican hypocrisy.
@maziehirono @bullfish777 They're the concentration camps of 2018.  When I'm President, this will stop....at least for eight years.

@MingGao26 That's why.  When money is involved, they support anything.

@krassenstein @AussiePunter32 They must have something.  They have cyber on us while we spend tons of money on military equipment we don't need.  As a general rule, if you're Republican, you're unethical and will resort to illegal tactics to stay in power.

@lisastark351 Yeah, and if he did cross the street on foot, a few of the cars may have run the red light and "accidentally" run him over.

@fotofig That's because he doesn't have a heart
@leeleeb50 It's bizarre. It seems like liberals actually put thought in to politics and concern for fellow human beings while conservatives just blindly follow their party members, no matter how horrible they are.
@samstein @swin24 @lachlan That's the way it works. Republicans mess up the economy and then Democrats have to fix it eight years later.

@thomaskaine5 I'm running for President just because I can't f'ing stand him.  I could make a fortune as a screenwriter, but need to get him out of office.
@SaysHummingbird Well, amazing...Trump lied again
@JJMawson @eesnihc @chrisshermanAP No, it's not.  They need to go through the proper process. It seemed like many were running to the fence, but more were just in the background.
@brycetache This is why I'm running for President...it just gets worse and worse.  This will end in 2020.
@chrisshermanAP All this crap wouldn't happen if we just had immigration centers at the border to process requests. Turning it into a war is so, so wrong.
@DaddyDaddymac He has the nerve to say that while we pay for him to go to his resorts and play golf constantly....and enrich him with all the government employees who need to stay there. Damn.
@Alyssa_Milano I love your post, but it doesn't even go far enough...he is going straight to hell.  This Presidency is horrific.

@ShellHasNoName This is tough.  How about "Double B's?"
@MaddieBarry8 Tariffs went out so long ago for a reason. Trump is an idiot who (allegedly) cheated his way through school. He has no clue how to run a country.
@BarbraStreisand He never will.  That's why I'm running against him in 2020. We're taking our country back.

@RawStory @CTO1ChipNagel Well surprise surprise "you stupid b...ch."....a quote from a great 80s movie. Maybe try having a heart.
@EdKrassen Yup. Hate crime is up under Trump. To him it's okay.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Only the first.  They're all over the second....NRA money
Friends...read this. We are all humans sharing a planet. We have different religions that were all made up a few hundred years ago....not a reason to hate one another. This is a great story. https://t.co/2lUDs7JL2O
@ellievan65 @mommamia1217 Only if it's the middle east of South America
@HillaryClinton We all need to vote. Everybody. Democrats need more votes since the Republicans cheat with gerrymandering, voting machine fraud and a bunch other methods. They already have all the rich white voters and still cheat. They can't win any other way.
@realDonaldTrump Paul Ryan needs to go away. Like Donald Trump
@TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump He has. White supremacy has gone up substantially under his Presidency. He encourages it, along with a lot of other bad things. He needs to go and I'm getting him out.

So there's a line in @christinaperri 's song "The Words." It's about a dead woman who is still with her man but she's a ghost. I didn't know this until I read the thread. "Life is a ghost you can't control." Pretty powerful.
@SwampyTrump @randydrsmith @BetoORourke @tedcruz Because Republicans have no ethics
This is how far we've sunk. Vote Trump out in 2020 https://t.co/Vz51YtALYf
If you're married and have kids, please reconsider divorce until they're 18. Take it from me, it's so painful for them. My ex and I divorced when my daughter was 12. She wouldn't even hold my hand at dinner. I cannot do that again.
@ReneeLibby2 Nope. Maybe orange?
If you have not, please find followers in the Middle East. Twitter translates their tweets and you can see they are just like us....if we could just realize they are our friends, not our enemies, we'd be in a much more safe position.

@Education4Libs @MarionMarb No. They do. You can lie with statistics.

@stucam7771 @MsDebbieKingKe1 We're lucky we weren't here when we immigrated.  It's insane that we don't just let people go through the process.  That's what our ancestors did. The double standard by bigots today is so wrong.

@krassenstein Blame Trump. Hate has increased since he freely accepted it. It's more than anti-Semitic. It's all hate against everyone who isn't white and rich. He needs to go ASAP.
@PreetBharara @cynical420 @LouDobbs Republicans are lying idiots. We'll never talk sense into them. We just need to take back Congress and the Presidency an fix everything they've messed up.
@ReneeLibby2 @randydrsmith Those divisions are probably good. Cut off all ties with family who hate what you love. It's hard, but over time it's Xanax for the soul.

@rendabeltzer3 @LindseyGrahamSC @BethicaLoney @realDonaldTrump The division is on both sides but the left rarely resorts to violence while the right goes violent almost every day. The bomber was right wing. We all need to get along and not let our differences end in people dying or getting their lives in jeopardy.
@LindseyGrahamSC We're all humans sharing a planet. Thank you for your post. We need to agree to disagree
@brycetache @exoticgamora I am do darn mad....can we just kick him out now? Isn't there a clause that says if you're the biggest idiot in the world, we can fire you?  OMG...I can't wait to kick his ass in 2020. By the way, the debates will be on HBO. I might use a few curse words :)
@bloomin3pa @Russian81132533 @EdKrassen I'm not a Russian bot. Columbus landed on the Canary Islands on one of his trips. He was not a good guy.

@mannyvu89 @WASBAPPIN Our government is far beyone f..ked up.  We just need to vote all these AHs out ASAP.  This is insane. Republicans, or most anyway, seem to have no concern for human life.  They're lucky they're not treated the way they treat others.
@DearAuntCrabby @GregB72815961 I cannot wait to deport all these AHs.  This has to end.
@brycetache @a7160957 It's the country that shoots down a passenger plane. We did it to Iran and we call them terrorists. It's no surprise we're not too popular in the Middle East.

@UROCKlive1 @BiznezNuna @FoxNews It is so sad that so many people accept the lies on Fox and question the truth on all other networks. We have a free society so that's their prerogative but we, the majority, need to do what we can to promote peace and acceptance. The right can whine.

@DearAuntCrabby @a7160957 First...Christianity started in the 4th century and the Bible was written by a lot of people, none of them the apostles. Second, slaughter??? Huh???

@_SJPeace_ @a7160957 This is what Trump has approved of...PLEASE vote him and the rest of his minions out. We need to end this.  At least for eight years.  I'd send that guy to prison for something...there must be a law we can lock him up for
@CB618444 @raaamises We all are.  We need to get these racist, sexist idiots out of office ASAP.  It's time to take our country back.
Texas....don't accept this. If this is true, media need to report on it and we need to get those votes back. It's unbelievable that the right can steal votes and get away with it...well, it is believable.  Do what you can to make your votes/voices heard. https://t.co/QzxWwVBKys
@george_capen @AlwaysLinderell Holy crap. They're going to open fire on civilians??? Son of a b,,,ch. We need to get these AHs out of office as fast as possible. This is so insane. Please vote Blue everyone.
@DogginTrump It's insane how the Republicans can cheat and get away with it...it's the only way they can win.  Everyone must vote these people out of office in 2018 and 2020. We will do things right and will not resort to the tactics the Republicans use to win. And we'll fix everything. Again
@1107_ortiz @bames_jrolin @PaulMayATL @realDonaldTrump Tariffs are an antiquated solution that expired a long ago until our idiot President took over. The fallout is just what anyone with a brain would have known. Sorry about the damage to Ford....when I'm President, we'll get rid of them.

@h8Wankmaggot45 @Lady_Sisyphus22 It seems like we're headed in that direction sometimes.  We just need to vote the Republicans out of office, though. Then we can deport the new "South" (racist Republicans).  We just need to figure out where to send them.
@AdamSchiff @Lady_Sisyphus22 He doesn't care. Just another lie to win elections

@crystalline_02 When we vote them all out of office
@GrassrootsSpeak The rule is Conservatives/Republicans can incite violence and do whatever they want and Democrats need to behave.  Republicans are the problem children IMO that the parents let misbehave.

@USAFRadar @SoCallls @WalshFreedom Gun control is nonexistent. Like any other state with no reasonable gun control (AZ)....I bought a gun just to see how long it would take....four minutes.  Returned it, but that was a gun shop. You can buy guns from private parties here with no rules. We need federal laws on guns

After 40 years, these guys still turn out wonderful songs.  Listen to "Last Dance" by Def Leppard.  They are so talented.
@BrownSWISS6 How do I follow you
Watch "Wonderful" by Everclear if you're thinking of divorce and have kids.  Your pain is nothing  compared to theirs.  Just deal with it.
@BrownSWISS6 I'm back
There's a line in Everclear's song "You can smile with all those tears in your eyes when you tell me everything is wonderful now.  I did it and regret it.  Don't get divorced before the kids are 18.  Watch the video
Don"t  get divorced until the kids are 18. Watch "Everything is Wonderful Noe.:" It's clearly spoken by a guy who's life was disrupted by divorce.  I did it and saw it.  It ruined my kids lives. Don't do it
Tell those you love that you love them.  Some are in pain and they don't realize others want them to be okay. It's not hard.  Just do it.  Watch the Seether vid Rise Above This.  His brother killed himself and he made this amazing song about it
I need a date tonight in LA.....if you're available message me.  Thanks :)
Let those you love know you love them. Some are in incredible pain. They don't feel anyone cares about them. Watch "Rise Above This" by Seether. His brother took his life for nothing
Watch "Wonderful" on YouTube if you're thinking about divorce and have kids. Don't do it.  You can break up and stay married for the kids. It's the worst pain a kid can go though
Watch the Seether song "Rise Above This" and then let everyone you love know you love them.  Some are in pain and don't let anyone know.  Save a life
There's another song by  A Great Big World called "Hold Each Other." It's about love.  It is a damn good song

Have I mentioned that Def Leppard is the best band ever.....they make new albums ever couple of years that are good.  Their latest is great.  Google last dance and now.  and another song I can't remember but everyone sings on it.  Lead.  They are the best band ever IMO
Google "Did Donald Trump rape a 13 year old?"  He did, and he's our motherf...king President.  I'm taking him down.  Hard.  Damn...I'm so pissed and it's barely noon and I'm going to Disneyland with two of my girlfriends.  Chop chop :)
@LothariiRegnum I love my kids so much
@LothariiRegnum My kids knew the marriage was over wanted us to all be together. We went to Disneyland and I got tickets for the Blue Bayou restaurant and my daughter, who was seven, would not go without her sister, brother and mother who had all gone back to the hotel. She's wonderful
November is a month away.  You need to vote Democratic.  I need a Democratic House and Senate to fix everything the Republicans have f...ked up
"Maybe" by the Sick Puppies.   Maybe it's time to change
@LothariiRegnum The positive side is we were able to keep the house clean and have a dinner every night, like normal.  Thie kids really loved that
@LothariiRegnum And that'why we broke up.  They saw us completely unhappy every day.  it was just that the day I told them we were getting divorced it caused so much pain.   I regret it.  I was with a girl and could have stuck it out
Such great lyrics..."You can smile with all those tears in your eyes when you tell me everything is wonderful now."  I did it.  It caused my kids so much pain.  Never again
On this Cali trip, I've listened to Third Eye Blind's song "How's It Gonna Be?" a lot.  It's weird.  You get songs wrapped up in your brain and can't get them out
@LothariiRegnum All I know is my experience.  My kids were fine with us being totally disconnected, as long as they had a mother and father.  When we divorced, they were in so much pain.  I will never do that again
When I kick Trump's ass in the next election, we need Def Leppard to play at the inauguration party.....Pour Some Sugar on Me :)
@LothariiRegnum I was able to fake it.  The pain I caused my children due to divorce was so horrible.  Telling them we were getting divorced was the worst day of my life.
So my daughter's first three concerts were Def Leppard,  She found that mildly amusing.  :)
Listen to "Everything is Wonderful Now" by Everclear if you're thinking of divorce.  Don't do it till the kids are 18.  You can cheat, separate, but let the kids have two parents
Let everyone you love know you love them....watch the Seether video "Rise Above This."  We don't know who's in pain.  Love them
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk  :)
There's a really good older movie by Steve Martin called 'A Simple Twist of Fate." Nobody saw it but it is a tearjerker...in a good way.  Watch it
Watch the video "Wonderful" by Everclear.  It's clearly written by someone hurt by the pain of divorce.  Just stay together until the kids are adults.  Please
On this trip "How's It Gonna Be" has been my song.  Great song
Christina Perri's song "The Words" is about a woman who has died and her widower is alone but she's still with him in spirit.  Brilliance
There's a song by Everclear called "Everything is Wonderful Now," It's clearly sung from the experience of the band.  Don't get divorced until the kids are adults.  Their pain is unbearable.
Mary I love you
If you want a divorce, wait until your youngest is 18. I didn't and it was the worst decisision of my life.  Don't do it. Your kids are rhe mos important people in the world and divorce will destroy their lives.  Please don't do it.   Thank you
Damn...when you need five women under 25, chop chop
alll the small things
@Reflecting_onit It was not abusive.  She cheated on me.  And I stuck it out for 20 years for the kids
Do not get divorced when your kids are under 18.  It is so devastating to them. Love your kids
If you're thinking about divorce and have kids, watch Everything is Wonderful Now by Everclear.  It will be devastating to your kids.  Wait until they're 18.  Please
Tell everyone you care about that you are there for them.  Watch Rise Above This by Seether....you just don't know when people are in pain....let them know you're there for them  Please
It's an oldie but a goodie....Toto...I Won't Hold You Back
There's a song called "The Words" about a man who is in love with a woman who's died.  If you watch it and know the reality, you will tear up.  Damn.  Christina Perri.....I'm in love with you
So I'm so freaking hornie that I'm chasing four girls in their early twenties and I'm, um slightly older.  Luckily I got that facelift when I had my skin cancer removed.  They pulled my face up to repair the scar.  Damn
Listen and watch "Everything is Wonderful Now" by Everclear if you want a divorce and have kids.  Don't do it...it's so painful for the kids and they are the most important people in your life.  They rely on you
Our President RAPED a 13 year old.  We elected a pedophile pervert.  He needs to be out.  Right f...king now
Another song with meaning....Puddle of Mudd.  Blurry.  Do right by your kids.
Money can't buy happiness, but it can rent it  :)
There's a song by Christina Perri, "The Words." And it is about the love a man has for a women who has died.  In the video, she's with him in spirit.  It's so heartwarming
Huntington Beach today.  Hell yea
@Amy_Siskind He'done.  I'll figure out a way....I may just punch him until he backs out of the nomination.  My fist is ready and punching my other hand is getting boring :)
Listen to "My Own Worst Enemy" on You Tube.  It's so true :)
@BlaineWHardaway I will kick his ass, hard.  He will drop out....just don't tell anyone I did it....did I just say that online???
@MsSkaarsgard @poutinesmoothie Damn woman!  You're getting me hot and bothered at 6:15am.  Blue balls.  Gosh darnit
@JJRossReaders @poutinesmoothie I'll help.  Call me anytime Pete 480 532 3711
@ellievan65 @bjcreigh I am going to punch him in the face until he drops out....did I just say that online??
@AngryRaccoon2 @HatfieldAnne Depression sucks.  People aren't more attractive.  We are all attractive, mentally or physically.  Take care and call me anytime.  I love you.  480 532 3711
@Dcl_60 @Pajjr2016 He's done in 2020.  Guraranteed.
So there's a video for Goo Goo Dolls song "Name."  The girl is friscking beautiful.   I want to date her.
Vote...if you're a Democrat, please vote.  We need to take our country back from those as...holes.  Please register and vote.
It's weird how certain songs can just become your day.  For me, it's "How's It Gonna Be?" by Third Eye Blind.  Listen to it...I think it's because I'm in love with five women.  Damn
Don't tell anyone but you can smuggle vodka into Disneyland in a water bottle and mix it once you get in.  Hella....Damn :)
Watch Seether's "Rise Above This" on YouTube and look at the tears in his eyes.  Then love those you care about and make sure they know you love them.  Some people are in incredible pain and don't let anyone know.  Thank you.
@SoulStealer25 @JanzforCongress @BetoORourke I'm moving to Huntington Beach from AZ....if I can vote against Devin, I sure will.  If not, I will gladly kick his ass
@EdKrassen Trump is done.  That's the plan.  He can claim whatever the hell he wants.  We just need to kick him out of office.
@RiderofWolves Her focus was on me and we had a wonderful day, but she's jealous of my other female friends.  It's difficult....but we did laugh all day and have a date again today.  Damn.  Women.  I'm addicted
@krassenstein We just need to do the same thing with him that the Republicans did with us....don't vote....be jerks.  It's insane, but the Republicans seem to make it work so we need to follow by example.
@shannonrwatts three
@RealMuckmaker There's an episode of Seinfeld where the coach tells George "Can't Stand Ya."  That's how I feel about Mr. Cruz
@realDonaldTrump Go to hell
@SaysHummingbird He's done.  I'm not sure how, but I'm working on it
Treat your kids like the most important people in your life...because they are.  Everything else is secondary.
Watch "Rise Above This" on YouTube and let everyone you love know you love them.  It's so important.  Look at the water in his eyes....his brother killed himself.  Don't let it happen to your family and friends if you can prevent it.  Love them
If you're thinking about divorce and have kids, watch Everclear's "Everything is Wonderful Now."  It's so painful for the kids....wait until they're 18 if there's any way you can.  Our kids are the most important people in our lives.  Make them the most important, not you
Sometimes we need music to recharge.  Lately, for me it's been third eye blind "Hows it gonna be."  "I want to taste the salt of your skin."  Incredible lyrics
@hereitcomesagin People.....Republicans need to go...elect Democrats in 2018 and 2020 so we can fix everything they've f...ked up.. Kick them out so we can heal the problems.  Damn, I'm still pissed.  No more Twitter for awhile :)
@wintertao @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Everything Trump says is a lie.  He's f...king done.  Guaranteed
@Alyssa_Milano We are fixing this.  This BS is over.
@AmoneyResists @FBI Kavenaugh....I will kick your ass....Go the f...k away.  NOW.  You've been warned.  And treat women right from now on.  I have a fist and it wants to meet your face.  Bad.
@LiberalResist @denhamon It's about everything.  I will kick his ass.  He needs to go the f...k away.  This BS is over.  We are taking our motherf...king country back.  Damn...I'm so pissed and it's only 6:20 am.  Luckily my girlfriend is coming over this morning to cool me off :)
@Stop_Trump20 Hell yeah
I'm not sure if I posted this lately but our President RAPED a 13 year old.   That's the only reason I'm running....I am writing screenplays and will make much more doing what I love, but that motherf...king as....hole has to go, so I'm doing this.  Trump.  Go the f...k away. NOW
Listen to Hinder "Lips of an Angel" on YouTube....that's my day today.  Chop chop :)
Watch the Seether video "Rise Above This" and then love those you love the most.  So many are in pain and we don't know it until it's too late.  Let them know you love them.  Please
I'll fix everything but there will be a stripper pole in the Oval Office and five first ladies.  That's the deal.  Chop chop
Cut hateful people out of your life.  Toxic a...hole....often family.  It's Xanax for the soul.  I did a year ago and have had the best year of my life.  Don't let people ruin your life.  Live life, do right and be happy
Frick!  I'm in love with three women and can't decide.  Damn
Seether's "Rise Above This" is such a powerful song.  Love those you care about and let them know you love them.  People are in pain and don't let others know.  Do what you can to prevent this.  Thank you.
I keep saying it but listen to Everclear "Wonderful" if you want to get divorced.  Just wait until they are 18.....I didn't and ruined my kids' childhoods.  Don't do it.  Please.
Lit...My own worst enemy...."Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk.  I didn't mean to call you that."  Great lyrics
@ThePlumLineGS Dickhead...go the f...k away.  right f...king now.  You don't respect women.  You're done.  I will kick your ass.  Hard.  Get ready to be black and blue
@Ange_Amene It's f...king rape you stupid b...ch
If you love someone, let them know it.  Listen to Seether's "Rise Above This."  Some people are in so much pain and they don't tell anyone.  It's horrible
@Archaeologist03 @TorontoStar Yup....the government is making the wealthy richer.  That's going to change.
Have I mentioned I'm in love with five women....damn.  I can't decide.  They're all so wonderful
@raaamises I was whipped with a belt by my stepfather when I was f...kng 12.  I made it but it has always stuck with me.  I treated my kids with much more love
@NikeC42 Sometimes you have to do what you have to do.  I was married 20 years and just couldn't take it anymore....it was so painful for the kids that I still regret it, but they've healed and so have I.  It was just rough the first couple of years
@raaamises My kids were obedient with just talk.  No violence
@JerryMochi @CTO1ChipNagel @GOP @DNC That fake orange faced as...hole is done.  Give me two years
@amvetsupport @realDonaldTrump I don't even want to be President....writing movies, living in Cali with my beautiful girlfriend.  It will be a pain in the ass, but I need to get that as....hole out.  It seems like the Dems don't have anyone.  This BS is over
@mommamia1217 @Lady_Sisyphus22 He must do some kind of drug...he can't pronounce words.  He's f...king done.  Guaranteed
@B52Malmet Vote Democratic everyone.  We will fix everything.  Everything.  This BS is f...king over.  Damn.  I'm getting worked up and it's only 8am.  Republicans....not judging, but your time is up.  We're taking our mother...king country back
@jdyadvs He's done.  I'm working on it
@SocialPowerOne1 Kavanaugh....drop out.  Right f...kng now.  If you can't respect women, you don't deserve sh...t.  Get ready to get punched hard.  Go the f...k away.  NOW
@trishm426 So true
@krassenstein Things are going to f...king change in 2020.  This BS is over
@Amy_Siskind I will take care of Kavenaugh.  Take care.
@raaamises Its so cruel...kids are kids.  They can't resist.  I want to punch all child abusers.....f..king hard.  As...holes.  Don't come near me or you're going to black and blue
@NikeC42 I'm in love
@NikeC42 Mine are moving on. They didn't expect it. I sat them down and said "Sometimes people love each other but can't stay together" and my daughter made a joke, saying "Who's getting divorced?"  thinking it was one of my siblings.  And I said "We are."  Worst day of my life.  The pain
@raaamises I was beaten.  With a belt.  And my Mom was fine with that.  My kids get treated right.
@NikeC42 Frick...I came out here and met the love of my life...funny, beautiful....holy crap.  Yesterday was the best day of my life.  And today will be better.  Damn  :)
@NikeC42 I'm writing movies and running for President
@NikeC42 Until I lost my job, it was way better.  We had dinner together every night.  A clean house.  Did homework together...life hits hard sometimes but things are looking up....OMG...I'm in love
@NikeC42 Holy crap....yesterday was the best birthday ever.  Damn....OMG....
@Archaeologist03 @TorontoStar Okay...I'm not sure what you mean by that but don't be quiet.  Speak your mind.  We get one life.  Do and say what you think is right
@raaamises Never spank children.  It's child abuse.  I was whipped...with a belt...at 12.  I wasn't a great Dad but I never hurt my kids.  They are the most important people in the world.
@NikeC42 Sometimes you have to do difficult things....the day I told my kids we were getting divorced was the worst day of my life...so much pain. They had no idea.  But it's all better now
@StanLeeGee GOP senators are done.  Done. Just watch.  Go the f...k home you rich ass...les.  We're taking our mother...king country back.  Go to hell.  Did I just say that online?  :)
@JasonSquiresSM @Bizitalk Holy crap....um, it's been insanely wonderful.  I love Cali
@ellievan65 @denhamon Kavenaugh….drop out.  Right now.  Go home.  You don't want to meet me.  Get the f...k out of here ass...le.  And treat women right
@itsreallyalexb That face needs to be punched and I have a f...kng hard fist right now.  Just sayin
@itsreallyalexb 20 percent of Trump fans are ass...les.
So how can a guy who's 42 (ish)...date five women under 25?  Charm, good looks, intelligence, RESPECT...respect women...they help us procreate the earth....and are kind of amazing. To the guy who hurt my friend...hide...I will kick your ass if we ever meet.  Never touch her again
Have I mentioned that our President RAPED a 13 year old...Google it.  And then help me kick his mother...king ass out of office in 2020.  And vote Democratic.  We're taking our mother...king country back....right f...king now.  I'm a little worked up  :)
No matter how unhappy your marriage is, it will be devastating to your kids to end it...wait until they're adults.  Watch "Everything is Wonderful Now" by Everclear.  The message is true.  I lived it.  Don't do it.  Please
It's an older song, but so beautiful....Toto...."I Can't Hold You Back Down."
Listen to Seether's song "Rise Above This."  Then love thoee you care about....you never know who's in pain.
Please don't take this the wrong way....I'm in love with five women.  I can't decide. Don't tell anyone  :)
Everclear..."Everything Is Wonderful Now."  Don't divorce before your kiss are adults....Don't.  Their pain will be unbearable and they're your kids.  Nobody else matters as much as them.  I know...I did it and regret it to this day
There are so many meaningful songs....EverClear...."Everything is Wonderful Now."  Don't get divorced until your kids are adults.  It's so painful.  Don't do it.  I did and regret it every day
I've beaten it to death, but it needs to be.  Love those you love and let them know you love them....some people are in incredible pain and don't share it.  Watch Seether "Rise Above This" and watch the pain in his eyes....don't let loved ones think they're alone
I LOVE California...just sayin.  Goodbye AZ

Holy sh...t.   That's it...damn, I love California.

@100_Disable_vet @mamapojo They're all ass...oles, racists and traitors.  My own parents are voting for Trump in 2020 even tho I'm running against him.  Well, they will be pissed.
@krassenstein @denhamon I'm taking him out in 2020.  Damn....let's figure this out  We'lll get rid of Trump and I'll beat Pence in 2020.  Done.
@atDavidHoffman @denhamon @LindseyGrahamSC He's done....I'm not sure how...maybe just from having his face punched so hard that he can't concentrate.....I will figure out a way.  He's not on the Court.  Done.
@JeffFlake @CTO1ChipNagel Thank you
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Go to hell, as...hole.  It's time for you to retire.
@shannon_crane I generally don't like to judge, but Republicans, in general, are rich racist a.s...holes.  We are taking our motherf...king country back.
@pgrain @MSNBC @tedlieu @maddow I am kicking his ass.   This behavior is unacceptable.
Google "Did Donald Trump rape a 13 year old?"  He's our motherf...king President....not past 2020  I'm kicking his ass.
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
@BravenakBlog @KamalaHarris Kamala is a badass....I think I'm fairly tough but she could kick my ass....we need to run together in 2020.  We'll win 50 states and 100 million votes....at least.
@KamalaHarris Okay....I'm so pissed.  Republicans are such motherf...king a...holes.  Kavaanaugh raped her and they defend that????   This has to be over.  Elect Democrats to the House and Senate and elect me in 2020.  We need to end this BS,, right f...king now.
@gr8in2020 @KamalaHarris We disagree.  Don't be disrespectful.
Nicole....I'll be back in a few hours.....
I'm not sure why but for some reason I keep wanting to listen to and watch "How's It Gonna Be" by  Third Eye Blind.  It is a good song.
Make sure those you love know that you love them....so many people are in pain, really bad pain and they don't tell anyone.  I know...no more over-sharing, but love those who you care about.  Thank you.
How f...king fast can I get back to California?   Maybe nine hours.  Chop chop
@JanzforCongress @zelda_rowan Damn, there are so many people I want to punch.   Add Nunes to the list
@SpockResists @porpentina2017 @chappie_cat @txmockingjay @DoctorMcCoy2018 @TrisResists @StormResist @LunaLuvgood2017 @exoticgamora @KassandraSeven @TrinityResists I'm running as an Independent....not a Dem, not a Republican.  This is done.  We are fixing everything.
@goldengateblond @zelda_rowan He's done...I haven't figured out how  yet, but he's done.  And that face is going to be very black and blue....did I say that online???
@TSearcaigh @zelda_rowan Yup.  My fist is ready....just give me the list
We are taking our motherf...king country back.  Right f...king now.  Damn, I'm mad and it's 3:11 in the morning in AZ.  Republicans....you are through.
RT @KamalaHarris: I support Dr. Blasey Ford’s request for an FBI background investigation before a hearing. She should not be bullied into…
@ida_skibenes @shannon_crane Some guys are pervs.....I'm so sorry.  Get therapy and deal with it.  You deserve to live your life.  And I would like very much to kick his ass so if you DM me his address,...let's just say he's going to fall down and get two very black eyes.  My fist is ready.  Now.
@seungminkim @zelda_rowan If his face is black and blue, he can't get nominated....my fist is ready and his face is the target...did I say that online?
@tweetmommybop A punching bag
Be there for those you love....there are so many people in pain and they don't tell anyone.  I know....I was there.  Love those you care about and let them know you love them.  Please.
Holy crap California.  Damn...holy crap California.....love it there.  I can't wait to go back this morning.  Nicole, I'm coming back.  Don't tell Mary or Kaitlin...okay tell them.  You women.  Damn
So when I need to cheer up....Blink 182.  Damn :)
Damn....YouTube...."Everything Will be Wonderful Now."  Everclear.  Don't get divorced before your kids are adults.  Don't.  You will hurt them and they are them most important part of your life.
Love those who you care for....sometimes people are in so much pain and feel unloved.  It sucks but we can prevent it.  Love them.  That's my message for the day.
@CeeLeeCee3 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I'm so sorry.   Please find someone else to cure your pain  You will.  I will help if you want.  Take care, don't forget him, but move on....you have to if you want to feel better.  I am here for you.  Call me anytime 480 532 3711
@almostjingo @HybridMomentum @maddow @HillaryClinton @BillClinton Hillary kind of sucked.  She attacked Libya and they did nothing to us...she had them bomb water plants....I don't like her or Trump.  We had no choice in 2016.  In 2020, there will be a choice.  I am going to kick his f...king ass.  Done.
@ellievan65 @RunninRebe1 Two more years and this BS is over.  Guaranteed
@SenKamalaHarris @MyKidsMakeStuff PLEASE be my running mate...DM me or call me 480 532 3711.  We will win 50 states and fix everything.
@kenolin1 @PennyCarrigan1 Who is it?    I will kick their ass.  I get death threats and they are from cowards.  My fist is really ready to  destroy a f....king coward's face.   Damn....where is this person?  My fist is bored.
It's been a few days since i reminded everyone....our President RAPED a 13 year old.  Google it.  He f...king raped a 13 year old.  That's why I'm kicking his ass in 2020.  That orange face will hurt....bad.
@GrassrootsSpeak @bo_bessa I have a very f...king hard punch and it needs to land in some assho...'s face.  Is Orin Hatch available?  Dude,  don't f...k with me.  Don't.
@GrassrootsSpeak @bo_bessa Okay, when he's black and blue and really hurting...nobody report me.....my fist is ready to punch someone who's name sounds like Orin Hatch....damn, did I say that online??
Yesterday was the best day ever....damn I love California....and Nicole. Did I say that online??
Love your kids.  They are the most important people in the world....after that, love your friends....you just don't know who's in pain.  Love them and let them know you love them.  Please.
Have I mentioned that Def Leppard is the best band ever?  Listen to "Last Dance."  They started playing 40 years ago and still put out wonderful songs....no other band that I know of does that.  If they put out a new album, it's not that good.  Def Leppard is that good
If I don't post by 9am, call the fire department...my chest hurts.  It's probably okay but just in case,...
Treat women right....or get ready for my fist to meet your face.  Did I say that online??  Damn, it's late :) https://t.co/a0PjDyau0g
@WhitfordBradley @denhamon @HillaryClinton She lost....I'll win.  Trump is f...king done in 2020.  Guaranteed.
@Supahsim @sleeplikeababy1 It's an old saying, but you can sleep when you die.  If you're not tired, and I'm not, live live 22 hours a day, or 24 :)
I've said it a bunch of times, but listen to Seether's "Rise Above This" and love your loved ones....life can suck sometimes and people lose hope.  Love them and let them know you care.
@VABVOX @OrrinHatch I have a punch for Mr. Hatch....damn...don't tell anyone.  His face is going to hurt really f...king bad.  Did I say that online???   It wasn't me  :)
@EdKrassen @denhamon I get hate email all the time...it shows they're jealous.
@SoulStealer25 So the way I won it was I was in band and puked on the ASU football field during halftime....the other team caught a pass in the last 30 seconds and the runner slipped and fell where I puked. Yup....won a game for ASU :)
Okay, the Internet is addicting, but you find people who really need help. We seek it out online.  Love your kids, whoever you love and don't lose hope.  I almost did and everything fixed itself.
@EdKrassen @XlnaF Two more years
@SoulStealer25 I won a football game for asu
@Amy_Siskind I get them too. Republican gun nuts
why am i so attracted to dancers....because they are half my age and gorgeous?   Yeah, that works :)
When you chase women half your age it's a stres fest.   Damn.....I can't wait until I see my girlfriend at 1130 at, um, that's all the info I'm giving out but I want her to be FLOTUS
@seekerwisdom1 Trump is done.  I can't stand him so much I'm kicking his ass in the election....and if I forgot to remind everyone....google "Did Donald Trump Rape a 13 year old?"  He did.  I want to punch that fake orange face so f...king bad.
I'm too drunk to check my texts....is that bad???
How's it gonna be?   You Tube third eye blind
Life can suck.   It's hard sometimes but you get one life....don't end it.  There's so much to live for.  Music, friends, lovers, don't ever f...king end it.
Holy crap....I love this state.  I met the love of my life, well, since I can't decide and drink a lot she came up.....done.   and i may have messed up wiht Mary and Kaitlin but will try to sober up and figure it out....but now I have a new girlfriend....just forgot her name
I am gasping to breathe.....this is a wonderful state and I met a wonderful girl here yesterday, but I cannot breathe....it's the price I pay
@Amy_Siskind Kavaenough is done.  The Republicans know he's an assh...le.  For some insane reason, we can't count on them to do the right thing but if something will hurt them, they step up.  They are all out in 2018 and 2020.
@Archaeologist03 @TorontoStar Yes, we are diplomatic, but if I run into him that face is going down.
So I met the fifth future first lady today....damn California.  This place is amazing :)
In the 80s I moved to northern cal and my best friend from high school came with. He was homosexual and that was when AIDs was bad.  He died because he followed me out there. I can't change it but it sucks.  He died because of me.  F...k
@RiderofWolves I will be your friend for life
@Archaeologist03 @TorontoStar Thank you.  I won't punch him but I want to so bad....He's done and we are taking our motherf....king country back.  Sorry for the profanity :)
@4YrsToday @pilgrimage222 F...k no
@AlyssaMastro44 Does anyone have any ideas on Kavanaugh?  It's the one problem I can't think of a solution to.
@The_UnSilent_ @denhamon I need to punch someone....Epstein and Trump.  Damn  My fist hurts.  They are done.
@The_UnSilent_ @denhamon He RAPED a 13 year old...Google it.  He is our motherf...king President.  I am going to kick his ass, hard.....100 million votes and 50 states to 20 mil/zero states....and the debates will be on HBO.  I'm bringing up Epstein over and over and over and over.  He should retire, now
@Archaeologist03 @TorontoStar Can I punch him???  Okay, well I'll kick his ass in 2020.  Whatever.
Oh, and another first lady :)
I love this state.
there are so many good songs out there but Nickelback Lullaby is one of my favorites.  the message is so perfect.  love your kids.  I love you Stephanie alex and leah, more than anything.
Love your kids...nobody is more important.
My "Blink 182" t-shirt kept me out of jaiil.  Thanks guys.
Have I said music heals the soul.  A great big world...hold each other.
I need to kick someone's ass.  I'm thinking Mr. Trump.  Orange face,  Ugly, mentally and physically.  He may be black and blue...he can throw he first punch then he's done.  :)
I'm in love with Kaitlin and telling the world....damn
@RiderofWolves Woman....stop it....I know how it feels.  I was there and it got better.  Your posts are funny....keep doing that and don't look down....I did and almost denied myself to my kids.  Life sucks sometimes but if you find the strength and friends, like me, to get thru it, you will
So I'm in fairly good shape but like Def Leppard, a lot, and Phil Collen is a 60 year old 30 year old.  Damn Phil....make me work out :)  Hopefully that made sense....I'm a little drunk.  Don't tell anyone.
I'm not much into country music but Chris Janson has a song called "Buy Me a Boat."  It's f...king funny :)
@1MeLrO Damn, woman....it's 7:22am and I'm a little drunk and your message confused me so much I need another drink :)  Have a great day
@skittle624 If it was black rope, brush your teeth and let's go to Disneyland
@krassenstein Because they have the 20 million Republicans left.  I just ignore them....it's the fake news
@justsomegirl81 Okay
@Eiggam5955 @SoCallls I'm so sorry.  Some guys just don't care or get it.  Treat women well and you will live a good life.  Well, do what you want to do today.  Anything.  We get one life...live it and let the past go.  I did.  It helps
@treasonstickers We are taking them out and taking our motherf...king country back.  This is over.  Now
@Amy_Siskind Finally
@SoulStealer25 Just don't drive and get checked out to make sure your liver is okay.  It's life and it sucks sometimes.  We drink to escape.  You're not alone.  Call me anytime.  Pete 480 532 3711
@B52Malmet Christine.  He is done.  I don't know how yet but he's done.  I may just have to kick his a...s  He looks like someone I would like to punch....a lot
@krassenstein I can't stand Trump so much I'm running for President, just to kick his ass.  Putin can't change this. 100 million votes to 20, including my Republican parents.  He's done
@RGansen @sleeplikeababy1 Enjoy it....they grow up so fast.  I used to call my kids "Daddy's little alarm clock."  Rocking them, loving them.....I need to have more kids
@EdKrassen I have a f...king punch that needs to land on an a...shole's face.  Let's do this
My best friend and future wife, maybe if she agrees, was beaten and cut by some stupid kid....my fist is ready to punch someone...kid, hide.  She's my friend and I love her.  You get a fist to the face....f...king hard
@Amy_Siskind Finally
Live life....love your loved ones.  Cut off toxic people.  Now
Third Eye Blind..."How's It Going to Be?"   My morning song
19 minutes till breakfast
If I have not said it before online, hhere we go.  Don't judge. We all have our weaknesses.  Mine are women and alcohol.,...but my as....hole mother and brother are worse....I've give away a hundred grand this year to total strangers.  They hoard their money and bull;y. I win
@RiderofWolves Are you here in Orange County?
@RiderofWolves Hi
Damn, already drunk at 5:36 am...did I say that online???
@DennisWaite5 @CTO1ChipNagel Can I punch hiim???  Hard..  He's an ordained minister and supposedly a Christian and he married that a....hole Muchking to his trophy wife....huh???  WTF???  I need a drink and it is 5:32 am.....did I just say that online??? Elect me :)
Wow, the shortness of breathe really sucks....but if it keeps me out of prison in AZ, then bring it on.  I got the delicious spaghetti last night at the hotel and was too drunk to open the box....I'm hungry
Blue Bayou has a two month waiting list....two motherf...king months....WTF. It used to be four days, now it's two months.....they just want me to move here....breakfast in 41 minutes and find a date and go to Disneyland today.
I'm out of breath and have been jiust in the hotel room....it's a little scary, but will hopefully  keep me out of prison in AZ for felony drunk driving....did I just say that online???
So you women played me....and I fell for it.  Abella was fake, maybe.  Mary and Kaitlin were real.....and I'm still drunk from last night.....I met some woman and her sister at the bar here and they  both enjoyed my stories....
It's  little narcissistic, but I have one hour until the breakfast buffet and I'm not even hungry.
Democrats...you all need to vote.  We need to kick the Republicans out.  Right f...king now. https://t.co/9WNiqqKKR6
I need one for my head and one to hug.
If you're younger than me...um, 42....live life.  Do whatever the f...k you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone
So google "Last Dance" by Def Leppard.  Phil is fricking 60 years old....I'm close and am in way worse shape.  Time to work out :)
@stonecold2050 @2_Eyre_Is_Human I need to kick your ass, Rght f...king now.  My fist is ready.  F...k off, governor of Maine....your face will hurt, bad.  So you'd better avoid me....not a threat....I just hate motherf...king racist  a.....holes and from what I've read online, you appear to be someone I dislike
Damn.  Midnight in Anaheim.   Why doesn't everyone stay up all night like me???  At least there's YouTube.....Hinder...Lips of an Angel.  So much great harmonic rock.
Sorry, I'm harping on this, but watch the video for Seether "Rise Above this."  He has tears in his eyes.  If you're sick, it will get better.  Call me 480 532 3711.  We'll fix this.
Read the posts on Seether "Rise Above This."  OMG....I'm a pretty tough guy and I have tears in my eyes....so many people are in pain.  Don't let anyone you love or anyone, period, do this.
So I met the sister of the woman who was mildly criticizing me at the bar at my hotel...damn, women.  So just because I'm addicted to younger women, women my age, um 42ish judge. Don't judge.  I don't.  Damn, I love this state :)
My tweets are relatively funny but also check out Facebook....I'm maxed out on friends, but you can read my posts....damn....It's Monday and I need a date to Disneyland.  Bueuller, Bueller???
Damn....I love this state....just went to Arco to buy booze and a cop said he'd rather be in AZ....no.  Racist, Republican.  Cali is the place to be...I'll fricking live on the street here vs. in a wonderful apartment in Scottsdale....damn, they're probably worried about me.
@bjcreigh @denhamon Good for you....people are assholes.  They're jealous.  Love her and let her love you.  I'm jealous,
Have I mentioned that I want to kick some dumb kid's ass?  My best friend, who is beautiful and smart and who's motherf...king parents didn't help her when she was being abused, reached out to me. Kaitlin, I love you and I will kick his ass, but let's get married first
So it's crazy, but girls who are my friends but not girlfriends, will message me on Twitter but not pick up the f...king phone....not judging, just mildly upset.  I've been here for a week....someone, please go to Disneyland with me
I need a date to Disneyland and Huntington Beach tomorrow....call me 480 532 3711.  Did I just put that online for thousands to see?  Well, can't change the past...chop chop.
Damn....I just want to punch someone.  Is that wrong???  Only someone bad
Okay, so I'm going to Disneyland tomorrow, with someone.  Call or text me or come to the Majestic Garden Hotel, room 1116....did I just put that online for thousands to see?  The fireworks are still going off.  Disneyland tomorrow, Kimmel and Hollywood Tuesday and then back to AZ
DDamn...the fireworks are going off at  :Disneyland and I'm not there....women, get here,,,now.  I'm bored
Um, if you can avoid it, don't have your kids bail you out of jail....not fun....but I'm at Disneyland now so it's all good....sorry kids.  I love you
@TedOkonCOA @hcUncovered Giving  to execs.  That's changing.  Right f...king now.  They can kiss my a...s.  Um, I'm pissed.  Rich people live entitled lives while the rest of us work so f...king hard.   I lived in Scottsdale....I saw it every day at Walmart....yup, they are rich and they shop at Walmart.
@Amy_Siskind He is done.  Somehow, some way,....we will send him home with his ugly mug and those kids who don't know he was using them.  I can't stand him as much as Trumpl.   They're both done.
I'm in love with four women....the President thing probably won't happen but hey, let's mix it up.  Accept the fact that I'm addicted to women and I'll fix everything.  Deal?
Can you be President and have three girlfriends?   Just checking.
So I'm on the plane out to Cali and this woman sits next to me. I share my stories, which are interesting. She calls me "bizarre" in  a mean way.  Thank God a guy sat between us.  I wanted to punch her or at least tweak her nose :)
I tweet about politics, but listen to a song by Seether..Rise Above This....it's so meaningful....I think it's about his brother.  Love your family, friends and let them know you're there for them....sometimes life just throws a curve ball at us and we lose control.  Don't do it
@LiberalJustin People need and are entitled to medical care, especially veterans.  The money I cut from the budget will to to universal health care and veteran's hospitals.  Nobody's attacking us...we're just making defense contractor execs rich.  No more.  Things are going to change.
@RobinSzalanski @misguidedgent Okay, I'm up to four.  Salt Lake City?
Have I mentioned that our motherf...king President raped a 13 year old.  Google it.  He (allegedly) did.  I'm kicking his ass.  Can I keep punching that fake orange face?   Damn, am I online???
Have I reminded everyone that our President RAPED a thirteen year old.  Google it.  He's our f...king President.  He is done.  Guarenteed
Call me.  let's go out.  480 532 3711
Life is so damn short.  Don't sleep if you don't need to
omg....i'm kinda drunk, but I think the love of my life messaged me and wants to be with me.  Okay, I have three loves, but she's the one.
@Gupton68 @ShellHasNoName You can't buy happiness but you can rent it  :)
@RaeBelliscranky @mamapojo What's your number?
Holy crap Batman....I'm in love with three women.   Son of a b...ch
Holy crap Batman....I can't complain but sometimes I still do.  A 22, 23 and 24 year old girlfriend.  Damn.   Nope, this works :)
@Amy_Siskind He's one...I know I've beat it to death, but I am kicking his a.... in 2020.  I'm running just because he is such a MFAH pedophile that I want to punch that fugly face, hard.  Did I just say that online?  Donald, you are through.
Visiting California....damn, it's nice here.  I'm moving :)
I want to go out with you....https://t.co/zAPVR7zbc1
@VABVOX @EjquiujmiPlis And as much as I wanted her to win, she's not a nice person....check out the Internet on when she was first lady.  She also killed a lot of people in Libya for nothing....she's just better than Trump.  Damn, I'm old....good thing I stopped aging at 42 :)
It's an old saying but so true...."Women, can't live with them, can't live without them."  Damn
A close friend of mine had a punk boyfriend who beat her and cut her...WTF???  She's  beautiful and kind.  Some young guys are idiots.  He had better never meet me because I am punching m;y fist just for practice. Punk, your face will hurt, f...king bad.  Don't hurt my friend
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?  https://t.co/y9Va3jDZOI
California is wonderful.....damn.   if you haven't been here, come out.  The weather, the beach, Disneyland.....I have to move here right fricking now
Have I told you to cut off your family....if they are self-absorbed narcississts like mine, cut them off.  It's Xanax for the soul.
Damn.    I have hundreds of messages.  One at a time.   Let's go.
Damn.   Music.  It keeps me sane.  Barely :)
Okay, everyone....tnere are so many of you contacting me I can't connect, but I got the message....I'm at Disneyland so if you want to meet, find me.  I'll be at Space Mountain or Pirates of the Carribean.
This has to f...king stop.  Do not accept this https://t.co/jtTU1jZDTh
@aia__9 @jore849 We don't communicate perfectly, but we do communicate, thanks to twitter translate.  Thanks for the kind message and have a wonderful day tomorrow.
Damn, do I like NIckelbacck as much as Def Leppard?  Maybe we need both at the inauguration.  Midnight at Disneyland and wide awake.....let's go :)https://t.co/tzuOhiJIQp
Have you ever been so mad at someone you run for President?  I have.  I can't f...king stand our President and so I am kicking his ass in 2020.  My goal....100 million votes to his 20 million from rich, racist Republicans and my parents.
@ReflectCenter And I rush....I procrastinate and then rush to get caught up.  Thank you for the advice.
@george_capen @GH_obsession They all will

Life hits hard sometimes.  This singer wrote a song about the most painful experience in his life and it's such a good song, that if you don't know the story you don't know it's about his brother's suicide.  and if I got that wrong, I'm sorry, but that's what I read online
https://t.co/ggaE0bkEYZ
https://t.co/dH96LOTkLb
Mary, I'm so sorry.  Please forgive me.
Yes. I have no obligations to lobbyists or the NRA so we are going to fix f...king everything.  Done.  Give me a Democratic House and maybe a Democratic Senate and we will fix everything....then the Republicans can f...k it up in 2028.  That's the pattern.
@mamapojo Yes.  I'm fixing everything.  Hopefully in four years so I can write movies and just chill in California
Coolest President ever....just a sayin'
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk....https://t.co/CjBzuN2ya3

@jdyadvs @myphoenixfires9 What day do you want to go?  I'm here until Tuesday
@Jessdaisy Yup
@jdyadvs @myphoenixfires9 Seaworld would work.  I'm here until Tuesday
@RealDonaldTrFan Funny stuff.  When I kick his ass in 2020, please treat me nicer.  Thanks :)
@jdyadvs @myphoenixfires9 Yup.  The happiest place on earth.  :)

@myphoenixfires9 @jdyadvs It's wonderful
I've got one day left in Cali....if you are female and attractive (mentally and physically), let's go to Disneyland today and the beach tomorrow. Call me 480 532 3711
If you are female and in LA and want to go to D sneyland today, call me.  I have one more day and then have to go back to AZ.   420 532 3711
I'm in Cali and Jan &amp; Dean come to mind....they were the "Beach Boys II".  https://t.co/CJ4e6D6s5i
When I got married, we asked the DJ to play "Hysteria" for our wedding dance.  He was too f..king cheap to buy the CD and played some other crappy song...maybe that's why my marriage didn't last.  It's not, but I'm still mad.  https://t.co/AAXJrOtOZf
@PatrickClaybon @islandertmt @FOX4 This is over... I'm going to give it my all.  People just don't get it.  Badge cameras, sensible gun control, learning that we all are human, regardless of the color of our skin....why are some people so, um, stupid.  Get along.  We all share this planet and need each other
@Tweet4Girl @Tintinme_ Can I just like you?  I love three women already, plus my kids.  My quota is six  :)
Stop this fire in my brain :)
@nachosarah @KikiAdine Vote for me....I'm better looking (I fake it, but don't tell anyone), charming and smart.  We are going to fix everything Trump has f...ked up.  Two more years.
@thomaskaine5 np
If you want me to like your song, put beautiful women in it....https://t.co/Ecvo3jHwKV
@bubbagump324 He is so damn ugly, mentally and physically.
@SenBillNelson Give me two years.  I'm working on it. I'm so sorry for your pain.  We're there with you.  I just need to get rid of Trump first.  Then let's fix everything.
@Whatevah_Amy So would I....um, I need to go work out

Elect me and let's get this over with...and elect a Democratic House and Senate.  Give me four years to fix everything and then the Republicans can screw it all up again.  Than's the  pattern.  Look it up.  I did.  It has been a recurring pattern for 30 years.

@maydaymindy9 She and her dad are out of there.  I'm moving in.
@realDonaldTrump Go to hell, you stupid MFAH.  John Kerry is a veteran a you, um, are a draft dodger and a lying idiod..  You're FIRED.
@myphoenixfires9 @jdyadvs Get here now.  I will fly you.
@live010100 @n7nt9 I need to get my survivor salvation and all I have is money.  Please help me.  Thank you.
@amvetsupport Is this fun yet??? That MFAH is going down and we're going to let him.  It's kind of cool.  We just have to humor him for a week, but can make him pay.   Done.
@myphoenixfires9 @jdyadvs Money and Disneyland
@krassenstein @VH27672640 I cannot wait to destroy him in 2020.  90 million votes to 30 million.  50 states to none.  That's the plan.  This nightmare ends in November 2019
@Amy_Siskind @FlowerFarmher Can I punch him in the face?  Hard?   Don't look, but he's going to have a black eye tomorrow....and will drop out of the race.  That's my plan.  Did I say that online?  Just kidding :)
@BrianKarem @VH27672640 @CNN Trump supporters can go to hell (and will).  We are taking our motherf....king country back.   Done.
@Alyssa_Milano I want to take him out so bad....but my brain is fried.   Well, this is a challenge.
@RiderofWolves All the time
@krassenstein @VH27672640 Two years and two months
@fawfulfan The GOP is f..king done.  Vote Democratic.  If you are in the bottom 90 percent of taxpayers, we will cut your taxes, fix all the country and world's problems and maybe more.   Give us 10 years and then the GOP can f...k everything up again. That's the pattern.
@jennycohn1 @randydrsmith I cannot fire that AH soon enough.  Damn

@MsSkaarsgard I only have two hairs but stroke them and protect me.  I'm tired.  And then let's go to Disneyland and Huntington Beach :)
@KamalaHarris Okay, but I need you to be my running mate, so hopefully a woman will replace you. We are going to win 50 states in the biggest landslide in history.  Let's do this.
@EdKrassen @VH27672640 Did it portray Trump in a less than favorable light?   I need a copy
@amvetsupport @randydrsmith Hell yeah....I'm running for President just to get him the f...k out.  We are taking back our motherf....king country, right f...king now.  Sorry for the profanity....not really :)

@thehill Fox News can go to hell
@palomapoetry @B52Malmet @GOP Yup
@Stonekettle @KDavidSmithAuth This is f...king BS.  We can't change it because of our crazy gun /police society, but I will be changing things....badge cameras on all the time, sensible gun control...we are going to do something.  Finally.  People are going  to start being responsible.
I've  been here 4 days and everyone is nice.  It sucks not having friends in a state you don't live in but, hey, that's the worst part of the day.  I made a new friend, two new girlfriends and will be at Disneyland in  a few hours, no matter what the the cost.  Chop chop
@restaurant_mom Damn woman.  They found nothing.  They never do.  THey find what they plant....so you and me are going to be that kids' parents and they frisk us. I will need to be cleared first....I
My girlfriend is back.  I made a friend  out hare and  here.   It's all good
I keep harping on this but make friends with people in the Middle East.  Twitter translates so you can communicate.  They are just like us...not terrorists, not bad people, just normal humans living normal lives.  Let's end the hate.  Now.
@kj6sj @s___ss3 Thank you for the kind message.
If you have a moderate Republican Congressperson....we only have five and I'm too lazy too look them up....so contact them and let them know that if Kavanaugh is appointed to the Supreme Court, you won't vote for them in 2020.

We get exactly one life...do what you want, when you want, with who you want and don't worry about the circumstances...how bad can it be?  My advice to my younger friends.
Women...damn...you make me so fricking ' crazy....well, let's go to Disneyland :)
@krassenstein He is not suitable.  I'm kicking his ass
@CNN Good for them!  It's so frustrating to see so many rich people who won't share a fraction of their money with those in need....Thanks for the story.
@krassenstein I'm running for President just to get that AH out.  He is a liar, and he's out.
@SocialPowerOne1 He's a Republican.  There are no rules.
There's a saying..."Women, can't live  with them, can't live without them."  It's true.  Damn it :)
So I've been out in Cali for three days without my girl...friend.  She doesn't want to commit...well, damn woman...if I have a heart attack, it's on you....just kidding.  Get here so we can go to Disneyland and Huntington Beach.  This vacation is finally getting started :)
Okay, I'm getting worked up...no girlfriend and at Disneyland.  Damn.  Well, a girl who's my friend is coming out from AZ....so we're hitting Space Mountain at 2pm.  In the meantime, Def Leppard https://t.co/VsGid8kUeL
Another reason to vote for me....no lobbyists.  The NRA and the rest of those rich AHs can kiss my ass.  We are taking back our motherf...king country from you pricks.  Right f...king now.  Sorry for the profanity....no, not really :)
@realDonaldTrump @jtomka You look bad all on your own.  Please go away.  Far, far away.  We can't f...king stand you.
@amvetsupport I am running for President because I cannot f...king stand him.  This is over....in two years.
@PoliticalEmilia Republicans.  They are done from 2020 to 2028.  Enjoy the ride :)
@Amy_Siskind He is lying, lying and then when he's done lying, he lies.  I can't stand him.  He can lie to himself all he wants after I kick his ass in 2020.  And he'll probably lie about that.	e

@jenniferscully1 Love it!
So I come out to Anaheim to meet an adult film actress...don't judge...she's nice and very attractive....anyway, she bailed and my friend is coming out tomorrow so we'll be on Space Mountain by 3pm.  I love this state.   Time for breakfast....
@kazweida @LadyTitania46 I wish I could fix it, but the election isn't for two more years.  I'll tweet but in two years we will fix everything.  Guaranteed.
@HuffPost Texas....PLEASE vote Cruz out.  He is ugly....not judging but since it's both mental and physical, it's okay.  Send him home.  We have to fix so many f...king problems and idiots like him will not help.  Vote him out and give me someone who has a clue.  Thank you.
@davidmweissman My horrible Mom raised me GOP.  My wonderful ex Father in Law showed me the other side and it had compassion and kindness.  The GOP was just BS and hatred.  I will try to represent both as President but I do lean left.  The GOP needs to grow up and become human again IMO
@DogginTrump I need to punch something right now
It is 3:46am in Anaheim....my girlfriend gets here at one.   I am damn bored.  Well, more tweets, then Disneyland :)
Sorry 2000s, but we had some great fricking music in the 80s.  You need to catch up.  https://t.co/KF7bclD9KJ

Holy crap.  It is 4am in Anaheim and I want to kick someone's ....My girlfriend needs to get out here right now....Space Mountain and Indiana Jones amd watch her walk through people.   I''m so glad I'm here.
@Kokomothegreat @RebeccaLoftin @nypost How in the f..k do these AHs get elected?  Oh, yeah.  Rich/racist Republicans.  We need to make a change.  Right f...king now.  We are taking our motherf...king country back.  Sorry for the profanity...not really...it's appropriate.
Texas, help us...no more politics.  Let's pick the best person for the job and get this done.  We have six years.  Thanks. https://t.co/W66atnnJSL
@PoliticalEmilia @bo_bessa He is so damn stupid.  I cannot wait to debate him...get ready....it will be fun :)
@myserenity69 We NEED to win every race.  Vote and get your friends/family to vote (unless they're Republican, then tell them there is no election).  We need to fix everything they've f...ked up.
Damn...it's 3:23 am in Anaheim and my friend gets here at noon....well, tweet me.
@EroAngel2 Find someone else.  I'm available.
@CNN Do you want to go out???
@realDonaldTrump @WellsCharlene @WhiteHouse Can you please just go the f...k away.  We hate you.  Yes, hate you.  Go away now.
@PrisonPlanet Whatever.  Crime is crime.  It doesn't make Republicans better than Democrats.  Try something else.  You AHs are done.
@DisavowTrump20 @kyrstensinema And  three points, while okay is insane.  McSally sucks.  She plays up her "military service" and I don't believe it...she learned how to fly a fighter....she was not in a dogfight in Iraq.  Sinema is so much better.  Arizona, wake up, turn bluer.
@GGraphicsinc I made a few wrong turns, but somehow wound up back on the road :)
@SaltyCorpse It's all about balance
@Amy_Siskind Can he get more evil? What a MFAH.  I cannot wait to kick his ass.....sorry for the profanity,...not really.  There will be more at the debates.  Trump had get better to answering questions about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, because I will bring it up, over and over again
@madeleinereneee @sleeplikeababy1 I have three 20 year old kids and am ready to do it all over again.  I love being a dad.
@PoliticalEmilia We kick them the f..k out.  That's the only way they learn.
@RealMuckmaker Love it!  You know he'd make some crazy claim against his insurance.
Most of the songs I post are positive, but this one really states reality...sometimes life throws you a curveball that will either hit you hard or miss you if you're in charge. Be in charge....we have to  https://t.co/5KixnjlZDb
@A_19M65 Thank you.  Nice message.  We need to appreciate each other.  Take care and have a great day.
Damn, there are so many great songs....it's almost as if we've had hundreds of years for musicians to generate wonderful songs....when life hits hard, just chill and listen to your favorite songs.  I do.  It's the only reason I'm sane. https://t.co/EaVUU4r3CM
@funder @realDonaldTrump This sucks so do everything you can to help.  In the meantime, I'm running for President in 2020 and Trump is f...king done.  He may win a couple of hard red states but I will kick his ass; hard.  I don't even want to do this, but have to. He is done.
@RepJoeKennedy @BetsyDeVosED @MassAGO Two more years and this nightmare is over
@lonestarJakeyT Thank you for my second hearty laugh of the day!  Yup.  We had crappy "space food" and Tonka Toys...kids today don't know how good they have it
@alfranken F..k yeah.  You don't give nuclear codes to a third grader.  I can't get him out of office faster.
@Bratterina What kid of pizza?
OMG...I'm in California and it is fricking wonderful.  This place beats the hell out of my hometown...sorry hometown...I'll keep your identity hidden.  Be cooler, more tolerant and lean a little more left.  Just my opinion. :)
Here we go :) https://t.co/ljckztqyQB

@eortner Things happen and nobody expected that.  Don't judge yourself if that is what this tweet is about...just move forward.  Do something good for someone who needs help. We can't change the past but we can change the future
@krassenstein They all get fired in two years
Damn!  I'm at Disneyland and waiting for my date so I'm getting all worked up on Twitter.  It's the fricking happiest place on earth and I LOVE it here...I won't share her name but you know who you are...please get here. 	We need to go on Space Mountain
Stop this....call your Senator, House Member and stop this BS...we should not be bombing anyone...nobody is bombing us.

@youlooklikeamom @justsomegirl81 Chop chop  :)
I've harped on this before, but treat our friends in the Middle East with respect. We are all human beings sharing a planet and just have different religious beliefs, which is BS because so many died over religion. Make friends with them...I do... and you'll find we are the same.
@7ll6__ @pp_7700 @7ll2_ Thank you for the nice tweet.  I appreciate the message.  Take care.
@morningmoneyben @Magadelene58 I'm not wealthy but I will beat them both
@Amy_Siskind There's way more than that...we are fixing everything.
Damn...I'm worked up again and it's only 3:30pm.  Some idiot posts BS about a great black man and holds it against NFL players expressing their objections to police brutality...I did not hold back  When I get his response, he'll be blocked.  Chop chop
@mikandynothem @speedprayers @DineshDSouza @DonnaWR8 @KatTheHammer1 @DiamondandSilk @grizzlemeister @codeofvets @DonaldJTrumpJr @AMErikaNGIRLBOT @chuckwoolery @ArizonaKayte No.  BS.  THe NFL players are taking a stand against unjustified police brutality and murder.  Your comparison is BS.  Have a heart and try to understand what it is like to be killed, yes killed, for being black in a car.  Then show me your motherf..king picture, AH.   Go to hell
@SocialPowerOne1 Proves there's no God.
@Amy_Siskind It sucks but it's all over in 2020.  He is done
@KamalaHarris @mariefisher562 Call me.  480 532 3711...was that public?  Oh, well.
As a general reminder, I'm running for President as an Independent in 2020. I need campaign managers and petitioners in all 50 states for no pay unless we get donations.  If you want to help, message me.
@JoyceWhiteVance Liar liar pants on fire.  He can go f...k himself.  He blew off Puerto Rico and everyone knows it.  I can't wait to kick his ass in 2020

@Koonass3 You win the award for my first laugh of the day :)
@KikiAdine Damn straight.  Motherf...king idiot, to add an adjective.
@EdKrassen @NRA @SenatorCollins I will not take one penny from the NRA,  They will not like me.
@psychdr100 Trump's done.  If Mueller doesn't get him, I will.  This nightmare is over in 2020.

@JoeNBC Half of the frickin' country...come on Trump, just retire and give us all a break.  We have enough anxiety.  You can golf and we can sleep.
@LCNM99 Hard?   Uh, yeah.  That boy better be prepared :)
@wvjoe911 Mike Pence is an idiot.  If he succeeds Trump, I will crush him in 2020
@realDonaldTrump Duh.
@fluffykoalaa Do what it best for you...heaven or hell, all we know is we have one life.  Live it
@kaimxo I just walk into them, hard.  Teaches them some manners.
@trom771 Too racist...if they're not rich, they're racist.  That's his base
@W0nderW0manW0w @abi4205 Whatever it takes
Holy crap.  So I've been in Anaheim for two days with no friends...tomorrow the love of my life is coming out here and an actress since my love doesn't realize she loves me, so I'm going from no women to two, maybe three...damn.  Well, this should be interesting.  Don't judge :)
@briEdgerton @sleeplikeababy1 Enjoy it.  They grow up fast
@EdKrassen Yup
@counterchekist @CTO1ChipNagel @SenateDems Are there any honest Republicans???  This is so f...king crazy.  We need to stop these AHs.  Right f...king now.  So it's 2:35 am....I'm a little worked up.  Sorry.  Not really :)
@shannonrwatts @CTO1ChipNagel @NRA The NRA is going to hate me....let's go
@CTO1ChipNagel Sorry, but I can't wait to fire her
@Jessdaisy It's simple and complicated at the same time

@DanaScottLO @Grammitude55 @SenatorCollins Yes!  She's moderate and we need to keep that AH off the Supreme Court.  Put the pressure on.  I'm retweeting this.
@shannonrwatts @CTO1ChipNagel @NRA Things are going to change in two years.  Dana needs to find another job.
@krassenstein I'm not crazy to be President and giving up eight years of my life for insane stress is rough when I could just write movies...but, he is such a MFAH ruining this country and our reputation around the world...I have to...can we just have the election today? He is done.
@Desert_Musings Well, he knows you have his back
@politicususa @CTO1ChipNagel He needs to go away.  Now.  Damn, why do we have to wait two years?
@bryanbehar @CTO1ChipNagel Exactly.  It's never too late.
Another night awake with YouTube videos....at least I got some sleep earlier...Anaheim....thank you...this place is wonderful.  If you've never been to California, go now, if you can.  Nice people, wonderful weather, the beach, and so much to do...damn, I need to make more money
Despite promoting 90s/2000s harmonic rock, it really will be fairly easy to fix everything if elected. With no obligation to lobbyists or a political party, it will be eight years and we will fix everything. I like to joke but we have to do the right thing, now. Elect me
@thomaskaine5 @JjSeeli Rich and stupid
@mmfa She can (and will) go to hell
@EdKrassen Donald Trump has no guts.  He fakes it.
@krassenstein I used to think his IQ was in the double digits....I now think it may be in the single digits.
@shannonrwatts So horrific...and we as a country can't implement even the most simple gun control...that will f...king change.  No more.  This BS is over.....we cannot tolerate such unnecessary violence any more.
@justsomegirl81 Or mature, or empathetic.  Age and experience make most of us wise up
@KC_Sass I think that might be love, at least it is for me
@SillySassySmart Thanks for my second hearty laugh of the day :)
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews No it won't.  It will get better and you're taking credit for Obama's efforts...your actions will cause major destruction to the economy in the coming years.
@squirrel_life @WASBAPPIN @IGD_News We need to annex half of Syria and create a refuge, safe country for those people...and we could do it...easily.
@realDonaldTrump You're at fault more than anyone else.  Just frickin' retire already.  We can't STAND YOU!
@Stephen_AWeber @KamalaHarris @CTO1ChipNagel Yup...it's 105 in Phoenix...luckily I'm in Anaheim right now....76...damn, I need to move here.
@SocialPowerOne1 Idiot
Okay, so how many of my tweets have YouTube vids of my favorite songs...well, politics are stressful, so we have to keep it light.  :)  https://t.co/sIrq0uN712
So many people are suffering and nobody notices....I know...this was just few years ago and thank God, I recovered.  Watch for these signs in friends and family and let them know you care; you love them.  It's such a waste and can be prevented so easily with a little compassion https://t.co/BG9wZrpla2
@realDonaldTrump Nobody cares what you tweet.  Stop wasting your time and retire.
@TalbertSwan @shannon_crane Badge cameras on at start of a shift and off when they clock out....no way to turn them off.  It's sad because most police are wonderful people who protect us but a few bad cops screw everything up.
So ladies, I'm in California and have Kimmel tickets for 3pm today.  It will be fun...promise.  We'll do a Hollywood tour before.  I came out here to meet a date and she's late.  So humor me...I don't want to go alone...that would be, um, embarrassing.  I'll buy dinner too :)
Life can be so stressful...that's why we need silly old videos of great songs...turn off your brain for three minutes and just relax.  https://t.co/y9Va3jDZOI
@thinkprogress @joncoopertweets He's done.  I'm not sure how but I will figure something out.  MFAH bigot Republican.
@realDonaldTrump @SaraCarterDC @LouDobbs Liar, liar, pants on fire.
@fred_guttenberg @spfld62704 It's insane.  I went into a gun shop just to see how hard it would be.  I had a few issues that could/should have caused alarm...I was approve in four minutes.
@EricHolder @spfld62704 The Republicans are done.  There are not enough rich and/or racist voters (Republicans) to beat us.  We do need twice the votes since they cheat with gerrymandering and Russian collusion, but we will win this time.  They are through.  Guaranteed. We are taking back our MF country
@bolisa3 You're welcome.  It is inspiring how he is trying to help his mother.  I hope she recovers.
@AmoneyResists @AngelaV56633493 Can we just have the election today?  I want to kick his ass so bad
Having gone through this pain a few years ago, I really appreciate this song....it is so real...my understanding is this was based on the singer's real life experience with his brother.  Heartbreaking....things will get better, but we all need support. https://t.co/lGimANGB1q
Please help if you can.  Thank you. https://t.co/nLS1pv0GNp
@Sqrlmom @krassenstein Well, he's done.  He can lie all he wants.  I will kick his ass in 2020....I'm going for 50 states...he will be embarrassed and can go back to his resorts and cry while we fix everything....again.  My stretch goal is 80 million votes out of 120 million.  Done.
@TankCesar @SupernovaWicked I avoid my AH brother and ran into him at Disneyland a few years ago.... it sucked. Ruined our whole trip.  There was no way to avoid him and his family and we had to waste a day in Disneyland with those narcissistic AHs.  Well, never again. I don't care that they think.
@Sqrlmom @krassenstein Probably, but I read an article that was very funny about how he had to tell the truth under oath once and it was extremely difficult for him but he was afraid of the consequences since he was under oath.
@LCNM99 @esquire I'm taking him out.  I'm not sure how yet, but he is done....this will require some extreme cognitive effort.  Well, it's 3:37 am and my brain is on overdrive.  I'll come up with something.
Texans...please help.....Cruz is not a good person.  Vote in the best person for the job.  We will fix everything but we need people who have the heart to do the right thing. https://t.co/9TuIJ96cNl
@Mel__Lynn__ I block guys for death threats and women for bugging me for money.  Love blocking.
@patnspankme Life.  Just cut them off.  I did.  It's wonderful.  Cut all toxic people out of your life.  It's Xanax for the soul.
@toth14364013 @ja__114 Yes.  This will be a good year.  It's my best year ever.  Take care.
Okay, I'm in Cali with Jimmy Kimmel tix for tonight and my date is late...anyone want to go?  Bueller, Bueller?  DM me if you're in LA.  We will have fun...Hollywood tour before the show and Disneyland after.
@joncoopertweets @spfld62704 @mike_pence Thanks for my first laugh of the day!
@EllenKurz Will do.
@roxxyrolla1 Great tweet.  We don't say the things that are so important and get all wrapped up in BS.  Love the ones who are important and let them know you love them. Nothing is more important.
@aprilbaxter He's a pig and a liar.  He is done in 2020.  Guaranteed.
@KamalaHarris Please run with me.  We will win 50 states.  DM me.
@joncoopertweets Racist Republican?  Um, yeah.
@mell_hh @sleeplikeababy1 I used to call my kids "Daddy's Little Alarm Clock," because they would cry at 6am when I needed to get up for work.  I miss those days...I may start another family just to have kids again...enjoy it...they grow up fast.
@krassenstein I read an article about him testifying under oath for something else and having to tell the truth. It was hilarious.  He couldn't lie.  I'd love to see him testify again....trying desperately not to lie. Can't wait.
@MissMolly3286 Their priorities are insane.  It's extreme narcissism.  They are done.  We are taking this country back.
@funder @CTO1ChipNagel @realDonaldTrump I cannot f..kng wait to kick him out of office.  Two more years.
@skittle624 It was a horrific day. We need to seek peace and understanding with the Middle East to prevent this from ever happening again.
So I missed the Def Leppard concert in Phoenix...poor planning.  They play in San Diego September 23rd, two days before my 42nd birthday (I stopped counting at 42 :).  Time to go to San Diego.https://t.co/HEOFnxsmpl
So I'm in Cali without a date.  Anyone want to go to Disneyland?  Or Kimmel tomorrow?  I love it here :)
All the hatred between countries based on religion is insane...they're made up. Nobody knows the truth...we just read books written years ago and assume that's reality. I have many followers from the Middle East and Twitter translates. They are just like us. Stop the hate, please
@Sara7_Hd @s___ss3 Thank you.  I appreciate your message.   I do the same.  We need to practice ignorance sometimes just to get by.  Have a wonderful day today.  Take care :)
Donald Trump is not above the law.  He may think he is, but his time is limited.  He are kicking him out.  Goodbye, Mr. President.  Go the f..k away.  We don't like you. https://t.co/UeEmzSkvgo
@SocialPowerOne1 Sean Hannity is an idiot.  Just sayin'
Holy crap!  I"m in Cali....:)....this state is so wonderful.  Great weather, the beach, Disneyland, Universal, Hollywood and some of the nicest people I've ever met.  It's expensive to live here, but, um. I'm house shopping :)
@Stephen_AWeber @KamalaHarris @CTO1ChipNagel Will do
@jadedjcBXNYC @cnnbrk I didn't read that.  If it was justified, so be it.  I just hate the gun stories....guns do kill people.  Look at Japan and Australia...gun violence there is nothing compared to the US.  We are the most violent country in the world and easy access to guns is part of the problem
When life throws us some curve balls, music helps.  There are so many great songs that my inauguration will be three days long to get through the play list.  This is one of the songs...https://t.co/PDkPxlRWar
Why do some younger guys abuse women?  A good friend of mine, maybe future wife, was beaten and cut by some 20-year old punk  Huh?  She's beautiful, mentally and physically and this kid beats her and her AH parents don't help. I saved her, but still want to kick his ass.  Now
Music keeps us sane, IMO.  While Def Leppard is the best band of all time, I do like other singers.  Pink had a song a few years ago that said it all.  It still keeps me sane https://t.co/ytiWBU2Iiz
@TeaPainUSA Damn, he's stupid!   I would feel sorry for him, but, well, since he's such a MFAH, even though he's probably the product of a neglectful dad, I can't.  I was the product of an abusive mom and I made it work.  He need to grow up
@RiderofWolves Don't.  Ever.   I had the same feeling a year ago and it went away
@jennloverde Is Dad a bad guy?  If not, let him have his time...he will love you more for it later.  But if Dad is a bad guy, keep him safe
@Mookyluv2 @denhamon That speech was incredible....it made Trump look so f...king bad without even mentioning his name.  I miss Obama so much that I am running for President just to do what he did...lead this country for the people, not for the rich.  I wonder if he gives speech lessons
@thistallawkgirl @denhamon He does need a man bra
@RealMuckmaker @denhamon "Where do you get the cheeseburgers, here?"
@PradRachael @WalnutDrummer All caps is a little overboard.  You're wrong, we're right.  Goodbye.
@Brasilmagic I would vote against him just because he's ugly.  I don't want to see that face, or Trumps, ever again.
@TopRopeTravis @spfld62704 Tucker Carlson can go to hell
@EdKrassen Great idea.  When I kick him out of office, we will take care of all vets and build immigration centers along the border....every 50 miles there will be a place south americans can go to apply for asylum.  There will be hotel rooms in each place while we vet them
Okay, Cali, I'll be out there for a month.  Give me good weather and short lines at Disneyland.
Okay,  this is long but very fhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs2RlZQVXBUunny.  Pence is an idiot like  his boss and John Oliver nails it in this monologue.
@joncoopertweets I'll be using this one :)
@CallSignSiren Yup.  I do it daily
@tweetmommybop @bo_bessa I'm working on it  :)
@Amy_Siskind I'd say unbelieveable but it is believeable.
@AMluvinit2 @bo_bessa I've got nothing.  He did marry Steve Mnunchin to his trophy wife, if that counts.  https://t.co/L0xAsJTjsV
@RealMuckmaker He is so disgusting, physically and mentally
Handy tip...if you're going to be arrested, don't have your kids bail you out.  They'll be pissed.  Well, moving on :)
@StephiHill @jennloverde To Target I go
@adelamusic George Clooney
@Brasilmagic @PaulaMauller It makes no sense
@Amy_Siskind Republicans are evil. We are taking them out.
@krassenstein @Sararenolds2 It's a delayed reaacion. Trump is going down and if anyone in San Fran cam put us up for a couple days, that woul be great.
@RealMuckmaker Will do if I remember
@kenolin1 @WatchingWhatYou He's done with Trump and all their minions.  Two more years;....max
@Asterix991 @MsDebbieKingKe1 Okay
Holy crap,  'Batman!  These women are all over me/  Well. just accept them until the right one comes along.  Okay
@_poemquotes @TravelLaxt Show me yours first
@KenGoldsholl @Amy_Siskind The GOP needs to go.
OlKy...so I've overstated this.  Republicans.   You are through.  We are taking our MF country back.   Get another job.   You are done.
@wvjoe911 Ted Cruz is an AH.     Vote him out.
@realDonaldTrump You're an idiot.   Just retire and let us fix your mistakes.
@RobinSzalanski @misguidedgent It sucks.  We are meant for one person, but if that person doesn't reciprocate, we settle.  I have so many choices, which is wonderful, but want only two women.  One wants me, the other one doesn't know what she wants
@coleyworld Get the f..k out AH.
If you retweet something and I send a mean message, it is meant for the original poster.   This social media is just too much work for my brainl
@W7VOA @jmreycroft @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Go to hell, AH.
@RoryWainer @spfld62704 @DonaldJTrumpJr Damn.  He is so ugly.  Physically and mentally.  He is out.  ASAP
@SebGorka @jtomka @BarackObama Bengazi was an Obama/Hillary mistake.  They had good intentions but attacked a country and it's water supply.  I won't make that mistake.  We will fix everything.
@thehill He'd better be disappointed.  He's out of a job in 2020.
@jadedjcBXNYC @CanadaTweetBoi @cnnbrk I'm following so many stories I can't keep up. Bottom line....whoever is right gets my support
@krassenstein Trump is done.  I'm going to kick his ass.  Sorry for the profanity, not really.  I don't need to do this, but Trump is such an embarrassment to our country, I'm taking him out.  The debates will be fun.  If he's coked up, that will make it more fun.  :0
@maydaymindy9 @Magadelene58 You win the award for my first laugh of the day  :)
@Dax_x98 @Magadelene58 You have a great Mom.  I hope she's okay, but be prepared, just in case.
@BarbraStreisand @freedom4all4321 Because they're the GOP.  Greatless, Opportunistic, Pricks.
@John3_and_16 @DRUDGE Damn! He's old in his 40s?  Oh, yeah, I'm perpetually 42 :)
Holy crap.  It's 6:11 am in AZ and I have 100 messages.  Well, something to do :)
@FoxNews @VP Pence can go to hell, and will.
@WineMummy @herprettybones I hate creamy everything except ice cream.
@Amy_Siskind @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins Excuse me if I've already said this...if there is any way I can prevent him from being nominated, I will.  It seems like moderate Republicans need to be swayed.  We need everyone to contact them.  There are only five to my knowledge.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He's losing supporters, thank God.  His base of rich/racist AHs is shrinking.  We are taking him out.  Finally.
@jenniferscully1 @G_Paknowsbest I disagree.   I'm running just because I can't stand what he's doing to this country.  I can make millions writing movies so this is an inconvenience.  But he needs to go and I am kicking him out.  Have a nice day.  :)
@goldengateblond @CTO1ChipNagel @TuckerCarlson Okay
@politico Vote for him.  We need every Democrat we can get to fix the mess the Republicans made....again.  This is a vicious cycle.
@ThePeoplesJesus @skittle624 No church, no football.  Women and California....I have my priorities.  :)
@Bob_Janke @skittle624 Husky?  That was embarrassing.
@SuperSeizer @sleeplikeababy1 I sleep two or three hours a day.  You just need to be so busy that 22 hours is the minimum to get things done  :)
@ASlavitt @joncoopertweets Love it!  Ethics over money
@cnnbrk This has to stop, or at least minimized.  The cameras on their vests need to go on as soon as they start and they cannot have the ability to turn them off. We have so many great police that the bad ones just f..k everthing up. Cameras on.
@KamalaHarris @CTO1ChipNagel I was on a jury where a driver merged and knocked a car across the road, killing both the mother and grandmother.  It was emotional and I solved the case because a hispanic witness said he saw the truck hit the car through a translater.  The lawyers didn't get it, but I caught it
@mamapojo @AnnCoulter There is humanity.  Sometimes it's hard to find.
@krassenstein He is so done.  I don't even need to try, but will anyway.  It is insane that this country elected such a stupid MF ass...le.  We are done.  Republicans...take a break.  You're out until 2029.  We need to fix all your mistakes....again.
@lasergirl70 @mamapojo Good for you!  I'm a 55 year old man and have my original face, although I had a skin cancer removed from my head and got an unexpected face lift when they repaired me.  It was a bonus, now I look 45  ;)
@CTO1ChipNagel @TheWeek He's an ass...le.  If I can't take him out, we'll do without the Supreme Court.  With the Presidency and Congress, we don't need them.
@K8Logan @CTO1ChipNagel That's good but we need to start helping, not killing.  We are the terrorist country.  That will change in 2020.  We will annex countries where people need sanctuary and we will not bomb anyone who has not attacked us.  This is so easy.  Let's go.
@Amy_Siskind @SenSasse Kavanaugh is done....I'm not sure how, but I'm motivated.  The Republicans are done...at least until 2028...then they can screw everything up again.  That's the pattern.
I want to punch somebody.  Is that wrong?  Starting with Trump, then Pence, then Ryan....or maybe I just become President and fire all of them.  Not as rewarding as giving them a black eye, but if that's the path, let's go :)
Damn!  I'm all worked up and it's only 5:06am.  Well, a little Def Leppard to cool off and then we take out the Republicans.  Run AHs.  We are taking our country back.
@TomthunkitsMind @CTO1ChipNagel @realDonaldTrump They are all getting fired when I'm President
@GlennThrush @angry_gram He's wrong.  Way wrong.  Let's go.
@Amy_Siskind Republicans are through.  I'm a little worked up at 5;03 in the morning in AZ.  It's time.  We are taking this country back.
@nowthisnews @CTO1ChipNagel @BarackObama Barack...great speech.  You need to help us, which is apparent and it looks like you're on board.  I need to get elected President and we need a Democratic House and hopefully Senate.  You're very popular, so we would appreciate any help you can give.  Let's do this
Another song to start the day....https://t.co/KNdFctYvrM
Wow.  4:51 am and it's starting all over again.  This is one weird life.  Women, fame...the price is high. But it's fun and along the way we'll solve all the world's problems.  Bucket list, let's get started  :)
@KamalaHarris @CTO1ChipNagel I met a driver in therapy and it's true.  They are monitored electronically 24/7.  Could you handle that?  I couldn't.  We need to help them.
@CREWcrew @penneyewart Trump is done.  He can try to fight it, but we have the power of the people.  Are you listening Trump?  Retire.  NOW.  Or you will be very embarrassed by the worst loss in Presidential history or our debates.  What happened at Jeffrey Epstein's place in 1994?  I'm bringing it up
@TheLoneWolF_1 @MoniTorres_Team This reminds me of an old cartoon..."Stimpy, you idiot!"  Republicans can go to hell, which they are anyway.  This insanity will stop for the next ten years.  Then I can relax.  :)
@Mean_Adam @1SnoozyQ Big time.  Everyone needs to vote, especially if you're younger.  We can't fix this without you.  Republicans cheat and then we clean it up.  We need to clean up, right now.
@mamapojo @AnnCoulter Please don't hesitate.  Say what you feel.  :)
How do you get a shiner and not remember....I'm not sure, I don't remember but have a big shiner on my left eye...first stop today....the store for sunglasses.  :)
I need to kick an abuser's ass.  Did I say that online?  It must be early....I'll mellow out as the day goes on.  :)
@IronStache @bo_bessa @realDonaldTrump This is the insanity we live in.  He just did what he had to do to get the information he needed.  If elected, I'm going to outlaw being Republican.  If you're Republican, you get deported.  How is that any worse than anything they've done?  Sorry, I'm worked up :)
@thehill They're losing the House, hopefully the Senate and definitely the Presidency.  We are taking our f...king country back.  Have a nice day, Republicans.  You're through.
@ShellHasNoName The original stories were scary.  I watched a horrible movie as a kid that was based on these fairy tales.  It was horrific.  Now I just watch comedies and listen to harmonic rock.  Much better  :)
@joncoopertweets If that works, go for it.  He needs to go.
@patriotmckenzie @richard2380 We need to put the bigots in the military to learn this.  Thanks for your post and your service.
@MacCocktail @rachelhunterx Well, we're men.  If you can be with a woman in her 20s or 30s and she has a brain and personality, why not?  I'm not admitting anything, but I may be pursuing multiple FLOTUS candidates.  Or they're pursuing me.  It's confusing :)
@thehill Without money would this idiot be anything?  I'm sorry, I don't judge.  Maybe he's a nice guy.  You go Jared.  Find happiness.
@wesley_jordan @CTO1ChipNagel Two more years.  Then we fix all their mistakes so they can take over again in eight and f...k everything up again.  It's a vicious cycle.
I missed the Phoenix concert last night...damn.  Well San Fran the end of the month.  https://t.co/h7EoFD4EVB
@1__5ll @ja__114 Thank you.  Great message.
@_SJPeace_ Is someone keeping track?....she goes to Bigot Island in two years...any lawyers out there?  How can we do this legally?  Deport all bigots
@AryaResists As much as I can't stand him, it is clearly his upbringing.  He wasn't loved and never will be.  But we can't pay for that.  He needs to deal with it.  I wasn't either and turned out very different from him.
@LouiseMensch @TurnKansasBlue @BarackObama Hell yeah.  It's time for this hypocrite to go home
Another morning. More tweeting and Def Leppard on YouTube.  Welcome day :)
@FoxNews So instead of parading them, they are back in their launch silos?
@BenSasse Republicans aren't very smart....just a generalization.  Based on my experience, their priorities are themselves and racism.  Go figure.  Well, I'm taking them out for eight years.  Time to fix things.
@thehill What a MF idiot.  We can't get rid of him fast enough.
With social media, we can make friends with anyone anywhere....I've found many friends in the Middle East.  Once Twitter translates, it's clear they're just like us. They're not terrorists, just humans on the same planet as us.  If we stop killing, we'll be friends. No more hate
Well, 3;44am.  Time to wake up :)
@JusticeTrolls Another one going to "Bigot Island."  Can someone keep track of these people for me?  They are all out of our country when I'm President or they can start behaving like adults now.
@thehill He should be, and scared.  His career in politics is over.  Obama will crush him and so will I
@Goss30Goss Boycott him
So much is happening I just need Def Leppard to cool it off.   After 40 years, they still put out good new music. No other band can do that...https://t.co/a2EtHYT5tI
@WalnutDrummer @45_Kimmie Okay
How can a band that's been around over 40 years still turn out music so good?  Well, they do.  https://t.co/eIC3CTg30v
@espinsegall @cindycrum She disappeared in December 2016.  And our f...king President dodged another public embarrassment bullet.  I'm not holding back.  He needs to quit, right f...king now.  I'll beat Pence in 2020 and we'll fix everything.
@45_Kimmie @WalnutDrummer Don't judge AH.  He stated his mind...it's a first amendment right.  Go to hell and have a nice day :)
@YourMomsucksTho That was me and then life threw some crazy punches.  Enjoy normalcy.  I want a real life but am embedded in a surreal one.  It's insane.
@kylegriffin1 Um, I don't like Ted Cruz.  Nobody with a brain does.  He is done.  We are taking back our f...king country, right f...king now.
@Alyssa_Milano Kavanaugh is worth not one second of my time, but I understand your point.  I can't control what's going on with him so I just need to let it go.  If we appoint a Republican AH to the Supreme Court, so be it. We will have the other two branches
@LDsquidtastic Good for you!  Keep it up.  Take care.
@curlymalloy I'd better not cry?  Christmas song :)
@espinsegall @cindycrum We'll be talking a lot about his friendship with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged rape of a 13-year old.  How is this MFAH our President???  He is f...king done.  https://t.co/8f6ZNYT4r5
@Eutecia I've heard that some scripts work really well.  But in my experience, it is just stress relief...let go of all the anger and unhappiness and cut off everyone toxic.  Then you can rest.  Otherwise, Xanax :)
@KamalaHarris Done
@realDonaldTrump I'm going to kick your ass in 2020.  Stop the bragging. You won because Hillary had a lot of the same probs as you and Putin interfered. Retire now, before you go down in history as the President who lost by an insane landslide.  Enjoy your retirement, Mr. President.  You're done
@mirenamst @sleeplikeababy1 You can sleep when you're, um, not living.  In the meantime, treat it as found time.  I sleep two hours a night and have 22 hours to live life.
@RawStory @denhamon Is this the same Ted Cruz whose college room-mate told some gross stories about him?  Or the same Ted Cruz who accidentally posted his porn search on Twitter?  I don't forget. Sure, I'll listen to him.  He can go to hell. Do not pass go, do not collect $200
@lor_knibbs @ChrisMurphyCT Yup.  Most of what we pay for health care goes to execs....I used to work in Executive Compensation...I know.  They have easy goals and are paid even if they miss their goals.  Universal health care is far more efficient and while doctors may not make as much, they get paid
@Eutecia @sleeplikeababy1 Melatonin, earplugs and cut all toxic people out of your life.  You can sleep then.  If not, benzos
@C_3C_3 @WalnutDrummer He is helping us take our country back and doing a pretty damn good job.
Damn!  I knew it would be lopsided but this is insane.  Well, Obama can't run so I'm doing it.  Trump seems to have a popularity problem.  I'm making him retire. https://t.co/knnh3FzrWM
@Goss30Goss Lincoln and maybe Eisenhower were the only respectable Republicans.  The rest are POS AHs who cater to their rich or racist base.   How that party can survive is amazing, but they do have help from the Russians.  No more.
@fatttydaddy7 @kerouac741 I have to block so many AHs.  Why do Republicans turn to violence and threats when they are losing an argument?  Just go the f...k away.  I will remember these guys when I'm the Prez...they'd better not have anything they can be arrested for :)
@americawins49 @WalnutDrummer If Carrey doesn't like Trump, he wins in my book.  Leave him alone
@100_Disable_vet The whole thing is so insane.  How Republicans can even get 35% of the vote is amazing, but they have help from the Russians and gerrymandering. We are taking back our motherf...king country. Right f...king now.  Have a nice day :)
@shannonrwatts Wear what you want.  Check out people in sunny states.  There are no rules.
@espinsegall @cindycrum I will figure out a way to beat him...public embarrassment seems most likely
@KC_Sass And vice versa :)
@oceanaveoutfit @songslap Are you busy Friday?  Or any day?
@SaysHummingbird Surprise, surprise.  I'm sending him pix of mine and will have them posted everywhere he looks.  He needs to go the f...k away and I am making him go :)
@AlamoOnTheRise Can we go into the negative????
@WatchingWhatYou @SenSchumer Hell yes.  The one thing the Republicans do better than the Democrats is play evil.  We have to take them on with both gloves
@kathygriffin @SammyAce17 You made a miscalculation....he's pure evil.  It's karma
@ChrisEvans It was his best speech in my opinion.  He knocked the ball out of the park.
@news_national @laughingbudhdha Five times a day???
@RudyGiuliani Please retire and take your boss with you.  You're both kind of incompetent...just enjoy life without working.  We won't mind.
@marshawright I work at making dreams come true
@AC360 The best Presidential speech we've heard since 2016
@DeaconJohnwell @SammyAce17 I don't usually judge but he is an ugly ugly man.
@BrunoAmato_1 @rainbow101071 Thank God.  The Republicans had to screw up royally to lose control of the Executive and Legislative branches.  And they did.  Things are going to change in 2020
@realDonaldTrump Whatever.  Please just retire.
@aravosis @denhamon You get the award for my first laugh of the day...(R-Moscow).  I almost missed that.  Love it :)
@iamLucretiaMott He's a lying bovine.  Hopefully enough Republicans will join the Democrats to send that AH home
@SaysHummingbird I'm not sure the legality, but as President I want to start "Bigot Island," a place where bigots are deported to and can never come back.  It's on the agenda :)
@PrimroseFang @SethAbramson Thanks!
@chelseahandler @VanessaHeard6 She needs to ditch Trump now and take whatever she can.  Their marriage is a sham and we all know it
@PattyArquette @PrimroseFang Our laws favor the rich.  That will change in 2020
@SethAbramson @PrimroseFang I don't golf.  We can cut that out of the budget in 2020
@DESilvia9 @SammyAce17 I'm fairly masculine but I almost cried.  Such a great speech.  We haven't had real leadership since he left. That is changing in 2020.  Obama can't run so I'm doing it.  Trump is done.  Period.
Carla Maloney, Carla Maloney, Carla Malony.  If you vote in her state, she needs to go. https://t.co/hPRL2MiyB4
@Shareblue Huh???  A Republican cheating?   Um, yeah, that's the unwritten part of their platform.
@Zac_Petkanas @seekerwisdom1 Republicans....do your f...king jobs.  This guy isn't qualified.  Get someone who has a clue and isn't insanely biased.  You're just making it easier for us to vote you all out.  Wake up.
@Amy_Siskind @tr_williams Good for him!  It just demonstrates how desperate Trump is for admirers.
@Libertea2012 Didn't he have three clients?  Let him sue  Avenatti will crush him
@herprettybones @Kryzazy Substitute him for her and I'm right there with you
@kylegriffin1 @2_Eyre_Is_Human Didn't he say he wouldn't be playing golf like Obama when he was President???  Did he lie?  Donald Trump?
@ellievan65 @denhamon @MotherJones Greed.  College will be affordable when I'm President and college execs may be mildly upset.
@MKGenest @denhamon I'm taking him out
@MarkYoungTruth @WalnutDrummer Okay, is this a retweet or your opinion?  Trump is the worst President ever and Obama did a pretty damn good job cleaning up after Bush.  When will the Republicans learn?  Yes, I know, never.  Well, we're taking back our f...kng country
@Emolclause @jeanpmuller People....this is the list.  Vote them out.  We have the voters; we just need every single voter to turn out.  This will end if we all stick together and do what we have to do.
@mitchellnicola @lor_knibbs @realDonaldTrump Thank you.  I will personally kick him out of office in 2020 and then it would be great if you could let me visit.  But keep him out.  He's an embarrassment to our nation
@shannonrwatts @denhamon @NRA She's an as...hole.
@restaurant_mom When I'm President, body cams on all officers will be active as soon as they start a shift and cannot get turned off.  It may not fix everything, but it will record the problems. A lot of good officers are tarnished by a few bad ones. No more
@foxandfriends @CanaryAmerica @TomiLahren And he is exactly right
@krassenstein It's all typical Republican BS to change a first amendment right into something against veterans and the flag.  Anyone with a brain knows the Republicans are just playing people.  Well, they are having less and less to play. They're out.
@FoxNews No, Trump is claiming credit for Obama's success.  There is a delay.  We will need to fix all of Trump's mistakes in 2020.  Read the history, biased news network.
@Amy_Siskind I just need two votes for every Trump vote to counter Russian interference and gerrymandering.  No prob.  Trump is out in 2020.  Take that, Mr. Putin.
@realDonaldTrump You are such an idiot.  Please just go away and let us fix all your mistakes.
@The_UnSilent_ @joncoopertweets Another person I'm sending to "Bigot Island."  Does anyone have a big island to sell to the U.S. government in 2020?  We're making some changes :)
@davidhogg111 @2_Eyre_Is_Human Agreed.  He's out in 2020

Every once in awhile this political stuff can get stressful...that's when it's time for music from one of the most enduring bands in history.  Okay, I'm biased.  https://t.co/wL9XtvKlaO
@nightlypolitics @Sherry55923389 @realDonaldTrump Um, no f...king way.  I plan to take him out....somebody has to.  The debates will be fun.... :)
@SoulStealer25 @2_Eyre_Is_Human He is out of here in two years max.  America just had a brain freeze in 2016
@BetteMidler Is that a trick question?  Well, Trump of course.
@cakickboxher @KC_Sass Um, there are at least three types...but I'm not judging :)
@B1rdog @auvi_lu Someone bring him another Diet Coke
@FoxNews @RepDeSantis That's fine...then everyone needs to resign
@BooBooRx @jmreycroft The NRA is not giving me one f...king dime.  I will return it, even if I have to finance my campaign by myself.
@SenFeinstein @denhamon Does Donald Trump just purposely pick the worst f..king people for every job????
@Adyaces @CArmanthegirl Just walk fast :)
@SenatorLeahy @jeanpmuller Not surprising
Please vote!  And if you're younger, get registered...you only need to be 18 by election day.  This is important. https://t.co/0cNwuo32HP
@amvetsupport By us, of course.
@moodymeg01 Do you need my email address???
@ChrisMurphyCT If Socialism is making sure every citizen has health insurance, then so be it.  Our model is far more expensive and rewards insurance company execs.  The Republicans can go to hell, which they will anyway if they don't wise up.
@HillReporter Um, yes
@krassenstein He is finally done.  It's just insane it took this much BS to get a few of his followers to join the rest of us who've known all along what a disaster he was/is.
@EdKrassen Hate is finally getting what it deserves
@pilgrimage222 @thomaskaine5 And a racist
@thomaskaine5 Yup, except Lincoln
@lorettamiller01 He is clearly  a lying scumbag
@PennyCarrigan1 @chrislhayes Hypocrites
@jackiewise21 @BarbraStreisand He is done
@EndDeportations @juney57 No. It's wrong.
@ali_scarmel @Jessica33832170 @Trumptbird If you don't trust our MSM move to Russia
@Libertea2012 No refunds AH
@glenn87027633 I agree but I will do it since we can't have Barack
@bbResistancebb @IndivisibleNet @realDonaldTrump No
@IndivisibleNet @denhamon @realDonaldTrump They are idiots
@RJNewsflash Go away
@Teri_Kanefield @Lady_Sisyphus22 Win
@MichaelAvenatti Do you want to be Attorney General?  I would appreciate it
@donnadevlin976 @SolarEdges @notonboard Maybe if you were fleeing gang violence with your kids you would feel differently.  Please leave our country.  You clearly don't deserve to be here, or adjust that bigoted attitude and get a heart
@RealMuckmaker When I am President, there will be a "Bigot Island," from which prisoners can never leave.  I'm not sure how to pull it off, but this b...ch would be going there on a speedboat.
@Amy_Siskind Sweet!  It just keeps getting better and better :)
@krassenstein Wonderful speech
Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.  You both did great yesterday...we need to talk about the election.  Please DM me and I'll send you my number.  Thank you.
@JoyceWhiteVance He is wonderful, so we need to learn from him.
@40acresofShade @VanessaHeard6 @sophietylenol @AndrewHWalker @sonofnels When I'm President, we may need to re-instate reform schools for idiots...just check the ledgers from Trump rallies :)
@real_farmacist Send this idiot home
@FoxNews @BarackObama Damn great speech
@Amy_Siskind He did a nice job.  I could learn from him on the public speaking.
@ChocoHarveyMilk Please Dems...keep it up and let's get the handful of ethical Republicans to send this idiot home.
@empiricalgirl Yeah, define "accomplishments."  I guess that now means "failures."
@Amy_Siskind Can anyone prove he even attended college and didn't just pay someone for his papers and tests....I can't find any proof except one Professor saying he was an idiot.
@SaysHummingbird @26thousandEARS She needs to go away, along with Mr. Trump
@SaysHummingbird @26thousandEARS Just slightly illegal...par for the course for this administration
@imillhiser @Demonoid55 Yes, he is.
@BarbraStreisand @Demonoid55 It's insane.  We need a law to prevent it.
@Amy_Siskind That would be hilarious.   If I could draw, I'd do it.  Someone could make a fortune with that and you need a cut for thinking of it  :)
@BaculumKing @Amy_Siskind @tardigrade18 Yup.  It happens every single  election.  They screw it up and we fix it for them to  screw up again.
@empiricalgirl @Amy_Siskind Money
@Amy_Siskind He's done and he's doing it to himself.
@Michael36776349 @denhamon Forget impeachment....he just needs to go to jail or a mental hospital.
@thehill Um, no.
@SenKamalaHarris @CTO1ChipNagel You were spectacular.  Please be my running mate (or vice versa).
@IndivisibleNet @auvi_lu Drugs will do that to you
@TheChickLivesOn @2_Eyre_Is_Human Trump has taken this country back 40 years on Civil Rights.
@krassenstein It's a big word and he cheated (allegedly) in school and probably never learned it.
@restaurant_mom Sadly, don't care.  But when their girls grow up, many will realize their parents are political idiots.
@treasonstickers We will fix everything, like we do every eight years.  When will the Republicans learn....never unfortunately....rich, racist, idiotic.  What a base.
@Squanch_Me Mr. President....you're done.  Go away, far away.
@SaysHummingbird It's called the Trump Foundation because all donations go to Trump :)
@Goss30Goss The law needs to be changed to remove incompetent Presidents.  Impeachment isn't working.  Turn it over to the people for a petition
@The_UnSilent_ She gets deported to Bigot Island when I'm President.
@Amy_Siskind It's narcissism, paranoia, misogyny, idiocy and so many more negative adjectives Twitter won't allow enough characters.
@Alyssa_Milano It's finally happening.  Thank God.  Why it had to come to this, though, is insane.
@EdKrassen Love it.  The first amendment is alive and well.
@coton_luver @realDonaldTrump Not a surprise
@EdKrassen He's got a few other things to worry about
@Acosta @RiderofWolves RIP Burt.
@shannonrwatts They all need to go. There are so few honorable Republicans in Congress, it is unbelievable.  Let's tally the number of ethical Republican Congress members and the number of out-of-touch idiots.  I'm guessing the ratio is 1 in 100, if even that high.
@joncoopertweets As an analogy, if a secret informant turns in a criminal, the criminal could order the police to arrest the secret informant.  Insane.
@EdKrassen @thehill It's great, but it's also insane it took this long.  We all knew (except his rich/racist base) from the beginning.
@SocialPowerOne1 So Donald Trump could rob a bank and as long as he brings the money back, he gets credit for solving the crime????  Hannity, please join Trump in going away....far away.
@NYinLA2121 @TXsnark7 They're already changing the locks.  Sweet :)
@Amy_Siskind Sounds good :)
@RiderofWolves Mine's not going too bad for being in the hospital :)
RT @Alyssa_Milano: Patriots! Let’s show @CoryBooker our appreciation by getting this to trend!		#IStandwithBooker
@Amy_Siskind It doesn't.  Time for a change.
@art_bosch @kuhn_marty He was a much better President than he got credit for
@Talktome81 We're trying
@krystalball @WildwoodFlower7 Rich or racist.  The Republican base.
@joncoopertweets Good for them.  I'm glad I own a Ford.
@KamalaHarris Do you want to be my running mate or vice versa?
@CharlesMBlow Insane
@chelseahandler @countable If you want to support me, that would be great.  You seem to have the Midas touch.  @pwood42
@summerlvn82 @YourMomsucksTho Amazingly and gratefully mine is peaking now  :)
@RealMuckmaker Pence?  Could it be????  Nah.
@angry_gram No, They never will.  Their priorities are the rich, not the people.
@realDonaldTrump Try to embrace some world leaders who are not dictators and murderers.  Your priorities are messed up.  Embrace our allies and use caution with people like Jim Jong and Putin.  Your priorities seems confused, sir.
@trom771 Done.  I'm quitting actually.
@Amy_Siskind Well, hopefully we win Congress and the Presidency.
Time to shut down folks...see you in the am
@noaccountlurker @Artinsimplicity Okay
@SmileMattyD @Artinsimplicity I listen...how else can we communicate?  I know, a lot of guys don't and they don't, um, I'm stopping right there :)
@andyharnik @Alien_Visitor_2 @realDonaldTrump @AP Kavenaugh has a very punchable face...just sayin.
@RVAwonk @nikkihaley We just need to annex half of Syria with our incredible military might and take in everyone who needs safety.  Bombing doesn't fix anything and if we're not bombing, we're letting Russian do it.  This is not hard.
@Alien_Visitor_2 Vets need every dollar we can spend on them and decent hospitals.
@smein101 @Alyssa_Milano We'll find a way and if we have to give up a branch of government, the judicial branch can go.  We'll still fix everything, so the Republicans can screw it up again in 2029.  By that time, I'll be writing movies and pretending to be 45 :)
@LuvMultimedia @Palovan @bolisa3 @PoliticalEmilia No bombing the Middle East, cut the defense budget, help all countries, end homelessness, cut taxes on the bottom 90% invade Switzerland &amp; the Cayman Islands and get every dollar rich people hide, and universal health care.  That's the first 90 days
Damn....how bad can you tweet Trump without getting the Secret Service involved?  I'm about to find out...and he'll be crying himself to sleep tonight :)
@realDonaldTrump Nobody likes you.  Sorry, President Bully.  You're through.
@LuvMultimedia @Palovan @bolisa3 @PoliticalEmilia No bombing the Middle East, cut the defense budget, help all countries that need it, end homelessness, cut taxes on the bottom 90%, invade Switzerland &amp; the Cayman Islands and get every dollar rich people hide there...and  universal health care.  Those are the big ticket items.

@Artinsimplicity @jennloverde And I'm also in love with her....but she only loves me.  Damn.
@WPrunier045 @Alyssa_Milano Yes, it's wishful thinking.  But we have to hope.  If not, we still get two of the three branches of government in 2020.  That's not bad.
@KatieStorer4 @Alyssa_Milano Well, it'w worth a try.  He needs every Republican vote and Pence to get in....I'll call the reasonable ones tomorrow...there are five that I know of.
@cashelgates @Reuters @jeanpmuller @ReutersTV And they're tiny feet, BTW.
@fred_guttenberg @mamapojo If there is anything I can do to help, let me know.  I will retweet this and lobby Jeff Flake to vote against Kavanaugh.  He won't make it without 51 votes.
@Talktome81 @RiderofWolves My first laugh of the day.  Congratulations!
@Artinsimplicity @jennloverde Yup....I was worried about my friend and she was worried about me and it took us two weeks to check on one another....okay, I was more irresponsible, but still, I'm a guy.  It's one of our weak links :)
@brithume It baffles my mind how ANYONE can support that idiot...but my parents do...wealthy, racist....those are his two core segments.  He is done in 2020...I cannot wait to debate him...Epstein, Putin...it's all on the table.  I want to make him cry :)
Everyone...we need this.  Republican gerrymandering and Russian interference mean we need two votes for every Republican vote.  Get out and vote, especially you 18 year olds...let's clean up this mess.  Thanks. https://t.co/3TI1GUmIgP
@Reuters @jeanpmuller @ReutersTV Trump's greatest talent is shooting himself in the foot.
@brianefallon @dgweatherby Graham is done.  They all are except in the hardest red states.  The blue wave is coming.
@Alyssa_Milano He can be blocked.  We need one Republican vote...I think Flake might do it.
@Alyssa_Milano Will do
@RiderofWolves Okay
@Amy_Siskind Trump is an idiot and a coward....he's done.  If Mueller doesn't get him, I will.
@ffshoar @WatchingWhatYou Don't approve him...one or two reasonable Republicans and he is out.
@CallSignSiren How about sincerely delivered?  It's a joke....I'm always sincere, except when I'm not :)
@bolisa3 @PoliticalEmilia @LuvMultimedia Okay, https://t.co/WWE8RUo1qt, Boulevard, Street and Avenue, but they have to be off the PCH
@RVAwonk @nikkihaley Can we move up the Presidential election to this year?  I can't wait two more years to fire all these people.
@Mikel_Jollett @heartstring1111 Dems...keep him out.  You can do it.
@ttweets_two @stonecold2050 @WatchingWhatYou Don't eat, just drink....did I say that???
@KatiePavlich @WalnutDrummer Reid screwed up.  We can't change it so we just move on
@pattonoswalt @markitgeek @MeredthSalenger Yup.  One minute they are babies and the next they are in their 20s.  Enjoy every second.
@Cernovich Mandie Fressh can go to hell.  We are taking our motherf...king country back.  The Republicans and "conservatives" are done.  I'll listen to them, because they may have one or two good points, but they are so damn evil.  Damn.
RT @coleyworld: Guess I was a bit too subtle...		FOLLOW @realBobWoodward NOW!!!!! 		HIS TL IS GONNA BE FULL OF MAGATS SO GET ON IN THERE!!!…
@RebelEll @SugarMagicSpice You can blow on my belly :)
We have 2 years more of Trump or Pence until I take over...in the meantime, we have homelessness.  I talk to the homeless daily.  It's our economy, we reward the rich and steal from the poor.  Please help if you can.  https://t.co/VjCQx3Gu0m
@Amy_Siskind Here's my plan...assault weapons only rented at gun ranges, NO gun sales, private or public without a background check, rebuild all the mental hospitals Reagan tore down.  And if your kid uses your gun to kill other kids, you go to jail for murder. Lock it up
So do only liberals tweet or is Trump that bad?  I lean left but will accept the opinion of the right if it makes sense...it's just interesting, Trump has NO supporters on here.  Love it :)
@FlowerFarmher @Amy_Siskind We're winning the mid-terms and I'm winning the Presidency.  We will fix everything.
@jennloverde Enjoy it....they grow up fast
@Amy_Siskind Whenever I read anything about Trump, my mind goes to an old cartoon..."Stimpee, you idiot!"  Substitute Trump for Stimpee :)
@richard2380 They both sucked.  He just sucked a little more....she was no charm bracelet...she attacked Libya for nothing and destroyed their infrastructure (and water plants, a war violation).  Trump is still worse but we had no good choice other than Bernie.  So I'm doing this.
They say money can't buy happiness, but it can rent it :)....it's a joke, don't judge
@DaddyDaddymac @LuvMultimedia It's over.  They are going down. To many of us have had it....I'm actually running for President just to get Trump out, even though I don't need the stress.  Now I'm under all this pressure to pick a FLOTUS and the competition is tough.  Not complaining :)
@bolisa3 @Palovan @PoliticalEmilia @LuvMultimedia I won't insult anyone, but they do get blocked.
It's a play on the Twitter question, "What's happening?"
@andyharnik @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @AP Let's block him like the Republicans blocked Obama's pick....he needs 50 votes...let's turn a couple of reasonable Republicans
@RiderofWolves Um, okay, I'm a little better but you decide...keep that knife in your pocket :)
@Amy_Siskind Just two more years....I know it sucks....that's why I'm running....a sense of control.
I keep saying this but why are some people so horrible.  Send me a nasty gram and you are blocked, AH
@Palovan @bolisa3 @PoliticalEmilia @LuvMultimedia You have a nice day too.
What's not happening?...this is insane.   Well, it keeps me busy :)
So I deleted my horrible family, except of course, my wonderful kids, and just accept Facebook friend requests from beautiful women (or that's what the pic says).  I'm limited to 5K and am over the limit.  This is insane :)
@adamvander007 @mel_faith1 @katiewinfrey11 Don't judge  I don't judge you
@panickzz Yup.
@krassenstein Good for him!  We can't be quiet anymore.  The Republicans cheat, lie and steal.  	They are in for a fight.  I'm so f...king through with this.  They are done.  Finally. Okay, I'm combining topics...just being productive :)
@Emmymac1999 @angry_gram Typical lying Republican
@shannabanana67 @jctwritesstuff Um, two that I know of
Why are Republicans so mean...not all, but I get some pretty bad messages from a few AHs. Why?  Just vote for your hero, Mr Trump, the alleged pedophile....that's your choice?  I'll cut your taxes AH.  Don't thank me, just go away.
@EdKrassen Wow, so I need to beat Pence?  Okay
@bolisa3 @PoliticalEmilia @LuvMultimedia Just one street.  That's all I need.
Why are there so many MFAHs out there?  Just disagree and vote for Trump, but don't send me angry messages....I don't send you angry messages....this is why I'm going to kick Trump's ass.  Have a great day, AH.
@myshaela @nightlypolitics @realDonaldTrump Have a nice day
@Amy_Siskind @SteveSchmidtSES He's out.  But we have to wait two years.

@TomArnold @shannon_crane WTF???  I get these too.  Jealous
@roughriderII I can't wait.  I had to lie to my daughter's boss to get her the day off...well worth it.  Her first three concerts were Def Leppard....bad Dad, not really :)
@BraylieHanson19 They grow fast, but it's still great.  My daughters and son are so important....nothing else matters.

@stonecold2050 @lorettamiller01 She is done when I fire her Dad.
@politico Well, we get two of the three branches of government.  The judicial branch isn't a big deal.
@RealMuckmaker Two more years and then I'm kicking him out.  That's the plan
@GHawkinz @Demonoid55 Yes
@roughriderII I can't wait.  I had a chance to get box seats for two grand, but until I sell a screenplay or get elected, it's the bleachers.
@libby_lockey @liv2talk_lmd411 @VanessaHeard6 @CNNPolitics There will be a blue wave.  That's the plan
@roughriderII I have two daughters and one son and they are the most important thing to me in the world....I am attracted to a few women, but they come after my kids.
@libby_lockey @liv2talk_lmd411 @VanessaHeard6 @CNNPolitics We'll see.  I bet you one dollar.  The Republicans are out.
@justsomegirl81 100% of mine :)
@PondHockeyPro I just can't sleep but I am not innocent  :)
There's just too much good music....the inauguration will need to go on for three days so I can get through my whole playlist...https://t.co/2EZbBi1eIS
@roughriderII Damn...the concert is in three days...I need to stop procrastinating.  I hope the kids are free....I called my daughter's work and made up a story to let her have the day off since she is afraid to ask....I asked and they said okay  :)
@roughriderII Yes, best band ever IMO
@liv2talk_lmd411 @VanessaHeard6 @CNNPolitics He is done.
@kylegriffin1 Damn...I don't even need to try....Trump is winning the election for me.  Okay, I'm tired so that works :)

@ItsMeAshleyWee @krisv_723 yes
@LiberalJustin @realDonaldTrump @katiewinfrey11 It's insane.  Nobody is attacking us.  We just make money for defense contractors.  That's over.  We need to spend money on cyber defense and foreign aid.
@LiberalJustin @realDonaldTrump @katiewinfrey11 The defense budget is getting cut in half when I'm President.

@brianklaas And he's our President.
@robreiner @DarkMission1 He's done.  I will take care of it in 2020.
@funder Trump is done.  He is shooting himself in the foot every day
@SenKamalaHarris @jdyadvs Do you want to be my running mate?  I'm an Independent but will go Democratic if I can get nominated.  We will win....big.  BTW, you did a great job with the Cabinet hearings.
@collectbalance @DarkMission1 @realDonaldTrump @GOP Lie.  Over and over.
@The_Trump_Train @jjauthor No
@trom771 Yes,  It's a lot of work.  There is something to being no party, so I can appeal to both the right and left, but the Democratic ticket would be a lot less work.  I'd like to run with @KamalaHarris .  We would win all but the reddest states.
@amvetsupport He is such an idiot. We just need to ride out the next two years and then I will kick his ass in the 2020 election...and I'm an unknown....that's how bad he is doing....this will be a piece of cake.  I've spent 25 bucks and will beat him.  Well, gotta go.  I need to find a FLOTUS
@denhamon They are done.  Enough is enough
@adelamusic Captain Crunch
Enjoy it....they grow up really fast
@williamlegate @LuvMultimedia I had some Nike's and they did not fit well.  Ten dollar Walmart shoes feel a lot better.
@DaShanneStokes @berylmills455 @realDonaldTrump I will crush Trump with both the popular vote and the electoral vote.  He is done. Guaranteed.  The Dems can just skip this (I'm an Independent), unless they want to nominate me.
@freedom2726 @CallSignSiren Okay
@TxThompson35 @jdyadvs Yes.  Please vote blue.  I need a Democratic House and Senate to fix everything.  And why vote red anyway?  Unless you're rich or a bigot, there is no reason.
@Dax_x98 Vote for me.  I will fix everything.
@Christie_D22 @denhamon I'll be taking Trump down in 2020.  Putin has no control over me and we will have to deal with the Supreme Court..
@SaysHummingbird Read up on Steve Bannon.  I have.  He is a MFAH
@krassenstein I've been harassed by cops...not anything like African American, but I know how it feels. It doesn't feel good.
@fluffykoalaa You win my first laugh of the day :)
@BraylieHanson19 Yup.  Enjoy it.  My favorite memories are rocking my kids back to sleep.  It slips by so fast.
@DivinaDeeMe @summerlvn82 Same with Facebook.  Just block them.
Why are Republicans/gun nuts all around AHs so horrible?  I'm getting threats....huh?  Just vote for Trump, you idiot.  I need to screen my Facebook friend requests more closely...no more dudes :)
@trom771 Thanks!  I'm running as an Independent just to win, but if the Dems want to nominate me, it would save a lot of work.  I'll win, either way.  Trump is done.
@DaddyDaddymac I get a lot.  But they are outnumbered by supporters, so they get blocked and can go to hell.  :)
@DaddyDaddymac Just don't pay attention to her.  I don't
@RealMuckmaker Two more years and this BS is over.
@irishrygirl Please accept  my condolences.    I'm very sorry for your loss.  Take care.
@Amy_Siskind @realDonaldTrump Two more years.  It sucks but we will get past it..
@jjauthor And Republicans don't?
@ManInTheHoody @gbmnyc Do a Google search on this guy...he's a creep and it is insane he has any supporters
@PalmerReport @Mimistheone @realDonaldTrump I'll give them a raise with back pay
@goodoldcatchy The GOP is done.  Now.
@OppositeOfCNN I can't debate this...veterans are heroes and he has the right to express himself, IMO.  Please don't make this a personal issue.  I respect our veterans.  Let's agree to disagree.  Take care.
@coleyworld Hell, no.  She is done when I kick her Dad's ass in 2020
@RiderofWolves @SassyyyGinger Um, okay
@patnspankme Nice!  The booze is kicking in  :)
@trom771 We have four f...king years.  Elect me and every Democrat for the House and Senate and let us fix the mess the Republicans created.  We have 2018 and 2020.  Please vote
@piddle_fart @justsomegirl81 Thanks for reminding me!  I need to buy Vodka  :)
@Progressive_Pol @lor_knibbs They will with back pay when I'm President
@andylassner And they are idiots
@mediumwings @justsomegirl81 For me, Gummy Bears
@SummerCandyEyes @summerlvn82 They didn't say it, but it was implied.
@misslillytoyou @summerlvn82 Been there, done, that
@JulieSnark @justsomegirl81 Okay
@maydaymindy9 @hxernst That would be great.  I'm not attracted to her, but would gladly help her divorce that MFAH.  Why is she staying with him????  It makes no sense.
@KC_Sass @justsomegirl81 Don't criticize yourself.    I can criticize myself but, um, anxiety sucks....drink or do benzos....did I say that????  Just enjoy life....we only get one.
@joncoopertweets @DonaldJTrumpJr Finally!
@amvetsupport Joe has some issues.  I do too, but hopefully they won't hurt.  I need to fix everything.   Damn, what a bucket list????
@atDavidHoffman @denhamon They are all going down.  This BS is over.
@Jasons_Advice Nobody.  It's more interesting this way :)
@DaddyDaddymac @Mimistheone Yes
@DogginTrump @berylmills455 She is just like her Dad.  They both need to go to hell
@mcspocky He has the right to express himself.  It's the first amendment.
@TheGoodGodAbove I'm fixing it.  This has to end.
@sliver_of @RiderofWolves You're toying with me, woman.  Lucky husband :)
@SenKamalaHarris Can we end this?  This is BS
@mel_faith1 @katiewinfrey11 He was making a statement.  We have many wonderful police but a few bad ones. He was just pointing that out.   The flag represents freedom and he is free to express himself.  Please don't judge.  Let's agree to disagree.  Take care.
@rgay @NewYorker He needs to go away.  Google him.  He's a creep.
@ChelseaClinton @MsDebbieKingKe1 He's through.  I will kick his ass in 2020.  Guaranteed.  We are taking our country back.
@AnyaDobson @Las4Liberty @spfld62704 @FreedomPilgrim @McFaul @John_Scotus I am
@Havish_AF will do
@TeaPainUSA @jannsloan @FoxNews They're done.   It may be a couple years but we are kicking them all out and taking back our f...king country.
@Iovefacts @ClassyVirals We need that a lot of the time
@AKADonaldTrump Republicans are MFAHs.  Sorry for the obscenity but it's the truth.  Rich or poor white trash bigots....they can all go to hell.  We're taking our country back, MFs.  Deal with it.
@LadyM_07 @justsomegirl81 I only block jerks.  They can retweet all they want.   And I'm mildly irresponsible, but yeah, technically I'm an adult.  :)
@Havish_AF I'm working on it.  Mary, Kaitlin, or um, some other random woman....damn, this is hard.
@riotwomennn @Alien_Visitor_2 Please let this happen.  Give me both the House and the Senate and we will fix everything in four years, well, eight, but we all know the first four are when it happens.  Then the Republicans can f...k it up again.
@amvetsupport @irinafowzry Idiot.  It is insane that this country elected such a fool
@TheDemCoalition @funder It's where they get their money
RT @ididitucan: ♥️ RETWEET SHARE SUPPORT! @jaydenimages Support Chris as he battles CANCER @ViralExpNotify #Gofundme #CrowdFundingExposure…
@JustClaudia3 Can we just ban Fox News?
@TopRopeTravis Yes.  That's why I'm taking his job
@AmericanGent69 @Kryzazy I feel your pain
@acupoker Damn, he's ugly.  Personality and physically
@SassyKadiK @berylmills455 Why doesn't she just divorce him?  Maybe they deserve each other.
@Mookyluv2 I used to manage movie theatres and people would try to come in to use the restroom before we opened.  Um, no, don't go in the lobby.  Hide  :)
@shannonrwatts We are a gun crazy society.  I'll make some changes when I'm President but it is impossible to ban guns....but we will control them.   Finally.
@Hyacint74666172 @krassenstein Huh?  I apologize but I tweet a lot and have no idea what you are talking about.
@realDonaldTrump Weren't you a Dem a while back?  Hypocrite.
@CyrusMMcQueen I didn't like Bush until Trump came along.  Now he's not that bad.
@LukeBrussel Why am I not surprised?
@grantstern Republicans, corrupt????  Yes.
@SandraTobias7va @GH_obsession He's through....I'm not sure how but I'm motivated...what a MFAH
@shannonrwatts @blackjackmass Guns do kill people
@_NotFakeNews_ Hell no
@krassenstein @LadyTitania46 @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Two more years
@RiderofWolves Great movie
@justsomegirl81 @RiderofWolves What else do you want?
@joncoopertweets Democrats will win the House
@EdKrassen No.  He can play golf after I beat him in the most lopsided election in history.  The Russians can't fix this one.
@joncoopertweets @Hyacint74666172 My kids are much better people.   Two more years....
@joncoopertweets @Hyacint74666172 Yup
@krassenstein @Hyacint74666172 Ca-ching.  It's our turn....fix all the Republican's mistakes so they can screw everything up in eight years.
@SaysHummingbird For two more years, then I'm in
@PoliticalEmilia @jdyadvs Trump is done.  I can't wait to debate him.  Um, Jeffrey Epstein.  Child rape.  (allegedly).  We'll be covering a few topics....
@CREWcrew @jdyadvs I'll be sending them a bill when I'm President
@girlsreallyrule @CTO1ChipNagel Okay, but give me a chance.
@AlinsonParker Good night :)
@MrFilmkritik @blackjackmass Meghan McCain is not anything like her Dad.  She needs to grow up.
@nowthisnews @dreilc I'm in
@JillWineBanks Damn!  Can I just take over now?  It's going to happen so why wait?  They don't even need to pay me...just get Trump out.
@Stop_Trump20 Yuk
@ChrisMurphyCT @SoCallls I'm not a Republican, but he was a great man. He rose above party politics.  It would be great if  all politicians followed his example.
@WildwoodFlower7 @Las4Liberty @spfld62704 @FreedomPilgrim @McFaul @John_Scotus I don't play golf.  It's boring.
@crystalline_02 He is done in 2020.
@byemollyxo @CraziestSex Cut toxic people out of your life....it's Xanax for the soul
@DogginTrump Don't mourn.  I will fix everything.   Guaranteed.
@renato_mariotti @spfld62704 caHe is going down.  He"ll get the hard red states but it will be the most lopsided election in history.  I can't wait.  This will be fun   :}
@Akhona_Mfaba @sleeplikeababy1 Earplugs
@TeaPainUSA Trumpiblicans are done.  There's a new sheriff in town  :)
@Las4Liberty @spfld62704 @FreedomPilgrim @McFaul @John_Scotus Two more years and then we are through with him.
@agentdoublek @sleeplikeababy1 Don't cry.  It will get better.  Take what you need to take to sleep and realize there is so much life to live....I was in your shoes in April and the world has changed.  Just try and find friends....cut off family if they are toxic.  I did and everything is wonderful right now
@CallSignSiren And vice versa
@Amy_Siskind Repugnicans.
@Amy_Siskind Two years and two months and this BS is over.  Guaranteed...although I have nothing to back up that guarantee.....still, I'm pretty sure I'm going to kick Trump's very large rear end hard and win all but the reddest states.   Let's just ride this out.
@lisadaniels_xxx Enjoy it.  Take care.
@tomasinamonique @sleeplikeababy1 Enjoy it.   They grow up so fast and you'll never have this time again.  It's not a loss of sleep, It's a chance to bond with your child
@GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump This needs to be corrected right now.  Who has the details?
@DogginTrump @kuhn_marty So he talks to God?  Yeah, right.  Another idiot GOPer.
@greggdsnabb @1IronMan2018 @annableigh Trump is done.  It's insane but I decided to run only this past April because he is so MF incompetent.  I have three screenplays that will all be huge so being President is not really my goal, but somebody has to.  Trump will lose all but the hard red states.  This will be fun :)
@1IronMan2018 What a MF idiot.  We need term limits on Congress.  They lose their minds after two terms.
@JasonHalle @moire7 Let's get it done
@andylassner Somebody has to be the worst.  It's Trump's greatest accomplishment.
@Goss30Goss That will all change in 2020
@Carisma015 @krassenstein Things can also get better.  And they will.  Just think positive.
@1MeLrO Just do it by phone.  Text and messaging are the bane of our society.  We need two way communication.
@AmoneyResists They should have called Security on him for treapassing.
@Carisma015 @krassenstein We're on the upswing.
@EdKrassen It would save me eight years of work and grey hair.
@krassenstein Can the Republicans be any more corrupt?
@AynRandPaulRyan @SoCallls @McCreadyForNC Huh????
@RiderofWolves Happy MF Friday to you as well :)
@billbuc I'm getting giddy!
Flying to Los Angeles
@realDonaldTrump Why are you doing this?  Nobody with a brain trusts or believes in you.  I am going to embarrass you with the most lopsided election in American history.  Just retire. Play golf and tell your minions how great you were. If you don't, well, the people will decide.  Take care
@EdKrassen He's done.  Just give us two years until the election.  Ignore this idiot and let me take him down.  It will be so much fun.....I want to know who determined his IQ....I think it was, um, him.  He's only in the double digits.
@renato_mariotti Trump has to go right f..king now.  We'll take Pence until 2020 and then I'm in and we fix everything.
@Progressive_Pol Let's cut his pay to zero
@DaveVescio @dtsegs We don't have any gun laws....they are loose guidelines.  This will change in 2020.  Sorry gun nuts...not really.

@realDonaldTrump @CNN @NBCNews Have I asked you to retire yet???? Please give us all a break and just go away.  I WILL embarrass you in November if you can't take a hint.  Your presidency ends at the end of this term.
@nubbinspet @62WalterP What smells in here?
@TheDemCoalition @TXsnark7 @realDonaldTrump The only thing I'm taking from Trump is undoing the prior President's actions. I will undo everything he's screwed up.  Guaranteed.
Hi all - Well, nobody has announced they are taking on Trump, so I am.  I have a Go Fund Me account.  I'm only taking individual contributions....no special interests, lobbyists, NRA.  I can't be obligated to anyone except the people.  We will fix this.  Thanks for any help
Check it out! I donated to 'Pete Cirignani for President' -  https://t.co/VEjhhjZ282 via @gofundme
I'm raising money for Pete Cirignani for President. Click to Donate:  https://t.co/FOS5IJtAHZ via @gofundme
@CallSignSiren Okay
@TopRopeTravis @MadamPrez328 Mine is "Opal Franks."  Hilarious.  :)
@EdKrassen Can we just remove him now?  This is insane.
@genaro_inc @Amy_Siskind That's them. MF scum bags.  They are going down.  I will be shutting down "Lolita Island" when I'm president.  And he's getting deported.
@ivancoyote @mariefisher562 I was bullied...at nine in Catholic school.  Well, I will have everything and that AH is probably not doing well.  At least  I hope so.   :)
@joncoopertweets That's what happens when an idiot is elected.
@WalshFreedom @lor_knibbs The Republicans are done in 2018 and 2020
@funder @realDonaldTrump Thank God they got him before anything happened.
@richellepittman @mariefisher562 @MomsDemand Thanks for sharing. I will be fixing this in 2020.  It's the first order of business. The NRA will hate me but kids will be allowed to be kids.  The BS is coming to an end.  Just make sure I'm elected.  Take care..
@selectedwisdom @mamapojo How f..king stupid are his followers?  He is so done.  I can't wait.
@brendacls_ @Bevels333 Just find another job.  They will make you crazy.
@SaysHummingbird Huh?  A Republican is unethical??? No way.  Way  :)
@realDonaldTrump And you, the world's worst liar, preach about credibility.  PLEASE retire....right now.
@realDonaldTrump Please retire.
@ChileboyNJ @Amy_Siskind I won't forget. He's through
@Amy_Siskind Insane. We know all this, but I like to remind people of this...https://t.co/8f6ZNYT4r5
@bullfish777 @realDonaldTrump When I'm President, we deport all narcissists.  And bigots and racists.
@GingerHotDish Me too
RT @SenKamalaHarris: Retweet if you:		-Have a pre-existing condition	-Love someone with a pre-existing condition		The fight over Kavanaugh’…
@Silau25 Hello!  :)
@propapergirl @krisv_723 Yup.  It's more productive.
@MollyMcKew @TenneyNaumer Can't we just talk to Putin?  This is BS.  Is there any way I can just be "interim President" until 2020?  We don't need war, we need peace.  Well, Trump, use that tiny brain.  Call me if you need advice.
@th3j35t3r @TenneyNaumer He is a liar and an idiot.  He thinks his words mean something because he can't think...he just spews whatever enters that tiny brain. There will not be violence....except the racists and I will see to it that they are all deported to racist/bigot island. That's the plan.
RT @RealMuckmaker: 'rump and all his co-conspirators are making terrible choices for all of us. https://t.co/euwUU6UJSu
The first thing I do as President will be to re-allocate money from the military to build mental hospitals in every state in every large city.  It will combat homelessness and the anxiety/depression that drive even the strongest people crazy.  Sorry, military contractors.
@SaysHummingbird @denhamon Why am I not surprised?  How can we elect any of these AHs?  Racists and rich people are their demographic.  Well, they are in the minority and we are taking our motherf...king country back.  This is over.  Now.
@RealMuckmaker That cheeseburger really has me bound up this morning....well, time for some inane tweets.  Yeah, really Presidential.  Stay on the toilet, sir.  We'll wait.
@carlbernstein @willcharmom @realdonaIdtrump @CNN Keep it up.  We're gaining Trump followers one by one.  The smart ones can only take so much.
@RealMuckmaker What's worse than a busload of judgmental, hypocritical evangelicals driving off a cliff?  A busload of judgmental, hypocritical evangelicals driving off a cliff with one seat empty.  It's a joke....they'll die naturally.  Damn :)
@EdKrassen In the future book of American Presidents, he will be in the Index in the "L" and "I" sections.  Liar and idiot.  He's done.  I can't wait to take him down, but I need to get breakfast first :)
@bowiegrrl11 @Ange_Amene @CTO1ChipNagel Not sure who this person is talking about but I'm cutting taxes on the bottom 90%.  The banks will be fine
The church we go to/believe in should stand for honesty, kindness to others and doing the right thing every day.  Evangelicals (at least those supporting Trump) do not have any of these qualities.  They can go to hell. https://t.co/zVnLAlnfMm
@Jasons_Advice My lifespan.  I have way too much to do in 45 years or so
@IndivisibleNet When I'm President, we will be deporting these AHs to "Bigot Island."  We just need to find the island.  Their plane is waiting.
@restaurant_mom PLEASE let him be retiring, although it would be easier for me to beat him than Pence, but I will beat either.  This is over in two years.  Finally.
@realDonaldTrump Don't preach to us about dishonesty.  The media is reporting on your lies.  PLEASE just retire and let us fix the mess you made.  Thank you.
@Alyssa_Milano @SenateDems Assault weapons need to be banned.  If the gun nuts need them, other countries have restricted them to rental at gun ranges...that would be a compromise although I just don't get the need for  common citizen to have one.  We'll see.
@psychdr100 He won't be President in 2020 so we just need to deal with the fallout for a few months in 2019.  No prob.
Thank God.  He brought down the party of the rich and racist.  We have 10 more months before he has to study nightly for debates and interviews...he can't handle it.  This will be a piece of cake.  He's done.  BTW...I'm running as an Independent.
@crandallgold @JoeBarri Moron is a compliment.  MF idiot is more like it
@HawaiiDelilah @BiznezNuna What do we need to do to fix this?  DM me.
@mjs_DC @Elizabe80758699 10 months.  That's it.  He needs to focus on the campaign with his tiny child brain in 2019.  We will fix all of this when I kick his ass in the election.  Yes, I have no money but a brain will suffice.  He is done.
@IndivisibleNet @CanaryAmerica When I'm President she is being deported to "Bigot Island."  I will find a way to make it legal.  They are all gone.  This is f...king insane.  This hatred when we need to stick together.  Get the f..k out of our country.  You're not welcome here, AH.
@MichaelAvenatti @denhamon If they can't do it, I will.  No compromise.  Tell the GOP to go to hell.  We need a majority in both the House and Senate by 2020.  Then do what we have to do.  The GOP can whine but we need to focus.  Those MFAHs are done.  Sorry for the profanity (not really :)
@john_sipher @Elizabe80758699 Take out the 6 months he'll need to campaign in 2019 &amp; we're looking at 10 more months of this crap.  Then I kick his ass. I did a search on running as an Independent and it is a lot of work, so if the Dems would just nominate me, we could knock this thing out of the park. Dems??
@BetteMidler @denhamon I hope he cries himself to sleep.  Yes, he has virtually no friends.  Just some insane racist and/or wealthy supporters.  They're not enough.  I'm taking him down in 2020 on 1% of the budget he has.  Idiot vs. me.  Done.
@ohnoletsgocrazy @lmwortho Okay
@michaeldweiss @BiznezNuna We need to go in there and cordon off half the country and get all those people to safety.  We have so much military might and yet, when genocide is happening we just twiddle our thumbs.  This is where we need to show the power we have.  Putin and his friends can go to hell.
@skickwriter @Desert_Musings That would be wonderful
@Ange_Amene @CTO1ChipNagel The whole deal was weird.  Bernie would have beaten Trump.  Hillary has baggage and while better than Trump by a mile, she was not ideal.  So I'm in with no experience but brains and communication ability.  Let's go :)
@SethAbramson @Elizabe80758699 He's going down.  He is stupid and will make a mistake with his abuse of power that will upend him.  Still, I'd love to kick his ass in the 2020 elections on a budget that is 1% of his.  This will be fun :)
@Alyssa_Milano Insane. Teachers do not want to carry guns...that's just the BS NRA "solution" to school violence they are peddling to the politicians they bought and paid for. When I'm President, the NRA can go to hell. I won't take a penny from them and we will fix the problem the right way
@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Huh???
@SybilT2 @RealDonaldTrFan @NichelleIsUhura @zoesaldana @realDonaldTrump They are so close to the real thing it's hard to tell.  The misspellings, inane comments....etc...the parody might as well be the real thing.
@KeniaMatias4 @sleeplikeababy1 Enjoy it. They grow up fast
@AmyJamiCowan @ajihwahab We live in a cruel world of of judgemental haters.  It sucks but you have to love yourself and just cut off all the toxic people. There are some good people out there too.
@kylegriffin1 What an idiot.  So the rich Republicans will be taking to the streets?  Okay, maybe his white trash racist base but that group is pretty small.  He's even losing the one talent he had...sales ability....I don't buy it.  RETIRE, Mr. Trump.  Please!
@stonecold2050 @BiznezNuna I don't judge people based on their looks but her looks are tainted by her personality.  Yuck.
@essenviews @BiznezNuna Her judgement isn't that good then.  She should be backing off from him, not joining him.
@yoyoha @blackjackmass @realDonaldTrump It should be interesting.
@EdKrassen Trump is the grifter
@Alyssa_Milano Thanks for the message....women have been silent on this far too long.  Those who abuse need to be called out.
@0000seapea808 @SillySassySmart Okay....I think I can handle the answers but don't have any questions right now.  Have a great day :)
@HH8EE @222W_ I'm not sure I understand the whole tweet, but from the translation it sounds like we need to focus on what's important.  Thank you for sharing.
@Stop_Trump20 @BiznezNuna That's twice as long as I would have guessed :)
@JanzforCongress @berylmills455 Nunes was not telling the truth????? Um, yeah, I hope he pays big time.
@Brotatopics Surprise, surprise.  The Republican party and corruption....sure the Dems have their fair share but the Republicans win this one hands down.
@laccommisso It doesn't take long.  Just follow everyone and they will follow back and tweet some intelligent and/or interesting tweets.
@MedicVet68 @MsDebbieKingKe1 I agree.  Thank you for sharing.
@joncoopertweets I LOVE this pic!  It says so much about him :)
@JoyceWhiteVance @Elizabe80758699 He can't even tweet with any level of intelligence.  I can't wait to debate him in 2019. We'll be talking about a lot of embarrassing things for him, starting with his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.  He is done.  https://t.co/8f6ZNYT4r5
@evansiegfried @FrauDoktor11 So he HAS accomplished something!  Fantastic!  :)
@awwerin13 @petanimalpics I don't cry, but I know how you feel.  My Mom, siblings and some acquaintances (they aren't friends if they make you feel bad) were toxic.  Get a better job, better friends and cut off everyone who makes you feel bad.  It is almost as good as medication....maybe better.
@DaddyDaddymac @jdyadvs @FLOTUS She should do herself a huge favor and divorce that MFAH.  She'd be much happier.
@christoq @FrauDoktor11 I can believe it.
@DogginTrump @MarciaBunney I read awhile back that when you cross your arms like that, it is insecurity and fear of others.  He's done.
@SocialPowerOne1 Just shows religion is nothing.  He brought something on for generations, but it was not greatness.
@RealDonaldTrFan You don't know how to work.  PLEASE retire. You're through either way so take the easy way out
@SEFrench @lol_e_pop @realDonaldTrump Of course.  He is a patriot and individual who stood his ground when others caved.  We need to appreciate his loyalty to this country that he would give up decades of his life for us when he could have retired years ago and enjoyed his last years. We appreciate him. God bless
@glenn87027633 @AKADonaldTrump I'm white and can tell you that a fair amount of white people   are narcissists, so you won't get a follow back.  The good news is they are horrible people you wouldn't want to associate with anyway.  Money and power tend to motivate people so we need one or the other.
@PaulTOwen @Krejcikova13 Just another conservative religious Republican.  When will the hypocrisy end?  Hopefully soon.  It is insane that our country elects these people.
@GOVTWINE @dreilc I strongly oppose Lindsey Graham.
@RealDonaldTrFan Hilarious!  It's funny because it's true :)
Mr. Trump has handed the Presidency to me on a silver platter. Can he screw up any worse? I have a few family tasks &amp; begin the campaign Monday. Sneak peek...cut taxes on the bottom 99%, peace in the Middle East, solve immigration/defense/health care, world respect..let's do this
@Dax_x98 @kuhn_marty @realDonaldTrump I'm running for President and my parents will still vote for Trump
@miralinda7 Happy birthday!  A day late... sorry.
@AmyElizabethJa3 Gorgeous globes of joy :)
@miralinda7 Temptress!
@whereami18 @SnizzleFrizzle So true
@CallSignSiren Both :)
@RiderofWolves Temptress :)
@Acosta @MarciaBunney If they had any sense at all they would have seen this coming
@AmoneyResists @denhamon You call him Donald Trump
@Mom_Overboard Sorry misunderstood. I just helped a friend who was being abused. Glad you're okay
RT @tomhanks: America is calling YOU. To Register, To Vote.  Turnout! Hanx🇺🇸 https://t.co/I6BptOBGsj https://t.co/zgWu2O4AH9
@treasonstickers It's almost over. Thank God.
@Mom_Overboard Message me. Nobody should be hurting you. But call the police first.

@EdKrassen Trump's days are numbered
Do not accept this. We are all human beings and deserve respect.... except for bigots.  You need to leave. We'll build "Bigot Island" when I'm President and ban bigotry. If guilty, you can hang out with your friends there. You're not welcome here. https://t.co/QoMTrfiwka
@Amy_Siskind I will retweet. Is there anything else we need to do?  I'll help if so.
@JoyceWhiteVance It's amazing that it took all this BS to begin to start to get rid of him. And his base, including my own parents, still believe all his lies. Well, he's through. Finally :)
@RealDonaldTrFan Funny!
@RoseCityWriting @Turnip2020 @denhamon Absolutely!  A top group of friends on Facebook and followers on Twitter are college and high school students.  We need all of their votes since the Republicans cheat.
@SocialPowerOne1 Is Fox News a  fictional news show?  Or a comedy?	                                                ...
@Amy_Siskind The Republicans play dirty. We need to get out every vote
@saradannerdukic @gregolear You are the corrupt one
@gregolear He's done.
@astroehlein Republican rule
@foxandfriends @SoCallls Hell no....it's a complete waste of money.
@RealDonaldTrFan I love this site. Hilarious...except he would have more misspellings  :)
@AmoneyResists @FrecklesXX20 They left him in the microwave too long :)
@4YrsToday He isn't even as smart as Obama's pinky finger.
@laurie_ohio Me
@treasonstickers That's asking a little too much.  There must be a better way.
@JeffMerkley @denhamon Getting ready to take him out.  He is done.
@Goss30Goss @denhamon Maybe he can get those bone spurs looked at...France has fantastic universal health care. Single payer is the only way to control costs.  Our system sucks.
@Turnip2020 @denhamon We MUST have a Democratic majority in the House and Senate to get anything done...the obstructionist Republicans will lie, cheat and steal to win so we need to get out the vote...big.  Look at Alabama. Roy Moore barely lost and only because the black community came out so strong.
@huntersjames Old???
@angelinaj64 That picture was taken at ToonTown in Disneyland.  I was sitting with my daughter but cropped her out to protect her privacy.  It was a great trip. Can't wait to go back :)
@Amy_Siskind I'm getting Facebook threats....it's crazy.  They can't debate the issues so they reach for their guns.
@SocialPowerOne1 Typical
@realDonaldTrump You're the worst
@nickiknowsnada @denhamon @CNN Of that whole group, #3 and #9 would be solid.  The rest either have issues or don't do well in front of people, IMO.  That or too nice.  We can't be nice with Republicans.
@DaddyDaddymac @Lady_Sisyphus22 Avenatti is passionate, which is good, but you're right...it's unclear if he is up to speed on the issues.  He could be my running mate...50 states...goodbye Mr. Trump.  Go back to Florida and let us clean up your mess.
@realDonaldTrump Take those tiny little hands and go home...please.  My computer is on mute and your blathering still bothers me.
Okay...time to play catch-up.  Let's go :)
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Please retire
@MKGenest The budget will be changing in two years
@ItsMeCathi @brucekube567 We need to deport racists
@nickiknowsnada @brucekube567 He's done in two years
@summerlvn82 Can I  try ?  No. Untamed is good
Hi all - If I don't get back to your messages, I'm sorry.  It is insane right now with huundreds of messages between Facebook and Twitter. I definiitely need to hire a staff...just don't be offended...I c an't keep uyp with this.
@Alyssa_Milano Be strong, which you are.  There are some horrible people out there, but we are on a path to normalcy.  Let the idiots vent. Just ignore them.  We will take this country back.  Guaranteed.
@Alyssa_Milano Two more years then we will fix everything
To our Iranian friends....please disregard the words of our idiot President. When I kick his big fat ass in 2020 we will re-instate the deal you made with us.  Take care.  Pete
Hi all - sorry about the absence....I'm taking vacation before kicking Trump's very large rear end in 2020.  I have a few hours to catch up and then will go dark for a few days....but don't worry, he is out of office in 2020. Guaranteed.
RT @MissionFilm: Henry Cavill's arms are locked and loaded. #MissionImpossible Fallout has hit theatres. See it now. https://t.co/Qowms1b6R…
@JamieLeeCuntis I'm f...ked
@mzmyzery @1MeLrO sounds good :)
@treasuredwords1 Everything
@ADDiane Um, gee, I just don't know what to say....I need to go rest for awhile :)
@mzmyzery @1MeLrO Holy smokes!
@EdKrassen It's insane.  He will be done in 2020
@Amy_Siskind It sucks.  He is a stupid MFAH.  Two more years and he's done.  Keep reporting though.  People need to know.
@Breana_Noel Kicked out???  You can come to my pool anytime.
This is happening.  I am going to kick Trump's very large rear end in 2020.  We will fix everything.  It's not that hard.  Let's go  :)
@lovejulieacafe Meet me in Cali.  I'll be with one or maybe two women.  Sorry....bucket list  :)
@RanttMedia @KatyTurNBC He is a MF idiot and I am taking him out in 2020..  This BS is over.  Sorry for the profanity.  Now I'm going to Cali with a girl who's name I don't even know.  But hey, live your life.  You get ONE.  Enjoy it.  Take care everyone.  Later.
@katieedin @sleeplikeababy1 No.  My youngest is 19 but I used do call my daughters "Daddy's alarm clock." I woke up every morning at 5 when they were crying, until I went upstairs.  Treasure this time.   They grow fast.  :)
@urworkshops @_mamdouh1 I don't speak Arabic but will be your friend.  I am pretty sure I will be the US President in 2020.  Let's get along.  No more bombs, no war.  Just let me know what you need.  Take care my friend.  God bless you.
@Amy_Siskind This nightmare will be over soon.  Thank God.
@justsomegirl81 Damn. Procrastination messes me up
@BeaverDelight I was abused mentally and physically
@PoliticalEmilia She can go to hell if it exists
@Amy_Siskind It's a start.  The Republicans are done.  Finally.
@mtlll Have a great day, my  friend.
@BeaverDelight Um, okay.  But don't tell anyone.  I'm running for President.  No, just tell them.  I don't lie.  I like women....if they are older than the age of consent, and our current President allegedly like them younger.  He's done.
@Libertea2012 We just need to make friends with them.  Get Trump and the Republicans out and we will be fine.  They are good people.
@EdKrassen @FLOTUS @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Because he is a MF rich AH and we will be taking him out in 2020.  He is done. Sorry to be so Alpha, it's really not my disposition, but I cannot stand that stupid, racist, idiotic, narcissistic AH and plan to kick his ass, very hard.  Okay.  Now I'm calm.  Let's start this day
@HIIH__ @1H4__ i don't speak your language but assume this is a positive message.  Have a wonderful day, my  friend.
@Mikel_Jollett Who would have sex with that disgusting pig?  I just don't get it.  No amount of money is worth being with his fat ass.  Sorry, I don't like you, Mr. President.  You're f...king done.  Please retire and don't embarrass yourself.  The debate will be, um, fun  :) Have a nice day.
@Mikel_Jollett Trump lied?????? His nose is getting pretty long lately.  He should get that checked out.
@Motorace177 Hey, you gotta have some fun.  Go for it :)
@CallSignSiren I'm working on it :)
@kylegriffin1 Why won't he just go the f...k away.  I want to write movies, not run for President (although the FLOTUS requests are pretty cool :).  Anyway, get EVERYONE to vote.  We need to take this MFAH out.  Thank you and have a nice day.
