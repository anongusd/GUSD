In today's hearing, Republicans are continuing to repeat their 3-step scam:	 	1. Provide deficit-financed tax cuts to the wealthy	2. Suddenly rediscover their fear of debt	3. Target Social Security, Medicare, and other crucial programs for cuts
Chairman @RepJohnYarmuth: For American families, the #GOPTaxScam is a huge and predictable failure. For the federal budget, it’s a huge and predictable drain.
Chairman @RepJohnYarmuth: Under the #GOPTaxScam, nearly all the cuts are going to the top one percent and corporations. Meanwhile, hardworking American families are left to pay the price.
Chairman @RepJohnYarmuth: Instead of collaboration on bipartisan tax reform that lifts up the middle class, and instead of heeding the warnings of economists and the nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Republicans chose to enact massive tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations.
At 10:00 AM ET, the Committee will discuss the failures of the GOP Tax Scam at our hearing, "The 2017 Tax Law: Impact on the Budget and American Families."		Watch live below, and learn more here: https://t.co/TN4I9xR0pR https://t.co/cu2IvitZOQ

This #GOPBudget is a perfect example of how the Congressional budget process is broken.		Like previous Republican budget resolutions, it is not a serious attempt at governing. It isn’t about helping families and making our country stronger. It is purely about political cover.
This is not a tightening of the government’s belt. These are radical, devastating cuts that will jeopardize the safety, health, and well-being of American families and communities while totally undermining our economic competitiveness.
The #GOPBudget places the entire burden of deficit reduction on middle-class and struggling families. It does not call for even 1 penny of new revenue form closing tax loopholes for the wealthy or corporations.
Ranking Member @RepJohnYarmuth: First, GOP passed deep tax cuts benefitting the wealthy with no plan to pay for them. Then, they shed crocodile tears about the exploding deficits they created. Now, they demand extreme cuts to programs that are vital to American families.

The American people need this Committee to have an honest debate about fiscal challenges. They're looking to us to protect national &amp; economic security for our nation, retirement benefits &amp; healthcare access for their family, and education &amp; infrastructure for their communities.
Last year's budget paved the way for the #GOPTaxScam that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy and big corporations at the expense of hard-working American families, all while increasing our deficits by $1.9T. It's part of GOP's three-step plan that's failed the American people.

Bottom line: The #FarmBill has long been a bipartisan legislation that supports farmers and ranchers, protects natural resources, and prevents food insecurity and hunger.  It should not fall prey to partisan efforts to starve families of the food they need. (4/4)
These requirements are a GOP “solution” in search of a problem. 65% of #SNAP recipients are children, elderly, or adults with disabilities.  Many who do work still face economic challenges that leave them unable to put food on the table. Our report: (3/4) https://t.co/umNh8dw1LN
The bill’s work requirements &amp; massive, untested state bureaucracies they require aren’t about helping anyone find work—they’re about taking needed food away from Americans working to get back on their feet. (2/4) https://t.co/nbEkmOeyy4
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (#SNAP) protects 44M Americans, including 20M kids from going hungry. Yet the new GOP #FarmBill puts that aid - and support for farmers &amp; rural communities - at risk by placing new barriers between families &amp; the food they need. (1/4)
