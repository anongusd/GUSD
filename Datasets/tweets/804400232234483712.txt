@HighGlossSauce @Freeyourmindkid I grew up in denial too. 		Mostly white community, one black kid in elementary school, parents didn't say much either way, school taught racism as a historical endnote....what reason did I have to think that racism was still a thing?		I didn't know people still thought that way.
@katiekadwell @Freeyourmindkid It's hard, isn't it? You think "That's terrible, what can I do?"		And then you think of something, and it's probably not at all what you should be doing.

@zombiebaittom @JoeTalkShow I'm sure you are equally indignant about Flynn lying to the FBI then, correct?
@ttdawgtt We haven't appropriately dealt with it, and so it still haunts us.
@ttdawgtt Because there were a lot of people who held onto the rationalizations and mindset of being slaveowners, and then taught their children the same, slavery is still having an outsize impact on our national character.
@ttdawgtt The repercussions of the past don't just disappear when people die.		In fact, I've been reading Alexander Hamilton's biography, and identifying quite a few things that originated with that time that are still echoing today.
@ttdawgtt The fear lives with us still, as well.		You can't treat someone that terribly, and not be afraid that it will come back to bite you someday.
@ttdawgtt It's not about reliving it, actually. 		It's just like....in order to own slaves and treat them as poorly as they were treated, one has to either be evil, or justify it in some way.		The ways in which we as a society chose to justify it are still with us today.

@zombiebaittom @GOP @KellyannePolls On that specific point. That doesn't mean he never asked him to lie about anything. Given the rest of his testimony, and the fact that he testified that he knew Trump wanted him to lie, it seems likely that Trump was more specific at some point.
@zombiebaittom @JoeTalkShow What have they done? I want details, please.
@GeraldoRivera @zombiebaittom @MichaelCohen212 It wouldn't be a problem if you hadn't committed crimes, however.
@joegooding @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So instead of trying to stop them, we just say "Please, after you?"		This is not the hard-hitting criticism you think it is. Trump is weak.
@GOP @zombiebaittom @KellyannePolls I have no idea what you're talking about. Trump asked Cohen to lie many times. 		Just because some of those times, the direction was implicit rather than explicit does not make this statement true in the least.
@JoeTalkShow @zombiebaittom They had to coordinate, since there are several ongoing investigations into Trump's criminal activity.		Can't compromise the investigations!

@thehill @HillTVLive This is an irresponsible headline, as nothing Cohen said today will get him a reduced sentence.		Quite the opposite, in fact. He could get a longer sentence if he'd lied to Congress today.
@DragonEmpressEn @thehill Mueller *does* have it. We don't know what else he has, either.
@ttdawgtt When someone does a grievous wrong, that wrong cannot be healed until the following are met:		1) The wrongdoing stops	2) An actual apology is given	3) The wrong is righted insofar as is possible		None of those have happened regarding slavery. Why in the world would we be over it?
@ttdawgtt And really, how can we be? 		We had slaves in this nation a few short generations ago. We developed an entire worldview to stuff that atrocity into a bag so we wouldn't have to look at it. 		Then we freed the slaves, but kept the worldview. We haven't dealt with it.
@ttdawgtt Cool story, bro.		To be honest, I once thought this way, to some extent. I didn't see the looks my husband received when we were out together; thought I was color-blink; thought we were over it.		I was wrong. You are wrong too. We're not over it.

@sianoresist Two counterpoints:		His testimony today won't do jack for his sentence. In fact, if he lied today, he'd be liable for even more time in prison. 		Also, the value of a book deal is less if you tell the whole world the contents first, so testifying is not the way to go there.
@justinamash Thank you for actually following the Constitution and your principles, and for your decency at the hearing today. 		As a nation, we are desperate for truth and integrity. Thank you for easing my parched soul a little today.

I guess I'm not over it, and really I shouldn't be. 		None of us should.		Our President is loyal to our enemy, and to himself. We don't even factor in. 		Keep going, my friends. Stay strong; stay united. The work is not done.		#BlueWave2020 is the only way we get out.
But man, I listend to @maddow this afternoon talk about the response of the Obama administration and the FBI to the knowledge that the incoming President was highly likely to be compromised by Russia, and it all came back. 		All the fear. All the desperation. All the despair.
Having pretty much understood the extent of the depravity, and not being much shocked by the news reports anymore (thanks, @sethabramson), I haven't had much of an emotional reaction to any of it recently. 		Maybe I was burnt out; maybe the Democrats being in the House helped.

@realDonaldTrump This is a crock of horse shit. Limbaugh is unAmerican.
@AroundTheatre @AngrierWHStaff My main problem with him is that his main attraction seems to result from selling resentment of the elite.

@LiberalAnthony I'm also not saying that any candidate is owed votes, but that everyone has a responsibility to vote instead of throwing up their hands and yelling "same!", which was the context of the original tweet.
@LiberalAnthony You're a troll for the abusive language, actually. The presence of the other trolls is not your fault.
@theZatchery @BobbyBobbyBobby @thehill Point conceded, to some degree.		At the end, though, in our current system, you usually get two choices and neither of them is likely to be a perfect fit for you. Choosing not to make the choice, though, is an abdication of responsibility.
@DanielGallo_1 @1986Ados @theZatchery @BobbyBobbyBobby @thehill Bothsiderism is nothing but laziness. They are emphatically NOT the same.		And if Dems are not acting in the manner you want them to, it is *your* responsibility to communicate with them about it, or run for office yourself.

Calling for his resignation is a necessary step, but regardless of what happens, I encourage all of you to step back and think about  your own biases and your own role in maintaining the racism in our system. 		Northam is a symptom of a much bigger problem.
To some degree, I feel like the point of racism is that it is systematic and affects everyone.		I feel like the current brouhaha over this prevents us from examining our own contributions to that system, by allowing us to feel morally superior. That we Won't Tolerate This.
I'm conflicted about Northam.		That picture is absolutely not okay, in any way.		But....I feel like singling him out obscures the pervasiveness of racism.		Like, we're all fanning ourselves over this, convinced that we, ourselves, are not racist and Would Never.

@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau @maddow @SethAbramson See how I didn't even have to mention Maddow until the end there? 		When all the available evidence points to a certain conclusion, it becomes a pretty easy conclusion to make.
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau 5) The brilliant curatorial journalism of @maddow and @sethabramson, using all of the above to come to a verdict.		Verdict: Yes, Donald Trump is a traitor.
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau 4) Federal indictments, guilty pleas and various other legal filings		Verdict: Yes, Donald Trump is a traitor
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau 3) Direct communications from Donald Trump himself		Verdict: Yes, Donald Trump is a traitor.
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau 2) Live TV interviews with various members of the Trump campaign, both recent and less recent		Verdict: Yes, Donald Trump is a traitor
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau Then you could consider various information streams to answer that question. 		1) Published news reports from reputable, fact-checked news sources		Verdict: Yes, Donald Trump is a traitor
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau For instance, you could pose yourself the following question: 		Did Donald Trump trade American foreign policy for campaign assistance?
@privatettbrows1 @KatonLaw @JeremyLittau Simply not true. Sorry. 		She has a point of view, to be sure. But she values the truth and it shows.		You do know that facts can be verified from multiple angles, right?

@Pirko11 @Kayboom99 @MuellerSheWrote Is it, though? Imagine you were in his position...what would you do?
@MuellerSheWrote @suevisa Right there with you.
@mockumatrix @RVAwonk @Zigmanfreud I take her point. I don't think Gillibrand deserves demonization over this, but I also don't think that Democrats handled this situation well.
@RVAwonk None of it made sense as regards a usual accusation. 		The timing, the metadata, the accuser, the nature of the accusation, the involvement of the RW propaganda machine, the demeanor and nature of the accused....		It deserved more scrutiny than it got. We fell for it.
@RVAwonk I had zero issues with the other Democrats who were accused, but this situation was truly deserving of some scrutiny. 		My reservation about Gillibrand is not that she spoke out, but that she uncritically accepted a situation that required critical thinking.
@CaptainsLogAz Me. Too.
@RVAwonk I imagine it would have been *exactly* what he did and said. 		We should make sure justice is served, and that includes finding the truth of the situation before tanking a man just as much as it does listening to women. 		*Especially* when Stone is the one driving the boat.
@RVAwonk I know you have good reason to approach this from the woman's side, but perspective-switch with me for a minute. 		Imagine, for argument's sake, that Franken actually had no ill intent towards women, and actually is a super-nice guy. What would he have done? What would he say?
@RVAwonk For me, that was not it at all. 		It was the involvement of truly shady characters in his character assassination (really, go look back through the timeline. It was RWNJ propaganda on steroids), the moderate severity of the accusations, and the general goodness he shows.
@RVAwonk @Zigmanfreud Franken appears, from everything I've seen, to be a very reasonable and sweet man.		His line seems likely to be miles away from any other man whose been accused. 		He deserved an investigation, especially considering the fishy circumstances of the initial accusations.

@ALT_uscis Done. Thanks for the organizing. Thanks for caring.
And here's one way to do it.		https://t.co/Pn2gWdoBzK
@NateSilver538 Tucker is not owed advertising money by anyone. 		We have no obligation to continue supporting him, or the companies supporting him.		Boycotts lead to nothing more than a world more aligned with the majority of consumers' values. 		Remember Target, Keurig and Starbucks? Yeah.
@NateSilver538 No, it doesn't work that way. 		See, consumers have money.		Companies advertising receive money from consumers. 		Content producers receive money from advertisers. 		BUT ALSO, at each step, the people involved get to decide what they think is right, and accept the consequences.
@pelosi_media @NateSilver538 @emilybazelon I'd argue that where we spend our money is inherently a moral question. 		Most of the time, we have a choice. Where we choose to put our money has a consequence. 		In this case, choosing to spend our money with Tucker's advertisers supports him.		I choose not to support him.
@Lisa33230514 @TuckerCarlson @Trump_World Proud to be denigrating people? Proud to be contributing to the hate that has already left a number of people dead? Proud to be fomenting racism?
@IrisDroz @TuckerCarlson And you listen to him? 		I would suggest a broader media diet.
@TuckerCarlson Actually, it's just a question of ordinary people, like me, being super fed up with your disgusting b.s.		I have every right to choose where I spend my money. I have every right to tell companies why I've done so. 		You're entitled to none of their advertising dollars.

@iSmashFizzle Thank you for saying this. 		It's such a betrayal of their trust, especially when done in anger.
@TheRynheart @TrinityResists Disgusting.
@Stonekettle It's not entirely clear what the actual policy even is, as usual in this admin. 		As far as I can tell, though, it is not the best way to go about border security. 		How about letting people through to claim asylum? Fewer border crossers that way.
@Stonekettle I have no problem with walls, per se. They can be useful. 		I have a huge problem with the current wall, as it is mostly just a symbol of racism, xenophobia, and Trump's ego. He's exploiting it for the base. He doesn't give a shit about it, per se.
@Stonekettle I would never trust them to do that, so no. 		If I could trust them to do that, maybe. 		I mean, it's a bit grating to consider trading people's lives for a lot of useless environment destruction.
@Stonekettle No. Not our way or the highway.		I'm happy to compromise, if the people I'm trying to compromise with show signs (a sign? any sign?) of integrity. 		Slroberts is right. The word of these Republicans is useless.

@NateSilver538 You also forget that it isn't just a question of the % of total tweets. 		I'm very comfy in my politics bubble, thank you very much, and within the very interconnected political networks, a small number of tweets can make a big impact.
@NateSilver538 It was all over the freakin' place. It definitely had an impact.
@tjweberphd @NateSilver538 This is why it isn't a waste of time to debunk troll nonsense. 		Though it doesn't have any impact whatsoever on the troll, it's important to increase the quality of the comments.
@NateSilver538 We can all make choices about the type of behavior we want to support.		If I choose not to support Applebee's decision to financially support disgusting speech, I don't really see the problem. 		People act as if these advertising dollars are somehow their due. They are not.

@leahmcelrath I woke up from this dream absolutely bawling. I am bawling right now. 		I only have one child; a daughter who's three. I hope it's not a premonition.
@leahmcelrath Then I think I kind of floated away or something, and I could just see them all there, on the beach, playing in the waves. I think maybe they spread my ashes there.
@leahmcelrath I felt so much grief at having to leave them. So regretful. They were all there, facing me, saying goodbye. My daughter had somewhere to be, some life to live. I told her "Go. Go dance"
@leahmcelrath The boy was the only one who could see me at first, but eventually they all realized I was there. There was another boy of about 12, and an older girl. I realized it was my family when I recognized my husband.
@leahmcelrath I was on a beach, and a five-year-old boy asked me to help fix his broken glasses. I did so, and then saw some other people come up and talk to him, and I realized they couldn't see me.
@leahmcelrath I haven't had any visits, but I did have a particularly emotional dream about my own death that's making me tear up just thinking about it months later.
@uhlgeorge2 @76georgezeeking It's better than their stance towards children who happen to be immigrants.

@Daniels4197 @TheRickWilson @Top_Sergeant To me it's just another form of the projection they engage in on every other issue. 		If Donald commits crimes, "Lock her up"	If Donald is lazy, "Low Energy" is his favorite insult	If Donald assaults (young) women, Pizza Gate
@wiscman @SRuhle "The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)"
@PSBailey4 @SRuhle If the woman in the song does actually want to stay, it's not so bad. But if not....that man is NOT taking "No" for an answer.		*That* is the problem.
@coldner @SRuhle "The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)"

@BrazenlyLiberal @SRuhle There's actually no question about the pressure" (How can you do this thing to me?)". 		I think it is the fact that the guy is being all manipulative about it.		And the explicit reference to him getting her drunk "Say what's in this drink?"

@davidsirota @leahmcelrath And if we're all a little sensitive about misinformation, misreporting, narratives that distort the truth, etc......		well, there's a reason for it. 		Your tweets can contribute to a narrative even without being explicit about it.
@davidsirota @leahmcelrath It's the dishonesty of presenting this information, as a "surprise" and therefore a point of concern, when actually the context makes clear that this concern is not really warranted.		Or, at the least, not as warranted as if it had been corporate PAC money.
@davidsirota @leahmcelrath Which, to be honest, is a reasonable thing to be watching out for.		But there is a distinct difference between what people normally assume to be the case when you say "oil and gas donors", which is corporate PAC money, and the individual donors that actually make up his donations
@davidsirota @leahmcelrath If you were just "presenting the data", why would you have followed up with that tweet?		It seems obvious to me that the raison d'être for your tweet was to start a discussion about how Beto is maybe compromised by oil and gas interests.
@davidsirota @leahmcelrath You were clearly making at least the beginnings of an argument, as this tweet clearly shows. https://t.co/6x1fcT3B9m
@davidsirota It's implied that you think it's a problem in the way you frame the tweet. 		Like it's a surprise that many individuals donating money in Texas work for the oil and gas industry. @leahmcelrath has an excellent analysis, if you're interested.

I know there is a lot of suspicion out there, and rightly so, but do please understand that most poll workers are volunteers, and not experts. 		And next year, think about doing it yourself! It's fun to check off one voter after the other and see how excited they are to vote!
It was fun and immensely rewarding, but it's interesting how different my take on all the voting issue stories is now that I've tried to do it myself!
As it was, we opened a few minutes after 7, and quickly settled into a pattern.		But still, there were voters we had to send to other precincts, provisional ballots to give out, unfamiliar procedures to dredge from our memories.
The person in charge of our precinct was late; we barely averted being much later when the door was reluctant to open; we flew around in a rather disorganized fashion trying to get everything done before 7am.
I worked a polling location this morning. It's in a sleepy blue neighborhood precinct, and we're only up to about 100 voters so far, BUT....		We still had issues with opening the polling location!

@RTKDEA @Nate_Cohn @BretBaier Reps: not any better than Obama, with lots of nasty side effects. https://t.co/M6LdaD5yan
@RTKDEA @Nate_Cohn @BretBaier AND the economy has been moving steadily along the same path it was going during Obama. 		If you are happy about GDP under Trump, and  were unhappy about GDP under Obama, you're listening to the wrong people. https://t.co/5iGXMNo5Ak
@RTKDEA @Nate_Cohn @BretBaier Wages were what? FLAT, after cost of living adjustments. 		Tariffs are killing us, our debt is skyrocketing because of the tax cut; now McConnell wants to take away Social Security and Medicare because of the debt crisis he created. 		This is not good any way you look at it.
@gelliottmorris NOOOOOO!		He ruins everything.
@RTKDEA @Nate_Cohn @BretBaier Voting Republican gets you stagnant wages and huge tax cuts that increase the debt and companies' profit margins.
@RTKDEA @Nate_Cohn @BretBaier Republicans have done nothing to the economy except increase the debt and their donor's profit margins.		Most of us got nothing.

@tlsmith1963 @tribelaw It can be frustrating to vote for people who aren't quite aligned with what you want, but it's even worse to not vote and allow into power those who actively are trying to make your life worse. Please vote!		It may like not much, not important, but actually it's everything.
@tlsmith1963 @tribelaw I don't say that lightly. They tried really, really hard to repeal Obamacare. They are trying really, really hard to get rid of Social Security and Medicare. 		If you use or value any of those things, the absolute best thing you can do is vote for a Democrat on Tuesday.
@tlsmith1963 @tribelaw I'm really sorry to hear that you are suffering. Truly! 		What I want  is for people like you to be treated with dignity and respect, and have affordable options available to address your health problems.		The thing is that Republicans...don't want that. They just want $.

@AndrewSickels1 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Brett Kavanaugh's calendar has some proof....but as you'll never accept anything that is inconvenient to your narrative, I don't think further conversation is going to do us any good.
@banthefrontlawn No worries..just thought that maybe ONE of the trending topics would have been about matters of consequence to the nation. 		But we're all exhausted, I guess. It was the worst day I've had in a long time.

@RBReich Anecdotally, two well-educated, intelligent people in my life have expressed doubt about Dr. Ford's allegations and about the timing of the allegations.		While we'd like to think that the abhorrent behavior of the GOP is obvious to everyone, that is clearly not the case.

@CahnEmily @MuellerVTrump This is such b.s. 		There was never a time at which the @GOP reaction to these allegations would have been AT ALL different.		They were always going to act in precisely this manner. 		This statement by Grassley is gas lighting and victim blaming.

@RitainAZ @ChuckGrassley I'm fed up with Grassley's stupidity.
@KBD801111 @ChuckGrassley They haven't even gone through Kavanaugh's full record. 		This entire confirmation process has been extremely rushed, for no reason other than base political calculations about the midterms.		They should never have scheduled the vote already in the first place.
@gordongeist @ChuckGrassley They've offered her almost no time. 		She has to *get* there, for one thing.		She's busy talking to the FBI about the death threats against her, for another.		Gee, I wonder why she might be reluctant to testify to men who clearly don't believe her already.
@Tooitchy @ajplus @Solutioneer72 You mean we can't have a civil conversation about messaging? Why ever not?
@Smkam44 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell I'm not a lawyer and this is not a court case. 		This is a political matter, and given the evidence, I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. 		Kavanaugh has everything to lose by this story coming out, if it's true. He has every incentive to lie. Dr. Blasey Ford has none.
@RealNewsNanny @Cmoore704 @LuciHoneychurch @rootdenied @chrislhayes He described, perfectly accurately, what the GOP is doing. It was not a joke.

@loganinsp1 @debshearer1 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell That's a very narrow range of facts you want.		I think you're just looking for excuses. 		Let's see: you could start with the other people she's named as present. You could interview her and get more details about the location - she actually had quite a few details about location
@RecklessProcess @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell How can you possibly say that? 		But then, even if there were video or something, you'd probably say that she deserved it, or something horrible like that.		You people disgust me.
@AndrewSickels1 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell You know absolutely nothing about her.		No person would willingly go through the hell you people are currently putting her through for a lark, or even for a book deal.		She has a job, a career. Why would she risk that?
@jw_parsons @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Yes, I've learnt that the emperor does not, in fact, wear clothes.		And I'm willing to say so.
@glozee1 I doubt she is a liar, but I have NO DOUBT, whatsoever, that Kavanaugh is a liar. 		He's lied to us plenty enough already.
@cyouloulou @ScottPresler @OfficialJLD @people Republicans choose their wealthy donors over everyone.		They passed the #TaxScam which did diddly squat for most people, and are now going after our Social Security and Medicare.		They don't care about anyone except themselves.
@MuddPuttle @ajplus @Solutioneer72 The way that tweet is phrased, one could think that white feminism is a bad thing, that one should not be a feminist if one is white. 		That doesn't seem to be the message they were going for.
@mike_plum @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell I am interested in the truth. There is no truth to be found in Kavanaugh, so I have more or less already come to my conclusion.

@Kellylayne10 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Actually, what I said is that he has everything to gain if it is true and he were successful in covering it up.		He has nothing to gain from the truth coming out, if her accusations are true.
@frodoislost @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell You're an idiot. She's getting death threats and can't go home.
@Fils_d_Artemis @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell It would be if it were a trial. 		This is not a trial. This is us deciding what kind of man we want making our most important decisions for us. 		He's bad at making decisions, bad at lying, and bad at being a good human being.
@SamuraiCowboy45 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell This isn't a trial. This is a political decision that we all have to make. 		I believe her, because she doesn't have a record of lying under oath like Kavanaugh.
@DrKevinYates @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Like the President? And Roy Moore? And Broidy? 		You're the one who elected the p*ssy grabber.
@bleedingonpaper @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell In court, not in a confirmation hearing.		Also, he lies a lot and he's smarmy. I don't like him.
@HogHunny @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell This is not a criminal case. This is not a trial. 		You really want party boy Kavanaugh to make decisions for all of us? When he can't remember a damn thing if it is inconvenient to him?		He's a liar.
@mike_plum @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell This isn't a criminal case. This is a political case. 		This is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. Forgive me if I don't want party boy Kavanaugh on it, so that he can carry out his far right activist agenda.

@nanking2100 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Riiiiiight, says the person who supports those who railed on Al Franken and who are now silent or supporting #LyinKavanaugh.
@byronaaugust @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell Very few women lie about such things; it seems to me that those that do are often Republican.		Women should be given the presumption of truthfulness first, unless evidence discredits their claims. 		Everyone knows that men like Kavanaugh are not to be trusted.
@rjanemilford4 @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell What kind of evidence would you like?		Your calls for evidence ignore completely all the evidence, and common sense.
@Plutzaman @rockman_2 @RepSwalwell This isn't a courtroom. This is a Supreme Court appointment.		At the very least, Kavanaugh is a liar and a party boy, and keeps disgusting company. That alone disqualifies him in my book.
@rockman_2 @RepSwalwell It's only slander if it's not true. 		Is it true? We don't know because Republicans don't want to investigate it, but Kavanaugh and his supporters are acting awfully squirrely.

It's the resounding voice that says "No, I will not." 		Find it, and nurture it. Let it sing. We're all going to need a spine for the coming days.		/fin
Once you reach that point, dealing with a narcissist becomes easier.		"Nod and smile" becomes "turn and leave".	"Don't make a scene" becomes "Let him have it"	The voice that tells you "You're worthless" becomes "I'll live life on my own terms".
It's that point you reach when you realize just how awful someone is, and you have no more compunction about following the societal expectations and restraints that allow that person to get away with his or her bad behavior.
The finding of a spine is something that often occurs in those who have dealt with a narcissist. 		I think I've found mine, and I think a lot of women have too.		#MeToo, in a way, is all about spine-finding.
Let's talk about spines, my friends.		Not the physical ones, and not the kind we refer to when we speak of Paul Ryan's lack thereof. 		No, I speak of the kind that is so often brought forth by proximity to a narcissist.

@windermeremike @StevenJDuffield This is not at all true, actually.		For one, only 22% said 'definitely', the rest said 'probably'.		Second, there has been no satisfactory investigation of the question to be able to conclude that no tallies were changed. We know they messed with the registrations.

@martina__1974 @benjaminwittes @EVKontorovich @jacklgoldsmith There was no hate in his tweets, just a description of the deeper understanding of the souls of the those who enable Trump, and the reaction he had to that. 		The emotion is one of deep disappointment and betrayal, really. At least for me.
@benjaminwittes Respect, man. 		Such a rare and valuable commodity these days. Right up there with truth.
@IndivisibleNet Also, @Nike, I've been avoiding you since learning about your lack of concern about sweatshop conditions. 		It's been perhaps twenty years. I'm inclined to reconsider.		I do hope you'll make more effort on the sweatshop front, though.
@IndivisibleNet If there's anything I've learned in the last two years, it's that the economic power lies with those on the right side of history.
@ashleyn1cole They are so good at ruining perfectly good words and ideas!
@ashleyn1cole I would add that sometimes, white nationalists co-opt "normal" phrases and imbue them with extra connotation. 		At least, when I said "Black Lives Matter. All Lives Matter.", I really meant that all lives matter. I still believe that.

I think I don't really hate Donald Trump.		I feel disgust at his smallness.	I feel sadness for the damage he does.	I feel pity for his weakness.	I feel outrage on behalf of those he's hurt.		Above all, I feel a bone-deep fear for my husband and my daughter.

@mcnee @everywhereist @Ninjaharlot @thejessesnyder My view of "don't feed the trolls" is not that we should not call out abusive behavior, necessarily. 		It just means don't engage with it. Don't argue. State your position and leave.		"You're a c*nt"	"You seem like an awful person. I don't choose to speak to you any longer. Bye!"
@tyschalter @everywhereist People can't be as awful in person as they are online, generally. It's harder to look someone in the eye and call them awful things than it is to interact with pixels on a screen.

@Copernicus2013 @w1lfridWonka @leighbuerg @SethAbramson How do you know that? Are you privy to all of the government's evidence?
@realDonaldTrump Continually calling networks that don't praise you FAKE is a form of censorship, since you are the President. 		You're trying to convince your supporters not to believe anyone but you. 		Someday, they are going to realize how throughly you've conned them.
@realDonaldTrump You know, this is one of the few things you've said that might be actually true. 		Tell me more about China. What kind of backroom deals did you do with them?
@realDonaldTrump You're harming national security. STOP.
@realDonaldTrump You've forced through tax cuts for yourself and your buddies that have increased our debt tremendously. 		You've started a trade war that will result in increased costs and decreased income for your supporters.		Tremendous potential for disaster, I'd say.

@realDonaldTrump You caused tariffs to be levied on lots of things that AMERICANS need to buy. 		You gave a bunch of money to people who already have a bunch of money, but nothing to the rest of us. 		Also you have no idea what you're talking about.

@JermePhilip Not true. Not true at all. They wouldn't be fighting so hard to win deep red districts and suppress the vote if they didn't think it mattered. 		To be sure, there are issues.		What is true, though, is that not voting will get us nowhere at all.
@JermePhilip @eorlins @ProudResister @SenatorCollins This is not true...yet.		We've got time, but votes most certainly DO matter.		If we don't win in November though....no guarantees. It's all about November.
The most insidious thing about having Russian agents in the White House is the effort it's going to take to make sure they haven't left any nasty surprises once they've gone. Who knows what they've done at this point? 		We may need entirely new computer systems.

@catcdpath @VABVOX Hmmm....ok. 		So if you block someone, their tweets no longer show up on the public thread, but other people can still see it and reply to it?
@jacsje @JeffBfish @AltWASONPS Projection is the only thing they know.
@catcdpath @VABVOX ...but they can still see their replies to you, so they can continue replying on those tweets. 		I think.
@catcdpath @VABVOX I think...all replies stay in the system, but anyone who blocks will no longer see the tweets they blocked, unless they choose to (you can go to a blocked person's page and ask to see the tweets). 		If someone blocks you, you can no longer see anything that their account produced
@jacsje @JeffBfish @AltWASONPS If it's not evidence-based, it can be anything they want it to be.
