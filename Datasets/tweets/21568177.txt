What‚Äôs better for society as a whole? (Vote and retweet to pass along the poll) #poll #democracy #society
We celebrate our freedom but maybe we have little too much freedom. I‚Äôm willing to relinquish *some* rights and freedoms to regulate this sort of behaviour. What do you think? https://t.co/lYckd7v77L
@jwheels74 Three big problems with our world right here: 1) Guy takes sword to the gym. 2) Guy makes funny video instead of calling the police to have this deranged lunatic psychologically evaluated and removed from society. 3) The system would let him go anyway.
Front fascia! Ferrari Portofino fascia kinda looks like a squished and stretched Mazda 3. For $215,000.00, sharpen your pencils and sketch something a bit sexier than something that resembles a commuter vehicle. How do you say #zoomzoom in Italian anyway? https://t.co/FfdUnlfHX7
@maddow small request, can you pass along the message to whomever does the msnbc webpage to not make every video start with an ad for Lester Holt? ‚ÄúThere are stories of *mute!*...‚Äù if I hear that one more time.. dear lord! Every video, same ad! Really msnbc?
@realDonaldTrump Cool story... can we see your tax returns yet?
@maddow It worries me that Trump is being backed into a corner. Not because I care that he‚Äôll go to jail when he‚Äôs out of office, but because that fact may drive him to stage a coup for full blown dictatorship. He‚Äôs in power now, facing jail later. What does he have to lose?
@revgvc @cheryl_dungee @realDonaldTrump Did you just assume their gender? üòí
@Eatsgreenhogs Corporations may start to gerrymander in their own way by relocating HQ‚Äôs to areas that contrast with their political alignment. @JeffBezos could just drop Amazon HQ Ohio for instance as a F-You to his buddy Trump and perhaps over time, party alignment would shift in that state.
@cnni @biancabritton The trouble with sending an ideologue to jail is it only gives them a safe space to cultivate their venom. This guy admires Hitler, Hitler went to jail too. Remember what he did? Authored Mein Kampf. I hope someone is monitoring the prison populations closely. #historyrepeating
@jwheels74 @realDonaldTrump I hope it was lost on no one that avoiding the answer in this case was in itself, a lie. He believes he likes to be truthful, but how can anyone like to be a thing they know nothing about? He may be rich and powerful, but he is a prisoner of his own lies. That's the truth.
@ShepNewsTeam It's incredible how much venom has been spat your way simply for making rational observations. You're a courageous person for speaking from the heart. I know nothing about you, but I now follow your twitter because of this profound display of personal integrity.
@cameron_kasky @cameron_kasky Do you think Trump went to the synagogue to pay his respects because people urged him not to? Did he visit your school after the shooting occurred to pay his respects then? If not, is he just visiting Pittsburgh for the sake of controversy?

@JustinTrudeau @francoislegault @coalitionavenir There was an election? I've been watching so much American news lately I honestly hadn't noticed.
@abc7newsbayarea The nice thing about prison is that the hunter becomes the hunted. Or in Brock's case, the rapist becomes the rape victim. His sentence may seem like "Jail time" but make no mistake, there's gonna be some "eye for an eye" justice happening in the showers. Don't drop the soap!
@realDonaldTrump If Troy really believes in those things, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to be backed by someone who actually does; not just someone who says whatever the moment calls for, truth be damned? (Asking for a friend)
@680NEWStraffic If we rename it the Jake Gardiner, maybe nothing will get blocked anymore and everything will be allowed to sail right on through. Ever think of that @680NEWStraffic #leafsnation #TMLtalk
@realDonaldTrump Cool story. Can we see your tax returns yet?
@StephenAtHome You‚Äôre important to the world Mr. Colbert. If a moment in time comes when you begin to question your value, remember the words from this insignificant man.

@AlexMaya5 @torontofc I‚Äôm not sure what happened in this GIF but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs Jake Gardiner‚Äôs fault.
@sarahchad_ Turn up the anger and channel it Sarah. I'm not advocating violence, I'm advocating the loudest voice you have! #neveragain https://t.co/jRKTpwnbOF
Playing football, I heard a crack in my knee today.  It's the sound of a question; why do I think I can play football?  #kneeinjury
I played piano for 7 hours straight today.  I stopped cause my back started to hurt.  I wish my back didn't hurt so I could keep playing. ;)
