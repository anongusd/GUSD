Not present at the White House presser: Mitch McConnell, the congressional GOP leader who has actual influence in this process. Present: Other GOP congressional leaders.
If you feel like you have a few extra brain cells you want to get rid of, the White House has a press conference going on right now.
Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a leader of the anti-Pelosi contingent last year, voted for Pelosi for speaker.
Rep. Walter B. Jones, R-N.C., is not here for the vote. (Has been ill back home.)
Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., who usually votes for Colin Powell, voted present for speaker.
Former staffer-turned-Rep. and ex-Rep. Ron Barber, D-Ariz., who is coming back as a district staffer for Ann Kirkpatrick, is on the floor.
Liz Cheney, in her nominating speech for Kevin McCarthy, nods to the 1919 passage of the 19th amendment (women's suffrage.) Gets an ovation, reminds people Wyoming was trailblazer in granting women right to vote.
Hakeem Jeffries, nominating Nancy Pelosi, says Democrats are "down with NDP," her initials. The middle initial is a reminder of her Baltimore roots: her maiden name: D'Alesandro.
The clerk is recognizing the election of the territorial delegates and Puerto Rico's resident commissioner (the only member of the House who has a four-year term!) And now on to the speaker election!
Dad and son stuff: Former Rep., OMB Director, White House Chief of Staff, CIA Director and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is on the floor with his son Rep. Jimmy Panetta.
The difference in the two sides of the chamber is striking. Dems: all smiles, lots of kids, selfies, chatter, a giddiness. GOP: Some conversations, a few kids, a lot more subdued, almost glum.
Historic symmetry: In four consecutive rows, practically in a straight line, are sitting Reps. elect Sharice Davids, D-Kan., Deb Haaland, D-N.M., (first two Native American women elected) and Reps. elect Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., first Muslim women elected)
Several Reps. elect are opening their member packets, digging out their voting cards and punching in their "present" vote. It's the first vote they'll take, and several look up at the voting board afterward, just to make sure it takes.
Rep. Joe Kennedy III is passing out Madame Speaker buttons on the floor.
The live quorum call for the 116th Congress is under way. This is as if on Back to School Day, there was an attendance taking in the gym, complete with parents, siblings and etc.
Former Rep. and Rep-elect Ed Case, D-Hawaii, just came to the House floor with some STRONG Aloha flare.
