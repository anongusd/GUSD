@kdeleon Your AMA was really disappointing and tone deaf. Couldn't stand &amp; make a single damning statement in support of women, did not answer any questions on that topic. Given what's going on, it's a really bad blind spot and I'm inclined to vote for Feinstein just because she's a woman
@kdeleon Haven't heard back on Reddit yet from AMA - what are your views and policies for women's rights? Your AMA never answered any questions regarding that. I am your constituent and this is key to my vote.
@SenAngusKing Love your speech. Someone from Maine is sane, at least. Powerful and strong. Thank you for standing up for us.

@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren Ah, my heart is broken.
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren The fact is that the sexual assault allegations are tertiary to his confirmation. He committed perjury, which absolutely disqualified him as a SP judge.
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren You realize that you are tagging me with every reply? You are literally addressing your comments at me.
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren Well, pay attention to the statements sourced on facts and truth, and it's easy.
Good job voting for what's right! https://t.co/bSWwhYUwgZ
@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren Agreed, which is why today is so infuriating! So many of us women have gone through this shit and come out stronger because the system sucks - and now we see it will continue to suck! We shouldn't have to be this strong, this resilient, we should have a government protecting us!
@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren All makes sense now. Twitter is a bit confusing lol
@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren Also, you seem like a badass grandma! Reminds me of my own late grandma. She was always feisty, worked fulltime and got divorced in the 1960s, very scandalous! Strong women are awesome.

@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren Agreed
@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren Sorry, just got very confused by your reply, thought you were attacking me with sarcasm. I am new to Twitter and don't know the culture (used to Reddit, which gets nasty). I was having a back and forth with a maga gal and conflated convos too. I am sorry :(
Why are we villifying Susan Collins to the extreme, while ignoring the 50 other GOP reps who voted against America? Women aren't responsible for the country's morality and attacking her just shunts this away from an everyone problem. https://t.co/tL5nu5O4ir
@ldb1965 @Raeanne_hagin52 @SenWarren Ah, I thought you were rational. Alas.
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren ...You are the one bringing taxes into this... You're kinda nutty. You're having a conversation with yourself, addressing points I've never bought up
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren This is wild. I'm saying "do research, politics isn't a sporting event" and you are just spewing that I am uninformed, when my talking point was "inform yourself." This is not a conversation, just you reiterating propaganda that doesn't even fit.
@justinhendrix I was deregistered in California, had to vote provisional in 2016 despite living at my address for years :/
@Raeanne_hagin52 @ldb1965 @SenWarren Politics aren't a sporting event. These shape our country's social systems, economy, healthcare - it's not NASCAR or football where you cheer for competitors.

@SenStabenow Thank you for standing up openly and proudly for what is right.
@keke75p @senorrinhatch @greggnunziata So you don't learn about the politics, openly comment divisively, and then crow proudly about not knowing anything?
@GregWillvetcop @SenWarren This is depressing. Please travel and experience the world, other cultures, other perspectives. It will open your eyes. Political tribalism benefits nobody but the rich.
@keke75p @senorrinhatch @greggnunziata Read a range of news. Constantly question why things are being presented as they are. Do not shutter your mind with one source. Do not lash out like a toddler and hurl vitriol when confused.
