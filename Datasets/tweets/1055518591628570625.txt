@realDonaldTrFan On the first note Mr. Prez Why did you look at his phone, if he has set alarm touch and the phone ring, the indication will be that AMERICA 🇺🇸 PRESIDENT ATTEMPTED TO STEAL KIM JUNG PHONE, and this alone can degenerate alot of controversy all the world. Plz Mr. Prez be careful.
@MsCharlotteWWE That's so amazing Charlotte, keep being good wrestler and don't ever think of being like good for nothing and arrogant Becky.
@BeckyLynchWWE Your stupidity and your bad attitude will send you too jail. 	You are not better/important than WWE. 	Who do you think you are? 	Goldberg, Stone Cold, Hulk Hogan etc lay good foundation and today we remember them for their good example.  	What are you living in WWE Bad attitude.
@BeckyLynchWWE @MsCharlotteWWE And you are suspended until you change your bad attitude and arrogant you may go for another suspension
I pick Bernie Sanders over Elizert Warren because Sanders is fully matured and very experience than that of Warren  and will entreat all faithful of Democrats to vote for this man. He is the MAN and the face of Democract that can match Prez Trump squally. https://t.co/D1PXaDV4qa
@BeckyLynchWWE Come back to be law abiding and if that you can win titles but if not you can go for more months. Charlotte was chosen because she is very respectful
@BeckyLynchWWE If you continue to be arrogant and called yourself as a Man you will never meet Rhoda, you are not learning anything, this is second time you have mix opportunity to meet Ronda so think and be matured. You are boring me with your arrogant attitude. STOP IT ✋✋✋🙋🙋🙋🙋
@BeckyLynchWWE @DrinkBODYARMOR Show respect to whom is due and progress if not you will never achieve anything. You followed the spectators and your foolishness has got you suspended. Yes is good to have more audience but you made decision. Will your name be change if would have  apologized in the first place.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, is this not act of provocation. No matter what you are still President of great great country USA and there is no doubt about it, but staying at White house is not your permanent destination, you have 4 r or 8 years there so please stop boasting.
@realDonaldTrump Very good Mr. President, keep the good work 👍👍👍
@realDonaldTrFan Mr. Prez Trump, these should have been confidential not for public discussion
@realDonaldTrump	Mr. President, although I opposed  some of your policies but you are perfectly on track and I'm now on your side. My request is that let  America 1st be seen on the face of all Americans by fighting the Hwawei Company. All I want to see is that America leads.
@realDonaldTrump Yes Mr. Prez Trump, Since America is Christian country there is the need to go back for what is left behind, Bible Classes will make America strong and God protection will always be on America. God Bless America and make them still lead the world in anything specially  China.
@realDonaldTrFan Mr. Prez you quoted "Stone is not your best friend" but you ended that "you don't know stone" Another contradiction from Mr. President.
Prez Trump is unbelievable, how could you consider deal with large down payment on your wall building before ending shutdown. 800,000 federal workers who are dying and are not getting pay check doesn't concern you as a President but your wall building. Mr. Prez rethink again.
@TeamPelosi Pelosi, if Trump is refusing to shutdown make his life as President heal.
@realDonaldTrump Thank God and God Bless America. All I want is the better of America to led in every comparison with other countries.
@realDonaldTrump I really love you Mr. Prez but why are you always on tweeter?
@realDonaldTrump Mr. Prez all what Nancy is trying is that let everything be transparent.
@RepAdamSchiff Trump would have been good leader but he always contradict himself and spend all time on tweeter.
@TeamPelosi Woman for the job Pelosi, continue setting the role as a speaker of the House without fear or favour. Trump has to feel your leadership. Americans are looking on you.
@realDonaldTrFan Mr. President if you knew you are holding hostage paychecks for veterans and others, why don't you give it out so that you will be free because these are suffering and none of them voted for you to keep their paycheck. I think you will give them interest of keeping their checks.
@TeamPelosi Good work done Pelosi.
@realDonaldTrFan Mr. Prez you are doing well but my interest is on those innocent citizens who are not getting paid for work done. I think that should also concern you as while.
@realDonaldTrFan Mr. President, pls are you building the wall to prevent intruders into USA or you are building it to make history  for your self?
@BernieSanders Sanders when is the impeachment of Trump starting, it has to start bcos Trump is not thinking about innocent voters who voted for him to become President. Instead of paying them you are using their tax payers money to build Wall.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President atleast look at the innocent citizen of USA who voted for you and end this shut down bcos they are suffering. After this wall building can't give you vote although is part of your agenda during your campaign.
@TeamPelosi @MSNBC Impeachment is on the way Pelosi. Start the process now and save the innocent from Trump regime
@TeamPelosi Nancy Pelosi, don't spare stubborn Donald Trump, review all his works.
@realDonaldTrump It always pain me that America is facing these earthquake and hurricanes. God Bless America 🇺🇸
@CNN So what will happen if US Government banned the use of owning a gun, students are dying, innocent people are dying etc. If the banned of owning a gun will jeopardize industry is that not better than people dying,  today someone will die but tomorow it can be  the turn of top Man.
@neymarjr Neymar my man 👨, try always to score at least 1 goal in every match, don't always give assist because you are above that. Score goals

@HillaryClinton @AndrewGillum @DonnaShalala Hillary Clinton for 2020 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
@CNN Is a shame and diabolical for a person or a group to assassinate  Democrat top members and also CNN, I don't want to term this Mass Assassination as political motivated but everything shows that is very political motivated because 	Why not any single member from Republicans?
