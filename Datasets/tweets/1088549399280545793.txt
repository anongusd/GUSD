@realDonaldTrump Another “Friend” that wants us all dead?  I see a pattern here and it leads to Prison for Treason.
@GovMLG She’s certainly able to throw prisoners around.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I hope you go to prison and they use your anus during recreation time.
@photogal519 Oh, no problem
@SupernovaWicked Ok
@ABC Trump Supporters pay the ultimate price, God is great.
@realDonaldTrump But you’re not very intelligent...
@realDonaldTrump In other words since you told the world they were idiots, they groveled and in true Trump fashion you believed them.  They all hate you but have bills to pay.  You should go back to school, not dad’s School of Slumlording. A real school. https://t.co/RvFE4lwdXa

Does @realDonaldTrump procure Prostitutes for White House sessions or has that part of his life been curtailed as he fools his followers by telling them they’re better than someone else?
@GinaHospel Will you be going back to school to get more intelligent as President Trump suggested?  Also, did you not allow the President to grab you by your most private of areas?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump They have to go back to school.
@SethAbramson Stone will flip on Trump to avoid any jail time.  He’s a feminine male and aging.  The General Population will extort him.  Money or Lead
@realDonaldTrump Let’s talk about YOUR crimes.
@SenatorDurbin But Trump encourages violence against minorities.  You’re probably in trouble now.
@realDonaldTrump We need a Wall to stop Treason; Tax Evasión; Witness Tampering; Collusion; Racism; Misogyny; Prostitution; you know, your crimes.
