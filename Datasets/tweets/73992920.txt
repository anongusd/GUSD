Review your policies. Train should not be announced until the train is stopped and in the station. Especially when there are issues with delays. Check today‚Äôs tapes for track 13/14 after announcing the 5:40 train to seaford. People were trapped on stair cases and couldn‚Äôt move
@LIRR wow bad bad move announcing the 5:40 seaford train without the train being in the station. Review the tapes. You put a lot of people in danger. Both trains on track 13/14 were not in the station. People couldn‚Äôt even move on the platform to get down the stairs.

@starsandstripes The only question I have is. Does finishing the wall and filling in the gaps PREVENT SOMEONE FROM APPLYING FOR US CITIZENSHIP LEGALLY ? No it does not! It stops people from entering ILLEGALLY that‚Äôs what walls do..build the wall.. or do not have any immigration laws at all..

@BretBaier Please ask this question to a democract who opposes the wall from being built.	Would building the Wall...... PREVENT SOMEONE FROM APPLYING FOR US CITIZENSHIP LEGALLY ?
@cnnbrk The only question I have is. Does finishing the wall and filling in the gaps PREVENT SOMEONE FROM APPLYING FOR US CITIZENSHIP LEGALLY ? No it does not! It stops people from entering ILLEGALLY that‚Äôs what walls do..build the wall.. or do not have any immigration laws at all..
@Acosta The only question that has to be asked is this? Does a wall stop people from applying for US Citizenship legally? No it does not. So build the wall. If it saves or prevents 1 child‚Äôs life from being lost or having to traveling thousands of miles then it has worked Build the wall
@RealJamesWoods All he had to do is askNancy and Chuck. Is crossing the boarder without the proper paper work legal or illegal? The follow up with. Would a WALL  prevent people from applying for LEGAL immigration status to the US?  Simple and I am not a President... YET !!!!! #buildthewallnow
@RealJamesWoods Jimmy he needed to say the following. Would a wall stop LEGAL immigration? Would a wall stop people from applying for LEGAL citizenship? Would a wall stop people who are currently in the process of applying for US citizenship? ANSWER NO #buildthewall
@RealJamesWoods has the point...of would a wall at the boarder prevent legal immigration? Would it stop people from applying for legal immigration into America? Would the process stop for people who currently have applied for legal citizenship to the USA.  Answer NO !!!
@SpeakerPelosi A wall can always be taken down If a wall will help stop illegally immigration into our  country then it should be done along with all other means to stop illegal immigration A wall is NOT STOPPING individuals from immigrating here legally That is the way we want it done legally.

@Krystalostrw @NHLPA @CarBombBoom13 @NICKBOYNTON24 Nothing but respect and concern for individuals to get the proper care now. My point is I believe that the NHLPA can be more active and demanding in both the disciple and care of the injured player.
@Krystalostrw @NHLPA It‚Äôs just frustrating to hear players and especially former players complain that they are not aware of what a head injury could cause when they keep inflicting the injuries to each other in the current game and in the past and their own Union does not take a stand. Frustration.
@Krystalostrw The NHLPA have to get actively involved in requesting maximum discipline to any player who caused a head injury due to an illegal hit. NHLPA have to be the lead on this issue. It‚Äôs their members who are getting injured !!!!
@NHL Sorry just not right..... that they aren‚Äôt playing this game in Hartford. Now that would have been the right thing to do.

@richoz13 @NHLonNBCSports If they want to be heard loud and clear about players sustaining permanent head issue, concussions, memerory loss, depression, suicide... they need to clean their own house also!!!!!
@richoz13 @NHLonNBCSports I undestand your frustration with that point. Point being though the NHLPA no matter who it is and they are a victim of a late hit or head shot causing a head injury they the NHLPA needs to demand full maximum suspension no matter who the injuries player is.
@NHLonNBCSports NHLPA must stand up now. They should be demanding that the NHL commissioner get involved and demand disciplinary action to protect players from hits like this. If the NHLPA believes head injuries are real. DEMAND discipline. NHLPA protect your players !!!
@TuckerCarlson bad argument  tonight with State Senator Parker. The more checks the better. I am sorry. No social media check no gun. Don‚Äôt like it move out of the State of NYS. It‚Äôs that simple.
@CarBombBoom13 @NHL If the NHLPA is as liable as NHL itself if it‚Äôs not going to protect the injuries player. The NHLPA needs to make a decision if the hit is deemed by the NHLPA as an illegally hit causing injuries then they should be asking for maximum punishment and not help arbitrating.
@CarBombBoom13 @NHL Wilson is a player in the NHLPA. It‚Äôs the NHLPA who should use this to stand up for Wilson as a victim. The NHLPA should be asking for discipline, demanding discipline. If they want to protect their membership they need to take a stand.
@ScottieUpshall If that was Connor McDavid ..diferent reaction. Head injuries, concussion, depression, suicide, mental illness. The NHLPA needs to take responsibility for its members actions. Force the hand of the NHL call for actions to protect players.
@ScottieUpshall That‚Äôs a late hit.Period. If the NHL players association is serious about protecting its players then they are the ones who should be requesting disciplinary action against players who commit such acts. Stand up for your players. Take responsibility for your members actions!

@Garts2point2 This was not a trade but a draft opportunity. 1971 the Rangers had Two (2) 1st round draft picks. They took DeBlois at 8th and Dugan at 13. NY Islanders at 15th took Mike Bossy, at 33 Islanders took Tonelli. What a missed opportunity. With Bossy and Tonelli..the 79 Cup no doubt.

@NBCNews Sources close to Alec say he's the one who called the cops and lodged a harassment complaint against the Post photog.  One Baldwin source denies Alec threatened to choke the photog, claiming he said, "I hope you choke to death."
@NBCNews Alec Baldwin was involved in another confrontation with the media ... after he allegedly threatened to choke a reporter to death and hurled a racial slur at a photographer.
@NBCNews on the runway at LAX in 2011 when he was told to put away his phone. As he was busy playing ‚ÄúWords With Friends,‚Äù he refused. He then became nasty and the plane was docked, at which point Baldwin was removed from the flight
@NBCNews How soon we forget. ‚ÄúRude, Thoughtless Little Pig.‚Äù In 2007, someone released tape to TMZ of Baldwin blasting his 11-year-old daughter as a ‚Äúrude, thoughtless little pig

@nytimes Would just love to see the writer of this article,this investigative reporter and take a look at his/her tax returns and see how far they stretch their business expense claims on their returns. And any other charitable contribution claims on their returns. Look in the mirror.

@CarBombBoom13 @NHLPlayerSafety Danny, do you believe that the NHLPA should be representing Wilson for his appeal request or should that have removed themselves to STAND UP for the seriousness of PLAYER ON PLAYER reckless hitting and the concern of head injuries to a fellow player ? Thoughts sir. Thank you .
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo FBI should be looking into that drag race out in the Hampton‚Äôs that someone left from the scene of an accident.!!!
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo How was that race out in the Hamptons !!!

@NYCMayor https://t.co/ZUFLHveDLF
@JSportsnet Nhl@players Union should not represent him if they are serious about their concern of head injuries to players. Concussion, depression suicide. They should be asking for a full year suspension.
@thehill The first response to her should be did report it to the police and if not. You should immediately call the police to have her report it. You should also ask if she needs medical attention for the issue. Even if it was 30 years ago. Show some compassion.
@prohockeyrumors Nhl players union should not represent him. Who will represent the injured player. Nhl players Union if serious about protecting its members should walk away from Wilson and ask for a harsher penalty. Concussion, mental health, depression suicide !! Take a stand !!!
@HackswithHaggs Did he lick him ???
@CarsoniPH Nice call !!!!
@brooklyncowboy1 No skill in the all button. It‚Äôs there for a reason. Use it. It takes skill to push that button cause it increases the cost of your bet. Have to know when to press it ...Smart bet and yes ....skilled !!!! Yahoo pick 5 send it in !!!! Congrats !!!!

@marklevinshow Should the FBI look into this. Maybe a quick look at some phone records to see who was called right after the crash.
@GeraldoRivera https://t.co/l8IzM2abGa
@NHLPlayerSafety I want to hear a comment from the players Union about this hit and these types of hits. They should be the lead in this. They want their players protected. It‚Äôs memeber did their own union doing this to each other #concussions
@CNNPolitics How many people saw  those reports prior to him being appointed to any prior judgeship. CNN the story here is if the Democrats really cared then mention which Democrats didn‚Äôt pick that information out while being on the committed years ago !!!!! Shame on them!!!
@leedavis303 Yea let‚Äôs go hurry up we are going to miss our tee time on the golf course. Oh yea here comes the Judge here comes the Judge to serve up a little justice on those poor A‚Äôs.‚Äî-Wait till we see you in Saratoga next summer. Boo Boo Boo......

@alwaysorka @DevinSenaUI @clcyouthprolife Time to surrender my friend. Walk into the nearest Police Station and give yourself up. ‚ÄúI meant to kick your phone‚Äù
@thehill It‚Äôs a story that is FROZEN IN TIME
@JSportsnet The players union should not defend Wilson. They should be asking for a longer one. They need to protects the rights of the injured player. If they care a lick about head injuries, depression, concussion and it leading to suicide then they must take a stand right here and now.
@CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost Is that the trump walk

@bsting54 @5280Avs @BHFanjb @SiriusXMNHL Yea where are all the guys saying clean hit? Again the players Union should be requesting a long term suspension not the NHL the NHL players Union. Head injuries, concussion and Depression they are always talking about. Stand up Players Union protect the injured player!!!
@SiriusXMNHL @CanadiensMTL Oh boy that means he will be traded in three years
@StanFischler Stan.The NHL players Union should be standing up  and screaming for him to be thrown out of the league They want to raise the issue of head injuries,depression that could lead to suicide The union not the NHL has to demand this guy be suspended for a long lengthy period of time
@StanFischler Stan, the players Union has to speak out and side on the side of the injured player here. The players Union. They want to raise the issue of head injuries then stand behind your concerns don‚Äôt leave it all on the NHL Safety Committee !!!
@GeraldoRivera If the judge is telling the truth then he has nothing to worry about. Should take only the week. If not then withdraw his name and turn the keys over to the Democrats!!!!
@Gigiteetee1234 @Breaking911 Gigi... good point !!! So true.. and which side pushed for gender neutral bathrooms. Who push for that law to be pushed in states!!!
@Breaking911 They should have to report their findings back today so the committee can‚Äôt say they need an extra month to read through everything. Tonight report back FBI
@maydayhockey Come on Brad. No way. Back in your day yes. No more with what‚Äôs going on with concussion and brain damage, depression and guys taking their own life. Come on. The players Union should be all over Wilson not just the NHL safety. Stand up for the health of the players. Terrible !
@TheCatsMeow_93 @SiriusXMNHL @NHLPlayerSafety @GeorgeParros Watch this one. George will suspend him for the first 20 games of the season. Remember Wilson had issue last playoff season also.I say 20 games. Nhl players Union should be requesting Maximum Suspension from the NHL If they want the players protected it‚Äôs about time they stand up
@Freddy_bin @SiriusXMNHL Why isn‚Äôt the Players Union up in arms with a hit like that. If they want to complain about head injuries why don‚Äôt the request a lengthily suspension. Not the NHL the Players Union !!!
@5280Avs @SiriusXMNHL In today‚Äôs game it most certainly is. Is not 20 years ago when that was a good hit.The Nhl players Union should not represent Wilson at a hearing if they are serious about reducing head injuries.They should be requesting the maximum suspension to protect the health of the injured
@OntReignFan @SiriusXMNHL @Muleforme @NHL The Players Union should be requesting that. Not the NHL. Its player on player same Union. They want to sue and complain about being protected Head injuries Health then let‚Äôs see how serious they are. They should request Wilson be suspended not defending him
@JimCappadocia @Daver_16 @SiriusXMNHL Correct. Same Union. Time span to earn money very short. The players union should be requesting a 20 game suspension. Not the league. The union concerned about head injuries. Let‚Äôs see how serious the Union is. The union should request the suspension.!!!Enough is enough
@AdamCar42689733 @ToeInTheCrease @LeafsPR @MapleLeafs Best remember what happen to his Dad. After playing with Jagr on Rangers he left to free agency to Wash and then downhill spent time in minors and ended his career on a down note. He might need 34 to play at a high level best be careful

Geraldo push this in the media. Don‚Äôt let them drop all the information on the committed in one day. They will say need more time to read
@brooklyncowboy1 They will speak to the 4 main players that were mentioned at the House party.Then from there they will follow up on any other names they get out of those 4.They will limit it to that. It‚Äôs just a matter if they turn something up on him from the original house party
@FoxBusiness @ChrisCoons Now it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúSHORT‚Äù investigation
@GeraldoRivera Agree
@NYGovCuomo Step up and get this Police Officer his job back AFTER going through the due process of an investigation that took 18 MONTHS. The charges were dismissed against him. But in the interim he was fired from his job !!!! Help him !!! https://t.co/1GWIA4eQtu
@NYGovCuomo Why don‚Äôt you volunteer to take a lie detector test on your Brothers CNN show. This way you can set the table for all politicians to follow!!!!‚Äôn
@NYGovCuomo I 100% Agree with this. This should be a standard set for all Presidential, GOVERNORSHIPS, Mayors, judges- most police departments today make cops take lie detector test in the hiring process. Andrew any deep secrets THAT DADDY might have helped with when you were growing up.
@AnnCoulter Well know what do you say about Senator Blake
@NAACP @CoryBooker This should have been handled months ago. Not the day before a vote was to take place. The optics of this is terrible on both sides of the isle. I am embarrassed of my government official involved on BOTH SIDES!!!!‚Äô
@SenGillibrand Your party blew it by not brining it forward earlier They really didThe optics surrounding the whole timing really hurts the victim more then the accused.If your passionate about it no statue of limitations in Maryland go after him through local law enforcement or civilly like OJ
@SenGillibrand What about the boys from Duke. NY residents were part of the accused
@SenGillibrand Happened in your own backyard https://t.co/YlSfAhmjsZ
@SenGillibrand Happened in your own backyard. https://t.co/Y2Xx5qh739
@KamalaHarris Should have brought this forward 3 months ago. Never would have gotten to this points. The optics make it look like sleazy politics. Poor decision making by the leadership of your party. TERM LIMITS ARE A MUST going forward.
@Breaking911 Could have been just a note of support being passed on from her to Ms. Brown through Ms. Brown attorney. But again it‚Äôs just doesn‚Äôt look good. What could she possible have to say or offer.
@Breaking911 Again more optics that just don‚Äôt look right.
@AnnCoulter @SebGorka How about https://t.co/PuYvkcRFFU
@kimguilfoyle Kim sometimes the best message is no message at all. Tell Don jr. To backoff on the tweets surrounding yesterday‚Äôs hearing and the witnesses involved. If anything go after the tactics that were used to bring the Nation to a Boiling Point.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Donald jr. Back down. Sensitive issue on both sides. Let this play out. Lets see what the midterms bring us and go from there. The WHOLE country is affected  by yesterday‚Äôs hearing. That was not an episode of the Apprentice that was real life.   ‚ÄúGo to your room its quiet time‚Äù
@SenGillibrand Yes stand up for the victims agreed. The timing and optics surrounding this incident were extremely troubling. You presented this as a political issue for your end game ‚ÄúRoe vs Wade‚Äù. Call it for what you want but that‚Äôs what this was about. Should have come forward 3 months ago.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Should have started the process 3 months ago when you found out about it
@AnnCoulter It‚Äôs all about the delay to get past the mid term election.
@CNN underneath one of them was what she said. So did she ever say Judge was on top of her. She just contradicted herself about who was on top of her.
@CNN The one thing that is very obvious in all of this is all of our Senator Representation might have been in their assignment for a little to long. Time for ‚Äúterm limits‚Äù to be put in. WE NEED NEW BLOOD ON BOTH SIDES.
@ScottMGreer @KINGOFCOMSENSE Who paid for the lie detector  test that Ford took ?

@Breaking911 Did you proof read your clients statement? Wow did you open her up for a big time lawsuit. I hope none of the victims come forward from the 10 parties see what‚Äôs at knowing a rape was going on and see did nothing about it. Great representation !!!!
@Margolispei @WalshFreedom Right on. She should be arrested or at least sued by the other victims she didn‚Äôt help. What kind of a lawyer did she go to. https://t.co/EMZlMALYPG
@AngelinaT18 @WalshFreedom Perfect point.  Just wish people would read the whole statement. She should be arrested for not stopping a rape from occurring. https://t.co/Z42KABDzdc
@eabarlin @WalshFreedom üõë This one knew that gang rapes were going on at these parties and she signed a statement that she kept going to the parties. If your daughter was a victim at one of those parties and she knew and did nothing what should happen to her for not doing anything to help your daughter https://t.co/sxW54Z8cEF
@semarwinmd @WalshFreedom Agreed very painful thing to do. Feel for all victims. It‚Äôs just the whole optics around this. Do you think the Democratic Party would have done anything about this unless it involved putting a judge on the bench? Just wondering? All must be heard agreed!!
@WendyFerris2015 @WalshFreedom What‚Äôs the difference adult underaged. Did you read her statement. She attended numerous party with knowledge of what was going on and she kept coming back AND knowingly allowed gang rapes to occur without stopping it or reporting it. Read what she signed. She needs to go to jail https://t.co/sgs212vhKq
@CarringtonWard @WalshFreedom He is very worried about the Mid Term elections. He loses the Senate he loses the chance to put someone on the court!!! So he needs to push now !!! But if the Republicans keep the Senate watch out he controls it for the rest of his term!!
@CarringtonWard @WalshFreedom Is that what he said. Or did he say that he never drank at a party to the point of not remembering what happened during the night of the party ?
@WalshFreedom @KINGOFCOMSENSE Read this.. lines of boys at many parties. So she kept coming back knowing what was going on and never reported it. If these events did happen and she knew them to be happening and did nothing about them. If I was a victim and having her sign a statement. Sue her now. https://t.co/8mGDFQJxLM

@SenSchumer Why don‚Äôt you offer this. Full investigation all the time you need. BUT if he is cleared he automatically gets the seat on the court.
@AnnCoulter She keep going to other parties attended by what she saying were attended by the same people that gang raped others at prior parties ? She did not report nor attempt to stop individuals who she knew were drugging others to the point of incapacity and unable to defend themselves?
@aminatou @SenGillibrand Victim of being falsely accused. Is OUR Senator going to stand up for this former Police Officer who was dismissed from his job. With the Nassau DA‚Äôs office dismissing all charges !! https://t.co/JUCal8jr0B
@NYDailyNews So according to her statement she was present and had knowledge of individuals drugging women  and then lining up to gang rape them and she did nothing to stop them or report them.And after knowledge she still came back to other parties that had the same type of events happening?
@NYDailyNews And she did not report this behavior or try and stop it. ‚ÄúMANY PARTIES‚Äù she keep coming back to these types of parties ???? Read what she is saying. The other victims should be going after her also for not stopping this from happening to them !!! https://t.co/hRsvaAU9Fl

@burgessev Shame on our politicians. it just makes all of them look as if they don‚Äôt care about the American people and are self serving towards their political party at the cost of every ordinary citizens.
@burgessev Without a full investigation. Which the Democratic Party will use as a platform to rally around. What about the victim and accused and what they are going to drag them into. If the investigation turns out to be unable to be proven/disproven it still looks terrible for both
@burgessev By them waiting on the release of this information taints the validity in the public eye. If this is a valid complaint it‚Äôs serious. Don‚Äôt play with an allegation like this and use it as a delay tactic or a mid term slander against the republicans if the vote is pushed through
@burgessev These are serious allegation that must be investigated. BUT-They should have brought this information out as soon as it came across their desks it‚Äôs like the Hillary email scandal a few days before the election. And who is in the middle of it. The FBI. Did they miss this one also
@Breaking911 This is a very serious allegation. Sen Feinstein needs to answer some questions here also. When did she know about this allegation. Why did she sit on this for so long. Was she under an obligation to bring this forward immediately to the FBI as a member of the Judicial committee
@SenGillibrand How long have you been a Senator for and we still have the same problems year after year.
@Telefanmusic @SenGillibrand FBI should find out the question she was asked under the lie detector test. Then put those question towards him under a lie detector, BAM done. What‚Äôs going on here. Very simple.
@rslewis147 @SenGillibrand @C14567288 We do need to know the question that were ask the accuser while she was taking the lie detector test. After knowing those question then I fully agree he should take a lie detector test. Being asked the same question as her as to the incident specific. Why not get this over with

@joppedis @WheelerTSN @TSN1050Radio I understand that. By at the end of the day. The real question is what do you pay Matthews?
@EricHolder Just another excuse. It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs issue. You had your time in the Federal government to affect change and you didn‚Äôt do it.
@EricHolder isn‚Äôt NY a democratic state for how many years?
@WheelerTSN @TSN1050Radio If you give him 8 . What are you going to have to pay Matthews?

@VABVOX @SenGillibrand Are we basing these salaries on a 12 month a year job? Most teachers only work 9 months out of the year. In those 9 months they have a winter break, spring break and paid holiday days off? Please be reasonable here. Let‚Äôs do as we are taught evaluate the entire situation.

@SenGillibrand Are we putting an age limit on it like we have with Alcohol? What about driving a vehicle stoned out. Have we conducted any studies on its affects behind the wheel. What do we do about people who go out for lunch at work on their time and come back stoned on work time?
@SenGillibrand Legalize in what way. Medication prescribe by a doctor or are we talking about recreation use. Recreation use can lead to some issues1.having a stoned work force in Congress and the Senate 2. Having a stoned President. 3. Having a stoned Police Force. 4. Stoned Military and so on

@brooklyncowboy1 The weather cannot put a damper on the great Saratoga Race Track. I‚Äôll take toga on a down pouring raining day anytime over a clear sunny day at Aqueduct.
@brooklyncowboy1 @TheNYRA And ask for feedback from the fans. I do not go to live sporting events to watch it on TV. I want to watch it live.
@brooklyncowboy1 @TheNYRA Any thought I would like you to comment on. To increase the live experience for the racing fan. Having the jockeys wear the same color as the number of the horse. The 1 wear all Red. The 2 all White. Owner can still have his crest inscribed on jockey uniform. Just try it
@brooklyncowboy1 @TheNYRA If they need to add or remove then take care of it in the paddock area.
@brooklyncowboy1 @TheNYRA Thought. Have official weigh saddle on other side. Saddle up walk on over into paddock.  An official weighs jockey in jockey room add them together and there is the total weight. Just a thought. Then they get weighed again after the race. An issues handled then.
@brooklyncowboy1 @TheNYRA Should figure out a way to have less time in-between each race. Maybe come out pre saddled from the backstretch. Have an official out there checking the numbers. Walk out with saddle and numbers on might even be a better live experience for the horse players to see.

@lirr_grievances Wantagh station. Brand new platforms, staircases. Then why is there water dripping on us everyday when we walk up the stairs on the BRAND NEW STAIRCASE Anyone else tired of this at the first Wantagh station???
@LIRR have the station manager at Wantagh Station take a look at the new east end staircases for dripping water coming from the platform. Tired of having traintrack water dripping on my suits and in my hair every morning.
@LIRR Wantagh train station. New platform, staircases. Why is it everyday I have to walk up a brand new stair case on the east end and have water dripping down on me. This is brand new construction. Has the LIRR sent out inspectors to inspect the work before they sign off.
@MDoche Minor or not. Is an infraction an infraction ?

@BreitbartNews Herman Bell 3 time Cop Killer 2 of which were NYPD Officers.. if Paroled will be allowed to VOTE? Anyone have a comment? Is there something missing here. Is there certain Parole Crimes not allowed to vote. Can anyone explain? Thanks!!! #callandyandsayno
@NYGovCuomo Who is paying for this ?
@NYGovCuomo So if Herman Bell gets released on Parole the guy who killed 3 Police Officers. He will be given back the right to vote. Andrew please rethink this. Please. Do you want that guys vote. Do you need his vote. Disgraceful , embarrassing.
@SenGillibrand so if they release Herman Bell on Parole the guy who who killed 3 Police Officers he is going to be allowed to vote. You want that guys vote. You need that guys vote that bad!!!! Shameful of you to support this !!!!!
@AGSchneiderman @NYGovCuomo So that would mean the guy who killed three cops that they wanted to release on parole this month would be allowed to vote. What is this world coming to .. are you guys that desperate for votes.
@SenGillibrand Wow your party is in desperate need of votes. You lost my vote. I am a republican and I voted for you. Not next time. How can you support this. Parole is a part of the term of sentencing. Wake up .

@SenGillibrand the real point here is the commonality in all these choices. The Middle East. Syria, Libya, Bin Laden, 9-11 attacks, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya again and Carter Iran hostages rescue that failed.	From Trump all they way back to Cater and all in between. Take a look at it.
@SenGillibrand Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr., Reagan, Carter, Ford, each one of these leaders of our Country ordered US military action without prior approval  of Congress. I will state this now. Gillibrand will also do this without prior approval of Congress. Miss President .
@SenGillibrand when you become President you to will be faced with decision like this. What did France do. What did Great Britain do. Do you disagree with their decision also. That‚Äôs a lot of people you disagree with.
@SenGillibrand Did you support the raid to Kill Bin Laden ? Did you support the air strikes against Libya in 2011 ? Come Kirsten be a leader not a complainer. It just seems every time you tweet something is always against what the President is doing. There has to be one thing you agree with.

@NBCNews This is news. Wow nbc you enquirer newspaper. This is journalism. Laughable
@NHL not telling you how to do your business but it would be so meaning full to recognize the accomplishments of both the USA and Canadian Paralympic Hockey athletes at their respective Capital Teams home arenas. Washington and Ottawa. Now that was a hockey game.
@USParalympics You are all an inspiration to everyone. Showing everyone YOU CAN DO if you work hard and stay committed to your goal. USAproud
@NBCOlympics @TeamUSA To both teams great work great game. Can‚Äôt ask for anything more then a game like that no matter what the outcome. All involved deserve a Gold Medal for dedications and perseverance so proud to be a FELLOW HOCKEY PLAYER. Whether on sled, foot or upright all for one !! #usaproud
@USParalympics @TeamUSA @usahockey Congrats way to persevere and work hard and remain dedicated towards your goal. But we must also give praise to Team Canada üá®üá¶ for their decication and hard work. Both teams rather all teams who participated  deserve a great deal of recognition and congratulation #proudusa
@BreitbartNews Good boycot his movies
@SarahPalinUSA Come on Sarah call it for what it is. He is running out of the spot light for the obvious reasons. The best way to cover for it is to blame it on Trump (popular in Hollywood) Let me know when he is moving I‚Äôll help him pack up or even drive him to the airport.
@AnaheimDucks Stop punching everyone Kevin.!!!!!
@UBmenshoops Go Bulls. Good luck today!!!!!
@prohockeyrumors He is no OV. Keep him away from the Rangers.
@NYGovCuomo Take it up with our 2 Democratic Senators who were just working with a Democratic President for the 8 years prior and didn‚Äôt do a thing about it. So how can you blame Trump at all now. What was done the prior 8 years. Stop it Andy doesn‚Äôt make for a good fight.
@lirr_grievances just don‚Äôt understand people who talk the whole way while on a publicly crowded train and as soon as they get to their stop you hear. Oh I am at my stop I‚Äôll talk to you later and hang up. Maybe that‚Äôs when you make the call when you get off the train not on it.
@lirr_grievances just wondering when did LIRR train cars become PHONE BOOTHS, MOVIE THEATERS and MUSIC LISTENING BOOTHS...
@LIRR really need to look into a strong messaging customer service campaign of CELL PHONE use on the train. We the costumers cannot be asking others to get off their phones. For obvious reasons. Poster announcements‚Äî-come on the train cars are not PHONE BOOTHS!!!

@NYPDnews E train is already becoming homeless shelter today. Need to get a few guys at the Wtc chambers street station walk the trains while they are waiting in station to clear them or get these people the help they need .
@NYPDTransit E Train line. Homeless taking over already. 12:45 in the afternoon.Thought send two guys to WTC/Chamber Street Station and while the train is in the station waiting being last stop have the Officers walk the trains clear them or offer help.OR maybe homeless outreach?
@nyc311 here we go E train filled with homeless at 12:45 pm.	Let‚Äôs go...come on.....get some cops at the WTC...chamber street stop so while the trains are waiting at the station the cops can walk the trains and clear them or get them help.
@mcuban oh boy Mark. More in common with Donald Trump each and everyday. Another peel comes off. Any statement on the story in the NYC Daily News about 2011 activity.

@TomUrtzJr Great article keep-em coming....well written...filled with good information and sound thoughts.     NHL hockey the best sport in the world!!!!!!!!!!
@TomUrtzJr All in all, McDonagh appeared in 516 games tallying 187 goals and 238 assists for 238 points. 		In your article:	Stats are a little off for Mac D. Thats a lot of goals (187). I would have asked for... 4.... first rounders if he scored that many goals.
@StanFischler @NYRangers Don't do it. No No No... Come on Stan you cannot think this is a good move. Go youth. Go young string and fast.
@NHLBruins Congrats on landing a real pro.Only hope they play him with 37. Look out NHL 61 is on his way to win a cup with the big bad Bruins.I am now officially a Boston Bruins Fan 61 will score 15 before the end of the season and then exploded in the playoffs and be MVP of the playoffs.
@chicagotribune @TribuneKevin No not at all. Emotional moment for her. Shows the heart that she has for her team and country. She now realizes the implication that her actions caused and has apologized. Apology accepted !!!!

@NYRangers This is what makes NHL players the best professional sport athletes in the world !!!
@EricHolder Nice try ...., stand up like a man and say your administration dropped the ball. Your administration got out flanked by the Russians !!!!!!! It was done on your watch !!!!!

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Geraldo, it's no different when Obama spoke. The Republicans sat also. That's why it's come to the heartland of America to vote in a none professional politician as our President. Drain the swamp#. People all people are tired of this. It's embarrassing it really is.
@CharlieDaniels Have you ever looked how other countries handled their returning veterans transitioning back into civilian life?
@CharlieDaniels We need to do more for our returning veterans...fully agree. We need them engaged and give them the feeling of self-worth upon arriving back home and follow their travels and transition back into civilian society. They need America's support.
@BMonzoWFAN Why asks questions like that. Just shows that it is all a waste of time. Shouldn't have to do media day of those are the question that are going to be asked. Who cares about the Jets!!!!?

@FoxBusiness Boycott the Super Bowl
@SenGillibrand Wake up Kristen America is a huge country. Others across this great country don't believe this should even be an issue. Here illegally then reapply to come back in legally.
@SenGillibrand You should have spearheaded this issues years ago during the previous administration to have all apply while being allowed to stay. Then this would not be an issue today. Don't make the current admin look like the bad guys for enforcing the LAW. SHOULD HAVE CHANGED IT YEARS AGO!
@SenGillibrand If they started the process to apply for proper citizenship prior to this shutdown then give them a chance to stay and let's see how it plays out. If they didn't or their parents didn't then they are illegal and should have to leave and reapply. Is this something new Kirsten?
@SenatorDurbin Did any of them know that they were here illegally or are they just finding it out now? Have any of they applied or filled out the proper paperwork or are they just waiting for forgiveness
@NasusLavok @HillaryClinton  https://t.co/8BSn4sE37l

@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Funny how these politicians did this on a Friday night. Yea after they put in their 40 work week(yeah right). I would love to see if thier paychecks have a deductions for the shutdown. ASK THAT QUESTION LOU PLEASE!!!
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Hey Lou a government shut down works. We can't give away tax payer dollars when the government is shut down. Work furlough nice save some money. Thanks Democracts they final did something that saves the federal government money instead of giving it away!!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Hey Chuck wow turning the whole countries into dreamers!! None of us have a government/COUNTRY to turn to for help anymore do we. USA CLOSED FOR BUSINESS GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR FREE HAND OUTS!!!! no what kinda like that idea come to think of it.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuck funny how you guys did this on a Saturday when most Federal employees don't work nor get paid for. Let's see if you have the backbone to continue this during a business work week when you'll be taking money out of peoples pocket. Hey no job no health insurance right Chuck
@NYGovCuomo Just another tax. Keep giving the taxpaying citizens money away. What's the next freebie going to be Andy? Before fixes, all others problems PR, Dreamers, free College use our TAX money to fix our MTA system without taxes-TOLLING manhattan. #dontvoteforcuomoforpresident

@NYGovCuomo What about all the tax paying students that owe student loans. How about helping them out.

As I have said by monitoring social media sites increases your work force by the size of your community. Great tool. Hint always request a photo when a request comes in. Helps with documentation.
@ErinKingSweeney @steffdaz @HempsteadTown @LauraAGillen @DDunneSr @Newsday @MTA @LIRR Yes responsibility could fall upon others but if TOH (OEM) has a incident command center set up for snow emergency we should just have to either lean over right or left or pick up the phone and say GET IT DONE LIRR response to snow removal at stations has been sub par at best...
@ErinKingSweeney @steffdaz @HempsteadTown @LauraAGillen @DDunneSr @Newsday I know you can‚Äôt do everything but need someone to shovel walkway to gain entrance onto sidewalk instead of having people walk into street.

@LIRR let‚Äôs evaluate the choice of words used by the organization. STUFF, just thinking that it sounds better usinging the word BELONGINGS instead of the word STUFF. Just pointing it out. I understand the message and agree. To alert  people, make them responsible for their belongings

@brooklyncowboy1 @realDonaldTrump @SebGorka @PressSec Kevin I am Trump supported because I wanted him to shake things up in Washington which he is doing.

@winningponies However you want to justify  it go right ahead. The point being is you would have to use the 1-6 combo to get the super. So a .10cent box with 6 numbers tell me how much it cost?  A .10cent box I am looking at 36.00 if you second tiers stopped at the 6.good call though 1st horse

@clementstable if it wasn‚Äôt for bad luck for the Pinchbeck there would be no luck. Another jockey that rides him into a wall of horses and gets him into trouble.
@RajivMaragh wow poor decision to try and pull horse to outside in the 4th when your at the 1/8 pole. Stay inside and dig in. The horse you tried to pull out and around got 2nd. Stay inside you would have at least gotten 2nd.

@immigrant_legal @KINGOFCOMSENSE What about Bill O'Reilly And Roger Ailes of Fox ????
@SteveBannen Well let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs been going on at Fox.. Bill Oreilly being accused, and the real kick off to this whole wave of allegation was the former CEO  Roger Ailes...think they‚Äôll be staying away from all of this.
@CNN It‚Äôs just coffee.
@winningponies You had to go into the second tier selections in race 2 and use those selection also for a winning ticket...that making you go 4 deep only in that race. Then you had to go at least 3 deep in all the other races...
@winningponies The way IÔ∏è figure it in order to have that .20 pick six as a winner using your selection the ticket would have cost 194.40 and the payout was only 112.90 my MATH says that‚Äôs a loss of 81.40.... not so good of an investment ???? Is it ???
@winningponies That‚Äôs the payout for the ticket? Or is that the cost to play all the combinations that would have had to be played in order to have that. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE COST OF TICKET TO GET THAT WIN USING YOUR NUMBERS ????
@winningponies terrible at Aqueduct today.. how do I request a refund.... pee U ....
@FoxBusiness @SteveForbesCEO Everyone wants to be critical let‚Äôs see hard numbers. Let‚Äôs see the tax proposals in real time. Real numbers. Do someone‚Äôs tax return ...
@FoxBusiness @SteveForbesCEO Get Mr. Smith race return from last year and then do it with the new tax reform rules and let‚Äôs see the difference
@FoxBusiness @SteveForbesCEO I still haven‚Äôt seen a comparison done with a persons taxes from this past years tax return to what is presented for this years and see the numbers. Why hasn‚Äôt this been done yet ????
