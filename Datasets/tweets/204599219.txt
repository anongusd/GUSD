Another line from CBO report the GOP will glob onto: "the estimates in this report are uncertain."
My talking point were I a GOP legislator: Average premiums will be 10 percent lower by 2026 compared to current law.
This is interesting: CBO says no individual market death spiral regardless of whether it's O'care or GOP plan.
In 2026: 28 million uninsured under O'care; 52 million uninsured under GOP plan.
CBO says the GOP health plan would cover 14 million fewer people but lower deficits by $337 billion over a decade.
It's 4:02 p.m. Do you know where your CBO score is?

@CalebJSmith Ah, now I see.

it will be a miracle from heaven if they figure this out https://t.co/0fY1vX4xRT
Insurers need to know whether they'll get cost-sharing subsidies in the next 30 days, AHIP President Marilyn Tavenner says.
Sen. Murray is quite quotable this morning: "We can't repair the roof while Republicans are burning the house down."
enjoyed this! https://t.co/TwNvhPL0Oo
Marilyn Tavenner will emphasize this key point to Senate panel: If you ditch individual mandate, you must mandate continuous coverage.
Here's your first look at what AHIP president will ask Congress for this morning with O'care repeal-and-replace: https://t.co/vRYSgnlxE5
@OverTheMoonbat Good question. "Pro-life" and "pro-choice" are merely slogans. We use AP style: "anti-abortion" and "pro abortion rights."
Okay, Price and Mnuchin nominations are now advancing to the full Senate. GOP voted without Dems this morning.
Hatch is holding another executive session this AM to try to confirm Price, Mnuchin, but looks like Dems not coming again.
Hatch at his most infuriated acts like most people when they're mildly frustrated. https://t.co/FExxrLeaKK
This boycott of Price/Mnuchin is not unprecedented. Rs boycotted vote on Obama's EPA pick back in 2013: https://t.co/4YNNB4SDSB
@jamiedupree @krisvjohnson ah, interesting. thanks
R's are saying this is the first time ever one party has boycotted a confirmation vote. Anyone know whether that's true?
Hatch says he "fully intends" for Price/Mnuchin vote to occur; will schedule another markup "at my convenience."
Hatch: I've about had it."
Sen. Hatch: "This is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in my 40 years in the United States Senate."
Spox for Wyden says Dems won't go into hearing room at all to vote on Price/Mnuchin.
Sen. Hatch, speaking to committee room sans Dems: "I’m very disappointed in this type of crap, my gosh, there’s no excuse for it."
Dems are boycotting 10 a.m. Senate Finance confirmation votes for Price and Mnuchin.

Pence pledged that Trump will defund Planned Parenthood (without naming the org specifically) and appoint anti-abortion justice.
Pence says Trump "asked me to thank you for your support, for your stand for life." #marchforlife
Pence: This is the best day I've seen for the March for Life in more ways than one.
Media on lockdown in tent during Pence's entire speech, apparently. #marchforlife
Just talked to David Daleiden. Says Mike Pence was the person who inspired him to target Planned Parenthood in the first place.
yuge https://t.co/Y0sKuuoasm
And donuts here too. March for Life is really upping its media game.
It would be good for March for Life if Kellyanne Conway avoided using the phrase "alternative facts" in her address this morning.
(Whether it is good coffee remains to be seen.)
March for Life is fueling the press with free coffee in media tent this year.
The weather is cold but not snowy--a big improvement over last year's snowstorm that blew in just in time for March for Life.

An O'care repeal and replace bill is coming in two weeks, according to a top Republican per @susanferrechio
Calendar's filling up with O'care repeal hearings next week. So far, E&amp;C oversight on Tuesday and HELP on Wednesday.
good point https://t.co/6UCY02ly1T
@dylanlscott @caitlinnowens Well yes and no. The procedure to some extent determines the policies that can be dealt with.
so now it's "repeal plus" https://t.co/Y9uDZDN9NG this strategy is both harder and easier for Republicans
@radioalarm I prefer print for that particular publication
@radioalarm The Economist, a billion times over. I'm always at my smartest when I read it regularly.

Rep. Cummings told @rking_19 that he's planning to meet with Trump to discuss cracking down on drug prices.
I asked Sen. Wyden about this plan today--said states must only expand on Ocare. https://t.co/NWurJb6Uf2
The questions HHS nominee Tom Price answered, sort of answered and didn't answer at all today: https://t.co/P6fcvRQZFH
After hearing, Sen. Wyden wouldn't tell us whether he'll support Price for HHS sec. Said he'll announce in a statement.
ugh https://t.co/O5kKhHhA9m
As Price hearing wraps up, only Sens. Hatch and Wyden are left.
May we please pause this hearing for 10 minutes of group yoga? Feeling sore from sitting this long.
Sen. McCaskill: "What we have after repeal is Trumpcare. Whatever is left after the dust settles is Trumpcare."
Price just did a massive dodge on Sen. Bennet's question about whether Medicaid expansion will be repealed.
House is expected to pass ban on abortion coverage in O'care plans around 4:30 p.m. Passed the same bill two years ago.
"It's true he said that." Price, asked whether Trump was lying when he promised ACA replacement coming after his confirmation.
Price: "I think contraception is imperative for many many women."
Rep. Price says he agrees with Sen. Menendez that abortions don't cause breast cancer and vaccines don't cause autism.
Weirdest moment of Price hearing: Sen. Roberts to Sen. Hatch: "did you really wink at me and smile? bless your heart"
Lots of camera clicking as Price enters the room. More Dems here than Republicans so far.
Spotted in Price hearing: former Rep. Phil Gingrey, also from Georgia.
It's just great when flacks preface the most boring, useless shred of information with "off the record."

Trump's O'care exec order doesn't erase any of the law, but it does signal he's serious about doing away with it: https://t.co/ZR9U7zAeTP
Statement from @repgregwalden : “heartening to see President Trump take immediate action to begin undoing the damage caused by Obamacare."
Exec order says to lift requirements that place "fiscal burden" on any state or result in any costs to individuals, families, providers.
Here are more details: Exec order directs all agencies to waiver, defer, grant exemptions from ACA requirements as they're able.
@bhbrantley Good question. Because incremental news is still news.
@dylanlscott no, but maybe on Pluto which Trump is reinstating as a planet
@dylanlscott nothing on the White House website yet
This executive order appears to be just a vague memo directing agencies to "ease the burden of Ocare." Whatever that means.
details, please! https://t.co/pyP9OuXaVJ

Trump promised to repeal Obamacare on "day one." He has 8.5 hours left.

I'm waiting for Trump to use the word "bigly" in his speech.

"it seems likely that a large swath of the public really does think Ocare and the ACA are different things" https://t.co/gaxFUwGL6r

Useful explanation of ethical concerns around Price's medical stocks --&gt;  https://t.co/mNcTf7BbhX
Likely true, but quite unfortunate. Maybe we'll be surprised. https://t.co/ImDeTTtqM0
@steveabowden @sangerkatz ooooh, I hadn't seen the reference to buses. that's a good one too.
@steveabowden @sangerkatz huh? i was just noting that the word bridge was used a lot
Price's HELP confirmation hearing has concluded after nearly four hours.
The collapsing bridge seems to be the dominant Republican ACA metaphor at the Price hearing.
Listening to political rhetoric around health reform, you'd think Ds and Rs are worlds apart but they're generally not.
Sen. Alexander is pressing Price on whether Mar. 1 is a key deadline for getting a repeal/replace plan together.
Trump told Axios healthcare is his most important domestic topic and wants to push for Medicaid block grants. https://t.co/YXJpfje0ma
