@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer It's very difficult to live alongside people who practice that not because you are not tolerant of their so-called Faith, but it's because they do not tolerate other people's beliefs

@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer You can't police what people do in the privacy of their own homes, but when what they're doing begins to affect others in the community then it's time to step up.

@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer I wonder how one feels good about siding up to a person who believes that marrying a child is okay and that they are in fact not abusing a child? I don't understand that kind of thinking. A child is a child is a child they are not an adult.
@MikeCam74490020 @sandydbp @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I think a lot of the deep State members were advising him poorly because they knew that he did not know any better they also counted on him trusting the Integrity of those offices and their positions. And he found out quickly they were corrupt

@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer Makes you wonder what our government is doing to put a stop to Illegal behaviors especially Sharia which is clearly not allowed in this country, and yet people like Ellison and Omar and many many others are doing it daily basically thumbing their nose at our laws

I support Free Speech but I don't support hate speech
@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer Supporting that type of religion is basically saying it's okay to be racist biased a thief a criminal against other people?
@conniesmiles @sweetromance @LauraLoomer Not to mention giving people a platform to talk about how Christians and Jewish people are filthy and they can steal their property take their lives treat their women as sex slaves and this isn't just women they're talking about they're talking about children and young ladies

@conscious_sis @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump There are voter laws on the books in every state. There are people who ignore those laws. Voter fraud is rampid.

@NJS230 @latimes Don't start putting conditions on your right to arm yourself and protect your family, because that is exactly what it comes down to. And if the world is any indication of what could happen in this country you better be blessed that you have the Second Amendment
@NJS230 @latimes I think of the zero regulations as a misunderstanding of what the NRA stand for. NRA supports the Second Amendment as should all citizens of the United States. To do anything to the contrary is infringing on others rights and that is a mistake.
@backatchaslick @BlueSea1964 @sofinique1 Nope. Common sense
@NJS230 @latimes Sensible regulations, now that's an interesting thing. We already have sensible regulations we already have background checks. There will come a day when most people will regret the problems they have caused with the 2A. You really can fool some of the people all of the time

@NJS230 @latimes It may be possible that there is an immediate off switch, but I believe that the off switch is on the microphone that Acosta had in his hand I don't think there's anything so fancy as an automatic off switch. He probably should have automatically shut off his mouth
@NJS230 @latimes I see your point, but I also have to recognize disrespectful behavior when it comes to POTUS and the other reporters that are in the room that also deserve to have their voice heard as well. I will stand by the fact that I believe that Acosta was wrong.
@NJS230 @latimes There is a remote off switch? And who has control of the off switch? That should have been immediately engaged and if not then I have to wonder why it wasn't
@NJS230 @latimes Is it possible that I could have pissed off even more people tonight? I feel for anyone who has suffered a tragedy but people need to understand that it is not the left or right that is at fault here it is a sick or vengeful person who does acts like this it is not the guns fault

@emu10kx @BlueSea1964 @Golfinggary5222 We already have socialist organized news media you see what they want you to see. Your eyes may tell you something else your gut may tell you something else, but if you are not strong enough to see past what they're feeding you you will be lost

@TwinRoots28 @charliekirk11 If they were looking for work don't you think they would have trickled in a little bit at a time? When you have 4 5 6 10 15 thousand people that's not a need for work all of the sudden. That's clearly an invasion, and a coerced Invasion at that

@BeginningInves2 @Primal2112 @Tell_Michelle_ It's amazing when you hear all these people talking about racism and violence and crime but the facts speak for themselves so the only conclusion is mainstream media has led people to believe a fallacy that does not exist

@TrumpsDC @Paloosas You should be fearful for your country.
@randyyyyy_h @shetweetsme That should never have been allowed. But are we a country of religious freedom? Of course we are. We respect everyone's right to believe is they choose, however when our laws are used against that respect of others, then laws are enacted to protect intolorent religions
@shetweetsme @TrumpsDC @KMGGaryde Obama took his pledge of office on the Koran sitting on top of the Bible what the hell did that tell you? I couldn't believe anybody was dumb enough to vote for the guy to begin with I still can't believe they even listen to him
@TrumpsDC @Paloosas Thank the media for that confusion. It is a deliberate Act you are being targeted deliberately
@Dobermanluvchr1 @BlueSea1964 People like Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi can call you a bigot and biased and racist all they want, but the truth is this has been played out in other countries so you're not a fool to believe that they're out to get you because the fact is they are
@Dobermanluvchr1 @BlueSea1964 The gift of discernment is not apparently granted to everyone. Votes need to be carefully considered when a person is casting one for potential candidate. All bias aside survival of your country should be your first and foremost thought.
@backatchaslick @BlueSea1964 @sofinique1 No she's not American and if she says she is she's talking out both sides of her mouth cuz her first obligation is to Allah not Christ not the United States and not its citizens mark my words
@michael01958903 @BlueSea1964 @Trump454545 I can understand people being fooled once, but being fooled twice that just plain stupidity
@WilliamMoran07 @BlueSea1964 @ItsJustJill Americans need to understand that people born in other countries who strive to become a part of our government does not always have our best interest at heart. There are people who tried to destroy this country from within and it begins by gaining a seat in our government
@tweetmelissa7 @BlueSea1964 @realBlack_Trump Yes that's a good question isn't it?
@emu10kx @BlueSea1964 @Golfinggary5222 He is trying so hard to save this country and it's a shame that more people can't see that it's like they're blind
@emu10kx @BlueSea1964 @Golfinggary5222 Donald Trump is trying hard to fight against it. As much as people don't like him I think a lot more people would if they understood what he was fighting against
@eeclwa @BlueSea1964 @wimvisscher777 She is working for Allah. She is not working for the United States or the citizens that live here. She is only concerned with her own kind on this you can take to the bank

@fapresbot @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump How does a man who was never involved with politics and trusted the people that he was around in the people he did business with just suddenly turn on him like a snake? I think that's why he enjoys telling the story of the snake.
@GenoManSC @TomFitton @theTeddyHeffner @realDonaldTrump He used his own money for his campaign he couldn't be bought he couldn't be bribed he didn't take money for promises and that is one of the reasons they don't like him
@GenoManSC @TomFitton @theTeddyHeffner @realDonaldTrump POTUS was part of the crowd before he became president, but once elected he was Enemy Number One and they set out to destroy him. Their plans didn't go as  expected, he has found out, and has been schooled in some of the most awful ways on how evil and corrupt they really are.
@GiNaLAA @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I had the oddest feeling about him probably the first or second time that I saw him and when I heard him spoke there was just something about him that didn't sit right with me and I thought wow this man is a very odd man I don't think this is going to work
@PurSpectives_ @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump In one way you might think it was obstruction, but on the other he did recuse himself which meant he would have nothing to do with the investigation whatsoever but that also meant that he wouldn't defend the president either what I'm in knowing what was his conflict of interest
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Yeah he should have just told POTUS up front that he was going to recuse himself but then if he did that he wouldn't have been able to get a paycheck for 2 years for watching our president get attacked daily by these people
