FACT OF THE DAY: Accounting for certain assumptions, a universal health care model like that proposed in the Green New Deal could cost roughly $36 trillion between 2020 and 2029.

FACT OF THE DAY: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rulemaking has resulted in 30 finalized regulations which cost $3.1 billion and 24,251,630 paperwork hours.
3) The congressional budget process is well suited to addressing the need to responsibly fund discretionary spending priorities in a divided Congress.
2) The original conception of the BCA and two follow-on amendments provide a valuable model against which to compare future cap adjustment legislation;
1) The BCA made an important down-payment on what will need to be a significant fiscal consolidation, and reinstated a more formal disciplining process on discretionary spending;
AAF Director of Fiscal Policy @GordonGrayDC testified to the U.S. House Budget Committee on responsibly funding the nation’s defense and domestic priorities. Here are three key observations: https://t.co/nMYq83ZOtt
3) A $15 per hour minimum wage would impose such job loss while, at best, providing minimal assistance to low-income workers. At worst, however, reductions in jobs and work hours could be so severe that earnings among low-income workers could, on net, decline.
2) More than doubling the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would threaten to undermine this progress by putting millions of jobs at risk.
1) In recent years, the labor market has experienced profound growth: Businesses are continuing to create jobs at a strong pace, the unemployment rate is at the lowest levels in decades, wages are rising, and millions of workers are returning to the labor force.

The politics of Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to tax the wealthy appears to have the sole goal of making affluent Americans worse off rather than financing beneficial programs. #Eakinomics https://t.co/7LuMrdBCPs
A “Green New Deal” that includes a proposal to move 100 percent of U.S. electricity production to renewable sources would require at least $5.7 trillion of investment in renewable energy and storage. https://t.co/r8iEeNrJ1K
Trump Administration plans for a new, voluntary Part D payment model are a move in the right direction, but any benefits will likely be limited. More sweeping changes to the program’s structure are needed to contain costs. https://t.co/cj0LLxSNgc
How should one think about Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to tax wealthy Americans? Well, from a policy perspective, there are a number of issues. #Eakinomics https://t.co/7LuMrdk1qS
FACT OF THE DAY: Moving electricity production to 100 percent renewable sources would cost an annualized $423.9 billion—more than the entire retail cost of electricity in the United States in 2016.

FACT OF THE DAY: There have been 29 bear market corrections in the stock market, but only 5 recessions.
A well-designed carbon tax can help to achieve other tax reform goals and is much more efficient than the command-and-control regulatory approach. But a well-designed carbon tax faces some severe political headwinds.- @djheakin https://t.co/x6naVpU5j1

4. Even modest process reforms can contribute to reducing risks to the economy from budget-related disruptions.
3. Process reforms can be radical, reorganize federal institutions, and directly affect the operation of programs; more modest – and likely more achievable reforms – can improve the presentation of and timing of fiscal policy decisions.
2. Fiscal problems are not solved by process solutions alone, but process improvements can facilitate fiscal reforms.
1. The federal government does not actually formulate a fiscal policy, and the result is poor budgetary outcomes.
