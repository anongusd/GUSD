“Making livelihoods of our federal workers a pawn for political games is a disgrace. The shutdown was a stunt, engineered by the president ... one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values.” —Stacey Abrams, in her #SOTU response

9/ Remember: The clock is ticking. 		If no deal is agreed on by all parties before March 29, the UK will experience a potentially catastrophic scenario in which the country simply crashes out of the EU with no rules or safeguards in place.
8/ They can’t force May’s administration to make significant changes but could put pressure on the prime minister and send a powerful message on what Parliament will accept when it comes to Brexit.
7/ Now Parliament gets to chime in. Conservatives (May’s party) and the Labour (the opposition) will get to offer amendments to her plan B, in hopes of gaining more control.
6/ The challenge: The EU, which May negotiated the Brexit deal with, has basically always said that a plan B-like deal was the only one on offer.		And May hasn’t been willing to entertain major alternatives, like a 2nd referendum to give the public a say. https://t.co/1ID3PvAmdK

3/ On January 21, she then had to deliver her so-called “plan B.” But it was really similar to the failed plan A, containing no concrete changes. https://t.co/5fGhjwx2X2

5/ When are the Democratic primary debates?		The Democratic National Committee will hold 12 debates, starting in June 2019 and extending into 2020. The first four debates will be held in the earliest primary and caucus states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.
4/ Who else might run?		The rumored Democratic list is far too long to fit in a tweet. At least 24 people are reportedly considering a run. Some of the biggest names are former VP Joe Biden, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Amy Klobuchar, and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke. https://t.co/MUkkUuxXvI
3/ The Democratic field is expected to be crowded — and it’s already growing. Here’s who has officially joined the race so far: https://t.co/aMu9ID0JlM
2/ Who is definitely running?		On the Republican side, there’s only President Trump. A few people — like 2016 candidate John Kasich and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan — are reportedly considering a challenge. But they would be major underdogs if they entered the ring.

8/8 So the votes probably won’t resolve the shutdown, but they may defuse the tension for a few days and give Republicans a chance to regroup.		It might sound strange, but these days, it’s just how the Senate works.	 	Read more from @dylanlscott: https://t.co/sBxNEEaD2O
7/ Senators will get a public opportunity to release their frustrations by voting to open the government — and McConnell will have shown Democratic leaders and President Trump that neither course has the necessary support in the Senate right now.
6/ Both proposals would need 60 votes to advance. 		But there likely won’t be enough Republicans joining Democrats to pass a clean bill, and few Democrats are willing to back Trump’s wall. 	 	So what’s the point?
5/ The second bill: A temporary proposal to fund the government at existing levels — with no immigration strings attached — which would reopen the government until February 8. A corresponding version of this bill has already been passed by the House.
4/ The first bill: a proposal that President Trump announced on Saturday, which would fund the government while providing billions of dollars for border security and temporary protections for DACA recipients. https://t.co/yPOBOemIiD https://t.co/2R5TUuQ2nL
3/ Failed votes are useful for Senate leadership because they give the appearance of work being done and force a reset once a legislative path is blocked.	 	McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiated a deal to vote on two proposals.
2/ The pageantry of failed floor votes has become one of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s calling cards in the Senate. It used to be that a failed bill on the Senate floor signaled weak leadership, but McConnell has used them to his advantage. https://t.co/wgvowVGIs6

5/ Guaidó, a 35-year-old who was relatively unknown until recently, says he'll assume the presidential role today and will call for new elections in the future. 		He says he doesn’t plan to hold on to the presidency indefinitely.
4/ Because of the sham vote, an opposition leader named Juan Guaidó – the head of the National Assembly (the country’s legislative body) — has mobilized thousands of anti-Maduro protesters and said he’s the rightful, but temporary, president of the country. https://t.co/c7P0crU0xJ

9/9 Still have questions? Read more about what’s *really* going on at the border, from @dlind: https://t.co/Zb74yARard
8/ A 2017 Pew study found that people who lived less than 350 miles from the border were the least likely to support Trump’s wall. 		In other words, the people supposedly on the front lines of what Trump calls a crisis are those least inclined to support his proposed solution.
7/ Walls are designed to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected. But the kids and families who show up at the border aren’t trying to do that: They’re turning themselves in and asking for asylum. 		That's something they could do at a port of entry, even with a wall.
6/ There is no evidence of a terrorist crisis at the border. A total of six known or suspected terrorists were caught at the US-Mexico border in the first half of 2018 — not thousands, as White House officials had previously claimed.
5/ Trump claims we need a wall to stop the flow of drugs coming into the US from Mexico. 		It’s true that a lot of drugs come in via the Mexican border. But most come in at legal ports of entry, often hidden in cars or trucks. A wall would have no impact. https://t.co/NGK0xewwng
4/ The Trump administration is unequipped to deal with the families and children coming into the country — and the results have been tragic. 		Before December 2018, a decade had passed since a child died in Border Patrol custody. In December 2018, two children did.
3/ A 2017 report estimated that children and families made up less than 2% of border crossers between 2003 and 2008. For the past few months, they’ve made up more than half of all apprehensions. https://t.co/KMlq8qj9Ri
2/ In historical context, illegal border crossings are way down. Border Patrol apprehensions are at the lowest they’ve been since the 1970s.		The difference now is we’re seeing unprecedented numbers of children and families crossing the border. https://t.co/tk2SyKxGqd
1/ This government shutdown is all about money for a border wall, and President Trump wants America to believe that the US-Mexico border is in crisis. 		That isn't true. Here are 7 facts to help you understand what’s happening at the border.
Could Trump declare a national emergency to get his border wall built? The answer is...maybe. Here's what you should know. https://t.co/BcrUoPCLCo
