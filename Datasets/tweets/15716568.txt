The media really needs to realize these trends, that early Election Night results are conservative. And they should leave it to California pundits like me to report the truth. We stay up later!
But they were wrong. We picked up 2 Senate seats, and Florida is going to a recount. And we won back control of the House - with more California seats getting called in our favor. Josh Harder was down by 1,200 votes on Election Night, but now he is ahead by 2 percentage points.
Last week, I was getting out the vote in Turlock for Josh Harder‚Äîbut I couldn't help myself &amp; checked my phone. One of the worst pundits (James Carville) said early in the night it was "not going to be a blue wave." As 3 Senate Democrats lost re-election, that was the perception.
But some of us in California stayed up late, and knew before we went to bed that she won Pennsylvania by 9 points. So it really was a "single-digit victory." The pundits were wrong, just like they were this time.
East Coast bias is nothing new. I remember in April 2008, when Barack Obama &amp; Hillary Clinton were duking it out for the nomination. Hillary was expected to win Pennsylvania, and she did. As East Coast reporters went to bed, she was up by 10‚Äîso they said "double-digit victory."
The first two states to close polls are Indiana &amp; Kentucky, which are both very Republican. So whatever happens there is not representative of the country. And w so many California votes by mail (counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day), the results change fast.
It has been 7 days since the election, and early conventional wisdom on Election Night‚Äîset by lazy East Coast journalists who go to bed early‚Äîwas wrong. It really was a blue wave, with ripples a week later. Judging by how results come in, this should have been totally expected.

COMPARE that with what Trump does now. A deranged Trump supporter sent pipe bombs to Democrats, and a deranged anti-Semite kills 11 people in a synagogue. Rather than acknowledge his complicity in these toxic hate crimes, he calls the press the enemy of the people.
"Reed also apologized for the white evangelical church, which he said was on the sidelines or the wrong side of many racial issues during the turbulent civil rights years. 'We come today bearing the burden of that history with broken hearts, a repentant spirit &amp; ready hands."

If we win, we really should have won by more. If we lose, we should have won. But we don't live in a real democracy.		Just like in 2016, when 2.9 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton‚Äîbut because of where Trump voters lived he became President.
The House districts are very gerrymandered to keep a GOP majority, and the hot Senate races are almost entirely held in red states. So if we make significant gains (and even win back control), it will only be because our movement is so powerful that we won despite these odds.
Election Day is 13 days away. It's important to remember that no matter what happens, we are fighting on an uneven playing field that is deliberately rigged against us. Even if we have an unprecedented level of enthusiasm against Republicans, they still have home court advantage.

Brett Kavanaugh has done nothing but deny the allegations, and let his Republican allies do the dirty work of humiliating Dr. Christine Ford and treating her worse than they did to Anita Hill. Here is a story of how another man replied when confronted: https://t.co/FNEI8Ygh9Z
We need to break down the rape culture, and determine that how we have allowed it to last so long is not tolerable. And if that forces a lot more than just Brett Kavanaugh to confront what they did as 17-year-olds, so be it.
I am furious at the attitude some men complain that this will "ruin" Kavanaugh's life. No, it will not. A lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is a privilege, not a right. If he does not get confirmed, he will have missed an opportunity. But. He. Will. Be. Okay. (more)
The all-boys Georgetown Prep School that Brett Kavanaugh attended probably had many cases of attempted rape. But just because it was common DOES NOT MAKE IT OKAY. In fact, this is exactly the moment we need to look at how pervasive sexual assault culture is and say Enough! (more)
But it is true there are a lot more cases of this happening, as the #MeToo and #WhyIDidntReport movement exposed. Being a victim of sexual assault is a deeply traumatizing &amp; humiliating experience, and many choose not to speak up. (more)
The Christine Ford story is bringing up a lot of disturbing aspects of rape culture into the forefront.	I have heard Kavanaugh apologists say "every high schooler does this." Umm, first of all, NO!! We all did things at 17 we are now ashamed of, but most of us did not rape (cont)

A friend posted this, and it's worth repeating:		Just last year, as a sitting judge, Brett Kavanaugh denied a 17 year old immigrant an abortion. So, he clearly does believe in holding 17 year olds accountable for their behavior for the rest of their lives. Even if you don't.
Clarence Thomas in 1991, on Anita Hill: "If you really want an idea of how I treated women, then ask the majority of women who worked for me. They're out here. Give them as much time as you have given one person."		Brett Kavanaugh has found 65 women he did not rape.

@RocheStrategies #NotAllDemocrats
@RocheStrategies Fight for Ranked Choice Voting, do what you can to change the rules of the game - so that Greens don't play spoiler. I support all of those reforms. But until you change those rules, fuck off.
@RocheStrategies A candidate who can only muster 1,056 votes does not deserve more than 5 seconds of my attention. The Greens can't organize themselves out of a paper bag, and need to join the Democratic Party by moving it to the Left. Otherwise, they deserve our anger.
OH-12 special election update. Democrat Danny O'Connor is back in the lead, by 0.1%. He finished with 65% in Franklin County, needed 63 to win. He is currently at 46% with half of Delaware County, needs 45 to win.
@RocheStrategies Playing the spoiler so you can satisfy yourself with 1,056 votes (which is pitiful) is a pathetic display of vanity. The Green Party loves to blame everyone except themselves.
Yep, right now with 89% of precincts counted in OH-12 - this Green Party candidate has 1,056 votes. The Democrat Danny O'Connor is losing by 1,031 votes. https://t.co/gBVUIYF7Bx
OH-12 is too damn close for comfort right now. https://t.co/P3n6BBb2t0
OH-12 update: With 85% of the vote, Democrat Danny O'Connor has a less than 1% lead - with only Delaware County votes left outstanding. He's running at 48% there (including early vote), and needs at least 45% to win. But half the county hasn't come in yet.
And right as I wrote that, Danny O'Connor got back in the lead - very very slightly. But that's because Franklin County votes came in. Much that's left now is Delaware County. Please, suburban Republicans. Find your sanity. Join our party!
OH-12: Bad news is that Danny O'Connor is now down a point with 66% of precincts counted. Good news is only remaining votes come from his 2 best counties: Franklin &amp; Delaware. But mostly Delaware, which he took a big hit in Election Day votes. Will suburban Republicans wake up?
32% of OH-12 special elections votes are in. Race is narrowing, but Danny O'Connor still has  seven-point lead. And he's holding his own in GOP areas. Marion County (home of former Pres Warren Harding) only county with all votes in- he's at 31.2% there. He needs 30% there to win.
Good news from @stevesingiser = most of the outstanding election day votes come from Franklin &amp; Delaware counties that are bluer. We shall see.
Early OH-12 special election results look good for Democrat Danny O'Connor, but early voting always skews Dem. My fear is rural Muskigum County - where he's at 35% and needs 39% to win. But he's more than compensating everywhere else. Cheat sheet here: https://t.co/PQ6PNVWHvG

Let's be crystal clear. The Obama Administration detained migrant kids who crossed the border unaccompanied, but they DID NOT SEPARATE children who were with their families. Trump has made a bad situation much worse, which is cruel and criminal.
@brianjcavanaugh @Thenina77 @cameron_kasky @marcorubio For the record, a lot of us were complaining.

@Thenina77 @cameron_kasky @brianjcavanaugh @marcorubio What happened under Obama was different. They were only detaining migrant kids who crossed the border unaccompanied. Here, Trump is forcibly SEPARATING kids who crossed the border with their parents. He is making a terrible situation worse.

@dbloom @NJOwen Would she have had incumbency going into June? Yes. But "Removing" her as Acting Mayor aggrieved her supporters, gained her a lot of new supporters who saw her as an outsider. No one remembers today that Ron Conway was literally campaigning for Breed at Ed Lee's Funeral. (4/4)

@xander76 I think it was far more valid to criticize RCV in 2011, when we had a million mayoral candidates but you could only cast 3 choices. This time, only 3-4 serious candidates made it far more manageable &amp; there was less risk of exhausted ballots
@cecilia_c_chung You mean November 2019 ;)
Good to know. Still very nervous about what remains to be counted. I am dreading every day at 4:00pm right now. I'm going to go drink at Martuni's now. https://t.co/JMjdENZ0mL
@cecilia_c_chung Who knows? I'm paranoid that if Jane keeps doing very well, she will kick Mark into 3rd place. His voters are less likely to pick Jane as #2, than her voters are to pick. Which is why I voted Mark #1 and Jane #2.
Here is how yesterday's numbers and today's numbers were so different. Looking at just the first-place votes:		YESTERDAY: Breed picked up 3274 votes, Leno 1841, and Kim 1713. 	TODAY: Breed picked up 7497 votes, Leno 4875 and Kim 5118.		Today's voters were much more progressive.
Mark Leno still ahead, but now it's only by 144 votes. Almost 20,000 ballots were counted today.
Some of the people who tell me they don't understand Ranked Choice Voting today are the same people who told me this 15 years ago. And I've been explaining it to them for the last 15 years. At a certain point, you have to wonder if there is willful ignorance going on.
Does that mean Mark Leno will still win? Not necessarily, but when the results are that close every single shift of more votes can make-or-break the outcome.		So this is gonna be torture every day, for a while. Who wants to go grab a drink?
Given how nail-bitingly close the #SFMayorsRace iis right now, we should expect every day's totals to show major change.		Today's batch significantly narrowed the gap for London Breed, but according to Jim Stearns 75% of the votes counted today came from more pro-Breed districts.
Fascinating. Jane Kim definitely delivered the vote to Mark Leno. Besides winning ultra-progressive precincts in the Mission, she won parts of the Sunset &amp; Chinatown that are Chinese-American. Leno won the Castro, which leans progressive but not uniformly. https://t.co/MfUS5DZeoT
@mcimaps Fascinating. Jane Kim definitely delivered the vote to Mark Leno. Besides winning ultra-progressive precincts in the Mission, she won parts of the Sunset &amp; Chinatown that are Chinese-American. Leno won the Castro, which leans progressive but not uniformly.
If we do that, we see Mark Leno actually "won" 6 of the city's 11 districts - and tied with Breed in District 4 (Sunset.) He also came very close (by 2 points) of edging Breed in District 11 (Excelsior.) That paints a much more accurate picture of what was a very close election.
This is not exact, and we will get better numbers‚Äìbut for now, I took this chart &amp; awarded all the Alioto votes in each district to London Breed - and all the Jane Kim votes to Mark Leno. (3/4)
She also claims to have "won" nine of the city's 11 districts, and Breed supporters are handing out this chart. Again, it only shows her winning a plurality in those districts - but certainly does not mean she "won" nine of the 11 districts. (2/4) https://t.co/7XE51mfFP5
London Breed claims she won a "majority" of first-place votes, which is not true. She won a PLURALITY of first-place votes. Under the old system, that would still require a run-off election. Under the new system, Ranked Choice Voting then determines the winner. (1/4)
@BaxterTwi @Taniel Yes, they do. That‚Äôs why those numbers are unofficial. It will change as more votes get counted.
@Taniel @davidshor @PatrickRuffini @PoliticsWolf @ForecasterEnten As much as exhausted ballots is a real problem, depressed turnout in a December runoff is much worse. I‚Äôd rather focus on getting people to vote once, and make sure they fill out their ballots completely.
Very few votes were counted today. Mark Leno is still up by 1,000 votes.		More numbers tomorrow at 4:00pm. A friend said it‚Äôs like calling in every day to see if you have jury duty.		Except everyday you find out if you have a new mayor yet instead of if you have to go to court.

More data here: https://t.co/exHI1dA6k5
Mark Leno can still win this. While London Breed kept her 9-point lead throughout the evening, the Ranked Choice Voting tabulation now shows Mark Leno edging her by one percentage point at the end. What changed? Now, up to 77% of Jane Kim voters picked Mark - earlier it was 71%
@ksings0201 LA County always comes in last. Didn't you see "Milk"?
@mattdpearce @Fahrenthold Barely. Some districts are too close to call, and a lot of strong-arming had to be done to get Democrats out of the race. I don't look forward to that every year.
@xander76 And altogether predictable. When you have "dueling ballot measures," the voters get confused and vote NO on both. I saw this coming a mile away.

In the last SF Mayor‚Äôs race in 2015, I cast a write-in vote for Mark Leno. Damn, it felt so  good to vote for him this time and for it to count (with Jane Kim as my #2.)
For the love of God, please vote. If you haven't already. I voted weeks ago, because I am registered permanent absentee - and that way, I get it over with. But if you didn't do that, please vote today. Really. Seriously. Go vote. (4/4)
So there you have it. A completely antiquated reason for people to vote today. It's infuriating we don't make this a holiday, and you won't BELIEVE how many people will simply forget that today is Election Day. Drives me insane. (3/4)
They didn't want to leave on a Sunday (because church), so they would leave on Monday and arrive in town on Tuesday. November was chosen because it was after the harvest. (2/4)
Why do we have elections on Tuesday? Because in the 19th Century, it would take farmers a day of traveling by horse-and-buggy to get to the main town and vote. (1/4)

@xander76 Sure, a campaign can't "coordinate" with independent expenditures - but a candidate can make a public pronouncement. Nothing is stopping them. US Senator @russfeingold did that in 1998.
For that matter, all candidates should do the same. Independent expenditures (with unlimited donations) have absolutely hijacked San Francisco elections. It's a reason why I never ran (and likely never will run) for Supervisor.
London Breed says she hates all the independent money being spent in the Mayor's race, and she can win this election on her own. Fine. Then tell Gayle Conway, etc. to stop. Tell them if they support your candidacy, just give money to your campaign directly (limited to $500 each).

Having occasionally tested the new motorized scooters, there are three things the City &amp; County of San Francisco must demand from these companies if they want to be legal. This ain't the Libertarian Wild West. It's San Francisco:

@tombellino So how do they prove it? Any ideas?
Trump spent at least a weekend in Moscow, which would mean at least one (if not two) nights at a hotel.		Why did Trump have to lie about not spending a night in Moscow? He could have said he was there for a few days, but the "golden shower" never happened.		Now I think it did.
That sounded fishy. Even if you're a mega billionaire who goes on lots of business trips around the world, it doesn't seem credible you would take a 9-hour flight to Moscow - and spend less than a day there.		Well, it has now been proven that was a lie‚Äîfrom Donald Trump's tweets.
Donald Trump denied the "golden shower" incident to Comey repeatedly. He said it couldn't be true, because he is a germaphobe. Okay, that's a credible argument.		But then he added that he never even stayed at a hotel in Moscow, that he didn't even spend the night there.
I dutifully wrote his response in my article, having no cause to believe it was untruthful. The next day, SF Board President Aaron Peskin emails me - to say he has not had a meeting with Newsom in six months.	Seriously, why did Gavin have to lie to me about that? No reason.
10+ years ago, I asked (then-Mayor) Gavin Newsom why he refused to attend a monthly Board of Supervisors meeting. He said "we don't need a show at the Board of Supervisors." And added that he meets with the Board President "once a week."
The true sign of a pathological liar is if they deny something with another lie - volunteering extra information that is not truthful, when they really didn't need to say anything. I learned this a long time ago with other politicians, and now I see it with Trump.
This should be required reading for everyone these days: https://t.co/gJ44Wc4r5E

(4) you absolutely can tell them to stop. You can speak out and say no outside group should spend on your behalf.	Marco Rubio- it‚Äôs not enough to tell you to stop accepting any more donations from NRA. You must also reject any independent spending the NRA does on your behalf ...
(3) against him - he OPENLY refused any soft money help on his behalf.		Politicians routinely claim that they can‚Äôt stop outside groups from spending on their behalf. I‚Äôve heard some claim to demand they stop is tantamount to ‚Äúillegal coordination.‚Äù Bullshit. Russ Feingold proved
(2) So then, what‚Äôs the solution? In 1998, Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) was in a tough re-election fight because Republicans were spending millions of soft money against him. As a crusader for campaign finance reform, Feingold not only denounced the outside money being spent

GREAT JOB, SEXY BEAST!! Scary hit, but @hunterpence slid into right field to get an out. Cubs still got a run, but we're up 3-2. #BeliEVEN
The Brandon's were not on the ball. Nine Inches @bbelt9 could've gotten that man out on 1st. Instead, he's now on 3rd. Ugh. #BeliEVEN
Giants up 3-1. Nine Inches @bbelt9 swung his long hard bat, but it got caught in center field. On to the 5th inning #BeliEVEN
Matt Moore really wants a sexy nickname, by any means necessary. He bats a single w bases loaded. #SFGiants up, 2-1 #BeliEVEN
Prince Charming &amp; Baby Buster are ROCKING it!! Gillaspie on 3rd, @JoePanik on 1st. Crowd going wild!! #BeliEVEN
Dreamy Eyes throws to Baby Buster to Nine Inches to get an out = Teamwork!! #BeliEVEN @bcraw35 @bbelt9 @JoePanik
Nice hit, Sexy Beast @hunterpence if a bit stronger, would've been a home run not an out. Someone must give Sexy Beast a massage #BeliEVEN

Good strikeout, Moore. You might earn a sexy nickname someday #BeliEVEN
Not good, Matt Moore. Not good. A Cubs player w a zero batting average hits a home run, game now tied. No sexy nickname for you! #BeliEVEN
Bottom of the 2nd, #SFGiants up 1-0. Sadly, Prince Charming &amp; Baby Buster didn't get home. But the night is young #BeliEVEN
Baby Buster @JoePanik continues to impress, just like that great hit into left field. Time for a sexier nickname? #BeliEVEN
Nickname for Conor Gillaspie: Prince Charming. He's got a seductive smile, and always saves the day. Like he did just now! #BeliEVEN

Boyfriend @BusterPosey gets a double, Duffy slides home and GAME TIED 8-8. We love my Boyfriend. We really really do.
BEAUTIFUL FUMBLE!! Heartthrob runs home, and next up is my Boyfriend @BusterPosey #SFGiants
Kelby broke his bat, and that was unbelievably hot #SFGiants
Nice double, Heartthrob!! Next up, our dirty cutie Oklahoma boy Kelby Tomlinson. #SFGiants
Well, we got a walk. #SFGiants now down, 8-6. Reminds me of my brief baseball career when I was 10 and got that walk that gave us an RBI.
Mad Bum gets a walk, bases loaded. Can we turn this around? #gogiants
DOUBLE PLAY!! Did Kelby get his groove back after I threatened not to give him a sexy nickname? Nice teamwork w Nine Inches @bbelt9, Kelby.
Has the Handsome Greek Prince been cursed? Despite @G_Kontos pitching, Reds score 2 runs. #SFGiants losing, 8-5. Did a witch poison him?
Will the Handsome Greek Prince rescue us? George Kontos @G_Kontos now pitching for #SFGiants. I believe in the Handsome Greek Prince!!
Hunter Strickland, pathetic! Walks a player w bases loaded, #SFGiants now losing 6-5. I've withheld sexy nicknames from him before:
Due to his poor infield performance this inning, I will withhold giving Kelby Tomlinson a sexy nickname. #SFGiants
Kelby Tomlinson, you are gorgeous. You are adorable. You are irresistible. But that does NOT excuse your repeated infield fumbles. Game tied
And ... Reds' last run got reversed. Thank Boyfriend @BusterPosey for tagging him at home plate. My Boyfriend is the best, right? #SFGiants

@sarcasticHalli awww thanks, I've been pursuing musical theater so haven't been able to go to a lot of games
Giants up, 5-3 at top of 6th inning and Juan Some Bootie hits a double #SFGiants #gogiants
Nine Inches @bbelt9 swings his bat really hard that helps the #SFGiants score. Nine Inches gets injured at 2nd base, but he's a team player!
@sarcasticHalli we all know my heart belongs to Buster. He's just not the jealous type &amp; lets me lust over his teammates
Smoldering Stud (Hunter Strickland) was a Lumbersexual before it was cool. He's pitching for the #SFGiants at top of the 6th with us up 4-3.
Jarrett Parker, a shy &amp; very handsome pitcher, just hit a terrific home run. #SFGiants up, 4-3. Next up, Heartthrob!!!
Terrific catch in left field by "Juan some bootie" Perez. I believe it's the new nickname Allan &amp; I just gave him that gave him these powers
Juan some bootie may have just gotten an out, but it allowed Nine Inches @bbelt9 to run to 3rd base. #SFGiants = teamwork. Go Giants!!
So @BusterPosey just proved to me, like he's done many times before, that I may lust at rookies like Kelby, but only Buster is my Boyfriend
My Boyfriend @BusterPosey just scored, hitting a home run that brought cuties Kelby &amp; Duffy home!! Game tied, 3-3, thanks to my Boyfriend!!!
I admit Kelby Tomlinson is my new crush. His adorable Clark Kent glasses, his uniform soiled w dirt. Plz don't get jealous, @BusterPosey
Chris Heston &amp; Nine Inches @bbelt9 are a good tag team getting Reds out on 1st base. I'm admiring Heston's long sexy legs. #needanickname
New nickname for Juan Perez: "Juan some bootie" because his ass is delicious. #SFGiants
Well, that's unfortunate Nine Inches @bbelt9 just struck out. "but you're still cute," sez Allan. #SFGiants
Helton pitched a lot better in this inning. I hope some lucky bastard gave him a nice blow job in the dugout. #SFGiants
Nice hit, Buster but double play sends us to the 2nd inning. My Boyfriend can't save the day every time. Gotta give the rookies sea legs.
Duffy hits single, and Kelby slides to second w dirt all over his pants. Will my Boyfriend @busterposey get these cuties home? #SFGiants
YES! Kelby Tomlinson, the cutest bespectacled player, just hit a single in what has so far been a sucky game. I believe in our sexy rookies!
Not even Heartthrob (Angel Pagan) could catch that pop fly, but he can carry me to some tropical paradise in my dreams. #SFGiants down 3-0.
Ugh, Reds already scored a run. Can we bring back Bumgarner? He has a terrific bum *and* can pitch. #SFGiants
Heston has a very firm ass that go well with his long legs, only wish his pitching was as good #SFGiants

Joaquin Arias pinch-hitting for Sergio. He is the all-purpose substitute player for everyone on #SFGiants. I call him "Substitute Stud."
8th inning stretch. When #SFGiants winning, they play "When the Lights Go Down in the City." When we're losing, it's "Don't Stop Believing."

Heartthrob (Angel Pagan) gets a smoldering catch in center field. Our outfielders have been a class act in this game, all the way. #SFGiants
Duff-Man just hit a home run!!! We're now down 5-4. With his adorable goat-tee, Matt Duffy deserves a sexier nickname. Any ideas? #SFGiants

@cruickshank the San Francisco Elections website was a MESS tonight. Kept crashing all night, almost impossible to get results @SFElections
RT @Taniel: The main reason 2010 was a much greater gut punch for Democrats: It doomed them for redistricting for an entire decade.
In 1994, only Republican on SF Board of Supervisors lost re-election. Tonight, BART Director James Fang (SF's last Republican) also lost.
With most SF precincts counted, Prop G is still down 54-46 after being down 60-40 earlier. PEOPLE, we need to target absentee voters!!

I would have tolerated losing Senate bc Pryor. But I'm beside myself we lost HARKIN's seat to a lunatic who wants 2nd Amendment remedies.

Early exit polls show @kayhagan narrowly ahead in North Carolina. We made a lot of calls to North Carolina. Let's hope this holds.
WTF? CNN is showing Scott Brown up 60-40, because this small town voted early. ALL OF FIVE people voted: three for Brown, two for Shaheen.
