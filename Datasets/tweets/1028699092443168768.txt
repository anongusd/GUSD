@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Trump's daughters look like Stormy Daniels.
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Wonder if "horseface" is acceptable to Trump's white women, it is outright disgusting and ugly.
@esglaude All Floridians need to read this.
@FoxNews We punish leakers, including wikileaks.
@thehill Congratulations.
@MSNBC @chucktodd Nickname for white women is "horseface". That hurts deeply.
@CNN Choose the right stocks, buy low sell high (repeatedly). Retire in your 40's. Good luck!
@themotleyfool May benefit from the stocks if holding it 10-20 years.
@SenatorCollins Let them do their own investigation with the help of the EU if needed. No need to send FBI because they side too much for Trump now.

@Comey He cannot undo it but we are here partly because of James Comey

@tedlieu Mr. Ted Liew, make this your daily talking point to remind us until November 6th.
@thehill UN should impose oil embargo toward Saudi NOW.
@JoyceWhiteVance Don't know how Trump's supporters could afford Trumpcare.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness Sorry, I watch Chris Hayes at that time.
@thehill You can afford security guards
@thehill If you are not ready to embrace other races don't do DNA tests.
@McFaul Mr. Ambassador should be given a security personnel to protect him.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN King of debt.
@RonaldKlain @lskurrus Democrats should hire intelligent strategists

@thehill You should be blessed enough to hire bodyguards
@maggieNYT @nytimes @StormyDaniels How sure is he melania would not tell all soon after divorce?
@FoxNews Honorary Degree is like an engagement ring. The lady breaks the engagement, she returns the ring.
@thehill Warren is right to be proud of that speck of the native DNA in her though the natives put limit to be accepted as their own.
@thehill It's not Hillary the rural people disliked, it's the fact she doesn't stand for white only like Trump did.
@thehill He has a big campaign against cruz
@CNNPolitics Trump has $100,000,000.00 for 2020, borrow those.
@AriMelber Ari, You are the best. Sometimes it seems you are presiding over a case.
@thehill Still remember how classy O' Rouke is by defending Cruz after protesters harassing them in D.C.
@MaddowBlog Disgraceful for Trump to tell Eric to cover infidelity to a wh*re
@MaddowBlog Trump owes his son Eric a big apology for bringing him into this mess.
@NBCNews This reminds me of Comey coming out to tell about Clinton's email so close to election?
@HowardA_Esq Orange jumpsuit.
@FoxNews It would be noteworthy if the bigger one is dimissed instead of this defamation lawsuit.

@JackPosobiec The native leaders did not push back on Trump when he insulted her of being part native. Don't wait until he does it to the whole tribes.
@NBCNews Trump looking down on people it the most disgusting but his Christian supporters enjoying it makes it even more sickening.
@thehill Yes. Send him the bill for $1,000,000.00 NOW
@NBCNews Overthrow by voting in november, not coup d'etat.

@jaketapper Aren't they taping each other?
@maggieNYT @chrismac2562 Kushner will face the music soon and a hell lot to pay for playing with fire.

@thehill Yes, could be because historically many young voters don't vote and the oldies among us take the time to go.
@MichaelCohen212 Yes, ready, with pantsuit.
@FoxNews This is just noise because Trump has too much personal financial interest at stake there.
Who could place a moral compass in a swamp?
It is hard to see a moral compass in a swamp that is too big. https://t.co/DqhjZ1bN1B

@McFaul Yes. We have poured so much soft  money to Israel over the years.
@McFaul Like the OPEC?
@FoxNews She meant no harm.
@thehill She's a liar too. She told her office long ago those words didn't meant a thing and now...

@tedlieu Don't think Christian schools believe climate change happens.
@themotleyfool Buy low sell high.
@thehill Our hearts go out to the sexual assault victims, may it happened to men or women.
@CNNPolitics If she's not concerned, Melanie is a sole enabler to Trump's womenizing
@MSNBC @VelshiRuhle The Saudis hate the wise Obama.
@11thHour @VelshiRuhle The best duo on TV
@tribelaw Sad Flake fooled Democrats and Senator Chris Coons on Kavanaugh.

@MSNBC @HardballChris Humility never goes out of style.
@CNN Excite cruelty

@thehill Lock him up?
@gpatrickhubbard You are the company you keep
@seanhannity Welcome home.
@NBCNews Miller could have turn around and make a humor out of it by saying he was looking for attention.
@FoxNews @RepMarkMeadows Meadow is scared Trump will soon face the music.
@tribelaw Where is the sanctity of life?
@themotleyfool Maybe when impaired I'll see 'win' in these stocks.
@JackPosobiec Sickening
@AP_Politics @AP @asfram How about we say the GOP is using the 'Godfather' rule?
@NBCNews Wished we could have saved the muslim journalist as well.
@itsJeffTiedrich Sad thing the evangelicals worship Trump and stand to all he chooses.
@tribelaw No need to be fooled any more, they already ploughed through it.
@thehill That was a direct collusion Trump.
@thehill What is more important? üí∞
@FoxNews Representative Joe Wilson shouted calling Obama a liar, no GOP pushed back on it.
@tribelaw Jared may have some blood on his hands.
@tedlieu Hidden genius Jared thinks he can do unlawful things in deep secretly.
@FoxNews How if Trump knows about the plan and did nothing he may have blood on his hand to this case.
@thehill May be they see Kavanaugh as Trump's puppet.
@tedlieu @Ilovemyamerica2 @realDonaldTrump Bannon should be interviewed by Mueller too.
@seanhannity Could have Russians and Israelis in the book.
@FoxNews @RepMarkMeadows Lock them up!!!
@thehill Stable genius, hidden genius, and the genius with Einstein Visa make it seems anyone could be genius.
@thehill Can't wait to see Ted Cruz and Devin Nunes campaigning
@thehill Let Mueller does the pyramid work and he seems nearing the peak now.
@AC360 @andersoncooper Loss of sensitivity towards suffering neighbors seems thing of the past.
@thehill TheBible never mentioned skin colors
@MaddowBlog The Nazi never thought they would be held accountable but people are not stupid to forget painful tortures.
@thehill I put my hand on TV during inauguration to pray for Trump but Hillary deserves recognitions beyond parties.
@DeadlineWH @MichaelSteele @NicolleDWallace For someone who never experienced daddy's love, Trump is better than nothing.
@thehill If this is Democrat President Republicans would be up in arms demanding answers about the death of this journalist.
@CNN Give him the highest medal of the GOP.
@thehill So sweet, Trump looks the father figure he never had.
@maddow The must be no one doing anything better than her.
@FoxNews Good for them and better for the communities.
@CNN Gasoline up, stock market down, and prices of goods up due to tariffs imposed.
@thehill Due to incompetence he does it this late wasting 2 years loss of manpower.
@krassenstein This sounds like mail-order case.
@_SJPeace_ @RNApeant When I see multi-racial community doing things together I feel like jumping in to join them.
@thehill He has to go campaign and expose secrets.
@MaddowBlog Shameful greedy sh*ttychristians hypocrites get away with crimes.
@thehill Federal deficit is skyrocket to 1 trillion a year.
@thehill All that she wore in public went out of stock within hours though she's	 not a supermodel.
@thehill Men to men approach.
@lisastark351 It is a song for weak men.
@ellievan65 He would never make a law disadvantages to his business
@thehill Sweet
@jaketapper That the men's approach towards men.
@thehill Give Kanye West some credits for being invited but when is he going to sing?
@NBCNews They really seem to click.
Listening to Kanye West now is like listening to Kavanaugh 2 weeks ago.
@FoxNews @POTUS It is an insult for us who live in emergency states to know Trump rather be out selling his MAGA hat that monitoring the hurricane with us.
@AprilDRyan Doesn't he know none of Trump supporters buy his CD?
@MSNBC @SteveKornacki I believe only polls of those who have exited the polling booth.
With Einstein Visa entering this country she should discuss intellectual ideas at universities. https://t.co/5yY0OHLnPV
@thehill We in Southeast States have emergency so it's insensitive and ugly to do a party like rally.
Who knew. https://t.co/ZeBtroGFqp
@FoxNews @POTUS @foxandfriends He raised federal deficits to 1 trillion a year already.
@thehill The problem is they take the poll but they don't vote.
@MichaelAvenatti Don Jr and Kushner are under the peak of the pyramid?
@thehill Never knew that medal comes so easy.
@thehill Both are good in singing: one makes big money, one makes the biggest money in that business.
@thehill Metoo?
@MichaelAvenatti Also the big nothing üçî
@FoxNews @POTUS @foxandfriends May be harsh but in 2009 an armed men came to Obama rally
@NBCNews Hillary is not a saint but she deserves Nobel prize for her examply courages.
@NBCNews Pyramid theory: the target is the last.
@CNN Feel bad for her, as saying goes: the closest gets the hardest kick.
@thehill Never under estimate the will of an underdogs.
@Acosta He is a recycled garbage
@charliekirk11 First day Obama in office the Republicans promised to do anything to make him a one term president.
@thehill Accept Kavanaugh now but monitor his judgements closely.
@MaddowBlog Should lock him up one day for every registration.
@thehill Democrats have been bullied bigly so never under estimate the power of the underdogs this November.
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Do whatever you know is right even if it means to empty your pockets.
@peterdaou Yes. To evade the people's attention from Mueller's investigation.
@maddow Can't tell the difference between Republicans to Nebuchadnezzar right now.
@NBCNews @NBCBLK Heartwrenching and teary eyed when I watched Lester Holt touched his grandmother's tombstone.
@LewyBorne @johnsonediem @FoxNews Useless to pray about lowering the Federal Deficits.
@NBCNews The more ‚õ≥ golf the more weight.
@FoxNews Love never goes out of style.
Someone came out of the bar impaired. https://t.co/tez0RZbWMc
@thehill May have to rethink if bars could have parking lots
@thehill Lock him up
@NBCNews We have sold too many weapons and knowhow to other countries that it could backfire is bigly.
@thehill Hope so. Most women pay bills too
@thehill We can leave Kavanaugh alone now but never forget how he got there.
@JoyceWhiteVance What goes around comes around, yet to see.
@tvkatesnow @NBCNews Sweetheart, safety first, please. We pray for you guys.
@FoxNews @ShepNewsTeam We pray for our hard working volunteers.
No way, Jose. https://t.co/5HAozardoB
@thehill If Marco Rubio had voted "no" to Kavanaugh it would be possible for him to beat Trump and becomes Presidential candidate.
Everything is political https://t.co/qC54enSS4O
@thehill Face the üé∂
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Democrats hate dictators and autotarian like Putin, the Saudi prince, Kim, Duerte ,Maduro but Republicans make psychological projection.
@maddow The stable genius and hidden genius could tell the FBI to let the public geniuses to read the report.
@thehill We need Einstein quality approaches and ideas who own an Einstein Visa.
@thehill Marco Rubio often missed voting on many issues but he was among the first pro- Kavanaugh.
@FoxNews @GOPChairwoman @foxnewsnight Then Senate minority leader McConnell publicly declared making President Obama a one term President no matter what. He is still that impaired in judgement.
@thehill Her fear and courage will be remembered long after we all become ghosts
@thehill Looks like we are feeding the world with weapons to use against us.
@thehill Kavanaugh didn't come from Senate, it was from the Federalist's list.
@thehill Show us the FBI report so we can find some goodness in it to share.
@Acosta Trump should show his tax returns to prove he is rich.
For Republicans she is their grinding mortar but for the Democrats she's the rock of ages. https://t.co/klEyONzLpp
@thehill He better decline it because many Trump supporters will feel sorry for him.
@krassenstein In a wider scope Kavanaugh's confirmation is a blessing in disguise.
@owillis The TVs give too much free coverage for Trump's rallys.
@FoxNews @FEMA_Brock Check those generators to make sure they are still working.
@OMGBabyAnimals @Insanse_Thought The little animals are as precious as the biggest one.
@FoxNews Just don't call for illegle helps from Israelis and Russians.
@FoxNews @MittRomney He may have the spine to stand up against bullying.
@therealchadp @taylorswift13 Taylor Swift may be more popular than Trump.
@McFaul @nikkihaley For something hidden yet to be known.
@CNN She deserves the highest award in the world for having the courage to come forward.
@DavidCornDC Thanks for reminding us who have short memories.
@EdKrassen @Resistance65 Have the heads of our leaders examined
@thehill Cruz is hoping Trump will give him the win by campaigning for him.
@thehill Hillary may not be a saint but she has the longest last laugh looking at Trump's people being locked up.
@thehill Would be nice to put Lindsey Graham for that job.
@Bornabrit1 Older people don't make much noise but they do vote while the younger generation are noise everywhere but don't vote.
@thehill Far fetched word
@Acosta Yes. That's what all who had voted Trump knew he was going to do. Not surprise the next thing we see is junior replacing Rosenstein.
@Acosta Stable genius, hidden genius, the genius with Einstein Visa and the next genius in the family is...?
@thehill Funny Trump still has so much passion for Hillary after these years.
@CNN Time for a woman to be President so hope she will run.
@CNN @camanpour Republicans are the hare and the Democrats are the tortoise at a race now.
@FoxNews @POTUS She cannot stand the ever growing filth swamp.
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe Maybe Ted Cruz didn't even care Trump used Israeli's cyber company doing fake accounts against his campaign
@FoxNews @POTUS Trump's seems to have problems with successful women
@FoxNews Some like hurricanes, small ones. Off days.
@MSNBC We are ready for Michael.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Bad facelift.
@thehill Who knows it's a photo op that may have negative effects.
@CNN Now we know the Israelis too helped Trump during the 2016 election.
@CNN Those republicans didn't think of their young when voting Kavanaugh
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Did we all hear the an Israeli co. too helped Trump by making thousands of fake accounts to help Trump?
@ItsMeCathi Sweetheart, we pray for you and your mom.
@FoxNews @AmbassadorRice @SenatorCollins There are still 2 more years to prepare.
@thehill Congratulations. And not just hire female clerks, please include minorities and LGBT group.
With Einstein visas we expect higher kind of talk and work, discussing ideas with professors to improve lives, not eyeball assumptions.
@FoxNews @benshapiro Since the hare thinks so highly of himself he looks down on the poor broken tortoise but the road ahead is long, slippery, rough and winding.
@CNN Someone with Einstein Visa could give speeches at colleges and universities also.
@thehill Foot spur? Which side?
@thehill Isn't receiving donations for her campaign from big donors also means " buying votes"?
@McFaul @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin Yes, you are right. I am with you. Please check my tweets.
@thehill No need for Graham to insult Dr. Ford. The road is long and winding.
@thehill @FLOTUS Might help your image if you go to give speeches at universities to prove your Einstein Visa.
@thehill His Holiness has gone low, way offline in his judgement about this.
@NBCNews What had happened to this man of the highest integrity?
@FCBarcelona Win!!!
@thehill Many don't agree to the "yes" vote but don't ever threaten someone physical about it.
@FCBarcelona Glad Vidal starts today.
@thehill Trump is the moral compass of the Republicans.
@thehill It was pre-arranged so Republicans could still confirm Kavanaugh, still flowers for blessing in disguise?
@krassenstein We need younger Senators who could represent the younger generations
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Alan Dershowitz wants a job in the swamp.
@FoxNews @AlanDersh Alan Dershowitz is ambitious for a job in Trump's swamp.
@glenn87027633 One voted for Trump for the fun of it because she thought he was going to lose anyway.
@FoxNews Pray he won't have alcohol related disease too soon.
@FoxNews @SenatorCollins Now GOP have put 2 sexual offenders in Supreme court, and the sexual offender in chief.
@FoxNews Do surprise alcohol tests on judges in case they preside cases impaired.
@thehill Russians helped Trump get elected and his signs are made in China.
@thehill When a game is won by cheating there's a curse following it.
@RadioFreeTom The FBI report is too damaging for Trump, GOP and FBI that they feel ashamed to let the public read it.
@thehill @FLOTUS Michelle Obama who is not a model could empty the shelves of clothes in the store in one day.
@FoxNews @POTUS How about to Putin?
@FoxNews @VP Support an independent to run against Manchin who sides Trump in his votes. Fool once shame on me, fool twice shame on you.
@thehill Looks she is an attention seeker and may have to pay a price for that.
@iquesi @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Glad we got this law but go further by demanding alcohol tests before each judge presides a case.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Next time Kavanaugh presides over your case demand an alcohol test in case he is impaired.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Space force to work with Russians so they steal our intelligence.
@thehill @FLOTUS I don't care, do you?
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @SenatorCollins Alcoholics like Kavanaugh in the Good Book were called 'demon possessed'
@krassenstein Also, alcohol addicts those days were called 'demon possessed'.
It is time to demand drug and alcohol tests before a judge presides over a case. Kavanaugh's alcohol addiction prompt us to protect ourselves from impaired judgement. Call it the 10/6 Law.
@tedlieu Do alcohol and drug tests each time a judge presides over a case in case he is impaired.
@FoxNews The most fitting person to use the term "Lawyers are liars" is Kavanaugh.
@FoxNews If he had drunk too much in his life, should check his blood tests results.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Illegitimate Kavanaugh helped by Trump, GOP and FBI , and Illegitimate Trump by the Russians.
@DavidJollyFL Revoke Kavanaugh's license to practice law.
@AP With the cruel twist of fate, the GOP's happiness WILL be short-lived.

@thehill I had to mute my TV during The middle of the hearing to see only his expression. To say the least, I was frightened.
@CNN No. He is just doing his job for his client.
@thehill Would be nice she puts her vote to make it official so Pence can come to break the tie.
