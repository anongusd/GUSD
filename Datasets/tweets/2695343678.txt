You need to believe you can succeed before you are able to succeed.
Only compete with yourself. Be the very best that you can be. Forget the rest. Do your own thing. And keep getting better at it.
When you look at successful people, you probably only see their last success. What you don’t see is number of failures they had. Only reason they made it to great success is because they refused to quit, no matter how many obstacles and hardships they faced. Never quit.
@KTNKenya Wishing you quick recovery.

@MusaliaMudavadi As kenyans we need answers not questions.
Have a notebook and a pen or pencil on you at all times. Write your thoughts, ideas and observations as they occur to you. Jot everything down that maybe of use to your future self. Review your notes once a week.
When people describe those who inspire them, they talk about conversations that count. They remember the right words by the right person at the right time. Those who inspired them might not even realize what they have done. 		Are you making a difference in someone’s life?
@DavyTheTeacher Karibu.(welcome) 😀😀😀😀😀
At least once a week, step back and look at what you are doing, how you are doing it, why you are doing it. Sometimes we dive so deep looking for solutions, we forget to check if we are solving the right problems.
