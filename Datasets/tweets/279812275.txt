8. Prohibit requirements to weaken encryption. 	A commitment that the parties will not require, as a condition of market access, vendors or suppliers of encrypted products to weaken the cryptography in any way. Narrow the exceptions in USMCA Art. 12.C.2.
7. Prohibit data localization requirements. 	A commitment that the parties will not require local storage of data or use of computing facilities in the parties' territory, or restrict cross-border flow of business data, as a market access condition. See USMCA Arts. 19.11-19.12.
6. Encourage transparency of consumer IoT security. 	A commitment to facilitate voluntary, consensus-based processes to enhance transparency of key security features of consumer IoT devices. Goal is to enable consumers to make informed purchasing decisions based on security.
5. Identify regulatory restrictions to defensive cybersecurity activity. 	A commitment to review regulations &amp; policies that inappropriately restrict legitimate defensive cybersecurity activity. No requirement that regs be revised, just identify potential areas of improvement.
4. Strengthen existing cybersecurity collaboration mechanisms. 	A commitment to strengthen existing collaboration mechanisms for identifying &amp; mitigating malicious attacks, addressing cyber incidents, &amp; sharing cyber threat intel &amp; best practices. See USMCA Art. 19.15(1)(b).
3. Build capabilities of national cybersecurity entities. 	Commitment to build capabilities of national entities responsible for incident response &amp; CVD. Includes entities that facilitate CVD btw private orgs, as well as disclosure of nonpublic vulns from gov't to private orgs.
2. Encourage interoperable cyber risk management frameworks. 	A commitment to developing and promoting adoption of cybersecurity risk management approaches that are voluntary, consensus- and standards-based, &amp; interoperable across jurisdictions. The NIST Framework is an example.
1. Include cybersecurity in a digital trade chapter. 	The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) had the first dedicated cybersecurity article (Art. 19). We recommend doing the same for US-EU, reflecting the importance of cybersecurity to maintaining trust in the digital economy.

@ErrataRob So take it baaaaack.
@ErrataRob 3) You argue that government should address IoT security measures besides patching. As discussed, it is. But those efforts do not go into depth on communicating with users about updates. This document (written by private sector) does, so government need not reproduce the work.
@treyford @ErrataRob It is too late for me. Save yourself.
@ErrataRob 2) Your post argues that government should do nothing about IoT security. This document was written &amp; approved by private sector participants. NTIA mostly just organized meetings and hosted documents on the website. Non-government leadership is actually a key part of the process.
@ErrataRob 1) You argue that users failing to update is a security issue, and picking on vendors is old &amp; busted. This document ultimately envisions giving users more info about updates so that users can make better choices about updating. Document includes lots of flexibility for vendors.
@ErrataRob I shall further posit that your blog post comes to a conclusion that contradicts your actual arguments. You should instead openly and sincerely SUPPORT this document. REPENT, Rob. Three reasons why:
@ErrataRob I was gonna run tonight. But now I'm on Twitter instead.
@ErrataRob I mean, c'mon Rob. https://t.co/cjLlGNoJTC I betcha I could find three more in under five minutes.
@ErrataRob Dude. There are many other gov't &amp; industry IoT security efforts that are more comprehensive: https://t.co/5xLG9TOXLS The NTIA process happened to focus only on updates, and the document focused only on communicating to end users about updates. Narrow scope isn't inherently bad.
@ErrataRob Sorry, this just doesn't hold water. Nowhere does the document say other security measures are not key, and instead actually encourages consideration of other measures. The document makes clear it is intended to address one issue, not cover every aspect of IoT security.
@ErrataRob Untrue. The documents explicitly describe patching as one only aspect of IoT security. "It is also important to note that updates and patches do not offer complete device protection and are not the sole security measures IoT manufacturers or consumers should take." Pg 1, para 3.
@ErrataRob This is not a government proposal, it came from the private sector. The document also does not require vendors to do anything. It recommends vendors provide consumers with more information about device capability so consumers can make better choices.

Rapid7 supports a unified data security standard for personal info that is clear &amp; flexible enough for a variety of users &amp; businesses to implement. But if current security laws are preempted, a federal replacement shouldn't substantially weaken protections from the status quo.
The fragmented landscape of state data security &amp; breach notification laws does not serve consumers or businesses well. Consumers in different states are subject to uneven protections, and the complexity of the laws makes it more difficult for businesses of all sizes to comply.

Update: #GASB315 cleared the Committee vote yesterday. The "active defense" provision remains (amended), as does the TOS exception. The bill has already passed the GA Senate &amp; is now closer to a GA House vote &amp; full passage. Here's the latest version: https://t.co/WAiHMT93ej
@OrinKerr During the hearings, it was stated that "active defense" is to be interpreted broadly. Committee members argued that independent security research may be considered "active defense" - a bad precedent. Lack of clarity regarding the scope of this loaded term is the biggest issue.
@OrinKerr Right, federal law doesn't permit hack back - and is unlikely to anytime soon. But disagree this means it's not "relevant" that a state won't use resources to prevent/punish hack back, &amp; indeed officially endorses it. Also remains to be seen how gov't interprets this provision.

When I worked on Aaron's Law in 2013, almost no policymakers knew what security research was, &amp; few researchers were actively making their case before legislators. Five years on, one researcher after another lobbies for protection in GA state legislation. https://t.co/qoC6oJfErG
@EricWenger @CristinGoodwin @rapid7 Strangely, the argument was made during the most recent hearing that independent security research / reporting qualified as an "active defense" measure.
@EricWenger @CristinGoodwin @rapid7 Concern that the law would subject legit researchers to prosecution in GA was discussed heavily in Committee hearings &amp; letters. Our feedback focused on 1) Removing the "active defense" &amp; "offensive countermeasures" exception, 2) Excepting mere TOS violations from the new crime.
I should also be clear that we sent our concerns in writing to the Committee members a day before tweeting about it.
@frankrietta @rapid7 Has ‚Äúactive defense‚Äù been removed as an exception to computer trespass, or only ‚Äúoffensive countermeasures?‚Äù A previous iteration of the bill had both. The last copy I saw still had the former.

.@Hacker0x01 &amp; other witnesses  tout @TheJusticeDept‚Äôs vuln disclosure guidelines as something everyone should adopt. This is a mistake. The guidelines are actually for AUTHORIZED research, and are restrictive, not a general process for receipt of vuln disclosures.
@nicoleperlroth Agreed - not drawing a sharp distinction between coordinated disclosure / bug bounties and extortion. The latter is a deviation from the former and is already illegal. New regulation is not needed to prevent it.
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran @ConsumersUnion This @SenateCommerce hearing is not drawing a sharp distinction between coordinated disclosure / bug bounties and extortion. The latter is a deviation from the former and is already illegal. That‚Äôs important - new regulation is not needed to prevent it. @SenCortezMasto
Good God @elonmusk is so inspiring.
.@SenCortezMasto asks whether federal regulation to distinguish between good and bad hackers is needed. (But seems to dislike idea of shielding illegal intrusions undertaken for research purposes.) @k8em0: Yes. @JustinBrookman: Yes, but don‚Äôt micromanage bug bounties.
.@Uber is being quite contrite and forthcoming at this @SenateCommerce hearing. ‚ÄúCompanies that run bug bounties should have a process in place for when incidents like this occur.‚Äù
@SenateCommerce It‚Äôs okay @JerryMoran, I mispronounced @k8em0‚Äôs name for a long time too.  Thankfully not on C-Span.
@SenateCommerce So this will all add further momentum to data security / breach legislation. But we‚Äôve been here before. Is this time different? And will  any moving vehicle actually be better for cybersecurity than the status quo, or will it be watered down to reduce liability exposure?
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran @JustinBrookman notes @ConsumersUnion favorably views companies that have vulns disclosure programs and commit not to prosecute good faith hackers. And - surprise! - calls for data security legislation. But with limited state preemption.
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran @k8em0 argues that the market is incentivizing bug hunters but not bug fixers. Workforce training is sorely needed and enough with the ‚Äúhack the x‚Äù bug bounty legislation already.
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran @Uber emphasizes the 2016 intrusion did not proceed like a typical bug bounty. @Hacker0x01 calls for CFAA reform to protect researchers, and general data security legislation.
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran Senators Blumenthal and Nelson say, after a string of high profile breaches, we must pass broad data security legislation. ‚ÄúIt must not just cater to corporate interests.‚Äù -Nelson.
@SenateCommerce @Uber @k8em0 @Hacker0x01 @JustinBrookman @JerryMoran starts off promisingly. Says potential extortion attempts should not eclipse the overall usefulness of bug bounties.

@tedcruz More informed observer: The FCC issued its first net neutrality rules in 2010. They were struck down in court due to a technicality. ISPs knew FCC was building a record for the net neutrality rules that were issued in 2015, so too much traffic management was risky. -

@corvomancer @kitten__cannon @crushingbort Which is a very different thing than willfully ignoring what is happening around you.

@WhiteHouse Recommended reading - Article by @KateCharlet &amp; @SashaRomanosky on @lawfareblog regarding the need for other nations to develop &amp; coordinate on their own vulnerabilities disclosure processes. This issue isn't confined to the US, after all. https://t.co/x5LOlDsi9M #VEP
@WhiteHouse 6/ We'll have to see how the ambiguities play out as the #VEP is implemented over time. We expect the VEP to grow in importance as exploitation of vulns becomes more routine in law enforcement, intelligence, &amp; military activities. This is a good step, but not the final one.
@WhiteHouse 5/ As expected, the #VEP charter has ambiguities. Example: Secretariat WILL produce annual reports for NSC staff, but MAY provide reports to Congress. Director chooses whether/how to report quantities of held vulns, but quantities help indicate whether stockpiling is occurring.
@WhiteHouse 4/ Key details in #VEP charter include: a) Stockpiling vulns is not USG policy. b) Many factors on whether to disclose vulns focus on interests of civilians &amp; private sector. c) Decisions against disclosure are reviewed annually, &amp; immediately in cases of malicious exploitation.
@WhiteHouse 3/ The Administration deserves credit for this act of transparency. Until now, little was publicly known about the #VEP, &amp; official sources only spoke of the VEP in generalities. By comparison, the new charter is quite thorough &amp; provides answers to several important questions.
@WhiteHouse 2/ We think #VEP is important bc private actors must know about their vulns to secure their systems. We recognize govt has legit reasons to identify/exploit vulns, but exercise of that power must be balanced w (among other things) risks of failure of systems on which we all rely.
Quick take on the @WhiteHouse's release of details on the #VEP - the government's process for disclosing #cybersecurity vulnerabilities to private actors. WH statement with links to VEP charter &amp; fact sheet available here: https://t.co/sWfEvM4yLy 1/
@normative This is a great idea.
@evgenymorozov There are enough problems to go around.
@evgenymorozov I trust the center has already expressed abhorrence to fascists, doesn‚Äôt feel compelled to remonstrate on social media more than periodically to prove its rejection, &amp; sees a  need for exposure  on the not-as-obviously-horrible phenomenon of automated political propaganda.
@ErrataRob @pierre Is this what @pierre is arguing? I already believed @Wikileaks was absolutely partial in its publishing, but actively penetrating computers - or at least secretly trafficking in passwords - strikes me as a significant non-press escalation.
@pierre @ErrataRob "We have guessed the password." Wikileaks appears to have (secretly) provided the password of a political opponent to a political campaign, seemingly after validating that the password was correct. Surely this too qualifies as non-press activity.
RT @OrinKerr: @segalmr Using the password is an obvious CFAA violation.
@OrinKerr And wouldn't Wikileaks correctly guessing the password, presumably by entering it, indicate a violation of (a)(2)?
"the perception of our impartiality."
"We have guessed the password." https://t.co/fnWScwgDH6 The password is 18_USC_1030(a)(2)(C).
@juliaioffe ‚ÄúWe have guessed the password.‚Äù Does this mean @Wikileaks broke into @RobGlaser‚Äôs computer by using his login credentials w/o authorization? That would seem to be a computer crime that goes way beyond publishing leaked documents in the name of ‚Äútransparency‚Äù ...

@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi But hey, it‚Äôs art. Everyone has different interpretations. The fact these topics are provoked at all is a good thing.
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi Not saying the character could not be improved, but I think Joi raises some of the most intriguing agency issues in the film.
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi Her intimate moment experiencing happiness in the rain is interrupted as she becomes a voicemail notification.
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi Did she ‚Äúlove‚Äù him? Was her aspiration for realness just an extension of his needs? He told her ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that,‚Äù but did she?
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi To me, the naked hologram Joi is a very haunting scene. A degraded copy selling to him: ‚ÄúYou look lonely. Everything you want to see/hear.‚Äù
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi I fear it will be lost, dismissed because of the pretty pixie vibe, but that‚Äôs how a mass produced software companion could well be built.
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi See my take is Joi, more than anyone except K (who is also used throughout), offered the most meaningful comment on agency &amp; uniqueness.
@ErrataRob Let us also not forget Stark‚Äôs role in hiring villains &amp; imprisoning heroes en masse as part of gov program in Civil War (comic version).
@CristinGoodwin @ErrataRob The Titans! And as Nightwing.
It's been a deeply nerdy evening on the twitters.
@ErrataRob Stark Industries &amp; Wayne Enterprises are both military contractors, but I believe Wayne holdings are much more diversified.
@ErrataRob Stark created Ultron, put entire world at risk. His solution: build another Ultron to battle the first one.
@KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi Fair enough, this is true. Although I thought K spent much of the time obeying masters as well. This case complicated bc they're replicants.
@ErrataRob @KevinBankston @TechPoliSciFi Don't know if it counts, but Joshi &amp; Luv talking about replicant procreation during the scene in which Joshi dies.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston Wouldn't go out of my way to defend the movie if I didnt really enjoy it. Also not commenting to author's TL bc repulsive trolling going on.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston That said, I agree the racial diversity is indeed lacking. Not nonexistent, but lacking. Though several characters were white of necessity.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston These characters don't feel flat to me. And the themes of disposability aren't "almost comments." Any more on-the-nose and they'd be cheesy.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston Ex: Joshi as only human (cept Wallace) who sees/fears meta implications of replicant procreation. Stern, gruff kindness, awkward sexuality.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston Ex: Luv's aspirations for replicants, explained through rage tears at Joshi. Sadness at new model's failure. Deadly cold towards humans &amp; K.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston Ex: Freysa's passionate exposition on soul, role as revolutionary, willingness to sacrifice Deckard, sharply limited empathy for K.
@TechPoliSciFi @KevinBankston Interesting, bc I thought Luv, Freysa, &amp; Joshi each showcased independent motivations, emotional depth, &amp; leadership. &amp; Each manipulated K.
@Robyn_Greene @bladerunner Have now read one of these criticisms. Me &amp; my wife disagree w it, think it overlooks a ton to make its point. But that's just our opinion.

@joejerome - conditions, emotional states, racial demographics, protestor identities, etc... this I find worrying as face recognition is decentralized.
@joejerome The study about using face recognition to determine sexual orientation is being derided, but the use of the tech to identify health -
@joejerome For me, the trends to widespread adoption and increasing sophistication are (as usual) the bigger issues for privacy.
@joejerome Decentralizing face recognition capability to consumer devices was always in the cards. Face ID is a relatively innocuous application.

@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Yes, although I suspect that LE agencies can currently use kinetic weapons against drones under that standard already.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX @msolnik Agree to disagree, but I see where you're coming from. Also char limit prevented "legally empowering."
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX First paragraph (a). Exempts all agencies from CFAA / ECPA (currently they are not exempt). Most of the rest is the hacking authorization.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Sorry for the lack of clarity then. But yes, that's what this legislation is getting at.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX I would guess that's connected to an intelligence agency authorized by its domestic law to conduct the operation.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Sorry I don't believe in nihilism. But I do believe most govt agencies don't hack drones bc the law prevents it. This bill would change that
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX I am not new to the world of security research, thanks. But most researchers are not govt agencies, nor is such research protected by law.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX @msolnik No, you're just repeating that tech exists. That's not the point. What we're talking about is providing broad legal authority to use it.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Joe &amp; Jake know where I've been. And you are avoiding my question by answering with a totally different scenario.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Yes, the law does chill hacking, both of the beneficial and nefarious types.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX I'm not asking if the tech exists. I know it does. I'm asking if non-LE agencies actually used it, &amp; whether they should be empowered to.
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez @airimgsol @D13ASX Do you have examples of non-LE agencies using stingrays for this purpose? Would you be comfortable w all agencies being empowered to do so?
@d0tslash @JoeBeOne @JakeLaperruque @itsDanielSuarez Though this is likely to change as the market &amp; tech mature. Esp bc of the safety angle. But a broad gov hacking authorization will persist.
@d0tslash @JakeLaperruque @JoeBeOne @itsDanielSuarez ...and the law. The law does not permit, for example, GSA, NOAA, HHS, etc., to preemptively &amp; remotely hack your devices wo consent.

@d0tslash @JakeLaperruque @JoeBeOne @itsDanielSuarez That's absolutely a worry. But right now government offensive hacking is confined to a very few agencies. This opens it up to all.
@marasawr At minimum, endorsement of the draft content transitioned with the administration. If it were already introduced, that would be different.
@JakeLaperruque @JoeBeOne @d0tslash @itsDanielSuarez I wonder if this would lead to an intentional security "backdoor" into #drones, whether mandated by law or voluntarily installed by vendors.

The EO is broadly positive &amp; well considered, containing constructive &amp; overdue goals, though we hope other key issues are addressed soon.
The EO neither over-expands DoD's role in securing national networks, nor calls for an expansion of gov control over private sector systems.
Trump's cyber EO directs agencies to secure &amp; modernize networks, defend critical infrastructure, &amp; sustain a cybersecurity workforce.

@da5ch0 @joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw That depends too, though agreed on the need for CFAA reform. But in that example there is no authorization.

@da5ch0 @joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw Right, but the metaphor only works so far. Only that particular voice print was the "IP address" - other voice prints not unauthorized.
@da5ch0 @joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw Seems to me Google Home worked as intended. It's authorized to respond to sound, &amp; viewers authorized the sound to be in their living rooms.
@da5ch0 @joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw Sure but the devices are configured differently. One seems to accept all sound w no user action, the other doesn't just accept all packets.
@joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw Consider also the profoundly bad policy of forbidding people from speaking certain phrases in an era of voice activated devices.
@joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw You bought a device that listens to sound. You turned on a tv that makes sound. You knew people could send commands to the device. Etc.
@joeynoname @LawyerLiz @UChicagoLaw The answer, of course, is it depends. I don't think the BK ad qualifies as a CFAA violation bc I believe ultimately they had authorization.

5) We have little means to measure &amp; counter the effects of propaganda war. Beefed up US Info Agency floated, but would Americans trust it?
4) Hearing was short on specifics regarding what the strategy should be beyond case-by-case proportionate retaliation.
3) Need an overarching deterrence strategy for cyber attack that considers diverse retaliatory methods, not just cyber countering cyber.
2) Don't just consider Russia penetration of political orgs in isolation, but as part of broader global political propaganda campaign.

.@NSAGov: Among greatest cyber threats: Theft of commercial info eroding nat'l advantage.

.@SenThomTillis: "In cyberspace, major weapons systems are created in 24-hr cycles &amp; you don't know if you have any defenses."
.@ODNIgov: "Should political institutions be considered critical infrastructure? Protections are good, but there's pushback. Not IC's call."
.@NSAGov: "We are exceeding uniform cyber workforce recruitment goals, but not civilians. Hard time retaining civilian talent over time."
.@ODNI: "We should have a US Information Agency to fight the global information war to a greater degree than we do right now."
.@ODNI: "I agree."
.@LindseyGrahamSC: "When it comes to passive collection, we should not throw rocks. We should throw rocks for active election interference."
.@SenAngusKing: Making info abt Russian activity public is important so people know what is going on, put it in context, &amp; defend themselves
.@ODNIgov: "Russia &amp; the US have a long history of political disinformation abroad. But we've never encountered a more aggressive campaign."
.@ODNIgov: "We have invested billions &amp; put peoples' lives at risk to obtain information. Revealing source/methods would imperil all that."
.@ODNIgov China has reduced their private sector cyber attacks for commercial gain, but continued cyber espionage after Obama/Xi agreement.
.@ODNIgov Cannot say in unclassified setting whether all targets are publicly known or where in Russian chain of command attack order came.
.@SenJoniErnst: Need to track cyber capabilities from Nat'l Guard and Coast Guard bc they are not being fully utilized.
.@ODNIgov: Hard to gauge the full impact of this campaign on the nation, but disturbing as an intelligence professional and a citizen.
.@ODNIgov "Lots of focus on hacking, but it's part of larger campaign that incl Russian-sponsored news disparaging US system, inc @RT_com."

.@NSAGov "Curious to see new Admin's direction on roles/responsibilities in cyber decisions. We need to get faster. We need to get faster."
.@NSAGov: "We need to review our recruitment and incentive structure to retain the cyber workforce of the future."
.@ODNIgov: "There is a difference btw skepticism of IC and disparagement. The IC is not perfect, we are an org of human beings."
.@SenJohnMcCain: "Seems like every [cyber] attack is handled on a case-by-case basis. That is not a strategy."
.@DeptofDefense: "We are concerned w Russia's global aggression, not just cyber attacks. Deterrence can focus on those non-cyber contexts."
@TheRealHorse Intel reports protecting sources/methods is very different than Russian gov issuing fake news authored by "American patriots."
@TheRealHorse I don't find it ironic. Fake news obscures the author of the news. The report will not obscure the author of the report.
.@ODNIgov "If you do retaliate in the cyber context w cyber, you don't know what kind of counter-retaliation you will get back."
.@ODNIgov There is no privacy anymore.
@TheRealHorse The unclassified report will say "Authored by CIA/FBI/NSA." You're saying you want the report to out our moles &amp; surveillance?
.@ODNIgov Russian-sponsored #fakenews campaign is ongoing, incl in Europe. Hiding source of information is classic propaganda technique.
.@ODNIgov Russian election interference was multi-faceted campaign. Hacking was one part of it, #fakenews &amp; propaganda were other parts.
.@ODNIgov The forthcoming report is written primarily by FBI, NSA, and CIA, who are now in agreement about Kremlin direction of attacks.
.@DeptofDefense: Next administration should take up cybersecurity and cyber-deterrence issues, and an integrated approach to them, early on.
.@NSAGov: No nation state is decreasing investment in cyber or backing away from tradecraft or capability.
.@ODNIgov IC should not decide whether the Russian action is an act of war. That decision is a very heavy policy question.
.@SenJohnMcCain "On Oct. 7th, IC expressed confidence Russia directed hacking of US political institutions." Clapper: More confident now.
.@NSAGov "Just-completed intel review on Russian cyber attacks will be shared with our leaders &amp; overseers shortly. This is a top priority."
.@ODNIgov: "Cyber is not a good counter to cyber. We should not put a lot of stock in cyber-deterrence. The deterrence is ephemeral."
.@ODNIgov: "We should not just counter cyber w cyber. We should consider all instruments of national power, but recognize we set precedent."
.@ODNIgov: "The Internet can be an echo chamber where ideas, true or false, can be amplified through constant repetition."
.@ODNIgov: "Encryption has affected our intelligence gathering. We need strengthen partnerships to address it while respecting privacy."
.@ODNIgov plans to release unclassified (keeping sources &amp; methods secret) report of Russian election interference to the public next week.
.@SenJackReed calls for new select senate committee to examine Russian election interference bc cuts across jurisdiction of many committees.
.@SenJohnMcCain: "Our nation has no policy/strategy for cyber-deterrence. We must demonstrate that cost to cyberattacks outweigh benefits."

@ErrataRob There's several. For some, the Committee reports must also be public. For example: https://t.co/ShZ9FWhq9I @emptywheel @normative
@ErrataRob USAF doesn't change the law [50 USC 1861(g)(2)] on that point. Again, USAF doesn't make the statute worse. @normative @emptywheel
@ErrataRob USAF did not, &amp; perhaps could not, change 12333. Where does USAF require info-sharing w non-FBI law enfor? @normative @emptywheel
@ErrataRob No, there are numerous public reporting requirements &amp; authorizations in USAF. Not perfect, but better. @emptywheel @normative
@emptywheel The universe did not expand if you compare the statute pre-USAF to post-USAF. You're comparing a particular program. @normative
@ErrataRob Not to mention transparency &amp; FISC reforms in USAF - which are far from perfect, but better than pre-USAF. @emptywheel @normative
@ErrataRob Disagree. Govt claimed PATRIOT pre-USAF allowed collection of entire country's metadata. Not anymore. @emptywheel @normative
@ErrataRob Again, USAF has nothing to do with that program. @emptywheel @normative
@ErrataRob USAF did not change who can get the authority to obtain records under 215. It was, &amp; continues to be, FBI. @emptywheel @normative
@ErrataRob You're describing a DEA program that USAF did not address, did not make worse or better. @emptywheel @normative

@edpol1 Worth repeating that this authority, which Cotton wants to reestablish, lets NSA sift through Americans' phone records w/o a warrant
@edpol1 There are other programs under other laws that are not aimed at collecting US-to-US calls, but that's not the point of Cotton's bill
@edpol1 The program was domestic, not targeted at "foreigners." NSA collected from US-to-US calls as well as US calls to and from overseas.
@edpol1 Please provide a link explaining that this is what Cotton refers to. Note that I am citing to Cotton's own legislation and op-ed.
@edpol1 This is the tweet that started the conversation: https://t.co/eog43SKNLw Cotton is referring to the NSA program.
@edpol1 I agree the NSA bulk collection of Americans' records is not vital, but that's how @SenTomCotton's op-ed describes it twice.
@edpol1 As for whether the info was vital, that's been debunked: https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx @SenTomCotton The NSA surveillance was ineffective.
@edpol1 @SenTomCotton would basically restart the domestic mass surveillance @Snowden revealed. Here's more info: https://t.co/I1nMIqWRXw

@edpol1 @SenTomCotton's bill, the Liberty Through Strength Act, is here:  https://t.co/kGd38o4GqO Look at Section (2)(a).
@edpol1 @SenTomCotton's tweet refers to "vital intel" https://t.co/eog43SKNLw. He explains in this misleading op-ed: https://t.co/1PGRz232iS
@edpol1 It's important for Constitutionalists to know what @SenTomCotton is doing. This will take a few tweets to explain, please bear w me.
@edpol1 That is exactly what @SenTomCotton's "Liberty Through Strength Act" would do, because he considers that "vital" intel.
@edpol1 As a Constitution defender, would it concern you if @SenTomCotton empowered NSA to collect all Americans' communications records?
@edpol1 My original tweet was in reply to @SenTomCotton's reference to his domestic mass surveillance bill, which has 4th Am issues.
@edpol1 You are mistaken, sir. The "vital intel" @SenTomCotton refers to are NSA-collected American phone records. @ShonnaU @cartho73
@ShonnaU And if you're so opposed to this POTUS, do you really want to give him more power to spy on Americans? @cartho73 @SenTomCotton
@ShonnaU I understand you feel that way, but ineffective NSA spying on all Americans is not a good solution. @cartho73 @SenTomCotton
@edpol1 For someone who's pro-Constitution, you should be concerned about the 4th Am implications of @SenTomCotton's bill @ShonnaU @cartho73
@edpol1 No. I'm very familiar w @SenTomCotton's legislation. It's definitely NSA surveillance of Americans' phone records @ShonnaU @cartho73
@cartho73 In fact, the same surveillance program @SenTomCotton wants to restart was in place before San Bernardino &amp; didn't stop it @ShonnaU
@cartho73 Here is information on how domestic mass surveillance failed to thwart any attacks: https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx @SenTomCotton @ShonnaU
@cartho73 @SenTomCotton is calling for mass surveillance of all Americans' communications - not just terrorists. @ShonnaU
@cartho73 Actually, the domestic mass surveillance program @SenTomCotton wants to restart repeatedly failed to stop any attacks. @ShonnaU
@ShonnaU @cartho73 The intel was not vital. @SenTomCotton wants NSA to collect phone records from all Americans, which won't stop terrorism.
@open_ai Hi! Thank you and best of luck in building empathetic AI to do glorious battle with the Decepticons.
@mijomarco @IJDOTCOM Importantly, the USA FREEDOM Act, of which the article urges repeal, does not modify many similar surveillance laws.
@mijomarco @IJDOTCOM To put it gently, this is hyperbole. The bulk collection program was totally ineffective. https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx
@mijomarco @IJDOTCOM While also claiming that restoration of #NSA bulk collection authority will enable intel agencies to protect us.
@mijomarco @IJDOTCOM Article repeatedly refers to #NSA's mass surveillance of Americans' phone records as key to security &amp; stopping terror.
@IndJournal A counterargument to this misleading article: https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx
@SenTomCotton @IndJournal @IJDOTCOM Restoring #NSA's telephony bulk collection won't protect us. It's actually risky to claim it will.
@SenTomCotton @IndJournal @IJDOTCOM Sorry, but this article is full of inaccuracies about the importance of #NSA mass domestic surveillance.
@wesleydonehue @NateRBrand The article is full of hyperbole to fool the less informed. #NSA's program was ineffective, wasteful, &amp; invasive.
@wesleydonehue @NateRBrand @courtneysimmone The claim that bulk collection is key to security is thoroughly debunked https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx
@IJDOTCOM @SenTomCotton The #NSA's telephony bulk collection was invasive &amp; ineffective domestic mass surveillance: https://t.co/MzsFrmpAtx
@IJDOTCOM @SenTomCotton Senator, this article way oversells the importance of #NSA telephony bulk collection to national security.

@MattSchroyer Yes, one day they could. Think about that creatively.
@MattSchroyer Drone hunting licenses are a joke. But yes, people feel strongly about privacy. Best for industry &amp; gov to set real standards.
@MattSchroyer It would be unpersuasive to claim that NSA spying means there should be no problem w/ adding another layer of surveillance.
@MattSchroyer I think #drones, though, are alarming to many people because they are physical, not abstract, &amp; have a multitude of operators.
@MattSchroyer There was a lot of public engagement on NSA reform post-Snowden. Congressional action too, in the form of the USA FREEDOM Act.
@MattSchroyer Yes, they have, and they probably want privacy protection from both.

@Jim_Harper Same principle. What's "highly offensive to reasonable person" will likely evolve to erode privacy from drones. @AdamThierer
@AdamThierer On the contrary, it is my expectation that common law in this area will evolve to further reduce REOP. @Jim_Harper
@Jim_Harper Of course. But not every tech looks at you from public airspace while you're on private property. This impacts the analysis, no?

.@CenDemTech strongly opposes @SenatorBurr's draft bill. It does not improve any of the surveillance issues raised in the last two years.
Doesn't end bulk collection, expands surveillance, no FISC transparency. I dunno y'all, @SenatorBurr's bill seems like a good compromise.
Burr draft (pg. 67) allows prosecution of gov employees who knowingly receive, retain, or make available classified info w/o authorization.
@HarleyGeiger Correction: Not via national security letters, but 18 USC 2709. No court approval. FBI just certifies relevance to get ECTRs.
Burr bill, pg 66: FBI can obtain "relevant" electronic communications transaction records (ECTR) via NSLs w/ no court approval.
Burr draft contains no FISC opinion transparency - an very important omission that does nothing to address the problem of secret law.
Burr draft allows AG to get an order to demand telecom/Internet companies retain call detail records for "at least" three years. (pg. 33)
Burr draft (pg 60) removes sunsets for Sec. 215, roving wiretaps, and lone wolf, makes these #PATRIOTAct authorities permanent.
Speed-reading through Burr draft. Looks like no changes to FISA pen/trap or NSLs. Therefore clearly no end to nationwide bulk collection.

@emptywheel If I recall, that's a reason the USAF exclusion refers to (but isn't limited to) digital content: easy to define. @tinleyharrier
@emptywheel Not sure what those records contained. Certainly w/ various records, the content/metadata line is hard to draw. @tinleyharrier
@emptywheel @tinleyharrier I had presumed they got who bought from who, when, for how much, but not the items purchased.
@emptywheel Good question. I understand DOJ/FISC interprets it to exclude content. Statute is vague, so we pushed to clarify. @tinleyharrier
@emptywheel @tinleyharrier @just_security USAF content exclusion isn't exclusive. Does not imply other content is okay. We pushed for it.

@PGEddington @tinleyharrier Right. After the celebration comes defending against the reauth. Still big risk of something weaker than USAF.

@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka "No corporate identifiers" would raise legit real world problems unrelated to mass surveillance.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich I rank the FISC opinion transparency provisions highly as a reform. Very big deal.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich B/c I think the FISC opinion transparency provisions address this problem.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich And any significant use of SST must be reported. These are decent protections.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich Again, they named ECS in nonexclusive clause that should encompass large financial inst.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich No, I don't think "no corporate identifier" is necessary. I think the limitation works.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich No, I believe it says novel OR significant. Bulk collection will be significant.
@emptywheel @LizaGoitein @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich Effective, sure. Impossible for security &amp; political reasons, definitely.
@SeanVitka @LizaGoitein @emptywheel @JohnWonderlich Def of financIal inst is expansive. Assume we're more worried about Visa than pawn shop.
Worth noting that financial institutions as SST would trigger transparency provisions. @LizaGoitein @emptywheel @SeanVitka @JohnWonderlich

@granick I presume the argument is that liability protection for companies &amp; agencies in 2702(b)(7) is too limited for broad sharing.
We could do a lot worse than the White House's #cybersecurity info sharing proposal, but the #CFAA proposal would do more harm than good.
WH #CFAA proposal makes it a felony to violate use policies of any government computer. This would include public libraries &amp; state schools.
A reason this is significant, &amp; why I think RICO is a bad fit, is that online community ("enterprise") participation is so easy &amp; casual.

@csoghoian What is the most important thing the proposal should say instead? I keep hearing about how info sharing is crucial.
@marciahofmann @mattblaze @astepanovich Yes. Also enhances penalties for (a)(4), instead of eliminating it for being redundant of (a)(2).
@mattblaze @astepanovich Believe so. Previous interpretation was one count triggered higher sentencing for the other counts. Super harsh.
@mattblaze @astepanovich Not saying it's adequate, but it does remove "subsequent offense" language, which racked up sentencing for Swartz.
@mattblaze @astepanovich Don't think so. Swartz already faced multiple (a)(2) counts. Also, WH #CFAA proposal makes changes to sentencing.
@treyford Sec. 103(a)-(b) allows for private sharing, with liability protection if sent to DHS or private info-sharing orgs. @marciahofmann
@SwiftOnSecurity I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU AND IMMA LET YOU FINISH BUT @KANYEWEST IS THE BEST INFOSEC ACCOUNT OF ALL TIME @TechCrunch
@marciahofmann I think Swartz &amp; Nosal could still be prosecuted (sentences reduced somewhat under WH proposal). Maybe not weev.
@marciahofmann Right. I think they're saying what's not criminalized under their rewrite is insignificant activity.
@marciahofmann Probably referring to TOS violations that didn't meet their rewrite of 1030(a)(2), like lying about your identity on MySpace.
RICO covers anyone participating in an enterprise's racketeering. If #CFAA added, would discussing a DDOS op in IRC w/ other hackers count?
RICO aimed at people who order crimes but don't carry out crimes. Conspiracy covers a lot of this already, but RICO penalties are harsher.
WH proposal would make felony violations of #CFAA part of RICO. Unclear why this is needed. RICO an ill fit for many computer crimes.
WH's #CFAA proposal scales back criminalizing TOS violations, unless you're on a gov-owned computer, or obtain info in furtherance of felony
@marciahofmann http://t.co/njDiazgsAx

Collection is not access. And the 22 #NSA employees with access to the country's metadata is not statutorily mandated. Could always change.
We live in a dangerous world &amp; need the military to collect the communications records of the entire nation in order to protect us...?
The telcos already hold the records. No data security benefit to giving a copy to the gov't. Plus phone companies don't put you in jail.
.@SenFeinstein Yes, the government uses the 215 program "all the time" - the telcos are forced to send call records to #NSA every day.
@jujueyeball @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @emptywheel @froomkin Yes, the advocacy orgs stand united against bad amndmnts like data retention.
@ggreenwald @matthewstoller @emptywheel @froomkin Potentially many good ones too. Again, though, most will not come to the floor for a vote.

@ggreenwald @matthewstoller @emptywheel @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin We think bill is net positive, &amp; I trust the other supporting orgs do too.
@emptywheel @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin Back to topic at hand: Relying on courts is risky &amp; produces narrow reform.
@emptywheel @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin Also inaccurate.
@emptywheel @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin Sorry, this is simply inaccurate.
@emptywheel @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin Nothing on pen/trap, NSL gags, FISC transparency, special advocate, etc.
@emptywheel @ggreenwald @matthewstoller @AlexanderAbdo @froomkin The court judgments, even if govt loses, get you less than USA FREEDOM Act.

@chinamanblue We are hoping to do our part to change that.
@chinamanblue ...USAF removes good faith requirement in existing law. We want the good faith requirement back in. Just one example.
@chinamanblue What I mean is that USAF doesn't create new company immunity. Immunity already in law: 18 USC 1861(e). But...
@chinamanblue That is our calculation. Waiting for better reform from Congress &amp; the courts is far more risky &amp; unlikely to be as effective.
@chinamanblue For example, we want to see the good faith requirement in existing law built into company immunity provision.
@chinamanblue Our financials are on our site. CDT does take company funds (&amp; grants &amp; foundations, etc). Our voice is independent, though.
@chinamanblue The bill is a compromise. Necessary for Congress. Already struggling to get passed. Will likely compromise more next session.
@chinamanblue @EFF The case would reform a small part of the problem, not all the other things in the bill. Still get more with legislation.
@chinamanblue @EFF The prospect of 215 sunsetting in the next Congress is nil. We think we get less reform next session than with this bill.
@chinamanblue Bill reforms 215, pen/trap, NSLs, FISC opinion transparency, company reporting, gov reporting, &amp; more. Not perfect, but good.
@chinamanblue @EFF Read it very closely. Bill does a lot of stuff that we would not get even if 215 sunsets, such as pen/trap &amp; FISC reform.
@chinamanblue @EFF Much less than we gain. It's time to stand up for actual solutions that have a chance of becoming law.

@RT4_Chicago I see. So the plan is 1) Congress sunsets 215, 2) SCOTUS overturns Smith, 3) Congress reforms other nat'l security laws. Okay.
@RT4_Chicago Not to mention a 215 sunset does nothing for FISC transparency, NSL gag orders, etc. We still lose a lot even if 215 sunsets.
@RT4_Chicago Let's say 215 expires. You of course know NSA also did bulk collection under pen/trap, which is not sunsetting but USAF reforms
@RT4_Chicago Amash/Conyers would've defunded bulk collection of (only) phone records. Would not defund all 215 activity. Way less than USAF.
@RT4_Chicago Yep. And I could be wrong, but I'd bet money that Congress will renew 215 some way, some how. Maybe just with some garnish.
@RT4_Chicago Yes. Neither one of those votes would have sunset 215. And then there's that pesky Senate.
@RT4_Chicago No, it will be the security hawks, undecideds, &amp; leadership in Congress that renew it over the calls of our org for more reform
@RT4_Chicago Again, no one expects 215 to sunset completely. Congress could just include some minimal reform, less than USAF, and renew it.
@RT4_Chicago What I mean is sunset doesn't prevent Congress from renewing. Sunsets are put in law to force Congress to review periodically.
@RT4_Chicago A sunset doesn't require a law to expire. Congress renews all the time. When have they ever let a security authority sunset?
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul We certainly agree bulk collection is illegal and unconstitutional. https://t.co/fLVqJcfR8i
@RT4_Chicago Will never be totally clear. USAF is struggling to get through Congress already. 215 won't sunset. This is the high water mark.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul Clearly I agree that order was improper, which is why I support USAF curbing more abuse. But 215 ain't a warrant.
@RT4_Chicago There's also a bands of 250 option. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it's a hell of a lot better than what we have now.
@RT4_Chicago It won't be completely clear, but not true we will "have no idea" because of the FISC opinion transparency in the bill.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul No. 215 orders are not warrants. They are much more like a national security subpoena, except a judge sees them.
@RT4_Chicago I'm sorry, that's just not true. https://t.co/uP47lbfV2x
@RT4_Chicago Disagree. Amicus provision is one of the weaker protections in the bill. The bill has a lot better stuff in it than the amicus.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul Only warrants are probable cause. Subpoenas are only relevance standard, like 215, &amp; no judge needs to approve.
@RT4_Chicago Much more important than amicus to me are the bill's provisions on transparency of FISC opinions.
@RT4_Chicago Agree this is a shortcoming in the bill, but bill requires FISC to report all instances it refuses to allow special advocate.
@RT4_Chicago Riley was about searching a personal cell phone incident to arrest. Very different than searching biz recs for nat'l security.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul So all subpoenas are unconstitutional?
@RT4_Chicago No. Monthly demand for call recs would still be covered by the general 215 authority, which USAF reforms to prevent dragnet.
@RT4_Chicago Yes. The third party doctrine makes a savage mockery of the 4th Amendment in the digital age. But SCOTUS could go either way.
@RT4_Chicago No. USAF makes reforms to 215, pen/trap, NSLs, FISC procedure, FISC opinions, gov reporting, &amp; private party reporting, etc...
@RT4_Chicago The NSA lawsuits are much more narrow than USAF, much less reform than the bill, &amp; no guarantee they'll succeed at SCOTUS.
@RT4_Chicago Agree the House will not renew 215 without some reform, but I believe that reform will fall short of what is in USAF right now.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul 215 permits targeted biz record collection, which isn't unconstitutional. USAF aims to prevent dragnets under 215.
@RT4_Chicago Sorry to disagree, but USAF is much better than the status quo and the chances of Congress sunsetting 215 are minimal.
@DCreDC I think we'll see amendments, both good and bad.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul There's lots of legit uses of 215. Could pose security problems if it expires. But it should expire if no reform.
@RT4_Chicago @SenRandPaul Many people do know USAF extends 215. The point of the bill is to prevent abuses of 215, not let 215 expire.
.@SenRandPaul Suggest amndmnt to USAF that brings sunsets for Sec. 702, lone wolf, &amp; roving wiretaps to Dec. 2015. Guarantee action next yr.
.@SenRandPaul An amendment to #USAFreedomAct on PATRIOT sunsets would be more effective than a (rumored) amendment on standing.
