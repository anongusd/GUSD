@scotthortonshow War is one of the primary causes of our decline and Frum, Goldberg, etc. all bear blame. I've never denied that and thinking that Goldberg has made some good points in other areas doesn't change that.
@scotthortonshow That's David Frum whom I've attacked constantly. Just because you find positive things in a book someone writes in 2018 doesn't mean you endorse their publication's entire oeuvre going back 20 years.
@scotthortonshow Chill, Scott. It's a book review, not an assessment of Goldberg's entire history. The things he wrote about Iraq are dismal and embarrassing.

Anything could happen though. RT @seanpgaynor Fox News reporting Stupak "very close" to deal. @AmandaKohut

Exhausted. Taking a night off with a good book after a long week.
Watched a man reel in an 18" fish from a bridge near the Jefferson Memorial.
Just saw a yellow line train to Fort Totten pull up on the Huntington side. Now I've seen it all. #metrofail
DC's beautiful tonight (although a little hot)
That is one huge vein in Ed Schultz's forehead.
DayQuil gel caps seriously don't need to be the size of cucumbers.
Apartment situation is worked out! Praise Jesus Christ Almighty.
kind of sort of occasionally wishes that Barney Frank was on our side. http://tinyurl.com/qft5yn
So my boss thinks I have swine flu. Not encouraging.
RIP Robert Novak. One hell of a journalist.
Back at work after one miserable head cold.
@AlexandraCSmith I have no idea what you're talking about, baby doll.
Is convinced that some people think applying for a room on Craig's List is a form of flirtation.
When will this apartment madness end?
Recuperating with a good book.
Sick as a dog.
@EKilroy announcing a new anthology: "Dear...: A Collection of Erin's Most Hateful Twitter Letters to Abstract Groups of People"
Sitting on the Alexandria waterfront watching the sun set.
Fun fact: staying out all night when you're sick and on 5 hours sleep can have consequences the next day. Write that one down, kids.
Warning for anyone going out tonight: Metro is all fucked up. #metrofail
Off to drink and be merry.
@EKilroy Please, I wouldn't have to pay for that. And maybe if you'd release your damn birth certificate, this wouldn't be happening.
Rep. Murphy gets a taste of average American anger outside a Stop and Shop I used to go to in Simsbury: http://tinyurl.com/o9eryz
Blahhhhh sore throat. Two days back and I'm wishing I was still on vacation.
is talking to potential Craig's List roommates tonight. One lucky normal-ish seeming winner will be relocating his futon to Crystal Plaza!
@KristinDavison AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
The guy who brought his gun to the Obama rally did pretty well under Chris Matthews' questioning. http://bit.ly/3Uu8c (via @AmandaCarpenter)
Back to DC tonight! Vacation wasn't long enough.
Only on a flight to DC would someone tell me they can't watch my bags during a bathroom break bc it's against DHS rules. What an absurd city
@daniellembeck Congrats DBecks! Glad everything is going so well.
Last day in Florida. Spending it wisely drinking around the world at Epcot.
@EKilroy haha if I didn't make sweeping generalizations about what you think and you didn't start yelling at me, what would we talk about?
@EKilroy not a generalization. The D moderates defended the protesters as patriotic. Now they're calling them illegit. That's the point.
@EKilroy lol huh?? Go back and reread it, it made perfect grammatical sense.
@EKilroy yes but by the left's standard in 2003, that's all patriotic dissent and legit anger. Unless libs are hypocrites or something...
Vanilla bean Coolata from Dunks = glorious salvation.
@EKilroy Sorry healthcare protesters. The birthers are nuts.
@Phamilton72 Just interesting how the people who dissented Iraq now think dissenters are industry mobs to be reported to WhiteHouse.gov.
Remember when dissent was patriotic?
One of the most intense games of the season #Sox #Yankees
Josh Beckett after a strikeout: "That's right motherfucker!!"
Drinking at the ESPN Zone and watching the Sox game with Aunt Kathy, Uncle Stan, and Doug.

"Wheah's the cah Janie?!" Here 5 minutes and the whole family's fighting already haha.
@KristinDavison I think he has a big red button that turns it on and off and makes a rooster noise.
CNBC store at the airport listening to Jim Cramer's omniscient voice. His shirt sleeves must be extra-rolled up today.
Flying out of Reagan tonight instead of BWI! Go fuck yourself, B30 bus.
Bracing for my first Five Guys lunch in a year.
Wow...major serious kudos to #BillClinton.
@KristinDavison I'll raise you 20 bucks he cries on a fish he's cutting up.
"We should plan a heist at Professor Gates' house and ransack it! I know the police aren't going to come." - Howie Carr caller hahaha
Counting down the hours until Florida.
@RyanDWinn You and I are having the worst travel experiences this week. #metrofail #megabusfail
Just finished the first 2 hours of Keith Olbermann's special comment. Apparently Republicans are prostituting the system. Or something.
Sloooooow boring day.
@AlexandraCSmith Why don't you have a seat right over there. What are you doing here?
Great time in NYC with great friends. Good luck to Alex as he heads for #Iraq.
Megabus philosophy: a pissed off and inconvenienced customer is still a customer.
is in the city that never sleeps.
is going out in NYC tonight!
@JPeterDonald Agreed. It's not even close.
#metrofail and #megabusfail both in the same morning. Missing my car big time right now.
Happy hour in beautiful Alexandria tonight a success. New York City tomorrow!!
@KristinDavison I've always felt "Be Our Guest" was subtle communist propaganda.
So long Justin Masterson. A truly reliable reliever.
Loves old town Alexandria at night. Beautiful.
Republican beer summit was a success with @colinschmitt @RyanDWinn @alexandracsmith. There is no longer racism in the world.
Republican beer summit at hawk and dove tonight!
is out arresting a civil rights leader so he too can have a Beer Summit with the president. Free booze on Obama's dime sounds good to me.
And on the ninth day God gave man tater tots and ranch dressing.
Earning tonight's happy hour.
And on the 8th day, God gave man Killian's.
It's too damn hot out.
"Crystal City is a beehive of overweight contractors, military personnel in ill-fitting civilian clothes, and spooks behind sunglasses."
@KristinDavison Please make Dodd go away. Please.
Sarah Palin "puts the twit back in Twitter". Oh you are a riotous wordsmith, Richard Wolffe.
A quiet day in Old Town Alexandria.
There's nothing two cups of black coffee won't immediately solve.
Is watching Goldeneye and having 7th grade video game flashbacks.
Mexican or pizza for lunch? The question that has haunted man since the dawn of civilization.
iPhonefail on texts for some reason. Let me know if you texted me today and I didn't respond.
Latest group POTUS pisses off: Boston cops.

takes back everything bad he ever said about people with blackberries. I can't shut this thing off.
Thank god for the pool. Now if I just had a TV to watch obamas speech on.
Run, pool, bar. Good evening.
Currently entering hour 3 of the opening statement of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Pompous Ass-R.I.) in the Sotomayor hearings.

Star Wars marathon on SpikeTV.
Dammit, Governor Sanford!

What a depressing week it's been. And you're killing me here, Smoltz.

Breaking: two U.S. journalists sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp in North Korea. Obama's first foreign policy crisis.
Coming to DC later this week and needs a place to crash. Any offers?

just drank an obscene quantity of Dunkin Donuts coffee.
back to DC in two weeks!
can't believe it's all coming to an end.
@LauraDonovanUA that press conference was hilarious wasn't it?
Writing a 15 page paper on South Park. Awesome.
Papelbon comes through again.
@63perrone I'm just kidding, I love you and damn you for getting me addicted to Twitter. I'm a full blown addict now.
@63perrone Victoria telling people to stop bitching? Oh, the irony...hahaha
@EdwardRSmith What's that sound on his computer? It sounds like a retarded toucan of some sort. I'm gonna walk by and have a look.
@EdwardRSmith Leahy isn't a place for kids to be brats and annoyingly loud! It's a place for students to be brats and annoyingly loud.
@EdwardRSmith Why the hell are they wearing firefighter costumes?
Lazy lazy Saturday.
Just failed an archaeology test in the last class of his college career. What a way to go out!
AFF happy hour @ 6 and annoyed by the schizophrenic weather.
