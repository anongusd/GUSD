But, again, the sheriff declined to offer details on why they believe Paddock intended to survive the rampage and escape
Sheriff Lombardo told reporters he believes Paddock was concerned about his own fate because he planned to survive
Paddock killed 58 people and injured nearly 500 in just 10 mins. LVMPD is not sure why he stopped shooting because arsenal was not depleted
It‚Äôs not clear what Paddock was doing between 10:18pm and 11:20pm, when police breached his room
Shooting began at 10:05pm, ended at 10:15pm. Paddock shot a security guard outside room at 10:18pm. Cops entered Paddock‚Äôs room at 11:20pm
2) Sheriff suspects Paddock told had help and 3) Shooter had rented an airbnb condo the prev weekend overlooking another festival
