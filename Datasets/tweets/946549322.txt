People deserve to know that their drinking water is healthy and safe. The EPA has dragged its feet for far too long when it comes to addressing PFAS contamination, and we need action. Our bipartisan bill would designate all PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances.

Forced arbitration clauses undermine the rights of workers and consumers by restricting their ability to take corporations to court. We're working to end forced arbitration by introducing the FAIR ACT to restore Americans' right to seek justice.

Former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler‚Äôs record of putting big oil and corporate special interests before the health of our people, economy, and environment makes him completely unfit to continue leading the EPA. I voted NO on his confirmation.

The House just passed our bipartisan bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, conserve the Nashua River, and more. This bill is good for New Hampshire and our environment. I urge the President to sign it without delay.
The President's constitutionally dubious emergency declaration would take funding from vital national security priorities to fulfill an ill-conceived campaign slogan. The House just voted to revoke this declaration. I urge my GOP colleagues to vote to revoke it in the Senate too.

Members of both parties have expressed strong concerns both about the legality of such a move and the effect it would have on our national security if the President takes money intended for existing military construction projects.
Declaring a state of emergency to try to fulfill a campaign slogan is a dangerous path to go down and I strongly urge the President to reconsider.

Disappointed that William Barr was just confirmed as Attorney General. From his comments on executive power to the special counsel's investigation, Mr. Barr has made clear that he is not fit to lead the Department of Justice. That's why I voted NO.
Parents should not have to worry about whether the water they are giving their children is safe, and the EPA must stop dragging its feet on giving our communities the guidance they need.
Nearly a year ago, Scott Pruitt promised action on setting an enforceable drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS, yet now the EPA is saying communities will have to wait almost another full year before the EPA will even decide whether it will set a drinking water standard.
It is totally unacceptable that the EPA is once again delaying setting an enforceable drinking water standard. While I appreciate that there are some positive steps forward in this Action Plan, it continues to be lacking on this critical issue. https://t.co/UUff4r6DM5

Relieved @POTUS finally agreed to reopen the government while we keep negotiating on addressing border security. Americans have suffered because the President turned down this same deal in December. We can find a way forward but he must stop using people as political pawns.

The President said he‚Äôd be ‚Äúproud‚Äù to shut down the government and unfortunately here we are. On Wednesday all 100 senators supported a clean funding extension - a deal the President said he‚Äôd accept. I urge the President to come to the table now and end this shutdown.

Bipartisan criminal justice reform will help make the system fairer and more effectively reduce crime, which is why this commonsense bill is supported by everyone from 87 Senators, to President Trump, the ACLU, criminal prosecutors, and law enforcement officers.
Thank you for your work reporting on this important issue. It‚Äôs completely unacceptable that patients are getting massive surprise bills even for care they thought was in their insurance network. https://t.co/DvjbJ9HQ5Q

Thomas Farr has worked throughout his legal career to undermine voting rights, and now the President wants to make him a federal judge. We need one more Senator to stand for civil rights and join us in voting no on his nomination.

My full statement on the deeply disappointing confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court: https://t.co/GSymyLGb1b
Judge Kavanaugh is the antithesis of the impartial arbiter that a Supreme Court Justice must be, and the American people deserve far better.
There are many ways to corroborate allegations of sexual assault. We need to send a clear message to survivors that you deserve the opportunity to pursue justice and we will support you. Don‚Äôt let anything you‚Äôve seen over the past weeks make you doubt that. 8/8
But the way my colleagues have been speaking about ‚Äúcorroborating evidence‚Äù has potential dangerous implications far beyond the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. I believe survivors. I also believe in the critical importance of due process. 7/
The question of whether Judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed was not about whether allegations of sexual assault met a certain legal standard of evidence. It was about whether he had earned a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. 6/
Which brings me back to the definition of ‚Äúcorroborating evidence.‚Äù We cannot go back to the old standards where if there were no eyewitness nor DNA evidence, a survivor could not pursue justice. 5/
No good attorney who could review the FBI‚Äôs reopened background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh would say it was a serious investigation to get the truth. There are simply too many potential leads the FBI was not allowed to follow. 4/
My colleagues have argued that the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh was comprehensive because they were allowed to interview the people who could‚Äôve possibly been an eyewitness to the alleged sexual assault. I reviewed the report and that‚Äôs wrong. 3/
It‚Äôs very rare in cases of sexual assault to have an eyewitness. It's also rare to have DNA evidence for many reasons ‚Äì including that the vast majority of sexual assaults are not reported to the police. But those are not the only ways to get the truth. 2/
As a Senator ‚Äì and an attorney ‚Äì I‚Äôve been deeply concerned by how some of my colleagues have been defining ‚Äúcorroborating evidence‚Äù when it comes to cases of sexual assault. I know this is technical and it may seem insignificant. But it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs critical. Here's a thread 1/
Watch my full speech on the Senate floor last night about why I‚Äôm voting NO on Judge Kavanaugh: https://t.co/yOLrQajYBO

The minute that the President signs this legislation into law, we must begin working on the next bill to help strengthen treatment, prevention, recovery, and law enforcement efforts. The urgency of this crisis demands nothing less.
This bipartisan bill gives communities more of the supports they need to combat the opioid crisis ‚Äì including expanding treatment centers, training providers, and giving more tools to law enforcement. The list goes on.

Pausing Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination process for a week while the FBI investigates the serious allegations that have been raised against him is the right thing to do. Dr. Ford called for an FBI investigation, and I applaud the bipartisan effort that helped make this happen.
The American Bar Association called for a pause in Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination process until the FBI can re-open its background investigation. Republicans can pause this process at any time to get to the truth, the Judiciary Committee should not move ahead with its vote today.
RT @kasie: REMARKABLE: The American Bar Association calls for a delay in Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation until the FBI can investigate
In Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs initial hearings, he showed a lack of truthfulness on a range of issues. Today‚Äôs testimony only reinforced my questions about his credibility. The Senate should halt this confirmation process and there should be an FBI investigation.
Thank you, Dr. Ford. Your bravery and poise as you told your story have touched millions across this country. I hear you and I believe you.

It is simply unacceptable that survivors are still not being listened to and taken seriously. Today, as Dr. Ford testifies she deserves to be heard and treated with respect -- but she also deserves better than this sham process, she deserves an FBI investigation.

A lifetime of vicious attacks. Their reputations. Possibly their jobs. Even their personal safety. These survivors are risking everything, and they MUST be taken seriously.
I am struck by how too many of my colleagues are focusing on what is at risk for Judge Kavanaugh. They should focus more on what these women are risking by speaking out.

This allegation against Judge Kavanaugh is serious and needs to be investigated fully. The Senate has an obligation to do everything it can to uncover the truth given its constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent with regard to lifetime judicial nominations.
Professor Ford has come forward with an allegation of sexual assault, detailing a painful experience that will ring true to many women. Sadly, what will also ring true is the rush to marginalize and attack her.

It is long past time that Congress takes real action to help prevent senseless acts of gun violence. I joined @SenatorShaheen and colleagues from both parties on a bipartisan bill that would ensure that the criminal background check system works as intended.
@SenCoryGardner It was a pleasure working with @RepRobinKelly and @FrankPallone on the Connected Government Act. Pleased it will become law soon.

BREAKING: 50,000 Granite Staters signed up for health coverage during open enrollment, nearly matching last year's sign-ups despite Trump's sabotage attempts. I‚Äôll keep working to lower costs and ensure that all Granite Staters have access to quality, affordable coverage.
President Trump must not attempt to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Muller's investigation. I will keep working with @MarkWarner and others to ensure that Mueller is allowed to follow the facts wherever they may lead.
This is not a partisan issue. Last week, I joined with Senators from both parties who represent some of the hardest hit states in the country to reiterate our calls for additional federal funding to combat this crisis. We need more resources and I won't stop fighting for them.
Congress must act now to provide additional federal resources to strengthen treatment, prevention, recovery, and law enforcement efforts and give those on the front lines the support they need to fight this epidemic.
Every day, Granite Staters and people across America are suffering at the hands of substance misuse disorder or watching their loved ones suffer. This cannot continue.

Caring for older loved ones often falls to women, causing many to exit the workforce. We need to support these family caregivers, which is why I helped introduce a bill to provide modest retirement compensation for those who care for a loved one. https://t.co/PMJVddLxmH
They had an opportunity to work toward real, bipartisan tax reform. But instead, Senate Republicans just passed a bill that is a giveaway to corporate special interests and the ultra-wealthy at the expense of hard-working Americans. The American people deserve better.
I will be voting NO on the GOP tax bill that has its priorities completely backward -- undermining our health care system and adding to the national debt in order to benefit corporate special interests and the wealthiest few.

The GOP tax bill is a partisan bill, crafted behind closed doors, and it does NOT have the right priorities.

Votes are resuming on the #GOPTaxBill. We can't stop fighting now. https://t.co/1gttLEJKpN
NOW is the time to speak up. The next votes on the #GOPTaxBill have been delayed until tomorrow. Their current bill doesn‚Äôt help hard-working Americans, it just benefits corporate special interests &amp; the wealthiest few. We need to keep fighting for real, bipartisan tax reform.
The #GOPTaxBill will add ONE TRILLION dollars to our national debt per official score from the non-partisan @jctgov. This tax bill is in no way fiscally responsible.
Fundamentally, the #GOPTaxBill is bad for everyone but corporate special interests and the wealthiest few. I'm going do everything I can to fight it. 	 	Don't stop speaking out.  5/5
The #GOPTaxBill would also raise health care premiums by 10% yearly, lead to 13 million more uninsured Americans, and would add significantly to the national debt ‚Äì which some will use as an excuse to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid going forward. 4/
By 2027, 84% of taxpayers would either see very little change or an INCREASE in their taxes under the #GOPTaxBill. 37 million households who earn under $200,000 would see their taxes go up by 2027. 3/
The newest analysis from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation shows that next year, nearly 13 million hard-working middle class families who earn under $200,000 a year would pay MORE in taxes under the #GOPTaxBill. 2/
We could be voting on a #GOPTaxBill as early as tonight that Republicans are still changing behind closed doors. How bad is this bill for hard-working families? Here is what we know so far: 1/

The GOP tax plan risks raising millions‚Äô taxes, people‚Äôs health care, and even our national security just to give tax breaks to corporate special interests and the wealthiest few. That‚Äôs why we must continue to fight it ‚Äî don‚Äôt stop speaking out.
After repeated failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the GOP is using this tax plan to sabotage our health care system in a way that would increase health care premiums by an additional 10% a year and mean 13 million fewer people would have health insurance.
Three former Secretaries of Defense from both parties have said that increasing our deficit could mean critical cuts that would make our nation less safe.
This legislation is fiscally irresponsible, dramatically increasing the budget deficit by almost 1.5 trillion dollars. In fact, recent analysis has shown that this plan could risk triggering a $25 billion cut to Medicare.
It eliminates property and local tax deductions, which would mean a tax increase for thousands of Granite Staters.
The latest from the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation shows that millions of families earning less than $75K would see a tax increase while the wealthiest few and corporations wouldn‚Äôt.
I firmly believe in tax reform that puts hard-working families and small businesses first. Unfortunately, that is not what the GOP tax bill does. Here is why:
I'm constantly reminded of the generosity of our state.

@FCC @AjitPaiFCC This is about basic communication. 128,000 Granite Staters and 83,000 of Granite State businesses rely on these services. And we must ensure that as we upgrade our communications networks, we protect existing service.
@FCC Currently, telecom providers must notify customers before making changes to their copper networks, increasing accountability.  But Chairman @AjitPaiFCC wants to change this rule, meaning millions could see a change in their service with no warning and no guarantees.
@FCC Tomorrow, the @FCC is voting on the Accelerating Wireline Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to Infrastructure Investment order.
Millions rely on traditional copper networks for phone service. The @FCC could vote to weaken rules that protect them. I support efforts to upgrade our telephone networks from copper to fiber, but consumers MUST have notice and assurances that the replacement will be sufficient.
This is completely backward: Under the revised #GOPTaxPlan, big corporations get to keep their tax cuts forever while the middle class loses theirs by 2025.

Let's call the GOP tax plan what it really is: A tax break for big corporations and the wealthiest at the expense of hard-working families.
The GOP tax plan also scraps the state &amp; local tax deduction which benefits over 200,000 Granite Staters (86% of whom make less than $200k)
The GOP tax plan eliminates the personal and dependent exemptions, which would hurt more than 300,000 Granite Staters.
The GOP is proposing a tax plan they claim cuts taxes for the middle class. The reality? 114,000 households in New Hampshire would pay more.

IMPORTANT READ from NH Health Care Assoc. CEO Brendan Williams: #GrahamCassidy is an attack on those on Medicaid: https://t.co/w0Eyo4uRTo
Bottom-line: The #GrahamCassidy bill is just as dangerous as prior attempts to repeal the ACA &amp; we must stop it in its tracks
10)This bill has been introduced in the midst of bipartisan efforts to strengthen the individual insurance market, putting that work at risk
9) Like prior versions of #Trumpcare, this #GrahamCassidy bill targets women's health and bars state reimbursements to Planned Parenthood
8) It guts the requirement that insurers must cover essential health benefits like substance use disorder, mental health &amp; maternity care
7) It would allow insurers to hike people‚Äôs premiums the moment they get sick, even if they've been paying while healthy for years
6) This bill would lead to higher out-of-pocket costs &amp; take away premium assistance from millions of hard-working people
5) #GrahamCassidy also undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions
4) It cuts over $410 million dollars in federal funding for Medicaid to NH by 2026
3) These massive Medicaid cuts would also lead to funding cuts for school districts and students with disabilities
2) It caps and cuts Medicaid for seniors and people who experience disabilities ‚Äì putting community-based care programs at risk
1) It ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have called the #1 tool at our disposal to combat the opioid crisis
#GrahamCassidy health care repeal would be devastating for millions of Americans &amp; we cannot let it pass. Here are a few of the reasons why:

I'm ready to work with anyone who is serious about lowering health care costs and expanding coverage, but this bill would do the opposite.
And the bill further undermines protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
It still strips health insurance away altogether from millions of Americans, and greatly hinders our efforts to combat the opioid crisis.
With latest version released, it's abundantly clear there is no fixing the #Trumpcare bill - still leads to higher costs for worse coverage
Every American deserves the opportunity to be fully included in their community. Caregivers help advance this principle.

#Trumpcare also undermines the requirement that insurance companies must cover mental health and substance use disorder services
#Trumpcare ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the number one tool we have to fight the substance misuse crisis
#Trumpcare would hurt hard-working people across NH &amp; America ‚Äì particularly harming efforts to combat the substance misuse crisis
I am grateful that the Trump Administration has discussed the severity of this crisis, but their actions so far don‚Äôt match their words

Women in NH &amp; around the country deserve better than #Trumpcare, and I‚Äôll do everything I can to make sure it doesn't become reality.
And #Trumpcare attacks women‚Äôs health care by defunding Planned Parenthood, jeopardizing critical services for thousands of NH women.
It would end the requirement that insurance companies must cover essential health benefits ‚Äì including maternity care.
If you are a mother, giving birth could now be considered a pre-existing condition.

I will continue to fight back against this #Trumpcare bill and any attempt to undermine the rights of students with disabilities
The IDEA already lacks adequate funding, and #Trumpcare would make it worse
It is shameful that #Trumpcare would jeopardize the opportunity to fully participate in our society for Americans with disabilities
#Trumpcare‚Äôs reckless cuts to Medicaid include funding that schools depend on to serve students with disabilities

Important story from @NYTimes today on a little-noticed #Trumpcare provision targeting special education https://t.co/i1d5ta7FBT
I will do everything in my power to stop this #Trumpcare plan that would hurt Granite Staters and Americans
While undermining health care for hard-working Americans &amp; Granite Staters, #Trumpcare provides a massive tax cut for insurance company CEOs
#Trumpcare defunds @PPFA, which provides critical health services to women &amp; families
#Trumpcare cuts &amp; caps Medicaid, hurting nursing homes &amp; people who experience disabilities
Even if you get insurance from your employer, #Trumpcare could negatively impact your coverage
#Trumpcare ends Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the #1 tool to combat the heroin, fentanyl, and opioid crisis
Under #Trumpcare you could lose coverage for substance use disorder &amp; mental health treatment, maternity care, prescriptions, &amp; more
If you are between the ages of 50-65, #Trumpcare also imposes a new age tax
.@USCBO The last @USCBO score found #Trumpcare would raise premiums by average of 15-20%
Without a @USCBO, we don‚Äôt even know how much #Trumpcare would cost or how many millions could lose coverage
