@auntlellie @RepCummings @HouseDemocrats I used to be 100% pro choice.

@auntlellie @RepCummings @HouseDemocrats EXACTLY! Gosnell is just 1 abortion dr that got caught! They fraud the paperwork on these babies.

@mamakin72 @tsamspeedy Yw my friend! Since you are directly one of those that are affected. Your birth mom was couragous &amp; chose to give you life. Regardless of her reasons-she did a selfless thing &amp; chose to give you life-not destroy it. Thank God!  Thats to be celebrated! #UnbornLivesMatter ALWAYS!
@TaylorWorkman97 @tsamspeedy Exactly! Its a THEY issue. One is just as responsible as the other. Since Roe v Wade there have been 63,000,000+ abortions to date. On average in U.S. 900 abortions a day. If that amount was children that were born/grown that were murdered people would be outraged!
@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 I hold men just as accountable as women. It takes 2. But our society lets men off too easy when it comes to getting someone pregnant &amp; abandoning the woman with all the responsibilities. We arent a society that sterilizes ppl for that otherwise it could be said abt women too.
@TaylorWorkman97 @tsamspeedy Yes I agree. Its NOT just men that need to be more responsible-women too. Im not sure why we arent all coming together &amp; figuring out how to do better-I just KNOW in my heart murdering post born babies isnt working.
@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 K I C what Tamspeedy did-the republican fault? WIC IS available for low income women/children. welfare for single women with children &amp; BC pills too. Hows about holding the ppl accountable for THEIR actions-Men &amp; women? Its NOT the Govt responsibility for poor choices THEY made.
@TaylorWorkman97 @tsamspeedy Agree with you on ALL except if you would be throwing abortion in the mix. Accessible womens healthcare is pap smears, gyne exams, mammograms for healthcare or reproduction health. All the things you mentioned should be offered, accessible &amp; affordable for all women!
@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 I believe it takes 2 to make a baby. The responsibilty IS both peoples. Unless either are prepared to be parents either 1) use protection &amp; birth control. Never trust the other person unless you are certain tht there is always a chance to be pregnant.

@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 Whenever the heartbeat &amp; movement is detected. With most women it varies. Im definately NOT for post birth!
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 Nope-I didnt like it when Obama did it either. I think that they should build a bunch more detention centers they can be housed together as a family. Trumps asked for millions more to build more centers.
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 Ive thought about why they do it &amp; i feel bad for all that they live thru. BUT Mexico has offered all those in caravans assylum &amp; work &amp; they refuse &amp; still come. we have to take away ALL free incentetives to stop it. They are bringing diseases &amp; other things in we dont have.
@mamakin72 @tsamspeedy Mamakin-its ok we got u. Sorry, i thnk she has kids &amp; is pro-choice. Itd be my guess shes never watched a live abortion to know what barbaric procedures they do. Out of site-out of mind!
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 I am concerned abt illegal children &amp; why the parents would put them in such a dangerous situation as to let kids travel by themselves &amp; get raped, murdered or abused along the way. Or put little ones thru that. A legal citizen did that to their kids theyd be charged &amp; jailed.
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 Pro-life &amp; pro-birth. The extreme Pro-Choice ppl wanna be the Judge, Jury &amp; Executioner on what baby gets to live or die a horrible abortion death. I guess they dont think a parent or adult should be punished for killing an infant or child if its after the mother gave birth.
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 I cant control ages of children people want to adopt. Why dont you look into why their are so many in Foster care? Like maybe 98% are their because their parents abused them-sexually/ physically or didnt wnt them. Lotsa parents hav multiple kids in fostercare. They keep havin em
@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 Im NOT chosing to ignore any children at the border. My tax $s go toward housing them while their parents are processed. I didnt like the seperation &amp; cages when Obama did it. I think they should be housed together-we should build bigger centers so they can be detained together.
@tsamspeedy I dont choose anything	 Caring for children is in my heart as a human being-unborn/born. Ive worked at Dept of Child Serv for my State &amp; have seen abuse of babies, toddlers, grade schoolers &amp; teens. Ive worked in Residential Facilities for teens. ALL children ARE worth saving!
@TaylorWorkman97 @tsamspeedy Ok so after consideration of the situation i was in &amp; i didnt want children or anymore, if i already had some--&amp; if I was far enough a long that I could hear the heartbeat &amp; it was moving &amp; formed then I would decide that I should have it &amp; give it up for adoption.

@thelolaandbea @sxdoc I think they already have begun their infiltration.
@mamakin72 @tsamspeedy Agree that #TruthTriggers. Those of us that are pro life- "choose" to use our voices to speak for the innocent babies that cant use their voices to 	"chose life."...funny those of us fighting for the unborn/born to live are ridiculed. 🤔👇 https://t.co/2km3Jks6PH
@tsamspeedy I cant debate with u any further on whether babies born be murdered-its too exhausting &amp; its apparent you are for it.   I used to be just like you &amp; was pro choice until I actually watched an abortion &amp; saw how the babies limbs were ripped from their bodies &amp; skulls crushed! 😭👣
@mamakin72 @tsamspeedy Amazes me tht woman that have children &amp; could agree with Infantcide.  My 1st was premature born at 7 1/2 months pregnancy. She weighed 3 lbs 10 1/2 lbs. Her head was littlier than the palm of my hand &amp; was perfectly formed. A miracle! 👣
@tsamspeedy @TaylorWorkman97 I had a CHOICE to hav my kids &amp; not murder them. I also made a CHOICE to get steralized (Womens Reproductive Choice) after I had gotten pregnant twice while on BC. I made the CHOICE to make sure that it didnt happen again. I was poor/couldnt afford kids but I CHOSE life 4 them.
@AmyMachen @reflexionar29 Lol I can only shake my head in disbelief.
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 Not biased opinion peice...just FACTS! Funny how the dem socialist always want to protect the all the illegal alien children that come through borders &amp; want to save them all but say nothing about it being legal to murder  newborn babies. 🤔
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 I worked in Child Services-seen abused cases of children. majority of abused/killed were by their own parents or the moms boyfriend (mom knew it was happening). They carried them &amp; gave birth anyway-should of given them up for adoption at birth! They keep having kids.
@tsamspeedy @mamakin72 Her birth mom atleast made the choice to carry her &amp; then give her up &amp; give her the RIGHT to life.  There are Hundreds of 1000s of people wanting to adopt babies. If  the mom cant take care of  baby &amp; doesnt want it-then carry it, give birth &amp; give it up to someone else who does
@mamakin72 @tsamspeedy Thats awesome you were adopted &amp; both of you saved each other! I have 1000% more respect for someone that got pregnant &amp; gave the baby up for adoption than chosing to murder it. Its got to be harder for a mother to give her baby up for adoption than for one that aborts it!

@LC_ALIPaC10 Exactly right! The Democrats Socialist &amp; Muslims want to take over America since 1950's or before! Their plan has always been to get here then infiltrate our govt by elections to Congress then pass laws benefiting Muslims &amp; change our Constition &amp; Courts  to Sharia Law.
@8cf87893bdc7454 @sxdoc Exactly! Christians would be killed doing this in Middle East.

@USCFaninNC You're prob right. Maybe they did it in public to try &amp; get someone to say something about it so they can claim they are racist against Muslim. I dont care abt someones religion or how they practice it-i dont think it should be there considering the large amount of ppl.
@yashuaforlife @ReneeCarrollAZ 👍agree. There are MANY places private that this can be done.
@dolly_ste @HeartbtsforQ Ty. I dont mind anyone practicing their religion-but im thinking there are probably less public places to practice in where it wont disrupt the rest of the public.

@TaylorWorkman97 @tsamspeedy Yes-I am a woman-I have all the reproductive parts. There HAS to be limits on when the fetus can be terminated. Abortions will ALWAYS be previlent &amp; it has to be safe but there HAS to be limits on the time!
@tsamspeedy Woman of Roe v Wade case-chose adoption. uon. says "Its worst mistake she ever made" &amp; spends all her time as pro life advocate trying to get it over turned.
@tsamspeedy Roe v Wade wont be overturned because abortion will never be gone! HAS to b limits on preg stage it can be done=once fetus has heartbeat &amp; organs!  it has been proven they CAN feel pain when clamps are ripping off their body parts or they have been burned by the chemicals.
@tsamspeedy I am a woman. I AM for giving woman the right to her Choice of Birth Control products/her choice to have sex or not! Im for Planned Parenthood providing at low cost products. I will support up to 4 weeks abortion at expense of woman

@tsamspeedy U are very misinformed. There are Social programs for New Borns like WIC =Women, Infant &amp; Children. Theres Child Services that we have Foster Care all over the Nation that helps babies--especially when the mother did drugs while pregnant &amp; baby was deformed &amp; addicted.

@tsamspeedy Its my 2A right to have/own guns since I'm legal/abide all laws to have rights to gun ownership. If I break laws my rights are taken...ALL citizens are supposed to be guaranteed Life, Liberty &amp; pursuit of happiness...just NOT the unborn.
@tsamspeedy Your argument is not valid. NRA is a National Membership &amp; does NOT kill babies born/unborn. A PERSON is guilty of killing ppl/Children. NRA doesnt pull the trigger. PP physically Murders infants = 63,000,000+ babies LEGALLY murdered since Roe v Wade.
