Then I wondered what it would be like if any time any of us heard a sexist/racist/homophobic remark, we gently stopped it dead in its tracks. Imagine how much language we could change that way. It was clear that this man had never heard that p‚Äî-y was an unacceptable word.
Instead, I intereupted him by touching his arm and saying: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not use that word anymore.‚Äù He said ‚ÄúAh, okay. i was acting like a wimp.‚Äù And then he continued. I keep thinking about this interaction. At first I wondered if I handled it the right way.

Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination should be as big a concern for every male in this country as it is for every woman. Rape is a crime committed by men so lets stop making it a women‚Äôs issue.
With a 1% conviction rate, there is rarely justice. Anyone giving character references about a rapist because he was ‚Äúnice to me‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt rape me‚Äù is offering patently useless information and serving as a major distraction from the truth.
This is the equivalent of the ‚Äúletter from 65 female classmates‚Äù saying Kavanaugh treated women with ‚Äúdecency and respect.‚Äù A murderer doesn‚Äôt murder everyone. A rapist doesn‚Äôt rape all women.  64 percent of murderers are convicted. 1 percent of rapists are convicted.
Imagine if there was a man accused of murder and his high school classmates wrote a letter saying that in all the time they knew him, this man never murdered them.  How irrelevant would their testimony be?
