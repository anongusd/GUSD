The difference between the Trump Presidency and the Nixon Presidency is the Trump's ego will prevent him from resigning, meaning instead of having a garbage truck come pick up the garbage, we will get to witness a complete dumpster fire in real-time!		It will be amazing!!
Devin Nunes once called Stephen Colbert's jokes about him a 'Danger' to this country.		I call Devin Nunes a danger to this country.
Dear America,		Trump is only going to get worse before this all gets better.  As more and more people turn on him, he will increasingly use his Executive Power to try and undermine our government. He isn't on America's side!  He's on his own side! 		Save Democracy!	IMPEACH TRUMP!
While everyone is focusing on who Democrats should run in 2020 to unseat Donald Trump, let's keep in mind that in 2020, the Senate seats of Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) and Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) are also up for grabs.		Let's vote out @LindseyGrahamSC and @senatemajldr
Next Rudy Giuliani will claim that "Trump broke the law, but the law was wrong".		Mark my words!  It's coming!
Melania Trump said she's working to "support the well-being of children everywhere ."		If this is the case, then why don't you fly down to the border, walk into the child jails, and personally reunited every child separated from their parents by your inhumane husband?

@realDonaldTrump Illegal emolument violations by our President.
@realDonaldTrump Illegal child separation by our President!
@realDonaldTrump Senate Republicans are taking BOLD ACTION.  They are about to vote down your National Emergency.
@realDonaldTrump Trump has already hurt our country.  Democrats must impeach.
@realDonaldTrump I think the North Korea summit was intended to distract America from the Cohen testimony.
@realDonaldTrump Wasn’t the Cohen testimony scheduled before North Korea?
@realDonaldTrump The North Korean summit was not important.  You did nothing but embarrass America.  If anything it distracted the world from your embarrassment.
I love how people ask me "How many illegal immigrants are you taking into your home?"		I then ask them "How many homeless American veterans are you taking into your home?"		That shuts them up every time.

If you still don't think Don Jr. will be indicted, you have been living under a rock.
Trump still has not made a single tweet about the election fraud in North Carolina which has resulted in a new election, and the Republican candidate stepping aside after his campaign appears to be behind the fraud.
Incase you missed it, listen to Lindsey Graham's likely 2020 opponent rip into Graham in the most spectacular fashion! Listen now:	https://t.co/XkUHUYTCrd	https://t.co/V7nxgEcKPp
Trump called the Mueller probe "bullsh-t" during his CPAC speech. Let's all remember that Mueller has thrown several criminals behind bars.		Don't ever tell me that Trump is a pro-law-enforcement President.  Every time he attacks Mueller, he is attacking the Rule of Law.
Who makes this stuff? https://t.co/xlE8pZbmUk
Let's all remember that Donald Trump once admitted to sexually assaulting women.  Somehow people are ignoring this fact!
Trump talking about renewable energy at CPAC: "When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric."		Dear Mr. Trump, please Google "batteries."		YES, he is that stupid!
@realDonaldTrump Don’t say that nothing has been “proven.” You’re campaign has several members in prison for crimes.
@realDonaldTrump Give up with the book already.  You’ve literally tweeted this 5 times already.
@realDonaldTrump Presidential harassment is what you did when you claimed Obama was born in Kenya.
@AOC And Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women.  I’m pretty sure I’d take someone who drives cars before someone who assaults women, any day.
Regardless of legality, let's make one thing clear:		Don Jr. literally signed a check for a porn star, to help his dad hide the fact that he cheated on his stepmom right after the birth of his half-brother, and years after he had raped his mom, Ivana.		Traditional Family Values!

There is no reason for anyone not to support the release of Trump's tax returns unless you are afraid to admit that you may have been supporting a criminal all along.
Nancy Pelosi is not only an example of a strong woman, but she's a terrific example of someone who will not let a bully push her around. Trump has met his match and it's in the form of a 78 year old Grandma who is stronger, more intelligent and braver than he.		Thank you Nancy!
Trump has called women horsefaces, losers, nasty, dogs, lowlifes, bimbos, &amp; chubby. 		He even claimed he could have "nailed" Princess Diana, and bragged about grabbing women by the private parts.		Now, a strong woman, Nancy Pelosi, has grabbed Trump by his ego and he is helpless!
Republicans:		- It's wrong to use taxpayer dollars to give people healthcare.		- It's wrong to use taxpayer dollars to give elderly people meals on wheels.		- It's our duty to use taxpayer dollars to build a wall that experts say won't work.		Where are your priorities?

@realDonaldTrump Why are you attacking Cohen for “lying” when his lies were exactly the same as your lies?
@realDonaldTrump A book is not written under oath.  You can’t use it as proof of a lie.  If that was the case, “Art of the Deal” would send you to prison for life.
@realDonaldTrump You have lied to America 8000+ times so far.  Why don’t you testify under oath?
@realDonaldTrump You are confusing love and loyalty.
@realDonaldTrump I’m pretty sure you’ve never received a “love letter” in your life.
@realDonaldTrump He worked for you for over a decade.  I thought you only hire the best people.
3 Ways that Trump Presidency Ends:		- He stays in office and if voted out in 2020, at which point he is immediately indicted - 70% chance	- He agrees to resign to avoid prosecution of himself or his children - 20% chance.	- He is impeached, thrown from office, and indicted - 10%
When Hillary was President, I encouraged investigation because I wanted to know the truth.		If you can support Trump, yet not give a crap whether or not he is conspiring with a foreign adversary or if he is corrupt, you are not a "patriot!"
Imagine how screwed this country would be if Republicans would had won the House in 2018.  Hillary Clinton would be testifying right now instead of Michael Cohen and perhaps Don Jr.		This is why EVERY VOTE COUNTS!
Trump announced a new executive order that could take funding from colleges if they don't support free speech.  Can he also sign an order that strips a president of his presidency if he doesn't support free speech?

Trump calls the world "mean &amp; nasty"		I've traveled to 16 countries and have yet to meet this world that he refers to.		The world is very loving.		If people are 'mean &amp; nasty' to you, it's likely because you treat them poorly		People won't show you love when all you do is hate!
President Trump should be INDICTED!		An indictment would sent a precedent for all future presidents, letting them know that they can't use the office of the presidency to commit crimes and get away with them.		Who's with me on this?
If you paint your face black to mock an African American, you should RESIGN.		If you joke about mass genocide of an entire race, you should RESIGN!		If you sexually assault a woman, you should RESIGN!		Stop defending these disgusting actions and start defending AMERICA!
Hillary Clinton loses emails and Republicans chant “Lock her up”.		Donald Trump loses children and Republicans chant “Four More Years”.		If you still don’t think that this is some sort of sick, twisted cult, maybe it’s time to reevaluate your priorities as Americans.

@realDonaldTrump You weren’t misinterpreted.  You were interpreted exactly the way you spoke.
@realDonaldTrump When you said “America First,” what you really meant was “Trump First.”
@realDonaldTrump You should be ashamed of yourself.  Stop putting American Intel behind Putin and Jong Un.

@BillKristol Now the real question is, did Trump ask him to do it?  Gaetz needs to be called to testify under oath.

@gtconway3d George you should listen to John Gartner’s diagnosis of Trump. https://t.co/kvLIorGD1Q
The great thing about Matt Gaetz intimidating Michael Cohen, isn’t the fact that Gaetz might end up in prison.  It’s the fact that he can now be pressured to testify against Trump.
We need more Republicans like Alexander https://t.co/LuvIzzPcer
Let's clarify one thing. When it comes to Trump, it doesn't matter if you believe Michael Cohen's testimony or not.  It matters if you believe the hard evidence that he is supplying to the SDNY &amp; Mueller.  They aren't building a case based on hearsay.		Hard evidence doesn't lie!
After hearing what Michael Cohen said on Wednesday, this doesn't surprise me one bit. https://t.co/XLjXVYnT5p
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden You have good things to say about Biden because Biden is a good person.  		Democrats have nothing good to say about Trump because Trump is not a good person.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP John McCain is a hero.  Democrats have said a lot of nice things about Republicans when those Republicans act in America's best interest. There is NOTHING nice to say about President Trump.
@AOC Republicans call you "Radical."	We call you "Refreshing."
If the same Republicans who are so concerned over whether Michael Cohen lied to Congress were just as concerned over the fact that Donald Trump has lied to the American people 8000+ times, America would be a much better place.
@AOC I can't wait to hear Don Jr. testify under oath again.  I hope many Democrats on the Oversight Committee yield their time to you.
I'm beginning to think that the Mueller probe should be the least of Trump's concerns.  Trump, Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric need to be scared most of the SDNY investigation.	https://t.co/FJsMZsHiDc
@realDonaldTrump It's as if you have no understanding of the law, or the law simply doesn't matter to you.		In the end, the RULE OF LAW will win!  I promise!
@realDonaldTrump I am sure that if you testified under oath, and you were asked about your 8000 lies that you have told the American people, your testimony would contradict these lies as well.

@SallyQYates What’s most dangerous is the fact that an entire political party doesn’t care.
@realDonaldTrump Care to tell America what those 11 checks were for?  How about why you had Cohen send letters to all of your schools, demanding that they no release your grades or SAT scores?  Something to hide?
@realDonaldTrump The great thing is, that most of the things that Republicans are accusing Cohen of lying about, will be corroborated by other witnesses or hard evidence, such as checks, letters, and more.
@realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen was convicted of lying based on the same lies you told to the American People.  If you are going to call him a liar, then you are in the same boat.  You are both liars, but Michael Cohen no longer has a reason to lie.  You do!
@realDonaldTrump You literally bid on a auction with a fake bidder in order to use charitable donations to the Trump Foundation to buy a picture of yourself in order to make it appear as though your picture is more valuable than anyone else's.  This is a crime!!

@realDonaldTrump Russia Collusion has NOT fallen apart, just because Michael Cohen doesn't have proof of it.  Wait until Robert Mueller releases his report.  You will be eating your words.

@realDonaldTrump You, Mr. Trump, are a walking, talking, contradictory machine!
@realDonaldTrump You have lied 8000+ times.  Why don't you testify under oath so that we can ask you all about them?
@realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen didn't "go rogue"  He went from the dark side to the good side.
@realDonaldTrump Is this "love letter" similar to the "love letter" that you got from Kim Jong Un?
@realDonaldTrump What the hell are you talking about?
@realDonaldTrump Once again Kim Jong Un was given the world stage, just what he wanted, and he didn’t have to give up anything in return.

If you take one thing from Michael Cohen's testimony today, let it be that there is confirmation of hard evidence that Donald Trump is a criminal, and that Mueller and the SDNY have access to it.		Sleep tight in Vietnam, Donny boy!
The same Republicans who refuse to believe Michael Cohen’s testimony are the ones listening to every crazy thing coming out of the mouth of Alex Jones. 		I call that hypocrisy and insanity.
Here's a reminder to all Republicans discrediting Cohen today:		Michael Cohen was the finance chair for the RNC even after everyone knew that he had lied to Congress about the Trump Tower Deal.		You believed him then, so why don't you believe him now?
RT @h0llyb4xter: Breakdown of what's happened so far at the Michael Cohen testimony by @krassenstein argues that Republicans are definitely…
5 Things we learned today:	● Republicans don't care about the truth.	● Michael Cohen has evidence that Trump committed crimes.	● The SDNY is investigating things they don't want Cohen speaking publicly on.	● Jim Jordan really is that ignorant.	● Trump is in big trouble!
Looks Like the Apple Doesn’t Fall Far From the Tree! https://t.co/gQbIMK1UK8
The only difference between Jim Jordan and Michael Cohen is that Michael Cohen is apologetic for the lies he told to protect a sexual predator in the Oval Office, while Jim Jordan is not apologetic for the lies he told to help protect sexual predators at Ohio State University.
Michael Cohen just confirmed that the Trump Foundation used charitable donations for Trump's personal gains on multiple occasions.		Trump literally was taking money being donated to good causes to benefit himself.  		Not only is this criminal, but it's outright DISGUSTING!
Can @AOC please just ask Michael Cohen all of the question for the Democrats?
Michael Cohen just implicated Donald Trump Jr. in an apparent criminal conspiracy.  		Yes, Donald Trump's kids are involved in the crime family!
Thoughts and Prayers Matt Gaetz!	https://t.co/Iz83Clm94R
@imandyhaynes We are actually planning one.  Will you write it for us?
Jim Jordan is the Jacob Wohl of Republican Congressmen.
With the Michael Cohen testimony on recess, I highly suggest everyone take some time to listen to an epic interview with Lindsey Graham's likely 2020 Democratic opponent Jaime Harrison, who complete unloads on the Senator. 	https://t.co/XkUHUYTCrd	https://t.co/V7nxgEcKPp
It's time to send Roger Stone to jail! https://t.co/A9V7riZUWg
Michael Cohen just said that Donald Trump has asked him to threaten people over 500 times.  		500 times!	500 times!	500 times!
Here we go!  A million Republicans are simultaneously tweeting, "See, Michael Cohen was never in Prague," after he tells the House Committee that he has not.		These are the same Republicans who have been claiming all day that we should not trust anything that Michael Cohen says.
Who gives a crap if Michael Cohen gets a book or movie deal? Don't Republicans realize that Cohen would get much more money for a book or movie deal if the public didn't already hear from him in this testimony? People buy books to learn stuff, not to hear what they already heard.
There is, without a doubt, hard evidence that President Trump committed Campaign Finance crimes, and you don't need to believe Michael Cohen's word to see that.  There are 11 checks that prove this beyond a reasonable doubt.		The President of the United States belongs in prison.
@LindseyGrahamSC In 2015 did you say:		"[Trump] is shallow, he is ill-prepared to be commander in chief. He doesn’t know what he is talking about in terms of how our laws work.”
@LindseyGrahamSC In 2016, did you tweet:		"“If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed……and we will deserve it.”"
@LindseyGrahamSC In 2016, did you tweet:		“Donald Trump is not a conservative Republican. He’s an opportunist. He’s not fit to be President of the United States.”
@LindseyGrahamSC Another question for Lindsey Graham:	In 2016, did you say the GOP “should have kicked Trump out of the party,” based on his ideas of forced deportation of hispanics, saying, “This is not about who we nominate anymore as Republicans as much as it’s who we are?"
@LindseyGrahamSC A question for Lindsey Graham:		Did you say in 2015 that Trump is a “race-baiting xenophobic bigot?"
WOW!  Michael Cohen will not speak about his conversations with Trump after his office was raided because it’s part of an ongoing investigation by the SDNY!		The entire Trump family should be scared of what the SDNY has on them.
Not that it’s hard to do, but Michael Cohen has successfully made Jim Jordan look like the coward he has always been.		You are no hero Michael Cohen, but when you speak to Jim Jordan, he certainly makes you look like one.
BOOM!	Michael Cohen just said that Trump submitted inflated financial documents to a bank in order to receive more loans.		The DOJ refers to this as BANK FRAUD!
You can claim that Michael Cohen is lying all you want but hard evidence like this doesn't lie! https://t.co/wuQ7eEKR8k
WOW!  Debbie Wasserman Schultz just got Michael Cohen to seemingly implicate Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric Trump in potential misconduct.  		The whole Trump family is in trouble!
Michael Cohen just crushed Jim Jordan!		I guarantee you Trump is crying in his hotel room right now!
Jim Jordan just thought he was clever in questioning a statement that Michael Cohen made, and it completely backfired on him.  Instead of implicating just Donald Trump, Cohen said he made threats to protect Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric Trump as well.		Nice going Jim Jordan!
@realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen: "Donald Trump is a racist!"		He says you asked him "to name a country not run by a black person that is not a 'sh-thole'"
@realDonaldTrump Cohen literally heard you speaking to Roger Stone about WikiLeaks' dump of Hillary's emails.  Looks like someone is in trouble, and it's not me!
@realDonaldTrump It's more exciting in Washington where Michael Cohen is letting all of your secrets out of the bag.		Rep Elijah Cummings: "The days of this committee protecting the President at all, are over!"
@realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen literally has letters written for you threatening your colleges not to release your grades or SAT scores.  He also has a check that you gave him while President to pay off Stormy Daniels.  Try calling hard evidence a lie.  Go ahead!
@realDonaldTrump You should turn on CNN and watch Cohen call you a racist conman.  It's awesome!
@realDonaldTrump We are having a better time at home watching Michael Cohen tell all of your horrific stories!
Dear Jim Jordan,		Please sit down and shut up so that we can just hear Michael Cohen already! No one wants to hear your obnoxious voice!
BOOM:  Rep Elijah Cummings: "The days of this committee protecting the President at all, are over!"		Finally, America gets to see the truth.  Thank you @RepCummings and Thank you @DNC #CohenTestimony
Watching Rep Elijah Cummings shut down Trump-lackey Mark Meadows' attempt to postpone the Michael Cohen testimony, proves to us that times have changed.		Democrats are now in control, meaning the truth actually gets to come out for once.		Get used to it @GOP!

Well this is quite damning for Trump's narrative that he never knew about the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russians. https://t.co/PzgKbhzHdd
Let's be clear.  President Trump attacked Senator Blumenthal today for his lack of service in Vietnam, because he knows that Michael Cohen is going to drop a bombshell that Trump himself never actually had bone spurs.
"While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood,	[Trump] commented that only black people could live that way. He told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid." -- #CohenTestimony		Read it all at:	https://t.co/3RmCPytt2E
Michael Cohen:  "Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1.  For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump"
"Pro-Life" should mean more than just protecting fetuses.		It should include standing up to enemies who kill our journalists.		It should include keeping children with their families, not tearing them apart!		It should mean protecting lives from gun violence!		Who's with me?

@realDonaldTrump Can 2020 just get here already so that we can vote you and your Republican colleagues in the Senate out of office?  We need real leadership.
@realDonaldTrump That's a huge "IF".  North Korea might say they will denuclearize, but we can't simply take Kim Jong Un's word for it.  You might think that communicating with Jong Un is in our best interest but all he wants is the world stage.
It's hilarious that the GOP is celebrating the fact that Michael Cohen has been disbarred. He has been disbarred because of unethical things he did while he was President Trump's attorney and Financial Chairman of the RNC.		The GOP is literally attacking themselves!
Stay tuned, @krassenstein and I have a bombshell Jacob Wohl story breaking in about an hour.
@5280_native @krassenstein Something else
Jacob Wohl May have broken federal law.  @krassenstein and I are investigating something very serious.

@realDonaldTrump There are times when not having an abortion means a woman might lose her life.  There also times when if a woman gives birth the baby won’t survive.  This is when Democrats support late term abortion and this is ONLY when they do.
@realDonaldTrump No, Democrats voted for protecting the lives of women.
@realDonaldTrump You either don’t know anything about abortion, or you do and you are creating a fake narrative in order to inappropriately demonize Democrats.
@realDonaldTrump Stop spreading your rhetoric.  Democrats support women’s rights to live when giving birth puts their life in danger.
@realDonaldTrump Abortion is not “extreme” when it is done to save a woman’s life.

Trump's ridiculous claim that Spike Lee is "racist" is just him trying to distract from Michael Cohen telling the world just how racist he has actually been over the years, when he testifies in front of Congress this week.
@realDonaldTrump @DJohnsonPGA Only if you cared as much about the children being separated at the border as you do with golf.
A question that more of the media should be asking:		Why the hell hasn't any of President Trump's White House medical checks shown that he has bone spurs?
@Pattyfalino Yes but not this week.
There are a lot of rumors swirling that Donald Trump Jr. will be arrested this week.		These are JUST rumors, being propagated by those who want to get the media to bite, and then be discredited.  I won't mention names, but there are a few individuals behind this.

@realDonaldTrump I like how you timed your meeting with North Korea to coincide with Michael Cohen's public testimony.  Trying to distract America from hearing the truth?		IT WON'T WORK!
@realDonaldTrump While you are at the meeting, please ask the governors of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona what their thoughts are on your FAKE National Emergency.  I guarantee you, they will say it's not an emergency.
@coachriclark @thereald0tt @realDonaldTrump @AOC #1) Yes, oil prices have a huge impact on our economy, but it's not up to the President to control oil supply by pressuring OPEC.	#2) If we focused on green technology, what OPEC does with oil wouldn't matter any longer.	#3) The Green New Deal is about economic.  Read it!
Keep an eye on Venezuela. Trump isn't sending Humanitarian Aid because he's a good person.  If that was the case, he wouldn't be tearing children from their mothers' arms when they arrive to America from one of Venezuela's neighbors. 		He's sending aid because he has an agenda.
@realDonaldTrump @AOC We need a President that understands that this country's future isn't in oil and coal.  We need to become the leaders of green technology.  Solar, Wind, etc.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you actually paid some attention to the Green New Deal from @AOC, you wouldn't have to worry so much about what the hell OPEC is doing.
@realDonaldTrump You are not the President of OPEC.  You have no say in what OPEC does.

@realDonaldTrump Why can’t we see the progress?  Why are farmers still hurting?
If you are mad because Amy Klobuchar eats her salad with a comb, but are perfectly fine with President Trump forcing breastfeeding mothers to feed their babies chewed up burritos, then you are the very definition of a hypocrite. https://t.co/HaEdSjGjoo
There has not been a single Trump tweet condemning the huge Sex Trafficking bust in Florida last week.		This is just as horrific as any sex trafficking that takes place over the southern border.
@GobAbiertoBOL I’m all for subpoenaing anyone who appears to have information. We all should want the truth.
@ScottFantasy @realDonaldTrump I’m not paid, are you?
I vote to rename 4th of July, 'Robert Mueller Day,' and allow @Rosie to read Mueller Indictments from America's favorite Special Counsel.
@SenFeinstein Can we just admit that some sort of investigation is needed here?  	1- Trump was good friends with Epstein. 	2- Trump was accused of sexual misconduct at Epstein’s parties. 	3- Acosta let Epstein off.	4- Acosta becomes Trump’s labor Secretary.

BOOM!	Republican Governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem told Politico that, "South Dakota has been devastated by the trade wars that are going on."		One by one, more and more Republicans are realizing that Trump is a scamming piece of orange garbage.
GOP consultant Alex Castellanos Just said that Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are trying to win the "Obama black primary.”		Why do these Republicans need to make everything about race?  Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are Presidential candidates, just like their white counterparts!
Imagine if Barack Obama had appointed a Labor Secretary who had illegally worked out a sweetheart deal with his buddy, who was a pedophile, allowing him to get away with serial sexual abuse and rape.		Republicans would have impeached him in a matter of seconds.

@realDonaldTrump Hillary was investigated for 6 years.  Give up already.  You know what Mueller will find and you kniw that your only way out is to make Hillary look guilty too.
@realDonaldTrump You are like a broken record.  You have a guilty conscience so like always blame Hillary for things that you did.

@realDonaldTrump Maybe you need to start looking at the REAL polls rather than the Rasmussen polls that are obviously biased.
@realDonaldTrump @KatiePavlich Just because you tweet that women are coming back to the Republican party, it doesn't make it actually happen.  Just like when you tweeted that your campaign had nothing to do with Russia.
@realDonaldTrump @KatiePavlich The vast majority of women don't support you, not just because of your immorality, but also because you admitted publicly that you like to "grab women by the p--sy."

@gtconway3d George, Please come on @KrassenCast.
Not only is Trump destroying the meaning of President's Day, but now he's trying to sabotage the 4th of July.		The next President needs to write an executive order that annuls Trump's presidency so that we can get back to honoring those who deserve to be honored.
@GeorgePapa19 My only question is, 'How do you know that there was never any collusion,' if Trump says you were 'just the coffee boy?'
@realDonaldTrump The solution to fixing North Korea, isn't giving them money.  The government would just take all of the money for themselves like they do right now.
@realDonaldTrump Chairman Kim just wants to be on the World Stage with America.  He wants to feel important, and that's exactly what you are giving him.  It's as if you are blind when it comes to leadership and foreign policy.
@realDonaldTrump And is that why he refuses to give them up?  Are you really this ignorant?
@realDonaldTrump These are evil men, who don't deserve the respect you are giving them.  What ever happened to "being tough?"  You are a coward in the way you lead.
@realDonaldTrump No one should have a "great relationship" with a man who is a murderous dictator!  You should be condemning him like you should be condemning Putin!
@realDonaldTrump You are stating the obvious.  You are like a kindergartener trying to solve a nuclear weapons crisis.
@realDonaldTrump When you say our "favorite president" will be at your celebration, does that mean that Barack Obama will be speaking?
@realDonaldTrump And we don't want your "A Salute to America" celebration.  We already have Independence Day.  You are literally a slap in the face to our forefathers.  You are trying to give our independence away to Russia.
@realDonaldTrump The only progress that should be deemed "progress" should be an agreement by North Korea to destroy all of their Nuclear Weapons and allow weapons inspectors into the country to make sure they hold this promise.  Anything else is just more rhetoric.
Sorry President Trump, the date of July 4th is already saved to honor our independence as a nation.		Any celebration outside of that is an insult to our forefathers, especially considering the fact that your campaign surrendered our independence to Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Here is an idea.  Hold the celebration but let Barack Obama give the address.  He would better represent of our country.
@realDonaldTrump Just admit it.  You want to hold a celebration of "DONALD TRUMP."  If you really cared about our military, you would respect men like John McCain and Robert Mueller, who have been military heroes, and you'd do something about all of the homeless veterans.
@realDonaldTrump And how much money will this cost Tax-payers?	Would this be considered just as much "socialism" as using tax dollars to help pay for college or healthcare?

Congress needs to subpoena Trump's labor secretary Alex Acosta and question him about his illegal deal to let Jeffrey Epstein off the hook for sexually assaulting underaged girls, and find out if that had anything to do with his appointment by Trump.
@JimCarrey I hope this case can be reopened and they can investigate all of the “VIPs” as well, no matter who they are.
@realDonaldTrump If you are so insistent that you didn’t do anything illegal, how about making us all a deal?  If Mueller shows evidence that you broke the law, then you resign!
@realDonaldTrump Wait until the SDNY comes after you too.  You already broke campaign finance laws.  I would consider that “wrong”.
@realDonaldTrump Wait until Mueller releases his report.  See if that’s still accurate then.  I doubt it.
Why is it that when @AOC wants to use govenment funds to build up Green Technology, to benefit us all, Republicans call it "socialism," but when Trump gives American farmers $7.7 billion of tax payer money, to pay for his stupid tariff mistake, Republicans remain silent?
@Moxiesmg I have nothing to hide.
ANOTHER GOP LOSS!		A North Carolina judge has ruled that an amendment to require a voter ID is "unconstitutional," based on the fact that the state's legislature was "illegally constituted," based on racial gerrymandering!		Thank you North Carolina!
If Trump really cared about sex trafficking, instead of focusing on his stupid wall, he would be focusing on firing Alex Acosta immediately for letting a sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein off the hook, and he would condemn his friend (Epstein) for his heinous actions.

@SarahWFin I’ve never claimed Mueller was going to do anything on a certain day.

BREAKING: Republican Congressional candidate Mark Harris just told the NC State Board of Elections that he believes a new election is warranted, after it appears that members of his campaign took part in election fraud.
@realDonaldTrump @KrassenCast Beto supports the 2nd Amendment too.  He just doesn't support people being able to purchase guns without background checks.  What makes more sense to you?
@realDonaldTrump I dare you to listen to the latest episode of @KrassenCast with O'Rourke's former Campaign Manager and walk away not believing that O'Rourke would be a much better President then yourself! https://t.co/BHn6EaeSpx
@realDonaldTrump I prefer Beto O'Rourke!

Remember when Trump tweeted that video of a wall being built this morning?		Turns out it was actually a video of renovations being made to walls which have been up for years.		Once a liar, always a liar.	Once a cheater, always a cheater.	Once a Trump, always a Trump!
Without a doubt! https://t.co/26d1ivtaSQ
If you are enraged at Jussie Smollett for staging a horrific attack but are perfectly fine with Russia staging an election, your views are one sided.

@JimCarrey Jim, Please come on @KrassenCast
@CodyHarris0901 @PH1LLy_Phan @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Nice try!		"I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides.”		"You had some very bad people in that group. You also had some very fine people on both sides.”
Trump ally @JamesOKeefeIII tried to spy on and then lie about @BetoORourke and all he did was prove that Beto is a good person and that James O’Keefe is a immoral fool.  https://t.co/9CF3zb3NT7
@PH1LLy_Phan @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Yes, that is correct and Trump called the White Supremacists "very fine people."  See the difference?  See the double standard?
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett What Jussie Smollett did was wrong, but you only call people out when they do stuff against you.
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett What about James O’Keefe and his fake news antics. https://t.co/9CF3zb3NT7
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett What about the White Supremacists who killed a girl in Charlottesville who you never condemned?
@BillOReilly So I guess this is you admitting that Trump didn't actually "Make America Great Again."
BREAKING: Chicago PD Superintendent Eddie Johnson just began his press conference about Jussie Smollett by saying, "As I look out into the crowd, I just wish that the families of gun violence in the city got this much attention."		Thank you for saying what we are all thinking!

@realDonaldTrump This isn't a "WALL."  It's a fence.  You promised a concrete/rebar wall.  This is not it!
@realDonaldTrump Where is the money for these renovations coming from?  Is there a check form Mexico somewhere?
@realDonaldTrump This isn't "YOUR WALL."  They have been putting up physical barriers along the border and renovating them since 1990.  Nice try in tricking your base to believe that you are upholding your promise.
@realDonaldTrump Your tweet seems to do nothing but help make a case for the Green New Deal.  Maybe you should call up @AOC and start a real conversation with her.  She has some excellent ideas.
@realDonaldTrump Here is an idea:  Become the leader in green technology.  Green tech is the future.  Let's move away from coal and oil and move toward solar, wind and other modern technologies!
@realDonaldTrump Here is a reminder that the repeal of #NetNeutrality allows corporations to slow users internet speeds. Corporations can now slow or block access to websites, applications and services.
@realDonaldTrump Instead of spending $8 billion on a Fake National Emergency, how about focusing on using that type of money on rebuilding some of our outdated technological infrastructure?
@realDonaldTrump At the same time though, you killed off net neutrality meaning that large corporations can control internet speeds for the rest of us.  Maybe you should think twice about that one.
@realDonaldTrump I agree, and all Americas, rich or poor should have access to these high internet speeds.  There is no reason why only the wealthy should get access.

@8igblue Show me one article by the mainstream media that reports it as fact.  Waiting.....
No one is to blame for actor Jussie Smollett's actions but himself. The media isn't to blame, and neither is the Resistance.		Just because the media reported his allegations, that doesn't make them less "credible".  It's their job!

@realDonaldTrump Anyone who joins ISIS should not be allowed back into America.  That's a decision you make.  		The same is true for White Supremacists who attack minorities.		I only wish that Trump would stand up to Domestic Terrorist as he does with international terrorism.

If Nick Sandmann can sue the Washington Post for $250 million, then that would mean that President Trump and Sean Hannity owe Hillary Clinton about $500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

@realDonaldTrump Then you fired Andrew McCabe because he was investigating you.  Then you asked your Acting AG to appoint your friend as a judge in the SDNY case.  If this isn't "Obstruction of Justice" then I don't know what is!
@realDonaldTrump You literally said on national TV that you "fired James Comey because of Russia."		NICE TRY!
@realDonaldTrump What about all the people who claimed that @HillaryClinton ran a pedophile ring from the basement of a pizza parlor that didn't even have a basement?  How much do they owe Hillary for their defamation?

Imagine what Republicans would have done if Barack Obama told U.S. Intel, “I don't care. I believe Osama Bin Laden."		Dear GOP,	Quit it with your double standards and begin holding your own accountable before it's too late!		History will view those Republicans who do as heroes.

Malia Obama likes wine and hates Trump.		Donald Trump Jr. likes to whine and hates being a Trump.

@ABlackAmericanM @catcherbloc @bobclemente5 @NorthWestSec @HillaryClinton You can listen to the interview yourself.  I posted the audio in this thread.
@TikiMaximus @workmom10 @HillaryClinton Yes, that's correct.  Obama's administration did "DETAIN" women, children and families, but they didn't have a policy that separate these innocent children from their mothers.  That's a HUGE difference.
@justathoughtguy @HillaryClinton No I haven't but my wife has breastfeed both of our children and no one has a right to tell her not to breastfeed her own child.  Men have no right making these stupid rules to prevent women from being women.
@ABlackAmericanM @catcherbloc @bobclemente5 @NorthWestSec @HillaryClinton The woman I interviewed was speaking of legitimate asylum seekers -- women fleeing violence with their babies -- being forced to feed them with chewed up food.

BREAKING: From the Rose Garden, President Trump just admitted that Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Rush Limbaugh, help influence his policies through discussions. 		That's how far we have fallen!	#FAKENationalEmergency
BREAKING: Trump just declared from the Rose Garden that after he signs the National Emergency, he will be sued for doing so.		He then implies that it will go to the Supreme Court and he will win.		ALL I CAN SAY IS:  "Ruth Bader Ginsburg!"		She's back, and she's ready for you!
From the Rose Garden, Trump just said that we have 'more people coming into the country today than probably ever before.'		FACT Check:  WRONG!  		Border crossings have been declining for 20 years.	#FAKENationalEmergency
BREAKING: President Trump from the Rose Garden just announce he is signing a National Emergency.  He says other Presidents have signed National Emergencies for less important things.		That's a blatant lie!	This is a #FakeTrumpEmergency
@WhiteHouse If you declare a national emergency, Democrats will do the same when they reclaim the White House.  We will declare national emergencies for Gun Violence, Climate Change and Gerrymandering.

@WGladstone Ahh OK, so because others call us “grifters,” that makes us grifters.  Good one.
@WGladstone So how is tweeting about politics “grifting?”
Trump denies science because if he accepted science he would have to admit that all of the mental diagnoses that his doctors have given him are legitimate.

Hillary Clinton loses emails and Republicans chant “Lock her up”.		Donald Trump loses children and Republicans chant “Four More Years”.		If you still don’t think that this is some sort of sick, twisted cult, maybe it’s time to reevaluate your priorities as Americans.

So yes, Northam should resign for racist acts.		So too should Donald Trump!
● Once pitched the idea of a show called "The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People."	 ● Called Haiti and some African countries, "sh-tholes"
● Once said "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks.
● Called for the death penalty of "the Central Park Five," and still said he believes they are guilty even after DNA evidence showed they are not.	● Trump's Casino once was fined for moving black dealers off of tables when high-rollers were gambling in the casino.
● Admitted to being a "nationalist"	● One time referred to a Hispanic Miss Universe as “Miss Housekeeping.”	● In the 70s, the DOJ found that Trump refused to rent his properties to black tenants.
● Said that immigrants from Haiti “all have AIDS”.	● Said “Our inner cities, African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot.”	● Called Puerto Ricans “politically motivated ingrates.”
● In speaking to Black voters, said, "You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?"	● Called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."
● Repeatedly has referred to Elizabeth Warren as "Pocahontas."	● Tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton saying "Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!" in front of a Jewish Star and pile of money.	● Called Mexican immigrants "rapists" (remember Trump is accused of raping his ex-wife).
As President Trump attacks Northam for being Racist, as he should, let's all remember that Trump is a racist too! (Thread)	● He called for a Mexican Judge to recuse himself in a case against Trump University.	● Referred to White Supremacists as "very fine people".
@RudyGiuliani Northam is a racist and he should resign.	Donald Trump is a racist and he should resign.		It's not hard for me to say this.  No matter what political party you are from, racism should not be tolerated.
@GOPLeader Agreed!  But this also means Steve King and Donald Trump should resign as well.

Impeachment Season is coming! https://t.co/R3JVpFR4Pe
Remember earlier this week when Trump tweeted: "58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote."		It turns out that this report was incorrect.		Why aren't any Republicans screaming "FAKE NEWS" at @realDonaldTrump 		He is the FAKE NEWS PRESIDENT!
@KeyMaster0000 @realDonaldTrump A cartoonish drawing won't stop me from making sure Americans see the FACTS.  A joke won't prevent me from calling Trump out on his lies.  If this is the best you can do, keep doing it.
@KeyMaster0000 @realDonaldTrump Is this supposed to make us upset or something?
@realDonaldTrump The best January in 30 years for the Dow came after the worst December since the Great Depression.		FACTS Matter!
@realDonaldTrump You are a Narcissist!  You only care about what makes you looks good. 	Even a world-renowned psychologist agrees:	https://t.co/n0e1idKBWK
@realDonaldTrump This comes after the DOW fell nearly 3000 points under your watch.  Nice try!
Dear @realdonaldtrump,	THEY ARE COMING FOR YOU! https://t.co/FXbiNVbQWi
@RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN Most Jews are Democrats because they've seen what happened to our ancestors. They've seen the persecution we've endured, and they don't believe anyone should be put through what we went through ever again. That's why most American Jews open their arms to Muslims. We are the same.
@RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN As a fellow Jew, I know what our ancestors were put through.  This text message is beyond disgusting and disgraceful.  		With this said, however, as a fellow American, your attacks on Illhan Omar are disgraceful as well.  You should know this better than anyone. 		Shame on you!
@realDonaldTrump Very few people would argue that we need a plan to bring our troops home.  A plan, however, is much different than you waking up one morning and commanding that all troops be brought home immediately.
@realDonaldTrump I agree, "certain people must get smart".  Those people are you and your multiple personalities.
@realDonaldTrump Just last month you said that we have "defeated ISIS".  Are you admitting now that this was just another one of your 8000+ lies?
@realDonaldTrump Being Commander-in-chief doesn't mean you can do whatever the hell you want.  This is not a Dictatorship.  You are not a Dictator.
@realDonaldTrump There needs to be an organized withdraw over a period of time.  You need to coordinate with our allies, and with the Troops.  You need to coordinate with our intel community as well.
@realDonaldTrump There is no arguing that you should get out of Syria and Afghanistan.  You just shouldn't do it on a whim, or simply because Putin tells you to.
Trump is suspending the Nuclear Arms treaty with Russia because he believes Putin broke the treaty.		Instead of suspending the treaty and allowing Russia to do whatever they want, unchecked, Trump should punish Russia for once.		But Trump doesn't want the Kompromat released.

@_BraveJustice @KrassenCast What do you think?
@ashleyfeinberg I agree that we should get out of Syria and Afghanistan, but not against the assessment of the intel community, our allies, and our military experts.  Timing is key. You don’t pull out on a whim.		Do you disagree?
@drmistercody No I think we should get out of Syria and Afghanistan, but not against the assessment of the intel community, our allies, and our military experts.  Timing is key. You don’t pull out on a whim.
@realDonaldTrump It wouldn’t surprise me if the Dossier is 99% correct.
@realDonaldTrump So far there has been plenty corroborated in the Dossier and nothing debunked.
@realDonaldTrump Tell me on thing “discredited” in the Steele Dossier.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, the “Witch Hunt” will end, as soon as all of the criminal witches are behind bars.
@realDonaldTrump I’m old enough to remember the dozens of criminal charges that this so-called “Witch Hunt” has uncovered.
@realDonaldTrump This Presidency must end! (Through impeachment)
@ashleyfeinberg No but it does mean that I care about everything that our Troops fought and died for.

@realDonaldTrump There is no way someone would have tried to get these drugs across the border on foot.  This is why we need more security at the legal points of entry rather than building a wall.
@realDonaldTrump It was an amazing bust.  US law enforcement is more capable than you think.  This is more proof that a wall isn’t needed.
@realDonaldTrump This bust was at a legal port of entry.  More evidence that a wall won’t help!

@realDonaldTrump If this "isn't about politics" then why are you now insisting that it be called "A WALL"?
@realDonaldTrump This video is factually incorrect.  In fact women and children ARE trafficked through legal ports of entry.  This is a fact.  It happens, just as drugs are brought in in the same way.

@realDonaldTrump Meanwhile the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia has killing an American journalist and you don't care.  Does this have anything to do with Saudi Arabia meddling in our election?  Does it have anything to do with your business interests in the country?
@realDonaldTrump You only want to harm Iran because that's what your boss, Putin, tells you to do.  Just admit it. You don't do things to help this country.  You do things to appease the big guy in Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats understand world issues.  If you would listen to your advisors, rather than the little red guy standing on your right shoulder, perhaps you could actually understand why the Iran Deal took place.

@realDonaldTrump I know you like to brag about the stock market, but the Dow is down over 1000 points from its high.  This is mostly because of your tariffs and trade war.
@realDonaldTrump Do you not realize that your tariffs are directly affecting American companies and workers?  Please, for once in your life, listen to your advisors!
@realDonaldTrump But meanwhile you are hurting our farmers and manufacturing companies tremendously with your trade war.

@realDonaldTrump Republicans are becoming the Party of the extremely wealthy, yet most in the party are not extremely wealthy.  Somehow they are being brainwashed to go against themselves.
@realDonaldTrump Democrats only want higher taxes on those people making over $10 million a year.  Most of America does too.
@realDonaldTrump What the heck are you talking about.  No Democrats are calling for "late term abortion".
@realDonaldTrump On Second thought, we desperately need a President who doesn't think Science is fake, and Facts are "FAKE NEWS".
@realDonaldTrump I can think of 100 things this country needs more "desperately" than a wall.  How about starting with healthcare, gun reform, climate change initiatives and Impeaching you?
@realDonaldTrump Remember all of the other "Caravans" you tweeted about?  Remember how they didn't actually cross the border?  Now let's recall that there is no Wall.  		Perhaps we don't need a wall after all.
Why is it that whenever Trump talks about socialism, he only mentions Venezuela?	These countries are also socialists:		●Denmark	●Finland	●Netherlands	●Canada	●Sweden	●Norway	●Ireland	●New Zealand	●Belgium		Most of these nations rank higher than us in multiple categories.
@realDonaldTrump China's President knows that you are not the strongest person.  He will call your bluff and he will hold out, knowing very well that your approval ratings go down, the longer this trade war lasts.
@realDonaldTrump So on March 1, you will hit American manufacturers and workers even harder.  Do you expect us to celebrate these actions or something?
@realDonaldTrump Your trade war is hurting your own voters more than anyone else. I wish that some of these people will relinquish their blind faith in you, open their eyes and see that you are hurting them and their families with your ridiculous policies.
@realDonaldTrump Just like when you told us that progress was being made in North Korea, and then your own Intel chiefs told us that you were not telling us the truth.
@realDonaldTrump You know what I think?  I think no progress is being made and you are just lying to the American people for the 8000+ time.  Why should we believe you after you've told us so many falsehoods?
@realDonaldTrump This trade war is already wiping out American businesses. Economists are saying it will have a greater effect on the U.S. than on China.  China knows this. That's why they are holding out.
@realDonaldTrump China doesn't want an increase in tariffs, but neither do American workers.
@realDonaldTrump So far this battle with China is costing American jobs, hurting the economy, and hurting our relationship with the rest of the world.

@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @foxandfriends How about sensible gun control?  	How about universal background checks?	How about banning assault style rifles?	How about actually getting serious about trying to stop all of the gun crimes in this country, committed by Americans?
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @foxandfriends If you are so concerned about murder, maybe you should start considering that the number one weapon used for murder is a gun.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @foxandfriends Because a wall doesn't prevent murder.
@realDonaldTrump If like you said "much caused by DRUGS", then the wall definitely isn't the answer.  Talk to border patrol.  Over 99% of the drugs coming from south of the border are coming via legal ports of entry (in cars, boats and planes).
@realDonaldTrump WALL IS NOT BEING BUILT!
@realDonaldTrump The vast vast vast majority of murders and crime in the U.S. is coming from Americans who were born in America.  FACTS and STATS MATTER!
@realDonaldTrump Just admit that you broke your promise to you base.  It's not hard to admit that you made a mistake, at least not for people without malignant narcissism.
@realDonaldTrump You can call fences which have been up for decades whatever you want to, but they definitely are NOT 2000 mile long concrete walls, paid for by Mexico.
@realDonaldTrump If you call them "WALLS" then Obama built the Wall.
@realDonaldTrump Also, when the heck do we get the check from Mexico?  Shouldn't they be paying us for all of these "renovations"?
@realDonaldTrump Fencing has been put up under Obama, Bush, and Clinton.  Sections have also been renovated under these presidents.  Just because it's continuing under you, doesn't mean that you are building a wall.
@realDonaldTrump Yes large sections of the "WALL" have been being built for decades. Don't try to confuse your base into believing that your promise is being upheld.
@realDonaldTrump @KrassenCast Malignant Narcissists have issues where they need to purge their own staff because they are so power hungry.  Hitler did it.  Stalin did it, and Saddam did it.

@realDonaldTrump If you aren't considering not building a wall, you are wasting your time!

@realDonaldTrump They are NOT!  It's NOT happening!  Give up!
@realDonaldTrump Every action has a reaction, and the reactions to the things you will not be remembered fondly in history.
@realDonaldTrump All that North Korea ever wanted was to be viewed on the same stage as America.  You gave them that chance.  Obama knew that by giving them the chance to be seen in the same light as America would give them the appearance of being equals in the eyes of the world.
@realDonaldTrump At the end of the previous presidency, North Korea respected our country for our strength.  With you they know that you are not strong.
@realDonaldTrump You told us that you would defeat ISIS in 30 days.  So when you claim that there is a "Decent chance" that something will happen, I'm guessing that means it's less likely than when you claimed you would wipe ISIS off the earth in 30 days.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you talk about how Russia offered North Korea a Nuclear Power Plant?  Why don't you ever mention that?  Putin got your tongue?
@realDonaldTrump Your own DNI contradicted you on North Korea.  Why do you continue to lie to the American people in order to make yourself look better?
@realDonaldTrump I’m old enough to remember when you said that if you became President you would destroy ISIS in one month.  Kinda like how you said Mexico would pay for a wall.  Both were lies.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that ISIS and the Taliban are different groups of people, right?
@realDonaldTrump I thought you said we defeated ISIS last month!
@realDonaldTrump One day, hopefully your Presidency is overthrown too, through impeachment or a new election.

@realDonaldTrump Non-disclosure agreements within the WH are worthless.  You know this because that's why you aren't suing him.

It's not a question of if Trump committed crimes, it's a question of how many crimes he committed, how many family members and Republican allies were complicit and how much jail time will they all serve.  It's just a matter of time before Mueller exposes it all!

Why is it that so many people who once chanted "Lock her up" are actually being locked up, while she is enjoying her freedom in retirement?		It's because these criminals were distracting us with a fake suspect while they broke all of the laws that they claimed she did.

@realDonaldTrump Have you seen the indictments against your campaign?  If anyone defrauded the American people it was your own campaign.
@realDonaldTrump At least when he says something untrue, he apologizes for it.  You have told us 8000 lies and you just keep doing it.
If you don't care about children's lives being ruined at the border, you aren't "Pro-life".		If you stand by a President who continues to support Saudi Arabia, you are not "Pro-life".		If you are OK with Trump buddying up with the murderous Putin, you are not "Pro-Life".

@realDonaldTrump Your approval ratings fall more and more as you push for the wall.  Keep pushing for it and your ratings will be below where Nixon’s were when he was being impeached.
@realDonaldTrump You don’t get it do you? Democrats have the House.  You must go through them. If you declare a national emergency, the courts will reject it.
@realDonaldTrump You won’t build the wall if Democrats say you won’t.
@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner @FoxNews Fox News makes money by feeding their viewers ridiculous conspiracy theories.  It’s how they make money.  They have given up on reporting facts in favor of pushing conspiracy theories.

@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner @FoxNews You are correct.  Fox News is clueless.
@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @JillianTurner @FoxNews You really need to stop watching the FAKE NEW Fox News and start watching @CNN.

@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @JillianTurner @FoxNews Yes you are correct.  Fox News is clueless.
When everyone around the crime boss is arrested, it's a good sign that the crime boss is in trouble. 		Just saying...
Everytime Trump brings of Hillary Clinton's name when he talks about his own actions, you can take that as confirmation that he's essentially saying, "I did it".
We are close to a month in since the new House took over, and Republicans still have yet to name their members of the House Intel Committee.  They are doing this to delay investigations.		I say that if Republicans don't name their members, Democrats should get to do it for them.
BREAKING: Today the Trump administration has just lifted sactions on Putin Buddy Oleg Deripaska.  The GOP allowed this to happen, even though the entire point of the Trump Tower meeting was for the Russians to provide dirt on Hillary in exchange for Trump to lifting sanctions.
To Mr. Schultz:		While I think you have good leadership qualities &amp; perhaps have what it takes to be President, I think that unless you run as a Democrat or Republican, your actions will only help Trump get reelected in 2020. Please don't run as an independent.		Who's with me? https://t.co/68ZKgeaLRT
@HowardSchultz Don't you think that running as an independent will hurt Democrats, and simply help Trump have a better shot at getting reelected?  Why not run as a Republican or Democrat?
Roger Stone could be facing prison for the rest of his life if he doesn't flip on Trump.  If Trump is to pardon him, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court would allow the pardon to go through.		In other words, the crime boss is in big trouble.

@realDonaldTrump You criticize BuzzFeed when Mueller claims that part of the story is incorrect, yet you discredit Mueller on a daily basis.  Mueller has outlined many of your campaigns crimes and lies -- many more than the media's.
@realDonaldTrump You have literally lied to Americans over 8000 times since taking office.  For you to jump on the media because they make a mistake and then correct it or because Mueller contradicts a small portion of the story, is insanity.
@realDonaldTrump One wonders how so many falsehoods could be crammed into a single President.
@realDonaldTrump Can you please share where we can see this statement?  I have my doubts that she actually said this.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they are raising more money to protect the organization against you.  Did you ever think of that possibility?

What about all the fake social media campaign that they initiated to tell lies about Hillary?

Trump said that his campaign had no contacts with Russia.		The NY Times has documented 100 times in which his campaign has had contact with Russians. 		Perhaps it's time to admit that Trump is a Russian asset, and begin questioning if perhaps Trump's ties could amount to Treason.

@realDonaldTrump More people in America don't want a wall than do.  Isn't your presidency about doing what our citizens desire?
@realDonaldTrump We absolutely do not need a wall!
@realDonaldTrump The question isn't whether or not the RNC will support you in the upcoming election.  The question is, how many members of the RNC will be implicated in Robert Mueller's investigation, and how many others will jump ship once Mueller issues his report.
@realDonaldTrump You have NOT done more than any other Administration, unless you consider dividing America more than it has been divided since the Civl War as "doing more".
@realDonaldTrump Meanwhile the Koch brothers have said that they will NOT be supporting you.
@realDonaldTrump Instead of paying to build a wall that can be tunneled under or laddered over, how about paying more border agents?  This will create more jobs and help the economy.  With the excess money, you can actually do good for this country.
@realDonaldTrump If we can prevent the caravans from coming into our country without building a wall, how about we use that $5.7 billion for other things such as fixing Flint's water crisis, or helping our homeless veterans?
@realDonaldTrump How did you turn them away without a wall?
@realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi has grabbed you by the ego, and she's not letting go.
@realDonaldTrump It won't be easy to make a deal as long as you keep insisting on a wall. There are much better solutions that would work, but you refuse to even evaluate the facts.  Until you admit that a wall is not the answer, you won't have a solution.
@realDonaldTrump You aren't getting your wall.  That's a given. Don't you get it by now?  Democrats won the House by campaign for "no wall". Most of Americans don't want a wall.
Remember the judge who locked Paul Manafort up for witness tampering, claiming that he "can't take his cellphone"?		Well, Roger Stone just drew the same judge.		Thoughts and Prayers.....
@realDonaldTrump The Democrats literally offered you millions for "border security".  You are the one who turned down the deal.
@realDonaldTrump Actually Democrats are very serious about border security, so if it's an issue in 2020, it will benefit Democrats who want to find a solution without taking pay from federal employees.  Democrats simply don't agree that the Wall is the solution to border security.
@realDonaldTrump You literally shut the government down in order to take a deal that Democrats offered you 36 days ago, in order to avoid the shutdown in the first place.
@realDonaldTrump Roger Stone threatened Randy Credico (Person #2), not to tell the truth to the House committee.  Witness intimidation carries a sentence of up to 20 years alone.  This doesn't even include the 5 counts of lying, or the 1 count of obstruction of justice.
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that if you own DOJ believed that Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Page or Hillary broke the law, they could indict them, right?  The only reason they aren't being indicted is because they didn't actually lie or break the law, like so many of your guys did.
@realDonaldTrump To be clear, Roger Stone was indicted for lying to congress,witness tampering and obstruction of justice.  There is solid evidence in the indictment of this.  Stop blaming Hillary Clinton for wrongdoings by your campaign.
In the words of Roger Stone himself. 		It is now Roger Stone's turn in the barrel!		And you know what?		I really don't care, do u?
President Trump should be INDICTED!		An indictment would sent a precedent for all future presidents, letting them know that they can't use the office of the presidency to commit crimes and get away with them.		Who's with me on this?

This explains a lot!	https://t.co/3TnZJHXfgy
@PreetBharara Keep up the good work Preet.  If anything, this is a compliment.
@IngrahamAngle @CNN I interviewed your brother Curtis on our podcast.  He had some interesting things to say about you Laura. https://t.co/0slqxSSNLa
Roger Stone says that he is falsely accused.		Anyone who can read the indictment can clearly see that this is not the case.

@Jdemp76 @realDonaldTrump I correct all of Trump’s lies because facts should matter.
@realDonaldTrump If you declare a national emergency, Democrats will declare a national emergency for climate change, and healthcare.  Your choice.
@realDonaldTrump But it was a concession, and the concession was good for America.  Thanks for realizing that the Democrats were right.
Sarah Sanders, when Donald Trump is arrested:  "This has nothing to do with the President."
You know who wasn't arrested before dawn this morning?		Hillary Clinton or any of her associates.
So the horrific Trump shutdown that he started was entirely pointless. 		He ended it without getting anything other than 7 points added to his disapproval rating.		Art of the Deal I tell you!	ART OF THE DEAL!

@realDonaldTrump When everyone around the crime boss is arrested, it's a good sign that the crime boss is in big trouble. 		Just saying...
@realDonaldTrump You should have just come out waving the white flag, because essentially that's what you just did.
Trump's Rose Garden Speech summarized in one hashtag:		#TrumpCaved
Trump is in the Oval Office right now rapidly reloading Ann Coulter's Twitter feed.
Why didn't Trump just come out into the Rose Garden and wave a white flag? 		It could have saved us all the expense of watching him make a fool of himself and embarrass this country further.		Hurry Mueller!  Hurry!
BREAKING:  Trump just said Democrats have fully acknowledged that a barrier is needed.		Why do I have a feeling that this is a LIE?

When Randy Credico (Person 2) was set to testify, Roger Stone texted him:		"Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan'... Richard Nixon"		That's how sick Stone is.  He is still trying to defend Richard Nixon!		And Donald Trump is his new Richard Nixon!

For anyone wondering why Fox News’ Laura Ingraham is such a monster, here is your answer! https://t.co/3TnZJHXfgy
Trump claimed that Reagan tried very hard to "get a wall".		FACT CHECK: Reagan was against walls, and wanted to find ways to allow immigrants to come to America legally. In fact Reagan has a famous quote referring to the Berlin wall: "Tear down this wall!"		FACTS MATTER!
Why is it so hard for people to believe that a man who lied 7000 times, cheated on all of his wives, allegedly raped one wife, and committed election fraud to become president, wouldn't lie about being a Russian asset?
BREAKING: The Koch Brothers are not planning to back President Trump for re-election.		Looks like Trump will have to rely solely on laundered Russian money this time.
Trump has called women horsefaces, losers, nasty, dogs, lowlifes, bimbos, &amp; chubby. 		He even claimed he could have "nailed" Princess Diana, and bragged about grabbing women by the private parts.		Now, a strong woman, Nancy Pelosi, has grabbed Trump by his ego and he is helpless!

@realDonaldTrump Maybe if she didn’t tell lie after lie, the media would respect what she says.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump will find a way to blame Democrats when the recession hits.  Mark my words.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump’s rules only apply to Democrats.  He’s the epitome of the word “hypocrite”.

@realDonaldTrump You blame the “Fake News” for everything.  Did you ever consider that perhaps a President who has lied 8000+ times is a “Fake President”?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Maybe we should be more focused on the crime already taking place in this country and the drug problems killing hundreds of Americans daily. This isn’t the immigrants’ faults.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Fun Fact:  On average, crime along the southern border is lower than crime elsewhere in America.
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr A wall will not “prevent crime and drugs”.  That’s a guarantee.  Most crime is committed by American citizens already living in America.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Once a cheater, always a cheater.  There is no reason to believe Trump still isn't cheating the polls.
@realDonaldTrump That poll also shows that your overall approval rating declined a lot.  Why don't you tweet about that?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump If anyone in their right mind believes that Mueller will use the Dossier to prove any crimes, they are wrong.  If the Dossier is "Fake" then that would mean that Mueller won't find it to be true, and Trump wouldn't have a single thing to worry about.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The Dossier is not "The Clinton Campaign's Fake and Unverified" dossier.  It is a "very well respected British Intel agent's corroborated dossier."
@realDonaldTrump Not a single element in the Dossier has been debunked.  A heck of a lot has been corroborated. Did you even think that maybe the Dossier is 100% correct?

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends 35%?  I think it's less than that now, and it will be down to 25% before long.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends This isn't a game.  No one should be "playing" anything.  This is a matter of Americans not having food on their tables to feed their children.  Wake up and realize that the world doesn't revolve around TRUMP.  You are supposed to be our President.

WRONG:  He didn't "give his life to right the wrong of racial inequality." 		He lost his life because of racial injustice!		Dr. King's life was taken from him by bigotry and hatred! #MLKDay https://t.co/hAN3CKpTDX
Lady Gaga has joined the fray in condemning Trump and Pence.  Thank you for standing up for your values @ladygaga https://t.co/ztZiPab2f0
@realDonaldTrump @VP You literally spent 90 seconds there and said nothing about MLK.  That’s sad.
Three women are now running for President.		That's what I call progress! Let’s keep progressing!
@BarackObama We should continue progressing toward Dr. King’s ultimate goal, rather than taking steps back as a nation filled with MAGA hat wearers bringing on a rebirth of racism.
Dr. King helped tear down the wall of segregation, and build a bridge between races.  		Now what Trump wants to do is build his own wall between that very bridge.		If MLK were alive today, he would undoubtedly be protesting Trump and begging him not to stop his dream. #MLKDay
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump For god's sake, his ancestors immigrated here with just the clothes on their back, seeking jobs in America.  If it wasn't for that fact, he would likely be a poor criminal living elsewhere.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump couldn't get things done when he had a Republican House and Senate.  He's the one who can't get things done.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump campaign on unifying America.  He's doing the exact opposite every single time he talks or tweets.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Anyone can claim they are for equality, but it's one's actions that determine who they are, not their words.
@realDonaldTrump They are trying to get a lot done, if you would open the damn government and realize that border security without a wall, is a valid solution.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Or children from south of the border.
@realDonaldTrump "No matter what the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God."		Is that why you believe Guatemalan kids should be torn from their parents' arms and thrown in cages?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The first tweet by Trump on MLK Day is one bragging about himself.  How Trumpian of him?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump is like a broken record that repeats falsehoods over and over again.  In reality Manufacturing Jobs have been trending upward since 1990.
@realDonaldTrump According to the White House schedule, you have “no public events scheduled” for today. Why aren’t you participating in any Martin Luther King Jr. services or events? #MLKDay
Are you kidding me?  For all of the talk about "FAKE NEWS" from Fox News commentators like Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Tucker Carlson, where is the outrage over their own Network doing this?  https://t.co/ouSy5ffrj2
This is great.  Mike Pence was expecting an easy interview with @FoxNews, but Chris Wallace challenged him.  It didn’t go well for the stumbling, bumbling Pence. https://t.co/EQwZB1lm6g
@PressSec It's rare that I agree with you, but I agree with you on this.  Let's not try and revert everything that MLK did.  Let's continue to progress to a point where human inequality no longer exists.
Instead of attacking one another based on race, religion, sexuality, gender, or sex every one of us should instead desire to learn about those subtle things that make us different.		It's the fear of difference that builds walls, but open minds build bridges.		#MLKDay #MLK
Thank you @AOC for getting young people interested in politics and social issues. https://t.co/ruA3Ffj8Ai
And no, Nick Sandmann should NOT be doxxed, harassed or threatened.  I believe he was in the wrong here, as were many of his classmates and certain members of the Black Israelites.  I believe Nathan Phillips was trying to diffuse the situation, not escalate it.
While I believe the media was too quick to act, I also believe that Sandmann could have chosen to allow Phillips to walk away, but instead chose to stand in his way. We don't know what Sandmann's mindset was, but to me it appears as though he was being disrespectful.
Once Nathan Phillips was crowded in, he tried making his way out of the crowd.  The video footage shows this, and in the video you can see many students making way for Phillips, but Nick Sandmann just stood there, not moving.
In the video footage, the Native American Vietnam Vet, Nathan Phillips appears to first try to diffuse the arguing between the group of Black Israelites and the Covington students -- both groups were instigators in the matter.  Then both groups came together crowding Phillips in.
I admit, much of the media rushed to judgement on Nick Sandmann. FACTS MATTER!		With this said, however, this doesn't change the fact that students at the Covington Catholic High School appeared to taunt and tease a Native American Vietnam Vet.
California Sen. Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy for President on #MartinLutherKingJrDay could not be more perfect.  Congrats to Harris!		What are everyone's thoughts on Harris as an opponent to Trump or Pence in 2020?
I am not a black man	I am not a woman	I am not a Muslim	I am not a gay man	I am not a transgender	I AM A HUMAN AND I WAS NOT CREATED BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE!		We were all created equal, no matter what the MAGA crowd says!		Happy #MLKDay
My question is, why the hell is 35% of a catholic school wearing MAGA hats &amp; shirts, when Trump stands for everything that Jesus did not? 	This man cheated on all of his wives, constantly lies, and brags about grabbing women by their private parts. Is this now the Catholic norm?
@realDonaldTrump It would be nice if the President took as much time caring about his federal employees as he does congratulating his supporters.
@realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow I grew up a Phillies fan.  Schilling and Dykstra were my favorite players.  Now that I’m older I realize I was rooting for indecent human beings.  It’s disgusting that you are tweeting this just because Schilling is a known Trump supporter.
This is the definition of Hypocrisy.	https://t.co/3QiJbBmPfC
@realDonaldTrump @SteveHiltonx No President in modern times has lied or cheated more than you.
Trump just is NOT smart.	https://t.co/guz0rNaqnM
I'm not disrespecting the office of the President.		I'm disrespecting the President in that office -- the man who is disrespecting the office which he holds.
People ask me how I can keep tweeting knowing that so many people hate me for it.		I tell them that history and my kids will be the judge of me, not Fox News addicts who refuse to think for themselves, deny facts and deny science.
Nancy Pelosi has more spine in her first vertebra than Paul Ryan has in his entire body.  I'm happy that we finally have a Speaker of the House who stands straight up for what is right!
@realDonaldTrump I’m rooting for the Rams, just because you aren’t.
To @realDonaldTrump,		YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR STUPID WALL! Americans voted against the wall in the midterms!  YOU LOST!		Sincerely,	An American Voter
@tonyposnanski @MelissaJPeltier Man, I don't know what Twitter allows and disallows anymore.  I'm so confused by this shit.
@kendallybrown Thanks for the endorsement.  You are awesome!
Don Jr. blocked me 3 Months ago right after I tweeted this:		"With Manafort flipping I guarantee you that the entire Trump family is scared right now.  That includes you @DonaldJTrumpJr!"		I've now been blocked by @realDonaldTrump, @EricTrump &amp; Don Jr.		IT'S A BADGE OF HONOR!!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump is thanking his hostages. That’s how foolish he is.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump can personally open the government today.  It doesn’t require any deal with Democrats.
@realDonaldTrump If you want to thank them, how about paying them for the work they are doing you fool?
President Trump should be INDICTED!		An indictment would sent a precedent for all future presidents, letting them know that they can't use the office of the presidency to commit crimes and get away with them.		Who's with me on this?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Yes, there is nothing more he wants than to distract his base from the upcoming Michael Cohen testimony.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump My guess is that whatever he thinks she deserves credit for has been plagiarized from Michelle Obama.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Apparently only Republicans and President’s wives are allowed to travel during the shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump She deserves a ton of credit for not leaving you, especially after you cheated on her with a porn star.
@realDonaldTrump If you wanted to make a deal, you would give up on your wall and focus on real border security options that would work.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Thankfully democracy prevailed.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The Senate is worthless when it comes to holding Trump accountable since Republicans are in control.
@realDonaldTrump By “Fantastic Job”, do you mean he will side with Russia on foreign affairs?
Why is it so hard for people to believe that a man who lied 7000 times, cheated on all of his wives, allegedly raped one wife, and committed election fraud to become president, wouldn't lie about being a Russian asset?
Trump has called women horsefaces, losers, nasty, dogs, lowlifes, bimbos, &amp; chubby. 		He even claimed he could have "nailed" Princess Diana, and bragged about grabbing women by the private parts.		Now, a strong woman, Nancy Pelosi, has grabbed Trump by his ego and he is helpless!
To @realDonaldTrump: Just because you retweet a dozen other Republicans’ opinions that your wall is a good idea, this doesn’t actually make your wall a good idea.  It just makes them as ignorant as you.
To @realDonaldTrump, please insult Cardi B, so that she can Tomi Lahren walk you.
Republican Senator John Kennedy:  "I don't think we are going to get the money for the border wall."		NO SH!T Sherlock!
Trump thinks he playing chess but he’s really just peeing on a tree. https://t.co/3QiJbB5eo4
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It’s sad that our country is being run by Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The only progress Trump has made is to his own bank account.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump admitted to being a “Nationalist”. 	Enough said!
@realDonaldTrump I think you meant to say Russia and Racism First.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Just because Trump met with Kim Jong-Un, he thinks it’s progress.  He’s absolutely right.... Progress for North Korea!
@realDonaldTrump What progress??
To all of those hypocrites in the GOP condemning Steve King's comments, where are you when Trump partakes in racist rhetoric, dog whistles &amp; policies? Don't justify everything that you allow the #RadicalRacistPresident to get away with simply because you stand against Steve King.
Today marks 2 yrs since President Trump has been in office.  		In those two years, American racism has come out of the closet while progression as a nation has been abruptly halted.		Is this what we want as a nation?		Time to Impeach the #RadicalRacistPresident! 		Who's with me?
The ignorance and fear mongering needs to stop by this #RadicalRacistPresident!  This is just embarrassing! https://t.co/guz0rMSPwe
- Cardi B Album = $26.87 on Amazon		- Cardi B Single = $1.29 on iTunes		- Watching Cardi B destroy both Tomi Lahren and our #RadicalRacistPresident in one tweet = Priceless https://t.co/gVV16gE0dB
Over the past 2 years, @Krassenstein and I have been fact checking the #RadicalRacistPresident on his lies. Now, we are bringing the same resistance to a free podcast. 		We are officially launching @Krassencast!		Feel free to support us at https://t.co/GmM2WBqF8s https://t.co/fPsImaHW4v
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl Both these Wohl guys deserve to be in prison.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Yes, David is the father of Jacob Wohl who teamed with Jack Burkman to make up fake sexual assault allegations against Robert Mueller.  The plan fell apart when the alleged victim told Brian and I that she didn't know if it really was Mueller or not.
@realDonaldTrump David Wohl is the father of con-man @JacobAWohl.  For those who don't remember, we exposed him as a fraud.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump built many casino's in AC, most likely to help him launder money.  He treated his employees like crap and then bankrupted his casinos.  He's a failure of a businessman and a failure of a human being.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump loves taking credit for other Presidents' successes, and refuses to take blame for his own failures.
@realDonaldTrump Renovation of the border fencing has been ongoing for decades.  This is not something that only your administration is doing. Strategically placed fencing works.  A wall across the border, however, is pointless.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump For all of the talk about "rigged polls" that Trump wouldn't shut up about during his campaign, he was actually the one rigging the polls.  He really does accuse others of things that he does.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The #RadicalRacistPresident just makes this stuff up and expects his base to believe him because to them he is the gospel.
@realDonaldTrump Which poll is this?  Is it one that you paid Michael Cohen to rig?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He put his own political gain ahead of Nancy Pelosi's safety.  If this was any other President, we'd be talking impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump Why did you put Nancy's life in danger by leaking that she was going to fly commercially?  What about that "Security"?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump #RadicalRacistPresident realizes that Democrats are stronger than he though.  They will not give in.  He will lose.
President Trump is a #RadicalRacistPresident.  Who agrees?		If we get 2000 retweets in 30 minutes this will likely get trending.	#RadicalRacistPresident
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump loves the word "Radical".  He must have been a fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when he grew up.  My guess is that he was a fan of Splinter.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Radical Racist President!  Who agrees?
@realDonaldTrump Irrationally?  You mean like when you cheated on all of your wives?  Or when you decided to tear children from their parents' arms and put them in cages?  Or When you decided it would be a good idea to collude with Russia?		I call that irrational!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This is Bribery.  It's the same tactics that Putin uses to get Trump to do what he wants.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump RETWEET IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE WALL!
@realDonaldTrump So you don't think that someone who grew up in America from the time they were an infant, and then served in the military, should be granted amnesty?  Maybe you need to relinquish your own citizenship!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Not all of us are as ignorant as Trump thinks we are.  Betsy DeVos hasn't cancelled public schooling just yet.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The GOP campaigned on building a Wall.	The Democrats campaign on NOT building a Wall.		Democrats won!		The Wall is not being built because the voters should have a voice.  Don't you get this?
@realDonaldTrump They turned down your offer because they knew you were not relenting on your stupid wall.  $5.7 billion for something that doesn't work is not the reason why Democrats won the House.  Opposing your wall is, so that's what they are going to do.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It's a proven fact that CO2 in the atmosphere, creates a green house affect.  This isn't some myth!  This isn't some political statement.  IT'S FACT!		FACTS MATTER!  AT LEAST THEY SHOULD MATTER!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Actually many scientists believe that global warming may cause colder, more severe winters.  		It would be nice if the U.S. President would actually talk to someone smart before making his ridiculous claims.
@realDonaldTrump I think if we are in areas where there is record setting snow, we already know.  Do you really need to tell the country to keep a lookout for snow?  We aren't blind!  		BTW, Global warming doesn't mean we don't have snow, you fool!		Pick up a book for once!
Donald Trump is like the school bully who pushes a classmate down, waits until the teacher comes in, and then helps the kid get back up.  He wants praise for things he doesn't deserve, and doesn't want to take blame for the things he does. This isn't kindergarten! This is America
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Here's an idea:  Fund the government, protect DACA, and secure the border through all of those means you mentioned last night, except for the stupid wall, and I promise you that you will get good media attention. 		Heck, I'll tweet praise of you then!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump, can you tell us what policy moves you have made that have attributed to Low unemployment, and "Big GDP"?  Last I checked they are on the same trend line downward as they were since 2009 when Obama was President.  And BTW, companies are leaving the US
@realDonaldTrump The Dow is literally down over 2,000 points in just a few months.  Why don't you mention that?		You can't just pick and choose your states. If that was true, anyone could appear to be a good President.  Even me!
Stop saying that if Trump fires Mueller it should be the end of his Presidency.		Trump already committed this exact crime when he fired James Comey &amp; Andrew McCabe for investigating his other crimes.		His Presidency should have ended twice already!		Stop giving him more chances!

I predict that in 10 years from now, no one will admit that they voted for or ever supported Donald Trump, except for the admitted White Supremacists and neo-Nazis.
The special counsel's comments regarding to the BuzzFeed story should prove to everyone that Mueller is about finding the truth.		When Trump &amp; Giuliani celebrate the fact that Mueller is standing up for the truth, they better be prepared to do the same when his report is released
If Jared Kushner is indicted for significant federal and state crimes, I have no doubt in my mind that he would flip on his father-in-law in a heartbeat.
White Man (Kavanaugh) attends gang rape parties - "He was just college"		White Man (Trump) brags about sexual assault - "Locker room talk"		White Man (Trump) allegedly rapes his wife - "It was his wife"		Muslim Woman calls White Man a "motherf--ker" - "disgraceful"		HYPOCRISY!
If your children lie to you, you discipline them.	If your employees lie to you, you fire them.	If your friends lie to you, you unfriend them.		When our President lies to us, we should IMPEACH HIM!		How hard is this to understand?
Trump said that universal healthcare doesn’t work anywhere in the world.  		Fact is, it works everywhere in the world except for the countries who are too afraid to ever try it because they are led by morons like Trump.
Next Rudy Giuliani will claim that "Trump broke the law, but the law was wrong".		Mark my words!  It's coming!
When it came to political polling, Trump cheated.	When it came to his marriage, Trump cheated.	When it came to his business, Trump cheated.	When it came to fundraising, Trump cheated.		When it came to his election, what do you think Trump did?		Once a cheater always a cheater!
Dear @SecNielsen,		Shame on you for tearing little kids from their parents arms, and then throwing them in cages before lying to the American people about it.  You, are a bully, a liar, and simply put, a horrific human being.		Sincerely,	An American
@aronpricePGA @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Actually I live in the 21st century where push notifications exist.  I assume you are tweeting from the past?
@bessbell @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump We would if we lived in our parents basement together, but we moved out last week.
BREAKING:  Nancy Pelosi just rejected President Trump's offer.		Nancy Pelosi has grabbed Trump by his ego, and is not letting go.  		Give up Donny Boy!  You aren't getting your stupid wall!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump claimed that 1 in 3 women migrating across the border are sexually assaulted.  Do we actually have facts to back this claim up? I don’t see it anywhere.  Waiting....
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Everything Trump proposed sounded great except for the stupid wall that won’t work.
@realDonaldTrump You just said that his “ultimate loyalty is to the American people”.		If this was actually true he wouldn’t be requesting a wall that most Americans don’t want.		We don’t want your stupid WALL!
Trump just said that his “ultimate loyalty is to the American people”.		If this was actually true he wouldn’t be requesting a wall that most Americans don’t want.		We don’t want your stupid wall!
Trump’s offer to Democrats sounds perfect as long you take the part about the stupid wall out of it.
Ocasio-Cortez is my hero.	https://t.co/F8DpSjv7OM
GOP Congressman from Texas' Southern Border, Will Hurd: "There's a thing we care about in Texas called private property rights."		Finally a Republican who makes some sense!  Trump wants to take private property to build his stupid wall. Every Republican should be against this!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump just loves having all eyes on him, so he schedules these ridiculous addresses to the nation.  Don’t worry though, all eyes will be on you Donny, once Mueller has you in a courtroom.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump More like we need confirmation that there will be NO WALL, or else there should be no compromise! #DidTrumpOpenGovernmentYet
@realDonaldTrump Delayed an hour... did you realize your first plan would work? #DidTrumpOpenGovernmentYet
We are currently in the longest government shutdown ever, and the man who has taken our federal employees hostage actually thinks that Democrats will compromise on his demands. That’s not how hostage situations work. #DidTrumpOpenGovernmentYet
There are children who have been separated from their parents for months, due to Trump's policies, and he's sitting in the White House crying about how lonely he is.		These kids are lonely. You just have no friends.  There is a difference!
I just love it when Fox News has to admit that Trump is misleading the American people. https://t.co/XZxToePvc2
So which is it @realDonaldTrump and @RudyGiuliani?		Is BuzzFeed untrustworthy or is Mueller untrustworthy?  		You can no longer have it both ways.
I love how people ask me "How many illegal immigrants are you taking into your home?"		I then ask them "How many homeless American veterans are you taking into your home?"		That shuts them up every time.
My belief is that patriotism shouldn’t be defined by whether or not you stand for a flag, but rather by how you treat those who live under that flag.		I stand with Marshawn Lynch (@moneylynch).  He’s more patriotic than Trump will ever be!  https://t.co/U4HJtPlQPX
The only way one can view the Special Counsel’s statement in regards to the BuzzFeed story is that:	A) There is some sort of legal strategy here in making the statement, or	B) Every single media report about Trump’s collusion with Russia is 100% true, including the Steele Dossier
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Every move that Trump makes, Putin is somewhere in Moscow dancing.  Putin is loving the rift you are creating between America and one of our closest allies, Mexico.  The more division we have, the better it is for Putin.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump How about instead of building a wall, we create more American jobs by hiring more border agents and by hiring tech firms to create better technology to prevent drugs and migrants from being smuggled through legal points of entry?
@realDonaldTrump So there you go.  We "stopped the last two" without your stupid wall!
BOOM! We have an important announcement to make! One that President Trump will lose sleep over!		We are officially announcing @KrassenCast and a Patreon to go along with it! #satchat https://t.co/GmM2WBqF8s https://t.co/ahy5RWY1ZH
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Exactly, and if Michael Cohen testifies before Congress on Feb. 7th that Trump directed him to lie, there is no way that he could be doing this in order to escape more prison time, now that Mueller has said some of the Buzzfeed report is mischaracterized.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump When Michael Cohen testifies on Feb. 7th, we will find out just how much of that Buzzfeed story was correct.  Keep in mind you won't be able to claim that Cohen is lying to get out of jail time while also claiming that Mueller disagrees with him.
@realDonaldTrump The special counsel didn't say that the entire Buzzfeed report was incorrect.  They didn't elaborate.  If anything this proves that Mueller is only seeking the truth.  Does everyone agree?
One day John Kelly will make millions by writing a book.  I hope he donates all of that money to the children’s lives he destroy by separating them from their families. https://t.co/yGyjPmfASp
@RudyGiuliani Wouldn't you also agree that it shows that Mueller is 100% about the truth, and that he's not out to get anyone, but rather just show America what really happened?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The Dow is down nearly 2,000 points since it's peak in January.  This isn't Obama's fault!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He's preparing America for the Mueller report that will likely show a criminal conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and money laundering.  He knows that his way out isn't to prove his innocence, but rather to sway the public's opinion of him as a leader.  It won't work!
@realDonaldTrump The stock market has fallen tremendously over the past few months because of your trade policies and the fear people have in the fact that we have a mad man running our country and trying to control the federal reserve.
Let's all remember that Robert Mueller was able to take down John Gotti when most prosecutors believed he was untouchable.  		Let's also remember that John Gotti had a brain.		Just saying....
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Everyone needs to look up Rosneft and what the Dossier alleges happened almost immediately after the Trump Tower Deal fell through.  @carterwpage knows all about this.  Trump allegedly was offered brokerage of a 19% sale in Russian oil company Rosneft.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich If Lincoln were alive today, he'd call you a "motherf-----"
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich How can you claim to be being treated "unfairly" when you cheated to win an election.  You illegally paid off a porn star so that she wouldn't tell the world you slept with her when married to Melania.  You were planning to build a Trump tower in Russia during the election!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I’m old enough to remember that Trump said he would defeat ISIS in a month.  Does anyone else remember that?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump’s ego is too big for him to admit his lie.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, it’s so sad.  My prayers go out to them. ISIS needs to be stopped.  Are you ready to admit that you lied about defeating them yet?

Multiple Democrats are Now Talking Impeachment https://t.co/7qFOjiewRF
In the past 2 days we learned:	- Trump told his attorney to lie to Congress.	- Cohen paid money to rig polls to be in favor of Trump.	- Trump's administration talked about separating families as a way to deter immigration and then did it		These should all be impeachable offenses!
Trump traveled overseas during the shutdown when he visited Iraq, so his lame excuse for telling Nancy Pelosi that her overseas trip is "postponed" due to the government shutdown pure nonsense!		The President is acting like a 4 year old brat because he lost a game of Go Fish!
There are three things that I will guarantee:		-- We will hit a Recession before the 2020 Election.	-- Donald Trump Jr. will be Indicted.	-- Donald Trump will be Impeached.		Mark this tweet!
Jesus Christ would tear down a wall, and give immigrants the shirt off of his back.  		I know this, and I'm Jewish.		What the hell has happened to Christianity in America?
I find it ironic that the same people who acted like the Buzzfeed story was no big deal, are now acting like the President is redeemed now that Mueller contradicted parts of the report.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I think once you turn on your country to support an enemy nation, you can no longer be considered an American.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The only foolish thing is the orange blob in the Oval Office.
@realDonaldTrump Your fear mongering doesn’t work on people who have a brain.  We are not suffering from a humanitarian crisis.  We are suffering from a presidential crisis.
When it came to political polling, Trump cheated.	When it came to his marriage, Trump cheated.	When it came to his business, Trump cheated.	When it came to fundraising, Trump cheated.		When it came to his election, what do you think Trump did?		Once a cheater always a cheater!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Will you change your opinion once Mueller releases the documents that prove this to be true?
In case you missed it, Republicans voted to allow Putin-buddy and Russia Oligarch Oleg Deripaska to get paid for his business in the U.S. while they are blocking U.S. federal employees from being paid.		If you still think Republicans have our best interests at heart, think again!
Am I wrong to think that rigging political polls in order to help you win an election should be illegal and that ordering an attorney to lie to 	Congress should result in an impeachment conviction, followed by a criminal indictment?		This isn't rocket science!		Who's with me?
It’s about time!	https://t.co/7qFOjiewRF
"Pro-Life" should mean more than just protecting fetuses.		It should include standing up to enemies who kill our journalists.		It should include keeping children with their families, not tearing them apart!		It should mean protecting lives from gun violence!		Who's with me?
So tomorrow at 3pm Trump will declare a national emergence on ‘prayer rugs’.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse TRUMP’s DHS Secretary said under oath that the administration did not have a policy of separating families.  Turns out a leaked document says otherwise.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If he declares a national emergency, a future Democratic President will declare climate change a national emergency, or healthcare a national emergency.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It’s not a humanitarian crisis!  Stop with the fear mongering
BREAKING:  The Supreme Court has just thrown out arguments in Trump's appeal in regards to his attempt to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.		Take that you racist bigot!		Another win for America!
WOW!  The NYTimes has just confirmed that the White House leaked a secret plan for Nancy Pelosi to fly to Afghanistan commercially.  This means that Trump purposely put Pelosi's life in danger for political gain.  		Where are you pro-lifers now?
Instead of talking about "Baby Hitler", @benshapiro and America should be talking about:		- The babies Trump tore from their families.		- The babies who don't get the healthcare they need.		- The babies who won't have food on their tables if Trump's shutdown lasts much longer!

@realDonaldTrump Without the FBI and Mueller our country would fall to our enemy, Russia.  Thank you to ALL law enforcement!
@realDonaldTrump Why aren’t you tweeting about the American heroes killed by ISIS in Syria?
@realDonaldTrump Agreed!  Especially thanks to ROBERT Mueller!
If the Buzzfeed report is true, and Mueller actually has the evidence that they claim he does, then there is no doubt that the President of the United States is a criminal.		What do we do with criminals?		We indict them and we send them to prison.		IMPEACH!	INDICT!	LOCK HIM UP!
@realDonaldTrump I like how you have seemingly abandoned "WITCH HUNT!!" now that Rudy Giuliani basically admitted that this is not a witch hunt!
@realDonaldTrump How can you honestly claim "AMERICA FIRST" when you directed your attorney to lie to your own Legislative Branch of Government in order to protect yourself and protect Russia?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump IMPEACH TRUMP	INDICT TRUMP
@ChidiNwatu @realDonaldTrump More like America First, after Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and about a half a dozen other nations.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It's amazing that Trump continues to tell the American people lies that they can see with their own eyes not to be true, yet his base still believes him over their own eyes and ears.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It's just a question of who will get Trump first:  Mueller or Democrats in Congress.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Maybe the GOP just seems unified to Trump since the White House is a complete mess.
@realDonaldTrump PANIC TWEETING!
@realDonaldTrump MAKE AMERICA FREE OF LYING PRESIDENTS AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump There are literally over half a dozen Republicans in Congress who are completely against your shutdown as a means to get your dumb wall built.  The Republicans are not unified one bit, but the Democrats are a finely tuned machine ready to investigate your crimes.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It’s perjury to lie, not to tell the truth. Cohen has no incentive to continue lying.
We are LIVE talking about today’s bombshell BuzzFeed report that Trump appears to have committed a federal crime, and we are commenting on Trumps insane tweets in real time.	 https://t.co/dY1cf85LyQ

@realDonaldTrump What ever happened to the last Caravan?  Did they all enter the country illegally?  		Answer:  NO!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @JimInhofe Call it what it is:  THE ORANGE MAN SHUTDOWN!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @JimInhofe Republicans know that Democrats are trying to re-open the government.  Even many Republicans are trying to do the same, but Trump's buddy Mitch McConnell refuses to allow it.
@realDonaldTrump @JimInhofe How can anyone believe that the Democrats are keeping the government closed when Trump is the one who closed it down, and Trump is the one who refuses to open it.  You can open the government without having to agree one way or another on the border! Facts matter!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi was traveling for the good of this country.  Trump was traveling to the southern border in order to help spread his rhetoric and hate of non-white people.  Melania was traveling to get away from her husband.
@realDonaldTrump Why did you travel to Iraq while 800,000 Americans were not being paid?  Why did Melania travel to Mar-a-Lago while 800,000 Americans were not being paid?  Answer that before you question others!

@Shahooster @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump HELLO IMPEACHMENT!  I guarantee Trump will be impeached, and I guarantee members of the Trump family will be indicted.
Who the hell cares if there are "prayer rugs" found at the southern border?  Is it now illegal to pray?  No religion ranks higher than another in the U.S. Constitution, so what the hell does a "prayer rug" have to do with anything other than proving Trump's Islamophobia?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump 18 U.S. Code § 1622 - Subornation of perjury		Whoever procures another to commit any perjury is guilty of subornation of perjury, and shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Did you ever think that perhaps these "prayer rugs" were really sleeping mats, considering these people trekked 4000 miles over the course of weeks?  Where else do you think they slept?
@realDonaldTrump The only question that remains is: ‘when you instructed Michael Cohen to commit perjury, were you eating a Big Mac, a Whopper or a Fish Taco from Taco Bell?’  		They don’t have good fast food in prison, so hopefully you enjoyed it.
@BillOReilly Why don't you care that Donald Trump instructed Michael Cohen to commit perjury?  If this was Obama, you'd be going mad!
Over the past 2 yrs we've been debating whether or not Trump firing James Comey met the threshold for "Obstruction of Justice"? 		Now you can throw all that out of the window. If this BuzzFeed report is true, Trump committed a felony and it’s time to IMPEACH &amp; INDICT NOW!
Given the BuzzFeed revelations that Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress, I'm calling on William Barr to drop his nomination as AG, given his comments this week admitting that it would be a crime if the president tried to 'coach someone to testify falsely.'		Who's with me?
BOOM! If this report is valid, President Trump has now officially committed an impeachable crime and should face up to 5 years in prison.  Say it with me America!		"It's time to IMPEACH Trump!"	https://t.co/F0BcwX330P

@SteveKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Actually I have interviewed 100s of people on the border and a 70%+ feel this way.

@seanhannity Why is Trump's administration getting paid during the shutdown?  He's the one who shut the government down, you big hypocrite!
@thewallmaker @AOC Yes and these arguments all have no facts to back them up.  The highest marginal tax rates after the Great Depression were at 90%.  This helped promote economic growth, not deter it.  The only people who think it's immoral are those who are immoral.
BREAKING:  According to a new survey from @thehill and @Harris_X_ 59% of Americans support @AOC's 70% marginal tax rate on those making over $10 million.  Even 45% of Republicans support it.		No, @seanhannity, this is NOT socialism.  It is what Americans want!

@realDonaldTrump Why is your administration getting paid when you are not paying those who you put out of jobs?
@charliekirk11 Obama didn't try to build a Trump Tower using a sanctioned Russian bank.  Obama didn't send an aid to Russia to speak to Igor Sechin about Rosneft.  Obama didn't secretly meet with Putin and ask an interpreter to throw out the notes. The list goes on and on and on.
@MZHemingway Umm, no they didn't....  The FBI investigated Trump because there was cause to believe he may have committed a crime.
@PARISDENNARD Most of the people living on the southern border are against the wall.  Nice try!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump just wanted to have all-you-can-eat fast food without the media criticizing him for being so unhealthy.
@realDonaldTrump What the heck is wrong with you?  Why are you serving college kids fast food at the White House?  This is disgusting!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Democrats aren't the "party of crime".  They are the "party with a brain".  They know that a wall is not the solution to border security.  Border security and a wall are not mutually exclusive like you would like Americans to believe.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump There are over 100 criminal counts against the Trump administration.  There have been multiple guilty pleas, convictions indictments.  All of these people are likely Republicans.  How many Democratic politicians have been indicted during this time?
@realDonaldTrump Every polls I see shows that most Americans do not support your stupid wall and the majority of Americans blame you for this horrific shutdown.  FACTS MATTER fool!
@outofcontroljb @krassenstein It could be but I don't want to group all of these people together.  I'm sure many racists don't like dumb people, and many dumb people don't like rich selfish people.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Come on Brian.... They aren't all dumb.  Some are just racist, or selfish.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This is exactly what I said Brian.  The vast majority of those entering the country illegally are doing so at legal ports of entry.  They are smuggled in via cars, as are the drugs.
@realDonaldTrump What ever happened to the last Caravan?  Why aren't all those people now in America?  Oh that's right, because we don't need a wall!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump BMW has threatened to cut jobs and move production out of the USA.  Why don't you tweet about this, Mr. Trump?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Meanwhile Trump's tariffs are causing many U.S. car makers to think about moving overseas.
@realDonaldTrump Are you sure it's Tennessee this time?  Yesterday you claimed you were going to Nashville, but it turned out you were really visiting New Orleans.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I'm sure Fox News will report on it because it's one of a few things that doesn't actually make you look bad.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Or the 30,000+ Vets who are homeless, and would love some of the $5 billion you seek for your lame wall in order to get back on their feet?
@realDonaldTrump This is all great.  Unemployment is low in general, and it's on the exact same downward trend line that started 9 1/2 years ago under Obama.		Thanks @BarackObama
@00evidence @realDonaldTrump You are right. Many FBI members are not happy with what Comey did, but they are furious with how Trump has done nothing but disrespect them and essentially take away America's trust in the agency.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Remember when Trump called @HillaryClinton crooked?	LOLOLOLOLOL!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It's not called "spying" when there is an active investigation.  "Spying" would better explain what they were investigating.... spying on behalf of Russia, you cheesy asset!
@realDonaldTrump Actually most people in the FBI that I know or have spoken to as a journalist side with James Comey over you.  Facts Matter
In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to keep an ice cream cone in your back pocket on Sundays (no joke!), but it is perfectly legal for a licensed individual to openly carry an AR-15 into a bar, airport or school. 		Are we really this stupid?

Here's an idea Mr.Trump. If you want to put tariffs on something, put YUGE tariffs on the importation of guns &amp; ammunition. 1/3 of our nation's guns are imported from other countries.		While you are at it, also put a large tax on American-made guns &amp; give this revenue to schools.
Please keep calling me a snowflake.  I like being different than the next person. Every snowflake is unique. They all come from the same place, but are able to establish their own identities, free and clear of any other snowflake. Snowflakes make this world beautiful.
Dear Conservatives:		You don't accept lies from your children. You don't accept lies from your friends, your colleagues, or your employer. 		You didn't accept lies from Obama, Bush, Clinton or Reagan.		So why do you blindly accept lies from President Trump?

Trump, on his stupid wall: “You have to have see through. You have to know what's on the other side of the wall.”		I propose an idea!		We tell Trump that we built an invisible wall &amp; Mexico paid for it.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Lindsey graham just provided a proposal to reopen the government and Trump turned it down.  He’s a clown.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I don’t think Trump is sure about anything.
@realDonaldTrump You said it was Nashville this morning.  I guess it was just your dementia talking.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump hates facts	We love facts	America loves facts
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I just hope no cows step on Trump manure.
@realDonaldTrump I recall you putting farmers out of work with your tariffs.  Then you bailed them out with our taxpayer dollars.  What a mess you are!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Nothing has changed from between when Trump said the shutdown could be blamed on himself, until now.  So how can it now be the Democrats' fault?  		Answer:  IT CAN'T
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't want the government to open.  He just wants to create as much chaos as he can as more and more evidence comes to light that he may have worked on behalf of Russia.
@realDonaldTrump You can end it in 1 second, if you stopped being such a narcissist!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Both Democrats and Republicans know Trump is wrong.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Democrats have already gotten to work -- just not on the things Trump's ego demands.  They are working to investigate all of Trump's crimes, and it will be glorious.
@realDonaldTrump You've been waiting all weekend for nothing, because Democrats are not going to cave to your pathetic demands.  You can end the shutdown without ending the debate.  Stop making Americans suffer because of your ego!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump .... But her emails...
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends We have to remember that Putin is actually a smart guy.  Of course he's going to tell Trump not to appear to be his asset.  We aren't stupid.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Oil prices being low might hurt Russia a little bit, but it's only short term.  Lifting sanctions is long term.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Can you explain why you planned a Trump Tower in Moscow using a sanctioned Russian bank, or why Carter Page went to Moscow to meet with Igor Sechin when that deal fell through, and why Rosneft sold 19% after the Dossier said you would get brokerage fees from a 19% sale?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Brian, don't forget that Ivana Trump once alleged that Donald raped her while they were married.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Brian, you know the answer......  I don't think I have to say it.
@realDonaldTrump If this is the case than why were you in a hotel room with Stormy Daniels when you should have been home with your wife?
@realDonaldTrump Don't you understand that illegal entry into the US at the southern border is down significantly?  The United States is not going to cease to exist. We will just become stronger and stronger as we add greater diversity.
I love how everyone on the right is so quick to condemn George Soros for spending his own money to support certain Democrats, yet they don't blink an eye when the NRA is accused to using Russian money to pay Republicans to supporting deadly assault rifles and Putin.
If “thoughts and prayers” work so well, why doesn't Trump just pray for his stupid wall?
I have a brilliant idea... How about we allow facts to determine if Trump broke the law, instead of allowing Trump to decide if he broke the law?

@AndrewFeinberg If Trump was working against the US on behalf of Russia, would this not be considered treason?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The sooner Mueller releases his report, the sooner we can get this fool out of the White House.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump’s tweets are getting more and more absurd by the hour.
@realDonaldTrump You are like a lonely old man bragging about how green your lawn is.
President Trump continues to attack Hillary Clinton for one reason and one reason only.  He knows she is the legitimate President and he wants to convince himself that he is more deserving of the office which he stole.
For all the talk of “Fake News” coming from Trump, it’s Fox News that is the real culprit.
For Mueller, my feelings are that the question is no longer "IF" Trump conspired against the U.S., but rather how many other members of the RNC, Congress and the Senate were also part of the Conspiracy.  Just wait and see.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes, and other sneak in on boats.  The vast vast majority of undocumented immigrants and those here illegally are NOT going to be stopped by a border wall.  A wall is just a metaphor for Trump bigotry.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Thousands of Americans have killed children using semi-automatic assault rifles.  This is a much larger national emergency and humanitarian crisis than immigrants seeking refuge in America.  Use that money to help stop gun violence instead of building a wall!
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews These criminals are mostly coming in in cars and trucks through legal ports of entry.  A WALL WON'T WORK!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The more chaos there is, the less America talks about him working on behalf of Russia.  Trump knows how to distract the country and he knows that Mueller has all of the evidence needed to prosecute his children and make a tremendous case for impeachment.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump continues to ignore the facts, because the facts don't convince people that his stupid wall is needed.  Facts show that a wall would be a waste of money.  We should be using that funding to increase security at our ports of entry.
@realDonaldTrump The thing is though, if this is the case, you can still open the government and then continue debating the border.  Also, 99.9% of those drugs are coming in via means that a border will not protect us from.
Mike Pence 3 days ago: DACA is not on the negotiating table until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in.		Donald Trump today:  Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don’t want to include in talks. 		ANOTHER LIE FROM TRUMP!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump knows that he can't win this.  He knows that his Art of the Deal ended up being a Fart of a Deal.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Mike Pence said that DACA was off the table.  Now Trump says that Democrats have given up on DACA.  Which is it? Seems like just another lie to me.  #7342?
@_casey__jones_ @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Let's keep in mind that Mike Pence literally just said that DACA is off the table.  The President and Vice President aren't even on the same page.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The solution to stopping undocumented immigrants from sneaking in and drugs from being smuggled in, is not to build a wall.  You need to increase border security at ports of entry where most of this illegal stuff is taking place.  Please just read the facts for once!
@realDonaldTrump We don't care how lonely you are.  You are by yourself in the White House because you scared all of your allies and friends away.  Meanwhile Mitch McConnell went home and 4 Republicans have decided you are wrong.  Give up.  You lost this battle!
@realDonaldTrump Why is it that most border towns have lower crime than the rest of the country?  Why is it that El Paso, Texas has some of the lowest crime in the nation, yet it is on the border?  Immigrants are NOT more likely to commit crimes.  It's actually the opposite!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The Art of the Deal, Brian, the Art of the Deal.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This is coming from a crooked President who is being investigated for working on behalf of Russia.
@realDonaldTrump No, Democrats are saying that your Wall is not worth it.  You are trying to bribe them with DACA.  How about releasing those conversations you had with Putin?
Both Mueller and House Democrats need to take a long look into @seanhannity, and the possibility that he could have been one of the back channels Russia and Trump used to communicate.  Trump takes Hannity's advice,  so has Russia utilized this situation to their own benefit?
@AOC Thank you for the time you put into this.  We need more House Representatives who are as committed to their jobs as you are.  Keep up the great work!

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld These are all Trump lovers who claim to be fair media, but they are the real “fake news.”
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld The country is waiting on you to open the government.  Stop telling us how lonely you are and open the government.
Why is it so hard for people to believe that a man who lied 7000 times, cheated on all of his wives, allegedly raped one wife, and committed election fraud to become president, wouldn't lie about being a Russian asset?
Impeachment &amp; indictment of Trump should be a great concern if it's proven he conspired with Russia against the United States of America.		What should be an even greater concern, however, is how we go about quickly reversing all of his pro-Russia policies &amp;  how we punish Putin.
Enough with this foreign asset!  I just want my tan-suit @BarackObama back!
If an American citizen can be thrown behind bars for years for smoking pot, then I say the President of the United States should be thrown behind bars for life if it's proven that he acted on behalf of our enemy to undermine the United States of America.
If Mueller shows proof of crimes, which now seems pretty obviously, Trump needs to be indicted and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.		Otherwise criminal presidents will be a norm in America.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Not only would it damage the environment.  It will damage the perception of America as a country, walling ourselves off from our allies.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Elections have consequences -- especially when you work with a foreign adversary to rig one.
@realDonaldTrump Here you go again, complaining about how lonely you are.  Maybe if you weren't such a prick, you would have more friends and allies. 		As your wife once said:		“I really don’t care, do u?”
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump As is the mind of the U.S. President.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump If there is a "strategy for this shutdown", maybe it's time that you tell us what it is because it obviously is NOT working!

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Also, El Paso, Texas, a border town where @BetoORourke is congressman, has one of the lowest crime rates in America.  Explain that Mr. Brilliant!
@realDonaldTrump That's because violent crimes are not federal crimes.  They are usually state crimes.  Being an undocumented immigrant, not seeking asylum is considered a federal crime.  That's why the federal prisons have such a large percentage of undocumented immigrants, fool!

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Wouldn’t you be flustered too, if you discovered the FBI knew about your TREASON almost 2 years ago?  I can’t wait until Mueller releases the evidence.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The only humanitarian crisis at the border is the one the Trump administration created by going against court orders and breaking the laws of his own country.
@realDonaldTrump Mitch McConnel went home.  Why aren’t you calling him back?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn’t realize that we live in a democracy where we are all afforded our own political opinions.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Wouldn’t you be unhinges too if you knew that you were being investigated for TREASON?  Imagine what he will do when Mueller proves it.
@realDonaldTrump Remember the OIG has debunked this.  Turns out this was just another conspiracy theory started by you and your Republican allies.
FACT:  President Trump is now responsible for the longest government shutdown in American history.		Are you happy now, GOP?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump What Russia always wanted was sanctions relief.  Trump is giving that to them now.  The great thing about all this is that Mueller likely knows everything.  At this point, it wouldn't surprise me with a pee-pee tape really existed.  Would it surprise anyone?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He was literally going to build Trump Tower in Moscow using a sanctioned Russian bank.  That deal failed so he then allegedly sent Carter Page to Moscow to exchange sanctions relief for hundreds of millions of dollars in brokerage fees from the sale of Rosneft.
@realDonaldTrump Is this why you are lifting sanctions on Oleg Deripaska's companies?  Deripaska is Putin's right-hand man.
President Trump is being investigated for working on behalf of an American adversary, and all that Republicans can do is thank him for trying to take away their healthcare coverage, jailing children, killing the environment, and lying to them 7000+ times since taking office.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Brian, when the Mueller report is released, we should hang out an pop a bottle of bubbly.  It will be EPIC.  Who else wants to come?
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I love how Trump keeps referring to "collusion" on behalf of the Democrats.  Does he really believe that Democrats colluded with Russia in order to lose the election?  I mean come on!  We are not stupid!
@realDonaldTrump If James Comey and Hillary Clinton were so "crooked" then why is it you, and not them, who has the label "Individual-1" tied to your name?  		I hope that future history books refuse to mention you by your real name, and instead simply list you are FAKE-President Individual-1.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Come on Brian!  "Crooked" is the biggest understatement ever.  I'm greatly disappointed in you as my brother.		The phrase is "HORRIFIC CRIMINAL"
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Every time he tweets about "James Comey", Twitter should automatically replace it with "I'm sitting on the toilet right now because I am so nervous".
@realDonaldTrump Wait, so you are mad because James Comey didn't record an interview with Hillary Clinton, yet you refuse over and over again to sit down for an interview yourself.		That's what I call hypocrisy!		Hillary sat down because she was innocent.		You refuse to because you are not!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump That’s all that Trump can do.  He thinks that if he makes Hillary look like a criminal, then he will look less like a criminal.  That’s not how the law works though.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump And none of these people went on national TV and begged Russia to hack their opponent’s emails.  By the way, the very next day, Russia began hacking the DNC emails.
@realDonaldTrump And funny thing is that you want us to believe that you fired him for investigating Hillary.  Yeah right!
@Butterfy123456 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @benjaminwittes Correct.  Trump needed Russia and they knew it.  That’s why when the Trump Tower deal fell through, Carter Page met with Igor Sechin to allegedly make a deal for 19% brokerage of Rosneft in exchange for sanctions relief.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @benjaminwittes Don’t forget he was also working on a deal to open Trump Tower in Moscow, using a sanctioned Russian bank. The deal would have required that he lift sanctions.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It is called TREASON!
@realDonaldTrump There was plenty of reason to open the investigation.  You fired the FBI Director because you didn’t want him to investigate you committing treason.

@Kaytickety13 It “was opened”.  It may very well still be ongoing.

@Jim_Jordan @RepKatieHill No we don’t.  We think that barriers in prone areas are helpful, not a 2000 mile wall.  There is a difference.  The real solution is more security at ports of entry.
Trump just claimed he witnessed a 'humanitarian crisis' at the border, which is 'far worse than anyone would understand'.  		Problem is, the media was there and they didn't witness this horrific crisis.  Not even @FoxNews has footage of a crisis.		Caught in another lie!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke And then we can build a wall of steel slats around Donald Trump, Don Jr. and Jared Kusher.  We can call it the PRISON WALL.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump No other previous administrations were ignorant enough to think that a wall would be the solution.  Trump is the only one who believes this!
@realDonaldTrump Actually it’s not dangerous at all, and definitely not a "Humanitarian Crisis". Just ask @BetoORourke, who is a Representative in El Paso -- a border town, that happens to be one of the safest cities in America!  	FACTS MATTER! 	YOU LIE!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The only invasion that took place was Russia’s invasion of the US through the use of a puppet to take the Oval Office from the people.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This is the same type of propaganda that Putin uses to hold onto power.  Trump is blatantly lying and his base is believing every word.

It’s no longer a question of IF there was a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but rather how many criminal acts took place, how many U.S. Citizens were complicit, and how many combined years in prison the Trump crime family will be sentenced to.
@MarkWarner Keep in mind that Jared Kushner was in charge of Trump's data strategy, so there is a good chance he knew about this collusion, and possibly even gave the date to Manafort to pass along.  The Senate needs to subpoena Jared Kushner.

They need to create a rule in Congress that if the Senate Majority leader refuses to hold a floor vote in regards to a particular bill, the rest of the Senate can overrule him/her with a simple majority vote.  		Who's with me on this?
If the Russians used the polling data provided by Paul Manafort to Kilimnik in order to try and help Trump win the election, this likely would implicate many Trump campaign team members in a criminal conspiracy, possibly including Kushner, Don Jr. and the Mafia Kingpin himself.
BREAKING: Chuck Schumer just shut Trump down with one line: “The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a 30 foot wall.”		Boom!
BREAKING: Nancy Pelosi just destroyed Trump with a fact check — Trump’s worst enemy.		Democrats - 1	Mafia Boss - 0
BREAKING: Trump just asked why politicians build walls around their homes if barriers are immoral.		Why can’t this fool understand the difference between a security wall for a personal home and a racist hate wall for a country?
BREAKING: Trump just said 90% of heroine comes from the southern border.  The problem is, a wall won’t stop the majority of this because it’s coming in through the mail and through legal ports of entry.
The solution to fixing illegal border crossings and drugs smuggling is not to build a wall.  It is to reinforce the legal ports of entry with better technology, drug dogs and more personnel.  #TrumpAddress
77 years ago Hitler built a wall		Just saying... #TrumpAddress
Today’s Paul Manafort slip-up is proof that Mueller knows a lot more than the public. If it wasn’t for the fact that Manafort’s lawyers were incompetent in redacting their filings,  the public would not know that Manafort Colluded with Russia in giving polling info to Russia.
How is it a "national emergency" when refugees come to America seeking a better life, but it's not a "national emergency" when the President of the United States continues to defy court orders by keeping children locked in cages, separated from their parents for months on end?
But his emails.... https://t.co/Qsybt1xOs0
@IngrahamAngle So are you saying you don’t care about facts?
With today's Paul Manafort and Natalia Veselnitskaya bombshells:		Do you know who didn't share campaign data with the Russians?	- Hillary Clinton!		Do you know whose campaign team  &amp; family members didn't meet with a now-indicted Russian co-conspirator?	- Hillary Clinton!
The day after Paul Manafort met with Kilimnik to shared polling data (Aug 2, 2016), the Trump Tower server to Alfa Bank went crazy. https://t.co/IEzc4o9BRt
RT @ScottMStedman: THE DAY AFTER that Manafort met with Kilimnik and shared polling data (Aug 2, 2016), @DonaldJTrumpJr, Erik Prince, and G…
The wall isn't about stopping terrorism.		The wall is about separating brown people from white people, no matter how endangered the lives of innocent children become.		Trump is a racist!	His wall is racist!	#BoycottTrumpPrimeTime
While Trump is considering declaring a fake national emergency, House and Senate Democrats are planning to try and pass universal background checks on firearms as a means to try and fix the real national emergency. Thank you Democrats!
Now that we know that Paul Manafort colluded with Russia by sharing campaign polling date, the only question that remains is: Who knew and when did they know it?		Jared Kushner?	Don Jr.?	Ivanka?	Eric Trump?	Mike Pence?	Corey Lewandowski?	DONALD TRUMP?		They all could go down!
With today's news that Paul Manafort gave 2016 Presidential campaign polling data to Russian agent Konstantin Kilimnik, let's recall that Kilimnik is a business associate with Oleg Deripaska who Trump is set to lift sanctions on.		The conspiracy is right in front of our eyes!
The real "national emergency" is the fact that our authoritarian president continues to break U.S. law by keeping terrified, innocent children separated from their parents.		If you don't think that's an emergency, then you need to reevaluate your morals. #BoycottTrumpPrimeTime
BREAKING:  Bernie Sanders will deliver a response to Trump's address tonight at 9:30PM on Youtube, Twitter and Facebook Live.		In other words, Bernie will fact check the hell out of Trump's lies and rhetoric.
Today we learned	- Don Jr., Kushner &amp; Manafort met with a Russian operative who has now been indicted in a Russian conspiracy, in order to get dirt on Hillary.	- Manafort shared 2016 campaign data with a Russian Agent.		THERE WAS COLLUSION!
This is Huge.  Mueller seems to believe that Manafort shared 2016 election date with a Russian intel agent.  		Can you say COLLUSION?	https://t.co/Y09UKyOhUM
@Toure What's your source?

Let’s be clear, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner met with a Russian operative who has been indicted in a Russian conspiracy, and then lied about the meeting.  		Everyone should take this seriously!
Taxing the super wealthy at a high marginal tax rate is not a "radical idea". It's actually part of U.S. history. The radicals are the ones who think that the super wealthy should not be taxed at a higher marginal tax rate, while the middle class struggles to feed their families.
Turns out that The Russian woman at the Trump Tower meeting appears to be a criminal!  No surprise here! https://t.co/tDWvP6pgpX
When Robert Mueller releases his report to Congress, the same TV networks airing Trump's prime time address tonight, better be willing to allow Democrats in Congress to address the nation on Mueller's findings. #BoycottTrumpPrimeTime
BREAKING: NYC Mayor Announces Health Care Coverage For All https://t.co/cCWuzPqgnP
Even though Republicans tried to stop this, 1.4 Million Floridians with past felony convictions now have the right to vote. Please help spread the word, no matter where you live, so that each and every one of these people registers to vote, via this link.	https://t.co/EKWk1uuMFW
To @FoxNews,	Will you air the Democratic Response to Trump's Propaganda speech tonight, or will you simply admit that you are only "Trump TV?"
Something fishy seems to be going on here. https://t.co/HZugP1x5TF
@realDonaldTrump Instead of talking football, maybe you should be working on opening the U.S. government.
BREAKING:  Racist Corey Stewart has just announced that he is quitting politics.		Good riddance to a bad person!		I really don't care, do u?
@DanRather I think it's more along the lines of: "Trump IS a stupid man BECAUSE he has bad luck when thinking."		As in, the neurons are not connecting to one another.
The Trump administration simply DOES NOT CARE! https://t.co/qvvSCQy99h
In 2014, an Obama address on immigration was not covered by most TV networks because it was seen as being too political. Now Trump, who has told 7,000 lies to the American public is doing the same &amp; these same networks are covering his propaganda.		This is how far we have fallen!
@realDonaldTrump Just because you say it over and over again, doesn't make it true!
@realDonaldTrump "'I’m going backwards instead of forwards,' said steelworker David Horton. He has been off the job without pay since August 22."

@realDonaldTrump Here is a reminder that the Dow is still down 3,300+ points from its peak.  That's not "Really good" in my book.
Any TV network that airs Prime-time Trump without fact-checking him live is doing America a great disservice.  We are literally watching our country morph into Russia as I type this tweet. Americans deserve the truth, not lies and propaganda from a dictator wannabe!
Prime-time Trump = Prime-time lies, Prime-time hatred, &amp; Prime-time propaganda.  Trump wants Americas ears so that he can convince them of his lies.
Donald Trump, who had 5 kids (that we know of) with 3 wives (one of which was an immigrant), actually had the guts to accuse immigrants of "breeding".
I'm loving Adam Schiff already! https://t.co/5fSAXrQlWr
Tomi Lahren is a racist! https://t.co/fy9YH2IL16
It used to be a Big Deal When The President Lied to the American Public.  Now it's just expected.	SAD!!
Trumpsters claimed that the Steele Dossier was "debunked" because Cohen didn't visit Prague and because Trump didn't spend the night in Moscow.		NOW There's evidence:	1) Michael Cohen DID visit Prague.	2) Donald Trump DID spend the night in Moscow.		The Dossier is REAL!
Dear Conservatives:	You don't accept lies from your children. You don't accept lies from your friends, your colleagues, or your employer. 		You didn't accept lies from Obama, Bush, Clinton or Reagan.		So why do you blindly accept lies from President Trump?
Just Admit it!		If you're a Trump supporter, you don't care about conservative ideology.  		You care about Trump ideology, whether it's conservative, liberal, autocratic, fascist, racist, sexist, corrupt or even against your own best interests.		That's not politics	THAT'S A CULT!
The alt-right is going too far, and the rest of the Republican party is falling in line https://t.co/amGGniTBBd
Mark my words: @BetoORourke will emerge as the Democratic front runner within the next 4 months.
There is a national emergency in America.  It’s not at the southern border.  It comes in the form of the orange colored marionette in the White House that is being controlled by Vladimir Putin. #BoycottTrumpsAddress
For those of you criticizing @AOC's 70% marginal tax rate on people earning $10 million+, Keep in mind that if someone were to make $10,000,001, they would only be paying $0.70 extra in tax. If you think this is unfair, tell that to the starving children.
FACT:  Unless you consider a hangnail to be a medical emergency, or a raindrop to be an environmental emergency, there is no national emergency at our border. #BoycottTrumpsAddress
4 of the top 5 causes of death in America are Heart Disease, Cancer, Respiratory illness and Stroke.		Instead of wasting $5.6 billion on a wall that might cause more people to die, how about spending it on healthcare so that we can cause more people to live? #BoycottTrumpsAddress
We have gotten  #BoycottTrumpsAddress to trend in the US!  Keep it going!
When immigrants cross the border to protect their families, that's NOT a "humanitarian crisis".		When you try to prevent them from doing so, that IS the "humanitarian crisis".		President Trump is the "humanitarian crisis".	#BoycottTrumpsAddress
Someone please tell Trump that he already looks very very very weak! #BoycottTrumpsAddress  https://t.co/Rcf7zQgIZw
Tomorrow night President Trump will address the nation from the Southern Border, to tell us more lies and spread more hatred and propaganda.  I'm calling on everyone to Boycott Trump's Address, and spread this hashtag if you will not watch!	#BoycottTrumpsAddress
Trust me!  Robert Mueller is not allowing any stone to go unturned. https://t.co/Z46rMqcYa9
BREAKING: President Trump just announced that at 9:00PM tomorrow night he will address the nation from the Southern Border.		I urge all TV networks not to air his address.  Doing so will help him spread his lies and propaganda.		Who's with me on this?
