To carry out these strategies, we need to #RaiseTheCaps so we can adequately #InvestinKIds.
Over 17% of our nation‚Äôs children lived in poverty in 2017, according to the US Census Bureau. Child poverty costs the U.S. over $1 trillion a year, therefore everyone benefits from strategies that lift children out of poverty. #ValueOurKids
We know #CutsHurt. Instead, we should make our children a top priority and #InvestinKIds so they all have a fair chance to succeed.
Without another healthy, bipartisan agreement to #RaiseTheCaps, non-defense discretionary spending will drop by $55 Billion in FY 2020, resulting in significant funding decreases for critical programs serving children and working families.
Today‚Äôs @HouseBudgetDems hearing is an important reminder that we need to #RaiseTheCaps if we want to #InvestInKids. But as we explained at the 2018 budget summit -- a lot of the budget process disadvantages children and needs major changes. Learn more: https://t.co/2hQEueVlzH

Children are nearly 1/4 of the US population, but receive just 8% of the federal budget--which is no surprise, given that so many children‚Äôs programs rely on NDD funding. To #InvestInKids, we need to #RaiseTheCaps! See https://t.co/Yfub4Yv2gn for more.

These are just a few examples of countless ways in which the shutdown hurt families with children. We urge everyone to remind the White House and Congress that kids should be a priority, not political pawns. #InvestInKids #NoMoreShutdowns
Afterschool programs run by the National Park Service and the Smithsonian Institute stopped operating, and federal workers had to pay double in childcare fees because the daycares housed in federal buildings were closed
Here are just a few examples we heard from partners detailing the partial shutdown's fallout on kids: 2,500 SNAP retailers couldn't redeem benefits, and school districts started rationing fruits and vegetables out of fear they'd lose school meal funding in March
The partial shutdown did real harm to kids and families, from depriving federal workers of much needed paychecks to threatening access to SNAP benefits, housing assistance, tax refunds, and other supports that lift kids out of poverty: https://t.co/P9bMAnOJU0
We're relieved to see that the government is reopening. 800K federal workers and countless more Americans are desperate for relief. But a 3 week continuing resolution is not a long-term solution. The threat of yet another shutdown looms large. https://t.co/dfavR5AuQn

@HUDgov Among the groups joining for this statement: @SchoolHouseConn, @fpnational, @BassukCenter, @nn4youth, and the National Coalition for Homeless Solutions
@HUDgov The Homeless Children and Youth Act would streamline the definition of homelessness, leading to more accurate PIT counts. Pass #HCYA to make sure that children and families get the assistance they need.
@HUDgov More on this, current @HUDgov counts on homeless people in America are inaccurate because they leave out those in vulnerable housing situations ‚Äî such as sleeping on friends‚Äô couches or in motel rooms.
Data released today by @HUDgov grossly underestimates family and youth homelessness in the US.

For these reasons and more, more compromise on the issue of paid family leave is necessary. Here are 4 reasons why the FAMILY Act is a better option for children and families in the U.S. https://t.co/ryYrusIFuX
Paid family leave is about ensuring financial stability when time off is needed, which shouldn‚Äôt come at the expense of one's financial future. This is of particular concern for women, who on average get only $1,154 a month in retirement funds from Social Security, and new moms.
The Economic Security for New Parents Act makes it ‚Äúoptional‚Äù for workers to cash in on the paid leave benefit. This is worrisome because people may avoid taking leave in an attempt to preserve retirement funds. Lack of new-parental leave is harmful to children and families.
We appreciate bipartisan action from Sen. @MarcoRubio to address the lack of paid family leave in the U.S., but the solution is not to fund leave with parents' future Social Security benefits, which would hurt low-income families in the long-term. https://t.co/EvoESlF9uy

We are in the middle of the fiscal year and unforeseen events can still happen.		What kinds of unanticipated things might drive up need? (4)
@MickMulvaneyOMB @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer CHIP is a block grant so funding fails to adjust when need may rise. Thus, Congress added the contingency fund to CHIP in 2009 to prevent children from being placed on waiting lists due to economic recessions, natural disasters, or public health crises. (3)
@MickMulvaneyOMB @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer The proposal by Mulvaney to slash $1.9 billion out of the CHIP Contingency Fund threatened the health coverage of children because the contingency fund is there to protect against unforeseen or unanticipated events.

@dwjackson48 @Bob_Casey Wrong David! 		The $1.9 billion or 80% cut in the CHIP Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would have threatened the coverage of our nation‚Äôs children. 		CBO doesn‚Äôt score unanticipated or unforeseen events.  Ut that is the definition of a contingency fund. (1)

@QuinHillyer @spaceforcefa @SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks @realDonaldTrump @brithume That is, by the way, the very definition of a ‚Äúcontingency.‚Äù		By raiding those dollars in mid-year, Congress was threatening to put the health of children at risk. 		It was a gamble that unanticipated crises would not develop. #DontGambleWithHealthOfChildren (2) https://t.co/lJfsl7U2o0
@QuinHillyer @spaceforcefa @SenMikeLee @FreedomWorks @realDonaldTrump @brithume Except that is not true. 		The CHIP Child Enrollment Contingency Fund was targeted for a $1.9 billion, or 80%, cut in the middle fiscal year. Those dollars were not ‚Äúexpired‚Äù or ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù dollars, as they are there to protect children‚Äôs coverage due to unforeseen events. (1)
