As Insurance Commissioner, @MattRosendale is supposed to work for us. Instead, he raised $16k+ from junk insurance execs, cut himself a check, &amp; started pushing to expand plans like theirs that don‚Äôt have to cover pre-existing conditions.  https://t.co/N4nTYyTlPL #mtpol #mtsen

Mitch McConnell said gutting Medicare and Social Security is on the table post-election. @MattRosendale is backed by McConnell‚Äôs Super PAC and would rubber stamp McConnell‚Äôs swamp agenda, gutting programs that Montana seniors rely on. 	https://t.co/tAmV75Kjyb #mtpol #mtsen

7 DAYS: Most of you know I only have 7 fingers. But what people don't know is my folks paid the hospital bills because we had junk insurance &amp; it didn‚Äôt cover anything. @MattRosendale brought junk plans, which don‚Äôt have to cover pre-existing conditions, back to MT. #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/He1u3IfG0G
What‚Äôs worse than @mattrosendale rubber stamping rate hikes? Rosendale rubber stamping Mitch McConnell‚Äôs agenda: gutting Medicare &amp; ending pre-existing condition protections. 	Stop McConnell &amp; save health care. Vote by November 6th.	https://t.co/5Y3zKwoUBp #mtpol #mtsen

Mitch McConnell recently said cutting Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid was on the table for after the election. And @mattrosendale has agreed. Their agenda: gut the safety net and end protections for the 152,000 Montanans with pre-existing conditions. #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/4viGMtBWZl

8 DAYS: It‚Äôs clear why the Montana AFL-CIO gave @MattRosendale an 8% score in the legislature. He‚Äôs only looking out for himself, not the hardworking folks in Montana like the ones locked out in Three Forks. I‚Äôll never quit fighting for working Montanans. #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/1twO8Qe7qS

Montanans know that @mattrosendale took $16,600 from out-of-state junk insurance companies.

Access to health coverage is critical when you have a pre-existing condition. Take it from Kim in Helena, who, without insurance, would have to shell out over $1,000 each month to pay for the insulin she needs to live. #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/Uea6lUtQPN

Why would @mattrosendale promote short-term ‚Äújunk plans‚Äù that don‚Äôt cover pre-existing conditions?

Mitch McConnell admitted it -- he‚Äôs eyeing gutting Medicare and Social Security after the election. And McConnell needs @mattrosendale‚Äôs vote to get it done. Maybe that‚Äôs why McConnell‚Äôs Super PAC is spending so much propping up Rosendale. #mtpol #mtsen	https://t.co/5Y3zKwGvsX
As Insurance Commissioner, @MattRosendale has failed to hold insurance companies accountable. As State Auditor, he failed to crack down on bad actors. But THIS is what he considers to be the hardest part of his job: #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/x3M4FXqA9B

Protecting coverage for folks with pre-existing conditions isn‚Äôt a talking point. It‚Äôs how we help ensure 152,000 Montanans can get the care they need.

But that‚Äôs no surprise -- @MattRosendale even said that the Citizens United decision that opened the floodgates for unlimited dark money in our elections was a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù decision. https://t.co/AqZNAuVfBG #mtpol #mtsen
When @MattRosendale had the opportunity to listen to Montanans and stop the dark money flooding into Montana campaigns, he not only voted no - he stood up and spoke out against it! #mtpol #mtsen	https://t.co/4mwqxMoWOE https://t.co/QeFTjetOSB

First, @MattRosendale moved here from Maryland. Then he voted against cracking down on dark money in Montana's elections. He brought the swamp to Montana, and Montanans are furious. THREAD ‚¨áÔ∏è #mtpol #mtsen	https://t.co/4KyhPnl0SI

Montanans know that our public lands help make our state the Last Best Place. But @MattRosendale wouldn‚Äôt know anything about that. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs advocated for transferring federal public lands to the state. I think you should hear it from him: #mtpol #mtsen https://t.co/jenRKm1gGu
