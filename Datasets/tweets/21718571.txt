A lot of politicians may voice themselves as deficit hawks but their votes show otherwise @BPShow #BPShowLive
The deficit basically exploded under Ryan, he has been anything but a typical fiscal conservative @BPshow #BPShowLive
The GOP lost the midterms based on their policies @BPShow #BPShowLive
The House GOP is living in denial since the midterm elections @BPShow #BPShowLive
Trump dangled pardoning a key witness is a clear obstruction of justice and the acts of a person who is guilty @BPShow #BPShowLive
The Trump Tower meeting was more than likely a violation of the law. Donald Trump Jr. thinks himself he is going to be indicted @BPShow #BPShowLive
Mueller more than likely has all the goods. We know where this investigation is headed. It is heading directly towards Trump himself @BPShow #BPShowLive
The only reason why Trump has a security clearance is because he is President. He is potentially compromised. Russia knew about secret business dealings happening in Russia @BPShow #BPShowLive
Trump has been consistent about three issues during his political career, anti-trade, anti-immigration, and pro-Russia @BPShow #BPShowLive

It feels terrible because the leaked memo was designed to make Trans people feel less than equal. What's important is that Trans people are not going anywhere and the LGBTQ movement is not going anywhere. @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
Trans people have been successful in exercising their rights, it is a symbol of success against all odds. In this movement it is important for Trans people to not lose their power @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
Anti-Trans movement did not come out of nowhere, it has been a long-term campaign from the Heritage Foundation. This isn't something that has happened overnight, it is part of a larger movement. @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
Also, vote and get people are you to vote to support Trans rights @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
Questions are powerful things. On the local level hold entities accountable for protecting Trans people and Trans rights @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
If you are not Trans and White, you have a lot of privilege. Call your represents at all levels of government and express concern about the HSS memo the pressure will work @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
There is a window before everything happens and it is important to take advantage of that. @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
An administration that puts children in cages is capable of anything. @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The violent rhetoric of anti-Trans that has been promoted is already putting people's lives at risk. This has been in a works for a while now @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
A lot of people who are not Trans are going to be caught up in the removal of constitutional protections. It is a form a violence that could lead to actually violence @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The HHS memo will impact anybody who identifies as Trans @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The HHS memo suggests that there are only two genders. There are other possible combinations than just XX and XY @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
When it comes to issues like Medicare, especially with Trans healthcare, Obamacare. It is a patchwork. There's not going to be any safe space and many people will be at risk @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
What the leaked HHS memo means is removing an entire class of people from rights that are afforded by the constitution @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The line between male &amp; female are not certain. There is hardly a difference. The obsession with gender focuses on women, which sets a dangerous place for people in the United States, because it is not rooted in science and just myth @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
Everything that we know of scientifically that the lines between male and female is very thin. It is a tricky situation @imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The Trump administration wants to redefine sex as what you were born with at the time of birth. It is using biological determinizes as the basis of civil rights. It is a dangerous place to be for anyone @Imarajones @Thelastsip #Translash
The HHS memo essentially declares that it removes Trans people from having rights under the Civil Rights Act @Imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
The leaked HHS memo is not policy but it is intended to become stated policy right after the election @Imarajones @thelastsipnews #Translash
