Looking to the future, all signs point to 2018 being an even stronger year than 2017. The industry‚Äôs commercial aerospace segment is set to increase manufacturing output in 2018 in response to higher domestic &amp; int'l demand for commercial aircraft &amp; related platforms.

While the industry‚Äôs defense side saw higher deliveries of military aircraft incl. fighters, transports &amp; patrol aircraft, shipments fell slightly overall from the	previous year, driven by lower deliveries of military rotorcraft, trainers, unmanned aerial systems &amp; naval systems.
Measured in manufacturing activity, the industry‚Äôs commercial aerospace sector saw its output increase in 2017, driven by higher shipments of commercial aircraft, general aviation aircraft &amp; space systems. https://t.co/rZwiH9cPcd
A&amp;D generated $865 billion in economic output &amp; supported ~2.4 million U.S. jobs in 2017. Many of the industry‚Äôs key indicators saw an upswing, w/commercial production, sales &amp;  orders all picking up toward the end of 2017, off setting flatter growth in the defense sector.
