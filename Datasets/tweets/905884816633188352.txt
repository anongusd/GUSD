@yhn @RepMoBrooks @sean_yhn @POTUS @NewDay The R's all know that government can be reopened and then they can debate the border security and work out a deal, INSTEAD of holding federal workers and contractors hostage!

@mhart45 @Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc He has lied under oath in many things.

@Morning_Joe This show is getting ridiculous ! Defending sex predators like the one in the WH. All of you are throwing off all the important things regarding Kavanaugh, crazy! Confirming Kavanaugh will go against everything we stand up for, he will be unable to be impartial on cases!
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc @rickwtyler We already have a big taint on the SC w/Clarence Thomas. No way should a man be elevated to the SC with ANY incident of demeaning women like we don't matter, much less assaulting them or attempted rape. We can do better than this AND WE SHOULD. No doubt.
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc It seems that Trump and other GOP want him on the SC to defend them in the way he votes on cases coming up, like Gamble vs US, about presidential powers, etc. He showed Americans: He is a partisan operative and we do not need that on the SC. He will forever taint the SC forever.
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc @rickwtyler Why do you think Kavanaugh should get away with lying? If he lies about little things-he will lie about big things and has already. He lied to Congress multiple times about being involved w/stolen emails that he also used against senators. This is NOT GOOD for the SC.
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc @rickwtyler that's why his drinking habits MATTER and should also be investigated. That's the problem, all of Brett's bad behavior and alleged assaults, harassment, sexual misconduct ALL HAPPENED when he was   heavily drinking. That's why it's important to find out if he has lied
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler @nbc Kavanaugh specifically said in the hearing he didn't know about Deborah R. Story until the New Yorker. Also Rick the fact that these alleged assaults, demeaning of women, sexual misconduct, etc-ALL of this seemed to happen when he would be bad drunk, 2)
@Morning_Joe @rickwtyler Why do you not think that it should be investigated to the fact that Kavanaugh has lied, because I believe that he has lied to the Senate under oath. Also according to @NBC Kavanaugh was contacting these witnesses before it was public to get them to deny it. 1)
@Morning_Joe What is the deal with the hosts not being on the show hardly ever?  If @JoeNBC and @morningmika cannot be responsible enough to show up, take them off completely! It's not right for the viewers, this has been going on for a long time, @MSNBC.

@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz @GOP Lord yes. I never expressed my politics UNTIL when Trump won the election. I could no longer be silent!

@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz I can't even put into words all my feelings today! Very angry with the circus that happened w/ Brett's testimony. I couldn't believe he would humiliate his family like that. Stunning. He's a pathological liar I do believe.
@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz @GOP Oh definitely, that's why they are fighting this so hard. They need him in there cause the Gamble vs US case the SC will be deciding (very important) Plus he will let Trump go with presidential powers. A lot of the GOP will be going down w/Russia investigation. Can't wait either.
@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz Exactly. If he wanted to clear his name he would be demanding the FBI to investigate! He don't want the truth known. Yes it's embarrassing n hurtful for his family but look at these women whose lives  he and Judge has damaged for life-- traumatized! Gosh it burnt me alive today.
@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz Mark Judge has got to interviewed by authorities no doubt. I believe there are soooo much more they are hiding. They just didn't do this with 1 or 2 or 3 girls, this is a pattern of behavior for years it seems. I think there are more to the Renate story. They are avoiding truth.
@padenpur @PaulaLowery14 @Shakestweetz Yeah it was just reported on MSNBC ON the 11th Hour, Brian Williams. They just tweeted it out. He is using the odd phrase as Brett did today "Penalty under felony" instead of "Penalty under Perjury". Odd.
