We have made tough choices, being judicious with the scarce resources we have on behalf of the taxpayer.   		‚ÄúThis may not be the best possible #FarmBill.  But, it is the best bill possible under these circumstances.
This is what happens when the Congress works in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion.  This is a good #FarmBill that accomplishes what we set out to do ‚Äì provide certainty and predictability for farmers, families, and rural communities.
The #FarmBill focuses on program integrity and commonsense investments to strengthen our nutrition programs to ensure the long-term success of those in need of assistance.
more #FarmBill:	This Farm Bill meets the needs of producers across all regions and all crops.  And, it ensures that our voluntary conservation programs are keeping farm land in operation while protecting our agriculture lands, forests, and other natural resources.

History has shown us time and again that we cannot sit back and wait given the most serious challenges we face in the world and the role that America plays. #SFRC
I say to those who serve our country here in Washington and at diplomatic posts around the world, Mike Pompeo will work hard to earn your trust. He will seek to build bridges; to rely upon expertise; to debate and discuss, but to always have respect. #SFRC
Mike came to Washington with a strong desire to serve the people of the 4th District and to make a difference.  He sought a seat on the House Intelligence Committee at a time when intelligence-gathering methods were under fire, before he went on to lead the @CIA. #SFRC
As our nation‚Äôs most senior diplomat, Mike will be forthright, forceful, and thoughtful. He will give @POTUS and the Congress candid counsel. He will be a man of his word. #SFRC

The Senate is moving ahead and has filed cloture on the nomination of @govsambrownback to be the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. Looking forward to approving the nomination as early as this week.
It is unfortunate that the minority‚Äôs stunt of shutting down the government was simply a needless delay in doing the work Americans expect of the Congress. (2/2) #SchumerShutdown
I am pleased we extended #CHIP for a record 6 years, and now the Senate can continue its work on appropriations, increasing defense spending &amp; addressing illegal immigration. (1/2)
ICYMI my full statement on the #SchumerShutdown: https://t.co/TdEMVREOy3
While the minority is intent on the headlines from a #SchumerShutdown, I will be working with my colleagues on a solution. My offices in DC and KS will be open normal office hours to serve constituents.
3 months ago, @GOPSenFinance Committee passed bipartisan legislation to extend the Childrens' Health Insurance Program for 5 yrs. Last night we had the option of delivering 6 years. Unfortunately, that bipartisan support for this critical program disappeared. #SchumerShutdown
I voted to keep the government open and to fund CHIP. Kansans are sick and tired of the political games in Washington. They are not interested in leverage or brinksmanship. They want certainty. They expect us to fulfill our Constitutional duty to fund the government.
RT @SenateMajLdr: #Senate¬†Democrats have a choice to make. This should be a no-brainer... https://t.co/zdUFXxclZ9
We have the opportunity to fund #CHIP for 6 more years, the longest extension in the history of the program. Unfortunately,  Democrats would rather play political games than provide for provided health coverage to children in need. https://t.co/26oT7LwDka
I've long been a supporter of the bipartisan #CHIP program. Democrats should put aside partisan politics and vote to fund our government &amp; extend CHIP for 6 more years. #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/nVwjvAASRY
It is always humbling to welcome the many Kansans who travel to Washington to help in our fight to protect life. #MarchForLife2018 https://t.co/6y8ogZvDyk

ICYMI I spoke on the Senate floor today on why the Senate needs to pass long overdue #taxreform. https://t.co/umQtSAdhdt
The Senate #taxreform bill provides meaningful tax relief for families, small businesses, and farmers and ranchers. https://t.co/PYff9qACzo https://t.co/SolLlNUSP0
NEWS RELEASE: Roberts: Tax Reform is Critical to Economic Growth, Creating Jobs and Higher Wages https://t.co/PYff9qACzo https://t.co/uSCsJuVsIv
#TaxReform will help our farmers by creating a much more pro-growth tax system, lowering their tax burden and simplifying the tax provisions relating to the agricultural sector.
#TaxReform will provide farmers and ranchers with certainty. Certainty that they will not be taxed out of business in a down year &amp; that they will have cash available to fund their operations.
I am pleased this #taxreform bill reflects the importance of production #agriculture to our economy.
We have before us now a comprehensive plan to address these issues, cleaning up and modernizing the tax code, to help generate more growth in our economy - providing meaningful tax relief for families, small businesses &amp; farmers &amp; ranchers.
Can America get back to a place ‚Äì to make history ‚Äì and to once again experience the power of the American dream? I am confident we can. #taxreform
It is abundantly clear that this complexity and our antiquated corporate tax system act as a brake on our economy. #taxreform
We all understand how critical #taxreform is. All of us in the Senate ‚Äì on both sides of the aisle ‚Äì are familiar with the burdens, the complexity, and lack of competitiveness associated with our current tax system.

PRESS RELEASE: Roberts: Hold Remains Absent White House Assurance Not to Send #GITMO Terrorists to Kansas https://t.co/l7BcxEWsXc
ICYMI here is my speech on the Fanning nom &amp; WH refusal to assure me no terrorists from #GITMO will be sent to KS. https://t.co/LFpL5qXRfr
If the plans from the administration rule out Ft. Leavenworth as an option for the relocation of #GITMO, all they have to do is tell me.
But make no mistake, I remain adamantly opposed to placing #GITMO detainees anywhere on the U.S. mainland.
It is what Kansans expect and have demanded of me.
This hold is one of the tools afforded to me as a US Senator &amp; I will do everything in my power to protect the national security of the U.S.
All I am asking is for the @WhiteHouse to assure me Ft. Leavenworth is NOT a viable alternative.
I have reviewed the latest assessment &amp; it's apparent that it‚Äôs virtually impossible to safely relocate terrorists to Ft. Leavenworth
The admin. refused to come forward w/ a real plan to re-locate the prisoners, instead of a weak attempt to honor a campaign promise.
We should be angry at the @WhiteHouse that intends to ignore laws &amp; wants to bring terrorists to our shores.
w/ the threat of executive order, I have little choice but to do what I can to block the transfer of #GITMO detainees to Ft. Leavenworth.
After much study &amp; review, I can name you countless reasons why this plan is wrong. It is also illegal, which @POTUS' cabinet acknowledges.
He insists on transferring the remaining #GITMO detainees to a site on the US the mainland, w/ Ft. Leavenworth under serious consideration.
As I have publicly stated from the beginning, my issue is not w/ the nominee, but w/ POTUS who continues to insist on closing #GITMO this yr
It is my deep respect &amp; concern for our men &amp; women in uniform &amp; all those at Ft. Leavenworth that has compelled me to hold @POTUS' nominee.
I support Fanning to be Secretary of the @USArmy. KS is the proud home to 2 Army posts &amp;I want the Army to have a highly-qualified Secretary
SPEAKING NOW on the floor on the Fanning nomination &amp; @POTUS‚Äô plan to close #GITMO &amp; bring terrorists to the mainland.
