The anon letter was published in Nov. 2017.	@ucsc began an investigation on Feb. 8 2018. 	Prof. Balakrishnan is on paid leave that began fall 2017. The university did not say when he will return. 	The investigation is scheduled to conclude July 10. 	https://t.co/blLCfRGAWt

RT @bobjherman: @NidhiSubs Such an odd hearing. The big question is *why* IHS leaders wouldn't directly answer budget questions.
@bobjherman V. odd. Unable to answer? Unwilling? But does seem rather consistent with agency response to ~any~ question in my experience.
Senators seem ready to throw money at the underfunded/understaffed IHS but its leaders don't seem to want it
Over 2 hrs IHS officials dodged basic questions about whether current/proposed budget are üëçüèΩ/üëéüèΩ for the agency https://t.co/ndf72ItpJ0
Senators were hopping mad that IHS chiefs couldn't say if the new budget helped or hurt staffing https://t.co/dLY1IdggHy by @philgalewitz
