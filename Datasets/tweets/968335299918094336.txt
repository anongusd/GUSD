@helen_it @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump In some way yes you can because the shooting of Steve Scalise was done by a democrat. A guy attacked Senator Rand Paul and broke his ribs. It’s the rioting and physical attacks from ANTIFA and BLM that the media says isn’t mob like behavior it’s peaceful protesting.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Omg it’s on both sides! Maxine Waters told people to confront elected officials. Eric Holder said when they go low we kick them. This behavior on both sides is disgusting and you can’t cherry pick when it’s politically convenient for you. #unity
