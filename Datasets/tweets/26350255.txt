@LarryOConnor Larry if you honestly think that the right is not islamophobic then how come it was acceptable to ask presidential candidates if they would have a Muslim in their cabin at? Prejudicial and islamophobic
@MaVASteve @LarryOConnor That may be a woman wearing a hijab but that is not her face nor her name nor her Twitter page...
@Jpmaxx21 I had numerous miscarriages I've never killed a baby dear bye bye
@sioxielegend Ben Carson and others when they were campaigning for president asked if they would have a Muslim in their cabinet said no which is completely a prejudicial statement and that is okay because you're referring to a Muslim that correct?
@dmmktg @FoxNews I never said I agreed with her stance on isis or Israel or anything for that matter. I was commenting on what they called her and not wanting an opposing view at the table
@PantsOzzy @LarryOConnor I am real do some research and look at the attacks on Muslims especially from 9:11 to present day
@MaVASteve @LarryOConnor Think about your comment. I am responding to you on Twitter and read your comment so how can I be afraid of what people are saying if I am Reading and responding to it? Ridiculous statement
@MaVASteve @LarryOConnor You know one of my parents is Jewish correct? I know what the term means I don't need to look it up
@FlyFisher_AKY and I'm assuming you're not Muslim &amp; would have no idea and are just pulling that statistic out of a place the sun don't shine?
@FlyFisher_AKY Less than cattle got her so many votes in the Muslim community that she became a congresswoman
@dkahanerules No terrorists did	the majority of our prison population claims to be Christian does not mean Christians are killing thousands of people each year as well?
@LarryOConnor Larry please do you read social media every time there's a terrorist attack? There are plenty of people on the right who like to assume all Muslims are terrorists
@LarryOConnor Yes but some would say that they're those on the right that have extreme views and positions regarding Israel in the middle East why shouldn't an alternate opinion be allowed to have a seat at the table?

@Darealbowman @JboogAllen4 @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz and so the judges and the police and the teachers that aren't white or also white supremacist? Your arguments absolutely ridiculous
@Darealbowman @JboogAllen4 @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz give me a break! If you go up to someone and call them a white supremacist they will be offended unless they are wearing a white hood and you know it. You're playing with words and words are very powerful goodbye
@CoreyPo79238798 @themongoslade @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz I think it's sad that you call people offencive terms because they are different in their views or their skin color or their gender. That's not going to get any of us or certainly our nation anywhere moving forward.
@MrMartyKann @tariqnasheed My husband is Indian and that picture has professional lighting my son I adopted from Pakistan. Seriously?
@Excuseyourmom @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz I've never said that anyone of any race should vote for any one party. Who you vote for is up to you the individual regardless of your race. a lot of you here are very angry and I can't stand toxic people so I'm just going to block all of you have a good life all the best
@jaymal287 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz how am I fraudulent? I simply posted an opinion it's mine it has nothing to do with my skin color and has nothing to do with my political party that actually has more to do with my gender. You realize the root of fraudulent is fraud? I'm not a fraud goodbye
@JboogAllen4 @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz Oh no doubt white's benefit but that will change as whites won't be the majority in 2054. but I think you know the definition of white supremacist it's somebody who wears that Hood with the  eyes cut out and believes they are superior based on their race that's not me dear
@delsmithmusic @tariqnasheed I'm going to block you accusing me of being a white supremacist is beyond defensive to me goodbye
@NikilYoungLove @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz No one was inquiring about my worldview they were accusing me of racism very different dear
@terib3294 @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz Okay then we vote for Trump in 2020 as a Democrat I choose not to. And if things are so great what are you complaining about them?
@InvestmentBlast @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz I'm not and we r done. I've been on radio for over 30 years on television for over a decade and I have written for over 5 years you find me one thing that shows I'm racist I'll wait ...

@reed_elam @RobSHarris007 @genososa @tariqnasheed She probably does but she hasn't shared them yet most people do that once everyone has announced in they start campaigning and debating

@Darealbowman @tariqnasheed @Truthsetsyoufr6 @zulu_shabazz I'm not asking you to vote for a Democrat I'm simply saying that historically Democrats have done more for minority communities than  Republicans.
@Darealbowman @tariqnasheed @Truthsetsyoufr6 @zulu_shabazz then when you have the two people running for president in 2020 decide which of those two would serve you and your community better and vote for them
@Tyler11711 @tariqnasheed I didn't see the video that way he has his interpretation I have mine. I think of anything she was copying AOC with the dancing
@mrrowe8 @tariqnasheed Preach
@Tyler11711 @RobSHarris007 @genososa @tariqnasheed You absolutely have that right but you should ask that of the woman running not of me
@tariqnasheed u assume she is my candidate.She's not. for me as a Dem I want the candidate that can make Trump a one-term president  I dont believe she is the candidate that could beat him. For you you want policies that benefit your community best. Different voters want different things
@tariqnasheed They're going to be about 20 Democrats running so I don't know why you say Democrats want you to vote for her. her campaign wants you to vote for her but Joe biden's campaign will want you to vote for him.
@tariqnasheed @Truthsetsyoufr6 @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz Don't be so naive both parties want the black vote, Hispanic vote, female vote a millennial vote they don't need to State it that's common sense the one with the most votes wins
@clarb3 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz 1st not all Dems share 1 brain. 2nd I  don't judge a person's intelligence by their skin color. I don't think she was pretending to like cardi b many of us r fans. Which candidate do you feel addresses those issues in your community? Support that person and have them run
@Darealbowman @Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz Then I guess you better find a candidate then who could be elected we have  a two party system until that changes you're stuck with a conservative or a liberal

@Truthsetsyoufr6 @tariqnasheed @Darealbowman @zulu_shabazz Sorry you feel that way. Again generalizing
@SeriouslyJr @tariqnasheed But I don't think she will get the nomination
@clarb3 @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz I already answered that
@tariqnasheed I never said to vote for her I'm not sure she'll get the nomination. again generalizing and putting words in my mouth I never said
@tariqnasheed @lolasoulfinger well just like not all black voters are the same not all Democratic strategists are either and I don't appreciate being lumped in and generalized. if you want to ask me a specific question I will answer but just to assume what I believe is completely wrong
@genososa @tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz You would have to ask them I'm not running
@RobSHarris007 @genososa @tariqnasheed A a Sen she fought to reverse incarceration, scale back the war on drugs, address racial disparities in the criminal justice system but her record as agreed in Cali was quite different
@RobSHarris007 @genososa @tariqnasheed I don't think anybody can answer that because she just threw her hat into the ring a day ago once she rolls out her plans and policies I can comment on them. If you are talking about her Senate record...next tweet...
@JamallingAgain So if somebody posts something on the Internet because I am white and they are African-American I can't respond to the comment they make!? What year is it again?
@lolasoulfinger @tariqnasheed No I'm not going to respond to every post he has I think you can see I have quite a few people post I can't respond to everyone it just bothers me when people pick on women and politics because of their appearance I consider it sexist
@LarryOConnor Kudos... She earned it this time around
@sup97082864 @tariqnasheed I'm going to have to block you I don't allow profanity
@tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz I said policies we can debate women's appearances we shouldn't I'm so sick of the sexism in politics
@tariqnasheed @zulu_shabazz I did not make an emphasis on black hair I made an emphasis on a woman's appearance you specifically mentioned her hair I said she might have pulled it back cuz it was a bad hair day has nothing to do with her race all women wear ponytails on bad hair days
@zulu_shabazz @tariqnasheed Now you're talkin policies we can debate A parent's Choice of music and dancing to it? nada
@genososa @tariqnasheed I wear my hair back, dance to rap music and I am white. So if I run for office someday I'm pandering to African Americans for being myself?

@KevinElston No I see clearly children disrespecting an elderly man ....and moreso because of his skin color and heritage. That's not political or religious. It's lack of common decency. Period.

@thehonorablecsc @CryPartisan @AC101 @KennedyNation Thanks girl! I just get my magic blocker out when those people tweet. :) I don't have time for toxic people in my life
@JaxBchLady And you didn't answer my question why are you following me? I don't follow people that I think so negatively as you think of me.
@JaxBchLady You didn't ask a question you called me pathetic
@TKS1313 @Vicky4Trump2020 @WayneDupreeShow Wow really nasty today great way to start the new year.
@CryPartisan @AC101 @KennedyNation @thehonorablecsc No idea how you know whether I'm likable or not you've never met me that was my point. I wish you all the best in your life.
@CryPartisan @AC101 @KennedyNation @thehonorablecsc No offense but you're entitled to your opinion you also can change the channel
@lifeatanyage @OutnumberedFNC I didn't know she was the only woman in politics
@JaxBchLady If I'm pathetic why are you following me?
@JaxBchLady I am pathetic because I said journalists should report the facts and not give their opinions or become the story?
@AC101 @CryPartisan @KennedyNation Thank you for proving my point that we women are judged based on likability. I didn't talk much today so not sure how you're judging my likeability factor. Have you ever met me? And Kennedy is very civil toward me. The cat fight is in your mind
