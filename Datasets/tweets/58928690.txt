The law is clear about this now, and we‚Äôre going to keep fighting to ensure that DOD is able to account for those dangers.
It‚Äôs completely inappropriate for the administration to try to form a climate denial panel to try to cast doubt on the risks, and it could put us in a worse national security position where we‚Äôre not prepared for what is to come.
All manner of national security experts, Republican &amp; Democratic alike, recognize the empirical threat that #climatechange poses to our national security interests. Democrats got that fact enshrined into law in the 2017 NDAA - and Trump signed it. 		https://t.co/uwwnFE3Bl9
The President has said he wants this border wall to protect us from a purported invasion. The law is very clear - if you are going to take money from the military construction budget, it has to go to protect US armed forces. If he takes this action, it will be illegal. https://t.co/SAFtoDN2Rf

It is also illegal. The law says you can only use money from the military construction budget to build something to provide protection for US armed forces. This wall has nothing to do with force protection.

I continue to believe that spending billions on a border wall with no justification, especially in the wake of the GOP tax giveaway to the wealthy, is deeply irresponsible, especially as we have so many other worthy national priorities.
Our policy and legislative process does not work by holding the government hostage, and I hope the President has learned that doing so is unproductive and harmful.
Finally, after 35 days, the President has agreed to do what he should have done in the first place: open the government. The impacts of the government shutdown on federal workers and communities across the country have been immense.
I voted today to reopen @DHSgov until Feb 28th, and have previously voted to do so for the rest of government, while negotiations with the Administration continue. It is time to #EndtheShutdown
There is no reason why demands for a border wall should hold up funding for agencies that remain closed. Federal workers are not a bargaining chip.
The House has voted ten times to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government, and today the Senate did not end the crisis. Ultimately, many federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck because Trump is not getting his way.

Foreign interference in our electoral system is deeply troubling and interest in uncovering any meddling in our democratic system of government should span the political aisle.

We must ensure the rule of law is upheld, and Congress should immediately pass legislation to protect the integrity and independence of the Mueller investigation.

As Ranking Member of the @HASCDemocrats, I made it a priority in this year's NDAA to fight for the inclusion of these provisions regarding the Yemen civil war. https://t.co/mmtQcs3L5V
Congress should not be expanding their license to discriminate, but instead be conducting vigorous oversight to ensure privacy and civil rights protections are defended.
Given these serious concerns, it would be wrong to indefinitely extend and enshrine in the U.S. Code a program where considerable doubts remain. Under the Trump Administration, both DHS and ICE have proven track record of discriminatory actions.
BITMAP‚Äôs effectiveness has not been thoroughly proven, it raises serious privacy concerns, and unanswered questions remain about how the information collected by the program can be used.
I opposed the effort in the U.S. House tonight to permanently authorize an identification program known as BITMAP ‚Äì a pilot program run by ICE within the Department of Homeland Security.
I am fighting in Congress to permanently reauthorize and fund the LWCF ‚Äì as we face the grave threat of #climatechange, we must #SaveLWCF to preserve our parks and public lands. 	 	Read more from the @MTSGreenway here ‚û°Ô∏è https://t.co/iKPzc6gTiE
The Land and Water Conservation Fund has helped conserve more than 80,000 acres of public land and supported dozens of parks across the Mountains to Sound Greenway - right in our own backyard. Without Congressional action, the LWCF will expire on September 30, 2018.
The continuation of this administration‚Äôs discriminatory and racist policies against communities of color is unacceptable. They are American in every measurable way - including on paper. 		https://t.co/rMhVTD8GCK
Undocumented immigrants were never the sole target of this administration‚Äôs overall immigration policy, and bigoted actions like these make that more clear than ever.
These Americans, who have U.S. birth certificates and were previously issued official American passports, are now being arrested and sent to immigration detention facilities with the threat of deportation.
In a blatant effort to reduce legal immigration, the Trump Administration‚Äôs State Department is currently questioning the citizenship of thousands of Americans born on American soil.
It is vital that we resume investing in the American worker and ensure their success in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
The contributions of the labor movement have been fundamental in ensuring American workers receive their well-deserved rights. We must continue to fight for jobs that pay a living wage, provide fair workplace conditions, and build a healthcare system that covers those in need.
At a time when labor unions are under direct attack, we must show America‚Äôs workers the same devotion they have shown to our society.
On #LaborDay, we honor the American worker &amp; the labor movement that is an integral engine of our economy &amp; our social fabric. As the son of a union baggage handler at SeaTac Airport, I know firsthand how labor unions have helped generations of America‚Äôs working families thrive.
I am fighting @EPA rollbacks to protect the fish and seafood that is a part of our local #PugetSound heritage. I stand to protect #cleanwaterforall!
The President‚Äôs prioritization of corporations and the rich over public servants and the agencies on which Americans rely is indefensible. We need leaders who work #ForThePeople and put all working Americans and their families first.
After ramming through a massive tax cut that primarily benefits the wealthy, President Trump is now pleading poverty and slashing the modest annual pay increase that helps federal workers‚Äô salaries keep up with ever-increasing costs of living.
Our country‚Äôs federal workers help to ensure that Americans have access to all government programs and services; from Social Security to Medicare, the National Institutes of Health, and the Small Business Administration.
President Trump canceled a planned 2.1 percent pay increase for federal employees who work in our region and throughout the rest of the United States.

To address the difficult issues facing many Americans, I support Medicare for All to combat the rise in healthcare costs for many families. I have also supported reauthorizing Child Care block grants to assist low income families with child care and after school programs.
Americans shouldn‚Äôt have to make the difficult decision of whether to buy groceries or pay necessary bills. It‚Äôs imperative we continue working together to ensure people make a livable wage while protecting safety net programs to assist families facing tough times. https://t.co/QJV0vFePl6

John McCain's dedication to public service, his service in Vietnam, you have to admire that. But our President can‚Äôt get past his own pettiness to recognize someone who deserves it. You don‚Äôt have to endorse someone‚Äôs entire life to recognize what they did that was right.

I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Department of Defense is planning for and mitigating against the impact of climate change and continues to invest in clean sources of energy to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel.
One area we continue to make progress is with the Department of Defense. As Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have worked with my colleagues to declare that climate change is a national security threat.
We are already at the point where we have waited way too long to address the impact of #climatechange and carbon-based fuels. For the President to roll back the progress we have made is disastrous and must be confronted.
It is absolutely clear that carbon-based emissions have us on a path to destroy our planet. We need to get off our dependency on carbon, not promote it. By gutting the #CleanPowerPlan, step by step the President is pushing us in the wrong direction.
President Trump continues to push an unrelenting assault on critical protections for our environment.  Most troubling of all, he is pushing us towards being more reliant on fossil fuels.

They were using cyber-attacks, disinformation campaigns, hacking e-mails. We need to get to the bottom of what happened. To the extent that the president is trying to stop that, he's not only potentially committing a crime; he is harming the national security interest of the US.
It's really simple. The president simply has to cooperate with this investigation. It's a lawful, legitimate investigation. No serious person questions that the Russians at the highest level were involved to try to influence our election.
President Trump has made it very, very clear that he wants to stop this investigation. And that flirts with obstruction of justice. The more often he says that, the more potential legal jeopardy he is in.

I am pleased that this bill provides for our men and women in uniform and their families. There are many things to be concerned about in this bill, but the outcomes in these areas are positive.
This bill continues the absolutely critical work of pushing back against President Putin‚Äôs ongoing campaign to undermine U.S. alliances, partnerships, and democratic values around the world.
Democrats were able to remove a provision that would have made it easier for defense contractors to transfer machine guns. The bill closes a loophole that that allowed Devin Kelley, convicted of domestic violence, to purchase the gun he used in a 2017 mass shooting in a TX church
Supporting service members and their families, Democrats secured the inclusion of a substantial array of provisions to promote safety and combat domestic violence and sexual harassment among military personnel.
The Defense Department is also required to report on transitional justice in Syria and to review the policy framework for military activity like the ongoing operations in Niger.
Transparency is further enhanced by requiring the President to make the total number of deployed members of the Armed Forces publicly available. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Syria.
The bill includes major provisions on the reporting of civilian casualties in connection with U.S. military operations. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to develop and coordinate policy for civilian casualties connected with U.S. military operations.
The bill also requires a review of whether the U.S. Armed Forces or its partners have violated laws or policies while conducting operations in Yemen.
Democrats made significant strides to advance human rights, the promotion of peace, protection of vulnerable populations abroad, and the rule of law in conflict.
As in years before, Republicans again attempted to undermine the Endangered Species Act. This year, they also tried to roll back regulations on mining nationwide, and allow for the indefinite taking of certain public lands for defense purposes.
Foremost, Democrats defeated multiple provisions that would have been extremely harmful to the environment. Environmental riders have no place in a defense bill.
Democrats fought hard and won multiple progressive outcomes in this year‚Äôs Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. We do not control Congress, and we cannot get everything we want, but I am pleased that by being persistent we succeeded on many important issues.

Certainly global health, education, direct assistance all play a crucial role. But I would submit that nothing is more important than enabling these countries to develop their own economy by giving them the capital they need to grow, so that they become self-sustaining partners.
The overall goal of foreign aid is to make sure that there hopefully at some point are no countries in the world that can‚Äôt provide for their people, to go after poverty, to reduce it wherever we can. And there are a lot of different projects that are important to foreign aid.

This bill will end the use of private facilities and repeal mandatory detention, while restoring due process, oversight, accountability, and transparency to the immigration detention system.
Our current system is inhumane, unjust, and driven by private, for-profit corporations like The GEO Group, which operates the Northwest Detention Center.
This Congress, together with @RepJayapal I introduced an updated version: H.R. 3923, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, legislation to reform the systemic problems in our immigration detention system.
This came after detained people in Tacoma went on a nearly two-month hunger strike at the Northwest Detention Center over lack of access to nutritious food, solitary confinement and isolation practices, cruel treatment by guards, and other unacceptable living conditions.
In 2014, I introduced the Accountability in Immigration Detention Act, legislation that aimed to improve standards and living conditions in detention centers across the country.
News of the ongoing hunger strike at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, WA is extremely concerning. We know that our immigration detention system is in shambles, and that reforms are long overdue.

ICE has strayed far from its original purpose and has failed to enforce immigration laws and protect national security in a humane and just way. I am proud to join several of my colleagues in cosponsoring this necessary legislation.
Trump has weaponized this agency to accomplish his racist agenda. To bring an end to these rampant human rights violations, we must terminate ICE &amp; convene a commission of experts to make recommendations to Congress on the redistribution of ICE‚Äôs essential enforcement functions.
Across my district &amp; throughout our country, ICE is ripping families apart. They are raiding workplaces, invading homes, showing up at courthouses, schools, and hospitals, detaining individuals indefinitely &amp; instilling fear throughout our communities. We must put a stop to this.
Speaker Ryan is trying to demagogue the issue. The Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act isn‚Äôt about stopping immigration enforcement or open borders. It is about shining a light on the injustices of our system, changing the way that we conduct enforcement.
We need to change the way we do immigration enforcement. Our current system is inhumane; it is separating children from their parents, deporting and detaining too many people, and ripping families apart. None of this is making us any safer.
While I continue to push for an end to the mass detention of individuals and families, DoD must provide answers regarding their plans to house up to 32,000 migrant families and unaccompanied children on military bases. We must hold the Trump Administration accountable.
Individuals do not have to be held in detention at all; there are safe, humane, and effective alternatives to detention that we can and should be implementing, such as the Family Case Management Program.
It is appalling and unacceptable that the federal government is planning to detain migrants in tents at such an unprecedented scale in the first place.
To this end, my colleagues and I are requesting that the Republican lead House Armed Services Committee‚Äôs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations immediately look into the support and infrastructure DoD intends to provide.
I am deeply concerned that the Department of Defense is preparing to house tens of thousands of migrant families and children in tents on military bases. Congress must fulfill its oversight duties and demand answers from DoD. https://t.co/IRCmL1udUV

Unfortunately, the high number of vacancies and lack of retention still exist as a problem in Puget Sound Health Care System and the Veterans Health Administration as a whole. We can and need to do better. 	https://t.co/euhhTbjMyl
After the Tiger Team‚Äôs review, the Puget Sound Health Care System named Acting Director Michael Tadych the full-time director. Since he has taken on the job as director, many constituents have lauded his accessibility &amp; the number of improvements that he has made.
These deficiencies had culminated in an unacceptable de facto paralysis in the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System. My team &amp; I worked with former VA Secretary Shulkin to bring in a ‚ÄúTiger Team‚Äù to focus on management &amp;leadership improvements for the Puget Sound Health Care System.
Through discussions w/local veterans we worked to identify some of the root causes. Initially, we discovered the problems seem to largely stem from unfilled management positions, an over-reliance on ‚Äúacting‚Äù roles that lack decision-making authority &amp; frequent leadership turnover
Unfortunately, in meetings with individual veterans, during my Veterans Advisory Council roundtables, and in conversations with Veterans Service Organizations in Washington state, my staff and I regularly heard of obstacles that veterans faced in accessing care.
There are more than 30,000 vacancies within the VA health care system nationwide, including over 1,000 across Washington state. Many Seattle area veterans receive their care through the VA Puget Sound Health Care System - specifically at the Seattle Campus.

Family separation and mass family detention are a part of an even larger systematic assault on immigrant communities. We cannot stand idly by in the face of clear human rights violations.
The Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy is insidious &amp; un-American. It is our duty to care for the youngest &amp; most vulnerable among us.

The #SCOTUS is no longer a judicial body. It is an arm of the Republican Party.		Every decision they‚Äôve made has simply been a rubber stamp for the Republican agenda. #JanusvsAFSCME
The President has decided that we must be hostile to immigrants and Congressional Republicans have chosen to align themselves with his fear-mongering, xenophobic agenda. He is trying to use this as a wedge issue to misinform and terrify people, and we cannot allow him to do so.
We can reunite families, give #Dreamers a path to citizenship, and work together toward comprehensive immigration reform.
We can process asylum requests &amp; use alternatives to detention for individuals and families awaiting their immigration proceedings, like the successful Family Case Management Program the President chose to abruptly end, despite its proven success.
To say that we are limited to only those options, and to refuse to bring up the multitude of legislative proposals that have bipartisan support, is deeply disingenuous. We have clear alternatives.
This administration &amp; Republicans want you to believe that we only have two choices when it comes to immigration enforcement: we either must separate families &amp; incarcerate immigrants, much like we did to Japanese Americans during WWII, or else we will have ‚Äòopen borders‚Äô &amp; crime
Neither piece of legislation presented any real solutions to fixing our broken immigration system, providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers, or reuniting children with their parents after being unjustly separated at the border.
The so-called ‚Äòcompromise‚Äô immigration bill that failed to pass the House this week was not a compromise at all ‚Äì not a single Democrat was consulted in the drafting of the bill. This bill had no significant differences from the Goodlatte bill which also failed to pass last week.
I stand with unions and their continued efforts to improve the lives of hardworking Americans across the country. #Union https://t.co/h1484pBQ7v
At a time when the disparity of wealth is highest in our nation's recent history, labor unions should be able to advocate for expanding equality of opportunity and to support the fight for justice for all.
Labor unions contributed to the creation of America‚Äôs middle class, and today are one of the most important means by which working people can push back against economic forces that are increasingly rigged against the working class.
As the son of a union worker I understand how important unions are in the lives of American workers &amp; their families. I strongly support workers' rights. I learned firsthand from my father, that the right to organize &amp; bargain for better working conditions is extremely important
The ability to organize and collectively bargain for benefits is one of the most important advances in American labor law and has been a major factor in the creation of a robust middle class in our country.
The #JanusvsAFSCME ruling is an attack on public sector workers &amp; their right to organize &amp; collectively bargain for better working conditions. The decision undermines unions‚Äô ability to work on behalf of &amp; be supported by workers who benefit from collective representation.

There is absolutely no reason for asylum seeking families to languish in detention facilities while they await the outcome of their cases. We need to pass the Dignity for Detained Immigrants into law to reform our immigration system and keep families together.
Our legislation would put an end to the administration‚Äôs abuses of the immigration detention system and allow individuals and families to live outside of detention while they await their immigration proceedings.
I introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act to address the systemic problems in our immigration detention system. In light of the Administration‚Äôs ‚Äúzero-tolerance policy‚Äù and the June 20th Executive Order, I'm honored to have @SenBooker introduce a Senate companion bill.
The problem that we face today is twofold: our immigration system is broken, and the way Donald Trump is choosing to enforce existing immigration laws is dead wrong. On multiple occasions, the President has created immigration crises that unjustly target immigrant children. https://t.co/6WwFIJSp0G
As the administration continues to confuse and deceive the American people on this critical issue, these families cannot wait. We must take up and pass the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act.
My bill would create special protections for young people, primary caregivers, survivors of torture and gender-based violence, and asylum seekers, and allow children and families to live outside of detention as they await the outcome of their cases.
The bills exacerbate the family separation &amp; detention crisis by allowing for the indefinite detention of both unaccompanied children &amp; family units.	My bill, the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, would end the Trump Administration‚Äôs abuses of the immigration detention system.
Both these bills failed to present any real solution for the #DACA crisis, leaving #DREAMers‚Äô lives in limbo. These bills would also have authorized funding for the ill-conceived border wall, drastically slashed legal immigration, &amp; destroyed our family-based immigration system.
Clearly this crisis is continuing unabated, despite what this administration would have you believe. This week, I adamantly opposed the Republican immigration bills that were brought before the House of Representatives.
With his new EO issued this week the President claims he is ‚Äúending family separation‚Äù ‚Äì a crisis of his own creation. In reality, he is replacing family separation w/ mass incarceration of children &amp; families with no clear plan to reunited thousands of children w/ their parents.

Today I introduced the Aviation Impacted Communities Act. I have worked directly with impacted communities &amp; taken extensive action to mitigate noise and environmental impacts in the 115th Congress. You can read more about this issue and the bill here ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://t.co/yE83PWr3uq
This has been the case even as many other areas have experienced reduced overall noise burdens. The concerns of residents of these increasingly impacted areas are not being adequately addressed.
As airline travel has increased, communities near airports across the country have been experiencing an increased and disproportionate share of noise and other environmental impacts stemming from commercial aviation.
I support @RepJerryNadler's #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct because we need to do everything possible to stop the practice of family separation and #KeepFamiliesTogether. Families belong together &amp; the Administration‚Äôs degradation of the parent-child relationship is cruel and inhumane.

To be clear, the President could end this policy at any time without an act of Congress. In in light of his unwillingness to do so we must immediately take up &amp; pass the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act. We must do everything in our power to stop the child abuse occurring at the border.
Today, I am proud to join over 190 of my colleagues in cosponsoring the Keep Families Together Act. This legislation would bring an end to the unconscionable practice of separating children from their parents and would limit criminal prosecutions for asylum seekers.

The Trump Administration‚Äôs relentless attacks on immigrant communities goes against everything we stand for as a country. I remain committed to defending this program and protecting DACA recipients from deportation. #ProtectDreamers
In September 2017, President Trump created an unnecessary crisis by terminating the program, causing tremendous harm to many young people and their families. #DREAMers are integral members of our communities and for many, the United States is the only place they call home.
Six years ago, the #DACA program was created to provide much-needed deportation relief to immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.

Ensuring a secure and peaceful future for vulnerable nations has global benefits for counterterrorism, peace and security, and other areas. I applaud my colleague Congressman Ellison for speaking out about this important issue.
Remittances are not only relied upon by countless families in these countries to meet their essential needs, but also help stabilize the economies of many countries experiencing violence and famine.
The recent news report from FOX 9 in Minnesota regarding lawful remittance transfers is both misleading and offensive. Remittances are critically important for individuals and families throughout the U.S. to be able to support their families in fragile nations like Somalia.
Muslim Americans contribute greatly to our nation, and it is important that all communities remain a safe and welcoming space for diverse religious expression. Ramadan Mubarak!

We must continue to ensure that the United States is a safe haven for everyone. On this day of remembrance, I join my constituents in the 9th Congressional District, and with those around the world, in honoring the memory of those lost in the Holocaust.
#HolocaustRemembranceDay is a somber reminder of the millions who were murdered during this horrific period in our world‚Äôs history.

Though Reverend McKinney has passed away, his legacy and advocacy for equal rights of African-Americans will remain ever present in the Greater Seattle community. https://t.co/VIkQOMBNgq
He helped establish the first black-owned bank to challenge practices such as restricted loans. He also co-founded the Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center, a vocational training organization.
When he arrived in Seattle, he witnessed systematic injustices such as discrimination, redlining, high unemployment among African-Americans. Reverend McKinney established numerous organizations and businesses to combat discrimination.
A former classmate of Dr. King's he played a fundamental role in Dr. King‚Äôs trip to Seattle. As spiritual leader for many in the African-American community in Seattle, Reverend McKinney understood that for African-Americans to be fully empowered they must be uplifted economically
With the passing of Rev. Dr. Samuel B. McKinney, our community has lost an instrumental leader of the civil rights movement.  After moving to Seattle in 1957 to become a pastor in the historic Mount Zion Baptist Church, Reverend McKinney was a pastor in the church for over 40 yrs

#EqualPayDay serves a reminder of the pay gap that still persists in almost all work sectors. Women who work full-time continue to earn 20 percent less than men. The pay gap continues to inhibit women from achieving full opportunities in the workforce.

John Bolton is every little bit as out of touch with reality as the President is. And we don‚Äôt need two people like that overseeing the national security of this country and the stability and peacefulness of the world.
He‚Äôs willing to be far more belligerent all across the globe. He thinks that we don‚Äôt need to work with any other countries. He thinks the US ought to be able to force and impose its will on everybody else. That is an enormous mistake &amp; terrible direction for our foreign policy
I am very concerned about President Trump‚Äôs appointment of John Bolton as the new National Security Advisor. Bolton is very much in favor with of going to war with just about everybody, but has specifically come out and said we should attack Iran, we should attack North Korea.

They try to spread fake news stories to undermine policies that they think would be contrary to their best interests. We need to fight back against that. The first step would be understanding what they are doing. Nobody is getting at the core of that more than Robert Mueller.
It‚Äôs critical that he does it. Even independent of how it may impact people associated with the Trump campaign, the Russians aren‚Äôt stopping. They are planning on interfering in our 2018 election, they interfere in our political decisions.
this would clearly be an obstruction of justice and a matter critical to the United State. And if that was the case, the President should be impeached. But I hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that. I hope the President lets our special prosecutor, Robert Mueller do his job.
I support prohibiting the President from having any way to get at the Special prosecutor, Mueller needs to be able to do his job. What happens if the President goes down this route? I think Senator Graham said it best, he said that it would be an impeachable offense and I agree.
It is deeply concerning that Trump has increased his criticism of Mueller &amp; also increased his criticism of the FBI &amp; the Intelligence community. Undermining the basic institutions that underpin our society is not good for the country &amp; more importantly, the President is wrong.
This legislation will allow LGBTQ students to learn in a more safe &amp; welcoming environment, enabling them to thrive academically &amp; socially.	I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the #SNDA. All children should have access to education free from discrimination. #LetKidsLearn
The Student Non-Discrimination Act, modeled after the Title IX protections, would establish a federal prohibition of discrimination in public schools for students who are discriminated against based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.
Currently, civil rights protections do not explicitly include sexual orientation or gender identity. This lack of explicit protection can lead to limited legal recourse for students who are discriminated against solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
LGBTQ students are faced with harassment, bullying and at times, violence in the classroom every day. This discrimination not only has a negative impact on their education, but also on their well-being. https://t.co/G4oTsvyzGA

Retiring in 1990 from the position of Director of Evergreen-Tacoma, she continued to make a difference in the lives of young people. She founded the Maxine Mimms Academy, a non-profit dedicated to educating troubled students who have been cast out of public school environments.
Dr. Mimms made it her life-long work in the education sector as a teacher in Seattle and Tacoma. Her focus was on improving educational outcomes for African-American adults within urban areas. Maxine Mimms founded the Tacoma branch of Evergreen State College.

Hopefully the House will defeat it. But I hear the Senate is likely to defeat it and then Republicans will be forced to negotiate, forced to come to the table and actually do something that should have been done a long time age.
So that the Dreamers that were told that they should be able to stay in this country and who should be able to stay in this country, can. So I‚Äôm going to vote no, and hopefully the Senate will defeat this bill.
But we need to fund it, we need appropriations bills, not a continuing resolution. We are already 3 months plus into the fiscal year of 2018 without appropriations bills. We shouldn‚Äôt be passing CRs, we should be passing appropriations bills and we should be passing a DACA fix.
So, I‚Äôm voting no for that reason, but also a CR, a continuing resolution, is not funding the government. President Trump and the Republicans seem to think that the government really doesn‚Äôt matter, they don‚Äôt care about funding it.
March 5th is their deadline. 800,000 people in this country, who were told that they could stay here and now are being told that they can't. There is bipartisan support for this fix, we should vote for it, we should pass it long before the March 5th deadline.
First of all, they do nothing to address the immigration situation w/ #DACA, the #Dreamers, young people who came to this country through no choice of their own who have lived their entire life here, who President Obama gave a pathway to legal status &amp; then Trump took away.

We also need to bring up the legislation necessary to ensure DREAMers can remain at home in this country, and not live in fear of their families being pulled apart.  Inaction on these vital issues is unacceptable.
We must do the job that we have been elected to do; particularly enacting a comprehensive budget that fairly funds important priorities, such as education, job growth, protection of the environment, and our national security.
Their lack of action will directly and negatively affect the people who reside in the Ninth Congressional District and across the country.  House Republicans cannot continue to punt their responsibilities.
By falling back on another short-term continuing resolution, almost a quarter of year past the due date for proper appropriations bills, they have clearly demonstrated that they are not willing to do their job.
The Republicans just reneged on their responsibility to properly fund the federal government because they were too busy giving away a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut to corporations and the wealthy.
As of TODAY, 12,641 #DACA recipients have lost their status after the President ended the program on Sept 5th. #Dreamers can‚Äôt wait any longer &amp; every day of inaction leads to 122 more Dreamers losing their status.

At a time when we have a national debt of $20 trillion and a deficit of nearly $700 billion, this will cause irreparable damage to our fiscal health. I will continue to fight against this harmful bill.
The #GOPTaxPlan is disastrous for working Americans and our economy. The plan will explode our deficit, make health care more expensive for millions of middle class Americans, and increase already historic levels of economic inequality.

We must make it so that everyone is held responsible for their actions. More broadly, we need to ensure transparency and accountability and promote workplace cultures that will prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.
I support the ME TOO Congress Act to reform the complaint process for victims of sexual harassment on Capitol Hill as well as the CEASE Resolution to comprehensively update the Office of Compliance‚Äôs policies.
As I have implemented in my office, annual sexual harassment training should be required for everyone working on Capitol Hill. Today‚Äôs vote is a first step in what must be a larger conversation about ways to make the workplace safer for everyone. Our work here is not done.
Sexual harassment is a pervasive problem in our society and we must do everything that we can to change that. Today, the House of Representatives voted on legislation requiring mandatory anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for all Members of Congress and their staff.
