Trump, in the long-term, will be good for America. Radicalizing the moderates. Accelerating the debate to a more equitable society. Brushing away the political cobwebs. Sometimes you need to spend a few days in a mental hospital if you want to appreciate the fresh air. #usurp
Hey #resistance and #MSM, the elusive "moderate swing voter" doesn't exist. You have people who always vote, and 100 million eligible voters who never vote. Give them a reason to show up. #Bernie has.
CUBS officially endorses BERNIE SANDERS for president. Please #Bernie, run a third-party candidacy. @TheDemocrats and @republicanparty need a gut renovation. Trump is arguably the first third-party candidate to win office, but let's do it for real this time. #BernieBro

@WagWalking It appears as though your company is leaving negative reviews on the Yelp page of a small business competitor. Care to comment?
@CNN Did the sisters also explore the Subway featured in the pre-video ad?
@guardian All NFL players should go on strike until the league and team ownership agrees to bang their heads against a cement wall 1000x until CTE sets in
@SebGorka @BretStephensNYT Bret Stephens is a well-spoken triangulating weasel. However, Sarah’s tweet was not steeped in centuries-old stereotypes meant to degrade race/ethnicity. Old white (rich) men control the levers of power that have tipped, inarguably, too far in their favor
@bear_bogie @BernieSanders @MmmBob Sounds like you’d be first in line to shine King George’s boots back in the colony days
@BernieSanders @MmmBob Let’s get back to DIRECT DEMOCRACY. Cut out the middleman! #FixDemocracyNow, weekly voting, figurehead representatives
#ThrowbackThursday to the Siege of Equifax. One of our partner groups tried to occupy the lovely piazza outside Equifax HQ. Nobody showed up, none of our demands were met - it was a disaster. Organizers' credit scores are worse now than before the siege. #Hacking #Moscow https://t.co/Zi0Lg1D93K
RIP @MoviePass - the only company in recent memory that was honestly trying to Make America Great Again. You will be missed. Reboot at $25 a month and cull the herd. Invest what little remains in production and distribution. You can do it!
@Uber We hope you guys lose so much $$$ that the Saudi Prince who funded your Series A flies over and beheads your executive team
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Be honest...you just don’t like immigrants wearing their t-shirts in the pool.
LBJ was the last honest president we had. He put country before party and didn’t seek re-election  — something that will never ever happen again, for both Dems and Repubs #NoBrainer
@rserie @MoviePass They probably won’t last, but give them credit where it’s due. You theoretically can see way more movies. AMC theaters are notoriously shitty. I’d hate to cut the fine folks at Regal out of the equation
Attention @realDonaldTrump, please use your executive power to bail out or further subsidize @MoviePass. Frequent movie-going is American as apple pie. Without movies, we would have nothing to watch except cable news, @bigbangtheory reruns, and @My600lbLifeCast
@rserie @MoviePass Except when they subsidize all the movies you have seen since opting in
@Brakywaki @MoviePass Have fun paying full price for movies you would never otherwise see, thereby depriving emerging talents from box office receipts at odds with our extended-universe era
But we’ll be damned if CUBS isn’t bringing 2 dozen #chocolatechip cookies to our town hall
Remember that @SUBWAY is the most populous restaurant chain on earth; their meatballs are made from ground mutton and veal shank; they put @Quiznos out of business after buying a toaster oven; they made @JaredFogle15 a millionaire
The balls on @MoviePass are elephantiasis-in-a-wheelbarrow status. Props to HMNY shareholders for restricting viewing on #MissionImossibleFallout  this weekend. It’s been a sweet ride, and thanks for subsidizing America’s greatest cultural export - our movies.
@MikeLevinCA @NARAL How about just the woman? She can solicit advice from family and doctor, but the decision should ultimately lie with her
@SenGillibrand Why did you endorse @andrewcuomo and not @CynthiaNixon then?
First they came for Ant-Man, and I said nothing, because I wasn’t an Ant-Man.		Then they came for surge-pricing, and I did nothing, because I had already seen everything.		Then they came for #MissionImpossibleFallout and there was no one to see left to see it #moviepass https://t.co/TYtdj5DCEF
@RoKhanna That is patently false. 2 years, or completion of Algebra 1, is the requirement. Many students in the areas you refer to take Alg 1 broken into 4 years - slow track, if you will. To say that entire districts don’t offer geometry, or consumer math, or statistics, is just wrong
@RoKhanna Math isn't for everybody. College-track students know to take 4 years, and most of them are cheating off the kid next to them come senior year anyway. The people who do math will do the math and the rest of us will use a calculator. STEM is overrated.
Benjamin Franklin was right. The turkey should be the national bird. We strut because we can't fly, our waddles quivering, snoots engorged with blood, locked in an endless intrasexual war. Reverse stock split the country and sell the eagle. #AmericanDream #GobbleGobble #Moviepass
We don’t blame them. Their business model is absurd and unsustainable. Riding this gravy train til it crashes into Grand Central. Thanks for the memories
CUBS members have been loyal #moviepass subscribers since the days when they charged $40 a month. Tonight, they are lying about a technical issue so they don’t fork over dough for MI opening weekend
If congress wants a more robust approval rating, they should get the hell off Twitter: the place where thoughts go to die #VoteThemOut #ElectionResults2018 #ThursdayAesthetic #PrayForDemi
CUBS envisions a country run by the people through frequent voting, town halls, weekly referendums, and bottom-up #democracy. 435 reps for a country of 300+ million is laughable. We need at minimum 50,000+ reps who wield no power until the constitution is rewritten by the people
@SpeakerRyan @MacTXPress @HASCRepublicans Combat troops should come from the top 1% of families. How many poor and working-class shall we send to their deaths while the wealthy have their private clam-bakes? Remember: Lobster used to be peasant food #directdemocracy
@NateSilver538 There is no such thing as congressional self-destruction in this post-democracy era. The onus is on US to destroy THEM. Reps should be figureheads like the Queen. We have the internet. Let’s run this country. JOIN CUBS
@NoKnownHeirs @Ocasio2018 It is basic and elemental to your Calvinist worldview, which is based upon warped logical fallacies meant to serve your hatred for the unclean.
@OurRevolution Representative democracy is at odds with economic equality. Short of a full-scale reign of terror on the rich, we must return legislative power to the people, who are overwhelmingly NOT RICH. Support candidates who take the CUBS PLEDGE
@NoKnownHeirs @Ocasio2018 Your argument is a horseshit and I can't believe you just embarrassed yourself on the internet for all your grandchildren to see. Laws have always been enemies of human rights. Slavery was law. Women not being able to vote was law. Human rights have always had the uphill battle
@NoKnownHeirs @Ocasio2018 I never said it was a law. We have spineless congressmen who do not legislate laws, they simply take taxpayer money. One could argue housing /healthcare fall under the "pursuit of happiness" clause. If the founding fathers knew about the internet, we would have direct democracy
Citizen A: I'm agoraphobic	Citizen B: You're afraid to go outside?	Citizen A: No, I'm afraid to vote	Citizen B: I'm sorry. If only we could harness the amazing technological advancement of the internet to ignite frequent online voting on a range of issues	#MondayMotivation https://t.co/pwjUwHyOB3
@RepRoKhanna Please also fight for fitness initiatives and weekly voting in your district. We must realize the full potential of our bodies.
@NoKnownHeirs @Ocasio2018 Owning-to-rent is ethically dubious. Housing, like healthcare, is a human right. The city cannot function without the blood, sweat, and empty bank accounts of the poor. They deserve housing - the landlord does not deserve profits. Put it to a vote.
@Ocasio2018 New York landlords should adhere to a "use it or lose it" policy. Any vacant apartment shall be rented or else you forfeit the property. JOIN CUBS
Eatin' good in my gentrified neighborhood. #IfMyLifeWereASlogan
@HouseGOP Hold them accountable by calling them names and hurting their feelings
DO NOT pay for your subway fare. A critical mass of turnstile-jumpers can send a message to demonic #democrat @andrewcuomo that New Yorkers are primed for a #coup if he wins a 3rd term. #mtaboycott #DINO #directdemocracy
@justicedems Representative Democracy Is inherently undemocratic. Cut out the middleman!
Poor people should get subsidized dry cleaning. When you live in poverty, you eat greasy food because it’s cheap. You get stains on your clothes because you’re starving and have to eat quickly. #TruthMatters
@SenGillibrand Representative Democracy is at odds with this sentiment. Return the government to the people through weekly voting, direct-action referendums, and online elections
@SenGillibrand @SymoneDSanders  https://t.co/D0U5fTITbM
@SenatorHeitkamp @NDStateFair Congressman and Senators need to go the way of these monarchs. Representative democracy is *not* democracy
It's not about voting in @HouseDemocrats or @HouseGOP - vote in representatives who will RELINQUISH their congressional power. Political norms are dictated by donors, not people. Representative democracy is an affront to #Equality. #SundayMorning #CutOutTheMiddleMan #Congress
@keithellison @Ocasio2018 We should be voting WEEKLY, on EVERYTHING. Reduce the role of congressman/senator to antiquated figurehead, like the Queen
@BrandNew535 @SenSanders @JamesThompsonKS @Ocasio2024 @Ocasio2018 Will they earn the CUBS endorsement? The future is not only post-partisan, but post-representative. There are 300+ mil Americans and 435 reps. Do the sad, sad math
@OurRevolution Representative democracy is at odds with this sentiment. We need direct-action, weekly voting and online referendums. The founding fathers did not envision a pop of 300+ mil and the internet
Paid weekly voting on Tuesday. $100 cash. Encourage the poor and struggling to show up at the polls by giving them a tangible incentive. #income
@NateSilver538 Polls are meaningless. We need weekly voting. Paid voting. And then we can see how the country, most of whom live in abject poverty, really feel about progressive  referendums
@guardian Mental health is largely ignored by the failed premise of representative democracy because talking about it exposes the root of many neuroses: financial insecurity, homelessness, bleak prospects. A substantial catalyst to many chemical changes in our brains is abject poverty
@HouseDemocrats and @HouseGOP: if you want to juice your dismal approval ratings, consider introducing legislation that returns congressional power to your constituents, not you. In a nation of 300+ million, a body of 435 reps cannot logically write laws supported by a majority.
Nvm! A claus in all “cast member” contracts stipulates that going on strike is grounds for immediate termination. At-will employment for the #win! #cinderellastories
What if the #Disney princesses were re-imagined as park employees striking outside of Downtown Disney? Little girls from all over the world could come see strong female characters standing up for their rights in the #workplace
CUBS is not affiliated with any major political party. Our endorsement criteria is strictly contingent on pledging to return the legislative/executive power of government to the citizenry through referendums, initiatives, and weekly voting.
CUBS aims to reduce the role of elected government representatives to mere figureheads, much like the British Monarchy.
CUBS advocates for direct-action democracy as opposed to representative democracy.
Cut out the middleman!
