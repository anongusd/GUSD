@RepChrisStewart @SenMikeLee @senorrinhatch	Thank you for your A ratings from the NRA.  Utah appreciates you and your stances you have taken regarding our rights to life, liberty, and freedom from Tyranny. https://t.co/GZNy4U99NY
@RepDavidYoung But..... Let's hold off on letting them purchase a firearm... Because they aren't yet responsible enough....
@DuszaLukasz @kurteichenwald @KyleKashuv Careful, you may he held liable if our friend Kurt has a physical response to the bright light  in the picture you shared....
@KyleKashuv Left is saying.. "it's okay, you can trust us.   Look at how effective we are...".
@KyleKashuv Mother lover.  Do these people think standing up for your God given rights is a "White" person thing?  That is the most ignorant assumption I have ever heard.
@RickyElHeat @DevinSenaUI @michaelianblack We can play this game for eternity.  My answer won't change.
@RickyElHeat @DevinSenaUI @michaelianblack I can see how you could interpret my tweet that way.  Personally I don't like gambling, but any laws regarding it should be made locally or at the State level.
@RickyElHeat @DevinSenaUI @michaelianblack And that sure stops it from occuring... About as effectively as gun control would be.

@piersmorgan I'll say it again.. it's not the size of the Constitution that matters... It's how you use it that matters.
@benshapiro It's not the size that matters.. it's how you use it.... I hope.

@Twooshorten @imrustyokay @alt_horizon @funkyshnelpu_jr @Revelaide @mxkai3 @Floppy_Ragdoll @megturney Native speaker here... Can confirm.. English sucks.
Just thinking tonight, gun control advocates point to Indiana as cause for Chicago's gun problems.  Think it clearly demonstrates that criminals will go around the law..

@LarryM4Utah what are your thoughts regarding the Senate filibuster rule?
@RepChrisStewart , @MittRomney mentioned a possibility of supporting a filibuster reform in the Senate.  No real clear answer as to what that could look like.
Had a phone town hall with @MittRomney today.  Great to hear some answers to questions important to Utah.
@RepJoeCourtney That is all great, but where are you getting the money from to pay for all that was in the bill?

@sltrib You going to publish any garbage sent to you without facts?!  I can make any claim I want without any supporting evidence...
@RepChrisStewart 	What are your thoughts on including the citizenship question in the 2020 census?
@SenMarkey Maybe it is because we deserve an accurate count of "Citizens" of the US.....
@SenatorMenendez Yes because allowing us common folk access to the information reserved for the elite while making decisions that impact every single one of us will directly harm the environment. Sounds like you don't trust your own science.
@IWantToBeTheSky @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA I appreciate your input.  My personal opinion is that the negative impacts of the prohibition far outweighed any perceived benefits of laws that came after.
@IWantToBeTheSky @NRA @ChrisCoxNRA Do tell, which laws are you referring to?
@realDailyWire Plot twist... The princess was actually a man all along.

@foxnewstalk @AnnCoulter The party is digging it's own grave.  It can still be saved, but it would take an act of God... Or basic principles.
@RonPaul I imagine Congress will be as diligently responsible with our personal data as they are with our tax dollars. . . .  Oh wait...
I am a state delegate and am very curious.
@MittRomney , @LarryM4Utah 	How would you have voted on omnibus?
@FoxNewsResearch @BretBaier A more accurate presentation of this data would be percentage of bills vetoed during their tenure.
@SpeakerRyan Where are you getting the money to pay for this?
@RepDaveBrat Thank you for saying no
@RepDavidYoung Sir, how are you paying for this?
@realDailyWire Easily the most surprising headline of the day.

@marklevinshow I second this motion.
@RepAndyBarr Interesting that your tagline says you want to restore fiscal responsibility in Washington.  Say one thing and do another.
@RepChrisStewart Seems common sense that there should be a mandatory public vetting time allotment prior to voting on legislation like this.

@LimburgGarth @johnniestephen @sltrib I don't think the study i cited included law enforcement.  I think that may be out of scope for the discussion.
@johnniestephen @LimburgGarth @sltrib https://t.co/A2XEomQHTS		Potentially 25,000 saved annually from defensive gun use.  If the data is correct and unbiased.  Safe to say more are saved by modern medicine.
@fox13 Oh good... Now that is settled.
