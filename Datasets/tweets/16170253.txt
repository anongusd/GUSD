@MattBruenig Yeah, it‚Äôs going to be a war. That one is unavoidable. You saying that also doing a big tax bill at the same time makes that war easier? I‚Äôm honestly not following
@MattBruenig In terms of a sweeping GND that does reshape the economy, yes, taxing the rich has to be a part of that. But it‚Äôs not to fund it, it‚Äôs to reshape the political economy. Not sure that‚Äôs needed for M4A
@MattBruenig You‚Äôre totally missing my point. All of these things are hard. All are important. But to say we can‚Äôt do M4A until we tax the rich is incorrect, is my point.
@MattBruenig Ending the fossil fuel industry and redirecting that into renewables would do a lot of that
@MattBruenig No, it means you should not link the fate of one important project (M4A, GND, etc) with a different important project (taxing the rich). Do them both, but each for their own reasons.

@ClaraJeffery @leahmcelrath @tomwatson During the 2016 campaign I was at The Huffington Post
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson It‚Äôs not bad faith. In all sincerity, and with a ton of respect for the journalism you‚Äôve done over the years, I genuinely think you‚Äôre wrong about this and are contributing, albeit with good underlying intentions, to mushrooming toxicity on this site. Just my 2 cents
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson You see this as jumping in your mentions to fight? To me the level of toxicity in this political moment is worthy of a real conversation. There are people like @tomwatson who are actively inciting it. I'm not trying to do that; if that's how you saw it, apologies and good night
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson I definitely don't think they are. That's not what I mean; I'm saying in general I avoid spats that tend to break down along those lines, because they're toxic and counterproductive. 		I do make a twitter-beef exception for Third Way https://t.co/B0fevo0WQp
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson Yeah, I mostly stay out of twitter beefs. I've concluded there really are no winners in fights between the Clinton crowd and the Bernie crowd, so I don't engage. If I see something truly egregious, sometimes I can't help but jump in, but it's rare, and I don't look for it
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson Alright, nevermind. If this is working for you, I‚Äôm in no position to say otherwise. Just all seems so toxic and I‚Äôd think after so many years it would be worth trying something different, just to see. But as you were.
@leahmcelrath @ClaraJeffery @tomwatson It is true twitter is full of scumbags, some human, some not. Only one candidate has this universal phenomenon weaponized against him
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson If I want him to be viable? I‚Äôm not a Bernie supporter. I like him just fine, but I just don‚Äôt understand why you troll his supporters with such ferocity. Seems so counter productive. Has any of this arguing with Bernie people led to any productive outcomes?
@ClaraJeffery @tomwatson You asked Bernie to denounce "supporters doling out online abuse." You didn't limit it to official surrogates. You rope in every bot and troll on the web, and then ask him to apologize for them. At least we know Tom exists, so that feels fairer. (Right?)
@EvanMZimmerman You have to earn a nuanced critique. This did not. Read it, it critiques itself.

@LizMair @kombiz It‚Äôll spur growth in some places and hurt elsewhere, right? Good reason not to start out with the payroll tax but keep it as an option
@LizMair @kombiz I see those as separate. Lots of those taxes should come back not for revenue but to attack inequality.
@LizMair Correct. Deficit finance it for the first few years with a tax that can kick in if we get inflation and need it
@zaron5551 Earned benefit is good politics. Medicare and Social Security are thought of as earned benefits and partly as a result they‚Äôre untouchable.

@rebeccanagle Which she apologized for.
@PrairieFire2016 @rebeccanagle This is not about instructing anybody Cherokee. CN obviously knows their history and the details of the fight with the Cherokee Freedmen. But most other people don‚Äôt, and this is a public website.

@rebeccanagle She apologized publicly, I don‚Äôt folllow		Also why hasn‚Äôt the conversation about ‚Äúmyths about blood and race‚Äù included the Cherokee Nation fight, that only ended in 2017, against Cherokee Freedmen for not having the ‚Äúblood of Cherokee‚Äù		I mean, that was 2017!

@rebeccanagle How do you go from there to saying she is ‚Äî today, after apologizing ‚Äî still enabling racism and appropriating genocide?
@rebeccanagle And those records were available to children to fact check their family lore?
@rebeccanagle And THAT is how she is enabling racism and appropriating genocide?
@rebeccanagle So wait ‚Äî if she proved she actually had some distant heritage, that would then be ok with you? 		I thought the problem was she was confusing citizenship issues		So all this really hinges on whether the stories she was told as a kid check out in 19th C files she had no access to?
@rebeccanagle Wait, what? How on earth could you possibly know that? That‚Äôs an extraordinary level of certainty 		Her entire family believes they have Cherokee ancestry. Her cousin famously wrote a Cherokee cookbook. She has apologized for any citizenship implication. But how are u so certain?
@rebeccanagle I‚Äôm also amazed that you‚Äôre blaming Warren for Trump‚Äôs comment (‚ÄúWarren enables this racism‚Äù). You sure about that?
@rebeccanagle Also to say she ‚Äúbelittles our genocide by appropriating it...‚Äù		That‚Äôs present tense. You‚Äôre a writer, you know that‚Äôs just false.

@rmc031 The ironic thing is that what‚Äôs implicit here is that an accusation of unhinged rage is a gendered critique. And it‚Äôs definitely understood that way. But that‚Äôs also obviously and hilariously wrong ‚Äî men rage all the damn time, for no reason.

@leahmcelrath If ones only gauge was this website, you‚Äôd assume the number is over 50% though. Turns out it‚Äôs just 1 in 10. 		A 5 point difference with Biden on that is barely outside the margin of error

@TheTurbantor @GlennKesslerWP It's a real abuse of the privilege of getting to be a fact checker/referee, to insert your own ideology, or your friend's ideology, into it
When Obama brought Furman into his administration, the left objected -- specifically because of Furman's belief that Walmart is good, among other things. To simply treat Furman's opinion as the only accurate view of the world is bizarre, and not how you do fact checking.
Furman has a particular view, that Walmart is actually good. Kessler says he's known Furman "for 20 years." That's fine, and Furman is totally free to believe that Walmart is progressive and good. But Kessler has no right to treat Furman's opinion as an objective fact.
Objectively, this @GlennKesslerWP fact check from yesterday should simply be retracted. It's just flat out wrong, even before you get to the question of the paper he cited titled "Walmart: A Progressive Success Story." https://t.co/VLT1PewfVl https://t.co/Qemdrhy3KQ

@PatrickRuffini Okay then call it a reduction in the rate of increase. That‚Äôs accurate. From there we can debate the merits. 		(I‚Äôd say wealth inequality should be reduced, not just slowed in its rate of growth.)
@PatrickRuffini Sure but the current wealth that is in the hands of people with more than $50MM would continue to grow even if they honestly paid this tax. They would still be richer the next year than the one before. That‚Äôs the opposite of wealth destroyed.

@KateAronoff Coal mining has plummeted precisely because of pricing issues, right?
@KateAronoff Yeah, hit those subsidies as part of the scheme and it matters. My thing is you have to make fossil fuels worthless because as long as they have value, somebody will try to extract them. Only alternative is to put armed guards at every field and mine in the world
@KateAronoff Cigarettes in the US were driven into the ground by tax policy and are now being replaced by a cleaner version. 		(Also oil companies have a very sophisticated understanding of the role taxes and subsidies play in their survival. We should match that.)

@GreenEggs42 @chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump That typically means it was unanimous
People: @realDonaldTrump does not have the power to shut down the government. With a two-thirds vote, Congress can override him and keep it open. 		The Senate already voted UNANIMOUSLY to pass its spending bill. 		The last House spending bill got 361 votes, way more than needed
@pwtenny They could do it. 290 votes for a short term CR isn't that hard.
Congress could override Trump's veto if it wanted to. So this is as much on McConnell and Ryan as Trump.

@ParkerMolloy @ZachWahls @jessforcongress She ran an entire campaign that was 100% in support of LBGT rights and was anti-racist to its core. The campaign and movement around it even engaged in effective anti-police violence work in a meaningful way, and shut down the privatization of prison services.

@Ocasio2018 @lbarronlopez But in the case of the woman at the top of @lbarronlopez‚Äôs story, I‚Äôd have also granted her anonymity if I firmly believed she was telling the truth
@Ocasio2018 @lbarronlopez At the Intercept we have an unusually strict rule around anonymous sourcing and a very high bar for it, and at first I chafed at it, but I‚Äôve come to respect it. It means fewer snarky blind quotes (sad!) and forces us to go an extra mile to nail something down.
@Michael2014abc @Ocasio2018 Absolutely. It‚Äôs almost always for political manipulation. So that‚Äôs why we have to talk to as many sources as possible to try to figure out when and how we‚Äôre being snowed.
@Ocasio2018 So ultimately it comes down to trust in the individual reporter and in the outlet to be an honest broker between those sources and the public. @lbarronlopez is a very good reporter and she clearly believed her sources were being straight with her. None of us are perfect though.
@Ocasio2018 My honest answer would be that the problem is: what is said publicly in DC is wildly different than what‚Äôs said privately, but what‚Äôs said privately is important for the public to know. If people won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt talk by name, but what they say is real and important, we publish it

@juliarosen @HotlineJosh What's this "would be"? We're not talking about an imaginary place or hypothetical people. They already exist, and already live there. It's just an argument for apartheid. (Not talking about you, Julia, I just see this often phrased as a hypothetical when it's not.)
@HotlineJosh It's in the state's Constitution. That won't be chanced by an election. The position you're staking out isn't remotely morally defensible.
@HotlineJosh So it's your position that the only way to maintain the country as a Jewish state is to deny equal rights to people who live under its control? That's really an acceptable position in the 21st Century?

@malcubed @colmanjduffy @EvanstonPrint @LoveEachother14 What he was able to pull away from King also matters, since the argument is that these racist voters are unmovable.
@malcubed @colmanjduffy @EvanstonPrint @LoveEachother14 Basically your analysis halves all swings by looking at one sided improvement. And I do think the median would be revealing because I suspect you‚Äôre right about the non evenly distributed delta. Combine that it aligns more with what it was: a huge swing
@malcubed @colmanjduffy @EvanstonPrint @LoveEachother14 Knowing the median would help a lot. Think about it this way: very few districts that Trump won by the same margins as IA04 flipped. If his swing was normal, you would expect flips at that range to be evenly distributed.
@malcubed @colmanjduffy @EvanstonPrint @LoveEachother14 You have a fundamental math error here. I'll give you a few minutes to think on it and see if you can spot it.
@colmanjduffy @malcubed @EvanstonPrint @LoveEachother14 It's an R+11 district, meaning in a normal year the R wins by 22, which is almost always what happened, except Scholten losing by a hair. There's no way to honestly pretend something big didn't happen there.

@diannaeanderson Anyway, apologies for coming off rude. I should be nicer on this site, if I want other people to be nicer. I don't agree with your broad takeaway from your time there at all, but I was too flip in dismissing it.
@LoveEachother14 yes, they don't even try to make it look organic anymore. Also, impressed they're on it on a Sunday evening. Hope that's time and a half.
@diannaeanderson Your book looks interesting. (I mean that, I'm gonna buy it.)
@NateSilver538 I'd mostly agree with that, but it was this part -- "every. single. day" -- that had me chuckling. https://t.co/XRRAIV8HVK
@shaunlysen @ChrisSturr @leahmcelrath Wait, so is her analysis supposed to be applied to rural america generally, as she says, or just those few counties in Iowa? Pick one.
@NateSilver538 The analysis also does not grapple with the massive Democratic comeback in Iowa in 2018, including @Scholten4Iowa nearly beating that white nationalist Steve King. Her analysis has no room for that to have occurred.
@NateSilver538 In general, yes, but she's claiming some elevated insight into an entire culture made up of tens of millions of people, basing that on four months of canvassing in a part of Iowa. Certainly enough to have real insight, but this let-me-put-the-conversation-to-bed thing is too much
@drogon_dracarys @jmartNYT Right, and also if the analysis does not break out evangelical and non-evangelical, it's confused from the start and probably useless
@brianefallon Eh, she found rural Iowans reacting negatively to Clinton and transforms that into evidence that they don't like Bernie's economic message. How would this thread explain @Scholten4Iowa nearly beating Steve King on an anti-monopoly, M4A message?
@TheTurbantor @RachelKasten I grew up in Still Pond, MD, population 250 before my brother and I left. Guess it‚Äôs 248 now. So therefore I am an expert.
@evergreentwete Maybe for those 4 counties. Maybe.
@ChrisSturr @leahmcelrath Also, it‚Äôs the Bernie bashers that always add ‚Äúwhite‚Äù to rural, thus erasing huge swaths of black rural America. The entire theory that rural areas are winnable often relies on turning out the black vote there and just losing the white vote a little less badly
@ChrisSturr @leahmcelrath Exactly. Also, where in SD and Texas? Suburbs or city there don‚Äôt count as rural just because coastal people think of the whole state as a monolith. Her dad now lives in a small town. Ok. 		She based this whole thing on interactions she had over four months in Iowa.

The same strategy is at work with the rhetoric No Labels uses. They don't say that they don't want people to have health care, because that would be politically toxic. But they use the same trick Penn used with Obama. It's not what they say -- it's what they don't.
If the rhetoric sounds familiar, that's because it rhymes with every other effort to elevate some particular portrait of America into an ideal. Anything that doesn't fit that ideal image -- black and brown people, single people, LGBT people -- is by definition un-American/3 https://t.co/8gQe3h2Xi6
What's so rare about this Penn memo is that it is very honest about how, by elevating Clinton's own American-ness, the *explicit goal* is to turn Obama into an other. Story here, with link to memo /2 https://t.co/IxOGCqwYqL https://t.co/OY2ubofZVd

@joanwalsh @luckybastard77 @DanteAtkins @markos @murshedz No. He was a palatable alternative to the whole caucus if Pelosi fell. Folks like Marcia Fudge just weren‚Äôt. And so that made it less likely she fell.
@joanwalsh @luckybastard77 @DanteAtkins @markos @murshedz Oh, yes. He publicly said he wasn‚Äôt challenging her. That‚Äôs not my claim.

@django_stiglitz I would but I'm on vacation. Maybe @akela_lacy wants to write it tomorrow
Here's a thread on a pretty interesting new agreement between @NancyPelosi and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which I believe goes by @USProgressives https://t.co/1fZXuOS4dE
If you got to the bottom of this thread, you care enough that you might as well sign up to get an email when my book comes out next year, which is on all of this ish https://t.co/XpHkXtQUAp
But there's a movement afoot to toughen up what it means to be in the CPC. So that, coupled with this announcement, would mean something about the ecosystem of money and politics in DC...
And there are a handful of CPC folks who are ALSO members of the New Dem caucus, which is utterly incoherent. So if those folks satisfy the quota for CPCers on a panel, you've gotten nowhere...
As @rmc031 &amp; I wrote, most of the CPC actually STILL takes corporate PAC money. There's pressure to stop, but they still do as of now. https://t.co/5IiCQ0HAtJ
If you're on the Financial Services Committee, for instance, that helps you raise gobs of money from banks. In exchange, you water stuff down. 		So this change says that, no, we're going to put some progressives on the committee, too, to actually legislate. Caveats...
Here's a longread from me and @ArthurDelaneyHP on how that works https://t.co/kf87akKYf1
...that Dems are not going to give every damn "money committee" seat to a New Dem or a Blue Dog to help them raise money for reelection. That's how they did it in '07 and '09 and it left the key committees stacked with reactionaries who watered down legislation and still lost/2
So, this is actually a really important progressive step, with some room for ratfucking and some caveats. In the House, "money committee" assignments are considered desirable because, wait for it, sitting on them helps you raise money. What this says is /1 https://t.co/arsqmjvM5F

Lipinski is pretty open about his hostility to LGBTQ rights, and Human Rights Campaign endorsed his primary challenger. Fudge backs marriage equality now, but her record on this is no secret. Nothing stopping her from cosponsoring the Equality Act.
