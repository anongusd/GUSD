First, he claimed the bill would allow federal employees to take six days off to ‚Äúknock doors." 		That's just false. 		#HR1 encourages federal workers to help address a critical shortage of poll workers by volunteering their time during election season.

The group puts up a front‚Äîthey claim that they‚Äôre running a grassroots-funded operation, when in reality, FreedomWorks relies on Big Money donors to keep the lights on.
In 2012 alone, FreedomWorks‚Äô non-profit moved millions of dollars in dark money to their super PAC, hiding the donors of that money.		Thanks to #CitizensUnited‚Äîthis is legal. It‚Äôs unacceptable for our democracy and Congressman @JohnSarbanes is leading the fight on #HR1 to fix it.
Since the #CitizensUnited decision, FreedomWorks has funneled millions of dollars in secret money into its super PAC, which then supports Republican campaigns.		This is wrong. Voters deserve to know who is paying to try to get their vote. 		#HR1 is the solution to this problem.

Well, I have to head back to the campaign trail now, Team ECU! Thanks for letting me tell you a little bit about my #KS02 campaign today. Let‚Äôs go win this!‚ÄîPD
If you live near #KS02, we need your help! My opponent has Big Money donors, but we have something better: Everyday Americans like you. 		It‚Äôs going to take friends talking to friends for us to win. You can find a volunteer event near you here. ‚ÄîPD 		https://t.co/leK1H5rRan https://t.co/d4zn5A6Mae

We only have 76 days before Election Day‚Äîand if we want to flip #KS02, we need all hands on deck. Here‚Äôs how you can help. ‚ÄîPD
I‚Äôm running to be a reformer‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what our first TV ad that we released last week focused on. Take a look. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/9GBTAxGgna
A year ago this month, ECU endorsed my campaign. 		I am so proud to be endorsed by this organization. ECU and its members are leading the fight in campaign finance reform and I am so excited to be on your team. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/jKYfoWohOe
I know that the fight for our democracy won‚Äôt be easy‚Äîbut it will be worth it. And I‚Äôm ready for the fight. ‚ÄîPD
Retweet if you agree. 		People elected to Congress should serve the people they represent, not corporate special interests and outside billionaires. ‚ÄîPD
I am fully committed to making sure stopping the influence of big money is a top priority in Congress if I‚Äôm elected in #KS02‚Äîand I believe that it is necessary to fix our broken political system. ‚ÄîPD
I even proposed a resolution calling on Congress to end corporate personhood, supported great disclosure requirements for independent expenditures, and voted to require disclosure of issue ad sponsors in Kansas. ‚ÄîPD
During my time working in the state legislature I made sure this was a focus of my work. 		I called for campaign finance reform, increasing transparency for outside spending in our elections and opposing the loosening of reporting requirements for gifts &amp; meals from lobbyists.‚ÄîPD
Part 4: Close the lobbyist revolving door. 		Public service should be about service, not learning the ‚Äútricks of the trade‚Äù for how to best exploit the system later as a lobbyist. ‚ÄîPD
Part 3: Close the loopholes that let foreign money into our elections. 		Kansans and Americans deserve to have faith that our elections are fair and free from outside influence. ‚ÄîPD
I‚Äôve seen first-hand how the lack of transparency can impact campaigns. My opponent‚Äôs dad created a super PAC to sidestep campaign contribution limits to funnel $600 million into his son‚Äôs primary. 		That‚Äôs not how our elections should work.‚ÄîPD https://t.co/NTv2OkVyxe
Part 2: Full disclosure of campaign spending. 		We must close gaping loopholes in election law that allow Big Money special interests to secretly funnel unlimited amounts of money into campaigns. ‚ÄîPD
Kansans want to end the unlimited special interest spending in elections.		A Constitutional amendment would allow Americans to reverse the disastrous Supreme Court decisions that promoted the ideas that ‚Äúmoney equals speech‚Äù and ‚Äúcorporations are people.‚Äù‚ÄîPD
Part 1: We need a Constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. ‚ÄîPD
Changing the campaign finance system is how we give Kansans back their voice and restore accountability to Congress.		That‚Äôs why earlier this year, I laid out a four part legislative plan of action to reform our rigged campaign finance system. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/Ls54SpMzpU
We‚Äôve reached a point where members of Congress all but ‚Äúrent themselves out‚Äù to high dollar campaign contributors‚Äîand Americans are fed up with billionaires setting the agenda. ‚ÄîPD
Washington is fundamentally broken‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt broken by Republicans or Democrats. It was broken by obscene amounts of money flooding our campaigns and elections. ‚ÄîPD
Before polls closed on primary night in Kansas, a super PAC funded by Nevada billionaires announced their first attack ad against me. I didn‚Äôt even know who my opponent would be! 		That‚Äôs not how government should work. ‚ÄîPD
What I heard on the road drove me to make campaign finance reform one of my top legislative priorities in my campaign for Congress. ‚ÄîPD
Before launching this campaign, I visited each of the 25 counties in #KS02 and heard similar frustrations from people in each county. 		Kansans are fed up with our broken campaign finance system and they want reform. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/J3oJaUOPGa
Now I‚Äôm running to represent of the people of #KS02 in Congress. Kansans need someone who will fight for them in DC.		Here‚Äôs my family on the day we launched the campaign a year ago this month! It was my parent‚Äôs wedding anniversary, which made the day even more special. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/mVsbniPzOF
I used my law degree to always fight for fairness and equality. I then went on to serve in the Kansas state legislature from 2003 to 2015 and worked to represent the voices of all Kansans. ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/yUEatCMTXC
First, I want to tell you a little bit about myself. 		I am a life-long Kansan and am very proud about it. This is my wife, Stephanie, &amp; my daughter, Caroline. Caroline goes to the same elementary school I went to. (And the one my mom taught at!) ‚ÄîPD https://t.co/RW5of0G8h9

It‚Äôs a busy day here in Montana, so I need to give back the keys to this account. Thank you all for joining me today! Stay up to date with the work we‚Äôre doing in Montana by following me @GovernorBullock. Let‚Äôs get to work.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
It‚Äôs within Montana‚Äôs century of heritage that I‚Äôm hopeful for the future. Generations of Montanans to come deserve a government that works for them, not for the corporate elite. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/8FEVq1BskL
Montana is often called the Last Best Place for our mountains and rivers. But with this executive order, I‚Äôm showing that we can be the last best place for politics again, too. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
I hope other states follow in my example and pass measures or sign executive orders that require more transparency from these big corporate interests. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
Transparency is vital. All Americans deserve to know who‚Äôs buying their representatives. It‚Äôs time to show that no matter which IRS code they try to hide behind, the people have the right to know who‚Äôs being bought. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
Recently it was reported that a dark money group affiliated with @SpeakerRyan accepted a huge check from just 1 donor. 		What do you think they got for that contribution? One thing is clear. Paul Ryan isn‚Äôt standing with his constituents‚Äîhe‚Äôs working to help Big Money donors.‚ÄîSCB https://t.co/8RzIMbvrJ9
.@SpeakerRyan is one of the worst when it comes to this issue‚Äîwhich is why End Citizens United has named him to their #BigMoney20 list. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/uHsWqM9kXD
This executive order aims to eliminate the shroud dark money corporate donors hide themselves in. If NASCAR drivers need to display their donors for everyone to see, so should politicians. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
Last week I stopped by @amprog to talk about my plans for this executive order in the hopes it becomes the gold standard for states across the country. 		Take a look here.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/1NSo1eZAr0
Just because the Supreme Court ruled against our history doesn‚Äôt mean our belief in what democracy should look like is any less strong. That‚Äôs why last week, I signed the executive order Disclosure of Dark Money Election Spending by Recipients of Large Public Contracts‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/vprIgicWN8
As Governor, I haven‚Äôt stopped fighting though. I‚Äôve signed multiple laws supported by Democrats and Republicans to make government more transparent for Montana families. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/coFJ6iyANl
That was all until the disastrous decision of Citizens United. The Supreme Court‚Äôs decision uprooted a century of legal precedent, and once again opened the door for corruption. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
The law meant that Montanans took back a government that belonged to them, and only to them‚Äînot wealthy corporations and not outside special interests. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
But in the next few years public opinion changed and Montanans stood up to this corruption. In 1912, Montana voters passed the Corrupt Practices Act, an act that aimed to bar corporations from influencing elections. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
As posts were bought off and voters persuaded, the sole idea of democracy was eroding. Even the great author Mark Twain thought so, famously stating the Copper Kings ‚Äúso sweetened corruption that in Montana it no longer has an offensive smell.‚Äù‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
One of the Copper Kings, the amazingly bearded William A. Clark (see photo), literally bought himself a U.S. Senate seat. He famously declared, ‚ÄúI never bought a man who wasn‚Äôt for sale.‚Äù ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/ZwuACccTir
Way back at the turn of the century, wealthy miners in Montana, known as the Copper Kings, owned much of our state, including our politics. In modern day money they spent nearly 100 million dollars to influence every corner of Montana politics. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/cA9rEndXtP
Montana is especially important in the fight against money in politics. It‚Äôs Montana that gives precedent, and shows the history of how money left unchecked will corrode democracy and corrupt absolutely.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
As Governor of Montana, I‚Äôm working to make sure the elections in my state are more transparent. It was a big issue that I campaigned on when I ran in 2012.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/WpiAt32g5W
Voters know that government doesn‚Äôt seem to work for them anymore‚Äîthere are too many special interest groups buying our democracy. MT families believe we need to get money out of politics. I‚Äôm working to ensure we‚Äôre putting power back into the hands of everyday folks.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
I ran for re-election in 2016. I didn‚Äôt want to stop serving Big Sky Country. Trump won our state by 20 plus points, but the people of Montana re-elected me at the same time. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol https://t.co/AoJ4bqTRDR
We‚Äôre more alike than we are different. People want to be represented by someone that cares about them, and who will fight for them, instead of cozying up to corporate interests. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
Some people believe it‚Äôs hard to be a Democrat in ‚ÄúRed State,‚Äù but I‚Äôve learned that showing up, listening, and making the case for progressive policies delivers real results. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
As Attorney General, I realized I wanted to do more for the citizens of the great state of Montana, so in 2011 I decided to throw my hat into the Governor‚Äôs race. It was a close one, but thanks to a lot of hard work from my great team, I was elected. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
We didn‚Äôt win that battle, but believe me, I haven‚Äôt given up trying to ensure Montanans voices are the ones we‚Äôre prioritizing in our elections. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
You see, here in Montana, when Citizens United was decided, we had already had a 100-year-old ban on corporate campaign donations. I challenged the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to try to protect this law. ‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
In 2008, I had the honor of being elected Attorney General of Montana. In this role, I fought tooth-and-nail to challenge the Supreme Court‚Äôs awful Citizens United decision.‚ÄîSCB #mtpol
