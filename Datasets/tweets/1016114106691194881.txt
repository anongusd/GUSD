@SenatorAitzaz They have been fed lies. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
@POTUS are we allowed to have freedom to practice our religion. This is america, land of the free, so y put a stop. I try to treat them all equally.
@POTUS Under Sunni and Shia Islamic marital jurisprudence, Muslim men are allowed 2 practice polygyny, that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four. Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted
