@nineteenx89 Start earning Star Rewards with your next purchase!
@leiileiijaee203 It's the pick-me-up your afternoon is calling for!
@gorgnaae Stop by and see us soon!
@JessicaFay88 It's a refreshing sip of spring no matter the season!
@mshoneylemonn That's one our favorites, too!
@freddro_loe It's berry delicious!
@LizbethOrtiz09 That's a delicious favorite combination, Liz!
@stillgrieving Did you try our Cinnamon or Caramel Cloud Macchiato?
@xdollfaceeex Our Cloud Macchiato looks so good it's worth showing off!
@buwygibsabrina Do you know what else provides shade? Clouds. Just another sign you need to try our Cloud Macchiato. 😉
@Elizabe70180027 @ArianaGrande That looks Cirrus-ly delicious!
@miakobylski Mia, thanks for sharing! This is putting a smile on our face!
@buwygibsabrina It’s a luxurious twist on the Caramel Macchiato you know and love, with a layer of our new, silky Cloud Foam.
@grandesmileeee Next time try our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato and let us know which one is your favorite!
@unlvalumni99 Our Cloud Macchiato is unique compared to our other beverages. After a few minutes, the cloud foam layer will become more incorporated into the espresso. We recommend enjoying it right away!
@AGRANDESWEETE @ArianaGrande The fluffy Cloud Foam looks delicious!
@jetvoigt Yum! 😋
@maclover9930 It’s a perfect treat with layers of flavor that are smooth, light, and balanced!
@BijouStar1 @ArianaGrande Our Cloud Macchiato is available in the US and Canada!
@irresistiblyana It’s a luxurious twist on the Caramel Macchiato you know and love, with a layer of our new, silky Cloud Foam!
@justinfilthy Our Cloud Macchiato will be staying with us, so you'll have plenty of time to try this delicious beverage!
@VanessaDeLuna12 @ArianaGrande We aren't saying, "thank you, next," to this beverage!
@TheProtegeEmily The light, fluffy texture of the foam creates a unique and different experience from our other Macchiatos!
@Empepe3 We don't but we love this! Do you have one of our Military Family Stores near you by chance?
@VanessaDeLuna12 @ArianaGrande Lucky for you, Vanessa, our Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@MissSarahLouise Fluffy, silky, and creamy are our favorite ways to describe it!
@ayy_marikzaa Someone has to do it. 😉
@ToriYoungelman Amazing because of you! 💚
@dscarlett98 We'd be misleading you if we said there was. These are, however on our lower calorie side with only 180-190 calories for a grande.
@citygorl We Cirrus-ly love our Cloud Macchiato!
@vickdabrick18 We're always changing and evaluating our menu. Stay tuned for what is up-and-coming for Summer 2019!
@forevernesto While our Cloud Macchiatos contain the same amount of espresso as our traditional Macchiatos, the Cloud Foam is very light and airy. After a few moments it does begin to incorporate into the espresso.
@nickdsec Have a quick chat with your barista, this varies from store to store.
@osnapitzLinLin We're all in!
@shaima_karam94 It’s a perfect treat with layers of flavor that are smooth, light, and balanced!
@GrandeLovato97 You'll need to steer clear of this one as the Cloud Foam cannot be made without the egg white powder. So sorry. 😔
@jaeeelizabeth It's the least we can do. Thanks for being you!
@kaszzyyy You might think we're nuts, but we totally agree!
@popspeach @venicetheseries Seeing you was the highlight of our day, Leah!
@xo_breee_xoxo Our Pink Drink is our Strawberry Acai Starbucks Refresher made with Coconutmilk!
@titodbm Wow! That looks like perfection!
@Ash_attacks @ArianaGrande Ashley, we're thrilled you loved it!
@benbow77 Happy Friday! You can in the following countries: UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Mexico, and the Republic of Ireland. Safe travels!
@RaBaer Proud to be your partner, Rachel. 💚
@Kaytee_V1983 That combo has us floating on cloud nine!
@ShyamalaLR You can learn more about Starbucks parental leave benefits here: https://t.co/G4CGIwDZZe.
@Reasel So deserved!
@IlseMonette We'll raise a glass to this! ☕
@Ash_attacks @ArianaGrande It’s a perfect treat with layers of flavor that are smooth, light, and balanced!
@romney_mary And she's incredible!!!
@oliviadeann00 @ArianaGrande Good thing it's cloud and not smoke though. 😉☁☕
@lelisisrael_ We can't think of a better way to start of the weekend than to be lifted up by a cinnamon cloud! Happy Friday!
@SendaCow We're excited to support social and economic empowerment leading to healthier homes and families in Rwanda!
@msmonicabarber Friday done right! 🙌
@UNICEFUSA Excited to help girls like Binta realize their full potential!
@JanetSanford60 The Cherry Mocha was just here to be your special Valentine. We're thrilled that you made such a strong connection and hope that you'll share your love story at https://t.co/SPH9PuUUvR
@JazminAmanda_ Our Cloud Macchiatos provide a unique and light experience that is best when enjoyed immediately as the airy and light Cloud Foam is designed to intermingle into the espresso. 💚
@shanee72 Not us! 😉
@MrJayChristian Apologies for the inconvenience! Due to the brewing process, we’re only able to make a limited amount each day.
@Cory_Beam Sorry about that! The slow steep time limits the amount we can make daily, so it’s only available while supplies last. We’d recommend getting to your store extra early!
@FlyingKrazyKat So sweet! Our e-gift cards may be an option? https://t.co/QODZxMnTHA
@InsetFrostbyte We're proud to be April's partner! 💚
@LuthWorldRelief Thank you for promoting leadership opportunities for women and families to break down barriers to education, clean water and sanitation, and economic opportunities!
@okcoolandrew Now that would be interesting! 🤣
@sethnunley_ Stirring not necessary but we do recommend that for the best coffee experience, that you drink it shortly after receiving. Cheers!
@ky9 Yes, they sure are! Congrats on your little one!
@JulbertBri 💚
@SUPAAN0VA Our Double-Smoked Bacon, Cheddar &amp; Egg Sandwich is a delicious choice! We also recommend trying one of our amazing Starbucks Refreshers!
@lawddddthatslo Yum! 😋
@JulbertBri Sometimes you just need both of your favorite Breakfast Sandwiches!
@asiaajai That's a great combo, Hillary! Stop by and see us soon!
@TristinHanson_ Floating in the clouds is here to stay! Our Caramel Cloud Macchiato is sticking around.
@LivMac_Kenzie Indeed it is!
@heathernewm Sometimes the little things mean the most. 💚
@littlebluedog It's never too late! We're thrilled you loved our Sous Vide Egg Bites!
@GenesisOrizaba Next time you stop by, pair your favorite Oatmeal with our Cloud Macchiato!
@AlisonEBM Yes, we can definitely agree with that!
@starrcinema Not possible as the Cloud Foam powder contains sugar. Sorry.
@diewithurpawsup Many of them you can use an alternative milk and skip the whip and still be set for some happy sipping, but some include layers of Cold Brew Whipped Cream making this impossible. Which one are you eyeing?
@nicolerae32 Milk provides a bit of sweetness naturally, but this was not designed to be an overly sweet sip. 😊
@cinnamonandzoey The Cloud Foam is made with the egg white powder and without it, there's no fluff. What about trying our Iced Cinnamon Almondmilk Macchiato? https://t.co/Nt2IqJ5FlT
@pja700 Nope, not raw, but we do use egg white powder in our Cloud Foam.
@fawich Sure thing! And you can download Siren wallpapers here: https://t.co/p4p18CU3zx.
@LivMac_Kenzie You can never go wrong with treating a friend. 💚
@seanmacdhai Can't go wrong if you try both! 😉
@swiftmulaney We 💚 this!
@Idesha_B Thanks for giving this a try! While it contains the same amount of espresso as our traditional macchiatos the foam is light and airy and is designed to intermingle with the espresso. For the best  experience, sipping on this right after you receive it is best. 💚
@fawich Vivian, a designer whose work frequently graces our mugs and coffee packaging—including this year’s Christmas Blend—turned her imagination and artistic talent toward our #StrongLikeCoffee Siren.
@sydneycbailey Sorry for any disappointment. After a few moments, the fluffy and airy Cloud Foam begins to intermingle with the espresso. For the best experience we recommend that this drink is experienced soon after receiving.
@JeanSupreme76 Your kind words have us walking around with our head in the clouds! ☁💚☁
@Jcaaps We're stoked to hear that! ☺️
@ShannonRenae7 🤗💚
@bayleebooskie You got it! It's here to stay! 😉
@bayleebooskie That's awesome, Baylee! We're so happy you love it as much as we do!
@Michelle_Neller Every sip will have you on cloud nine!
@Gertiisufii Cake Pops for the win!
@hellolondyn It's the best! 🙌
@KatieBethJ You're welcome! We can't wait for you to join us on cloud 9!
@JaimePalma @ArianaGrande @iztlali03 Life is sweeter in the clouds! ☁☕☁
@cherrylover808 @ArianaGrande Can't wait to see you floating on a caramel cloud!
@wanderlustpnw No need for a rain of tears. The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@ninughhh Cascara is available at stores which feature Nitro Cold Brew! You can find your closest location here: https://t.co/NSSk2dTSLJ
@KatieBethJ It's equally delightful hot! We hope you'll soon be sipping on a cloud.
@CPlochTeach Here's to spending your spring break in the clouds!
@montanodaisy1 That's the very definition of self-care!
@BtaMak1378 @ArianaGrande Love is in the air! But more specifically, in the clouds. 😉 ☁💚☁
@MoonlightStarAG @ArianaGrande That tall order is sure to keep your head in the clouds and your taste buds floating on air!
@JeanSupreme76 @ArianaGrande Even the hail wants to be worthy of the Cloud Queen. ☁
@Melissa_Hanson_ @ArianaGrande Finding a new fave always feels like walking on air! Are you floating on a Caramel or a Cinnamon Cloud?
@ccolon92 Please don't be sour about this news, but the Lemon Cake Pop will only be available for a limited time. The sweet news is that the Lemon Loaf will still be around to fill you with citrusy, buttery goodness.
@_kosmonaught_ Happy to keep your taste buds dancing on air! ☁💚☁
@JohnJBroussard Fact! 🙌
@reesecup31 It's the little things! Have a great day, Ali!
@kath_krueger Today and every day the Siren celebrates women who are strong like coffee.
@Emmmmmilyyyyyy Glad to hear that! Enjoy!
@ShannonRenae7 You're in for a treat, Shannon! This drink has a silky and creamy texture that makes it truly unique!

@B_pacheco1993 The fluffy and silky texture makes this drink so unique! We hope you'll try it, Brenda!
@GhostinMarcos Good morning! Enjoy your drink. Happy Friday! 😊
@toriiwayne Hey, Tori! If you'd like to see it on the menu, you can let us know here: https://t.co/EFFd3FUwu4
@oneofafind_ Enjoy!
@SavannahTays Hey, Savannah. You can order it with coconutmilk or soymilk! But, please note, the caramel sauce does contain dairy and there is egg whites in the Cloud Powder.
@hannastarkie Almost! We made the Cloud Macchiato with cloud lovers in mind and knew the Cloud Queen Ariana would love it! ☁️
@AsToldByGaby Well, if you REALLY want a coffee all is not lost. 🤣
@mrsmichalosky86 So very welcome. 💚
@LiLaScher21 It's a unique and luxurious twist on our Caramel Macchiato that will leave you floating! Milk is blended with vanilla syrup to create our new Cloud Foam, then layered with espresso and topped with Caramel drizzle. Delish!
@slayinb__ This one is pretty great too! It's not overly sweet, but for extra sweetness add a few additional pumps of vanilla syrup and sip away! https://t.co/JNfIGgp7sM
@thatoneanimal Take a sip and float away with us!
@rdoroshuk Please note, in addition to the recos given, that to make this fully dairy-free you'd want to hold the caramel sauce as well. 💚
@drunken_dayze It's not as the Cloud Foam contains egg white powder. Sorry!
@UziGoat Little secret. Order a Caffe Mocha and add in a few pumps of peppermint syrup. Cheers to dreaming great big holiday dreams year round!
@Alicia_kendra This is great! Bring your cup in and simply hand it to the barista when placing your order. A big thank you for helping us help the environment! 🌎
@sophieeersm There is. Our Cloud Powder to make the Cloud Foam contains egg white powder.
@Pr_incorporated We're keeping our head in the clouds by keeping the Caramel Cloud Macchiato around!
@whizzer_wins It does, but a possible fix to make this drink dairy free is to substitute the 2% milk with coconutmilk or soymilk and then hold the caramel sauce.
@livy_lou1 Because you asked nicely...the Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@mrsmichalosky86 It does, Christina. While you can customize with sugar-free vanilla, the Cloud Powder to create the Cloud Foam contains sugar as well.
@cicicheyve One is and one isn't. Our Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay while our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato is only here for a few weeks.
@MyaMurray12 Come float away with us and try one of our Cloud Macchiatos, Mya! https://t.co/J07lo5Fn03
@Poolie_Express We deserved that. 😟
@Jenn21542304 Keyword here, most. All company-owned stores (standalone) in the US and Canada are in the cloud creating business. Some stores in airports and within other establishments, such as campuses, may not be participating.
@LukeMcM11 Yes! It is served lightly iced.
@vdizzleswizzle Not at this moment, sorry!
@wonderlandtayyy Yay for customizing already!  Almondmilk would be the creamier of the 3, but you wouldn't want to use that as a substitute always because sometimes coconutmilk, for instance, can give a tropical taste that is totally unique and fun.
@kittywaht To clarify, we use egg white powder in our Cloud Foam. When it’s blended with 2% milk and our vanilla syrup it creates a flavorful and fluffy Cloud Foam!
@xvoightshelley 🙌
@__Lexx Up in the clouds is the place to be!
@lexitheswiftie Tell that sweet friend of yours that we love him too. 😘
@wonderlandtayyy We'll do better than that! Coconutmilk, almondmilk and soymilk can be swapped in lieu of milk for a majority of our drinks. If you want to share which drink you're leaning towards we can share the alternative milk that we think would be the best substitute!
@AtomicStingRay Totally cute, but no. It's available in all sizes. ☺️
@AsToldByGaby Oh, but in some places we are! Follow the link and filter for 24-hour stores. Our fingers are crossed for one near you! https://t.co/acDQgAO8I5
@Awkward_Anna_ To clarify, we use egg white powder in our Cloud Foam. When it’s blended with 2% milk and our vanilla syrup it creates a flavorful and fluffy Cloud Foam!
@fakesmilemarin You're right. We should. So we did! The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay! However, the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will only be earthbound for a limited time.
@beyonxiana It's an incredibly impossible task. The Cloud Foam contains egg white powder. Sorry!
@arosales_ Never fear, our app is here! No worries about saying a mouthful, tap and enjoy! 😉	https://t.co/0hlOhsuJyr
@GabyAyye Love you a billion times more! 💚
@ksgross100 Correct, the Cloud Foam contains egg white powder.
@EzzyN7 So glad to hear it! Did you try it hot or iced? ☁️
@AdrianBrinkley *Screams in Ariana Grande whistle tone* https://t.co/cjkQfYxSAt
@hayleighdowneyy Imaaaaagine a sip like that. ☺️ https://t.co/JvmwARO5yS
@attemptingbutch Click, click, click n' post! 💚 https://t.co/4WItFIaj5T
@jay_fuc Here's to celebrating your birthday in the clouds!
@VictoriaMonet 😘
@justinsdaenerys The forecast says that participating company owned and licensed stores in the US and Canada will have cloud cover.
@_kosmonaught_ You're going to be happily living in the clouds! The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay! However, the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will only be earthbound for a limited time.
@JenniferTyree How does an Iced London Fog Tea Latte sound to you? https://t.co/jB2LA5J30S
@Poolie_Express Ahhh, we're going to break your heart, but it's not returning this year. 😟
@enorr592 You'll need to stick with the traditional Caramel Macchiato for this one, Liz.
@Jennlizvid Definitely! Our original Cold Foam is not going anywhere!
@AshleyMarieeeC The Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will float away after a few weeks, but our Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@philoSOFIA9 Sure can, find the info here: https://t.co/J07lo5Fn03
@aborgstrom5 We'll miss you but we believe in you!
@JpezMoonMoon @ArianaGrande Finding a new favorite always makes us feel like we're floating on a cloud!
@xvoightshelley Can you say that again? 😉
@bulewold Good question! It's not a tea in our stores, rather a part of our Starbucks Refreshers line - regardless, it's refreshingly delicious. Would you mind sharing more about your experience with @StarbucksHelp?
@gisellecmc It's worth a try. It offers the creaminess and a touch of berry, making it similar.
@KeepUpWithAzia What's wrong with right now? That's definitely delish!
@gisellecmc So sorry that you're missing it. Is it possible that a Mocha or a Latte with raspberry syrup could substitute?
@mschmit When the little people in our lives deserve a treat, Cake Pops are always a hit. On the drink side of things, our Strawberry Creme Frappuccino, Vanilla Bean Creme Frappuccino, Steamed Apple Juice, Hot Chocolate or Vanilla Creme may be the perfect treat. Enjoy!
@prince_erin Since this particular product is out of circulation in our stores, we won't be able to track down that information for you. Is there another bottle from our current collection we can help you with?
@rachooodalaig Take a peek at them here: https://t.co/J07lo5Fn03
@blxcksaturns It's not overly sweet. Increasing the amount of syrup and drizzle will increase the sweetness to your liking.
@nasaswt If the Caramel Cloud Macchiato is your thing, it's here to stay, however our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will quietly float away after a few weeks. Cheers!
@aourid_zineb Prices will vary depending on the size and your location. Feel free to take a look in your app should you have it!
@GabyAyye Decaf espresso is totally doable should you be trying to avoid caffeine, but there is no substitute for espresso at this time.
@danaerrys Most stores will be serving these up in the US and Canada.
@Longshotlegend We see you, William!
@gotregina Good question! The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay, but our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will be floating away after a few weeks. ☁️
@sarahmichelexo Hey! The Cloud Foam contains egg white powder, making this impossible to make vegan. So sorry.
@ARMYiGot7_LY Either, or! We're ready to make them both ways. 💚
@dannxiel After a few minutes, the cloud foam layer begins to intermingle with the espresso resulting in less foam. We recommend enjoying it right away!
@lexitheswiftie Pricing for our Cloud Macchiatos will vary from region to region.
@politicalth0t The fluffy, cloud-like foam is the base of the beverage and, while it contains the same amount of espresso shots as a traditional Macchiato, the way the foam intermingles with the espresso allows for a totally unique coffee experience that we hope you love!
@trashcannoli The Cloud Foam contains egg white powder and as such, this cannot be made vegan. Sorry. 🙁
@imagineeButeraa The good and the bad... The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay, however our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will float away after a few weeks.
@juxtinftgrande Don't be hatin! You can enjoy the Cloud Macchiatos without the espresso. Just ask your barista for a steamer. ☁💚☁
@tfarnsworthx You can find the Cloud Foam ingredients here, please note that it does contain eggs: https://t.co/J07lo5Fn03
@elbethelm While we can use an alternative milk and skip the caramel drizzle, the Cloud Powder to make the Cloud Foam contains egg white powder making this impossible. Sorry!
@__Lexx It's March 7th and it's here!!! Come float away with us! https://t.co/WzHkwTMNOf
@ChemicalSana You asked, we listened! We're rolling out Starbucks Delivers to select stores in 7 large US cities now!
@kiIIashaw You know it! Enjoy!
@arixbazzi The Cloud Foam does not have lemon but our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato has an incredible (well we think so) cinnamon lemon syrup. 😋
@itsjkwok Now that's a pretty cloud! Mixed or not, we're glad you enjoyed it!
@RikiYamada Whole lotta yum in one bite!
@emilymayox_ How about right now? 😉
@EmileeLindner Sorry, no. The Cloud Powder used in the Cloud Foam contains egg white powder.
@JulieDiCaro Reusable cups are one of our most favorite things! When ordering simply hand your cup to your barista and they'll happily use it. 💚
@trustaviation We reached to the sky and told them that Cloud Queen Ariana had requested their presence and they just dove into our cups. ☁💚☁
@asapsash Don't let the snow clouds stop you. Just reach for the sky and enjoy them floating atop your Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato!
@_queenjoce Love is in the clouds! ☁💚☁
@leandrea47 We've brought the clouds down to earth to live in your cup! The Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay! However, the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will only be earthbound for a limited time. ☁💚☁
@Nick_LGrant Your forecast calls for cloudy with a 100% chance of fabulous!
@oneofafind_ Hey, Kirsten! It's only the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato that's available for a limited time but the Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@Evanator_Marci Woohoo! 🤗
@lawphase It's amazing what a little ☁️ can do!
@hopelessmaya While they're not metal, we do offer reusable straws (in addition to reusable cups and lids)! 💚 Our new Siren Reusable Cold Cup w/ Straw + Lid is available for $3.
@xo0jade You're so welcome! Have a great day!
@mmae_24 Glad to hear you enjoyed it, Mandy!
@Tiziaguilar_ Awesome!

@Erica_Barker12 Yes! And it's here to stay, Erica!
@xo0jade Hey, Jade. If you'd like to see a drink on the menu, let us know! https://t.co/EFFd3FUwu4 As an option, we recommend trying the Very Berry Hibiscus Starbucks Refreshers with coconutmilk!
@C_Cooper_22 Nitro Cold Brew for the win!
@LittleGPdog Cinnamon + Espresso + Cloud Foam = a few of our favorite things. 💚
@suhwizzle You like our cloud? Gee thanks, just made it. 🤗
@erica_stewartt 10 out of 10 cloud specialists would agree with you. ☁️🤓💚
@myabrianne_21 We have to agree! https://t.co/IqPVDI9zyl
@helio_sylva Sure is! It's a luxurious new way to love your macchiato! Our cascading espresso intermingles with our new light and silky Cloud Foam offering a totally unique coffee experience.
@vdizzleswizzle So sorry, it's not. While we can substitute an alternative milk and hold the caramel sauce, the cloud powder cold foam contains egg.
@tommonjh It is unique compared to our other beverages as the fluffy, cloud-like foam offers an experience like no other while allowing you to enjoy the same amount of espresso as a traditional macchiato.
@SIZZLERGRANDE 50/50 here. Our Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay while our Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will be visiting our menu for a few weeks. 💚
@smgftkylie @ArianaGrande Hey! Our Cloud Macchiatos are at participating stores in Canada and the US.

@hisfinalsuit Great! That's something we love to hear!
@stonehenge101 Cloud Macchiato + beautiful scenery = Happiness! 💚
@m_esp1202 @ArianaGrande For crying out cloud, that's a good looking drink! ☁💚☁
@timeless_ari You're welcome! Happy to have you join us in the clouds! ☁💚☁
@mikecabral101 @ArianaGrande It's a cumulonimbus of flavor!
@timeless_ari It's a perfect storm of flavor!
@mvlisaa @ArianaGrande When the Cloud Queen recommends something, we give it a cirrus listen. ☁💚☁
@josepalma127 Happy to have you here on cloud nine! ☁💚☁
@blazedvIogs You can also experience the love in the clouds without the espresso. Just ask your barista for a steamer!
@eeemillieee We made the Cloud Macchiato with cloud lovers in mind and knew the Cloud Queen Ariana would love it!
@ChloeSgrd @ArianaGrande Take a deep breath like, "Ooh" 🎵
@peterkavinsy They are available at participating company owned and licensed stores in the US and Canada.
@ellsxbrown Any day when you can keep your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground is a good day!
@AshB205 You're welcome! We always want you to enjoy your beverage to its full minty potential.
@olddirtyylrac @ArianaGrande We see it, we like it... 🎵
@UjinTof_u0 It's available in the US and Canada at this time.	P.S. WE LOVE YOU! 💚
@nasasval While we love those down under, we're not floating this one to Australia. 😟
@arisuccessfulg We're not going global with this one, Jessica. Sorry!
@mariMGC @Starbucksnews Not at this time, sorry.
@sweeteners_ari Sorry Linnea, it's not available in Sweden. 😟
@tragictrashed Sure can!
@goodnightngosm Canada too! Enjoy!
@AshB205 Peppermint syrup is available all year long! You can add it to your mocha from the Flavors option in the app or just ask your barista!
@Bustos17648637 @ArianaGrande We're happy to make it with decaf espresso. Please don't hesitate to ask!
@Franciscocoria3 No way, it's here to stay! Can you send us the location please?
@MrJJoeJoseph Yes. Sorry for any confusion, but this was not a valid Starbucks offer. This post was completely false. The best way to confirm a promotion is through our Starbucks app, to reach out to our customer care line, or to visit one of our stores and ask your barista.
@lovekaren_ Ahhh thank you!!! Sounds like your tipping option may have gotten toggled off. To turn it back on, go to the gear (top right) and scroll down to tipping, make sure it's turned on. Cheers!
@HanGriz @ArianaGrande When the Cloud Queen makes a recommendation, you know you're about to find yourself on cloud 9!
@TooMuch4Me2Know Self-love always wins!
@sakuramichis Try our Blonde Roast or our Cold Brew. 😊
@rt90501 @GitRDoneLarry Hush! Age is just a number.
@jennikirch On second thought, we're seeing a turtle and a chicken...
@WoeIsWendy We like clouds, she likes clouds... ☁️

@arianasphere We're working on it. All stores will have the new lids by 2020. We appreciate your support and patience immensely!
@BrianLesko6 Tell us that you got your Stars today?!?
@Vader0309 It was an LTO and has been removed from our menu for the year. Thoughts on a Vanilla Latte with steamed cinnamon in your milk + a sprinkle of cinnamon on top?
@BenitoCamargo6 Voila! https://t.co/J07lo5Fn03
@CFlethJr You're onto something! Have you tried it yet?
@arabthot @ArianaGrande Hi. This is a fake offer and not valid at Starbucks. To confirm any Starbucks promotion, you can check your Starbucks app, reach out to our customer care line, or ask your Starbucks barista.
@mrtimchan 👀
@notearsgng @ArianaGrande Always gonna love you more! 💚
@faIIininyou @showyousarah We don't have mango any longer, but this is perfect!  https://t.co/1FMMC7kNCx
@CHWorldTour Only our most passionate, engaged and knowledge-seeking partners are asked to become Coffee Masters. During this training they learn coffee history, growing cycles/regions, how we work with farmers, pairings/tastings, etc. &amp; are overflowing w/ coffee knowledge. 💚
@MxrcoDelRey Starbucks plans to eliminate single-use plastic straws globally by 2020. More info is available at https://t.co/TT9xha8eGo.
@andreea13__ Stars and sips? Can this day get any better?
@spoon_masta Were you on Cloud 9?
@ASHERSTODAYO Good news we bring!!! Our Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay! If the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato is more your style, drink up as it's only here for a limited time.
@chelsey81111130 Ahhh Chelsey, it's not. Just the United States and Canada at this time.
@abeljv16 Nope, start sipping and enjoy the unique coffee experience! After a few minutes the foam will start incorporating into the espresso but we think it's better if you sip it right away.
@amourjala__ Which drink did you pair with it?
@kathryn_tippett Have you tried the Lemon Cake Pops yet?
@nialls_flickers No, sorry, this is available in the US and Canada.
@bremvrtinez We normally don't want our friends to cry but tears of joy are okay! 💚
@SAGERLOVESIT US and Canada. Time for a vacation? 😉
@EMonte013 Try it with coconutmilk or soymilk. Delish!!!
@Jgeedy2015 Well since you said please. We're rolling out Starbucks Delivers to select stores in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco and Washington DC. Perhaps Louisiana will be next!
@_salaskarla Did you try the Lemon Cake Pop with it?
@BrandonQ__ If you want a grande, we'll serve a grande, but we're also prepared to serve one up in other sizes as well.
@JenaT_96 Our Toasted White Chocolate Mocha is a holiday sip and post holidays it vanishes, but we do have white chocolate mocha sauce. Order a Caffe Mocha and substitute the mocha sauce for white chocolate mocha sauce and voila! 💚
@NeedsRandomness Glad you're enjoying the Cloud Macchiato and our new strawless lids. Just request the lid and your barista would be happy to give you one for all of your Iced beverages!
@SometimesBritt @sweetenerlaura Your May forecast is cloudy with a chance of deliciousness. While the Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato will only be available for a limited time, the Caramel Cloud Macchiato is here to stay!
@thankugrande2 They are available at participating stores in the US and Canada.
@TabyasJones Here's to delicious firsts! See you soon. ☁💚☁
@MRfreeze_95 An awesome pic of this delicious sip!
@Monica_Pete300 Doesn't it taste like Spring?

@JakeKaplanNY @ArianaGrande Afternoon sips are always better on a cloud!
@sweetener_moon Not at this time. It is available at participating stores in the US and Canada.
@KristinaTuba Awesome!
@yikesnoa We can't wait to see you floating on cloud 9! ☁☕☁💚
@___emillyy___ It is. After a few minutes, the cloud foam layer begins to lose its fluff and incorporates into the espresso. We do recommend this one is drank right away, and if it cannot be, an Iced Caramel Macchiato is a better way to go.
@tannerlevitt_ Tanner, the Cloud Foam serves as the milk and after a few minutes, the foam layer becomes more incorporated into your beverage. Your barista would be happy to make you another drink if you're ever unhappy with your beverage.
@NataliieAlvarez No ~sweeetener~ needed here (except maybe playing in the background)! 😉 https://t.co/CV40nUl7Ph
@cindy_baleska We apologize if you didn't like our new Cloud Macchiato. As the drink sits, the foam incorporates into the beverage so it's important that it is drank right away. If this doesn't float your boat, our Caramel Macchiato may be a better choice.
@elizajoelyn Our Cloud Macchiato is unique. The fluffy, cloud-like foam is the base of the beverage and allows you to experience milk in a whole new way. After a few minutes, the cloud foam layer will begin to lose its fluff and incorporate into the espresso. We reco drinking it right away.
@niallskissys Ummmm, ʸᵘʰ https://t.co/QV8xSa9CVf
@iamvinnyb @ArianaGrande Did it stand out amongst the clouds?

@TaliaSalyer Your Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato awaits!
@okayjaya Whoever said a macchiato can't solve your problems	Must not have had enough Cloud Macchiato to solve 'em	They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want both of 'em"	Happiness is the same taste as a Caramel or Cinnamon Cloud Macchiato.

@ktsmithxox See you soon. 😊 https://t.co/TfDxV9DqLM
@smilesnasa Meant. To. Be.
Introducing new Iced Cloud Macchiatos in Caramel and Cinnamon. So light and fluffy they’re basically a cloud in a cup. 🌬☁️#CloudMacchiato		*Cloud foam contains egg whites https://t.co/TyiAGKgGQO
@thatmakeupxo If you enjoy the strawberry flavor and you'd like to try a cold drink, we recommend the Strawberry Acai Starbucks Refreshers or the #PinkDrink!
@elizabethgrace_ The Pink Drink is an awesome blend of strawberry, acai, and coconutmilk with notes of passion fruit. If it isn't the right flavor for you, your barista would be happy to make you a drink you'd enjoy!
@_AmariKayy Did you stop by for a well-deserved sip?
@_youngpizza No worries, we can still be friends! 😉
@guccixvans If you enjoy the awesome flavors of Strawberry, Acai, and Passion fruit blended with coconutmilk, you will love the Pink Drink! Stop by to try it and let us know what you think.
@yo74224051 Which snack do you enjoy with your Green Tea Latte?
@zailyvega Just admiring the clouds. 😉
@missnarles Yes, please! Throw in an Iced Coffee to make your morning complete.

@treasuredbutera @ArianaGrande Hi, Meg. This is not a valid Starbucks offer, and this screenshot is fake. To confirm any Starbucks promotion, you can check your Starbucks app, reach out to our customer care line, or ask your Starbucks barista.
@NaturllyQueen Stars recognize stars! 😉🌟
@SuperWeenieHtJr Jumped over the moon one too many times. 🌜
@blue_skiesss Queen Elizabeth? It was meant to brew!
@zuny_nicolepink We can't wait for you to espresso how your taste buds feel!

@AtmaneAftisse We serve both decaf brewed coffee and espresso. Cheers!
@FifiDoYouLoveMe You're good, cirrusly!
@McCarthyMayya For next time - our Store Locator will keep you from going round and round: https://t.co/acDQgAO8I5
@KhanyeKarabo 🎶 You can't imagine what I'm 'bout to say (It's a surprise, surprise) 🎶
@river_rot Sure is but it's in the details. Little tip, make sure that the offer or game doesn't say handcrafted espresso beverage.
@_meggymackay Impossible! 😉
@sofia_hrdzz Sunshine has to be in your near future!
@keniaavb Oh no! We're going to send you over to @starbuckshelp so we can work with you to identify the location and get this fixed immediately. Hold tight!

@StCloudState #CloudPROUD 👏👏👏
@AxgelMixer Looks so delicious!
@NavaRoseD Cirrusly, the best stratus-gy!
@camillerika Hmm...🤔
@keniaavb This happens from time to time due to the way Iced Coffee is crafted. Our Iced Coffee is brewed ahead of time and then chilled whereas our Iced Americano and other handcrafted iced espresso beverages are made and then chilled with ice. We're sorry for any inconvenience.
@jessie_mariee7 Pleased to meet you! 🤗
@xokelleyy What's your current go-to? One, two, three - GO!
@TheMarcoIslas Absolutely! As long as the bag is unopened we're happy to grind!

@OrlandoAngeles1 Congrats! 🎉💳
@veliagoodface You asked, we’re delivering! 😉
@wburghard22 You did it! Enjoy all those extra stars. ⭐
@Kattgirl2 If one drinks iced coffee in 10 degree weather, why not drinking hot latte in 98 degree weather, right?
@IridescenceSd Woohoo! Let's celebrate. 🎉
@catsnanchors When you use your registered Starbucks Card or Mobile app to purchase a beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card or Mobile app, you can get free refills on coffee and tea during the same store visit regardless of the original beverage at participating Starbucks stores.

@seancerules Sorry for any confusion, but this is not a valid Starbucks offer. This post is completely false.

@_judi_g Awesome! You made ours, too!
@shapperoni Sous Vide is a French technique that leaves your bite velvety and bursting with flavor! Which Sous Vide Egg Bite made you smile?
@hwaller68 These drinks are seasonal! The peppermint syrup is available year-round so you can order a Mocha and customize it by adding the syrup, it just won't have the dark chocolate curls topping! You can also customize a Hot Chocolate by adding caramel sauce and toffee nut syrup to it!
@PBunches Real friends care about your taste buds!
@ssilkbat That sounds familiar! 😉

@MaggieWessell Enjoy your drink, Maggie! Happy Birthday! 🎉
@Susan_C1964 Have a great road trip, Susan! Thanks for stopping by!
@michaelchliou Hey, Michael! It was a seasonal drink and stores most likely ran out of ingredients. If you enjoyed that flavor, try a Vanilla Latte with cinnamon steamed in the milk. We think you'll love it.

@jinchiRkive Some people just need to discover the joy of a Peppermint Mocha Frappuccino.
@jasminchaudhry Oh no! The Cinnamon Shortbread Frappuccino was only available while supplies lasted. We hope you'll give a Vanilla Frappuccino with Cinnamon Dolce Syrup a chance to make you smile.
*Drinks iced coffee in 10 degree weather*
@micekirby While matcha does have numerous benefits, the most important one is the happiness you derive from your Matcha Green Tea Crème Frappuccino.
@xixididthat It sounds like you have an incredible coworker that really saved the day!
@mikyway They don't. Stores on campuses are licensed stores that are owned and operated by the school. As such, they get to choose the extent that they participate in our loyalty program. Happy Birthday, though! May this be the best year! 🎈
@PilarLouise Everyone deserves a happy Thursday! 🙂
@armyharang 💚
@ReebeccaRuth Our LTOs come and go, such as the ones shown above. They are still reflected in your app as they are supply based and while the store on 1st street may be out of the LTO, the store on 10th street may still have the LTO ingredients in stock. We apologize for any frustration.
@leisakimone It takes so little to cause a ripple of kindness that carries throughout the day. Thank you for keeping it going.
@Cariiinnnaaaa We have made the switch from syrups to infusion blends to add the special flavors to our teas, in doing so, the mango syrup was discontinued. You may find a new fave in our Shaken Peach Citrus White Tea Infusion or our Shaken Pineapple Black Tea Infusion.
@koidebear Question of the day! Our Creme based frappuccino beverages do not contain any espresso or caffeine.
@armyharang Your barista loves to see you smile! 🙂
@ToyaNecole The seeds of kindness have been planted! We love to see joy blossom.
@MsShannonBaby You're welcome!
@kelbellx0 Never pass up an opportunity to spend quality time with quality people! We hope you enjoyed your visit.
@bellegenerico_ Tales of the life changing properties of the Doubleshot on Ice have spread far and wide. It sounds like it's got you under its spell!
@Ips_cali Your minty sipping joy doesn't need to depend on the season. Go ahead and enjoy that Peppermint Mocha all year long if it makes your heart happy!
@jessfairr If this is something you would like to see, we encourage you to submit your suggestion at https://t.co/FHAea75lZx
@Lauren_Marie We hear you and appreciate your feedback. We’re constantly evolving our program, so we welcome you to share your thoughts on https://t.co/SPH9PuUUvR.
@bethanyrruiz Count us in! We can't wait to see you.
@adalylanderos That's a totally relatable craving. We hope you'll satisfy it soon!
@MsShannonBaby It's is! You can enjoy every black and white sip all year long. You can order it as a customized Mocha. Just swap half the sauce pumps of dark mocha sauce for white chocolate mocha sauce, and choose mocha drizzle as a topping. 😋
@cheryl_alyson You know who's calling the shots. 😉
@DeaneLauraC Love at first sip! 🥰
@hitemwithaBRITT It pays to try new things! We're glad your adventurous spirit rewarded you deliciously.
@k8eebug You're welcome, partner. 💚
@MsShannonBaby Black and White Mocha to the rescue! Hot or iced, it's a delicious combination of white and chocolate flavors and we're thrilled that you love it. Thanks for starting your day with us.
@genaviiemorales We can't wait to see you!
@karebearfuentes Thanks for the suggestion! Anything is possible if you submit it to https://t.co/SPH9PuUUvR
@thatkid_laur Heck ya! Pro-status! MVP! Savior!
@ksauced0 Ease into something new by starting with a Black and White Mocha! Just swap half the sauce pumps of white chocolate mocha sauce for dark mocha sauce, and choose mocha drizzle as a topping. 😋
@dayzjne Oh my goodness, have you tried our Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew? It's the happy medium for you!
@k8eebug We're proud of how far your skills have progressed. That Flat White is the bomb DOT com!
@RebekahBremer We get it. Good news though, it's back up and functioning as it should.
@madseatstho It totally was though! We're happy to report that the ex-boyfriend status has been removed and replaced with BFF status and it is now functioning properly.
@sallmiitta We're so sorry for this! Starbucks stores that are on campuses are owned by the university or college. Due to this, they determine if they'll participate in our loyalty program or not, in this case it appears that they are not. 😞
@allysonmharris We're counting down with you! It's almost here, we can feel it!
@aja_dreamer23 There you go making us cry! May your paths cross again soon.
@dayzjne What's your current fave?
RT @Kevin_Johnson: After 23 years in Japan, I couldn’t be prouder of the innovation and passion our partners have brought to life at the To…

@thrillafrommnla We hear you, Christabelle. If you'd like a straw, don't hesitate to ask as we're happy to provide one. Also, if you have a favorite cup that you want us to make your drink in, that's an option also. 💚
@koeppelk So awesome of you! Shoot us a DM and we'll be sure it gets back to the store!
@may__nn What about getting a jumpstart on spring with an Iced Vanilla Bean Coconutmilk Latte with 2-3 pumps of raspberry syrup? Slightly tropical and a bit fruity? 😎
@Desi_1521 Excellent choice, Desirae! 💚
@KCSLiM Our app had major issues this morning that have now been resolved. We're so sorry but if you give it a try now, everything should be back to working order.
@IamJustErii That sounds incredibly delicious! 😋

@SierraStarx3 This makes us sad, but we understand. We're happy to report that our app is functioning as it should if you can find some time to sneak away and see us. Cheers!
@lolorene_ No one likes a decaffeinated morning. We're so sorry, but we're happy to report that it's fixed should you be able to sneak out and see us.
@Akotero Our app totally fell apart this morning and we're sorry that you had to live through this nightmare! We're proud to report that it's back up and functioning as it should. 💚

@samsyl8 Happy Birthday, Sam! Thoughts on coming by and seeing us tomorrow instead?

@liveventi Hold tight, our app has a mind of its own this morning. We're working on getting it fixed now. Sorry!
@sami_zirkle OMG is right. We're sorry, but we're getting it fixed!
@communiquelvin Not a great start to the morning, right? We're working on getting it fixed so that all can resume as normal tomorrow morning, or this afternoon, should you need a midday pick-me-up.
@abbieboo The why isn't important, but the fact that we're working on getting it fixed is. We are so very sorry, we know it's terribly inconvenient.
@CamilleFauchet Our app is having major issues this morning and we're so sorry! We're actively working on a fix.

@moonnniicaaav Sounds like a perfect bonding day! Thanks for including us. 💚
@LaurenDuski You're welcome!
@hurley_cheyenne Have you tried our Coconutmilk Mocha Macchiato? Sumatran coconutmilk, white chocolate mocha, and Espresso roast combine with caramel drizzle and a swirl of mocha to create five perfectly-balanced layers of espresso sweetness in every sip. 😋
@hope_monaco Our partners are what make Starbucks special. 💚
@demiixvato_ We know it's not the same, but did he get a hot chocolate? 😄
@KyleTheBell Maybe you better cool off and make your next order an Iced Caramel Macchiato.
@samuelsfta That's great! Thanks for sharing your suggestion.
@KyleTheBell There's something about the way she stares into your soul while you're drinking your Caramel Macchiato.
@m_delbs He's the real MVP! 🏆
@marysalake Thanks for keeping the kindness going! 💚
@TootisinSTL4sho Oh no! We're sorry you missed it. It never hurts to ask your barista. If they still have the supplies on hand they'd be happy to make one for you.
@urfaveSAG Glad you like it!
@KyleTheBell You're the one dreaming about us. 😂
@CCSUDining It's the classic February warm-up! 😋
@boohoo_xo It was the sleeper hit of the season. We hope you enjoyed every sip!
@Steph_L_Spratt You've got this. We'll be there for you while you unlock you next adulting achievement.
@xox_viviana You're at the right place! Do you prefer espresso-based sips or more of the berry/fruity flavors?
@SMASHXRR Then this sounds like a pretty sweet deal! 😁
@makaylarmw We're sensing that a match may be made with our Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew: https://t.co/3jXBwe76Vk
@Kahopena Try an Iced Caramel Macchiato or Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew!

@mkhitchner42 It's delicious as a Frappuccino too!
@kyzcnowzdasiram Took you long enough! 😂
@MyLadyNeonJuan Correct, it doesn't apply to our Princi locations. You'll just come have to visit us (good ole' regular Starbucks store) for refill after refill. We'll make it up to you.
@AngieAve262 It's raining stars!
@inniep3ni5 Jealous! 💚
@ToniMarieTweets Iced Latte, Mocha or Macchiato beverages should be your go to. Any of them, so you've got lots to choose from! Happy Hopping!
@omgbev And so perfect with our dark roast coffee! ☕️
@shannalo We've got an answer for ya! The medium roast Sumatra is from the Winter Coffee Passport Series, but our dark roast Sumatra isn't going anywhere. Whew!

@nicved Lucky for us! We hope you'll take a stroll up the hill and come see us again soon.
@RadicalRobin_ Delish recommendation! 😋
@grvmos4 Your barista is always happy to accommodate a request for light or no nice ice when you place your order. If you are ever unhappy with your drink please let your barista know so they can make it right.
@RaechelRaeee Iced Vanilla Latte to the rescue!
@sjwb11 She found them, she found them! 🙌
@domlashon She'd like one of everything! 😉 We're going to create something new and special for you. How about a Latte Macchiato with 2 pumps of vanilla and 2 pumps of raspberry syrup?

@ponyboyconnor Nope. No objections.
@_serenahodge Happy to oblige. 😉  Enjoy every bite!
@megantrautman Honestly, we believe that it really depends on the drink. Some go really well with nutty almondmilk, while other flavors are amplified by tropical coconutmilk. If you'd like to share a go-to or three, we'll help you match them appropriately. Cheers!
@gabangelinaxo Dear Tired New Yorker, we do we do! Simply download the Uber Eats app and search “Starbucks” to see if it’s available near you!
@unpredictacal Schools are licensed stores, meaning that they are owned and operated by your school and determine if they'll participate in our Loyalty Program with includes our discount on reusable cups or not. It sounds like they've decided to not participate. So sorry!

@betsyyy_x Stores within airports are licensed stores and are owned and operated by the airport. This allows them the freedom to choose whether they'll accept our giftcards or participate in our loyalty program. It sounds like one of their policies is to not support giftcards. So sorry. 😔
@Cameron53671994 Awesome! We hope to see you back again soon.
@Soniaaniah We sure do! All of our latte, macchiato and frappuccino beverages can be made with decaf espresso. Now you just have to choose one!
@lillie_lewis15 A little kindness can go a long way!

@marisarenteriaa Pretty in pink your thing? All signs are pointing towards you finding a fave in one of our Starbucks Refreshers: https://t.co/mPrApooQaj
@danny_ruiz Iced Coffee and an Iced Americano (espresso) are two totally different things, likely hence the confusion. Definitely give the Iced Americano a try and have some fun with by adding in a few pumps of syrup or some milk. Cheers!
@ARINdul_mill Did that Caramel Frappuccino happen?
@_LovelyLou That's so sweet! Have an amazing day, Maya!

@ourGodwhoguides Sorry about that! The slow steep time limits the amount we can make daily, so it’s only available while supplies last. We’d recommend getting to your store extra early!
@IvyAlexuss Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew sounds like a good match for you! Just before serving, our smooth, slow-steeped custom blend Starbucks Cold Brew Coffee is topped with a delicate float of house-made vanilla sweet cream that cascades throughout the cup.
@putabibonme It's our crisp, Strawberry Acai Refreshers Beverage, with its accents of passion fruit, combined with creamy Coconutmilk. It’s a fruity and refreshing sip of spring, no matter what time of year.
@kkromorr Cold Foam Cascara Nitro! Our velvety-smooth Nitro Cold Brew served cold, straight from the tap, is capped with Cascara flavored Cold Foam for subtle notes of dark brown sugar. Our most craveable cup of Nitro Cold Brew yet.

@skosted Hi, Steve! In the United States, Starbucks Nespresso capsules will be available in grocery stores and major online platforms. More details here: https://t.co/ggo1hHpkgZ.
@danny_ruiz We do. Our Iced Coffee is actually brewed in batches and then chilled in the refrigerator which takes hours. Thoughts on an Iced Decaf Americano which is brewed and then instantly chilled by ice?
@TowneMeadows Hope we helped math make "cents" for the kids! 😄
@MeganRae_ OOOOoooooo! Don't forget to invite us to the wedding!
@acebxx Love truth #1. 💘

@vergilbot_en Follow the link, it'll help: https://t.co/acDQgAO8I5
@hocosuit We don't have any caramel roasted brewed coffee, but an option would be to order a brewed coffee and then you can take it from there. As Ashley mentioned, you can always add 2-3 pumps of caramel syrup to give yourself some caramel goodness. 💚

@mkfphotos Noted! Tell us more at https://t.co/FHAea75lZx and we might consider bringing it back year round.
@Xenberg Wishes sometimes come true when submitted at https://t.co/FHAea75lZx!
@JordanKubz Hey, Jordan. As an option, you can find the Bottled S'mores Frappuccino drink at select locations!
@meganbrandt26 It's a beautiful day, indeed, Megan! Thanks for keeping the kindness going!
@mariebee17 Hey, Heather. You can let us know here if you want to see it on the menu: https://t.co/EFFd3FUwu4
@klrussell222 Enjoy your drink! Happy Birthday, Karen!
@JChrist3831 Please stay tuned for the next Happy Hour offer, Jordan! 💚
@DeAnndra_Renee So glad you were able to enjoy one! Thanks for stopping by!
@KAY_WHYJAY Awesome! It's always fun trying different drinks and finding new flavors you enjoy! 😊
@Cindy_Luv_ Sounds good! 😉
@City_CountryGal Happy Birthday, Nikki! 🎉
@EmilyroseRob No, sorry. We're glad you got to enjoy the Cherry Mocha! 💚
@captainssoldier If you like cinnamon, you'll enjoy it! It's available for a limited time, we hope to see you soon!
@MoniqueTweets45 And that's how you make your taste buds happy!
@chaitealatt It's the perfect work day companion!
@wildfl0wer_X Every cloud has a silver lining even if you're stuck on the ground!
@llcoolmom Here's to sweet surprises. 💚
@cawhite15 Our baristas are always happy to review your options with you to help find a beverage you'll love. We're glad you enjoyed every sip!
@UnicornDolls Our Coconutmilk Mocha Macchiato is delightful. Sumatran coconutmilk, white chocolate mocha, and Espresso roast combined with caramel drizzle and a swirl of mocha to create five perfectly-balanced layers of espresso sweetness in every sip. 😋
@sloane_harris Always a pleasure. See you tomorrow!
@_PerfctPrincess You may enjoy a Caramel Macchiato made with Blonde Espresso!
@crissstti This sounds like a job for Hot Chocolate! Steamed milk with vanilla and mocha-flavored syrups topped with sweetened whipped cream and chocolate-flavored drizzle is sure to warm you from inside out!
@cupofrita The best way to know where it's happening is to be the first to pay it forward and get the kindness flowing. 💚
@klintlandry We hope you're feeling 150% better soon.
@kellyblueberry_ Citrus Defender to the rescue!
@BRayAnnMeier Power through that day! We got you. 💚
@aleahamk Yes! To qualify for the Birthday Reward, you must join Starbucks Rewards at least 7 days before your birthday &amp; have made at least one purchase in a store using your registered Starbucks Card. We look forward to celebrating you on your special day. https://t.co/ja8W7A9v5x
@MattEvansNY Someone has a delicious Friday ahead of them. 😉
@What_the_Grahek Happy birthday! Thank you for including us in your day.
@Javier8129 Do we ever! We've got all your hot chocolate needs covered. Classic, White Hot Chocolate, Black and White Hot Chocolate, even Peppermint! We hope you'll be enjoying some soon.
@Elissa_Celeste The stars aligned for you today! ⭐💚
@heather_boo95 We’re taking a Happy Hour break this week, but we’ll be celebrating again on March 14th.
@SincerelyBushra It's possible as the disappointment has been obvious since its farewell from our menu.
@indi_esq_mba Thank you millions! We're looking into both situations!
@JustMcGregor That's a grand idea. Hold tight. 💚
@darcookiethom4l If only!
@vanxvaldon 🤗
@JustMcGregor First an apology, the intention was not to sound that way at all, we seriously just want to be where you are! For an Iced Americano go to Cold Coffee &amp; then to Iced Caffe Americano. Scroll down a bit and under Espresso &amp; Shot Options select Decaf and then finalize your order. 😊
@Supershowna_ We're still here! Happy almost end of week!
@dianafentyyy Hide the cookies, Diana is coming! 😉
@maggie50160 Well, we never claimed to read minds. Thanks for stopping in! 🤣
@JustMcGregor Wow, it is impressive that there are so many near you brewing decaf Iced Coffee! You're super lucky as it's very, very rare! Because it is so rare, this option is not built into our app.
@AyyNeciahh Nothing wrong with a girl that knows what she wants! 🙌
@vicevicee You need us now, more than ever! 😂
@_ilianaguevara Reserve Coffees are such an experience! You don't know what you're missing until you have that very first sip. 💚
@SDesai71 Sure can! Do you prefer simple espresso with the flavors or are you okay with some creaminess?
@maggie50160 Indecisive = endless possibilities! Is it ever too cold for a Frappuccino? https://t.co/crBaZyx5QL
@tiffnicolexx Will you still love us if we told you that it's not returning this year? 😔
@DogCaptainRay Wild guess, but a Salted Cream Cold Foam Cold Brew feels totally you.
@morton_brianna Good, always good. Consider it energy conservation.
@jar_duff Hmmm, tea shouldn't even be seen. In your app go 'hot coffee' and then scroll down to 'brewed coffee' then scroll all the way to the right. You should see decaf there.
@ughclarrree Anything with caramel leads to super sipable moments too! https://t.co/25qwRas4E2
@carlycakez_08 All hail the queen!
@kenzxg Your Thursday needs a do-over! 🤣
@jar_duff It's not possible as it uses the daily roast for the day, but there is a workaround! Simply place an order for decaf brewed tea and under the milk option add foam, 2% milk and steamed and you should be set. Cheers!
@DarlenewWebster Oh we wanted to, but fitting everything that is so loved lead us to many mission impossible moments.
@FatMermaid_ You ask, we answer! A roasty and creamy Latte Macchiato is the way to go: https://t.co/q7NRHOQqy9
@annursyi19 We’re celebrating Happy Hour all year, but some months will have more deals than others. Our next Happy Hour is Thursday, March 14th.
@AleciaSt Happy Hour will be back on Thursday, March 14th. We hope to see you there!
@MycahRose Ahhh, our precious little Mycah is all grown up! 😉
@cjager95 Sounds fishy. Here's hoping the rest of your week goes swimmingly.
@aggiechirodc Our at-home tea lineup varies considerably from store-to-store, but we're hopeful that you may stumble across it at your local grocery store that carries Starbucks at-home coffee.
@Adelrick76 5 ⭐ happiness in every sip!
@Corey_D2019 It's the cherry on top of your Thursday! 🍒
@erma_striker Since it's in a cup, you can take your hug with you wherever you go!
@jasonlovefiles Time management Pro Tip of the day! Streamline your day with Mobile Order and Pay! https://t.co/0hlOhsuJyr
@harley_atchison Everyone needs a little morning motivation once in a while. Enjoy your delicious reward!
@KCaroline7 We’re taking a Happy Hour break this week, but we’ll be celebrating again Thursday, March 14th!
@LaJaySmith Another seriously tastebud worthy option might be our Serious Strawberry Frappuccino: https://t.co/0JwzEAl2bW
@SincerelyBushra Seasonal foods come and go and our Honey Pistachio Croissant was on that list. Can we help you find a second fave?
@KarliAlissa If only could work our magic here! Stores on campuses are Licensed Stores, owned and operated by the University they are within. We encourage you to have a heart-to-heart with the manager and see if they are open to considering the possibilities. 💚
@TVShowbiz Currency exchange conversion makes this difficult on a global scale. Sorry. 😔
@shygirlgoes Enjoy! 💚
@w_scott_brown At this time, Starbucks Delivers is only available in select cities. If you’d like to see Starbucks Delivers in your city, let us know at https://t.co/SPH9PuUUvR.

@shygirlgoes Oh no! When it’s no longer available, give a Vanilla Latte with raspberry sauce a try. It's delicious!
@caitlinrose92 For the unconventionally awesome you, how about a Grande Sweet Cream Cold Brew, extra cream with caramel walls. Happy almost you day! 🎈
@ErinVarilone That's awesome, Erin! Thanks for your feedback, we're happy you enjoyed it!
@ItsMeDMarie Patience, dear one, patience! 😉
@JustMcGregor We're here to help but you may not like our answer. Due to the brewing process our Iced Coffee it isn't available with a decaf option. Have you tried an Iced Americano? It's available decaf and you can find it in the app.
@fiddycent84 No, not today! Please stay tuned for the next Happy Hour offer!
@jazzy_ayala 🙌🙌
@jordangaydos_ Sometimes a nice cup of tea is all you need!
@itss_jenz Sounds good! Let us know what you think of it, Jen!
@MissPiggy That drink sounds wonderful, sweet, and sure to get everyone's attention - just like vous! 💖
@mrsjenarteaga Wonderful! Cheers!

@mrsjenarteaga Hey, Jennifer. We're happy you enjoyed the drink but it's only available while supplies last! As an option, we think you might also like a Vanilla Latte with Raspberry sauce!
@YvetteGabriela Awesome! Happy Birthday, Yvette!
@Coletini The cherry flavor pairs beautifully with espresso!
@ook1d They're perfect together! 🙌
@meganresena Phew! Sounds like it all worked out and you got to enjoy your drink. Happy Birthday, Megan!
@KaronJ64 It's delicious! Pink Drink is our crisp Strawberry Acai Refreshers Beverage combined with creamy https://t.co/zeJT7pImb2 can learn more about it here: https://t.co/2zITAwTUxI

@darcookiethom4l You won! 🤣
@ichigosnorlax Oh dear, we're going to break your heart! Be sure to sip it while you can, it's only in stores while supplies last.
@imlandonanne Chai Latte is always there for you. 💚
@jhobi06 It's a hard one to beat, but if you're looking for the caramel flavor, think about doing an Iced Almondmilk Caramel Latte. Have your Barista sub the vanilla syrup for caramel syrup and 2% milk for almondmilk. Cheers!
@healthcoach_mon 😇
@hallowinehoe Thanks for spreading kindness, Chelsea! 💚
@rich_yauger We wish we could say yes, but we can't as it's not returning this year. We're so very sorry. 😔
@BossSlayyy Yeah, thanks Gene! 🤗
@TrizzeTrell The people have spoken and we have a unanimous yes! 🙌

@Kat3Marie Yes! To qualify for the Birthday Reward, you must join Starbucks Rewards at least seven (7) days before your birthday and have made at least one purchase in a store using your registered Starbucks Card. We can't wait to celebrate you on your special day.

@RutledgeMj It's the end result that matters, not how you got there. 🤣
@sierrabearuh Yum on yum on yum!
@BRO_imAshley Merchandise is not redeemable with a Reward, but you can get creative and make yourself a super fancy drink. Sorry!
@Supershowna_ Not possible! 💚💚
@kimnntran Working on it! We're currently rolling out Starbucks Delivers to select stores in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco and Washington DC - perhaps you're location will be next!

@Cole_816 Nothing like a good cup of tea!
@shavonediehard Everything! Only kidding! What flavors do you lean towards: chocolate, caramel, berry, spicy, vanilla?

@iamapottymouth Awesome!
@freesfm Sorry to hear that it wasn't the right flavor for you. If you'd like to see the Cherry Mocha on the menu, please share this at https://t.co/FHAea75lZx for future consideration.
@Kimmyb02 It's happiness in every delicious sip! 💚
@katiemonso It's never too late! We're happy you enjoyed it! 😉
@luceroxsanchez How about a Pineapple Black Tea Infusion Lemonade? Tropical pineapple flavors from our fruit and botanical blends are combined with premium Teavana Black Tea, lemonade, then slightly sweetened with liquid cane sugar for a refreshing drink that's just subtly sweet.
@BriannaBradley0 It's what it feels like to be welcomed. 💚
@cheyennehart13 Congrats! The rewards are delicious!

@brittneyp_xo So many choices shared already! We're happy to help you find YOUR perfect sip if you want to share favorite flavor (vanilla, chocolate, spicy, berry, caramel) and whether you like a sweeter or more bold sip. Cheers!
@dhbsa_ We would if we could, but this isn't possible. Here's to things turning around for you!
@Nicole_Kmiotek We're crying with you! Little insider knowledge, we're expecting it to be released again early November. 💚
@travelerbetween But we do! Follow the link and filter for 24-hours to see if you have one near you: https://t.co/acDQgAO8I5
@Nicole_Kmiotek Such a hard one to miss! We've changed the release date for our Casi Cielo so that it is roasted closer to its peak harvest resulting in a fresher, more flavorful coffee. As a result, Casi Cielo was available fall of 2018 and we expect it to return again in fall of 2019.
@ZacharyEarl We're still focused on this issue and our commitment remains to have strawless lids and sustainable straws in all stores globally by 2020. We apologize if you're not noticing any changes in your area yet, but rest assured, they are coming!
@ceekayymm_ We hope you'll get to enjoy one soon!

@YUNGGCHEEZE Especially when it's paired with a Cinnamon Shortbread Latte!
@cassie0010 Does that mean we have a standing lunch date?
@lizbcroft We think so too!

@bby373 It's obvious that you deserve one! 😉
@tiffanie_minder We can help! Which Frappuccino is your favorite?
@DravensAshes It may not be on the menu but it can be in your cup! Just order a Caffe Mocha and ask your barista for equal parts Mocha Sauce and White Mocha Sauce.

@_MandathePanda Give a try to our Honey Citrus Mint Tea also, it's a winter favorite! https://t.co/WADq5VPsau
@tvc103 It varies from store to store, Theresa. We encourage you to have a little chat with your favorite barista.
@v1ckyn1cky We hate breaking hearts, but it's not returning this year. We hope you have another tried and true year-round favorite.
@Off_ToPk Few options for you! 	⭐ Skinny Cinnamon Dolce Latte or Skinny Vanilla Latte iced or hot	⭐ Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew	⭐ Strawberry Acai or Mango Dragonfruit Starbucks Refreshers	⭐ Teavana Shaken Iced Green Tea	⭐ Teavana Iced Passion Tango Tea with or without Lemonade
@OlHippyTCF You are awesome for tipping! It sounds like this option may have gotten toggled off in your app. To fix, go to the gear in the top right and down to 'notification preferences', you'll see an option for tipping there. If off, turn it back on and this should fix it. 💚
@TheMayraLara Celebrate!
@VueNashville This is what it's all about! Thanks for sharing!!!
@cameandsaw Oh but we are! We're rolling out Starbucks Delivers to select stores in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, San Francisco and Washington DC. 🚗

@kunhearts But of course!
@BChandlerCook It's not recommended. We recommend that you try a Vanilla Bean Crème Frappuccino, affogato-style. The espresso blends deliciously through the drink giving you sips of sweetness followed by more espresso-forward sips.
@blametaryn We know what you love!
@JazminTeQuiere Awesome!
