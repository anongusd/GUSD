@kennenga @IBMcloud @googlecloud Mostly the network (I can get a L4 anycast IP with native K8s integration) and the modern, totally intuitive control plane API. IBM Cloud's network and control plane are just plain old. Mergers happen but it's like getting in a time machine compared to newer clouds.
@IBMcloud Thanks... I am still using some object storage accounts since those are harder to migrate, but the biggest frustration with Softlayer-cum-IBM Cloud right now is the lack of comparable features and, frankly, a horrendous network downtime record this year.
After over 10 years of being a @IBMcloud (well, The Planet, then Softlayer, then Bluemix, then IBM Cloud) customer, I'm out. Things have changed so much in that time and their aging network and offering just can't hang. Hello, @googlecloud. Also LOL, IBM portal down as we speak.

Important FYI for those of us running Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) - the $29 upgrade will work just fine http://bit.ly/D11AV
The cannibalism begins: Romanoff to challenge Bennet, per Denver Post: http://www.denverpost.com/ci_13226643
Why, Rockies, why?
Iowa high school football on ESPN - must be a slow night for sports!
Tune in to 1310 KFKA at 8:35 this morning where I'll be visiting with host George Gray about the recent vandalism at the state Dem HQ.
So tired - but back to it Friday morning at 8 am with KCOL - listen online at 600kcol.com.
@cyreynolds I credit CU for chilling me out - I think I'm still very type A but boy, was I wound up in high school!  Embrace if you wish...!
Finishing season 1 of HBO's "Tell Me You Love Me" - I know the critics hated it but I'm digging this series.
Go rockies!  Glad I finally got my HD hooked up to follow the pennant race.
SportsCenter spending a lot of time on Rockies/Dodgers this morning - exciting stuff!
I'll be on @KBDI_12_PBS Wednesday night at 8 pm to discuss the 1 year anniversary of the DNC in Denver.  Tune in!
Talk about being bought off - why is PhRMA running pro Udall and Bennet ads?  Oh, right, they pow-wowed with Obama.
@SenatorBrophy You should trade notes with Ron Tupa - he teaches Poli Sci in Boulder...
Is the Fox show "More to Love" exploitative of bigger people, or a genuine effort at good TV?  I think, the former.
On the ambulance in Commerce City...so far so good (quiet)!
On a related note, why don't credit card issuers move toward chip-and-pin in the US?  It's ubiquitous in Europe.
Another reason I love American Express - new card by UPS overnight, fraud case is opened and I'm on with my life.
Somebody skimmed my credit card!
Oh! And dc traffic sucks.
Another reason I hate everything out of dc - listening to obama conf call on c-span radio
With everything that's going on, I'm enjoying the radio silence in Grundy.
My flight: screaming kids?  Check.  Guy bouncing his seat in front of me?  Check.  Me so exhausted not to care? Check.
On metrorail - wonder if my driver is asleep at the controls like all the others?
A few hours sleep and I'm on the bus to dia - I miss my clear card.
Just now getting to bed - it's so hard to get out of town!
Gotta love how the F9/WN deal crashed and burned on... you guessed it...union disagreements.
Hey @comcastcares - third day in a row of spotty connectivity on Denver's Cap Hill - techs are aware but progress super slow
FYI Comcast users on Denver's capitol hill- tech says head-end is aware of cable modem power fluctuations - doesn't make it less frustrating
@BobMooreNews - @FaceTheState_co tweeted DeGette's town hall, for instance, but we can't cover them all.  Would you rather no link?
Baseball on the radio and steak on the grill - great evening.
Just left the first PERA "listening tour" event - packed house.
RT @FaceTheState_co: FTS Radio comes to Grand Junction http://bit.ly/exjzQ
Some shameless promotion - follow @ElevationsCU for financial tips from Boulder's best credit union (I volunteer there)
It is POURING... good thing I left my skylights cracked at home... oops.
Another quiet night in Commerce City.  I'm Mr. White Cloud.
Why must constituents who didn't sign up for DeGette forum call her office for the number?  Why not post it on the Web and publicize?
Just received call from "United States Gov't" registered number with DeGette invite - must be taking a while to get up to speed.
I never got an inbound call (as promised after signing up) for the DeGette town hall forum - here's the number: 877-229-8493, ID 14551
Confirmed for @FaceTheState_co weekend radio show - comic Victoria Jackson, a rare conservative in showbusiness.  At Comedy Works this wknd.
Overheard - DFD union member says local will gather for a meeting tonight - Hick wants  to take "every f**cking thing" from them.
DG ambulance turned out to be Chiyo - very small world!  I miss my old partner!  Alley bum on his way to Cares.
Denver Fire in the alley next to our office waking up a sleeping bum with their air horn.  Your taxpayer dollars at work.  Ambo is code 10.
On the road to kcol - its so early!
On the air - 1310KFKA.com and 1310 AM in Northern Colorado - through 9 am.
0445 wake up call - it's gonna be rough!
I love American Express - very worth the fee.  People would be willing to pay a premium for domestic call centers for other products, too...
Telos has the worst upgrade instructions EVER.  But I am smarter than them so all is well.
At the pro-obamacare rally - "when I say labor, you say yes!" is the chant.
@denverpost Wheat Ridge assault linked to 'Live Links' -- who would even pay for a chat line anymore when there's the Internet?
@Ginatypes There's a twitter app on Facebook (it's just called "Twitter") that automatically updates your FB status with your latest tweet.
Drupal conundrum solved - only took two days of head-scratching, one module function edit, and some theming.  Great.
Wow, was I sleep deprived.
Knocking out some work, then off to the Springs for @mpascoe's wedding.
Got a little too obsessive with the coding tonight... time for bed.
God bless clean PHP, HTML, CSS, and Drupal 6 with CCK - secret side project is coming along really well.
Exploring Drupal 6 - too bad many of my favorite modules aren't quite up to speed on that version, yet.
Posting outside dick's to kill time - getting a bit of a free show too
Spotted: Ken Gordon at REI buying way too many days of backpacker's pantry meals
Plan is for a loop at Buffalo Peaks Wilderness SW of Fairplay - last chance if you want to tag along!
Patched my 10-year-old Therm-a-Rest and it's good to go - repair is more fun than buying new.
Anyone up for a quick overnight backpacking trip Sat/Sun?
Just received an invite to Google Voice - way cool!  Just wish I could port the Vonage number I've been using for a "home" phone.
Amex offering 2x points on gas & groceries, but you have to opt-in to the offer.  This was SOP for Membership Rewards until a few years ago.
Great backpacking trip this weekend; might just have to do it again this Saturday!  But first, road biking with Andy and Meg.
@emzanotti Vegas on a budget?  That's no fun!
Incredible!  WMATA says it's not clear driver is sleeping, but it's pretty clear he's not paying attention: http://tinyurl.com/nz74ol
Enough is enough - I need an installation of Adobe Lightroom for Face The State's photo library.  2 years of photos to keep straight!
Is Firefox 3.5 really faster/more stable, or is this placebo effect?
I'll be on @KBDI_12_PBS's Colorado Inside Out Friday at 5pm - tune in!
RT @okmaher Our kickball team is 2 and 0 . . . We're kicking some tush so far!
Why everyone should switch to Firefox, like, yesterday: http://www.denverpost.com/ci_12767655
Great day for FTS in the media - On KOA this morning (http://tinyurl.com/nu2vl3) and Fox 31 last night (http://tinyurl.com/kwjddd)
Back from Black Hawk late - LATE - last night, but only one person can rouse me from my sleep: Mike Rosen, who I'll visit with at 9:30.
@eluning "Drexting" - I love the term.  Another interpretation - drunk texting, a la textsfromlastnight.com
Uh oh: RT @INDT Black Hawk mayor buys paper that investigated politicians http://cli.gs/pdn8d
Go Rockies!  3-0 vs. Dodgers tonight!
@eluning Actually texting ban doesn't go into effect until Dec. 1 - http://tinyurl.com/qbq5vj
Rockies up 2-0 in the 5th... don't blow that lead!
@bendegrow Keep us posted on any juicy developments!
@Rossputin @KateMelvin Until we get instant runoff voting, "big L" libertarians have no chance of winning statewide office.
@Rossputin I'm no fan of the current direction of the GOP, either, but ditching your party registration means losing your voice in primaries
Is this really an episode of The Simpsons I've never seen before?  Complete with Paul Harvey reading a self-help audiobook on sex?  Yes.
Tired of these afternoon thunderstorms... I like the rain, but c'mon!
One down, one radio 2-way to go and I am a hurtin' pup!
Bustop.  Boulder.  Work at 630.  Real great idea.
@fishnette Have 'em give me a call.
Ambulance time.
Lightning strike couldn't have been more than a block away - I felt it coming - hair on my arms stood up, ground shook.  Wow.
I love Vine Street, but their service model can leave you waiting for a beer...and waiting...and waiting...
Cute hippie server at Boulder coffee shop didn't get my joke about taxes when my coffee rang up to $2.04.
Good thing my Clear Card was a gift: "[B]ecause of its financial condition, Verified Identity Pass, Inc. cannot issue refunds."
Clear Pass just announced they've gone under - I'm now the owner of an expensive piece of plastic - and long airport lines.
Mary Mother of God - Rockies up 9-1 against the Angels.  Nice!
Is that a Scientology TV ad I just saw?  Creepy - that faux religion ruins peoples' lives.
Tonight's episode of Intervention is even better than usual given it's about a guy from Denver - this SHOW is addicting.
@scottkjames Hey Scott - no hurry, looking forward to your call when you've got a moment.
Another quality Sunday night in beautiful Commerce City.
Show closer: "burning down the house" - with the band in tutus
At red rocks for devotchka/david byrne.  So cool!
Just finished watching Juno... not really sure what I think of it.
Done with work - beer time.
At the pavilions to see "the hangover" - tune in for review tomorrow at 10am on 1310 kfka.
Why do people put all their crap on empty seats when the train is obviously filling up?  So rude.
Amtrak train to dc running near capacity - who says a private company wouldn't be interested in profitable routes?  Why gov't run?
Having lunch at inner harbor before catching the train - going to kill the lame street performer outside the restaurant tho
Tweets from #ire09 over at @FaceTheState_CO - figured I'd spare y'all from constant cross-posting.
@fishnette I actually found the hashtag is #ire09, so watch for that instead... so far, very helpful, as always!
Can't wait to get to #ire09 panels, but radio and web site updates come first...
Marc train to dc looks nearly full; to camden load factor maybe 10%
Getting the most out of my amtrak tax subsidy... But why isn't my ticket free?
Hit the atm - crisp new 20s.  Obama must have just printed them.
Up at o-dark-thirty to take MARC up to Baltimore for #ire 2009.  Yes, I'll jump on the bandwagon and tweet the conference.
Another reason to hate dc: mosquitos, everywhere.
Waiting for the bus to fly to dc... On to baltimore for ire tomorrow.
Thank you to whomever coded the audio_import module for Drupal.  That is all.  Off to bed.
Not enjoying fighting with apache and php this late in the day.
Back from a 26-ish mile bike ride... just in time for a nasty-looking storm.
Leaving to speak to high schoolers from around CO about @FaceTheState_CO and the state of journalism/new media.
Done, done, done.  Totally warmed over.  Time for a beer and denver's best 80s band.
Watching NBC's Brian Williams go orgasmic spending a day with the President... he's just a former Senator from Illinois...
At work in our new, still funky but much nicer offices!
Sleep, finally.
Commerce City... quiet tonight.  Let's hope it stays that way.  If you're going to get hurt, do it elsewhere!
Yes, I am going to bed at 9 pm... and yes, it's going to be awesome.  Early morning tomorrow moving offices!
Two observations: I may have to actually sign up for hd service if the nuggets keep winning, and the wnba hasn't gone bankrupt yet?  Wha ...
Back to Denver...
Best photo cutline ever: "President Obama enjoys his new Steelers jersey after making children cry." http://tinyurl.com/qa37aw
Excited to see A Prairie Home Companion at Wolf Trap today - shut up, I think it's awesome!
Could have "napped" through noon tomorrow.  How do I get so sleep deprived?
Why do I always book this same super early frontier flight?  Need coffee.
Off to DC for the weekend... @kjmelvin will do a great job filling in on the radio this morning!
Love his job - One day I'm covering city hall and the next I'm calling for "One Life to Live" promotional photos.
Looks horrible in spandex but happy to be back on the bike.
Writing patient care reports... So exciting.
Junk burger at vine street isn't better than sex, but damn close.
Done with work!  This week flew by.
Finally figured out what I was doing wrong with the ISDN codec settings.  Genius.
Not feeling "comcastic".
Very angry with comcast.
Mmmmmm...prime rib tuesday.  Also very optimistic about having a new chef at the club.
Commerce City, baby.
Listening to the savage love podcast - so fun.
Pete's Kitchen. Westword.  I'm tired.
@fishnette You can't be surprised at the quality of writing by college students?  Where have all the standards gone?
I have a huge crush on the girl in the sonic commercials.  Yeah, I know.
Box seats at the nuggets - great game!
PBR and 80's music... I'm easy to please.
The Champions - 80's arena rock - at Herb's in Downtown Denver tonight.  Come by!
Funkiphino at the Foundry... Boulder's still there, if you were wondering.
Just bought tickets for Prairie Home Companion at Wolf Trap... Ohhhh yeah
Not a single call all night... Slept like a baby.
Ambulance time... Good calls, please.
Westwood One looking for a new co-host for Loveline.  I want that job so much!  http://tinyurl.com/cczvrn
The Simpsons in HD?  Oh, yeah.
Glad I turned on the Rockies game.
Racquetball with Steve - maybe he won't kick my ass this time!
Casey vasem ca. 1986 on sirius 80's...classic
Enjoyed listening to the open bluegrass pick at Vine Street tonight
About 35 sticks this morning... Not bad!
Who's down for cool river to watch desperate cougars and see funkiphino play?
Done with work for the week - thank God!
Street sweeping ticket - it's really spring!
Feelin, rough this morning
Scoot scoot

Anyone want to split a hotel room in the mountains tonight and ski tomorrow?

Randy jones sez: "even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while"
Warmed over...time for a nap
Just wrapped up with KCOL, next up KFKA at 8:03 - tune in!
Still at the office cutting this weekend's program...when do I get to go home?
Surrender - I finally gave in to the twitter bug.
