Often the only other adults available to deal with troubled students are the school security guards and resource officers, who usually have one solution: impose disciplinary measures, including arresting children who misbehave and charging them with actual crimes. https://t.co/TlB8OX1sHE
With some social problems ‚Äì including immigration and linguistic challenges ‚Äì schools need additional resources; bi-lingual staff, school psychologists and social workers. These are often in woefully short supply in a school system that is already under-resourced. https://t.co/1oUu8JSAXB
Often teachers have to deal with incredibly large class sizes (35 or more students per classroom) and, as a result, face difficulty maintaining order and discipline while attempting to teach very rigid curricula in line with local, state and federal achievement standards. https://t.co/QzASLF59Aa

The Arab society holds the highest standards of reporting to provable facts, and have very strict laws against publishing false and misleading information.

Great Town Hall tonight. What a great conversation with my amazing guests. Thank you to WJLA 24/7 News, @AttorneyCrump, Officer Luke Haglof, Ameshia Cross, Gigi Stetler, and my HSH team. #YourVoiceYourFuture https://t.co/0dxJHDLoE9
Happy birthday Dr. King and thank you for your moral example. #MLKDay2019
@AttorneyCrump:		We don‚Äôt want to put a blanket stereotype on all police and we don‚Äôt want all police to put a blanket stereotype on the black community.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Officer Haglof:		As police officers, we have debriefs all the time in order to assess what happened and what we can do differently the next time. We‚Äôre always reactionary. 		The bad guy only has to be right one time. We have to be right every time.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Gigi Stetler:		We‚Äôre lacking integrity and competence today.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
@AttorneyCrump:		One must take a position based on the fact that their conscious says to them, ‚Äúthis is the right thing to do.‚Äù		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Gigi Stetler:		We all have to realize that change is possible.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Ameshia Cross on the black community:		We have to do more within our own households and communities to be successful. Right now, we‚Äôre fighting against something that‚Äôs bigger than ourselves.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Officer Luke Haglof:		I think it‚Äôs dangerous to make blanket statements. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture
@AttorneyCrump:		There‚Äôs a system out there that says we have to fill these prisons ‚Äî often times for profit. That system says these prisons have to be filled with somebody, and that somebody usually happens to be a person of color.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
@AttorneyCrump:		I agree with #MalcolmX that television is one of the most powerful drugs to ever be created because it controls your subconscious thoughts without you even being aware of it.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Gigi Stetler:		There needs to be a better system put in place for ppl right now, not just when they enter into the prison system. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Officer Luke Haglof brought some facts to the table. He brought up an example in law enforcement.		Based on his stats, in a scenario where ‚Äú1.2M ppl were arrested for an alleged crime, only 23% of those individuals were actually convicted of the crime.‚Äù		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Gigi Stetler on the importance of second chances for young people in America:		We have to start with education. Education starts at home. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Luke Haglof, a police officer since 1999, says ‚Äúit‚Äôs very important that we operate based off of statistics‚Äù when it comes to this conversation about the interactions between law enforcement and the black community. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Ameshia Cross, the State Director of the Pretrial Justice Institute, a national criminal justice reform nonprofit:		It‚Äôs upsetting that we elevate one type of criminal activity over another.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
@AttorneyCrump challenges mainstream media and its attempt to define our children. He says the media shouldn‚Äôt only cover black on white or white on black crimes. The media should cover the loss of any race of people. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture
@AttorneyCrump:		It‚Äôs safe to say that #MLK is turning over in his grave based on what is currently happening in America.		#YourVoiceYourFuture
Gigi Stetler, created and leads the first and only female-owned RV company in the United States - RV Sales of Broward: 		If a black person shoots a black person, nobody cares. If a white person shoots a white person, nobody cares. 		#YourVoiceYourFuture

We all have value. None of us are right or wrong all of the time. I no longer just look at things as a Republican. I view things as an American. #AW
To me, there‚Äôs no freedom until you own your own business just like there‚Äôs no such thing as freedom of speech unless you own the press. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always said. #AW
We have this thing called ‚Äúspiritual currency.‚Äù The victory is in the struggle. The currency is in the struggle. Sometimes you have to take these obstacles and make them your foot stool. #AW
Unfortunately, we judge our success by money, wealth and material things. We make people believe that they‚Äôre not successful without those things. #AW
I think #Trump treats everybody the same. He‚Äôs an equal opportunity offender. It‚Äôs not about racism for this president. It‚Äôs about power and winning. #AW
We forget that members of Congress represent every segment of American society (the good, bad and ugly). I have no sympathy for #SteveKing, and they should condemn him. #AW
It marginalizes blacks by saying that they have found their place in life because of affirmative action. #AW
Affirmative action benefits very few. It has actually benefited white women the most. Blacks have benefited from it the least. It‚Äôs not really designed for the poor or the middle class. #AW
One of the things that #MLKJr talked about prior to his death was that economic empowerment was becoming the new paradigm. #AW
We need to find the value in each other. https://t.co/465RsPCeNj
We all come into this world differently, but we cannot be afraid to get to know one another. #AW
Policy is a political football in this country. We need to stop using people for our political gain and actually start to empower people instead. #AW
Most people don‚Äôt want a government handout. They want to be able to take care of their families. Everything the government has in place is not in the best interest of the people. #AW
Policies need to evolve. Government needs to evolve. Why is it that in 2019 we‚Äôre talking about the same issues? #AW

This view also extends to almost all other parts of the Arab society. Their society is held together by a strong sense of moral and family values that start at the household level and go all the way up to the legal and political system of the country. https://t.co/apQPezmzm1
Arabs hold the highest standards of reporting to provable facts, and have very strict laws against publishing false and misleading information.  From their perspective, these restrictions help hold the media to a higher standard of the reporting of facts in a balanced way. https://t.co/UGIhzJEyRi

Death, we are taught, is the price of sin for which Adam and his progeny were doomed to pay for his and Eve‚Äôs disobeying the instruction of God not to partake of the tree of knowledge. Christ was born, in essence, to die in an act of atonement for man‚Äôs sin. https://t.co/P0V7DbkIsM

At some point Dems must begin choosing leaders who are more concerned with governing a land of many viewpoints beyond their narrow ones.

She then privately admits and revels that she was proud to have goaded the president into a showdown?  That‚Äôs real classy, #Pelosi. 		Way to be America‚Äôs grandmother. 		Would Barbara Bush or even Michelle Obama have done such a thing, then snickered like one ‚Äúgot away‚Äù with it?? https://t.co/YwwJD5t8QU
This is not the first time she has questioned Trump‚Äôs manhood...saying something of equal invective just a few months ago. Look...I get that she and many in her party do not like this man. But he is still the president of the people. 		#NancyPelosi https://t.co/x8We0eG6eZ
Would we ever stand or accept a statement of equal poison from a male? Just the thought that something against a female - and behind closed doors - would cause the Left to howl in opposition and outrage.		#NancyPelosi https://t.co/SIKCfsLGja
Talk of his masculinity with words such as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like a manhood thing for him‚Äù are beneath her and any public official. https://t.co/jWhrD4c5Pa
Utterly amazed that minutes after #NancyPelosi - the presumed incoming Speaker of the House - leaves a meeting with the President she then scurries to the corridors of her caucus to lambaste him in private. https://t.co/E8En2Ke11y
What else do you say beyond earshot? What thoughts do you harbor and do they have the interests of the nation at heart?  Remember, your 2nd in line to the highest office in the land! Let‚Äôs be more judicious in our rhetoric...		#NancyPelosi https://t.co/MagzCLjyl4
And then to retreat behind closed doors to say such things in private - that only reveals where your heart and your hatred lie. 		#NancyPelosi https://t.co/hJHx25HW2E
America didn‚Äôt welcome a party that likes to pick fights with Trump. Sure he‚Äôs a different kind of leader. But what do YOUR actions say about you? 		#NancyPelosi https://t.co/fy4FEyPmJS

Nowhere, perhaps, is this more pronounced than on college campuses, where the Obama admin. made a test case of new rules governing sexual engagement pursuant to Title IX ‚Äî greatly expanding the scope of a law originally intended to assure gender equality in college sports. https://t.co/nv3KQvaqQD
The attitudes about assault are becoming so rigid that the mere leveling of the accusation is enough to severely damage or destroy the lives of the accused, without proving guilt. https://t.co/HN4eBE0QOR
Some see this change in attitudes as a welcome sign of progress for our culture. But there are also losers in this scenario ‚Äî namely, falsely accused young men. https://t.co/pvZl853806
Half of them also believe that our societal standards about ‚Äúwhat is acceptable‚Äù are shifting. https://t.co/vJReaYmaHh

To think that they really believed that they could provide a safe and loving environment for Sophia after committing such dastardly deeds against her mother and her family seems far-fetched and delusional. 		#AWTalks #RhodenMassacre https://t.co/vTlce0CYDY
Not only did they destroy the Rhoden family, they also destroyed themselves in the process. I cannot imagine the train of thought that allowed them to believe that they could ever live in peace after committing such acts, regardless of whether the law caught up with them or not. https://t.co/IC2U8hT179
The Wagners forgot the fundamental law of gratitude, which is always to be grateful for the blessings we have in our lives.¬†In forgetting this fundamental lesson, the Wagners ended up committing one of the worst atrocities in the annals of American crime. https://t.co/39t43sRsHe
It‚Äôs likely that they‚Äôll never see or speak to Sophia again, and they will each end up in solitary prison cells until their appeals have been exhausted or until they die in prison ‚Äì alone, on death row shamed, condemned and alone. https://t.co/Ehn671MdHz
Now that they have all been caught (including the grandmothers of the accused who have been charged as accessories after the fact), what will their relationship with Sophia be going forward? https://t.co/E6qWLkx9Pu
They say hindsight is 20/20, but in the Wagner case even a tiny bit of foresight might have helped. How in the world did these people believe that they would be able to get away with committing eight murders of a single family across three crime scenes?		#AWTalks #RhodenMassacre

Let us not forget as a nation that President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs very first action as President was to bow in prayer. That‚Äôs right. During his inaugural address, he bowed his head and led the nation in what we should all do more of - beseeching our Heavenly Father. #GeorgeBush

Turn to the blood of Christ. Turn to the only cleansing agent in the universe that can give you relief in life and peace in death. https://t.co/EUxXsGDB5V
The only answer in this modern age, as in every other age is the blood of Christ. When your conscience rises up and condemns you, where will you turn? Hebrew 9:14 gives you the answer: turn to Christ. https://t.co/IG9oZMhw6K
We are defiled by attitudes like pride and self-pity and bitterness and lust and envy and jealousy and covetousness and apathy and fear. https://t.co/h6M23qnJW1
We know that our conscience is defiled ‚Äî not with external things like touching a corpse, a dirty diaper, or a piece of pork. Jesus said it is what comes out of a man that defiles, not what goes in (Mark 7:15-23). https://t.co/Ciw9Y48GQa
We can cut ourselves, or throw our children in the sacred river, or give a million dollars to charity, or serve in a soup kitchen, or a hundred forms of penance and self-injury, and the result will be the same: the stain remains and death terrifies. https://t.co/jCaT2844ej
So here we are in the modern age ‚Äî the age of the Internet, smart phones, space travel, and heart transplants ‚Äî and our problem is fundamentally the same as always: our consciences condemn us and make us feel unacceptable to God. We are alienated from God. https://t.co/J6KWvucUnn

It seems as if the distinctions between flirtation, courtship, simply loutish behavior, and actual assault are being blurred in a way that is hard for young men to fathom. #AWTalks https://t.co/mMtj1NGW5u
But amidst the heightened sensitivity to sexual harassment that has arisen along with #MeToo, the culture is changing. In the age of ‚Äòaffirmative consent,‚Äô young men navigating the dangerous waters of romance, sex and college sports find themselves on shifting seas. https://t.co/mDDddTloxn
The trope of college football players at parties having sex with starry-eyed freshmen is almost as old as college athletics itself. Before now it has not been behavior that has been criminalized by our culture.

Given that all of these things have happened repeatedly throughout history, our tendency is to read the tea leaves through the lens of human tragedy merely because they happened to take place on this President‚Äôs watch. Honestly, it seems a bit strange...
Saints have saved sinners and battled temptations since time immemorial. It has never been a matter of IF evil would strike, but when.
There were crazies out there targeting churches and synagogues long before #MAGA happened. There were school shootings, natural disasters, wars and famines. Cruel foreign despots have killed their subjects with impunity as far back as recorded civilization.
There were mass murders in churches several years ago in South Carolina, long before Trump became President. Despite what the mainstream rhetoric would lead you to believe, racism didn‚Äôt suddenly materialize the day Donald Trump was elected. #AWTalks #Trump

Sure, Pelosi pushes a Medicare-for-All initiative that, if enacted, would add trillions to the national debt and send these newcomers home in two years quicker than snow melting in my home state of South Carolina.
Rank-and-file Democrats ‚Äì and especially freshmen ‚Äì would do well to pass over Pelosi as their leader. Quite simply, she reflects what is tired and dated about the Democrats. #AWTalks #Pelosi
Up until just before Thanksgiving, no solid candidate had stepped forward to challenge Pelosi. Even today, it‚Äôs not clear if one will emerge. Yet there are several whisper campaigns brewing that Pelosi does not have the support nor the votes of her caucus to grab the gavel again.

At some point, I pray that peace will truly descent on Israel and its holy capital city Jerusalem. But until then, Israel is righteous in taking the necessary steps, by any means necessary, to fight terrorism and defend their people. #Israel
Imagine a world in which the Israeli people were not forced to take defensive or preventative military action against those infected with blind hatred. #Israel
Flareups of violence emanating from Gaza derail progress to the peace and reconciliation that Israelis so earnestly seek. #Israeli

If people had @MichelleObama‚Äôs message, it could really heal the country and bring people together. #AWTalks #becomingmichelleobama
It was the most intellectual, common sense speech that I‚Äôve heard in a long time.¬†She empowers women, deals with race in a way that avoids blame and guilt, and ultimately her message was that we all have work to do. 	#becomingmichelleobama https://t.co/Jmjowtg3PR
Once she opened herself up to ppl she thought she had nothing in common with, she learned a lot about herself.

There was so much value to be had, and while the audience was overwhelmingly female (90%), there was truly something for everyone.	#becomingmichelleobama https://t.co/lrFNKlnKgs
@MichelleObama‚Äôs speech was pure, not political, eye opening and educational.¬†She talked about the value of books in the hands of children, education, marital troubles, her misgivings about politics, and the list goes on.¬†	#becomingmichelleobama https://t.co/NlKly6p9uG
Reflections on a Night With @MichelleObama 		I‚Äôve had an epiphany.¬†We spend loads of money to watch musical artists perform. While we are entertained, we rarely, if ever, take much with us. This was different.¬†Michelle gave one of the best speeches I‚Äôve heard for quite sometime.

They are tired of being told by politicians and bureaucrats what they can and cannot do. If Democrats are serious about continuing to run competitive campaigns, they need to speak to the issues that are directly facing the American people. https://t.co/6wl9Auqfls
This elitist mentality is certainly part of the reason why Donald Trump won the 2016 election and increased the number in the 2018 U.S Senate races. People are tired of being looked down upon from the thrones of Washington, DC. https://t.co/TOWnD1uCZs

The true cost of love and intimacy is commitment and faithfulness. These are enduring principles, unchanged by any artifice man can possibly engineer. https://t.co/9y1voqpqnr

Set aside the personality problems, and childish behavior from CNN, Mr. President. Allow the press to return. You‚Äôve made your point. Thanks. https://t.co/zrX2fc7EsE
@realDonaldTrump and WH should reinstate the press pass for CNN‚Äôs Jim Acosta. I didn‚Äôt like his behavior at all last week. But mistakes and egregious behavior should not impede the free press‚Äôs ability to cover the news.
And as much as that socialist-leaning policy scares me as a conservative, it represents a fresh reset on a core tenet of the Democratic platform that appeals to young people across the country. https://t.co/0L4napVFah
In fact, it has revived now and is less about Obamacare and more about expanded Medicare for all...single-payer systems where universal coverage is now the battle cry. https://t.co/sgA0it6uW3
In a word, it is old. It is an old agenda at a time when American voters ‚Äî even of the Left's persuasion ‚Äî rejected in the guise of Hillary Clinton. The populace is clamoring for new ideas. Take health care. That issue has not disappeared. https://t.co/1OGsPUdahC
Rather, it is a statement that the political theology she and her fellow octogenarian Democrats currently espouse is tired, stale and in desperate need of a reset. https://t.co/DckkeqoWnc
Nothing says a return-to-the-old-way of doing things more than the California liberal whose only achievement in the next few years will be reaching octogenarian status. That is not an ageist statement. https://t.co/tr87NzIead
For Democrats to lead an appealing counter-message to the Trump Doctrine, they need an effective leader in the House; someone who is the de facto face of the party, able to refreshingly usher in a new era that Hillary Clinton could not. That individual is not Nancy Pelosi. https://t.co/PnvVQqY7sw
It is wise that the Democratic leadership is not anointing Minority Leader Pelosi as their incoming Speaker of the House. #AWTalks

THANK YOU to @ABC7News, Howard Stirk Holdings, and my amazing panel for making tonight‚Äôs town hall about the #midterms a huge success! One thing we can all agree on is that we must get out there and VOTE on November, 6th.
HSH Senior Correspondent, Dr. Devon Smith (@Devon_Bianca): 		I think Republicans will maintain the Senate, but I have a feeling that the House of Reps might be in jeopardy. #midterms
Partner of Global Political Solutions LLC, Aaron Manaigo: 		My prediction is that Republicans will maintain the House of Reps from somewhere between 5-7 seats. #midterms
Founder and President of The Center for Urban Renewal and Education, Star Parker: 		The midterm elections, this time around, are very much so a national issue. It‚Äôs mobs or jobs. #midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		If Dems win, they‚Äôre going to try to dismantle tax reform. #midterms
Founder and President of The Center for Urban Renewal and Education, Star Parker: 		I do not believe @realDonaldTrump will compromise with Democrats if they take over the House. #midterms
Partner of Global Political Solutions LLC, Aaron Manaigo: 		Infrastructure will be the only kind of legislation that will end up being bipartisan. #midterms
If Democrats win, who will become the Speaker of the House? #Midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		This notion of ‚Äúvoter suppression‚Äù has been talked about. I believe Republicans should be encouraging ‚Äúvoter aggression‚Äù in these elections. #midterms
Partner of Global Political Solutions LLC, Aaron Manaigo: 		You have illegal ppl in this country casting legal votes because they‚Äôre registering to vote in these sanctuary cities. I‚Äôm concerned about that. #midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		Historically, absentee votes outside of the military have favored Democrats. #midterms
HSH Senior Correspondent, Dr. Devon Smith (@Devon_Bianca): 		In these elections, the #MeToo movement will divide women across America. #midterms
Partner of Global Political Solutions LLC, Aaron Manaigo:		If the economy is the #1 issue, then things are leaning towards @realDonaldTrump. #midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		Republicans should see a gain in the races for governor. #midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		People are either going to vote based on the last thing that @realDonaldTrump has tweeted or based on the last thing that @NancyPelosi said. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs come to. #midterms
Founder and President of The Center for Urban Renewal and Education, Star Parker: 		#Democrats want to CONTROL people‚Äôs decisions. #midterms
Constitutional Lawyer Shelby Emmett: 		We‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù leader in politics, despite what you might hear. #midterms
HSH Senior Correspondent, Dr. Devon Smith (@Devon_Bianca): 		This, to me, is a behavioral election. Ppl are fed up with the way ppl are behaving right now (public verbal attacks aimed at the ‚Äòopposition‚Äô). I think this behavioral issue is very one-sided. #midterms #Democrats
Constitutional Lawyer Shelby Emmett: 		I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a Democrat or Republican. Everyone agrees with the president when he says, ‚ÄúWhy are we always taking care of their kids and not our own?‚Äù #immigration #midterms
Founder and President of The Center for Urban Renewal and Education, Star Parker: 		Georgia had record numbers of people going out to vote early. #midterms
Co-Founder and CEO of J.C. Watts Companies, Elroy Sailor: 		Let‚Äôs remember that @BarackObama lost 63 seats in his first term. #midterms
Constitutional Lawyer Shelby Emmett: 		A lot of these elections are local. Unfortunately, a lot of Republican candidates are still trying to run on a national level. #midterms
Founder and President of The Center for Urban Renewal and Education, Star Parker: 		This election is unique because most people understand that we are a very divided country right now. Most voters today understand what‚Äôs at stake. #midterms

@HillaryClinton‚Äôs fate, no matter how much she has served in all the critical capacities in our government, was to never ever occupy the Oval Office and to lose to someone who no one really thought had a snowball‚Äôs chance of winning. A true outsider.
It shines a light on who the elite of the Democratic Party really are as opposed to their unmarred media portrayals. In the same way that reading a book can give you language to describe feelings you don‚Äôt have words for, Dummycrats gave me the evidence to confirm my beliefs. https://t.co/bMfbR9I16D
My instincts, which my parents helped me hone on our farm in South Carolina, have always indicated to me that something was amiss. I received my confirmation last night at the premiere of @DiamondandSilk‚Äôs new movie #Dummycrats. It was an eye opener, a revelation, a must see.
The Democrats at the highest level consistently let down their constituents in meaningful ways to improve their daily lives. https://t.co/tJr1ndqVAw
Trying ‚Äúanything‚Äù turned into making a man with no political experience the leader of the free world. Sometimes we wonder why. To many in the U.S., ironically left leaners, the word ‚Äúpolitician‚Äù has become synonymous with things like ‚Äúliar, swindler, and snake oil salesman.‚Äù https://t.co/k7FYbZFfQv
@HillaryClinton was a hallmark of the status quo in politics of which Americans have grown tiresome. The kind of tiresome that makes you feel like your back is against the wall...one that makes you want to take risks, the kind of tiresome that bears a willingness to try anything!
People now trust unbridled leadership because they are so disillusioned with the status quo. That‚Äôs why @realDonaldTrump won and remains in command.

@realDonaldTrump showed great deference, respect, and care for the A list artist during his Oval Office visit. When‚Äôs the last time we‚Äôve seen an entertainer with such direct influence of national politics hold court on a variety of issues with the global press carrying it live?

There‚Äôs no question about whether or not @BarackObama laid the ground work. He did. But, as we know, the president gets all the blame and all the credit at the same time. That said, I think our president is doing a superb job with the economy, policy and the tariffs. #Trump
In response to a question I was asked on the @RussParrShow...		Voting is a choice. I believe in the right to vote. If you don't vote, then you can't complain about the electoral outcomes. That said, everyone should be allowed to vote. I don't care what the issues are. #Vote
Let's at least allow #Kanye and the president to meet first before we criticize them as if we already know the results of their dialogue.	Something positive could very well come of this. If it doesn't, then we can criticize. But until then, let's let the meeting happen first.
#Kanye is still receiving flack today for his ‚Äúslavery was a choice‚Äù comment. No, that wasn‚Äôt one of his best moments. But we can't judge people based on one statement, especially when they‚Äôve made thousands of other statements that we would agree with. We must be fair.
#Kanye is more than an entertainer. I think we should give him his due credit.
#Kanye criticized former President @BarackObama for not doing enough for his hometown of Chicago. Kanye also felt that something needed to be done about the innocent black people in Chicago‚Äôs prison system. I‚Äôm optimistic that today‚Äôs meeting with @realDonaldTrump will help.

More broadly though, Kanye‚Äôs political focus seems to be personal, local and community oriented. Kanye sees a way out through a different door, a trait common among visionaries. #AWTalks #KanyeWest https://t.co/y2GFJWqwDR

They say a rising tide lifts all boats, true, and very few boats ride the crest of the wave. #MiddleClass
The middle class of my memory wasn‚Äôt one of worry, it was one where a household could be provided with necessities and luxuries on a single, minimum wage, income.
It has been said that after a salary of about $80k, our happiness is no longer meaningfully affected by increases of income. At this level we are able to provide for ourselves without worry. Should that be the threshold? #MiddleClass
We all know plenty of people with cars, degrees, and access to quality food that still have to worry about money. Having your life undergirded by worry is not a pleasant way to live.
Kharas further asserts that 50% of the planet will be at this threshold by 2020. https://t.co/GsYBWnXhci
According to Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institute, middle class is defined by the ability to pay for food, shelter, and clothing with enough money left over for some luxury and leisure. Luxuries like a car, higher education, home improvements, and better food.
By the definition of my middle class, about 5% of Americans are still middle class. Down from over 50% after World War II. #MiddleClass
Today, we have confused middle class with food security and not being impoverished. https://t.co/LetiNSeSLI
The middle class majority depends on how you define ‚Äúmiddle class.‚Äù  As many were growing up, it meant that you could afford a modest home, two cars, send your kids to school, pay your bills (including medical), and retire with dignity. #MiddleClass
You won‚Äôt hear this anywhere...a new global era launches a middle class majority.

Nothing of true gravity gets solved in the court of public opinion, or resolved in the heat of passion - even if that passion is derived of righteous indignation. Cooler heads usually prevail.

One of the most sacred principles in the American criminal justice system and court of public opinion is holding that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty.

Men willing to literally go to blows in defense of women. https://t.co/N5hmSWUobv
On episode 26 of the StrongCast, one of our guests made it very clear that all men are not predatory and her experiences have demonstrated the overwhelming majority of men, sober or otherwise, would step up and defend women subject to unwelcome advances.
At the outset, the #MeToo movement was an eye opener for us all. It‚Äôs amazing how it hit so close to home. Since then, however, the movement has become weaponized and used to turn men into the enemy and attack them.
Do we really want our daughters to grow up thinking that unchastened predatory behavior lurks beneath the surface of every man? https://t.co/r6QLp370si
Nothing could be more disempowering than to teach women that men are their enemy, and that a potential sexual assault is an unstated threat in almost all aspects of male-female interaction. Is that what we want our daughters to learn? https://t.co/wjRAl2TqA1
#MeToo has grown into a badge of solidarity among women. Some have found strength in stepping forward to proclaim, ‚Äúme too,‚Äù and then taking control of their lives, while others have chosen to take solace in victimhood.

It‚Äôs just my opinion, and we‚Äôre a society of free will and opinions. Whatever you choose to decide about his fate, you have every right and I defend your right to have that opinion. However, for me, Bill Cosby should not spend a day in jail. #BillCosby https://t.co/v1zao6ofHE
It has nothing to do with his fame and what he contributed to the fabric of American society, and if you feel differently, I understand. 	However, for me and my house, I think they should let the man live out his last days in his home with an ankle bracelet monitoring him. #Cosby https://t.co/qMNNrTpBcS
Should he go to jail? I know that‚Äôs what our laws say, but I believe in mercy and grace. Cosby will never be able to escape the shame that he‚Äôs caused many innocent women. The man should just be placed on house arrest. I don‚Äôt want to see Bill Cosby die in jail. #BillCosby https://t.co/a7StL85rEI
He has to live with what he‚Äôs done as an elderly man who is now alone, miserable, empty, at a loss, and blind. That‚Äôs the way in which he‚Äôll have to live his life until God calls him home. The man has been punished already. #BillCosby https://t.co/xm1Zv78QZu
That said, today, Cosby is an 81-year-old man. He‚Äôs blind. He‚Äôs lost two of his children, a son and a daughter. His marriage is rocky. For me, I think the man has already been punished. I think Cosby has already faced his sentencing. #BillCosby https://t.co/i8Ue7Styoo
Obviously, the world has changed quite a bit from what it was a few decades ago. As we know, Cosby has admitted to such conduct over the years, and my sympathy is with the women who were drugged by this man. He was wrong. #BillCosby https://t.co/F0NMJdVqkX
Today, the judge in Bill Cosby‚Äôs trial handed down a 3-10 yr sentence, which means Cosby could potentially die in jail. Cosby, in my mind, without a doubt drugged those women.

In a challenging media landscape in which broadcasters face growing competitive pressures from online streaming services like Netflix, massive national and multi-market MVPDs, consolidated cable operators, and telephony and fiber, small broadcast operators simply cannot survive. https://t.co/93nm3JE7gV

So let us stand in awe and wonder. And let us tremble that not only our praises of God‚Äôs sovereignty but also our salvation through the death of Christ for us, hang on this: ‚ÄúOur God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases.‚Äù #SundayRead
At the one point in the history of the universe where Jesus looked trapped, He was totally in charge doing precisely what He pleased ‚Äî dying to justify the ungodly like you and me. #SundayRead
And on His way to Calvary, Jesus Himself had legions at His disposal. ‚ÄúNo one takes my life from me; I lay it down of my own accord‚Äù ‚Äî of His own good pleasure, for the joy that is set before Him. https://t.co/6TvgKF7tHd
Paul says that the self-sacrifice of Jesus in death was ‚Äúa fragrant offering and sacrifice to God‚Äù (Ephesians 5:2). The greatest sin and the greatest death and the hardest act of God was pleasing to the Father. https://t.co/WL8az3MSMm
Even at the one point in history where He did what in one sense was the hardest thing for God to do, ‚Äúnot spare His own Son‚Äù (Romans 8:32), God was free and doing what pleased Him. #SundayRead
God never becomes the victim of circumstance. He is never forced into a situation where He must do something in which He cannot rejoice. He is not mocked. He is not trapped or cornered or coerced. #SundayRead
This should lead us to bow before God and praise His sovereign freedom ‚Äî that in some sense at least He always acts in freedom, according to His own ‚Äúgood pleasure,‚Äù following the dictates of His own delights. https://t.co/t76pLRTTuq
God is never constrained to do a thing that He despises. He is never backed into a corner where His only recourse is to do something He hates to do.		He does whatever He pleases. And therefore, in some sense, He has pleasure in all that He does. #SundayRead
Our God is in the heavens; He does all that He pleases. (Psalm 115:3)		This verse teaches that whenever God acts, Hs acts in a way that pleases Him. #Sundays

People need to become more entrepreneurial these days to survive. But what they don‚Äôt often realize is that doing so requires the use of mental and psychological tools that may be unfamiliar to them. #entrepreneurs
The spring precedes the summer, which precedes the fall and the winter. In the spring, one plants. In the fall, one harvests. In the winter, one relies on sustenance upon the storehouse of goods harvested in the fall that grew from the seeds planted in the spring. https://t.co/IowyJmMHxp
I believe that in life there are definite seasons, and that the pattern is inexorable.
But my entrepreneurial mindset is guided by a deep faith and belief in the laws of creation. I know for a fact that if you sow, you shall reap. https://t.co/e3V5Coe2VW
The entrepreneurial mindset exposes us to uncertainty. There is no guideline, formula or timetable that dictates when an idea or a relationship will bear fruit. That can be frightening to some people. #Entrepreneur
The #entrepreneur‚Äôs perception of time is not linear, it is pivotal. As an entrepreneur, I am willing to spend a lot of my time not directly earning income. I spend time building relationships with key allies and future business associates. I give time to worthy causes.

What we are ultimately doing is creating a nation of hypocrites. In a world where life-long perfection becomes the standard litmus test, we will have supposedly infallible politicians setting an impossible bar for their political adversaries to overcome. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/JmUVN7EzVs

Read my latest column, ‚ÄúIsraeli's Tradition of Modesty Prevents Modern Social Ills.‚Äù	https://t.co/HhZb7pX6zg
Perhaps it would behoove us to forsake all of the uncertainty and follow the example of more modest societies, such as Israel in delineating those boundaries more clearly. #AW https://t.co/J00JCXF1K2
No one has the right to offend another person, but often the lines between casual conduct and unwanted harassment can be frighteningly difficult to navigate. https://t.co/CzkcTb8qcN
The appearance of permissiveness in the absence of actual permission can be confounding. What we communicate with our words, our dress and the way we carry ourselves says a lot, and may even invite conduct that we would consider offensive. https://t.co/4AP56wLbv3
My inadvertent transgression as someone new to the culture caused me to think that perhaps what we in the U.S. might consider an arcane and overly restrictive culture might have some advantages over our modern liberal ways. https://t.co/xlNgE4s0wk
They, of course, quickly forgave me, noting that I was unaware of this unspoken boundary between the sexes. The prohibition against touching is part of a broader social custom of modesty that includes the way people dress, make eye contact and discuss personal issues in settings. https://t.co/2s75JytO63
However, when I went to hug my hostess, she noticeably recoiled. I asked if I had offended her, and was told that in Israel it is considered improper for men and women, who are not married or related, to touch each other. https://t.co/kFgq1WrA1j
In Israel, I had the pleasure of being shown around the country by my gracious and kind hosts, Serena Potash and her gracious daughters Sarah Patcher and Chana Pintz. As an American and a southerner, I am accustomed to hugging friends, both male and female, as a form of greeting.
That time I interviewed the champ @FloydMayweather ahead of his most lucrative fight against @TheNotoriousMMA. 	50-0 	#tbt https://t.co/ZJltBRjRZk
Wipe the slate clean and plant new seeds of endeavor...tend them, grow them, and guard the seedlings of intention ferociously. Constantly beat yourself with the broom of radical truth. #AW
Breaking the endless pattern of fruitless adventure and getting to completion of your life‚Äôs purpose requires starting from within. Start with the things you can control. Give to others and forgive others. #AW
Life is not all about an adventure...we often set up struggles for ourselves just to feel alive; not really making real progress, but feeling breathless from wasted effort. Life is not about what adventures you‚Äôve had - it‚Äôs about the number of people you enrich. #AW

Read my latest column, ‚ÄúKavanaugh an excellent fit to continue the Supreme Court's honored tradition.‚Äù 	https://t.co/n59IuRapP7
Well, that is exactly what @realDonaldTrump has done by nominating Judge Brett Kavanaugh and it‚Äôs a tradition that must continue regardless of what party the president belongs to. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/AbAdB6Dvkg
Not everyone will like who the president nominates and sometimes, such as with former President‚Äôs George W. Bush and Obama, nominees don‚Äôt always make it through the process, but we should continue to expect that the best and most qualified people are nominated for the job.
Presidents are lucky if they‚Äôre able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court. It‚Äôs a lifetime appointment that allows presidents of both major political parties to, in many ways, leave their mark on the American populous. #Kavanaugh
#Kavanaugh and his team are doing all the right things ‚Äì keeping the main thing the main thing. He‚Äôs showing us how, as a Justice, he‚Äôll conduct himself in real-world situations. He‚Äôs proving to the Senate and nation that he‚Äôs the right person for the job. That‚Äôs all we can ask.
Decades from now, few if any will look back and remember the 70 individuals who disrupted the first day of hearings and found themselves arrested and removed from the Senate Judiciary chamber. That‚Äôs inconsequential. #Kavanaugh
That‚Äôs all well and good, and certainly a view they are entitled to. But at the end of the day, those disagreements certainly do not disqualify Kavanaugh as a solid judge to ascend to this Court. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/i6hGfGq1Cq
Kavanaugh‚Äôs ideological opponents may not like his responses, but not because he is wrong; they just disagree with him on principle. #Kavanaugh
That‚Äôs the beauty of our Republic ‚Äì a government and a Constitution that are both dynamic, adapting and changing to meet the present-day challenges of society. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/IPmMnmhPSR
‚ÄúSettled law‚Äù is a nice, tidy phrase. But just as no Congress can bind future Congresses, no Court can bind future Supreme Court decisions. #Kavanaugh https://t.co/3w2SRbF844

In a perfect world, even a pop star would show up to a church funeral service fully clothed and reverent. In a perfect world, a reverend would not take liberties to touch a young woman in any way that could be construed as sexually demonstrative. https://t.co/CWpChU0Nso

Too many holes here for those who want to pull this cloak and dagger stuff in the name of freedom. Very dangerous for democracy. One thought: It lacks all accountability. And transparency and accountability are the hallmarks of any Republic. https://t.co/s5ps8eQ5xT
This comes eerily on the heels of a #Woodward book that aligns with a competitive paper - the @washingtonpost. https://t.co/s5ps8eQ5xT

Israel - Where do I Even Begin? 	By Devon Bianca	https://t.co/gHJnFWwicN https://t.co/gHJnFWwicN
So the Trump WH has dysfunction. That‚Äôs not news. I‚Äôm sorry...		How about this...fire Pelosi, adopt centrist policies, reject Medicare for All, and work with the president on domestic infrastructure. #AW
I‚Äôm sorry but this is standard operating procedure for #Woodward - lean on your Watergate halcyon days, let the publishing house sensationalize the release...then drop a few half-truths and voila! #AW
The buzz in Washington around #BobWoodward‚Äôs new ‚Äútell-all‚Äù book is mostly hype for two reasons:		1) We already have a birdseye view of the West Wing through @realDonaldTrump and his Twitter handle and 2) no staffer of any significance would give details to a Wash Post reporter.
It doesn‚Äôt make sense. So it likely didn‚Äôt occur. And going after #Mattis made no sense. #BobWoodward https://t.co/oMPVxFlXLK
The latest allegations of #BobWoodward stretch even the most vivid political imagination to the point of sheer fabrication. I can‚Äôt imagine any savvy politico saying the things he alleges...and in the presence of a journalist whose only motive was to print scandal. #AW

Of course the Chinese are exploiting Africa - and of course the quality of some of their projects are disastrous. But a serious historical point still stands. Before China it was Europe constructing shabby infrastructure and exploiting Africa. Then it was the U.S. - point stands
@SecretaryCarson is heartfelt in his empathy for the plight of the poor. He aims to solve the problem of protracted poverty by offering a pathway towards prosperity. #AW
@SecretaryCarson has looked at the long-term data and realized that generations of families have been essentially stuck in poverty, relying upon government services for subsistence rather than making choices and striving to achieve the American dream. #AW
Despite the media‚Äôs attempt to portray @SecretaryCarson as clueless and in way over his head, since taking office at HUD, Carson methodically and deliberately studied the problem of housing the poor. #AW
What also doesn‚Äôt look good is any pro-growth agenda should Dems take control of the House. You can bet their first bill - HR 1 - will be Medicare for All. Terrible costly health plan. https://t.co/CKgoWcbzkw
Democrats need just 23 to regain control of the House. This doesn‚Äôt look good for Republicans. https://t.co/JxiCRjLUcy

When we come into the presence of a Holy God, our Savior says, ‚ÄúI paid it all for these my sheep. They are worthy because I am worthy...‚Äù	Hallelujah! What a love! #AW
But God will not wink at sin. He cannot abide it. He is too holy; too pure. So in order to come into His presence, we need to be purified or our sin covered. Jesus is that perfect substitution. #AW
God is a relational God. The God-head is three persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and just as the Trinity fellowships relationally with each other, God wants to fellowship with us. #AW
What a friend we have in Jesus!  	Think about that: our Creator yearns for a relationship with His children. #AW

I can remember times when, in Congress, 43 Democrats would leave their side of the aisle and join Republicans in supporting initiatives.	It wasn‚Äôt always ‚Äúparty first.‚Äù Sen. McCain put country first. And his votes reflected the interests of his constituents and his country. #AW
That‚Äôs the way the Fathers intended. Tension, when displayed in a constructive way, is good for growth. America needs those in both parties to question strict ideology that perhaps blinds them from doing what‚Äôs in the best interest of the country. #AW https://t.co/LjZPWIhl0r

No matter what your thoughts are on @PARISDENNARD and they range from high to low, he deserves fairness, grace, mercy, and our prayers.
Midterms are close and though Democrats have a slight edge, if they continue to run on impeaching @realDonaldTrump, they'll continue to erode their own credibility in the eyes of the American people. #Midterms
Instead of looking for ways to impeach the president, Democrats should actually try working with him because his policies have proven largely beneficial to the American people. #Trump
Even those who may dislike @realDonaldTrump personally have admitted to the success of the economy, which benefits all Americans. #Trump
People are earning higher wages, they're seeing those around them who have been looking for jobs for months finally get them and consumer confidence is at an all-time high. So what will #Democrats‚Äô promise be? More government regulation? Open borders and less economic prosperity?
With the stock market, economy, and job market breaking records, it's hard for Democrats to argue against the success of the Trump presidency. #Trump
With midterms quickly approaching, Democrats and their supporters in the mainstream media struggle to develop a message about the issues. They're running on being anti-Trump and that is not enough to turn out voters to the polls. #Midterms
Despite the obvious disdain disguised as allegations of criminal activity, @realDonaldTrump deserves the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise. #Trump

The gospel-love God gives is ultimately the gift of Himself. This is what we were made for. This is what we lost in our sin. This is what Christ came to restore.		‚ÄúIn your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.‚Äù (Psalm 16:11)
Test your heart. Why do you want forgiveness? Why do you want to be justified? Why do you want eternal life? Is the decisive answer: "because I want to enjoy God"?
We are given eternal life now, with new bodies in the resurrection, so that we have the capacities for enjoying God to the fullest.
We are forgiven so that our guilt does not keep us away from God.	We are justified so that our condemnation does not keep us away from God.
The gospel is the enjoyment of fellowship with God himself. This is made explicit here in 1 Peter 3:18 in the phrase, ‚Äúthat he might bring us to God.‚Äù #Sabbath https://t.co/Dk7bMhIblk
What We Were Made For:		Christ suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God. 	(1 Peter 3:18)
Do you believe in God but don‚Äôt want him to tell you how to run your life?  Religion is is a set of fundamental beliefs that helps us understand the world we live in. We want a relationship with God with limited demands !  We must grow spiritually.

Both are deadly substances! Addict-worthy doses of death. Don‚Äôt believe me? Go out and offer an #opioid addict some marijuana. Guarantee he will take as much as you can give him. Sure it won‚Äôt have the same effect, but it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù and that‚Äôs the ultimate pursuit. Sad... #AW https://t.co/jeo6pvvenF
Collectively we must RESIST! That means attacking casual drug use! It‚Äôs not by accident that while marijuana use is rising, so are opioid abuses. The two are related!! Society can‚Äôt hate one and turn a blind, profit-driven eye toward another. #AW #opioids https://t.co/MCUG7ZVyJZ
CDC reports 72K died from opioid-based overdoses last year. That‚Äôs incredible! Words such as ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù do not do this scourge justice. There are so many roots under the surface that pull these addicts, their families, and society back into a swirl of despair. #AW #opioids

@Shermichael_: Communication is very very important. As a political strategist, you‚Äôd be surprised by how much words matter.
@Shermichael_: As it pertains to @realDonaldTrump, Democrats can attempt to name call as much as they want to, but they don‚Äôt have a cohesive message. It‚Äôs not enough to run on the fact that you ‚Äúdislike Trump.‚Äù #presidency
@Shermichael_: For the Democrats, there has to be a concern about this new notion of Democratic socialism. #democrats
@Shermichael_: More Black Republicans have to be a voice for the issues that people in the Black community are facing today. We have to be more than just a face at the table. #Republicans
@Shermichael_: I think if the other side (Dems) want to do better in the next election, they should pick a better candidate. #elections
@Shermichael_: @HillaryClinton did not have a good ground game throughout her campaign in the 2016 presidential election. #politics

Trump‚Äôs continued personnel issues are not just with Omarosa. Prayerfully this will serve as the lesson he needs. His problem is bigger than all of his wealth and power. His problem is spiritual. Until he fixes that, which disturbs him eternally, his problems will continue. #AW https://t.co/pjx5vOTZLm

It reflects his leadership and trust in the White House and none of this behavior will change unless the president changes. It is the culture and environment he has created and only he can restore trust, loyalty, and respect. #AW https://t.co/eLuDxOkjgA
Today, New York Times reporter, Maggie Haberman, who has interviewed the president several times in the oval office since his presidency, stated on Twitter that there are others in the White House recording the president. #AW
It's a systematic problem that Donald Trump has had through much of his career and presidency, the fact that he expects complete loyalty from those around him, but doesn't always give the same unconditional loyalty in return. #AW https://t.co/QykkyeFML3
However, when you consider their change of heart and why they have suddenly changed on someone, they've known so long, it becomes clear, they don't view President Trump as being loyal to them. #AW https://t.co/bYfjgJKN4d
Unlike Bannon who only knew President Trump as a candidate, Cohen and Omarosa have a long-standing relationship with the president, which makes their change of heart all the more damning. #AW https://t.co/Shoum00vV8

The political and economic elites can fly over in their fancy jets and land safely on the coasts, avoiding the hollowed-out shells of once-strong manufacturing towns, and the declining fortunes of once-proud American workers. #AW
American souls are being strained. No one wants to be unkind to his or her neighbor, but the neighbor is often the only person accessible when frustrations reach a boiling point. #AW
The fractured relationship between America‚Äôs political and business leadership and the American people, particularly the American middle class worker, is what is driving the extreme polarization we are seeing in American politics and popular culture. #AW

Trade policy is one tool @POTUS is using, and with good results! I applaud that. #AW https://t.co/3TxSSFudvi
Our Creator clearly bestowed on this nation great mercies and gifts. Great leaders know how to leverage those gifts that are the envy of the world to push the agenda we want. Let others question that agenda. Let even ourselves question the agenda. That‚Äôs the essence of democracy! https://t.co/o5NLlBmp5j
I‚Äôve long thought our leaders have set aside a major weapon in our arsenal of diplomacy in seeking our national interests. That is intimidation, not bullying. It‚Äôs the threat of withholding our great consumers, purchasing power, military, science, medicine, you name it. #AW https://t.co/vgLwUrN4Kj
Trade War:	Trump: 1	EU: 0		Yesterday was a win with the truce. Euros blinked. @POTUS is using the full weight of American economic superpower to our advantage and the result is a win for America. #AW

We have as much in common with that nation state as we do perhaps with Iran or Syria. This does not serve America‚Äôs interests well. It‚Äôs time to send a clear message to Putin that election meddling won't be tolerated. #AW https://t.co/1nwMzOJNiq

This is the current trajectory of the Democratic Party. If Democrats aren't careful, they're setting themselves up for failure. #AW https://t.co/JA3beJGSBq
Their move to the far left continues to isolate many Americans. Just look at the recent win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example. @Ocasio2018 has proven to be uninformed on many issues, which was overwhelmingly evident by her recent statements on Israel/Palestine. #AW https://t.co/PRqPO8jt8L

RT @VanHipp: ‚ÄúEvery Saint has a past, and every sinner has a future!‚Äù‚ÄîArmstrong Williams @Arightside #SundayMorning
@chrispapst: 		There are 39 high schools in Baltimore City. Thirteen of them have students who aren‚Äôt proficient in math testing. #education
@chrispapst:		The focus is not on the kids. The focus is on data and numbers. That‚Äôs the issue. #education
@chrispapst:		Students are causing problems in the classroom because teachers are no longer disciplining them. Just look at the suspension rate and how it‚Äôs dropped.
@chrispapst:		The numbers are being manipulated. #education
@chrispapst: 		In Baltimore, we talked to teachers, parents and students. The main concern they have in the classroom now is the lack of discipline.
RT @VanHipp: @Arightside Education is a national security issue!
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey:		Often times we are focused way too much on the data. #education
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey:		South Carolina teachers and administrators are extremely frustrated just like those in the Baltimore City school sector.
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey:		It‚Äôs important to understand and know what to do with the numbers and data. What is the data telling us about what we need to do with particular students? #education
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey:		There has to be accountability on both sides...the student and the parents.
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey:		In today‚Äôs world, in preparing students for the future, our students are really the ones driving the curriculums.
Dr. Matrell Eaddy-Sturkey, Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, Florence School District One:		We‚Äôre preparing students for jobs that don‚Äôt even exist right now. We have to keep that in mind when it comes to the educational system.
Eric M. Favor:		Why is it that a doctor can make $100,000 because he or she can save a life, but teachers who have the capability of changing a life can‚Äôt get paid well?
@devon_bianca:		In Baltimore, it seems to me that the reason administrators are so critical about the numbers/data is because they want to continue to get paid. ‚ÄúIf we mess with the numbers, I‚Äôll still have my cushy job.‚Äù
#AW:		What do you all think about providing students with incentives if they perform well in the classroom?
#AW:		Everything starts with education. It‚Äôs a person‚Äôs passport.
Here‚Äôs a brief #recap from Segments 4/5 of The Armstrong Williams Show! Topic: Why Education Remains Unequal?
#AW: 		How long do you think this economic boom will last and how can people take advantage of it?
David Anderson:		It‚Äôs a struggle for small businesses located in small towns.
David Anderson:		We started Anderson Brothers Bank in 1933. We serve the whole community...five counties. Today, community banks are mainly serving the business sector.
David Anderson, President and CEO of Anderson Brothers Bank:		Anderson Brothers Bank gives loans that other banks don‚Äôt.
Eric M. Favor:		You have to provide more tax breaks for small businesses so that they can provide healthcare to their employees. https://t.co/fRAOA8ZIq2
@devon_bianca:		Has the small business environment improved under the Trump administration?
Eric M. Favor:		As someone in the small business sector like myself, I feel that today everyone wants to go to a one-stop shop. Everything seems to be moving away from the small business sector.
Eric M. Favor:		The parents here in South Carolina want what‚Äôs best for their children. They want to see them in a good learning environment.
Eric M. Favor:		I don‚Äôt think today‚Äôs schools diversify enough. Schools need to cater more to the individual student. Teach them based on who they are instead of who you want them to be.
Here‚Äôs a brief #recap from Segments 2/3 of The Armstrong Williams Show! Topic: The Role of Business in the Community
#AW: If Republicans were in the minority right now, would they be doing the same thing that the Democrats are doing today?
Dave Priest: I would rather see nine justices on the bench that have no political elegance whatsoever.
Susan C. McGill: I think people should go back to some of the research that Kavanaugh conducted as a law student and the work he‚Äôs done since then. The results have been a lot different from what the media has told us. In these hearings, we don‚Äôt want anymore mental gymnastics.
Susan C. McGill, Assistance Solicitor for 12th Circuit, Florence County:	This Supreme Court pick was very important. We wanted someone who was going to follow the law and be fair and impartial. We want him to uphold the constitution. #BrettKavanaugh

An agreement means nothing if it's not equally executed and right now, our agreement with NATO benefits other nations far more than it does the United States. #AW https://t.co/jIIDGmXhO6
We can certainly debate President Trump's approach, but the underlying premise of his argument is a legitimate one that former presidents have made going all the way back to the 60's. #AW https://t.co/50QILV3Uij
If the U.S. is going to be in an alliance with other world nations and agree to pay a certain percentage of their GDP, that agreement should be equitable. #AW https://t.co/dgIix37GtP
While #NATO meetings got off to a rough start yesterday, it would appear after watching and listening to @POTUS‚Äô remarks this morning that he and our NATO allies have found common ground. #AW https://t.co/IGd2hvLsXG
One would be remiss in not acknowledging that over the years, there have been some real political controversies regarding certain judicial appointments, namely that of imposing political litmus tests over various political questions including civil rights and abortion rights. #AW https://t.co/8pRFPl0PCX
At one time, the advice and consent function of the Senate was largely perfunctory, concerning itself largely with ensuring the professional fitness and moral character of the nominees. Over the past few decades, however, the appointment process has become overly politicized. #AW https://t.co/ln3nGFEg10
Over 600 judges currently sit on US. District courts, nearly 200 at the appellate level, and nine who make up the U.S. Supreme Court. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have generally enjoyed wide latitude in their choices of nominations for the federal judiciary. #AW https://t.co/e1H1u3Hh4T
The U.S. Constitution grants the sole responsibility of nominating federal judges to the president. The process concludes with the ‚Äòadvice and consent‚Äô of the U.S. Senate. #AW https://t.co/yxMzyM2NKl
Judge Kavanaugh will serve the Court and the country well in his new role. A strict constructionist is what @realDonaldTrump needed and wanted. Kavanaugh meets that standard. All throughout this process, the POTUS knew what he wanted. That‚Äôs undeniable. #AW https://t.co/kFIUeff6me
I predict @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs SCOTUS pick will be Judge Barrett. She has the acumen and jurisprudence to serve the Court well and her confirmation process that would go more smoothly than her male competitors. Finally, picking a female will send an historic message of inclusion.
In the future, the tides will change and Dems will find themselves in the majority with Repubs in the minority and the fight will continue, but to mislead millions of ppl with false hope and promise only exacerbates the political differences that exist in our country. #AW https://t.co/rL9uXMPMHa
This is not a new phenomenon and is the result of every election, yet Democrats are acting as if Armageddon is quickly approaching. #AW https://t.co/yOViGDeRLj
Elections have consequences and the result of the 2016 election was a Republican president who has a mandate to govern in a manner consistent with conservative principles. #AW https://t.co/6RnvY5fAXS
The facts are simple, @POTUS, like every other president before him and those who will come after him, has a right as guaranteed by the constitution to nominate a justice to the high court when there is a vacancy. #AW https://t.co/mrUGXttxUi
Democrats have formulated fundraising emails behind and multimillion-dollar commercials to gin up their supporters with false hope. #AW https://t.co/oKFnmsmJib

@SpartanShelby: #Kanye spoke and made people have a conversation. #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap
@SpartanShelby: I think #Kanye was speaking his truth. I think he meant what he said. #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap
@kevcirilli: What #Kanye said was stupid. It was a dumb comment. #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap
What was your initial reaction when you heard #Kanye say that 400 years of slavery sounded like a choice? #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap
How about the role #FreedomOfSpeech plays in this equation? Let‚Äôs take #KanyeWest, for example. Are we overly criminalizing people‚Äôs right to freedom of speech? #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap

Bullying and social media can bruise a young person‚Äôs psyche. Are these things leading to random acts of violence like mass shootings? #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap
What role does the media and video games play in this issue? Are they contributing to the violence we see among young people today? #TownHall #TippingPoint #Recap

Caller: #AW, my prayers will be with you as you embark on new endeavors. May God be with you.
Caller: #AW, you‚Äôre a uniter. You have united us from both sides of the aisle. Thank you for shining your light.
@TheNormanLear just called into the show to wish me nothing but the best moving forward. He‚Äôs been such a blessing and a great friend.
@TheNormanLear: Live in the moment. When something is ‚Äúover,‚Äù it‚Äôs over, and we are all onto ‚Äúnext.‚Äù
@TheNormanLear, you‚Äôre a hero in my eyes and you‚Äôre someone I consider to be a strong friend.
It‚Äôs such a blessing to have @TheNormanLear on my show tonight! Many ages ago, I had the rare opportunity to contribute to some of Norman‚Äôs sitcoms from a writers perspective. #AW
Let your life, words and actions count for something. #AW
Caller: Not a lot of radio hosts rethink their perspective, but you have. Listening to your show, I made a decision to listen whether I agreed or not. It‚Äôs because of your show that I started a growth plan.
Caller: #AW, you have so much love in your heart. You‚Äôre a genuine person. I wish you well.
Caller: #AW, I have truly enjoyed your show because of your perspective, your heart and your positive outlook on life.
Caller: #AW, I‚Äôm so thankful to have seen you grow and become who you are today.
I‚Äôm a reflection of my lovely parents. You all aren‚Äôt just honoring me with your kind words tonight, but you‚Äôre honoring my parents and I appreciate you all for that. Your words are a tribute to my parents. #AW
Caller: #AW, you‚Äôre making a whole nation of people grow. At some point, I fell in love with your soul. You‚Äôre a very smart man.
Caller: #AW, you are definitely a mighty man of valor and I know the Lord is with you.
@AttorneyCrump, my brother, thank you for what you do. You‚Äôre a beacon of light for the people. You‚Äôre a blessing. Thanks for calling into the show tonight! Looking forward to catching up with you in person in the near future my brother. #AW
@AttorneyCrump: #AW, continue opening the door for the next generation of young brothers.
@AttorneyCrump: #AW, you‚Äôve always been very charitable with your experiences.
@AttorneyCrump: I remember when you and @rolandsmartin spoke on the airwaves for an hour about the positive black men around the world.
On this show, it wasn‚Äôt about me being a conservative. What matters is we all must get to a higher truth in order to grow and better this country for years to come. #AW
@AttorneyCrump: My heart is a little heavy my brother. It‚Äôs the end of an era. I can‚Äôt believe we won‚Äôt be able to tune into the radio and hear you talk about the issues.
@AttorneyCrump is joining the show at the top of the second hour! Tune into @SXMUrbanView 126 for our live finale!

Zane: I honestly don't care if #SarahSanders' feelings were hurt or that she wasn't served a meal. What I care about right now are these #ImmigrantChidren and where their next meal is coming from.
People like #SarahSanders are in a war within themselves. She and others are trying to honor their boss while also maintaining their character. #AW
Caller: This administration has taught us a lot about entitlement.
Caller: This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. https://t.co/NdYRUOKOYU

Tune into @SXMUrbanView 126 for the final segments of the #AWShow! Topic: #SarahHuckabeeSanders
We keep hearing people reference the rule of law when it comes to this #Immigration issue, but maybe that's the problem. Should zero tolerance be the policy in the first place? #AWShow
Zane: These kids will be traumatized for life. This is something that they will never get over. #ImmigrantChidren
@Prasmichel: There's a better way of dealing with this issue, but something needs to be done about the influx of illegal immigrants in this country.
Zane: This zero tolerance #Immigration policy was not in place before #Trump became our president. There's no refuting that.
Zane: Now I'm hearing that some of these #ImmigrantChildren may never be united with their parents. It makes me angry.
Caller: However, I didn't see #Trump put out even one tweet about the two black men who were kicked out of Starbucks. https://t.co/GPcWRsXy3G
Caller: In this situation, the Virginia restaurant is dead wrong and #SarahSanders has a right to sue.
@Prasmichel: If she wasn't disturbing the peace, that owner had no right to kick #SarahSanders out of their establishment. That's a fact.
@PrasMichel is talking about a platform that he‚Äôs developing that will help give people more of a voice...wants blacks to display more economic growth.
It‚Äôs important to know when it‚Äôs time to just let go of something and move on. #AW
We have an All-Star cast tonight! Zane (author) has just joined @PrasMichel and I on the air! Tune in for the second hour of the show. @SXMUrbanView 126

@Prasmichel: Had a liberal been kicked out of that restaurant, there would have been a media storm. Everyone is entitled to have their own opinion. That's what's great about this country.

The #tax system should make ppl less dependent on the gov., not more dependent. I should know how my taxes are being used. That‚Äôs fair tax.

Caller: When the national anthem was first written, it included a reference to slavery. No one talks about that though. #NFL
Caller: #NFL players who sit or kneel during the national anthem, not out of disrespect for the military, should be viewed as courageous and they should be admired.
Caller: In regard to the cake's requested design, I believe the same-sex couple simply wanted two males on their wedding cake.
Is anyone forfeiting their #NFL season tickets or the NFL in general due to its new national anthem policy? #AWShow

If you went to a bakery and the owner said he or she didn't want to serve you, would you really still want a cake from that bakery? Wouldn't you want to take your business elsewhere immediately? #AWShow
Caller: I wish they would just go ahead and create a ruling that doesn't force a business to serve someone if it doesn't want to. That would be true freedom.
I can't believe the mainstream media is saying that this was a narrow decision! It was a 7-2 ruling. #AW #SupremeCourt #MasterpieceCakeshop

Caller: As ignorant as it is to refuse to serve someone, as a private business owner, the #Coloradobaker had every right to deny service.
Given the Supreme Court's 7-2 ruling in the Masterpiece Cake case, is it safe to say that we're on a slippery slope right now in this country? #AWShow #MasterpieceCakeshop

"The court held that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission showed hostility toward the baker based on his religious beliefs." @CNN
Caller: The same-sex couple was trying to force their opinion on the #Coloradobaker.
Caller: The #Coloradobaker has a right to do what he wants to do. My problem with it is he‚Äôs using religion as his reason.

Science might even play a role in many millennials not fully understanding the concept of religion today.
Why do some young ppl refer to themselves as ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù without identifying with a specific religion?

Dr. Bernard: Parents, control the guns in your home. Don‚Äôt allow a 17-year-old to have access to your guns.
Caller: These young white guys don‚Äôt have mental issues. They know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm tired of hearing that excuse. #TXShooting
Caller: Some of these parents should be held accountable. I have the type of household where I don‚Äôt let my son close his door.
Caller: This is what this country built its society to be. If we can‚Äôt resolve problems with other countries by talking, we start killing.
Dr. Bernard: This is human behavior, but it‚Äôs on steroids at this point. #TexasSchoolShooting
Have we failed our young ppl? Has this country ‚Äúalways‚Äù been about violence first? https://t.co/z8Rs0YgXvV
My last caller blamed the older generation for the violence we‚Äôre seeing among young people today. Does he have a point?
Call in at 866-801-8255 to discuss the #TexasSchoolShooting with me and my panel. Why does this continue to plague our country?
Eli: Students came up with something called #TheWalkUp to encourage kids to engage with those who are quiet, who keep to themselves.
Eli Williams (did a docu on the #ParklandShooting): There were journals found in this boy‚Äôs home that alluded to him wanting to do this...
https://t.co/Gc00tMkuJH
Dr. Bernard: We give way too much airtime to these shooters. #TexasShooter
Dr. Bernard: Today, attention is fragmented and very short. Boredom comes quickly. #TexasSchoolShooting
Dr. Bernard: We‚Äôre seeing more of these types of reactive displays of anger. We‚Äôre not teaching kids how to regulate their mood. #TXShooting
RT @Theothethinker: @Arightside Why are mass shooters overwhelmingly white males?
Dr. Bernard: There‚Äôs going to have to be some adjusting to this new reality. #TexasSchoolShooting
You listen to the president say he‚Äôs going to put a stop to these senseless acts of violence, and it‚Äôs hard to believe that at this point.
Have we reached a point where it‚Äôs almost hopeless to think that this is going to stop? #MassShootings

Tune into @SXMUrbanView 126 for the final segment of the #AWShow! Topic: #Israel #Palestine
One thing you can't dispute is that #Israel supported South Africa at the height of #Apartheid. How do you explain that? #AWShow
Caller: #Israel created #Hamas in the early 1990s, and now Hamas has become a monster.
Tune into @SXMUrbanView 126 for the final segments of the #AWShow! Topic: #Israel #Palestine
John: #Iran has been involved in efforts to kill #Americans since 1979.
Caller: The first casualty to any situation is "truth."
Caller: The United States has been one-sided when it comes to #Israel.
John: Their secrecy is one of their greatest components. #Israel
But they've shown restraint. Many don't believe #Israel would go to those lengths. https://t.co/wDnXkc6gmt
There's no question on whether or not #Israel has nuclear weapons. They most certainly do.
If something doesn't match the talking points that the #MainStreamMedia wants to follow, are you of the belief that they completely abandon the story? #AWShow
Caller: We give #Israel $43 billion a year.
John: The #Trump administration does have a very strong #ForeignPolicy team.
Caller: Why do we support these countries and pump them up, but then turn around and demonize them?
Tune into @SXMUrbanView 126 for the second hour of the #AWShow! John Keys is still on the air with me. Topic: Why some Americans are in support of #Israel amid their conflict with #Palestine.
Caller: #America committed two #Holocausts.
Caller: We have no idea how the next president is going to handle this situation. #Israel #Palestine
#Israel is very vital to the United States and the rest of the world.
#Israel was like a stepchild to the United States for sometime.
#Israel is the only democracy in the #MiddleEast and they're a crucial piece to keeping things stable in that region. That's why they're getting the support of Americans. #AWShow
Caller: Why fire if you know there are babies, women and children at the #GazaStrip?
There were eight people -- armed and dangerous -- that came over the fence. People seem to be forgetting that. #Israel #GazaStrip

John: "Finally, you have a president who does what he says he's going to do." That's the narrative across the region now. #Trump #EmbassyMove
Caller: When do we get tired of the death on both sides? #Israel #Palestine
John: They‚Äôre not just throwing rocks, despite what the media is portraying. There is gunfire out there as well. #Israel #Gaza
How could the media undermine #Israel like this?
To many of our listeners, #Israel can do no right and #Hamas can do no wrong. Let‚Äôs go to the phone lines. Call in at 866-801-8255.

Tune in to @SXMUrbanView 126 for the final segment of the #AWShow! Topic: #Trump and #Hillary
Caller: I think #Trump has an ethics problem and an integrity problem. When I think about policy and stability, #Hillary was the better fit.
Caller: #Trump won because of the electoral college. If this was #France, #HillaryClinton would be our current president.
Tune in to @SXMUrbanView 126 for the final segments of the #AWShow! Topics: #Trump, #Hillary, #BlackWomen
Caller: We all have different experiences, but we shouldn‚Äôt think that our experience represents the overall experience.
Caller: I voted for #HillaryClinton because of her experience and due to the fact that her husband did a good job in the Oval Office.
Is it abnormal for a woman to make a voting decision based on who her husband supports politically? #AWShow

Join us for the second hour of the #AWShow on @SXMUrbanView 126! Topic: #Trump and #Hillary
Thanks @SalenaZito and @BradOnMessage for joining the show tonight to discuss your book, #TheGreatRevolt! Great conversation.
@BradOnMessage: His voters expected him to have an impact in #foreignpolicy. ‚ÄúMake our own decisions and challenge our allies to follow us.‚Äù
@BradOnMessage: #Trump expressed his interest in running as a third party in last year‚Äôs election. He even missed two #Republican debates.
@BradOnMessage: We have several archetypes of #Trump voters in the book. #TheGreatRevolt
What about this narrative that #Trump wouldn‚Äôt be president today if it weren‚Äôt for #Obama‚Äôs eight years? #AWShow
Caller: #Trump damn near gets away with murder.
@BradOnMessage says the electoral college system didn't just benefit #Trump. It benefitted #HillaryClinton as well.

We're going to the phone lines to discuss #TheGreatRevolt with our listeners! Call in at 866-801-8255.
Brad: We discovered that many #Trump voters were reluctant to share their vote with people who were close to them.
@SalenaZito: I don't think people have changed their morals at all. I don't see a difference in people across the board. We've discovered that these voters decided that they were going to make a pragmatic choice when voting for #Trump. #TheGreatRevolt
Brad: Has #Trump created something entirely new or is he just the latest flavor among #Republicans? That's a question we asked ourselves while writing this book. #TheGreatRevolt
I‚Äôm live on SiriusXM Urban View 126 for a special edition of The Armstrong Williams Show and I‚Äôm joined by authors Salena Zito and Brad Todd discussing their book, #TheGreatRevolt. Tune in!
Brad Todd: Do you believe every #American should have a right to self-defense and should be able to choose a firearm to keep at their home? That's a question we explored in the book. #TheGreatRevolt
@SalenaZito: If you're a businessman or businesswoman, you should read #TheGreatRevolt.
@SalenaZito: If you're a #Republican and you were surprised that #Trump won the presidency and you'd like to know what to look for moving forward, you should read #TheGreatRevolt.
@SalenaZito: If you are a #Democrat and you don't understand what happened with the last presidential election, you should definitely read #TheGreatRevolt.

Pastor Bill: The #Bible does just the opposite. It condemns #slavery. https://t.co/DSDtBMBMIg
