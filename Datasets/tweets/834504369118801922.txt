@Bodog99208870 @AriMEden @Newsweek Unfortunately I don't have the skill to paint a favorable portrait of anyone. But making a cake isn't necessarily making art any more than painting a wall in your house is. Sure, it might be if that's what they request, but it isn't necessarily. Can house painters deny service?
@Bodog99208870 @AriMEden @Newsweek I don't think they were trying to have the wedding on the spot. When I got married we didn't buy a cake and hold onto it.

@SeaChief9 @Cynic2TheEnd @alteredimaging @ABC Are you complaining about the public reaction or journos covering it. A famous person claimed they were assaulted and had a chemical poured on them. Pretty much any publication will cover that.

@Newsweek The article cites reading books. Somehow I don't suspect reading Twitter is a benefit to our mental health.
@Cynic2TheEnd @alteredimaging @ABC Jumping to someone's defense who claimed they were assaulted is the right and normal thing to do. In the rare and bizarre instance that they fabricated it, the truth will come out and they'll face the consequences.
@Bodog99208870 @AriMEden @Newsweek They never got to the point of discussing the content of the cake. The baker flat out refused to make *any* cake for them simply because they were gay. For all the baker knew they would have ordered a generic cake that had no content he'd object to.
@AriMEden @Newsweek Was referring to bakers denying service to gay customers.
@Newsweek They can't even keep themselves from lying about small things.
@thehill It's almost as if people think Trump would interfere with something going on in the DOJ. Now where would they get that idea...

@grandmoogus @tackettdc @hillhulse It is a pool of money that exists already to be used in cases of emergency only. Congress had previously authorized the President to have wide discretion as to what qualifies as an emergency expecting that the President would not abuse it. Trump has constantly pushed these lines.
@Jackouteeee @tackettdc @maggieNYT @hillhulse Democrats general do not want open borders. Non-citizens can't vote. Our country is set up in a way where we will always have at least 2 major parties.		Any changes to the Constitution need to be ratified by 75% of the states to go into effect. You're peddling conspiracies.
@grandmoogus @tackettdc @hillhulse No an EO is a directive telling the executive branch what to do or how to go about doing something with its current funding.		Declaring a National Emergency allows the executive branch to tap into another pool of money that has been set aside for disasters and actual emergencies.

You'll have to excuse my initial panic at Trump saying "crusade".
@AdamParkhomenko no later than later tonight*
The "unity" narrative lasted all of 6 hours, surprising no one.		 https://t.co/VAmmY2ad2D
@staceyabrams @XavierBecerra May you be protected from the trickster god of Just Out of Reach Water Bottles.
RT @Laurie_Garrett: This @CDCgov #vaccine chart is the best proof that #VaccinesWork . In orange are the dates that vaccines for the given…
@ForecasterEnten Isn't the old saying that "Democrats fall in love. Republicans fall in line?" Trump is so bad that Democrats are finally falling in line.
@InternetHippo Heineken: Seize the night, and the means of production.
@thehill The only way this is true is if she's sitting there dissuading her father from doing some absolutely abhorrent stuff.
@Reuters It would be great if they made a significant investment in people and stopped fighting unions everywhere.
@WSJ I can't wait to see how this "plan" works out the first time an inflammatory comment pops up into his head.
@thehill "The party of principles"
@Reuters Good to know that machines weren't hacked, but I'm still hearing the lies peddled by Russian bots 3 years ago.
Guy who lost election says it's because Indian immigrants voted illegally. This is a serious accusation and I'm sure he would only make it if he could back it up. Okay let's hear it. Lay out the evidence.		"... You just kind of know; well, you know"		https://t.co/SVcVcIR0dA
I'm half expecting Trump to make some awful comment about Nancy Pelosi tonight and smirking knowing she has too much tact to break decorum.
@GOPLeader Republicans: "Faceless corporations that cannot be effectively held accountable should have more control over your life."
@thehill This is the same kind of bizarre buzz phrase word association that gave us "You have been fighting ISIS you're entire adult life" directed at a woman pushing 70.
@rendale @thehill Democrats think both should resign. Republicans think anything that makes a Democrat look bad is good.
@thehill There is absolutely nothing that Saudi Arabia could do that make this admin think twice about letting rich people get richer selling weapons to them.
@tpietrykoski @CoryBooker Enjoy the corndogs.
@thehill "I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit, and it will be released. As soon as the audit's finished, it will be released," he said.
@ChasingNews @BillSpadea @PABrownJr There are lots of opinions to be had on the Boy Scouts welcoming girls and what that means for the Girl Scouts, but that it's bad for girls to do "boy stuff" is absolutely the worst one.
@thehill Fairness and respect for the legal system take a back seat to padding conviction percentages.
@InternetHippo "Get your government hands off my Medicare."
@HerbMckinney @washingtonpost They literally linked to the poll data, so by any objective measure, their claim is more credible than yours.
@washingtonpost Some progressive person please put on camo and run as a Republican. I need to see how this plays out.
RT @AOC: 👀 https://t.co/TG7hfLxNEv
@politico Best wishes to him in his job search.
@voxdotcom "We don't like fire," say people who have been stoking fire for years.
@WSJ Trump's speechwriters are expected to issue a plea for national unity, which Trump will then immediately contradict with inflammatory ad-libs*
@joshgreenman I'll be shocked if this doesn't end up being advertised on right-wing radio shows.
@thehill @TheHillOpinion Top-notch fan fic about the political landscape Trump is facing.
@davecatanese @daveweigel If nothing else it helps to show the media's bias towards pomp and circumstance over substance. How many hot takes about how Trump "looked Presidential" have we seen because he managed to not soil himself on live TV for 45 minutes?
@politico If it's not clear to anyone at this point that Trump was lying when he originally said he planned to release them then you're lying to yourself.
@nytimes If only there were some sort of easily accessible document that said in plain language that the President isn't allowed to accept gifts from foreign leaders.
@thehill "People don't know what Trump's doing" is basically the norm.

@BeschlossDC Even 64 years ago people screwed up forms that tried to prefill part of the year in the date field.
After 2016 Republicans suddenly started thinking racism was less of a problem in the US, while Democrats became significantly more likely to think it's a problem. It's almost as if the two groups have a different understanding of what exactly the problem is. https://t.co/Sw2Un0uoGc
So if you're sitting there thinking "why should they be getting $15/hr when I only make .$X?" what you should be thinking is "why am I only making .$X?"
$15/hour is $31,200 per year with a full-time job. If there are 2 adults working full-time that gets you up to $61,400 per year, but that's still over *$26,000* short of what's needed for a comfortable life in NJ. Even more if you want to maybe not work until you die.
But even in the cheapest county, Camden County, a family needs $87,509 per year to live comfortably. By the way, these numbers don't include paying down student loans or saving for retirement.
Last year the Economic Policy Institute put out a report on how much it costs to live in different parts of the country. In NJ, the most expensive county is Hunterdon County where a family of 4 needs $111,459/year to live comfortably.		https://t.co/gLUfOBAkN9
Murphy signed the bill to increase the minimum wage up to $15/hour (by 2024). If anyone in NJ is still thinking to themselves that that is a lot of money, consider this:		https://t.co/a0UD6BOfoU
