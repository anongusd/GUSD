#SecDef Mattis on coming Trump-Kim summit: "We're all cautiously optimistic that we may be on the right path for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
Shortly after the tweet above, @90thMissileWing sent email reply to query asked hours earlier: Yes, the two people treated for smoke inhalation were missileers, and yes, the problem was in the equipment room next to launch control center.
Haven't heard back from @90thMissileWing but apparently the two people treated for smoke inhalation at a Scottsbluff hospital were, indeed, the two officers (missileers) commanding the underground launch control center.
Asked today whether the two airmen treated at hospital for smoke inhalation were the missile launch control officers, the 90th MW public affairs responded, "We'll get back to you."
At Pentagon, #SecDef Mattis says, re evidence of Syrian gas attack, "We're still assessing the intelligence, ourselves and our allies. We're still working on this."
