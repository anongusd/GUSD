@historBilia @eugenegu You're right, I don't understand. Not because I'm not a woman, but I don't understand because I've never been assaulted. Men also get assaulted and never speak about or report the assault. Please forgive me if I said anything that upset you pertaining to your situation.
@historBilia @eugenegu Okay...I'm sorry to hear what happened to you. I'm not trying to "pity" you. I just don't agree that it is okay that women don't report men who assault them (immediately) because it places other women in danger. Sorry for saying you sound stupid. You're right, I don't understand.
@historBilia @eugenegu If you accept that as being okay you also accept men being male chauvinist because that's just the way men are and you don't understand men because "you're not a man"! It doesn't make sense and it doesn't make it right!
