GOP wanted to spin the #CohenHearing into a Democratic ploy to #ImpeachTrump, despite the fact that Pelosi and other leaders have repeatedly said impeachment isn't their route of action at this point.

#SteveKing is a racist. The punishment is too light and too late, but he deserves it. HOWEVER, King hasn't said anything worse than what @realDonaldTrump has said. It's time for the GOP to step up and recognize it.
The #Census is not meant to be an arm of #BorderSecurity or #ICE. It's meant to count people. The courts are right.
Summing it up: I think #Barr said all of the "right things" to be confirmed. But, I don't believe him. I don't trust anyone who would take a job from Donald Trump.

GOP, here's your leader! Someone who calls people out BY NAME if they disagree in the slightest with him, and then mocking them for not taking his "embrace." This is who represents you.
Whitaker and Trump will try to end the #MuellerInvestigation as fast as they possibly can. Mueller should work triple time to release his report ASAP.

How many times has Trump gone after African American women? His sexist, racist behavior continued today when he attacked @AprilDRyan. Then he has the gall to call another question racist? Does he know the definition of racist? Clearly not.
Trump's performance at today's news conference was disgraceful. Started with lame ass excuses as to why the GOP didn't do better, and also tried to spin yesterday's results as "total victory. " Then, he said it was a good thing the GOP lost the House. Um, YOU LOST THE HOUSE.
If @LindseyGrahamSC wants to be the next #AttorneyGeneral, he's gonna need some friends across the aisle. After this election and the #Kavanaugh confirmation, Graham doesn't have any friends left.
Sessions was fired. Trump can try to spin it as a "resignation," but we all know the truth. Trump is running scared after #ElectionResults2018

As someone who grew up during segregation, let me tell you this: #DeSantisIsARacist. "Monkey it up" is NOT a real phrase. I heard the word "monkey" REPEATEDLY growing up. If someone didn't use the N word, they used the term "monkey." It's racist. Full stop.
Trump told #Evangelical leaders (while AT the @WhiteHouse, no less): your job is to get your flock to vote; use the pulpit to preach politics. If that doesn't violate separation of Church and State, I don't know what does.

You know what? @SenJohnMcCain as a POW was tortured, and he said he would NOT vote for #GinaHaspel, who oversaw the torture of human beings. If that's not enough for Democrats to disavow her confirmation, then what is? We're here because of Dems. - @peterogburn
These cowardly Democrats will enable a torturer to lead the CIA. @MarkWarner just rolled over. I don't get it. #GinaHaspel is a TORTURER. She tortured human beings. She destroyed the evidence. She hasn't apologized. It's disgusting. Shame.

#DarrellIssa is one of the most odious, despicable members of Congress. Good riddance. 29 Republican seats now up for grabs. 20+ seats are in places Clinton carried in 2016. This opens the door for Dems, who may be able to take back the House in 2018.
#JaredKushner in charge of #prisonreform is just rich. It's perfect because his daddy was in jail, his daddy-in-law is about to go to jail, and Kushner will probably be headed to prison soon.

I LOVE #Oprah. But, I think the White House is very serious. Democrats can do better than our own television star candidate.
I'd like to think that the presidency is a little more important than 2 TV stars pitted against each other if #Oprah2020 becomes a reality. We know very little of Oprah's political leanings + her depth of policy knowledge.
