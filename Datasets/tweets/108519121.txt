@Cshustle1 @elliothoncho For better or worse, I’m only a senator for another week. We have term limits here and I leave office on 12/31/18.
@elliothoncho @Cshustle1 I’m not a lawyer, but court reform will likely begins w/ state legislatures getting involved. Judges want discretion, so it will be a difficult fight I’m guessing. Chief Justice of the state Supreme Court can weigh in on things &amp; may be able to issue directives to courts.

@ufcsonnenfan @lbischoff This bill does not address enforcement efforts or penalties for noncompliance.
@ufcsonnenfan @lbischoff That is my understanding, yes.
@ufcsonnenfan @lbischoff Not automatically, no. If your order is over 3 years old you may be able to have it reviewed, but that depends on your individual case. Local child support enforcement should be able to answer questions.
@ufcsonnenfan @lbischoff Whoever has the jurisdiction over your case should be able to give you answers specific to your case.
@ufcsonnenfan @lbischoff The bill isn’t retroactive, so nothing will happen automatically. There are rules about when you can have your order revisited. Those won’t change. So when this bill passes the House &amp; if you qualify for a review your order can be looked at.

@jimmsans if the chancellor wants to spend some already appropriated $ on this program he can. His dept is not getting any extra $ though.
@jimmsans Look for an "as passed" or "as amended" version. Not an "as introduced".
