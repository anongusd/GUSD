16/ Read the full story by @kimondegreef for @FERNnews and @natgeo and learn more about sea cucumbers https://t.co/foBINWsRaF
15/ Yet the illegal fishing goes on. https://t.co/lEoTFeAIp8
14/ Under the plan, fishing may take place only from sunrise to sunset, Diving from boats or w/ any kind of breathing apparatus is forbidden. Strict rules govern who may buy, process &amp; export catch. These regs are intended to ‚Äúensure the rational exploitation of sea cucumbers."
13/ Last year, the fisheries department established a sea cucumber management plan that includes a trial harvesting program. The fishery is organized into five coastal regions, each with its own catch limits. The total quota came to just under 500 tons the first year.
12/ This is not a straightforward task. By 2012, when stock assessments began, sea cucumbers had already reached an advanced stage of depletion. Illegal fishing, meanwhile, has made it difficult to establish baseline data for setting quotas.
11/ Hakima Zidane, the official in charge of determining a sustainable level of sea cucumber exploitation in Morocco, has stated that they're a ‚Äúvery important commercial opportunity‚Äù and the government plans to grow the industry. ‚ÄúOur work is to promote balanced exploitation.‚Äù
10/ Scientists have listed 16 species of sea cucumbers as threatened, including those with the greatest commercial value. Another seven are listed as endangered. Of the five species of sea cucumbers identified in Morocco, three are edible and targeted by divers.
9/ The roughly 80 edible sea cucumbers are most common in tropical regions, often in the vicinity of poor communities such as Moulay Abdallah. With demand soaring in Asia, stocks are now depleted in a third of the more than 80 source countries.
8/ Stripping sea cucumbers from the oceans restricts opportunities to study them further, just as clearing rainforests destroys prospective medicinal plants.
7/ Sea cucumbers function as nutrient factories, rich in protein and complex organic compounds. They have ‚Äúa primordial ecological role,‚Äù said Hakima Zidane, a marine biologist at the National Fisheries Research Institute. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like a purifying species for the ocean.‚Äù
6/ Many sea cucumbers can slacken their body walls, allowing them to ‚Äúpour‚Äù through narrow spaces or explosively self-eviscerate‚Äîa defense mechanism against predators‚Äîbefore regrowing their internal organs in a process scientists have studied for use in regenerative medicine.
5/ Sea cucumbers are an amazing species. Some can crawl around on tubular feet; others burrow into the seafloor like worms.
4/ There are some 1,700 species of sea cucumbers globally. They‚Äôre echinoderms, along with urchins and sea stars. Essentially sedentary, the animals are easy to collect, particularly in shallow water. This leaves them vulnerable to overfishing for the black market.
3/ Despite the risks, smuggling continues. For some, it means providing for their family. But for those who dive for sea cucumbers without proper gear or instruction, the hunt can be disastrous. https://t.co/5aGSQGf9Qv
2/ In Morocco, stocks have been declining quickly, so the fishing ministry banned all sea cucumber exports in 2010 and began stepping up efforts to stop the illegal trade.
1/ The sea cucumber, an increasingly rare Chinese delicacy, is being traded on the black market. They are soft, knobbly creatures that have fallen victim to a contagion of poaching that is causing devastating declines to most coastlines on Earth. https://t.co/THcbOulsVh

15/ Learn more about dicamba and read the full investigation by @lizabio for @FERNnews &amp; @reveal here: https://t.co/8J85q0voM9
14/ Bayer Crop Science, which took over Monsanto in June, said dicamba complaints have dropped dramatically in the past year because applicators now are better trained. The company declined requests for interviews.
13/ Dozens of farmers are seeking millions of dollars in compensation. But some complaints miss most of the damage. Many people don‚Äôt file complaints for fear of jeopardizing insurance claims, which typically address sprayer errors, not problems with the product itself.
12/ Dicamba disasters have spread throughout US farm communities, even costing one man his life. A 55-year-old Arkansas soybean farmer died in October 2016 after a man he confronted over dicamba drift shot him. The man is serving a 24-year sentence for second-degree murder.
11/ The Trump administration has focused on salvaging dicamba. And the EPA announced new rules for spraying in October 2017 and again last month. https://t.co/2yFVXTM4IN
10/ The EPA repeatedly sided with Monsanto over the objections of Mortensen and other university scientists, first by registering dicamba in 2016 and then by keeping it on the market.
9/ Monsanto, however, told the EPA that weed resistance to dicamba was unlikely. It had made a similar argument in the early 1990s when it petitioned regulators to approve its new Roundup-resistant soybeans. https://t.co/HjEDMOVWid
8/ After years of evidence on dicamba‚Äôs ability to drift into the air and destroy valuable plants, including the habitat of bees and other beneficial insects, Mortensen urged the EPA in 2016 not to register the weedkiller for the new uses on #GMO crops.
7/ David Mortensen, an ag ecologist at University of New Hampshire, is among the most passionate &amp; vocal critics of allowing dicamba on #GMO crops. He says that the EPA &amp; Monsanto created a worst-case scenario. ‚ÄúDicamba-resistant crops should never have been released, period.‚Äù
6/ The plague that struck the Joyce's farm was dicamba. Farmers had applied the drift-prone chemical sparingly for decades. But in the past two years, its use has grown exponentially. It's destroying crops and pitting farmer against farmer and scientists against manufacturers.
5/ What were the telltale signs? The plants‚Äô broad, flat leaves shriveled &amp; curled, their branches twisted and buckled. Then blossom rot set in. 		What did the Joyce‚Äôs do? They mowed down a bestselling crop ‚Äî for the third year in a row. https://t.co/dM7KGVFEBS
4/ Every August, the Joyce‚Äôs used to hunker down in the field beside their Missouri home, picking ripe tomatoes in the blazing sun. Customers would drive hours for the artisanal fare, grown amid fields of soybeans &amp; cotton. 		But now, there is nothing to sell. https://t.co/w2iL7kvRfn
3/ The EPA is supposed to ensure that pesticides don‚Äôt impose unreasonable environmental &amp; economic costs. But instead, farmers like Andrew &amp; his wife, Sara, dealt with a disaster.
2/ The agrochemical giant Monsanto Co. orchestrated a massive deployment of dicamba on tens of millions of acres of crops in the Midwest &amp; mid-South when it lobbied the EPA to allow it to be used on its GMO seeds for cotton &amp; soybeans. The seeds were worth $3 billion last year.
1/ The EPA ignored scientists‚Äô warnings and extensive research showing dicamba would ruin crops miles away. 		They approved the weedkiller based on the studies done by the companies that manufacture it. 		https://t.co/8J85q0voM9
