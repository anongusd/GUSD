@dylanlscott @APStylebook Just tried it. My fingers just want to hit that space bar in between health and care and can actually type it faster as two words.
Yes, I realize a GI Bill change couldn't have happened under reconciliation. But the policy parallel still exists re: educational benefits for future children.
Currently, vets can only transfer GI Bill benefits to children who've already been born. Wonder why there's been no push for this similar to 529 expansion.
Side note on this issue. Why wouldn't they try to create parity with GI bill benefits transfer, i.e., make it easier to set aside for hypothetical future children? https://t.co/MPpYpYIeu8

@JonesChrisA There's economic justification for reducing the corporate rate, but I can already see it becoming a populist fight.
@JonesChrisA The proposed cuts in the corporate and pass-thru rates make a big difference. They weren't on the table during the 2010/12 debates.
@JonesChrisA You're absolutely right. Guess I'm thinking of the 2012 world w/the fights over individual tops rates. Cap gains/divd rates mattered then.
@JonesChrisA Completely agree. Lower pass-thru rates change those parameters. Just think it's interesting given the earlier hand-wringing over cap gains.

Overheard in House Rules: "You can't buy time." Counter: Uber, Instacart, Drybar, Postmates.
@StaceyGoers The cromnibus was a legitimate thing, because it was a CR for just part of the government attached to an omnibus.
Favorite random omnibus rider so far: barring CBP from preventing individuals from bringing back personal prescription drugs from Canada.
@SylvanLane Especially if you work in the White House, you know?
@ktullymcmanus (Whispers) And it's not usually congressional staffers or reporters making this mistake.
@JSwiftTWS Just found it amusing. I happen to love trains, but especially the trains in Japan.
Surprised how many people at high levels don't seem to know the difference between a CR and an omnibus.
@JSwiftTWS Since when do you like trains?
Yep. This has been driving me nuts  for the past week. https://t.co/HwB6O90oFh

@AustinFrerick You know I have to be more diplomatic than that, but I look forward to your future thoughts on tax cuts/reform.
@paulythegun I think they give themselves reconciliation instructions to concurrently work on both, so tax work isn't slowed down by health care.
@paulythegun The next budget resolution is the milestone to watch, assuming they get around to it before Memorial Day.
@paulythegun They could get an ACA tax repeal/regulatory easing through the Senate. But it would seriously pare down what the House has tried to do.
@paulythegun If they actually cared about the policy, they‚Äôd start drafting a budget resolution that allows them to work on both health care &amp; taxes.
@DarrenWillcox1 @dylanlscott Not impossible, but I think there are still too many issues with government spending to keep them busy. That‚Äôs not even a given yet.

Should you need it (CQ subscribers), my analysis of the border supplemental &amp; DACA bills is here ($): http://t.co/TeInw0OeCV
Surprising to hear claims that DACA bill stops renewals. Text says "expand the number of aliens" and "newly authorize."
Hmm... RT @ericawerner Rep. Blackburn's comms director says the DACA bill *would* prevent people who currently have DACA from renewing.
@jsimpsonDC Agreed, that's not shocking. Just pointing out they could pull together a Plan C if absolutely necessary.
Tomorrow's rule for the supplemental/DACA includes same-day &amp; suspension authority, so they're covering their bases.
RT @jsimpsonDC: Tomorrow is a tough first day to be the new House whip team.
RT @nielslesniewski: Adopting the "motion to disagree" is kind of the legislative equivalent of a mic drop. #highwaybill
@ktullymcmanus But Sessions still didn't seem to be 100% on the question. He just said it's "silent" on the renewals issue.
Reading the Blackburn bill, it seems like it wouldn't prohibit DACA renewals. It would only prohibit DACA expansion.
Blackburn DACA bill on the House Rules site is actually shorter, more streamlined than the one she introduced last week.
Should I stream the Rules Committee border hearing even though it might crash my browser? Yes, I should.

Busy getting into the granular details of the House SGR patch, but @CQRCEmily has an excellent overview. http://t.co/MoeDHHLe0Q
Minus actual Medicare payment adjusment &amp; offsets, SGR patch contains at least 100 pages in various health care extenders.
Hmm, House SGR patch provides a 0.5% update for rest of 2014, 0% adjustment for first three months of 2015.
House posted a 9-month SGR patch last night, offset through Medicare sequester realignment &amp; Medicaid DSH adjustments.
For all you Medicare watchers, the House has suspension authority to consider an SGR bill on Thursday, plus a Ukraine bill.

Thinking the last time the House was finished this early in December was 2008, a presidential transition year.
RT @Schank_A: @ashuppy Doc fix elements are much the same, new cuts, sequester tweak in 2023, new fees system in 2016. #paylater
Indeed, per @danholler, $20.5B of budget deal offsets scored in 2022, $26.8B scored in 2023, out of $85B.
RT @danholler: 55% in 2022/2023 MT @ashuppy: Budget deal offsets: 15% federal pensions, 15% aviation fees, 9% PBGC premium increase, 8% cus‚Ä¶
Another third of the budget deal offset comes from extending mandatory sequestration for two years.
Budget deal offsets: 15% federal pensions, 15% aviation fees, 9% PBGC premium increase, 8% customs fees, 6% ed loans, 5% energy.
If you want details on every offset &amp; Medicare extension in the budget deal, here's our analysis ($): http://t.co/30wixPH56K
@LorenAdler The DSH reduction shift from FY 2014 &amp; 2015 to FY 2016? Looking forward to it.
Woo! You're the best. RT @LorenAdler CBO's score of the short-term SGR fix, gimmicks and all: http://t.co/OrnOn2drvV
Give CBO lots of credit for getting its budget deal estimate out so early. Now I just need one on the three-month SGR extension.
Notables added to actual budget text: 3-month SGR adjustment, changes to Foreign Service Pensions.
Also missing from the pension side of the deal: altered FERS formula based on highest 5 yrs salary, rather than 3 yrs.
Pension proposal is actually not as bad for federal employees as it could have been. Previous plans included 2.3%-point hike.
@johngramlich Any idea what specific program reform he's referencing?
RT @johngramlich: Part of the budget deal being announced right now involves the end of "sending checks to criminals," @RepPaulRyan says
While everyone's getting excited about the budget deal, House sked for Wed doesn't actually list it. http://t.co/N7n2hYjK86
@krenz105 @HanksOysterBar Thanks for suggesting it! Perfect for a cozy winter happy hour.
An excellent -- and free(!) -- primer on the Medicare SGR issue you'll be hearing about for awhile. http://t.co/n0XkNsWsMm
House has released its agenda for possibly last work week of 2013; "possible" SGR, budget, farm bill. http://t.co/uRFxTq8knS
RT @nielslesniewski: A year of the #docfix costs less than the expected savings from the #farmbill. Just saying ...
Might be a good idea to #ff @CQRCEmily this week for Medicare SGR news. Needs to be addressed if House is going to leave.

@AppropsDems points out Kids First Research is a $13M/yr authorization, not an appropriation. Expect interesting floor debate.
Kids First Research was a Cantor priority, put on backburner. Shifts $130M from presidential election fund to NIH pediatrics.
Next week in the House, per colloquy: Medicare SGR; possible budget agreement &amp; farm bill action. Plus Kids First Research Act.
RT @ChadPergram: Boehner on Christmas schedule: I've made it clear the House is going to leave next Friday.
@gnagesh @AlexParkerDC One of the few times I've ever driven in DC, I was sideswiped by a cab. Probably skews my perspective a bit.
@AlexParkerDC @gnagesh Having a car in DC can be useful, but wasn't necessary in Logan Circle. Could afford it, yet despise driving.
@AlexParkerDC @gnagesh Not even sure it's a matter of not affording cars. Many see it as a privilege to live where cars are unnecessary.
