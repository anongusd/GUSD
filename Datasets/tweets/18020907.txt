RT @EricSeger33: Here’s a bit of Ezekiel Elliott’s emotional interview after Saturday’s 17-14 loss to Michigan State: https://t.co/p73WzTcd…
Bucks lose.		Zeke says there's "no chance" he'll be back next year &amp; calls out coaches.		Ohio State fans be like: https://t.co/50w6a2PW8X
RT @11W: Ezekiel Elliott declares for NFL draft, questions Ohio State play-calling in emotional postgame interview. https://t.co/XhQaK2Z7x7
@Hartley191919 agree with that as well. I think he let his emotions get the best of him. Timing and delivery was bad.
RT @11W: Really strong stuff from Ezekiel Elliott right now. He's not wrong.
RT @Landgrant33: Ezekiel Elliott just torched the Ohio State playcalling after the frustrating loss to Michigan State: https://t.co/pZ0E8jV…
@Hartley191919 agreed. Completely unlike him.
Wow.  https://t.co/bqLlDOslPB
@D_Bowman10 @MattMcCoyWTVN play calling was atrocious but, in fairness, there were too many penalties and dropped passes too.
@D_Bowman10 @MattMcCoyWTVN I'm not convinced he's being truthful. Just Urban falling on the sword, as he does. Could be wrong.
RT @MattMcCoyWTVN: Urban Meyer: "I call a lot of plays...you can point the finger right here."
RT @BeauBishop: 2) The loss of Tom Herman is real.  Has been all year, the inability to throw the football down the field, no matter the QB…
RT @Fake_Dispatch: Mark May with a shit eating grin.
Can't watch Mark May right now. #OSUvsMSU
RT @LoriSchmidt: Ezekiel Elliott's longest run today has been 7 yards. He's currently averaging 2.8 yards per carry.
@D_Bowman10 definitely true!
@D_Bowman10 giving him the ball every play just isn't going to work against good defensive teams.
