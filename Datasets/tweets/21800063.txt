I also took a deep dive on the recent history of third-party presidential candidates, including a look at the states where an independent like Schultz could expect to run strongest. 		(Hint: Go west, old man.) https://t.co/oWXyUFl7ZG https://t.co/8FBBogrxtQ
Our findings: Democrats were a little more likely to say they would think about voting third party than Republicans. And voters who disapprove of Trump's job performance (an overall majority) were significantly more likely than Trump approvers. https://t.co/EziEiQ0qHh
We took another approach in this week's @politico/@MorningConsult poll, asking voters' willingness to consider a third-party candidate without naming anyone.

For governor's, three states are forecast to flip toward Democrats (Ill., Mich. and N.M.), but another nine GOP-held statehouses are rated as toss-ups. Big range of possible outcomes here. https://t.co/EEZqoiDHZ9

The final @politico race ratings are out this morning, and Democrats are on the cusp of winning the House. In total, 216 seats are rated as solid/likely/lean Democratic, just a hair shy of the 218 needed to win the majority. 22 are rated as toss-ups. https://t.co/EEZqoiDHZ9

Ok, I'm going outside now. So long.
There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of these results; I admit that I am, too. And, by all means, let's have a robust debate about RBS/RDD sampling in election surveys and weighting by party ID/registration.		I just wish we could do all this without assigning malice here.
Party ID doesn't equal party registration, of course. But here's the latest from the voter rolls: 37D, 35R, 27I/O. Yes, more Rs have voted in recent elections. But polls almost across the board suggest Ds are more enthusiastic than Rs for this election.
It says very clearly in @jennagiesta's story that there are fewer independents in the likely-voter (40D, 37R, 23I) subsample. It's not quite right to say that the poll has "more [i]ndependent voters than Democrats or Republicans," as the DeSantis memo alleges.
Third, let's deal with the partisan composition of the sample (and, by extension, weighting to party ID). The campaign conflates the self-reported party ID of all adults surveyed (32D, 29R, 39I) with the party registration for likely voters.
Second, the campaign questions why CNN would conduct a poll in the run-up to a debate airing on its network tonight. It's something Fox News did when it sponsored a #FLGOV GOP primary debate in June. But I didn't hear DeSantis' campaign complain then. https://t.co/atMsPdYooy
First, I think DeSantis' campaign calls @ssrs_research, an independent research firm based in Pennsylvania, a "left-leaning [D]emocratic pollster." Huh?
On the other hand, there's this statement from the DeSantis campaign, which rejects the poll (and, by extension, the context provided in CNN's story). But it misses a few points. https://t.co/3GLL5UaRX0
While the results might be surprising, it doesn't surprise me at all that @jennagiesta does a great job in putting the survey in context of the other polls, which generally show toss-up races, not sizable Democratic leads. https://t.co/PmoBk2WvUJ

Put more articulately, I'll see that they are starting a new district. Or maybe I'll see that they're halfway through (n=250) a new survey. But then I'll discount it as "incomplete," not "wrong" in one direction or another.
Speaking personally, I'm so excited this project exists. To the extent I haven't embraced it fully, it's not because I've found something to dismiss in one or more surveys. It's like drinking out of a firehose -- and that hose is flowing, even when you're not thirsty. https://t.co/5fselhhgd0

If you're in the path of the storm, evacuate from the coast. The coast will become the ocean (or Gulf, in this case). Shelter in the lowest floor of a structure, away from windows and falling trees. Be prepared to be without power for at least a week.
With #Michael, the storm will be a fast mover, so inland flooding is less of a concern. But the threats of deadly storm surge and a huge swath of wind damage are higher for this storm. Don't sleep on it.
I actually want to underscore this point: Florence is our most recent point of reference. While the inland flooding was catastrophic, Florence weakened before landfall, so coastal impacts (rain and storm surge) were not so bad.
Maximum sustained winds still at 120 mph, but concern is growing about wind and surge impacts. https://t.co/6yGJrZBhvK

#Florence's maximum sustained winds down another tick, to 105 mph, in the 11 a.m. advisory. "Little change in strength is expected before the center reaches the coast, with weakening expected after the center moves inland." https://t.co/vpOvyvrO38
@ewstephe Floyd made a secondary landfall on Long Island when I was in high school. 11th-grade Steve was probably the peak of my hurricane-tracking career.
It took almost two decades, but finally all my Hurricane Floyd knowledge is about to pay off. https://t.co/xlanMyw6jl

#Florence is now a low-end Category-3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. A positive trend for coastal residents, though still a dangerous situation. https://t.co/gx1rTvyf9y

@howardmegdal Sorry your crazy friend has to spend time out in Fairfax. Though I guess it's better than being crushed by a falling scoreboard.
(Category 3 hurricanes are still very dangerous, I should add.)
Here's some modestly good news: There's some margin of error on these forecasts, but @NHC_Atlantic no longer has #Florence strengthening into a Category-4 storm before landfall in the Carolinas. Top intensity is now Category 3. https://t.co/PEEwsmjO5O
@howardmegdal Nope, your friend isn't crazy. We're going to be just fine here in the DMV.
Maximum sustained winds for #Florence down another tick to 120 mph. Still Category 3. https://t.co/rsPTcM0hf9
