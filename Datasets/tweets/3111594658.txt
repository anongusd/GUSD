@s8n Me. And 2 cats. You'll have litter boxes and laser pointers of course?
@SenateGOP But we can afford a pointless wall? And massive tax cuts for the wealthy? God, just shut up.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How does the orange freak intend to do it?
@GOP You guys are really shitting your pants now aren't ya?
@GOP Wow look at all this support.

@JimKilbane @realDonaldTrump What did she ask that plastic surgeon to do, make her look like she's permanently trying to move objects with her mind?
@realDonaldTrump Please, for the love of god read something.
@siano2020 Psychic. Of.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You know presidents don't declare a state of emergency in order to keep a ridiculous campaign promise. Not good ones at least. End this horsecrap.
@SenMcSallyAZ @SenateGOP What's the average median income of those jobs? And in what markets?
@GOP Y'all are really obsessed with her!
@ValaAfshar He straight up out ran a typhoon.
@CultofSmith Ours went out for a while too. You in Draper?
@realDonaldTrump Except it violates separation of church and state.
RT @stdojo: @GOP @PressSec TX Border Sheriffs: There is No Crisis and We Don’t Want Trump’s Wall	Despite Trump’s attempt to paint the TX-Me…
@GOP @PressSec Nearly everyone can argue there's not a crisis at the border
@GOP Its happened in both parties. This is why we're more polarized than ever before.  At least the Left isn't associated with white nationalists, white supremacists or the gun lobby.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump No Trump held the fed worker's checks hostage to manipulate the senate into funding for a campaign promise he never could've delivered on. Democrats simply held out and refused to give into the demand for something that empirically won't work.
@CultofSmith @EBBank14 You should now send us on missions!!
@CNBC When 5g is fully implemented nationwide Teslas will be able to go full self driving mode.

@weathergirl32 @verizon @JohnLegere Been with tmobile for years and their customer service is tops. I even worked for a competitor briefly and refused their employee discount in favor of the service and signal I get from tmobile. My husbands line has been with the company for 20 years now. He converted me lol!
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Bannon will be an absolute TREAT! I don't agree with the guys politics at all, but he was the only campaign member with a lick of sense. Read Fear by Bob Woodward. A Bannon arrest would be delicious!
@realDonaldTrump Salvage any decency you may still have for your youngest child's sake and just resign. Do the right thing @realDonaldTrump
@ABC Bad link. Also they had these at the Winco checkout for $.33/box just 4 days ago.

@PinaforeGeek @SophieT Nothing diminishes my experience and the torment I've endured quite like a well intentioned co-worker organizing their desk and jokingly saying "I'm so OCD!" No you're fucking not. But when I can joke about the little tar pit in my brain it doesn't take as long to climb out of it
@realDonaldTrump Show some dignity man.
@realDonaldTrump you keep telling yourself that. This country's majority does not support you.
