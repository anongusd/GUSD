NAACP president on CNN: Our position is the same, he needs to resign
First CNN replay clip, Northam admitting to a blackface incident. First CNN interview after the press conference, NAACP president crushing Northam
Northam's press team is desperately trying to wrap this press conference.
Northam is being pretty honest. He believes the only reason why he shouldn't resign is because there's no photo of the dance contest blackface incident.
Northam's defense bottomline: I can survive this because there is no photo of the real blackface incident (media is probably calling local San Antonia affiliates)
Let's remember, Northam's first instinct yesterday was to believe it was him. He had to call around to investigate.
This press conference has only ensured that people will double down on their calls for Northam to resign.

The Northam defense: Not a picture on MY yearbook page, not MY nickname on my yearbook page but there was an incident and I was called that nickname.
Northam has now apologized to everyone except to Ed Gillespie who he repeatedly and falsely called a racist.
So everyone is calling for Northam to resign for a racist photo possibly showing him in blackface and his response is that he did indeed do that, just not in that picture and because of that he will not resign.
