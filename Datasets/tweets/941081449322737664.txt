@Whtapl @mtracey @TulsiGabbard I'm 100% in agreement that a Tulsi prez with Bernie as VP would be better...the physicist in me just can't bring myself to believe that its a possibility in 2020...but regardless i'll certainly do my part 2 try and make it happen...its just if it doesn't I will vote for Bernie...
@Whtapl @mtracey i really wish it were that simple...its about principle for me too...Tulsi or Bernie are the only ones i'll vote for the dem nominee...otherwise its Green for me...
@Whtapl @mtracey True he has (much less hysterically) supported "Russiagate" and that is irritating. on the other hand it's kept the establishment somewhat off his back so its hard 2 argue its bad strategy. &amp; again, not arguing he should get a vote over @TulsiGabbard, only over the neocon dems.
@Whtapl @mtracey I have no problem with that position which I take to mean you would vote for @TulsiGabbard, which I 100% support because the more votes she gets the better (she might get mine too)...I really hope Bernie chooses her as his VP candidate because unfortunately she has little chance.
@Whtapl @mtracey agreed...
@Whtapl @mtracey Again, would he start an actual hot war with Russia is my criteria...I don't believe he would...I cannot say the same for psycho Joe Biden or AIPAC Kamala or any of the other neocon dems...watch who the neocons back, it won't be Bernie...
@Whtapl @mtracey I'd love for Tulsi to be a realistic candidate (so would @mtracey) &amp; I'd gladly vote for her over Bernie. Statistically I just can't bring myself 2 believe she has a realistic chance. we just don't seem to be there yet as a country &amp; 2 many are brainwashed by anti-Russia hysteria
@Whtapl @mtracey And that was an unequivocally terrible decision by Bernie...The question is would he make an even worse decision today like start a war with Russia in Ukraine or Syria...I think not...I can't say the same for the other neocon corporate dems...
@Whtapl @mtracey I guess I should say I don't think Bernie is evil...like the other corporate neocon dems...he's a bit spineless and bows to the establishement at times, but in my mind not evil...
@Whtapl @mtracey Its not a "lesser of evils". its a do we vote for anyone or not. is UR argument not to vote? Bernie has legit policy proposals which would help many Americans &amp; which he's consistently backed throughout his career. Voting (for example) Kamala the COP would be a "lesser of evils".
@SenWarren No dream was too big...except for #MedicareForAll &amp; ending the wars...or raining in the big banks...oh and NOT drone assassinating US citizens...oh &amp; NOT ending Habeus Corpus...&amp; NOT expanding the surveillance state or NOT creating a "ministry of truth"...so many big dreams..
