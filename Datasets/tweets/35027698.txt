@MorningBluberry @SilERabbit Number one rule: get your facts right. Swann Street Strategies is different than Partners.
@davidsirota It‚Äôs an opinion piece with an agenda telling other people how to think, not an objectively reported news story from which people are able to make up their own minds. I stand by my tweet. It‚Äôs a shame people are conflating the two. Bias goes in both directions: for and against.
It‚Äôs almost 2019. Is there not a map app out there that works?
@DemmyIII No, the point of being a journalist is to reveal what is happening and give it context. I never once thought the point of what I did as a reporter was to rip anyone to shreds.
@davidsirota I‚Äôve just been wondering if there‚Äôs anyone in government you think who does good work, which is also a valid question. Do you think it exists?
@CalebJHull Neither of mine ever did, either. But my lab does it on instinct and didn‚Äôt have to be taught. Goldens should be reclassified.

At about this time of day on every Friday before Christmas for eight straight years (so, like, today 2009-2016), @BarackObama would be in the middle of his annual, epic year-end news conference. 		It was epic for its brilliance, its eloquence, and the kind of news he made.
Cool. There are two big national profiles of @SherrodBrown out in the space of a week with "RUMPLED" in the headline. The headline. It's almost like when no one could think of another descriptor for @BarackObama other than PROFESSORIAL.
Two smart moves by @TomPerez &amp; Mary Beth Cahill: 		1. Holding all 2019 debates in NON-early primary states so more people have a chance to see the candidates		2. Breaking a big field into consecutive night debates via RANDOM selection versus poll numbers		Very healthy. Kudos.

It's not even 2019 yet. Votes won't be cast until 2020. Why are we reading gibberish about where potential candidates fall on some imaginary sliding scale of ideology? Voters don't care. Why don't we write about what these people want to do for Americans? https://t.co/uOOwRowgJ4

They've compromised while pushing the envelope on finding new and innovative ways to do things. They've gotten results. And now, in 2020, there's a clear path for @crisantaduran to flip Colorado's Republican Senate seat. I hope she runs.
Punditry is so focused on a lurch to the left or unhappy independents. In Colorado you have independents and progressives who are jointly choosing to stay on the path they've been on. They are not choosing an unachievable kind of progressivism. They are liberal and smart, period.
In 2014 when Dems lost race after race, @HickforCO won his. Tonight, when Dems are unhappy about some statewide misses, Colorado delivered, bigtime. It's because Hick has done the right things. BONUS: He knows how to win. Don't miss what all this means.
Anyone noticed how happy Dems in Colorado are tonight while everyone else feels so uneven? They dominated there. You think maybe it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre really happy with their leadership? 7 years Denver mayor, 8 years CO Gov, @HickforCo made a huge difference. #MidtermElection2018

I have watched zero cable news for the past 12 days. This is new.
@JohnJHarwood Oh, the good guys on Election Night who are definitely going to win? Hoosiers. Go Big Red.
@macado6413 @lyft @algore There was another person in the Lyft who can confirm it, actually.
Most of my drivers since the triumphant return voter after 20+ years last week have told me they don't like politicians, aren't educated enough on the races, or don't have time. But in every single case, they sounded very educated on their state to me. I tried to convince them!
Here's why the news on voter suppression and efforts to protect voters are so important: My @Lyft driver THIS morning told me he hasn't voted since 2000 when he voted for @algore because he believes he was disenfranchised then. "It left a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm done."

That is a bad place to be. You'll be furious when the next man is on your side. And it diminishes legitimate accusers who have undergone legitimate assaults and the like. You can be deeply worried about Kavanaugh, but don't misplay the hand for all the appointments to come.

@ProfHagle It's Twitter. I'm not in court. It was a horrendous decision. Some of you take things way too literally. I was making a point, and it was an obvious one. Come on.
SCOTUS decision today on Ohio voting is totally inconsistent with the Constitution, and though I'm no lawyer, you could make a theoretical argument that it violates the 24th Amendment. Like if you don't vote in the midterms (your "tax"), you can't vote in the presidential, sorry

@svdate You say someone is poised &amp; wise beyond her years in a phone conversation as a reference. You don't say it in an official White House statement that can thank her for her service and loyalty. It calls attention to her youth &amp; gender, and there's no reason to do that.
@svdate You're missing the point. John Kelly gave a gendered statement about Hope Hicks, and it speaks to the fact that he views women as "sacred" and that young women may not be the badasses he wants to serve in big jobs. Again, just think about it for a minute.
@svdate No. Dee Dee Myers was Clinton's WH press secretary when she was 31. And go back and read about all the big jobs and the ages of those who held them in the Nixon administration.
@svdate Also, no one says "poised" to refer to a man. Trust me on this. If you actually think about it, you'll get it.
@svdate I get it. No need to call attention to her age in a complimentary statement. Why can't she be wise, period? And he wouldn't have said that about a 29-year-old guy.
For those with the snark, look - @POTUS had a much better and non-gendered statement on her departure.
Nitpick here but really: Chief John Kelly calls Hope Hicks poised &amp; wise beyond her years. Would he have said that about a departing man?

I asked Tillerson if he knew Trump's tweet was coming, and he said no but that it was consistent with the administration's message.
"circumstances could evolve to the point that for mutual deterrence reasons, we might have to consider that" re South Korean/Japanese nukes
so they put out a statement that we didn‚Äôt have dinner because I was tired." 2/2

Re the flap last night that caused a reporter in Washington to tweet incorrectly that Tillerson's trip to Asia was cut short, he said
He said for now he will determine future press travel decisions on a trip-by-trip basis.
He also said he is not a big media access person, but that he knows where to find the press when he has a message to get across.
In it, Tillerson talked about Vice President Pence visiting both South Korea and Japan next month.

Boy do people love to go along with the crowd. The reality is Barack and Michelle Obama are way better at that.
If feel like if I were HRC, I would want "forgiveness" and "resolve" to be traits gushed by my spouse about me. He missed those.
Gonna get a lot more interesting in 2044 when the beginning of the spouse's marriage anecdote starts with swiping right
In @60Minutes intvw in '92, Bill said he bought a house and said she better marry him because he can't live there alone. Same story coming?
What is happening? Seriously, Michelle encore.

@blucaller @ElizabethDrewOH you know how there are 16 candidates + the millions of ppl watching debate haven't seen her stump speech? Right.
The East Coast already went to bed. I got the text alert about 20 minutes ago. Playing for Nevada here.
90 minutes is a real sweet spot.
For all the wondering about where Trump is, remember, this is the 3rd hour of the debate. Most viewers probably only stayed for first half.
news to watch: Trump is putting out a tax plan in about two weeks.
Jeb Bush ceded his very first opportunity to attack Donald Trump to Scott Walker.
Kasich campaign calls Graham's claim Kasich would close four military bases "nonsense," saying Kasich wants to increase size of U.S. Navy.
The only candidate not named Trump attacked in undercard debate: John Kasich, who Graham attacked as not strong enough on foreign policy.
Notes from the filing center: The sound is so bad in here it's hard to pick up half of what these candidates are saying.
I thought the rules were supposed to go by the wayside when candidates were debating each other; Pataki was not able to do that on ISIS.
Obviously Romney got the nomination, but that attack stayed with him all the way through the election and hurt him massively in general
Pataki AC attack on Trump is akin to Perry + Gingrich going after Mitt Romney for making investments in companies that laid off workers.
PATAKI on Trump: ‚ÄúHe will do for America what he did for Atlantic City, and that is not someone we will nominate.‚Äù
In July Trump formed vets coalition in NH after he made McCain comments + said he'd build a VA hospital there. (Not 1 now; NH vets go to VT)
Trump said he would take apart the VA, create a while new system and basically privatize it if it weren't cutting it for veterans.
Little detail: 4th graf in 7-graf Trump campaign bio is all about how he made the NYC Veterans Day parade great again - in 1996
Trump said he didn't expect the endorsement of Veterans for a Strong America and he didn't ask for it.
On Trump's comments re illegal immigration, Lucho Horna said: "It's America. It's OK." + said: "We are here to support anybody in America."
Lucho Horna, the vocalist, is Hispanic. "I'm proud to be an American," he told me and called @realDonaldTrump "a great American."
