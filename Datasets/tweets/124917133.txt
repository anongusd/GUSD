@DragonBillyFL I see your point on that. Would the dem/gop numbers balance out considering the entire country with gop being most of country and dem on coasts? (I‚Äôd rather politicians stay out of Ohio) I feel like most important government is the local anyways.
@16NationalChamp @MichaelAvenatti so you think people don‚Äôt have equal say in how their country is governed? If you have different ideas than the majority of the people, your job is to help others to see the value of your idea, not rig elections to get what you want.
@16NationalChamp @MichaelAvenatti Why? Don‚Äôt you think each person should have equal rights to vote?
@DragonBillyFL I have tried. Use local voting machines or paper ballots, everyone should be registered to vote when 18 (like selective service) voting day should be federal holiday and treated as an important event. What do you think? What am I missing ?
