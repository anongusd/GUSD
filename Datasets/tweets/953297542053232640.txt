@SA_Heroes thats true so i request all south africans to steal and if the police try to arrest you ask them first to arrest Zuma and Malema &amp; Shabir Shaik and the Minister of Finance
@beckybankss mmmmm nice yummy ass 😋😘
can i see down there 😂 https://t.co/MLyRip4onU
Eish guys can you tell me whats wrong with Malema is he on a diet he loose weight
Lol you are wrong Valentines is for every one Black Friday is only for Black People 😂 https://t.co/AbB2pfiJ0U
All the people that Zuma hired also benefit out of the state capture they must also go down with Zuma the Minister of Police the Minister Of Finance the Minister of Home Affairs must also go down with Zuma
The goverment must also start investigate Malema he must go to jail with Zuma and Shabir Shaik
The Goverment must start investigate the prevoiuse councelor of City Of Tshwane he give a 2 million tendar to upgrade the park in attridgeville the park is still the same what happen to the 2 million rand and also look at the flats in mountain view he build
DA &amp; All the other political party must start investigate the prevoiuse Mayor of City Of Pretoria when he was the mayor he giver tender of 2 million to build a park in Attridgeville the park is not even finish
Is it really that dificult to remove Zuma the only way to remove him is to Kill him thats the only way and also when the political party remove Zuma they must also remove all his friends like the Minister of Finance the Minister of Police the Minister of Home Affairs
