Watch - Trump Says Funds for Military Families and Military Readiness "Didn't Sound Too Important to Me." @CSPAN https://t.co/bEMlOUwU7N
The American people are utterly opposed to this gimmick, and President Trump should be ashamed of himself.
It is utterly disrespectful of U.S. national security and the needs of our men and women in uniform, and it further undermines his credibility in requesting the upcoming defense budget.
The President has decided to take tens of billions of dollars from projects that support the military and their families across the country and around the world to build his wall without Congressional approval, projects which he says ‘didn’t sound too important to me.’

We must not allow Russia to receive a free pass for violating the INF Treaty, which is exactly what the Trump administration is handing President Putin.
President Trump withdrawing from this treaty reopens a field of competition with yet another class of nuclear weapons and, perhaps ironically, reverses one of President Reagan’s most important historical achievements in a way that benefits Moscow.
The risk of miscalculation or misunderstanding is already higher than at any point since the end of the Cold War, and this decision only makes it worse.
The administration’s ideological aversion to arms control as a tool for advancing national security is endangering our safety, as well as that of our allies and partners.
By withdrawing from the INF Treaty instead of making an honest, good-faith effort to collectively punish Russia for its treaty violations and bring it back into compliance, we are playing into President Putin’s hands.
The Trump administration is needlessly ignoring the concerns of our allies and partners on an issue that should unify NATO, not divide it.

... I am adamantly opposed to President Trump using an unwise, weak, and irresponsible legal gimmick to circumvent Congress and the American people’s opposition to using taxpayer money for the construction of an unnecessary wall."
That would raise major questions about his credibility when he requests his next defense budget from Congress.
Moreover, by abusing this authority, President Trump would be saying that he does not actually believe all the money he requests for our country’s defense is needed for legitimate national security purposes.
Diverting money from these military construction accounts could have substantial impacts for servicemembers at installations across the country and on defense projects that are important in supporting readiness, training, operations, and quality of life for military personnel ...

We should not take the bait and fall into Putin’s trap. We should recognize that nuclear stability has been an essential component of national security. Exiting INF&amp;New START would divide us from our allies, derail that stability &amp; lead us into an uncontrolled nuclear competition
Our strength is in our alliances, not in adding yet one more exotic new weapon or nuclear delivery platform, which is why we should implement the measures I’ve pursued in the House NDAA to push Russia back into compliance via sanctions and other methods.
It would divide our allies and play directly into President Putin’s hands. As our allies and partners have discussed, one of President Putin’s goals in undermining the INF Treaty is to goad us into such an action.
Those actions would needlessly and dangerously remove constraints on Russia’s testing and deployment of illegal cruise missiles; give Russia free rein to deploy an unlimited number of nuclear weapons; and plunge us headlong into a twenty-first century nuclear arms race.
Withdrawing from the INF treaty and letting the New START Treaty expire would be grave mistakes.

If we are worried about having an economy and a defense establishment that can compete with China and other global powers in the 2020s and 2030s, then enacting a massive, unpaid-for tax cut that will put us in a terrible position was the absolute worst thing we could do.
I am seriously concerned by the CBO’s finding that the national debt will break record levels and become ‘the highest in the nation’s history by far’ in the early 2030s, due to the tax cuts and spending increases Congress has passed over the previous two years.

We all want a peaceful resolution to this situation, but that will require more substantial results than President Trump has so far provided.

"I am also concerned that President Trump apparently suspended exercises without even consulting the government of South Korea and without providing corresponding guidance to United States Forces Korea, the relevant U.S. military command ..."
The exercises that the United States conducts with allies and partners on and around the Korean Peninsula are invaluable tools for maintaining the readiness to respond to potential North Korean aggression.

Congress should start by passing the bipartisan bill I introduced last October that would protect transgender members of the U.S. military by preventing DoD from removing currently serving members of the Armed Forces based solely on their gender identity.
Stripping patriotic service members of their ability to serve openly in this way goes against American values. I condemn this decision and will continue to fight it with all of my abilities. #HonorTransTroops #ProtectTransTroops #TransMilitaryBan
There is zero credible evidence that this policy has negatively affected readiness. By issuing this decision, @realDonaldTrump has engaged in an act of pure discrimination against people who sacrifice every day to serve their country—and who have been doing so for years.
.@realDonaldTrump decision to ban transgender military service is vicious, inhumane, and utterly wrong. There are scores of transgender men and women serving in the military right now, under a policy that had already been established &amp; vetted by DOD and validated by the courts.

Those tax cuts will reverberate in our budget calculus—including the defense budget—for years to come.
When you cut taxes in the face of a $22 trillion debt and increase the deficit from $700 billion to nearly a trillion, you are making a public policy decision about what you do and don't want to spend money on.
“This level of national debt is dangerous and unacceptable.” -- Mitch McConnell, 2016
The national debt "will weigh down our country like an anchor.” -- Paul Ryan, 2013

It would lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons, feed a nuclear arms race, increase the risk of miscalculation that could precipitate a nuclear war, and could potentially undermine our most survivable nuclear forces.
This approach would siphon resources away from the capabilities we need to best counter our near-peer adversaries.
The release of this Nuclear Posture Review takes the United States in a dangerous direction that will undermine our defense posture, and further aggravate our national security budgeting difficulties.

we will continue to work to improve this bill today, on the floor, and through conference
this bill is based on a lot of hope. and as the military always says, hope is not a strategy.
while we're trying to make sure we support the men and women in the military, we have to do it not just in the short term but the long term
we continue to hope that the money will appear, and this bill is playing a very high-stakes game.
at the same time the budget control act comes back into effect
thats why chairman's mark has provided enough money for OCO money that we will face a shortfall in OCO 5 or 6 months through the year
problem is we are unwilling as a congress to provide enough money to meet those complex threats
being the guarantor of national security across the globe has worked out reasonably well
threat environment for the united states has perhaps never been more complex
