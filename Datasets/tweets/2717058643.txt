@dvorakoelling @willowcat2011 Wise words to adhere to, "kindness is predatory", if he were asked the same question on the bench will scar every case he touches. This is the same committee that abuses power, and will only prosecute 5% of all judiciary. Foreign Agents must adhere to the Constitution.
