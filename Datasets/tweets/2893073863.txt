@mecca72 @CharlesMBlow Who said "coddle"?
@resist2018_JSR @CharlesMBlow And it's also not a crime. So let's discuss ways to reduce ignorance instead of being angry at ignorant people, which solves nothing.
@plumandmustard @CharlesMBlow Ignoring facts is unanalytical. Anger is emotion. Conversation is not "digging a hole". Goodbye.
@LKVang64 @Ddm4zebraDebra @CharlesMBlow Yes, exactly. It's a consequence of geography.
@cc_koi @CharlesMBlow And I said "non-white citizens".
@caroldj @CharlesMBlow We're talking about recognizing systemic racism, which is an issue separate from personal racism.
@Phayd2Blaque That and more education from the elementary age on. Unfortunately, many GOP states resist federal education standards.
@plumandmustard @CharlesMBlow One can, of course, but my point is that he's ignoring a real fact: a lot of people simply don't care and aren't engaged. Anger won't fix that. I love Charles's writing, so it felt odd to see him being uncharacteristically unanalytical.
@thenumberofrest @CharlesMBlow Yes, agreed. I didn't mention parents and family because they can be a bad influence as much as a good one.
@_CDooley @CharlesMBlow Hmm, that's true, but I'm referring more to geographical isolation. Thanks for drawing an important distinction.
@jnotine @CharlesMBlow Citizens regularly shirk their responsibilities. That's why we're in this mess.
@xcaliburrnity @CharlesMBlow LA is a loooong way from Iowa, my friend. You need to understand the demographics of the country are not uniform.
@cc_koi @CharlesMBlow Uh, I didn't say anything about myself... But have you ever been to Iowa?...
@lastangrytweet @CharlesMBlow Yeah I agree that in the long run, the biggest driver will continue to be slow but steady cultural shift. But that's cold comfort.
@pinklady_ktown @CharlesMBlow Man, I sure love Twitter. Where else can one find strangers who insist they know one's inner thoughts better than oneself? üôÑ
@MsSophiaLaurent @CharlesMBlow Agreed. We need to get people to *want* to be better to their fellow citizens. I'm not sure how.
@MrChasebooth @MsSophiaLaurent @CharlesMBlow Good observation, and unfortunately that's one of the issues: a lot of racial views are passed down generationally, good *or* bad.
@ms_adroit @CharlesMBlow Of course they *can* read (well, most of them...). The question is how do we get them to read?
@MRoyer3 @CharlesMBlow I'm not sure who you're referring to as "you all", but I agree. I think a lot of people in the past have been too timid to talk about politics and racism in general, and I'm heartened to see that a silver lining of these times is that people are being more vocal.
@gildedbat @CharlesMBlow All true. What we need is ideas to get more people self-informing, and that starts with understanding the situation as it is, not as we wish it to be.
@marcusthomas01 @CharlesMBlow Agreed. It's a real problem, especially now with the ubiquity of social media and on-demand internet in general. What do we do to get people out of their bubbles?
@pinklady_ktown @CharlesMBlow It's clearly an explanation, not an excuse.
@beerstin @CharlesMBlow Sadly, many people have not.  I personally was fortunate enough to see several of those during my education.
@rowdyintellect @CharlesMBlow I don't think a lot of Christians read the Bible.
@Jasaka8 @CharlesMBlow To be clear, we're talking about two different things: not being personally racist or bigoted toward other people vs. recognizing *systemic* racism.  One can be the former without recognizing the latter, which is very common and is something that we should work to correct.
@pauljmoton @CharlesMBlow I'm accepting the facts on the ground, not making excuses for them.
@angieinthesky1 @CharlesMBlow Are you speaking of me specifically? I didn't make any assertions about my personal situation. You're making a lot of assumptions. Why?
@CCB5Keithfan34 @CharlesMBlow Yes, of course they *should* but they aren't, and being mad at them isn't going to make it better.
@Ddm4zebraDebra @CharlesMBlow I agree in the sense that all humans *should* be living a self-reflective life if they want to obtain joyfulness, but I would never argue that most *do*. If racist people ignore racism and good people ignore ignorance, how do we move forward? Anger is not the answer.
@ceehope @CharlesMBlow Great argument üëè
@MsSophiaLaurent @CharlesMBlow Right, but your average idiot isn't going to the library and checking out a heavy tome about injustice that goes against their preconceived notions of American "greatness". We live in a world of a million distractions. It sucks, but it's the situation we need to deal with.
@CharlesMBlow You can choose to be angry at ignorance or you can engage people and change minds.  Don't abandon facts and adopt anger, Charles. We need you on our side.
@CharlesMBlow Charles, you have to accept that many people in this country grew up without exposure to non-white citizens. If media and schools ignore racial issues, when were they supposed to have learned and understood systemic racism? It's simply not a subject where people will self-inform.
