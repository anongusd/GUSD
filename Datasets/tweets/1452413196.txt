Most people don't even understand #FISA it's hilarious when news and media commentators speak on this.

Our politicians care more about staying in power than the Americans who pay them.
A chance is a terrible thing to waste.

I think it's hilarious when I hear the government talk about shutting down GITMO, we can't send them back to their countries..
Healthy Body makes a Healthy Mind.
What's ridiculous about this IRS scandal is how can we give the responsibility to collect taxes to an organization that is corrupt?
Rest in peace to the soldiers who didn't make it back. #iraq #veterans
If the federal government was run like a corporation, it would lead to a better economy.
I can definitely say from my experience of working in the federal government, too many people are afraid of change.
I bet the fine folks at FEMA are having a great time at the NRCC. I wonder how the allocation of resources are being used..... #sarcasm

One of our countries biggest issues is the job market. Companies are outsourcing or "sponsoring" individuals instead of Americans.
