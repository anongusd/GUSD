@CBSNews Concerning Trump's overall approach to Russia, 46% of Americans in @cbsnews poll think he's been too friendly, the same as in July. Most Republicans think his approach has been about right.

@CBSNews AND/BUT: @cbsnews poll finds 63% of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, think congressional Democrats should focus more on passing their own agenda rather than investigating President Trump.
@CBSNews The shift in opinion is due to more Democrats calling it justified: 83% of Republicans continue to say the Russia investigation is politically motivated, the same as in a @cbsnews poll from November.

Amid that pageantry, the White House and Congress remain at an impasse over Trump‚Äôs demands for at least $5 billion in funding for ongoing construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional negotiators have agreed to a little more than $1 billion in funding.
Bush, who died on Friday at age 94, is scheduled to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol from Monday evening to Wednesday morning. Services are set to be held Wednesday in Washington. Mr. Trump also has declared a national day of mourning on Wednesday.
Any vote by Congress to move the spending deadline would prolong a holiday season showdown between the White House and Congress over President Trump‚Äôs demands for billions of dollars in border security funding.
Funding for some parts of the federal government is set to expire at midnight on Dec. 7 ‚Äî a deadline set months ago that now would fall at the end of a week when Washington is set to be focused on national tributes to the late president and services in Washington and Texas.
Confirmed: The death of former President George H. W. Bush is likely to push back a potential shutdown of some government operations by at least a week, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.

Call it a blue downpour, trickle, wave, whatever ‚Äî either way, there is indisputable depth and scope to what Democrats achieved in retaking House control. 6/6
KY5, a GOP sage spot, is the nation‚Äôs most rural district, but ME2 is the second-most rural. And of course, House Democrats represent the most urban areas. 5/
With the exception of KY5, Democrats represent four of the five poorest districts in the country (NY15, MI13, MS2 and AL7) and the five wealthiest: CA18, CA17, VA10, NY3 and NJ11. 4/
The districts with the highest median income (CA18), and lowest median income (NY15) are represented by Democrats. 3/
Democrats now represent the easternmost point in the USA (ME2), the southernmost point (FL26), the northernmost point in the continental USA (MN7). (The western and northern-most points overall are in AK1, where Don Young appears safe.) 2/
Here‚Äôs a fun way to look at the scope of House Democratic victories: They literally hold seats ‚ÄúFrom California to the New York island (NY11 ‚Äî Staten Island. The two Long Island districts are still Republican.). From the Redwood Forest (CA2), to the gulf stream waters (MA9).‚Äù 1/

Rosen added that Republicans ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt accept this if the tables were turned. They absolutely wouldn‚Äôt. They delayed the nomination of a Supreme Court justice for a year, so we know what they‚Äôre doing." (5) #nvsen
Regarding how the Senate is handling The Kavanaugh accusations, Rosen said: ‚ÄúHow do you think the Senate is handling this?		"I think they‚Äôre not handling it in a fair way. ... Another week isn‚Äôt going to make a difference, so what‚Äôs the rush? What are they trying to hide?‚Äú (4)
In response, Rosen said: ‚ÄúAnyone who‚Äôs been a victim of sexual assault, it‚Äôs not a hiccup. He not just said it was a hiccup, but after this hiccup we‚Äôd go back to business as usual. It‚Äôs disrespectful to anyone who comes forward as a victim." #NVSen (3)
Heller predicted that Kavanaugh would ultimately be confirmed despite the accusations. 		‚ÄúWe got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we‚Äôll get through this and we‚Äôll get off to the races,‚Äù he said, according to the New York Times. (2)
Spoke earlier today here in Vegas with @RosenforNevada about her campaign against @DeanHeller. Asked her about his comment that the Kavanaugh accusations are a ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù that will be cleared soon. (1)

INBOX: Sen. Hatch, Harris and other members of House and Senate in both parties introduce measure to posthumously award Aretha Franklin the Congressional Gold Medal.
After targeting Republicans in her speech, Warren asked by a reporter to identify a Democrat behaving in a corrupt fashion. She cites former SEC boss Mary Jo White, who also once served as top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
In her remarks, Warren acknowledges that her proposals would upend the nature of Washington, where current and former gov‚Äôt officials live, work and play in the same neighborhoods. In essence, she‚Äôs pushing a swamp-draining plan under a different banner.
6th: ‚ÄúBuild a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials‚Äîeven powerful Senators and Presidents‚Äîfile disclosures and get rid of conflicts.‚Äù
5th: Warren calls for changes to code of conduct for federal judges: ‚Äúno stock trading, no payments from corporations for attending events, no honoraria for giving speeches, no lavish getaways and fancy hunting trips funded by billionaires.‚Äù Cites Gorsuch‚Äòs speech at Trump Hotel.
4th: Warren wants companies that mislead federal agencies to be prosecuted.
To be clear: Warren‚Äôs proposals are a laundry list of dreams with little chance of being enacted in full, certainly now and also under a Democratic Congress. But, Dems see anti-corruption message working in some places this year as they cast themselves as a check on Trump.
Citing the Manafort trial (but not by name), Warren calls for a ban on foreign Govenrments hiring lobbyists. Says they should be required to use their diplomats instead.
This is interesting: To curb the allure of lobbying, Warren calls for raising congressional staff salaries so that ‚Äúlow-paid staffers don‚Äôt feel compelled to audition for jobs with influence peddlers when they should be standing up to them.‚Äù
Third, lobbying reform: Put a ‚Äúwindfall tax on excessive lobbying.‚Äù And, require ‚Äúeveryone who gets paid to influence government‚Äù to register. Also, ‚ÄúMake every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official a matter of public record.‚Äú
Second Warren says: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to ban elected officials and senior agency officials from owning or trading any company stocks while in office. They can put their savings in conflict-free investments like mutual funds or they can pick a different line of work.‚Äù Direct jab at Trump
In her speech, Warren calls for a lifetime ban on lawmakers, Cabinet secretaries and other policy makers from becoming lobbyists after they leave office.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs face it: there‚Äôs no real question that the Trump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. But they are not the cause of the rot ‚Äì they‚Äôre just the biggest, stinkiest example of it.‚Äù ‚Äî Warren
In her speech, Warren calls out Mick Mulvaney, Gary Cohn, Wilbur Ross, Scott Pruitt and Rep. Chris Collins as examples of corrupt actors.

Smith (D-MN): ‚ÄúI had hoped that the President would appoint a consensus Justice, a person ready to protect the rights of all Americans over special interests and groups driven by political ideology. But make no mistake‚ÄîJudge Kavanaugh will not be that Justice.‚Äù
Schatz (D-Hawaii): ‚ÄúI will continue to study Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs record and follow his hearing closely, but I have grave reservations about this nominee.‚Äù
Bennet (D-CO): Trump ‚Äúchose a nominee whose ideology would shift the Court's majority, thereby threatening fundamental rights and failing to check executive power. As a result, I have grave concerns about this nomination.‚Äù
Tillis (R-NC): ‚ÄúJudge Kavanaugh undoubtedly has the right qualifications to serve as an associate justice on the Supreme Court, and I look forward to meeting with him in the coming weeks in advance of his confirmation hearing.‚Äù
Cassidy (R-La.): ‚ÄúJudge Kavanaugh‚Äîsolid pick. President Trump kept his promise, nominating a conservative faithful to the Constitution as written, recognized as having an excellent legal mind.‚Äù
Whitehouse (D-RI): ‚ÄúSpecial interests approved this nominee.  The confirmation process will be powered by massive, secretive spending by their phony front groups.  That‚Äôs why Brett Kavanaugh must convince me he can actually be independent.‚Äù
Shaheen (D-NH): ‚ÄúI will only support Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination if he protects the civil rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.‚Äù
Warner (D-Va.): ‚ÄúI cannot and will not support a nominee who would take this country backwards by undermining our fundamental rights and American values.‚Äù
INBOX: George W. Bush on nomination of his former staff secretary to serve on SCOTUS: ‚ÄúPresident Trump has made an outstanding decision... ... He is a fine husband, father, and friend ‚Äì and a man of the highest integrity. He will make a superb Justice of the Supreme Court."
Kaine (D-VA): ‚Äú‚Äú	I‚Äôm encouraging Virginians to send me feedback on what they‚Äôre looking for in a Supreme Court justice, and I won‚Äôt make a final decision until I have met one-on-one with Judge Kavanaugh.‚Äù
Corker (R-TN): Kavanaugh ‚Äúa well-respected jurist who understands the importance of upholding the Constitution and applying the law in a fair and independent manner. I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh during the confirmation process.‚Äù
Heinrich (D-NM) focused less on Kavanaugh, more on the process, saying in part: ‚ÄúI refuse to legitimize the broken system Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has created on President Trump‚Äôs behalf. ... ... any nomination to our courts should require input from both parties.‚Äù
Murphy: ‚ÄúI am so disheartened that President Trump would choose such a radical, anti-consumer, anti-woman jurist to be his nominee for the Supreme Court.‚Äù
Kennedy (R-La.): ‚ÄúI want someone who‚Äôs smart, intellectually curious and willing to test their assumptions against the arguments of those who disagree with them.‚Äù
Menendez (D-NJ): ‚ÄúI cannot support a nominee culled from the rightwing wish lists of the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.‚Äù
Duckworth (D-Ill.): ‚ÄúI will thoroughly review Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs rulings, evaluate his qualifications and look for him to make it clear to the American public that he would be independent, not simply a rubber stamp for Donald Trump‚Äôs whims, if he hopes to earn my support.‚Äù
Definite no: Murray (D-Wash.): ‚ÄúI oppose this nomination and I will strongly encourage my Senate colleagues to stand with me and with people across the country in rejecting him‚Äù
Reserving judgment: Donnelly (D-Ind.), facing re-election: ‚ÄúFollowing the president‚Äôs announcement, I will carefully review and consider the record and qualifications of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.‚Äù
No: Durbin (D-IL): ‚ÄúReplacing Justice Kennedy‚Äôs swing vote with a far-right jurist like Judge Kavanaugh could change the rules in America.‚Äù
Definite no: @SenGillibrand: Kavanaugh ‚Äúwould tip the balance of the Supreme Court even more against workers‚Äô rights, civil rights, and women‚Äôs rights for decades to come. I do not think he is the right choice for our country...‚Äù
Reed (D-RI): ‚ÄúI opposed Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination to a lower court seat because of his overtly partisan background.  I did not believe he was a good fit to serve on the DC Circuit then, and I do not think he is a good fit for the Supreme Court now.‚Äù
Leaning no: @SenFeinstein (D-CA): ‚ÄúWe need a nominee who understands that the court is there to protect the rights of all Americans, not just political interest groups and the powerful.‚Äù

Baldwin (D-Wis.), up for reelection, also reserving judgment: ‚ÄúThe stakes are very high for the American people and these are the things that I will be looking for as I review the nomination.‚Äù

From Sanders (I-Vt.): ‚ÄúI do not believe a person with those views should be given a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. We must mobilize the American people to defeat Trump‚Äôs right-wing, reactionary nominee."

Is this a first since Trump took office? In his Singapore news conference, he has taken questions from every news outlet that has a front-row seat in the White House Press Briefing Room: NBC, Fox, CBS, AP, ABC, Reuters, CNN.

Under questioning, Trump says he‚Äôll visit Pyongyang ‚Äúat the appropriate time.‚Äù Says he‚Äôs invited Kim to the White House.
Trump says human rights was discussed during his meetings with Kim. Added that he pressed Kim to resolve the status of remains of people still missing from the Korean War.
Trump adds that U.S. will end war games with South Korea, something that will save the U.S. money. Said earlier that a N. Korean missile testing site will be destroyed.
