I can’t begin to express how angry this makes me. This is a reprehensible cycle of hardship being imposed on certain soldiers because of who they are, with the express intent of barring them from service. The Trump administration’s policy is discriminatory and un-American.
How the ban actually works is insidious:		1. They force transgender troops to serve in the gender assigned at birth	2. Because of this, transgender troops may experience mental distress	3. Then they say that the mental distress should result in being discharged from the military
I won't sit quietly when I hear DOD officials compare transgender identity to diabetes or heart disease.		Identity isn't a medical condition.

I am honored to represent the people of Prince George’s County, and I am proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in their call for Delegate Lisanti to resign.
In 2019, we should not have to explain the seriousness of using this epithet. This hateful word was, and is still callously used in an effort to dehumanize black Americans. The racism evoked by this word is all too real, and it has no place in anyone’s vocabulary.
Every public official must stand for the values of equality and inclusion that unite Maryland families from all backgrounds.
Ms. Lisanti’s use of a racial slur and her inability to fully grasp the offensiveness of the word has demonstrated that she clearly cannot represent the voters in Harford County who put her in office.

- Almost half a billion to modernize schools on-base that teach servicemembers’ children	- Nearly half a billion for hospitals and medical facilities that care for wounded U.S. troops and military families

As the President’s own intel officials said this week: Russia, China, and North Korea are real threats that stand counter to U.S. interests around the globe. Abandoning efforts to diplomatically reduce arms while undermining our alliances leaves us, and the world, less safe.
This move only increases the importance of the trans-Atlantic alliance, which will continue to be the bedrock of our defense against Russia. I strongly encourage the administration refrain from further undermining our NATO alliance and instead pursue tough multilateral diplomacy.
Abandoning treaties will not make us safer. Opening the door for Russia to create and deploy nuclear weapons with impunity, with no plan to diplomatically counter their malign activities, only damages our national security and increases the risk of conflict in Europe.
The INF Treaty has been an important source of security for the U.S. and our allies.

@SpeakerRyan Trump is already threatening another shutdown or to declare a national emergency. Neither is acceptable. 		We are never going to give in to a hostage-taker, never going to build his wall, and are always going to stand up for federal workers, contractors and our national security.
@SpeakerRyan Let's get another thing straight.		Trump caved. He listened to Democrats and agreed to open the government before negotiating. 		This is a win, but the damage to fed workers and contractors, their families, and our country is done. This was shameful and should never happen again.
@SpeakerRyan - Trump keeps the government shutdown for over 30 days	- Trump threatens a national emergency	- Trump proposes a sham deal	- And now Trump agrees to a CR, almost exactly the same as the one we wanted on December 20.		He made thousands of people suffer. For nothing. #TrumpShutdown
So let me get this straight.		- On Dec. 19, Senate passes a short-term CR funding the gov. until Feb. 8	- Trump demands $5 billion for a wall.	- In his last act of cowardice, @SpeakerRyan doesn't bring the Senate bill up, and instead brings one up with wall money.	- We shut down.

@HASCDemocrats To go so far as to leak the travel of the Speaker of the House, violating practices of operational security, thus endangering her safety, the safety of the delegation, their staff, and the personnel on the ground is unprecedented, unconscionable, and a dereliction of duty.
@HASCDemocrats To do this at a time when our alliances are shaken, when the President is considering a troop withdrawal, when multiple personnel have been killed in action, and when diplomats are working without pay because the President has thrown our government into chaos, is irresponsible.
@HASCDemocrats When I was deployed to Iraq, I was visited by numerous Members of Congress, and the questions they asked and inquiries they made gave them valuable insight during a period when our mission was both dangerous and uncertain.
In my capacity as a Member of Congress, I have visited Afghanistan, NATO, Ukraine, and our allies in the Baltics. As a member of the @HASCDemocrats, the value of the information and intelligence I gathered from each of these trips cannot be overstated.
The President’s rash decision to impede upon Congress' ability to conduct oversight of our global military engagements is the pinnacle of petty, and the most acute example of how this President’s childishness undermines our ability to govern responsibly every day. https://t.co/0ByG1E2NMV

We cannot allow the President to pursue his anti-immigrant, anti-family, partisan, nativist agenda that harms the most vulnerable among us and separates immigrant families. Instead, we must build an immigration system that honors human dignity.
There are effective, humane alternatives that keep children and families out of detention. These alternatives provide a legal process to move forward, and elicit a 95% compliance rate, not to mention our immigration enforcement agencies have used these programs in the past.
Over the past 2 years, the Trump administration has pursued its mission to keep immigrant children detained, including infants &amp; toddlers, with zeal. It's abhorrent and un-American. 		Our immigration system doesn't have to rely on detention, especially for vulnerable populations.
This breaking news is tragic, and the continued detention of immigrant children and families that inflicts so much trauma cannot stand.

Stalking is often the first step in an escalating pattern of criminality that leads to violence. 76% of women who were murdered by an intimate partner were first stalked. Having the ability to prevent a stalker from purchasing a weapon before they become violent is critical.
In addition, too many people are victims of intimate partner violence, and right now, the definition of intimate partner doesn’t include dating partners. This legislation changes that definition to include dating partners.
There are dangerous loopholes that leave victims of domestic violence and stalking unprotected by law. Too many women are killed because their abusers are allowed to possess firearms under a temporary restraining order during the period of time they are most likely to lash out.
Today I am proud to reintroduce the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act. When the system fails, and perpetrators of abuse slip through the cracks and escalate their violence, it's our moral responsibility to close loopholes &amp; save the lives of potential victims.

Maintaining a sustained troop presence on the border -- a mission using more personnel than in Iraq or Syria -- is a waste of resources. This is clearly part of Trump's ruse to create a fake emergency on the border, and he shouldn't use servicemembers as stand-ins for his wall.
This dubious deployment kept thousands of servicemembers away from home over the holidays. The National Guard has been on the border since the spring, and now active-duty soldiers will be there for another 8 months, undermining our readiness and troop morale. https://t.co/DmAyVguROX

“I work at EPA. We need to shame the President by showing him what the effects are of his shutdown.”		I agree — our airports our less safe, law enforcement agencies aren’t getting paid, and federal workers &amp; contractors are suffering. It’s unconscionable. #TrumpShutdown
“My husband is an interior employee. Thank you for holding strong against the President.”		“I am proud to work for the Federal government at the SEC. I have 36 years of experience.”		Thanks to you and your families for your service. Keep holding strong and we’ll get through this.

“Can the President just start building the wall if he declares an emergency?”		No he cannot. We will fight it in Congress and in the courts, but it will be an uphill battle. He wants to declare a manufactured emergency because as he said, he “can’t make a deal.” #ShutdownTownHall
“What should federal workers do while we wait?”		Take care of yourself and your family. We need your passion for public service so please continue to serve, understanding it can be difficult when we have a President who makes it his mission to undermine civil servants.
Constituent and employee from @CommerceGov: “We are at an impasse. Is it likely that Congress could override a veto with 2/3 vote?”		Sen. McConnell must bring these spending bills to the floor. Let the President veto it or not, and we’ll do the job Congress is meant to do.
“How long is this going to last?”		The ball is in the President’s court. Republicans &amp; Democrats want to open the government, but Trump reneged on the deal he made and now refuses to negotiate. The President could end this at any point. #ShutdownTownHall

Trump shut down the government because his friends on the far-right were criticizing him on TV.

If the President doesn’t end the shutdown this week, workers are likely not going to be paid for a month. They’re struggling to stay in their homes, afford their prescriptions and pay their bills.

Congress is not going to give Trump his wall money, so Trump thinks he can build the wall 	by executive fiat and ignore the will of the people.		Using emergency executive authority – typically reserved for times of war – to access funding for the wall would be unprecedented. https://t.co/Tu5fq9Ci6B

By encouraging the use of apprenticeships instead of unpaid internships, prioritizing STEM education and dual-enrollment, and enlisting the private sector and educational institutions as partners, we can reinvigorate American manufacturing and our workforce.
Congress has to make it easier for Americans to switch jobs. A welder or technician in a GM factory should be able to easily access the training needed to do a similar job in a high-tech industry. We can’t rely on the private sector alone – we have to invest in American workers.
The GM layoffs show the economy isn’t working for everyone. Congress must focus less on corporate tax cuts and more on investing in workers. We must use every resource available to us to make sure the workforce is developed and able to cope with sudden manufacturing shifts. https://t.co/SiQ0Dpt5tn
Trump can’t use the military as his play-thing because he can’t get his absurd border wall. There is no invading army, and this irresponsible use of the military reveals Trump’s lack of understanding for the sacrifice servicemembers and their families make for this country.
Two weeks ago the Pentagon said the mission was ending. Now 7,000 servicemembers will be on the border for Christmas instead of at home with their families.		What changed? Nothing, except the fact that the President isn't getting the border wall funding he wants. https://t.co/tKxnNy0OQl
Trump calls our men and women in uniform ‘his military,’ but continues to show through his dubious border deployment, his denigration of veterans, and his indifference toward the members of 'his' military, that he doesn't understand the sacrifice soldiers and their families make.
The national security threat on the border is trumped up. There is no invading army, and there is no need for a deployment of active duty personnel. The 1.3 million men &amp; women who make up our armed forces aren't toy soldiers, and the President can't continue to use them as such.
The President once again confirmed what I have long suspected: he is deploying the military, degrading our readiness, and demoralizing our troops because he can’t get his border wall. It’s a disservice to our men and women uniform, and betrays those of us who have served. https://t.co/g1jyi0rsef
The administration can’t continue to use the border and military as means to a political end. Behind every soldier is a family, and using them as pawns in a political game shows military families that the President doesn’t understand the sacrifice they make.
Deploying the military doesn’t fix the backlog and doesn’t add value to border enforcement. Authorizing the military to conduct law enforcement in violation of long-standing statutes is equally unproductive, and puts our men and women in uniform at risk of breaking the law.
The Trump administration and their allies can’t continue to irresponsibly dial up the rhetoric; they must present the facts. This isn’t an invading army -- this is a group of asylum seekers who are stranded in Mexico as a result of a backlog in our immigration system.
We have no idea what the cost will be, nor do we know just how detrimental this deployment will be for troop readiness. However, we do know that this is a demoralizing deployment for our servicemembers, and we do know we don’t need the military to conduct border enforcement.
The Trump administration's militarization of the border is heavy-handed, and is made worse by the lack of a long-term, comprehensive strategy. We have yet to see a detailed justification, and the recent authorization may lead to illegal and disproportionate actions on the border. https://t.co/6MTuQyO4HK

My bill, the HARD HAT act, would help workers and contractors in the construction industry. By increasing investment in apprenticeship programs, construction workers would have opportunities to get paid, on-the-job training to sustain their careers even after the job is done.
The return on investment for employers is also impressive — international studies suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers may get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity, reduced waste and greater front-line innovation.
Job-driven apprenticeships are among the surest pathways to provide American workers with the skills they need to acquire good-paying jobs and grow the economy. Every American who wants a job and is willing to work should have a job and be able to support their family.
This week is #NationalApprenticeshipWeek -- a reminder that millions of jobs go unfilled because companies can’t find qualified employees. We must invest more in DOL-recognized apprenticeship programs that allow Americans to have paid on-the-job training.		https://t.co/1mprVGulOO

@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats @RepCarbajal But protecting victims isn't a partisan issue.

@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats I’m proud to cosponsor @RepCarbajal’s Gun Violence Restraining Order Act that would permit every court in the U.S. to issue gun violence prevention orders to abusers, preventing them from purchasing a weapon. This change would be real progress for domestic violence victims.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats Domestic violence does not discriminate. Its impact is felt in every community, and it’s on us to stand up for and protect victims. Democrats have introduced a number of bills that would change the lives of victims everywhere.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseDemocrats It is up to us to ensure that no one who exhibits and is convicted of violent behavior is able to purchase a weapon. After my cousin was killed by an estranged boyfriend, I made it my mission to pass legislation in Maryland that would protect victims of domestic violence.
@JacksonLeeTX18 In Congress, I introduced the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act which would prevent abusers and stalkers from purchasing firearms. I’m glad these provisions were included in @HouseDemocrats' #VAWA bill.
When 20 people every minute suffer abuse at the hands of an intimate partner in the United States, there is always more Congress can do to help those who need protection under the law. @JacksonLeeTX18’s Democratic #VAWA is a life-or-death bill for America’s women.

We must give Dr. Ford a fair opportunity to tell her side of the story. America has failed to stand up for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault over and over again. This time, we have to get it right -- we owe it to survivors everywhere.
Dr. Ford’s courageous decision to speak out is indivisible from the courage it takes for survivors of domestic violence to come forward. Her allegations should be treated with respect, as should the stories of victims of domestic and sexual violence across the country.
Victims of sexual violence and domestic violence live a similar experience -- their lives are dominated by silence, shame and powerlessness. We must stop and listen to the victims. Too often do we delegitimize their stories. Too often do they suffer more for coming forward.
They are rarely listened to or taken seriously, and are often blamed for the violence they endure. My cousin Cathy was a victim; murdered by her ex-boyfriend because their relationship ended. She did nothing wrong.
Through my work with domestic violence victims and my time spent on bills to prevent abusers from owning firearms, protect unemployment benefits for victims and extend protective orders, I understand how hard it is for victims to break the cycle of violence.
I have long advocated for protecting victims of domestic violence and doing everything we can to punish perpetrators and ensure they can’t continue or escalate their cycles of violence.

I fully support GSA and the FBI returning to its original plan to build a fully consolidated FBI headquarters at one of the sites selected in the initial procurement.
Earlier this year Congress did not fund Trump’s plan, and now we need honest answers on a realistic way forward that does not further delay the delivery of a new consolidated FBI headquarters or cost taxpayers more money.
The FBI requires a modern, consolidated and secure headquarters as a matter of national security. Trump's plan to keep the FBI at its current location clearly misses the mark, is unsafe and does not meet the long-held needs of the FBI or previous Congressional authorization.
The OIG’s review raises serious concerns that President Trump has politicized this national security project in a way that hurts the men and women of the FBI - an agency he has long attacked - and protects his bottom line.
The GSA OIG's review of the revised plan for the FBI HQ project confirms what I suspected: heavy-handed involvement by the White House; misleading analysis of President Trump’s preference to keep the FBI in its old facility; and a nefarious lack of transparency with Congress. https://t.co/0xkkglOA6H

When hate and fear rears its ugly head, we must stand united in love and defend all who are targeted. We must stand united in our commitment to pursue equality and justice.
As we mark the one year anniversary of the violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, and honor the memory of Heather Heyer, we stand united in rejecting the worst impulses of racism and xenophobia that have long fractured our nation.
America is strong because we, the people, are bonded by shared values of life, liberty and the self-evident truth that all people are created equal.

Republicans should stop wasting the country’s time by treating immigration like a political football. We must come together to solve the serious immigration issues of our time.
There are legitimate questions regarding how ICE conducts its mission, and whether the agency’s enforcement priorities are aligned with American values. These questions must be answered, and will only be answered through a comprehensive immigration policy debate in Congress.
No agency – ICE included, should be shielded from criticism. We need an agency to carry out ICE’s functions and to detain those who have committed serious crimes, but that does not give the leaders at ICE and DHS immunity from critique or Congressional oversight.
However, the priorities of those leading ICE’s enforcement and removal operations (ERO) have overshadowed the important work of its homeland security investigations (HSI), and have actually undermined ERO agents.
Let me be clear – I support the men and women who carry out the lawful mission of ICE. They do important work investigating cross-border crimes such as drug trafficking, the theft of intellectual property, child pornography and human trafficking.
Today I voted against H.Res.990 that Republicans offered as a political stunt. House Republicans continue to bring items to the floor that only serve blatant partisan interests, instead of serving the American people's interests. They're treating immigration as a political game.

But there must be independent verification to ensure North Korea eliminates their nuclear weapons and capacity to create more, there must be a roadmap for ensuring North Korea does not break its promises, and Kim Jong Un must commit to respecting the human rights of his people.
This made-for-TV summit has elevated North Korea – a despotic regime that tortures its own people. It gave Kim Jong Un exactly what he wanted: a meeting with the President, changes to our military posture, and assurances that the U.S. will reconsider sanctions.
I believe that diplomacy can lead to denuclearization, especially by maintaining tough sanctions with the support of a coalition of allies led by the U.S. This #PhotoOpSummit, however, has not changed the fact that a nuclear-armed North Korea remains a global threat.

While President Trump has shown a reckless eagerness to tear up the JCPOA, he has yet to articulate a strategy for how to confront Iran and guarantee they do not obtain a nuclear weapon. Trump’s withdrawal will have dangerous consequences for the international community.
Rather than making this impulsive and politically motivated decision that undermines American credibility and leadership, the President should work with our allies on a responsible path forward that increases rigorous enforcement and addresses flaws in the JCPOA.
A nuclear-armed Iran today or anytime in the future is unacceptable. The #IranDeal is imperfect, but has constrained Iran’s uranium enrichment program. It is a mistake to walk away. It is a bigger mistake to do so unilaterally.

Young people have a choice: let extremists breed division &amp; ensure nothing will change. Or you can say now is a different time #UMDreflects

I remain hopeful that by working together, we can continue to heal and move beyond our old racial wounds #UMDreflects
We talk about foreign terrorists but cannot ignore radical alt right homegrown terrorists, which pose an internal threat to our country
Hate speech cannot spread unchallenged. Academic debate cannot lead to inaction that creates a breeding ground for prejudice &amp; violence
We have to say enough is enough to the alt right &amp; hate &amp; extremism. And to the leaders who have simply looked the other way #UMDreflects
Anger has emboldened extremists - just as it has throughout history - to widen divisions and block paths to understanding #UMDreflects
They’ve worked hard all their lives only to see their jobs shipped overseas, their wages not growing &amp; their families not getting ahead
Recognize that many working &amp; middle-class white Americans resent policies that level the playing field supposedly at their expense
We can trace the racial issues that exist today to the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow - unequal opportunities, mass incarceration
These issues reflect the complexities of race &amp; prejudice in this country; issues that we've never fully worked through #UMDreflects
Must be obtuse not to see connection between the rise of Donald Trump and the emboldening of these extremists on campus &amp; across the country
Colleges are being targeted because they embrace diversity, tolerance &amp; social justice; Strive for equality and have created safe spaces
There’s been unprecedented spike in racist &amp; hate activity on campuses where white nationalists &amp; extremists feel safe operating in public

@SpeakerRyan @FBI #ComeyHearing shows we need the #FIREDAct to ensure the FBI director won't be fired without good cause so investigations remain autonomous.
.@SpeakerRyan stated WH &amp; @FBI need to be independent. I couldn’t agree more! Investigations should be immune to impulses of any President. https://t.co/YLvnhnvBgh
#ComeyHearing shows President Trump repeatedly tried to influence the FBI’s investigation on Flynn’s ties w/ Russia https://t.co/rhcg77SFvD
@GOP @CFPB #WrongChoiceAct is extremely harmful for seniors, veterans, small businesses and hardworking Americans across the country.
@GOP We passed #DoddFrank &amp; created @CFPB to protect our under-served communities &amp; delivered $12 billion in relief to 29 million consumers. https://t.co/4EDdT47XSF
@GOP Nationally, black homeowners were disproportionately affected by foreclosure crisis &amp; 80% more likely to lose their homes.
@GOP #MD04 is STILL dealing with the consequences of irresponsible, under-regulated financial institutions who targeted unsuspecting borrowers.
.@GOP wants to revert to a system that created the '08 crisis &amp; wiped out a generation’s wealth #WrongChoiceAct https://t.co/QimhyxyWCP
Providing people an account of what happened is the important first step in preventing any country from meddling in our democracy again.
Following the #ComeyHearing, Congress must be relentless in our effort to discover the facts related to Russian interference in US elections
The FBI must be free to carry out its mission in the most effective way possible and #FollowTheFacts wherever they lead.
That’s why I introduced the #FIREDAct last month to ensure the FBI director cannot be terminated without reasonable cause. https://t.co/tNBriVxRzt
The FBI must remain independent from the partisan whims of any President – Comey was fired for refusing to bend to Trump’s wishes.

@HouseGOP .@CFPB has returned nearly $12 billion to 29 million victims since 2011. Scaling back #DoddFrank is absolutely the #WrongChoice
The only choice on the #WrongChoice Act – vote NO. @HouseGOP must’ve forgotten about the 11 million homes lost &amp; 10% unemployment rate https://t.co/dWHpAgvTaL

@MNADV A safe home is a human right. @NNEDV fights for that every day. We need to ensure our children, family &amp; neighbors aren’t subjected to abuse
Personal thank you to @MNADV for the work they do on behalf of all Marylanders in ending #DomesticViolence in our communities.
We have a moral responsibility to safeguard people from all forms of #DomesticViolence. That includes stalking. https://t.co/JCrkxeLzuT

This is a step forward. As we seek justice for #RichardCollinsIII, we need a sustained commitment to rid our campuses of hate &amp; extremism https://t.co/PC3w39okUP
Older Americans - who often live paycheck to paycheck - will pay 800% more for #TrumpCare. Might as well throw granny off the cliff https://t.co/kCRMjWAMU8
Watch my full remarks on life and death of #RichardCollinsIII &amp; rising tide of campus hate and racism here: https://t.co/TNYfLzxiCF
In the absence of real change, we protest, hold vigils &amp; take to the streets. #RichardCollins deserves better. Our children deserve better
To prevent another #RichardCollinsIII, hate and racism need to also be addressed in our neighborhoods, workplaces, &amp; criminal justice system
Hate speech is not protected. Encouraging dialogue cannot lead to inaction that creates a breeding ground for prejudice &amp; violent hatred
To stop hate we must take a stand against the radical right &amp; hate festering on campus, and leaders who remain silent &amp; look the other way
CBO score reaffirms what we already knew - #TrumpCare is a disaster, filled with broken promises, hurts the sick &amp; the  poor #dumpsterfire https://t.co/YgiLFGD2Y3
I’m calling on @realDonaldTrump to break his shameful silence &amp; denounce the hate-fueled killing of a black soldier #RichardCollinsIII
You have to be purposefully ignorant to not see a direct line from the recent elections to the emboldening of these racist perpetrators
But this is a national problem. There’s been an unprecedented spike in racist and hate activity on campuses since November
This isn’t the first incident of hate at UMD. There's been anti-immigrant chalkings, racist flyers &amp; a noose was found in a campus frat
#RichardCollinsIII murderer was a member of a racist neo-nazi group. He was a domestic terrorist, radicalized on our university campus
#RichardCollinsIII murder was not some random act of violence. It was a heinous, despicable and unprovoked crime of hate
On Sat while waiting for an Uber, a UMD student demanded he “Step left if you know what’s best for you.” Richard said “No.” He was killed
He loved lacrosse &amp; soccer. His friends &amp; family said he “had a loving &amp; giving heart” and “would go out of his way … to try &amp; help others”
#RichardCollinsIII was ready to graduate from @BowieState yesterday. He was commissioned as Army 2LT, following in footsteps of his father

When Dems introduced #ACA we held 79 hearings, heard from 181 witnesses &amp; posted the bill online for 30 days. GOP has done none of these
There are many unanswered questions: how will this impact our hospitals, how many people will lose the health coverage they have right now
The GOP kept this proposal under lock &amp;  key for a reason. Not a single hearing. We don't know how much this will cost
The GOP proposal also includes a big tax break for health insurance executives making more than $500,000: https://t.co/D4UHmVEISi
Why does GOP gut Medicaid? To give huge tax cuts for the wealthy. The 400 wealthiest households will receive annual tax cuts of $7M each
GOP plan for #Medicaid would hurt working poor, children, seniors &amp; people with disabilities that rely on it. This is wrong &amp; disgraceful
GOP plan to 'modernize' #Medicaid turns the program into a block grant that shifts costs to the states &amp; will lead to massive cuts
Most concerning is that nearly 30,000 men, women and children in my District covered by Medicaid now stand to lose quality health coverage
The GOP will strip out preventive care from the #ACA that enable all Americans to get free cancer &amp; chronic disease screenings, vaccinations
But this plan will raise costs for working families. If you're 60 years old your insurance bill will go up by $3,200 a year https://t.co/KKxBu7ybmp
More than 12,000 of my constituents receive financial assistance under the #ACA. Almost all of them will get less help under the GOP plan
After 7 years of repeal votes the GOP finally released their health care plan. This proposal is bad for seniors, the poor &amp; for the sick
