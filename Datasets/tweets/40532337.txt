@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes @virginiafoxx .@BGOV subscribers can go into more detail here:		https://t.co/RpQcA7BOgD
@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes Neither House Dems or GOP embraced the idea - @virginiafoxx's spox called it complex (but said they were open to a discussion on it) and an aide on the Dem side said they were worried it wouldn't encourage colleges to make tuition more affordable.
@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes So I looked into it and found that if Alexander wants to do this, he has some people to convince.		Setting up a system to make that work would be difficult. Borrowers would need to tell their employers they have loans (although not the amount.)
@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes One thing that I'd never heard before Monday though was him promoting the idea that student loan payments should be automatically taken from a borrower's paycheck. 		It's not a new idea, but I'd just never heard the top Senator on the education committee promote it
@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes (He legit just pulled the FAFSA form out while I was typing that.)
@SenAlexander @insidehighered @nytimes Most of the stuff we're hearing from Alexander is not new - we knew he didn't like the cohort default rate. We knew he wanted to reduce the number of ways to repay your loan. The taped-together FAFSA prop is iconic (to education wonks at least)

Alexander proposed having students repay their loans automatically via taking income-based repayments out of their paychecks - @delislealleges mentions that might be hard to do as people would need to tell their employers they have student debt.
Alexander says the higher education bill will include a component on campus sexual assault, a main priority for @PattyMurray  -- notes this will not be an easy issue for the committee.
Upcoming (bipartisan!) legislation: a FAFSA simplification bill to reduce questions from 108 to 15-25.		Also re-introducing a bill making it easier for IRS to share information on students with @usedgov for financial aid purposes

@usedgov @BGOV Congrats, you made it to the end of the thread. Enjoy your weekend!
@usedgov @BGOV If the reg goes into effect, colleges can no longer require students settle complaints in arbitration.		Also, thousands of students could potentially see their loans automatically forgiven through closed school discharge.
@usedgov @BGOV The borrower defense regulation is usually tied to students having their loans forgiven if their college misled them when it was recruiting them.		But there are some more immediate impacts if the rule goes into effect
@usedgov If you get the @BGOV "What to Know" newsletter, then you knew on Wednesday that Judge Randolph Moss expressed skepticism in court that the group of for-profit schools bringing the other suit had the standing to do so.
@usedgov Everyone (including @usedgov) is waiting to see if the judge delays all or part of the regulation in different but related lawsuit.		We don't know when that would happen, but it will likely be soon.
The @usedgov technically has more time to try to issue another delay of the rule - perhaps one that could withstand a court challenge.		But a department spokesman said that's not going to happen.
New deadline for when the borrower defense regulation could potentially go into effect: Oct 16, 12 p.m.		(Federal judge just moved it)
@SenJeffMerkley @PattyMurray Merkley's bill is a piece of a much larger puzzle - but it gives a good idea of what Senate Dems are thinking when it comes to changing how student loan repayment works. 		@BGOV subscribers can read more here:	https://t.co/hEPeNQJ3MT
@SenJeffMerkley While @PattyMurray (ranking member of the Senate committee dealing with education) is not listed as a co-sponsor, her office told me she supports the bill. 		But she also wants to see bipartisan negotiations take place on a more comprehensive higher ed bill 3/x
@SenJeffMerkley The bill has the backing of several other Democrats, but has some provisions similar to GOP higher education bill (reducing loan repayment to one fixed-payment plan and one income-driven one, eliminating origination fees, etc.) 2/x
When you think of lawmakers that are involved in higher education, @SenJeffMerkley doesn't often come to mind (he's not even on the committee.)		But you should probably pay attention to his latest bill on student loans. 1/x

@nathanbarnold Changing it to get the data from the IRS is possible, but they don't expect to have the rest of the regulation done by Nov. 1
@nathanbarnold I was also told that because the GE reg specifically mentions SSA (not the IRS) that the data needs to come from SSA.

.@usedgov has not given up on rewriting the regulation. But the delay means more time for opponents of the rewritten Trump regulations to sue and for those cases to go through the courts.
All eyes are now on Oct. 12 when a federal judge will decide if the 2016 never-implemented-because-it-was-delayed borrower defense regulation will go into effect.		If so, it could be in effect until July 2020
The 2014 gainful employment reg is in effect, and the ED is collecting data. 		BUT the data on student earnings is supposed to come from Social Security Admin. And the data sharing agreement between ED and SSA expired in May ‚Äî so currently no way to calculate debt-to-earnings
For starters, if you‚Äôve been following borrower defense, you know the dept proposed only allowing those who defaulted on their loans to apply for relief. 		That won‚Äôt be in a final regulation according to an administration official
Last night, @usedgov said they would miss a crucial Nov. 1 deadline to finalize two regulation on loan forgiveness (borrower defense) and measuring vocational programs by what students earn v loan payments (gainful employment)		But that was not the only news

Here's what I wrote back in July  about the Perkins Loan "extension" in the Labor-H bill. The provision to help schools keep servicing current loans is in both the House and Senate bill https://t.co/uVYyz7lwH8

@kreighbaum Right! It was approved by committee but has yet to pass either chamber
@kreighbaum There is language about Perkins Loan in the LaborH approps bill. I don‚Äôt recall exactly what it said but I think it helps fund the loans for students who already have the loans and would have lost them next year

Non-surprisingly, each of the top Dems on the House and Senate education committee has already come out condemning the move.		Surprisingly, my computer has decided to stop screen-shooting things so---
6. ED estimates the rule would cost taxpayers $5.3 billion compared to the previous rule as more programs would be eligible for federal funding (and, by extension, more students would need federal student aid.)
5. ED is getting rid of two other disclosures in the gainful employment reg: 		One required for-profit schools to warn students if repayment rates dropped below a certain standard		The other to notifies students if the school had to provide proof of financial protection
4. ED is skeptical about how schools calculate job placement rates, saying there is "significant variation in methodologies" schools use. Notes community colleges in Colo. to report any job where a graduate is paid a wage
3. ED says they are interested in comments on whether all programs should disclose info on "net price, program size, completion rates, and accreditation and licensing requirements, on their program web pages"
ED also says a change in interest rates by a single percentage could change the number of schools who  pass, fail or are in the zone for the measure
2. ED argues vocational programs are necessary for a strong workforce and serve women, minorities and low-income students - says they should not be subject to higher scrutiny than other programs
Some things on this morning's rule that ends the gainful employment regulation-		1. ED says they will update the College Scorecard with program-level data on student earnings and debt
