More from Jon's AMA: As for a meat that folks generally shy away from , "you could take a whole shank, and roast in a slow cooker and it's going to be fantastic. Every kind of meat can be a delicacy, it's all about your spices and rubs and the way you cook it."
Here's a tidbit from butcher Jon Viner's AMA: the cheapest and best way to disinfect a cutting surface is to use is 1 Tbs of bleach to one gallon of water to sanitize. Hand-washing is actually most important of all - that's where you get most of your cross contamination.
