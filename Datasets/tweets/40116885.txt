@mattyglesias If I remember correctly, Fred Thompson in 1995
Talking too fast, but it’s got to be hard not to be nervous
I’m not a fan of the SOTU as an event, but with Trump putting even more emphasis on recognizing people in the gallery it’s becoming, in large part, a civil ritual about both parties honoring extraordinary Americans
Tonight showed why Trump waited to give his SOTU in the House chamber—few events are set up to put a president in a better light or give him higher-profile, more appealing platform
If all he did was give speeches like this, he’d be at 50%

Nice shout-out to the women in Congress
The modern-day suffragettes have to look around and decide whether they want to demonstrably support women’s economic gains or not
Democrats tentatively and reluctantly decide to applaud saving women from sex trafficking
Prior to Trump, the problem with the GOP posture on immigration was the rote formulation that illegal immigration is bad (true) and legal immigration is unquestionably and always good (not true). Trump hasn’t changed this thinking but doubled down on it

On the other hand, normal dynamic of negotiations suggests that if this is his initial offer, he would get less/give more in any final deal. Which would be a big comedown from what his supporters hoped a shutdown would accomplish  		https://t.co/cTtFoMVRsp
Trump is definitely better when he’s not sitting at a desk for these kind of speeches
Since Trump currently has ownership of the shutdown, it makes sense to be the one making a big, public offer to try to shift the public perception. This will at least make Senate Democrats filibuster a bill to re-open the govt w/ a number of immigration initiatives they support

@Austan_Goolsbee It’s not. But people convinced our system of government is fundamentally corrupt and repressive, and unfairly arrayed against them, have considered this option from Hartford to South Carolina
@jonathanchait And please excuse my poor grammar
@jonathanchait Finally, a point I didn’t get to is if our current system of government is really intolerable to California it can secede or split up into several states, which would be more realistic than amending the Constitution
@jonathanchait And that it would be better to win senate races rather than fantasize about something that isn’t going to happen
@jonathanchait That the Constitution says the 2 senator per state arrangement can’t be amended. Even if you did it. It would require a super majority including some smallish states, so it isn’t realistic
@jonathanchait That coastal rule of the sort he Left would want would be a mistake
@jonathanchait That Democrats used to be able to appeal much more to the middle of the country
@jonathanchait That the House, as designed, does give California representation in keeping with its massive population advantage
@jonathanchait That the Senate and Electoral College ensure that flyover country aren’t ignored
@jonathanchait That the Senate, and the Constitution generally, recognize the importance of the states as such
@jonathanchait I point out population disparities have always been part of the senate—indeed this was the point

@NateSilver538 if you are going to hang someone on lying, you need to be precise. if he had been asked if he attended a keg party, and said no, that would be a clear deception. the rest of this is just hostile presumption and guesses--like what you did with Devil's Triangle
@NateSilver538 again, the back-and-forth on drinking tended to be vague. Here is more of the context of his "basically no" answer: "As to the first, I think the answer to that is basically no. I don’t know really what you mean by that, like, what — what are you talking about?"
@NateSilver538 You can drink a lot and not black out. The common definition of blacking out as I take it is going blank for hours such that you might have assaulted someone without knowing it. Many of us have been very drunk in our lifetimes and never experienced anything like that
Again, teenage boys make up random names for things. Here is the yearbook entry of the kid who probably came up with the name Devil's Triangle. If you have never heard of this drinking game it's b/c you weren't friends w/ this kid in the early 1980's		https://t.co/7Y2XCmvX71

@NateSilver538 also, in his testimony, he admitted drinking to excess and otherwise was broad and vague. he wasn't asked about keg parties, or bar-room scuffles, or any of this other stuff etc. so there is no way he lied about it. again, your methodology is seat-of-the-pants here
@NateSilver538 The problem with your methodology is that you are not accounting for an inflamed opposition that will accuse of him lying about anything, then you say b/c he's accused of lying about many thins he must be guilty of lying about something. This is not rigorous, to say the least

I was skeptical that the campaign finance angle to the payments would become a big deal, but this is a big deal. Doesn’t really change the impeachment calculus, though: Democrats will find a reason to impeach if they take the House w/ big enough #s; GOP won’t abandon Trump.

@jbarro Definitely in the short term
@sinkspur Yep
This means absent a miracle from the 9th circuit and/or congressional action, the administration will have insufficient space and legal authority to truly carry out the new policy
The problem is that my understanding is that DHS only has 3 family facilities currently (one of which is in PA), and the Flores Decree limits how long kids can be held to 20 days
The hope is also to expedite the adjudication of asylum claims considerably, and perhaps have hearings at the facilities
Regarding families, the model now is to hold adults and children together in DHS facilities and have DHS and the U.S. Marshalls take and return adults to court dates
There’s been some confusion about this, but zero tolerance remains in place. There may even be more prosecutions of single adults

In a more rational world, that the Republicans just handily passed a bill to keep the government open out of the House, with the support of the Republican president, should make it at least a little more difficult to blame the GOP for a shutdown
Sen. Markey repeatedly dodged when @ErinBurnett asked him, entirely reasonable and fairly, whether he was OK w/ the govt shutting down. Shows how this gambit will be more awkward for Democrats than they think

The problem with the bi-partisan DACA negotiations is that the Gang Of 6 basically all have the same view on immigration. It’s not party that’s most important here, but whether you are a dove or a hawk. A negotiation between, say,Dick Durbin &amp; Tom Cotton would be more meaningful
