@AOC Huh.   Interesting.   Guess you didn‚Äôt entertain it enough or look hard enough for funding.   It‚Äôs out there so stop dividing with ignorance.   Green deal brown deal ...  all nonsense when we the people just want you to leave us alone

@KamalaHarris Planning parenthood??  More like planning to kill.   I am for every persons right to choose but killing is killing.   Thousands want babies.   Change the law to make it easier to adopt
@CoryBooker @realDonaldTrump jump on the bandwagon and get this done.  This is not going to be easy for some of your base but it‚Äôs a legitimate issue.  We are supposed to be free and the people have said over and over state by state that they do not believe it is evil or immoral.  Freedom??
@CoryBooker Agree with this.   I don‚Äôt agree with you much but imprisoning anyone for something less dangerous than alcohol is absurd.   In my humble opinion it should be legal to have and grow if desired.   It‚Äôs a plant that causes a person to be hungry and laugh for heavens sake.
@RealJamesWoods It‚Äôs nice to have a public person share their opinions.   Thanks for keeping it real

@ewarren It is not simply ban assault weapons.   The point is for ‚Äúprotection‚Äù of ourselves rather they be domestic or foreign.   No one I know wants to harm only to protect one another.   Banning our ability to own isn‚Äôt about a moral issue.   Murder is a moral issue.   Teach love

@cmauler89 @Bevleslie1 @SenatorTomUdall @SenateGOP @POTUS You obviously have been taught a huge pile of nonsense.   For one the Americas WERE originally all inhabited by native Americans.

@cmauler89 @Bevleslie1 @SenatorTomUdall @SenateGOP @POTUS If your speaking of race then you are way off base.    This country of ours started brown skinned.

@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Your profile says I love my family right?
@mfly1971 @OZ_lareece That‚Äôs funny man.   Obama was caught on mic saying he could talk behind the scenes etc.   He ain‚Äôt a commie
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 I haven‚Äôt seen the siding against anyone other than attacking party people .   All I‚Äôve seen is attacks towards him from hating now but loved the guy before.   He obviously hated O and O paid him back by listening to him and his old lady in Trumps bugged house. I‚Äôd be mad 2
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Man that was his dad.   I ain‚Äôt my dad .   You??    Today is different
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 I used to handle all my shot with anger and blowing up and seeing the worst in all situations.   Then when I really opened my eyes things changed.   We all got the shot.   All we got is family love and respect.   Anger never fixed but physical fights where I had to have it
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 What if he‚Äôs doing this to make it better for the guys like me breaking their backs working for their families.   Guys doing what I shoulda had growing up.   Staying with my kids.   Staying with their mother.    Trying my best to be different.  Trying to change what a man means
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 I don‚Äôt know about his voice.   He built crap for a living talking to contractors.   Contractors talk like normal people and not fancy words.   He can‚Äôt talk like the politicians because he isn‚Äôt.
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Man I thought the people repping the poorest of us was out for all of us with the union talk and all that but the pudding shows the opposite
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 It was in my opinion a game changer.  He said basically look here‚Äôs the deal you all are trying to divide us but I want to do this to make it better for the people not big companies.   He had the Dems cheering and chanting USA then they turned it around.  He was super respectful
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Thanks for not attacking.   Really in a honest way since words can‚Äôt show emotion.   We can‚Äôt think together with em dividing us all and us mad.   Hell I was mad too about some things but turns out wasn‚Äôt so.
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 It goes on and on.   Many in my family thought he was something he has shown he isn‚Äôt.   I just think he‚Äôs the first one not owned by Corp America.   They paint him bad and he responds shitty on twitter.   It‚Äôs a dumb ass cycle.   But big pic why they attacking him now not b4??
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 https://t.co/o3uid6LBlQ
@mfly1971 @OZ_lareece No way man.
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 https://t.co/cXvLVCE2EC
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 https://t.co/b5aqsls4DR.   They usually dog the guy
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 It was an example of things getting better.   Did you watch his state of the union.   I am a big boy I can handle being treated any way either of you want.    So with that said.
@PattyMurray You and your party are holding us hostage for political gain.   Nonsense!!!   Good thing we ARE paying attention now...Thank God
@PattyMurray Not a day goes by that you or your staff doesn‚Äôt attack. Are you just trying to get him to attack you back so you get a quick route to everybody knowing your name?  Reality is you could walk down New York City with no problem and no one knowing your name.  @realDonaldTrump not so
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 And you don‚Äôt think the shutdown was a Democratic stunt.   Not at all?
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Even my own family members sadly.   Jobs are all over.   Just had a guy walk on a roofing job yesterday and get hired on the spot.   The Country is better.   His twitter is raw but we all can be.   He gave up a ton to be pres.   heck before everybody loved the guy
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Nope no fix news here other than the bits at stores whatever.  I read the legislation nightly after work and try to see what‚Äôs happening.   He is putting more into the poverty stricken neighborhoods than any president in my life.   Trying to get the dope stopped killing
RT @mattsnavely: @RepAdamSchiff Ironically, he‚Äôs the first President we have had that worked tirelessly in the interests of average America‚Ä¶
@RepAdamSchiff Your propaganda isn‚Äôt working.   You all are falling like dominos.   Who can stop it?   Only a JFK like Democrat and you have none in the wings.   All you have are the parties chosen which we don‚Äôt like.
@TommyHicksGOP If previous elected or currently elected have broken the law then they should answer too.
@TommyHicksGOP Don‚Äôt give up.   The fight is worth it.    Fix the budget.   Fix the debt.   Continue to end wars and the killing.   If the only answer to stopping the lawlessness at the border is a wall then built it.  Big strong doors for those needing our safety!  Unite us somehow.
@jmillhouse @TimRunsHisMouth @RobLowe Righhhhhhhttttt.   Hmmmm. Ok
@TalbertSwan @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Huh.    Doesn‚Äôt sound like the kinda stuff I heard Jesus say Bishop.   Are you dividing for gain or dividing for self gratification?  Just curious of corse since we all answer and aren‚Äôt judges.   I hope kindness and Love IS the answer
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Legislation.   Actions.   actions speak.
@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 And when you read my posts they are not rude.   Is what it is.   Better than it was before so.....   good luck to you.   Hope you can see some positive

@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 When you stop hating and look at what can be, anything is possible! Awful lot of hate and disrespectful behavior.  Isn‚Äôt the end of hate what you want?   Sure must be hard to spend all that energy on hating someone for spreading kindness. We all get to choose. Is it blinding you?
Great saying https://t.co/2DoRTdiqAB
@mfly1971 @OZ_lareece Nice..   really shows your level of communication.   Good thing we aren‚Äôt relying on reps acting that way.   Oh yeah they are...

@OZ_lareece @mfly1971 Is that the best you can do to state your ideas.  If everyone responds that way then guess who gets bad representation . That‚Äôs right. all of us. Wise up ain‚Äôt no Dems really on your side.  But if F* is the only word you use then by all means use it.  So intellectually appealing
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ignore the haters!
@C_Sommerfeldt @DonaldJTrumpJr That‚Äôs a stretch he‚Äôs making fun of a person representing us that lies to advance herself.   Hope you start opening your eyes
@RepAlGreen Term limits.   And cuffs if any rep takes $$ from lobbyists
@RepAlGreen Normal people realize that our reps in many places aren‚Äôt really furthering the people‚Äôs agenda.   We see that the agenda you desire doesn‚Äôt really benefit the people.   It merely benefits those that ‚Äúbought‚Äù your political clout. Sad that any of you can be bought.
@RepAlGreen And if you aren‚Äôt racist then is it possible to stop spreading lies that make people think that normal people think this way.   They don‚Äôt.   Normal people realize they didn‚Äôt choose their own skin coloring.

@RepAlGreen Divider you should step down.   You are a disgrace to all of us.   We Americans expect honest representation.  Not some blabbering idiot dividing us
@RepAlGreen You gotta be kidding.  Your fellow Democrat is a racist so the president who does more for my fellow Americans is too.(WRONG). If you call everyone else racist maybe you are the actual racist. How you can spew the propaganda, division and racism when you should be leading w unity
@TomiLahren A real üî•.
@ewarren Whew the odds are not in your favor.
@1776Stonewall Apples do not fall far from the tree!   Attacks for what reason?
@RepAdamSchiff Divider!   And why is it you are fighting to stay at war like status with NK!  Merely to fight anything @realDonaldTrump achieves for us the people.   Better get to bipartisan legislation because the people know what you stand for now and I doubt you ever get re-elected if not
@ewarren Hmm so it‚Äôs ok to lie about your heritage and still be president.   Disgraceful to Native Americans.  Absurd that anyone could believe anything from your camp
@NBCNews Propaganda.   I made more and so did all the people that work with me.   Got more back too.
@sassyblondie1 @PattyMurray Nope just staffers with the same crappy message.   It‚Äôs like the boy who cries wolf.  When we really need them to draw attention to something no one will believe them.
@RealCandaceO @ChelseaClinton She should !
@ewarren Retire

@SenatorTomUdall Good lord I thought for a sec you were going to tweet something that wasn‚Äôt an attack on @realDonaldTrump .  I was wrong, you and your staff are all propaganda.   Last term for you.   Real cowboys are hero‚Äôs not villains full of propaganda. Stop dividing.

@ChelseaClinton I see you are dividing like your lying parents.    He is for the people and you only spread Propaganda.   Hmmm?  you called his daughter a friend once.  Despicable friend you are comparing our President to a horrible mass murderer.  You really should apologize to @realDonaldTrump
@PattyMurray Divisive Party.   Question??   Do you think it‚Äôs ok to take a human that can viably live out of the womb and kill it?   I believe every human answers for themselves and I am not to judge.  I just can‚Äôt see killing a living child wanted by many

The people really only want peace and happiness.
@SenatorSinema thank you for not joining the others and standing up for your people which are on both sides of you mostly bipartisan. I appreciate you applauding ‚Äúwe as a people‚Äôs‚Äù success and the proposition of good legislation.   You are the olive branch we need.  Good for you

@DonaldJTrumpJr It merely is so the cameras can see her ‚Äúdistaste‚Äù for your father.   She represents herself and her lobbyists party.   If she represented anyone other than a party she would have cheered his speech
@KamalaHarris Politicians of the past are at fault.   Wasn‚Äôt Obama in office when this became to be?   Don‚Äôt worry Trump will fix it after you stop attacking him incessantly.  We the people are for him fixing it since he follows through.  The majority of us see he is for us.  Who are you for?
@realDonaldTrump We as a people do not want this.   It  putting all that we were intended to be at risk
@DonaldJTrumpJr Blinded by their own party and affiliations.   And that affiliation is what??  Corrupt lobbyists

@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Are you for allowing 16-17 year olds to vote too!   Are you for adding a State?  Are you for a national voter registry which forces the states to report every citizens party to you?   Are you for all the other inappropriate legislationgoing on?
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump You oppose the people that have died for our freedoms yet you are ok with spying on our president based on a dossier that had no real evidence.   A Dossier funded by a source from where?
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Our country is for anyone who wishes to start with nothing and make a good life.   Material things mean little.   Humanity and our woe has meaning.   Isn‚Äôt America the land of the free?   Are we?   We chose him yet you oppose us
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Yet our countrymen are acting on things in a fashion as such.   If we are all being listened to isn‚Äôt that the equivalent of what congress fought so hard to have not happen here?
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump If you were in his position you would be pissed to.   There are rules in running for President and they all were disregarded and he was spied on.  Him and his family had no privacy and our country was founded on that.   This is KGB stuff not America.   Your investigating Russia
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump You sir deceive so many.

You are going against the people and you have to feel it!
@thebradfordfile @msyoung2222 He does exactly as promised and people seem surprised.   He does what he says and that‚Äôs more than can be said for most of the others
@LadyBleach @thehill Thanks for debating
@LadyBleach @thehill Frances people are revolting.  England wants out of European Union.   China is now largest economy.   We are no longer anything other than muscle and Trump is changing that even with his ahitty way of saying it
@LadyBleach @thehill Govt shutdown was over .42 percent of the budget.   We spend  60.9 billion in Afghanistan in 2015 before him alone in one year.
@LadyBleach @thehill Uh stock market is up almost 10,000 points to 25,000.   Highest recorded
@LadyBleach @thehill Ok so our black ops trained them.   Isn‚Äôt the hidden money the same?   Many many have reported this and many have contested.   Either way wouldn‚Äôt you agree we armed Saddam Hussein then had him killed.   Good friend huh
@LadyBleach @thehill He‚Äôs brash and cocky but he made his fortune on blue color workers and most other than the Atlantic City failure love the man. Jessie Jackson used to praise him.   Oprah praised him. Clinton‚Äôs loved him etc.   big picture why else would they turn on him only when running. Crooked
@LadyBleach @thehill Stopping wars.   Stopping conflicts.   Restructuring trade to be fair.  Fighting extremism.   Ending isis and others
@LadyBleach @thehill It goes on and on.   The point being he is hated because he is an outsider.   Brash or not Trump is doing things for the better of our country
@LadyBleach @thehill We befriended Ho Chi Minh when he came to ask us to help then sided with France over a fake story and killed and lost thousands in the name of ‚ÄúFreedom‚Äù.
@LadyBleach @thehill We sponsored bin laden in Afghanistan against Russia
@LadyBleach @thehill Killing for what?   Weaponizing extremists with horrible killing devices.   Invading Iraq wrongly.  Destabilizing Syria. Causing hatred all across the Middle East towards us when we used to get along until Iran revolted from our putting a puppet in place.   We trained Iraq
@LadyBleach @thehill And the same is true on almost every topic over the past 20 years except war.   War was our industry.
@LadyBleach @thehill They both wanted exactly what Trump is saying on wall documented by video yet they oppose to oppose.   Why??   To regain power
@LadyBleach @thehill I saw the opposite no offense.   Paul Ryan the top GOP guy.   One who if the party is so bad as said was the leader  fought Trump even though his constituents wanted him then quit.   Seems many on both parties are bought by lobbyists. Just look at the flip flop in Chuck and Nancy
@LadyBleach @thehill Read all his transcripts regarding actions that effect us as a whole.   Says good..   less war. Less poverty. Basically a flip flop other than the rhetoric of last several presidents rep or Dem.   why did they both oppose him in the beginning and so many quit??  Corruption
@LadyBleach @thehill Both should be disbanded.  This infighting is against the people‚Äôs wishes.   Anyway have a good day let‚Äôs hope Trump is a good man as opposed to what is being spewed.
@LadyBleach @thehill Yeah and he was hammered over being Mormon.   Judgement for anything.   My LDS friends are good people however the media makes them out to be a cult
@LadyBleach @thehill Ouch.   We definitely are not fascists where I live.   Patriots yes.   Lovers of this amazing country we live in yes.   We desire security, prosperity, kindness, Love, and changing the laws to allow easier immigration as opposed to desperation.  Hopefully they are listening
@LadyBleach @thehill It‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be impossible.   Trump has openly agreed to negotiate however the opposing party would prefer our demise in the name of their own power trip.    They don‚Äôt even stand for what they preached just 3 years ago.   How can they be trustworthy
@thehill Pick one?  How about neither Mr. Booker used to stand for his constituents and lived with them.  Harris well we now know how she got her start.    How about someone with a clean history that is bipartisan
And we are told that the planet is and has been destroyed by us.   What are we to believe? https://t.co/RLWz7h78iO

@hwestonbull_hhh @TomiLahren Wouldn‚Äôt you compare what is happening to Trump as being similar to Clinton during non stop investigations.   Everyone knew who he was and it was reps way of ‚Äúgetting‚Äù him.   Just doesn‚Äôt line up wouldn‚Äôt you say.   Investigations and spying just waiting for a mistake.
@hwestonbull_hhh @TomiLahren I enjoy the communication btw and am in no way intending to be rude.   I used to be a Dem and proudly but sadly most aren‚Äôt really representing the people as I believe they should.  Our representation on both sides have indebted our country and lowered civility in every way.
@hwestonbull_hhh @TomiLahren I would say I agree but why would he endure such agony for himself and his family?  Pride only goes so far and Children generally show good parents.  Wouldn‚Äôt you say his children are and we‚Äôre good citizens?  The trouble with twitter is that it‚Äôs only a text which is emotionless
@hwestonbull_hhh @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump If some children and their parents want the ability to take Christian classes shouldn‚Äôt they be able to?   I learned about Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism and Christianity in school.   What makes one better than the other.
@hwestonbull_hhh @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Did you watch his state of the union last year.   It and his inaugural speech were in my opinion something that could have bridges the parties.   It seems to be all hatred
@hwestonbull_hhh @TomiLahren I‚Äôm for him running again as are almost everyone I know.   Actions speak louder than words and I happen to like the results.   Either way some kindness on both sides could go a long way.    But how do you end the fighting when our representatives won‚Äôt even try
@hwestonbull_hhh @RobertMaguire_ @realDonaldTrump Yet you don‚Äôt bring up the many men that have died for wars he promised to end??   One is not better than the other.   I am not agreeing with everything he says however if I were spies on with my wife I would be just as angry
@safarikova_j @Newsweek Separation of church and state doesn‚Äôt mean that our youth shouldn‚Äôt have the ability to learn about Christianity in schools.   It is intended keep churches from ruling over our leaders.   Then again many of our people don‚Äôt even know the intentions.

@RyanPQ @SenBooker Hilarious.   For what making our economy better, trade deals better , taxes better, security better.  Stopping wars, fixing disagreements with other countries.   Bringing our military home.   Asking others to pay their fair share.   Oh yeah he banged stormy whew.   Yeah that one
@SenBooker What happened to you.   You used to be one of us
@SenatorHassan @POTUS Because of your party
@brhodes @pattythomastpc1 He‚Äôs just as bad as Pelosi.   Many many corrupt politicians
@Catwrangler79 @SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump Will watch later.   At work.   Not a Cruz fan.  He flip flops.  Don‚Äôt trust him.    I was a dedicated Dem for 36 years and changed only because of some Republicans.  @RandPaul  @realDonaldTrump are patriots!   Hopefully the lies being spread will come clean
@Catwrangler79 @SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump What separates us at the border already in parts built by previous admins is a wall not fence. If a wall works to hinder illicit activity in places already it should be built and be beautiful as opposed to the junk installed. We need immigration reform also to enable easier entry
@Catwrangler79 @SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump and calling it medieval is helping?  Non stop negativity as opposed to actual solutions.  If he really is helping why does he and his party members only care about bashing Trump?   Obviously the ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù aren‚Äôt working.  They are supposed to rep us not an agenda to smear Trump
@TSA I just want to thank the staff at CMH! They have worked without pay for us.   Dems hurting our people to attack @realDonaldTrump is ridiculous. Thank you for understanding and believing in our President!  Most of all thank you for keeping us safe in the skies!  Great people
@SenatorTomUdall You and your cronies are the problem!   It‚Äôs a drop in the bucket and we know it.   I just thanked Tsa agents for working and asked their opinion and it wasn‚Äôt in your favor.   They are pissed at your party for this.  You will lose more than you gain with this arrogant behavior
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump Wake up Senator.   We have dealt with the problem for the past 25 + years.   Even your party members have said the same thing in the past!  It‚Äôs about the drugs and illegal activity that hurts migrants and US!  A wall in places IS part of the answer.  Mere politics from you! Stop
@NBCPolitics Propaganda from the fake news and a crooked politician
@PreetBharara Propaganda and division!   Is that all you stand for?
@PattyMurray Mouthpiece for corrupt politicians!   Stop dividing the people and help unite us.   You are failing your constituents
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Stop blaming him when the majority know it‚Äôs you and your counterparts.

Stop undermining us!

@BernieSanders I saved when I made minimum wage.   In fact I said a grand my first year and that was when I made 7.50 an hour.    Saving is freedom yet our people choose to spend and take loans for things they don‚Äôt need.   Give the full story traitor

@thehill Looks like he‚Äôs trying to ‚Äústeal‚Äù it to us as well.   The people chose to have different Senator and he‚Äôs throwing a tantrum on his way out.   Why not retire with pride and thanks to the people he represented as opposed to looking like all other politicians throwing tantrums. Sad
@Jim_Jordan Good luck!   Too bad you are outnumbered by those that do not seem to love our country like yourself!  O H
@RepAdamSchiff Nauseating.    When will you stop the ridiculous attacks.    Remember the people chose him and you!
@SenWhitehouse More division from Sheldon.   Why why why?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because everything on the whole being said and done is to make your father look like a horrible man.    No ones perfect! We deserve to know all of the traitors spreading lies/half truths not just the puppets.  We are supposed to be ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù Governed by the people.
@RealOmarNavarro And you‚Äôre ‚Äúpolitical moves‚Äù are dividing?   Who are you kidding
@repjohnlewis Unite the people with words of wisdom and love that bring the people together. Yesterday‚Äôs ignorance does not condone the behavior on both sides of the isle. Will you be the first to throw away the persona and show the people what MLK and you fought for? Stop the division
@RepBarbaraLee You are politicizing it ma‚Äôam.   Listen to all your constituents.   Using divisive tactics for power is wrong as are the divisive tactics you use.   Sad state for our Dems.   Seems you all are not listening to the people
@ChrisMurphyCT How about you talk about you and what you have to offer.  Slamming the President is wrong.  Sad that our leaders are acting this way.  Disrespectful not only to the office but the 63 million voters that chose him.   You have twisted the words/meaning and you know it.   Wrong!
@RepMaxineWaters Please retire we are tired of you trying to divide us like sheep!   What for?   Power?    Life‚Äôs to short for all this nonsense.   You and Trump need to stop this childish behavior.   Just listen to the nonsense you have said as well!

@BernieSanders All division!   You are rich and powerful? You sir are dividing the people by ethnicity, class, financial ability, and everything else.   Where are the inspiring words from a man ‚Äúrepresenting‚Äù us. Just the hate of your party which we thought you were different than!
@DougFifer @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm no socialist!  Re read my post fresh.   I‚Äôm a conservative with compassion that has earned his keep yet still believes god was specific on what our actions should be
@BiselLyons Thank you beautiful.   Love you girl!   I‚Äôm up as of tonight till Tuesday.   Will see you probably
@DougFifer @realDonaldTrump I have thought long and diligently on this response as it bothered me the most considering our party is supposed to be of conservative principles of Christianity.   What makes one man better than another?  What makes any starving human acceptable? Jesus was specific on this. LOVE
@BiselLyons Always remember that!   When your inner being wants to run be patient and remember those moments when your eyes meet and you heart drops. Love is an action and a feeling
@ScaryCheri02 @realDonaldTrump No, sadly gangs that started in our prisons are now controlling the majority of their country.   If trouble came to us like it has them wouldn‚Äôt you run for your life?  It‚Äôs not black or white.   I‚Äôm a patriot but hate is hate and love is love.   What‚Äôs in your heart?
@DougFifer @realDonaldTrump Poor and starving?   Please do tell me where so I can research all available government programs for them.  I grew up in poverty know welfare well from then.  I have also been to Honduras on mission trips. The people are JUST LIKE US with the exception of no options.  #compassion
@txexss @realDonaldTrump Sadly many begging have more issues than employment.   Drugs, abusive relationships, alcohol, and mental illness seems to be the biggest factors.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President.   I voted for you and support you.   However Hondurans are fleeing for a reason.  Unemployment is low and most are wanting t come here and work!   Change the laws to make it easier for legal immigration.
@SenWhitehouse @SenBlumenthal @maziehirono @uscourts Ha.  You calling it Dark money with your colleagues is funny.
@SenatorTomUdall Only 19 now 20 comments for a Senator.   Do you merely spread opposition no matter what the case is.   I sure hope more than 20 people are paying attention to the division you‚Äôre selling and seeing that you aren‚Äôt listening to your constituents.  Corrupt? Bought?  What is it?
@BernieSanders Bernie Bernie....   you are sounding like the people you separated yourself from for years.   With with him
@MarkWarner Your running out of nonsense to try and sell Sir!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino She‚Äôs a lying corrupt politician.    It sadly has become the norm.
@SenWhitehouse Corrupt divider you
@realDonaldTrump Too bad you can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fired‚Äù to her
@DRUDGE_REPORT What a joke
@SenWhitehouse And still a ‚Äúdig‚Äù. Enough Sheldon you are looking childish
@Jim_Jordan Keep fighting Mr. Speaker!   Soon let‚Äôs hope anyway
@elizabethforma Senator you should have left this alone.   It only makes your political positions look even more ridiculous.    Your Caucasian.   So what!  Who cares what ‚Äúcolor‚Äù any of us are.   You are merely dividing for politics! @realDonaldTrump was right again it seems!  #almostover

@realDonaldTrump Preach it üòÅüëã
@JeffFlake We merely want you to vote what your constituents want!    I do believe the absolute majority agree that this is a political scam by those on the other end of the isle that intend to use you.   Kavanaugh seems to be a good normal man like Most of us
Non stop BS from politics to people.   People are acting inherently evil these days as opposed to loving.    I am disgusted with what has become of our ‚Äúculture‚Äù which seems to be.. say anything because others feelings don‚Äôt matter.
@NBCNews Propaganda machine called NBC
@MarkWarner 104 comments.   Whew Mark you are making some big waves with your propaganda.     NOT
@PattyMurray Rigged...  now that‚Äôs funny.   Isn‚Äôt that what the DNC did with Hillary and still lost.   You are losing credibility Senator.   Imagine long term what your divisive tactics will mean to your name and how people will remember you.  Didn‚Äôt you get into politics for the people?
@SenWhitehouse More division and propaganda from Sheldon.   Disgraceful sir
@SenatorTomUdall More divisive talk from what should be a distinguished Senator.    Have you forgotten those who voted for you?   You are losing us Tom.   The best thing you could do is listen to your constituents.   Your constituents are not with you on the whole
@Jim_Jordan @votetrump77 We appreciate you listening to us! We want you to fight along with @realDonaldTrump to end the era of corruption.   We the People are awake and paying attention.   We see the games being played and are disappointed with the ‚Äúagenda‚Äù of Dems and even a few Repubs.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump All politics and division from you.    You are choosing the wrong side Senator.   We the people chose the man you are fighting.   Think about that.  We The People chose and we expect you to stop playing games and represent US!   Not an agenda
@SenWhitehouse Ahhh.  Reverse psychology...    come on Sheldon we know where the corruption lies..
@RepMaxineWaters You know what opinions are like
@RepMaxineWaters Good lord Maxine now you are claiming he‚Äôs a drunk.    So disrespectful.   We can wait for you to be voted out.    Mere politics from a woman that has no true dignity
@PattyMurray Patty you know better
@SenWhitehouse @FBI Sadly you will go down on the losing side of history as a senator that opposed the success of his own country.   A man who chose to attack the Elected president in any way possible.  A man that went against the wishes of the Majority.   You are a pawn!

@SenatorTomUdall Wow your party has stooped too all time lows.   Disappointed to see a ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù turn into a whimpering temper tantrum throwing Democrat.    Didn‚Äôt Democrats used to be the supposed good guys.    You all look like nothing but greedy politicians these days.   You are no JFK!
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump My opinion of the speech.   This has to be our path forward.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump We are humble, we are CAPABLE we want LOVE, which includes peace.  If you choose to fight, you will find a tough enemy that fight for their rights to be free of oppression .  If you want to honor your own people and traditions and be kind with us then we will honor and love you.
@realDonaldTrump isn‚Äôt this what you were saying in a nutshell. https://t.co/OjINMaQLeA
@cnnbrk We are humble, we are strong and we want love which includes peace.   If you choose to fight with us you will find a tough enemy that fight for their right to be free.  If you want to honor your own people and traditions and be kind with us then we will honor and love you. Choice
@DRUDGE_REPORT Doubt that
@SenatorTomUdall Ahhhh. But it is respectful to use Cubans on interns?    Your party says they are with us ‚Äúlower class‚Äù ‚Äúlower income‚Äù people yet all you do is divide, race bait, and try to turn us against each other.   For what?   Your party‚Äôs greed?
@DRUDGE_REPORT Way to turn it around.
@BreitbartNews Ignorance!    Pinning a horrible label on people that voted for trump is ridiculous!   My family are black white asian and native descent.    I voted for him and I‚Äôm not racist and neither is my black brother!   Breitbart you have turned into dividers and it is sickening
@Tell_Michelle_ Let‚Äôs hope soon!   We were hoping you were going to be another Jim Jordan!   4 the people of the people.    It‚Äôs always politics and power first and the country second.   At least @realDonaldTrump does what he says.   The delivery may be rough but the results are what counts!
@Jim_Jordan Let‚Äôs hope you get more of the reps  with you!   You sir seem to be with us more than many others.  Thank you.
@SenWhitehouse Well if you weren‚Äôt crying wolf all the time we might know what to believe.  Your hatred for @realDonaldTrump is ruining your capacity for the people to trust you! He is OUR president and that includes you!   Work with the man or retire.  Trumps going to be here for years to come
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Absolutely!    While the Dems push division he pushes peace through strength.    So so tired of the nonsense.    Keep it positive and keep the target locked!

@PattyMurray Still trying to divide Patty?   Divider
@Jim_Jordan Keep holding the course!   We want our govt to be for us!   Not a misrepresentation of us from lying corrupt politicians.   Thank you for putting yourself at risk politically to deliver us the truth and leading with our President @realDonaldTrump
@davidbisel4real @realDonaldTrump Funny how Truth when delivered with respect is returned with silence.
@nonya867 @davidbisel4real @realDonaldTrump Why is it ignorant?  Shouldn‚Äôt we know the names of those that were lost.   Shouldn‚Äôt we know if the media is spinning a horrible sad situation that no human could avoid as an attack?   Doesn‚Äôt sound to far fetched to me really.   Truth is truth!   Peace and Love is the answer
@BlacksForDTrump what‚Äôs your perspective on this?   You usually are right on the money. https://t.co/ndxH1w5aco
@davidbisel4real @realDonaldTrump Absolutely ridiculous.  Merely attacks aimed at making our President @realDonaldTrump look as if he is to blame.   Shouldn‚Äôt we know the truth as opposed to what the media portrays!
@davidbisel4real Ouch
@SenatorHassan Imagine that.   We could have guessed this much Senator.   Are you thinking of all of your constituents?    Doesn‚Äôt seem that way.
@Jim_Jordan @BarackObama Yet the news would like to ignore all of this and paint our President as a racist.    It‚Äôs getting so old.   We want this nonsense to end and our politicians get to working, not bashing and acting like spoiled children.   Thank you for having enough common courtesy to be kind!

@SenatorHassan More division from the Dems .   You merely want to divide people for your own political party gain.    Unfortunately the career you began to help people, I assume... won‚Äôt continue past your next election unless you return to why most start in politics

Unite the people and stop bickering
@realDonaldTrump Is Jeff an Ally?   Sure hope you have the States governors etc working together to keep the Union with you!    Aren‚Äôt the governors the key to you reaching us without the negative twitter stuff that you do for ‚Äúratings‚Äù.
@realDonaldTrump No Americans I know believe it either.    Criminal behavior by some associates but let‚Äôs face it.  If we had a tax system where everyone paid the same percentage no one would need to try and move funds to other countries to stop the losses.   Other stuff BS
@therealroseanne Sorry you are dealing with so much crap still.   Respect
@BernieSanders @TomPerez So they don‚Äôt screw people like you anymore.   Why in the world do you stand up for such a corrupt organization???

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dividing Ted
@BernieSanders So all wealthy are bad now and have to be stood up to?   Wealth doesn‚Äôt make the person!   The message starts good then turns divisive.   Disappointing Bernie
@SenWhitehouse Was this ever about Trump and sex?  Bill used a cigar on an intern in the Oval Office.  Should we remind you that the presidency is about our Country and not his sex life.  If that were the case we wouldn‚Äôt be memorializing JFK which was a great president. Playboy yes traitor no!
@SenMarkey It is YOUR job to be bipartisan and make decisions based on your constituents not yourself.   We are getting tired of your deceit and lies to cover your own corruption at every level.    Since when did any of you think it was about yourselves?   Divider
@realDonaldTrump Ahhhh.  He may be more loyal than you think.     The witch hunt has gone nuts!    Hoping it ends!   Win Mr. President
@realDonaldTrump Pardon them all after the witch hunt.   We the people demand it!   We know you are trying to get rid of the corrupt policies and restore our Country and the opposition is trying to lynch anyone connected to you!   You may have been a playboy but the attacks on you are unfounded
@SenWhitehouse @EPA 11.   Lol.    You are losing traction Senator because you are choosing to side with traitors.
@SenWhitehouse @EPA Whew 10 responses.
@RandPaul Agree
@MarkWarner Then many many politicians should be in cuffs!   Maybe the truth will come out more and several more will be.   Both sides are running scared.   Why is that??   ü§î we know!
@SenatorTomUdall @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Real cowboys don‚Äôt sling mud!     Senator a huge part of your constituents side with the president and all you do is bash and try to divide.    We the people are sick of you all turning our govt into a mess!   Work for the people and stop dividing it‚Äôs disgusting
@SenWhitehouse Have you thought about actually working for your constituents some of which are conservatives?   You‚Äôre too busy having staff bash Trump and post dividing thoughts to see we the people are mostly in the middle!
@BernieSanders Be real Bernie.   He dumps all his money to all the employees etc.    what happens?    Rapid inflation etc.   action - reaction.     Not that I wouldn‚Äôt like some but it is his!    We aren‚Äôt communists.    Change your tune and work with the Pres for REAL change!
@SenatorHassan @realDonaldTrump To recap.   If not for Twitter no one outside of your voters would know you even existed.   Truth

@BreitbartNews Propaganda.   Surprised you are publishing this junk.
@senorrinhatch @MissWoke Perfect answer!
@SenWhitehouse @FBI You are so full of it!    Nobody believes this bs you are smoke screening.    You used to care about the people ..  RIGHT??
@realDonaldTrump People lack purpose hence our drug problem!
@stonebraker23 @derekrayS @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Total bs.   Wake up!  He doesn‚Äôt care what color you are.   Neither do the majority of us.    I didn‚Äôt choose neither did you.   Stop hating it‚Äôs unbecoming.   Trump wasn‚Äôt accused of anything except infidelity until he ran!    You prob haven‚Äôt listened to all of his interviews
@MarkWarner Wouldn‚Äôt you be pissed too if you were accused of a bunch of lies and found out you were being spied on for no good reason and in fact it was merely to keep Dem corruption hidden!    Then again both were infiltrated by traitors it seems.   Work for us!
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS @ICEgov Thanks for the honest representation Jim!
@PattyMurray Says the party of division.   Stop dividing and bring the people together.    You have it in you Patty
@realDonaldTrump Mr President while we believe in the job you‚Äôre doing we don‚Äôt need the blow by blow unless it‚Äôs necessary.    We know you kick ass!   We know you need the front to make actual peace.   But just a little less it‚Äôs turning off the middle.   WWG1WGA
@MStev62 @DennisDMZ However he was only accused of things of these sorts by his former ‚Äúfriends‚Äù because he chose to clean up their mess.
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs all smoke and mirrors to hide the past sins
@RealCandaceO Comical!
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS That‚Äôs what they are selling these days.     Anything to hide the criminal conduct.
@SenWhitehouse Like you are doing better by posting this right !!    Come on Senator
@RealJamesWoods Traitor for money
@PattyMurray Hard to believe you these days Patty

@RepMaxineWaters @SenJohnMcCain Oh cool you and the sell out
@RepMaxineWaters We were hoping you were going to schedule that retirement party soon.   For your birthday we were hoping you would give us your notice or better yet no notice and just quit
@BreitbartNews Merely propaganda to try and divide us by race for their own benefit.     Stop the race baiting it‚Äôs getting old.   How about selling a little loyalty to your country as opposed to slinging mud and dividing
@RandPaul Hopefully you will be President one day!   Seems like you are a single voice of reason in a sea of blabbering mud slingers!
@PattyMurray TrumpCare lol.   Come on Patty...   calling ObamaCare that is comical.   He has merely tried to fix the problems with it.   Like penalties for people that don‚Äôt have it nor can afford it.   Spread truth, not lies and innuendos.   We the people want better representation!  Divider
@SenWhitehouse You are better than this Senator
@RepMaxineWaters And she‚Äôs back to slandering our president again.    Welcome back Negative Maxine we didn‚Äôt miss you much
@PattyMurray Divider
@SenWhitehouse Not sure Sheldon is what you are doing small?   Are you  doing any better?    Aren‚Äôt you still casting stones and slinging mud over any topic you can find?    You are supposed to be a distinguished Senator.   Are you acting like one?

@BernieSanders None of us chose our race why does everyone keep trying to make it the top issue.  The MAJORITY don‚Äôt care what color anyone is.  Your pointing at a tiny percentage of the population.  Our history teaches us however it doesn‚Äôt define us.   We the people aren‚Äôt a color but an idea
@eastversewest @politico Sounds like a lot of hate btw.     Wake up and realize we live in the land of opportunity and with hard work and saving anything is possible.   Don‚Äôt let the hatred divide us and hinder the vision of what we are.   An all inclusive yet confused / divided people.
@AmmoDawg214 @eastversewest @politico So may I ask if you truly believe Trump is inciting racism?   I‚Äôm white my children are mixed, My brother is black and my wife is Asian.   None of us believe the lies.  Research your Democratic Party!  13th amendment was passed by Republicans.   Stop dividing start loving
@politico Politico why are you inviting racial tension and dividing the people?
@mattgaetz Perfect answer!    Alex Jones may be a little looney but YouTube / Facebook banning him is outrageous.    It only makes the extreme stand out more!
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Ha.   Divider.    He donates his salary yet you try to sling this. https://t.co/DE5GQUw5dM
@RepMarkMeadows Corruption at its finest.    Out with all of them
@realDonaldTrump YouTube and others banning Infowars is a bit ridiculous!  I may not believe a lot of what is on his shows, but it is his opinion and banning the show is bad for America on the whole!   You used his shows to get voters!   Free press and the internet is the new tv!
@DevinNunes Don‚Äôt let the attacks change your mind or path!   We the People is an idea worth fighting to keep!    Thank you for wanting to work with a President chosen by the people!  We don‚Äôt believe the fake news.
@tedlieu @FBI Wrong side Ted!
@Jim_Jordan @jack And now a nonstop attack on Nunes!   We are counting on you and the few with you fighting to end the corruption and bring our people together!
@tedlieu You sir are not listening closely and grasping at straws to discredit anyone for political gain!   You should resign.    We the people which includes some of your constituents chose Trump and want you all to work together.   Congress and Senate members acting like children crying
@AC360 @RepSwalwell You are spinning this in a fashion that is divisive and shows that your reporting is biased!    We should all want to protect our president and debate what is best for our country.   You can‚Äôt even report the full story.   Pure Propaganda
@thehill Proof that what?   Proof he cares about the country and protecting a president that the people chose!   I find it respectable that he debates adeas and what is best for our Country!   Wake up
@PattyMurray Did they cross the border illegally to have a child in the United States to skip the legal process.    Tell the full story Senator.    It‚Äôs unbecoming to tell stories without important details.   I‚Äôm for reform but not the lies
@SenWhitehouse And what about the Chinese spy that was on her payroll.   What will you all do when the extent of your parties corruption comes out fully?   Why else are so many of you quitting / retiring and slinging mud to divide the people.   Your constituents are bipartisan, so should you be
@SenGillibrand Roe v wade.    To kill or not.   I‚Äôm not for controlling any woman however there has to be limits.   So many people want children that aren‚Äôt able to.   Make it financially easier to adopt and help stop the atrocities.   We are better people!   Stop dividing for politics Senator
@PattyMurray Enough Patty!   Divider!
@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump Get it girl :-)
@PattyMurray Politicizing killing babies is ridiculous.   If life demands a pregnancy end which is killing why must you broadcast it.   It‚Äôs a hard decision all the way around.   For the mother, the father, the family etc.    let alone the physician having to dismember babies. Stop dividing
@RandPaul Thank you Senator
@JeffreyBrandes .     Looks like he needs your help. https://t.co/lOHub0jYIb
@WeWontBend It really isn‚Äôt about immigration to them!  It‚Äôs about the appearances needed to ‚Äúwin Votes‚Äù.  They don‚Äôt care what anyone wants. Division is what they desire.  They want us to hate each other so they can do whatever they please!  I like it that Trumps bringing back some purpose
@realDonaldTrump WWG1WGA.   Lead the way....   We everyday people are behind you sir black, white, brown and yellow!      Trade, infrastructure, jobs,    PURPOSE !!  Spread peace and love yet walk with Strength!
@RealCandaceO Why is everyone blaming the past when the future can be se bright!   We live in the land of opportunity!   Opportunities always include fear and once fear is battled. The sky is the limit
@BernieSanders I thought that was your parties job.   To divide.   The only angry hateful people I encounter are in the left.   How about pushing peace, unification, jobs, family, ‚Äúa dream‚Äù
@RealCandaceO Love to hear the truth being told!
@sarahjeong Ignore the tiny few that feel we are different!   Don‚Äôt feed them with the hate they desire.   Peace and love with an understanding that not one of us chose our parent,skin, financial upbringing etc.   We do choose to work and save.  Our society has forgotten to have respect
@sarathofkhan Since when is there a food chain in hard work?
@business Infrastructure!!   Can you smell it?   It‚Äôs called building infrastructure to support the demand for charging!!   Tesla will beat everyone‚Äôs expectations!  Go @Tesla
@sjsturkie @Angel__Kitty Bad ruling for our democracy!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Such bs
@SenBillNelson Aren‚Äôt you one of those leaders that can talk your buddies into something?
@RealCandaceO But it wouldn‚Äôt get the coverage they desire!   Free advertising!!   All press is good press they say
@SenWhitehouse Blah blah!   Get to work on real issues.    Slinging mud in worry of the next election is not gentlemanly!   Remember the people!!   All of us non partisan people
@Jim_Jordan To hide the corruption!   Let the people know the truth and rid us of the historic corruption from the past administrations!   We the people are supposed to be the govt!   One of us for all of us!
@BernieSanders Then fix the education system so that every single person that gets an education can see that they all have enormous potential and no one is trapped in the USA!   The land of opportunity is alive..   save because rainy days come more often then you think
@RealCandaceO Thank you for taking the heat!   Nice to see rational non divisive communication!   We can all come together and show the world that America isn‚Äôt a color it‚Äôs a people full of all beginnings, races, religions and cultures.  We have the road to success for all of our people paved
@chuckwoolery Didn‚Äôt that $15000 paid have the funds trickle down?   Store employees marketing blah blah.   If he can afford it don‚Äôt we want him to spend it?    Trickle down theory.   Jealousy it seems
@SenWhitehouse @SenateMajLdr Your looking like an attack dog for your party lately sir.    Your constituents are on both sides of the isle.  Why cant you meet in the middle? https://t.co/q97STZkOP2
@RepMaxineWaters Awesome.   Back to working for your community.   Bipartisan efforts will pay off!
@EricTrump @Acosta Comical
@SenJeffMerkley Clear is understanding that we the people chose him and yet you still try to needlessly divide us and cast stones.
@Tell_Michelle_ It‚Äôs merely entertainment.   No one thinks this ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù is all truth.    Some things he has reported on strangely have been true though.   Either way, why even give him the time or exposure.
@SenatorTomUdall Funny Tom I thought you were talking about the corrupt politicians that have made millions in public service!    End the witch hunt and let our country heal from the corruption in previous administrations. @realDonaldTrump is on our side.   Who‚Äôs side are you on?
@realDonaldTrump Thank you!   Enjoyed the video..   surprised that more people don‚Äôt see how much change is occurring for the good of our Country
@KentuckyNomad @SenWhitehouse As in giving the government more money or us the people?   Remember that we is inclusive of companies.   I own my own and it will enable us to hire more people and have the chance to grow.     Don‚Äôt believe the lies the Dems spread.   From an ex Dem
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Free Julian Assange!    Presidential limo picks him up takes him to air force one and once here Trump pardons him.    Free a true journalist and get him out of the embassy!
@PattyMurray Constitutional right to fight back if needed against a corrupt government!    Read the Bill of rights Senator!    Then again all you do is divert and divide sadly!
@SenWhitehouse So...   with you being an ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù.  Wouldn‚Äôt you say that lower corporate taxes give incentives for corporations to manufacture products here in the states!   Wouldn‚Äôt you say that thousand more Americans working and paying taxes increases the taxes collected.   Be honest!
@PattyMurray 96 comments.   Whew ...  Ma‚Äôam your argument lacks credibility.   Obviously your constituents want you to stop trying to fight everything the President does and start working for your people and that means being flexible to work with the President!
@BernieSanders Educate our people!  Our people need skills and jobs! Work with Trump, get over the hate and build the future with brainpower and strong hands!
@PattyMurray Patty come on now.   The media even moved on.   The camps nor the policies were created by Trump!   You fail to state the whole truth ma‚Äôam
@realDonaldTrump Keep winning for us sir!
@Tell_Michelle_ The socialist ‚ÄúAgenda‚Äù is alive and well!    I imagine they haven‚Äôt really been to a socialist country!!  KAG!
@Jim_Jordan Rough road ahead doing that.   Drain the swamp end the corruption!   Thanks for fighting for We the People!
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @mattgaetz @DevinNunes Ridiculous
@RepSwalwell Then start leading with love instead of casting stones non stop.   ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù chose him.   Why do you honk it‚Äôs your right to bash him or make the statement ‚ÄúTrump hell‚Äù.  Disrespectful congressman!    Think of your constituents that voted for him and yourself!  Bipartisan!
@SenGillibrand Nope!    Think again we want a level headed, even thinking, constitutionalist to be in this position
@RepMarkMeadows Huh!  Imagine that
@Jim_Jordan Cuffs for traitors.
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Come on now Senator.   Tell the whole truth not just pieces of it.   Trump followed the already established laws and followed through on what was already written.   Stop misleading people it is a dishonorable way to act as a supposed ‚Äúdistinguished Senator‚Äù.  Getting old.
@JohnBrennan traitor
@SenBillNelson Is it ‚Äúfree‚Äù to us?   $8 is a stretch however I imagine there are many ‚Äúcosts‚Äù associated with it.   Maybe they should get a free cell phone and a free house next.
@NancyPelosi It‚Äôs unfollow Nancy day!
@JaneMayerNYer @SenatorLeahy Such bs
@RepAdamSchiff Yeah well a ‚Äúdistinguished Congressman‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be throwing fits on social media either.    Do you ever post anything that pertains to normal people or are you just a voice piece / complainer for your party.    Why not try to make America better?   You are acting like a child
@SenWarren are these the types of actions acceptable for your supporters?  Why aren‚Äôt you speaking out loudly against this?   @FoxNews @cnn why isn‚Äôt this being covered? https://t.co/xuflvgvnZ4
@PattyMurray After 25 years of representing the people you now choose to side with the corrupt.   Sad Patty .  Liberalism isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs being sold.
@RandPaul They will attack with even just a meeting with Trump, let alone attempting to actually tell the people the truth for a change.   So sick of the division.   We the people really aren‚Äôt that different.   Division causes war.   Why divide us unless to conquer??  Political games!
@RepAdamSchiff Sadly you sound like the traitor.   As @realDonaldTrump says let‚Äôs make the best America and goes about proving that he can help, all you do is cast blame and play games with twitter to the world.   Why the name calling stone throwing unless it‚Äôs to hide your party‚Äôs corruption??
@RepMaxineWaters Sad to see you are a betrayer.   You were supposed to be a United
@RepMaxineWaters You asked and called out for this behavior divider.  This is all your fault and so is a lot of the division being pushed among our people.   Do us and you a favor and retire.   You were supposed to represent your constituents and you have failed.  Homeless everywhere in your dist
@SenBlumenthal Pinocchio ü§•
@RepAdamSchiff You have more brainwashed people posting on this than I would have imagined.   Are they fake people like your persona is?
@RepAdamSchiff Duck and cover.    Adam nobody believes your insults / insinuations anymore.   You picked the losing team Rep.   will the cuffs be coming for you too or just your Corrupt coworkers
@SenBlumenthal Right.    We believe you Pinocchio ü§•
@elonmusk  Sorry to see your reputation take a beating in the media.     Keep chugging Elon and don‚Äôt let the crappy news make you out to be something you aren‚Äôt.
@SenBlumenthal More division from our honest trustworthy Senator ü§•.    For your party to be shouting so loudly seems ridiculous.   Is it to cover corruption? https://t.co/lbHs85OMUV
@foxandfriends Why are you even giving him air time?   WTH Fox.
@Slate Well I used to read your crap but it seems you have joined the mudslinging arena.   Unfollow and forget.    Too bad
@realDonaldTrump @jpatton05 Yes they are.   Nice to have a president say something t like it is.   A corrupt bought mess
@EdKrassen Big stretch comparing Trump to Hitler.   You spew hate pretty heavy.   Have you thought how you come across?
@SenSchumer Why would you even say those things.   It‚Äôs like you are rooting against him always which in return is against us.    Do you forget you also met with Putin.   Such lies and diversion https://t.co/fmFMT778Ke
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/zHMQtPQ9o6
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/H6duHwZdfM
@seanhannity Well another year without overpaid athletes ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù some of us on the field.   What has happened to our beloved country?
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump They have forgotten our rights!   They don‚Äôt care as long as they can shame Trump and make people turn against the good job he is doing.   Proves the level of corruption and how many of our reps are owned by corporate America
@seanhannity Guess he‚Äôs corrupt too.   Then again he is a Flake üòú
@realDonaldTrump Screw em!   We need to communicate with all countries to further peace and prosperity for all.   America is the leader and we chose you to head it!   We do not believe their lies sir.   Most of our friends agree also and see you trying to be more political!  Keep it up and thanks
@NancyPelosi @RepDanKildee Oh yeah the water that was poisoning people during our previous administration.   No need to take credit for something you didn‚Äôt resolve
@RepSwalwell All politics and diversion from the peanut gallery.   We the people are so tired of your desire and of our portions of our representatives to divide us and attack who we chose as president.   You aren‚Äôt leading you are acting like children throwing temper tantrums.  Bipartisan
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What are you afraid of.   Your cover being blown and all the corruption coming out from your party and previous administrations?
@RepAdamSchiff Divider
@RepAdamSchiff  https://t.co/9xjlAqti80
@RepAdamSchiff @SecNielsen And so did the American people.   Have you forgotten we aren‚Äôt Russian.   We the people chose and Russia didn‚Äôt sway out opinion.   Bill Clinton dipping cigars in the whitehouse did that for me when I was a dedicated Democrat.   Your party is corrupt
@SenSanders The average cashier is normally supposed to be a teeny bopper.    McDonalds position as cashiers aren‚Äôt career paths.
@NancyPelosi What about all of our American Companies that provide all the parts they use??
@MarkWarner Don‚Äôt spread guesses.
@SenBlumenthal How was your time in the Vietnam war Senator.   Oh yeah you lied about that too
@SenWarren Says  Pocahontas.   Dividing with half truths.
@NancyPelosi Maybe you should stand on the floor in your stilettos for hours again with absolutely no results.   All you do is divide and spread divisions in our people.     Time to retire
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Dividing separatist.   Retire already if all you do is attack and divide how can it help ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù.  We are over your actions Senator.   From an ex Democrat I am appalled by you and your cronies actions and lack of respect.    Sounds like you may be the true traitor
@RepAdamSchiff Liar ü§•
@SenBlumenthal What are you hiding?   Our last president was even caught saying he  ‚Äúwould have more flexibility after his re-election‚Äù.  You and your Cronies are looking like separatist jerks
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy stop spreading division
@SenBlumenthal  https://t.co/rcU8M9RNzM
@Ron84640911 @JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SteveSchmidtSES Very disrespectful!  You must admit this is far worse than is acceptable
@realDonaldTrump @Angel__Kitty @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson Ignore the hate and keep going!
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SteveSchmidtSES Hmmm.  Why divide when you could do so much more for our nation and people https://t.co/9Kli1sOI7b
@AdamSchiffCA  https://t.co/ZlfXA1EdSE
@SenBlumenthal @washingtonpost Says a known liar. https://t.co/18RemBYs4Y
@SenSanders Surprised you are still hanging with the true traitors Bernie.   Sad to see you decide against your constituents.   We the people are very disappointed in your behavior of protecting them
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Or what do they have on you and the Clintons/ rest of the Dems.    Your days are dwindling
@JeffFlake Good thing you aren‚Äôt running again.   Your political career is over.   Your constituents feel used by you
@SenBlumenthal @washingtonpost Says Pinocchio ü§•.    What are you hiding Richard?    Corruption
@BreitbartNews We aren‚Äôt buying what your selling here!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Retire Chuck
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Retire
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Actually you and your lies embarrass us Pocahontas.   Stop dividing and preach peace and love for a change.   Unless of corse the fits are to cover your own corruption.    We aren‚Äôt buying it
@SenWhitehouse Divider
@RepAdamSchiff Retire divider.   We are sick of your antics
@SenBlumenthal @washingtonpost Actually we believe that you, A fake Vietnam veteran who lies and divides people for $$ and politics is the true traitor.    What could you really be hiding?    Stop pulling the wool over eyes and let the people see the truth
@SenFeinstein Lies
@Jim_Jordan Ha!!   Good one Jim
@RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Lip smacking divider Adam Schiff.    Stop dividing and work for the people.    We are tired of your behavior and tantrums.   Retire already.   You and your buddies muds are dividing our people for what???   Political gain?  corruption?
@SenFeinstein And why are all of you torturing our president for something he didn‚Äôt do.    These lies being slung towards ‚ÄúOUR‚Äù  pick are ridiculous
@jaketapper @AmbJohnBolton @CNNSotu Political stunts for ratings.   We are not buying the lies
@RepAdamSchiff Still your turn huh Adam.    We have lost almost all respect for you sir.   We expect some bipartisan effort.   Stop dividing and start uniting!
@SenSchumer Says the boy who called wolf.   We do not believe you unfortunately.    Which is a sad state for our country.
@PressSec @POTUS Yet the media scream about traditions.   What nonsense.
@Jim_Jordan Yet the Dems are screaming about Russia.    Diversion??   That‚Äôs what it seems like
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What are you scared of Senator?   Peace?  The truth going out to the people?    We patiently wait for both parties to stop this nonsense, it is not how normal people really think or want you all to behave like.
@SenSchumer Slinging more lies, diversion and division again today Senator...    we are getting so tired of the games.   Just communicate together and with everyone else.
@SenBlumenthal And the fear sets in.   What are you all afraid of?   Peace?
@RepAdamSchiff Communication is what we need.   How can we come to mutually beneficial agreements across the globe if we do not communicate.    Seems like more diversion and not a true desire to let the people choose.   You must have drawn the short straw to be the main attacker all the time!
@SenSanders If what you are saying is that he should follow your principles or be required to do it through your demand.   I met someone at airport who works and loves the company and work in the distribution center.  Said the company gives chances to people and is awesome.   Isn‚Äôt it his?
@SenWarren I don‚Äôt see you jumping in with a ‚Äúplan‚Äù or even offering to help his administration in any way.   All you do is attack and sling mud.   We are over it Senator
@Jim_Jordan If it‚Äôs false fight for your life!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump More division.......
@PattyMurray Patty why the push for more division!   Why not poll your constituents on both sides of the isle!   All politics with no true meaning.   Disappointed in our Dems
@RepMarkMeadows Let‚Äôs hope the choice is someone who can somewhat unite us.   The division being pushed is very distasteful from what seems like the whole Democrat party as well as a few Republicans!   Someway we need to be united as a people to see the opportunity we have!   Unlimited potential
@JeffreyBrandes met some of your people hitting the pavement yesterday.   Pleasant surprise I‚Äôm hoping you are as awesome as they say you are!    Thanks for leading
@SenFeinstein I am for each family choosing however at what point is the beating heart not it‚Äôs own?  Why politics when it‚Äôs sensitive?   Why the division?   What are you hiding?   Maybe you should retire
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump You are really getting into the bashing lately.   What for?  Attention?   Or is it because hardly anyone really knows you and you are grandstanding?   All nonsense!
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Nonsense.   Maybe if you would stop treating him like dirt and try to work with him you could accomplish something
@SenSchumer Then again this is the Washington Post.   They also said the talks were falling apart but not for them to go on as scheduled.   Surprised you are quoting them Chuck.   I wouldn‚Äôt bet on any nonsense they ‚Äúprint‚Äù
@RepMaxineWaters Go back to sleep Maxine people are sick of your slandering and dividing behavior while some of your constituents are homeless and addicts.   Fix your district then you can cast stones.   Seems you are just a mouthpiece or just bitter
@SenWarren I‚Äôm curious if you will agree to the DNA test for heritage.   Interesting thought
@SenJeffMerkley Divider.   Still slinging dirt when you should be thinking about how to work with the President ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù chose.   Keep up these tactics and you won‚Äôt be back in office.    It‚Äôs not R or D.   It is People or Party and you choose Party.   Wrong choice as we still vote
@realDonaldTrump Forget twitter keep working on fixing the system that has been manipulated by special interests!
@SenatorTomUdall And more division from the Senator that has never said anything positive about our current administration.   You have to find good in some part of the Trump administration.   You are losing supporters with these antics.   We the people are sick of the way all of you are acting!
@Ladyloki01 @kwoodmcg @ejbeal19511 @SenBlumenthal Actually it was him telling the boarder security to enforce the laws already written prior to his administration.   Read up on it and you will see things a little different.   Unless it‚Äôs just a casting stones contest
@boAtFUS @TeresaDiVicenzo @Jordiew @astrn_m @Saintsfan5348 @SenBlumenthal Not true
@SenBlumenthal Sounds like your parties answers as well sir!  Has your party taken blame for the division in our country or the call for ‚Äúaction‚Äù against those having a difference of opinion?  Have you offered to help the administration as opposed to casting blame?  This was happening pre Trump
@MartinHeinrich Probably not a good angle for your career Martin to start slinging mud.   Stop dividing people and work to do the job you were hired to do
@SenatorHassan And division by Maggie.   Be a honorable Senator and stop slinging mud we are sick of it
@RonWyden @EPAScottPruitt Divider
@SenSanders 100 percent!   Solar, wind and storage of power will dynamically change our country!   Electricity is our complete future why not invest in it!
@Independent You‚Äôre merely selling a story.   Who cares what a ‚Äúexpert‚Äù thinks.   Marriage is not bliss all the time for anyone.   Stop dividing and sell a positive story for a change
@AuthorKimberley Race is not chosen nor should be used as a divisive instrument to divide us.    Your statements are not only racist but your slander of tea party people which I‚Äôm not one of is also offensive.   Think before you step up to the mic.   Stop dividing people and spread love not hate
@marcorubio Get more funding for our schools!    Especially those in areas where property tax values limit the $$ for our teachers and buildings!   How can we be great if everyone isn‚Äôt given the same chance to 12th grade.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @fishooks_James @realDonaldTrump #showus the people want to see the true corruption being fought!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @fishooks_James @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs happening everywhere.   They are turning our nation against each other for political and $$ gain.    I can‚Äôt imagine the level of true corruption your father is fighting against.   Huge amounts of cash spent to hide corruption!   Show us and let the people decide!
@jnarls @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a bit extreme don‚Äôt you think!   You could use the same logic to associate any president with something that happened while in office.    Read some history books and get back with us on reasonable logic!
@SenWarren @EPAScottPruitt Poster boy for corruption?   I thought that was your friends the Clintons Senator.     Why are you still dividing as opposed to trying to bring us together?   Seems like you may be the true corruption ma‚Äôam
@RepMaxineWaters Stop dividing on a regular basis and help your constituents living in the streets.   Get the wall done to stop the flow of heroin which is poisoning our people.   Just think what you could have done if you were even a bit bipartisan
@MendrunMatt He should be arrested for assault.   Unacceptable!!   Way to attack what looks to be teenagers.   Real tough guy !
@TraceySchulz @OysteinNo @CASoundsOff @StacyLStiles @VetApologist @RealJamesWoods False.
@TraceySchulz @CASoundsOff @StacyLStiles @VetApologist @RealJamesWoods You obviously are watching the fake news.   Do you really think with Billions of Dollars he is slinging condos from the whitehouse.   Maybe the previous administrations would have but those are Lies.   Sad state to attack someone working for us with no benefit to himself
@DonaldJTrumpJr It is comical.   All they have to do is tell the real news on both sides of the argument in a non biased fashion
@BoringEnormous @AnnCoulter You gotta love em!   The joy they bring is amazing!
@SenGillibrand Why is race a deciding factor in anything in 2018.   My children are of mixed race and I do not expect any preferential treatment for them.  Let performance be a determining factor.   If you want to fix something fix inner city schools and stope the drugs pouring over the boarder
@NBCNews @MSNBC And most of us believe your ‚Äúnews‚Äù is biased.   You merely divide!
@MarkWarner Yeah and we never interfere in anything.   Get a grip we are not blind and stupid
@SenFeinstein How about you wait till he tells us his pick.   You are throwing tantrums over everything, even things he hasn‚Äôt done yet.   Your tactics are failing
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Divider your time is limited in office.   First chance we get you will be voted out for things like this.   Just watch
@RepAdamSchiff And your mud slinging is better.    Prove you are better and stop the nonsense
@RepAdamSchiff Says the great divider!   Adam we have had enough games and want you and the other Dems to work on what we expect you to which are policies for the people to enable us!   Stop slinging mud it‚Äôs getting really old.  Keep it up and we won‚Äôt have any Dems in office.  What a bad joke
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator you‚Äôre throwing fits prior to him even saying a name.   If who he picks is problem, tell us at that point and give us a logical reason as to why you think the nom is impartial.   We are begging for your return to original Dem Principles.   We do not want to be socialists!
@MSNBC Looks like lies snowflakes
@MSNBC Guess they should negotiate to drop all Tarrifs.
@MSNBC Dividers!    Stop attacking our president.  When you attack non stop as you do without one word of kindness you lose supporters.   Unfollowing you tsoon day and I thought I never would because I wanted a rounded news approach however you aren‚Äôt news when you have an aganda! Adios
@daveweigel @JoyAnnReid No bot here!   Chose to #walkaway after seeing nothing but corruption and a disregard for us as a people!   We deserve better.   No Dems even Compare to JFK.   Disappointing.   I thought @CoryBooker was the next guy but unfortunately not even him now.  We the people remember
@realNordz @1RU4real @realDonaldTrump WWG1WGA
@realDonaldTrump Yet if you listen to the Democrats they are pushing nothing but a misleading dividing story!   I‚Äôm not buying what they are selling and neither are most I know.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not buying it!   Diversion if you ask me
@soaringhawkes @MarkWarner @senrobportman What company?
@soaringhawkes @MarkWarner @senrobportman Survey this I own a small company and have hired 2 people since March.   All my friends similar to me are also doing well with business.   From 6-8 employees after 16 years of no more than 6 employees.   Whatever they are selling big picture wise is misleading!
@803front @MarkWarner @senrobportman Just proof it‚Äôs misleading from our state
@BreitbartNews Peace breads peace!   Start with love and finish with respect!   Stop dividing the people.   What good can it do?
@NBCNews Yeah he can fix everything in less than 2 years.   Speak the truth NBC
@MarkWarner Misleading and you know it sir!    Speak the FULL truth and stop dividing please.
@MarkWarner It has been 6 months since #taxreform became law and it‚Äôs working! According to the #Ohio Chamber of Commerce survey from May, 70% of businesses added employees in the first 3 months of the year and 75% plan to hire this quarter! #jobs https://t.co/02k3ZY6XVQ.  @senrobportman ??
@Tell_Michelle_ Respect and love for one another.  Many have different viewpoints and our perceptions may be different but that doesn‚Äôt make mudslinging and spewing hate proper.  We should show the world what can happen when respect and love come first!   Stop the hate and division on both sides
@RealJamesWoods So sad!   I can‚Äôt imagine the pain to realize that you forgot.   I have to admit I have driven all the way to work only to have my two children once arriving say Dad why are we at your work.   I feel so horribly for the family and the child.
@MSNBC More division!    We the people CHOSE ...    why the rhetoric?  What‚Äôs really at stake?
@1776Stonewall @ASegals @thehill It‚Äôs merely about dividing the people.  Division or blinding?   A divided people are vulnerable!
@RepSwalwell @FoxNews It‚Äôs a problem on both sides Sir.  As you have been viewed as a painted picture, so are the majority of the people.   We aren‚Äôt what we are said to be.   Conservatives believe in personal freedom and are called many things we aren‚Äôt!  Peace and Love is the answer.  Unite us!
@realDonaldTrump On HBO‚Äôs @billmaher they are actually calling for millions to stand up and boycott / fight back.  What are all of you doing to our country with all the division.   Stop attacking and discuss solutions not just attacks!
@PhyddleDD But are you so sure?   I am watching from the sidelines like you and I do not believe that to be the case.   He does respond to attacks and rather I like the way he responds or not he does turn out to be right.   If that‚Äôs not the case please explain specifics.
@HBO I find it hard to believe that you would have a host call our president a mother blanker but not using blanker.   I know it‚Äôs HBO but wow the level of division this is causing is disturbing.  @billmaher shouldn‚Äôt you want to find ways to unite as opposed to divide.
@SenSchumer @FedSoc Which way would you rather have it then Senator?   It‚Äôs getting hard to follow what you think he should do as opposed to what he is not.    It is a horrendous subject and not to be taken lightly hence why the highest court in the law decides.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Is it not the same as Obama not enforcing marijuana policy!   Surprised you used this ‚Äúargument‚Äù
@SenFeinstein Now we return back to our intended broadcast of bashing the people‚Äôs President.
@SenJeffMerkley Divider!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump The diversion isn‚Äôt working better start a new plan.   We are not falling for you trying to divide us.   We the people just want honest representatives!
@RepAdamSchiff Stop dividing
@RepAdamSchiff more division and hatred of the president ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù chose.  This is unacceptable Sir.   What about your constituents that chose him.   What about the people that chose you yet voted for him.   What are you saying to them sir?  We expect more from our CHOSEN leaders
@RepMarkMeadows Because they need something to sling mud about
@SenSchumer Isn‚Äôt this what Trump is trying to stop yet your fellow Dems seem not to care how brutal the gangs are.
@SenBlumenthal I‚Äôm sure you will obstruct anyone he recommends.   Let‚Äôs hope not though
@MSNBC Msnbc the land of lies and propaganda
@BreitbartNews Why are you even reporting on this evil hatred?
@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately it‚Äôs not the party of JFK anymore!   What happened?  They all got bought it seems
@SenFeinstein So you want the children to join the parent in jail?   What are you saying Senator.
@RepAdamSchiff Witch hunt.
@SenSchumer I believe the two way street of civility could begin with you approaching our President and working to fix the issues!  You can be for both sides!   Some of your constituents believe in our President and want civility.    We the people first sir! https://t.co/x4LtzU6Q2T
@MSNBC Thank you for listening to those of us that want civility and BiPartisan effort to keep America moving forward!   Now is the time to start working with him and forget the politics for a while.   Bring the people together!  Maxine should resign as well.   We would expect it if GOP
@MSNBC She should resign
@SenJeffMerkley Like when children throw tantrums unfortunately your tantrums are half truths and division.   Work together and stop casting stones
@NBCNews She should resign
@PattyMurray Hence Trumps statement.   ‚ÄúA big door allowing those that truly want to be here‚Äù.  More division.   Sad Patty I didn‚Äôt see you as a divider
@Tess3761 @SenBlumenthal @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs more than a wall.  A path to citizenship for current illegals.  A reduction in heroin and gang activity.  A reduction in human smuggling. This isn‚Äôt a slap a wall it‚Äôs fixed.  It‚Äôs bigger than that and hopefully people will read the legislation.  As a former dem I am hopeful
@SenBlumenthal If you recall he said in the beginning.   Fix the border then a big door for those that want to come here and. Be proud Americans.  @realDonaldTrump has already given a viable solution and yet all we get is diversion and division from our Dems.   We are getting tired of the lies!
@SenSchumer As the cards start to come falling down.   More diversion.  How about true answers?   How about working with the man for a change!
@Jim_Jordan We are counting on you to help bring the truth to light.   Or at least what you can share!   Our people have been divided enough and we expect more!   End the True corruption.
@jayMAGA45 She should resign
@MSNBC She should resign
@RepMarkMeadows Hence the media only covering the refugee situation.    We are counting on you sir
@SenSanders Oh now it‚Äôs his fault the prisons are packed from a faulty justice system!   Come on Bernie where are you?   We know you used to think like us!   At least we thought sir.    Still time to come back and finish it like you wanted in the beginning sir!
@NancyPelosi You stand behind her type of behavior ma‚Äôam?   Don‚Äôt you find it repulsive to act so unprofessional!   We expect better of our representatives!   All politics at any cost
@RepAdamSchiff Created by previous administrations and continued by him.   You are leaving that part out mr Divider.   What about him trying to fix it.   What about you holding him back for true fixes.   It‚Äôs merely politics for you I imagine you could really care less.   Your careers over
@UncomfortableB1 @SenBlumenthal @WSJ Actually grew up hating all Michigan teams so to speak.   Buckeye fan.   Horrible situation for everyone.   Hopefully the victims can get good counsel for the anguish.
@UncomfortableB1 @SenBlumenthal @WSJ You can turn it negative all you like.   I am just saying not all the leadership may have known.    Our society is so good at casting blame at times to innocent bystanders.   Which is sad all the way around for all effected by horrible behavior!
@BreitbartNews Whew 24 hours.   Is that really news?
@UncomfortableB1 @SenBlumenthal @WSJ Don‚Äôt read something that isn‚Äôt there.   I‚Äôm not apologizing for anyone that does these things.   I have no patience for it.
@SenWarren A wall with a big door üö™ or better yet many big doors
@SenWarren And isn‚Äôt the president working on the gang problems!    Which side are you on.   Make up your mind Senator
@RealSaavedra Ridiculous
@SenJeffMerkley Are you done trying to divide us Senator!   You are one of a handful holding our country for true hostage sir.   Non partisan would be a start
@SenBlumenthal @WSJ Sexual abuse of any kind from those we expect to teach our children is unacceptable!   Long jail sentences for anyone hurting our children should await them.   The schools leadership can‚Äôt take all the blame however.   These predators are just that Predators.   Sometimes stealthy
@Larry_Jensen @giufuliafa @NBCNews One last thing!   There are many laws feel free to read them if you can.   I personally am married to an immigrant.   There are paths!   It‚Äôs a blame game for political gain PERIOD.
@giufuliafa @Larry_Jensen @NBCNews And didn‚Äôt he just make changes to help the situation.    Why is it that it is ok for one but not the other.   Why didn‚Äôt O fix the problem when he had the influx.   And no need for you to own the mistake.   Shouldn‚Äôt you be pleased he listened and is fixing it?
@Larry_Jensen @giufuliafa @NBCNews Zero tolerance means following the law.   Should we just pick and choose?   Even the videos used were from 2014 when he wasn‚Äôt President.   If you have children and break the law what happens to your children?   You are separated.   Sad situation however we have laws!
@RepMaxineWaters Ma‚Äôam the way you are acting is unacceptable!   You are supposed to be better!
@RepMaxineWaters More divisive behavior!
@RepMaxineWaters Great way for a supposed distinguished Senator to act!    People look up to you Maxine!   Shouldn‚Äôt you have a little respect!  Shouldn‚Äôt you represent people with honor?    Where did your disregard for American come from?
@PoliticusSarah @RepMaxineWaters All division and a total disregard for her constituents!
@realDonaldTrump üí™üèºüëçüèª
@ChrisVanHollen Always an attack and diversion!   Chris there is still time to think and stop slinging dirt!   Are you even clean enough to sling dirt?
@GovMikeHuckabee Sad state our union is in because of a few corrupt politicians pushing an agenda and turning people against one another
@giufuliafa @Larry_Jensen @NBCNews And isn‚Äôt that what they want you to believe as they try in vain to find a way to remove a president chosen by the people.    Even though you may be on the other side isn‚Äôt that a problem?
@DRUDGE_REPORT What has happened to The message of Christ?  Satan must be pleased sadly
@JacobAWohl I‚Äôm a Trump supporter however an attack back with the same ignorance does not make us better!   Why not point out the truth without the lashing!  Some respect could earn some people back that are starting to sway !
@Larry_Jensen @NBCNews Then again the attacks are exactly what they are trying to sell!
@Larry_Jensen @NBCNews Wow just YouTube his interviews prior to being president and tell me he is all those evil things they spew.  Go back to 1980 and start watching.   He‚Äôs not what they are trying to sell
@kathygriffin Is this working for you?   Only disgusts us normal people.   Hating just to hate!   What for?   Division ?  Money?   To be in the limelight?
@DRUDGE_REPORT So stupid
@Larry_Jensen @NBCNews Yeah right.   I think you should listen to all his interviews and see that the media makes him to be something he isn‚Äôt.
@RepMarkMeadows Fight for the people sir
@SenatorTomUdall @MartinHeinrich @SenBlumenthal Oh how awesome it must be to spend the day with our Vietnam veteran Pinocchio.   Has he told you any bedtime stories yet?   If he can‚Äôt tell the truth about his service what can he tell the truth on?   Why should we believe anything he says?
@senorrinhatch @CoryBooker Tell the truth and stop trying to divide us
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Every day brings you dividing the people further.   Divisive tactics ma‚Äôam and we aren‚Äôt falling for it.   Our Country is booming and all you do is spread division
@IngrahamAngle @THR What is very Caucasian?  So divisive!     Hating just to hate it seems
@NYGovCuomo Misleading Governor!   The laws were not written by this administration and the videos are mostly from 2014.   Stop dividing and help unite your constituents!    Very disrespectful!    Tell the TRUTH!
@SenBlumenthal @MartinHeinrich @SenatorTomUdall What you meant to say was this administration following the written law.   So misleading!   How can we trust you when you can‚Äôt even tell the truth about your military service.    Disgraceful Senator!  You are supposed to represent us not yourself and your agenda!
@PressSec @POTUS My apologies for our fellow citizens treating you the way they have.   Unfortunately some of us have forgotten to respectfully disagree!    Keep your chin up
@Jamierodr10 @RodStryker So sweet
@KurtSchlichter @DualityMan Why even put this guy on the news.   Only to divide us.   I‚Äôm a Trump supporter and name calling and fear tactics will not change my mind.   Divisive, ridiculous tactics used against the people to guilt trip us out of supporting our Patriot President @realDonaldTrump
@MSNBC MSNBC = lies to sway the the people.  Completely biased dividers!    Sad state we are  n when the ‚Äúnews‚Äù picks sides against the majority
@RealMAGASteve @Holly2360 All a big scheme to sway us!   We aren‚Äôt blind
@dbongino Crazy!
@NBCNews They are trying to divide us!   Wake up
@kwilli1046 @SenSchumer what happened Senator have you forgotten your stance or is it all bs to divide us
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump As you a public servant are living a life of the rich and famous.   Who‚Äôs the hypocrite?   We thought you were one of us
@realDonaldTrump They are running scared and it‚Äôs all they have left.   What diversion is next?    We the people are not amused with their divisive tactics!
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump Why the diversion Senator?
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary @HillaryClinton Diversion
@SenBlumenthal Pinocchio we know this was started prior to Trump and even the poster child Valera is a lie.   She wasn‚Äôt separated and the Honduran govt even confirmed it was a lie.    Come on now sir
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Divider we don‚Äôt believe your lies!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Diversion / Division.   Stop  dividing Senator.   Who wrote the law?   Not Trump.   He only followed it!
@RepAdamSchiff Enough mud slinging.   I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you end up being part of the corruption with all of your divisive tactics.   Will you be in hand cuffs when all the truth comes out sir?
@SenSchumer Still slinging mud huh Senator?
@SenSanders Actually sounds like the DNC to me sir!   We aren‚Äôt buying it!
@SenFeinstein Enough attacks Senator!   He listened and delivered.   Work for us and stop throwing stones!
@SenBlumenthal He didn‚Äôt write the law he promised to follow.   The buildings weren‚Äôt built or the law created by him.   We are not falling for your diversion Senator.  We the People want and will be heard.   Stop the political speak and work for your constituents!!
@RepAdamSchiff He followed the law written prior to his administration and was ridiculed for following the law.   Be greatful he heard the voice of the people and made a proper decision.   Isn‚Äôt that what we want?  A president that listens to the people. All you do is divide and find fault sir!
@SenSanders Stop the lobbying it‚Äôs ruining our Representative Democracy.
@SenWarren @RepCummings Oh for heavens sake he acts like a moron and attacks over nonsense.   He is divisive and only divides us more.   March or not he‚Äôs not Dr. King.
@SenBillNelson Come on Bill.   Misdirection
@NancyPelosi @LindseyGrahamSC Complete misdirection to not have to discuss the IG report and all the corruption before my shown to us.   Time to retire in those stilettos üë†
@RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerRyan You are so corrupt and bought.   How can we believe a word coming by from your mouth üëÑ
@SenJeffMerkley Jeff joining in on covering the corruption.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Misdirection!   Why don‚Äôt you bring up the corruption that‚Äôs coming out and tweet that?   Are you part of it too?   I hope not but it‚Äôs looking that way.  Then again Bernie‚Äôs worth millions and he‚Äôs been a career politician.   Now how does that work Senator?   Do you really care?
@NancyPelosi @SecNielsen I would prefer you resign instead Senator
@MarkWarner Divider
@SenSanders How to you propose we fix it then Senator.   Negotiate with him on the wall and fix the problem
@SenSchumer Change the laws then by negotiating with him on true border security!   Make it an obtainable process for those less fortunate to come here and stop the politics
@MarkWarner Change the law then sir!!   Isn‚Äôt he saying ‚Äúthe law is screwed up let‚Äôs negotiate and fix it‚Äù.  Isn‚Äôt he just enforcing the laws created prior to him?   We are not amused with your politics
@Tell_Michelle_ MSNBC = half truths and diversion.    They only seem to care about dividing us and they definitely have an agenda!
@realDonaldTrump We aren‚Äôt buying their lines of hate.
@SenFeinstein Isn‚Äôt it Children that their parents can‚Äôt be verified.   Would be logical to fight human trafficking.   Are you giving us the full story Senator?
@RealJamesWoods The problem is several of the news delivery‚Äôs services are not giving the true story.   They are basing ‚Äúsales‚Äù ‚Äúviews‚Äù based on hate/cover against ‚ÄúWe The People‚Äù.   I just hope people will wake up and see the smear campaign in progress and realize our president is a PATRIOT!
@RepAdamSchiff More mud from the divider.   There is still time to listen to ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù that chose him.   That is your job sir!   We can forgive a lot in hopes for a united country!
@Acosta Divider.
@Acosta Have some respect Jim.    When did all decency disappear from CNN.   Disappointed to see you acting the way you have been
@Acosta Definitely.   Then again aren‚Äôt you owned by your corrupt news network.   The people are tired of you and CNN treating our chosen leader the way you do
@Tell_Michelle_ Sorry Michelle.   Out of all the ‚Äúpoliticians‚Äù. You are the only one to ever respond.   I hope you have it in you to try again!   Best wishes
@SenSanders I agree Senator
@BreitbartNews Wish we could fire her!
@SenSanders Didn‚Äôt some senators already try?  How can we rely on our Senators when their favorite past tome these days is hating our chosen President
@RepAdamSchiff Divider we are a bit sick of reading your nonsense.   Sure hope you get replaced soon
@SenSchumer Probably not the ideal time to attack and try to divide when he‚Äôs doing what the previous president should have.   Rodman even said he went to O with words from Kim.    Disgraceful to say the least.   I‚Äôm happy he is helping end the Korean War and issues related to it!   Peaceüôè
@AFP All the hating and he still keeps winning!
@BlacksForDTrump Anything to fight him.   People are awakening so.....
@MarkWarner Divider
@Tell_Michelle_ Good luck!üçÄ
@MarkWarner To get equal trade.
@SenSchumer Why not speak of the positive benefits of us normalizing relations with NK?  Or that the economy is booming?  Or that the people are on a whole healthy/happy.   We would prefer you not dividing Senator.   Imagine the good you can do for all of US if you can swallow your pride!
@RepAdamSchiff Get with the program and realize what he is pushing for is better for the American worker.   If he can get us fair equal trade wouldn‚Äôt we all benefit??
@GovMikeHuckabee Lost me as a fan.   He should stick to movies but then again he has so much $ now he doesn‚Äôt care what we think
@therealroseanne @georgesoros Huh.   That‚Äôs a change of pace Roseanne.
@RepAdamSchiff Divider
@realDonaldTrump Thanks for the update Mr. President.    We the people want to be united!!   Somehow fix the infighting!
@NBCNews Isn‚Äôt that what we want.
@JohnBrennan You so sure?
@TuckerCarllson Huh ???   And not Trump.   Silly
@GeorgeTakei Says an actor
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Cute example but misleading.    Divider
@SenSchumer Divider
@RepAdamSchiff Sounds like Schiff to me.    Mud slinging at its best
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Jeff that sounds so childish for a supposedly distinguished Senator
@RerollAndy @davidfrum Huh?   You must be kidding
@BreitbartNews Why do you put this guy in the news
@MSNBC @splcenter @MorganRadford Don‚Äôt pull out the looneys and act like it‚Äôs all of us!   The dividing network!   Why must you push division
@MSNBC @SusanPage Propaganda
@MSNBC @ChrisMurphyCT Misleading lies
@NBCNews @MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK More division from our NBC propaganda network.
@MSNBC @TheRevAl Courtesy of your networks devisive tactics.   MSNBC spewing division and propaganda.   For what?
@2askjoe @canyyoulove @PressSec @JustinTrudeau @POTUS False.   Ex dem not so happy with Republicans either.   Just sick of the corrupt politicians becoming wealthy by bribes etc.   wake up brother
@Evan_McMullin Whatever Evan.
@SenBlumenthal Exactly what a corrupt Senator would say!   Divider everyone is watching!!  Open your eyes and see we the people want you to unite not divide
@BreitbartNews And what is he??   I don‚Äôt hear love coming from his dividing tactics.   We are the same.
@SenBlumenthal Or could it be all the companies in America selling ZTE their components and services??    Stop dividing
@RealCandaceO Awesome !
@SenSanders Then boycott them.  Won‚Äôt that make it worse?
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog Dividers
@SenSanders Right on Bernie!   Back to what we like about you!   End the corruption that crushed your presidential run!
@Jim_Jordan And fix the immigration policy to help more people in need of a new free life!   We are the land of opportunity.  If they want to support and work hard to be here and love it why cast them aside!  Love and respect
@SenBlumenthal Thanks for your thoughts Pinocchio ü§•.    Or should we say divider.   You are supposed to bring the people together! What happened???
@RepAdamSchiff Schiff rhymes with???   That‚Äôs all you sling anymore divider
@SenSchumer Why pick a fight?
@RepAdamSchiff Divider.   You‚Äôre out of office soon if you keep acting like a child throwing temper tantrums.   We expect better from a party supposedly representing the people.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Enough mud slinging Jeff.   You are supposed to be a distinguished Senator.   Lead by example and accept that the people chose someone different and we expect you to work with them.   We aren‚Äôt Russians that chose him we are normal working class Americans wanting  real change!
@NancyPelosi So now comes the inflated gas prices to make Trump look bad huh!
@RepAdamSchiff Aren‚Äôt you winging it?   More like he‚Äôs winning it!
@SenSchumer He sounds correct though right!   You don‚Äôt like being called out?   I wouldn‚Äôt either if being linked to the group you are.   There is still time to get rid of the political crap and work with the guy.   We have to work sometimes with people we don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs called life
@mr_weston_ @chardog234 @tylerthemasterr @MalcolmJenkins It‚Äôs tough both ways.   The mistrust on both sides is heavy which puts many confrontations at extreme levels for no reason.   Respect and love is the only answer right now and all we as a society are showing is division.
@MalcolmJenkins Imagine a world where all of us realize we are brothers that shouldn‚Äôt be so angry.   Imagine true justice when needed and love/respect the rest of the time.   We are getting better look at the change in our lifetimes alone.   Unite us .   Patriotism with a desire to unite us!
@MalcolmJenkins An open honest offer to discuss and find ways to help remedy these issues is possible if he were to say he wanted to meet with Trump on these issues.   He wouldn‚Äôt be able to resist the outstretched hand.  Unite us ! We are all tired of the bs.   Love and respect
@johnlegend An open honest offer to discuss and find ways to help remedy these issues is possible if he were to say he wanted to meet with Trump on these issues.   He wouldn‚Äôt be able to resist the outstretched hand.  Unite us ! We are all tired of the bs.   Love and respect ‚úä
@RepSwalwell @FBI @TheAtlantic Good then a law will exist.   Now it‚Äôs time to move on for our Country.   We are so sick of the mud slinging.
@RandPaul Absolutely Senator.
@MarkWarner @VP Fugitive is a stretch.   Concocted lies against an honest person wishing to free us of corruption by letting us see what goes on.   Trump should allow him to come here and pardon him if needed.   Without Wikileaks we wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúreally‚Äù know the dnc corruption and lies they hid!
@jeffreylondon @SenSchumer Thousands of products and textiles.   Didn‚Äôt the cotton industry have some bearing on ridding us of hemp?
@SenSchumer Put the bill forward and work on releasing those in jail for it.   It really is nonsense that something less dangerous than alcohol is putting people in prison.   I believe the states should decide for themselves.   I have never heard of someone dying from it.   Says something!
@NancyPelosi Then go this route for us instead of like children throwing fits.   Some of us used to believe in you until all this mud slinging.
@MarkWarner Misleading Mark.
@SenSchumer Stop slinging Senator you lose us with that nonsense.   Patriot first Democrat second
@SenSanders That‚Äôs why many of us wanted you President until you let them cheat you out of it and we chose another Patriot instead.  Why not work with Trump and reinvigorate your base!  You were independent and we hope you still think that way.   Patriot first remember sir
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Misleading Chuck tell the people where ZTE buys most of its components or better yet how about all the Americans making a living off selling to China.   I was hoping you would stop this nonsense
@RepAdamSchiff Misleading.   Now tell the people how many American businesses rely on selling ZTE components.   Wake up and realize your agenda of division is failing!   So sick of the division and diversion you are slinging.   Why not bipartisan leadership.
@SenSchumer Better way to approach him that‚Äôs for sure.   Maybe you can be the one to unite
@SenSanders Are we rich then?   How about all that debt you all have rung up
@MSNBC That kind of speak can‚Äôt help
@SenWarren Seems to be working at the moment ma‚Äôam.   I know more people that have went from poverty to success in our model.   The only thing holding many back is fear.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Still casting stones Senator.    Big picture sir!
@LorrieOTravel Doesn‚Äôt help us but we did let others take over the industry unfortunately..   best wishes take care
@LorrieOTravel The manufacturing of textiles has been ‚Äúowned‚Äù by China, Vietnam, and several other countries for some time.
@SenSchumer Being entrapped!   We now you are not innocent sir but yet we kindly keep trying to point you back in the right direction.   Stop the tirades and represent us!   All of US
@MarkWarner To get all of you squirming.   Pay attention he‚Äôs throwing the bait and all of you are running for it.   Pay attention to what matters.   Your constituents and the people of this Amazing Country!
@LorrieOTravel I‚Äôm not sorry and by no means judging.   I just can see myself being angry if they were doing the same to me and my family.   Difference is he‚Äôs a billionaire that hasn‚Äôt had to answer to anybody in a long time.   His Children on the other hand should stand by their father.
@SenFeinstein Don‚Äôt chase the lure Senator.   He obviously is playing with you all.   Many jump to every outlandish thing he does on purpose Meanwhile he is fulfilling his campaign promises.   Not sure if it‚Äôs amusing or sad to watch!   Lead with Honor and Patriotism and be for US. Bipartisan
@atrupar @seanmdav It‚Äôs being sick of the games!   Besides it‚Äôs just football
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ammunition to call all Republicans racists and Nazis.   It‚Äôs all part of their game.   They are losing though
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump We the people are ok with it.    Patriotism is a bit important for us as a whole wouldn‚Äôt you say, or do we not care about having our union anymore.   There‚Äôs better things for the president to do anyway.   Like running our Country
@satansfunnybone @MauryRiddick @WiredSources @jolivelaughlove Just don‚Äôt watch it.   Less fans = less $$.   Money talks bs walks.   I say we don‚Äôt sweat it and ignore em
@SenJeffMerkley @WhiteHouse Please outline your solution.   Remember many do not have any documentation and many aren‚Äôt with one of their birth parents.   Outline your plan of action so we can as a people push the agenda to the top through social media.   Unless it‚Äôs propaganda?
@ChrisChastainSC @LorrieOTravel If they want to sit then sit.    People will chose who and what they want to watch.   It‚Äôs football
@LorrieOTravel She‚Äôs his child first wouldn‚Äôt you say.    I know many seem to hate him but if you look past the rhetoric the outcomes are good for all Americans.   All races, all sexual orientations,  all beliefs.    When we stop attacking we can see good in most!    Everyone has baggage!
@marklutchman Ignore the hate.   Love respect and strength conquer
@NBCNews @PeteWilliamsNBC Ouch.   That‚Äôs gonna be a lot by road.
@LorrieOTravel Thanks same back at you!   Life is short and we should be spreading kindness and love while still be strong to protect ourselves from harm.   Best wishes
@realDonaldTrump There are lots of them out there!
@realDonaldTrump Ahhh.  Ignore them.   The majority of the people see what‚Äôs happening.   We want America self sufficient and leading the world to prosperity and freedom!   Everyone deserves to be free to choose how they live
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs the matter Chuck you not going to get any credit and you don‚Äôt like it.   Keep distracting the people it can only help your fellow corrupt cronies.
@SenRonJohnson @stevenmnuchin1 Not a good idea.   Enables corruption
@MSNBC Big news.   A used mattress ha now your stretching
@davidfrum Sounds threatening
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Misleading.   I expect him to defend himself from being ousted against the people‚Äôs wishes.   It‚Äôs a witch hunt and we know it ma‚Äôam
@MattHartUSA @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley Wouldn‚Äôt you say both sides need to stop the bs and work like we normal people do as opposed to dividing us?
@LorrieOTravel It‚Äôs called a global Brand.  Lowest unemployment with our economy booming.   The argument lacks strength when presented that way.   Besides how does a child of the presidents become our whipping child for being successful?   I think it‚Äôs just casting stones
@DonaldJTrumpJr @solentgreenis Like a dog chasing a squirrel.   SQUIRREL!!   It makes sense if we are free.   It‚Äôs all judgement anyway and Christ said the opposite!
@davidfrum Sounds like the Clintons and Bushes
@DRUDGE_REPORT Ok Mr Cuban Cigar.   Imagine if it were your daughter interning only to be crushed by the President.   He should have gotten cuffs
@FoxNews A persons sex is not adjustable.   Chromosomes don‚Äôt change.   Even after a ‚Äúsex change‚Äù biologically they haven‚Äôt changed.  Very sad for them but true
@davidfrum Like who Obama or Bush
@SenSchumer Be honest Chuck 19 People which include 13 Russians Trump doesn‚Äôt know.  Stop with the lies.   We are sick of you trying to remove a president we chose.   We are not Russians or swayed by Russia.   Stop implying someone besides us chose.   Next we will not choose you.   Retire
@SenSchumer Losing us Senator
@Le_ted @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley Show your work.   Yes professor.   Lol.   Your arguing a false story that isn‚Äôt even reality
@MattHartUSA @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley It‚Äôs politics.   He wants attention and to cast blame even though CNN said the reporting was a false story and was even redacted
@MattHartUSA @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley The officers specifically said no one told them he was coming and it wasn‚Äôt a scheduled visit.    Read the attached cnn story.  https://t.co/d0sArAfNj0
@SenJeffMerkley Why the misdirection and falsehoods.   Have you mentioned that what your claiming isn‚Äôt even the case?  https://t.co/d0sArAfNj0.
@kpstoia @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley https://t.co/d0sArAfNj0    Most of what you think it is isn‚Äôt even true.   Read the story
@Le_ted @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley Read the story
@Le_ted @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley https://t.co/d0sArAfNj0
@MiladySkye @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley That‚Äôs a bit of a stretch.    Maybe steer clear of the crazy stories your feeding off of that make you feel that way
@MiladySkye @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley Jimmy Jones ??   A cult.   What in the world is the similarity.    That‚Äôs a misdirection or illogical thinking.
@58isthenew40 @hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley Possible but unlikely.   He spends half his Twitter time attacking instead of telling us what he‚Äôs actually wanting to do for the people.   I believe they are supposed to be the best of us and they aren‚Äôt!
@hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley That‚Äôs a pleasant way to represent Christ.  You only know what the media has told you about the man.
@RepBarbaraLee @RepDonBeyer Divider
@Redpainter1 @SenJeffMerkley @ICEgov That‚Äôs a stretch.
@hemingwayrules @wfw30 @SenJeffMerkley He isn‚Äôt the elect anymore FYI.   He‚Äôs already taken office.   Think about it.   The Senator isn‚Äôt ‚Äúin charge‚Äù there are procedures and he more than likely knew this.  It is merely a stunt for political gain
@SenJeffMerkley Political stunt or did you make arrangements to enter ahead of time.   I imagine your security and theirs is a priority.   Seems like a ploy to get attention Jeff.   We aren‚Äôt buying it
@HouseDemocrats @RepSarbanes You aren‚Äôt getting us back.   The party of JFK/RFK is not the same as it is now.   Somewhere along the line you forgot us.   We the people!   We will not forget your party trying to unseat our President and turn us against each other
@senrobportman @SenateFloor Stop the Flow.   Fix the boarder issue and it would help a lot!  I‚Äôm not in love with it and wish we didn‚Äôt need to but the heroin epidemic is ridiculous and the wall is worth it if it stops it!
@GayRepublicSwag @Holly2360 They use these lies to divide us.  People are waking up and realizing the media is selling division.   Divide and conquer it seems is their mentality.   Wonder why???? $$$
@SenSchumer Senator he doesn‚Äôt want to inadvertently incriminate himself considering you and others are obviously trying to remove a sitting president that We chose.   We aren‚Äôt blind.   We wanted him and your intent is to ignore what We the people wanted and want.  Have you forgotten us?
@VanJones68 @therealroseanne I actually don‚Äôt think either should lose their jobs. I think we should use what they are saying and as people say no this is not how we want it and change it.   We every day people want to get along and enjoy each other and the small cultural differences we have.   It‚Äôs not hard
@RealCandaceO @VanJones68 @CNN Very professional and kind response.   Things happen unfortunately.   Hopefully you can get back on and bring understanding as to what is possible if the blame game would stop and we treated each other with love respect and forgiveness
@SenBlumenthal Back at it Casting stones.  I thought you were working on that.   Pinocchio ü§•
@RobertMounger @BlacksForDTrump @no1important701 I‚Äôve already taught mine!  Have you?
@RobertMounger @BlacksForDTrump @no1important701 What voice are you intending when he has said again and again the intention of the federal government is oversight.   Gun violence won‚Äôt stop until our people teach OUR children that peace and love are the important factors of life
@MSNBC Until they murdered him for trying to unite us
@DanielSerrano91 @2000Revert @ScottPresler @POTUS Tarrifs help remedy that üòâ.  Big picture.   Independent,not in debt and self sufficient
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Time to start promoting the truth and love as opposed to hate and division.   Purpose brings us together.   Patriotism is a good start!
@RealCandaceO Cant punish the kids because of the parent though!   Tough battle but childcare is so so important with after school care.  Teaching and leading even the most troubled away from poverty.  Something to dream of.   Our children need purpose.   The ‚ÄúAmerican Dream‚Äù and it exists!
@RealJamesWoods They are misjudging us and will realize that their lack of attention to our true needs as a society will be their demise.  Our people need purpose, something to believe in that brings us together without the racial nonsense and hate! Family, Work, intelligence, respect and love
@MSNBC Stop attacking and start working on bringing us together!   The attacks are driving us away from your programming.  You all will regret thinking the people are all ignorant when your revenues are failing.   Unless you are simply propaganda
@BlacksForDTrump @no1important701 @RobertMounger These are state and local issues not the federal government.   The Feds were never intended to be Daddy.   The intent is for each state to make their own laws and the feds ensure security and fairness amongst the union.   Our people do not even realize how we were intended to be
@realDonaldTrump Equal tarrifs helps ensure made at home in any country.   This can only help more than our economy, it helps everyone‚Äôs to limit transportation and enable local manufacturing in each country.  Bigger than most realize! Especially with a growing expanse in populations!!
@SenFeinstein Unfortunately killing another living life is political Senator.   Many people feel differently and it‚Äôs your job to represent the majority of them as opposed to your opinion.   At this point every human bears their own sin so.
@BernieSanders The job / apartment rental arrangement is strange that‚Äôs for sure.   Seems they should just pay more and let the employees figure out there own housing as opposed to indentured servitude arrangements.
@SenSchumer All the outlets already came out and said the story was bogus Senator.   Don‚Äôt divide.   Bring together it will bring you more joy!   Peace and love sir
@nytimes Come on they are trying to trap him to protect themselves.   The corruption for so long is coming out!   Wait and enjoy the ensuing cuffs
@ReginaHWWoolf @HillaryClinton Grifter family.   That‚Äôs a stretch.   Seems to me They made it fair and square.  Nothing can fix the hate inside if no one is willing to open their eyes to reality which is our Country is booming and the infighting is getting less every day.   Peaceful conversation helps! No hate
@Tat2edGran @MSNBC @jonathanalter Look at our history.  U.S Steel was the best in the industry and made our nation wealthy!   Even with Tarrifs.   If we manufacture more supply then needed then our cost goes down.   Supply and demand.   Then imagine how fast the other countries will follow suit.   It‚Äôs a big deal
@BarbMuenchen @kwilli1046 @therealroseanne Strange I thought she was Latino but then again I never cared enough to check.   All the ‚ÄúWe should come together‚Äù yet still the desire to divide us all is deep with the Dems.    Can‚Äôt really call them liberal anymore more like thieving Socialists.   Either way why the race bait?
@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK MSNBC what is your agenda?   Ours is to watch your ratings fall and you to go out of business.  Propaganda machine!
@SenBlumenthal Richard you almost made it 24 hours without casting blame.   Disappointed
@trimetfan @MSNBC @jonathanalter Watch and see mama!   The Midwest is very eager
@prouddeplorab @LionelMedia Read the story I didn‚Äôt make it up.   The report showed an unarmed gun in his back pocket.  Either way it‚Äôs sad for the kids
@BreitbartNews Yet hardly any coverage
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Actually she did defend them in opposition to Trump.   Go back and Watch her rants.   Why is this even a topic.   Both sides should only want this type of violence to stop and peace prevail
@gr8tjude @votetrump77 @BarracudaMama I can‚Äôt see her making it back into office after the nonstop desire to divide us and turn us against each other!
@BackTheCops Of corse
@MSNBC @jonathanalter When the mills open back up in Pennsylvania and we are supplying all of our own steel won‚Äôt that be a bonus for us!
@TuckerCarlson @RodStryker Divide and conquer.    Why else would the Dems push the angle!
@LionelMedia Yes he had a handgun however it was his home it was in his pocket and not loaded.   The $ is a slap in the face in my opinion and I appreciate all of our officers trying to protect us.   Some make unchangeable mistakes and prices should be paid for it
@BlacksForDTrump I can‚Äôt see why any of our citizens would align themselves with them!   Very strange phenomenon
@SenSchumer Chuck the divider!   We thought you were headed back on track Senator
@SenFeinstein Reproductive rights?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Then help fix it Nancy instead of just complaining all the time you are looking ridiculous to us.   You are supposed to lead.   Lead with respect and dignity! Bipartisan would help
@HillaryClinton Really?   And your trying to cast blame to Trump.   Huh.  So what you are implying is speaking of the Presidents Daughter with such disrespect and wanting to pay for abortions is better.   So messed up where has our Country gone? Glad you aren‚Äôt our leader
@thecjpearson @RodStryker @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Nice speech young man.
@PostOpinions @davidfrum Dividers how about writing something that isn‚Äôt a jab for a change.   Especially at a person hired to tell us what‚Äôs going on.   Ridiculous.   You all seems like traitors lately
@marcushjohnson stop with the attacks based on skin weather it be biased one way or the other.   It IS a different world out there than it was even in the 70‚Äôs.  We have come to far to throw it away over politics and bashing.   Let love, Peace and a desire for trust create the country we desire
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Enough!   Get over yourself and your alignments
@Thomas1774Paine @RodStryker Huh. Wonder why
@RealCandaceO Keep strong and don‚Äôt let them divide you!   Family and love first!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Sure is a lot of hate being slung around.    How the heck do we. Get this nonsense to stop?
@NBCNews Holy smokes is that a positive post about the current administration.   Wow didn‚Äôt think you had it in you NBC
@abour098 love the name!   I share it with you but with a Y.
@driverminnie Disappointing Minnie as we have always enjoyed watching your movies.   We are curious how much time you have spent with Ivanka?   Why the hatred from someone made very wealthy from our society?
@TomArnold @KristySwansonXO @realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza He pardon someoneone who isn‚Äôt Caucasian and he‚Äôs racist for it.   Your argument lacks even the simplest logic.   Stop spewing hate!  Start spreading Love if you have it in you
@NBCNews Guess me better get back in the lead for making the worlds best steel and aluminum!    To bad it had to go this route!   He‚Äôs not bluffing people
@AFreeBlackMan None of that matters.   We love who we love!
@realDonaldTrump Ignore the haters!   The real patriots believe in you
@SenSchumer Enough Division Senator.   We are sick of you all doing this nonsense!   Work for the people!   Term limits and remove lifetime pay in my opinion!   You are supposed to represent the best of us not the worst!
@PrisonPlanet Not always the case though!   I lived in Columbus Ohio with many Somalis and not once was treated poorly.    People from everywhere can be bad.   Hence what jails are for.
@bekahdon @sally_field @POTUS Our people have forgotten respect!    Not all though.  It is a daily choice to be kind
@Hurl71 @fassler_cynthia @MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not perfect either!   None of us are which people seems to forget!  Have a good day thanks for the kind posts
@Hurl71 @fassler_cynthia @MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Interesting how that works huh!   At least it simmers the pot on some of them and spreads some kindness!
@seanhannity On twitter I have been called many things trying to put out loving respectful comments to bring people together however a Nazi.   Come on. When will it stop the Nazis!   I don‚Äôt know if anything worse to call us.   I am an ex Democrat now Republican ‚ÄúPatriot‚Äù  love and respect
@KellyannePolls @washingtonpost Disrespectful!   Sure wish our people could come together and end this infighting
@charliekirk11 @rggbama Ridiculous
@SecPompeo @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Keep fighting!   We the people want peace through strength and communication!
@KanyeWoke @TBSNetwork Completely disrespectful!   Desperate attacks for what??   Ratings?  It‚Äôs not helping the cause they are supposedly supporting!  Peace and Love is the answer not hate
@DonaldJTrumpJr @USA_Patriot2020 Utter nonsense!   We sure wish you all didn‚Äôt have to go through this.   Keep your skin thick and hearts soft!   Love prevails!   Our Apologies yo your family.   Thanks for fighting for every day people!  The people that helped build your families companies and now a presidency !
@AndySalasMMA @Hansolo167 @hebertogonzalez @Real_PeachyKeen Huh I buy Florida avocados pretty cheap.   No where near $3.
@MammaLon That‚Äôs disturbing!   Thanks for posting
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Obviously the man doesn‚Äôt represent our lord and savior that chose to turn the money changers tables over!   Imagine the suffering that could be spared !!
@PattyMurray @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @SenFeinstein Back on target!  Thank you Senator we appreciate your work on issues like this!   Better than attacking the president all day!
@BreitbartNews She should be taken off.   Very improper way of acting for someone supposedly successful!   We as a people should want better
@SenatorTomUdall I do agree with keeping families together.   Wouldn‚Äôt a wall stop these issues.   Especially one with a better bigger door? Meaning easier access for willing honest families to have a better chance at life in America.   Wouldn‚Äôt hurt blocking the drugs too!! @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Equal fair trade.   Equal sanctions.  Better yet everyone get rid of sanctions and build a proper worldwide economy where no man should suffer.   We can still thrive!
@SenBlumenthal On point again sir! Thank you bipartisan first!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President a pardon is right for this man and it would show you want fair justice for all of us!  Please do the right thing sir. https://t.co/JoReSGtohw
@RepAdamSchiff Then we must respectfully ask for him to do so.  Wouldn‚Äôt hurt for you to make a call Sir!  Isn‚Äôt that why you were elected as a man and not a party line!   Take the lead as a man not a politician! @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sure is looking forward to one of you being bipartisan! You?
@johncardillo @Ozetty Just might be the unraveling of the corruption on the other side as well.   Let‚Äôs hope that this investigation drains the swamp of anyone not a TRUE Patriot!  I believe Trump is truly a Patriot! Let‚Äôs hope so! What good is hoping for his failure but our own demise! Peace and Love
@madtravelrn @liberal_resist @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump I am impressed highly with your civility!   Let‚Äôs pray more of us can discuss things with grace!  Hoping. For the best for our amazing nation !
@fassler_cynthia @MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Seems pretty evenly spread if someone is actually trying to count?   For what reason other than division!   We are all Americans with a freedom to choose!  Choose to love not hate! https://t.co/jK7XLKmfmz
@cathy_alarie @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Thanks for not arguing it‚Äôs nice to see the respect.  What if anything could the family do to earn your respect?  Can you imagine being attacked so much.   Must be prettying hard to handle.
@LorrieOTravel Ohh I wasn‚Äôt attacking and yes I did thank you!   Pretty sad state when you can‚Äôt even use your own brand courtesy of the attacks wouldn‚Äôt you agree?
@therealroseanne Aren‚Äôt we all sinners?   Forgiveness is always available when love comes first!  I imagine anyone under a magnifying glass looks evil even those of us that try so hard to put love first.   We are all human and when we stop casting stones we will be truly free! Peace and Love !
@IvankaTrump ..   hang in there we are behind you as a whole.   Don‚Äôt let their negativity spread.   Keep the smile and push for peace!   Thank you!!!
@MSNBC @PhilipRucker Still pushing a negative narrative!   Why not tell us the news and not your objective!  Stop being a divider
@BlacksForDTrump Read his full statements.   Not what you think you heard from the news.   He is not a racist and his supporters are of all races!   Let‚Äôs pray for peace and love!
@RepMaxineWaters Retire already.   All you push is a negative narrative!   Why do you have so much hate inside when our Nation has enabled you to be a ‚Äúleader‚Äù. How about leading with some positive for a change
@SenBlumenthal Stay on target Senator!   Nice to see your attacks simmer down!
@Sheckyi Crooked con man!   Sadly they still put him on the news etc.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Why are you still trying to divide us?   Shouldn‚Äôt you report the whole story!   The narrative fails when the full story is reported!  What happened to honest full coverage of the news as opposed to propaganda.    Sad situation but not our countries fault!   Get real NBC not fake
@HerschelWalker @Angel__Kitty @WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump @POTUS @MistyMayTreanor @MarianoRivera Thank You Herschel!   Help bring us together as a people!
@LionelMedia So they can find something else to attack over.    I say let her live in peace!
@repcleaver Shouldn‚Äôt trade be equal!   Equal tariffs!  If they tax our products shouldn‚Äôt we tax theirs?   We shouldn‚Äôt be hindered by unequal trade practices!   Am I wrong??
@OliverMcGee @therealroseanne Interesting perspective! Sure would be nice to have the race baiting and race card beyond us!   We are one nation of all races!   My heart beats the same as my fellow brothers of all races!  We must stop this nonsense if we are to get beyond the travesties of the past! Love first
@LorrieOTravel Courtesy of a hating media that even wishes to crush the children of their enemies.   Why would they push this narrative if not to cover their own misgivings.   Seems the left can shred someone where as anyone on the right must keep their lips sealed.   Sad state of our union
@srburris @MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Do you think that color makes us different?  We don‚Äôt feel that way!   I refuse to except a narrative of hatred for no reason.   When is the last time you looked past skin and spoke to the person!   We are the same no matter what others are telling you or you ‚ÄúFeel‚Äù.   Love first
@srburris @MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a stretch!  My family is Black, White, and Asian.   If all we see is the negative side then how can we grow!   Stop blaming skin and start pushing kindness!  Imagine what we can be when everyone stops looking for a reason to hate or cast blame!   Has this happened to you?
@madtravelrn @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Thank You!
@InstigatorRules @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Name calling is childish and shows a lack of respect and values!
@InstigatorRules @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Nice try though
@InstigatorRules @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump So you think that because I support this president I didn‚Äôt the other?   That‚Äôs the problem.    I voted for O and I voted for Trump.   Some of us want real change.   A positive outlook wouldn‚Äôt hurt.  Hating only divides us as a people
@trumpsanassh0le @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Let‚Äôs hope not!
@cathy_alarie @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump How about a little bit of positiveness.   Aren‚Äôt these the things we wish to see the president doing!!   No matter what he does people rush to bash him and his family.   So disrespectful
@madtravelrn @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Doesn‚Äôt matter what he does you all will push a negative angle.   How about a little hope!   How about some kindness!  Have we lost all sense of respect as a society!  Let‚Äôs hope not
@melissalees13 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump These are the moments we should be pushing.    Positiveness and kindness.   Hating is only bad for us ALL!   Peace and love prevails
@MissEugenieStok @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Why the race card?   It only divides us!   We are all The same!
@AguiarFritz @InstigatorRules @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump And you never make meeting notes?   Always straight negative
@InstigatorRules @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump How about a little bit of positiveness.   Aren‚Äôt these the things we wish to see the president doing!!   No matter what he does people rush to bash him and his family.   So disrespectful
@BreitbartNews Absolutely false!   Sling isn‚Äôt a defining factor in life.  None of us chose our melanin.    Why try to divide us even more??   Pure politics!   Why not spread love instead of hate
@therealroseanne Screw em!
@RepAdamSchiff Enough Schiff.    We have had enough of your mud slinging and lies.   Retire
@TassajaraRd @FoxNews @POTUS @ArlingtonNatl Whatever bleeding heart Liberal.   All he has done is support the military.   Find a new üéØ target
@NancyPelosi Enough Nancy we are tired of the Lies.   Better to retire before it‚Äôs too late to salvage you name and face.   We used to think you weren‚Äôt like the other politicians but you prove us wrong daily.   Go back to wanting to help the people!   You are good down deep are you? We hope
@KateBekx @DrShayPhD Haha
@DrShayPhD @RealMattCouch Dillard‚Äôs.   That‚Äôs funny Shay.   Sad state our people are in.  The blame game is easy.   I just wished everyone realized none of us chose our color but we all choose to have class.  Class is the issue not race.   Peace and Love
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump That is what they fought for right!  The prosperity of our country.   Shouldn‚Äôt we all be happy!
@davidfrum Still dividing!   Ignorance at its best.   Still attacking no matter what.   Get used to losing we are filling Congress and the Senate with more of his supporters!  The people have had enough of your divisive tactics.   The majority of America are against your actions and words
@realDonaldTrump How you deal with the unjust hatred is impressive.   Not so sure a few twitter posts is all I would say or do if everyone attacked me unjustly or spied on my life!   Never give up!
@realDonaldTrump Keep winning!   Ignore the haters and ignorance!  America is Great let‚Äôs keep it that way!   Thank you to all of our service members!
@FoxNews @ChelseaClinton @POTUS @foxandfriends Who cares what she or her parents think.   Why even give her the press?   Enough coverages of the first Corrupt family!
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton So sick of the divisionist!
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Isn‚Äôt that the Democratic angle.  Push fuel prices up to make him look bad?   Always pandering Ron!   Wake up and realize we are sick of your lies
@angela_rye Why the desire for separation?   Did any of us choose our skin?  Why the diversion/division!   R or D it doesn‚Äôt make someone racist.   Racism is ridiculous period.
@realDonaldTrump So they can bitch for no reason about you
@SenSchumer It‚Äôs a witch hunt just like the republicans did to Bill.   Doesn‚Äôt make it right and it doesn‚Äôt make it something the people want.   We want you to stop the childish behavior and do the job you were voted in to do.   Such nonsense from ‚ÄúWise‚Äù people.    Ridiculous behavior  kids!
@RepAdamSchiff Enough diversion and Lies Schiff.   We no longer believe a ward from you and most of your party.   We would like you to represent US not some special interest corrupt group of donors.   Retire before your name is completely worthless
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Give a logical honest response and nothing.   If we are going to fight back against these lies pushed on Trump and his supporters then we must be heard!   Don‚Äôt let haters and negative mongers decide for you!   Jeff you can‚Äôt be what your party is asking you to be!  Patriot first
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump The intention is to have the best people doing each government job.   Shouldn‚Äôt we be able to hire the best person for the job without ‚Äúunions‚Äù propping up lazy or unqualified personnel!
@YoungDems4Trump He may not be the man he‚Äôs been made out to be.   Let‚Äôs hope he wants to bring peace and prosperity to his people and we are the suppliers of their food.   America can feed the world and we benefit !  Peace first!
@ShShShShShSh555 @votetrump77 @I__BORG @CBSNews Sad period .  If we had the wall with a big door in it as suggested with easier access for desperate people it  would eliminate these atrocities!  The wall can be more than a deterrent with proper management
@therealroseanne Tell us what you think?  Heck I‚Äôm curious.   There is so much out there when searching for the truth.   It‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs what other than his twitter feeds which he seems to lay it all out there.   You know the man.   Is he a true Patriot?
@PressSec Awesome to see the leadership!   Bring us together the people want to be united!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Keep trudging Jr.  at least your old man stepped up to try and change this political mess we got into!   We are hoping he is a true Patriot!   We appreciate the sacrifices!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I bet you enjoy those little snaps of the towel!  Cracks me up for you to call them out like you do.  Be safe Mr. President.   I hope you are the man we think you are.   A Patriot!
@therealroseanne If people want to watch it who cares.  If he is the class act he portrays himself to be maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad for our division especially if he can make peace after the misdeeds.  We did believe in his change that didn‚Äôt come! #MAGA now @realDonaldTrump is making the change
@VP How about peace and we lift sanctions.   The way they choose to govern is up to them as long as it doesn‚Äôt hinder human rights or our Sovereignty.   Peace and Love
@RealJamesWoods Birds of a feather flock together
@RealJamesWoods Must be super painful.   They all must be thinking..   what other pictures am I possibly in with criminals?  The lightbulb then pops on as they realize all of them because they are the criminals.
@realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt give up!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You couldn‚Äôt secure peace with them Pocahontas why throw stones.   You and Nancy need to retire we are sick of hearing your divisive speak.
@SenBlumenthal These are the things we are counting on you to work on!   Stay focused
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Whatever Chuck
@RepAdamSchiff And are you one of the liars?
@SenBlumenthal Thanks for your service!  The real men that died in Vietnam and the blood and minds spent for our freedom in all wars deserve more and expect more from you!  Rather you fought or not you chose to serve and working with our chosen POTUS is the start.   You can change things! https://t.co/QKuwbsDnQe
@JohnKasich I like you but I hope this isn‚Äôt some screw the police type of message.  Many cops can be a bit extreme but they are dealing with non stop nonsense all day!   a meter maid?   It is their job to specifically do it.   And I hate getting ticketsüëÄ.   I personally think we need law
@SenBlumenthal The more you do this the more corrupt you look?   You must have been bought???   We are listening üëÇ
@SenBlumenthal Keep trying to divide us!   It‚Äôs not working.   We see through your lies
@Serenity3_18 @SenJeffMerkley And there you go straight down the rabbit hole of anger and mud slinging.   Then again you want to remove the ability for our people to arm themselves
@Serenity3_18 @SenJeffMerkley If Merkley were to confront the topic with bipartisan effort he will work with him.   Test the waters and see Jeff!   Isn‚Äôt it about the people and not party want?
@Serenity3_18 @SenJeffMerkley I figure you have all the answers so feel free to teach rather than attack.  Trump has said he wants to unleash our energy production and even push to exports.   He works with every person who desires real changes so our reps on both sides should work together and provide a bill!
@Serenity3_18 @SenJeffMerkley Inhabi who?   Come on now you can do better than that
RT @phil4gop: In October ‚Äò16 Obama said rigging an election couldn‚Äôt be done		Then why was a spy hired to join Trump‚Äôs camp in July ‚Äò16 if‚Ä¶
@Evan_McMullin Half truths, diversion and lies that‚Äôs what you are selling these days huh??

@ShawnRobb3 @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump And what evidence that is real do you have to support your claims?
@RonWyden You must be corrupt throwing fits this way.   Are you on the take or something and diversion / division is all you have.   Shame on you Senator you are supposed to lead us with dignity and be someone our children look up to!

@SenSchumer Is that because peace could not be made by prior administrations and you hate the fact that he is making world wide changes to stop the hatred and killing!   Why wouldn‚Äôt we celebrate peace?   It‚Äôs a coin for heavens sake!   Stop politicizing every possible angle!  BiPartisan!!
@NancyPelosi Hurry push misdirection!   Why not push coming together!  Why not push peace!   Why not push love!  Why not push patriotism!   Why oh why are you pushing us apart as opposed to together?   Are you hiding something??   Seems that way

@therealroseanne That‚Äôs because the people want to see the banter and mindsets they are being forced to hide.   The media has made honest good people out to be things we aren‚Äôt.   Conservatives must hold their tongue or risk being attacked for their ideology.   Sad times in America
@therealroseanne Or at least try.   Even when your children come home being blinded by ideology that isn‚Äôt your own.   Calmly explain what work is.   What saving is.   And most of all what Love is.

@DavidAFrench Yeah let‚Äôs not take this too far.
@MSNBC Sounds more like the Clintons to me
@SenSanders This is true.  The only problem is your fellow politicians on both sides would rather divide us than bring us together!    We want the old Bernie back for good.   Shed the Dems and go back to independent

@MSNBC Then hire some Americans that want jobs.   If the caps are met then they should find a workforce willing to do the work.   Unemployment still has claims I‚Äôm sure some of them would be willing to learn a new trade.  Stop dividing and look for real solutions @realDonaldTrump
@SenSanders Senator.. Why are you trying to divide us instead of uniting us.   China must be kept as a friend while we rebuild our manufacturing prowess.    We aren‚Äôt all as ignorant as you think! @realDonaldTrump
@SenFeinstein Shouldn‚Äôt it be the best qualified person gets the job.   Race or gender isn‚Äôt a deciding factor when it comes to experience.   Or at least it shouldn‚Äôt be.    Why the divisive speak.   Then again it seems my old party just wants to put us in categories and segregate us
@RealEagleWings I like the positive news!
@DRUDGE_REPORT That‚Äôs a bit rough for the Catholic Church!

@SenSanders Capitalism Bernie.    Amazon is killing them just like wal mart killed Kmart etc.   stop spreading half truths
@RepAdamSchiff Enough Schiff you had your day in the spotlight and you failed to dance.    Not many believe your misleading statements.   Shouldn‚Äôt have tried to cover for H or last admins mistakes!!

@SenBlumenthal Personal dislikes are allowed.   If America loved McCain so much he would have been President.   I imagine if McCain hadn‚Äôt lashed out so hard at the administration it would be different now.   Maybe you a known liar should spread love instead of a gossip channel!  Listen more

@beckdogenator @Megs_WYSIWYG @Haroldj111 @Bru__ce @SenBlumenthal I agree on the Twitter however how else can he get a message through the media when they are biased?  DACA is a mess and has been.

@beckdogenator @Megs_WYSIWYG @Haroldj111 @Bru__ce @SenBlumenthal Nothing will allow you to see through the attacks.   How about looking into our tax breaks.   How about him fixing the NK situation.

@beckdogenator @Megs_WYSIWYG @Haroldj111 @Bru__ce @SenBlumenthal You unfortunately do not seem to care about how our country works.

@SenWhitehouse Sheldon it‚Äôs bs to remove the president we the people wanted.   Better get back on board with us.   This nonsense is getting old
@jihchs @Sky_Patriot @RodStryker @w_terrence Happens to me to..   except usually I get berated for my small errors.   Sometimes people forget nobody is perfect
@kanyewest   How can we get over the horrible past of our country?? By seeing all can be free now and we all are not held back but in our own minds.   If we all knew this I believe what our founders envisioned for one race can be true for all now!   Love, Forgiveness, is answer https://t.co/Oyb1iLQORq
@HoofHugs @RodStryker @w_terrence Thanks I didn‚Äôt know that but the race baiting is getting so old!
@Sky_Patriot @RodStryker @w_terrence Didn‚Äôt know he owned it btw.   That‚Äôs ü•ú.
@Sky_Patriot @RodStryker @w_terrence I like the respectfulness of your message thank you for love first!   If we all did this our World would be very different.
@Sky_Patriot @RodStryker @w_terrence I get it trust me!  However I am so tired of people trying to divide us!    This Race baiting is not good for our people!  It needs to end like slavery did!   I am in a very mixed race family and we feel like people keep pushing race when in reality it‚Äôs nothing about race.
RT @Lrihendry: I am ashamed of Republicans for allowing our president to be beaten up on a daily basis and not lifting one stinking finger‚Ä¶
@RodStryker @w_terrence Not so actually.   A quick visit to snopes will give you the true detail.  https://t.co/27Cu1bbLSh
@BlacksForDTrump @realDailyWire @benshapiro I hate seeing any of our citizens fighting each other.   Our country needs to learn how to respectfully disagree
@SenFeinstein The press is owned by those that wish to keep us divided it seems!   Why else are they pushing racism stories and printing hatred instead of just the straight facts.
@BreitbartNews I‚Äôm calling bull!    How about the fact that he is trying to free the minds of our citizens that are trapped in class warfare that is shrouded in racism.   No one chose their skin.   Enough with trying to turn our people against each other!
@SenWarren No buts.  You lost us already by endorsing a criminal.   Why should you be part of negotiations when the reality is you did not have the ability to even get us to this point.
Great message from a great friend! https://t.co/MgtmkDdDL9
@seanhannity We are so sick of this mud slinging and negativity!    For Heaven sakes would it hurt to root for leader for a change.   He is leading us ‚ÄúWe The People‚Äù.   Have some of us forgot that it‚Äôs all of us under this establishment that was elected by OUR people!  We have minds!
@RepAdamSchiff If you would start working for us instead of the silly Russia crap and get along with @POTUS  then maybe the response would be different.   You are losing many of us by doing this to OUR Country against the majority of our wishes!
@SenGillibrand And may I ask how the situation with out of control insurance prices started.   Senator this started as a Democrat idea.   Unfortunately these problems were already there and the affordable healthcare act ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù is what got us into this mess.   Let‚Äôs hope for a fix!
@ChrisVanHollen @SenateDems Thank you!   These are the types of things we want happening not just nonstop political attacks.
@SenBlumenthal  https://t.co/ZQm6tFTZkB
@SenSchumer Senator enough is enough.   Will you not stop until our country is completely divided?
@SenBlumenthal It is really hard to believe anything you say.   Most people realize you lie to us and manipulate everything for your own political gain.   Get back to representing ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù and stop attacking the president.

@BreitbartNews Ahh.  The only reason he had so many seasons on SOA anyway was Charlie!  Are we actually listening to someone that speaks in this manner?  Why are you even writing this JUNK!   It‚Äôs divisive and as you wrote he isn‚Äôt even speaking truths! #MAGA!
@SiddonsDan @RealEagleWings @WayneDupreeShow If they are willing to work, speak our language and be a loyal American then we should have a far easier path to becoming a Resident or Citizen of the USA.  I recall Trump saying a wall with a big door that allows people to come here easier legally..  @realDonaldTrump  and I‚Äôm R!
@alexwagner @chrislhayes @nprfreshair I have mixed race children and I sure hope they aren‚Äôt lonely inside because of their skin!   I am hoping that many many years of a mixed race marriage to their mother has showed them that love prevails and skin is no longer relevant.   The thought of them being lonely is painful
@RepAdamSchiff Aren‚Äôt we wanting to get people self sufficient???
@JohnDingell Dingell you had your moment.   Why stoop to the same level as your former cohorts.
@SenatorTester time to step down!
@MeetThePress @SenatorTester Stand aside and let a Patriot take your place.  Lies and spreading fake stories is not what your position should be about.   Very disturbing from any party member!  America first politics second!  Senator we are disappointed you let yourself get pulled into this ignorance.  #MAGA
@Lrihendry @RodStryker @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not for what‚Äôs going on however look at the map and tell me the People from Honduras have a better option.   I did mission work for years in Honduras.  The people don‚Äôt even have water and sanitation in parts of the country.   The walk from Honduras has taken too many lives!
@JudiMcBeeOCDS @DeptofDefense @FrJoshuaJanko Cute little expression and eyes.   Reminds me of my Toby :-)
At least with the new topic of discussion on Twitter I am not being accused of being a bot..   lol...  funny how the sheep follow the exact path they are led down.   Open your eyes and pick your path based on your own thoughts not the media.  #MAGA
@BlacksForDTrump Why oh why must they spew hate.   An apology and a move in the right direction together would change everything now but they insist on keeping going down a nasty path.   And they blame Trumps supporters.  Hoping for a change in hate ideology from the Dems
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I am sorry you had to watch your daughter be treated so horribly.   Kindness seems to be forgotten these days.  Stay strong!  #MAGA
@PressSec sending my apologies for the way you were treated!   Unacceptable and vile.   The tradition of hurting one another for entertainment has gone too far.
@RealKyleMorris @Veteran4Trump And they imply conservatives are the evil ones.   Blatant nasty below the belt attacks.   I believe this ‚Äútradition‚Äù of roasting has gone too far.  We must communicate kindly to get anything done
@Ldydewood @Dampalow @TrumpTracking @KaraCalavera I don‚Äôt watch fox but keep trying.   Normal mentality of pointing a finger and attacks.   Enjoy the hate
@PoliticusSarah Disrespectful!   No wonder Trump held a rally.   If that were your family member would you find it acceptable?
@therbert03 @AngelaTN777 @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Bashing to bash.

@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Thanks for the debate have a great night.
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera What if.  Just what if he is actually helping us.  Hopefully he is.  Otherwise we as a nation are in trouble.   Let‚Äôs hope that for our sake he‚Äôs not what he is being made out to be.   Is he rich, arrogant, cocky, bold yes.   Traitor.   I highly doubt.   Or at least I hope
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera I guess when you only focus on the intense dislike of a person it‚Äôs hard to see any good in them when it does exist
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Even both sides in Korea agreed if not for him it wouldn‚Äôt happen
@SueSmith587 @TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Not hoping for anything.   Btw
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera And you don‚Äôt think the other side set the stage at all?   I believe they are pushing non existent lies to keep the status quo
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera All are mostly except @DrRandPaul .   He is our president and hoping and praying for his success is ours too.   His failure would be worse for us
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera The pay to play seemed to be at a level unjustified with prev admins.   I hope that with Trumps background he disliked having to do that and wants to change it.   He has stuck to his ‚Äúagenda‚Äù. So far and hasn‚Äôt changed since early interviews.   I believe he is arrogant but they
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Wouldn‚Äôt you agree that our leadership at the time should have never allowed the transfer ?   I was a Democrat for the majority of my adult life.   The pay to play is wrong both sides.   What if he fixes that too.   I am hoping for the best.   Korea is a good start right?
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Uranium to Russia...   pay to play Clinton foundation.  Smashing hard drives/erasing all info.   Emails showing corruption.   DNC screwing Bernie the list goes on and on.   Bernie should have had the nomination if not for the dnc.   How else do politicians make millions in office
@TrumpTracking @Dampalow @KaraCalavera Completely agree if he did collude he shouldn‚Äôt be president however the evidence seems to point the other way.  Thank you for the cordial response.   Doesn‚Äôt happen much usually just attacks
@JerseyStrong11 Funny I thought you said medicine will help delusions.
@JerseyStrong11 Love how you repost my responses like they are bad.   I imagine it‚Äôs hard to handle all that hate and anger inside.   Then again you hide your name and everything else.   Nothing like hiding behind a phone/computer
@JerseyStrong11 Maybe after you get the meds you spoke of you will not have so much hate in you anymore.
@JerseyStrong11 Do you need me to help you find a physician that will help you get the meds you need?
@JerseyStrong11 Will be praying for you to see the light :-)
@JerseyStrong11 Guess what!   He is all of our president and has done more for peace worldwide than the previous 4  presidents.
@JerseyStrong11 That‚Äôs dirt being thrown when you don‚Äôt know me.   Just because someone wants the best for our country isn‚Äôt hate.   That‚Äôs the thing casting insults and racism, and lies to pressure others to keep quiet.  You can insinuate whatever you like! Reality is the hate is from the left!
@Dampalow @TrumpTracking @KaraCalavera Now that‚Äôs comical.   Flipping the circumstances.   Watch as corrupt Dems and Repubs start going to jail.    Trump may be rough around the edges but he‚Äôs a Patriot.   Feel free to comment back on this thread when the cuffs come out for those that are really corrupt
@DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN Pretty funny Jr.   I was surprised as well
RT @SheriffClarke: Like I said in a previous tweet. Dr. Ronnie Jackson's lynching had nothing to do with thorough vetting. It had everythin‚Ä¶
@NewsBud_ @TruthPirateUSA Well isn‚Äôt that surprising
How can anyone say Trump is not doing a good job when our enemies are folding and our Economy is booming!  He may not speak eloquently but he sure has the balls to stand up to them! I am proud he is our president and isn‚Äôt taking any crap!  ‚ÄúWe chose him‚Äù. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
@TrumpTracking @KaraCalavera However non stop attacks against his father are ok.   If he were my father and people were lying about him nonstop I would be very upset as well.   A lot of our people have forgotten to have respect because social media has made them able to hide behind a keyboard.

@grailsnail @KaraCalavera I don‚Äôt hate them I voted for Bill and Obama once each.   I believe the issue is that you are being told that it‚Äôs fair both ways however it isn‚Äôt.   Hate is hate.   Love is love.   So are you angry because you think all conservatives are racist and hate Muslims etc.   We aren‚Äôt
@jontester you should do the honorable thing and step down.    The vile antics are so disheartening to us.   How dare you.   Outright lying for what.   Media attention??   Very disturbing to see the outright lies
@USATrump45 @AKACRAIG Ouch
@1Uziah @Roahso @geo_jerome @MarissaEstelle @BlacksForDTrump @TomiLahren Yikes I guess you haven‚Äôt figured out that we are all the same and that not one of us chose our skin, native language etc.    Love is the answer not hate!
@KaraCalavera Pretty disheartening the anger, hostility, and disgust for people you only know through media outlets.   Must be hard to sleep at night with the hate
@terism1 @realDonaldTrump Was it you then Teri that called them out and is bringing peace through strength?   This is bigger than one man however that one man is picking the people that are bringing peace.   Don‚Äôt we all want to live in peace and stop the killing?
@GovMikeHuckabee @OpenThePrimary Now that‚Äôs comical!   Thanks for the entertainment
@JohnBrennan Meaningless words.   Blah blah keep trying
@SenSchumer Say what???    Educate us then on the deficit from the previous presidents.  EVERY president has raised the dept ceiling for the past 25 years along with the house and Senate!   I thought you were starting to listen but I guess not sir
@IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @moonriver365 Thank your father for us.   All the hell he is taking and is still fighting for us.   Even the ones that do not realize the battle he is in for our people!
@kanyewest It‚Äôs called a typo Se‚ÄôVon.   You probably have never misspelled or had auto correct change a word right!  Hating is bad for your soul why not kindness and a desire for us as a people to come together.   Slinging mud and insults is not the answer love and respect is.  Peace
@Chicago1Ray @KatTheHammer1 @RealCandaceO Isn‚Äôt every citizen doing better and safer!    Race is not chosen.   Race is merely something made up by man.   God calls us all his people!   Melanin shouldn‚Äôt be used to divide us

@Comey We wanted to trust you sir however you chose the wrong side and chose not to stand up for our Democracy!    If one of us ‚Äúnormal‚Äù citizens lied like yourself we would have been jailed.    We just can‚Äôt believe what you say.   Very sad for USA!

I can‚Äôt seem to understand how a party that had no intention of stopping slavery or allowing someone to have a voice can label conservatives racist when their party is the one with a history of such atrocities.

With mixed ‚Äúrace‚Äù children the division really disturbs me.    We have come so far to be dragged down by haters and divisive power hungry men.   Let‚Äôs set the example !!
@Politics_Suxx @websitenut @kylegriffin1 @MichaelAvenatti @TheDemCoalition Oh I get it completely what your saying.  You‚Äôre implying that he is basically embezzling money to his companies etc.   I don‚Äôt recall many people praising him donating his paycheck back and working for free.   CNN and Fox are manipulating our people into this division!
@Politics_Suxx @1markshumway @brandon_r_horan @kylegriffin1 Are you so sure he is all those things?  His friends of color say he is not racist.  I imagine we could all get  full of ourselves if we made billions too.  I‚Äôm not saying bow to him but at least root for the things he is doing that help us.    The attacks both ways are silly
@Politics_Suxx @websitenut @kylegriffin1 @MichaelAvenatti @TheDemCoalition So what he should do is go to another property then like the others presidents.   Your argument is pretty weak considering ALL presidents have taken heat for the same crap.  It‚Äôs ridiculous to think he should just stay in dc etc.   do you have hobbies?
@Politics_Suxx @1markshumway @brandon_r_horan @kylegriffin1 Oh and the race card.   Really?   Not one of us chose our skin.   You‚Äôre just falling right into the division our politicians want.   Hope you can get beyond your hate üëçüèª
@Politics_Suxx @1markshumway @brandon_r_horan @kylegriffin1 So what your saying is that because others treated the previous president poorly that it gives you the right to retaliate against the current president.    That‚Äôs logical.   How about rooting for your country as opposed to bashing.   A little positive thought goes a long way
@1markshumway @brandon_r_horan @kylegriffin1 I really don‚Äôt need your approval so!!!   Enjoy the hating ü§•üëÄ
@websitenut @kylegriffin1 @MichaelAvenatti @TheDemCoalition He OWNS the property.   Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt use your property or belongings.   So comical.   I truly enjoy reading all these brainwashed statements.
@brandon_r_horan @kylegriffin1 Nice way to turn it racial.   Why oh why.   Not everyone thinks in your same device manipulative manner.   Skin is not chosen so why must people insist that it is a factor in anything.   P.S. Obama was more than one ‚Äúrace‚Äù
@kylegriffin1 He does own it.   Should you be begrudged of your belongings to be President.   I remember every other President doing far worse!   Think!!
@realDonaldTrump Ignore the haters they have been brainwashed
@DonColtsfan @SenSchumer Meaning taxing it like alcohol and controlling the sale of it to licensed ‚Äúproviders‚Äù.   Everything can be abused is my response to your alcohol comment.   Jesus turned water to wine not the opposite.   I personally do not believe people should go to prison over marijuana
So much crap thrown at a normal human being with more financial advantage than most.   If the stones cast are from lust and coveting than are they founded?  Aren‚Äôt we all sinning humans trying for greatness??  @realDonaldTrump

@SenSchumer There we go Chuck.   Something we actually want you to do.   Why are we incarcerating people over Marijuana.  By being illegal it funds illlegal operations, when if we managed it like alcohol it would change our criminal system completely and actually benefit society!  Nice sir!
@realDonaldTrump No but they are trying to make you look bad any way they can.   Keep winning and hopefully they will give up the charades
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Stop throwing tantrums and complaining Nancy.
@kylegriffin1 To whom I already believe Jesus Christ died for our sins.   Peace and Love is the answer not infighting like children!  Maybe if the attacks would simmer he wouldn‚Äôt be so bold.   Wouldn‚Äôt you be bold and upset if you were declared something you weren‚Äôt.
@SenWhitehouse Bought corrupt statement.  Why would you support someone working for peace with Korea when it seems all that‚Äôs wanted is war by you and our representatives .   War and killing is not the answer PEACE is.    Please start working on that as opposed to infighting.   #MAGA

@lynxlily Ok I read it.   On the issues with the fathers properties it‚Äôs possible.  Unfortunately our history is dotted with such behavior however why do the people that ‚Äúknow‚Äù him say it‚Äôs false especially our brothers and sisters of color.   Is he great no but we could be a bit patient!

@lynxlily Actually yes when I was a child our home was heated with coal at one point.
@lynxlily I gotta go back to work.  Feel free to delete comments if you like I don‚Äôt mind
@lynxlily It‚Äôs not like the old days.   Modern manufacturing facilities are cleaner
@lynxlily So are we to cut down our Forrest‚Äôs for steel or put o2 scrubbers on the stacks.   Currently we scrub the stacks even in electrical production and it is cleaner for the environment than oil
@lynxlily Yes it can be made that way however it is inferior to the modern coking method.
@lynxlily https://t.co/k7dz77T4aZ
@lynxlily However not the case for hardened steel.   From what I am aware of the Coke for hardened steel only comes from NK or USA.   I may be wrong but I don‚Äôt think so.    Never offended btw if I‚Äôm wrong teach me.   Snowflake term is funny though you have to admit I have 2 üò¨
@lynxlily How is Steel Produced?	Global steel production is dependent on coal. 74% of the steel produced today uses coal. Metallurgical coal ‚Äì or coking coal ‚Äì is a vital ingredient in the steel making process. World crude steel production was 1.6 billion tonnes in 2017.
@lynxlily Coke is coal red
@lynxlily Iron ore takes carbon to become steel.  It gets that carbon from coal.
@lynxlily You should delete that red and look up how hardened steel is made.  No offense taken btw
@lynxlily Ahh. Don‚Äôt let things you really can‚Äôt change ruin your very important life.
@lynxlily We are much better off than even 50 years ago.   Manufacturing techniques have changed in the USA and abroad.   With oil soon to fade for transport it will only get better also
@lynxlily Coal is needed for steel.   Steel is needed for manufacturing.  We used to lead the world in steel production.   Steel manufacturing abilities are important to national security..
@lynxlily All theory though
@lynxlily Nice reply
@lynxlily They all try to divide us.  Ever heard of divide and conquer
@lynxlily What education are you referring to?   And do you have that education that allows you to comprehend the theory that co2 has weight on the temperature.   We are talking a small fraction of a degree.   Hasn‚Äôt the earth been warming since the last ice age??
@lynxlily I can see the anger in it however when you are competing against everyone else for market share aren‚Äôt the incentives there to make as much as possible.    Hence needs for either tariffs or some way of controlling manipulating of currencies.   Just look at China‚Äôs currency etc
@lynxlily Nope.   Not sure on carbon because I‚Äôm not educated in the topic other than hearsay.   Trophy hunting is and will always be around.  Disgusts me to kill anything other than for food but that‚Äôs me.  As far as the lies??  His lies seem to be less than the previous 3
@lynxlily Actually not the case.  Vietnam isn‚Äôt the sweatshop you think.   Ho Chi Minh city and most of Vietnam‚Äôs cities where things are made are very modern and current with the times.   A dollar here is small here but big there.  Hence the difference in ‚Äúcost‚Äù after converting $$
@lynxlily I just see it different but always nice to debate with you Red.   Hope school is good.   And your title fits lol.   You are Sassy
@lynxlily If the market allows it isn‚Äôt it ok to sell ‚ÄúExpensive‚Äù things made elsewhere.   I can‚Äôt even imagine the ‚Äúgolden spoon‚Äù. But it doesn‚Äôt sound horrible for a father to believe in his son and invest..  If I can for my girls I will wouldn‚Äôt you?
@lynxlily Ahhh ask every person you know if they got more in their check.  I did and I‚Äôm not 1%.   All my plumber, electrician, mechanic and everything else tradesman are getting more in the checks.    War is never pretty btw and that‚Äôs what it seems to be in Washington
@lynxlily Yep and I have an old Trump Tie from years ago made in Vietnam I believe.   Wife‚Äôs Vietnamese so...   turning a mil into billions is no small feat
@lynxlily Tax breaks for the every day man.   Double the deduction.   Working towards term limits.   If they were ‚Äúbought‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt they be held accountable like we would be?
@lynxlily My morals are fine btw.   Love my family and help as many needy as possible including missions in Honduras.   I‚Äôm just sick of bought politicians getting handouts while most of the rest of us earn our living and pay our taxes honorably
@lynxlily I like the progress of his work.   That may be a better term.   Corrupt Comey, McCabe, Clinton‚Äôs etc.     all bought how else do they become millionaires as public servents.   Even Bernie has made millions.   Seems corrupt am I right..??
@lynxlily I can‚Äôt lie I like him.   He rattles their cages and they are corrupt.
@lynxlily If he‚Äôs corrupt then him too.   I‚Äôm not loyal to corruption.   However I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case but who really knows.....

@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott There were.   Police cruisers everywhere.   As to unlabeled would the unlabeled be shooting anyone with a gun shooting children or guiding innocents out etc.?  You don‚Äôt have experience of the situation though so..    trust me I will take someone trying to help
@BlacksForDTrump @d1Vinman @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I like you young man your humor is on point!
@BlacksForDTrump @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends They want to portray Trump as evil even when I see him and Melanie looking to be good caring people...he just doesn‚Äôt take any crap from anyone.    Don‚Äôt we want that as a leader.   A strong yet flexible person!
@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott I like how you like your own replies btw.   That‚Äôs odd
@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott 1988 Pinellas Park.   I watched it with my own eyes and feel differently than you that‚Äôs all.  I‚Äôm in the majority so...
@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott I can see you aren‚Äô changing your mind.   If the day comes when someone comes to your door with guns and your a target you might rethink your thoughts.   I was against till robbed because saw principle get shot in H.S. I would like to be equally equipped next time ones in my face
@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott We are regulated can you purchase a fully automatic weapon on the open market without permitting?  No. Can you buy a Grenada launcher etc.  no.   To what extent shall it be regulated.   Should it be Waco style regulation where fbi kills for them?  And I‚Äôm no Waco wacko supporter
@addict_reality @drdweiss2 @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott One other thing not to post excessively on your thread..   the founders wrote the constitution many many years ago if you want to blame them then blame them for our freedoms.   We could have much worse
@addict_reality @drdweiss2 @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott You don‚Äôt outnumber us yet.   But when your time comes I hope you can keep your enthusiasm.   Unfortunately changing the constitution is a bit of a stretch.  Read the second and think worse case scenario do you want a gun when the crap hits the fan??

@brucewilson @davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott Yeah and what would you do if those guns turned on you?   That‚Äôs the point of the second.    A well armed militia.
@davidhogg111 @marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott The second Amendment young man is about more than the tragedy that has taken place.   I understand the thought process as I went to Pinellas Park HS I witnessed 1988 shootings, However it‚Äôs about fighting tyranny if it should come!   The 2nd is imperative for freedom like we have
@BlacksForDTrump No thought goes into their ‚Äúplans‚Äù.  Who does this type of things hurt? ....Uh hello all the workers, the sub contract delivery guys, and the list goes on and on.    It‚Äôs like they are programmed or something
@SenBillNelson   Vote for us on the net.  Aren‚Äôt we dealing with monopolies enough already
@SenBillNelson You are my representative sir and I like everyone I know believes the 2nd shouldn‚Äôt be infringed upon!   It‚Äôs not about an opinion. It is part of what was built and keeps us strong.  Although tragic we will endure! It‚Äôs Bi-Partisan and shouldn‚Äôt be changed.
@marcorubio proud conservative supporter.   Please vote for our benefit on the net not corporations controlling it.   I would hope you are even better versed than I on the topic so vote accordingly for US!
@CamEdwards @seanmdav I‚Äôm not so sure people are thinking about the future of our ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù The situation however sad is about more than the loss of life it‚Äôs about everything our Democracy was built on!   The point of the 2nd was to say the govt had no say! State background checks etc yes ban no!
@realDonaldTrump please keep your word sir!   We are all saddened by the loss of life and feel horribly for everyone involved even the supposed cowards that didn‚Äôt lesson the loss.   However the 2nd is for We the people.  You are 1 of US. 2nd keeps US free! https://t.co/2RrCPkUB0C
We could all learn from this Patriot!   Even in loss..LOVE and happiness can endure.   We are blessed with the memories and the love that remains in the heart. https://t.co/uvSMJAOe6E

@SenBlumenthal Yet you a proven liar should?   Right
@NBCNews The tweets keep us informed no matter if we like the verbiage or not.   How else can he easily get it out to us that some of our reps are corrupt bought monsters.   The governor doesn‚Äôt speak for all of us that‚Äôs for sure
@BretBaier @seanmdav All BS to push a corrupt agenda and bash a true Patriotic president !   We are smarter than they think we are
@DaveWeasel @chelseahandler Wouldn‚Äôt anyone she‚Äôs very beautiful and smart.   Nothing like taking things to the extreme out of context.
@chelseahandler Because it‚Äôs her father.   You are sick Chelsea.   What kind of woman implies this when obviously he is a very loving and loyal father.   You are a disgusting vile human for implying such filth.   Your hatred is bad for your soul.   To think I used to enjoy your humor.   Bad biz!
@BernieSanders The constitution doesn‚Äôt say hunting Bernie.   It says to fight back in the event the govt becomes oppressive.
@SenBlumenthal That‚Äôs what we want Senator!   More of this!
@marcorubio Excellent reply Senator.    I imagine your job has become a very rough one.   Best wishes for you
@AnnCoulter @united It‚Äôs merely a fight to get Trump to do something to lose his base!    I don‚Äôt imagine he will do something to lose what he fought to represent
@SenFeinstein Also why hasn‚Äôt anyone ever tried to invade us.   Because our people are heavily armed.   This is sad however again why the push against the majority of the people!
@SenFeinstein Very sad Senator.  Very very sad.   However using this for your agenda is a rough pill to swallow.   The second is to protect us from our own Governement in the event it turns on ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù.  It was and isn‚Äôt about personal protection but our liberties given by forefathers
@SenBlumenthal Again more complaining and blame game Senator..if you even write this stuff! We want positive movement which takes you sucking up your pride just a little and working with the opposition.   How bad can it be to go down as the Senate that helped fix the corruption!   Unless??????

@SenFeinstein Ma‚Äôam read the second amendment then tell me why we have guns.   The guns are to fight back if the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù once again turns on us.   Nobody wants to see the horrendous killings, However the guns are about our freedom long term!  Sorry to hear you lost your support w/ DP

@SenBlumenthal From your own experience right?  Especially with all that combat experience!  ‚ÄúWe the people‚Äù had enough faith in you represent ‚Äúus‚Äù that you were elected.   Yet I‚Äôm wondering..    do you even read your responses?   Do you even care about your constituents.  If so which ones?
@seanhannity When the crooked ones start feeling the pressure they definitely will not protect one another.   It‚Äôs going to be interesting watching them call each other out.   They put too much faith in the past admin to protect them!!
@SenWarren Now that‚Äôs working for the people.   Congrats on posting without attacking the pres.     Aren‚Äôt we dealing with many monopolies?? Just because there are two ‚Äúproviders‚Äù.  Doesn‚Äôt make it not a shared monopoly.   Fight for us!! These are the paths we would prefer you be on
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You can‚Äôt get any more bi-Partisan than that Senator.   See he does want to fix our problems with you.    Don‚Äôt you want to go down in history as the Democratic leader that swallowed his pride and worked for US.   ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù and I‚Äôm a firm believer in the second but ......
@SenWhitehouse Get over your hate for him and fix our problems.   He seems willing and able to work with you if you would stop bashing him non stop.   This can‚Äôt be good for your career.   We want to see a love for Americans and you fighting for us not just complaining and slinging mud #MAGA

Are we as a society all so lonely that we spend hours of our day searching for connections rather good or bad on a screen.  Our politics seem to be a result of our need for attention as a whole.   We play into their games and they play into our ‚Äúneeds‚Äù.   How about a little love!

@brandongroeny @OpenThePrimary Yes however we live in a civilized society.   I would do anything to run from what they are running from as well but we have to make it so they have a path.

@punkerboy7 @BlacksForDTrump @realDonaldTrump He is a tough sucker to put up with it and people say he‚Äôs the ass.    They have even made fun of his young child for heavens sake!

@lynxlily Then again I was seated at lunch at Pinellas Park high school my freshman year and saw my principal get shot.   They used 38 caliber handguns stolen from a police officer.   I hate killing but I also have traveled around the world and what we have Is special.   Nothing like here!
@punkerboy7 @BlacksForDTrump Absolutely.   And I don‚Äôt call them that.  I thought I was a Democrat till I realized both sides were pillaging the people and seemed to be republicans did it less.  Now that @realDonaldTrump is trying to rid the corruption since Kennedy they are casting any stones they can
@MNmurlz @BlacksForDTrump I‚Äôm not thinned skin and definitely can handle it.  It just really really pisses me off.   Especially since I try to stay open minded and generally kind instead of going for the jugular.   They think we are week but they are wrong.
@realDonaldTrump They are willing to do anything to hide.   Nobody wants their corruption &amp; hatred we just want to live free with our families without govt stealing from us.  Govt was intended to be ‚ÄúUs‚Äù not a ruling idiocracy.  We the People...   keep winning big guy!!  Be safe
@Tell_Michelle_ Ignore them.   Winners.  Don‚Äôt listen to whiners.   Since when does caring about your country and fellow man make you bad.   Evil is the norm unfortunately now.   Praying for peace and civility.   We the people are tired of the malarkey.   Good luck and keep strong skin

The battle for the presidency was corrupt and now we know but from DNC.    What else is corrupt? It‚Äôs no wonder they are pissed it‚Äôs because they are scared.   Trump is not a pushover.   I may not agree with his verbiage but he is winning and a lot of People are running scared!

@dadamo6510 @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren I do not.   Only struggle is how to manage this.  I wish I had all answers.   Trying to have faith that we as people will become less aggressive and more loving eventually
@lynxlily Sure wish everyone could calmly discuss things as we do.   Bout to jump off the.    Family time since sports for the girls are done.   P&amp;L

@lynxlily @sergionick02 You may be smarter than the average bear!  I seemed to see things differently at 35 but that was after the loss of a parent also.   Anyway take care
@lynxlily I have shot one extensively (a friend owns one).   Very tough to put that many rounds through when most clips are 30 rounds which means pull trigger thirty times remove clip replace reload start over.  I am no gun lover but the constitution is what keeps us free.
@lynxlily @sergionick02 I doubt that.  They won‚Äôt write a check for enough supplies.   Armed school resource officers help but the problem is hate!   Why must we kill each other for no reason especially children.   The mind doesn‚Äôt really even see ‚Äúreality‚Äù till 35 y.o.   Peace and love

Wouldn‚Äôt we all want a chance to fight if it fell apart like some other countries have.   It‚Äôs about keeping America Free!!

@TheLifeOfEWill @pedantish @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren nothing I say will stop you from hating me for my skin.   Maybe some day you will see that hating people because of your perception is wrong.    Have a nice life I will be praying your heart softens
@TheLifeOfEWill I could care less what moves you troll
@TheLifeOfEWill @pedantish @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Keep trolling Evan.   It seems to be entertaining you.   Attack the normal guy whole lived through a similar situation.   You are getting ridiculous.    I leave a peace and love message and all you do is hate you must be a Russian
@Timmoethy @SmokenHerb Small fraction just spread love!
@benshapiro @redsteeze Turning a tragedy into race baiting.   Sad that people don‚Äôt realize we are the same inside.   I could get an organ from any race of Human.   We are not sub species people
Post on a liberal thread with something peaceful and whack labeled a racist because they I‚Äôm white and conservative.   Why the racist comments.   So sad people can‚Äôt see past their own skin no matter the color.   Peace not Hate! #mixedfamily https://t.co/ZfTteuJ8G9
I post the second amendment as the reasoning as to why guns are allowed and bam.   I‚Äôm evil.  I didn‚Äôt write it I just believe in what it says.   Guess all our founders were evil! https://t.co/x3cjPwUUaO
@BlacksForDTrump I posted something very kind on a liberal thread and whew they attacked me.   Calling me racist and everything.  Me a man with mixed kids racist.   So sick of the blindness of some citizens attacking each other instead of just starting with kindness.
@TheLifeOfEWill @pedantish @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren If for religious reasons no.  If they are screaming allah akbar.   (Prob spelled wrong).  Then it‚Äôs clearly jihad.  I wasn‚Äôt slurring anyone.   It‚Äôs a correct title for that cause feel free to research it.   stop with the race stuff.  It‚Äôs getting old.  We are the same inside!
@Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Definitely a good idea I witnessed similar but smaller.   Went to the counselors at school and talked to them.   Helped some.  Mostly my friends and I talking helped a lot
@TheLifeOfEWill @paulcarolan45 @pedantish @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren I am NOT a racist and do not imply that on me. my kids are mixed my family is a blend of black white and Asian.  I refuse to be called a racist and will not stand for it.  The thought of someone hating me or my family for our skin is repulsive !  Stop race baiting it‚Äôs wrong
@SunshineDaidrmr @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Nah they just do it with semis on closed off streets.   Hello does anyone else see that it‚Äôs happening everywhere.   People killing for what?  To cause pain when what we need is peace and love
@paulcarolan45 @TheLifeOfEWill @pedantish @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Would you kill someone?  I wouldn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm sane.   Everyone I know sane wouldn‚Äôt.   Have I seen evil yes.   Do I think a sane person kills dozens.  Not sure but doesn‚Äôt seem so to me.  Something‚Äôs off wouldn‚Äôt you think?  Not sure why so much hating over a polite post.
@GoldenAngelEyes @donlemon I post the second amendment written by our founders and I‚Äôm the problem.   Why didn‚Äôt you attack the verbiage and put a sensible argument together as opposed to a straight attack.  Background checks etc.   you just like to argue unfortunately.    Peace and love
@jillkoreyo @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Not at all.   I was just stating my opinion that normal sane people don‚Äôt kill people en mass.  My post wasn‚Äôt nasty but whew a lot of people have written some nasty stuff
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Every night for 26 years.   Pretty nice having a wonderful loving kind wife.   I am very lucky to have her.   Hope you have someone that tucks you in as well.   Loves pretty important and I am blessed to have it.   As I left the first message. Peace and love.   I forgive you! üôè
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren You all are the haters not me...see ya
@GoldenAngelEyes Nice thanks for trying so hard to make me into something I‚Äôm not hater
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren It‚Äôs actually turned fun.   You bash me non stop I answer fairly kind and you keep going as well have a good night and ponder a person trying to be kind and you just hating and being rude non stop.   #MAGA.  Feel free to get involved in your local govt!
@pedantish @TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren I think they should for sure.   Sin yes choice yes.  People have been killing forever.   I actually posted on here with kindness but got nothing of the sort back from most.   Sad when one can‚Äôt even speak without lashings..   take care
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Ha even better.   I am grateful I have a strong loving kind wife that‚Äôs not into attacking people.  It‚Äôs not sexist.  Keep going let it all out it‚Äôs ok.
@williamlegate @GoldenAngelEyes @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Be as mean as you like young man it doesn‚Äôt make your muscles grow.  I was being kind there bud.  Every man can unleash fury I just chose not to.   Best of luck snowflake
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Seems to me you just want to discriminate against whites.   I have a blended family we get along just fine.  You are the one casting stones off a kind post
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Have you read any of the Koran?
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Whew glad your not my wife.   Attacking every single shred and turning it evil.   For the record I am more libertarian.   And you can say as much nasty as you like if it makes you feel better
@dadamo6510 @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren As am I.   The problem is the constitution was written so that we can protect ourselves from our own govt should it turn corrupt.   Tough no matter what really.
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Hello what do Arabs call themselves when they are battling for their religion..   jahadi‚Äôs.   It‚Äôs not a slur but a discriptor.  classical Islamic law, the term refers to armed struggle against unbelievers
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Whatever.   Have a nice day and go back to hating.   Btw if you hate what was built here Many countries have all the qualities you like.  I will take land of freedom and opportunity.   Every country has atrocities rather with a truck running people over or a gun
@WokeRedpill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren If I knew all the answers I wouldn‚Äôt be just a normal joe blow on Twitter.   I don‚Äôt understand the mindset to kill so???   I just hope the families can heal I watched my principal get shot in 9th grade and was terrible.
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Attack.   That works better than talking then again that‚Äôs what always happens.   Btw I voted for Obama lady and I‚Äôm in the middle!   You are pretty nasty considering my speak is kind but direct
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Actually it isn‚Äôt even racial if you are talking about jihadis.   It‚Äôs about thinking killing will send you to heaven.   There is no need for dividing what has been brought together.  Drop the race card and see we are all the same
@KickAssLiberal @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Ha nice distraction .   And yes healthcare is a privilege, however every state in our country has access to welfare and healthcare for the needy.  I pay for mine and it‚Äôs expensive but it‚Äôs like ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù. For just in case
@pedantish @TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Do you know any normal sane people that want to kill?  I don‚Äôt
@GoldenAngelEyes @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren And I am not violent.  Many are though!

@beaniedabuddha @SenFeinstein Obviously Beck it was to open your eyes to the real problems.   Corruption
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Killing is killing!
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Why did it have to go racial?
@pedantish @TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren I think there is both
@MPLSCraig @TinaMorphis @SenatorDurbin Nice Argument Craig I just see it different obviously.   I have a refugee wife that waited in a camp 2 years to come here.   He offered a path and they chose no.   A wall is about stopping drugs and immigration.  Heroin is killing our nation.
@TheLifeOfEWill @williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Is a desire to kill sane?  I don‚Äôt think so.  I think somewhere along the line something has turned the minds of these killers into something we sane people don‚Äôt understand.   I have children and can‚Äôt see how I couldn‚Äôt see this path happening.  Tough one and so sad
@beaniedabuddha @SenFeinstein You mean a century to let it recess back to corrupt politicians and Corps that buy them controlling their votes.   No thanks I will wait till the corrupt ones are gone then vote in the middle like the majority of us! Rep Dem doesn‚Äôt matter.   It‚Äôs about us!
@SenFeinstein Geez Senator do you report anything except hate for Trump.   Seems you care more about the game and hating Trump then your constituents.
@NYGovCuomo A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  Gun violence is horrible but our Country is based on laws and this one is for the country as a whole.   Kind of confusing!!
@SenJeffMerkley Thanks for the positive post. üôè
@williamlegate @Savag3_CT @Churningbutter1 @TomiLahren Not all William.   I survived a school shooting in 9th grade.   Horrible  memory but I am Christian Conservative and we stand with those hurt by this.   The gun debate should realistically be about mental health.   Violence is now normal which is not ok.   Peace and Love
@TinaMorphis @MPLSCraig @SenatorDurbin I don‚Äôt recall Obama taking care of the situation and actually do in fact believe the last president to give amnesty and path to citizenship was Reagan.   Now that Trump wants to actually fix it like Reagan they are using it as a political distraction.   It‚Äôs all BS!
@SenatorDurbin Sounds great Senator but why didn‚Äôt you fix it ‚Äúyour‚Äù way when Dems were in full control.   I‚Äôm for fixing the problem by #bipartisan methods
@realDonaldTrump    This is the problem.    Lying hatred and diversion.     So sad for the children and families.  To imply it‚Äôs Republicans fault is absurd, rude, and hateful.   You have them so damn scared there blaming you for everything.    Clear the swamp https://t.co/cODMdu2x11
@realDonaldTrump    This is the problem.    Lying hatred and diversion.     So sad for the children and families.  To imply it‚Äôs Republicans fault is absurd, rude, and hateful.   You have them so damn scared there blaming you for everything.   Next an earthquake https://t.co/mpjDu0VeD8
@RepBonnie 300 comments as opposed to 11 on last I guess being absolutely political and absurd in a moment of tragedy does get more attention.  I will tell everyone I know you‚Äôre saying this.   Horrible, divisive and rude comments.    To cast blame on republicans for children‚Äôs deaths.
@RepBonnie The Constitution implicitly says we the people can have them to fight an oppressive government. If you are part of ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù how can you say you are for the constitution?   Sad yes horrible yes.   Worth risking our Democracy for who knows how many years.   Unfortunately no
@dixonshuman @lynxlily I am so sorry for the loss of life of these innocents.  The way the constitution was written is so that we have weapons to be able to form a militia to keep the govt honest. hopefully never but until killing, Rape, Murder, pillaging go away they are here for us.   So sad 4 kids
@chelseahandler That‚Äôs a lot of mud to sling from a media informed personality.   An awful lot of hearsay and misleading statements unfortunately too. He‚Äôs not the evil man you imply in my humble opinion.   Stick to entertaining it is easier to see you pretend and I enjoy your acting over ‚Äúmud‚Äù

@RealVinnieJames @TerriLynn510 Vinnie your copying me but I‚Äôm not sure I am the person your intending
@BrennaSimonSays @TakingIssue @SamanthaEm10 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends According to faith the absence of god is darkness and evil.   It speaks of god being the light.    In my opinion the energy is god and we are all part of it.   As far as the bad things that happen?  I wish I could figure that out.   But maybe death is not the end.  Reset? Heaven?
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends You too.   If you get a chance check out the power plant theory as well
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Cool thanks Brenna I imagine we could talk it out for hours.   Never know my brother lives in Atlanta.   Take care
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Thanks for posting that.  I will research it with a smile.   Love the stuff
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Not on the pyramids I have been studying them for many years.  Paper thin joints.   Perfect angles.   Tooling marks.   No writings found inside etc.   I kinda like the power plant theory.   Now for work Brenna enjoyed the debating.   You are a true professional and I appreciate!
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends I understand but there is so much we can‚Äôt explain.    An advanced civilization Over 10000 years ago for one.   We currently couldn‚Äôt build the great pyramid of Giza or even begin to lift the largest obelisk with our most powerful cranes.   I‚Äôm sure we lost most of our knowledge.
@BrennaSimonSays @TakingIssue @SamanthaEm10 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Obviously that wasn‚Äôt aimed at me???
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Yep that‚Äôs the battle I have.   Spent many years as an agnostic.   Jesus message of love is an easier journey to try and live on for me personally
@TakingIssue @BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Cindy I‚Äôm a believer like you but unfortunately they aren‚Äôt all that old on a big scale.  The clay tablets (Sumerian)on the other hand which are much older tell a similar yet very different story.   Just hoping Jesus‚Äô message is right.   We need more love and less hatred.
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends I understand your view more than you know.  I have struggled with it my whole life.   Problem is I‚Äôm getting older.  (Not that old lol) I am realizing that my hear is yearning for much more
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends If we die and there is no god nothing is lost.   If we die and there is an all loving god we ignored would that all loving god cast us into a lake of fire???   That‚Äôs my only issue.   Jesus‚Äô message is really the only one that says hey you are all sinners just say sorry and try!
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends That is the tough part.   Maybe we get more than one shot.  John the Baptist was asked if he was Elijah returned.  If it wasn‚Äôt plausible would they have said it.   I just can‚Äôt see eternity based off 14-120 years
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends I‚Äôm not invested in an ideology actually But do desire for God to be the all loving creator we hope he is.  I agree with Buddhism‚Äôs path as well as Jesus‚Äô they both blend very well.   If I could only get meditating down enough for 5 minutes thought free.  Have a great day
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends I have family and love as well but a longing for understanding that keeps me so pensive it at times makes the mundane a struggle.
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends I was speaking of civilization as a whole.   With or without purpose.  Not an attack FYI.   Just peaceful debating üëç
@TakingIssue @BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TomiLahren @foxandfriends How about you explain your own thoughts not Neil.   And I really am intrigued by his  and yours.   However they are mostly hypothesis
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Thermodynamics cant explain creation that‚Äôs for sure and 280 characters is a tough one.  Not that I can explain God because obviously no one can.  But without faith in something good and loving watching over us where are we??  Lonely Ants.  Jesus spreaded love and it has meaning
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Brenna so you believe we just popped out of nothing?   Curious
@BrennaSimonSays @SamanthaEm10 @TakingIssue @TomiLahren @foxandfriends He is a great scientist but what we think we see and know is blinded.

I pray god speaks to us I have lots of questions https://t.co/H2fr6lekRr
@B8_Bomber @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Rahsaan that‚Äôs a stretch.   I hope our creator can soften your heart.  Most Christians want to spread love and peace.  Love, peace, and forgiveness are humans best qualities.
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Because according to the Bible they are in the wrong.   ‚ÄúLet everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Romans 13:1.    Prob hard to accept for Behar
@Tell_Michelle_ Sleep is important for your fight ahead ‚Äúfuture Congress woman‚Äù.  I imagine it‚Äôs hard to shut the mind off but the attacks coming from the left are going to be very hard.  I hope you can get some peaceful sleep so the stress doesn‚Äôt get too hard!
@Tell_Michelle_ Romans 13:1 should ease our Christian Dems that are struggling with how he has been painted.   Verse = Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
@Tell_Michelle_ Unfortunately much of our media enjoys humiliating our Pres/Vice-Pres.  Their actions are separating our society more than actual Trump actions.   Most is out of context when reported or spoken of.   I pray for their families as this is so sad and completely disrespectful!  #MAGA

@OnlyHearSeeHate @VJBEADS1 @SenSanders Yes that‚Äôs a major part of the problem.  Predatory lending to someone who‚Äôs desperate and it‚Äôs a tough trap to get out of!   I have witnessed someone do it and it‚Äôs a bad situation.   Then again how can someone get a loan if they don‚Äôt pay their bills.   All around rough
@VJBEADS1 @OnlyHearSeeHate @SenSanders But are they in debt?   Debt is the maker of poverty.   It makes us slaves
@OnlyHearSeeHate @SenSanders I earn my keep and give in every way I can I just do not believe it should be a retirement program
@OnlyHearSeeHate @SenSanders Oh and the fishing trip was free. I live in Florida and went on a friends boat.   You assume too much.   I‚Äôm a success story of the system, Because the system is a trap and I saw it and was. blessed to be willing and able to work.   Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt wake up every day in pain!
@OnlyHearSeeHate @SenSanders There is nothing wrong with getting help, however lifelong recipients of assistance (able bodied) should be educated with a skill.  I personally just paid for someone‚Äôs insurance license etc so he could work and get out of the mess.   Education is the answer not handouts forever
@realDonaldTrump @JohnKasich @WestervillePD They can‚Äôt even be nice to you when you are being kind and talking to a governor that badmouthed you.   I thought it was great you put politics aside and offered your condolences.   Very sad people can attack in these situations
@ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Mr Patel.   Sounds like you are a very bitter man.  Shouldn‚Äôt you be hoping for good things as opposed to complaining.   There‚Äôs always Delhi if you hate it here
@OnlyHearSeeHate @SenSanders Nice diversion. I personally grew up with a single mom with 5 children.   We got welfare, foodstamps etc.   however when I became a man I chose to save money and have children after I saved enough At $9.50 an hour.  A fishing trip is by no means a sign of wealth moron.  üõë hiding
@NYGovCuomo Education classes and drug testing should be a requirement for able body people getting assistance.

@lynxlily Lord autocorrect pisses me off sometimes.  I think you got what I meant though.   Have a great day.   Time to make some money to pay for that college for my oldest.
@lynxlily Oopsie read your profile wrong.   Wife not mother.   You are definitely going to want some kids though.   Nothing like it.   Mine at 15 and 19 now.   Best thing ever.   I would go back to my 20‚Äôs and Jane them sleeping on my chest again in a minute.
@lynxlily Nah just a very young mother.  Enjoy your 20‚Äôs they scream by
@PattyMurray For the wealthiest Americans.    Everybody I know from minimum wage up is getting more in their checks and will still get refunds.   So misleading Senator.   Remember when you did this job without casting stones non stop.   That‚Äôs what we want again.
@Maryland4Trump2 @Pepe1roni Looks like weed in the background.   Lol
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump And of corse you never ever reply when it‚Äôs really a bipartisan comment.  You still have time to stop attacking and start working.   Are you afraid of actually being a part of something great.   You have the chance to be on top of you would just want to win honestly!
@Sinestra_Bar @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYPDnews @FDNY @SecretService @NewYorkFBI Nice.   You were implying I was poorly educated which I find humorous.   Straight to the jabs.   Let‚Äôs see you hide your face, name etc.   probably a Russian anyway. https://t.co/JZz9tgG0gg
@RepJoeKennedy @POTUS Congressman.    States were intended to fund themselves remember.   The feds are supposed to oversee the states to keep them honest.   Does anyone in Washington remember what was intended.   We broke away from England because of the bureaucracy and taxation remember. #MAGA
@DallasIrey @RonaldLorenzen1 Oopsy plot thickens the so called good guys are turning out to be wife beaters.   Any man who hits a woman is a coward.   An unpatriotic coward.   Fitting it seems
@Sinestra_Bar @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYPDnews @FDNY @SecretService @NewYorkFBI Nice smack I haven‚Äôt had a jab back like that since elementary school.   Completely false, however comical.   Come up with something true and I will jump on board with you.   Until then enjoy the hatred.   I hear it‚Äôs good for your soul!! https://t.co/YOY7rBne9R
@Sinestra_Bar @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYPDnews @FDNY @SecretService @NewYorkFBI Proud American you Rusky!   Definitely 7 more just watch!!   Enjoy you hating and have a great day #MAGA
@SenBillNelson Thank you Senator.   That‚Äôs what I have been asking for from you on here.   Just a little flexibility even if you hate Trump do it for us!   You can #MAGA too Senator and we believe in you

@Sinestra_Bar @DonaldJTrumpJr @NYPDnews @FDNY @SecretService @NewYorkFBI Pretty brutal Simon.   The woman is an innocent bystander and you seem to think it‚Äôs ok to bully the father through the family!    Brighten up buttercup he only has 7 years left.
@SenFeinstein Then why didn‚Äôt you fix it when you had a majority? I would appreciate a little #bipartisan effort ma‚Äôam.   If you all would stop throw fits and start working with the President (like him or not) you just might be able to go down as the Senate that restored the people‚Äôs trust. https://t.co/J6gyEPv9E6
@SenSchumer Misleading Senator #bipartisan please.   You still have time to start winning again.
@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter It would be language, however.   Btw   No one educated uses the word but these days as you have.
@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter Haha.  Whatever you must be the bot.      Is it still stinging about the teaching our youth part.   I bet it‚Äôs just eating you up inside that you can‚Äôt piss me off.
@lindsay_alec @ChrisVanHollen Absolutely not.   If it changes the majority of the country loses.   We are independent states united.   States are states for a reason.

@doctorcherokee @lindsay_alec @ChrisVanHollen Easy doc he‚Äôs just a young man.   It takes a while to see big picture as opposed to what the media is brainwashed them with.   I have a youngster in College and whew they are feeding them some weird reasoning lately.  #MAGA

@lindsay_alec @ChrisVanHollen Ok so it‚Äôs ok but I will give you a quick lesson.   We the people are based on an electoral college sytem.  Why?   So the cities do not control.  He won because we as a whole country wanted him.   Try to be positive and want positive and he just might deliver.   None before have!
@DonaldJTrumpJr @NYPDnews @FDNY @SecretService @NewYorkFBI Sorry about your wife heard of The absolutely disgusting thing someone did.   Praying for all of your safety #MAGA
@ChrisVanHollen Guess you should have read it before it passed and should have debated it as opposed to just slinging dirt at the President.  Work for us not against us.  And us consists of the President.   We the People chose him and you so work it out. You all are being ridiculous #bipartisan
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump This malarkey won‚Äôt work with us Blue color workers anymore Senator.   We know your not on our side anymore.   #bipartisan would be a good start
@SenSanders Guess you should have stop complaining about him and should have worked with him for the right outcome.   How will he work with you when all you do is berate him.  #bipartisan
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Senator come on now!!  #bipartisan would be a good place for you to start if you want something.    How can you win a deal when you are always attacking our leader
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Because it outdated and everyone in the past failed to bring it up to the standards known all around the world.   One step at a time Senator.   Stop attacking and work #Bipartisan
@BillOReilly @realDonaldTrump I know very few that are unhappy with him and my friends are on both sides.   Professional attacks when needed as opposed to wrath makes it easier to swallow.  He is #MAGA
@PattyMurray Thank you!   That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.   Fixing our problems
@realDonaldTrump High speed rails are needed!!!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends My family is from Ohio and it‚Äôs killing every day.   I‚Äôve had a sister on Heroin for 11 year (sober now).  A nephew currently doing it and many others.   We have to stop the influx of heroin.   It can be bought easier than soda in the Midwest on the whole!  Build the wall!!
@StephenMilIer Nah he tortured them the old fashioned way.   I‚Äôm losing faith in my fellow Americans.   Where is your moral compass.   Do you remember them killing this innocent young man? https://t.co/b4EgImsZOJ
@HarmlessYardDog @AnnCoulter Both wrong.   Racism is from all sides.   Having bi-racial children I know first hand WE ARE NO Different other than cultures..    stop hating start loving.   Skin is skin we are all brothers and sisters from earth
@phl43 @AnnCoulter You sound a little lost and confused.   Earth definitely won‚Äôt be warming after NK kills half the planet.   Illogical argument.   They are making nuclear bombs to destroy the earth.  As are most countries.  We are all fed lies
@LauraLoomer @RonaldLorenzen1 If our media would stop picking sides and report honest truth it could be fixed.    News is not supposed to be the entertainment of the evening
@mitchellvii Not always true however it does seem awfully strange and hard to believe
@FoxNews @RyanGaydos Protesting a free country,  A country that allows gay marriage.   A country that helps more starving people than any other.   A country founded on faith.  A country where you won‚Äôt be strangled shot or beheaded for religious reasons.  We are the land of opportunity and freedom
@TyBainesCadbury @BarryStantonGB Looks to me Barry the boy just wants to stir the pot.   One day he will need a little purpose once his hormones subside.   Lots of anger I figure we just hope love fills his heart and change will come
@TyBainesCadbury No checkmate Tyler your argument doesn‚Äôt begin to make sense.   According to Islam Jesus was a prophet.   According to Christianity he is the messiah.    Jesus spoke the words that he was the son of God.  He was the messiah.  Islam denies that.  Jesus cannot be a liar and messiah
@TyBainesCadbury @PrisonPlanet That‚Äôs a stretch considering Mohamed lived 600 years after Christ.   How could Jesus teach us about a religion that didn‚Äôt exist yet.    The two religions have the same beginnings (Judaism) however are vastly different
@JulianAssange @realDonaldTrump isn‚Äôt it time to work this out?   We appreciate your service and desire truth as promised.  #MAGA
@tedlieu Stop the BS and just do your job.   We are so sick of the partisan behavior.   Mud slinging for what benefit?
@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter Your shift haha.  That‚Äôs so ridiculous man!  Do you have a goal in mind?   What are you looking for on twitter if not an honest debate?  Just a hobby of ?
@lynxlily I‚Äôm for castrations of truly guilty men ü§™though.  Women are the glue of life.    Family, love, romance, strength and even ‚ÄúManhood‚Äù.    In my humble opinion of corse
@lynxlily @AnaCabrera @tedlieu You‚Äôre young too..   We need more people involved.
@lynxlily @AnaCabrera @tedlieu I agree with you on his attacks.   Only problem is he turns out to be correct a lot.  He seems to be trying hard to be the man we want.   Optimistic I guess
A lot of hatred and vial comments are made via twitter.   It wouldn‚Äôt be horrible to be kind and have normal conversations rather than always attacking.   I can‚Äôt say by any stretch I‚Äôm perfect because I‚Äôm not but it sure would be nice to keep it cordial from both sides.
@lynxlily @AnaCabrera @tedlieu Always good to debate with you.   üôè
@lynxlily @AnaCabrera @tedlieu Is he really trying to do that or is it being spun like that.   I‚Äôm just not sold he‚Äôs the a‚Äî hole they make him out to be.
@lynxlily @AnaCabrera @tedlieu I agree with you that it‚Äôs horrible that any woman be subject to any of this.   My only point is what if he‚Äôs innocent.   We seem to not give them a chance even if innocent.
@BreitbartNews Very strange!!   Why I wonder?
@AnaCabrera @lynxlily @tedlieu However if they are made up for political reasons it might be relevant to wait and see how it ends before throwing a person into turmoil.   What if.   Just what if he is innocent.  Then think if you were in his shoes trying to be a public servant
@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter Ha I‚Äôm not a troll.  I have been called that several times but it doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù.  As you can see I don‚Äôt hide who I am.   Nice try though.   I guess the comment about you teaching our children pissed you off.   üéØ bullseye ..   take care now üòâ
@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter The thought of a man like yourself with so much anger leading our children even in Math makes me nauseous.

@scott_sylvia @SenBlumenthal Ha.   Funny though
@SenBlumenthal Are you going to do anything besides attack Trump?   It‚Äôs probably not so good for your career if he were to take aim at you considering your poor record of honesty with us!  No-Patisan is the answer Senator.
@lynxlily I have a child that sounds just like you.   She tells me her favorite smell is that of the books at the library.   Education is freedom!

@bbbob61 @AnnCoulter What evidence and proof shall you provide?  All the info we had been given in the past was to bring dissent against Trump.   They cheated and still lost hence their anger.   I‚Äôm looking forward to it all coming clean and America getting over it..  #MAGA and not corrupt

Isn‚Äôt the point not to see each other as colors.   It‚Äôs a class issue ma‚Äôam not race. Class can be taught.

@paulrflynn @MichaelBRivard1 @realDonaldTrump Not if he can get the rest in order going forward.   He was handed this mess and it‚Äôs not getting fixed in a year.

@sbtorp @realDonaldTrump Nice thing to say to your president that  We the People elected.   Have you thought about the majority who want him in office.   Maybe saying what you want as opposed to being rude would help.   You have his ear on here.   What other President has given us that opportunity.
@ErinGoKirk @realDonaldTrump It was substantially lower a year ago.   Way above the previous admin.   Maybe you could look at the #‚Äôs and see that you yielded much more even with the losses than previously.   You could always go to bonds!   Reality is pres only controls policy and he‚Äôs been on point.
@TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump Disgusting lies
@TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump Good lord he was bragging on his daughter saying she is the most beautiful woman in his opinion.   Shouldn‚Äôt we all make our daughters feel beautiful empowered and strong.   So out of context
@FiredupBethy @realDonaldTrump I doubt that.   According to Jesus our leaders are in place for a reason.   Isn‚Äôt all of this lessons for our soul.  Aren‚Äôt we supposed to love one another and forgive.   Hopefully all of this works out and our people can unite for a true purpose.   Loving one another
@Clintmj @2RealandTruth @Exasper8ed @TomWellborn @realDonaldTrump Almost impossible to reason with the hate.    Your responses are biblical. Romans 13:1.

@PressSec When someone thinks they hate a person they refuse to listen.   They have bashed OUR choice to the point we no longer trust them.   To think I used to be a Democrat.    I grew up poor but had the blessing of being born in the land of opportunity.  #MAGA
@RepJoeKennedy So misleading.   You are a Kennedy!!!   The people expect more of you than the others!    Trump wants to help fix the issues and corruption that sadly you lost families from in the past.   I imagine you joining a bi-Partisan effort with him would be much better for your career
@RepMattGaetz Nice chest pump!   Now help get rid of the nonsense in Washington and run this Country cheaper.
@SenBennetCO @POTUS You are implying OUR president that WE chose didn‚Äôt win by our choice.    Senator that is against the will of the people.   No one believes your lies.   And I for one don‚Äôt want to go back to the Cold War days of hiding under a desk during bombing raid drills at school!  All lies
@ciceros_head @SenBennetCO @POTUS So misleading!   Yeah he‚Äôs a Russian agent from New York that chose to stay here with billions.    You people make no sense!!   Has our education system taught this nonsense.   Does anyone remember American Pride?   He‚Äôs a true Patriot not a bought one
@SenBennetCO @POTUS Shouldn‚Äôt you be working on the budget, DACA, drug epidemic,  poverty issues, education issues etc.    Why doesn‚Äôt anyone mention the lack of a quality education in the inner city.    Why aren‚Äôt we talking about why our population is not fulfilled and a lack of purpose at times.
And people say he‚Äôs a Godless Racist.   Looks to me like he wants to lead our Country with some dignity of the attacks would stop https://t.co/ekzKBpuBux
@SenJeffMerkley @VigorIndustrial On point again Senator.   I like the positive posts as opposed to the other.   The people will follow you sir if you lead them.  Loyalty, Honesty, Open minded, Strong and Loving that‚Äôs what‚Äôs we need.    And of corse not corrupt.
@Education4Libs That‚Äôs too bad I really liked Macy‚Äôs.
@JeffFlake Then talk to your fellow members and fix it!   Step up and do more than tweet.   You got the looks and tongue now for the action!  #MAGA
@SenSchumer Good to see you are getting back on board Senator.   Pass a realistic budget and fix the mess!    Distractions Like Senator Pelosi on the floor speak although impressive isn‚Äôt what the country needs.   We need fiscal responsibility.   Work for the people please sir!
@SenJeffMerkley Again.   Time off I believe is fair to the employing company.  (Think of all the small companies trying grow).   However paid is a stretch and makes it tougher to be a SMB..     This is a nail in the coffin to small Businesses
@SenGillibrand Then get to work and fix it.   Your compadres are the problem ma‚Äôam
@ChrisVanHollen Business comes and go.   Sears used to be the Amazon of the day.   They had the chance to change and didn‚Äôt.   You are so misleading with your tweets.    Corrupt politician.   Most people have no idea who you are anyway.   Count your blessings it‚Äôs temporary

@ChrisVanHollen Whew people are clamoring to post on your nonsense.    Do people believe your bullshit or are they just ignorant.   He said I don‚Äôt want a shutdown but..   Democrats...   meaning you are the problem.   You are losing my bad sir.   Still time to focus on us and not yourself
@AynRandPaulRyan That‚Äôs a stretch Holly.    You need some purpose in life girl.    Hating is bad for your soul and mind
@special_241 @SenDuckworth Ha now that‚Äôs a stretch.    I was a Missionary for 10 years.   Grew up poor.   Lived with a foster for a time.   Was abused.    Chose to work hard and save.. it‚Äôs not a hi horse.   It‚Äôs called planning.    My family would roast that comment considering all I do is help others.
@SenSanders Do you joke too Bernie.   Funny we thought you were a good man.   Problem is your just another corrupt politician.   Were you ever really fighting for the people??   You were bought but there is still time to go back to yourself.   Lose the baggage the DNC isn‚Äôt helping
@special_241 @SenDuckworth As I tell my children.   Paycheck to paycheck is a choice.   If you save a little no matter what you Will get out.   From experience.   If they are bedridden and can‚Äôt work we have public assistance for that.   Lastly it‚Äôs not communal.   We are not responsible for everyone.
@clairecmc Hopefully he will work hard and be Bi-Partisan.    Remember it‚Äôs not about each of you it‚Äôs about the people.
@special_241 @SenDuckworth All excuses in my opinion.    Bad things to happen to good people.   I started out one of 5 children on Welfare with a single mom the Majority of the time.   Guess my single mom taught me a way out.   hard work and saving.   Best of luck.   Keep on complaining it‚Äôs not doing much
@JeffFlake Not so sure you jumping on the other bandwagon is good for your career!   A joke is a joke ease up a bit and get to work figuring out the budget, DACA etc.    We work so you can!
@SenJeffMerkley Yeah and the previous administration was really amazing at fixing the debt.   More deceit.     Stop the attacks and start working to fix it

@special_241 @SenDuckworth I am a father that took the time.   6 weeks in fact so my wife could recover without a struggle and we could enjoy our child.    I made roughly $12 an hour.   Saved for the time off when we chose to have a child and the time off was FMLA at my expense.   Think!!
@special_241 @SenDuckworth Maybe the fight you think that would make it better isn‚Äôt.    Socialism doesn‚Äôt work on the whole.   We have adopted bits and pieces of a socialistic type society.   However forcing people to pay people to have children is a bit much.   I agree with the time just not $$$
@special_241 @SenDuckworth Maybe you would be better suited to move to one of those more advanced countries.
@leezeldin @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù do sir and we are counting on you to help fix the corruption!   No-one should be above the law.    Our Constitution and Nation are at stake!!!
@SenDuckworth Time off is one thing but forcing a small company to pay for weeks on end is a bit of a stretch Senator!    I took off 6 weeks unpaid but had enough sense to save beforehand!    Learning to save is much more valuable than a few weeks killing a small companies $$
@PattyMurray As do Floridians and Trump loves Florida.
@TomiLahren Because to them it‚Äôs about power.   We are merely sheep to them.  Obviously we are expendable for their own pleasure.   Why else would they not even stand when Trump spoke of our successes as people.....   Because we are merely a vote to them and nothing else.
@seanhannity So sad for this father to have to deal with this pain
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump What about the fact that all Republicans voted to release your Democratic memo yet not one of your fellow Democrats voted to release the first one??      Now who is Bi-Partisan Senator?   You still have time to become Bi-Partisan.

@SenJeffMerkley @CFPB About face.   Are you really talking about corruption considering your parties company..    now that‚Äôs humorous
@SenWarren @USDOL @realDonaldTrump Misleading Senator.   Do you really think that this is good for anyone.   We all should pay taxes.   Our own equal fair share
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Treason no.   Disrespectful to us who work and are the ones he was describing...   Absolutely.   He may go a little far with the verbiage but what he is saying makes sense.   If they truly loved America they would be happy of the successes of ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Do you have a Bi-Partisan bone in your body Senator?   We still believe you can and will change to work for your Constituents!!!   Work together for heavens sake
@SenJeffMerkley @CFPB Still attacking!   Where are your positive posts about what you are actually doing for your constituents?
@JeffFlake Also it‚Äôs starting to be hard to even believe that you all are actually working for the people.  It seems our ‚ÄúRepresentatives‚Äù are either corrupt or too weak to stand up for us!

@SenJeffMerkley We definitely shouldn‚Äôt put someone in the position that knows the business inside and out.    That would be absurd..  GEEZ...Some Executives are good people sir.    Seems to be you vote for anything against the current administration
@ragsfan @1969rpmalerba @tedmcdonald @josbannon @realDonaldTrump This same argument was blasted at Obama‚Äôs as well!   It‚Äôs his place his course and if crazy people weren‚Äôt out to get him he would fly his own plane free of Charge.   Get over your nonsense #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump Please be careful sir.   Many crazies out there really hate you.   Must be the programming from the #FakeNews!   #MAGA
@MagpieIma @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I happen to be one of the working Americans and I feel the following.   I feel like normal everyday American citizens like myself got not only a tax cut but a president that cares for us.
@PattyMurray Keep spewing your lies ma‚Äôam.   Not many believe anything you all say anymore
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Senator.    If it weren‚Äôt for gentlemen like yourself that constantly attack our President, our Country would be much better off.    If you as well as most of the mainstream media would stop the nonsense.   America could start to heal from its corruption.
@seanhannity The NFL...  oh yeah Football.    I stopped paying attention to them after seeing the Steelers, all except one man avoided the anthem then turned on him.  I find it Disrespectful to the country that has enabled them to have a life millions dream of! MAGA
@NYGovCuomo Shouldn‚Äôt the states handle there own business??     Isnt that the point of having States with power over themselves.    The federal government should be about protecting us and the States need to govern themselves
@SenWarren Anything to oppose our President.   Quit playing games and really go to work
@SallyDeal4 @realDonaldTrump Stop trolling Sally!   Irritating
@JeffFlake We don‚Äôt want a trans pacific partnership.   Jeff wake up sir.   You sound like a Democrat not a Republican.    Keep it up and you won‚Äôt have any supporters.   You still have time
@JeffFlake @clairecmc @SenToomey @SenJohnMcCain @SenMikeLee @senrobportman @SenRonJohnson @marcorubio @SenJoniErnst @SenatorFischer Now we are talking!   Good turn around !   Now support our President and work for the people as hired
@nikkihaley Thanks for fighting for our citizens!
@SenSchumer #SchumerShutdwon actually.   Everyone know
@NYGovCuomo You govern a State let‚Äôs keep it that way.    What about American born Dreamers???

@SenSchumer You Filibuster then Blame Trump.   Now that‚Äôs just as #crooked as it gets
@The_Trump_Train Very!
@SenBillNelson Now your bi-partisan.    Since when??
@JeffFlake Snowflake from snowflake.   Now that‚Äôs funny
@SenSchumer So crooked Chuck.   Tell the truth.   You and others holding the country and it‚Äôs people hostage.   Open your eyes and listen to your constituents!   #pawn

@SenDuckworth Lieutenant Colonel how can you bash the commander in chief knowing he cares about or troops and people.   I am honestly saddened that a veteran like yourself would use her platform to bash our president elected by the people! R or D.   Patriotism first

@clairecmc Now why are you calling it a Trump shutdown.   Quit lying to the people.   Reality is that it‚Äôs a shutdown because of #crooked politicians.
@SenSchumer Come on Chuck.   Sitting Wealthy at the top acting like you care about the little guy.    In my humble opinion you are a traitor.   What are you doing for the people besides standing in the way of restoring America.   You are simply a DNC mouthpiece.   #Crooked
@BernieSanders Why the division.   What possibly could come out of trying to divide the people.   Puppet
@StephenAtHome Weak
@StephenAtHome Is this working for you?   You are obviously not a very pensive man!
@realDonaldTrump MAGA..    thank you sir
@JasonKander He has to start somewhere to fix our financial issues.   Our last two presidents did a great job of being corrupt!
@SenJeffMerkley You are part of the problem. Does it feel guilty being owned and turning on your constituents????    How did your initial intent of working for the people get twisted??  Special interests probably
@LindseyGrahamSC Then get to work with your own party and fix it.   You have an excellent leader if you could shake a little of your own pride.
@PressSec Sarah Sanders for President 2024!
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS Mr. Huckabee thanks for being a good man!   Your daughter is the most impressive press secretary ever btw.    I want her as our first female President!
@PressSec They are traitors in my opinion.    They need replaced.   Even some of the Repubs
@SenBobCasey You are part of the problem but the answer.   Does it feel guilty being owned and turning on your constituents????
@realDonaldTrump The crooked politicians want you to fail. That‚Äôs why they refuse to join you.  They know your success is their failure and they are bought.   Speak to the people like you would speak to your children!   Kind, Loving, with concern for their future!  Strong but loving!   We believe
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You are a divider!   What happen d to you caring about us!
@NYGovCuomo you are part of the problem
@JeffFlake Stop politicking and start caring again you would see what the people want.   You have no idea of the reality of your constituents but only of your donors that own You!  Join our President and fix the mess!   The most powerful nation of all time in debt is ridiculous!
@clairecmc Seems more are corrupt than anyone thought!     Pawns
@SenWarren The Country, as in ‚Äúprivate industry‚Äù is doing very well.   In fact better than anyone expected.   Maybe if you stop politicking and start caring again you would see what the people want.   You have no idea of the reality of your constituents but only of your donors that own You!
@StephenAtHome If you would stop bashing and looking for the good you may just change your mind.   Or is it just you spewing reruns of others thoughts to feel good about what you perceive in yourself.  You are the hypocrite
@joshdcaplan He deserved to be removed.    Questioning and badgering are two different things
@StephenAtHome Remember you are a comedian!   We understand your negative banter makes you rich but at what point will you start to feel like a traitor to the country that made you rich!
@realDonaldTrump None of this banter would be necessary if the media and a majority or our ‚ÄúRepresentatives‚Äù were not owned by others through bribes and perks.
@NYGovCuomo This doesn‚Äôt make sense unfortunately sir.    I have a wife that was once a refugee and her family worked to be legal and earn the rights as a citizens.   Freedom is not free!
@StephenAtHome Find a new topic or you will be down to a few super liberal followers soon.    To think I used to think you were funny
@JeffFlake Seems to me you are the traitor.    Our president was elected based on the people‚Äôs choice not what you and other politicians think we want.    Get in line with Our president and MAGA.   Or as the locals say.   He already has made America great again.   Now to make it fair
@Acosta No one cares Acosta.    You should be asking questions about fixing things for the people not stupid nonsense.   Seems you really could care less about The UNITED States of America.    Have you forgotten ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù.  All you do is divide
@realDonaldTrump Thank you sir!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Is anyone listening to your babbling.     Work for your constituents and stop playing political games.
@HillaryClinton You lost ma‚Äôam.   That‚Äôs what happened now ride off in the sunset and enjoy Bill and the family.
@BernieSanders Mr. Sanders you have already played your hand and we know you were bought by the DNC and Clintons.   Work for your constituents and stop bashing the people‚Äôs choice.
@StephenAtHome Find a new topic we are sick of your political bashing
@ThePresObama @realDonaldTrump You already had your presidency!   Let the will of the people happen.  Why are you even talking about your old job!   We liked you ‚ÄúI thought‚Äù and we appreciated you now it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs time on the stick!
@realDonaldTrump Who honestly cares about Bannon?   Keep your pace sir and keep winning!   The globalists are losing!    MAGA!
@PattyMurray Listen to your people not the lobbyist!

@DWhitINger @reardonmomma @AriFleischer Such a professional response.   When someone speaks their opinions you can‚Äôt communicate only judge.   Nothing like using a gif of a Vanderbilt btw.  If you even knew he was one of them!
@realDonaldTrump Why are we paying other countries anyway.    We are not the welfare system for the world.   Doesn‚Äôt make sense.  Egypt alone almost 76 billion dollars since 1948.    What could that have done for our people?   Our growth?   Our dept problems?
@reardonmomma @DWhitINger @AriFleischer You need to pay attention.   Your being mind controlled.   So ridiculous
@diane32123 @SenGillibrand It‚Äôs not about Blue or Red.   It‚Äôs about the people in your districts.   What makes you believe ‚Äúour‚Äù country wants to be blue.
