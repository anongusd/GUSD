@swainscheps @BostonGlobe I hear you. But environmentalists, nuclear industry, local officials all agree that it would be better for the spent nuclear fuel to be consolidated in one or two places rather than spread at scores of sites all over the country, including ones that exist only to safeguard it.

For this story, I spent a lot of time learning about the history of Massachusetts' long-defunct nuclear power station in woods of Rowe, Mass., near the VT border. What follows are some amazing photos of its decommissioning I found in the Globe archives. https://t.co/nFymFtrsyK https://t.co/1ERqiqO8sx
@mysteriousrook Thanks, Ed.
@tryghin @BostonGlobe Better to know, right?
6/6 Another twist: The waste means the land from old nuke plants can't be reused. More here: https://t.co/nFymFtrsyK
The utilities sued the gov't for breach of contract and won (and keep winning) damages for the costs of safeguarding the waste. So far, the cost to taxpayers has exceeded $7 BILLION. And it's poised to grow by tens of billions more. 5/6
The federal government had promised to start hauling away the radioactive waste by 1998, but NIMBY politics got in the way. So the waste remained in Rowe ‚Äî and at the scores of other US civilian nuclear plants, both active and decommissioned. 4/6
The spent nuclear fuel had been sitting in this deep pool. It was eventually entombed in these concrete casks. 3/6 https://t.co/qHLovMNRFl
In Western Mass. near the Vermont border, workers took the plant apart piece by piece. 2/6 https://t.co/I0WensVvbz
THREAD: More than 27 years ago, the Yankee Atomic Elec. Co's turned off its nuclear power plant in Rowe, Mass. The company decided to shutter the facility a few months later. 1/6 https://t.co/R1fXZZEkIM

With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Patrick had 48.8 percent of the vote to Baker's 41.7 percent. In his victory party at the Park Plaza in Boston, Patrick took the stage to cries of "Four more years!" 6/6
A closely watched ballot question to slash the state sales tax rate was defeated, as was a measure to repeal the state's affordable housing law. But a ballot question to erase the sales tax on alcohol won. 5/6
The state GOP, with its hopes raised of becoming a bigger force, failed to win a single one of the 10 congressional seats or any statewide offices, including open seats for state treasurer and state auditor. 4/6
His triumph was the cornerstone of a Democratic rout that set the state apart from the rest of the nation, which saw major Republican gains. 3/6
Patrick overcame a devastating recession and a high unemployment rate to convince voters that he was best equipped to lead the state toward economic recovery. 2/6

Bunker has big blast door. Was "designed to house and protect 300 key state government officials, including the governor, during a disaster. It was capable of being self-sufficient for 30 days." Bunker has own HVAC, generators, two H20 wells, bunks, and a morgue. üò∑
Spot was chosen 2 be far enough away frm Boston to be safe in event of nuke attack on state capital, but close enough to get to in a hurry. Bunker is 30-40 feet below ground, built of reinforced concrete, and can withstand a 20-megaton bomb exploding 3 miles away (allegedly)üöÄ üí£
