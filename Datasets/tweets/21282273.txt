You know you're swamped with homework when your idea of a break is lying and reading assigned texts.
@caro__ Goodnight moon is quite possibly the best book ever.
@thatmartha It's work time.
@klgriffin88 I feel stalked. Yesss.
@klgriffin88 Hahaha. Sneaky.
deep in GRE prep.
@dnmahr You can do it!
@thatmartha Oh, I did.
@smanderson Yes. Isn't it great?  Books rock when you suddenly have time on your hands.
Is greatly disturbed by Glenn Beck's commentary on "social justice" churches... has he read the new testament? #beck #disturbing #Jesus
@robynserum Oh, I am always aware that you are clever.  Good thing your boyfriend is even more clever and can keep up with you.
@chris_a_scott When's the show?  Definitely sounds like it has potential.
@robynserum You are so clever.
Happy 19th @robynserum

@caro__ a hot mug of Celestial wellness tea sweetened with honey.  A spritz of lemon couldn't hurt, either.
@robynserum I'll let you read it after I do, but Im not sure it will be completely worth your time.  Maybe you can just read my paper on it.
