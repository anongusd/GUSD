I appreciate the Moapa Valley Progress for informing the voters about the USPS failure to deliver my literature 	https://t.co/kN01Di2Xqs
There are videos that show the post office employees  refusing to deliver my political material. After i was not given satisfactory answers David Rupert from the USPS informed me that it is illegal to film on government property. (Is that a threat?)

@TitanblueDem @SusieLeeInfo @SusieLeeNV Just goes to show you the ignorance of some people on twitter. People have the right to know what i stand for even if they dont agree with what im saying.
Imagine mailing over 3500 properly addressed letters from Wegner for Congress and having them returned due to post office incompetence or ? These families had the right to know what i stand for. https://t.co/I7PaLm9JUV
@SusieLeeInfo @SusieLeeNV Maybe we should ban illegal aliens they kill way more people than guns
@Senatorspearman @NRA Domestic violence once found guilty will prohibit you from owning a gun anyways. Federal law already prohibits that

Finally, a @POTUS that understands we have been in a trade war for over 40 years, just look at the rust belt. https://t.co/CdwiJDn5xv
I am looking for a trade expert that can show me one industrialized nation that we don't have a trade deficit with.  Germany, South Korea, and China all subsidize their steel industry.		KW

One of our top priorities needs to be cleaning up the culture in our colleges.  		I cannot imagine #Conservative families are happy with their children being force-fed #Liberal values.		This is one of the root causes of the problems we have today.		#FixOurColleges https://t.co/oLkPwkJntU
@CollinRugg #CNN has very educated people working for them.  The only explanation is they are unethical and pushing an agenda intentionally.
We need to switch to #PaperBallotsNow and #VoterIDNow.  		We cannot afford to allow our voting system to be compromised and at the same time allow undocumented immigrants to vote.  		This is not how our system was intended to function. https://t.co/Lwc9g3hntb
Thank you for the support!  This means a lot. https://t.co/v2jHTixux8
It only takes a few hours on Twitter to see  #Conservatives work together to help each other and #Liberals just complain all day.		It's easy to see which strategy will be successful.		#MAGA #ARMYRT #SupportTheNRA #GOP
@mommasew Very True!
@FoxNews With @realDonaldTrump allowing the military to do its job that base probably won't last very long.  If @BarackObama were in charge he would be arming them.
@wildblue65 @POTUS We are finishing up our website and will send out some Tweets when it is complete!		Thank you for the support!
@sandy45_46 @DallasIrey @POTUS Thanks for your support!
The left will never stop this amazing and positive movement that is sweeping the USA.  It's #Patriotism vs #Globalism.  They lost the moment @realDonaldTrump got elected, they just don't know it yet.
