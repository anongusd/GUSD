What's behind our vote recommendation? 1) The emergency declaration is unconstitutional, 2) it's unpopular, 3) it's at odds with experts and military needs, 4) the real crisis is the family separation policy inflicted by the Trump Administration
"The majority of the American people disapprove of President Trump’s power grab to build his border wall, and will be watching  to see how Republicans vote tomorrow and whether they put the Constitution ahead of their blind party loyalty to a weak and unhinged President Trump."
"The only real emergencies along the border are those inflicted by this administration, such as the ongoing trauma of their family separation policy and the hundreds of children who remain separated from their parents."
"National security experts overwhelmingly agree, there is no actual emergency along the border and zero justification for overriding the explicit wishes of Congress."

.@FrankSharry: Do R leaders stand with Trump in saying the President has the absolute right to override the wishes of Congress when it comes to appropriations and national policy? Do Republican leaders stand with the President on taking money from defense to pay for the wall?
.@FrankSharry: When Trump says there is a national emergency and ‘walls work 100%,’ he is lying 100%. He is conning his voters into thinking he is doing something the American people don’t want him to do
.@FrankSharry: The same hard working immigrants he is trying to wall out are the very people who Trump relied on and used and abused to help build Trump Organization golf courses and other properties.
.@FrankSharry: The wall has never been about security; it is an emotional and symbolic response to the President’s desire to keep out and kick out brown people.
.@FrankSharry: Trump couldn’t get it done during two years of GOP control. He shut down government over it but lost that fight. Now he is desperately trying to save face so Ann Coulter doesn’t say mean things about him.
.@FrankSharry: let’s be clear, the wall and Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda are unpopular and growing more so. The wall, the shutdown, and now the emergency declaration are political disasters for Trump and the Republican Party.
.@FrankSharry: The emergency declaration is a powerful symbol of Trump’s incredible weakness...he is embracing the rhetoric of ‘invasion’ to shred the Constitution, overthrow Congressional intent, and maintain his point of view that immigrants are coming to murder Americans.

It's been said that the US immigration system is a "keep out" sign at the border and a "help wanted" sign just beyond that. 		THAT IS TRUMP &amp; UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN A NUTSHELL.		Demonizes against them because it worked politically. Hired them because it worked financially.
#ICYMI: Two key pieces from @TheAtlantic and @washingtonpost underscore that Trump’s wall obsession and larger anti-immigrant agenda is unpopular and threatens lasting damage to the Republican brand. 	https://t.co/9zpmZ0nlpx https://t.co/eeqYrB0vZX
The undocumented workers the Trump Organization hired were paid a fifth of the price as comparable workers, didn't have health care and benefits that others at the club did, were treated as subhuman, and were fired when NYT and WaPo began exposing Trump hiring practices.
IN SUMMARY: this story shows that Trump's hypocrisy knows no bounds. Attacking immigrants is **what Trump does**, and was the whole crux of the 2018 Republican midterm strategy.		Yet the whole time, the Trump Org was tiring whole towns of undocumented workers.
"They treated us as slaves," said one former worker, who became so bitter he never wants to return to the US		There were no benefits, no sick days, no protection like rain jackets. Workers were **made to go into the woods to wait** when Trump visited so they could be "invisible."
Many workers spoke about the harsh treatment they received for being undocumented. They were blocked from taking lunch, berated for speaking English, mocked, and in some cases had to move at a pace that forced them to jog.
Meanwhile, Eric Trump in a promotional video: "We design every single tee, every fairway. . . . We pick the carpets. We pick the chandeliers. There is not one element of these clubhouses which we don’t know about it. You name it — we’re involved.”
Trump had recently launched his presidential campaign, vowing to build a border wall. Torres said she asked Schutzenhofer [the club's general manager] why Trump spoke so harshly about immigrants. 		“This is just politics,” he said.
One worker decided to obtain new papers with his real name partly through his job tenure. Managers just laughed.		“They were making jokes about the Social Security cards in the office, because they looked so fake,” he recalled.
Managers were reportedly well aware that many workers were undocumented at Bedminster.		Dominguez, of Oaxaca, Mexico, recalled telling her manager, "‘Listen, we don’t have good papers.' She said, ‘It doesn’t matter; don’t talk about that.’ ”
The presence of undocumented workers on Trump’s staff was widely known..."It's been a very open secret."		“For me, moving to the U.S. wasn’t a very drastic change,” said Mauricio, who worked at Bedminster for five years. “My whole town practically lived there.”
"After the New York Times in December reported about two housekeepers without legal status who worked at Bedminster, the Trump Organization fired at least 18 employees at five golf courses in New York and New Jersey."
"Amid Trump’s push for a border wall, there has been little public discussion of how U.S. employers — including the president himself — have generated demand for unlawful workers."
In 2011, the police told Bedminster's head of security that a worker was suspected of being undocumented. That means that higher-ups at the club have known about undocumented workers there for at least 8 years.
WaPo spoke with "16 men and women from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries...who said they were employed at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. All of them said they worked for Trump without legal status — and that their managers knew."
One undocumented worker worked for Trump's Bedminster golf course for seven years, earning $8 an hour with no benefits or overtime. "“Many of us helped him get what he has today,” he said. “This golf course was built by" undocumented workers.

Anibal: There are more than 100 undocumented workers who say that they have worked for the Trump Organization, and we don't know how many more are out there.
.@DavidLeopold: This case underscores the criminal activities of the president and his family -- but also how immigration works in this country in a way where we are all complicit.
.@DavidLeopold: We have two crimes here -- one, the falsifying of documents. And two, the Trump Organization cleaning out its undocumented workers now that they've become inconvenient.
.@DavidLeopold, immigration attorney: What we have here is an abhorrent, abusive employer. And it's the president of the United States and his business. This is foul and disgusting.
.@DTaylorUH: The Trump Organization is headed by President Trump, who attacks and demonizes the same immigrants he is secretly hiring.
Now speaking: @DTaylorUH, president of @unitehere: Trump has dehumanized immigrants and called them criminals, when immigrants just want to work hard -- as he knows from the immigrants he's hired.
And nobody spoke out because Trump is powerful and if anyone who filed a lawsuit feared immigration charges.
Victorina was treated badly at the Trump golf club where she worked; her manager said Victorina was "stupider than her dog" and pushed her against the wall. She thinks this is because of the way Trump speaks about immigrants.
Victorina said she didn't have the $160 to pay for the papers, and her supervisor said he got it for her. When she got her paycheck, she paid the supervisor back.
Victorina: "The supervisor said, 'you need to renew certain documents with us'...he said, don't worry about it, I have someone who can obtain documents for you, but I need two pictures from you right now."
Victorina: "When Trump was president, a supervisor approached me, said I had to stop working in Trump's house, and that I had to leave then and there. They never gave me an explanation."
One worker, Victorina Morales, is speaking: "I am from Guatemala and came here in 1999. What you are seeing here today is not a lie. I was a victim of one of Trump's golf clubs. I worked for him for 5 years, and when he was running for office, I had direct office to his house."
"The Trump Organization is a criminal enterprise. These immigrants have been physically abused and threatened w deportation. They are material witnesses to a federal crime. Any attempt to remove them from the US could be an obstruction of justice."
We're on a call with Anibal Romero, an attorney representing 20 undocumented housekeepers employed for many years by the Trump Organization. The TO exploited them, then fired them when they spoke up about their stories.
"These individual workers are inspiring because each has made it clear in interviews that they are speaking up in order to help protect the millions of other workers like themselves who lack papers and are vulnerable." - @FrankSharry
"The Trump Organization also treated them differently by paying them less and denying them benefits extended to other workers. They did this for years." - @FrankSharry
"There is ample evidence that the Trump Organization knew full well that these and other of their workers were undocumented; the Trump Organization helped facilitate false documents for them and others" - @FrankSharry

Today is the 2-year anniversary of Donald Trump's inauguration. Here are just some of the things he's changed on immigration during his presidency. via @AmericasVoice @juana_esquivel https://t.co/lk1Mpqqt2O
The next few days are predictable. Trump will claim he hit a home run. Rs will call Trump a statesman. Ann Coulter’s head will explode. And 800,000 federal workers will desperately seek to keep their families housed and fed, all because Trump likes to take and hold hostages.
As someone who wants nothing more than to see America put millions of undocumented immigrants on a path to permanent legal status and eventual citizenship, I am deeply disappointed.
As long as Miller has the President’s ear, it’s nearly impossible to imagine a decent deal that Democrats could embrace.		So, here we are. An incompetent White House fails again.
The asylum “reform” Trump mentioned in his speech is code for policies that would result in kids and their families being detained indefinitely in U.S. internment camps and unaccompanied minors being deported to their deaths in Central America.
Trump tried to trade a million immigrants he took hostage early in his presidency for a deal that would release his other hostages: the 800,000 federal government workers affected by the shutdown.
With Dreamers and TPS holders, Trump is the source of the problem he’s now pledging to fix.... the fact that judges have intervened shouldn’t mean Trump gets to use these immigrants as bargaining chips.
Trump’s speech turned out to be a warmed over version of his failed address just days ago. Sure, he sprinkled some faux relief for Dreamers and TPS holders on top. But for those of us hoping for something bold and balanced, the speech was yet another failed PR gesture.
.@FrankSharry column at @dailybeast: Democrats would be idiots to support Trump’s shutdown deal. I’ve spent my life trying to reach immigration reform, and Democrats should reject Trump's latest offer.

.@pilitobar87: The urgent crisis facing the country right now is the fact that a quarter of the federal government is closed down, and 800,000 federal workers are being unfairly punished. The blame lies solely on Trump and Republican enablers such as Mitch McConnell.
.@pilitobar87: Donald Trump isn’t interested in making a deal. He’s interested in shifting the blame. Let’s hope the media doesn’t fall for his bad-faith maneuver. We are confident that Democrats won’t take the bait.
.@pilitobar87: Moreover, Trump ‘negotiated’ this offer with the Vice President and his son-in-law. He should look up the word ‘negotiation’ in the dictionary. Last we checked, it means that both sides are involved. This so-called ‘deal’ is just a one-sided fever dream.
.@pilitobar87: Today’s proposal is neither bold nor new. TPS holders and DACA recipients would receive a temporary reprieve – protections already extended by the federal courts – in exchange for unaccompanied minors being denied life-saving protections at the border, and a wall.
.@pilitobar87: The President needs to act immediately to reopen the government. Families across the country are suffering because of the President’s temper tantrum over an unnecessary wall.

.@David_J_Bier: The Trump Admin is already making things bad for families by closing down crossings and forcing people to try and cross in remote areas. A border wall would make that even worse.
.@David_J_Bier: Furthermore, only 0.2% of border arrests were for violent crimes. The vast, vast majority are people coming to seek freedom and a better life.
.@David_J_Bier: In 2018, Border Patrol agents encountered a border crosser once every *16 days*. That includes asylum seekers who are turning themselves in. To claim this is a crisis is totally divorced from the facts.
.@cecmunoz: At the border, we don't have large numbers of people seeking to evade our authority, who could be dissuaded by a wall. We have people *seeking* our authority (because they need help). We need a thoughtful policy conversation that addresses refugees at our border.
.@cecmunoz: What we have here is a president struggling to keep a campaign promise, on a subject that fact checkers have found him to be lying about the most.
.@juliettekayyem: A national security emergency, which might still be declared, wouldn't let Trump go as far as some fear, but it would let him move around resources. It would be a desperate move by a president who has no other moves to make.
.@kerritalbot: This is not about border security, it's about Trump and Stephen Miller trying to appease the far right. The wall doesn't address push factors in central America, and it doesn't help families seeking asylum.

Event is wrapping up, watch the whole video here! https://t.co/gLouQTT3dH
.@RalstonReports: Ralson and Heller mimicked Donald Trump's anti-immigrant dog whistle in how they talked about immigration and sanctuary cities. I've never seen anything like it: they focused on a non-issue in order to turn out the worst parts of their base. And that backfired.
Meanwhile, campaigners talked about immigration as a major topic when knocking on doors: 'this candidate shares our values, this candidate has fought for our communities.' #ElectionEve2018
Q: What role did immigration play in this election? 		@Dfdamore: Even the party that needs new American voters more, talked about immigration less. That's something Dems will need to remedy.

.@FrankSharry: The Trump-Miller-Nielsen strategy has many components: make it nearly impossible to request asylum, prosecute immigrants, separate families, detain people for as long as possible, lock up minors, gut asylum standards, bully immigration judges.
.@FrankSharry: For years, CBP has been confronted with reports and litigation regarding the inhumane conditions. And for years, CBP and DHS have done nothing but perpetuate conditions so dehumanizing that if they were visited upon Americans we would call it torture.
.@FrankSharry: The CBP holding centers are wretched places. Freezing temps, no beds, lights left on, no showers, not enough toilets or toilet paper, filthy conditions, horrible smell, inedible food and not enough clean water. Most of those released are dazed, sick and hungry.
.@FrankSharry: The tragic and preventable death of an innocent seven-year old girl should not be seen as a mistake made in an otherwise humane system, but rather a deliberately cruel and dehumanizing system that has produced yet another death.

.@DavidLeopold: The brave women who’ve come forward to seek justice are victims of crime. This demands a thorough, robust and complete investigation by federal authorities and the New Jersey Attorney General’s office.
.@DavidLeopold: The number of  undocumented imms alleging they were recruited, hired and abused by Trump organization at Bedminster has grown and is likely growing. These allegations smack of a pattern and practice of criminal activity and civil violations Trump organization.
List of potential criminal and civil statutes violated: transporting immigrants for commercial gain, hiring undocumented workers, pattern of hiring undocumented workers, concealing document fraud, employing others by force, knowledge of employment by force.
Federal and state authorities must investigate the serious allegations being made. Pending an investigation, the undocumented workers should be considered for all available legal protection under federal and state law, including U and T visas.

Here's the recap: AAPI voters vote as Democrat and increasingly identify as Dems. They — especially women and millennials — repudiate Trump and his divisive tactics. #electioneve2018 https://t.co/IkIfKNvIds
73% of AAPI voters say they encouraged friends and family to vote, and roughly 1 in 5 donated money or attended a rally — much higher than results in previous years. #electioneve2018 https://t.co/9x5cuSMfhO
Only 54% of AAPI voters report being contacted to vote in the last few months, and 41% say they were contacted by community organizations about voting (double the amount from 2014). #electioneve2018 https://t.co/zNVeU0U5So

Here's the AAPI vote breakdown in key Senate and Governor's races. AAPI voters are a growing portion of both voters and eligible voters, and voted at a high enough margin to be decisive in some of this year's ultra-tight races. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/eMnHnAQOEO
In all battleground districts, AAPI voters chose the Dem House candidate 70% of the time. That's up from 65% in 2014. In Texas, it's a jump from 43% in 2014 to 62% this year. Women and millennials were most likely to support Dems. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/1RReY4EBjW

Finally, here's the polling breakdown of AAPI respondents from this year's #ElectionEve2018 poll. Find more at https://t.co/lEMw01pvvm via @aapifund and @LatinoDecisions /end https://t.co/CYCDQfQiZ7
The immigrant experience is personal for AAPI voters, with 39% personally knowing or interacting with immigrants and 16% interacting through friend/family ties. 29% of AAPI voters turned out this year to support/represent the AAPI community. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/jQPqAQTjDG
More than half of AAPI voters were contacted to vote in the last few months, and 3/4 of them were contacted by Democrats. There's a high rate of self-mobilization, with 73% mobilizing their friends and family members to vote. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/uGKQPr1eb9
77% of AAPI voters think the Republican Party is hostile to, or ignores their concerns. Democrats do better, but not great. #ElectionEve2018 @GOP @TheDemocrats https://t.co/pslrr1dpMR
By an almost 3-1 margin, Asian American and Pacific Islander voters support more inclusive messaging on immigration, rather than more restrictive messaging. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/XqE7fxwuet
AAPI voters overwhelmingly support the Dream Act, health care, and gun control #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/UpKgHr1YQB
To further break this down by issue: virtually all AAPI voters think men and women should enjoy equal pay for equal work, and agree that sexual harassment continues to be a major problem in the U.S. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/jQamXlKZEq
Top issues for the AAPI community: 	1) health care	2) the economy 	3) immigration reform 	4) gun violence 	5) education 	6) racism and discrimination #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/hsfL2ulNbi
7 out of 10 AAPI voters feel that 1) Trump's statements and policies are setting back the AAPI community, 2) Trump and Republicans' rhetoric is divisive, and 3) that Trump and the GOP are normalizing sexism and harassment against women. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/23OOBVlLTu
AAPI voters feel ANGRY (65%) when it comes to Donald Trump. 64% either somewhat or strongly disapprove. And 59% feel like Trump's policies negatively impact their communities. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/pQOjQsy50U
Which Senators and Governors did AAPI voters support? In NV, TN, and FL Senator races they supported the Democrat by 2/3 margin. Same for CA, NV, GA, and FL gubernatorial races #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/WPRrbf04Wo
Which House candidates did AAPI voters support? By at least 2/3 majorities in CA, NV, TX, GA, and FL, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders supported the Democrat. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/FilXNRLwzC

Latino voters overwhelmingly support the Dream Act, health care, and gun laws. #ElectionEve2018 via @LatinoDecisions polling https://t.co/GcS6VolTo6
Between a welcoming immigration message and a restrictionist immigration message, voters overwhelmingly supported the welcoming message. White voters didn't particularly support the restrictionist message either. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/3ZSb7tqnoE
Some 3 out of 4 Latinos believed that Trump had a negative or racist impact on their communities, with people feeling disrespected. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/0HaBPsooTo

Latino turnout in Texas: some exit polls suggest Ted Cruz received around 37% of Latino vote, but again exit polls have recently come under fire. @LatinoDecisions data showing that in many places, for example Harris County, more than 80% of Latinos were going for @RepBetoORourke https://t.co/o023yxCFRv
Voter self-mobilization was HIGHEST among voters of color, with 75-79% of AAPI, Latino, and black voters encouraging their friends and family members to vote. #ElectionEve2018 via @LatinoDecisions https://t.co/Pe3ZMdP8Dp
Are Dems hostile to or ignoring my community? Voters of color generally say no, but the numbers could be much better. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/R9P1KGZBWO
Is the GOP being hostile to you, or ignoring you? More than 70% of AAPI, Latino, and African-American voters say yes. #ElectionNight2018 https://t.co/f5rdOwpBm4
Other issues that voters want to see addressed? The Dream Act, affordable health care, and gun laws #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/nZxH3SOs6k
All voters show overwhelming support for the idea that attacking immigrants does nothing, AND THAT Congress should work together on bipartisan immigration reform. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/vhvGFp8tYA
When given two messages, one attacking immigrants and one that was welcoming, voters preferred the welcoming message by 13%. Far greater support among voters of color, but no gain for whites by attacking immigrants. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/AkWrXA05NO
Similarly, solid majorities of Americans — including high supermajorities of Asian, black, and Latino voters — saw Trump/GOP attacks as divisive. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/DZBhpz6tzR
"We must continue investing in Texas, especially along the border, to ensure that Latinos continue to grow their power in a state in which they’ll soon be the majority."- @_mariocarrillo_
The rise of racism: 56% of voters said Trump had a negative or racist impact on their communities; this number was in the 70s for Latinos and black voters. #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/oFZOUUb0kw
"Latinos in Texas have made their presence felt throughout the state with historic turnout for a midterm along the border, gains in Latino-heavy districts, as well as sending two Latinas to the House of Representatives."- @_mariocarrillo_
"Texas is well on its way to becoming a swing state &amp; Latino voters remain the key. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign went a long way in engaging &amp; inspiring Texans in every corner of the state, and we must build on the foundation he has set." - our Texas State Director @_mariocarrillo_
Was this election a referendum on Donald Trump? Oh, yes. 62% of voters in battleground districts said Trump made them feel angry, and 54% felt disrespected (way higher for voters of color). #ElectionEve2018 https://t.co/hiodBIX8ao
"Unprecedented support from Latinos shows that there are gains to be made if the investments are there." - @FrankSharry
"This should be a wake-up call for Democrats that Texas is winnable. Beto O’Rourke has paved the wave for future progressive candidates to loudly support policies that are pro-immigrant." - our Executive Director @FrankSharry
Latino-heavy districts break big for @BetoORourke but @tedcruz keeps senate seat. https://t.co/XkCPH7mkvT https://t.co/vbW4NJftha
In 70 battleground districts, voters broke for Dems 53-44 (7 point advantage). Dem gains largely came from voters of color. #ElectionEve2018 via @LatinoDecisions https://t.co/hEEyavYHXG
Why does @LatinoDecisions like election eve polling rather than exit polling? The latter has come under fire recently for not providing representative samples and not speaking to enough voters of color. Also methodology: https://t.co/nHjaFBgOpB

Kids have lots of questions–but they shouldn't have to ask whether they’ll have access to nutritious food or quality health care. Trump's new "public charge" regulation would provoke these chilling questions. Let's stop it from happening: https://t.co/aGQDbFmpKB #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/facgLCQbba
Millions of children in the United States have at least one immigrant parent, and many of them would be hurt by the proposed changes to the "public charge" rule. We shouldn't be punishing families for meeting their basic needs. We should #ProtectFamilies: https://t.co/aGQDbFmpKB https://t.co/NDeYnQGMTI

Trump’s new rule change could damage public schools for generations, and the impact is massive: 1/4 of kids in the U.S. have at least 1 immigrant parent, and 1/2 of America’s public school students live below the poverty line. Let’s act + #ProtectFamilies https://t.co/aGQDbFmpKB https://t.co/DgeQK6KR41
All our nation’s children should have the opportunity thrive – but a new rule change from the Trump administration would deprive immigrant children of access to nutritious food, health care, and housing. Take action to #ProtectFamilies now: https://t.co/aGQDbFmpKB https://t.co/oYqk2JIHmP

“La interrogante es cómo se comportará el voto latino de Nevada en la elección intermedia”, @maribelhastings https://t.co/ucQ6pNot8O
@realMABarreto 73 percent of voters said that the child separation policy made them angry. By a rate of 69-31, white voters in swing districts also said that the policy made them angry. Dems are +15% on immigration since 2015. Voters support immigration reform, not mass deportations.
@realMABarreto "In 2016, Trump's anti-immigrant campaign resonated with his core supporters and it may well again in 2018, but this year more people have been turned off by the reality of his anti-immigrant politics. As a result, Mr. Trump’s vile strategy is more likely to backfire this time."
