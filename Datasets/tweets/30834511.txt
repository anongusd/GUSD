@lawrence I meant thank God she's no longer part of our government. Darn spell check!
@lawrence Condoleeza Rice is a  total moron. Praise God that her no longer part of our government. I love your show. You're the best! :-)
Why do Republicans repeat the other persons name or say excuse me over and over when they are doing well during a discussion? #annoying
I've seen color photos of JFK during his autopsy with a chunk of his head gone. GROSS! I know #OBL is dead & I don't want to see pix.
Why do people have to talk at the same time on news talk shows? No one can get their point across because they can't be heard.
$55,000.00 per year for a US Navy SEAL? That is pitifully sad.
I wish life had an exit door. When it's obvious you aren't good at it, can't you just be done? So tired of same shit diff day.
@lawrence Better a terrible interviewer than a terrible secretary of state. And you're an awesome interviewer cuz u don't take any crap!
RT @DeepakChopra: Dear Mr Trump do you want to see  Osama bin Laden's  death certificate--long form or short form ?

@fromJtoZ You're welcome. Nausea sucks. Especially when you have to be at work.

@CFFdotCom haha. Good on ya!
@andersoncooper Yes, otherwise there will always be doubters. I guess there will be doubters anyway cuz they'll say the photos are fake.
@CFFdotCom Lol! True.
@CFFdotCom James is adorable. And he was darker when he was a baby. Was just funny to see him referred to by his race/color, not his name.
@CFFdotCom And I'm glad you don't. He's the celebrity, not his kids.
@CFFdotCom People with Angelman Syndrome have lighter than normal skin and hair.
@CFFdotCom Someone needs to tell his family the cute one is an imposter. The older English one is really their Colin. Ha!
@CFFdotCom His black son? Haha. Nice. Probably same reason we've never seen Henry. None of our business.
@CFFdotCom Put a picture of Firth on the website with large text stating that its not Colin Farrell. Lol.
@CFFdotCom Lol! Forgot that one. I like Firth but I LOVE Farrell.
@CFFdotCom It cracks me up every time. I bet Colin Farrell would think it's hilarious. He can blame Miami Vice on Firth. Lol.
@CFFdotCom Dear World, Colin Farrell & Colin Firth are two different people!! Farrell is hotter and Firth is English. Get it right! Lol.
@CFFdotCom Hahahahahaha!! Not again! FFS!!!
