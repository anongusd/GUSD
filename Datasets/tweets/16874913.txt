We do it right here and Gov. LePage knows it! We can’t wait to have you here in Florida!  #millertime #FL07 #Sayfie
“I have a house in Florida. I will pay no income tax and the house in Florida’s property taxes are $2,000 less than we were paying in Boothbay,” LePage said. “At my age, why wouldn’t you conserve your resources and spend it on family (rather) than spend it on taxes?” Gov.LePage
I’m proud to have the endorsement of Speaker Carlos “Johnny” Mendez and 14 other members of the Puerto Rican General Assembly.

Stephanie Murphy is nothing but a Pelosi puppet—voting with liberal Nancy Pelosi 9 times out of 10. She votes FOR San Francisco, NOT #FL07. We deserve a representative who stands up for what's RIGHT.

Pelosi &amp; Murphy voted: 	✔️AGAINST a Balanced Budget Amendment	✔️AGAINST Tax Relief for Middle Class Families	✔️FOR San Francisco	Looks like Pelosi’s $14K is paying dividends—Murphy’s partisan allegiance is to Pelosi. Central FL deserves a representative who votes for US. #FlaPol https://t.co/mFVAX6moS5
Did you know Extreme Liberal Nancy Pelosi is one of Stephanie Murphy’s LARGEST DONORS, contributing $14,000 to her campaign. Maybe that’s why Stephanie Murphy votes WITH Nancy Pelosi nearly 90% of the time. Have you seen their voting record?

"But the core votes for cutting taxes, for cutting regulations, for trying to make our country a stronger place, she has to vote with the leadership of the Democratic Party and that is not where this country is.” #FL07 #FlaPol	https://t.co/jLgs5wPL48
“I think she is beholden to her leader,” Miller said. “I think that Nancy Pelosi is going to make sure that she comes home on most of the big votes. She may get away with a vote here and there, which she tried to highlight in this debate…"
“I love this guy. I want to serve in Congress with this guy, but this is a winnable race. You all know this. That’s why you’re out. This race is tightening up to where we can win this race, Mike can win this race and serve in Congress.” #FL07 #FlaPol	https://t.co/KtwEYxrcJC

We don’t mean to ruffle any feathers. Just wish that Stephanie Murphy would tell voters the truth: When it comes to her votes, she doesn’t wing it—she votes with Nancy Pelosi more than 90% of the time! Ebak! Ebak! #chicken #FL07 #FlaPol https://t.co/gRrEVjZDWn
We thought Stephanie Murphy would be egg-cited to see Nancy Pelosi in Central Florida today… but it looks like she’s flown the coop. Can’t find her! #chicken #FL07 #FlaPol https://t.co/tf7wR4JIXS
They say “Birds of a feather flock together.” Since Stephanie Murphy votes with Nancy Pelosi more than 90% of the time, we figured they’d be together while Pelosi is in the District. Why is Stephanie hiding from Nancy today? #Chicken #FL07 #FlaPol https://t.co/ORcc6HNCbT
Voters want decisive leaders—not someone who outsources their decisions. #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie	https://t.co/wwSpXA7PDH
I'm willing to debate anytime, anywhere. 		Rep. Murphy says, "It's up to my campaign schedulers." Does she make any decisions on her own? She even runs her votes by Nancy Pelosi—who she votes with 90% of the time.

I’ll be honored to stand next to the Republican leader of the US House when he comes to town to help my candidacy. Stephanie Murphy should not try to hide Nancy Pelosi from the cameras—most importantly she should not misrepresent her own liberal record in Congress #FlaPol #Sayfie
While Pelosi’s stealthy fundraising swing through Central Florida has no announced public events, she will be doing pubic campaign events for 2 other Democrat nominees in S Florida, according to a recent article in the Washington Post #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie	https://t.co/qm0AUdnZwA
Stephanie Murphy and Nancy Pelosi even joined in voting AGAINST a Balanced Budget Amendment. If someone is coming to Central Florida on a mission to become the third in the line of succession to the Presidency, why keep it a secret? #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie
On the campaign trail, Murphy talks like a moderate but in the People’s House she's anything but. Stephanie Murphy votes with Nancy Pelosi 90% of the time. They voted AGAINST the broad-based tax cuts that are creating jobs &amp; spurring the economy to over 4% growth. #FlaPol #Sayfie
Unlike the rest of her travels this week, Pelosi’s trip to Central FL has been kept under tight wraps by local Democrats including Murphy. Why would Stephanie Murphy hide the fact her party’s leader will be in town raising $$$ that will benefit her campaign? #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie
Tomorrow, under the cover of darkness, Nancy Pelosi is coming to #FL07 to raise $$$ to help Stephanie Murphy &amp; other Democrats. This move comes amid a recent $34 MILLION cash haul Pelosi made for Democrats in her bid to once again reign as Speaker of the US House. #FlaPol #Sayfie

Today, we celebrate 231 years since our U.S. Constitution was signed and sent to the states for ratification. Let us be grateful to live in a nation where the ideals of our Founding Fathers are recognized, protected and upheld. #WeThePeople #ConstitutionDay #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie https://t.co/EMFxWw5F0V
Central Florida families know that we simply cannot spend more than what we take in—it’s time that Washington does the same. As your Congressman, I will work to reign in overspending and cut down on waste in Washington. Will you stand with me? #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie https://t.co/91klGuGQWo
I’m proud to support a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget. Unfortunately, my opponent, voted AGAINST requiring the federal government to ‘live within its means’ while state governments, like Florida, are required to balance our checkbooks.
Honored to meet with you the day after the 17th anniversary of 9/11. It  reminded me of the great leadership you provided for New York City and  our country during one of America's darkest times. #FlaPol #Sayfie https://t.co/mYAw7xhvsR
We will never forget what we saw, where we were, what we felt, and the acts of bravery that occurred seventeen years ago. Today, we remember the innocent lives lost on September 11, 2001. #NeverForget https://t.co/a6OWzCsu1M

Just heard Judge Kavanaugh talk about Mr. Abell, one of the great teachers we shared at Mater Dei, who taught from ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’—the best way to understand a person is “to stand in his or her shoes"... So true! #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie
Today, as the historical confirmation process for Judge Kavanaugh begins, I urge Congress to give him a fair opportunity to discuss his lifetime commitment to upholding the Constitution. I am confident he will serve our country well on the Supreme Court. #FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie https://t.co/PocYPJXCGx
I attended Mater Dei Catholic grade school with Brett Kavanaugh. At Mater Dei, we learned to live our lives in service for others. This has stuck with me my entire life—as I know it has for Judge Kavanaugh—&amp; fueled my desire to serve the people of FL in the State House &amp; Congress
“I’m thrilled to support this impressive, diverse group and look forward to welcoming them to Congress, where we can continue working to protect our communities and ease Americans’ cost of living.” 	— NRCC Chairman Steve Stivers 		https://t.co/9Usi7jGV17 	#FL07 #FlaPol #Sayfie https://t.co/vDSx7KVlQF

I am humbled by all of the support tonight, and throughout the campaign. It is clear our message of continuing the tax cuts, fighting for a balanced budget, and protecting our borders resonated with voters. That is the difference between me and my opponent.
