@IronStache More should be done to cut taxes for middle class childless adults. Tax breaks for private jets re rediculous nd should eliminated. Carried interest and CEO compensation tax breaks should be eliminated. And Pro Sports Leagues shouldn't be tax exempt.
@IronStache Smaller refunds mean people are overpaying less. Their income is higher. And people who have children still get a big tax cut. Unfortunatley the tax cut didnt do much to help people who dont have children.

@SwtCaroline2213 @bestbeehave @SherrodBrown @realDonaldTrump If a millionaire pays millions of dollars in state taxes why should that person get millions of dollars in deductions while the middle class don't? And raising the cap to $25,000 would be enough to protect the upper middle class. Than it can be eliminated for the wealthy.
@KamalaHarris Mineral rights on federal lands are worth $128 Trillion. We could pay off the national debt and have money left for a lot of good things if you left-wing libtards were willing to access the money. We could still protect the most important land including the national parks.

@not_deluded @Charles53462592 @QuancyClayborne @ThrobbingUnit @GOP Only $1,400 is refundable.

@nebraskadem @RWPUSA @CBS6 Trump doesn't lie. Accidently getting a detail wrong is not the same as lying. It's not a lie if you believe what you're saying is true. And clearly there were political motivations behind those accusations.
@nebraskadem @RWPUSA @CBS6 Kavanaugh was falsely accused and so was Trump. Neither of them are guilty of what they were accused of. Those accusations were politically motivated and were lies.
@RWPUSA @CBS6 He made a mistake when he was younger, who hasn't. Obama used cocaine when he was younger no called on him to resign. Im tired of all these SJWs.
@PattyMurray They aren't paid less they earn less big difference. It's not discrimination which is already illegal.  Men choose higher payer jobs than women choose. Also women work less hours than men. Why don't you tell people the truth?

@Jmf134Jeff Companies do what's in their best interest. If companies know producing overseas will lower their tax bill they'll do it. If they know they'll pay less here than before that will get them a reason to produce here. Our unreasonable taxes drove companies to send jobs overseas.
@greenka40 @rondido @21WFMJ @21WFMJNews Since people aren't buying enough of the models made at those factories they could use those factories to make a model that sells better with some tax breaks to keep them there.

@DPSnacks @TheSportsHayes @BigEsNemesis @James_RakeII @_mattcombs @EBischoff @WCWNitroBook @davemeltzerWON @THEVinceRusso And by the way WWE has a great roster with great talent but the bad writing is holding them back. The in ring on the PPVs is good. They need more stipulations and better build to the PPV matches.
@DPSnacks @TheSportsHayes @BigEsNemesis @James_RakeII @_mattcombs @EBischoff @WCWNitroBook @davemeltzerWON @THEVinceRusso With the WWE Network, events in countries WWE didn't hold events in back than of course they're making more money. But that doesn't mean the product is that good. Less people watch now than they did back for a reason. And without the TV deals they wouldn't be making that much

@DPSnacks @TheSportsHayes @BigEsNemesis @James_RakeII @_mattcombs @EBischoff @WCWNitroBook @davemeltzerWON @THEVinceRusso WCW was so far behind WWE that they would never catch up even with Russo. Those shows he wrote are more entertaining than today's Raw and smackdown episodes. And TNAs ratings were at annall time high when russo was wrtiing for them.
@DPSnacks @TheSportsHayes @BigEsNemesis @James_RakeII @_mattcombs @EBischoff @WCWNitroBook @davemeltzerWON @THEVinceRusso Most of the fall in House show attendance happened before Russo went to WCW. And TV ratings and PPV buys are more important.
@bundyontop @CS_SE_MKNZ @THEVinceRusso @IMPACTWRESTLING @XtremeCW27 @TheRealDisco @TheEliDrake TNA had their highest ratings ever when Russo was head writer. When he left the ratings fell.
@williambr0wn Wrestling storylines are not real. If a wrestler says something racist sexism or anti gay on the mic it's just their character saying it. No need to take wrestling that seriously. Wrestling is fictional entertainment. It's thinking like this that's why wrestling can't be edgy.
@grammy2 @JerryDunleavy Np they're not. Only a small nu,ber of abortio s occur for that reason. They're almost all due to women who can't handle being pregnant and taking the easy way out,

@DavidLaufmanLaw The intelligence community kidnapped people and drugged them against their will back in the 50s and 60s. It was called MK Ultra and it's been declassified. How anybody could talk about them so highly after that. They also said there were WMDs in Iraq.
@SenatorDurbin Our country supported stalin because of the need to defeat Hitler and supporting the Saudis because they oppose Iran is the right thing to do. Seems you don't know your history.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The money Saudi Arabia is spending helps US workers. Also he will be reelected by a landslide in 2020. He may even win 40 states. Also GOP takes back the House possib my picking up  66 seats and filibuster proof senate in 2020.
@KamalaHarris Killing a baby isn't health care it's murder. Abortion is not a health care desicion. Doctors who perform abortions are worse than hitler.
@kasie Local print and Local Tv reporters should have access to those press conferences. The White House should expand access.
@BillKristol America is winning. Trump said he would drain the swamp and combating corruption at DOJ is part of that. And trump has every right to have crooked Hilary prosecuted. DOJ is required to prosecute her if the President wants it.
@timkaine Didn't the US work alongside Joseph Stalin during WW2? The Saudis oppose Iran. Iran is a big threat to our country.
@RWPUSA @CNN She's not a cabinet member and wasn't confirmed by the senate. Those rules apply to those leading agencies or cabinet members not someone like ivanka.
@Sue_Zee_Que4 @tapley_kate @eorlins A baby is not an organ. Not even the same thing. A woman could donate the baby after its born by putting the baby up for adoption. A baby shouldn't die just because the mother can't handle being pregnant.
@SherrodBrown @GOP Whatabnout the rich peop,e that cant deduct their full State and Local Taxes. Doesn't benefit them. The wealthy can no longer buy a rolls royce a yacht or a private jet and deduct the sales tax. Wealthy CEOs who travel for business no longer get to deduct the travel cost.
@Sue_Zee_Que4 @tapley_kate @eorlins Not referring to that. 90% of abortions are done just because the mother can't handle being pregnant and wants to take the easy way out
@lolagomezucla @ACLU Asylum is not once mentioned in the constitution. You just want to open our borders up to everybody. Coming to America is a privilege not a right. Open borders was tried in Europe and it's not working out. We don't need to import the third world.
@tapley_kate @Sue_Zee_Que4 @eorlins No decent doctor would perform an abortion. Doctors who do aren't doctors they're murderers.
@Sue_Zee_Que4 @tapley_kate @eorlins What about the babies body? The its my body agrument fails to take into account the babies body.

@Icanbelieveher @eorlins It's not just men who are pro-life there are pro-life women too. Tennessee just elected a pro-life woman to the Senate.
@eorlins That bill should be changed. Punish the doctors but not women. And without exceptions for medical necessity the public support for the pro-life cause will not be there.
@ACLU Asylum is not a constitutional right. Nobody is entitled to be here.
@robspodcastmug @kylegriffin1 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia opposes Iran. We still need their help dealing with them. As bad as the Saudis are the Iranians are worse.
@bythos10 @kylegriffin1 He didn't help inflict that pain He had nothing to do with it.
@miri_iron @Maida56 @boyndog @kylegriffin1 @realDonaldTrump How is it his fault the Saudis did that? Obama would have responded in similar fashion.
@tlccourville @kylegriffin1 No reason for him to feel guilt. He didn't have him murdered the Saudi prince did. And who in their right mind would want to see a tape like that. And the US during WW2 worked with stalin to oppose Hitler. And the Saudis oppose Iran which are comparable to the nazis.
@RealSaavedra How is not liking Hillary Clinton racist? Hillary Clinton is white. And We voted for him becuase we don't believe he's racist. The media distorts what he's says to make it sound racist.

@antpooh @Litecoin2000 @LJFCAT @tedwards_ It was Russos idea for Vince McMahon to become an on air heel character after the Montreal Screw Job.
@antpooh @Litecoin2000 @LJFCAT @tedwards_ The beer truck, the zamboni, the cement truck, the Big Shows name, HHH becoming champion, HHHs the game nickname, the ministry, the corporation, the Val Venus character, The Rock heel turn at the 1998 survivor series,  all Russos ideas.
@antpooh @Litecoin2000 @LJFCAT @tedwards_ The creative direction WWE went in during the attitude era was Russos idea. If it weren't for the attitude era was would have lost the no day night war. Almost everything you saw on Raw was written by Russo or Ed Ferrara.
@LJFCAT @tedwards_ @antpooh @Litecoin2000 Most of the ideas were Russos. McMahon came up with the idea of having Mike Tyson come to Wrestlemania and the Chainsaw Charlie gimmick for Terry Funk.
@Evans1161 @SherrodBrown What I said is accurate. And Brown agrees with Trump on trade.
@jaketapper Melania's hotter than Stormy.
@TheRickWilson There may be a VCR in my shed but I hadn't used it in over a decade or more.
@Steve_GTG @Planetofthe8 @davemeltzerWON Vince McMahon didn't originally want the attitude era to happen. Russo told McMahon to his face that the product sucked. It was mostly Russos idea for WWE to go in that direction.
@thetokist @Litecoin2000 WCW was losing money way before Russo worked there. And TNA's ratings have fallen since he left. There were 2 million viewers watching TNA when Russo was there now there's less a half a million.
@calixtogonzale5 @Litecoin2000 Russos shows were may more entertaining than today's crap. And the championship don't have any value nobodies really winning them the fights aren't real. And sexual content is entertaining. Thats why Howard Stern and Jerry springer were popular.
@LJFCAT @Litecoin2000 Most of what made it to air during the attitude era were Russos ideas not McMahon. McMahon didn't write the show Russo did. Mcmahon rarely turned down Russos ideas. In WCW Russo had to answer to Ted Turners people and in TNA he had to answer to Dixie.

@elle_bee_are @coremudgeon @dogsmycopilot @jaywhy321 @LamarWhiteJr That was taken out of context. What he intended to say was that if all of her supporters voted and his supporters stayed home he would lose. He was trying to motivate his supporters to trun out on election day.

@DanRather Those people are not seeking legimate asylum. Asylum is for people being persecuted by their government not people wanting jobs or victims of domestic violence and crime. And most of the caravan are not women and children. Most are adult men. This is all one big scam to get here.
@RepThomasMassie There should be a law barring E-Verify fro. Being used that way. But we do need to prevent illegals from working in our country. Jobs are a magnet for illegals.

@washingtonpost Trum p is the most pro Israel president in US history. Certainly n9t an anti-semite.
@DawnM43091820 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump All the replacement bills proposed kept the pre-existing conditions coverage. None of those bills would do away with that part of the law. Youre being lied to about that.
@SenSchumer His plan spends more on medicaid than current law.
@KamalaHarris Predictions like this have been wrong in the past. How about just dealing with the issue is reasonable way instead of using scare get a and Joseph Geobels style propaganda.
@SenSchumer Bans on imposing lifetime limits can be left in place in a replacement bill. Of course you won't tell be that will you? Dishonest Chuck is at it again.
@SenSchumer Not everyone needs a plan that covers that. Only people who need maternity care should have to pay for it. Exempting single men and women who can't have kids while requiring women who need it to have access should be done
@SenSchumer People would believe that if you weren't lying to the American people about this.
@SherrodBrown @RepJimRenacci The biggest threat to Medicare &amp; Social Security is the high cost of those programs. Those programs are the biggest  cause of our debt.  Leaving those programs exactly as they are is what harms those programs. But you won't be honest with the people Ohio all for political gain.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Youre a dishonest liar. He has never proposed repealing pre-existing conditions. Why can't you tell the truth idiot? I hope the people of Oregon vote you put in 2020. Every replcement plan kept that prt of obmacare in place.
@JoeNBC The man that carried out the synagogue attack was anti-trump becuase he felt the president was too pro Israel. But don't le t the truth get in the way of your propaganda. Geobels would be proud.
@SenSchumer The presidents plan would slow the growth of Medicaid spending. More money would still be spent on medicaid. Real cuts men spending less money not more.
@timkaine Youre a liar. He's only eliminating birthright citizenship for children born to non-citizens. The senator who wrote that clause specifically said that it does not apply to the children of foreigners aliens and diplomats.
@SenSchumer And the subsidies could be adjusted by he for older Americans. That would protect older Americans from some of the added cost while reducing premiums for younger people making it more affordable for young people to sign up.
@SenSchumer By only being allowed to charge older Americans 3x what they charge young people under current law younger Americans are being over charged for their insurance. There already is an age tax against young people.

@StarMakerBolin @Kokomothegreat The rabbi from the synagogue that was attacked asked him to come.
@justinamash Also in addition to eliminating birthright citizenship for illegals eliminate all constitutional rights for illegals. People who come here illegally don't deserve rights to begin with.
@justinamash Congress can pass a law interpreting the 14th Amendment so that illegals are not subject to the jurisdiction thereof and their children are ineligible. Congress can define the meaning of birthright citizenship. And if Scotus won't allow it then amend the constitution.
@StarMakerBolin @realDonaldTrump The rabbi from the synagogue said he wanted the president to come.
@brannonj17 @BillKristol Youre being lied to about pre-existing conditions. All obamacare replacements kept the pre-existing conditions part of the law. Just because shumer says it doesn't make it true. He's lying to you and the media are repeating his lies.
@Lonya53 @BillKristol Birthright citizenship is stupid. Most countries are smart enough not to do this. Illegals are taking advantage of us they're the lowest of the lows.
@BillKristol Than hold an article 5 convention of states and pass several amendments including this along with other amendments. The constitution should also be amended to strip illegals of all constitutional rights.
@ACLU @realDonaldTrump The president has the power to define eligibility for such citizenship. And if he can't do it by executive order congress shoujld pass a law and ban the courts including the supreme court from hearing any challenge to it.
@BillKristol The constitution allows government to define eligibility for such citizenship.
@TobyasStorm @thehill Depends on how you interpret the constitution. Our government has the power to define eligibility.

Life don't work that way. Once they reach the border they should be hit with rubber bullets &amp; tear gas u til they turn and go back
@brianschatz Totally false. All of the replacement bills keep the pre-existing conditions part of obamacare. The president said. Efore taking office that he'd keep that part of the law.

@dbaria The middlemen average got a $1,200-$2,000 tax cut. Not the rich but the middle class. Having an extra $1,200-$2,000 helps the middle class alot. And entitlement reform does not mean cut. Reducing the cost of those programs can be done without cutting benefits.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Obama was also friendly to the Saudis. And they can help us oppose people who are much worse. Our country was friends with stalin because hitler was worse.
@SenSherrodBrown You also fail to mention that the CBO said the government will gain $1.1 Trillion in new revenue from economic growth reducing the tax cut cost to $400 Billion &amp; because less people will need welfare spending will fall by $150 Billion reducing the final cost to only $250 Billion
@SenSherrodBrown There is no plan to cut Medicare or Social Security. There are ways that the cost of those programs can be reduced that don't amount to a cut. But something does have to be done. One of the biggest threats to Medicare and Social Security is the high cost of those programs.

@JimRenacci Please put this in an ad on social media such as YouTube an on the air.

@garrisonfarm1 @EricStacy @JimRenacci It should never have been tied to employment. Subsidies and Health Savings Accounts could be used to untie it from employment that way you can take your policy with you no matter where you work. Having access to every plan in country would lower costs.
@garrisonfarm1 @EricStacy @JimRenacci No they have not. They oppose obamacare but not the pre-existing condition part of it. A replacement for obamacare could include pre-existing condition coverage. The left just cherrypicks that one popular part of it which is not the reasons why they oppose it.

@SenDonnelly In 2002 when the voted to exoell Jim Traficant Ron Paul felt he wasn't treated fairly but was unsure if he may have been corrupt so Ron Paul voted present.
@NotLostCrysyE @SenDonnelly He could always just vote present. He wou ldnt be voting for or against Kavanaugh.
@SenDonnelly With all these people criticizing you for voting no why not just vote present. If you feel he's qualified but aren't satisfied with the investigation you don't have to vote yes or no.
@SherrodBrown You opposed the policies that are helping make the system work for Ohioans. Real Change begins by replacing you with @JimRenacci He will bring real change to Ohio by helping @realDonaldTrump Make America Great Again and Keep America Great! https://t.co/6kRc5RDbQj

@SenDonnelly I hope you can work with President Trump on outsourcing. Requiring every company that outsources pay a $25,000 tax per job they outsource will help. Outsourcing just 1,000 job will equal a $25 Million tax which will discourage outsourcing.
@PoliticsWolf When it comes to the Voting Rights Act one way to fix it is require preclearance for all 50 states that way no state is being targeted. The courts would uphold that.

@RonWyden Denying someone a job for something they didn't do is still wrong either way!
@SenDonnelly If you're not sure how to vote on the Kavanaugh you should just vote present. You don't have to for or against.
@Subversivesrus @SenDonnelly Kavanaugh clearly is not guilty of what he's accused of. Secondly the party that supports killing babies doesn't have standards at all.
@SenDonnelly If your this conflicted over the Kavanaugh vote because of the allegations against him why not just vote present? You don't have to vote for or against him.
@Alyssa_Milano A Republican House approved the last reauthorization even when the law was expanded to cover gay people which has nothing to do with violence against women. And it ought to really just be made permanent so these votes don't have to keep being made.
@EmilyWKennedy @CNN In 2006 he got a well qualified rating since then. But the ABA has a leftwing bias against origionalism. I would have preferred to have Judge Andrew Napolitano anyway. But after the lies against Kavanaugh he deserved to be confirmed.

@Nate_Cohn I'd like to see polls of Minnesota 1st and New Hampshire 1st. Rare GOP pickup opportunities. Also Wisconsin 3rd and Pennsylvania 8th both voted for Trump in 2016. Unlikely to be pickups but could be close.
@Nate_Cohn are you polling the Senate and governor elections as well? Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin are being badly under polled. I suspect the president will be campaigning in those states.
@Nate_Cohn A new poll shows Democratic enthusiasm lead evaporated.
@Nate_Cohn The lastpoll taken had Lewis up by 3. Also while I like what NYT is doing here there are not enough rural and blue collar areas in your sample. One of the reasons I believe polls in 2016 were wrong is because the polls under sampled his voters.

@wjousts @TCFPC @JimRenacci @SenSherrodBrown He initially reported a loss. Such a deduction. Does exist the president used it several times in the 1990s. And in 2016 the Ohio supreme court said the department of revenue was in the wrong.
@RuhRho @HuffPost Also innocent of the false charges against them. Those who make such false charges should be thrown in jail to rot.
@HuffPost Women who falsely accused men of rape shouild be prosecuted just like a rapist would be. Ruining someone's life is wrong and shouldn't be legal. Mutliple Witnesses refute the claims against him. This all a political false attack to try to keep a good man off the court.

@wjousts @TCFPC @JimRenacci @SenSherrodBrown He owns over 60 Businesses &amp; some of them lost money that year. You are allowed to deduct those loses even if you make $14 Million in income that year. The president used this deduction as well. It's not Big Jim's fault for taking the deduction.

@wjousts @TCFPC @JimRenacci Losses are tax deductible if some of just one of his multiple businesses lost money. If you eliminate that deduction the business tax rates could be lower as well as eliminating deductions for advertising and state corporate taxes.
@wjousts @JimRenacci Because of the deductions that are eliminated he likely won't get one but his businesses will pay less.
@DKHiggs_Boson @JimRenacci They will likely still get hundreds off their taxes. Larger families need more money than smaller ones because of the extra cost of food energy clothing and other costs.
@justincarr4ohio @JimRenacci @ohiogop The deductions that were eliminated will keep the very wealthy from getting much of a tax cut. A CEO of a large company would likely not get a tax cut. Only if you include small business owners that file as individuals do high income people get any kind of tax cut.
@jessicaq00 @JimRenacci If you were a business owner planning to hire would you hire in a country with high corporate taxes or low corporate taxes? In the long term having a lower tax on businesses will encourage them to hire here. States with lower business taxes create more jobs than other states.

@ChrisMurphyCT This is fake news. This implies that all of the money went to buybacks which isn't true. While there has been record buybacks there has also been record investment. Business investment increased more than buybacks in the last year.
@SenSchumer The deficit wouldnt be put of control if you werent demanding more domestic spending &amp; threatening to shut down the government if you don't get it. How about doing the opposite &amp; cutting domestic spending. You attacking the GOP for the deficit is the pot calling the kettle black.
@engmark_jill @SenBobCasey Cutting capital gains taxes is good economic policy, and even you disagree with it calling it evil is ridiculous and makes you sound like an idiot.
@KenKep @SenBobCasey Also leasing the mineral rights on federally owned land and lease unneeded government buildings to raise revenue. Also close down unnecessary military bases and lease space to private businesses as well.
@KenKep @SenBobCasey And if the government eliminates wasteful spending which is likely half the Federal budget there will be a big surplus. Eliminate unnecessary programs and cut non defense discretionary spending beck to 2008 levels before Obama increased everything.
@KenKep @SenBobCasey Tax cuts are not spending. Spending more than what you bring in causes a deficit. And when Bill Clinton cut capital gains taxes in 1997 the revenue collected from that tax increased. And if the economy continues growing at 4% revenue will increase.
@SenBobCasey Encouraging investment is good for the economy. Indexing capital gains to inflation is good economic policy. Bill Clinton cut capital gains taxes in 1997. A much bigger cut to that tax then whats being proposed. Knowing that investment taxes are lower encourages people to invest.

@elindburg @trumpgirl87 @SenDonnelly So not all wealthy people got a tax cut. However businesses get a tax cut. And the way some businesses are taxed the business income appears on their personal tax return. Only by counting that business tax cut as a cut for the owner is it said that the wealthy pay less.
@elindburg @trumpgirl87 @SenDonnelly Until 2025. But there is a bill to make this permanent which will prevent a middle class tax increase.

@CenterOnBudget How is preventing a tax increases the same as giving a new tax cut to anyone. And the individual tax cuts goven don't benefit the wealthy at all because of the changes to tax deductions. Deductions used mostly by the wealthy were eliminated.
@4TaxFairness The middle class got a big tax cut under this plan. Starting in 2019 a family of 4 earning $50,000 a year will get a $1,300 tax cut. If they make $75,000 A year they'd get $2,100. And if the tax cuts are not made permanent the middle class wil pay more. Idiots.
@iteptweets Preventing a future tax increase is not a tax cut. Allowing the tax cuts to expire increases taxes on the middle class. One of the reasons the democrats opposed tax reform was because the tax cuts for individuals were temporary.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump And most states that ban abortion would have exceptions for medical purposes. It would only be banned when it's done simply because the mother doesn't want the child. And the only one likely to be penalized wouild be the doctor not the mother.
@TimYoung29 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Ab portion isn't even mentioned in the constitution which would make that issue a states rights issue.
@dpkenter @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Not state is going to outlaw birth control. Although technically brith control isn't actually mentioned in the constitution. But I think if a state banned birth control it would hurt those who do it politically. So it ain't going to happen.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump According to the constitution abortion is a states issue. Abortion isn't mentioned in the constitution. And really what should happen is states should have referendums on the legality of abortion instead of this being decided legislatively. Let then people decide.
@NikkiScaggs @SenJeffMerkley They do support candidates even if your unions dues arent used that way And I generally like some private sector unions but people should have the right to decide whether they want to join. And unions should represent dues paying members only eliminating that problem.

@timkaine In a presidential election year not a midterm year. Scalia and Kagan were both confirmed in midterm years.
@SenSchumer That was in a presidential year. That was never intended for midterm years.
@NikkiScaggs @SenJeffMerkley Forcing someone to support an organization their opposed to violates freedom of association. And the only objection I have to unions is the candidates they support. Other than that I'm fine with unions but nobody should be penalized for not wanting to join one.
@SenSchumer A working American brought the lawsuit. A d forcing someone to join an organization they oppose is unconstitutional.
@JoeNBC Free trade screws American workers. And Mueller is corrupt.
@Dsp503 @SenJeffMerkley Because the unions support candidates some of their members don't support many of those people will not want to join. And compelling membership of an organization violates freedom of association.
@NikkiScaggs @SenJeffMerkley The teacher unions involved in his case dont represent workers who work for business they represent employees of the govenrment. And union membership must be optional under the constitution.
@marieaire @bulzeye11 @SenJeffMerkley Doesn't matter the constitution forbids compelling so done to join an organization they dont support. And if the unions wanted to they could represent dues paying members only during negotiations but they choose not to.
@KOrgeron @SenJeffMerkley Forcing somebody to,pay an organization they don't want to belong to is unconditional. Judges exist to follow thenconsittuion not make law. And if the unions wanted to they could represent dues paying members only during negotiations .
@SenJeffMerkley This lawsuit was brought by a worker. Compelling someone to join an organization against their will violates freedom of association and is clearly unconstitutional. But you wouldn't know about that would you? Suck it!

@hummerrgw @SenDonnelly No one's having their benefits reduced. Restricting eligibility to people who actually need help is good. The government wastes taxpayer money too much.
@Baldwin7166 @SenDonnelly These tariffs help manufacturing. Democrats traditionally oppose unfair trade. Bernie Sanders agrees with Trump on trade. 300,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since Trump took office. The tariffs aren't hurting you their helping you. Made in America helps US workers.
@SenDonnelly That decision says people cannot be penalized for refusing to join a union. Compelling someone to support an organization they object to violates freedom of association. And unions can always negotiate on behalf of dues paying members only eliminating free riders.
@ChrisMurphyCT McConnell set that rule for presidential election years only.
@SenWarren That rule only applies in presidential years. And Garland was a judicial activist who believed in a living constitution. Only originalist judges are qualified to be on the supreme court.
@SenatorDurbin 2016 was a presidentialbyear. 2018 is a midterm year. Not the same thing,
@RonWyden That was a presidential election year not a midterm year. Big Difference!

@JeffFlake We will win the trade war by getting fair trade deals with countries that are ripping us off. In The Art of Deal @realDonaldTrump talks about using leverage. If those countries want the tariffs taken off than they can negotiate a fair deal for both countries.

@ConorLambPA And why not means test social security and Medicare for high income seniors? If the left thinks it's ok the raise taxes on high income Americans than why should they get the same benefits the middle class get. And they should contribute more to those programs while working too.
@ConorLambPA And why are there multiple house g programs? Why not just 1 program like section 8 vouchers to help those who need housing assistance? That's the best housing program the government has. We don't need all the others.
@ConorLambPA And also food stamps is availible for people making up to 130% of the Federal poverty level. Why not 100% if it's meant help people in poverty? Reducing the eligibility to 100% or less would reduce spending.
@ConorLambPA Alit of governemnt spending is wasteful. Not every dollar spent by our government is justified. There is no excuse for the government to spend as much money as it spends. $4 Trillion is ridiculous no matter what the money is being spent on.

@qedigiv @SenBobCasey Those sick people drive up the cost of insurance for people who don't have pre-existing conditions. That's why people with pre-existing conditions should be able to get Medicare which would reduce the cost of private insirance for everyone else.

@toots717 @Cybelline @Alyssa_Milano @TinaCrivelli @ASlavitt Offering people a chance to buy insurance they can afford helps people who suffer from high prices.

@toots717 @Alyssa_Milano @TinaCrivelli @ASlavitt It was failing before Trump became president. Insurance companies shoulld be required to compete in all 50 states and pre-existing conditions should be covered by Medicare instead of private insurance that way private insurance premiums would fall.
@Alyssa_Milano @ASlavitt People with pre-existing conditions should be able to buy in to Medicare. And that would reduce premiums for people that don't have pre-existing conditions. And then require insurance compete in all 50 states and provide the same subsidies federal employees receive.

@seriouslywtaf @cellkell @SenJeffMerkley I don't hate immigrants but they should come here legally. Asylum fraud is not the way to come here. Immigration laws should benefit America.

@Taniel And offering the same subsidies federal employees get would be better than the obamacare subsidies. Also having an exchange that operates similar to the Federal employee system would allow more plans to choose from and increase competition.

@Barlow4Congress Having a healthcare system similar to what federal employees have would provide private insurance to everyone. That should have bipartisan support.

@gs314 @secret08 @SenDonnelly And prices don't have to rise if the government would have better monetary policy the value of the dollar would increase and reduce prices.
@gs314 @secret08 @SenDonnelly If the dol,arthritis amou he are higher that's not really a cut. And Paul Ryan isnt president. The president will sign or veto whatever he wants. And those programs could be means tested so that only the people that need those programs get the most help from them.
@BillyTwy @SenDonnelly @SenateDems And a lot of money can be saved in those programs without affecting people that truly need those programs. Means testing those programs so the rich don't get as big a benefit would only affect people that don't need the programs as much.
@BillyTwy @SenDonnelly @SenateDems He's not cutting those programs. He said he supported eliminating waste in those programs which isnt a real cut. Medicaid spending goes up still which isnt a cut at all. And the retirement part of social security isn't being effected at all.
@tonym79 @SenDonnelly @SenateDems It's $150 billion in one year and if revenue doesn't go back up they count revenue staying the same as a loss over 10 years. Spending is what really adds to the debt. If they would just spend no more than they take in there wouldn't be a deficit.
@tonym79 @SenDonnelly @SenateDems That was projected to be over 10 years and didn't take GDP growth into account. And really their counting a 9ne year deficit increase and multiplying it by 10 to get to that number. Their counting revenue staying the same as a loss which shouldn't be done
@secret08 @SenDonnelly @gs314 Also all non defense discretionary programs that aren't eliminated should be cut to 2008 pre Obama spending levels and cut 2% a year from there until the budget is balanced. Also  on defense spending closing down unnessicarry bases and leasing space could bring in revenue.
@secret08 @SenDonnelly @gs314 No proposals have been made to cut those programs. Increasing them by a smaller amount is not really a cut. If the dollar amounts are higher those programs are still being increased.
@SenDonnelly With enough economic growth it will likely come in under budget. The purpose of tax reform is to balance the budget by producing growth &amp; using the extra revenue to balance the budget. Also with less people needing welfare programs because of higher incomes spending will go down.
@SenDonnelly You could means test those programs so higher income seniors don't get as much of a benefit. And the social security age is expected to rise to 67 in the next decade. Having the Medicare age rise too would make sense. But most Americans wouldn't support privatization.

@GOPChairwoman @DebbieLesko @realDonaldTrump The left is gonna be quick to talk about her underperforming but if you look at how low the turnout was compared to what it would be in November that can explain why.

If you have the right civil rights and economic policies you can win them over. Plus bringing blue collar voters back to your party.
@SenDonnelly @TheLugarCenter Even though I'm a Trump supporter I would love to see you run in 2024. GOP will likely nominate another establishment candidate once Trump is out of office.

@StorminSpartin If social security weren't taxed you'd get a bigger raise. Another tax bill could make that change.
@StorminSpartin That 83% number is including small businesses that file as individuals on the owners personal income tax. The owners of those businesses are not the top 1%. Only because of their business income are they being included. A more accurate number would not show that.
@DrRev_Mustafa1 @RandPaul Opposing gay marriage doesn't make you a bigot. It's a commonly held conservative belief. Differences of opinion are bigotry.

@StorminSpartin That full tax cut takes effect next year when a bigger tax cut for individuals takes effect. The doubling of the child tax credit gives a big tax cut to middle class families if you do some research you'll see that what I'm saying is accurate.
@StorminSpartin Thats not true. If the rich cant use as many deduction theyre tax rate doesnt go down as much. And that is likely including tax cuts for businesses which are not tax cuts for rich people and shouldn't be included in that number. Many small business pay as individuals.

@Gov451 @ChrisCoons @SenatorCarper @POTUS In Canada bureaucrats decide what the Canadian system is willing to pay for based on statistics and data instead of what patients actually need. And the percentage of people waiting 4 months to see a specialist if much higher there than here.
@ChrisCoons @SenatorCarper @POTUS They arent junk plans. Just because they dont cover thjngs some people dont need doesnt them junk. People should only pay for what they need not what some bureaucrat thinks they should have. Those who need plans that cover more can still get them.
@RonWyden It's been less than a year. That don't happen overnight. Next year the kiddle class ar egetging a large tax cut. $1,200 for a family of 4. And the rich dwon't be able to use as many deductions so they won't be able to lower their taxes as much.
@GOPChairwoman you should create a tax cut calculator for the national GOP website so people could see how big their tax cut will be next year when it takes full effect.
@StorminSpartin A bigger tax cut is coming next year when it takes full effect. A family of 4 earning $50,000 now gets a refund instead of using taxes. A family of 4 earning $60,000 gets a $1,200 tax cut and if they make $75,000 a year they get $2,000.

@realDonaldTrump It also spends too much. There needs to be cuts and a balanced budget.
@realDonaldTrump We need to balance the budget. As a business man you should know how to spend money wisely. It's time you ran the government like a business. If a business spent money this recklessly they go out of business. We elected you to use your business skills to improve the country.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It also adds to the debt. We need to start balancing the budget which requires massive cuts.
@marcorubio What about spending cuts? I didnt know you were a big spender. Spending too much is just as bad when the GOP do it. Trump ran on lowering the debt and balancing the budget. It's time to get that done.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Because of how good the candidates are in PA OH and WI I think they'd win. MI And MN will be a bigger challange. IN has a really good Dem that will likely keep his seat. Donnelly is one of the few dems I'd actually vote for.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Senior citizens do vote a lot in midterms as well. But Trump needs to win the support of College whites. Doing something about student loan debt will help. College educated people are the only ones who have student debt so that specifically helps them.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict I live in Ohio and i believe Jim Renacci to win here. Lou Barletta should do well in PA. Rick Scott is popular in Florida. And GOP does have good candidates in Wisconsin and North Dakota. And the Midwest if more favorable to Trump than many other parts of the country.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Trumps supporters have been the voters turning out in midterms that's why GOP did well in 2010 &amp; 2014. I expect GOP to not do as well this year. But Im not sure its going to be a wave. I expect dems to win the National house vote but that won't be enough to win the house.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Also I predict the GOP will win 8 seats in the Senate and lose the 1 in Nevada. My prediction is Manchin will hold on and likely Donnelly the other 8 Trump state dems lose. Dems come close in Arizona but come up just short.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict And if the GOP flips 7 seats they would then need 30 seats to win back control not just 23. My prediction is dems pickup 22 seats and the GOP picks up 7 which would reduce GOP majority to 225 GOP to 210 Dem. The dems would win seats but would fall 8 votes short.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Trumps approval ratings have risen slightly. And he may still be popular with the people that voted for him. After all he only got 46% of the National vote. And the generic ballot has tightened a bit. I do expect the GOP to lose seats but not enough to win back control.

@Ferric242 @Redistrict And the GOP has great candidates running in Wisconsin's 3rd district and Pennsylvania 17. They also have great candidates in New Hampshire and Lamb will likely run in a now less Republican district with the current district becoming less democratic.
@Ferric242 @Redistrict Conor Lamb ran a better campaign and agreed with trump on some issues. His win isnt anti-trump win. And that district would voted for a democrat in the presidential elections betwwen 1976-1996. Bob Casey won that district in 2006.	So it's still a historically GOP district.

@Redistrict GOP has a chance to win a seat in Arizona, 2 seats in Nevada, 2 seats in Minnesota, 1 seat in Wisconsin, 2 seats in Pennsylvania, and 2 seats in New Hampshire. More than enough to offset losses elsewhere. Plus they could pickup 7 or 8 seats into Senate.

@CNN Lie detector tests aren't even admissible  in court. And I'm not buying this. Melania is too hot to cheat on so I highly doubt he did it.

@DocRockne @SenDonnelly It's none of the governments business if someone wants to use a medication that's not approved. Government needs to stay out of people's lives as long as they don't harm others. People who are desperate to live will do what it takes to live.
@jones7955 @sainttoad @JeffFlake @AlanDersh a liberal Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton has said this.
@jones7955 @sainttoad @JeffFlake The president has the power to end any investigation he wants. It's is not obstruction for the president to exercise his constitutional authority. The president can commit obstruction by destroying evidence or ordering the people working for him to lie the government.
@sainttoad @JeffFlake He can only be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Try reading the constitution.

@PattyMurray The only experts on guns are those who defend our right to own them and even use against our country if such a need ever arose.
@sainttoad @JeffFlake What i said is true. The preesident ca tbe impeached for exercjsing his constitutional authority. You just don't like the truth cuck.
@sahilkapur Trump can fire Mueller. It would not be an impeachable offense for the president to exercise his constitutional authority not only fire mueller but throw hillary clinton andrew mccabe and comey in jail. And if sessions won't prosecute them fire him and find someone who will
@sainttoad @JeffFlake There is nothing in the constitution about special counsels. The president has the constitutional authority to fire Mueller. It would completely legal do do it. It's already been proven there is no collusion. No need to continue the investigation.
@JeffFlake What is the crisis. The president has the constitutional authority to fire anyone that's under him. That's a fact. There is no law being broken by the president doing that. And it's been proven there was no collusion. No need for a special consul. Eisenstein should be fired too,
@JeffLane22 I hope he domestic down in the ring so he won't get hurt.
@JeffLane22 @ryansatin I tweeted @PodcastOne And told them if they kick you and Vince off the air ill tell everyone on social media not to have anything to do with Podcastone anymore. If satin wants a fight he'll get one.
@shelleylubben I watched a video about your testimony. I have been a believer for years but porn addiction bled into my life as a christian recently begun the difficult fight of overcoming this destructive addiction. I love the fact that youre exposing this evil industry.

@MisterAleem @DelainoTom @BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA Absolutely not. Many men would give their left leg for a chance at her.
@PodcastOne You better not cancel @THEVinceRusso and @JeffLane22. I'll tell everyone on here not to have anything to do you company. 2 can play at that game. If Russos enemies want a fight it's s fight they'll get.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA Never said that.
@Copperr1 @BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA You need your eyes checked. She is hottest chick on the planet.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA Women lie about this a lot. And maybe she was lying to try and get money.
@MisterAleem @Copperr1 @BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA All from the lugenpresse.
@BigPlasticRobot Yes that's what I said.
@BigPlasticRobot @MisterAleem @SscottSsmith84 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA He thought about running in the 2012 election too. And she may still be getting paid to make false allegations. Women do this a lot. The duke lacrosse case is a perfect example along with twanna Brawley. And all the false accusations  against Roy Moore.
@THEVinceRusso @ryansatin @PodcastOne As important as podcast one is. I'll always be a Relm subscriber.

@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA The woman from his tv show has a history of making false allegations. Her brother confirmed this on tv during the election. And most of the women were paid to make false allegations. Allreds daughter was caught doing that.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA Now that's he's found the perfect wife there's is no improving on perfection. With a wife that's looks this good there is no reason he ever consider cheating. https://t.co/Sj146ejc9a
@BigPlasticRobot @MisterAleem @SscottSsmith84 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA Not just hot but hotter. He would be lowering himself to have an affair with Stormy Daniels. No matter how hot stormy is she's no Melania. No man would ever choose stormy over Melania.
@WWEGable WWE likely believes he'd take more risks wrestling outside of WWE and would be less likely to hurt himself staying with them. Hopefully Daniel Bryan tones down his style instead of pleasing Meltzer and the marks.
@SenatorDurbin They're power grid was completely destroyed. It takes time for that to be fixed. Trump and GOP have done more than enough.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA And why would Trump bang Stormy Daniels when his wife is hotter. Stormy may be hot but she isn't as hot as Melania. If I had the choice between banging Melania or Stormy I'd pick Melania every time. And so would Trump. Melania is probably the sex trumps ever had.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA She made a false allegation that Trumps lawyer wanted to keep from getting out, The fact that he paid her doesn't mean the allegation isn't false. The lawyer shouldn't have paid her because it makes the false allegation look true but it's still false
@MisterAleem @BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA I have more sense and logic in pinky then you have in your whole body.
@BigPlasticRobot @SscottSsmith84 @MisterAleem @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @KimReynoldsIA He never said he did it. He said he could do it. Big difference. And the stormy Daniels thing didn't happen. Melania is hotter than stormy. You can't improve upon perfection. And I didn't vote for a pastor I voted for a president.

@rebeccabguinn @DSchwertfege @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Many in the GOP say they care about spending when running but they do nothing once they gain power. The democrats do the same.
@rebeccabguinn @DSchwertfege @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin They also ration healthcare to do it. There are better ways to reduce those cost than rationing.
@rebeccabguinn @DSchwertfege @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Capping deductions for the wealthy makes sense. Trump ran on that in 2016 but the GOP in Congress didn't agree to it. And there is a loophole that allows some investers to pay less than other wealthy people making the same amount. The Congress wouldnt agree to eliminate it.
@rebeccabguinn @DSchwertfege @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin I was off for little bit. Wait times at emergency rooms and wait times to see doctors are longer and they use old medications instead of the newest ones. So it has its disadvantages.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin My idea would be slightly different and likely better the obamacare and would cover almost everyone without incompetent government running the system.
@DSchwertfege @rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin The middle class amount have their taxes raised. Higher income Americans can afford a higher rate the middle class can not,
@THEVinceRusso Shame he isnt doing this the full 3 hours. And one thing I do want to see is Reigns return and attack Brock later in the show. The writers probably too incompetent to write that.
@rebeccabguinn @DSchwertfege @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin For Social Security  there's a cap. Medicare has 1 rate for everyone but the rate is too low on higher income americans
@DSchwertfege @rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin im taking about a higher tax rate. 1.45% for middle class and a higher rate for wealthier Americans along with higher ou of pocket for wealthy recipients and a retirement age equal to the social security age,

@DSchwertfege @rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Im talking about higher rates when income rises like what we do with the income tax. Once someone reaches 250k a year the rate goes. Not the cap that was lifted.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin There countries that have made private insurance work. In Switzerland 99.5% of the country is covered.
@LTCCEO911 @PoliticsWolf @AlanDersh He didn't vote for Trump. What he says is legally accurate. If those who oppose Trump want him out of office they need to try in 2020.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Monetary policy does play a role in prices lower prices would help many poor people by making products more affordable. And they could index the minimum wage so it can increase automatically if need be. They do that in Ohio where to minimum wage is $8.30
@CptSeaMonkey @alllibertynews @GOP @DNC @LPNational @catoletters GOD would forgive this man if he sought it. Jesus dies on the cross for even the worst of people.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Returning to the gold standard lime Ron Paul supports could rescue inflation enough that $7.25 and hour could be a reasonable wage. $7.25 used to be a good wage when inflation was much lower.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin And reducing inflation would reduce the cost of food and housing. The government could still help those in need but they could spend less money doing it,
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin The states could do some of that. I would support school lunches at the state level which would save the federal government money. I had a free in school and would have gotten it had the state paid for it too. And those who make enough not to need help shouldn't get it.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Creating a healthcare system based on the federal employees system would work. The plans would be private but subsided in way everyone could afford. And there would be more plans to choose from and real competition. Everyone's covered without government control of the system.
@JeffLane22 they should have reigns return from the hospital and attack Leaner later in the show. But I doubt the writers are competent to do it.
@SenSanders And the left take billions of dollars from the entertainment industry which looks down on middle class americans. They think that fact they're famous makes them better than everyone else.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin And also requiring people to make less than the federal poverty level to get welfare programs. Those programs are for poverty. So people earning above the poverty level shouldn't get them.
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Also closing down unneeded bases placing military members families on private insurance and educated military members children in local school Instead of on bases. And eliminating unnessicarry discretionary programs. And cutting the ones left 2% per year from 2008 spending levels
@rebeccabguinn @DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin Raising the tax cap for social security and higher rates for the Medicare taxes could happen but the retirement age needs to raised slightly and out of pocket costs in Medicare for wealthy recipients who can afford it. Also reducing prescription drug prices for medicare/medicaid.
@SemGeek @Reuters @brainspark2018 He's not talking about users. He is referring to big drug traffickers who sell deadly heroin and fentanyl that result in massive overdoses.

@PoliticsWolf @commoncauseny Ending gerrymandering should never be about either party gaining or losing seats. Ending gerrymandering should give parties a shot at winning seat through competitive races and force most incumbents to have to earn their seats.
@PoliticsWolf According to @AlanDersh Cynthia Nixon is anti-Israel. And how is New York Gerrymandered? Dems picked up seats in 2012 after redistricting.
@DavidLudwig8 @SenatorDurbin @rebeccabguinn And there needs to be large spending cuts to balance the budget. Both parties in Congress need stop spending too much money. Over half the federal budget is wasteful spending.

Money should be used to lower taxes on American Production. Along with taxes that penalize US companies that Outsource US jobs.

@reneprovencher7 @SenatorRounds @SenAngusKing Automatic weapons are already illegal.
@SenSanders Also changing the way doctors are reimbursed for Medicare to save money is not the same as cutting Medicare.
@SenSanders The budget changes the disability programs. When Trump said no cuts to social security he was referring the the retirementportion of social security.
@SenSchumer And our wonderful President would agree to let them stay and become citizens if you would would only agree to get rid of the disgusting visa lottery system and the despicable chain migration. But your rather have unlimited minorities pour into our country so you could get votes.
@jeschroeder14 @MorozMichael @Kl1619 @ChristianOncMom @guypbenson The guns our soldiers use in combat are not sold on the streets legally. Rapid fire weapons like the ones our soldiers use are already illegal. Assault rifles sold legally are modified for civilian use and are not the same as the assault rifles soldiers use.
@guypbenson The deep state may have been behind this. Also there could be connections to antifa. The deep state wants to take our guns and they don't care that our president supports our 2nd Amendment.
@janedmunds @SenBlumenthal More guns will help. A shooter can't shoot anyone if the shooter is shot. Freedom is what he,ps this situation not tyrannical gun confiscation like Hitler and Stalin did the seize power.
@RepDianeBlack I want to know if the deep state did this to undermine our presidents support for the 2nd Amendment. Antifa may have played a role in this just like in Vegas.
@RepDianeBlack @AnjiUsa Also we should increase the use of mental institutions for the dangerously mentally ill. Something the douchebags at the aclu complain about.
@Jerseypin @RepDianeBlack Yes take action like eliminating gun free zones and expanding concealed carry so someone could have shot the shooter. Much better than what the anti-gun cucks want.
@RedState The anti Trump deep state may have staged this shooting with help from antics and Isis and the funding of Soros and the new world order elites,
@DaveHops @will032686 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Our drugs come here across the Mexican border and illegals of any race could be used to build the wall.

@Bencjacobs Could be a false flag done by the anti-gun element in the deep state opposing our own presidents love for our 2nd amendment. Could be a Muslim an illegal or antifa.

@AndyHort1 @danpfeiffer If someone is wealthy and pays millions in state in local taxes and they can only deduct $10,000 they won't be getting a tax cut.
@danpfeiffer And this plan stops overpaying hospitals doctors and drug companies in order to save money.
@danpfeiffer There were no tax cuts for the wealthy they lose their deductions and reducing the cost of Medicare is not the same as cutting it.
@sardonic1024 @thehill Those benefits are bankrupting our country.
@thehill What does that commie Bernie Sanders know about good economic policy. Central planned failed in the Soviet Union and it would surely fail here. Our government spends way too much money and needs to be reduced.
@SenSchumer The govenrment spends too much money. Spending needs to be cut even more than whats the president is proposing. Our government is addicted to spending.

@SenSchumer Spending needs to be cut not increases. Domestic discretionary spending should be reduced to 2008 spending levels and cut more from there. Unnecessary programs should eliminated some should be privatized. Medicare and social security should be means tested.
@caittttO @realDonaldTrump Increasing Medicare out of pocket costs for wealthier seniors that can afford it and raising the Medicare age could reduce Medicare spending without hurting seniors. And domestic discretionary spending should be reduced to 2008 spending levels and cut from there.
@caittttO @realDonaldTrump This bill increases domestic spending and increases the $20 trillion national debt. Trump can do better than this. Spending has to be cut.
@realDonaldTrump @JasonMillerinDC There needs to be some spending cuts. Domestic spending should be cut not increased. Something must be done about the $20 Trillion debt. Using reconciliation would allow big spending cuts.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci https://t.co/3jPcPG09uT watch this stossel video and you'll see privatization does work
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci Canada uses private air traffic controllers and has success with it. Also the San Francisco Airport uses private security and they perform better than the government and the lines are shorter.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci And not everyone who disagrees with you politically is a bot. I'm a real person who lives in Northeast Ohio. I'm 27 years old.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci How would have keeping tax rates the same in 2011 have added to the debt. Non increasing revenue is not the same as a decrease in revenue. And revenue between 2003 and 2007 went up. Had it not been for the financial crises revenue would have kept going up.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci Plus the Social Security age is set to increase to 67. The Medicare age should be the same.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci You could also privatize the FAA, TSA, the Army Corp of Engineers, The Agricultural Research Service, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and FEMA. Eliminate discretionary programs we don't need. Reduce other non defense Secretary spending to 2008 spending levels.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci Some welfare programs have eligibility levels way above the federal poverty level. Reducing eligibility levels to 100% of the poverty level can be done. Charging higher income seniors more out of pocket for Medicare would help as well.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci Those scores were inaccurate. A fair score would show this increasing revenue. The Bush tax cuts increased revenue as well. The deficit in 2004 was $400 Billion in 2007 it was $160 Billion. The deficit went down and revenue went up.
@974_millionlate @RepJimRenacci Economic growth from the tax cut will increase revenue and when combined with spending cuts will help pay off the national debt. Domestic spending needs to be cut big.

@ToddCMatthy @THEVinceRusso That's why you wanted to watch. But he obviously woudnt have. But that episode beat Nitro in the ratings. That's the kind of writing WWE needs today. Unpredictability major storyline advancement every week must see TV.
@THEVinceRusso @ToddCMatthy The show is way to predictable. I never got to watch every attitude era show but since I've been following you I've rewatched them and even a "bad" episode then is 10x better than a great episode today. If i were a writer id try to create shows like that.
@ToddCMatthy @THEVinceRusso When Austin called Vince backstage and threatened him then that raw episode went to a commercial and then Austin took him hostage at gunpoint. That was a cliffhanger. You wouldn't change the channels because you wanted to see what Austin would do to Vince.
@ToddCMatthy @THEVinceRusso And on Cable the matches shouldn't be so long that there has to be a commercial in the middle of it. Longer matches should be saved for the PPV. As long as they take the required number of breaks the matches could be at least 5-6 mins. With the main being at least 15 min.
@ToddCMatthy @THEVinceRusso Yes but there should have been a better reason for Sasha and Asuka to have a match. At least the Strowman Kane match was part of a feud. And the Elimination Chamber qualifying matches &amp; the tag title and IC title matches had stakes.
@THEVinceRusso @ToddCMatthy Matches exist to advance storylines. Matches just for sake of matches is boring. Matches that advance a storyline are more entertaining. Lime the match between The Rock and Mick Foley at the 1998 Survivor Series. A real 5 star match. Better than anything in New Japan.
@ToddCMatthy @THEVinceRusso No storyline whatsoever. Just 2 wrestlers having a match just for the sake of having one. What's the point of having a match that doesn't advance a story? In the past all matches served a purpose.
@Namedropper5000 @THEVinceRusso He watches in over to review it on his podcast. He is staying his opinion on the show. That's what he's paid for. And he is right this show has been boring. Only good thing was what showman did to Kane. That should have been the main event.

@WWEUniverse @IAmEliasWWE I'm sick of not being able to see the whole match. In the attitude era there were rarely commercials during the matches. As long as you take the required number of breaks they can be taken anytime in the show. I shouldnt have to attend live to see everything.
@WWE @RealKurtAngle @BraunStrowman That Asuka Sasha Banks match has absolutely no story line behind it. Just 2 wrestlers having a match. How boring. Where's the male soap opera element. That's what makes wrestling good not appealing to the hardcore marks that will watch the show no matter what.

@mackeysdaughter @kimbudant @SenSchumer Not the same and that's not the government's decision to make. If insurance were affordable more people would buy. But punishing people for not buying what they can't afford is un-American.
@SenSchumer Also stop requiring insurers to over charge the young and healthy &amp; increase subsidies to accuount for  older &amp; less healthy. Medicare/Medicaid should receive the same 24% discount from the drug companies that the VA receives &amp; require the hospitals provide the same 24% discount.

@brian_daines @SenSanders They don't try to repeal it because people once they become accustomed to getting something for free they don't want to lose it. However wait times are shorter when bureaucrats are controlling the system. There ways to guarantee everyone who wants insurance has it.

@trumplove63 @Sen_JoeManchin @chucktodd @MeetThePress I understand but i do prefer they be permanent now so they don't have to be renewed. However this is still a good bill as far as I see it.

Cutting an increase is not a cut &amp; if nothing is done about social security the program could become so expensive the government can't afford it anymore. Means testing can be done.

@humanvisionary @SenSchumer The 33% rate goes to 32% the 28% rate goes to 24% the 25% rate goes to 22% and the 15% rate goes to 12%. A family of 4 making $75,000 a year pays $2,119 less.
@humanvisionary @SenSchumer Middle class rates are lowered more than the top rates are. And the individual tax cuts will be made permanent I  the next year or 2. And if dems vote no on making them permanent they'd be the ones voting to raise taxes and they would be hurt by it politically.
@SenSchumer As long as the tax cuts are made permanent the middle class are getting a tax increase. The tax foundations analysis which you conviently never mention shows a big tax cut for the middle class. You are a lying douchebag.

@ingramjr @nytimes @hfairfield Having a corporate rate too high discourages job creation. A more competitive rate incentivize job creation. Even if the immediate savings don't go directly to jobs new jobs will still be created. Creating the conditions for jobs will lead to them.
@ingramjr @nytimes @hfairfield The people who oppose it will see the truth when they benefit from this tax plan. They will be like Neo in the Matrix when he took the red pill.
@ingramjr @dhart2001 @nytimes @hfairfield He was referring to me as delusional.
@ingramjr @nytimes @hfairfield And by keeping some of the deductions the final plan keeps itemized will be better protected.
@ingramjr @nytimes @hfairfield A family of 4 earning $75,000 a year will get a $2,000 tax cut. And if a law making the cuts permanent is passed they'll get to keep those tax cuts.

@RonWyden The top tax rate on this bill is 2% higher than a tax reform proposal you made years ago. And you proposed eliminating many deductions. And the Bush tax cuts were not permanent and nobody said Bush was raising middle class taxes.
