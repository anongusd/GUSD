@GOP Wow what idiots would have hired him to be their deputy finance chair?
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker A patient can always lie to a Dr, but the point is that a law gagging Dr's makes absolutely NO common sense, leading many to believe common sense gun safety is not the GOP's priority but rather NRA $$$. But I think we can agree that current laws should also be better enforced.
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker Why should the onus be on a patient to volunteer info that a doctor should legally be able to ask them about in order to do their job properly? The law wouldn't require dr's to ask, it would simply allow them to. Can you honestly give a reason why anyone would be against that?
@RepJasonSmith If you're so concerned about safeguarding suicidal people from guns, why does your party support preventing doctors from being able to ask patients if they own guns? That NRA $$$ is good isn't it?
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker You don't have to give it to a family member to remove it from your home. There are many, many other options. Simply having a family member put it in a locked box that you don't know the combination to, for instance.
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker By allowing them to advise a patient or their family members to remove guns from their home would be a good start. Similarly, what good does preventing them from asking the question do?
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker What good would it do to prevent them from being able to ask this? Yet we have politicians advocating for just that.
@el_chele_gordo @RepSmucker Allow a doctor or psychiatrist to fully understand the danger that a depressed or suicidal patient might be in and advise accordingly.
@RepSmucker Then why does your party support preventing doctors from being able to ask patients if they own guns?
@RepSmucker Imagine you were suicidal and an NRA-financed political party tried to prevent doctors from being able to ask you if you own firearms. Wait we don't have to imagine that one. https://t.co/w03Mxegrh8
@RepSmucker Good.
@RepMarkMeadows Who do you suggest is called as a witness instead, since everyone who knows Trump best has turned out to be a liar and a criminal?
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I can honestly HRC but also a paper bag would have been 1000x better. Trump disgusts me in every way from the serial lying to narcissism to criminal friends to the way he talks about women to cheating on his wife with a porn star to his childish behavior. She was none of that.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Don't worry I don't. Just wonder how you and many others square your religion with defending a serial adulterer &amp; liar who surrounds himself with criminals. I would love to see any Christian admit that they're willing to overlook this for the political power, but don't expect it.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I will always find it odd how fiercely self-proclaimed Christians continue to defend this atrociously amoral man. But you do you.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Whatever you believe about that the fact remains that that money was never in Congressional possession or included in the budget that they *should* have control over, unlike the money Trump is dictatorially repossessing via "national emergency."
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump That money was never in Congress's control to designate in the first place, so not even a remotely similar situation. It had primarily been held in commercial banks overseas, untouched for nearly 40 years.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump With the very major difference being a national emergency bypasses Congress's "power of the purse" function by stealing funds from other areas they've otherwise designated, effectively ruling Congress's constitutionally given power obsolete in that regard.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Executive orders and declaring a national emergency are very very different things. Trump has also issued many EO's and there wasn't a big stink. Try again.
@JerryKeirns @AlecA82475839 @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Their sales are banned in select states who have chosen to do so, such as Massachusetts following Sandy Hook. Obviously not all states have done this. Also I told you this - the same parameters that were used in the 1994. It's more complicated than a tweet but you can look it up.
@AlecA82475839 @JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Appeals courts have already agreed that assault weapons bans are okay which is why the SCOTUS isn't even hearing cases on this matter specifically.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This is the first time a president has used a national emergency to get around a Congress who won't do what he wants. When the next president bans assault weapons under this precedent I'll be sure to revisit this tweet just to tell you to get over it.
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Look up the assault weapons ban of 1994 and therein lies your answer. They are not protected by 2A - their sale &amp; manufacture was banned by law for 10 years.
@RepMarkWalker Universal background checks - the primary goal of this legislation - are supported by 97% of the American people. How much is the NRA paying you?
@JerryKeirns @SquidDespair @CongressmanHice @POTUS @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump They could absolutely ban assault weapon sales and I hope they do. The precedent has been set, and the time will come when the GOP has to live with the consequences.
@RepMarkWalker @StopBigMoney Most Orange County ballots were for Dem candidates because most people in Reagan country are voting Dem now. You can thank your boy Trump for that.
@StonyRushing @McCreadyForNC's push against the election fraud your party committed is the reason you now get to run for Congress, so this is a weird way to thank him. But do you.
@tonyposnanski @JeffFlake @jamesmcnamara27 You forgot about the time he made the Senate wait a week before confirming a credibly accused sexual assaulter to SCOTUS.
@KathieKuchta @NBCNews He is not wrong. This is only happening because Trump apparently knows nothing about it. https://t.co/6ko2Zv0zkG
@Rabbitstick1 @Adamlyon25 @MomsDemand A 2017 Harvard study found that 22% of gun owners and 13% of gun purchasers never went through a background check before obtaining their most recent firearm. Universal background checks are not federal law and any criminal can legally get a gun through a private seller or gifter.

@RepMarkWalker @SenatorDurbin Honest question. Does your party have an alternative plan to combat climate change, or will y'all go to your graves claiming it's a Chinese hoax?
@holybullies @AGStover @JuliaAngelenPR @NBCNews It sounds like there may still be some gray area here on a state by state basis, but the EEOC website currently says it's illegal to not hire or fire someone based on their sexual orientation. https://t.co/BxuotTjR1h
@AGStover @holybullies @JuliaAngelenPR @NBCNews It is already illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job applicant because of their race or sexual orientation.
@RoobleMelvin @NBCNews Truly baffled as to how you read the article and came away with that. We don’t even do that in America or most Republicans would be in jail.
@AGStover @JuliaAngelenPR @NBCNews I never said we should do that but ok. Was literally just answering your question.
@Naumovich @NBCNews @POTUS You do realize he told one of the letters in LBGTQ that they are no longer allowed to serve in the military, right?
@AGStover @JuliaAngelenPR @NBCNews The party that currently holds the most political power in America is anti-gay marriage and supports private companies being able to discriminate against gay people under guise of "religious freedom."
@RoobleMelvin @NBCNews How do you think that's what's happening? The GOP doesn't even support same sex marriage in America. Not to mention the article which you clearly didn't read says the campaign is "narrowly focused on criminalization rather than broader LGBT issues like same-sex marriage."
@Adamlyon25 @MomsDemand Or we could start with the baby step of stopping criminals from buying guns legally
@karenjocole @realDonaldTrump @NeilWMcCabe2 Yet the only people going to jail are Trump's campaign manager, personal lawyer, national security advisor, BFF... I'm sensing a pattern.		You got conned, Karen. Trump isn't getting anyone locked up. Except increasingly his entire campaign staff.
@Woodcat0214 @joshua_gower @LindseyGrahamSC @BetoORourke STOP THE PRESSES and someone alert the New York Times, Captain Obvious is here to inform us all that Democrats were racist bigoted misogynists 100-200 years ago!!! Congratulations Cathy on being the first one to inform the public of basic American history!
@GOPLeader “There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump. Swear to God.”	-You, June 2016		Some patriot you are.
@ColtonC81118846 @CSinsenos @JohnHookfox10 The point is that an election is essentially a giant nationwide poll that Hillary won 48%-46%. Obviously she’s not president because votes don’t get you directly elected in this country.
@shandy_fifi @ColtonC81118846 @JohnHookfox10 And he didn’t beat Hillary by vote count, which is what a poll is.
@RepMarkWalker @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yet you seem disturbingly unconcerned with the number of people surrounding Trump who turned out to be actual criminals.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Weird that 10 million more Americans voted for Democrats than Republicans in the midterms then.
@JohnCornyn If you have to keep making the argument that what he did wasn’t super unconstitutional, you’re losing.

@JoeLoe3 @CLewandowski_ Kinda hard to indict someone for something that’s not a crime. The closest crime to “collusion” is conspiracy against the United States which would ya look at that - Manafort has pled guilty to!

@akmattos Honeymoon (2014). Definitely.
@PTT4579 @RepMarkWalker @POTUS Lol guess again. https://t.co/JKIX4hhqYO
@RepMarkWalker @POTUS Congress' job is to serve the American people, who resoundingly opposed the stupid vanity wall after Trump made it your party's central midterms campaign issue. Party over country once again. Disgusting. https://t.co/5e4OxST187
@ChiStockLawPro @Bakari_Sellers @ErickFernandez I think the issue here is that NYC has a much bigger problem with skyrocketing rent costs than unemployment. SC has the opposite problem. No one is against more jobs but bring them to places that will solve more problems than they create.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JeffBezos Careful cozying up to Bezos Lindsey, you might find yourself getting blackmailed by Trump's favorite legally imperiled media company next.
@swinches1 @RepMarkWalker ...wait what is my religion?
@southey @ncrufan @RepMarkWalker And would you check out that expert level gerrymander. https://t.co/nA6OWyZMlh
@RepMarkWalker Was I dreaming or did your party pass a massive tax cut for the rich and corporations about a year and 2 months ago?
@ALReporter @RepMoBrooks The GOP would credit Trump with the sky being blue if you asked them. This is not news.
@anderandlob04 @RepMarkWalker And you are in the minority my guy.
@RepMarkWalker Remind us what your party’s proposal is Mark? To be the only global power to claim the scientists are all lying and climate change isn’t real? In case anyone was wondering why the GOP is hemorrhaging young people. We’ll take over what your party has destroyed soon.
@SueKin16 @missmayn Yep. The show is great if you haven’t seen it. Just before this last episode they did a couple on Clearwater and how scientologists have bought all this property there with their tax-free money and essentially taken the town over. It’s horrible.
@SueKin16 @missmayn Last week's episode of Leah Remini's show focuses on their taxation status and it is WILD. The leaders literally harassed, stalked, and disparaged individual IRS workers in newspaper ads until the IRS finally just said fuck it and gave them exemption in 1993.
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Hahaha so you can't. How embarrassing for you to get called out like that. Sorry, can't take anyone's perspective seriously when they clearly have a penchant for making shit up. Thank u, next.
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Dare you to cite your source for this “fact.”
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Sure since you were proven to be embarrassingly incorrect on our last topic. We could start with a scenario where illegal border crossings weren't at their lowest point in 45 years. Trump manufactured this crisis so he could throw red meat at his base and you're eating it up. https://t.co/ymW4SyVJDJ
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Trump is not even close to 52% approval, as my chart just displayed to you. His disapprovals are higher than Nancy's. These are facts.
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Hahaha try again my dude, using real numbers this time.  Nancy's disapprovals are below Trump's in literally every poll. https://t.co/9op4lEXF49
@GOP The same polls show that the Republican Party's far-right views on abortion are also completely out of step with the views of Americans. I see why you left that part out.
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Because they know it's not an emergency and that the Mexican-funded Great Wall of Trumpism is a fucking joke. Good luck with re-election after turning away those "RINOs" who got Trump elected in 2016. You'll need it. But you knew that after that midterm spanking.
@HeyPeggyGG @catmomus @Buddha4203 @senatemajldr And Peggy's personal anecdotes from her time in El Paso must mean the crime statistics are incorrect!
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS Funny how it suddenly became an "emergency" the second Democrats won the House🙄🙄🙄
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS The current states of emergency were not declared solely so that the president could bypass the powers of a democratically elected Congress that he doesn't like. Confiscation would likely go up to the SCOTUS to decide, but they could certainly halt all assault weapon sales.
@jawarddrums @senatemajldr @POTUS I look forward to the next president declaring a national emergency on gun violence and climate change, confiscating all assault rifles and shutting down any businesses overusing fossil fuels. Since that’s what you’re suggesting a president should be able to do.
@StanleyRF @senatemajldr Hahahahahahahhahahaha 		Oh you thought that was happening.
@Buddha4203 @senatemajldr Promise?
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Also no, just because a fetal heart is still beating doesn’t mean they have a chance of making it to birth. Doctors are easily able to determine this. So at this point I feel like we’re circling our previous convo about trusting doctors over politicians so I’ll leave it at that.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I don’t know and neither does my friend, but it seems pretty clear from the way it was worded that this was a not-compatible-with-life situation. And no, no doctor worth their salt would do that. If they did it would be a serious violation of ethics if not illegal.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Thank you🙏 hoping when I’m ready that I conceive easily and have healthy and smooth pregnancies but know that is not always the case. I am 30 so have time but not forever.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS No, no serious doctor would determine a child who tests positive for Downs is incompatible with life, which is what non-viable means. They have plenty of experience and education on the matter and know the difference.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS As a woman who wants children but doesn’t have a long biological window left to do so, I will fight any politician who wants to force me to carry a corpse in my body for months when I could move on and have a healthy baby, simply because they think they know better than my doctor
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS This is clearly not a Downs situation, it’s a “this fetus won’t make it to birth” situation, if it’s even still alive. Her doctor determined it needs to be removed for her own health but hospitals consider it an abortion gray area and don’t want to touch it. It’s a sad situation.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Regardless of if it’s dead or simply stopped growing at a only few weeks, it’s not going to magically transform into a healthy growing baby. She deserves the right to have it removed safely and get pregnant again. Situations like these are why I will always be pro choice.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS She said her coworker still wants to get pregnant and obviously needs this to happen first so she can get pregnant again, and the scheduling issues from this small clinic (not to mention protesters) have been a huge burden.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS This is a group text so the only other details I have from my friend are the top and bottom texts. It sounds like from her that basically it’s still considered abortion if the fetus is non-viable in some way but needs removal (this is in Georgia). https://t.co/vAKVFzSce1
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Got this text today from a friend today and it reminded me of this convo. FYI. https://t.co/O7Mw3aBzPX

@RepMarkWalker @RepAnnWagner You support the most amoral president of our time who raw dogged a porn star while his wife was at home with their infant son. No one takes the GOP seriously anymore when it comes to morality.
@billybraw @RepMarkMeadows Gloriously they can do absofuckinglutely nothing about congressional investigations anymore. They had their chance and blew it. Elections have consequences.
@mrmigthewriter @CharlesMBlow What he's saying is that white people have been roughly 55/45 conservative to liberal in this country, so when Democrats win it's been because the overwhelming POC differential has pushed them over the edge. Every. Time.
@HerbertBraunAT @McFaul Thanks for clarifying. Most Americans feel the same way😑
@drzillestpapi55 @uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot Qanon is not real. Seek help.
@RepRWilliams Statistics show that immigrants actually commit less crime than natural born US citizens but don’t let facts get in the way of your racist narrative.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl I have literally done that so many times and also cited everyone in the party who has called on the wrongdoers to resign. Still waiting on you to do that though.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Sorry what actual rapist am I supporting? Apparently I haven’t notified myself of this yet.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl How many does Bill Clinton? Or the lt. governor for that matter?😂 https://t.co/sifADPihiv
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl I love how you keep changing the subject because you know you’re losing this one hahahah
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Oh we’re doing private citizens now simply because they have voted for or donated to the party? Boy do I have a list for you.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl And you ran an actual rapist so https://t.co/XueXR0KZag
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Funny how you guys scream “due process” or even that the woman is lying when the accused is one of your own nominated to the Supreme Court, but if the accused is a Democrat you automatically deem him a rapist. Hypocrites.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl What have I said that I can’t back up? Add “in this century” to my last statement and it applies. Millennial women were in elementary school when that happened. Anita Hill happened then too so sexual assault issues were handled badly by both parties. One of those parties changed.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Try living in this century. Classic GOP ignoring all the sexual assaulters *currently in your party* while screaming Bill Clinton because that's all you have. In case your party was wondering why they've been hemorrhaging women lately...
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl It's well documented that Democrats have called for the removal of anyone with allegations of sexual assault while the GOP endorses them for senate, the presidency and Supreme Court, but it doesn't appear you're interested in the truth of that matter. Bye bye now👋
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl You also need to talk to more Democrats if you think she's the front runner lol
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl This whole issue is mind-numbingly fucking stupid but just so we're dealing in the realm of facts it says right on the application "for statistical purposes only." Meaning no one was advantaged due to their race. And if she thought she was I don't see how that's lying or racist.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl I don’t see how thinking you were of Native American ancestry because that’s what your family told you is racist but ok.
@FratShannon69 @ryanstruyk You implied that Democrats voted for their representatives based on genitalia and not merit so yes actually.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl What a strange world to live in where every member of a party calling on someone to resign is considered not caring.
@FratShannon69 @ryanstruyk So you don’t think it’s possible for women to the merit for that many to be elected? Wow😶
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl We have far fewer than in the Republican Party, we just call on ours to resign rather than elect them president. Paul Ryan called one of Trump’s campaign comments the definition of a racism and still supported him. Literally today he made a “joke” about the Trail of Tears. Sick.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Yes along with literally every other notable Democrat who has called on him to resign. Had he been on the other side maybe the president would have given him a call to tell him what a "very fine person" he is.
@FratShannon69 @Shaun_Gains @durrant111 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl This tweet is literal right-wing fake news that's been shared 4k times &amp; should be taken seriously. Jacob's idiotic base now believes his and others' garbage due to the right's attacks on real journalism. Fortunately not enough of them to avoid getting decimated in the midterms.
@FratShannon69 @Shaun_Gains @durrant111 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl I believe it's now called "taking a liberty."
@FratShannon69 @Shaun_Gains @durrant111 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl It is not copy and pasting the headline in the least. The headline does not claim that Cooper is in this photo, as Jacob does.
@FratShannon69 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl He was not quoting an article. The article says Cooper was not in the fraternity pictured. Jacob's tweet claims Cooper is IN the photo. Big fuggin difference.
@GotheNavigator @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl Yeah candidates for office tend to get a checkmark. When did you run, Calvin?
@FratShannon69 @Shaun_Gains @durrant111 @KrisRixonNC @JacobAWohl ... so he's not quoting the article.
@drzillestpapi55 @uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot The last one literally does, yes.
@drzillestpapi55 @uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot What's interesting about that last pic is not just the obvious photoshopping of the signs &amp; Bin Laden image, but that whoever did that also photoshopped the women's faces to appear uglier. What a disturbing window into propagandists' motivations &amp; psychology. https://t.co/ScZBa3isa9
@drzillestpapi55 @uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot Whoever is paying you to sound like an English speaking American needs their money back😬😬😬
@drzillestpapi55 @uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot Wait I’m legit confused and curious what the implication is for the AOC/Abedin pic? https://t.co/A1g8JMTDlH
@BarbaraComstock Remind us again of your outspoken opposition to Kavanaugh while facing similar charges? Your political hackery is showing.
@RepMarkWalker As an American who is disgusted with the way our president speaks to and about others I'd urge you to consider your silent support of his behavior. Many women have cried over things like what he described as "locker room talk" happening to them.
@CarmineSabia So when Trump fights back it's calling defending himself but when a Democrat fights back it's called being "triggered." Cool cool cool thanks for clearing up that double standard.
@SenJohnKennedy A man once again trying to tell women what’s best for their healthcare, color me shocked🙄🙄
@teresa_haake @JacobAWohl @amy_scouts No. He’s lying.

@mike_angarone @JacobAWohl You literally can because Jacob did. His tweet is a straight up lie.
@gloriawoody4 @JacobAWohl It’s not Roy Cooper good lord people why do you think Jacob the pathological liar didn’t link to the article he’s referencing?
@2020Landslide @JacobAWohl @LymeLadytrump No thanks I’m good in my party that doesn’t intentionally spread lies because their followers are too lazy to do their own research, as Jacob here has done above.
@RobertL78 @JacobAWohl @TexaLonestar This also isn’t true. Don’t believe everything you see on the internet and do your own research my dude. Even the article Jacob is referring to says Cooper isn’t in the photo which is why Jacob doesn’t link to it.
@nisegrimm93 @JacobAWohl Why would actual reputable media spread something that’s as easily disproven of a falsehood as what Jacob here has tweeted? Just shows you don’t want the “MSM” to report the truth you want them to spread conservative lies and propaganda.
@vickie_mcleod @JacobAWohl @martisw1971 @RoyCooperNC It’s not Roy Cooper. Jacob the pathological liar is once again lying. If there was any question about that ask yourself why he intentionally doesn’t link to the article he’s referring to.
@raqr90 @_ThatVoice @JacobAWohl It’s actually not but keep trying to kick the Clintons out of [...checks notes...] no office at all.
@dollardude @JacobAWohl @Jali_Cat It’s not, Jacob is intentionally spreading fake news which is why he doesn’t link to the article that says as much.
@mull8193 @JacobAWohl It’s not Roy. Jacob is lying. Do your own research.
@NTmychild @JacobAWohl Because they were also part of the confederacy. Duh.
@ruth_pry @JacobAWohl Well it’s at a fraternity house not a sorority, and it says right on the page which fraternity this is which was not Cooper’s. Jacob is lying and hopes (not without merit if you read the comments) that his followers will be too lazy to do a simple Google and see that.
@4ever_1drfl @JacobAWohl @MARINE_99ZULU @RealCandaceO This isn’t Cooper. Jacob is lying which he does constantly.
@cmill59 @JacobAWohl For what?  Cooper is not in this photo. Jacob is lying as he does constantly. The article that he’s referring to says as much which is why he isn’t linking to it in his tweet.
@mshopper72 @JacobAWohl Well it’s not, so you’re gonna have to find something else.
@npsee2018 @JacobAWohl Feel free to share away, it will expose how pervasive lies and fake news are among the conservative community.
@coachspaz56 @JacobAWohl That Jacob is lying again? I know right it’s crazy how he just posts this stuff and expects people to believe it without doing any research of their own.
@JustOneTulip @JacobAWohl @robtdfischl Well as far as we know no one is. Jacob is lying and Roy Cooper is not in this photo. He was in a different fraternity.
@8OverTheRainbow @JacobAWohl It’s not true. Jacob is lying.
@Hey_Russ @JacobAWohl @basemann7 @TheDemocrats Because it’s not Roy Cooper. Jacob is lying which is why he intentionally doesn’t link to the Daily Mail article which says as much.
@Ackjerry2 @JacobAWohl @SeaDimon2 It was but this is not Roy Cooper. Jacob is lying.
@sagarkumarfj @hobgob_ @JacobAWohl Lol imagine if Democrats suggested that due to the color of someone’s skin they never be fired from a job as you just did. We’d have to peel you off the ceiling.
@CRNC So... exactly how much the GOP’s tax cuts for the rich are supposed to blow up the deficit by? This sounds like a much better plan than that was.
@MattWhiseant @the_empty_page @dcastillo82 @skid63 @SCOTUSblog And it’s not equally a man’s duty not to make a stupid decision and enter a woman unless he’s prepared to raise a child? Because men don’t have to face the consequences of pregnancy? That’s exactly what it sounds like you’re saying.
@stephen_brannen @JacobAWohl @RightisRight18 Hahah to Jacob's reputation? True. Jacob the pathological liar is once again attempting to spread a lie about a Democrat to his followers who are too lazy to do their own research. But what else is new.
@ShickenWhips @JacobAWohl That must be why Jacob is posting and attempting to spread this blatant lie.
@WestPA_ @JacobAWohl @DNC Why would they have an issue with this yearbook when Cooper has nothing to do with the photo Jacob posted? Jacob is a known liar, surely you must be aware of this.
@sassyasslou @JacobAWohl @GIJoseph6 @ohhayeee This is not Roy Cooper. Jacob is lying as he does constantly. Read the article he's referencing, which he intentionally doesn't link to. It says as much.
@RuthADouthitt @CBerthelot227 @KyleJamesHoward Uh what does Roy Cooper need a pass for?
@_NE_IL_ @JacobAWohl Also not him. Jacob is lying, as he does constantly. If you read the article Jacob is referring to (which he intentionally doesn't link to in his tweet) you would see as much. Jacob is playing you and others who refuse to do their own research for a fool.
@Princesstoe @JacobAWohl This one is from the 1979 UNC yearbook, and the only association Cooper has with this photo is that he was also a student at UNC in 1979 along with 15,000 others. Jacob is lying.
@BWoehrel @PickettFlash @JacobAWohl It's also not true. Jacob is lying. Do your own research.
@TomTom11202614 @JacobAWohl Why would he resign when he has nothing to do with this photo? Lol Jacob is lying as he does constantly.
@Bonniejones03 @JacobAWohl Likely none including this one. Because Jacob is lying and Cooper is not in this photo.
@RUUnmasked @JacobAWohl @francesme Jacob is lying.  https://t.co/6hN90TdNXS
@Rightwingfemale @JacobAWohl No. Jacob is lying, as he tends to do. This is why he intentionally didn't link to the article - it says as much.
@TomTom105819324 @JacobAWohl Well it's also a lie, because Jacob lies constantly. So there's that.
@extremedays2 @JacobAWohl @Briteeye777 You when you find out Jacob is lying as Roy Cooper has nothing to do with this photo. https://t.co/BwEm5NSEnz
@balancedabudget @JacobAWohl No he didn't. Roy Cooper isn't in this photo nor was he even in the fraternity pictured. Jacob is lying, as he does.
@DeborahDaly55 @JacobAWohl @myworldsince74 Why would you want to spread a lie? Roy Cooper is not in this photo.
@RustyTheOcelot @JacobAWohl @lucille2482 It's not. Jacob is once again lying, as he does.
@ClawsonJonny79 @JacobAWohl @ChelRBR @RoyCooperNC He's also not in this photo. Jacob is lying.
@loudog112 @JacobAWohl Why would he go? He had nothing to do with this photo. Jacob is lying.
@DwightCooper16 @JacobAWohl No, and the article says as much. Jacob is lying, which is why he left the link to the article out of his tweet.
@jpw4dt @JacobAWohl Roy Cooper is not in this photo and Jacob is lying as pathological liars like him do. Explaining why he intentionally left out a link to the article in his tweet.
@kath196482 @JacobAWohl Which is why he intentionally leaves out the link to the article, which says as much. Read for yourself. https://t.co/6hN90TdNXS
@kath196482 @JacobAWohl The photo is real, Cooper is not in it. Jacob is intentionally lying about that.
@TheQuag @JacobAWohl Probably back in the governors mansion tomorrow considering Cooper isn't in this photo and Jacob is lying.
@drzillestpapi55 @connieprice1 @JacobAWohl Well it's not the Clintons so it probs won't.
@Susan67886916 @JacobAWohl You say as you comment on an outright easily disproven lie from a right-wing propagandist.
@tg0326 @JacobAWohl Fortunately for Roy Cooper he has nothing to do with it, and Jacob is once again lying.
@LulaMae01 @JacobAWohl It's not him. A quick Google or even glance at the article that Jacob intentionally didn't link to would tell you that.
@bamderitis @JacobAWohl Nothing. Cooper is not in this photo and Jacob is lying.
@CEWingate1968 @JacobAWohl @Seboaty1 Cooper is not in this photo. Jacob is lying, as he does.
@Inglorious123 @JacobAWohl @icecreampolack Well Roy Cooper could for one, given that he's not in this photo and Jacob is once again lying.
@Drunk3nNoodles @JacobAWohl Ironic you call others dummies when you just got suckered by this known liar on another lie he is spreading. This pic is not of Cooper.
@uavscrappy @JacobAWohl @PolyPatriot He is not mistaken, he is deliberately lying in order to spread lies about the Democratic party. As he does.
@rayann2320 @conservogirl @JacobAWohl You guys are unfortunately being duped by Jacob, a known pathological liar, who is once again lying about this. Cooper is not in this photo nor was he even in the fraternity pictured.
@RichMykola @LaserT23 @planetandwaves1 @JacobAWohl It was from his university actually, demonstrating you have not the slightest understanding of what you're talking about.
@BettyParson @JacobAWohl Hate to burst your bubble but it's not. Jacob is a pathological liar.
@JvE_NL @CarloValvassori @Lori4Unity @JacobAWohl Pretty easy to fact check this and discover that Jacob the pathological liar and fake news spreader is once again lying. https://t.co/clQZ2Vui8S
@LisaPrealestate @ginger_esq @JacobAWohl It literally lists the names of anyone potentially involved right next to the photo lol what more do you need? https://t.co/DYFw1bwNEa
@eastoftahoe @JacobAWohl Because it's not true.
@TLCL1964 @JacobAWohl @LBF777 Cooper is not in this photo. Jacob is a pathological liar who is once again lying. Do your own research.
@Bottom_Creek @JacobAWohl Jacob is lying and Cooper is not in this photo. Google is your friend.
@Megashift1 @JacobAWohl It's not true and Jacob here is a pathological liar who is once again lying. This is why he deliberately avoids linking to the article.
@eastoftahoe @JacobAWohl All you need to easily discover that this pathological liar is again lying. https://t.co/HOZ5QDj7y0
@TheRealEnron @JacobAWohl @DeniedJustice1 @RoyCooperNC He's not in this photo and Jacob is lying. Google is your friend.
@ksandjc02 @bradktoll @JacobAWohl @kensmassage If either of you knew how to Google properly you could find the primary source for this image, which funny enough lists the names of anyone potentially involved right next to the image. Jacob is lying, as pathological liars like him do. https://t.co/dJGl34K8rj
@i_reverend @JacobAWohl @krunalley I hope one day people like you will wake up and realize Jacob makes shit up on the daily, including this.
@12_misfit @chrishlish @JacobAWohl Also the yearbook page listing the names of everyone who could've potentially been involved. No "Roy Cooper" in sight. https://t.co/S4ALECXxX2
@nowakjim @almightygzr @pundit_2016 @JacobAWohl @RoyCooperNC @FoxNews @theobserver @cnnbrk @ABC @MSNBC @wcnc @NCGOP @MyNCSenate @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @JesseBWatters @RealJamesWoods @GOP @CatawbaNCGOP @wakegop @meckgop @MeckDems @wakedems In case you don't want to go through this very misleading article, here's the actual yearbook page which lists the names of those involved right next to the photo. https://t.co/z8NhqMGSJ0
@nowakjim @almightygzr @pundit_2016 @JacobAWohl @RoyCooperNC @FoxNews @theobserver @cnnbrk @ABC @MSNBC @wcnc @NCGOP @MyNCSenate @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @JesseBWatters @RealJamesWoods @GOP @CatawbaNCGOP @wakegop @meckgop @MeckDems @wakedems https://t.co/6hN90TdNXS
@ericplopez @JacobAWohl Not just misleading, it's an outright lie.
@RFGator93 @JacobAWohl It's the former, and Jacob is lying.
@nowakjim @anissapaigewall @JacobAWohl https://t.co/6hN90TdNXS
@RuthADouthitt @CBerthelot227 @KyleJamesHoward And Roy Cooper is not in this photo, so...??
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl Funny I don't see the name Roy Cooper anywhere! Lol Jacob is a liar and you got played, son.
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl I was using the most readily available photo, but if you  insist I Google this for you here is a higher quality version direct from the archives. https://t.co/2SaVJTDXxq
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl No problem. They actually list the names of everyone in that fraternity right next to the photo in the yearbook. Go figure! https://t.co/Jeuw67i3l7
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl Please do let me know how it felt to realize Jacob's garbage drivel was actually a lie.
@ihatematt @madflavor In fact they actually list the names of the people in the fraternity RIGHT NEXT TO THE PHOTO. Go figure. I'd suggest not believing anything known liar and propagandist Jacob says before doing your own research. https://t.co/W5C2ReWHqe
@ihatematt @madflavor ...and? My mom was at UNC in 1979 too.
@ihatematt @madflavor It's not allegedly him at all. He wasn't even in the fraternity pictured.
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl Wow you must be really embarrassed.
@bonsci @JacobAWohl @MailOnline If you read the article why would you be questioning if he's in the photo? A simple Google would tell you he wasn't even in this fraternity. Jacob is a known liar and propagandist.
@camdan14 @JacobAWohl @DavidWohl Ironic that you mention sheep when you automatically believed this with clearly no research of your own. Cooper isn't in this photo and Jacob here isn't linking to the article because it says as much.
@anissapaigewall @JacobAWohl Also not true. Jacob is lying, and the article which he deliberately doesn't link to says as much.
@CastleEarly @JacobAWohl No. It's not Cooper in the photo and Jacob here is lying. He's not providing a link to the article because even the article states this.
@TheReturning1 @JacobAWohl It's also not true.
@LisaTurnage12 @JacobAWohl It's not true.
@Ralphn8r @JacobAWohl There is no outrage because photos like this were commonly found in yearbooks across the South and Roy Cooper wasn't even in the fraternity pictured, much less in the actual photo.
@Batty_Replicant @JacobAWohl Imagine your shock when you find out that Jacob here is spreading fake news and Roy Cooper isn't in this photo at all.
@grace_gbr3 @JacobAWohl Roy Cooper needs to be out of office for attending a college where this was in the yearbook? Lol what
@hobgob_ @JacobAWohl You should wonder who all 3 of them are, since Roy Cooper isn't in this photo either. He wasn't even a member of that fraternity.
@CSA19913774 Another one what? He's not in these photos nor was he even a member of the fraternity pictured. Read the article. This headline is extremely dishonest and so are you for spreading it.
@FBSMNewEngland @mplshilary @JacobAWohl @CountessCaneToo Well it's not him and Jacob is straight up lying, so there's that.
@ValueLlc Get caught doing what? He's not in the photo and wasn't even a member of the fraternity pictured, which you would know if you had read the article and not the extremely misleading headline.
@MarkProkop2 Lies. He is not in this photo nor was he even in the fraternity pictured.
@MrHarryAbner Roy Cooper isn't in this photo and wasn't even a member of the fraternity pictured. You're spreading a bold faced lie.
@KirkFreemanLaw Another politician... doing what? Cooper isn't in this photo and wasn't even a member of the fraternity pictured.
@CTIronman @RaleighReporter No. He belonged to Chi Psi. This is Chi Phi.
@ihatematt @madflavor This... isn't a photo of him. You're spreading lies and propaganda.
@quick13 A simple Google would tell you that he wasn't even in that fraternity.
@ballinger_matt @CBerthelot227 Yeah this Daily Mail story is dumb and dishonest generally
@ballinger_matt @CBerthelot227 Roy Cooper isn't a Republican my dude.
@TonyLepore7 @RuthADouthitt @2018MAGAMidTrmT @KyleJamesHoward Except no one knows the political party of the dudes in this photo but cool cool cool
@RuthADouthitt @CBerthelot227 @KyleJamesHoward Uh what makes you think it's Democrats in this photo? They're white frat guys from NC who are now in their late 50's/early 60's. Simple demographic statistics would tell us otherwise.
@bjanewhitely @RealWayneRoot He is not. This is a photo in a yearbook from a year he happened to be a student at a school with 15,000 undergraduates. https://t.co/Nuqi2HP16U
@keyboardbrian @NYTankingSZN @MistyNight6 @DailyMail You... can't be serious. Everyone who was a student at UNC in 1979 needs to be on record condemning this page in a yearbook that most students don't get or they're a racist. Dear lord.
@EricSweet4 @GonzoApp @DailyMail But no he was not a member of the fraternity in question. Daily Mail is reeeeaching.
@DailyMail Try not to hurt yourself with that stretch. https://t.co/e3BMM7ZNqg
@frzz @UNC @RaleighReporter That is not exactly true. The chancellor proposed that, the board rejected it, and she subsequently resigned. Sam's fate is still TBD.
@danielwesley0 @sjta_amy @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow If you think this administration is pro-immigration you should do a little more research on Trump's senior policy advisor Stephen Miller and his belief system.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Yep, which I legally have the right to do and will always advocate for that. Perhaps if we lived in a society that supported unprepared mothers after birth I'd feel differently, but unfortunately we don't. I've said what I need to say about it and feel the same way. Be blessed✌
@newsobserver I went through my grandpa's Yackety Yack from the 1940's a while back and remember seeing a page featuring a Tri Delt "plantation party" complete with all the ladies in blackface. It was... wow.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS In these post-20 week cases, as we discussed earlier, injection is used to ensure the fetus is dead before removal begins. So again, I do not see a problem here. 2/2
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS These sources say 20 weeks, many others say 24-26. Not a huge difference IMO. Either way most states only allow post-20 week abortions in the case of danger to the mother or fetal abnormality incompatible with life or a somewhat decent quality of it. 1/2
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS You are citing random anecdotes as fact while rejecting the science. I understand the science just fine, and the fact is that the vast majority of scientists (not just doctors) agree on this. If you have reputable scientific evidence that states otherwise feel free to present it.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Nearly all science agrees that a fetus cannot feel pain until the third trimester.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS In cases when D&amp;E is done without injection it's early enough on in a pregnancy that the fetus cannot feel pain, so this does not bother me no.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Correct, I don't care because I don't believe they are human and neither does science. So agree to disagree.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS You literally stated earlier that it's killed first via injection before any dismemberment takes place. It doesn't seem like I'm the one who needs to get my facts straight here.
@SteveScalise Unfortunately reasonable people no longer take the GOP seriously on this issue when you take millions in NRA $$ and when your colleagues like @mattgaetz make ridiculous claims like a border wall will stop mass shootings.
@RepMarkMeadows So did you watch the super bowl or nah?
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Maybe I am more informed than you think and because of that believe that women should always have the right to choose, and should be able to make those difficult decisions with her doctor. It doesn’t seem like you’re considering this as a possibility.
@danielwesley0 @sjta_amy @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow “Forcing their agenda” lol what.	Pence literally believes in conversion therapy.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I was fully aware that the fetal heart is still beating before termination in both of those scenarios. Again, not necessary does not mean more humane. Is that all? Because I still support my position 100%.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I’ll also address your implication that I don’t know my facts because I hold an opinion counter to yours. I know my facts and at no point have I demonstrated otherwise. People’s opinions aren’t always different than yours because they’re less educated.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS In fact I feel so good about it that I make a recurring monthly donation to PP.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I’ve evaluated pretty thoroughly over many years and feel very good about where I stand on the issue.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Again, the only fetuses aborted at an age when they could potentially survive outside the womb are ones who medically will not anyway. The rest are aborted at an age where they resemble nothing like a human. I will never be convinced that this is murder so idk why you keep trying
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS The lack of formation of said human and its inability to survive outside of a woman's body is actually the biggest point of difference, which is why the law does not consider it murder. Not sure what misleading info you're referring to but that sounds like a different convo.
@SugarCatDancer @jonathanfranks @dawgs4ever @RepMarkMeadows In addition to being able to do multiple things at once, they can propose their own healthcare reform but obviously the Senate &amp; POTUS will never pass it. Hell Republicans couldn't even pass their own healthcare reform bill.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS So you think abortion is murder, I don't and neither does the law. Agree to disagree.
@dawgs4ever @jonathanfranks @RepMarkMeadows Yes.
@jwerz @RepMarkMeadows Gloriously, he can’t. Elections have consequences.
@DavidSt47462545 @dawgs4ever @RepMarkMeadows I said the *Dem* candidates. Not the guy who posts “WITCH HUNT!” on Twitter every day.
@DiamondpenguinG @Jmiller423 @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews CBS news viewers and those who watched the SOTU on CBS are two very different demos my dude
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS That guy was convicted of murder. Most doctors have not been convicted of murder.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I would rather leave it up to a doctor and myself than anyone else, least of which being a politician. But that is just me.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I mean, I don't see why it would be done that way but I'd certainly be in favor of a more humane way of performing the procedure like how it's done now.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS But I appreciate the thoughtful and respectful discussion.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Neither of those methods involve a dismemberment before death so I don't see a problem. We clearly have different views on quality vs. quantity of life. I believe I should have the right to make those choices for myself and child, particularly in cases of medical abnormalities.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Perhaps if you could specify the abortion method you're referring to with the term "mutilation" this would be a more productive discussion.
@dawgs4ever @RepMarkMeadows Yep totally — that's why Dem candidates put healthcare front &amp; center for the midterms, barely mentioned the investigation, and won 40 seats.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS You keep saying poison/mutilate like we don't euthanize animals and people every day as a way to let them humanely leave the world. Absolutely I would do that if it was the least painful way to end my child's suffering.
@RepMarkMeadows Hey Meadows remind us of who said "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing" during the campaign and then the DNC's server got hacked the next day. And whose campaign manager pled guilty to conspiracy against the United States.
@danielwesley0 @sjta_amy @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow His approval rating would suggest otherwise.
@danielwesley0 @sjta_amy @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow https://t.co/baVNFjTMP9
@sjta_amy @danielwesley0 @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow Also most people who dislike Trump were not watching, so there’s that.
@danielwesley0 @sjta_amy @ReplaceTheGOP @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow Lol a “kind discussion” to Daniel involves calling people he disagrees with evil sickos.
@danielwesley0 @ReplaceTheGOP @sjta_amy @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow https://t.co/aYJ9yu8qV7
@DiamondpenguinG @Jmiller423 @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews You do realize Trump is very right biased and attracts a right wing audience, right?
@danielwesley0 @ReplaceTheGOP @sjta_amy @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow You could tell me 100% are future Democrats and I would not give a fuck.
@danielwesley0 @ReplaceTheGOP @sjta_amy @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow Are they still young women if they're not formed enough for a gender to be determined, as 90% of fetuses are when they're aborted?
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS And it shouldn't be up to you or Mark Meadows or Donald Trump or anyone else to decide what's best for me and my child. None of you are doctors.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS In the case of a child who would clearly not survive life outside the womb, I would personally choose to terminate in utero as soon as possible rather than have my child suffer one more day of drowning in its own fluid as was the case of the woman I referenced earlier.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Science does not consider fetuses living children and I prefer dealing in science over personal beliefs. I think doctors and  parents should decide what would be most humane for them and the child. Every situation is different and that should be left up to them, not politicians.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS The situation he describes is one where nothing can be done to keep the child alive, which is what would happen in most of these cases if politicians force severely deformed and unviable fetuses to be born alive. That seems incredibly inhumane and traumatizing for parents to me.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Sometimes yes. Would you find it more humane to prematurely induce labor and let the baby wriggle around on a table until it finally dies? I fail to see how anyone sees that as a humane solution to severe fetal abnormalities.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Sometimes it *is* medically necessary, or merciful to the fetus, to terminate a heartbeat before delivery. Again, you are not a doctor so Idk what makes you think you know everything about every situation. This should be left up to each woman and her doctor, period.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS This would be an example. https://t.co/Ki1Teq2tun
@ReplaceTheGOP @sjta_amy @RepMarkMeadows @danielwesley0 @POTUS @SteveDeaceShow Unfortunately even if clear evidence comes out that he had financed an abortion, Meadows and his supporters wouldn't care. As long as he's trying to take away women's right to have them now.
@rosiesgirll @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Terminating via pre-term induction when medically necessary is also considered abortion, which people like Meadows are trying to stop.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Women who face the gut-wrenching prospect of having to terminate a pregnancy in the 3rd trimester are against them too, and would appreciate politicians not making that situation more difficult. You have no idea what you're talking about. https://t.co/Ll40fMTz8a
@bryandawg80 @knucklepushup @BPoppel @gruder007 @CBSEveningNews That’s... not how this works. 76% of SOTU viewers were very likely Trump supporters, yes. Why would those of us who hate him want to watch him lie and demonize us for an hour and a half? Woof.
@Jmiller423 @CBSEveningNews @CBSNews Viewers. So roughly 76% of viewers already liked Trump. The rest of us were watching Netflix.
@Kinglink86_ @ruccidizzy @AngieAnibire56 @nathanTbernard And when exactly was this time in your mind?
@VotedForYouBut @SteveKingIA Verdict @artdecider?
@kawarren818 @SurrealiTees @KurtSchlichter I disagree with the implication that Trump’s childish nicknames are disconnected from bullying, or that a child has to feel physically threatened to be bullied. If another child called yours those names, wouldn’t you say they were bullying him? Examples are set from the top.
@kawarren818 @SurrealiTees @KurtSchlichter No, nor did I say it was. Adults are big boys and girls and can handle themselves. I do find it extremely concerning that any adult would find it funny or accept as “the new normal” that our president engages in such childish behavior though.
@wearerighter You’re right it was a real shame how Laura Ingraham lost all those advertisers for bullying the Parkland students.
@Nate_McMurray A friend is an acquaintance of his daughter &amp; sent me this from her Instagram. Literally joking about the fact that he’s a criminal... smh🙄 https://t.co/7CC2XM8WJZ
@kawarren818 @SurrealiTees @KurtSchlichter That you think it’s funny that our president gives childish nicknames to people who threaten him... says a lot about your sense of humor. And maturity.
@GrammieQB @politico Who implied that being white was a crime? All they stated was the fact that the white voting block has more influence on his approval rating than any other race (duh). Better question is why do white Trump supporters thrive on feeling like whiteness is under constant attack.
@BarbaraComstock @ewarren Didn't you lose?
@krause_quinn @BarendHamm @mdh9876 @pewresearch What evidence are you citing that that has always happened?
@krause_quinn @BarendHamm @pewresearch I know R's want to believe millennials will become more conservative as they get older but there's simply no evidence of that - Pew's data actually shows the opposite trend. When boomers were our age they were already Republican voters, going for Reagan in '84 then Bush in '88. https://t.co/GlibSiNpkJ
@thekennymiller @AriFleischer "Media" is not supposed to be impartial; Limbaugh is media. Journalism is supposed to be impartial. Opinion pieces, which is what this article is, are just that - opinion. Unfortunately the public is having a difficult time assessing or being willfully ignorant of the differences
@JohnCornyn The party of Trump suddenly wants rationality😂🙄😂
@Kristina_Why @pewresearch @ManMet80 Parental influence, now slowly wearing off.
@ChrisHa15531109 @RichardGrenell @VP You mean like Chris Christie who was on the show 3 days ago? https://t.co/pwNXiBj9Ll
@CVehr @TomiLahren You have clearly underestimated how much people loved their “grandstanding” at the Kavanaugh hearings... and how gutturally people despise Kavanaugh.
@DougHeye @RaduMarinescu6 They also voted (again) for a Dem governor in 2017 and flipped 3 House seats blue in ‘18. Virginia is NOT a swing state, especially as long as Trump is in the WH. To think otherwise is simply delusional.
@DougHeye Lol imagine still thinking Virginia could go to Trump in 2020 after the midterms. Severely out of touch.
@SenatorBurr @BLS_gov Now do the deficit.
@4YrsToday That he is energizing Democrats.
@DavidReyesdeVi1 @BerkInanc2 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro Yeah I don't even know what you're asking me to prove tbh
@DavidReyesdeVi1 @BerkInanc2 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro Oh I'm fine talking about what I said. You, on the other hand, have gone on and on about how stupid I am with literally no statistics, facts, etc or even an assertion of your own that contrasts mine.
@DavidReyesdeVi1 @BerkInanc2 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro You have literally brought not one statistic to this conversation lol
@BerkInanc2 @DavidReyesdeVi1 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro ... meanwhile they circle jerk each other over my stupidity while saying things like "of coarse"
@BerkInanc2 @DavidReyesdeVi1 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro My guess is this is his attempt at what they call "triggering the libs" in order to get me to actually do that and thereby prove him right. Classic😂
@DavidReyesdeVi1 @prym84eva @TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro Weird that I didn’t do any of those things then. Just stated evidence-based facts. And the fact of the matter is that this drug haul came through a legal point of entry and was stopped by dogs. Sorry if that doesn’t agree with your narrative.
@THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro I don’t suppose it’s ever occurred to you that we use numerous evidence-based methods to thwart illegal smugglers including drones, dogs, infrared sensing, additional agents, each one having advantages and disadvantages. A medieval wall didn’t stop this giant drug haul, dogs did.
@TCAAgas @THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro Yes I do see how making stuff up works, thanks for displaying that for me.
@THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro It’s called logic. If it were easier to transport drugs across areas where there’s no wall why didn’t these people do that?🤔
@THEmrkia @Gulinoooooh @SenTomCotton @benshapiro Great so the existing barrier did it’s job, no $5b wall needed. Thanks for clearing that up!
@JohnCornyn Sounds like you have a good idea for a compromise John, why won’t you push for it? I think we know. https://t.co/wyeYfHJQe9
@T_Palms23 @DrDGrossman @foxyzorro @MeghanMcCain So glad you support making first trimester abortions more convenient so that post-20 week abortions become less frequent!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Hard pass but will tune in afterwards for the reality-based speech. https://t.co/VkXMfXBzQE
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No you're not. Young people only show up to the March for Life because schools bus them in. Many, including several of my friends, become pro-choice once they leave the "influence" of Catholic schools and start thinking for themselves.
@RepMarkMeadows Nope, and you're not getting a wall. Elections have consequences. https://t.co/hVi9RwMmT2
@CherylH95005477 @GOPLeader There are many, many GOP politicians who want to take away women’s right to decide with their doctor to save their own life over that of a (often unviable) fetus in the case of a pregnancy complication.
@yrnf So how many members of the "young republicans" are actually capable of getting pregnant? Do you really think a society that's approaching 50% female representation in government will allow you to roll back abortion rights? lol even female GOP senators are pro-choice.
@GOPLeader You cannot fathom it because you will never experience the fear of an unplanned pregnancy, of politicians taking away your right to save your own life during a pregnancy complication, or to be forced to carry a child from rape or incest. Trust, we are just as disgusted with you.
@JerryLFranklin @realDonaldTrump No😂 https://t.co/2w3mp2TGcc
@benshapiro @MeghanMcCain Americans actually favor keeping abortion safe &amp; legal by a 2 to 1 margin, Ben. If facts don't care about your feelings why do you keep making them up?
@JohnCornyn That 70% marginal tax rate on income over $10 million a year doesn't seem so dumb now does it, John? How'd those tax cuts for the rich work out?
@adamblust @GregShugar @MSNBC Was thinking this exactly. The more he trashes Democrats the fewer votes he will take from potential Dem voters so... silver lining?
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump In other news https://t.co/Rb8hX55ye8
@RepMarkWalker @RepLeeZeldin Remember that time Trump called these guys very fine people and the GOP said meh but tax cuts for the rich https://t.co/kxATIKvIHI
@Hootz313axp @washingtonpost If Trump was a viable candidate the GOP wouldn’t be so giddy about Schultz running. Trump’s only path to re-election is a serious independent candidate and they know it. That’s why he was practically begging Schultz to run on twitter yesterday.
@ShawnCollinsLSP @washingtonpost Well if Gary Johnson and Jill Stein had dropped out Trump might not be president... so...		No one cares if he runs against Harris or any other Dem, just run as a Dem.
@BenjaminSWatson @RepMarkWalker You actually think forcing women and girls to give birth before they’re ready encourages families? No. Look up some statistics on teenage motherhood, dude🙄
@BellaBlithe @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Guessing it will age about as well as this one. https://t.co/Sui7EvrKOG
@kcabreira76 @RepMarkWalker @POTUS The people voted for Democrats with the understanding that she would be Speaker if they won the majority. Republicans attack ads made it very clear that would be the case.
@marcorubio "Extraordinary bias" is you assuming the words unusual and provocative mean bad because they're coming from the LA Times. You know those words don't mean the same thing, right? Like at all.
@TheCommonSens15 @RepMarkWalker @POTUS Yeah, kind of the reason Dems actually got half of Pennsylvania's seats this year when they got half the votes. ICYMI they were court ordered to redraw their unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts. As for your conspiracy theories... lol. Whatever helps you sleep at night man.
@TheCommonSens15 @RepMarkWalker @POTUS R's won more seats in 2010 because the GOP has gerrymandered districts to shit. The *people* voted for D's by a larger margin in '18, as they did Clinton over Trump. Check back when more than 8 Rep Senators are up for re-election, 1/4 of which lost their seats to Dems in November
@TheCommonSens15 @RepMarkWalker @POTUS Yeah they lost the pulse of the American people so much that they beat Republicans by 40 seats and 10 million votes in the midterms.		Pretty sure they got this, bud.
@RepMarkWalker @POTUS Well the people voted for Pelosi to be Speaker... so...
@senatemajldr BREAKING: America disagrees.	https://t.co/B8A8HEnijz

@yrnf @HuffPost @bennyjohnson So because they write about one person and not the other that makes them fake? Your sheepish parroting of an aspiring authoritarian's rhetoric is what's wrong with America. Google the word "Lügenpresse" and evaluate your lives.
@funkychicken @SCAM518 @RepThomasMassie @realDonaldTrump @CovCathColonels Agreed that any adult who thought it was a good idea to allow 100+ teenage boys to descend upon the most liberal city in America decked out in MAGA gear, then proceed not to immediately remove them from a situation where they were being harassed, deserves equal or more criticism.
@DanCrenshawTX Which part of the reporting on Karen Pence's workplace has been untrue? You know that's required in order for something to be slander, right?
@exlitigator @DanCrenshawTX Dan doesn't seem to be aware that in order to be slander it has to be untrue.
@funkychicken @SCAM518 @RepThomasMassie @realDonaldTrump @CovCathColonels Proving the point that a certain culture has been encouraged or at the very least tolerated at this school and among these students’ parents.
@Never10pm @soledadobrien That is not what anyone is saying. They are pointing out of the irony of Ingraham using a photo of exclusively boys to represent a march against women's choice, as well as disgust that boys are there at all. Obviously girls are bussed in from Catholic schools as well as boys.
@Never10pm @soledadobrien That's... not what she said.
@Never10pm @soledadobrien These children are bussed in from Catholic schools and used as pawns by leadership to promote an overtly political agenda. When they become old enough to worry about unplanned pregnancy many will change their tune. I know quite a few who did.
@GOPLeader MLK would hate everything that your party has become.

@RNMSN1975 @mike_pence But go on teaching your children strong Christian values like the kids from #convingtoncatholic seem to possess. https://t.co/PI4d0IMaw4
@RNMSN1975 @mike_pence Thought you’d say that. You do realize the article says nothing about anyone trying to interfere with your life choices but choose to baselessly attack my reading comprehension skills instead. Feel free to prove me wrong by pointing to the part you’re referencing. I’ll wait.
@aaronjcarpenter @realDonaldTrump You do realize more women voted against Trump than for him right? And that they cleaned the clocks of Republican men last November? Did you miss that?
@RNMSN1975 @mike_pence Yeah I read it and all I saw was criticism. So who is trying to interfere?
@RNMSN1975 @mike_pence Who is interfering?
@cody_clements @ArtheosNL @NelsPalmerur @chrisinsilico @IngrahamAngle Catholic middle and high schools bus them in from out of state. I have several friends whose catholic school would bus them all the way from Charlotte. Those friends are now all pro-choice.
@RepDLamborn @SteveDaines I’ll go out on a limb and guess most of this pro-birth caucus will not have a uterus.
@OhioUBobcats @HoarseWisperer @IngrahamAngle My best friend’s catholic school did the same. She is now adamantly pro-choice.
@lauriehall0923 @dlgl1972 @MaryZPA @CLewandowski_ Her *upcoming* trip was to visit troops in Afghanistan. She wasn’t even Speaker when she was in Hawaii. Do keep up.

@RepBrianBabin @POTUS Good to know you consider our leaders visiting troops abroad "globetrotting." I'm sure as someone who dislikes political games you were equally as critical of Trump when he flew to Iraq during the shutdown.

@CLewandowski_ half the likes on this tweet are from MAGAs who think this is serious I'm crying😂🤣😂🤣
@guypbenson @secupp Idk she specifies pretty clearly in the interview she did this morning and never mentioned sexuality. Go off tho
@CLewandowski_ Boom! Use your own money to visit the troops in a war zone I've never been to! Super pwned!

@TUBINTEXAS @NPR You must have missed the part where % chance is very different from % support. And the part where polls predicted 2018 results down to a single percentage point. But continue living in your world where everyone loves Trump and any bad polls are fake. 2020 will come as a shock.
@neeratanden I like how it's baked in at this point that they've lost suburban women.	Good.
@SenThomTillis @March_for_Life @SenatorBurr Hard pass. Get McConnell to open the government.
@JohnCornyn Your intentional misrepresentation of the other side's position in a time when this country is more divided than ever is truly a disgusting quality in a leader.
@tomselliott You are clearly only talking to fellow conservatives in DC. In the liberal world, where no one gives a fuq about sexuality, everyone thinks this compromise has to do with his campaign finances, Russian ties, something Trump has on him, who knows.
@secupp I respect a lot of your views SE, but this is coming off as conservative projection and you should stop. Omar said nothing about sexuality. Your assumption that a congressman's homosexuality would compromise him says more about your own views of sexuality than hers.

@TheFourMarks @DCampoamor Less than 1% of abortions happen at this stage and in most states it‘s illegal. This “meme” or whatever it is is misleading and dishonest.

@DregsUSA @RepDonBacon @PastorKaos Reminder: the government shut down while Republicans still controlled the House.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Do not insult our hard work by pretending it has anything to do with two disgraceful excuses for human beings who were born with silver spoons in their mouths and still managed to run their corruption-filled businesses into the ground.
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker Why do you always have to compare white supremacist violence to something else? Why can't you just say white supremacy and the violence incited by it is evil? I think we know why.
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker And, of course, it is now abundantly clear who you sympathize with minister. Calling white supremacists who MURDERED Americans "pitiful" but utterly outraged at what you call a "left wing mob" toppling statues in Durham where, again, no one was injured. That is just a lie.
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker So it’s ok to kill people who disagree? Because you haven’t once condemned the murder in Charlottesville given several opportunities to do so. You deflected and said well the protestors in Chapel Hill and Durham were more violent despite the fact that they injured no one.
@labellaluna11 @JacobAWohl Classic cornwohlio
@DanCrenshawTX Except Republicans held the House for the first two weeks of this shutdown but go off
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker But don't take my word that white supremacy is a cancer to this country, take the word of the only black Congressman in the GOP. He wrote this OpEd today. https://t.co/y9Jm4Yweng		An excerpt: https://t.co/k9bD1NVBPb
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker No. Not soldiers in warfare. One side in Chapel Hill/Durham, which you called "more violent," did not hurt anyone. The other side, which you said were simply marching in support of a statue, killed someone. Why are you excusing that?
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker Are you actually equating one side hurting feelings to the other side murdering people?
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker Then why were the tiki torchers chanting that in the streets of Charlottesville if they were simply marching to save a statue?
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker Who was hurt?
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker Weird that "Jews will not replace us" is the new war cry of saving Confederate statues, who knew...
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker False. The "other side" has not killed anyone. The tiki torch side has.
@wreiddalton @hertel_will @RepMarkWalker They are marching in the streets of Charlottesville. Shooting up places of worship. Driving cars into crowds. Sitting in Congress. If you think they're trying to be left alone you need to look around.
@peter_cappel @JacobAWohl If you think *she* is going to let herself leave alive before 2021, you don't know RBG.

@RepMarkWalker More people were killed by lettuce last year than illegal immigrants. Spare us the faux crisis and reopen the government.
@wreiddalton @RepMarkWalker Would you acknowledge that a white supremacist is not a "very fine person" and should not be sitting in Congress, even if no one is forcing them to change their personal views? That's the only point I was making in the first place, which you seemed to refute.
@wreiddalton @RepMarkWalker The only race that has oppressed another in America is the white one. That you are a former minister and think white supremacy is A-okay reminds me why I will keep my children far away from the church.
@wreiddalton @RepMarkWalker So you are of the viewpoint that white supremacy is an opinion that should be respected as much as racial equality? Wow.
@wreiddalton @RepMarkWalker Saying you take pride in being a race that has historically oppressed other races and has been systematically advantaged in this country because of that is a very very very different thing than cheering for an athletic team. Please read a history book, Mr. Dalton.
@wreiddalton @RepMarkWalker You can't be serious. The other side of white supremacy does not claim to be superior to white people.
@JohnCornyn "I am proud to shut down the government." 	- Donald Trump	December 11, 2018		You own this.

@LindseyGrahamSC Can you *fucking* imagine if the next president declares gun violence a national emergency (which results in thousands more deaths than illegal immigration) and decides to bypass congress and seize all guns. This is the precedent you’re setting.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The GOP’s executive overreach police can show up any day now, or did you get lost with them on the way to authoritarianism?
@RepMarkWalker @Acosta Oh pastor, making Jesus proud every day.🙏
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Perhaps that's because border crossings are lower now than they were in 2014. All you have to do is look at any statistic to see that this is a crisis in your own minds. Open the government. https://t.co/4ScPuAYnv5

@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Just to clear this up on the other polls you called "heavily biased":	The Nov. 4 Marist poll undershot Clinton's actual win by 1%. Quinnipiac's last general election poll was taken before the Comey news broke and overshot her actual win by 5%. So both were extremely accurate.

@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Where's the video, Todd?? Where's your source saying the majority of Americans are Republicans? Where's your source saying any of the polls I listed overshot Democrats 2 to 1? We're all on the edge of our seats!!
@mrgfwilliams @DoremusJ @CWOTamI @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi It's cool to call people little girl, swamp dweller, unintelligent, etc as long as you don't use a *GaSp* swear word! The horror!!!!
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Haha Gallup didn't even poll the 2016 election. There you go making stuff up again.
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi What's your source on that? Gallup was dead on for the midterms accurately predicting the popular vote margin within a single percentage point.
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi That's so weird I watched that whole video and didn't real the word wall once. Where's the video of them screaming about a wall, Todd??
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Which poll over-sampled Democrats 2 to 1?
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Cool, where is it? #WheresTheVideoTodd
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Not one of those quotes mentions a wall. Where's the video evidence of Democrats screaming for a wall, Todd?! You said it exists!
@GOPLeader And what “coming” has your side done other than into porn stars when his wife was at home?
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi I need no source to back up the claim that a video does not exist of Democrats screaming for a wall. It just doesn’t exist. Where’s the video Todd? Should be pretty easy to find since you knew about it already.
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi Vote counts, which you said are liberally biased, and polls which you said the same about. Now you.
@mrgfwilliams @CWOTamI @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi And yet here you trolling people with insults while not citing any source that validates your claims. Again.
@CWOTamI @mrgfwilliams @DoremusJ @HawleyMO @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi I’m beginning to think this Todd has a proclivity for making shit up.

@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Then why have you engaged with me for so long😂🤣😂	I love freedom too, the freedom for women to make their own reproductive choices. Something you and Jason do not want.	I'm sure those many sources you refuse to cite are totally real and definitely not made up.	Good talk👋👋👋
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Hahahah I gave you several opportunities to cite any source that backed up your assertion that the vast majority of Americans agree with you including ones you consider non-liberally biased ones. You refused and declared victory. What.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith So you can't find one😕	Rough life when all facts are liberally biased in your mind
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Also hilarious how you think actual vote tallies are liberally biased (hint: it's because they are).
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Cool cite one of those then.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Hahah I love how the right has no idea that their obsession with her just amplifies her platform more. Super entertaining.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith So you have no sources. Cool, that's what I thought.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith I'm not "from" DC but have lived here for about a year and half working in an area completely unrelated to government. If that makes me a swamp dweller whatever but I'm going to adopt any other Rep I want considering we American citizens residing in DC don't have our own.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith Haha what? Anti-choice/"pro-life" is literally part of the Republican platform. Any widely accepted polling source can be considered serious: Gallup, Marist College, Quinnipiac etc. Also vote totals which have been higher for D than R for the last 3 presidential election cycles.
@SThomps72774109 @SFlipp @pajamagirl @Titou4004 @Tonycuz @CalebJHull There has never been one who lied an average of multiple times a day every day of his presidency, as this one does.
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith 1) Cite any serious source that shows the vast majority of Americans are Republican and/or anti-choice. Until then, false.	2) Not sure what you mean by "swamp dweller"? I don't work in gov't...
@mrgfwilliams @Mmoran64 @RepJasonSmith That is demonstrably false in so many ways.

@RepJasonSmith Good thing there are now 100 women in Congress to defend us actual living women from people who don’t have uteruses trying to force us to carry fetuses to term. Go fuck yourself.
@JohnCornyn @WSJ It’s puzzling that you would publicize this article as a Trump enabler. This is not a good thing.
@SecNielsen You are a lying sack of shit, the American people don’t believe you, and you will be remembered as a disgraceful stain on American history. Have fun with that.
@GOPLeader Retribution? Really? Have you tried telling dear leader that Obama built a big beautiful wall along the southern border? That would end this shutdown in no time.
@way2confused1 @GrayGinther @JohnCornyn And what has Trump budged on? The Senate passed a CR with no wall funding unanimously until Trump threw a temper tantrum and now all R senators are acting like wall funding is some national emergency. It’s bullshit and they know it.
@TXRandy14 @RepBrianBabin That so weird I could have sworn Republicans keep saying Democrats want open borders. Which is it, rep?
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 Despite the fact that most of those of these migrants present themselves at the border legally, Trump himself said they are no longer a problem. So why do we need more wall? https://t.co/jFbOqDtdea
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 And most of America agrees with this.
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 That's exactly what you did. Walls work where necessary, but billions for a wall that Mexico was supposed to fund across the *entire* southern border at a time when illegal border crossings are at record lows - and most are here illegally through visa overstays - is unnecessary.
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 Cool comparing immigrants to zoo animals but I'm still curious what your answer is.
@SeanHiggs @Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @NateSilver538 Thanks for your thoughtful answer. Interesting. If it doesn't get built at all would you consider yourself in the "disapprove" category?
@SeanHiggs @Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @NateSilver538 Well I'm still curious so feel free to repeat your answer if you don't mind.
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 Cool avoidance of the question but I asked first.
@Ed_Stade_IV @kbakst @SeanHiggs @NateSilver538 Honest question: Would you disapprove if/when the wall doesn't happen? Or would you still support him and blame that on Democrats? Not delivering on promises is the only thing I see eroding this 40% base but then again his supporters don't tend to assign Trump fault for anything.
@hoekedonphoto @JakeDobson71 @SenSanders He didn't claim to be common folk, nor did he claim to be able to "relate" to federal workers not getting paid. Trump did.
@vettesetter @ewarren @TGowdySC 2) Dossier claims proven true: Russia interfered in the election and had "dirt" on Clinton/the DNC; Michael Cohen went to Prague in August 2016; Carter Page went to Russia in July 2016; a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine paid Paul Manafort for work there.
@vettesetter @ewarren @TGowdySC 1) I never said Trump was working with Russia, but since you brought it up his son, associates, campaign manager &amp; nat'l security advisor certainly were. What I said was that Russia worked to help Trump, evidenced by U.S. intelligence issuing a report stating exactly that.
@vettesetter @ewarren @TGowdySC Conspiracy in the assertion that the *real* collision was between Dems &amp; Russia when it’s a fact that Russia was working to help Trump, and falsehood in that George Papadopolous’ big mouth started the Mueller investigation, not the continuously verified dossier.

@Virtual_Tribe @ABlackAmericanM @McAllisterDen @Bakari_Sellers Homeboy has watched no fewer than every one of AOC’s Instagram stories but wants you to know he’s definitely not scared or obsessed.
@RepMarkWalker @ewarren @TGowdySC “Pastors” like you are the reason I left religion after growing up going to church every Sunday in NC. Your true character is on full display in this tweet. I’m happy with mine if this is what being a “Christian” looks like.
@vettesetter @ewarren @TGowdySC 👆party of unrestrained capitalism suddenly has a problem with people writing books for money🙄🙄🙄
@boileralum85 @CrowLon @RepMarkGreen Sounds like a voter problem. Maybe if the wall was a popular idea you could have gotten 60 republican senators and not have hemorrhaged 40 House seats. Also, I thought Mexico was paying for this?🤔
@laurenelltalk @GOPChairwoman @VoteMarsha @kayiveyforgov @KristiNoem @KimReynoldsIA @YoungKimCD39 A new like just reminded me of this thread and I had to lol that one of these women actually lost her race once all the votes were tallied😂😂
@amandacarpenter "Dad, I'm so proud of you."	"Daughter, come with me to make calls for the man you called your mom ugly and said your grandpa killed JFK."
@JulesFlanagan @amandacarpenter He *is* an unindicted coconspirator to a felony. Seems pretty high crime-y to me.
@JohnCornyn You forgot the word “up.” Unemployment *up* to 3.9%.
@JohnCornyn @epheraldpost Democrats have a word for you John: nope. Elections have consequences.
@secupp It’s almost as if the president is an unindicted coconspirator to a felony who hasn’t been held accountable for his corruption for two years by a complicit party who gerrymandered their way into power. Or maybe this was just locker room talk.
@amandacarpenter It’s almost as if we have an unindicted coconspirator to a felony as president who hasn’t been held accountable for his corrupt enterprises for two years. Or maybe it was just locker room talk.

@RepDonBacon Have you tried asking Mexico nicely? Because Trump promised they would pay for it.
@RepMarkWalker Remind us again who said just days ago “I am proud to shut down the government.” Why are you trying to take credit away from the president for something he’s proud of?
@PhillyGuy_82 @IngrahamAngle Bravo, you got the first half right.
@marcorubio Yet you refuse to publicly acknowledge that your president is under Russia’s thumb you spineless coward. You know that makes you complicit in this right?
@GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan You lost me at decency

@PopeSpurdo @KG_ExGop @csd @deaconcruise @Amy_Siskind Grievance-mongering... is that the new name for Trump's twitter feed?
@KG_ExGop @csd @deaconcruise @Amy_Siskind It is not representative. THE most important priority for Dems in the primaries should be who has the best chance of beating Trump. I want a female president as much as anyone but if I had to pick right now I'd say that person is Beto O'Rourke. At least he's young.
@Amy_Siskind Um, have you seen his support within the GOP? You're living on another planet if think Trump would lose a primary.
@Gundlefinger16 @hrnk @lambwaffle @Floor_model @joncoopertweets And this was before people were siloed into their own media bubbles. Trump's approval will never drop below 40% as long as the economy is good, perhaps 35% if it tanks. @FoxNews will make sure of that.
@ryanstruyk @CNN So 28% of Democrats have learned nothing.
@sd3176 @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Funny how when the pro-assault rifle lot gets confronted with questions based on actual facts about shooting deaths they to go silent.
@JoeD24CT @Jim_Jordan The (minority of) American people voted for Mexico to pay for a wall. The GOP will lose even worse in 2020 than they did this year if they steal $5 billion from American taxpayers to fund this stupid wall.
@JoeD24CT @Jim_Jordan The (minority) of people voted for Mexico to pay for it.
@Yuri_Torchilo @sd3176 @ryanstruyk @benshapiro If it was easier to kill someone with a truck then why do more people choose to kill with guns than trucks?
@Yuri_Torchilo @sd3176 @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Which brings me to a question: if criminals are going to get their hands on illegal weapons anyway, why don’t we see more (any?) mass shootings with automatic weapons?
@Yuri_Torchilo @sd3176 @ryanstruyk @benshapiro I should say they’re the most effective weapon at killing *that can be obtained legally*
@Yuri_Torchilo @sd3176 @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Point being there’s a reason semi-automatic firearms are the weapon of choice for mass shooters. They’re most effective at rapid killing, period.
@BiigSxe @EWErickson It's great that you don't have to worry about your job opting out of covering your contraception due to "religious freedom." A lot of people do.
@BiigSxe @EWErickson The types of contraception you can get at Walgreens and CVS is definitively less effective than the types you have to get covered by health insurance. She's not wrong.

@conservmillen Then why did Trump lose college graduates by 21 points?? Almost like there's a direct relationship between progressivism and education.
@BadKarma5555 @Ocasio2018 I'm not sure where you get your numbers but by no metric is abortion its "primary role." What does your 96% to 4% number refer to? By the most generous metric less than 20% of their patients are there to get abortions and about 3% of the services they provide are abortions.
@BadKarma5555 @Ocasio2018 Wait do you actually think that taxpayers fund abortions anywhere?
@BadKarma5555 @Ocasio2018 This case wasn’t about abortion. At all. But cool?
@BadKarma5555 @Ocasio2018 Yeah I know how they decided, which was definitively a win for PP. The only dissenters were conservative judges. https://t.co/i6vWnAy7fg
@Nickarama1 @thehill ...they already had the Senate, which was a particularly unfavorable map for Dems this year. Democrats won the House by the largest margin of victory in history, took 40+ seats in heavily gerrymandered districts, and flipped 7 governorships. Yeah, it was disastrous.
@BadKarma5555 @Ocasio2018 Not happening. Thoughts and prayers on your golden boy Kavanaugh siding with Planned Parenthood today.
@USA_First_2016 @patrice_noonan @thatbillokeefe @EWErickson @TheRickWilson You should do a little research on how the GOP-perpetrated fraud was discovered in NC09 and many of your questions will be answered. It's pretty easy to see when 8 witnesses sign over 100 ballots, voting patterns are inconsistent with absentees requested, etc.
@USA_First_2016 @key2thehighway @thatbillokeefe @EWErickson @TheRickWilson Keep telling yourself that Republicans can't possibly be losing because people are actually voting against them. Despite their party leader's historically low approval ratings and major election losses it's going great. Don't change a thing.
@chadfelixg Uhh pretty sure no one on the left is declaring they were right about Kavanaugh after today's ruling. Doesn't mean they're not happy about being wrong.
@GOPLeader Kevin Kevin Kevin, it's what the *country* has chosen. That's why you have just 24 days left in the majority. Hope you enjoy all the oversight that's coming for you and Dear Leader.

@keith1212121212 @zellnor4ny And adding Abrams to the ticket would appeal to uber-progressives, women and POC who don’t want to see another pair of old white males take the White House. Just my take.
@keith1212121212 @zellnor4ny Not much policy-wise, but don’t tell the independents that. We all know minute policy differences between Democrats aren’t going to win this election. Personality wins elections, and he comes across as genuine and willing to represent ALL Americans. People will like that.
@keith1212121212 @zellnor4ny But it’s the most important policy to me. You didn’t ask what my favorite policy was that differentiated him from other Democrats🤷‍♀️
@keith1212121212 @zellnor4ny Pro choice.

@Nolagggggg @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Can you name a widely accepted Democratic proposal that involves taking guns from law abiding citizens?
@kkcstx @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro I don’t think we need more than one incident of mass murder with an accessory whose ownership isn’t protected by the constitution to know that they should be outlawed.
@Yuri_Torchilo @kkcstx @ryanstruyk @benshapiro No one has a right to use bump stocks.
@kkcstx @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Yeah “new laws” and gun bans are two different things. See: recent bump stock legislation.
@kkcstx @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro When did I mention a gun ban?
@Nolagggggg @Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro It’s not Democrats’ job to enforce laws that already exist.
@Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro You’re right we just shouldn’t have laws since people break them anyway.
@Yuri_Torchilo @ryanstruyk @benshapiro Yeah my neighborhood grocery store was closed on Sunday so police could gather evidence from the crime scene. Someone was shot inside the store. Forgive some of us for making gun safety a high priority everyday kitchen table issue.
@zellnor4ny A Beto/Stacey ticket in no particular order would absolutely slay 2020. No question.
@BBobbio71 @intheMatrixxx @POTUS What about now? Is today the day? Just let me know when I should come back to laugh at you.
@DanGarry @amber_athey @Harlan Apparently yes. They are. https://t.co/ZnhUfeTbwd
@NakatomiTim @Moneybagwell @williamrose3781 @Dalton1A @NBCNews If the real world means being at risk of getting shot in your local grocery store (a cashier was shot at my local grocery store this past Sunday), movie theater, school, etc then count me out. I'll take Australia where they haven't had a mass shooting in 20 years.
@Moneybagwell @NakatomiTim @williamrose3781 @Dalton1A @NBCNews The argument that Bible thumping will stop overdoses is the literal dumbest thing in the world evidenced by the very basic fact that the most Christian areas of the country (rural) are the most heavily affected my opioids. Next.
@PoxNewsCEO @lcmoser Totally agree.
@PoxNewsCEO @lcmoser I forget who but someone put it best that Dems need a candidate who commands a media universe outside of Trump's. Someone who people will tune in to just to watch them make dinner. Beto is that guy, people are excited about him now, and 2020 is his moment. I hope he runs.
@MostlyforMLB @lcmoser Came to say the same. If utterly normal and lovable Beto couldn't beat utterly detestable Ted Cruz, Texas ain't turning blue any time soon.
@knoxbraxton1 @Reuters If I had enough money to stay above what the government does, which for the most part I do aside from having a uterus that the GOP is trying their best to regulate, I would do stuff like this👇 before doing what's on your cover photo. But to each his own. https://t.co/AFIyfwmit3
@mvp2throne @BarnettNed @newsobserver In addition to what's in this article, the opioid legislation that passed through Congress in October is a good start. Addressing proven prevention and treatment solutions through legislation. Putting "God is love" in elementary schools is shall we say... unproven.
@mvp2throne @BarnettNed @newsobserver I definitely never said that. I think religion and opioid usage is completely unrelated, and you probably should too given that the facts contradict your assertion that Christianity is the answer to opioid addiction.
@mvp2throne @BarnettNed @newsobserver Obviously opioid addiction exists everywhere, but it is factually more prevalent in rural areas. Just look at the map. So again, if God was the answer to the opioid crisis then why are the most God-fearing areas of the state most affected?
@mvp2throne @BarnettNed @newsobserver Ok, some of the most God-fearing areas of the country are the ones with the problem. Typically people who go to church believe in God. Urban areas are definitively more secular and least affected by the opioid crisis.
@mvp2throne @BarnettNed @newsobserver If God was the answer to the opioid epidemic then why are the most church-going areas in the country the ones with the problem? Think about it.
@knoxbraxton1 @Reuters This isn’t about the pendulum swinging the other way, it’s about the party in power taking away the governing ability of the other party when it does.

@Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Definitely no Dec. 4th election guaranteed yet, but there will be ongoing lawsuits from the Abrams campaign until every vote is counted. He wishes he won, but it's not over yet.
@voir_dire4 @Vesuvia30 @KhaledBeydoun Unfortunately yes. He voted early where he works by the airport, which is a primarily black area. She voted early in what she describes as a "lily white" area and go figure her vote was accepted. Something is not right here.
@voir_dire4 @Vesuvia30 @KhaledBeydoun Update: friend in Atlanta just told me they checked and her husband's early vote was "not accepted" nor was one of her patient's absentee ballots. The cheating and corruption is widespread. Let's hope it is corrected in time🤞🤞🤞
@perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp That's awesome! I have nothing against religions that are positive and grew up going to a pretty inclusive church myself, but I experienced nothing but negativity and brainwashing from the evangelicals around us. My family called them the "colonial baptist cult" haha.
@AAC0519 @perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @secupp You said I was slurring "your religion" when the only religion I've even mentioned is evangelicalism, which was not in a slurring manner. You're being very confusing. I'm out.
@AAC0519 @perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @secupp And actually I know a lot about your religion. Have several friends who went to our neighborhood evangelical church. Two separate neighbors during my childhood who went to that church told my Jewish best friend she was going to hell. Only people who went to that church did that.
@AAC0519 @perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @secupp I fail to see how it was used as a slur but ok. It's simply a fact that evangelicals vote overwhelmingly against climate science.
@AAC0519 @perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @secupp What? Guy just said he got out of the evangelical church. https://t.co/ZgBgntsnrs

@perfect_zero33 @HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp I'm curious why anyone would want to "pass" on green energy and climate science. Yet here we are with half the country. Thank you for believing in science, (former?) evangelical.
@Tom11271845 @ElizabetGood @ChipsWithSalsa @Mystalope @KatiePavlich @mal1976retaf "Bully"😂😂😂	But when your president constantly personally insults and lies about people who respectfully disagree with him he's "telling it like it is." Please do some introspection and try again.
@ElizabetGood @ChipsWithSalsa @Mystalope @Tom11271845 @KatiePavlich @mal1976retaf I'll also take it you have no problem with your president saying he'd like to punch protesters in the face at his rallies, saying he'd pay legal fees of his supporters who do, and praising Gianforte in Montana for bodyslamming a journalist. You people are such fucking hypocrites.
@ElizabetGood @ChipsWithSalsa @Mystalope @Tom11271845 @KatiePavlich @mal1976retaf Please point me to the moment his hand was touching her. Screenshots appreciated.

@PressSec Hey Sarah how pissed are you that CNN isn't falling for your distraction tactic and has been reporting on POTUS's obstruction of justice all night? Oh and how you lost the House last night. Solid try at undermining freedom of the press though👍
@PressSec Hey Sarah tell us your thoughts on the president praising Gianforte for bodyslamming a reporter last week while I pull out the fainting couch for you.
@PressSec You mean the inappropriate multiple grabs at his mic by your WH staffer?
@PCNedStark Would also argue that cherry picked info from a Murdock-written article totaling less than 1000 votes nationwide over the course of many years does not exactly constitute a dead voter fraud crisis.
@PCNedStark Not what I asked.	I asked if you have any evidence that dead people vote for Democrats.	You don't.	Then you made the outlandish claim that dead people helped JFK win in 1960.	It's almost as if you subscribe to the same conpiracy theorist who told Trump that Cruz's dad killed JFK.
@SteveKingIA You may have narrowly eked out a victory last night but you will 100% be ridiculed as a white nationalist for the next two years and the rest of your life. And that will be satisfying to watch. Hopefully IA-04 is smarter next time.
@Vesuvia30 @GamecockAdam88 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun I wish I could be surprised that a Trumper just called a woman they've never met a bitch from behind the safety of his computer screen, but I'm not. It's no coincidence that the GOP is hemorrhaging women. He is very upset that they lost the House and is lashing out.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun I do want to raise your taxes though if you're rich because the tax scam just blew our deficit through the roof which will be fun for me and my children to pay off.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Cool I don't want to take your guns as long as you're a law abiding citizen who is of age and has passed a background check.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun For the record though, it's completely untrue that losing 25% of the US's GDP wouldn't affect you. It would drastically affect everyone living here.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Cool, same. Weird since as a Democrat I should be too lazy to own a business.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Remember when Trump said the election would be rigged because he thought he'd lose and also cries about the "rigged witch hunt" like every other day good times.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Same, which was the best case scenario for us. Glad we could agree on something.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Democrats are so lazy that the two bluest states makes up 25% of the US economy. By all means try to get rid of them and see how the red states do.
@GamecockAdam88 @Vesuvia30 @voir_dire4 @KhaledBeydoun Woooooow someone's mad at how last night went😂😂😂
@DukeChronicle @DukeAlumni For the love of God and country please say they're better than Stephen Miller.

@PCNedStark Keep telling yourself that's why you lost. Hope it helps you sleep at night as we investigate the shit out of Trump. That will be fun.🙃
@PCNedStark And yet it's still not about dead voters.
@PCNedStark this... isn't about dead voters. But cool?
@GamecockAdam88 @voir_dire4 @Vesuvia30 @KhaledBeydoun For making sure the entire vote is counted before conceding?😂😂😂😂😂😂
@PCNedStark Let's assume this Murdock-written article is factually correct and under 1000 votes have been cast over the course of many years across the country under deceased names. What evidence do you have what party they go to? For all you know those could have been 100% R votes.
@PCNedStark Source?
@PCNedStark Honest question. Do y'all have any evidence that this happens or is it just a story you have to tell yourselves to explain away your failures? It's ok I already know the answer. Of course there's no evidence. But it makes you feel better.
@gennadyvitorsky @mitchellvii You do realize the GOP elected two congressmen who are indicted on felony charges last night, right? Their names are Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter.
@PressSec You lying gaslighting garbage f*cking human. I truly hope the same Trump-loyalist karma that fell upon Jeff Sessions today falls upon you with the fury of a thousand suns. History will not treat you kindly.
@bessbell @PressSec Gaslighting, that's what.
@voir_dire4 @Vesuvia30 @KhaledBeydoun The count in GA is absolutely being contested. She doesn't have to beat him in count just yet, all she has to do is run down his vote share to below 50% and it will go to a runoff. That's what they're fighting for right now.
@mog1717 @BlazeroLight @guypbenson Actually I got curious and looked up abortion opinions among various demographics. They're expectedly very much correlated with religious views. And since many people's religious views are correlated with their moral values, you could really argue those are one and the same. https://t.co/YXetrjjgX7
@BlazeroLight @mog1717 @guypbenson Given that it's an issue that affects women and only women, I disagree.
@MikeBetz1981 @secupp I seem to remember a MAGA rally in Montana ((*checks notes*)) 4 days ago.
@BlazeroLight @mog1717 @guypbenson Pro-choice women everywhere would wholeheartedly disagree. It's no accident that 2 of the 3 GOP votes against ACA repeal came from women. GOP women including these two are also much more likely to be pro-choice than their male counterparts (see: Murkowski's Kavanaugh vote).
@mog1717 @guypbenson You'll hear crickets because they lost 8 of their 27 women in Congress last night. Democrats in contrast added 21 to their 78 congressional women. Not exactly a good showing for GOP women no matter how many governors races they cherrypick.
@guypbenson Sure Jan. https://t.co/Kp1FGNwQR3
@laurenelltalk @GOPChairwoman @VoteMarsha @kayiveyforgov @KristiNoem @KimReynoldsIA @YoungKimCD39 And yet, a clear pattern emerges. https://t.co/ieFUK5txA1

@laurenelltalk @GOPChairwoman @VoteMarsha @kayiveyforgov @KristiNoem @KimReynoldsIA @YoungKimCD39 That's great. Republicans also lost 10 of their measly 29 women in Congress last night. They're hemorrhaging women overall and the bleeding will continue.
@UniqueAndTrue @GOPChairwoman @Herbert_L_Reed By holding onto the mic that the WH staffer grabbed and tried to pull out of his hand? This is a delusional take.
@danpfeiffer Wednesday night massacre imminent.
@RyanCostello When you're so used to Republican gerrymandering that you think it's unfair when Dems win 50% of the House seats in a state that voted for a Democratic governor and senator🤪🙄

@TexLady2 @LordRevan104 @KatiePavlich @DailySignal It's not a "viewpoint" that he had the biggest electoral win since Reagan though. It's a lie.
@TexLady2 @LordRevan104 @KatiePavlich @DailySignal One small example. This is an easily fact checked number. Not a feeling and not an emotion. His own surrogates have said things like "we gave alternative facts to that" and "truth is not truth." Your side's war on facts is deeply disturbing. https://t.co/BOwaox5l5M
@TexLady2 @LordRevan104 @KatiePavlich @DailySignal I'm not talking about my emotions and feeling though.
@lamathews @AynRandPaulRyan Well barely, and they certainly don't make up all women. Hope &amp; change coming though maybe? https://t.co/HHXNVZjRe6
@lamathews @AynRandPaulRyan Or how women feel about being Republican...
@GOPChairwoman @VoteMarsha @kayiveyforgov @KristiNoem @KimReynoldsIA @YoungKimCD39 All 5 of them!
@TexLady2 @LordRevan104 @KatiePavlich @DailySignal That's because truth happens to not be pro Trump. Alternative facts and all.
@MichaelsOlu @PrisonPlanet I do actually, was just waiting for you to stop being so emotional. The answer is that in democracies we have something called "freedom of the press" which allows reporters to push back on and question the president's actions. That's not rude, that's called accountability.
@MichaelsOlu @PrisonPlanet You seem emotional.
@MichaelsOlu @PrisonPlanet Ah, I see you're already in one then.
@ElizabetGood @KatiePavlich @mal1976retaf See the thing is in a free country with a free press due to the 1st amendment you don't get to revoke press passes because you don't like the questions they ask😕. If you don't like the press challenging the president I hear Russia is nice this time of year.
@MichaelsOlu @PrisonPlanet Which is what makes America so great. If you don't like it, go live in a dictatorship. There are plenty that Trump could recommend to you.
@LordRevan104 @KatiePavlich @DailySignal Weird, the reporter who followed him and defended his professionalism didn't find him disrespectful. The only person who seems to find him disrespectful is the one doesn't like his questions.
@HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp I don't see how anything on my list goes against personal responsibility but whatever dude.
@HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp Well, you asked. And that's what most of us want.
@Djab451 @politicsmichael @secupp But to put that in perspective, when boomers were our age they elected Reagan and Bush overwhelmingly in 40+ states. Not really the same. Half of millennials are now parents and homeowners - they're not growing out of it.
@HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp Oh, and leaders willing to stand up to the NRA and enact common sense gun legislation
@HawkeyeWNC @emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp Good urban public schools, to lead in green energy, leaders to accept climate science, affordable single payer healthcare, to know social security won’t be gutted when we retire, not to make the rich richer while saddling our children with massive debt, women’s healthcare choices
@emilysumiko @AAC0519 @secupp Also a millennial who just turned 30 and wholeheartedly agree ✋. My husband‘s vote for Mitt Romney in 2012 was the last time he voted republican. He might never again the way they’re going.
@999draW @karringtonsc She lost😂😂😂
@david_dd63 @AdultEducation7 @karringtonsc Uhh no she didn’t 😂😂😂
@Christem @karringtonsc Congrats for what? She lost.
@CRNC Speaker Pelosi would disagree.
@Laporist @AbramsonFL @marcorubio Dems lost that number of seats because of Republican gerrymandering. The GOP won the popular vote by a smaller margin under Obama than Dems won tonight. If the US were gerrymandered in the opposite direction Dems would have picked up 80 seats.
@passportjoe @Redistrict @CookPolitical Really?
@MrXquisit1 @HalcyonTraveler @GeorgeTakei Except the House is gerrymandered such that Democrats have to win 6%+ of the popular vote to break even in the House so there's that.
@marcorubio *ehem* that's Speaker Pelosi to you, Rubio. Get fucked.

@SenShelby It really says something then that your party's leadership can't even get above 50% approval with an economy this good. Maybe it's because they're terrible people.
@Rep_Hunter @POTUS I think you should be apologizing to your wife who's still under that bus. I also think it's a sad commentary on the GOP that you'll likely get elected despite your multiple felony indictments but hey, democracy🤷‍♀️🤪
@jonfavs Um... the city he lives in? Using the word "lives" loosely of course as he spends most weekends golfing on Trump properties.
@mattgaetz He takes at least 3 hours of “executive time” each day to watch Fox News and tweet at celebrities who hurt his feelings WTF are you talking about
Alternative headline: Record turnout? More than half of millennials say they'll "probably" or "definitely" vote — that would shatter millennial turnout records. https://t.co/pU9lEficzV
@tedcruz Why would the left be funding the only thing that Republicans want to talk about right now? Not only is this blatantly false propaganda, it doesn't even make sense.
@maggieNYT If all of the "definitely" and just half of the "probably" respondents vote, that would surpass even presidential year turnout. This headline is garbage.
@FloridaGOP @NelsonForSenate Y'all really trying to play that "old career politician" game? https://t.co/dktqL4l39O
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan Not sure what there is to disagree on. He didn’t support Trump because he was too friendly to Jews. He supported two alt-right groups because they weren’t. Those are objective facts with no room for disagreement. But okay.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan Did you not do exactly that by calling him a leftist? I never called him a rightist. All I’ve done is state truthful facts about him and the groups he supports.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan I never said he was a conservative or represented conservatism by the way.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan No. But he aligned himself with alt-right movements and was not a "leftist" like you said. So you were wrong.
@JeffFlake Let us know when you're replaced by someone who will actually do something about it.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan You seem upset that you can't defend your incorrect earlier statement and are trying to change the subject.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan Who said I supported him? Truthfully I know little about him nor do I care. I simply stated facts about the synagogue shooter and you're making assumptions about me. Just stop.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @lsarsour @LouisFarrakhan Yeah they are. The fact remains that the synagogue shooter was an open supporter of Proud Boys and Unite the Right, both alt-right groups, and he posted conspiracy theories about prominent Democratic donor George Soros. To say he was a "leftist" is just not true.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP @realDonaldTrump I agree. But you said he was a leftist and you were wrong. I corrected you.
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP I mean I just schooled you on who the synagogue shooter actually aligns himself with but okay. #BeBest
@Scholten4Iowa @Abby4Iowa Just donated $10 to you after seeing @SteveKingIA is making his first ad buy today. We can't let him bring his hate back to Congress. You can do this!
@rn_gal @FloridaGOP Sure.	Please educate yourself on the synagogue shooter if you think he was a "leftist." Not liking Trump because he feels Trump is too friendly to Israel/Jews and was too hostile to the Unite the Right rally can best be described as alt-right. https://t.co/X7J95B0JpH

@scribunda @mcpli YAS👏👏👏
@FloridaGOP Here's a scarier thought that actually happened: a Florida Republican who was radicalized by the president's rhetoric and drove a van around with targets on Democrats' faces mailed them 13 live bombs last week.
@scribunda @mcpli It could mean a some of 2016's tepid Trump voters are staying home, and some of 2016's nonvoters are showing up to replace them. I'd imagine 2016 nonvoters would sway strongly to Beto over Cruz. But it could mean a lot of things. Here's hoping🤞🤞🤞
@SenThomTillis Now will you hold the president accountable his hateful, divisive and violence-inciting rhetoric? Doubtful.

@Ldismn2000 @FoxNewsResearch A conspiracy so deep that George Soros paid him to wear a MAGA hat at Trump rallies in 2017, and the deep state planted those stickers on the van he's been driving around in Florida. They really played the long game with this one🙄🤪 https://t.co/UDmgJEvjF6

@BarbaraComstock Barbara. The alternative is a member of the far right freedom caucus or predator-enabler Jim Jordan.

@juliuscaesarrex @FiveThirtyEight I never complained about anything. Simply stated facts.
@juliuscaesarrex @FiveThirtyEight Yeah I know how a republic works. You said “America hates the left.” If you meant America’s power structure hates the left because it gives their votes less weight then you’re right. But America’s people prefer the left. Evidenced by the fact that more Americans vote for them.

@thedreadedaw @ResearchHemp @yashar Or maybe the sad reality is many parents know their children wouldn't vote the same way as them so don't encourage them to do so. I know my father would prefer I didn't cancel his vote out every time😂
@WendyVerran @PhilBredesen I get your anger but realistically you have two choices: Blackburn or Bredesen. Blackburn would've voted yes in a heartbeat. I'm sure Bredesen would've supported replacing BK w/ a non-assaulter but Dems aren't in a position to decide that right now. With your vote they could be.
@WendyVerran @PhilBredesen If you have the privilege of being able to vote for a Democratic senator in a swing state please don't throw that away. Not voting Bredesen is accepting the Republican majority that has proven itself to be far more hostile to assault survivors than Democrats.
@WendyVerran @KimberlyTravel @NelsonLasm1989 @MoveOn @PhilBredesen @BetoORourke If you like Beto, voting Bredesen will empower him a hell of a lot more than the alternative. Think about it. If Beto wins but Bredesen loses by one vote, will you be regret being the reason Beto is in the minority? Or single handedly being the reason McConnell still has a gavel?
@sendavidperdue No poster for the time the president offered to pay legal fees for his supporters who punched rally protesters in the face?		Maybe that's because you're a political hack who doesn't care about "inciting dangerous behavior" when your side does it.

@ScottJenningsKY He. Is. Interviewing. For. A. Job. On. The. Supreme. Court.		Character matters. He said he's never blacked out from drinking. His friends have said he's never gotten aggressive when drinking. This story doesn't make either of those claims sound credible, or him for that matter.
@mattgaetz So "guts" to you means:	-Hiding documents	-Not talking to the only witness named in the incident	-Unnecessarily holding the vote before in arbitrary GOP-set deadline?		If you'd rather Roy Moore be in this seat, we know exactly what message you're sending about sexual assault.

@ScottJenningsKY This must be a reference to when Orrin Hatch said Anita Hill got her harassment claims from The Exorcist. You’re right, that was pretty awful. A shame he’s learned nothing since then and has already declared he thinks Dr. Ford is “mixed up.”
@ScottJenningsKY @joelockhart Of course it’s an excuse to delay, but the GOP is dismissing credible assault allegations (or outright calling the women liars) for the sake of expediency. I’d argue the latter is worse. Why no FBI investigation? Why no relevant witnesses? It’s obvious they don’t want the truth.

@FullMetalPantz @y2roby @jwd1967 @BrixBella @therealwolfram @beccamagee @cawilliamsp @KerouacRimbaud @HEINSLERJAN @JeffFlake Facts: Judge was named as there yet refuses to issue his denial under oath. Suspect. She was wearing a swimsuit. Why? This was probably the summer after her Freshman year &amp; his Junior. She informed her rep of the incident before BK was even nominated, how is that timing suspect?
@jwd1967 @FullMetalPantz @BrixBella @therealwolfram @beccamagee @cawilliamsp @KerouacRimbaud @HEINSLERJAN @JeffFlake And what good reason would he have to turn it down? That only gives her more credibility.
@cawilliamsp @SkyLightPattern @the_otto_show @beccamagee @KerouacRimbaud @HEINSLERJAN @JeffFlake I believe the law is that there is a statute of limitations for misdemeanors but not for felonies so it’s a little complex in MD.
@FullMetalPantz @BrixBella @therealwolfram @beccamagee @cawilliamsp @KerouacRimbaud @HEINSLERJAN @JeffFlake They could get Mark Judge to testify under oath for one.
@beccamagee @cawilliamsp @KerouacRimbaud @HEINSLERJAN @JeffFlake And did for Anita Hill. There is well established precedent for this.

@LindseyGrahamSC Wait wait wait.... you think ramming his nomination through without an FBI investigation (as Anita Hill was given) is going to HELP you in the midterms? Or have you given up on women's votes and just want to throw one last sexual predator onto the court for good measure?
@JeffFlake And there it is. Jeff, the GOP held Scalia's seat open for FOUR👏 HUNDRED👏  TWENTY👏  TWO👏  DAYS👏 . You're not running for re-election. You at least feign decency. Why? Unless, of course, you aren't decent at all.

@RexWolfen @FOX4 Exactly.
@goldengateblond Maybe we should ask Neil Gorsuch. He went to Georgetown Prep too🤔
@FOX4 Did she have weed in her house though?
@senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley You embarrassed when you said Anita Hill's story was inspired by the exorcist and you're embarrassing yourself now by saying you think Dr. Ford is "mixed up." Just stop.
@BrianKempGA David Duke endorsed Trump, and Trump endorsed you. So there's that.

@JonTurn13893341 @buttercup784eve @gutbomb48 @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly As a matter of logic, if I were an employer calling an interviewee's references, and one of them said "yeah he was a good employee aside from having a sexual harassment complaint filed against him a while back" — I'd be an idiot to hire him.
@gutbomb48 @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly Yeah because of a thing called the statute of limitations. Doesn't mean it didn't happen.
@aflyingmonk3y @ValKHeadley @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly I know what a fact is. The conspiracy theory is that her brother's workplace must mean she's lying about being sexually assaulted. Interesting that you think the many corroborated facts about her story mean nothing but that her brother's workplace does.
@aflyingmonk3y @ValKHeadley @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly Annnnd here come the conspiracy theories🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 https://t.co/kMlEMbgqjp
@aflyingmonk3y @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly Honest question. What sort of proof would you need in order to take her account seriously?
@ValKHeadley @washingtonpost 1) They were good friends: corroborated	2) They were drunk together often in high school: corroborated	3) She was assaulted by an elitist boys' school student who became a prominent member of DC: corroborated	4) "his mother handled his parents home foreclosure"... huh?
@ValKHeadley @aflyingmonk3y @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly I have more proof than you have that it's not true.
@ValKHeadley @aflyingmonk3y @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly "students 'from an elitist boys’ school' who went on to become 'highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington'" doesn't exactly leave the pool of candidates wide open.
@aflyingmonk3y @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly Also much of her story has been corroborated not only by her therapist's notes but by Kavanaugh and Judge's own high school yearbook. https://t.co/8XCLdoXO8q
@aflyingmonk3y @geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly If by "former employee" you mean former FBI agent then yes. I get how polygraphs work but in this scenario she's passed one, he hasn't. Let's see if Kavanaugh is willing to take one. https://t.co/57CJMXrdCb
@TrumpStudents When she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth. “I thought he might inadvertently kill me,” said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California. “He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.”
@Sammyjkramer @ToberLana @TrumpStudents Had to look up what was said in another window since they replied then blocked. I don't follow any Krassensteins and never did sooo🤔🤷‍♀️
@geezyloueezy @BillOReilly He actually didn't stop when she resisted, he covered her mouth to muffle her screams. It doesn't sound like you read the article.
@geezyloueezy @Maryinlq @BillOReilly Please tell us what's "highly doubtful" about 1) her telling her husband and therapist in 2012 about it 2) receipts existing in the form of her therapist's notes 3) her telling her rep about it before he was nominated and 4) her passing an FBI-administered polygraph?
@TrumpStudents Yeah, most women are Democrats. Most sexual assault victims are also women. Makes sense.		Roy Moore’s accusers were Trump voters and you still smeared them, so how is this relevant? And people wonder why the GOP is hemorrhaging female support🙄
@ScottJenningsKY What makes you think that a man who's discovered to have assaulted women his entire life would be destroyed because of that? Trump's still in office and you still support him don't you?
@tedcruz's strategy to make up the ground he's losing to @BetoORourke in small dollar donations: tricking old people with fake summons letters👀 https://t.co/cM8olbnypG
@WashTimes Name one time Trump has taken responsibility or apologized for anything since taking office, despite lying daily like yesterday's "3000 people did not die in Puerto Rico." The president denies actual loss of American life but God forbid a kid complains about expensive curtains.
@ScottJenningsKY After what McConnell did to Merrick Garland, Democrats can do whatever the fuk they want with this nominee. Republicans whining about him being treated poorly is absurd.
@JDallasR2 @DavidMDrucker @tedcruz @SalenaZito California liberals who... live in Texas?🤔

@EmerickTrent1 @TrumpStudents ? https://t.co/fdD3jKyQRU
@CoryBow21819563 @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP I have no idea what this has to do with anything and disagree with the assertion that the left is rarely intellectually honest when the leader of the GOP is rarely honest, period.
@SpeakerRyan @DeptVetAffairs The president says 3k people "didn't die" because of Maria and you're talking dollar amounts. Tax cuts for the rich blah blah blah. You will go down in history as being Trump's right hand man, and will be remembered accordingly.
@RepMarkWalker @GCSchoolsNC What do you have to say about the president's statement that 3,000 people didn't die because of Maria? Are you at all concerned he'll have the same attitude towards North Carolinians? Of course you're not, because NC voted for him and you're complicit in his grotesque narcissism.
@CoryBow21819563 @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP No, it is not a valid argument. Would you make the same argument that Gettysburg death tolls were overinflated because of all the men who died of injuries and infection days later? You know, medical ineptitude and all.
@CoryBow21819563 @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP No deaths were included that would have happened without the hurricane. That's not how the study was conducted.
@realDonaldTrump You are extremely sick. Democrats are right to want to impeach you, and Americans will never forget how you discounted the lives of fellow Americans while the rest of the @GOP turned a blind eye. Disgusting, disgraceful excuse for a human being.
@cmonealmd @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP To show the world that he never had any.
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Let me guess, it has to do with giving more tax cuts to rich people and not the fact that the president said the 3000 people who died in Maria were made up.
@sonneyjo @GOP Regurgitation of Alex Jones conspiracies and white supremacist talking points.
What kind of sick human* tweets on the day a hurricane is closing in on the east coast that deaths from Hurricane Maria were made up to make him look bad. I mean truly grotesque. @GOP leaders who say nothing, which will be the vast majority, are complicit. Vote them out. https://t.co/dYxUhXLNMc
@RepMarkWalker @RepRichmond Do you agree with the president that 3000 people did not die in Puerto Rico, and that the death toll was made up by Democrats? What will be your response if he says the death toll from Florence is made up as well? North Carolinians deserve to know.
@dorothygage1245 @Jen62912 @Faysdaughter2 @PPFA @DrLeanaWen You said you don’t want your tax dollars paying for abortions yet said not to cite the fact that they don’t. What?
@Jen62912 @Faysdaughter2 @PPFA @DrLeanaWen Because they're considered zygotes/embryos/fetuses, not people. This is defined by a thing called science which I know the right isn't fond of these days but that doesn't make it untrue. If you don't like abortions don't get one, and stay out of everyone else's uterus.
@BoisseauJudy @SpeakerRyan It's looking good, thanks!

@senorrinhatch I certainly hope Hillary Clinton is paying rent for all that space she's occupying in MAGA heads.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast We'll see.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast Interestingly the new map changes that district from a Trump +26 to a Trump +20 district, the exact amount by which Trump won the district that Conor Lamb flipped.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast I get that but this is not a blue district and does not encompass urban Pittsburgh. Trump won this district by 20 points less than a year and a half prior. https://t.co/DbZwXDuk4z
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast It literally did happen 6 months ago. PA-18.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast You haven't said which part is wrong and I wouldn't call a 15% flip (as happened with the VA state house last year) is a small percentage, but ok. If 15% of Congress flips Dems have control of both houses.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast Pennsylvania hasn't had an election since 2016 for those 100 state senators. Only a primary and one special election which flipped from red to blue. So which part specifically is wrong?
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast It has happened. I'm referring to all seats not just national Senate of which there's of course only been one election since 2016. If I'm being precise it looks like the latest count is actually at 43 as of June. https://t.co/4MYilKmC54
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast That and the 50 other seats that have flipped from red to blue since his election.
@JoeyCortese45 Congrats on your political suicide! 69% of Americans don't support overturning Roe, including a majority of Republicans.
@usmcalla362 @senorrinhatch @dailybeast Is that why the GOP lost a senate seat in Alabama after he was elected? So much winning!
@senorrinhatch @dailybeast What ever will the GOP do when Hillary Clinton isn’t on the ballot? Lose, probably.
@dethroned69 @sahilkapur @BretBaier If reports were that democrats were way ahead don’t you think that would make democrats complacent and motivate republicans to vote? Serious question. Maybe you should reevaluate your conspiracy theory.
@senorrinhatch What exactly then do you call the thousands you've taken from corporate donors and the NRA?
@LindseyGrahamSC It is increasingly clear you have been compromised. https://t.co/1wWr7UThn5
@senorrinhatch Where was your loyalty to the Constitution when Merrick Garland was nominated by a duly elected president? Your only loyalty is to the GOP, not this country. Good riddance.

@Ron_Renaud @realhasret @Michael_RM @Ocasio2018 Ever occur to you that a woman might laugh in your face if you told her that? Or cry because she doesn't have anyone in her life that celebrates her pregnancy? Or that she doesn't want to be a mom, ever? Or that her future is more precious to her than a baby? Of course it didn't.
@GOPChairwoman Good thing the pedophile you endorsed for Alabama Senate lost or he would have had to stay 100 feet from the building.

@marcorubio @NYT Are you suggesting we vote for Democrats because you and your colleagues refuse to do your sworn duty of checking this president? Don’t worry, we’re planning on it.
@JimFrancisLA01 Or just imagine a country where a school shooting is controversial.
@ScottJenningsKY If the president is too mentally deficient to realize documents that he was supposed to sign aren't on his desk, and all signs point to him having both the mental capacity and attention span of a goldfish, then yes. They recognize that he is unwell and are acting accordingly.
@SpeakerRyan Hope he enjoys his 2 months in Congress!

@glockthisway @tedcruz Every Senator affects American especially when one party’s majority is as razor thin as it is, so I respectfully will not.
@FraudulentCNN @RajShah45 You're citing the poll about Neil Gorsuch. That article says there's higher support for not confirming Kavanaugh than confirming. Looks like you need to check yourself before accusing others of making fake claims😕 https://t.co/n6lOf5CO9r
@FraudulentCNN @RajShah45 How does this disprove what I said and why are you quoting a poll about Neil Gorsuch? This article says 39% don't want Kavanaugh confirmed and 38% do.

@tedcruz "...and so I'm grateful that people are willing to do that. I understand that people can come down to a different conclusion on this issue, and I respect that as well. That's American as well. But those are my feelings on the issue and I'm grateful for the question."
@tedcruz "...(when) someone is willing to call attention to (injustice) to try to awaken our conscience to force us to do the right thing in the face of that injustice and violence, and to do so peacefully and nonviolently, I think there is something inherently American about that."

@thatdude1019 @SteveScalise No I'm not for free tuition, but obviously the cost is now out of control. As for healthcare I'm not against M4A but if your issue is with subsidizing other people's healthcare, the young &amp; healthy are already doing that. I'm for equal price regardless of your health situation.
@mynameissquatch @thatdude1019 @SteveScalise Right. Glad we're in agreement.
@thatdude1019 @SteveScalise I don't really know how to address your question since I take personal responsibility for myself as do all of my "leftist" friends, and none of us subscribe to any of the ideology you just listed.

@GOP And?	McConnell was 100% transparent about delaying Merrick Garland's nomination for the sake of delaying it until after the election. So y'all can dish it out but can't take it then?
@SteveScalise If you think violent rhetoric is only coming from one side you're not paying attention. But you don't really think that, do you? Just stoking division as POTUS does with his violent rally rhetoric.

@dcexaminer This has got to be satire. The Kochs gave $500k to Paul Ryan days after he passed their tax scam — a drop in the bucket compared to the windfall he got them in tax cuts. Meanwhile the GOP opposes raising minimum wage above $7.25.
@FloridaGOP Holdup, the GOP is worried about &lt;checks notes&gt; THREE false statements made over the last few months? Have you checked POTUS' twitter feed I dunno yesterday when he made up a fake approval rating the day after John McCain died? 		Your morally bankrupt party has zero credibility.

@neillisaward @CoreyStewartVA @ICEgov Actually both has limits. You can’t yell fire in a crowded theater and you can’t own automatic rifles, for example.
@CoreyStewartVA No, you’re the party of murdered Americans. What are you doing about common sense gun control? Nothing. https://t.co/KOoVK1ov2X
@O2supply @CoreyStewartVA @ICEgov White men perpetrate more mass shootings than any other group of people yet Corey can’t wait to put an immigrant on blast for a person’s murder, of which 47 happen every day. Maybe he should rethink his approach.
@neillisaward @CoreyStewartVA @ICEgov I’m actually just pointing out Corey’s racist generalization of a group of people for the actions of 1. The bill of rights doesn’t give you the right to own whatever firearm you want. Clinton illegalized the type of weapon most of these men used, &amp; it was reversed 10 years later.
@HoyasJournalism @CoreyStewartVA @ICEgov 96 Americans are killed every day from gun violence by fellow Americans. Your selective outrage and fear-mongering aimed at immigrant boogeymen is more than transparent. Where's your outrage at the prominent Republican who had been employing him for years?
@CoreyStewartVA @ICEgov Aye yo race baiter: If this isn't about race, where's your outrage for the 148 Americans who were killed by these few gun-wielding white men over the last 6 years?		I'll wait on your call to deport all gun-owning white American men. https://t.co/boM4NuKuCx
@Tony32594004 @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal I find it hard to take your claims of bias seriously when you just made up your previous false statement. At least the information in their article was accurate, unlike your tweet.

@hipstersawyer @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal The brainwashing of Fox viewers into believing everything they say is gospel when their stories are as easily disproven and false as Brian Flood's (who happened to also write the article you just referenced) is not a good thing.
@hipstersawyer @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal And try https://t.co/TQ7Ab2yAiq for info on website viewership statistics. As you can see, CNN ranks 109th globally and 29th in the United States. Fox ranks 218th globally and 47th in the United States.
@based_patrick @hipstersawyer @oliverdarcy @briansflood @mattmittenthal I know. It's in reference to the "you're less trusted by the public" comment.
@hipstersawyer @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal That is simply not true. https://t.co/mvzRMv3V4x
@burzerker @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal Yeah, and they reported that.
@ebaso2 @oliverdarcy @based_patrick @briansflood @mattmittenthal Try reading some of the comments about how often the story was also talked about on air when it broke since you clearly don’t watch.
@based_patrick @oliverdarcy @briansflood @mattmittenthal It was also mentioned many times on CNN's air last night and this morning.
@briansflood @DanParzych @oliverdarcy I learned that your story shouldn't completely contradict your headline in News Writing 101.
@briansflood @mattmittenthal @oliverdarcy Then why does your headline say CNN ignored the story? Pretty clear they did not.
@briansflood @oliverdarcy CNN "ignored" it but only featured it as one of 3 stories on their homepage but only mentioned it on air 10 times but didn't give it wall-to-wall coverage on the day Manafort &amp; Cohen are found guilty of 8 crimes each but but but but.... your story is why Fox is a laughingstock.

@Jay00081 @OK_Dumbass @BiggestThinks @CoreyStewartVA @UNC I'm talking about what happened last night at UNC. I'm not sure why you think I support Antifa other than believing Corey Stewart's false association of what happened at UNC last night with that group.
@Jay00081 @OK_Dumbass @BiggestThinks @CoreyStewartVA @UNC I'm not sure who you're under the impression these people were terrorizing. Looked like everyone there was pretty happy to me.
@OK_Dumbass @BiggestThinks @Jay00081 @CoreyStewartVA @UNC And how horrific for the families of those killed who have to endure ongoing harassment from conspiracy theorists like this person and their peddlers like Alex Jones.
@JohnBladeClark @CoreyStewartVA @novagran @UNC Oh, you think it's going to be repaired and restored. You must not know Chapel Hill.
@Jay00081 @HarryTHop Ok, looked that guy up. He stabbed a woman in her home. Had nothing to do with protests or Antifa.
@Genseric123 @CoreyStewartVA @UNC He was also a neo-Nazi. Most schizophrenic people function normally without attending white supremacist rallies and driving cars into crowds of people. If he were Muslim would you be saying "it's mental illness not politics"? Seriously ask yourself this question.
@Jay00081 @HarryTHop Uhh no they didn't. Please join us here on planet facts.
@BiggestThinks @Jay00081 @OK_Dumbass @CoreyStewartVA @UNC I'm uninterested in whatever conspiracy theory you're both subscribing to where a neo-Nazi didn't plow into a crowd and kill a young woman via blunt force trauma to the chest. Truth is truth, and that's what happened.
@DodgingThat @TrumpStudents "Knock the crap out of him, would ya? I promise you, I will pay your legal fees"		"I'd like to punch him in the face"		"Grab 'em by the pussy"		Nazis are "very fine people"		...and that's just your president, students. But lecture us again on who's disgusting and dangerous.
@brooksatford @CoreyStewartVA @GrayceEnmerci @UNC As a former resident of Chapel Hill, I can tell you printing their names in the local papers would do nothing but inform people who they should thank. Most of Chapel Hill is happy about this.

@LahtiLinda @DougHeye @jaketapper Keep in mind the students and local residents have been calling for Silent Sam's removal as far back as the 60's. Chapel Hill is truly a liberal bastion in a purple state. As a progressive myself, I loved living there.

@JackLamb1957 @GeigerNews @senorrinhatch Yeah, Barack Obama won an election. Twice. If they can hold off Obama's SCOTUS nominee for 9 months we can certainly hold off Trump's for 3. Let's see what consequence this year's election has.
@RobertBronson10 @TrumpStudents Not trying to mislead anyone. Just pointing out the glaring hypocrisy of this list when the GOP's president is facing 16+ sexual misconduct allegations &amp; has no female leadership in Congress. To say they're the party of women because of the spokeswomen they hired is laughable.
@RepMarkWalker If one of your rich donors saves $32,753 and person making minimum wage saves $1, they save an average of $16,736. Your donors are definitely better off now, especially the ones who donated $500k to Paul Ryan 13 days after the #TaxScam was passed. https://t.co/fI9QWk51BR
@RepMarkWalker @SenatorTimScott What good do opportunities do if real wages are status quo or lower with healthcare costs skyrocketing? Who can actually make a living on North Carolina's $7.25/hr minimum wage? The tax scam just made your rich donors richer, period. https://t.co/XSWgI0YD2W
@RobertBronson10 @TrumpStudents I was not at all trying to confuse speaker of the house and spokesperson, simply trying to save on characters. Any somewhat politically informed person should know the difference. Regardless, Speaker is a vastly higher ranking position than GOP spokesperson.
@RobertBronson10 @TrumpStudents You said Kayleigh was the spokesperson then said I was lying about something. What did I lie about?
@RobertBronson10 @TrumpStudents Speaker of the House. That would be Paul Ryan.
@TrumpStudents GOP President = Man (facing sexual misconduct allegations)	GOP Speaker = Man	GOP Frontrunner for 2019 Speaker = Man (facing pedophile coverup allegations)	GOP Majority Leader = Man	GOP Women in Congress = 27	Democratic Women in Congress = 78		Students, you are very bad at this.
@CoreyStewartVA @realDonaldTrump 1) Who is saying that? Cite your sources.	2) The best thing you could do to help re-elect Tim Kaine is run on Trump's agenda. By all means, please continue.
@lilbityzer @senorrinhatch @PamCouch87 Was it an “anti America game” when Mitch McConnell refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing for 10 months? Or is it only ok when they do it?
@RobApplelatina @CNN This poll is from 3 months before the election. Also, Clinton won by 3%.
@BrianKempGA Dude you enthusiastically accepted the endorsement of a billionaire who said evading paying his fair share of taxes made him smart.

@CoreyStewartVA Except that Virginia is the 8th wealthiest state in the country.
@senorrinhatch I learned that the president gave a wink to white supremacists, and that the rest of your party didn’t care. I will never vote R as long as I Iive.
@TrumpStudents Oh NOW it’s not ok to attack law enforcement? Only when they’re not investigating dear leader, right? How many Trump tweets should I reference where he attacks the FBI, special counsel, CIA, judicial branch... take several seats.
@TrumpStudents @Ocasio2018 @RealCandaceO @benshapiro She was trying to debate the man she was RUNNING AGAINST, not random twitter pundits. Why would she ever debate people who aren’t even running for office?
@TrumpStudents @NFL Oh but Alex Jones should be allowed to post his hateful conspiracy theories to any private company's platform because *free speech* right? You guys are such hypocrites it's laughable. https://t.co/cH60JY9zgl

@RepMarkWalker If you have to keep reminding people how much better they're off now, they're not.
@StrawPeddler @LanceYoungbloo1 @Roastwsu @Jim_Jordan @jack That’s like saying being dyslexic isn’t a far reach from being a sexual predator because both are birth defects. What?
@BrianKempGA The president is clearly hiding something in the tax returns that he refuses to release but do go on about your concern over Stacey’s back taxes.
@BrianKempGA The president hasn’t even released his taxes. Why no concern for what he’s hiding?
@LanceYoungbloo1 @Roastwsu @Jim_Jordan @jack The fallacies of that bigoted argument being your assumption that male-to-female trans people are automatically sexual predators and that they’re even sexually attracted to women.
@EdWorthy10 @FrankLuntz False. Cite any poll that showed he was ever losing badly.
@JRayBroker @mnsports3 @FrankLuntz One win, sure. But there‘s about 60 seats up for grabs in November that are bluer than this one, and D’s only need 23 of them to win the house. R’s should be sweating. Hard.
@felynerose @RKJ65 @realDonaldTrump Building a school for at-risk youth with all that money he makes from ball bouncing makes him a good American though. In contrast to a terrible president, American, and person who created a fake university to scam people out of money.
@truth4lifegod "isn’t that brainwashing 101 keep repeating the same thing with no context" ...like... MAGA?🤔

@1DeplorableSam @GwenMchone @brownbear39 @marinmaven @kimguilfoyle On race relations specifically, black support was solidly Republican (Lincoln=emancipation) until FDR. It was then fairly split until LBJ's Republican opponent opposed the Civil Rights Act, solidifying the black community's migration to the Democratic party ever since.
@1DeplorableSam @GwenMchone @brownbear39 @marinmaven @kimguilfoyle You're right it was not a simple platform switch and happened over the course of many years and milestones but unfortunately Twitter doesn't allow for that level of nuance. I'll elaborate.
@1DeplorableSam @GwenMchone @brownbear39 @marinmaven @kimguilfoyle Which part?
@GwenMchone @brownbear39 @marinmaven @kimguilfoyle This line is getting tired. The parties switched platforms when Lyndon Johnson supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Democrats have lost the majority of white support in every election since. David Duke endorsed and continues to support Trump today. So there's your history.
@TrumpStudents Sure. https://t.co/tURVrpg0cj
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery To be clear I was 9 years old when that happened so didn't really know what was going on but am confident I would have been just as against his behavior then as I am against women being preyed upon by men in power now😬
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery More people need to try to find common ground with those on the other side of the aisle rather than demonizing them as the most extremist on every issue. I realize Twitter is a horrible forum for that, but it's possible even here🙃
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery So, building a ridiculously expensive wall that taxpayers will foot the bill for only goes so far if people are flying here and overstaying visas, and employers are still hiring them.
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Sure. I am all for trying to curb illegal immigration, but more importantly, as Bill mentioned, cracking down on those who hire people illegally. If there is no motivation for people to come here, that's a big step in itself. Also most people here illegally overstay visas.
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery So, do as I say not as I do? Wow. Thank the Lord I don't have a young child to raise during this presidency so I don't have to explain what a pussy or porn star is.
@1960barbie @sharkbyte8 @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery It seems like you're saying you don't care that he's vile, but are calling Dems the vile ones. Dems are simply responding to the constant barrage of childish insults and attacks thrown at them by him and his administration.
@1960barbie @sharkbyte8 @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery I was mostly posing that question to Michael who says he voted for Trump yet posted a tweet about loving other countries and your wife.
@1960barbie @sharkbyte8 @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Seems you don't *want* to square it because you can't. You are assuming a lot of things about me simply because I'm not a Republican. This might surprise you but I'm not a Republican because I feel the exact same way: that they want to conform their narrow views on everyone else.
@1960barbie @sharkbyte8 @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Very very few liberals are actually the words I said. I'm willing to bet Michael wouldn't have described himself as a liberal but correct me if I'm wrong. The Democratic party of your generation was very different than mine.
@1960barbie @sharkbyte8 @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Vile??? See I'm genuinely curious how you come to that conclusion yet still support Trump. He calls Americans "haters &amp; losers" if they disagree with him, makes up childish nicknames for opponents, race baits, grabs women by the pussy. He's the most vile person I've ever seen.
@sharkbyte8 @1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Out of curiosity how do you square this tweet with support for your anti-immigration, anti-NATO, thrice-married, open womanizer president? https://t.co/WvfiJhAXTa

@1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery It's called independents. They now make up a plurality of voters. And yes some voted for Trump, some Dems stayed home. Very very few "liberals" voted for Trump. Also most people voted for someone not named Trump. More voted for Clinton.
@chuckwoolery If David is a tyrant for using the *literal exact words* Trump used in a tweet to Iran, wouldn't that make Trump a tyrant too?🤔
@1960barbie @Sherrys_Lane @chuckwoolery Is that why Republicans have lost 10% of their registered voters since 2015? lol

@UncaD @loris0428 @TrumpStudents Feel free to say "I told you so" if that ever happens. I will be here.
@UncaD @loris0428 @TrumpStudents Simply using data. He's the only president who's never hit 50% approval, and his approval has trended down or remained relatively stable since inauguration. He's open about having no desire to appeal to those outside his 35% base, so the 50+% who hate him will never be won over.
@UncaD @loris0428 @TrumpStudents It was below 50% at this time but still higher than Trump's. Trump has never surpassed Obama's approval at the same time in his presidency. Obama also hit above 50% at multiple points throughout his presidency — something Trump will never experience.
@TrumpStudents When you gotta gloat that the highest approval rating of his presidency is below 50%😂😂😂
@M26Nat @TrumpStudents We have realized you don’t believe anything not said by Trump or Fox for a long time. We have given up on you. We‘re focusing on turning out democrats and independents who overwhelmingly disapprove of him. Hope that clears it up for you.

@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL The opposite of abstinence only is not an animal love farm whatever that means. I was educated on safe sex and am happily married, never been pregnant or had an STD. If you want people to take personal responsibility why are you so afraid of them having choices?
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL I do. I pay for my own health insurance, which thankfully covered my IUD.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL There's actually a theory that the result of legalized abortion was a severe drop in violent crime roughly 20 years later. This is a correlation whose cause can't be determined for sure, but the fact remains that violent crime dropped significantly ~20 years post-Roe. https://t.co/NL1WB2e8aW
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL Divorce rates are actually at a 40 year low, and there would be SO many more teen moms and single parents abortion were nonexistent. There's no proof that safe sex education is associated with any of the things you just listed so please come back when you have facts to present.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL I'm not talking about condoms. You don't have to see a doctor to get those. I'm talking about birth control pills and IUDs. Both are longer lasting and more effective than condoms, and more importantly have other healthcare functions.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL Study after study has shown that that abstinence-only education doesn't work, so that's not true.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL I have never advocated for free condoms or taxpayers paying for abortions so let's start there. I advocate for safe abortion access, and health insurance coverage for long term birth control. Removing both would not make abortions nonexistent, it would make them unsafe.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL Abstinence-only education does not promote personal responsibility, it promotes sexual ignorance &amp; increases abortion. Birth control also has MANY uses other than pregnancy prevention, which you might know if you were a woman. It should be treated like any other medication.
@POrgan4 @sethgambee @JordanUhl @NARAL Best of luck exercising 70% of America.
@POrgan4 @sethgambee @JordanUhl @NARAL How pro-life of you, P.
@sethgambee @POrgan4 @JordanUhl @NARAL Actually conservatives who advocate for abstinence-only education, defunding of organizations that provide affordable birth control, and for allowing companies to remove birth control from their health insurance coverage prevents a lot of people from having responsible sex.

Trump continues to say he believes Russia over American intelligence, and couldn't even confront Putin to his face. You see that as being strong on Russia?😂
@MarCurtis Is video of the Helsinki press conference “real” info? Because there he said he believed Putin, who was very “strong and powerful” in his denials of what American intelligence says.

@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Well there's something we can agree on. Have a nice day too🙃
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama You're doing the same thing. Trump is our president now. How about we talk about him.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama You're declining then. I see why.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Trump and Hannity talk every night after his show airs. Don Jr is dating Kimberly Guilfoyle. Please.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Ok, what has CNN reported in the last 30 days that has been untrue? Feel free to compare that to falsehoods said by Trump in the same time period and we'll see who's in the "fact business."
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Facts tend to be anti-Trump. Media is in the fact business. Hence, media appears anti-Trump.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama When has another journalist yelled at Acosta to shut up?
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Are you seriously not putting Fox on this list? Or do you just consider them entertainment? Why do you hold the media to a higher standard of truth than the president? At least the media corrects themselves &amp; retracts when they get something wrong. That's more than Trump can say.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama And Trump says he believes them over American intelligence. Should she have accepted money from them? Probably not. But she advocates for LGBT rights at home. Trump tells them they can't serve in the military and chooses a VP who supports conversion therapy.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Lying and then telling his followers not to trust the media who fact check him is his playbook that shows no sign of changing.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama I don't think either walk on water, but both are tremendously better people than Trump policy aside. You don't have to be an experienced politician to know how to read numbers and not lie about them. He hasn't shown any inclination to do that in a year and a half.
@Walker4NC The people working to remove a president who sides with Putin over American intelligence are the true patriots. Full stop.		Good luck spreading your message of "hope &amp; positivity" with the insulter-in-chief in the White House. We will vote all you enablers out in November.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama That was said before people could sign up for the ACA but I'll give it to you anyway. 1 lie. Do you admit then that Trump has lied hundreds of times since taking office then? Such as Monday's "the electoral college is much more advantageous for democrats"?
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Difference being, Obama saying "if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor" was not false at the time it was said. Trump has said hundreds of things that have been false at the time they were said.
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Saying legislation is supposed to work one way and that not working out is very different than saying something like "I had the biggest electoral college win since Reagan" (easily disproven at time it was said) or that "we do have a trade deficit with Canada" (we have a surplus).
@HylanderMacLeod @aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Yes the ACA was screwed up for MANY complex reasons, but later being wrong is different than lying.		I don't dislike republicans. I dislike seeing otherwise rational people disregard the daily demonstrably false lies coming out of the WH. Like, numbers that are easily disproven.
@aec4444 @FoxNews @BarackObama Got any examples other than this, which was intended to be true before red states undermined how the ACA was supposed to work? Because Trump lies about actual numbers and his followers don't seem to care. Remember "I had the biggest electoral college win since Reagan?"🙄🙄
@BrianKempGA And how in the actual fuck does he "put Americans &amp; our security first" when he says he believes Putin's word over AMERICAN intelligence? That does neither. Are you deranged, power-hungry, or simply a complicit traitor?
@BrianKempGA I think you meant to say Americans picked their president *because of* Russians. Our country will be a better place if the president would just accept the reality that they attacked our democracy.
@JoeyCortese45 For which country?
@TrumpStudents Veterans don't fight to have their president discredit American intelligence and kowtow to Vladimir Putin.
@BarbaraComstock At least if riders can’t get where they’re going they won’t have to worry about getting shot at work or at school. How much have you taken from the NRA again?		Oh yeah, and Trump is a Russian puppet. How will you hold him accountable? You won’t. @JenniferWexton will.
RT @TeenVogue: oh absolutely not https://t.co/OJbSZHitRJ
@RyanLoFurno @davidhogg111 Exposing the NRA for what they are and thereby releasing their grasp on politicians will allow common sense safety laws to be passed, saving lives.
@DLoesch Puppet NRA is Russian-owned.
@ARussianTroll2 @knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter Don't see what's funny about Trump's cult-like following and affinity for dictators but I'll try to find the humor in that sometime after November.
@ARussianTroll2 @knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter I don't think so either, because he didn't claim to be able to shoot someone on 5th avenue and not lose any voters. And he wouldn't have been right if he had.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany ...and then he stood next to Putin and said he believed him over American intelligence. Good try, treason barbie, but your boy is compromised.
Oooh it "better not happen again." Putin's really sh*ttin' his britches now, comrade Mitch.🙄🙄🙄 https://t.co/3mat7VNAT3
@RepRickAllen How are we supposed to ensure this never happens again if the president won't even admit that it happened? This statement shows you are complicit at best, a traitor at worst. Either way you'll never hold our "president" accountable for yesterday's televised treason.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman PLEASE IGNORE THE TREASON
@ARussianTroll2 @knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter Same same
@RepMiaLove Have you lost your actual mind? Back to business for the GOP after your president committed treason on live TV yesterday... okay then.
@TrumpStudents Ask the farmers in Indiana that. https://t.co/Sd0UJcVQ6j
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP I was better off when we weren't controlled by Putin, thanks tho😘
@gt5841b @FilmFatale_NYC @mesteffes As a white lady who also knew from day one he was trash, I don't know how to get through to the 53% of my fellow white ladies any more than you do🤷‍♀️
@StruxMel @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter You believe Putin over American intelligence. Wow. I will pray for you to become a patriot again one day🙏🇺🇸. Adios comrade👋
@StruxMel @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter That’s what Trump wants you to believe so he doesn’t have to be held accountable for anything they find on him. Of course you’re falling right for it because you don’t want to believe he’s ever done anything wrong. That’s extremely dangerous &amp; leaves his power utterly unchecked.
@ARussianTroll2 @knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter Apparently anyone who disagrees with anything Dear Leader does is no longer considered a Republican by the base.
@knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter And 13 more from February, plus 3 Russian companies.
@knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter Trump said he’d like to punch his rally protestors in the face and that he’d pay the legal bills of those who did. Maxine Waters said to make a crowd and tell WH officials they’re not welcome. That really the hill you want to die on?
@RickSaccone4PA And you believe this is true because Putin says so? Wow.
@Rstreet212 @RickSaccone4PA I don't have Soviet flags hanging in my garage, and I believe in American intelligence over Putin's word. That's more than Trump can say.
@RickSaccone4PA People aren't mad that he talked to Putin, they're mad that he stated to the world that he believed Putin over AMERICAN intelligence. I know you know this, you're just trying to spin it somehow into not a horrible thing. Traitor.
@knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter Is Dan Coats a RINO? Is Paul Ryan a RINO? Is Mitch McConnell a RINO? Is Nikki Haley a RINO? Is Orrin Hatch a RINO? By your standards, I can't find many "real" Republicans left.
@knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter No, I mean all of them. Is Trey Gowdy a "RINO" to you? You know, the one who went in on Strzok for 10 hours the other day? Direct quote from him: "Russia attacked this country in 2016."
@knowledgeseekn @TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter His own director of national intelligence said they meddled, and Trump says he has no reason not to believe Putin. That's taking sides. Two FBI agents texting each other about Trump being an idiot doesn't discount indictments of 25 Russians for as much. Even the GOP accepts this.
RT @billyeichner: RT if you think we should impeach Trump and replace him with these two. https://t.co/6RDI1wOjmy
@TrumpStudents @AnnCoulter If your problem is with people's reactions and not the fact that Trump sided with Putin over American intelligence today, you're doing "America first" wrong.
@TrumpStudents So you're done with America first then? Tell us, do you believe U.S. intelligence or Putin like Trump does?
@RepComstock Oh, we all understand just fine. What you should be saying (but won't) is THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND.
@RepComstock Another sad tweet with no proposed action, no direct criticism of dear leader. That's okay, @JenniferWexton will actually act to protect our democracy after she takes your place in November.
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio It should also be noted that he didn't blurt it out because the "stress of the burden" became "too much for him" as you asserted earlier. Sounded more like careless boasting that they had dirt on a political opponent to me.
@dcexaminer Well he did choose a tyrant over US intelligence today. This is simply fact.
@dcexaminer So they have something on him too then.
@CollinRugg @HillaryClinton And you're taking Putin's word as gospel. So who's the traitor?
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio Well Republican leaders of the House Intel Committee say that's the case so feel free to take that up with them. That's their assessment not mine.
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio What are you under the impression that I misunderstand about the Steele dossier? That it was democrat funded and started the Mueller investigation? Well it's not what started the investigation, it started because of George Papadopoulos' big mouth.
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio See also: him defending his right to pardon himself, quite literally putting himself above the law. https://t.co/XLtBvVhZvy
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio Yeah, rule of law. The GOP is actively trying to dismantle the *law enforcement investigation* into what happened in 2016. Trump said he believes Putin over our own *law enforcement agencies*. Dismantling this investigation would literally be putting government above the law.
@tammytabby @OliverMcGee @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Wrong. And in case you missed it, he stood next to Putin today and said he believed him over our own intelligence. America first!	https://t.co/BMFHGihLBA
@honoraryamerica @LYNIS @marcorubio "According to Putin"	America first, right?
@TheDisaffected1 @FoxNews @POTUS @brookefoxnews He praises undemocratic dictators while actively alienating and insulting our allies. The defense that he just wants peace would make an ounce of sense if he treated our allies like he does Putin. He does not.

@zap1975 @SenThomTillis We look forward to that follow-up statement any moment now...🙄🙄🙄
@JoeMoma05128689 @TeamCavuto Trump won't even admit there were "Russian efforts." He said today he believes Putin. Whose team are you on?

@jtaylortowry @CNN @TheJusticeDept 25 Russians &amp; 3 Russian companies have been indicted for attacking our democracy, and Trump just said he has no reason to believe that happened because Putin says they didn't do it. Tell us how that makes him pro-America. He is a treasonous coward.
Last two words of the #TreasonSummit: "witch hunt."		Where are our GOP patriots condemning this disgrace?
Trump asked if he believes US intelligence or Putin. "[Putin] just said it's not Russia... I don't see any reason why it would be."		Asking if the Russian government has any compromising material on Trump or his family a fair follow-up question. #TreasonSummit
Trump asked if he believes US intelligence or Putin. "I have president Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this I don't see any reason why it would be." Asks where Hillary Clinton's missing emails are.		Where are our @GOP members with courage?? #TreasonSummit

@nat20148 @GenschClara @abramkj @RepGoodlatte @ATFHQ @nvdaily No, it's not. A simple google will tell you that 25 Russians &amp; 3 Russian companies have been indicted on conspiracy &amp; hacking charges designed to help Trump's 2016 campaign. And Trump's election fraud commission was disbanded due to lack of evidence.
@GenschClara @abramkj @nat20148 @RepGoodlatte @ATFHQ @nvdaily We have evidence of large scale Russian interference in our elections. We have no evidence of large scale illegal voting. Next.
@armandlaurin48 @TrumpStudents @USArealnews Well this isn't news because it's not true, so...
@RepGoodlatte @ATFHQ @nvdaily No comment on the president saying it’s our fault that US-Russian relations are bad? Even after 12 Russians were indicted on Friday for ATTACKING us? You, sir, are no patriot.
@washingtonpost What effort?
If this #TreasonSummit was a scene in a movie about  a US President who was in the pocket of a Russian dictator it would be too obvious.
@TrumpStudents Is that the number you pulled out of your made up numbers maga hat today? Got any sources to back that up?
@TrumpStudents 1) This is not a liberal opinion, this is the opinion of one wacko on Twitter.	2) Roy Moore

@IRSkilledme @WMALDC @replouiegohmert @TheDCVince @MaryWalterRadio I don’t disagree &amp; there’s plenty of blame on both sides when it comes to marital infidelity. My point is that Gohmert is throwing the same stones at Strzok that he could be throwing at his porn-star-paying-off president, but he isn’t.
@WMALDC @replouiegohmert @TheDCVince @MaryWalterRadio And suddenly a republican cares about marital infidelity🙄🙄🙄

@replouiegohmert @kilmeade @FoxNews Irony died when you, an avid Roy Moore &amp; Trump supporter, lectured someone else on their relationships with women. Your comments today proved what an absolute disgrace to your office you are.

@JasonMillerinDC Also not seeing what's "brutal" about this poll... two Democrats are leading by double digits in the heart of Trump Country. The seats they call for Dems losing are led by 5 points or fewer. That should be concerning.
@JasonMillerinDC Remember when Democrats got cocky about the polls in 2016? Keep going.
@RickSaccone4PA Compare how many democratic candidates are refusing to take PAC money to the number of republican candidates doing the same. Therein lies your answer.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Are you actually pretending Mitch waited to hear who Obama’s nominee was before deciding to block him? Such hypocrites.
@Csic1976 @benshapiro Major difference being Muslim women wear burkas because they choose to wear burkas, not because a theocratic government forces them to. Your implication that you're against women wearing burkas proves the point exactly that you'd prefer to control what women wear.
@olbigwhiskey @COACHJMAC @RVAStreetMedia In a word yes, though Congress has been split or fully Republican-controlled since this began, and Michigan's Republican governor has been in place for 8 years. At no time have Democrats had as much control over this issue as Republicans do now.
@olbigwhiskey @COACHJMAC @RVAStreetMedia People are actually capable of doing both.
@Alicia701 @AG_Conservative Correct, but you might want to educate yourself on the historical separation of Democrats from liberalism. Democrats were historically conservative until roughly the JFK era. So, the cause of a lot of horrible things were the result of conservatives is a more precise statement.
@COACHJMAC @RVAStreetMedia Um, the left isn’t in charge. The right, which controls all 3 branches of government, has made it clear for the last year and a half that they give zero fucks about Flint.

@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents Didn’t have to look anything up. It’s called being educated.
@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents Business owners aren’t being arrested because this administration focuses on arresting the immigrants and not those who hire them. Plus you just defended those hiring them saying jobs are good. 		Also that’s not what reverse psychology means.
@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents You cried socialist at me when I asked you why you support businesses who hire illegal immigrants. Don’t see how that is being owned. Prove you’re not a bot by explaining why not prosecuting businesses who hire illegal immigrants helps the illegal immigration problem.
@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents Nope. Paid a reasonable amount in in-state tuition for my college education.
@Lukeparaa @Moms4TrumpMaga @TrumpStudents This has got to be a joke or bot account but the more I keep her going the more embarrassing it is for @TrumpStudents so I’m cool with it
@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents So you’re pro-hiring illegal immigrants because jobs are good? You realize hiring illegal immigrants encourages more illegal immigration right? So you’re pro-illegal immigration?
@Moms4TrumpMaga Demonstrably false. https://t.co/0LLkOseMM7
@Moms4TrumpMaga @Lukeparaa @TrumpStudents I’m not, and you didn’t answer my question. Why don’t you have a problem with the people who hire undocumented immigrants?

@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash I've gotten it since middle school history class, it's not hard to understand. What I'm saying is the compromise was made *with the understanding and condoning* that black people were owned and did not get to vote. Otherwise a compromise would not have been needed.
@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash I think the Constitution shouldn't have sanctioned people owning other people for starters.
@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash I understand, and that's exactly what I said: they count as 3/5ths of a person, which both sanctioned their enslavement and their inability to vote for representation. Forgive me if I don't see that as being a positive part of our history. Quite disconcerting that you do.
@RepMarkWalker You don't have faith in the DOJ because Trump, who you refuse to criticize, frequently makes wild &amp; untrue claims about them in order to discredit any wrongdoing they may find him responsible for. Wish Republicans would protect the rule of law as devotedly as they do the POTUS.
@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash I see you both have nothing to say after condescending to me then realizing I do actually know what tf I'm talking about. Be blessed✌️

@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash Not sure why I'm responsible for Googling that for you but okay. Article I, Section 2, Clause 3.

@NotPCAmerican @AnnaBeaming @AlexMorash When the Constitution has a history of saying things like black people count as 3/5ths of a person I could really give a fuck if judges stay true to it down to the letter or not. I'd rather they do the right thing.

@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin If your intent is to reduce the rate of abortion, outlawing them will simply make them less safe, not more infrequent. Your precious unborn babies will still die, along with the women carrying them.
@danbull1 @cher Didn't see a threat there but I imagine you were totally cool with Trump telling his rally-goers to knock out protesters, and he would pay the legal fees? Those threats are cool right? That's just not being politically correct right?
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin You should also accept the consequence that your unwillingness to support accessible birth control will result in more abortions. That is just a fact.
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin Did I say there was? There is absolutely something wrong with abstinence-only education because it results in sexual ignorance which results in unintended pregnancies which results in abortions. Yet it's ironically a form of education supported by the pro-life crowd.
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin If you were actually anti-abortion you'd support organizations that make birth control more accessible and abortion thereby more infrequent. But of course you don't.
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin Ohhhhh of course! I'm sure that will work, just as abstinence only education does.
@danbull1 @cher I see why you want us to be civil, because look where that got you. Buckle up, those days are over.
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin But pregnant women don't. Cool. You realize if a pregnant woman dies getting a back alley abortion, the fetus dies too right?
@ChellieCook1 @ianinamerica @oliverdarcy @jaketapper @JeffreyToobin Pro-life except when it comes to adult women? Seriously, listen to yourself.
@tparti Of course it is.

@AaronVulrik @WiredSources @BasedInformant @RepMaxineWaters You literally just said she should be arrested and sentenced accordingly IF the left commits ANY violence. The radical right killed someone last year in case you forgot, and Trump has called for violence much more explicitly than she ever did.
@AaronVulrik @WiredSources @BasedInformant @RepMaxineWaters Daddy?		If Trump isn't responsible for violence committed by the right after explicitly inciting it, then why are you holding Maxine Waters responsible for (potential) violence committed by the left? I'm not making any argument, simply applying yours to both sides.
@WiredSources Still looking for the violence you speak of...
@AaronVulrik @WiredSources @BasedInformant @RepMaxineWaters One could argue that by inciting violence at his rallies and promising to pay the legal fees of his supporters who "knock out" protesters, Heather Heyer's blood is already on the hands of Donald Trump.
@TeamAmericaMOFO @jackhutton @jesusrodriguezb @ProPublica @Georgetown @SecElaineChao Given that @TeamAmericaMOFO asked me how I'd like being harassed then immediately blocked me, it looks like I'm not the one who can't handle reaction from the other side. So maybe he answered his own question🤷‍♀️
@TeamAmericaMOFO @jackhutton @jesusrodriguezb @ProPublica @Georgetown @SecElaineChao Feminism is about equal treatment. Elaine, Sarah, Kellyanne, Kierstjen, etc are all being treated exactly the same as they would be if they were horrible men. People reacting to their actions regardless of their gender is the height of feminism.
@Shayes1961 @Dean_Moriarty36 @parscale @realDonaldTrump Care to comment, or is inciting violence only ok when he does it?
@Shayes1961 @Dean_Moriarty36 @parscale @realDonaldTrump "Knock the crap out of 'em would you? Seriously. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees." 0:13-0:23.	https://t.co/L7ZrfEKpwv
@AnnCoulter Well they're not dreamers, so maybe that's why media isn't reporting it as such. I see you have no problem disseminating lies to your frothing base though.
@JimInhofe @POTUS Tell us how many Muslim extremists have harmed American citizens vs. white male mass shooters over the last two years. This isn't about security.
@AidayCalluna @SykesforSenate @ShaunKing It makes no sense that Congress would have to front billions in taxpayer money for a wall that we were promised Mexico would pay for, yet here we are.
@Dean_Moriarty36 @parscale @realDonaldTrump Trump said he'd pay the legal fees of his supporters who assaulted peaceful protesters at his rallies. Spare me the outrage at SHS being separated from her food for an evening.
@dcexaminer Mitch McConnell takes victory lap after spitting on democracy and stealing a SCOTUS seat from a sitting president. Can't wait for the same thing to happen to them.
@RepDeSantis McConnell spat on democracy and the constitution when he stole that Supreme Court seat from Obama, and you support it.		Respectfully and civilly, fuck you.
@SykesforSenate @ShaunKing Why don't you just build your border wall with Obama &amp; Hillary since you can't get over them? Would save billions.

@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Some of the richest people in the world are not household names. He chose to go on tv, buy pageants, hang out with “elites”, marry models, create tv shows with him at the center, etc because he wanted to be a celebrity. This is such a stupid conversation to be having.

@GaretMufc @TrumpStudents @davidhogg111 The NRA opposes expanding background checks, which many shooters would not and should not have passed. 97% of gun owners support universal background checks. If you see background checks as an attack on law gun owners then I don't know what to tell you.
@pjh4liberty @TrumpStudents @davidhogg111 When have they ever advocated for the rest of America not getting to have guns?
@GaretMufc @TrumpStudents @davidhogg111 Common sense gun control, which does does not include taking firearms away from trained body guards, is what they’re advocating for. Make sense now?
@Rick_Ingersoll @TrumpStudents @davidhogg111 How does that make him a hypocrite? He’s never advocated for taking firearms away from trained professionals.

@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents He became famous for being on television. He was the host of Celebrity Apprentice. The only difference between him and "Hollywood elite" celebrities that Fox so despises is that they agree with him politically.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Sarah Sanders: "It is very biblical to enforce the law." 	Jeff Sessions: "I would cite you to the Apostle Paul ... to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them." 		Separating families or gang-rape by Coyotes is a false equivalence, and both are child abuse.
@MrBubbles2489 @ColumbiaBugle @benshapiro And look what it got conservatives: the House, Senate and presidency. Oh, and the SCOTUS seat that Mitch McConnell stole. We’re good turning up the outrage just as high as we’d like.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents They’re giving countless amounts of money to organizations that fight for civil rights and democracy (see: Chrissy Tiegan). Speaking out because they have a platform. Never said you watched the show but you support a profane Hollywood celebrity, yet all others should shut up?
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Oh, like the one Trump endorsed for Senate in Alabama? No one is ever given a pass to enter the country nor has anyone advocated that, but people should be housed together while they’re processed unless there is an obvious issue of parental unfitness.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents The only people advocating that we become a theocracy are the ones who work in the White House quoting the Bible to defend their abhorrent child abuse. Which demonstrates exactly what has driven me away from the church.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Don’t take my word for it, take the word of nearly every faith leader who has spoken on it including avid Trump supporter Franklin Graham. To answer your question yes I grew up in the church, baptized &amp; confirmed. But hate from the most “devout” of Christians has driven me away.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents People who commit first offense misdemeanors generally do not get separated from their kids, no. If they’re willing to journey across the border, I’m sure what’s waiting for them at home (death) is much more harmful to their kids than what’s here. I’d do the same for my family.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents 1) Who? They’re staying and fighting like I have been, another reason I plan on staying (though yesterday’s weed legalization makes Canada sound even more tempting). 2) “Hollywood” are no more my heroes than the host of Celebrity Apprentice is yours.
@veteranmountian @dcexaminer @mccraw_birkie5 You realize police were stopping him from breaking a gun control law, right? If there were no law that said felons can’t own guns there would be nothing for police to stop.
@veteranmountian @dcexaminer @mccraw_birkie5 If there were no gun control laws he would be allowed to have all those guns legally though.
@veteranmountian @dcexaminer @mccraw_birkie5 Isn’t that what just happened? A law was enforced?
@veteranmountian @dcexaminer @mccraw_birkie5 Yeah, we should just remove all laws since sometimes people break them. Great idea!

@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle Each person seeking asylum goes through an individual (legal) determination process, it's not a blanket "all brown people from south of the border do not qualify and their asylum request is therefore deemed illegal" but I'm sick of explaining this to ignorance so... https://t.co/OepBw8hgYD
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle Cool, then the government can determine that. Presenting oneself for asylum is not in itself illegal, which is the point at which families are being separated.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle Presenting yourself for asylum is legal, in case that needed additional clarification for you.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle The ones in the article. Try reading it.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle I actually know exactly what I'm talking about. Apparently you don't though. https://t.co/TI7EeyKUnL
@viaAlana It is. Get mad, stay mad, vote.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle And you said "I'm cool with families not coming to the U.S. illegally." They're not all coming here illegally.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle You do realize some of the families being separated are legally seeking asylum, right?
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle Fine we can turn them away and keep families together then. Have a problem with that?
@JoeyCortese45 It's actually scary to still be living on the same planet as you cult members, much less the same country.
@JohnQAnonTitor @DukeChronicle So you're cool with children being unnecessarily separated from their families for the sole purpose of being a political bargaining chip? Is it safe to assume you're also a member of the party of family values?

@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab Well, I encourage you to learn a little more about the trans experience and barriers that prevent them from being able to integrate fully into society. This article might be a good place to start. Have a good one. https://t.co/JIRwObEk3j
@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab Ok, I disagree that being gender fluid means you don't have a concrete idea of who you are and are incapable of thriving. Plenty of gender fluid and trans people know exactly who they are and thrive perfectly fine as long as politicians stay out of their personal lives.
@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab Ok, how do you think that idea breaks down society?
@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab In what ways do you think non-Cis people are breaking down society? Genuinely curious.
@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab It sounds like you're equating gender dysphoria to mental illness. Pretending trans people don't exist doesn't discourage gender dysphoria any more than keeping gay people from getting married discourages gayness. It only encourages closetedness.
@smitty12ab @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Weird, someone has to get convicted of a crime first to be pardoned. Shouldn't be too hard to do what with Republicans controlling the presidency, DOJ, Congress and all.
@snottydawg @smitty12ab Female is cis gender.
@FixAmericaNow_ @smitty12ab Newsflash: what encourages mental illness is forcing trans people to conform to a gender they don't identify with, otherwise face discrimination and otherness. Society's uncomfortableness with them is why they're disproportionately suicidal. Correlation does not equal causation.
@GOP Too bad small business owners like myself can't afford #Trumpcare.
@DirtwolfDirt @SpeakerRyan He will never do anything about human rights as long as he got his beloved tax cut for the rich. His soul left his body on election day 2016 and apparently has decided not to come back. I don't blame it.

@SpeakerRyan Except those fleeing violence in search of a better life, they can get fucked.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Am I upset for his middle aged children that their wealthy father had his bail revoked because he was witness tampering in an effort to obstruct a federal investigation? Nah. His life wasn't in danger until he decided to commit crimes. Not the case for those crossing the border.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Too cold and no friends or family there. Otherwise my values align much more strongly with Canadian leadership than American.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Never said they should be handing out asylum willie nillie. But they shouldn't be separating parents from their children for legally seeking it. Matter of fact they shouldn't be separating families period. It's cruel, inhumane, and deeply un-Jesuslike.
@TrumpStudents How ever will people defend themselves without an AR-15?!?
@stage2thinking @EmmasGem @thehill Bin Laden https://t.co/p9jfG3BgG8
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Point being, it’s not for you to determine if they’re granted asylum, it’s for the government. Requesting asylum is legal, and they’re having their babies stripped away anyway. The party of pro-life family values sure seems to only care about one type of family.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents I’m tempted to every day.
@nova_hillbilly @badnewssss @TrumpStudents Because it’s well known that these problems are occurring in corruptly-governed Central American countries. Remember “they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists and some I assume are good people”?These are the good people. Escaping the criminals and rapists.
@WeismongerJudy @badnewssss @TrumpStudents “Hurt no one” is not the standard by which law breaking is determined.
@TrumpStudents Some of those being separated are LEGALLY seeking asylum. Please do some reading every now and then.
@WeismongerJudy @badnewssss @TrumpStudents We know he was witness tampering because he’s in jail for witness tampering.
@WeismongerJudy @TrumpStudents Ok one more because I’m feeling generous. Hiring a campaign manager who LITERALLY WENT TO FUCKING JAIL TODAY. I thought he only hires the best people?

@RepRWilliams @joolytron @JulieForTX25 @HHSGov @HouseDemocrats Um, no. Families arriving at the border (some LEGALLY seeking asylum) are having children ripped away as a deterrent to others. GOP leaders have said as much. This is Trump &amp; only Trump's policy that he could change with a call. But he won't because he's a narcisictic sociopath.

@hollywoodweird2 @JoanMClements @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump Asking someone a question doesn’t take away any constitutional right. Doctors’ jobs are to keep their patient healthy and they should be able speak candidly to their patients without the gun lobby’s interference.
@hollywoodweird2 @JoanMClements @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump The NRA has actually lobbied to keep doctors from being allowed to ask suicidal and mentally unstable patients if they own a gun.
@hollywoodweird2 @JoanMClements @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump Because mentally ill people can buy guns in Florida.
@hollywoodweird2 @JoanMClements @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump You're talking about law enforcement professionals in which there was a clear breakdown re: Parkland. I'm talking about health professionals who I trust to determine if someone is too mentally unstable to own a firearm. Trump's order reversal made it easier for them to carry.
@hollywoodweird2 @JoanMClements @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump I'll leave that up to health professionals, but in the meantime let's not allow them to own firearms and make sure if parents are negligent enough to not lock their weapons up that they face criminal prosecution.
@hollywoodweird2 @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX According to the GOP, mental health. Not only did Trump make it easier for the mentally ill to acquire weapons as one of his first acts in office but he plans to cut funding for mental healthcare. You should be asking them why they're doing that if mental health is the problem.
@JoanMClements @hollywoodweird2 @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX @realDonaldTrump ^also this. Literally the first Obama-era executive order that he reversed.
@hollywoodweird2 @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX Figuring out how to reduce future shootings *is* part of today's conversation. The GOP has made clear their disinterest in a solution given their plan to reduce funding for what they say is part of the problem (mental illness).
@hollywoodweird2 @williamlegate @lgsawyer @FoxNews @KenPaxtonTX But can you explain why the GOP blames mass shootings on mental illness but wants to cut funding for mental healthcare? How does that make any sense?
@benshapiro Just because you don’t like the way they define a school shooting doesn’t make it untrue, Ben. Facts don’t care about your feelings.

@DrKavarga @davidhogg111 @JakeRage5 @mollylanza Yes. Taking better care of our mentally ill and keeping guns out of their hands is part of the equation, especially in preventing *some* mass shootings, but certainly not the entire solution to solving the gun violence epidemic.
@DrKavarga @davidhogg111 @JakeRage5 @mollylanza The United States doesn't have a monopoly on mentally ill people yet we do have a monopoly on developed countries with gun violence problems. What about everyday gun violence on urban streets? Most of those perps are not mentally ill.
@IngrahamAngle Since when did you Trump-worshipers start valuing those qualities?
@LaurieCAguilera @RobiCalifornia @TimRunsHisMouth Perhaps it's worth considering that your idea of winning is different than the other 60% of the country.
@cometastral @latinarants @EmmanuelMacron If you’re talking about the disparity between Clinton and Trump votes, it was more than 2.8 million. Not barely 1 million.
@cometastral @latinarants @EmmanuelMacron Making up your own facts is not how facts work.

@SoteroBarboza @latinarants @EmmanuelMacron @POTUS No they didn't.
@cometastral @latinarants @EmmanuelMacron The election does not beg to differ. "Most Americans" means the highest number of votes. Trump got the lower number of votes. Because we are a republic and not a democracy, he won anyway. That's how our country's voting system works.
@yrnf Huge mistake. He has once again undermined our credibility with global allies with this decision. These decisions are making America alone, not America first. God forbid we need our allies before this presidency is over.
@benshapiro This is such an absurdly twisted view of pro-choice advocates' beliefs that you used to gin up hostility towards them. How about using actual statistics to back up your assertion that pro-choicers support abortion two days before birth (hint: it's a very, very small fraction).
@IAmRainbowTrash @RealDaveBrooks @benshapiro Yes. From a pro-choicer's comment above: "only a few lunatics believe that abortion 2 days before birth is acceptable." Ben's post is not at all an accurate depiction of what pro-choice advocates believe, and shame on him for misrepresenting it as such.

@ld_carden @BillBraxley @deebeeeff @DLoesch No one in this conversation did, nor are 99% of lawmakers asking for common sense gun legislation.

@ld_carden @BoomStryker @deebeeeff @DLoesch Saying something you disagree with is not a scandal, by the way. Lying about paying hush money to a porn star and getting caught on tape bragging about grabbing women’s pussies, however, is.

@CyndiGurley @raygray1984 @FindTruthUSA @DonTheJoke @Dr_Covfefe_PhD @DLoesch @shannonrwatts When you say “shocker!” sarcastically, the implication is that this is a typical thing that liberals do. There’s no other way to read that.
@CyndiGurley @FindTruthUSA @DonTheJoke @Dr_Covfefe_PhD @DLoesch @shannonrwatts No, they don't. It's never ok to make fun of a woman solely for her appearance. But to act like that's a liberal thing to do when the Republican president has a long history of shaming women's looks is pretty ridiculous and hypocritical would you not agree?
@FindTruthUSA @DonTheJoke @CyndiGurley @Dr_Covfefe_PhD @DLoesch @shannonrwatts Isn't that exactly what @CyndiGurley did? Cry about liberals shaming women's looks when Trump has a long history of doing exactly that?

@spayce_dog @Zinnia1111 @MilesDeep16 @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA It’s not that I’m proud that he owns a gun, I could really care less if he does or not, it’s more that he’s a man of few hobbies and if he’s enjoys and is good at this I’m happy for him🤷‍♀️
@spayce_dog @MilesDeep16 @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA Yes, he owns quite a few guns actually. Range shooting is something he’s gotten good at and enjoys and I’m happy for him for that. He’s also former law enforcement &amp; feels safer carrying. I have no desire to keep handguns away from him but am anti-AR and for stricter checks, etc.
@MilesDeep16 @spayce_dog @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA When did I say I hate guns? My dad placed second in a shooting competition last weekend actually and I’m very proud of him. You know nothing about me.
@MilesDeep16 @spayce_dog @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA No, Orlando and Vegas were both more deadly than Virginia tech and both used AR-15s. Your premise that because we can’t stop all deaths we shouldn’t try to stop any isn’t sensical. In that case should make seatbelt wearing optional again because seatbelts won’t save everyone.
@MilesDeep16 @spayce_dog @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA We have no way of knowing that, but I'm willing to bet it will be exceedingly higher than in the past given our current climate. Exhibit A: https://t.co/evUreF5zBC
@MilesDeep16 @spayce_dog @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA There is a clear definition. See the federal assault weapons ban of 1994. It's pretty in-depth.
@MilesDeep16 @spayce_dog @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA Again, 2A doesn't inherently exclude any specific gun nor has anyone said it does. But a conservative majority Supreme Court ruled it has the right to limitation. The degree of that limitation is what is up for debate.
@spayce_dog @MilesDeep16 @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA I think they're afraid of us... https://t.co/69nFTo6BUc

@MilesDeep16 @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA @NOLATAC said "shall not be infringed specifically means unlimited." @KingRiptor rightly corrected him by saying not according to the Supreme Court. It's not up to the SCOTUS to determine which specific weapons to outlaw, nor did anyone say it was. That's up to states or fed govt
@MilesDeep16 @KingRiptor @NOLATAC @Zinnia1111 @BusbeyAlysia @davidhogg111 @NRA “Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited…”. It is “…not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” -Antonin Scalia in majority opinion, DC vs. Heller, 2008

@purplesealion @jeremynewberger @gtconway3d @KellyannePolls Not at all. Kellyanne’s job is to tout a political position which her husband clearly and publicly disagrees with. Journalists’ job is to ask questions of politicians, not to tout a position. Wouldn’t really matter if their spouse was in politics.
@purplesealion @jeremynewberger @gtconway3d @KellyannePolls Her implication though was that they’re going to go after much more than political leanings, and that was low.
@purplesealion @jeremynewberger @gtconway3d @KellyannePolls And that’s all Kellyanne or anyone else has to say in response to that question, but she instead decided to go low. Journalists also don’t represent a political position like Kellyanne does so Idk why CNN would care about being asked about their spouse’s political leanings.
@purplesealion @jeremynewberger @gtconway3d @KellyannePolls Kellyanne’s literal job is to praise the president on TV, and her husband chooses to publicly criticize him on twitter. It’s a fair question to ask. Kellyanne’s implication was that they’re now going to go after CNN spouses for asking that question. Typical low Trumpian move.
@RepStevenSmith @RealCandaceO The outrage is in large part because this is coming from the same man who said “George Bush hates black people.” It’s weird.

@pooler_dave What I said was they were effectively banned in the 30's. There were a few exceptions which were eliminated in 1986. I would LOVE for the CDC to research what's changed and how we can combat the gun violence epidemic but unfortunately the NRA doesn't. https://t.co/RU8jJl1VVm
@pooler_dave Societal factors have changed significantly since the 30's when fully autos were effectively banned. Societal factors were much more comparable when semi-autos were banned during the 90's-00's. While 10 years isn't enough to fully study the effects, mass shootings did decrease.
@pooler_dave There are more specifics that I've attached for you which would exclude many types of handguns. They get off the streets by being destroyed when used in a crime, not sold back to the public as many are now. In 100 years far fewer would remain in circulation except to law abiders. https://t.co/HgbZcptFlx
@pooler_dave I'd define it the same way the DOJ did in 1994. "Semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use"
@pooler_dave So to use a different analogy, "is banning murder going to stop all murders?" Yet murder is still illegal. Why make any laws if people will always find a way break them? That's how that argument sounds.
@pooler_dave I'm not sure where I said to take guns away from law abiding citizens yet you keep saying that. There's no reason banning AR sales would prevent any law abiding citizen from protecting themselves with a firearm. AR-style weapons aren't intended for self protection anyway.
@pooler_dave Military-style weapons I'd advocate for the discontinued sale of, not removal from those who already have them, as was done from '94-'04 (and mass shootings decreased). Your argument asserts if we can't stop all gun violence we shouldn't stop any. Same drug analogy applies here.
@pooler_dave Obviously not. It will likely reduce the number of those weapons that get into criminals' hands though. That's like saying "is banning heroin going to stop all the drug abuse?" Yet heroin is still illegal.
@Glitterpnk Clearly we have different definitions of winning then.
@pooler_dave No matter how many times you say it, no one wants to take guns out of law abiding citizens' hands (unless they're under 21 and want to buy an AR-15 in Florida). In no way would any laws people advocate for have prevented this resource officer from gunning down this shooter.
@pooler_dave Armed SROs, yes. Armed teachers, no. Where will we get the resources to pay for the *extensive* training these teachers will need when we can't even pay them a living wage? How much more probable will accidents be when there's a gun in every classroom? Horrible idea.
@pooler_dave No one is also saying we'll be able to prevent all gun violence with stricter laws, but we may be able to prevent one. It will be a years-long process to reduce the number of guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them. But if we can prevent one death it will be worth it.
@Glitterpnk A 16-year-old girl was shot at her high school today and is in critical condition. A 14-year-old was injured. Forgive me if I don't consider teenagers being gunned down in their schools "winning."
@pooler_dave In what way were you proven right? Gun control advocates aren't against armed SRO's. They're against things like this happening in the first place due to rampant firearm availability. And who knows what would have happened if this boy had an AR-15.
Conservatives now saying the Great Mills High School shooting was a "win" because the shooter was killed by an armed security officer. Is this the "winning" Trump kept telling us about? Because we're definitely tired of it. https://t.co/Ll64gMNbd0
@GodsNWO @Commandr_nchief @CNN Data simply doesn’t show that more guns=fewer people shot. Just look at any study or any other country.

@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed Again, you should in all seriousness educate yourself on what sexual assault is and quickly because that could become a problem. For instance, if you grab a woman's vagina and she doesn't say anything to you, THAT👏 IS👏 STILL👏 ASSAULT👏.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed Men thinking the women they harass "let" them do it because they're silent about it is EXACTLY why #MeToo exists. It's about powerful men taking advantage women's bodies because they can get away with it. That's exactly what he described, and we're not letting it slide anymore.
@RosLehtinen @nikkihaley Unfortunately she will probably be gone tomorrow.
@cameron_kasky CC: @CCHSCougarNews - Thanks for confirming my decision not to send my kids to parochial schools.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed I don't think we're talking about the same tape. I'm talking about this one. Point me to the part where he brags about having sex with lots of women.	https://t.co/cHOTLuTR4H
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed Actually I think the better question is what do you think consent means?
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed What do you think he means by that then?
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed How do you suggest they prove it? A tape of him bragging about doing what they say he did to them is pretty damning. To be clear I'm against all sexual assaulters and harassers not just the ones whose politics I disagree with.
@RepMarkWalker So are you going to do anything about all the mass shootings outside of schools or are you too afraid of the NRA to touch gun control?
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed "Just kiss. I don’t even wait." Does that sound like consent? Forcibly kissing/grabbing women's vaginas is called sexual assault, and you should probably educate yourself on the subject if you think it's not. Just because they let him get away with it doesn't mean they consented.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed So he talked about sexually assaulting women, does that make it better? There are also something like 16 women on record saying he sexually assaulted them. But of course he calls them all liars, despite him being on tape bragging about doing exactly what they allege.
@SpeakerRyan So how will this prevent mass shootings outside of schools? It won't, because your NRA-owned party is too afraid of losing their blood money to touch widely popular gun control legislation.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed And men wonder why #MeToo is happening🙄
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed I don't have to paint him as anything, he does that all himself.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed "Just kiss. I don’t even wait."	"Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything."	That's called sexual assault. Most women are sadly used to that sick behavior enough not to make a scene every time it happens. I'd advise you to listen to women's experiences if you think that's okay.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed It's amazing to me that we live in a country where people think a hijab is sexist but a man who brags about sexually assaulting women is not.
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed How exactly then would you describe the pussy tape and its subsequent dismissal as locker room talk? Very respectful of women and their bodies?
@maxjudge59 @BuzzFeed Why did people elect an oppressive and sexist president in a free country like the US yet here we are.

@IamRemoWilliams @SykesforSenate "scream her snake headed drivel at people she doesn’t even know" ...the irony is just hilarious. Tell me again how much you know about me.
@CCLibrarianLV @gbollmann01 @WalshFreedom You're ignoring the fact that $10mil is way higher than typical spend on a race like this, and that it's gained national attention for the sole fact that it's a referendum on this type of district. Not sure what working in DC after the election has to do with any of that.
@CCLibrarianLV @gbollmann01 @WalshFreedom How much they spent on it actually has a lot to do with it. It means they saw it as an important bellwether for November regardless of how long this rep serves. This is a district that Trump won by 20 points and that it's even close is not good for them.
@CCLibrarianLV @gbollmann01 @WalshFreedom Weird that the GOP spent more than $10 million on it then.

@Frontbumpercrew @quigley_suzie @WanderBrn2 @POlubunmi @CPotterPgh The redistricting doesn't favor blue urban areas, it gives them fair representation.

@usa_free_bob @piscata_antonio This might surprise you but my dad competes in shooting matches often &amp; has a gun in almost every room of the house. We support 2A. Only 71% of Dems in a poll supported banning assault weapons, so while there's no data on banning all guns I can't imagine there'd be much support.
@usa_free_bob @piscata_antonio As a member of what I'd consider the "left," I can tell you 99% of us do not want to remove all guns from society. That's a myth that has been perpetuated by the other side. If we could come together and agree on protections that BOTH sides are ok with, maybe we'd make progress.

@ktolly27 @blakerosser1 @SenThomTillis Think about this rationally. America happens to be the only industrialized country with a lack of a "moral compass" and that's why we're the only ones affected by this? Europe is much more liberal if that's what you consider immoral, and they don't have this problem.
@TexasArmyChris @Exxcast @jaketapper It's not about being a member of the NRA. It's about the NRA using their money to buy politicians out of even *researching* the reasons gun violence is so much more rampant in America than in any other industrialized nation.

@MamaReg2 @davidmweissman @JackPosobiec Are we going to embrace pro-lifers as fellow feminists? No. But are we trying to take any rights away from them? Also no. Pro-life women can't say the same, which is why they aren't embraced by feminism.	The law (and I) don't consider fetuses women, so that argument is moot.
@davidmweissman @JackPosobiec @MamaReg2 Correction: the left couldn't care less if a woman is pro-life or not. Unfortunately the stance of most pro-lifers is that other women shouldn't be allowed to be pro-choice. So which women are taking rights from other women in that scenario?
@JackPosobiec The “left” aren’t the ones who allowed Hope Hicks to be in a relationship with a man they knew beat his ex-wives. That would be John Kelly.

@doublel627 @POTUS The FBI doesn’t “let” anyone work for the Trump administration or not, the White House decides that after the FBI briefs them. And clearly they decided wife beating isn’t a deal breaker as long as the media doesn’t find out about it.

@daverburgess @doublel627 @jaketapper Watch the press conference from yesterday with Raj Shah. He was asked if Kelly knew about the allegations before the photos came out repeatedly, and each time the response was “I’m not going to get into specifics.” That’s as good as a yes. If it was no, why wouldn’t he say no?
@doublel627 @jaketapper Gwen is right. FBI would have told Gen Kelly. It's up to the White House whether he stays or not. And obviously they decided wife beating wasn't a deal breaking offense to work for this administration.

@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul Am I supposed to be surprised that the largest swath of women getting abortions are those at maximum fertility? Since you're much older than me maybe you can educate me on how much better it was when women had to get abortions in back alleys rather than hospitals.
@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul I wouldn't consider any woman who choses to pursue her education rather than drop out of school to raise a baby unintelligent; again a very judgmental comment. Just because you'd make a different decision doesn't mean you should get to make that choice for others.
@SallyAmerica100 @ClearThinkerChk @bjacobswein @RandPaul The commenter above called them disgusting so there's one. Pretty sure they don't think of themselves as victims, and where do you get your figure that most have deep regrets? Everyone I know who has had an abortion is very happy with their decision and living their best life.
@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul What you might call disgusting others might call "selfless" and "doing what's best for their child."
@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul Before you judge these women as "disgusting" I'd urge you to open your mind and read their stories. In one case the baby wouldn't be able to walk, talk, swallow, or sleep. These women had to make the heart wrenching decision to end their child's suffering. https://t.co/0uAgk5Avjf
@msirignano2 @ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul Not a valid comparison since I'm a fully formed &amp; healthy human that's been living independently from another body for years, but if I had to live the rest of my life with severe brain damage then yes I would say kill me now please.
@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul The other difference being no one is telling your friend she can't choose to carry to term if she wants to. That's between her and her doctor. All we ask is that politicians not make that decision for us in return.
@ClearThinkerChk @SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul If I was told at 20 weeks that there was no way my fetus would survive outside the womb and if by some miracle it did it would have severe physical and mental disabilities its entire life, I would 100% abort. So that's not no one.🤷‍♀️
@SallyAmerica100 @bjacobswein @RandPaul Please read this thread and educate yourself on why most physicians are pro-choice. Late term abortion in many many cases occurs because the fetus will die before or shortly after birth. Carrying these to term is extremely painful emotionally &amp; physically. https://t.co/RpkbS4B4Eu

@bareknucklelove @thehill The polling breakdown on election day was actually quite accurate. They were polling at 48% Clinton/44% Trump and results were 48% Clinton/46% Trump. Those couple of points in key states gave him the EC.
@bareknucklelove @thehill Because with how many states were polling within the margin of error but leaning Clinton, it was very unlikely that ALL of those states would fall to Trump which is what he needed to win. That happened. And day of the election it was only ~65-70% likely not in the 90s.
@dcexaminer @PhilipWegmann And yet his approval rating is 10 points lower. It's almost as if nothing he could do would redeem his horribly racist, misogynistic and xenophobic persona.
@thehill To people saying "just like they said Hillary would win in 2016":	1) She did if we're going off number of voters not EC like this poll does	2) % chance of winning is a different number than % who voted for each candidate	3) Results were within margin of error in most states

@Wildling0022 @LaraLeaTrump -Pardoned a sheriff who racially profiles Latinos	-Called Miss Universe "Miss Housekeeping"	-Retweeted fake videos showing Muslim violence	-Called for Muslim ban	-Endorsed a candidate who thought Muslims shouldn't serve in Congress	-Pretended he didn't know who David Duke was
@Wildling0022 @LaraLeaTrump A synopsis:	-Avoided renting to African-Americans in the 70's	-Called for death of falsely-accused Central Park 5	-Birtherism	-Kicked off campaign by calling Mexicans "rapists &amp; criminals"	-Said a judge couldn't do his job because "he's a Mexican"	-Called Nazis "very fine people"
@Wildling0022 @LaraLeaTrump Oh yeah, he just said he wanted Norwegians who *happen* to be white but not Haitians or Africans who *happen* to be black. Race has nothing to do with it I'm sure. You don't have to go back far to see a consistent pattern of racism with this one.

@Papafife @thehill @realDonaldTrump Polling had her winning by 4% and she won by 2%, which happens to be within the margin of error. Despite popular opinion, 2016 polling was not far off.
@Papafife @thehill @realDonaldTrump Not true.

@RepJimBanks Do you know anything about the reason most women abort after 20 weeks? In most cases it's because the child has a severe defect that would either cause it long term pain or death shortly after birth. Real humane to force those women and children carry to term.

@192skeeter @SouthernJewel @SiriusXMPatriot @WilkowMajority @RepMattGaetz @JudicialWatch @HillaryClinton Curious what you think Comey’s motivation for announcing he was re-opening her investigation 11 days before the election was if the whole thing was a sham and they never investigated anything?
@192skeeter @SouthernJewel @SiriusXMPatriot @WilkowMajority @RepMattGaetz @JudicialWatch We're still not getting to the bottom of why you care... to use your own logic, why are you not calling to lock up Trump associates when some have actually pled guilty to crimes? Are you giving them a pass because they're republicans?
@192skeeter @SouthernJewel @SiriusXMPatriot @WilkowMajority @RepMattGaetz So that is not a fact that is your feeling, and there have also been extremely extensive and costly investigations by Republicans (Benghazi) with no wrongdoing found.
@192skeeter @SouthernJewel @SiriusXMPatriot @WilkowMajority @RepMattGaetz If it were a republican who:	1) no longer holds an elected position, and	2) had been investigated extensively by democrats while in office with no law breaking found	...I honestly would not care. My curiosity is why do you?

@Carpophores @unscriptedmike Assuming things about people who disagree with you on the internet are why we’re here in the first place. Try to listen and look at people as humans capable of multiple complex thoughts.
@Carpophores @unscriptedmike 1) It’s not up to non-native Americans to determine if it’s a slur, it’s up to them. And they disagree. It would be the same as if Trump started using the N word then announced it wasn’t a slur so it’s all good. 2) I never gave Warren a pass.
@Carpophores @unscriptedmike It’s not petty to expect the president to exhibit some understanding of what these men did in his speech. You’re also leaving out the part where he called a Senator a racial slur in front of them for no apparent reason other than to be petty himself.

@AngeliaFlemin15 @dnvn88 @FoxNews Virginia voted for a Republican for president from 1968 to 2004.
@FoxNews @VP Let me guess. He sends his thoughts and prayers. Next.
@Georgin59405062 @FoxNews You've had a Democratic governor with Northam as lieutenant governor since 2014 and zero sanctuary cities...
@dnvn88 @FoxNews By always do you mean since 2008?
@FoxNews Are approval ratings and election results low enough for the rest of the @GOP to jump the Trump ship yet?
@realDonaldTrump Then why did you support and make robo calls for him? Lolol.	Looks like you went with the disown-and-abandon strategy this time.
Dems showed up in a big way for Northam to reject Trumpism in Virginia. Keep going @GOP, we’ll see what your numbers look like this time next year.
@TrumpsTrucker @rbarthjr @FoxNews Not sure what about my factual statements came off as hateful but okay. I'm not the one telling a stranger on Twitter that they need help.
@TrumpsTrucker @rbarthjr @FoxNews Donald Trump wasn't the host of Celebrity Apprentice? And he wasn't talking to Billy Bush on the set of Access Hollywood? Lol wut. https://t.co/TjJIjMzxy3
@TrumpsTrucker @rbarthjr @FoxNews I agree, like that time the host of Celebrity Apprentice talked about grabbing women by their p*ssies on an Access Hollywood set.
@TrumpsTrucker @FoxNews Ratings would indicate most find it hilarious.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls Guess you're only allowed to politicize a tragedy when the perpetrator is brown🤷‍♀️
@FoxNews It's clear why you dropped the "fair &amp; balanced" slogan earlier this year @FoxNews. Plan on tweeting anything non-negative about Northam?
@ScottPresler Stop believing everything your supreme leader tells you. https://t.co/x134Gp0Sty
@ScottPresler @HillaryClinton And your information regarding him not being radicalized in the last 7 years as a Florida resident is where?
@FoxNews @Judgenap Congratulations on reporting the biggest story of the day, what a feat👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

@Jen10316891 @Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro I would think a pro-lifer of all people would understand that.
@Jen10316891 @Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro I'm just sorry there are people who don't want to do everything they can to discourage unwanted pregnancies. That's my only argument, Jen.
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro I guess I don’t see what’s wrong with that. The only thing wrong I see is limiting their contraceptive options. Agree to disagree.
@joltmanNH @FoxNews @POTUS So it was real when Obama buried it, but it’s a hoax now? #confused
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Limiting birth control access because some people have causal sex on it is literally the definition of basing decisions off one situation
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro But sex using birth control is reckless? Hardly.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Now here's something we can agree on :)
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro 😊👍
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Accessible &amp; affordable, yes all for that. Personally I think if BC was OTC we'd see teen pregnancies go way down. More than if covered by $
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Actually I've been on accutane, and most doctors require you to be on BC simultaneously because of the horrendous birth defects it can cause
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Have they tried an IUD? BC didn't help me but the IUD changed my life. I rarely get periods/pain anymore. Also love how this convo evolved😂
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Fair argument. I personally see no good coming from making BC difficult to access which is why I'm for everyone assisting in its coverage.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Birth control/IUD prevents the cramps from existing altogether rather than controlling pain. Speaking from experience.
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro So let's ask ourselves why the birth control method that men use to have "reckless sex with no consequences" isn't being attacked, but BC is
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro It's actually not.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Great, I hope you're willing to take Viagra off insurance coverage lists too just because some men have a problem getting it up.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Not to mention the myriad other reasons women go on birth control. Controlling cramp pain, acne, etc.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Pretty sure my husband is clean. Lots of married people are on birth control/have an IUD and have no need for STD protection.
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Ok forces wasnt the right word. Suppose we should just ask married people to keep their legs closed if they can't afford BC &amp; dont want kids
@FeigningSarcasm @benshapiro Never said it was. Judge away, just happy she was able to obtain her legal rights to make her own decision for her own body &amp; life.
@Liberal__Tears_ @WilliamHeathSk1 @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro That doesn't even make sense. Birth control *is* protection. It forces more people to have unprotected sex if employers won't cover it.
@FeigningSarcasm @benshapiro But why force her to take potentially months off of her studies and likely not graduate on time/face peer stigma when abortion is legal?
@WilliamHeathSk1 @Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro They also just made it legal for employers not to cover birth control in their health plans. If they want to make the pill OTC I'm all 4 it.
@Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Do you know how IUDs work? Literally impossible to "use" improperly. I have one &amp; it's fucking awesome. Glad I got it before GOP got elected
@FoxNews @POTUS He is aware that the Russia story started before the election right?
@Liberal__Tears_ @rkbatra67 @mitchandjen4440 @benshapiro Because condoms never fail... other forms like the pill &amp; IUD are way more effective yet one party wants to make those difficult to access.
@benshapiro And a 17-year-old who will be able to pursue the life of her dreams after obtaining her legal right to a safe abortion. Happy for her.
Because ~60%+ more Dreamers pursue higher education than the average American thanks to the #DreamAct. https://t.co/81b0Dr4Hr0
@USAsymbols @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake Maybe Flake's goal wasn't to be remembered but to do the best for his children and grandchildren. People remember who Charles Manson is too.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake Flake's approval ratings are better than Congress as a whole actually but I'm sure he didn't mention that.

@FoxNews @jessebwatters @JeffFlake Actually, you do. Without the votes of McCain, Corker, &amp; Flake nothing gets passed and the GOP can wave goodbye to 2018.
#ThingsITrustMorethanFOXNews a massage invitation from Harvey Weinstein
@ScottPresler No they didn’t.
@CommonSensRepub @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP @CNN I'll give you that CNN got something wrong in June. The story was retracted and people were fired. POTUS has yet to apologize for one lie.
@CommonSensRepub @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP @CNN I suppose Politifact doesn't have all the info either? I'll give you a good place to start for that side-by-side: https://t.co/apQAUsBSnE
@CommonSensRepub @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP @CNN Since I see you're unwilling to do this and instead decided to attack me personally without knowing anything about me, I rest my case.
@CommonSensRepub @SenThomTillis @SenateGOP @CNN Good one. Let's see a side-by-side of false statements made by CNN vs. Trump in the last 2 weeks, shall we?
@ScottPresler *Mueller gets appointed* "THIS IS FAKE NEWS NOTHING TO SEE HERE"	*Probe into Uranium deal* "OMIGOD EVERYONE'S GOING TO JAIL LOCK HER UP"
@SenThomTillis @SenateGOP I hope you're willing to speak truth to power, Senator. Unfortunately we have a president who has a very strained relationship with truth.
*Shocker alert* @POTUS lied. Again. @SenateGOP needs to start standing up for itself like Corker &amp; others who aren't afraid of re-election. https://t.co/Y57qoLMOzP
@MariLovesTrump @ABC @marykbruce @TheDemocrats So the man expressing real concerns w/o calling names is throwing a "temper tantrum" but the one calling him liddle &amp; lightweight isn't? Ok.
@MooreSenate You DO understand that neither Obama nor Clinton are in power now right? The only machine happening currently is the no-nothing GOP.
@WrenchSpinRac @CNN @mkraju Let's see a list of false statements made by CNN vs. Trump over the last 7 days. You can start with "other presidents didn’t make calls..."
@CNN @mkraju And he’s just figuring this out now?? How is this different from campaign Trump whom he fully endorsed?
@real_defender So everyone with the balls to criticize Trump is a RINO now? Suppose McCain, who was the GOP presidential nominee in 08, is a RINO too?
@ScottPresler Or maybe he feels free to say what everyone up for re-election is thinking...
Bob Corker has given the last of his remaining fucks and it’d be nice if other sane Republicans would take note. https://t.co/4UvSIdR6ka
@FoxNews @seanhannity @NFL Trump calls a Gold Star widow a liar today, and we're reviving this tired narrative that the NFL hates vets? Must be time for a distraction.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters Could it be that the president actually does lie more than any other president in memory?https://t.co/UN9raWWVIb
