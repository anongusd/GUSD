"Only statehood honors the principle that government is unjust without equal democratic consent of the governed. Only statehood will allow Puerto Rico to participate in the national and international economy competitively."
"Statehood is the proven means by which all 33 of the territories admitted between 1796 and 1959 resolved the social, economic and political development problems currently used as excuses for denying Puerto Rico statehood"

This is particularly egregious because voters in PuertoRico have rejected territory status and selected equality through statehood twice in the last 5 years (2012 &amp; 2017). Congress should must live up to founding principles etched into halls of #USCapitol. #GovernmentByConsent https://t.co/6YlyPYW2VM
After 101 years as #UScitizens &amp; 120 years under US flag unending territory status in PuertoRico results in unequal civil, political &amp; #VotingRights as well as unequal treatment under federal laws. Any American who truly believes in #CivilRights must find this unacceptable!
If #PlessyvFerguson created a legal framework of #SeparateButEqual then #InsularCases created one of #SeparateAndUnequal all based on the racist legal constructs of that time. But while #BrownvBoardofEducation ended Plessy, #InsularCases are still denying equal #CivilRights to PR
Legal roots of colonial unincorporated territory status in Puerto Rico date back to #InsularCases when a #SCOTUS with much of the same composition as one who decided #PlessyvFerguson decided that PR belonged to but was not a part of the US because people they were ‚Äúalien races‚Äù https://t.co/9ghmBxvwfy

Prompt and final resolution to unequal and undemocratic territory status is not only of fundamental importance to the People of Puerto Rico, but is also the unfinished business of American democracy.
So Puerto Rico‚Äôs territorial status is not only a detriment to the residents of PR that limits our potential, but also a blight on the very founding principles and values upon which America was built. #TheTruth
Being a country that had to fight a #WarofIndependence to end its colonial subordination America clearly enshrined principles of government by consent of the governed, equality under the law, &amp; representative democracy in its founding documents #AmericanValues #FoundingPrinciples

The unelected and unaccountable Oversight Board wants to impose draconian cuts in workers‚Äô pensions and erode Puerto Rico‚Äôs labor force. 		PROMESA is the most colonial act of Congress yet. #EndColonialism
Under the territorial status Puerto Rico is subject to federal laws, but Congress can and often does treat Puerto Rico differently in ways that are detrimental to the economic opportunity, health, security, and quality of life of 3.4 million U.S. citizens. #EndColonialism
Puerto Rico has held five political status referendums since 1967. In 2012 a majority of voters rejected the territorial status and chose Statehood. In 2017 an overwhelming majority voted for Statehood over the territory and independence. #EndColonialism https://t.co/RqHfqxvVrg
The 2016 PROMESA law is the most glaring example of colonialism, imposing a Board of unelected bureaucrats over Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico‚Äôs territorial status made that possible. #EndColonialism
