@realDonaldTrump Media, Dems or GOPs? Time to know who is who POTUS! With this Flynn thing, you better create new team, and include dems and women! You are getting links everywhere! The trust is gone from your inner team
GOP plan: get the tax bill passed! Then that all business they have with POTUS! He is next to impeach, per Flynn development story!
@realDonaldTrump It is too early to enjoy this tax bill POTUS; once GOP legislatures get this tax bill, you are next to be impeached! You better stay open and negotiate with Dems!  My 2 cents if you get what I am trying to warn you!
Tax bill? Let us get rich! Thanks GOP, and your supporters! Hope you all enjoy the law your are about to create!
Too late to pardon Flynn! Please inform POTUS not to use this card anymore! Investigation all the way my friend!
