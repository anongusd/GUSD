Anyone selling into a market needs to have a clear understanding of what solutions they provide. With a clear understanding you can develop relationships with your consumer. Relationships are the ROI. It's about providing consistent value. You don't get pregnant on the 1st date. https://t.co/3YGmOZyvQo
