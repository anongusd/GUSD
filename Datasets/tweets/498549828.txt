Swalwell, who was present at Cohen's first interview with the committee in 2017, said Cohen seemed more credible this time because of "the carefulness with answering the questions that he didnt show last time."

Jordan begins his opening statement by slamming Cohen, and Cummings for inviting him to the committee's first public hearing in this Congress.		"This is the Michael Cohen hearing presented by Lanny Davis," Jordan says.
I think I heard correctly... Cummings says they will NO LONGER restrict members from asking questions about Russia because Cohen talks about it in his prepared remarks.
Cummings says the days of this committee protecting Trump are over.
Cummings also notes that Cohen brought documents today, including copies of cheques.
Cummings says question of whether Cohen is telling the truth now is "a legitimate question." But says they are "in search of the truth."		Trump has made statements. "Now the American people have a right to hear the other side." They can "make their own judgement," Cummings says.
Motion tabled. Committee chairman Cummings says "the American people have a right" to hear Cohen. Rep. Jim Jordan, ranking member, interrupts saying they just want to follow the rules. Cummings then moves on to giving his opening statement.
The committee is now voting on whether to table the matter. Essentially, Dems are voting to continue the hearing, Republicans are voting to postpone.
The hearing begins with a point of order from Republican Rep. Mark Meadows. He says Cohen violated committee rules by not sending in his testimony 24 hrs in advance. He says it was an "intentional effort...to show his disdain for this body." Wants to postpone hearing.

Timing! Top House Dems have just issued a statement on Treasury lifting the sanctions on Deripaska‚Äôs companies: 		https://t.co/uPJGNKRc5j
Here‚Äôs some of what Speier wants to know: 		- transaction dates 	- who bought the shares 	- how much they sold for 	- whether Mnuchin sought ethics advice 	- whether Blavatnik has tried to communicate with Mnuchin directly about the sanctions		https://t.co/04kYh2tGn8 https://t.co/j0w3VHOXAJ
‚ÄúBlavatnik had a clear financial interest in the outcome of the Treasury action,‚Äù Speier wrote.	She argued that Mnuchin‚Äôs relationship with Blavatnik and involvement in easing sanctions ‚Äúis clearly a conflict of interest.‚Äù https://t.co/04kYh2tGn8
Here‚Äôs how Blavatnik is connected to Deripaska: Blavatnik co-owns Sual Partners with another sanctioned oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg. Sual owns part of Rusal, one of Deripaska‚Äôs (formerly) sanctioned companies. Blavatnik also served on Rusal‚Äôs board: https://t.co/YibVua3KLz
.@THR reported that Mnuchin sold the shares to Blavatnik for approx. $25 million: https://t.co/OjBzsLsm8x

I had many fun encounters with McCain after that -- numerous scrums where he would often bluntly speak his mind -- but I'll never forget our brief elevator ride together early on in my time in DC. He'll be greatly missed.
I texted my parents right after I got off the elevator to tell them what had happened. I couldn't believe it -- and for one of the first times, I didn't feel like a total outsider in DC. All because one of the most well-known politicians in America showed humility and kindness.
Here I was a new reporter in DC, feeling very lost, and John McCain was in an elevator with me asking me how my day was going and complimenting my publication's work. (He was apparently a fan of our reporting on the war against ISIS).
...language that his wasn't going all that great. (Something Trump-related had happened the day before, but I can't remember what). Anyway, then he takes the time to ask me which "outfit" I was with. I replied BuzzFeed and, to my slight surprise, he said he was a fan of our work!
Inside my head I was like, holy shit! I'm in an elevator alone with John McCain! And I was slightly worried he might be mad I was in the elevator. But he wasn't in the slightest. Instead, we asked each other how our days were going. He replied bluntly with some slightly vulgar...

Prompting someone to yell to Gohmert, ‚Äúyou need your medication!‚Äù https://t.co/CV8nhZFkFt
There is much yelling happening.
Not entirely clear to me what Rep. Gohmert is talking about.
Strzok says Republicans are being selective in which texts they highlight. He says that while he sent a text about impeachment, he also sent a text where he said he wasn‚Äôt sure if there was a there, there in the Russia investigation.
This is interesting from earlier: 		Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen, on Russia: "They engage occasionally in assassination of political rivals?		Strzok: "They do, yes."
Dems are upset that Gowdy is getting to re-ask questions during Democratic time. (Strzok had consulted with FBI &amp; could provide different answers now.) Goodlatte says Gowdy will be allowed to proceed. 		Dems: Could you cite the rule?		Goodlatte: No.
Strzok responds to Republican criticisms of Mueller‚Äôs team as being full of Democrats. Strzok says they‚Äôre the  ‚Äúbest in America‚Äù an that he has ‚Äúcomplete faith and confidence‚Äù that they‚Äôll find the truth.
Strzok also said earlier that his text about a Trump presidency being ‚Äúdestabilizing‚Äù was after Trump made a comment about potentially not adhering to NATO‚Äôs Article 5¬†‚Äî on-topic this week as Trump meets with NATO leaders in Brussels.
Strzok says ‚ÄúI absolutely regret the appearance‚Äù of some of his texts.
DC's Eleanor Holmes Norton has so far referred to the intelligence community as the "intelligence committee" and "intelligence commission."
It's back. Rep. Issa has Strzok reading some of his texts, so the word "douche" has made it into the record.

‚ÄúWe agree to nothing because we were not asked,‚Äù Nadler says re: agreement.
Strzok says he would not object to the release of the transcript.
Cicilline says they‚Äôll give Republicans until 5 pm to provide a rule against releasing the transcript. 		Goodlatte says there was an agreement in place not to do so.
https://t.co/GWFFMb5Esy
Nadler is calling upon Republicans to release the full 11-hour transcript of Strzok‚Äôs closed-door interview with the committees, saying portions have already been leaked &amp; taken out of context.		‚ÄúNot today,‚Äù Goodlatte says.

Chairman Goodlatte is trying to force Strzok to answer, citing potential for contempt. Ranking member Nadler is trying to stop Goodlatte with points of order.
Strzok, being questioned by Rep. Trey Gowdy, is saying he would like to answer questions about the Russia investigation but can‚Äôt because the FBI told him not to &amp; the investigation is ongoing.

Oh, but the committee found one ‚Äúshortcoming in the ICA.‚Äù It has to do with the ICA‚Äôs findings re: RT and Sputnik. https://t.co/9qhe40YOKb
ICA: Putin/Russia wanted to "undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton‚Äù and "developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump."		SSCI: ‚Äú[T]he ICA provided a range of all-source reporting to support these assessments." https://t.co/gyIl1HdSl1
The report says "further details have come to light that bolster the assessment‚Äù that Russian interference in 2016 "demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations." https://t.co/FNOHoA7IRQ
Here, the committee addresses the issue HPSCI Republicans had with the ICA. https://t.co/V1PCrz6DAA
"The Committee finds that the Intelligence Community met President Obama‚Äôs tasking and that the ICA is a sound intelligence product." https://t.co/28I6w1y3zO
"In conducting its examination, the Committee reviewed thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties including agency heads, managers, and line analysts - who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment." https://t.co/4tfo80kTYE
The committee previously announced that it agreed with the findings of the ICA ‚Äî splitting with Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, who took issue with the part about the Russians‚Äô preference for Trump ‚Äî but now we have the summary report. Reading through now...

Burr said that to his knowledge, neither McCabe nor Comey has responded to the committee‚Äôs letters yet.
Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, says the committee has invited former FBI director James Comey and former deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe to testify in likely an open hearing as part of the Russia probe.

Daniel: ‚ÄúNow that the Russians have proven that cyber means can be used to engage in election interference in the United States, we should expect that they will continue to engage in such activities and that other actors will follow their lead, including non-nation state actors."

Bit of a heated moment between Warner and Cotton about John Brennan. Cotton interrupted what Warner was saying and Burr had to hit the gavel and tell Cotton to stop.
Hearing is wrapping up. Burr asks Haspel to summarize who Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri are.

"I do not recall being aware of that,‚Äù Haspel tells King of press reports and legislation re: torture that appeared right before the tapes were destroyed.

Sen. King asks Haspel whether her roles in the CTC were related to the RDI. She won‚Äôt answer in an open session. He then grills her about her role in declassifying information about her career (she‚Äôs acting director). She insists she‚Äôs following guidelines.
Another protester, yelling "Bloody Gina!," is removed by Capitol Police. https://t.co/NUcVPvzQmo

Haspel still won‚Äôt say if she thinks torture is immoral. 		"I think that we should hold ourselves to a stricter moral standard,‚Äù she says.		Sen. Heinrich: Where was that moral compass at the time?		Haspel says it was 17 years ago &amp; basically she was following orders.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not getting back in that business,‚Äù she says.
Haspel says she does not believe Trump would ask her to waterboard a high-value detainee, prompting some laughs from the room. 		If he did, though, she says she would say that "CIA is not the right place to conduct interrogations‚Äù &amp; it should be the military.
Collins asked what Haspel‚Äôs reaction was when she learned of the RDI program. Haspel doesn‚Äôt really answer: 	"It was a new subject for me‚Ä¶we didn‚Äôt have interrogators‚Ä¶I was told that interrogation experts had designed the program..‚Äù and POTUS/etc approved it.
Haspel tells Sen. Collins that she was not involved in the creation of the RDI program.
https://t.co/AIjjOjvntu
Sen. Wyden, strong opponent of Haspel‚Äôs nomination, asks if Haspel would oppose declassifying the DOJ‚Äôs Durham investigation about the tapes‚Äô destruction.		"I have not read the Durham report," she says, adding that she wants to look into it first.
Sen. Rubio focuses on the threat posed by China, asks Haspel if she would use a Huawei phone. 		"I wouldn‚Äôt use Huawei products,‚Äù she says.
Haspel was also asked about the torture of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and her role in it. Says she can‚Äôt answer in an open setting.

Feinstein is quoting from John Rizzo‚Äôs book that seems to reference Haspel but not by name. Haspel says she did not run the interrogation but was "absolutely was an advocate‚Äù of destroying the tapes if it could be done within the law.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she likes Haspel personally a lot and that this is one of the most difficult hearings for her.

‚ÄúI would never, ever, take CIA back to an interrogation program‚Ä¶We followed the law then, we follow the law today,‚Äù Haspel says.
Warner asks Haspel if torture program was consistent with American values.		Haspel: "With some distance‚Ä¶We have decided to hold ourselves to a stricter moral standard‚Ä¶I support [that].‚Äù		But Warner wants a less legal-type answer.
Warner up now. He says then-Sen. Levin in Nov. 2005 introduced legislation to create an outside commission. Three days later, Haspel drafted the cable to destroy the tapes. 		"The timing seems very close,‚Äù he says.		"I don‚Äôt recall pending legislation,‚Äù she says.
Haspel on Rodriguez: "He decided to take the decision on his own authority."

They were ‚Äúextremely concerned about the security risk that was posed to our officers‚Äù because they appeared on video. 		"I did not appear on the tapes,‚Äù Haspel says.
First Q from Burr is about the destruction of interrogation tapes in 2005. Haspel was chief of staff to Jose Rodriguez at the time.		"The tape issue had lingered at CIA for a period of about 3 years,‚Äù Haspel said.

Haspel said that she volunteered to work at the CTC on 9/11 and that in the years after employees worked 7 days a week, postponed weddings and having children.
Haspel on the torture program: "We were asked to tackle a mission outside our expertise."		As SSCI report found, "CIA was not prepared to conduct a detention and interrogation program‚Äù		"I fully support the detainee treatment required by law,‚Äù she says (ie Army Field Manual).

The Lee amendment fails. Graham and Tillis voted against it, couldn‚Äôt hear the rest.
Sen. Ben Sasse says it would be ‚Äúpolitically suicidal‚Äù for Trump to fire Mueller but has concerns about the constitutionality of the bill.
Here is the Lee amendment, btw: https://t.co/6LdxXISTA2
Tillis, one of the cosponsors of the bill, says he opposes the Lee amendment, which would ‚Äúgut‚Äù the bill. He also says the amendment "makes this about Mueller,‚Äù whereas he‚Äôs concerned about future special counsels.
Grassley says there are 6 or 7 amendments that will be proposed today.
Lee has constitutional concerns about the bill &amp; Grassley‚Äôs amendment.

A bit of ~ committee drama ~. Now that everyone‚Äôs here, Republicans want to get the vote done (there‚Äôs also a floor vote happening right now). Democrats want to keep speaking. Corker is allowing everyone to speak.
Paul on Pompeo: "I have changed my mind‚Ä¶he‚Äôs assured me that he‚Äôs learned the lesson."
(Paul had noted Trump‚Äôs opposition to certain wars and claims to want to end current ones.)
"I want Trump to be Trump,‚Äù Paul says.
Paul is speaking: "We‚Äôve been at war for too long and in too many places,‚Äù he begins, and says he‚Äôs been opposed to the nomination ‚Äúfor a long time.‚Äù
Just now, after Sen. Rubio was done speaking, Corker stopped and pointed out: "I could call the vote right now and he would be voted out positively.‚Äù (Coons, a Democrat, is the last to arrive. He just got here.)
Earlier, Corker spoke about Pompeo‚Äôs qualifications and the committee‚Äôs history. He says it's "been an island in a sea of partisanship.‚Äù

Sen. Mark Warner, vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, said Congress should "absolutely" do something now to protect Mueller and that he agrees with Sen. Lindsey Graham's comments about how Trump firing Mueller would be "the beginning of the end of this presidency."

Corker says he hasn't started talking to colleagues about a Syria AUMF, "because I don't expect there to be anything that's sustainable that's discussed." 		Think he meant he doesn't expect any strikes to be of a sustained nature.
Corker: "If we are going to go against the regime on any kind of sustained basis, there has to be an AUMF, ok? But if there's something surgical in response to humanitarian issues, that would not be necessary."
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker says there does not need to be a new AUMF for strikes in Syria "if they're surgical in nature."		He said there's "no question" they'd need a new AUMF if the US undertook a prolonged effort against Syria, though.

- During that period, the IRA spent ~$100,000 on 3,000+ ads on Facebook &amp; Instagram, which ~11 million people in the US saw.		- They found "about 120,000 pieces of content‚Äù on Instagram where they say their ‚Äúdata on reach is not as complete."
- Zuckerberg says Facebook‚Äôs "best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been served content from a Facebook Page associated with the IRA at some point during that period."
Some highlights: 		- Facebook found ~470 accounts &amp; pages linked to the Internet Research Agency, "which generated around 80,000 Facebook posts over about a two-year period."

Nielsen says election security is ‚Äúof extreme urgency to the department."

I think the only SSCI members who aren‚Äôt here are Wyden and Risch. Reed, an ex officio member, is also here.
Warner says he thinks DHS has ‚Äúpicked up its game‚Äù in recent months but still more work to do.
Warner said it took DHS nearly 9 months to notify top state election officials that their systems had been targeted.
"We were all disappointed that states, the federal government, and the Department of Homeland Security weren‚Äôt more on their game‚Äù in 2016, Warner says.

Though this presser is about election security, expect questions on a range of issues, including Cambridge Analytica. Maybe committee chairman Richard Burr will tell us his position on bringing them and the tech CEOS in for a hearing.
You should also follow @kevincollier for  this and other election security stuff.
Also, the committee wants old voting machines to get the boot. "States should rapidly replace outdated and vulnerable voting systems. At a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability."
The committee wants Congress to ‚Äúurgently pass legislation increasing assistance and establishing a voluntary grant program for the states.‚Äù States should use the money to hire more IT staff, update software, pay for cybersecurity services, and more, the committee says.
Some highlights so far from the draft recommendations: The committee found that the ‚ÄúU.S. election infrastructure is fundamentally resilient.‚Äù 	Steps have been taken to address the issue "but more needs to be done."

There is "significant evidence of collusion" between the Trump campaign and Russia, Schiff says. But question Mueller will have to answer is whether it rose to the level of a crime.
Schiff says one area that neither the Senate nor the House Intel committees have looked into enough is money laundering. He said he hopes Mueller has been given "the latitude" to do that.
"We'll be setting out the facts that we know to date" and putting them in context, Schiff says of their report. Will also point out how incomplete the investigation was, he says. 		AND they'll be appending all interview transcripts to the report, he says.
On Republicans' draft report, Schiff says: "It is little more than another Nunes memo in long form."		They will write a minority report, he says. Not ideal, wanted bipartisan report, he says.
