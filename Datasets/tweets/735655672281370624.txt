@DrakeThomas22 @CalebJHull @egavactip Furthermore,  if the purpose of the troll is to discredit people who are calling out racism, so that racists can get away with saying racist shit, then ultimately that makes it racist. This isn't hard.
@DrakeThomas22 @CalebJHull @egavactip You seem reasonable, so I'll say this once. This isn't the hill you want to die on. Pitcavage said himself that symbols evolve. This symbol/troll is no longer acceptable to polite society. The reason I know that is because of the action taken by the Coast Guard today.
@DrakeThomas22 @CalebJHull Not spending my afternoon hunting @egavactip 's twitter feed to find you proof, but he has indeed (reluctantly, I think) changed his position.But even if it is "just a troll", it deliberately enflames racial and partisan tensions. How is this acceptable? It's not a good look.
@DrakeThomas22 @CalebJHull The ADL has reversed that position,  FYI.
@CalebJHull That's how the rest of us feel about the cutesy race-baiting gotcha troll. It's a real thing, unfortunately. So, yeah, we're  still doing this. When the white identity freaks stop using it, we'll stop pointing it out, and it can go back to meaning ok, or asshole in sign language.

@marcorubio your party can nominate another qualified conservative jurist who hasn't shown himself to be a criminal. Brett Kavanaugh has lied under oath, repeatedly, and we all saw it. Is this something you can condone? A criminal for SCOTUS? He should be impeached, not elevated.
@marcorubio take heed. I've Never voted for you. Probably never will. I've also never actively worked against you, and I've supported you when I felt like you deserved it. That all changes if you vote to confirm Kavanaugh. My wallet and my time will work overtime to beat you.
