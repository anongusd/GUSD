Bernie made 1 Dem Gov endorsement in 2016 - Sue Minter in VT - &amp; she went on to lose the general by 10 points - in Bernie's own state!
Anyone who thinks Bernie's endorsement of Perriello will help in the general should ask Sue Minter how well his endorsement worked for her. https://t.co/Qj0zgjbS2w
