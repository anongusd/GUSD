@realDonaldTrump Walls work. Even in the era of drones, experimental direct energy weapons, and infrared.  		The United States Military still builds walls around important locations.		Our Country is an important location.

@realDonaldTrump That is an excellent point.  Maybe we (the people) should bring a class action suit against the media -- for fake news purporting to be fair news reporting.  The issue may be "The Communication Decency Act."
@realDonaldTrump No one is more effective at discrediting ‚Äújournalists‚Äù than the ‚Äújournalists‚Äù themselves. In their zeal to ruin Trump, they have shown the world who they really are and ruined themselves.
@realDonaldTrump Please declassify everything, Mr President. They are going to attempt impeachment regardless. To hell with the idea that revealing this investigation as a criminal scam is somehow 'obstruction of justice'.
@realDonaldTrump I love how he just calls her crooked now.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There has been no Russian collusion unearthed. NONE. Yet the left see the "probe" as a success, despite it's total failure in stated mission, because it is punishing Trump associates, and harassing the President.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Imagine being so squeaky clean as is Trump that the whole world has the biggest magnifying glass on your for 2 years and comes up with nothing
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews If Mueller had a case, he wouldn't be putting Cohen on the stand and trying the case in the court of public opinion.  This whole ordeal is ugly and messy but not illegal.  No Trump supporter gives a shit if President Trump lied about his sex life.  No Trump supporter is shocked.

@realDonaldTrump THAT'S MY PRESIDENT!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump We need 20 Billion for a Wall (5 Billion is peanuts) with no concessions for the commies.		We also badly need those 10,000 new BP and ICE officers Trump wrote an E.O for last year. Money has not been funded to hire and train them.
@realDonaldTrump The left doesnt care what they said before. That was before Trump. Now they are given the space to reverse their opinions at any moment without any questions as long as it goes against Trump
@realDonaldTrump Trump has brilliantly backed them in a corner. When the government shuts down, they are forced to say they don‚Äôt care about the security of our country. Yes they‚Äôll attempt to spin it, but it‚Äôs a hard position to take when Trump is referring to the border as national security

@realDonaldTrump Mueller has to be held accountable for this travesty. He cannot keep using taxpayer funds to harass and ruin the lives of people in the attempt to damage the President. He has got to be given deadline to wrap up or it will go on indefinitely.
@realDonaldTrump Judge Sullivan next week will be irate and he will gladly let Mr. Flynn testify all the information that he has. He is a great man with a great story to tell. I'm excited!
@realDonaldTrump LOCK UP THE SEDITIOUS CONSPIRATORS AND RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW
@realDonaldTrump Every Republican should answer "I cannot recall" to every question asked including "What is your name?"		The Democrats do it and it looks like a "Get Out of Testimony" Free Card to me.
@realDonaldTrump What they did to Flynn is textbook entrapment.
@realDonaldTrump The longer he holds this over their heads, the more valuable the impact - I'm sure there is a sweet spot for the release and we just aren't quite there yet.  The patience this man has is unreal.
@realDonaldTrump Anyone remember how Nancy Pelosi did not want cameras there for the meeting?
@realDonaldTrump DECLASSIFY EVERYTHING		pull the wool back and let America see for itself what the ruling class have done in our name

@realDonaldTrump They will not stop until they are forced to stop. Our government is too corrupt to be trusted and they can rub it in our faces because we want to play by rules that do not apply to them.
@realDonaldTrump The OIG is a willing participant in the cover up.
@realDonaldTrump The Mueller investigation first and foremost is to cover up Hillary's illegal deeds and if they can snag POTUS it's just the icing on their cake, IMO.

@realDonaldTrump I agree, Comey is totally exposed.
@realDonaldTrump James Comey is a total hack
@WayneDupreeShow Rush pointed out that Trump ambushed them to force them to be transparent about their position. They ran to the microphone right after the meeting to reshape the narrative that he smashed in front of them.
@ChuckCallesto OBSTRUCTIONIST LOSERS
@freedom_moates Trump just made Schumer look like the total tool he is. Awesome
@kayleighmcenany That was brutal. Pelosi looked like a kid sent to bed without any supper.
@KatiePavlich Beautiful. It‚Äôs amazing how democrats are openly opposed to border security, and their voters are just okay with it. Makes no sense.
@esaagar Pelosi/Crying Chuck want don't want us to see what is going on. They then want to dictate the narrative to us about what went on. 100% about controlling the narrative.
@DailyCaller @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump This is the most incredible live television relating to government I‚Äôve ever seen.		Edit: Schumer‚Äôs back was incredibly hunched.

@EdKrassen "We cant afford a shut down right now"		Didn't the same Dems shut down the government over DACA?
@ABC I don't understand how people on the left can hear their reps beg to have the conversation in private, and not be upset at the idea that they obviously want to change their tone when not in front of the press.
@ABC Weird they both Nancy and Chuck don‚Äôt want this meeting held in front of the press. They don‚Äôt want to look like idiots in front of the whole country!
@MSNBC @PeterAlexander @mitchellreports I wish they would have gone back and forth for about an hour, it was just getting good!
@MillenPolitics Man Trump just dominated that.  Pelosi, especially and Schumer, really don't have the agility to debate outside their memorized talking points.		Pelosi and Schumer desperately wanted to get off camera (lets discuss this in private).  That's all you need to know about dems.
@BuzzFeedNews Trump was genius to make this discussion public
@vicenews Schumer said " ‚ÄúWhen a president brags that he‚Äôs won Indiana and North Dakota, he‚Äôs in real trouble,‚Äù Schumer said."  There is Democrat arrogance in a nutshell.  ALL states and ALL Americans count.
@morgfair Meanwhile, Cryin' Chuck sits hunched over at Trump's left, leering and smirking, eyes darting and shifting, tongue flicking out when key concepts are mentioned (money, power, control).
@DavidJollyFL @SenSchumer Nancy: We need transparent government.		Also Nancy: We can't do this in front of the cameras.
@cnnbrk The Democrat leaders came prepared with taking points, and the president came prepared with an agenda.  They're trying to play a PR game, and he's actually trying to accomplish something.
@dcexaminer Typical chucky...grandstanding while the cameras are on. Total show and the president put him in his place. Trump told chucky that he‚Äôs going to shut down the government over the wall...damn right shut it down!
@johncardillo Chuck Schumer has the posture of a jumbo shrimp.
@THEHermanCain CNN: He's a big meanie pants
@marklevinshow Schumer: Elections have consequences		Trump: That‚Äôs why the country is doing so well		deepstate btfo

@realDonaldTrump So Comey, as FBI director, was out of the loop on all matters involving the FBI? Good thing Trump fired him.
@realDonaldTrump Please declassify the documents (although, I'm 100% sure the FBI would slow walk it as much as they could).
@realDonaldTrump I'll just leave this here.......		"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." ~ Thomas Jefferson		DRAIN THE SWAMP ISN'T A CATCHPHRASE
@realDonaldTrump Gotta love the convenient and selective amnesia of key players, immunity deals being handed out like candy and massive number of leadership firings that occur on the left... but somehow, in their eyes, they're "scandal free." Nothing untoward was happening at all, lol.
@realDonaldTrump "Okay, Mr. James...Comey? What makes you think you're qualified to be the new head of the FBI?"		"I don't know."		"You're hired!"
@realDonaldTrump If only he knew someone who could declassify all the information and order a special counsel investigation ...
@realDonaldTrump Leakin' Lyin' James Comey
@KjelMitze @realDonaldTrump @FBI That is exactly what I‚Äôm saying.
@realDonaldTrump FBI director with amnesia? How did got the job in such condition?
@realDonaldTrump Declass, then arrest the traitors. Very legal. Very cool.
@realDonaldTrump Being FBI Director must be a pretty cushy job if it can be done by such a clueless dunce like Comey.
@realDonaldTrump PROSECUTE COMEY NOW!!!
@realDonaldTrump The delusion in the twitter comments is STRONG.
@realDonaldTrump Weasel Comey thinks he is Hillary		‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know‚Äô - 166 times		'I don‚Äôt remember' - 71 times		‚ÄòI don‚Äôt recall‚Äô - 8 times
@realDonaldTrump Comey: "No, I'm not lying! I was just completely incompetent at my job."
@realDonaldTrump He went to the Hillary school of testimonials
@realDonaldTrump If Trump says Comey is lying, it means they have the evidence.
@realDonaldTrump I dont know		I dont know		I dont know		I dont know		I dont know		I dont know		I dont know		Look im now qualified to be the head of the FBI

@realDonaldTrump It's amazing what we can get done when we have a President who actually knows how to made deals with people.
@realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't get enough credit for being the only candidate to talk about the opioid crisis. Even my super liberal dad who hates Trump admits that he was the only one who came to my home state and addressed the number 1 issue.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Mueller redacted large portions of the document to send the Democrats and the MSM into a frenzy by stating that Flynn is helping and then redacting.  Mueller is a snake and this was a sneaky move.  It is Mueller‚Äôs way of admitting that Flynn did nothing wrong!
@KellyAngard @activist360 I‚Äôm sure he does.
@jaketapper It‚Äôs funny watching you guys spin this Jake. It‚Äôs time to shut down the witch-hunt don‚Äôt you think?

@tedlieu Liberals and Trump haters are going to freak out when nothing comes of all of this. How much did this cost should be the next question.
@ZoeTillman Will Liberals disavow all of their hateful and spiteful comments towards this great man now that he's been cleared of wrong-doing?
@ChuckCallesto Thank God. I wish the best to him and his family
@charliekirk11 No jail time means this is a nothing burger. Looks like they redacted a lot in the report to have an excuse to extend the witch hunt all the way to 2020.
@TwitterMoments Mueller's team has nothing, and Flynn was a pawn. But they add the "substantial assistance" comment to feed the lib media, who will point to that as why Flynn isn't going to jail. Then Mueller's team redacts a bunch of nonsense to make it seem like Flynn maybe spilled dirt. Sad!
@TwitterMoments Mueller shouldn't even be in a position to recommend sentencing, isn't that the job of a real life Judge?  Good for Flynn, but this whole thing is a pathetic witch hunt!

@realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter if Mueller has evidence. They don't operate based on truth. They operate based on fixing the judge and jury and tampering with evidence.		Trump needs to flat out send the dogs after Mueller and arrest him and his cohorts.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller is likely covering up everything so that there is not a constitutional crisis and a civil uprising.
@realDonaldTrump It seems that the dems are getting desperate.
@realDonaldTrump Trump has known probably from before he took office what happened.  The slow rollout is likely necessary to keep the world economy from having spasms.
@realDonaldTrump Where is the IG REPORT?
@realDonaldTrump We need to stop this before our country devolves into further chaos.
@realDonaldTrump The witch hunt must end!
@realDonaldTrump SHUT IT DOWN AND LOCK UP JOHN BRENNAN

@realDonaldTrump She is doing great after Reinhold Richard "Reince" Priebus turned out to be a dirty leaker.		Remember when the Mooch fired him? Good times.
Gettin into the spirit of the season! https://t.co/gQeO6krTRV
@cnsnews My only problem with Mark‚Äôs opinion is that he says Trump should only do this if he decides not to run for re-election. I say, fire these assholes anyway. If Congress tries to impeach him, they will be the ones who lose out in the end.
@LauraButler6 @DHSgov They would probably be the best folks to look into this matter.
Seems like someone needs to investigate and prosecute those organizers for misleading thousands of people and putting them in harms way (for a profit, I‚Äôm sure) https://t.co/qHi7GwKv8q
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like that is the best course of action Mr. President
@rgoodlaw Ohhhh so lying to Congress is a crime now? Does that only count for people who worked for Trump?		Because I can name a handful of people who lied to Congress under oath and didn't get any jail time.
They have Trump now.  Cohen, according to the news reports, has spilled the beans on all sorts of Trump's legal (aka not illegal) activities.		Trump may have done business with Russians - not illegal.		Trump may have talked about pardoning people - not illegal. https://t.co/fhvq0GP6a2
@realDonaldTrump Has anyone seen how many are saying the investigation didn't spend any money? They're all saying how it actually made money because of all the Manafort seizure. This isn't going to play out well for any of them.
@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas Libs all the people you look up to will soon be in jail.
@realDonaldTrump McCarthy did nothing wrong. Commies are traitors. Change my mind.

@realDonaldTrump Apparently the GM booth in the CA auto show is not being well received and Barra has not shown her face according to Fox.
@realDonaldTrump General Motors stockholders need to revolt. The company is being used as a political tool and not a money-making business that provides income to the shareholders.		Force a general shareholders meeting and fire the virtue signaling CEO
@realDonaldTrump Pull the subsidies. They clearly don't have our best interests at heart. Let's return the favor.
@realDonaldTrump GM is being run by Communists. Just call their loan we gave them and let them fail in China and Mexico
@realDonaldTrump I know we all keep saying it, but this has got to be finally leading up to something. He isn‚Äôt going on this twitter for it all to lead to nothing and end up with egg on his face
@realDonaldTrump This is how you get modern fascism. You make everything a crime and then selectively enforce it on your enemies. It doesn't matter how many capital crimes Crooked Hillary has committed, the deep state protects it's own.
@realDonaldTrump I don't ever recall a Trump tweet storm about the Mueller investigation including retweeting a picture of the deep state getting jailed for treason. Something huge is definitely brewing behind the scenes.
@realDonaldTrump This witch hunt has to be coming to an end soon. He's getting extremely vocal about it lately.
@realDonaldTrump He's been coming out and throwing haymakers lately.  I want to see him when he's mad.
@realDonaldTrump Raise the tariffs on them Mr. President!

@ericlarouge Keep America Great! Gotta have the exclamation point on there. President Trump said it one of his rallies about 8 months ago.
@GatoVolador496 Exactly!
@realDonaldTrump When Mueller's in prison he will have a lot of time to write "The Art of the Witch Hunt"
@realDonaldTrump If We March on Washington, it will be the nail in their coffin. Conservative Republicans do not protest/march/rally. If we were to show up in front of Congress the world would take notice. Congress would have to take notice.
@realDonaldTrump If Mueller had evidence to charge President Trump with a crime he would have wrapped up the investigation long ago. Right now he's focused on desperately trying to bring perjury charges on people for any little detail they misremember.
@DaveLanga @realDonaldTrump I sure hope so!
@realDonaldTrump Our Founding Fathers would never have allowed a shadow government entity like the NSA/FBI/CIA to exist.
@realDonaldTrump Man in the Moon is more real then Mueller's Hoax!
@realDonaldTrump Trump‚Äôs really been on the warpath the few days. I‚Äôm not ready to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs happening‚Äù, but there‚Äôs definitely something big coming.
@realDonaldTrump You can just tell he knows he holds all the cards and has all the intel on the corrupt officials in the last last administration. It's why he has never once looked worried and is cocky about it all.
@realDonaldTrump And Dems will act as though nothing happened on their side when Mueller‚Äôs report comes out.		THEN, DECLASSIFICATION!
@realDonaldTrump Indefinitely. Infinitely. The sheep will NEVER wake up - that's the ultimate truth.		Unless Trump drops the biggest hammer of all time, there is nothing left.
@realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs interesting is that such a narrative has much less weight now because of the fact that Mueller went after Trump‚Äôs people for two years. So when Trump‚Äôs DOJ goes after Democrats, they will squeal, they will cry foul, but everyone will point out the witch hunt against Trump.
@realDonaldTrump In case people don't know here, Jerome corsi went on MSNBC and said he will go to prison for life instead of turning on the POTUS. Hence the POTUS saying crazy shit is happening.
@realDonaldTrump We gotta drop the biggest hammer on Earth upon these criminals or else America is finished.

@realDonaldTrump The reason McCarthy was demonized by the Left is because the Left must always make sure that anti-Communism is perceived as a bigger threat than Communism.
@realDonaldTrump Well he was right about the commies infiltrating our government.

@realDonaldTrump My vote for Trump was the greatest vote I've made in the 15 years of being eligible to vote and I just can't imagine anyone topping him. Greatest. President. Ever.

@realDonaldTrump Fire Mueller!  He‚Äôs a corrupt POS!  Appoint a special prosecutor to go after all of the ones involved in spygate, FISA fraud and obstruction of justice regarding the Clinton email scandal.   McCabe, Comey, Page, Strzok, Ohr, Mueller, Rosenstein!!!  All of them!!
@realDonaldTrump The moron lefties are going to be trying to cover up their crimes against Americans forever, or until they can slither back into power in the swamp.		We need to bring charges against them all.  If we do not prosecute them, we are guilty of allowing them to get away with it all.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller report is going to be like climate "science" report
@realDonaldTrump Individuals from the FBI and DOJ with members of the Obama administration interfered in the 2016 election. They thought Clinton would win and nobody would ever find out. Mueller is trying to fix it and he is attempting to interfere in the upcoming Presidential election.
@realDonaldTrump All of which are felonies on her part, by the way.  She is guilty of at least thirty violations of the Classified Information Procedures Act.

@realDonaldTrump I'm 100% convinced Mueller is trying to screw Trump.  Trump's been impeaching Mueller's credibility so long now that it would be inconceivable to pull at 180 at this point.
@realDonaldTrump How long will this keep getting strung along, it's either illegal or not. All this is showing us is the people really in power never left.
@realDonaldTrump Washed? Like with a cloth?

@realDonaldTrump Audit them as well.		These companies are such trash.  Trump gave them a huge tax cut and they screwed America over.
@realDonaldTrump Not only that but Obama Motors has yet to pay back the hand out they got. The other two Detroit manufacturers who were FORCED to take the money have paid it back in full LONG ago.
@realDonaldTrump I'm old enough to remember that when Obama bailed out GM, he pushed their Democrat-controlled unions to the front of the rescue  line and non-union American workers, car owners, and investors to the back of the line.		He did it for his people, not for GM or America.
@realDonaldTrump Tariff's on GM cars made in China and mejico.		Whatever GM makes in the USA can be free of tariffs.		Let's see how long those China and Mexican plants remain open.
@realDonaldTrump @GM Capitalism would've let GM go into bankruptcy and reemerge without it's twisted and inefficient structure.  Obama threw a bad organization a few billion dollar bone to save the UAW unions.
@realDonaldTrump @GM Biting the hand that feeds them, we taxpayers saved this company and now they just want to sell us Chinese and Mexican shit quality products.
@realDonaldTrump Not sure I'd buy a GM made exclusively by Chinese or Mexican labor. It's going to be poorly made, and the Chinese government will likely install some sort of spyware in it. It's literally a potential breach of privacy, and a safety threat.
@realDonaldTrump @GM How much did the car companies get from the Obama bailout again?		Please refresh my memory.
@realDonaldTrump @GM Screw GM. Cut the subsidies. We have leverage, use it.
@realDonaldTrump @GM The only incentives these companies should get is the ability to avoid tariffs if they incorporate and manufacture domestically.
@realDonaldTrump Canada got a plant closed in Ontario by GM today. Doug Ford and Trudeau are trying to reverse the decisions, let‚Äôs see how it goes, tons of Canadians employed in these factories, but of course GM prefers cheap Mexican/China labour than Canadian/American.
Why not just go to Brownsville? https://t.co/KvOXOvx9VN

@realDonaldTrump We should put at least 50,000 heavily armed Marines on the border authorized to use deadly force. What we saw yesterday was a dry run for bringing millions of military age men from failed socialist/communist states to vote for those same failed policies here in America.
@realDonaldTrump Tear gas against barricaded criminals- good		Tear gas to control riots- good		Tear gas to keep an invading army from destroying our country- VIOLATION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS TREATIES
@realDonaldTrump The President has the entirety of the United States Marine Corps at his command, and a former Commandant as his SecDef.		EDIT: Few alive have ever really seen Presidential authority exercised on domestic soil. It‚Äôs a very tricky situation, but we have precedence.
@realDonaldTrump I bet some judge would order to open the border again.
@Marylou257 I have no idea.
@realDonaldTrump Dear Santa, for Christmas I want a podesta perp walk.
@realDonaldTrump Even if it's a bunch of nothing and a few campaign staffers hiring prostitutes or Trump once peeing on a NYC sidewalk in 1977, the left is going to act like it's the biggest thing since Watergate, WWII and 9/11 combined.
@realDonaldTrump DROP THE HAMMER GEOTUS
@realDonaldTrump I hope President Trump will do what he must to prevent the witch hunt from causing a constitutional crisis
@realDonaldTrump The report will attempt to damage POTUS politically since the ONLY real purpose of the "investigation" is to hide the malfeasance by the Clinton campaign, DOJ, FBI, and Obama admin when they ILLEGALLY spied on the Trump campaign.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller was a way to slow down Trump the outsider for the first two years. Now that they got the house to do mueller part 2 investigations, he‚Äôs no longer needed by the deep state.		Very methodical, they wanted all four years of investigations and are getting it.
@realDonaldTrump He already knows it's a nothing report.
@dosepoet He sure does and so do the millions of us that have fought for this country. I don‚Äôt mean arguing about it on social media, I mean picking up a weapon and heading into an actual combat zone and defending her.

@realDonaldTrump He won't close the border, just like he won't leave the TPP, meet with Kim Jong Un, or impose aluminum and steel tariffs.
@realDonaldTrump planes, trains, and automobiles.		all are acceptable.
@realDonaldTrump That's the bottom line, because President Trump said so.
@realDonaldTrump Hearing the president of America talk like that is music to my ears.
@realDonaldTrump they have to go back
@realDonaldTrump Thank God for Trump
@realDonaldTrump Trump is an amazing leader who does not buckle under pressure and does everything in his power to keep his promises to voters. Sure, he wont always succeed, but nobody can say that he isn't trying, or giving it everything.
@realDonaldTrump Protecting foreign borders = good		Protecting American borders = bad		More from CNN at 9
