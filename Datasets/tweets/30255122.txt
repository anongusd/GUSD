@BlameBigGovt Seen them fired in games... video games are part of her evidence that they shouldn't be available to civilians (which they already aren't). JFC.
@BlameBigGovt @KenGardner11 They've got momentum and seem pretty determined to lose the support of anyone to the right of Nancy Pelosi.
@gionobili @DefPenHoops It's not distractions. The roster just wasn't constructed well. They've got guys playing up to their talent... those guys just aren't All Stars. We'll see what happens in free agency, but this roster is performing exactly as expected.
@usatodaynba @NBATV Wait, DSJ missed a dunk? That doesn't sound right...
@nbadraftnet For all the style and skill, which is undeniable, how does a ton of dribbling, poor movement off the ball and mediocre defense translate to wins?
@BillSimmons Did you know Boston has a bunch of young guys who don't get "it" and need to be shown up in public by a teammate?
@smod4real Make it happen cap'n
@NateSilver538 Im shocked the "I'm Magic Johnson!" strategy isn't working
@letsrundotcom Less money and it would have required running an additional indoor race. Tough choice there.
@BlameBigGovt Im all for the Christian notion of forgiveness. He shouldn't be damned to hell and isn't beyond redemption. But that is totally separate from criminal justice. Also requires acceptance of responsibility and good works to undo the damage he caused.
@BlameBigGovt From what I've gathered, he twice faked "hate crimes" to get sympathy. Would have testified against innocent people, but refused to testify when he realized it would lead back to him. Continues to blame others for his situation.
@BlameBigGovt Is it clear that he actually feels embarrassed or ashamed of this?  I've wanted to ignore this story, but what's with the sympathy?
@smod4real How's your 2020 campaign looking? You've got a compelling message. DM me if you need a campaign manager.
@ForecasterEnten @Graniteprof I've never understood why anyone cares who wins Iowa when New Hampshire has always been far far far more predictive. Candidates can lose in Iowa, but there are no real winners there.
@BlameBigGovt @splcenter Bill Laimbeer's teammates liked him just fine, too.
@BlameBigGovt @splcenter Because they're on the same team
I've said for &gt;year that Boston is better without Kyrie. He's amazing, but doesn't fit on-court or in locker room. Imagine if they had Vucevic or Sabonis instead. @BillSimmons @ZachLowe_NBA
@BlameBigGovt @SenGillibrand She's just the worst. Nobody thinks that's risky. The only jerome who don't want her to run (most people) feel that way because she'll say anything to get elected.
@BlameBigGovt And ever since Thomas Jefferson  told him that...
@CillizzaCNN "Massive conservative counterattack". You mean people saying "this was all BS to make conservatives look bad?"		FFS dude. Are you incapable of saying "hey, my politician buddies were wrong" without qualifying it and finding a way to take a shot at your political opponents?
@neontaster It's always disappointing to see anyone look at a politician and say "yeah, but this one is different!" No, a politician is a politician. They are governed by self-interest first. To think otherwise is incredibly naive. #FeelTheBern
@allahpundit Patience. A watched head never explodes.
For an infuriating follow, it's hard to do worse than @askRegions bank. They give terrible financial advice and try to get people to take loans from them for stupid reasons. Absolute parasites. #debt
@askRegions Delete your account. Encouraging people to go into debt for a party. You're a parasite.
@kpelton None of it matters
@BlameBigGovt Everyone must do whatever we say, otherwise they are racist hypocritical racists.
@b_arthurs_tunic @UnclehammySteve @20002ist @ByronTau @HotlineJosh That's not at all the point I made. It's easy to come up with simple routes like NYC to Boston. But huge parts of country would be prohibitively difficult and expensive to build HSR. It's only (mildly) practical in a few areas of a huge country.
@molratty I can't believe time has to be spent refuting something like this.
@ACMESalesRep @IncognitoMeems @ByronTau @HotlineJosh And there's one huge problem with your thinking. Planes can fly over, but they can also fly *to* the in between places. A plane can fly to any city that has an airport. Are you not aware trains need tracks?
@ThatLawyerDude @ByronTau @HotlineJosh I don't understand your phrasing. Are you saying right now it takes 3 days to fly from NYC to Boise? Or that 10hrs with HSR to go NYC-CHI is 1/2 the time it currently takes?
@20002ist @ByronTau @HotlineJosh GND supporters want to remake the entire economy. The plan explicitly says so. You can't only talk about unicorns and rainbows without any of the challenges. This is not a serious proposal.
@20002ist @ByronTau @HotlineJosh I didn't realize the GND stops after "initial upgrade on the coasts." It calls for absurd policies. The details of those policies should be talked about in full - not just the easiest and cheapest parts.
@RicBucher @TheRyanHollins So they have to trade him immediately and get a poor return because he requested a trade? It's spiteful to wait for a better offer?
@ByronTau @HotlineJosh How would you get from New York to Montana? That would require what, 5 or 6 connections, a couple dozen stops, take 24 hours and cost $1000+, right? And that's after spending trillions on trains. Get real.
@CreepyCatGuy @EsotericCD @allahpundit Nobody should take Wilson seriously
@Wu_Tang_Finance @NathanHRubin The point is that rich people are very very bad.
@hoopshype Are you kidding? Flopping is the only answer here. He's insufferable.
@BlameBigGovt The Netflix one is just as good.
@gionobili McMahon drove me crazy last pod. Doesn't come at the issue honestly at all. Watching tons of free throws isn't great, but it's the flopping that people hate.
@CandaceDBuckner He didn't make it...
@CandaceDBuckner @PostSports So he has no idea what's happening with his team, right?
@ZachLowe_NBA This was inevitable. Best player is 33 and not super happy. Second best player is 31 and coming off an injury. Third best is a rookie. Of course they aren't a playoff team.
@redsteeze @nickgillespie Nobody believes that for a second.
@DinaFraioli Happy birthday!
@Wu_Tang_Finance @CNBC Also, he knows jack shit about investing and finance.
@molratty There are plenty of leftists who say ridiculous things every day without fanfare. Even Dems who think she's absurd rally around her because she's the battlefield. Nobody pays attention to or defends the field where the is no battle.
@molratty No need to apologize! I appreciate the response. I don't totally disagree. It's hard to listen to her nonsense. I think it's unlikely she would have been on 60min at all had the right just kept our mouths shut.
@molratty Conservatives need to just stop paying attention to what she says. Don't respond. The response only gives her more oxygen and raises the profile of her "ideas".
@Wu_Tang_Finance The kind of man who wouldn't know to diversify his bonds.
@ZachLowe_NBA Did the Butler thing actually make a difference? Many seemed to expect this would be his last season in Minny even before Butler fiasco.
@JeffZillgitt @usatodaynba Twist his arm with $5million. Yeah, tough decision.
@kausmickey Why would anyone think the Dems care about the material? They want lax, or no, border security. Nobody is dumb enough to care about steel vs. cement.
@CandaceDBuckner She deserves to be paid the same as other coaches, which means she has to decide if she wants to coach or play. Can't do both. We can't always have everything we want. Often we have to choose.
RT @hulu: üèÄ Attention Wizards Fans üèÄ 	 	We‚Äôre teaming up with the @WashWizards to give two lucky winners a VIP fan experience. Retweet this‚Ä¶
@back_ttys There's nothing easier than promising people free goodies, knowing you can blame your opponents if you don't deliver.
@BillSimmons Kyrie and Brown for AD
@ForecasterEnten How much money did Stacey Abrams raise? That's why.
@OfficialNBARefs you can't be serious with the quick techs on the Bulls. Get your guys under control. That was embarrassing.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt If you're spending $250/month eating out, you're not good with money. And if you're donating 7% of your income, that might be a good and generous thing, but it's not a sign of sound budgeting.
@gionobili Apparently Kobe has been trying to mentor him. It's a really really bad idea.
@LMandrakeJr You don't need an invite. You find out where one is and walk in holding a bottle of bourbon.
@adamwren @PeteButtigieg Who? (Said absolutely everyone outside of South Bend)
@ShamsCharania Woj is your source, right? Mine, too.
@Wu_Tang_Finance He needs to diversify his bonds
@TimRunsHisMouth Why would the government be footing the bill for a party for the media that's supposed to be holding it accountable? That should never have existed.
@ComfortablySmug Her complaint about the farewell dinner for outgoing Senators not being to her liking was wonderful.  Really terrific.
@CatSittingstill @NateSilver538 What conservatives are you hanging out with? The person you're describing isn't necessarily conservative, but they are an asshole.
@davidharsanyi Thank you. Over-acting, poor writing, predictable. Just not a good show in any sense.
@NateSilver538 This is master level trolling. You can't possibly believe the "race and gender are why conservatives don't like the socialist" angle.
@CandaceDBuckner They need to blow it up and get assets, but Grunfeld is trading a pick to get Dekker. What the fuck.
@allahpundit Like it's unbelievable that in 6 months he changes his mind...
@CandaceDBuckner Nah. Too much Wizards.
@HartmanAndrew This is insane
@BillSimmons There's an obvious solution and it involves trading a ball dominant pg who doesn't play great defense.
Is there a less competent training staff in professional sports than the @sixers ? They are the bizarro-Suns. #MarkelleFultz
@BillSimmons Trade Kyrie for a big.
@iowahawkblog You joke, but that's the kind of thing Cass Sunstein would sue to stop.
@jaketapper @danpfeiffer @KatrinaNation @danpfeiffer isn't interested in actual analysis or debate. He just needs to make sure we all know he hates Republicans. Noted, Dan.
@CandaceDBuckner Insightful, Coach Brooks. Are you sure?
@Neoavatara @redsteeze Just like Beto!
@JonahNRO This sounds like someone trying to prove their deep knowledge of the universe by saying they know the earth is flat.
@jtLOL Barney is the winner.
@jessesingal @benshapiro A bit?
@VICEUK It has nothing to do with straight or gay and nothing to do with spiritual or atheistic. It's because it's incredibly stupid.
@wojespn Fun fact (for me at least). Went to PR 4 years ago. On the same flight as Melo.
@gionobili @tomhaberstroh It's incredible that a team with Klay and Durant still has issues when Steph isn't playing. The guy is one of a kind.
@jeguth Chris Kattan would like a word
@WindhorstESPN Get that down to 33 and sit out one of a "back2back". Only 6 more of those all season. 4 of those involve terrible teams.
@gionobili @ChrisVernonShow No way Dallas would do that unless a 1st rounder is included.
@BillSimmons Boston absolutely says no. Undersized 4s like Draymond usually don't age gracefully. Also, he's an asshole.
@neontaster Just like how you prove your own innocence by asking the FBI to launch a criminal investigation of you?
What 76ers needed most was a perimeter player "who can take the ball out of Simmons‚Äô hands." What? No, really. What? 		https://t.co/fS1K8d3wGT via @sbnation
@kpelton F- - - - for philly. Awful move.
@ZachLowe_NBA They're not in that top tier anymore. This makes their shooting problem much worse and takes the ball away from Simmons and Embiid. Terrible move.
@ZachLowe_NBA This makes philly much worse. Awful move by Brand.
@CandaceDBuckner Still better than playing for the Wizards.
@NathanWurtzel I don't get it. She's an awful ambassador for their cause. Can't answer the simplest questions. Comes off as knowing nothing about anything. Yet the left continues to hold her up as a spokesperson for their agenda.
@Tristanshouts @ForecasterEnten Tons of people live in DC without being wealthy. They don't live in a sweet Capitol Hill rowhouse or in the heart of Georgetown. But she can figure out a living situation for 2 months before she starts being paid $175k per year.
@Tristanshouts @ForecasterEnten Her claim that there is something wrong with the electoral system is a complaint. It might be one you agree with, but it's def a complaint.
@ForecasterEnten It's not her financial situation people are making fun of. It's her complaining about our electoral process because she can't afford the kind of place she thinks she deserves for 2 months.
If you enjoy watching the @WashWizards train wreck in progress, give @CandaceDBuckner a follow.
@CandaceDBuckner This is pathetic.
@michaelbd @redsteeze Don't engage @chrislhayes he isn't a serious person.
@Neoavatara @redsteeze Didn't you know only white people can commit hate crimes or be racist?
@BillSimmons They don't need to trade him. They need to trade Kyrie for KAT. They don't need a ball-dominator who doesn't play D at the point. They need more minutes for Rozier and a big man.
@BlameBigGovt Vox is a high school level philosophy class.
@dcsportsbog The Wizards are the "out-of-order" restroom.
@BlameBigGovt Because he already has a media cheer squad and tons of cash.
@NYPostOpinion Why is that op-ed like 200 words?  You know your own website doesn't have a character limit, right?
@paulkrugman Good lord you're a hack
@imillhiser Spoken like someone who is getting excuses ready
@CillizzaCNN When did "my opponent is not qualified" become racist?
@jasonelevation A set up for excuses and complaining if the blue wave doesn't happen
@AdamBarajas @WWeingrad @ezraklein @sashatalebi Dave Weigel resigned from the Post after Journolist was exposed by Mickey Kaus and Politico. What DC conspiracy? It was a real thing, run by Ezra Klein. Laugh away, but you look like a fool.
@AdamBarajas @WWeingrad @ezraklein @sashatalebi He's talking about Journolist - a listserv of journalists across dozens of media outlets that went out every morning with the message of the day so that the entire news media could push the same liberal talking points.
@dylanlscott @awprokop "roll back gerrymandering" means gerrymander in their favor, right?
@Neoavatara Every conservative I know rolls their eyes when they hear Dinesh's name.
Austin Rivers is terrible at basketball
Does #Russ get that he's playing an NBA game and not a pickup game? Totally ignoring his teammates and playing zero D.
@ZachLowe_NBA Just turned it on out of morbid curiosity. This is pathetic.
Just turned on the #Wizards game out of morbid curiosity. This seems like a moment for Washington. They can't keep going like this. What a disaster.
@ZachLowe_NBA 14/24. Good Lord.
@ZachLowe_NBA Wiz don't just look bad. They look hopeless. Either Wall or Beal will be traded at some point this year (likely around draft time).
@molratty I still think Dems get a house majority, but it's been interesting to see excuses for under-performing already being test-driven.
One day, @ezraklein will reveal that he's a conservative and #VOX was a sociological experiment to see just how dumb an idea would have to be before the left wouldn't buy it.
@Neoavatara Or the millions of people who work, save, invest or start their own business.
Wizards-Blazers is uuuggggly. I know it's early in the season, but this looks like a pretty bad pickup game. #NBA
@TMFChrisHill @themotleyfool I've put my life savings into a short position on the Wizards.
@voxdotcom I have never heard anyone refer to heart disease as something rich Americans get because of their luxurious lifestyle. Seriously? I get that Vox has to find bad things to say about the wealthy, but this is... very stupid.
Can someone just punch Draymond in the face already?
@BlameBigGovt I'm positive that liking it makes me deep and emotionally interesting. I'm not sure why, though.
@CShadegg Yeah, I forgot the part of the Constitution that says SCOTUS has to make decisions that a political party likes.
@coachthorpe I don't get why anyone thinks Memphis will be even decent this season.
@kpelton In short stretches, he is.
@DavidRutz This is exactly what Democrats want the midterms to be about... huh?
@ForecasterEnten I'm enjoying one right now. It's a solid soda
Kyrie and a pick for KAT? Imagine how much tougher to guard boston would be with KAT and Horford. They have more than enough guys who can dominate the ball and score. Don't necessarily need Kyrie for that.
@TheAtlantic @JamesFallows What was the reason for Rice's visit to his house? Doesn't mean there was an affair, but sounds like they barely knew each other. Simply saying "she left out the back door" isn't exonerating. Still, this should not have ended his run.
@ChrisBHaynes He's getting some really really bad advice. Don't hold out with a team that doesn't need you.
@own__ass More frazzled than stressed
@JonahNRO Can I have some?
@kwakattaq You're my favorite follow
@KevinOConnorNBA The f'n Wizards. The f'n Wiz, man.
@gionobili You mean ESPN?
@pkcapitol You can't possibly have risen this high in your field without knowing the Giffords shooting had nothing to do with the GOP or Tea Party rhetoric. It was a crazy person. Please try to be more accurate.
Still don't think @BetoORourke will win this race, but he's running for Prez. His fundraising ability is off the charts and he resonates with the base. #Beto #2020 #txsen
@BlameBigGovt When President Avenatti appoints two to replace RBG and Stevens, you bet Vox will have a "Thank God the GOP didn't abolish the Supreme Court" piece.
@baseballcrank Ty Cobb. Baseball player, not lawyer.
@BradMossEsq You are really really terrible
@neontaster We're doomed
@BlameBigGovt It used to be called the Journo-list
@HotlineJosh Dems should definitely dump a few more million into this race.
@Nicole_Cliffe Was he not on the show DALLAS?
@ZachLowe_NBA Who thought it was a good idea to have him there? How could that possibly not turned out poorly?
@BleacherReport He took 4 steps after picking it up. You could eliminate one with the "gathering" rule. Still leaves him with 3 steps after gathering. I've now watched it 10 times. One doesn't have to be a "hater" to see this is an obvious travel.
@NBAOfficial I love the NBA and am willing to look past some of its questionable officiating... but you can't be serious. He took 4 steps. I could even buy that his step to the left was "gathering". But after that, he still took 3 steps. #Harden #NBAPreseason
@allahpundit Kavanaugh-calypse. Not Kavanaugh-geddon.
@ZachLowe_NBA The wizards are a mattress. Made to be slept on and constantly laying down.
@BillSimmons Great catch for that final out, but a truly terrible throw to first. Yankees suck.

@ByronYork He's seriously the media's Baghdad Bob.
@BlameBigGovt Agreed. I don't know a single woman who asks for permission to speak. I don't know any adult women who aren't, well, fully formed adults. They are every bit as strong and free as I am and won't be treated as helpless victims.
@chadfelixg It's nonsense. It's the equivalent of "no thinking person could possibly support my opponent."
@Neoavatara Ridiculous how many times I've seen "corroborating witness" be attached to the name of someone who said they have no memory of the incident. "Journalism"....

@NateSilver538 What facts?
@Neoavatara @ishapiro I'm generally for yelling at politicians. 99% of them deserve it.
@guypbenson Manchin voting yes likely means GOP Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed. If it looked like BK was getting confirmed, he couldn't be seen as "helping the enemy get their guy."
@ForecasterEnten I've never heard anyone serious suggest an age limit (except FDR, I guess). It's term limits.
@JaredDudley619 A combo of bad publicity, changing tastes and concussion issues(past &amp; lack of kids playing in the future due to those concerns) is going to devastate NFL in the next decade.
@Neoavatara @espinsegall Anything short of re-nom Garland will be opposed using any tactics necessary, no matter how underhanded.
@Neoavatara @espinsegall If Barrett is nominated, then a week before the vote, an anonymous accuser will claim that she shamed a rape victim in college and was friends with guys in a frat where something bad happened.
@Neoavatara @espinsegall Exactly. It's beyond disingenuous for Dems to say "withdraw &amp; nominate another". It's a certainty that they'll use the same strategy on the next one.
Anyone else get the feeling the bottom is only a few years from falling out of the #NFL? Wouldn't be surprised if next TV contract is smaller and teams start to be valued lower.
Comm Sec Wilbur Ross says the dumbest shit #tariff

@MotherJones This is pathetic
@RobGeorge Yes, but didn't you see - it's to "protect the public"!
@jimgeraghty Because she just needs the headline about Kavanaugh sexual misconduct being reported to the FBI for her own partisan purposes. She doesn't need it to pan out.
@allahpundit Because she doesn't need the FBI to do anything and frankly doesn't want them to. She just needs a headline that says "Kavanaugh sexual misconduct referred to FBI".
@MaVASteve @AG_Conservative Yes
@allahpundit Shared honor with Avenatti
@neontaster And I'm guessing the are a lot more people willing to pursue the childhood education certificate than the metal work one. This person is either economically illiterate or just dishonest about what those stats actually mean.
@kylenabecker @instapundit Of course members of Congress coordinate with outfits like thinkprogress and media matters. Why would anyone assume the left and the far left don't talk strategy and tactics?
@SouthernKeeks Try cauliflower tots. A million times better.
@Holden114 Reputation among good, fair minded people gets you nothing in 2018 politics. The base will always hold you in high regard if you throw a cheap shot at the enemy. True on both sides of the aisle.
@Neoavatara Who could have predicted that this was a partisan Hail Mary of a smear? I, for one, really thought this was legit and done in good faith and the timing was coincidental...
@allahpundit For an organization that throws a hissy fit over being fact checked, @thinkprogress sure seems ok with continuing to mislead people.

@DavidRutz @ReliableSources @weeklystandard @thinkprogress One big problem with Darcy's premise is the existence of non-partisan, non-political fact checkers. There are none. Also, this is a free country, so everyone gets to fact check everyone.
@JoshEberley Imagine if Kwame Brown could have started his career being mentored by David Robinson and Tim Duncan.
@Neoavatara But he's got 25% of the country who will get on their favorite online platform and say "he's right! Trump did the best job in Puerto Rico!" It's shrewd, cynical and despicable to use his cult members to paper over a massive death toll like this.
@BlameBigGovt Yes, but he doesn't say such a thing lightly! That means we should put the whole thing on hold!
@Neoavatara This is like watching a 5 year old announce that nobody in the world will take naps because they don't like naps and then everyone will be happy because nap time will be gone.
@Neoavatara None of this makes sense. In the long history of people shooting other people, "I forgot which apartment is mine" seems like the least likely explanation that could be true.

@neontaster @BlameBigGovt He wasn't going to be confirmed. They're not mad he didn't get confirmed. They're mad the GOP didn't pay a price for not confirming.
@RBPundit According to Democrats, there's nothing wrong with the GOP that can't be fixed by them all becoming Democrats.

I don't get why it's not ok for someone to admit they don't have a simple solution for every complex problem in society. Most problems aren't solved by govt without causing other problems. Nobody will think less of liberals for admitting that.
@KamalaHarris You're wrong about half of this. The other half is partially caused by government intervention. It's ok to admit you (nor any other individual) don't have the solution to all of society's ills.
@BlameBigGovt New Yorkers seize on Chicagoans embrace of casserole as pizza.
@MrJoshPerry @BlameBigGovt Fuck civility. It's on.
How gullible must one be to buy what @realDonaldTrump is saying about the #DonJr #Russia meeting? He changed his story completely. If you believe this explanation, you'll literally believe anything.
@NevilleD35 The economy is just their reason today. If the economy turns tomorrow, they'll blame it on someone else and continue to defend him.
@BlameBigGovt Nope. It's the fault of Republicans, who seized on it.
@jpodhoretz I'm no fan of the Democrats, but that blue wave is coming. The media is awful and biased, but they are not the reason for it. The Dem base is super energized because they oppose Trump.
@LukeRussert I'd also bet LeBron is richer than Trump.
@guypbenson It's also a pretty strong possibility that LeBron is richer than Trump, too.
I am pretty sure LeBron has more money than Trump.
@DaveDuFourNBA It will be Mitchell. Gobert, as amazing as he is, got played off the floor against Houston. Nobody can play Mitchell off the floor. He's also flashier with a bigger personality.

@MicahAdams13 Casey winning it was absurd. Rewarded for being the last person on earth to figure out that 3 points is more than 2 points. McMillan, Pop, Stevens, Snyder, D'Antoni were all MUCH MUCH better.

@Neoavatara @benshapiro The false compassion of giving away other people's money.
@NoahCRothman Even when he was first hired it seemed like a terrible idea. He's hardly the only one who knows how conventions and delegates work or how to manage a campaign. Trump could have picked dozens of others. But he picked Manafort. Why?
@Neoavatara Can "low self esteem" be replaced in casual convo with "Jeff Sessions"? Ex: after an employee was belittled in public by his boss for the hundredth time, he was suffering from Jeff Sessions.
@Neoavatara Because, like 99% of politics, emotions rule the day.
@dubbadub420 @HPbasketball Maybe not a set play - but based on principles. Example, "if you guys find the right matchups or defense seems of balance try out this slip screen." The guys are smart enough to not need Kerr to tell them a specific play. It just sort of materializes.
@BillSimmons @ZachLowe_NBA something I've been thinking about randomly - is it possible the triangle is actually a terrible offensive scheme that only looked good because there were all-time greats running it?

@Sheldon40093759 @MikeyRobert1 @ZachLowe_NBA @HPbasketball He doesn't HAVE to take so many tough shots. He settles for too many after 10 seconds of jabbing when he should have just passed. Taking a pull-up 20 footer doesn't set you up for anything except wasted possessions.
@ehnottooxabi @thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 And even if you eliminated the entire defense budget and devoted all of it to Medicare for All, you're still only 50% of the way to paying for it. Bring up all the boogeymen you want. Math still doesn't work.
@ehnottooxabi @thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 Medicare for All would be an additional $14-28tril over 10 years over what we're projected to spend. She proposed raising $2tril over 10 years. Again, that's not counting her proposal to also spend an extra $4tril on renewable energy. Her math is awful.
@ehnottooxabi @thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 According to her, she will get $2tril over the next 10 years. Even with her broken math, it's a max of $6tril. Estimates on Medicare for All range from $14tril to $28tril.
@ehnottooxabi @thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 She says it will cost $4trillion to switch to 100% renewables, then lists that $4tril as new revenue. Says military budget increased by $700bil last year. It increased by closer to $70bil.
@gionobili Kobe is going to pull the same weight gain bar prank as Lohan in Mean Girls. Tatum shows up at training camp at &gt;300 lbs.
@ehnottooxabi @thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 Didn't say anything about what conservatives believe. Try to stay on topic. She is completely lost here and doesn't have even a basic grasp of economics.
@RobProvince Death, taxes and Paul Krugman being wrong.
@thejcoop @guypbenson @Ocasio2018 She really can't make contact with even an underhand lob of a softball. Truly has no idea what she's talking about.
@Ocasio2018 can't answer even softball questions. Her #DailyShow performance looked like a college frosh the day after her first polisci class. No grasp of numbers, policy details and simple addition.

@UMBCAthletics @UMBC_MBB The Sixers?
@ZachLowe_NBA @mikecwright As usual, great pod. As a Spurs fan though, I'm depressed. Without some phenomenal internal development, I don't see a path to real contention.
@BillSimmons I agree he's acted strangely, but nobody thought he was really going to go to this. It would have been like having dinner with an ex-wife and her family a week after you left her for another woman and filed for divorce.
@MikeyRobert1 @ZachLowe_NBA @HPbasketball Also, part of being a great scorer is doing it efficiently. Being able to hit tough shots is a useful skill, but Melo has always taken too many tough shots. Gotta generate points, not just launch a ton of shots.
@MikeyRobert1 @ZachLowe_NBA @HPbasketball LeBron shot more 3s per game than Melo for the first 8 seasons of their careers. Melo didn't really up his attempts until 6 or 7 years ago. Lebron has been relatively steady in his attempts over his career.
@SeanTrende I'd bet Dems wind up with 52 Senate seats (not including Bernie) and 255 house seats.
@jtLOL And online readership is up infinity %!
@gionobili I'd say it's a combo of volume and efficiency. Melo is an all-timer in the former and very mediocre at the latter.
@gionobili "Best" is tough to define, but other high scorers are just as capable at making tough shots as Melo, but score much much more efficiently.
@gionobili Good point. He is def good at making tough shots, but part of being a great scorer is shot selection. Knowing when to pass early rather than holding until you're forced into a hard shot to beat the shot clock is part of being a great scorer.
@gionobili @JADubin5 It's certainly not most points. If i score 20pts on 10/10 from the field and you score 22pts on 11/30 shooting, then who would you say is the better scorer?
@gionobili There's a difference between leading the league in scoring and being the best scorer. Melo had an effective FG% below the league average for 11of his 15 seasons. Being allowed to shoot all the time, no matter how bad the shot doesn't mean he's great at scoring
@bonedaddy821 @ZachLowe_NBA @HPbasketball He was always a volume shooter. His eFG% was above the league avg only 4 times. Asked to shoulder a big load and took tough shots. Still that's not the stats of an all time great scorer, but a guy who had the green light his whole career.
@ZachLowe_NBA @HPbasketball Thank you. Carmelo led the NBA in scoring once and only had an effective FG% above 50 4 times in his career. LeBron has only had an eFG% BELOW 50 once (as a rookie).
What if #Trump didn't collude with Russia to win, but #Russia has business and personal dirt on him? Like what if they know he's actually broke, rather than being a billionaire?
@iowahawkblog And they are hardly the only source of news. I would guess the number of people in news media has probably increased 5-fold in the last 50 years. But nobody loves talking about their own greatness as much as the news media. Well, with one exception.
@molratty She has a very "I want to speak with your manager" tone every time she speaks.
I feel for #dailynews layoffs, but it's a business and they aren't the only source of news. Democracy in America is not in danger because NYDN is struggling financially (which isn't a new thing, btw).
@daldridgetnt Over/under on number of player-only meetings this season: 13
Comey is obviously running in '20. Talks about ethical leadership and appealing to moderates in the heartland. He has no path to the nomination, but in his mind "last honest guy in Washington" is a winning pitch.
@allahpundit This is pretty transparently a setup for his own candidacy. Who do you think he has in mind when he's talking about ethical leadership?
@MicahAdams13 Nicklaus won the Masters at age 46.
@JLeighton_wx @oneshiningpod @clubtrillion Not sure how, but this resulted in James Harden going to the line for the 37th time that day.

@mkraju New? Dozens of writers covered this weeks ago. It's already been debated and explained.
@Neoavatara This seems exactly what I'd expect from a high schooler. For some reason people expect super sophisticated takes from him. Think of the poorly-reasoned opinions we all had in high school.
@hoopshype This is an absurd question. Oscar is one of the 10 or 15 best players ever. Does anyone outside of OKC think Westbrook will ever reach that status?
@Cavsanada Ownership. It's ownership. I know losing DDR hurts right now, but competent ownership keeps a team stable. How many good players has New York had? Minnesota? Sacramento? Decades of futility anyway. Toronto will be ok - competent owners.
@amber_athey @instapundit The economy isn't good because some people don't own stocks? And when corporations do well, they end profit-sharing programs? This is totally incoherent.
@PTI Raptors. Spurs got as much as possible, but were in a no-win situation. Toronto raised their ceiling and made a rebuild easier if Kawhi leaves after a year.
@allahpundit FFS.
@JoshEberley @nbadraftnet I don't think he will either... but he's been getting (and following) a litter of terrible advice over the last year. No decision is too stupid at this point.

@ZachLowe_NBA Is her baby jumper broken already?
@ZachLowe_NBA @GTemp17 Big problem, besides the overall weakness of the rest of Memphis roster, is age. Conley will be 31 when season begins. Gasol is 33. 2016 version of those guys was very formidable. '18-'19 version, probably not as much.

Watching #WorldCupFinal is saying that there's no crime against humanity too awful for you to not watch #soccer. Your enjoyment of soccer is so important that it doesn't matter if they play the games on a mass grave. #boycottworldcup2018
@FIFAWorldCup is despicable. Using #slavery to build stadiums for 2022 #WorldCup is unconscionable. Everyone who watches the #WorldCupFinal is complicit in the deaths of slaves. Shame on all of you.
How can anyone watch/support the #WorldCup ? They are using slave labor to prepare for 2022. Support today helps #FIFA &amp; WC organizers keep the #slavery going. Boycotting the next one does nothing to help the slaves killed in next 3 years.

@sometingfishy @Luv2Teach7 @PhilippeReines @AnneT313 Yep. But @Luv2Teach7 is either a troll or so blinded by hate for Bannon that he/she isn't worth engaging further.
@Luv2Teach7 @JeffGalliher @PhilippeReines @AnneT313 That wasn't your point. You said that wasn't trespassing and one can't call the police just because someone doesn't obey you. My point was putting someone on blast is a shitty thing to do and hurts someone who didn't do anything wrong.
@Luv2Teach7 @JeffGalliher @PhilippeReines @AnneT313 No it doesn't. Its her property. If someone is harassing another customer, she is well within her rights to ask them to leave. And legally, they have to leave. Again - it is a privately owned business. Nobody has the right to be there regardless of their behavior.
@PhilippeReines @AnneT313 You know what you're doing. You're hoping people begin harassing the store and its owner because they didn't allow people to harass someone you hate in their store. You're part of the problem.
@pegobry At one point, segregation was the moderate position and the 3/5 rule was a result of compromise.

@neontaster just as you would call the cops if you came home and a stranger was sitting at your kitchen table. He's not hurting you, but calling police is absolutely ok in that situation.
@neontaster Is trespassing not a legal issue in that area? If it's a privately owned property and someone won't leave, then there's nothing wrong with calling cops.

I'm sure the slave laborers being killed while preparing for the Qatar #WorldCup are thrilled by the outstanding goals today.

@MarkDeeksNBA @YoungNBA If Durant hadn't been so great, I'd say give it to LeBron. Again, I'm not saying a sweep is totally disqualifying. But LeBron would not only have to be great, but there also be a real lack of great performances from GS players.
@MarkDeeksNBA @YoungNBA The award isn't to whoever won, but the object is to win. Who was the most valuable in helping their team win? Winning a couple, but losing the series is doable. Zero wins makes that case difficult.
@LarryCoon Exactly. He's a nice player, but not the kind of guy you put everything else on hold for and build your entire roster strategy around. If PG and LBJ want to come, they will forget to even call Julius to tell him they aren't resigning him.
@MarkDeeksNBA @YoungNBA You're correct. Like I said, I'm not totally against the idea. He's been superhuman and this is a 20 win team if you replaced him with an avg player. Still, the object is to win, not to only lose narrowly.
@LarryCoon Yeah, I'm with Larry. Sure, they can match any offer, but do they want to match ANY offer? What if some dumb GM offers him $25mil per year?
@MarkDeeksNBA @YoungNBA I'm not 100% against it, but the key word is "valuable." How valuable were you when team loses every game? Obviously LeBron was Cavs MVP, but if it's a sweep whether or not he plays, he probably wasn't the MOST valuable of all players.
@MarkDeeksNBA Don't forget about the Javale McGee jump from the free throw line to dunk, but coming up 2 feet short.

@jeguth Lol. I've been trying to stress to all my athletes that there is no miracle product or fad diet or special supplement that will make them fast.
@coachthorpe If Hood is their difference maker, it won't make a difference.
@anocturnalduck @sixers @ScottONeil Will do. Thanks.
@Sam_Vecenie Is it possible Jerry has enough clout to keep BC on? This is ridiculous.
@sixers you can't possibly think BC  didn't know, right? You've got to just be saying that so you don't have to fire him even though you know its false, right?
exhibit no. 1,765 of DC being a minor league sports town. Was just at #Nats game. No mention of #ALLCAPS. Didn't hear anyone talk about it. Saw only one person wearing a Caps shirt. You'd never know the city even has a hockey team.
@neontaster 2 of them keep breaking off from the group to talk shit about the rest.
@dcsportsbog It takes a real fan base to root for a team about to win a championship. Lived in DC area most of my life and wish it wasn't this way, but the moment this team becomes a fringe playoff team, Chinatown will go back to just being a restaurant district.
@MarkDeeksNBA People make that exact point when talking about Player of Year in NCAA. Its not saying Doncic won't be good (he will be great) because others weren't. Its saying that an award at one level is not an indication of future success in another league.
@devilsplaylist @EsotericCD Issue isn't quality of research or how truthful it is. His delivery and writing is terrible. Every show is just "this is my opinion and the target of my ire is an idiot!!!" I don't necessarily disagree with his take - but that doesn't mean its funny.
@allahpundit Thinking GOP will be ok based on generic ballot polls is like thinking Cleveland has more rebounds than Golden State, so they must be winning.
@allahpundit Dems over performing again in real elections. GOP shouldn't kid themselves about what's going to happen in the midterms. Ignore the generic ballot BS.
Don't get why anyone thinks generic ballot means anything when Dems are consistently over performing in actual elections
@nbadraftnet Why JR? At this point, you gotta ride with Korver. JR had some great games in the past, but clearly isn't useful in this series.
@CaseyMattox_ Its a pizza-like casserole
@EsotericCD I get why his audience of liberals likes what he says. I've never understood why any of them find it funny. Yelling your political opinion at a camera isn't that great of a schtick.
@molratty Yes, legally an adult and should own that. But thinking of myself at that age, if my boss was POTUS, I would have had no idea what to do if the boss came on to me. Huge abuse of his power over a subordinate. Does owe her an apology.
@BlameBigGovt @redsteeze @neontaster Its just a clump of chips and wires
@beyondreasdoubt Don't bother responding to Charlie Kirk. He won't get it.
@coachthorpe Arguably the worst GS team of their run. Don't play with the same focus, Green's inconsistent shooting makes them easier to guard and they have no depth. Even a healthy Iggy is still past his prime. More vulnerable than people think.
@wsbarkercfa I was at the meet. Didn't know there was a relation there!  Very impressive performance!
@bball_ref He's got to. inexplicable that he hasn't gone to it more.
@jbouie this is one of the dumbest things I've ever read
@ZachLowe_NBA How about instead of providing further embarrassment to one of your players, you deflect the question and move on? Lue has never been a "coach takes the blame, gives players the credit" guy. One of his biggest failings as a coach.
@coachthorpe I like Kerr, but his inability to keep his team locked in for more than 5 minutes at a time all year has been really bad.
@jeguth That was just awful
@JohnEkdahl In my bottom 3. Just terrible. "Crying scene" was naked pandering. Completely unsatisfying ending. Just bad from start to finish.
@ringer @JoelEmbiid Bryan isn't really going to let his wife take the fall for this, is he? It was obviously him. Why would his wife have known all the minute details of the team? Lying to everyone isn't going to make this better.
Why would anyone be surprised that #Colangelo would do this? Have you seen the shit people tweet when they think they are anonymous? #Sixers #RingerNBA
@michaelgrange @ringer Why would it be surprising that someone would behave recklessly when they think they are anonymous online? Really, why is this so hard to believe? Have you seen the kinds of things people say on Twitter?
@grspur Did you even read the article? Pretty clear what happened and article is careful to say that it isn't definitive proof.
@DavidRutz Yes! His arguments are rarely coherent. He weakens everything conservatives believe in.
@aelfred_D I need to know where Taylor Swift stands on the Roseanne issue. The silence is deafening.
@theCHIVE Rip content straight from Reddit
@ZachLowe_NBA So many moving screens where the screener bear hugs the defenders. I get not calling one where the screener moves a little early. But surely we can call the bear hug a foul.
@coachthorpe I've been watching basketball since I was an infant and I've never heard the term "legal guarding position" before
@NBA_Rumors_News After watching him play, this is totally believable
@awstar11 Seattle, you say? Can you blame them?
Late to the party here, but shouldn't Oladipo and Lillard be swapped on All-NBA teams? #AllNBA #AllNBAFirstTeam
@Neoavatara @NFL I watched almost no NFL last year (not for any particular reason) after watching tons the past decade. I didn't miss it at all. This won't help.
@molratty things get weird when you want something this desperately.
@molratty That entire thread is insane.
@redsteeze he didn't write that...
@ZachLowe_NBA You touched on it by pointing out 6 centers, but aside from Jordan Bell, GS front office has been abysmal over the last 2 years in draft and signing role players.
@MattWelch @jtLOL No amount of evidence will dissuade them from their big government dreams. Look at socialism. Violent failure everywhere, but they think success is always around the corner as long as they wind up in charge.
@allahpundit I don't doubt that's the reason he does it. I'm less sure that he actually told that to an unfriendly member of the media...
@NBA_Rumors_News @NEEFBUCK45 Def should have called a timeout, but that was a terrible pass by Durant. Put Klay in an impossibly difficult situation. Kicking the ball into the stands would have been a better iron than making that pass.
@RealMikeWilbon Maybe their strategy of signing unplayable centers over the last couple years wasn't a good idea...
Really terrible shot selection by GS (especially Curry) in the last 5 minutes. Virtually no ball movement. Really ugly. #WarriorsRockets #GSWvsHOU
@SeanTrende It's pretty obvious how they'd wind up voting
@SI_ChrisBallard Jackson brings absolutely nothing to the table. For someone who played and coached, he rarely (if ever) explains Xs &amp; Os and always seems to be in a bad mood. Burke not only deserves the promotion, fans would benefit tremendously

@ZachLowe_NBA Yes! Now I want a pear
@iowahawkblog Cadillac made great cars before 1970 and briefly around 2010. Lots of great cars will be axed in favor of SUVs. Cadillac doesn't make any of them.

Ok, so I'm not the only one who thinks there are multiple recordings, right? Some say yanny and others say laurel.
@jaketapper Thank you!
@coachthorpe I still don't get it. Why is anyone talking about trading Kyrie and Hayward? We can't already be THIS out of things to talk about, right?
@anthonyjeselnik and most of your material sounds like it was never written
@coachthorpe I... don't understand. Is this a video game thing where you make a crazy team? Are you trying to up the degree of difficulty by replacing great players with mediocre ones? I really don't know what to think.
@RealDylanKnight @ProfDBernstein @benshapiro They weren't fighting with pebbles. Molotov cocktails and even grenades. Hamas leader even said this isn't peaceful and that they are using weapons. Could Israel handle this better? Probably. But don't lie about the situation. Doesn't help your argument
@usatodaynba The Cavs with Kyrie, a fully functional JR Smith and Tristan Thompson have been in this position before. These Cavs have not. It's over.
@DamonLinker you can't possibly be this dumb
@ProfDBernstein @benshapiro someone attacks me and I punch them, breaking their nose. And the outrage is that they didn't hurt me?
@molratty Blaming the media for their failures and claiming the problem is people aren't hearing their wonderful message is like a basketball team down 45 points and throwing up blindfolded shots blaming the refs for their loss.
@drvox Yeah, nobody in white suburbia has access to the internet or CNN/MSNBC or mail or phones. Could it be that they are being reached, but don't like the message?
@MikeySchroeder1 just because he "admits" it doesn't mean he's right. A smart player who is a phenomenal shooter? If anything, he'd fit in better today than 20 years ago.
@ZachLowe_NBA you can see it on LeBron's face - he knows his team doesn't have the horses.
I love the @NBA but I can't stand it when the refs have been told to influence the game. Makes it really hard to watch.
@ByronYork Look, I'm no McCain fan, but a lot of these people are like a basketball team throwing elbows and trash talking in the closing seconds of a game their winning by 25.
@coachthorpe @BenGolliver Thank you. Plenty of super competitive people know how to exercise self control. Jordan got techs, but ever see him have a melt down that truly costs the team?
@coachthorpe Past couple years (Durant excepted) have featured some very underwhelming moves. Sign completely useless (Nick Young) players or too many centers. No depth now. Still great, but no depth.
@JaredDudley619 They could face what Cleveland is heading to: $300mil payroll due to luxury tax. These guys didn't get to be billionaires by losing $100mil per year.

@acoyne @instapundit Its adorable that you think it's not already too late.
@SaysSimonson I tried really hard and made it to episode 3. It was really, really bad.
@allahpundit went to a top public high school 20 years ago. Taught it was a "living document". No other view was even mentioned, let alone taught.
@allahpundit Well, that's exactly what's taught in public school. I'm surprised it took this long.
@RobLowe Truly wonderful news.
@FANalyst1 @hoopshype I think Bosh was better than Worthy (who was excellent). I'd argue Worthy wasnt in the top 10 players in the league at any point in his career. Worthy is in the hall, so I don't see how Bosh doesn't also get in.
@hoopshype Of course. On the merits. Also, if James Worthy is in, Bosh HAS to be in.
@BillSimmons Kawhi and Danny Green for DeRozan, Siakam, Poetl and two 1st rounders?
@BillSimmons Yeah, Bob Ryan somehow found the most baffling Hayward take. I'm dumbfounded. Almost as much as Ryan.
@neontaster Tyson seems to be trying to find how unlikable he can make himself. So far, it's pretty damn unlikable.

@anthonyjeselnik And every day God disappoints us when you don't fall out, too.
@NBA_Rumors_News For the love of God, don't let it be 10:30 ET
@baseballcrank can't we all just agree to ignore Charlie Kirk? He's just so... dumb.
@ZachLowe_NBA He seems to have an even mix of games where he's good, but not controlling the game, games where he dominates and games where he does inexplicably dumb stuff. Never has a totally terrible or totally amazing series. In all, he is great though.
@TMFChrisHill PT Barnum never had to make good on his promises because he eventually he would fold up the tents and move on to the next town or attraction.
So Toronto has hit the end of the line with this group. How do they unload Lowry, DeRozan or Ibaka? sooo much salary to be dumped.
@BillSimmons shit, if it meant unloading those contracts, Toronto would do it for TJ McConnell 's autograph.
@jeguth True. Then just let them die. It's ok if their corpse is in a gutter. Just let them die.
@jeguth Just let Toronto die with dignity
@CurtisHouck He doesn't know a thing about conservatism either. I can't think of a worse ambassador for conservative thought than Charlie Kirk.
@bkerogers Kirk is an idiot. He makes conservatives look terrible. He couldn't reason his way out of a paper bag.
I'll probably finish season 2, but if #Westworld doesn't get better fast, I'll give up on it.
I LOVED season 1, but season 2 has gone completely off the rails. Too many stories, too much time with Dolores and too many extremely stupid characters.
#WestworldSeason2 losing me. "Battle" scene looked super low budget. Dolores is boring and inconsistent (flips back and forth between realization and being a robot).
@RealGM Tucker keeps arguing. Dude, you got him in the face. Just take the foul and move on. Refs aren't going to change their mind.
@allahpundit has Giuliani suffered a head injury? What is going on with his tv appearances?
@rickklein Does Giuliani have a concussion? How else could he wind up this far off script?
@BillSimmons She'll take over for Pop. Thought Messina would, but they gave him permission to talk with other teams. Leaves Hammon as the most likely successor.
@gionobili Its all about expectations and audience. Everyone expects deadspin to be terrible.
@anthonyjeselnik One day he's going to be revered like Nelson Mandela.
@austxsun @ZachLowe_NBA Makes sense. I just figured he was young and athletic enough to still find a way to be at least as useful as Derrick Favors. Instead, he's nearly unplayable right now.
@ZachLowe_NBA What happened to Ibaka? I don't get why he seemed to peak at the age of 23. Its not even a decline in athleticism - it seems like he forgot how to play.
@ZachLowe_NBA Who owns the team? Oh, still Jim Dolan? Then this team has a low ceiling no matter who the coach is.
@neontaster He thinks people didn't like her bc she was fake and its hypocritical to dislike her when she's being "real". No. Fake and self serving IS WHO SHE IS. Nobody likes that, no matter how genuine it is.
@MZHemingway none of this is "the problem". This is the issue of the day for the easily distracted.
@Christunechi6 @RealGM kinda. You said if it was a different player, they would have gotten the call. But technically no, you didn't say that he NEVER gets calls.
@Christunechi6 @RealGM Yeah, because LeBron never gets calls...

@AlderHey just a reminder that you didn't even know what was wrong with a kid, but you killed him anyway. Because you're all monsters.
@iandalinka @Sam_Vecenie He mixes way too many overreactions and wild rule change suggestions into otherwise decent commentary.
@dcsportsbog I like Leonsis, but it's been wild how he has mistaken mediocrity for success with the Wiz. Even the Arenas years, when they were supposedly on verge of being great, never won &gt;45 games.
@molratty "Appropriates". Then how to explain mobility between the classes?
@sarahljaffe have you ever met someone who lived in the Soviet Union?
@MerseyPolice You can't be serious. You threatened anyone who spoke out against the murder of their child. You are a terrible joke.
@NHSEngland your daily reminder that you refused to allow a child to be treated because if he lived it would hurt your credibility. So you murdered a child. To preserve your image. Murderers.
@AlderHey everyone knows you didn't want Alfie to live because it would have hurt your credibility. Truly despicable.
@Sam_Vecenie Mark Jackson and JVG are insufferable. Burke is top 3 in the profession.
@bethanyshondark Prefect example - Mark Levin going from calling out Trump and staying true to his conservative principles and flipping to blasting anyone who opposes Trump.
@AlderHey just a reminder - you said you wouldn't release a dying child to his parents because the parents weren't being nice enough to you while you killed their child. You are murderers.
@NHSEngland you monsters have killed a child on purpose. You ought to be ashamed. You have failed on an astounding level as doctors, administrators and as humans. You are Britain's national shame.
@NHSMillion Just following orders is no excuse
@BillSimmons Oladipo should pull a Gene Hackman and ask the ref to eject him.
@Unsilent Thank God they have such a great GM to help steer them in the right direction.

@EdMorrissey 'hyperbole'???? The UK will not let a child out of their custody until he dies. There's no such thing as overstating the severity of this situation.
Supporting govt decision to kill a child shouldn't make you feel superior, like only you are smart enough to see the big picture. It should make you reflect and be disgusted by that impulse. #SaveAlfieEvans
@theresa_may do you think Alfie should be kept in the UK to die, or (without costing your government a single pound) should his parents be allowed to seek treatment elsewhere?
@dcblerg2015 @JoshHalliday The Brits will find a judge and police to stop them. This is now a totalitarian government and nothing can be allowed to happen that might discredit them.
@varadmehta @BecketAdams glad they're being referred to as writers, rather than journalists. But "activists" is probably even more accurate.

@ZachLowe_NBA Melo's fans (especially in the media) only remember the 1 time out of 5 that shot goes in and the myth of Melo being a superstar somehow persists.
@kpelton It's fine how it is. With the "tech free throw solution", more people would foul and anyone who shoots 60% or less from the line would never shoot again without getting clobbered. NBA has problems, this isn't one of them.

@SeanTrende Pilot was boring and really seemed like any cheap movie made by scyfy channel in last 20 years. Kinda surprised Netflix actually paid money for that.
@dcsportsbog I, for one, am shocked that the Wiz would alternate between looking completely dead and alive. Hasn't consistency been their hallmark? Toronto in 5 or 6.
@ZachLowe_NBA How hard do you work after you've put in your two weeks notice?
@BlameBigGovt But Trump! He's made people not trust the news media!
@coachthorpe If you listen to ESPN and the Ringer, apparently James Harden is the best post defender after shooting 2-18.
@Sam_Vecenie I like CJ a lot. But given his strengths as well as his limitations, he's your 3rd best player on a legit contender.
@MarkDeeksNBA Maybe they are playing this well because he's not out there. Doesn't mean he isn't great - he is amazing. But the fit isn't great. Davis surrounded by shooters is pretty clearly a better team than twin towers playing around each other.

@gionobili He draws multiple fouls per game where there is zero contact. A few weeks ago, a defender put his hands behind his back and stood still. He was called for a foul because Harden ran up to him and flailed.
@gionobili AKA every single game James Harden plays. Protected/bailed out constantly by phantom fouls just because he snaps his head backwards. Impossible to believe refs don't know that's coming by now. Yet, still blow the whistle every damn time.

@gbglax @allahpundit He sure doesn't look like he does.
@allahpundit "I'm only defunding DOJ because I want to be fair to the President" said President Trump.
@NBA_Rumors_News My mistake. Didn't read far enough. I'm going to sit down now...

@CillizzaCNN Not defending DJT or Jr. But you make oppo work sound way more innocent than it is. Looking for liens, etc is background.

@jeguth that said, everything else right now is a distraction. We need to find out exactly what happened with Russia and then proceed accordingly.
@jeguth I do think CNN is a joke. Like most people, they suffer from confirmation bias. Understandable, but unacceptable for news media.
@JonahNRO sigh. This is exhausting.
@seanhannity @allahpundit @DonaldJTrumpJr kinda seems like Trump, his family and his associates are doing a fine job all on their own of destroying his presidency.
@jeguth Good point. Wild times we live in.
@jeguth There lots of hirings, actions, statements and tweets to be outraged about. But that kind of thing doesn't lead to a VP assuming office.
@jeguth I meant it seemed like there was lots of smoke and some fire, but not enough to take down a presidency. I don't think that anymore.
Thought Russia would amount to nothing until today. This time next year Pence might be prez.
@ACLU @lsarsour She fights to implement a system (sharia) that would take rights AWAY from women. This is why people roll their eyes at the mention of ACLU.

@BillSimmons If you need another ball handler for 15 mpg, he'll be fine. If you're relying on him for more, its a vey bad sign.
@hoopshype Not really a free agent, right? Opting out in order to sign 2 year deal w/SA. Playing him 20-25 mpg, he's a GREAT role player.
@RedState It's not bad optics, it's just bad. Nobody elected her. We elected a president with the expectation that he would sit in that chair.
@wojespn Shocker
@spursbuzztap Maybe just to have another ball handler for 10-15 minutes per game. More than that is a bad sign.
@StPatsNYC @kathrynlopez Never realized how close that is to "Let it be" lyrics. Interesting.

@bencasselman @NateSilver538 Ratio stable for 1 yr not a sign of health. Cancer in brain, lungs &amp; liver, doc doesn't say "hasn't spread to the kidneys, so you're fine."
@BillSimmons Kinda had to happen. Based on cap math, this was the price for Hayward. I love Bradley, but it's still a net win for Celts.
@WSJPolitics Time to stop calling this a protest. "Riot" or "violent uprising" is more accurate. Nobody refers to the "LA Protests" after Rodney King...
@CillizzaCNN @RonaldKlain Maybe people don't like policies rather than "the message"? Voters can agree w/"help working class" but not want UBI or single payer.
@thinkinglatina @ATT Could @ATT just say "we want everything but CNN?"
@deanondraft Agree with the theory. Darko/Melo perfect example. But not sure there is any real difference in risk or upside between these three.

@allahpundit if Fox was smart, they'd back up a dump truck of $ to Tapper. Give him lots of ed control over their reporting. Humiliate CNN
@patricktehan @continetti Exactly. He gives plenty of ammo - making stuff up and splitting hairs neutralizes that ammo and makes them, not Trump, look terrible.
@BA_Turner @NBA_Rumors_News @daldridgetnt So Doc really doesn't realize the 2008 Celtics won't be as good 9 years later, huh?
@Acosta I forgot Obama only took Qs from Fox News. Seriously, do you hear yourself? Your name elicits eye rolls from everyone you work with.
@CillizzaCNN Anything about #CNNBlackmail ? Or is that fake news because you don't like it?
@rushlimbaugh time for everyone on right to stop quoting CNN. Pretend they don't exist. Ignoring them is most damaging. #CNNBlackmail
@CillizzaCNN Honest guy like Tapper deserves better than what CNN has become.
@CillizzaCNN Which is not the issue. CNN lost credibility due to bias and sloppiness, not because people don't like the news.
@KFILE Since when were you and your employer sticklers for accuracy?
@Twitter that was clever removing #CNNBlackmail from trending list while it was at its hottest. Really think that would stop the onslaught?
Somehow #CNNBlackmail is no longer trending according to Twitter. I'm sure there's nothing untoward going on there. @allahpundit

@ShamSports Some of that can be chalked up to the toe. But it would hardly be the first time we've seen him go half-speed on D.
@ShamSports Agree with the clueless part. There were a number of plays, especially in transistion, when he never even tried to get back on D
@ShamSports booing for not making shots is absurd. Booing for apathy on D (especially in Game 1 - effort was non existent) would be fine.

@jaketapper duuurrrrrrr.  Do I win?
@kpelton and yes, I worked for 82games in college. Good learning opp for odd series like this. Carlisle should figure this out quick.
@kpelton Barea can be Bob Jackson this series. Haywood is a matchup that hurts Bynum. Brewer can check Kobe better than any1 else on Dal.
@kpelton I don't like Barea, or Haywood, but they can exploit matchups. Status quo will result in Lakers in 5.
@kpelton JET is def better, but matchups change the dynamic. Playing reg starters, Mavs lose. Need to find creative lineups to win this.
@LarryCoon I don't like Barea, but this is a matchup Dallas HAS to take advantage of. Exploiting small matchups could make a bid difference.
@kpelton Brewer needs to be playing a lot more. Unless Mavs want to keep the '04 All-Star team on the floor to get routed.

@sportsguy33 Randolph has evolved into a stud on a good team and Artest won the Citizenship Award. The Mayans predicted this.
@KDonhoops I've been a die-hard Spurs fan since Robinson was drafted, but I think it's safe to count them out now.
@kpelton not just that, but Ariza took 4 steps on the play.
@johnhollinger Westbrook begs to differ...
@johnhollinger T-Wolves were the youngest team at 24.22 years old on average. And it showed.

@thegoldfarb It means it's the government's money - they will decide how much of your $ they will allow you to have.
"Spending in the tax code" assumes that your money is the property of the Govt. Hey jerkoff, that's my money that I ALLOW you to have.
Slow growth of Medicare costs by further studying the issue. Holy Crap On A Stick. Milquetoast at it's finest.
$4trillion deficit reduction over 12 years. So instead of a $1.2 tril annual deficit, we will run a $900bil deficit. Courageous.
@johnhollinger Spurs will start Quinn, Anderson, Butler, Novak and Splitter against LA. Book it.

I don't like this Wisconsin situation at all. Fingers crossed for Prosser.
Kinda shocked this is WI race is so close.
@ronniebaldwin It's been hard to not drink soda.
Spurs need this win
@chadfordinsider Kemba's Big East shooting was awful too. 40% from FG, 30% from 3. He's a homeless man's Iverson, right?
@jadande I'm even petitioning the local Rec leagues to schedule exhibitions. Would have been better than tonight.
@RicBucher Well the night needed at least one highlight.
@MrMichaelLee that game was unwatchable
@johnhollinger Artis should have been in years ago. Certainly long before Mullin and Reggie Miller.
@johnhollinger Time for an NBA HOF and the voters should be the guys who are already in the Hall.
@DraftExpress NCAA has too much invested in having Kemba in the Finals
@WhitlockJason agreed. NCAA bet the farm on Jimmer. Bad. Bad call
@chadfordinsider in what way is Kemba not a homeless man's Iverson?
@nealbrennan Twitter isn't for the unstable and idiots. And Congress... but I repeat myself.
Nobody talks about it, but Kemba was weak in the Big East. Against elite teams, he was awful.
@charliesheen @robpatterson666 @snoopdogg That was just cruel
Blatche was a monster tonight. I'm guessing next game he will disappear.
Today was one of Sports Guy's laziest columns ever. No real analysis. Pretty much was just one graph on 15 teams.
@RicBucher Was at a Lynam practice in '95. Very impressed. Not a good team, but they didn't take stuff from anyone.
@jimmywa11 Your suspension is ridic. The DC area is behind you.
@WhitlockJason Spurs are my team, but LA is killin it right now. I'm terrified
@charliesheen and for the record, there will be the essentials and we are planning impeccably.
@charliesheen Cant get tix to the DC show due to schedule, but planning on having a limo with friends outside if you want to party with us.
@KhloeKardashian Odom representin' !!!!!!
Why on earth is Dallas not doing at least a half court trap.  LA isn't going to just give this game away.
@jadande Makes the John Wall suspension look even more ridic.LA is looking even better than last year.
@MrMichaelLee @thechrispalmer Your daily does of "are you on crack?"
@realchriswebber Calipari had to have something to do with that.
@kpelton Hollinger should track Stevenson and Jordan Crawford with Player Horribly Inefficient Rating.
@kpelton His offense is too weak, and he's been better this year than the last couple - but he's lost a couple steps since his time in DC
@kpelton Kidd is crafty, but isn't close to quick enough. Dallas just doesn't have anyone who is a 1/2 decent matchup for Kobe.
@jadande he's great in the paint for being the second coming of Eddie Gaedel
@kpelton I don't care what they called Shelden Williams in college. Bynum is the Landlord tonight.
@ronniebaldwin Wait, is that Star Trek? Or Battlestar Gallactica?
@kpelton Certainly better than putting Kidd on Kobe.  He would wind up with 82pts if that was the matchup.
@sportsguy33 Rondo may have just saved my fantasy team. Spurs have first 5-game losing streak in 14 years. Good God.

@hotairblog The South is "heavy" on church goers and have higher avg weight. This is a classic correlation does not equal causation.
@sportsguy33 Wait, getting rid of defensive players is a bad idea? Don't tell Golden State!!!!
@sportsguy33 D'Antoni = Sean Penn.
@WhitlockJason I'm guessing they still just used Wikipedia.  I love those guys, but they've been Japan for the tourney.
@baseballcrank @JimPethokoukis Also because he's a corrupt sell-out. That probably figures into the equation.
@FisolaNYDN Wait, a D'Antoni team doesn't have good interior defense? Next you'll say that The Mid-East isn't stable.
@MrMichaelLee I'd bet the farm that he will never ever "get it."

@WhitlockJason Whitlock is whitty on race and sports. Twhitlock races to 144 characters about sports.
@jameseguthrie Whatever CS is doing right now, "winning" is far too small a word to describe it. Perhaps Demigodness?

Winning is too small a word for what Charlie Sheen is doing.
@SpearsNBAYahoo Praying for him. This would be devastating considering his impending free agency.
@charliesheen I'm watching your TLC special right now. If there is a level past winning, you are defining it.
Butler tried to lose this game in the last 5 min. Guards need to figure out what an inbounds is.
Duke and Butler are on a collision course!
@sportsguy33 If you watch more Wiz games, you'd see most high school assistants can out-coach Flip. He lost the locker room in about 10 min

@johnhollinger What is: How Kobe could have played worse.
@johnhollinger I find it hard to believe that anything about the Hawks is deficient.
Colin Cowherd was awful, but his critique of Wall has pushed over the "you suck" line to the "go fishing on Tahoe with Mike Coleone's buddy"
Time for ATL to play up-tempo. They have the horses
And can we all agree the Collins twins r no longer NBA caliber?
Hawks-time to give Jordan C major minutes. Strong enough to guard the 3
@spursbuzztap Absolutely yes. He is an energy guy. Bring him off the bench in that roll and he will start rebounding and shooting better.
Soundgarden was unspeakably bad on Conan. Actually, they were worse than that.

More Serge, more Aldrich, more Sefalosha. Less Krstic, less Harden.  This team has crazy potential.
@jjmaples55 any convo has to be Paul, Deron, Rondo and that's it. Nash's D shortcomings and age make him a distant 4th.
So glad Craig Sager is back with his suits. Clearly he gets dressed in the dark.
Landry Fields was a great pick. Smart, doesn't try to do too much. He will be a big part of this rebuild.
@kpelton Port OT was very disjointed. Ibaka shut down the interior.  When is Aldrich gonna get some run? Can't be worse than Krstic, right?
@jadande big win for OKC. They see Port again soon. If they win that they are def favorites to win division. Need more Ibaka!
@johnhollinger Ibaka is hugely underrated. 2 years from now he will be All-D. When will Aldrich get some run?
night of Quaid vs. Sheen. Sheen all the way. "I don't pay for sex. I pay for the girl to leave,"
@johnhollinger too important a game to sit right now.  Just scale back minutes against Philly.
@kpelton good point. Imagine what it would be like if Miller had a Kemp on his roster.
OKC needs to figure out how to stop a pass to a tall guy down low for a layup.  Aldridge and Camby are killing them.
@allahpundit study hard! It's the only thing that will ever matter!

@JoshuaCooper I can feel it coming in the air tonight... Oh Cooper
@sportsguy33 by delivering a holier-than-thou sermon about the controversy of the day.  In this case, hitting your husband with a bat.
dip and Bacardi 151 is not a good idea
@RapSheet Vegas knows Minny still has Favre throwing to the wrong team, right?
@RapSheet probably because they are about to get Branch, then trade a couple draft picks for Vincent Jackson or Lance Moore
@RapSheet how else will kids get tough? Bullying is what makes this country great. Except in that sad case. That was so terrible.
#WretchedExcess
How has Pete Michael not been drafted/offered a contract? C'mon Popovich/RC, this guy needs to be on the Spurs.
@kwakattaq they heard a false rumor that I was going to be there
@RussertXM_NBC what about the tiger?
@ShamSports I just have good writers supporting me. I agree with how badly pretty much any team wishes they had Duncan.
@ShamSports and if lebron and bosh had both signed there for the vet minimum.  #pointlesshypotheticals
@ronniebaldwin I could really go for some absinthe right now
@ronniebaldwin sounds to me like some wretched excess
This is bat country
@sportsguy33 still getting the hang of twitter?
@JoshuaCooper Are we sure Moss won't be coming to the Heat?
Wizards look truly terrible.  They've gotten slaughtered in the 4th quarter.  I'm predicting 20 wins.
@NYKellen sounds good. I'm flexible.
@NYKellen agreed. Discuss strategies for maintaining sanity in DC...
Hey Chad, your team is wearing teal tonight.
How is Henne gonna bring the fish back?
@sportsguy33 Belichick: "you need me on that wall!"
Not convinced Kelly Rowland knows the words to the song.  Truly an awful performance.
@sportsguy33 Henne looks sharp.... d'oh!
@NYKellen three options: booze, lobotomy or death.  Everything else leads to insanity.
MNF. I could use a big game from Moss.
@RealGMwiretap if NFL locks out, NBA won't.  Too much to gain for NBA to not have that audience.
@jadande answer: because of advance stats. I'm a Spurs fan, so I hope Cuban continues to follow the Dan Snyder strategy.
@jadande one of the dumbest articles ever. How did Houston win 42 games last year? Why aren't the Warriors winning with a scorer like Ellis?
Game. Blouses.  I mean, Giants.
@sportsguy33 Did he fumble anything during halftime?  Or find an even younger woman?
Who is worse today: Cutler or Manning?  Answer: Derek Anderson.
This is the worst game I've watched this season.
This is a battle to see who can score less.
Raise your hand if you are shocked a CBS reporter is on drugs.
@JayCost F.A.H is my homeboy.
@JayCost Understandably so. It's not like U of Chicago had a prominent econ program. /sarcasm
@JayCost I wrote a college thesis based on Road to Serfdom.  Not totally sure my professor had heard of the book.
Dungy thinks Indy didn't win because they didn't score enough.  Ummm, they put up 28, coach.  You're an idiot.
Kevin Kolb throws like a quadraplegic.
Will the Skins give this game away?
The jump pass looked stupid when Tebow did it and it looked even worse a few minutes ago.
@sportsguy33 Hey now, they only have 8 small forwards.  They did need a few PGs a C. PHX:Sf's what the Layden Knicks were to undersized PFs
@sportsguy33 there is a reason there is a "Fire Joe Morgan" website.
@RealGMwiretap No chance. Simply a leak by the owners to help their negotiations. Both sides need to agree to altering a contract.
@sportsguy33 He and Favre have been chillin with the same HGH dealer.  Helps when only a muscle biopsy can bust you.
So long Angelina.  Don't let the guido door...
Snooki better regulate

@kwakattaq well, it's a hybrid of the herp and the hiv.
@kwakattaq Although most people would have come out of that time with an MBA, Ph.D and and M.D., but still.  Good times.
@kwakattaq I'm glad you were around for my decade of college.
@kwakattaq Dear Kwak, I'm glad only one of my three junior years counted, PMG.
@seanhackbarth Please, we all know He is a Cowboys fan.

Good game brewing in Chitown.

@jtLOL Waterboarding replaced with Olympic sized swimming pool, but one filter is only operating at 80%!!!! Scandal!!!!!!
@sportsguy33 after running that slow, there's no way he would have been asked to take a breathalyzer.

@ronniebaldwin so jealous
@ronniebaldwin I'll agree with that.  Good start to The Office though.
Enough with the manning crap already. Talk about beating a dead horse
Favre is reverting back to 2005.   Not good if you like the Vikings.
What happens if Batch is injured? Hines Ward? Troy Palamalu?
@sportsguy33 How is he not on Washington?  They are assembling a decent 2004 team- shouldn't he be McNabb's backup?
Dez Bryant Dez Bryant Dez Bryant
@ronniebaldwin Chili dog for breakfast on a Sunday. If you spend the day watching football or working on your car, that will be a great day.

@chucktodd that could not possibly be more insulting.
@chucktodd doesn't the govt shamelessly push mortgages on people  who are looking to buy as an investment?
@ronniebaldwin for dessert, go to Las Paletas - gourmet Popsicles on 12th next to Sevier Park
@RogueAles Damn! I need to stay on top of this.  Chocolate Stout and Morimoto and hard to find around these parts.
@RogueAles will you please do an event in DC soon?  I'm begging you!
@ronniebaldwin plus he would choke his enemies.  What about Ron Artest?  Talk about a wild card...

@ronniebaldwin she should always be trending
@dgranger33 http://twitpic.com/2oei42 - Thank you so much for playing so hard and making us all proud!  USA!  USA!
@kwakattaq I would have gone for Manigault too.

Can we kick Billups off the team after the game? He's been brutal.
@chucktodd they were good, but let's not go nuts. There is only one Byrne.

@jessicalevai what's wrong with a little cheating and irresponsibility?
Congrats to Van and Meghan!
Long distance drinking games to the show Archer are amazing.  Note it!!!!
@jameseguthrie this is the start if the college football season!
@seanhackbarth RIP. A rare actor in this age who was successful and conservative. Hard not to love him
@sportsguy33 that should have been a thrilla in Florida. Thanks MTV
@NYKellen that's the coolest thing ever
@sportsguy33 I did that intentionally in college to buy myself more time to write. "Sorry prof, I forgot to attach the doc 5 hours ago!"
Not impressed at all by Coach K. USA consistently looks disjointed and his rotations make zero sense. Is it too late to get Gregg Popovich?
@JoshuaCooper I like the Sid Finch reference.  One of the all-time great hoaxes.
I want another Roddick meltdown.  That was hilarious.
Less Billups, more Westbrook and Curry.  Less Chandler, more Love.  Coach K, are you even playing attention to your rotation?
USA! USA! USA!
Need more Kevin Love!
@TrueHoop It's crazy that Chandler is playing this much.  He's horrendous.
Way too much 1-on-1 happening right now.
@ronniebaldwin but it has alcohol in it, right? 'nuff said
@ronniebaldwin JEALOUS!!!!!!!
@jameseguthrie Fallon is just the worst kind of person
Tea Party!!!!!
@sportsguy33 and Odom/Kardasian will be bigger. And don't forget about the Shelden Williams/Candace Parker potential.
@RealGMwiretap because anyone who loves signing any veteran at the expense of building a good young team should get 5 year deal.
W's book could seriously not come at a worse time. Way to help the Dems. I think the W stands for "What could I do to help liberals?"
@jimmywa11 As a DC resident and Wiz fan, I'm always happy when you tweet about working out. Shows real commitment and professionalism.
@ronniebaldwin You're reading a ton... wretched excess!
30 for 30 on MJ is fantastic.  Maybe spends a little too much on irrelevant stuff (interview with his realtor - really?). Still good.
When Kevin Love is in, nobody else can get a rebound. An absolute monster. He better start playing more than Tyson Chandler.
Horrible 4th Q for Team USA. disjointed offense in the half court. Kevin Love needs to play more.
I couldn't be more impressed with Kevin Durant. True superstar.
@sportsguy33 hold up- it's not a good idea to bid against yourself to lock up an aging center long term?
@sportsgal33 What year did ET come out?
@KDthunderup yes. Sure you're a superstar, but that don't mean you shouldn't be able to eat in peace.
@pennjillette helium? I can't wait to see it
Forgot how fun college towns can be.
@ronniebaldwin otphj
@RealGMcom because forwards who don't rebound, play D, pass, or keep a team looks great
Advice on parties in Ohio?

@johnhollinger not a good idea to swap a dynamic young PG for average SF? If only CP3 could hold out NFL style until NO does something real
@ronniebaldwin you are in rough shape

@ronniebaldwin do you have bail money?
@ronniebaldwin he better not
McDonalds breakfast remains the best invention of all time.

@chucktodd the sea monster known as Al Davis?
@kwakattaq no, you had it right the first time
@kwakattaq that makes more sense
@kwakattaq rumor? I've seen it confirmed by 5 different news sources
@clubtrillion I saw a tril shirt in the DC metro on my way to Nationals game. You still have time. 14:59 is an eternity in sports.
@kwakattaq you better text me updates today. I'm sadly beerless today.
@kwakattaq so jealous. I expect constant updates
Jersey Shore. I'm ashamed I'm watching, but I can't help myself.
@johnhollinger at least they have the firepower to just outscore their opponents... Right?
@kwakattaq be-er. B-E-E-R.
First time playing ball in a long time and so out of shape. Now I know how Shaq feels every training camp.
@kwakattaq better than knifed. And depending on looks, maybe better than spooned.
Kahn trades Hollins, Sessions and a 2nd rnd pick for nothing in order to clear playing time for Ridnour and Darko. Kaaaaaaaaaaahn!
@RealGMwiretap tough to build around anyone when you hand out huge contracts to Turkoglu and Calderon. Colangelo is an idiot.
@clubtrillion what about the late Paul Newman and Robert Redford?
@pennjillette Dustin Hoffman.  Oh wait. Brain men? Then nevermind.
@kwakattaq brasts
Just lost half a tree to a storm. Good times.
@sportsguy33 @an_dre_a12 and as a DC native I was overshadowed by every prez. So I want out.
@SimaBaby21 incompitence? Re-think your statement.
@KDthunderup wide open 3. Let 'er riiiipppp
@RealGMwiretap 2nd tweet on this today. They must really really want him gone if they are pushing this that hard.

Guy doin karaoke at Austin grill is Killin' it with a capital K
@sportsguy33 super true, super awesome.
@sportsguy33 @jadande have you ever watched Magic coach while playing and gambling? That scenario always involves MJ and Oak. It's the best.
@sportsguy33 there us nothing KD could do that would make me like him more than I already do.
@sportsguy33 @STEIN_LINE_HQ no way Kahn is that high. You must be getting that intel from his agent.
@sportsguy33 Kahn will assemble either the all-point guard, or all-small forward lineup. Kaaaaaaaaahhhhhnnnn!!!!!!!
@sportsguy33 as long as you have a point forward and a defensive-minded 6'10" guy, what do you need besides small forwards?
@kwakattaq that boy ain't right
@RicBucher given their cap situation, MIA really needed to get a player back. Anyone, just a warm body who can play.
@sportsguy33 I played pickup against #2 ranked womens NCAA team. 5'8", never even played high school and I overwhelmed them. Game. Blouses.
Why is it ok for redskins to want out of DC, but LeBron is a villain for leaving the Daniel Snyder of basketball?
RIP Mel Turpin. Poor guy. Pray for his family.
@RicBucher first heat at cavs game may produce a riot.
@RicBucher and watch when brad miller, Josh Boone, Haslem, Rasual Butler, Ridnour and Roger Mason all sign for min.
Heat trade Beasley for picks. They need to buy at least 1 high 1st rounder every year to build and keep a dynasty going.
Fill the roster: brad miller, farmar/ridnour, Josh Boone, rasual butler, haslem, roger mason. That's enough for 65 wins and a ring, right?
@jacko2323 yes but what of the Arenas, Butler, Jamison Big 3?
@sportsguy33 he's staying. 100% sure.
@chucktodd @sportsguy33 @Mattie96 LeBronuhka.
Currently broken at the rio target- both up and down escalators AND the elevators. Step it up guys.
Theory from ari: lebron stays, espn made up Miami rumor to generate suspense. I think it's plausible.
@sportsguy33 @sportsnation how much will you have to pay him?
@sportsguy33 r Jefferson is announcing his decision by snail mail.  Will yours at least be announced over skype?
@ronniebaldwin a fat kid wants cake, but the kid who NEEDS cake lives in Cleveland.
@jadande @IraHeatBeat and Richard Jefferson signs on a web cam.
@sportsgal33 so what convinced you to get married?
@MGaske @sportsguy33 @chadfordinsider because you cannever have enough "toro" defenders
@sportsguy33 @chadfordinsider or as Amare said today: if he joins NY, so will Carmelo and Tony Parker.
@sportsguy33 amare, Gil, and boozer/Richard Jefferson. Quite the title nucleus.
@kwakattaq I'm drinking beer while filling out my enlistment papers in someone else's house.
@kwakattaq you aren't quartering soldiers in your house? Or was there a court order demaning you do so?
@sportsguy33 The people of Arlington,TX are understandably huge fans of Walter Johnson.
@seanhackbarth it's an easy drive and usually cheaper than flying into des moines.
@kwakattaq no you rock.
@RicBucher guys like him have it all planned out.
@kwakattaq their love was big... But the house was too small....
@NYKellen Korean DMZ? Clearly borders can't be secured.
@sportsguy33 do you know 100% that this doesn't exist?
@johnhollinger  As a Spurs fan I'm confused and overjoyed. This is like Christmas on steroids, after it's taken a bunch of hgh.
@HOOPSWORLD pray sterling loses the team in a housing discrimination lawsuit.
@TrueHoop with max guys wanting larger contracts their team can give in S&T, teams that cleaned house have nothing to offer(see:NY)
@RicBucher NBA can be suspicious, while NFL and MLB are bad and FIFA is horrendous. There is no perfect system.
@kwakattaq there will never be another. As for the next Adam Morrison... Grevis Vazquez c'mon down!
Only takes 1 goal, guys
USA! USA! USA!

Need a big 4th from Rondo. Did momentum just shift with Odom tip in?
Peeps at Cleveland Park Bar and Grill are going crazy for Boston. It's the place to be.
@HOOPSWORLD good trade for SAC. not sure how it helps Philly.
Dalembert to Kings. Good trade. Now draft Cousins and frontcourt is set.
This officiating is beyond terrible. Are they blowing the whistle randomly without watching the game?
RIP John Wooden. Greatest coach of all time.
@african_minute and how are you livin?
If dancing like an idiot was a contagious disease, there would be an epidemic in Orlando.

@seanhackbarth can Jobs end his Adobe feud? This is like loving both parents but being forced to choose. My choice is adobe.
@sportsguy33 why? Is something on the line tonight?

Driving down 95 from DC and approaching Savanah. Total time with 3G coverage: 5 min. AT&T absolutely kills the iPhone.

@sportsguy33 C's offering Rondo? It's not like defense, passing, rebounding and slashing to the hoop is really important, right?
@Dinalisafraioli when you get back, we are totally having skittles and vodka
you know, not doing so bad right now.
Intense headache. Getting out of here soon.
Safeway salads are not so great. This was entirely predictable.
I'm not usually a Shepard Smith guy, but he's covering Iran and is absolutely on fire.
Nothing is better than people fighting for freedom.  http://tinyurl.com/nfpevu
"Also, I hear that skittles goes great in expensive vodka"
Amare to the Wiz? I mean, it only took two years, but maybe Grunfeld is realizing that the Medium-Sized Three aren't a contender.
you know what's better than deal with a fender bender (besides everything) ? www.textsfromlastnight.com
Now we can move on to the worst NBA draft ever. I just can't wait to see who goes first between James Harden, Hasheem Thabeet and Who Cares?
busted car. busted boat motor. Yeah, things are going great.
I'm guessing LA by 8. Only hope for Magic is if Howard can get it going, while also limiting the damage Pau can do.
Absurdly busy today. At least there is basketball tonite. Speaking of which: Howard isn't exactly a lock-down defender, is he?
Very long, but very good day. I wish I had the energy to write something funnier than that
I like making phone calls about as much as Kobe likes passing the ball in crunch time
So as long as Orlando can keep shooting 60%, they've got a chance
@african_minute when are you coming home?
Work, healthcare forum, then who knows
@johnhollinger no, the contract is still ridiculous - they were bidding against themselves. And they could add another piece if not for that
@african_minute first you should come back to Rockville. Then come to Tapp this weekend. Figure out your next step there...
After SG's podcast, I want to be Jerry West when I grow up
Interesting debate on the radio today. Who is better right now, Howard or Gasol? I'm really not sure.
Done for the day. Run? I think so.
Also, Good Lamar Odom is basically Danny Manning. I'm surprised more people haven't pointed that out.
Is there a reason why Hedo dribbles for 18 seconds on every possession? I mean, who would want something stupid like ball movement?
Tappahannock. Finally.
@jacko2323 "Expect Great" there should be a ... after that. It would make the slogan much better.
Magic in 7
Lakers-Magic. Should be a good series. Also, how is it possible that Shaq hasn't cracked the 10,000 interview mark this week?
Nats game tonight. Rain out? Who can really say?
Quite an evening
Got a decent amount done today. Now on to sushi and a friend!
Working fast, trying to make up for lost time
I was so late for work this morning. At least I get to finish the day with sushi.
I'm doing my best Tim Thomas impression this week.
LeBron is 24 and it showed the other night. Now, on to more important things, like will Kobe bring the rain after mailing in Game 6 in '08?
Now that TNT is done with the playoffs, what will Craig Sager do? Does he dress like a regular person in the off season?
Just had my first cigar since being back in MD. The return is nearly complete.
Ben Wallace is going to leave $14mil on the table rather than ride pine and live the life of an NBA player? Sure he is, sure...
First day back in the Springfield office. Nice change of pace from being cramped in an apartment in Iowa.
Good, rowdy weekend. Back to work. F.
Basketball. This is going to be horrendous.
Maryland, going to see UB, then who knows? Just so glad to be home.
Let me be more specific: Cuban is always asking "why", "why not", "what is happening", "what isn't" and "could it be different"
More people need to listen to Mark Cuban. Asks lots of great questions even if he doesn't know the answer. There's tremendous value in that
Finally back in MD. Finally.
Finally hittin' the road. Maryland, here I come
@sportsguy33 yeah, but Stern smiled condescendingly and told us that they have the best refs in the world. Doesn't that mean it's true?
Just finished tour memos. Now shower, driving to MD. I already miss Iowa in the same way one misses having a migraine
probably hitting the road soon.
just watched Zombie Strippers. If you think that sounds ridiculous you'd be wrong. There isn't yet a word to describe it.
TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
because memos sound like a blast after a night of drinking
wearing a snuggie. You're jealous.
Indy. Clubbing with Jamaal Tinsley. Jail.
With the Kobe hatred in PHX, the Suns have to make a play for Dahntay Jones this summer, right?
so-so sushi. oh well. still better than fast food
Rush brings up a good point. If the GOP should be controlled by moderates, what are the principles that it stands for?
@sportsguy33 Every great team needs a crazy guy. There always needs to be at least a chance that someone is getting decked.
Indiana. A little work, a little fishing. Very little driving today
Illinois. $75 ticket, but at least I'm out of Iowa
Awake and trying to get myself moving so I can leave Iowa
@jeskeets Jenny, lost her favorite penny... Tread Water is the best song on that album
@RicBucher David Robinson, Hakeem, young Dikembe...
@RicBucher yeah, make some more excuses. The refs suck. David Stern is killing the league and the players are just as athletic as in 1989
@sportsguy33 : couldn't agree more. humans have not evolved a ton in the last 20 years. But the refs have aged. Time for some fresh blood.
Ric Bucher may be the worst Tweeter ever. Breaking up thoughts and excusing crappy officiating. He is to the NBA what MSNBC is to Obama.
LeBron is still in the 40+ PER club, but does that mean his teammates are in the -40 PER club? And is Mike Brown in the -4000000 club?
Will the Ohio National Guard step in and force Mike Brown to go small? No way Z should play 30 minutes again or Varejao 20 min.
I know SG is trying to rile up LA fans and I'm a Spurs fan, but come one. Oberto and Parker are the choice here @sportsguy33
craig sager has really outdone himself tonight
and the over/under for the number of times LeBron's shot is replayed. 74068 and I'm taking the over.
Over/under for minutes for Sideshow Bob tonight? I'm going with 20 and taking "under".
I kind of wish LeBron was my Dad. Don't tell my real Dad I said that.
Packing
Trying to get outta dodge, by which I mean, Iowa
3 hour layover in Denver. Then on to Amarillo and Wichita Falls, TX.
Traveling. Texas and Oklahoma. Awesome.
Chicken burgers are fantastic. Especially wrapped in bacon. That's how pork is supposed to be used.
Olympia Snowe wants a bigger tent. Sorry, there isn't a tent big enough for a moron like her.
Workin' and wondering how much more inept the Iowa Legislature could possibly be.
Go Spurs! Looked back on track tonight. Hopefully we can keep it rollin.
Memorizing and gettin' ready to tea party!
Memorizing, memorizing, memorizing
Memorizing a script and planning the Des Moines Tax Day Tea Party
