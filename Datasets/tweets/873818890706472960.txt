@mattyglesias At a budget hearing, He can not nor should he answer questions about anything w/ areas where he has recused himself. COMMON SENSE to most.
Good call, it is most important &amp; appropriate for Sessions to appear at the Senate Intel rather on the same date June 13 https://t.co/B50q4QOGAV
@FaceTheNation @SenSchumer @POTUS This was harmful to America, demoralizing, embarrassing, and a sick FAKE STORY he STRONGLY helped spread!
@FaceTheNation @SenSchumer Will u ask him why he chose to carry on this lie that @POTUS was under Federal Criminal investigation when HE KNEW CLEARLY that he was not!
@benandjerrys Obama entered Paris Agreement illegally w/out congress approval &amp; against our U.S. Constitutional Laws - For any that are STILL confused
@benandjerrys These States are breaking Federal Law and wasting BILLIONS of US citizens Tax dollars. Obama signed on illegally to begin with!

@RoKhanna @PramilaJayapal @MarkPocan Is there a Democrat Party at all anymore?	Many would have loved to go but @SenSanders stole their money and gave it to @HillaryClinton https://t.co/2Mevrmpb7N

@NitaLowey His parents should be deported and to keep their family together he should B allowed 2 join them. Legal migrants are tired of paying his way

@JasonKander Your opinion does NOT resonate w/most of America, just in your bubble.	We have watched James Comey cover-up for Clinton cartel now 25 yrs!
@CoryBooker I have faith that with the support of great leaders rather than obstruction Trump administration can make an amazing difference in our lives

@repjoecrowley You are SPREADING false information...	This entire "women make less than men" argument is a lie when you use actual data. Women are offended
@edworkforcedems @CongressmanRaja There is no such thing as "TrumpCare" this in and of itself makes the entire article FAKE news. Please take the same advice given to Warren: https://t.co/9Uw7KF5Oxz
