@maryugogirl @TheDemocrats @CNN Trump does. He's not out to make Washington happy, but is for the average American family

@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump I along with 63% of vets find taking a knee during the Anthem offensive to vets...literally.
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump You're niave to think this isn't disrespecting vets. Any effort to state spin this differently is just as offensive. End of story!
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump ...they can kneel before the anthem, as Dallas Cowboys did, and stand for respect to our country, military, and flag.
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump Yoy can "spin this" anyway you wont to. Vut its disrespectful to vets who see it. If they dont wont to divide, then stand up, STFU! ...
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump It's the epitome of disrespect &amp; offensive for vets who believe those who died and coffins were draped with the flag! You are wrong. Poll it
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump ...then before anthem starts stand on your feet, face the flag, &amp; STFU. The anthem is all about flag, &amp; country.
@SAS0620 @juliusagusta @realDonaldTrump Dont be naive...its a slap in the face of every vet! Its disrespect 1st to all vets. You dont want to offend vets, kneel before anthem...

@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 I asked a simple question...its a simple answer or fuck off. Your choice.
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 Btw dumbass, unless you are an America Indian, we are all descendents of immigrants. The difference is legal immigrants  vs illegal aliens.
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 I've asked a question to you...answer we continue. If you don't, then fuck off!
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 And so you think an immigration control &amp; reform based on a merit based system is bad?
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 Didn't say that they were but you seem to have an opinion about #DACA so let's here it then.
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 Stop with the "you people" comments...its rude and beneath most civil people. But if you want to get rude &amp; be a smart ass...game on!
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 So you was born here as an "anchor baby"?
@acholla527 @NotElizabeth88 I have been civil to you but do not misstake that for "ignorant or uneducated". Bc if you think DACA gave you American Citizenship ur stupid

@CNNPolitics And is doing one hell of a good job doing so. Even the Clinton News Network can agree with that!
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis No problem. Do you believe our government should make America first and make the prospering of Americans first?
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis No one would have enough experience? Are you serious? Any person who runs a business can deal with other countries other entities
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis And I don't have a problem with capitalist form of economics verses that of uh socialist
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Sure. He made Millions off the backs of hard-working Americans. He sees what the loss of 60,000 manufacturing plants over the last decade
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Look at what that cost us w/ Hillary selling a third of our uranium to Russia and then benefiting 150 million dollars directly to her pocket

@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Americans are not a demographic over another demographic if you are here as an American do you believe in America first?
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis Fair question which I do agree. Here's a question for you does black lives matter?
@maryugogirl @JennaSeeks You know that
@maryugogirl @JennaSeeks I enjoy to debate
@TheBenji3 @FoxNews @RepDeSantis You realize as it is we have demagogues in power. Power corrupts people to only want more power. Term limits would be good

@Citizen_USA1 @PreetBharara Liberals think that Manning's pardon shines like a diamond in a goat's ass!
@Citizen_USA1 @PreetBharara What is your thoughts on Obama pardon of private Manning? Who endangered American lives and committed treason at high level?
@GaryWoronchak Be careful with your tone, you cannot change the rule of law on a whim as Obama did with his doj related to this case. That's tyranny!
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics What is truly treasonous is Obama giving a pardon to Manning who endanger American lives all around the world. Where was your outrage?
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics So let's not be so quick to throw hero &amp; Patriot Joe under the bus, you must look at the back story as well.
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics You are exactly right, POTUS who had liberal judge write court order to Sheriff's not to enforce law is broaching tyranny
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics Is unconstitutional. What is key for our democracy is the belief that our constitution is worth standing up for, just as our flag is!
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics So is the enforcement of laws that already exist against illegal immigration in the US. Any effort to provide Sanctuary for illegals
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics Do you not understand what the word tyranny means?
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics Because Obama and DOJ ask for it to be. That is corruption. So what about that oath did you ever take it?
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics Enforcing immigration laws that are already on the books, on the federal level, does not need to be rewritten by a liberal judge...
@OscarRa08476734 @CNNPolitics Obama pardoned dope dealers who preyed on kids and violent felons w/ deadly weapons. @realDonaldTrump pardons a lawman, MSM goes berserk.
@RebelXBlack @CNNPolitics I really think that liberals do not believe in the First Amendment. They shut down conservative free speech at every opportunity they have
@me_donnamarie @CNNPolitics Any judge who writes a court order to a sheriff telling them not to enforce the law, should lose the right to be called a Judge!
@GaryWoronchak @CNNPolitics A liberal judge making a court order to Sheriff's to not enforce the law is treasonous. Did you ever take the oath to defend our country?
@CNNPolitics And Obama's pardon of Manning, who endangered Americans lives would be considered what? ... a diamond shining in a goat's ass?
@JennaSeeks Nor should we. we have already went through our industrialization and should reap the rewards for being the greatest country on Earth
@JennaSeeks Is it better to make America First and look out for Americans first? Or is that wrong?

@JennaSeeks Inflation? Reform the tax code attract 60,000 new manufacturing plants back into the USA that's what's needed. Guess you're not an American?
@JennaSeeks My insurance went up from 150 a month for family of 5 to $1,400 a month that is not making America great...
@JennaSeeks Socialism is what you seek you have to look no further than Venezuela to see what happens when you run out of other people's money...
@JennaSeeks The largest expansion of welfare in our country's history is not a sign of America already being great...
@JennaSeeks The loss of 60,000 American manufacturing plants moving to Mexico or overseas does not make America great...
@JennaSeeks So you support Disney laying off IT workers and bringing in cheap foreign labor to replace them. That does not make America great....
@JennaSeeks @maryugogirl Why do you hate Americans needs being first? Why do you hate making America great again? Why do you hate efforts 2 reform the failed ACA?
The largest expansion of welfare in America's history is not a success story. Leadership a Democrat. He did not fight for Americans first

@SAS0620 Seems like those shouting "pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon", were doing so while holding a banner, that said Black Lives Matters.
@SAS0620 I.e. I disliked Obama from even before he was elected but I never rioted or committed illegal crimes to express that. I voted.
@SAS0620 All hate is unacceptable...especially hate that incites violence towards another. There are many on the fringes as a direct result of Obama
@SAS0620 What one crazy person does in the name of protest does not mean that all are guilty of the same offense
@SAS0620 Does ANTIFA have the right to assemble in protest?
@SAS0620 Do they not have the right to assemble in protest?
@CNNPolitics Why is this news?
@RobbyMook Yep, my kids saw @BarackObama 's first term as the apology tour, the second term was trying to put men into the girls bathrooms
We must be clear @SpeakerRyan . We the people want what was promised or you and your swamp creatures will be voted out in 18.
@SpeakerRyan And how long have you been in politics? And have done nothing about this!
@Patrick29625736 @jmgjackie @CNNPolitics Hey dip s***, BLM has been killing cops for years.
@CNNPolitics Trump could be Jesus Christ and @CNN would complain about his hair!
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump Your stereotyping us from the S. Is showing your urban bias &amp; prejudices...further devision of the country. Thank God for @realDonaldTrump
@maryugogirl Just like @BarackObama barawasted his presidency, just like @SpeakerRyan wasted his time in politics!
@FiIibuster @realDonaldTrump Obama spent his 1st term on an apology tour &amp; his second term trying to get men in the girls bathrooms! What a waste of a presidency!
BLM &amp; other hate groups out against the men &amp; women in blue in NYC. https://t.co/8L5qrdyxh5
@SAS0620 time to hete from another patriot https://t.co/ttV3AQnyr2
@maryugogirl Likely taised ad democrats or independents

@kaoticxpunk @escriv76 @abc13houston A car in the hands of someone demented could be considered a weapon.
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump You are such an oxygen Thief! What part of denouncing ALL violence do you not get? Frankly surprised your profile pic is not a diaper pin
@abc13houston I am upset, Trump did not include or say "black lives matter or antifa" by name.
@jim_rockford1 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding, the Clinton News network is a total obstructionist towards Donald Trump
@JasonOverstreet @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Lest you forget, it was your candidate that was kissing the grand wizard of KKK on his lips.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Including one of the most racist groups in America: black lives matters
@jacalynzz @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump #Liberalism is the rotting corpse of American politics. Its acolytes are reduced to pussy hats, thug masks and hoodies. Simply Ignore them.

@SandyHaf @CNNPolitics Be truthful Trump could go and shoot the driver right between the eyes and you would still find a problem with Trump as a president
@JedAlexander102 @CNNPolitics If my memory serves me right it was your candidate kissing the grand wizard of KKK
@glamelegance @CNNPolitics Either your ignorance or stupidity is showing. Trump just gave a remarkable speech denouncing neonazis KKK and other hate groups
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump We will take this up later have to go and earn a dollar
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You easily confuse the word racist with opinion
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You think that only racist people exist if they're white and skin color?
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You have difficulty denouncing violence by any group. That is the bottom line. Want change...vote for it, on every level. #MAGA
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Come on Steve police brutality towards blacks is 1/100 of what black violence towards blacks is. You know this is the truth.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump BLM is a hate group that needs to be denounced because they support they endorse violence... even if their Charter says otherwise.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Black lives matter is a hate and racist group that needs to be denounced. Even if you disagree with me.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump The Dallas assinations of 4 cops, who were protecting the rights of BLM to assemble and march were not.  I'm tiring of this conversation.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump And those were only the white ones
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump 241 cops were assassinated last year. I find that very compelling.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Surely you watch TV? " pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon" give you one guess who is the author of that
@SAS0620 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump I'm saying a group that cites violence that leads to the killing of police needs to be denounced. Surely you do not disagree?
@SAS0620 @BarackObama BLM is just as bad as the KKK, NEO-NAZIS, Alt-right, ANTIFA...I stand with @realDonaldTrump denouncing them ALL.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama Any time a hate group cites violence as a solution (killing cops as just 1 example), it needs to be denounced. 		WE ARE ALL AMERICANS
@SAS0620 any time hate groups cite violence against another, including authority, they need to be labeled as such. https://t.co/Fzz6zcogka
@SAS0620  Sheriff links "Black Lives Matter" movement to slain deputy https://t.co/kAkmQKLEXu via @cbsnews
@SAS0620 @BarackObama It common knowledge Obama sided with BLM,  cop killers they murdered in cold blood.  Of course MSMmaking them out to be loving and peaceful.
@SAS0620 Lol...ok agreed. And I need more coffee as well. Later?
@SAS0620 @BarackObama It's a hate group one of which I denounce, they kill cops, again I denounce it. I denounce ALL racist hate groups. Obama legitimized them.

@SAS0620 @BarackObama Actually, I agree with this. So denounce the racist hate groups, and don't defend one over another... ALL have no place in America.
@SAS0620 @BarackObama Lol...your rant, obviously caring abt running down your president, while defending racist hate group, Black Lives Matters.
@SAS0620  your silence is deafening! @BarackObama legitimized Black Lives Matters racist hate group, police killers in Dallas. https://t.co/zdXSwD3i4L
@maryugogirl I stand with @realDonaldTrump against ALL political violence and ALL forms of bigotry and assumed 'superiority.'		WE ARE ALL AMERICANS.

@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump Wrong. Trump denounced violence in Ferguson during that cities civil unrest by Black Lives Matters and others. https://t.co/N8S7ldV2ex
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump Capitals or not...my reference is intended for those who promote their racist, bigotry in the name of any race. That's exactly Trumps belief
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump Let me see to understand you, do you you believe that only black lives matters and not any other life?
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump Ambiguity? What part of his speech denouncing violence hatred and bigotry from all sides is difficult for you to understand?
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump What the heck are you talking about?! Trump was the very first one to denounce extremist Islamic jihadist the name of Islam.
@SAS0620 Trying to erase our history does not erase our history
@SAS0620 @realDonaldTrump was right to denounce violence on "many sides", as this has been going on for too long.
