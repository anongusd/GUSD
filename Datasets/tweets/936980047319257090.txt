@kaykaysadams @Eamon0303 @WhiteHouse What‚Äôs your evidence?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump bullshit. Manufactured tweet because you have to give the holiday a nod. This White House doesn‚Äôt even know who Frederick Douglass was, let alone begin to comprehend ‚Äúthe dream‚Äù.  More like ‚Äúthe final solution‚Äù. #FOH

@thehill Taking notes so I can show my children what real leadership looks like. Thanks @realDonaldTrump , always looking out for #1 (your ego).
@KrangTNelson true story. my sister lives in Hawaii with her family and has become a prepper in recent months...
@sebtown @nytimes or the disabled.
@kfrydl @emptywheel @realDonaldTrump has done what every great leader of a nation would do though, and ignored the threat.
@realDonaldTrump No comment on Hawaii? They're winning #MAGA style.
@TomiLahren what professional uses "blah, blah, blah" during a broadcast? you're a fucking embarrassment. with bad makeup.
@nytimes same with child welfare workers. 	people who serve others earn low-wages bc people don't really matter in this country.
Yes, like peaceful protests @TomiLahren  Since you really haven't been able to grasp what was happening during football season. https://t.co/fBWeSlZ0ZR
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump not everyone is for sale. and my bank account isn't growing, and even if I see some relief from this tax plan, still not a supporter. Can't be bought with Shitmouth Trump money.
@realDonaldTrump by "we", are you referring to you and your ego? I loved reading #FusionGPSTranscript #MAGA #ImpeachTrumpNow

@RogueSNRadvisor Saw that. The only way to have his attention is to hurt his ego.
@realDonaldTrump Communities arundel the country are crumbling due to rising costs of living,  stagnant wages, underfunded education, and a bigPHARMA induced opioid epidemic. Sorry those issues don't feed your ego like #fakenews. I want to see a real leader with solutions, not political barbs.
@PressSec I want to hear from the constitutients, not the federal government. If things are so amazing and great, why is it not white house blowhards doing all of the talking?
@AEVlahosBosley @FAIRImmigration @SenBobCasey What does it mean when a state is designated ‚Äúhome of immigrants‚Äù?	Also, have you ever traveled outside the continental US? Made contact with any potential immigrants?
@BrazierSusan @FAIRImmigration @SenBobCasey Why?
@realDonaldTrump Did you condemn American peaceful protests because the oppressed were black? Asking for a friend.
@VP @POTUS The irony of you two supporting peaceful protests after condemning peaceful protests by NFL players. #hypocracy #charlatans 	You two are not working for the greater good.
https://t.co/fm7JfcJm9m
@SenToomey Are you and your counterparts going to walk away from addressing CHIP funding? Why is promoting your own agenda more important than addressing what‚Äôs important to your constitutients?
@ThomasDeal14 @FCBojangles @AmericanCuppaJo @SenBobCasey How about excessive corporate welfare and defense spending?
@RogueSNRadvisor I pray this is true.
@AmericanCuppaJo @ThomasDeal14 @SenBobCasey The middle and lower middle classes will pay for these tax cuts. No such thing as free money.
@SenDeanHeller Will low-cost health insurance programs for children disappear? If so, guess what new expense will eat up tax benefit?
RT @SenBooker: Just so we're clear on where the American people stand ‚Äì our office has received over 54,000 letters on Republican tax refor‚Ä¶
@ThomasDeal14 @SenBobCasey He is actually advocating for his constitutients and not voting out of self-interest. How it should be done.
I guess if CHIP programs go extinct, low-income families with have mega huge winning tax dollar cash giveaway proceeds to allocate towards increased healthcare expenses. #MAGA
Is it just me, or is the word ‚Äúartisan‚Äù unbearably pretentious?
Watching The Devil Wears Prada, and want to know what was in that punch Andy is told not to drink. Sounds like good stuff.
@Deborahwestgat2 @VP Can't blame our infrastructure mess on Obama, when it takes many years to degrade. I'm also not blaming Trump for the current state of infrastructure. Waiting for him to make good on a campaign promise.
@nomadjames that image is not a meme, it's a piece of art. gotta go, the 700 club is on and pat robertson's guest is "tingling with excitement"
Another astute observation by @PressSec . She's clearly been paying attention to democratic party members' criticisms of the tax bill and has thoughtfully responded to concerns. Frickin love this administration! #MAGA https://t.co/9mZ9rMr2Kz
@VP You know what works better than prayers? Action. Fix our archaic infrastructure.

@realDonaldTrump Why are you so defensive? There are more important things to discuss and tackle. Thanks for the endless distractions from important issues. National embarrassment
@nytimes How about the story of how parents can‚Äôt get that ‚Äúhot new toy‚Äù because they are underemployed and work overtime just to make enough to not qualify for food stamps.
@VP @POTUS What about the people being sold into slavery in Libya?
@PressSec WHO CARES?! I want to know what the White House has to say about slave auctions in Libya? Tell us what America the Great is doing about serious problems? Or must we constantly be subjected to infantile finger pointing from the White House?
