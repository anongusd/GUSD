@realDonaldTrump No, you’re still incorrect. You were a year ago; a month ago; a week ago; as you still are today. The buck stops with YOU. You own this. You even labeled it “the Trump Shutdown”. I’m surprised you didn’t trademark that... 🤔

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Are you even working today? With everything going on I’d think you’d be a little too busy to be tweeting all morning... have you extended “executive time” to last all day? Maybe you could, I don’t know, hire some people that actually know how to run a presidential administration?

@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump It makes me sick watching this. These kids are little entitled jerks and I’m not afraid to call it as I see it. They’re old enough to know better. If my kids did this I’d be horrified and punish them, not hiring PR specialists &amp; lawyers for them!
@realDonaldTrump You’ll do ANYTHING to divide people, won’t you? You don’t care about any of the people involved or who is even “right”. Have you considered there was blame on different sides? It’s a symptom of your rhetoric. You saying anyone is “evil” is like the pot calling the kettle black.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Maybe the GOP forgot that the House is under Dem control now? They won’t be bullied into a ridiculous vanity project the majority of Americans don’t want. DJT had two years to get it through w/ a GOP majority &amp; they wouldn’t support the wall either. This is how a democracy works.
It makes me sad that the SCOTUS decided to allow the DJT policy on banning transgender military members to continue while it moves through the lower courts. Now it’s up to the Pentagon to decide how/if they enforce it. Why would we ban ANYONE who wants to fight for our country?

@realDonaldTrump What about the GOP? I think we’d all like to know why Sen. McConnell is completely silent and unwilling to bring ANY of the House bills designed to reopen gov’t to the floor for a vote. Should we send out a search party?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Umm.... If the GOP/Dems/DJT can’t reach a deal, according to multiple WH sources &amp; DJT allies, it’s been reported that he may not immediately re-open gov’t even if he declares an emergency on the southern border, concerned it would give Dems a “win”. How is that “good faith”?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Footnote: Most Fentanyl comes from China- not South America. While we’re correcting record and focusing on pesky things like facts, it’s a good time to point out that only 6 suspected terrorists crossed the southern border in the first 1/2 of 2018. https://t.co/SraJjFbaky
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Maybe the GOP should put the same level of effort into addressing the opioid crisis as they do writing talking points and blaming people. The vast majority of drugs entering the US are not carried on the backs of immigrants. You’re either knowingly lying or don’t know the facts.
@realDonaldTrump I think you’re stressed. Why don’t you take 2 weeks off? (No tweets!) It’ll let us all rest a bit. Maybe take 2 months off- we’ll find a way to cope. If you don’t opt for the break it’s ok. When Mueller’s report comes out I’m sure you &amp; your family will all get some time off 🤣

@realDonaldTrump Elections have consequences &amp; Dems are doing their job: keeping the Exec. branch in check (instead of the GOP who allowed you to treat Congress as a branch of it). Your own party wouldn’t give you your wall! You had 2 years to do it! (2/2)
@realDonaldTrump You’re not fooling many people. Polls clearly show that the majority of us blame you &amp; the GOP. They can’t negotiate with someone who won’t compromise, constantly moves the goal posts &amp; walks back deals. Dems WANT to end it but won’t give you everything you want. (1/2)
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The Dems spend time in PR because they actually want to help people that lost thousands of their neighbors (and much more). It was a storm response your admin clearly botched. Almost all of them died in the days after the hurricane. You can deny it all you want, but it happened.
@realDonaldTrump No... YOU get crazier every day. YOU get more dishonest every day. YOU create anger and disunity. Your list of positive “accomplishments” is infinitely shorter than your negative ones. You’ve done more harm to this country in 2 years than one of our biggest adversaries: Putin.
@realDonaldTrump All you do is lie. They were suspicious of you BEFORE that. Maybe it was the 4 campaign aides they’d watched for years before you ran. Might’ve been things like encouraging a US enemy to hack into HRC. Or your shady biz dealings. Or all of it &amp; more. But, you already know this...

I can only think of one good reason why Mnuchin lifted sanctions on Deripaska-linked $ late last year. If DJT pardons Manafort, Deripaska will still want his $ from him- but a favor like this could protect Manafort, giving him more incentive to stay quiet and be patient. #Mueller
@stevenmnuchin1 How can you defend lifting sanctions passed by Congress on $ linked to Oleg Deripaska despite his links to the 2016 campaign interference? Why do it- and why now? Who had you do it? Hopefully Congress is able to stop this. Don’t you have better things to do? https://t.co/f8dKmJrpxw
