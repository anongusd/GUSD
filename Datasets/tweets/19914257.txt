"The dream is under attack. The dreamers are in danger. And we need each other more that we realize in this country,” Cory Booker says from the pulpit in historic Brown’s Chapel in Selma, Ala.
"My roots go back to slavery,” Cory Booker says in Selma. "Rose up from poverty and segregation. Rose up from black churches, through civil rights organizations"
Cory Booker pays tribute from the pulpit to Hillary Clinton. "She won the election,” someone in the congregation says. "She got more votes,” Booker responds. “She got more votes."
During a break in the service here at historic Brown’s Chapel in Selma, Hillary Clinton takes out her phone and begins scrolling. Cory Booker fetches a small bottled water for Jesse Jackson.
“We can take back this country,” Hillary Clinton says to conclude remarks in Selma, as the congregation in Brown’s Chapel rises to its feet.
"Between 2012, the prior presidential election where we still had the Voting Rights Act, and 2016, when I was on the ballot, there were fewer voters in Georgia than there were in the prior election,” Clinton adds. “Think about it"
“I was the first to run without the Voting Rights Act,” Hillary Clinton says. "And I can tell you, it does make a difference."
"Never forget,” Hillary Clinton tells a congregation in Selma. "There is another side in America. And they never give up…they are motivated every single day to try to suppress rights.”

“Stacey Abrams should be governor,” Hillary Clinton says, making the case of voter suppression in Georgia and elsewhere.
“Make no mistake,” Hillary Clinton says in Selma. “We are living through a full-fledged crisis of our democracy.”
Man presenting Hillary Clinton with “international unity award” outlines why: “She was elected president of the United States, and it was stolen from her,” he says, as crowd stands for ovation. “It was stolen from her by the FBI...it was stolen from her by the Russians.”
When Cory Booker left the stage here in Selma, Hillary Clinton stood and gave a big hug. The warmth was palpable. When Bernie Sanders left the stage, she stood and, as he was briskly walking past, it appeared they briefly shook hands. The chilliness was palpable.

Joe Biden recounts how, while he was in Munich, his successor Mike Pence (“a guy who’s a decent guy”) said he was there on behalf of President Trump. “It was dead silence,” Biden says. “Dead silence. The fact of the matter is, they in fact no longer trust our commitment.”

Joe Biden: "I can die a happy man never having lived in the White House. But what I don’t want to do Is take people’s time, effort and commitment without there being a clear shot I could be the nominee. I think I can. I think that’s where we are...."
"We’re also taking a hard look at whether or not this alleged appeal I have -- how deep does it run? Is it real?" Joe Biden says of whether he'll run for president.
"I will not be part of a Super PAC," Joe Biden says, while expanding upon his decision-making process for a presidential bid.
Joe Biden says that a lot has changed since the last time he was on a ballot. "Between then and now, the whole issue of social media and the use of social media has fundamentally changed," he says.
"I don’t want to his to be a fool’s errand," Joe Biden says of a presidential campaign. "I want to make sure if we do this -- and I’m very close to making a decision -- that I am fully prepared to do it."
Joe Biden says after several family meetings, "there’s a consensus I should – they…want me to run." He adds: "The first hurdle for me was deciding whether or not I am comfortable taking the family through what would be a very very, very difficult campaign."
Joe Biden says when he first arrived in Senate he didn't know many people. Met them in the gym where, he says, "everybody walks around in their birthday suit." With Ted Kennedy, he met William Fulbright and Jennings Randolph. 	"The first time I met these guys, I saw all of them.”

Jon Meacham: “I’m not a Democrat, I’m not a Republican; I’ve voted for both and plan to continue to.” Looks over at Joe Biden. "That was your cue."		Joe Biden: "I'm treading very carefully here."

Bernie Sanders says he will release 10 years of tax returns, as Elizabeth Warren already has. “Our tax returns will bore you to death,” he says. They will be released “sooner than later…We just have to do a few little things.” He adds again: “They are very boring tax returns."
“We have hired some of the best people in the country to help on this issue,” Bernie Sanders says of his campaign’s sexual harassment policy.

“Build that wall!” the crowd chants. Trump corrects them. “Finish that wall.” He claims much of it has already been built.  		The US-Mexico border is 1,954 miles. There’s 654 miles in existing barrier. And as of January, 0 miles of barriers had been added since he took office.
“That may be the end of his presidential bid,” President Trump says of Beto O’Rourke, touting his crowd size.
“We were all challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz,” President Trump says of Beto O’Rourke. “A young man who’s got very little going for himself except a great first name."
“Walls do not save lives. Walls end lives.” — Beto O'Rourke

Tired of caucusing on a cold winter night? Iowa Democrats move closer to an optional tele-caucus format. My look at what would be the most sweeping changes to the quirky caucus format since its inception in 1972: https://t.co/Qt1TcdTXdx
NH Secretary of State Bill Gardner tells me “so far it doesn’t appear that they’re changing it from a caucus,” but he reserved judgment until the Iowa plan is final. “It’s not all together yet. It’s just mostly an idea or theoretical...but ideas sometimes can morph.”

@tackettdc To make it like the in-person caucus, perhaps those participating virtually will be told to stand in a corner somewhere, anywhere. Then they will be placed on hold, and told to wait around while someone tabulates the results.
Iowa party officials flew out to NH last year to ensure that whatever changes they made would not trigger NH to move up their primary date. They think the changes they are making will be ok with NH Secretary of State Bill Gardner.
Iowa Democrats will also release raw vote totals from the first votes, which will show what share candidates received before taking into account the 15 percent viability threshold needed to advance.
These are the most significant changes to the Iowa caucuses since their inception in 1972. They are meant to allow for absentee voting. They also make an already complicated voting system a bit more so.
JUST IN: Iowa Democrats are expanding the caucus system for 2020, allowing for six "virtual caucuses" for those who can't make it in-person. They'll take place over the phone, with participants ranking top five choices. 10% of Iowa's delegates will be awarded this way.

“I hope he runs,” Bradley Cooper says of Beto O’Rourke. “We need inspiration.”
"Ok end of the month. What’s today? Couldn’t he say Valentines Day?” Oprah says after Beto leaves. "We should have started with tequila shots. That would have got it out of him."
Oprah to Beto: "You seem like you’re getting ready to run.” Beto leans back and smiles. And the interview concludes.
Beto O’Rourke pauses for a beat. "Even saying these words, it’s hard to believe that I’m saying I met with Barack Obama. And I’m saying it to Oprah Winfrey.”
Beto O’Rourke on if President Obama asked him to run for president: “No he didn’t. He didn’t.” Adds that they did talk about him possibly running, just that Obama wasn’t explicitly encouraging him.
Beto O’Rourke on his meeting with President Obama: "I am so tense and tight,” he recalls. He says he “mind controlled my body and expressions and tried to look relaxed"
“Someone who works for him served me a cup of coffee in a porcelain cup,” Beto O’Rourke says of meeting with Obama after Oprah asks if refreshments were served.
Beto O’Rourke on his decision process about running for president: “I’m increasingly excited about doing something."
"The reason I respect your process is I firmly believe you have to feel it within yourself,” Oprah says. "Not what everybody else says, that I believe I can answer this call for this particular moment in our time."
Beto turns the tables on Oprah: "Many of the questions you have been asking me, people would like to know the answer form you.” Will she run for president?
Beto O’Rourke says of when he’ll decide on running for president: "The serious answer is really soon. Before the end of this month.”
It was unclear beforehand what Beto O’Rourke would say to Oprah. Oprah is almost begging him to get in the race. And he is all-but-announcing that he plans to run.
Oprah is now trying to talk Beto into giving a definitive yes on running for president, pointing out Obama’s kids got to spend more time with him when he was in the White House.
Beto O’Rourke says that the campaign was hardest on his oldest son, because he was away so much. After a few months at home, he says: "Our oldest, Ulysses…is about ready for me to leave the house."
Oprah recasts Beto O'Rourke’s explanation, saying that he is leaning toward running for president. He does not correct her.
Oprah: "Will you be running?”		Beto: "That’s a big question for us to think through...You can tell. I’m so excited at the prospect of being able to play that role"		Oprah: "What’s it gonna take!?! What’s it gonna take for you to say yes, I’m doing it?"
Beto to Oprah: “I have been thinking about running for president.” Huge cheers
Beto O’Rourke on him going on his road trip to get out of his “funk”: “I had to be moving, I had to be meeting people. It’s just how I think, how I find the next step. I just truly emerged out of this by being with people.”
"How you come out of your funk at least in my case, you stop looking at yourself. You look at others,” Beto O’Rourke says.
Oprah: When you go home and wake up and it’s done and you didn’t win, is there a sunken place?		Beto: "Yes. Felt a profound disappointment in myself that I had let so many people down."
Beto O’Rourke to Oprah: "We’re up to all these challenges. We just need a politics, a representation that reflects our values, our goodness, our kindness."
Oprah: What did the US Senate race teach you?		Beto O’Rourke: "People are so good. The division that we see in our country, the animosity, the conflict, the vilification almost dehumanization for the views that they hold…I didn’t find that when I met people across Texas.”
"At a time when so much of our politics is tested and scripted,” Beto O’Rourke says of his US Senate race, he tried to offer “something new and maybe even dangerous.” No speechwriter, no pollster.
Oprah on loss to Ted Cruz: Why do you think you lost?		"I don’t all the way know,” Beto O’Rourke says. "I know we could have won that race."
Oprah says she first noticed Beto O’Rourke during the border separations. Told her friend Gayle King to go find him: “He’s a tall guy. He looks sorta like Robert Kennedy or one of those Kennedy guys."
“I wanted to know what all the fuss was about,” Oprah says if Beto O’Rourke. “Are you the real deal?” https://t.co/sVhPnMevGx

"It has take time" for him to realize he is not in the photo of men dressed in blackface and a KKK outfit. But, he says upon some reflection, he is not in it. “I am convinced."
“I would have been glad to talk about it but nobody asked and I didn’t see the need,” Ralph Northam says of previously bringing up his dressing in blackface as Michael Jackson.
“I hope everybody in Virginia will be patient with me,” Ralph Northam says.
Ralph Northam says that some of his friends did call him “coonman,” but maintains he does not know why. “I don’t know what their intent was with that."
Ralph Northam is asked if he can still moonwalk. He looks around as if he’s about to try it. His wife looks over and says, “Inappropriate circumstances.” Northam agrees, and moves on to another question.
“This literally hit me like a ton of bricks last night. It took me totally off guard.” — Ralph Northam
"I have had a drink over the years, several drinks over the years,” Ralph Northam says. "But I’ve never been not in touch with my surroundings."
Ralph Northam says that yearbook photo editors probably mixed up this one photo on his page. Although he notes that the other three photos on his page were ones that he submitted.
Ralph Northam further explains why he wore blackface to dress as Michael Jackson in 1984. "It was a dance contest. I actually won the contest because I had learned to do the moonwalk."
“I dressed up as — what’s his name, the singer?” Northam asks his wife. “Michael Jackson.” He continues to explain how he put shoe polish on his face.
I did not steal my neighbor’s car. I stole his neighbor’s car. And I’m ready to be forgiven.
“There is no way I have been in a KKK uniform,” Ralph Northam says.
“My main nickname in high school and in college was goose,” Ralph Northam says, on account of his changing voice. He says that he was also called “coonman,” and he regrets that.
Ralph Northam maintains that he was not in the photo. But offers that he did dress up in blackface, as Michael Jackson, during an event in San Antonio around that time period.
“I am not either of the people in that photo,” Ralph Northam claims.
“When my staff showed me the photo yesterday, I was seeing it for the first time,” Ralph Northam said, adding he didn’t buy the yearbook.

Kamala Harris benefits from the town hall format, which she’ll be doing plenty of in the early states. She remembers and restates the names of the questioners. Looks people in the eye, rises to address them personally.
“I haven’t listened and I would suggest that no one listen to that kind of conversations,” Kamala Harris says of the notion that a male candidate would be better positioned to defeat President Trump.
“I support a Green New Deal,” Sen. Kamala Harris declares. “Climate change is an existential threat to us."
“I’m not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances,” Kamala Harris says
“We’ve seen in the last two years there’s new fuel that has been lighting that fire,” Kamala Harris says of racism, sexism, anti-semitism.

Kamala Harris has started with a campaign theme “For the people.” But interspersed through her announcement speech is another one: “This is our America."
The song just as Kamala Harris ends her speech? "I am not throwing away my shot"
"I’m running for president so that no mother or father has to teach their own son that people may stop him, arrest him, chase him or arrest him because of his race.” — Kamala Harris
" With faith in God, with fidelity to country and with the fighting spirit I got from my mother – I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States.” — Kamala Harris
“We have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware.” — Kamala Harris
Obama had 15,000 in Springfield, Illinois, for his 2007 announcement speech (https://t.co/jprmWPqQGd) https://t.co/akCytqbEwA
"Too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America	Too many black and brown Americans are being locked up,” Kamala Harris says. "Our criminal justice system needs drastic repair. Let’s speak that truth."
"When we have children in cages…don’t you dare call that border security -- that’s a human rights abuse!” Kamala Harris says. "And that’s not our America!"
“America, we are better than this,” Kamala Harris says. "We are better than this.”
"Folks, on the subject of transnational gangs lets be perfectly clear: The president’s medieval vanity project is not going to stop them.” — Kamala Harris

Hyde-Smith says Trump told her “You have been through a storm. And you survived it...with grace." 		“He just really was very complimentary. He said, ‘Anybody as tough as you are, we need you in DC and I need you on my team.'”
Asked by reporters about her public hanging comment, Cindy Hyde-Smith says: "We have apologized for that. We’re going to go on and – the people of Mississippi, they are really concerned about today’s events, today’s issues."
"No matter who you voted for today, I’m going to always represent every Mississippian,” Cindy Hyde-Smith says. "I’m going to do my very best to make you proud.”

"We have bonded, we have persevered, we have gotten through things.” — Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith
“Right now, Mr. President, thank you so much for all of your help,” Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith says (noting she knows the president is watching, because she just spoke with him on the phone).

President Trump goes on an extended riff in Montana on why he doesn’t talk about the good economy as much, because the crowds would get bored hearing him say it over and over. So…he’s back to immigration.
“CNN is telling me how to run the campaign, but in the meantime, I’m president. And they’re not.” — President Trump
“Barbed wire used properly can be a beautiful sight.” — President Trump
“I’m the only one who ever tells you the facts,” President Trump says. 		Which is, of course, not true.
President Trump, campaigning in Montana, has talked far more about Ronnie Jackson than he has about Matt Rosendale, the candidate he’s ostensibly there to support.

Serious question: Has President Trump ever met someone who is seeking asylum?
@cardinals150 @nickconfessore I have. The Senate rejected Trump's immigration bill in February by a vote of 39-to-60. They lost 14 Republicans. The filibuster was not an issue. In the House, which has no filibuster, a Trump-backed immigration bill failed 193-to-231.
"Republicans are in unison, they want to change them," President Trump says of immigration laws. Which is not true. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House -- and have been unable to pass anything to reform the immigration system.
President Trump uses his twitter account to drive messages. It's been three weeks since he mentioned Justice Kavanaugh, once a driver of GOP enthusiasm. 		Over that time period, he's mentioned the caravan or the border in almost 40 tweets.
Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is asked: "Do you identify as a white nationalist?"		"Sir! Stop it!" he responds. "You're done." He then requests security to remove the man from the room. https://t.co/DOc931ACXB

Jacky Rosen says she’d support Chuck Schumer as leader of Senate Democrats, but won’t say whether Nancy Pelosi should lead House Democrats. “I don’t have a vote on that...She’s been doing her job a long time. She’s had a lot of experience.”
Dean Heller: “Ask the president. We fought like cats and dogs. What happened was success…We started working together, and it built trust.”
Dean Heller evokes a two-year-old girl that his daughter adopted, then looks at Jacky Rosen. "She does have preexisting conditions -- and I will protect those preexisting conditions for that little Chinese girl.”
Jacky Rosen: "I have a grass roots campaign."		Dean Heller: "Yeah, that grassroots campaign is in California, New York and Massachusetts."
Senator Dean Heller says that Dr. Ford was victimized twice. Once as a teenager, and again by Senate Democrats. "What Feinstein did to her was atrocious," he says.
Senator Dean Heller: "You can be for the #MeToo movement and for the rule of law at the same time…that’s why Justice Kavanaugh is on the Supreem Court today."
Dean Heller: "My opponent was raised in Chicago, Illinois. I don’t want Chicago laws here in Nevada.”		Jacky Rosen: "Oh, my."
Dean Heller on partisanship: "The media is to blame, too. You see how they treat Trump supporters, you see how they treat Kanye West when he goes to the White House."
Dean Heller on border separations: "My opponent went down to the border for a photo op."		Jacky Rosen: "I went down there to check on the children...I was doing my job."
"I have two children, two grandchildren with preexisting conditions," Senator Dean Heller says.		"Watch the tape," Rep Jacky ROsen responds

The Republican Party and all its fissures — and, for some, discomfort with President Trump as leader of the GOP — on full display here with testy exchanges between Bob Corker and Mike Pompeo.
Senator Bob Corker has expressed dismay and concern with President Trump’s actions before. It is more striking seeing him do it in an august chamber, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Senator Bob Corker says he believes that Mike Pompeo is a patriot. “It’s the president’s actions that cause tremendous distrust,” says the Republican from Tennessee.
Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) assures Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that many don’t have issues with him. “It’s the president,” he says, "who causes concerns."

Putin says Trump brought up charged that Russia influenced the 2016 US election. “I had to reiterate…the Russian state has never interfered and is never going to interfere into American internal affairs,” Putin says.

Trump often seizes on conflict, exploiting domestic divisions in a way that he sees as beneficial. His remarks just now show how much he’s testing whether that works with foreign countries that have, or could pursue, nuclear weapons.
President Trump says that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in North Korea in “probably an hour"
“At this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea,” President Trump announces.

“The United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.” — President Trump
"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,” President Trump says. "The iran deal is defective at its core."
"If I allowed this deal to stand there would soon be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East,” President Trump says, without addressing that the arms race could now accelerate without the deal.
“This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made. It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.” — President Trump
Giving Iran money that was held in US banks, President Trump says, “was a great embarrassment to me as a citizen.”
Withdrawing from the Iran deal is perhaps the most consequential decision President Trump has made since taking office. It has huge ramifications, some known right now and some unknown.

Just after the Iran deal was agreed to in 2015, John Kerry emotionally recounted serving in Vietnam. He said he vowed then, if given the opportunity, he would do everything within his power to prevent war. “I learned in war the price that is paid when diplomacy fails,” he said.

Nobody parties like the DMZ parties. https://t.co/w45FYWZrSe
President Trump says that he likes the idea of holding the meeting with North Korea at the DMZ. If a deal is made, he says, "There’s a great celebration to be had."

Nigerian president Buhari, on whether they discussed Trump’s “shithole” comment: “I’m very troubled with what the press says…I’m not sure about the validity...The best things is for me to keep quiet.”		President Trump: “We didn’t discuss it."

“Seven years is tomorrow.” — President Trump
“People don’t realize what a big country Mexico is,” President Trump says — which, given statements, often means someone recently told him how big Mexico is.
With the Iran nuclear deal under perhaps its most dire threat yet, is there any vociferous defender of it? Macron and Merkel trying to speak in favor internationally, but is anyone prominently backing it domestically?
What Netanyahu is presenting so far doesn’t seem new: We knew that Iran was attempting to become nuclear capable. The Iran nuclear deal was about preventing them from continuing to build it.
Indicating his audience, Israeli prime minister Bibi Netanyahu, speaking from Tel Aviv, is making a presentation first in English. Next, he says he’ll do it in Hebrew.
Netanyahu says that a few weeks ago Israel obtained "half a ton" of Iran’s nuclear files. He says they have 55,000 pages of documents, as well as 183 CDs outlining Iran’s nuclear program.
Bibi Netanyahu in Israel says he’s about to unveil “new and conclusive proof about the secret weapons program that Iran has been hiding."

It’s as if Congress is in a rowboat, searching for direction. Occasionally, Trump will put the ore in and slightly move it to a direction. Then, he’ll move it in the other direction. Then he’ll tell Joe and Pat to just take out a map and figure it out. It’ll be beautiful.

Elizabeth Warren’s husband, Bruce, was here for her speech before the National Congress of American Indians.
"We must weave our voices together to make them strong,” Elizabeth Warren says. "We must come together to write a new story, not just for Native Americans, but for all Americans."
Elizabeth Warren is making a passionate pledge to advocate for issues of importance for Native Americans. “This must stop,” she says of discrimination and inattention. “And I promise I will fight to help write a different story.”
In a major speech for Elizabeth Warren, she addresses a conference of Native Americans. Our story on the breaking news: https://t.co/Jb43AJ9HYN
Elizabeth Warren, speaking to a group of Native Americans: “It is deeply offensive that this President keeps a portrait of Andrew Jackson hanging in the Oval Office, honoring a man who did his best to wipe out Native people.”
Elizabeth Warren: “There’s another story that also needs to be told.  The story of our country’s mistreatment of your communities.  And this isn’t just a story about casual racism – war whoops and Tomahawk chops and insulting Facebook memes."
“The story they lived will always be a part of me,” Elizabeth Warren says of her parents, and her mother’s heritage. “And no one—not even the President of the United States—will ever take that part of me away.”
Warren: “For far too long, your story has been pushed aside, to be trotted out only in cartoons and commercials. So I’m here today to make a promise: Every time someone brings up my family’s story, I’m going to use it to lift up the story of your families and your communities.”
Full text of Elizabeth Warren’s speech to the National Congress of American Indians, where she’s making a surprise appearance: https://t.co/PPkhkXNCwh
Warren is not apologizing for her story, or claims that her mother’s family had Cherokee blood – instead, reaffirming: “My mother’s family was part Native American.”
Responding to critics who claim she used a minority status to gain prestigious law professorships, Warren says: “I never used my family tree to get a break or get ahead. I never used it to advance my career.”
Elizabeth Warren: “The joke, I guess, is supposed to be on me. I get why some people think there’s hay to be made here. You won’t find my family members on any rolls, and I’m not enrolled in a tribe. And I want to make something clear. I respect that distinction.”
Warren directly rebuts Trump: “Indigenous people have been telling the story of Pocahontas–the real Pocahontas–for centuries. A story of heroism. Bravery. Pain. And, for almost as long, her story has been taken away by powerful people who twisted it to serve their own purposes”
Warren contrasts the fable of Pocahontas – of a woman who met colonist John Smith, fell in love, and became a positive tale of colonization – with a darker story of abduction and imprisonment.
“I’ve noticed that every time my name comes up, President Trump likes to talk about Pocahontas,” Elizabeth Warren says before a conference of Native Americans. “So I figured, let’s talk about Pocahontas.”
BREAKING: Elizabeth Warren just took the stage at the National Congress of American Indians. In a surprise appearance, she plans to forcefully rebut Trump’s use of “Pocahontas” as a slur, address the issue of her heritage more directly, and pledge to work on Native issues. https://t.co/SIP00peTNB

“The president, above everything else, supports the victims,” says Sarah Huckabee Sanders, running, above everything else, counter to all available evidence.
How does the president define “due process”? Does it mean photos? Does it need to be tried in court? Is an interview under penalty of perjury enough? And how does that square with him leading “lock her up” chants from a political stage?
“Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders says. 		The president himself has not said that. In fact, he’s done the opposite, drawing into question the accounts of such victims.

Rand Paul is now on his fourth chart. And as the clock ticks, the chances of the government shutting down at midnight is turning more and more likely.
Senator Rand Paul seems like he’s going to be talking for a long time. But he’s TALKING SO LOUDLY! HIS VOICE MAY NOT LAST!! AS LONG AS HE WANTS IT TO!!!
“What you’re seeing is recklessness trying to be passed off as bipartisanship. There’s only one bad guy standing in the way,” says Senator Rand Paul (the “one bad guy")
“The day of reckoning may be the collapse of the stock market. The day of reckoning may be the collapse of the dollar. I can’t tell you when it’s going to happen.” — Senator Rand Paul
“I care about our soldiers!” Senator Rand Paul says. "In fact, you know what I’d do? I’d bring them all home from Afghanistan. Declare victory and have a parade."

The White House message to women who have been abused: If you have photos, your allegations will be taken more seriously.
“You’ve got to take allegations seriously, you’ve got to take denials seriously.” — Raj Shah
Shorter WH explanation: It’s a lot different seeing a picture of a woman with a black eye given to her by a top WH staffer than just reading or hearing about it.
Raj Shah on what John Kelly was not aware of related to the Rob Porter allegations: “He had not seen images."
“Omarosa was fired three times on The Apprentice, and this was the fourth time we let her go. She had limited contact with the president when she was here. She has no contact with him now.” — @RajShah45
“We all could have done better over the last few hours, the last few days, in this situation.” — White House spokesman Raj Shah
John Kelly "became fully aware of these allegations yesterday,” according to Raj Shah. Well was he partially aware? “I’m not going to get into specifics,” Shah says.
Rob Porter's background check was ongoing. It was not denied, and he was operating on an interim clearance, according to the White House.
“It’s important to remember that Rob Porter has repeatedly denied these allegations, and done so publicly,” Raj Shah says, saying they are still “serious and disturbing."
During a White House background check, WH spokesman Raj Shah says, "Some information may arise that is troubling."
Given that the White House briefing is at least 90 minutes behind schedule, the “two minute warning” means that it will be starting in about 10 minutes.

@katherinemiller Perhaps not the average person (if they aren't watching TV or reading a paper). But seems the Democratic base is. And they just saw their party go from “Hell no!” to “Ok, fine” within hours of a shutdown’s impact.
Democrats have managed to accede to Republican demands, demoralize their energized base, give a disengaged president a win, and look like they held a meaningless three day government shutdown — all at once.
Democrats are saying that 1) they trust McConnell to hold a DACA vote 2) after that vote, it will be taken up in the House 3) that this will happen even though the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform in 2013 and it died in the House 4) that the president will sign it
If all Democrats are getting is a commitment from McConnell to hold vote on DACA, it’s hard not to view this as a major capitulation from a party that seemed ready and willing to fight.

Dr. Ronny Jackson says that, to the best of his knowledge, no sitting president before has taken a cognitive exam. “He has gone above and beyond…to demonstrate his cognitive abilities,” he says of President Trump.
“The president encouraged me to come out. He specifically told me…answer every single question they have.” — Dr. Ronny Jackson
“The president can watch as much TV as he wants. I don’t know how much TV he watches.” — Dr. Ronny Jackson
"He has a very unique ability to just get up in the morning and reset” — Dr. Ronny Jackson
President Trump does seem to have good health genes. His father lived to 93. His mother lived to 88. Most of his grandparents lived into their 80s or 90s (his paternal grandfather, who died of emphysema at 48, being the exception)
President Trump uses a lot of Purell, which his doctor is appreciative of.
“He doesn’t sleep much,” Dr. Ronny Jackson says. "I would say he sleeps four or five hours a night. That’s probably why he’s been successful.”
President Trump has asked his doctor to get a nutritionist involved, giving Dr. Ronny Jackson more of a role in what the president eats at the White House.
This kind of transparency from the White House on President Trump’s medical exam is great. The American public deserve the same kind of transparency on his tax returns.
“We didn’t examine his — for bone spurs right now,” Dr. Ronny Jackson says, referring to a 1968 health deferment that made President Trump ineligible to serve during Vietnam.
President Trump’s doctor, asked why he’s healthy given a poor diet and no exercise: “It’s called genetics…He has incredible genes."
“He has a lot of energy. A lot of energy and a lot of stamina,” White House doctor Ronny Jackson says of President Trump
“Right now on a day to day basis he doesn’t have a dedicated, defined exercise program. That’s what I’m working on.” — President Trump’s doctor, Ronny Jackson
“He’s very independent when it comes to his medical stuff,” Dr. Ronny Jackson says of President Trump. "He doesn’t come to me for bandaids and that kinda stuff."
“Absolutely, he’s fit for duty,” says presidential physician Dr. Ronny Jackson. “He has a very strong and very probable possibility of making it through his presidency without any medical issues."
“If I had concerns about his cognitive ability…I would bring that up to the proper people in the chain of command, maybe starting with the chief of staff.” — Dr. Ronny Jackson, the presidential physician
President Trump got 30 out of 30 on an exam testing his cognitive abilities, which rules out things like early-onset Alzheimer’s. “He’s very sharp. He’s very articulate when he speaks to me,” Dr. Ronny Jackson says.
President Trump, according to his doctor, does not wear dentures.
Dr. Ronny Jackson says that President Trump asked to have a cognitive test to prove there was nothing wrong with his abilities. “I have absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability,” Jackson said.
President Trump’s doctor says that he is 75 inches tall and weighs 239 pounds. Just one more pound and, at that height and weight, he would be considered obese, according to the CDC. https://t.co/6IiZ4xSIwV

It doesn’t exactly help the White House pushback of the Michael Wolff book to have a prominent Republican senator saying President Trump was one person at 10am on Thursday and a completely different person two hours later.
Asked if he was referring to Chief of Staff John Kelly, he adds: “General Kelly is a fine man, but he’s also part of the staff."
“I don’t think the president was well served by his staff…but he’s responsible for the way he conducts himself.” — Senator Lindsey Graham

“I don’t know how we right this ship.” — Senator Lindsey Graham
“This has turned into an s-show.” — Senator Lindsey Graham
Lindsey Graham seems like a senator who is deeply frustrated with the White House, upset with President Trump’s negotiating tactics, and angered by any questioning of Dick Durbin’s integrity.
“How does this movie end?” — Senator Lindsey Graham
“Dick Durbin called me and said, ‘I had the best conversation ever with the president,’” Senator Lindsey Graham says of a phone call on at 10am on Thursday.

@spdstr @SpinDr @POTUS No one is arguing that President Trump’s tax returns are simple. But complexity is hardly a reason to withhold something from public view. He, like his predecessors, is not above scrutiny.
To anyone, no matter your party affiliation, who thinks their vote doesn’t matter or count: The entire balance of power in the Virginia House of Delegates right now is contingent on a single vote. https://t.co/l3i2xpJeSG
@spdstr @SpinDr I have, in fact, gone through some complicated tax returns: The ones released by Mitt Romney in 2012 when he -- like most candidates in recent history who aren’t named Trump -- released his tax returns.
“The president’s taxes are still under audit,” Sarah Sanders says. "As long as they are under audit, he’s not going to release his taxes.”  (People under audit can release their own taxes. As Richard Nixon did)
Does the president believe in UFOs? Sarah Huckabee Sanders: “Somehow that question hasn’t come up in our back and forth over the past couple of days. But I’ll ask and circle back."
No mincing words from @sethmoulton, who calls the House passage of the tax bill “one of the darkest days in Congressional history.” https://t.co/xwBYxtBc3l
Paul Ryan predicts polling will turn around on taxes. But here’s the challenge: 		On the eve of Obamacare passage, Gallup had 42% supporting and 49% opposed — and Dems paid a steep political price. 		Taxes is worse: Gallup survey has 29% approval and 56% disapproval.

President Trump has great empathy for any female accusers. Unless those accusers are the more than a dozen accusing him. In which case they are liars.
“The president has firsthand knowledge on what he did or didn’t do,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders says, denying claims of the women (who also have firsthand knowledge of what he did)
“The American people knew this, and voted for the president.” — Sarah Huckabee Sanders, on allegations of sexual misconduct
Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Trump’s accusers: "This took place long before he was elected president. The people of this country, in a decisive election, supported President Trump.”
Samantha Holvey, a former Miss USA contestant who says President Trump walked into her dressing room: “Other folks have resigned. I think he should. I don’t think he ever will.”
None of the accusations women are making against President Trump are new. But they are challenging just how significantly the cultural ground has shifted, and whether they resonate differently with people now.
Jessica Leeds said Trump put his hand up her skirt while the two of them were in first class. “That was the last time I wore a skirt traveling,” she says.
"If they were willing to investigate Senator Franken, it’s only fair that they do the same for Trump,” Rachel Crooks says, urging Congress to investigate the president’s treatment of women.
“In some areas the accusations of sexual aggression were taken seriously…Except for our president,” says Jessica Leeds, who says President Trump groped her while on an airplane.
“Hold Mr. Trump to the same standard as Harvey Weinstein,” urges Rachel Crooks, who says the president forcibly kissed her 12 years ago. She is urging Congress to investigate President Trump’s longstanding sexual mistreatment of women.
