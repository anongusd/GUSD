I have held my story in until now. Not that it wouldn't have been important before, but it is REALLY important now. I want to make sure #ChristineBaseyFord knew how much we stand behind, with, below, next to you. YOU have our voice and it is LOUD.
But the closeness, the touch..... I miss.
I haven't wanted to be with a man since. I do not fear them, nor do I loath them or avoid them. I think I have an association with my experiences and intimacy. I am in my late 40s now. I am extremely content and absolutely love everything about myself. I am complete.
Fourth time I was with a very controlling, narcasistic man for 5 years in late 30s. Go figure. He was manipulative and physically abusive, yes, but all the nights I told him "NO" (which made him worse), were the ones I remember. It took me 5 yrs to leave. My fault. #IDidntReport
They arrested him. However, before it went to court, they had another rape incident with the same last name. They mixmatched one of her pieces of evidence in mine and made it all tainted. He was released. I did sue him and the resort.
A stranger grabbed me from behind, threw me between 2 parked cars face down and raped me. Then he stood over me with my shorts and bikini bottoms around my knees, and urinated on me.  Someone found me. Called an ambulance and police. #IDidReport just not by choice.
Third time I was 27, went to a weekend wedding at a resort. The night before the wedding, we we had been dancing at the bar and decided to go to the pool. So we all went to get our swimsuits on in our rooms. After changing, I went to find my bf and passed through a dark prkg lot
At my 10yr reunion, a mutual friend said he broke down in front of her at some point saying he did "something" to me he regreted.  And for whatever reason I felt sorry for him.  My fault.
Second time I was in HS at my senior graduation party.  I drank, alot that night. I passed out in my friends bed and woke up naked the next morning next to him. I started my period that night, had a tampon in. Didn't find it for 3 days and I was a virgin. #IDidntReport
First time I was young (around 8 I think). I woke up to my older cousin trying to sodomize me. #IDidReport to family and they asked why I would lie about something like that.....  Immediately, I felt it was my fault. I haven't spoken of it again until now.
