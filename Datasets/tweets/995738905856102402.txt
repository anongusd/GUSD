@realDonaldTrump You chill
@realDonaldTrump This feels racist
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 I‚Äôm all for qualified candidates, but I don‚Äôt think a test is the best way of going about it.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 This creates a circumstance where the majority of people who can serve are wealthy, white, and male, which is not representative of the country. These are similar circumstances to the ones we have now, except with a test, if you don‚Äôt pass, you won‚Äôt be allowed to serve.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 You gave an example of the SAT.  The SAT was originally designed to prove white kids were smarter than black kids, and today, wealthy kids are more likely to score highly on the SAT.  I think a test for public office would cause a similar problem.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 Uneducated farmers effected by fracking may not know the science behind it, but if it‚Äôs creating problems on their farm, they know it‚Äôs a problem. Meanwhile the presidents of the energy corporations, who surely have the resources to pass some sort of test, are okay with fracking.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 Listen you asked for objections and I‚Äôm giving mine. No logical person wants an idiot in office but knowing a lot about fine arts and math doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre wiser. Uneducated isn‚Äôt equal to unintelligent.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 I think there should be a system so unqualified people can‚Äôt be in office, but when you‚Äôre representing the people, what does unqualified mean?  In the mining counties of North Dakota, a life long, college-educated NY politician isn‚Äôt really qualified to represent the miners.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 Just something to think about
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 Not to mention, even if you pass on the ethics or conservation exam or whatever, you can still vote however you want.  I‚Äôve certainly written essays on tests that supports a point of view I don‚Äôt agree with because I thought it would get me a better grade.
@TheUSASingers @BobbyB44384337 I don‚Äôt know.  At its surface this seems like a good idea, but if you think about it this heavily favors the elite and the rich because if they a) likely already know a lot of these things and b) they can afford study materials if they don‚Äôt.
@Kokomothegreat @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt like mitchy but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an idiot.  An idiot can‚Äôt convince millions to vote so extremely against their interests time and time and time again.  He‚Äôs a monster and he‚Äôs despicable but he‚Äôs no idiot.

However, Bill Clinton was acquitted over party lines, so unless Mitch McConnell and his friends are feeling a little more ethical than usual, I don‚Äôt know how likely it is to expect a removal from office.
It‚Äôs looking more and more realistic that the soon to be Democratic House of Representatives will impeach Donald dearest.
Richard Nixon was never impeached because he resigned before the House of Representatives got the chance, because he would surely be removed from office.
Two presidents have been impeached, both unsuccessfully, Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs Vice President and Bill Clinton.  They were both acquitted in the senate, Johnson not only one vote.
Once a federal employee is removed from office, it‚Äôs not a conviction of an actual criminal case.  That needs to be processed regularly through the judiciary.
The constitutional grounds for impeachment are as follows: ‚ÄúThe President, Vice President and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.‚Äù
The Chief Justice resides over the impeachment trial, but his role is entirely ceremonial.
Removal from office only comes when the senate rules that he or she actually committed the crime during an impeachment trial, where the senators act as jurors.
(Thread) Just so everyone knows:	Impeachment is a formal accusation against a civil servant of committing a crime, put forth by the House of Representatives.

@virginiahair1 @jlvallas @AuschwitzMuseum @CarolForden @barabooSD These kids should never have done this.  But if what students are saying is true teachers and administrators have allowed and in some cases promotes hate speech and bullying.
@virginiahair1 @jlvallas @AuschwitzMuseum @CarolForden @barabooSD Teachers have an extremely difficult and thankless job, but it is one they chose, and they should do it well, which is not what happened in this school.
