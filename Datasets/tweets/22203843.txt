This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior.”     	 1st Timothy 2 1-3
“First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.
Pray that each one would have godly discernment and act with integrity. 	Pray that God would restore a spirit of unity among our governing bodies and the American people — and that He would guide our nation toward righteousness.
Let's continue to seek the Lord in prayer, with thanksgiving, during this critical time. 	Pray for revival among our elected officials — that they would fully surrender their lives to the Lord, seeking His will and wisdom in every aspect of their daily work.
Now, more than ever, we must remember to put our trust in the Almighty!  We say it together, again and again, “In God We Trust!”  But do we really believe?  One thing is for sure — God alone is the same yesterday, today, and forever!
