Michael Cohen controlled which reporters got interviews with Trump in the 2012-2015 period. And it was a torturous process of getting yes, then no, then maybe then no then yes. He sure seemed to like the power to control access.

@charliekirk11 The problem is that liberals are leaving blue states to go to states with good jobs and low taxes -- Texas, Florida, etc -- but they are still voting Dem. It's why Texas is going to go blue sooner than people realize. Then the companies will move again to pro biz states.

@TWillardAuthor I assume someone from Mexico got online and did a whole number in pesos which somehow got into my account as an ATM withdraw for the $`12 plus @WellsFargo $5 fees.
@thesonx @FNC_Ladies_Rule I assume some kind of peso since the scammer is in Mexico. But zero chance the reason was a fake card at an ATM. This was online fraud and the @WellsFargo security department wont admit fault.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @thesonx Oh the @WellsFargo fee for it was $5 !
@AndyBraack I think the banks jsut make up that excuse and it's simply online fraud.

@random_shit_2 @FNC_Ladies_Rule ha! I never even thought of that point-- where is the Wells Fargo ATM in MEXICO? I don't know why they don't just admit they have online fraud.
BTW, @WellsFargo -- which cannot secure its own website -- charged me $5 fee for using a non Wells Fargo ATM -- the one I supposedly flew to in Mexico last week.
And Wells Fargo claims this supposed Mexican ATM criminal used my pin to get that $12.... but they don't have photos of ATMs in foreign countries. This has to be the stupidest excuse for online bank fraud.
Wells Fargo customer service claims that a "counterfeit card was used at an ATM in Mexico". He couldn't explain who is making ATM cards -- on their own -- now that work in bank machine.
Truly,  @WellsFargo could NOT be a more incompetent retail bank. 	No, I did not take out $12 from an ATM in Mexico last week. 	But sure, leave me on hold for 20 minutes, then tell me you shut down my ATM and debit card without warning.

I know you‚Äôre being mean but I started working behind the scenes in tv news in college when I was 21. Worked at network NBC and ABC Ness. Experience matters. (But being ON TV later in my career was when I got to use those skills.) https://t.co/ty242OfPFh
2.  The other TV tip reason Chuck and Nancy seemed weird to viewers is they were both reading along the TelePrompTer as the other spoke. They weren‚Äôt reacting to the other‚Äôs message. Thus the dead in the eyes appearance.
I‚Äôm sure Chuck and Nancy have been on TV as much as I have. How do they not know to look at the speaker ?
@farhip And like 1 out of 1000 Americans know what they are even talking about in their insular battles.

TV tip for Schumer and Pelosi - When on a two shot, look at the person talking, not at the camera. Gives impression of hostage tape.
Can‚Äôt stop staring at silent Schumer. Is he grinding his teeth or chewing gum?

‚Äú... The First Amendment is all about what John Stuart Mill said, that the best cure for bad speech is more speech, not censorship. Don‚Äôt silence them, but speak out against them and what they're saying, and why it's wrong.‚Äù -@tedcruz
‚ÄúBut I will readily defend the rights of anybody to speak out in protest. Even those I disagree with...‚Äù
‚ÄúThe NFL as a whole is selling a product and selling a sport. And I think the NFL would be well advised not to tell half of their fans to go jump in a lake. That's not good for NFL football....‚Äù
And @tedcruz answered: ‚ÄúOf course they have a right to speak, but the First Amendment doesn't mean when you speak, you're immune from criticism. They have a right to say whatever they like, but NFL viewers have a right to turn their television off and not watch it..‚Äù
MORE: Last Saturday in Corpus, @JohnnieMo asked @tedcruz this:  	Two weeks ago in Austin, you gave a very spirited defense of 1st Amen, that was related to Alex Jones, but the NFL players, not so much spirit. Do they have a 1A right to do what they're doing?

Problem with this is that the biggest fundraiser of Dem campaign funds in 2017 was Elizabeth Warren. The far left is ENERGIZED to bring down Trump. If conservatives don't start donating and GOTV, Ds will win this election. And POTUS is limited if he has no GOP congress. https://t.co/pX35kloCiN

@SudoSapien ha! learn how twitter works. Look at her original tweet to me - it's on her timeline, not hard to find. I have never once tweeted to her or followed her.
@GunOwner2 I'd like to see someone uncover those financials. They are very sneaky how they do it. And yes she has an army of people doing nothing but tweeting. What a waste of life.
#YouAreWinningWhen you're publicly attacked for defending the Bill of Rights and the U.S. Constitution.
That's right. Any reporter knows the "notes" section in a police report is very short. Cops work long days and have to do paperwork at the end. A robbery is not going to go to court, so no need for long statement. https://t.co/qcKZjn8l08

My goal is to be chairman of Ways and Means in the majority for tax reform. The other members mumbled in some confusion. I thought at the time, Ryan is really here to get his policy priorities accomplished.....
They didn't see me in the back because I'm so small. One of the older members asked Ryan, why aren't you running for leadership? I'd think you want it. Ryan, who was on the budget committee at the time, said...

Here's an opportunity for prevention -- "Over three-quarters made concerning communications and/or elicited concern from others prior to carrying	out their attacks."
Important -- of the mass shootings in 2017,"over half had histories of criminal charges, mental health symptoms, and/or illicit substance use or abuse." 	And ALL has "at least one significant stressor within the last five years.
I've said this before, but parents and teachers should soothe and comfort kids by saying mass shootings in schools are extremely rare and unlikely. In 2017, there were 4 total - two elementary schools, one high school, and one university.
The report shows that 2017 was a much more deadly year than usual for mass shooting with 147 killed in 28 incidents. https://t.co/FnIXxFgG6e

Sen. Dianne Feinstein says that an average of 38 people per year have been killed by ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù since her ban ended 14 years ago, per  nonpartisan congressional research service. 3/3
The reason they don‚Äôt cite crime data is a) law enforcement police/sheriff and FBI don‚Äôt track homicide by the cosmetic features of a gun - aka ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù. 2/
Pay attention to the people calling for another ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù ban.  You‚Äôll notice they never cite data on how many people are killed per year since ban expired. 1/
@LeylaRose__ @YesYoureRacist @KFILE Law enforcement looks for motive for prosecutors... also if he later claims mental defect and can't stand trial
@KathHL I think that on the other end when I drag it inside at home.
An 18 year old was shot and killed today in DC and a juvenile teenager was shot and is in hospital.  	Haven't seen any coverage by national media on all too common inner city youths killed. https://t.co/W0hki4z25v

@YesYoureRacist @KFILE You need to address that to the person who wrote it - the shooter
@actual_werewolf @KFILE Why ?
I'll go out on a shorter limb and say that reading the exact words written by the school shooter, it gives clues to the cause of his severe mental illness that made him to be that angry, depressed, cruel and evil. https://t.co/xhaYKS9hWA
@KFILE Apparently your CNN followers believe that my armchair psychoanalysis of one cause for the extreme anger of mentally ill mass murderer is anti Semitic. To be clear, I cited the shooter words.

@kd_carlson Not enough has changed for an updated version. Same laws. Same crime trends. Same firearms. But @Regnery has final say :)

Fact: Automatic rifles are highly regulated by the ATF.  Not one has been used in a homicide since the mid 1980s. https://t.co/rJT3OyPqZX

It's not the type of gun. The common thread in all these mass shootings is a dangerously mental ill, angry, evil men who is determined to kill a lot of people. The question is only: Why? https://t.co/zv9OLVY2hy
Piers, Be specific - what new gun law would have stopped this murderous psychopath? https://t.co/tyzYrC6JB9

I tell my Dad this all the time! He's 75 and still working, but of course gets Social Security and Medicare and does not think anything should change. I say it's selfish of seniors not to care about any other generation after them. We debate with love :) https://t.co/OgYk9UZF6e
@MarnyBMe Yes and I should be a millionaire for how hard I've worked, but when the money isn't there, it isn't there. It's just putting more and more on a virtual credit card.
That's idealistic. There is no money for Social Security or Medicare. It is the No. 1 driver of our debt. It's not sustainable. Seniors will have to retire later than 65 and wealthy ones can't get it to keep it functional. https://t.co/oBHUiU6Avs
@kristinaschulma He likes petite blondes
@CorinneOly Was she not wearing makeup or did she cry it off earlier?
@kristinaschulma I don't see it. They never have a convo or make jokes.
Common misconception. 	The money the feds take from our paychecks for Medicare and Social security goes to current retirees. It‚Äôs not enough so we borrow from overseas - China etc to pay the rest. It was never saved for you. https://t.co/xNdDp5NQiR
Reality - Social security is a Ponzi scheme. All the money you pay in while working goes straight to retirees. Once the baby boomers hit and people lived longer, it is all paid from debt. https://t.co/dSmV1mswZb

I did this story on FBI Deputy Director McCabe in Oct. 2016 https://t.co/G3P5OiRCo2 Remember Hillary Clinton's buddy Terry McAuliffe met with McCabe and his wife, then transferred $675,000 to McCabe wife campaign. All the while, McCabe is investigation HRC email allegations.
@yashar It's never been about the food. It's see and be seen. Has been forever.
I knew there were more victims. Sexual predators don't stop until they are out of power. 	Hilary Clinton overrode her top aides and kept Burns Snider on staff while he continued to sexually assault women who worked for him. https://t.co/MAaorosd1t

Here's the twitter account for Burns Strider, Hillary Clinton's personal spiritual advisor üôÑ, who has repeatedly sexually harassed women on her campaign and allied groups, per @nytimes. His timeline... https://t.co/zidkRZ10uB
PS - Why did you continue to use a known sexual harasser who targets vulnerable women as your personal spiritual advisor for five more years? 	Did you know he was continuing to sexually harass other women lower than him at work?	#metoo https://t.co/FtSQzK06Pn
Then why did you hurt HER career by making her change jobs, while you put the man who sexually harassed her stay in his job? 	Did you ever worry he would do it to the other women in your campaign ? 	#metoo https://t.co/FtSQzK06Pn

Misconception in Christianity on judgement. There are absolutes of right and wrong.  Sexually harassing women in the workplace is wrong. 	Hillary Clinton should not be getting her spiritual guidance from that man. https://t.co/ELE47dftSw
@pedsscrub @WSJ 100 women and being forced to have sex with him is not believable??
Agree. The RNC should force out Steve Wynn. The @WSJ is sickening. No woman can be alone with that man. https://t.co/go4t6zClDa
Yep. Hillary Clinton has spent her entire life attacking the women who her husband sexually harassed and worse. As a boss herself, she clearly didn't care about vulnerable women in the workplace. #MeToo https://t.co/SdvHONgYwk
Hillary Clinton is responsible for every women who was sexually harassed on her campaigns or supporting groups. 	Any employer who let men stay in their jobs who have sexuallyharassed or assaulted are handing new victims to the predators. 	#MeToo
Hillary Clinton then ENABLES the sexual harasser. (Sound familar, Bill? )		Strider was hired 5 years later to run a group supporting HRC campaign (founded by David Brock) then fired for sexually harassing MORE WOMEN.  		@nytimes https://t.co/5yxJbmu7VW
The sexual harasser on Hillary Clinton campaign, named Burns Strider, is her "faith advisor" and "sent the candidate scripture readings every morning for months during the campaign." per @maggieNYT 		And it was all kept secret by the Clinton machine.
Hillary Clinton forced a woman who was sexual harassed on her campaign by a superior TO MOVE TO ANOTHER JOB. 	Hillary let the harasser STAY IN HIS JOB.		#FlashbackFriday - Pes. Bill Clinton kept his job, while Monica Lewinsky lost her White House internship. https://t.co/fqTShXRJIZ

Has anyone who's freaking out that Pres. Trump called Haiti a s--hole country ever been there? I have, and it's the poorest, most desperate place I've ever been. U.S. tries helping (as do other Latin American countries), and it's still awful living standards.

@notjustahooker @WreathsAcross @ArlingtonNatl It's interesting volunteer turnout went up so much this year around the country. Perhaps power of social media ?
@JaniceDean Oh Janice it's just heartbreaking in Section 60, where we go, because of the young men and the young grieving families. Makes me cry just walking the rows and looking at the dates and awards. Look at these. https://t.co/eMH8ey3Az7

Hey @Acosta This is terrible reporting. You're citing another news source @voxdotcom (so not first hand info) and they are making this map based on an organization that "counts" mass shootings from NEWS REPORTS. 	How about your call the FBI for your info? https://t.co/MkEG5DKite

Now that I personally know many of Halperin victims, this first-hand account of OTHER men @ABC makes as realize the network was pimping out its smart, young, ambitious women for its powerful stars. Why are @RobertIger and @jamesgoldston silent ? #metoo
This made me cry for all of us who have suffered and thought we were the only ones. -&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not Just the Matt Lauers and the Mark Halperins. The media‚Äôs testosterone-fueled culture is driving talented and dedicated women out of journalism.‚Äù https://t.co/Lac7nE9s9Q

She literally spread fake news (aka lies) - as a supposed legit reporter -- about a PIE. She is not respected by her peers nor deserves to be in the People's House to celebrate Christmas. Actions have consequences. https://t.co/EqbGgO9amp
Your first amendment right to stand up for men who are accused by multiple women of criminal sexual assault. God will judge you. https://t.co/2440LbcoNz
@Georgiapinecone I'm so sorry. I hate it in my soul to hear of other women suffering. Together #nomore
