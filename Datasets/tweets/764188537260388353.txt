@Pufferaground @TrueFactsStated There is something deeply wrong with a man that harbors so much insecurity that he can't even be around women and can't stand the idea of people just loving who they want to love.
@uncbears83 @KimberleyMadig2 @WaysandMeansGOP @RepKevinBrady By the way, nothing is 'free'...we all pay for healthcare already in the form of lower wages, high insurance premiums, and out of pocket expenses....medicare for all simply streamlines this and cuts out administrative costs that bog down the system.
@uncbears83 @KimberleyMadig2 @WaysandMeansGOP @RepKevinBrady This would not only free up 500 billion dollars, but it would free businesses from the burden of dealing with healthcare plans which would save them money as well.  They would use that money to increase wages for their employees which would drive additional economic growth.
@uncbears83 @KimberleyMadig2 @WaysandMeansGOP @RepKevinBrady you don't need to under-fund it.  Private insurance companies spend between 12-18% of their revenue on administration costs whereas Medicare spends 2%.  500 Billion dollars in savings can go a really long way.
@TrueFactsStated mike pence is a deviant.  there's some deep, dark, things in his closet and seeing him in any position of power in modern times is alarming.

@TheCloudWalker2 @BenShapQuotes @benshapiro free college is floated among some people, but it's hardly mainstream.  to claim that it is mainstream is to really just use it as a scare tactic against over taxation.
@TheCloudWalker2 @BenShapQuotes @benshapiro political representatives are supposed to advocate for those who they represent, if a group of constituents think that a nationalized healthcare insurance program should be expanded to everyone at any age then that representative should fight for that.

@RieneRichard @nprpolitics I understand why you cherry pick information and say these things...but honestly, if you think there won't be indictments for collusion, you're being naive, or you're part of a Russian troll farm.  It makes no difference which is the case
@RieneRichard @nprpolitics hmmm, they picked up the payments, but it was not them that initiated it.   why is that so hard to understand?
@RieneRichard @nprpolitics Google it: 11 CFR 110.20.  Isn't the whole point of an investigation to go through and compile all the proof?  I mean, 17 indictments, 5 guilty pleas surrounding this whole thing and you can see it's headed in 1 direction.

@Marco69165751 @916_Hype @pnehlen An educated workforce is a competitive workforce, worth every penny...economically speaking.
@Marco69165751 @pnehlen no, a lack of demand leads to unemployment.  what drives demand?  people spending money...where do people get money?  wages.
@916_Hype @Marco69165751 @pnehlen This is what seems to be difficult for people like @Marco69165751 to understand...you don't fit their boogeyman archetype so they ignore you
@Marco69165751 @pnehlen are you making a case for a higher minimum wage, or a case to pursue business who pay less than minimum wage?
@Marco69165751 @pnehlen that's incorrect.

@jgdeporre1 @pnehlen @realDonaldTrump You don't seem to have a grasp on any version of economics.  I think it would be helpful to get out of the bubble.
@Marco69165751 @pnehlen our economy depends on immigration, and our constitution ensures we aren't unfairly discriminating.  you're not seeing the bigger picture.
