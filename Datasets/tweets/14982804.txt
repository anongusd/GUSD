@hollandszarrier All the looks when I served on the Cannes jury last year. He did such a nice job pushing me to try some new colors and things to wear while knowing I’m super conservative and don’t like to try new colors and things to wear. I’m really bad at clothes. https://t.co/es1GMIIYec
@Aziamack I listen to it if I feel it’s coming from a true place, a trusted place. I treat it as information that I try to process ad best I can in the moment. Sometimes that means accepting it. Sometimes that means just noting it and staying on your own road. https://t.co/4aqFgSPgxN

@JackieTalkNerdy Sure. I’m still in the vault. He was a true genius and there is sooooo much to look at and listen to to even BEGIN to TRY to understand a FRACTION of who he was. Truly remarkable. Honored to work on this story. Every day working on this is a joy. https://t.co/2HXRgnXc4b

@TheMBrand I love those little asides too! Janky Peter Parker has some zingers.
@AdamForce_1 @pramsey342 That wasn’t my cry part. Although it was damn good. Mine was: “You’re the best of us, Miles. You’re on your way. Just keep going.” I can’t. https://t.co/2jMNSEXeHg
@pramsey342 They did. From my 85 year old Grandmother who hails from South Central LA. To my 13 year old niece visiting from Alabama. And everyone in between. We laughed. Cried. Cheered. And had wonderful discussions afterward. Perfect.
@rodneyrothman @chrizmillr @pramsey342 Love me some Peter Ramsey. He’s brilliant. And important. And cool. And kind. And one of the best of us all.
@philiplord One of many that I LOOOOVE. That are so cool. That say so much with both cultural specificity and universal humor/meaning. Good job to the whole dope team. You did the damn thing!
Saw #SpiderVerse for the second time last night. Took the whole family. This time in 3D. First of all, ticket prices are scandalous. I mean, nuts. Second, saw so much more! Favorite line of the moment: “Why do I get stuck with janky, old broke hobo Spider-Man?” I love this movie. https://t.co/qOIrkt6HK8
@naepperson I’ve been speaking exclusively to my family for three days. I can see how it doesn’t make sense to outside upon a quick read. Let me be clearer. We know who he is. We are trying to figure out a good scene on a series I make for one of his songs. #translation

Clarity is my favorite word. It cuts through so much. Just say what you mean. And expect others to do the same. Also be prepared when they do. Don’t ask for clarity if you aren’t prepared to really hear things without special sauce. Not always easy. https://t.co/7OKc7Ovb2O

@rakdaddy When she comes out in that blond wig + sequined dress that gets caught in the shredder. The office scenes w/ that great cast (Carol Kane). The telephone booth scene. Lady Sarah from the Sinai ‘82. When Jack comes to find her at the end and it’s Jonathan Pryce. Penny did that.
@WicalBNE Literally, just laughed thinking about it. First, radical to have a black Woman already have the tape in her collection. We’re often relegated on film to liking just one kind of music. Then, when she’s dancing/vibing to the song while trying to decipher Jagger? Ha! Classic!

Despite being the only American film to screen at Critics Week at Cannes in 1973, Bill Gunn’s GANJA AND HESS was largely dismissed by most white American critics and lumped into the category of blaxploitation films. They didn’t get it. Couldn’t get. Didn’t want to get it. https://t.co/cVTKgxqMxA

Last was a white woman with an accent from somewhere far away. Early 40s. She said I’m sorry to disturb you on a day like this. I said something I’ve never said to a stranger. I said: I want to cry. She looked back at me and said: “Me too.” Our eyes both welled up. And we did.
The second person was Latina. I’m walking through the terminal. She was young. Early 20s. She just walked right in front of me. And stopped. With tears in her eyes. All I could do was hug her and try to hold in my own. She just whispered thank you. I thanked her too. We parted.
Both reaching for our bags in the overhead he said: “I’m not usually this guy, but please keep doing what you do. We need to hear voices like yours. And I need to listen.” I could feel his heart. Grappling with the moment in his own skin. We spoke for a bit and then deplaned.
I’ve been on a plane all morning. Just landed. Trying to make it home. Feel like I want to scream. And rage. And cry. I usually slip in and out of airports easily. Today, 3 different people come up to me - and gave me fuel. This just happened. First was a white man. Early 30s...

All this to say, I wish more folks knew his name. It’s F. GARY GRAY! The F is for Fantastic. Yep, his parents named him Fantastic Gary Gray. Or maybe Fabulous Gary Gray. One of those, I’m sure. He’s a little self conscious about it. Understandable. This ends my rant. Bye Felicia. https://t.co/8N1mV9uluf
Now he’s directing MEN IN BLACK’s  spinoff with Chris Hemsworth and the Queen Tessa Thompson. I mean, he’s such a boss. https://t.co/pEw101E1Q1
Last year, F. Gary Gray crossed a big threshold by becoming the first black director to have a film earn more than $1 billion worldwide with “The Fate of the Furious.” It was the 8th film in the Fast franchise. He did his thing and collected his check! Go, Gary! https://t.co/M2aW19f6Cu
Between 2009-2015, there’s nothing on his IMDB. One day if I’m able, I’m gonna ask him what was happening there. He may say, “I’m badass and I wanted a break.” Or something else. But in 2015, he dropped mics and bombs and erthang with what I consider the best film of that year... https://t.co/ZY7d6u6upl
He kept going and made successful mainstream movies with big stars like THE NEGOTIATOR with Samuel L. Jackson, A MAN APART with Vin Diesel and ITALIAN JOB with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and LAW ABIDING CITIZEN with Jamie Foxx and Viola Davis. Dude is dope. https://t.co/DbjnqbxmeV
F. Gary Gray made a lot of your favorite throwback music videos too. For everybody from Whitney Houston and Babyface to Cypress Hill and Coolio. My favorites would have to be TLC’s “Waterfalls” or Outkast’s “Ms. Jackson.” Yep, both are Gary’s work. https://t.co/USqC7bVvPU
One year later, F. Gary Gray strikes again. In 1996 with SET IT OFF. Y’all. SET IT OFF! I dare you to watch and not feel something. It’s a gem. Latifah. Vivica. Jada. Kimberly Elise. Blair Underwood. Cleo’s last ride at the end with the bullets and bravado?! C’mon, F. GARY GRAY! https://t.co/1VRKZgMPWO
When your first film is a classic that people quote in everyday life two decades later, you’re a real winner. Gary’s first film was FRIDAY. Y’all. FRIDAY! Cube. Tucker. I dare anyone not to laugh watching it. And if you don’t know what “Bye Felicia” means, I’m mad at you forever. https://t.co/935gEgZoAm
A director is fortunate if they make one film that folks remember beyond the year it’s made. Gary has multiple classics. As in more than one. More than two. More than three! And he’s broken a major industry threshold in the process. https://t.co/h2a53Zp03q
Going on a little rant about F. Gary Gray. If the industry was at all fair, he’d be a household name. But it ain’t, so he ain’t. I remember a conversation with a bunch of Academy members who don’t look like us. Had no idea who he was. He was only admitted to the Academy in 2015. https://t.co/YAOdxWTjK8
Now watching STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Deserved so much more than it got from the Powers That Be. Or shall I say The Powers That Used To Be. The direction by F. Gary Gray is beautiful. Libatique murders the shots. Performances are stellar. Got one nod. Problematic. #WhoDecides https://t.co/LEQncBepxd

“Fundamentally, it’s a human rights issue. Prisoners are being treated as animals. Prisons in America are a warzone. Every day prisoners are harmed due to conditions of confinement. For some of us it’s as if we’re already dead, so what do we have to lose?” https://t.co/hXi9p9XOIP

@originalspin @LenaWaithe @kerrywashington @Lin_Manuel Hope we can all support each other. That’s the way it should be. Power in numbers, y’all. Congrats to the whole CRA cast and crew. Onward!
@busboysandpoets We decided to stay close to the hotel because Gramma is on wheels. But look forward to visiting you when I’m back in DC! Your spot is legendary.
@chefedwardlee @ReignOfApril Just seeing this! Hope I can take you up on that offer another time!
We ended up going to Georgia Brown. Thanks for all the recommendations! https://t.co/umDVy0JXBl
I’ve had the honor and pleasure of spending time with Robert Redford as a filmmaker at @SundanceFest and a @SundanceOrg Board Trustee for the past few years. His influence has been foundational to my vision of @ARRAYNow. He truly inspires me. Happy birthday, Bob. And thank you. https://t.co/cj2Meexh6w
If you don’t understand what all the fuss is about for BLACK PANTHER and CRAZY RICH ASIANS and filmed art that centers the uncentered. If you believe you’re a good white person, but you just honestly don’t get it, I invite you to read this gem of a thread by Kimberly Yam. 🌸 https://t.co/DdlLPeu2zb
Celebrating a great actor and a great man on his birthday. You are a legend, @HenryGSanders.

@SoulRebel365 @maxthegirl I failed to add that they want “regular black people food,” but are also most definitely bougie. It’s a lot. https://t.co/OB5jQcHklC
Hi Twitter. Is this thing on? *taps mic* Need restaurant recommendations. For Gramma’s 85th bday. Must seat 8 in Washington DC. Cannot be “fancy food.” As a family member gently put it, “regular black people’s food please, Ava.” 👀 Must have warm vibes. Help me feed these people. https://t.co/HdEaCDbiMO

For those making film outside of the dominant culture, there is no easy road. So when a rose grows through the concrete, appreciate the power and passion that made it so. To my friend @ConstanceWu, all my respect to you, your director, cast and crew. #CrazyRichAsians is in bloom! https://t.co/P6UullKbxH
