@Susan_Hennessey Everything is "appalling" to silly bourgeois bohemians.
@WesleyLowery You're absurd. Just shut the fuck up. Meadows didn't "do a racism" - you sound like a weirdo saying that. Tlaib needs to learn to play with the big boys and not talk like a college freshman. Be better than this.
@BillGertz @AOC Your GND is a shitty high school  term paper and you're calling much more mature, informed people kiddies? Get real.
@eliza_relman Oh no! White men with opinions! We can't allow that.
@NBCNews @NBCOUT Keep pushing that narrative. The girls who lost to the guys aren;t happy about it.
@KatTimpf Yeah, liberal/libertarian social mores have really had a terrific impact on the country over the last 50 years. Keep it coming, we haven't hit rock bottom yet.
@JRubinBlogger She doesn't have it. She's a try-hard phony.
@JRubinBlogger LOL good one rube
@sairasameerarao "home state"
@ParkerMolloy @brianstelter @CNNPR Why would any public figure respond to someone from a troll farm?
@mattdpearce People already have questions about your judgment
@WesleyLowery Santa's a jolly fat white man, you silly self-loather.
@brianstelter @feministabulous By all means cover hoaxing as a trend and pattern. It's important that you've taken the first step. Now devote your show to the topic and ask why so many people seek to demonize other people for persona;/tribal gain.
@gwhatchet Don't change a name because current and prospective students are fragile wenises. Tell them to grow up.
@RepJayapal @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Omar has retweeted 9/11 truthers and RT writers, spreading blatantly false stories about the Covington kids, and pleaded for leniency for ISIS recruits...so she deserves criticism.
@kurteichenwald @JulieBanderas I'm sure you had the same take when hundreds of thousands of deranged, hyper-sensitive liberals made death threats against kids.
@CapehartJ All of your reaction is because you're hypersensitive, easily triggered pussies.
@MZHemingway ELCA has essentially become an LGBT advocacy organization, but LCMS and WELS are great.
@PeterBurnsESPN ACC Basketball tournament
@rtyson82 @yashar @IlhanMN Yeah just let em do whatever, we shouldn't actually hold them to standards or anything.
@NRO @RichLowry Being white and having fun too. Progressives want white guys to be betas who keep their heads down.
@JonahNRO He was an honorable man, but he did act quite wimpy as President. Definitely did well during the war though.
@CBSNews Kid will need lots of psychiatry appointments and drugs when he's older
@MyDaughtersArmy @CBSNews How humiliating for them
@EconoTodd @DavidAFrench These kids are marginalized. Lowly white boys (disfavored group) standing up against a privileged, smug anti-white media and left.
@FrankelJeremy More entitled, privileged, smug? No
@robbysoave @KirstenPowers @washingtonpost The kids are lowly white boys. Smug, powerful white women will do anything to crush them.
@michaeljknowles Yeah, its the kids that really need personal responsibility and not the idiot gang calling them slurs.
@Giliell @Crommunist It's definitely a good thing you don't have a son.
@owillis @RobProvince Oliver, just because these kids are white, doesn't mean they aren't human. The videos showed children having fun and smiling.
@v_solesmith @se4realhinton We heard from the idiot Phillips 3 times, and he blatantly lied all 3 times. The kid got zero screen time. Just admit you despise strong white males. It's easy.
@DonCheadle An aggressive gang of Indians curse at the kids and get in one of their faces, and you call the kids douchey?
@kurteichenwald Back to your tentacle porn now. Lube up!
@AndrewGillum Sore loser lifting up stolen valor. Of course.
@johnpavlovitz Nathan Phillips and his gang of thugs angrily interrupted a Catholic mass and then confronted a bunch of kids and violently cursed at them and told them to go back to Europe. You somehow say he was "lone" and not misbehaving, which is clearly not true. Stop outgrouping white boys
@DavidRutz These people can't be reasoned with and they have no souls.
@NBCNews This guy is ridiculous.
@klcmurphy @NBCNews Your pic is a lot creepier than that.
@rezaaslan Your tribal hatred is insane.
@klcmurphy @NBCNews You should apologize for being a douche to a bunch of kids because of your deep-seated tribal fear. So your a white boy that needs to apologize.
@annamerlan You gaslight the kids and of course used your considerable power to try to ruin their lives. That is power asserts and maintains itself. Now you're the victim and you don't care about the kids.
@annamerlan You're part of a mob doxxing and sending death threats to kids who did nothing wrong. Be a better person.
@thedailybeast Just stop. Can you cover Phillips ridiculous lies? Didn't think so.
@MattHun67472111 @NBCNews @nbc Yeah a meek kid telling his side of the story and being conciliatory with a mendacious adult is just racist propaganda.
@pixiemenace @NBCNews You definitely don't woo any gents. Ugh
@Spacegirl56 @NBCNews Native privilege reared its ugly head when the media bought that idiots lies and never called him out for them. And the man got into the kids personal space. If you don't know that, then you don't  know anything.
@AnnPeace05 @NBCNews Yeah, he needs help. Not the million liberal psychopaths who were traumatized by a smirk and flew into a days long blind rage.
@klcmurphy @NBCNews White boys don't need to apologize because you say so. And it's weird that you can't move on from a kids smile.
@Mrsjagray @NBCNews Omg you're freaking out about a kids lip placement! Jesus, you people mock yourselves.
@Mattie491234k @TODAYshow Kinda creepy. Not surprising for an anti-child activist.
@JLGlazer @NBCNews @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie Oh no, what will they do without your viewership? They don't need a child-hating idiot watching anyway.
@illaim @MaxBoot Oh but claiming white privilege isn't reductive. And it;s completely accurate.
@ksader @MaxBoot Gang of Indians angrily interrupts Catholic mass, then proceeds to target a group of friendly kids while shouting slurs at them.
@ccallowheusser @MaxBoot In your deranged mind, everything is white privilege. Creepy old man confronts a friendly group of kids....somehow white privilege.
@MomsThoughts @MaxBoot White female privilege is calling white men privileged to subsume your own privilege. Do better.
@illaim @MaxBoot POC projection: Considering everything a white person says or does that you don't like to be privilege.
@NBCNews @TODAYshow Then all the crazy liberals would have been spared the trauma of seeing a white boy stand his ground against a hostile old man.
@dianamswancutt @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie Phillips is a horrible liar who approached kids with a gang of thugs. Phillips should apologize to them.
@TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie He's a proven liar who tells bizarre stories and you keep having him back?
@IamCaptainAmer1 @phuck_hsu @TODAYshow Every single second. You're the one driving a mob towards children, grow up.
@Mattie491234k @TODAYshow I'm a super brilliant and handsome bot. And I'm not a terrible person like Phillips.
@IngrahamAngle No one's brought it up on TV yet. She definitely needs to be held accountable for her hate.
@DesireeResists @TODAYshow @NBCNews Phillips is the fragile one. And your femininity doesn't look so hot.
@Hackett_Graham1 @TODAYshow @NBCNews The 64 year old man should've been the bigger person. But he's a complete prick.
@PDM2911 @TODAYshow @NBCNews You shouldn't be around boys.Phillips antagonized this kid and lied about everything, but you're blinded by hatred at a kid.
@SamPrice54 @TODAYshow Famous? The media and psychopathic leftists have made him infamous. Over nothing. A smirk.
@phuck_hsu @TODAYshow Learn respect. Unbridled hatred is bad for your soul. Be better.
@CarolineChrisom @TODAYshow White men don't have to walk away because you want them to.
@TODAYshow Really good kid. He didn't lie and was kind to Phillips. Unfortunately, Phillips is a mendacious liar and has been terrible to the kids.
@AOC Yeah "brown women cursing" is a genre I see all the time.
@ambi_mae @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow A blatant liar, who stole valor.
@WordsandGuitar @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow The media's been excusing the psychopathic weirdos like you. 		A nice kid like Nick deserves to have his story heard.
@NBCNews Just admit that you're evil.
@TheRickWilson Rick's never screwed the pooch! #virginal
@TheRickWilson The Dundee for Best Office Helper
@peterjhasson It's pure evil. We need a second civil war.
@BrittPettibone White boys not backing down and not apologizing. Good for the future.
@Crommunist At no point will you think "why am I such a fucking asshole?"
@abbyohlheiser We know this: you're a silly bobo douchebag.
@SymoneDSanders We'll remember your tribal hatred directed at one of our kids. We'll remember.
@LaVaudreuil @thekaptainkevo @Fidelity Good for you silly little white girl. It is an international company and being a VP is a local investment advisor job, but good for you for signalling your hatred!
@KylaKreemer You're creepy af.
@thekaptainkevo We'll find you
@lisa_dubbert @jjbarnhart @SymoneDSanders White men don't have to back down because you want then too
@_celia_bedelia_ @DavidAFrench Your parents should be holding your hand and gently teaching you not to hate children because of their race and gender. You can do better. Celia
@jjmacnab Hey dipshit, shouldn't you be studied for your own extremism rather than teaching it. I can't believe anyone lets you around young people.
@TheRevAl She's completely clueless.
@ShaneGoldmacher @AOC She'll act just like Louie Gohmert
@BrianneKNadeau White guy here. Appreciate the free fares.
@rezaaslan This is what a beta male looks like!
@rezaaslan We need to talk about toxic beta males. You're patient zero.
@thehill He should be handcuffs when he meets them.
@susiemcdonnell @CBSNews Every time he spoke he lied and changed his story.
@NYTHealth Toxic leftism and toxic femininity need writeups too. I'm not sure how you can leave those out after the Covington hoax.
@radleybalko @lizzywol They're 3 point signs, not white privilege signs you dumbass! And they were doing a blackout, they have blueouts and whiteouts too.
@radleybalko It seems like you have problems. You need psychiatric help.
@johnpavlovitz @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow No, it's you that should be feeling the shame. And a golf club in the nuts.
@emilylhauser White feminists are monsters. Check your very real privilege.
@MaxKennerly Max is a toxic beta male.
@MaxKennerly Do you lie in court like you lie about innocent children. You should be disbarred for inciting harrassment against kids.
@IlhanMN You're linking to an actual fake news racist website and slandering kids. You're a disgrace to humanity. Just go away.
@cereal_twit @IlhanMN White privilege is a Muslim congresswoman seriously libeling you!
@IlhanMN Stop cyber-bullying children. You have to be a grown-up now.
@PatriciaJowers1 @chrislhayes A very handsome bot
@jeremymbarr You can't be serious. Famous liberals are doxxing and trying to destroy children and you think this matters.
@brianbeutler Nah. But feminists all marry trembling beta males.
@abbyohlheiser You should've written a reasonable piece then. This is absurd.
@LauraJoy70 @rtraister You shouldn't be a mother to a white boy. It's clear that his well-being doesn't matter more than literally everybody elses...its just your fevered imagination.
@rtraister Well their lives are being ruined by psychopathic leftists, like you, for grinning while white. I guess feminists just can't muster any empathy for kids, if they're white and male of course.
@jbouie That broad skepticism (hatred really) was directed at the kids by so many on the left. I hope you can see that side.
@erichdelang @chrislhayes @conor64 @runningfool75 @constans You're the asshole. They're good kids. Where was Nathan Phillips chaperone?
@jeffjarvis @jpodhoretz @neontaster Jeff Jarvis groped a black boy once to prove he isn't racist.
@SymoneDSanders You're a monster. Check your privilege and let this downtrodden young man speak his truth.
@jeffjarvis How can you be so brainwashed? I mean, you're an  old, decrepit man. You should've wised up by now?
@farhip @abbyohlheiser You are propaganda. You're evil.
@thedailybeast Cover the tens of thousands of adults targeting some kids.
@AdamSerwer Leftist adults around the country are bullying high school kids as we speak. Apparently you don't get the irony.
@guypbenson Everything he's done reflects poorly on it, but he'll never learn. Where are his parents?
@Tweettstr @TODAYshow @NBCNightlyNews @SavannahGuthrie Yes, Phillips certainly should've walked away.
@ChefLindaBoston @TODAYshow @NBCNightlyNews @SavannahGuthrie Can you come up with something original? You sound like an idiot repeating these tired tropes.
@BethBinDC @UThype @lmisitzis @blckburn @SavannahGuthrie Stop being so butthurt over the PR firm. People hire PR firms for PR crises (though I'm sure you'll blame the "whiteness" of it).
@lmisitzis @SavannahGuthrie line is batshit crazy
@alyssahertzig @TODAYshow @NBCNightlyNews @SavannahGuthrie You're so edgy for cussing out a dignified young man. Check your grown-up privilege.
@KristineWinger1 @TODAYshow @NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews @SavannahGuthrie He's already lied too much, viciously slandering kids. He needs to let others speak.
@TODAYshow @NBCNightlyNews @SavannahGuthrie Well said. Good kid that's been attacked by psychopaths.
@NathanLerner You have a creepy face Nate. It triggers me and I want you to leave this space.
@johnpavlovitz Stop cyber-bullying kids you perv. Only Alex Jones harassed Parkland kids. Guess you're just like Alex Jones now.
@johnpavlovitz You shouldn't be in North Carolina. You're completely inauthentic to the state. Go somewhere else with your anti-white hatred "pastor".
@ali They definitely shouldn't speak with that vicious liar.
@kevkeith8 Look at your face! You look like a downie!
@joycemarieh66 @Wolfe321 @therealdrix78 You're a mean bigoted chubby old lady
@soniagupta504 Every white has experienced stupid takes from POC before.
@joshtpm A creep like you shouldn't be working with children.
@WajahatAli Phillips has proven not to be credible. He shouldn't be given any more interviews.
@randomobserver1 @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow @NBCNews I agree that Phillips and the BHI were clearly in the wrong
@mattyglesias The left's toxic stew of racism and incompetence also has consequences. The last few days are proof positive.
@benjaminwittes Same applies to Nathan Phillips
@mehdirhasan And progressives never look at children like Nick Sandmann and say "that could be my son" because he's white
@RogueSNRadvisor @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow He's not considered a trustworthy source on the matter. Spreading total falsehoods has consequences.
@slpng_giants @SavannahGuthrie @lpolgreen @TODAYshow Creepy Giants needs to stay away from children.
@washingtonpost Paul Waldman is a doofus. He manages to get everything wrong.
@SingerLouise @KirstenPowers @joshtpm OMG, a PR firm! For a PR crisis....who would have come up with that. You people are creeps.
@KirstenPowers @joshtpm The idiot wasn't disrespected, even though he deserved to be. How you can support someone as creepy as Phillips is beyond me.
@JoeConchaTV Victim blaming
@michaeljknowles She's completely clueless. Like Holly Flax.

@Rambobiggs @roflinds We need to get this on @TuckerCarlson
@robbysoave You're doing great work. It's clear that some of these people really just hate white men (and boys, unfortunately)
@DavidFutrelle I see you're still a huge douchebag. Will you ever grow up?
@annamerlan You're just a monster. Be better.
@roflinds You're a vicious racist. Feminists need to deal with their open racism problem.
@chrislhayes You could use your platform to criticize the left-wing psychopaths who've gone after these kids.
@chrislhayes I haven't seen the left in cruel psychopath mode this much since Kavanaugh either. This one takes the cake though.
@PeterBurnsESPN Any smirking white man working for a Catholic school. Brian Kelly perhaps.
@soniagupta504 You're insane
@jaketapper EVerything she says is provably a lie

@NBCNews Report on Rashida Tlaib please.
@ProudResister This is what a beta male looks like!
@JordanUhl Diversity and inclusion sucks.
@AOC AOC just recently learned what marginal tax rates were, just like she recently learned what health care premiums are (but the SC said they're taxes, LOL!)
@mayavas @cabot_phillips You're not an authentic Virginian, I'm sure. Most likely a johnny-come-lately transplant from a shitty blue state.
@ChancellorFolt Inauthentic, transplant NC is beating the authentic NC. Hopefully the legislature, which is largely authentic, can rein in the idiots.
@ChancellorFolt You're betrayal won't be forgotten.
@BillKristol You realize Mitch doesn't actually tweet himself, right? Like most normal men his/your age.
@EmmBeeDee @AOC Tweeting is so brave
Neither one is remotely likable
@BillKristol He's the token Republican beta male now that Flake is gone
@SohrabAhmari "deeply offended"
@Evan_McMullin Don't be such a doofus.
@davidfrum They didn't cut the capital gains rate genius.
@MJGerson Shut up doofus
@SenMikeLee @realDonaldTrump It does nothing to make "communities safer". In fact, it probably does the opposite. Thanks for nothing.
@NateSilver538 @benshapiro Sleeping Giants are absolute fascists. They need to be dealt with.
@bethanyshondark Never pegged Harry as a beta male....until I read this.
@mattgaetz Good one Gaetz
@JuddLegum You have the most pathetic life. Just a professional troll for a shitty salary. Tucker is much richer and cooler than your doofus ass.
@RashidaTlaib Her own country and parents failed her. 		Please stop bashing my country. We don't need newcomers like you bringing us down.
@SenTedCruz @SenTomCotton Can you stop shilling for Israel and build a wall on our damn border?
@GregAbbott_TX Who cares about Israel? Only doofus neocons. Not real conservatives.

@juliehdavis Schumer's outburst was much worse.
@JRubinBlogger You're such a doofus Rubin
@brianstelter @KirstenPowers There are 22 million illegal aliens in the US and you're saying it's  manufactured crisis? Idiot.
@SykesCharlie Good on Ann for calling out racism in the Democratic Party. We need more like her, instead of trembling betas like Charlie Sykes.
@NateSilver538 She’s really far left, obnoxious and stupid.
@kylegriffin1 @yashar @KenDilanianNBC Ken Dilanian is not an objective reporter. Not even close.
@Ocasio2018 There's nothing 'courageous' about what youre doing.
@paulkrugman Mass transit is for losers. So is walking.
@paulkrugman It's beautiful and glorious.
@RealSaavedra Kid Rock was right
@paulkrugman No one spends that much time deconstructing her. They just point out that she's a complete idiot, which is undoubtedly true.
@JohnJHarwood Bill Clinton first
@oliverdarcy Buzzfeed doesn't do a lot of great journalism
@MaxBoot @charlescwcooke @NRO @JonahNRO This reads exactly like a Trump tweet. Random call-out and all.
@brianstelter @WeAreSinclair @BorisEP Are you proud of your garbage station? Sinclair is much better than CNN, and it's not close.
@bethreinhard He obviously thought his life was ruined when he said those words. Thankfully, things have gone back to normal for him. Ford can probably go back to work, she'es just milking this for her gofundme.
@JuddLegum Liberals whining that they don't control every single information outlet ITT
Is he drunk https://t.co/24zBpiuAup
@Donald_from_HI @JohnJHarwood @johnjharwood would never, ever interview a liberal public figure in the manner that Henry interviewed Pruitt. Even if the liberal was "mortally wounded", Harwood wouldn't have the stones to attack a lib. Harwood is trash.
@ScottHech @playmobil Pussy
@JohnJHarwood FOX is ten times better at journalism than John Harwood is. Do you remember Ed Henry's interview where he crushed Pruitt? Henry is also a Fox and Friends cohost.
@seanmdav Sean, the neocucks somehow don't realize that we're fighting against extreme left-wing corporations that despise conservatives. The neocucks keep saying "we need to persuade them to do better, not nationalize them" as if persuading them would ever work. It won't.
@JohnJHarwood John Harwood calling someone else loony is rich. And you and your network do continuously treat conservatives unfairly.
@MaxBoot You are blinded by tribal loyalty. To the cosmopolitan set. You were never part of the conservative tribe, but you didn't realize it until recently.
@Ocasio2018 Ocasio is the descendant of brutal colonizers!
@MaxBoot He's not an American hero
@marcorubio Did McRaven ever see combat? Sounds like he was one of those political generals that troops secretly hate.
@jonkay Who cares if he's Asian? You're playing the left's game - pretending like people of certain races have more moral value.
@MaxBoot @RepSwalwell "courageous"
@MaxBoot Trump isn't responsible for any US war dead who died in pointless wars. Max Boot, on the other hand, is very much to blame for those dead.
@SRuhle The people that cross the southern border are almost always economic migrants, they aren't running from governments who are trying to kill them (a few may be targeted by drug cartels).		You just make random shit up and say it to a million people. Do better.
@ChrisMurphyCT Check out the video of vote boxes being dropped off a truck into personal vehicles. Nothing to see here!
@cvpayne Charles with the knockout punch
@TheRickWilson He's not a mouthbreather like Rick Wilson
@nikki_deleon @JRubinBlogger @CNNPR @brianstelter @Acosta @PressSec @realDonaldTrump His loss of access is due to his disruptive behavior. The argument that it's content discrimination would fall flat in most courts.
@pbump Why don't you check out the video from Broward County of boxes of ballots being put into personal cars? I'm sure those ballots were counted fairly.
@GregAbbott_TX Blue state transplants usually bring their terrible voting habits with them, despite fleeing high taxes and high COL.
@JohnJHarwood You're a clown and a pathetic left-wing activist, Harwood.
@politicalelle Their sanctimony and condescension is revolting. I think they know they're being trolls, but vote shaming white women gets a lot of twitter likes so they do it to feed their egos.
@kevincorke Yeah, its not normal. Especially worried about Broward considering the elections supervisor has illegally destroyed ballots in the past.
@juliehdavis @Acosta CNN could just send someone who isn't a disruptive buffoon...and we'd still be completely different from countries with  no free press.
@JoeNBC Kemp won fair and square. Don't be so butthurt that your Democrats couldn't win.
@TheRickWilson @TuckerCarlson is the best political commentator of our generation and you, Rick, are a two bit hack that no one hires for anything.
@shaunking @staceyabrams Not a chance. The bogus charges of voter suppression may have pushed down Kemp's total though.
@jonfavs Yeah, Republicans are devastated about losing all those seats in NH, CT, and Maine after 2020. Good one, big guy.
@MaxBoot Shut up doofus
@GlennThrush Obama certainly did.
@SteveKerr The Golden State Notwarriors have no combat vets on the team. Name should be changed to Golden State Goobers.
@GlennThrush No it isn't Glenn. Acosta grandstands and preens. He deserved to have his creds pulled.		You need to stop being so left-wing. Do better. I believe you can change.
@MaxBoot Tucker is America's finest political commentator. His biting insight holds elites to account and shows the stupidity of our immigration system. Max Boot is a goofy mouthbreather that writes the same column over and over again.
@JRubinBlogger @CNNPR @brianstelter @Acosta @PressSec @realDonaldTrump It most definitely isn't content discrimination. Are you sure you were a lawyer?
@TVietor08 You lost, Tommy. Your terrible candidate couldn't get across the finish line in a big democratic year. And now we have a rad good ol' boy as GA governor!
@Susan_Hennessey @PressSec He hit a woman. Think of the survivor!
@peterbakernyt @PressSec Their female aides fear violence from Acosta. Think of the survivor, and not the perp. You need to learn and grow. I'm sure you can do better.
@Acosta Stop beating women, @Acosta. The survivor of your violence should sue.
@MaxBoot Stop writing the same column over and over again Max. You're a know-nothing anti-Republican.
@rtraister @staceyabrams She should concede gracefully.
@HardballChris @BetoORourke LOL at you saying this is "courage".
@mattyglesias Libs dominate network news, 2 of 3 cable channels, all daytime shows, all late night shows, Hollywood, all awards shows,, all universities, etc. But you're butthurt over Sinclair. You're being disingenuous, but you also really need to check your progressive privilege. Be better.
@Peter_Wehner Because CNN and MSNBC give them such prominent platforms. There are almost zero real conservatives on those channels,but never-Trumpers are on all the time.
@brhodes True. Kemp, DeSantis and Cruz aren't corrupt like @AndrewGillum and they aren't seasoned criminals like Beto.
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions You write the same thing over and over. Don't your Post bosses get tired of the same shit from an anti-Republican know-nothing like you?
@JoeConchaTV The responses are a perfect example of Progressive Fragility.
@KathleenOhyw8 @TPCarney Correct response. @brithume hands down.
@ShannonBream Conservative majority will let it stay. Glad we've got 5 now.
@MJGerson You're a huge beta male. Grow a pair.
@JoeNBC Who cares? Kemp is solid and Abrams is an oddball. Even taking the stage with her brings him down to her level.
@KatTimpf I only care about winning, Kat.
@JoeNBC Hugh was comparing the screamer to Trump's rhetoric, not to the bomb sender's actions. And Hugh could've used any number of Democrat politicians as an example (Waters, Holder, Clinton, Booker) to compare to Trump's rhetoric. Be better, Joe.
@mattyglesias There is a doofus gap in American politics, and you and the rest of the Vox bros are a big reason why it has widened.

@mattyglesias DC doesn't have a lot of those fabled diners, chief.
@dandrezner Zack is an alpha dog. Helluva guy!
@KyleKashuv This kid is great
@GlennThrush Did you even read the story? They CAN vote, they are not *purged*. Do better.
@GlennThrush Kemp didn't purge anyone. Do a little research. And Lee was a good general (and is still a cultural icon in the South). Why are you so obviously left-wing?
@MaxBoot @nikkihaley Too bad there aren't more grown-ups at the Washington Post. Just fragile boys like Max who throw tantrums every day.
@bopinion "Unspeakably cruel"? Do you hear yourselves?
@MaxBoot You're a doofus beta, Max.
@KirstenPowers It's not a comprehensive list, dumbass.
@BuckSexton @bensasse is a weenie, almost as bad as Flake.
@megynkelly Thanks for having guts @megynkelly
@HashtagGriswold Well done
@mattyglesias Ford lied repeatedly as well, changing her story many times. She is non-credible and should not be believed.
@tribelaw No it's not. Stop humiliating yourself on this website. People used to take you seriously.
@CBSNews LOL the anger of the elevator screamers was used on the left’s behalf. How can you possibly overlook this Traister?
@RussellCPPolicy @clairlemon That’s the exact opposite of what the article said. You’re wrong.
@JRubinBlogger @ktumulty @60Minutes @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons I know a WashPost columnist who needs to get her act together too. Do better, Rubin.
@NoahCRothman @politicalmath No one cares if the Democrats complain about a “legitimacy” issue. Just confirm the guy and if he can’t be confirmed, get someone else through by January 3rd.
@aravosis Let’s find someone to accuse John of gang rape. Shouldn’t be too hard.
@markwby @shaunking Uhh it is extremely hard to get into YLS. You do have to work hard to get in. Dumbass.
@HeyTammyBruce They're trying to drive Kavanaugh to suicide. Let's call it the "suicide strategy".
@ClydeHaberman You're a sociopathic monster.
@JenniferWexton Believe the evidence. Do better, Jennifer.
@MittRomney You're such a wimp Mitt. You and Flake are two of a kind.
@gabrielmalor It's just hysterics...probably never happened.
@KimStrassel It's all on Flake. He's a trembling coward.
@LukeRussert He was in diapers. Such a beta male.
@JohnJHarwood Saying John Harwood is a trustworthy person is not a plausible position
@SacBeeEditBoard You're a sociopathic monster
@paulkrugman He lies about everything. Just like Krugman.
@JohnJHarwood Have you ever been honest? You lie more than DJT.
@SenThomTillis @senjudiciary Good job today Thom, you've got my vote.
@alexburnsNYT They leaked it to a guy named Ryan Grim. Not hard to figure out why he got it. They would've preferred Mitch Grim or Donald Grim but Ryan was the best they could do.
@NickRiccardi They leaked it to a guy named Ryan Grim. Not hard to figure out why he got it. They would've preferred Mitch Grim or Donald Grim but Ryan was the best they could do.
@jonathanchait I'll give you the answer: Gorsuch wasn't replacing a swing voter.
@paulkrugman No Paul, Leland Keyser said she didn't go to the party and has never met Brett Kavanaugh. Do better.
@ezraklein LOL shut up doofus
@JRubinBlogger You're a genuinely terrible person Rubin.
@TomCottonAR Thanks Tom, you're one of our best. Try to get the cringing wimp Flake in line!
@yashar "This has been so upsetting"		LOL grow a pair
@jpodhoretz Trent Lott is rad af
@Ocasio2018 Awww, you try so hard!
@neeratanden She's been up there for 7 years or so.
@JRubinBlogger He linked to a poll that proves it. You're the disgrace...a "lifetime" of harrasment? A boycott of LL Bean and a cruise line? You're ridiculous.
@oliverdarcy @brithume Uhh, he's reporting facts from a poll, genius.
@brithume @JRubinBlogger is freaking out rn
@thehill She looks like Holly from The Office and she's just as clueless.
@Acosta Try to be less biased Jim. You can be better.
RT @TuckerCarlson: California is challenging the integrity of the union, not in order to help its citizens, but on the behalf of a foreign…
@nytimes NYTimes calls it "Food Inequality" as if more socialism can fix the problem.
@BretStephensNYT McCain is the most clueless member of the Senate, in either party.
@BuzzFeedNews She's uncongressional
@jameshamblin You definitely need to learn how to interact with girls.
@jaketapper @GwynethPaltrow Jake, he came on to her in a very inappropriate way. She didn't "survive" anything though. Choose better words.
@sammieslaton @chrislhayes @irin @jess_mc Harvey got away with predatory behavior for 30 years! They joked about it at awards shows with 15 million viewers.
Rex Tillerson recently figured out why he got the job in the first place, and now he's trying to wreck the White House.
On the same day that leaks come out of State about moron comments. Fire Tillerson @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/kgKvUO8mY1
@brhodes It doesn't take "courage" to do either.
@SteveScalise Glad you're back Rep

@ACLU Average citizen owes Thomas Jefferson $$$ for setting the US and western world on a path on to freedom.
@ACLU @jeff_robinson56 You're a leftist organization.
@ProFootballTalk You should consult an actual attorney on this. They aren't ignoring any human rights laws.
@RalphNortham Deeply? How NYTimes of you!
@tomperriello @JRubinBlogger @JohnWhitbeck She's not conservative
@seantubbs Good boy!
@tomperriello @EdWGillespie It's that you've changed the definition of white supremacy Twitter Tom. Everyone is on to you.
@YesYoureRacist This message is why @TheDemocrats have been crushed nationwide for a decade. They despise the United States.
@emmaroller BLM advocates for killing of cops and actually does it. Antifa are a loose band of anarchists and communists (many of whom support Kim).
@YesYoureRacist They're right. He did turn his back on them.
@jordo2323 @guypbenson https://t.co/MS3gYsKh8h These are Commies and Anarchists, they support North Korea and Venezuela. Do better.
@CouncilmanMoody Good for you. Keep working.
@HelenGymAtLarge Thanks for helping the GOP in future elections. 62% of all Americans want to keep Rebel statues where they are. Culture war is a loser for D
@MittRomney You should apologize.
@AnnCoulter Baby Bells needs to happen
@ChelseaClinton 62%-37%. Sorry you're on the losing side.
There is no reason to #DefendDurham  No KKK were there
@bncrrll 62-37. Losers
@YesYoureRacist Wow, would you really watch the hell out of it? So edgy brah
@brithume https://t.co/spHbqMgGQe
@brithume Can always count on Brit. Check the embedded poll of Richmonders. 60% want to keep, 20% more keep with a plaque.
@jaketapper https://t.co/spHbqMgGQe  Check results of their own poll too. Media is way off on this.
@jaketapper Both enormously respected in the South as religious gentlemen. Your bias is showing Jake. A real newsman wouldn't take sides.
@Amy_Siskind They probably don't, but they live around D.C. and don't want to piss off all the liberals they see every day. South stands behind statues.
@ABC I'm glad this man has the president's ear.
@TheRickyDavila This is revisionist history at its finest. Ignores Lee's pre-War and post-War contributions. NBC wants blood. They'll come for TJ and GW.
@jaketapper I like that you're all linking a guy you despise when it fits your narrative. NC and VA will be more red after these incidents.
@maggieNYT They're just saying that. And tens of millions of other Southerners don't want them down
@JoyAnnReid Erasing of people's ancestors won't win the Dems votes in any of these places. Cooper will be stomped in 2020.
@YesYoureRacist Guy begging for money to troll twitter. Grow up.
@patrick_hruby Hruby seems like a new American name. No voice for you!
@damon_thayer Would like to see a Historic Preservation Act in KY. Don't let mayors trample history. 73% of voters want Davis in capital.
@katherinemiller They're already coming for W Wilson, T Roosevelt, and others. The Conn Dem party renamed Jefferson-Jackson Dinner for these reasons.
@brithume Brit Hume is a strong guy. Unlike Waltshaub and @SpeakerRyan
@jessebwatters Good work. You get it
@MittRomney The other side opposes every American value that you should care about.
@BarbaraBoxer Both sides did hit each other with bats and maglites
@JoyAnnReid Comparing Allied troops to antifa? False moral equivalency
@tyler_hill23 @HLCityhall Fake Southerner here
@maggieNYT Called him both a terrorist and a murderer and said to convict for either Look, I just teed up a story for you.
@NC_Governor Need a stronger condemnation and call to police to do their jobs. Get on it.
@DurhamPoliceNC Don't go to Durham. Not a safe space
@ClayTravis NCGA will find a way to respond. Durham police might feel some pain.
@JimGrayLexKY I hope the council and military commission aren't as feckless as you are.

@jehorowitz You come off as the biggest doofus I've ever read. Maybe behind Shaun King; it's close.
@jehorowitz @JuddApatow @ReignOfApril Who gives a shit
@jehorowitz It's something we teach children to help them deal with up/dwn relationships. Beta males continue for the rest of their lives though. Sad!
@UT_MAZ @ScottPorch @jbouie It's important that we teach our liberals (you guys) about biology. We need informed people writing in Slate, and atm we don't have that. 2
@UT_MAZ @ScottPorch @jbouie He linked to a number of studies, as well as a number or articles in liberal publications that supported the ideas presented. 1
@ScottPorch @UT_MAZ @jbouie He was correct on the merits. Biologists don't argue about the points he made. Unfortunately, some in the social sciences do.
@jbouie @ScottPorch What he said is true. You call it bigotry, science says it's real.
@jbouie The science backs up what the fired employee wrote in the memo. The left is extremely hostile to science.
@IngrahamAngle @nytimes Tillis doesn't care about nytimes, Trump approval is low in NC so he's hedging his bets.
@Reince45 well done
@JpJanice @CollinRugg @Scaramucci He prances around like an idiot, simply posturing! Sad! Anti-gun, open borders @Scaramucci isn't welcome in the GOP.
@ESPNPR Do you have the ESPN ACC baseball TV schedule? You posted the SEC schedule last month.
