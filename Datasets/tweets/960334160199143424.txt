@tal7291 @GovMarioCuomo #ElectronicVisitVerification is a federal law. Every state must implement #EVV by Jan 2020 or face cuts to federal #Medicaid reimbursement.

Even with high demand &amp;tight supply, wages remain stubbornly low. Between 2007-2017, inflation-adjusted median hourly wages for direct-care workers fell 2% to $11.83 from $12.08. A 40-hour work week at that rate yields an annual income of around $24,600. https://t.co/1VZmkSMmmT
Home health aides earned a median salary of $23,130 in 2017, or about $11.12 per hour, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Roughly one-quarter of home health aides live below the federal poverty line. #StopEVV #EVV @BLS_gov #homecare #Medicaid #poverty

"#EVV is based on false stereotypes that PWDs &amp; seniors are helpless &amp; homebound. EVV was designed to be implemented through a medical model: a one-size-fits-all approach in which individuals are patients &amp; leaves little room for individual consumer choice."
"The @ccd4pwd a coalition representing dozens of disability advocacy groups, sent a letter to @CMSGov urging more stakeholder input &amp; a clear directive to states not to use #GPS tracking or invasive devices equipped w/ cameras, microphones or video." #EVV https://t.co/5qyyun9CPG
DUE: Oct 26	#EVV Feedback	Email: lindsay@ncil.org		1. Has your state implemented or begun to implement EVV?	2. How does EVV work in your state? Share details like #GPS use.	3. Have you been personally affected by EVV? How?

To be clear: This bill still needs to be passed in the Senate and signed by the President. Senate vote coming in July!
@OhioWxGirl States still have the choice to move forward with EVV at an earlier timeline. For those states where it is already implemented, it is unlikely they will cease tracking, but may delay bringing on other Medicaid home care programs so quickly.
House passed H.R. 6042 providing a 1-yr delay on #EVV implementation, reminds states to ensure adequate stakeholder input process followed. We are happy to see this delay pass, and we look forward to working on full repeal of #electronicvisitverification. #StopEVV #CripTheVote
