@KurtSchlichter Lol		Such garbage!
@terib3294 @BuckSexton How about the fact that Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for a hush money payment that was a campaign finance felony?		That is a crime by Donald Trump, one of many. Much of this conduct is in the public record.
@LAFdeplorable @mitchellvii Hi madam. I‚Äôm selling nutritional supplements that will make you even smarter and even more able to discern facts and fiction. I‚Äôll give you a great price too!
@Dem_Raptor @BuckSexton Trump lied to America about Trump Moscow -	the timing and status of those negotiations.  Why lie?		That‚Äôs one of many facts that MAGAts happily ignore.
@mitchellvii Ok. But Trump is a traitor and a criminal. Also a great filter when wackjobs who don‚Äôt care about facts bend the knee.
@BuckSexton Wackjobs on the right twist themselves into pretzels ignoring facts and asserting ones that don‚Äôt exist.  PATHETIC!

@Chuck9828 @johncardillo The U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York.		Documents filed August 18, 2018 detail the crimes Cohen pled guilty to, including ones at the direction of Individual 1.
@WinnDuncan @lilslenarz @johncardillo To say that you must attack the justice dept		Cohen pleaded guilty to a federal campaign finance charge for the payment to Stormy made at the direction of Trump.		A guilty plea and a case filing detailing the conduct ain‚Äôt hearsay. Sorry, it‚Äôs not.  You can think it is though!
@WinnDuncan @johncardillo Wait, who defends trump on the merits?		Who says he isn‚Äôt a criminal based on fact A and evidence B? No. What iiiiiii see is attacking and deflecting.		That kind of behavior is consistent with guilt.
@lilslenarz @WinnDuncan @johncardillo Lol. Okay so what has come out that shows Trump‚Äôs (don‚Äôt forget junior) $35,000 checks aren‚Äôt key evidence of crimes in office?		Let‚Äôs start there.
RT @brianklaas: The press should be objective. If the president repeatedly says things that he knows to be untrue, is repeatedly corrected,‚Ä¶
@lilslenarz @WinnDuncan @johncardillo Not worthy of a response as you both attack the press and deflect to the theoretical crimes of others, instead of defending trump on the merits.		It‚Äôs a losing argument in court even as it wins over the gullible.
@Thor96607567 @WinnDuncan @johncardillo I don‚Äôt know.		But there is plenty of evidence that puts the investigation itself on sound footing
@PreetBharara Why give trump the opening to lie further and say no no...it was an ‚Äúinternal audit‚Äù
@Thor96607567 @WinnDuncan @johncardillo I read sources from all sides. Right, left, center and case filings.		You‚Äôre proving my point when you attack the media instead of finding examples of trump and his lawyers defending...on topic.
@WinnDuncan @johncardillo Perhaps. But here‚Äôs why I say it:		NOBODY defends trump on the merits.		Trump‚Äôs defenders attack the media, justice, deflect to the theoretical crimes of others, rather than defend on the actual substance of the claims against him		People know he‚Äôs criminal. They just don‚Äôt mind.
@Chuck9828 @johncardillo The check for $35,000 signed by Donald Trump while president, to reimburse Michael Cohen for a hush money payment that was adjudicated as a campaign finance crime directed by Individual 1 (Donald Trump)... would seem to be evidence.		This evidence is very damaging to Trump.

Trump is running out of times he can meet with KJU or other dictators to deflect. Nervous for what he‚Äôll try next. https://t.co/8HmcfeHW5c
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit No crime there obviously		It is the purpose of the expense that matters not who paid.		The purpose of Cohen‚Äôs hush payment was to avoid bad info to come out during the campaign. THAT makes it a campaign expense.  That Cohen pays it doesn‚Äôt change that.
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit I think you‚Äôre focused on a technicality.		Say we‚Äôre talking about a burger for a campaign staffer‚Äôs lunch.		There‚Äôs no substantive difference between the burger being paid for with a campaign credit card and the employee paying personally and getting repaid with campaign cash.
@funder üö®
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit Not reporting that payment is a crime		Structuring the payment through Cohen and then repaid over time by lying about the true nature of it (legal retainer or reimbursing the hush money) is a crime.
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit Two separate issues here.		Hush money settlements are LEGAL.  No issue there.		Paying hush money to someone so they don‚Äôt damage a political campaign is considered an ‚Äúin-kind contribution‚Äù because it covers costs meant to win the election.

@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit You‚Äôre right.		But you‚Äôre also wrong.		When the hush money payment is intended to ensure damaging information about a political candidate is not known to the public, that‚Äôs a campaign finance crime.
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit That‚Äôs false.
@SueKonkel @gatewaypundit Compelling.
@VexxedMedia @gatewaypundit Paying hush money to avoid damaging information that will hurt a presidential campaign, and structuring payments to conceal that fact is a campaign finance felony.		You‚Äôre looking at the color blue and telling yourself it‚Äôs orange.
@W0W_WE @mitchellvii @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is quite possible he is under sealed indictment. Absolutely.
@W0W_WE @mitchellvii @POTUS @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs a new one. He doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù a defense. Interesting.
@gatewaypundit Deflecting		While president, Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for a hush money payment that was found by Justice to be a campaign finance felony.		Cohen is going to jail for his this.		That makes Trump a criminal.		If you disagree, are you able to defend without changing the topic?

@JayRothstein12 @DarlaShine Sorry you didn‚Äôt capture my sarcasm. Your point makes NO SENSE AT ALL
@JayRothstein12 @DarlaShine That makes perfect sense.

@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine Best of luck.
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine Full circle - this goes back to the public health comment to start this back and forth.		The effects you highlight, even if true, would suggest you think society is better off with crippled kids with polio, uncontrollable outbreaks of measles (as we see today).
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine Either they do or their obstetrician does, whose guidance and judgment they would follow.		The anti-vaccine crowd (whether correct or not) is decidedly on the fringe:		https://t.co/3if8wdIWxY
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine That aside, how do you reconcile your views (I assume you‚Äôre not a doctor) with two young intelligent doctors with access to the same info that you do, electing to vaccinate their kids?
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine Wait a sec-the study said nothing about infant death.  It talked about long term diseases like MS.		Is Rona also suggesting infants die from vaccinations or is that some other cause?
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine But in hospitals around the country, newborns are routinely vaccinated.		Personal case: my sister in law and her husband (both doctors, internal medicine and derma) had a kid in late December. He is vaccinated.		So I guess I would ask why is Dr. Rona‚Äôs work so ignored?
@Belle_Vivant @DarlaShine Just so I understand, you believe that half of US kids (32 million of them) suffer lifetime health problems attributable to newborn/child vaccinations?
@DavidWohl Pretty sick person ^^^

@DarlaShine One thing that‚Äôs interesting about public health, is that what might be best for a population may run counter to what a particular doctor (note: non conspiracy theorizing) prescribes for an individual.		Public health outcomes improve overall outcomes for society.

@momwantsbalance @thecjpearson Most recently, in the indictment of Roger Stone, the document clearly lays out the connection between trump and Russian intelligence through Wikileaks and Roger Stone.		Release of hacked documents were coordinated to maximize political damage on his opponent.		THAT IS COLLUSION

@Justhere4footb1 Forgive me but I don‚Äôt buy into the premise that something that is racist is one context is somehow school spirit when everyone at a basketball game does the same exact thing.
@Justhere4footb1 Give benefit of the doubt to kids who paint their faces black and taunt black ball players.		Assume worst of med school student who put in yearbook a pic that is patently offensive and racist 30 years after the fact		FWIW I‚Äôm a moderate who is appalled and think he should resign.
@starlasworld @Garrionn_ @jakebonfante @thecjpearson So what you‚Äôre saying is the guys who didn‚Äôt paint their face black have less school spirit than the guys who painted their face black and taunted the black players? https://t.co/QBhToRyrFe
@starlasworld @jakebonfante @thecjpearson He‚Äôs showing school spirit just like the Covington boys last week.		THAT blackface wasn‚Äôt racist but this is?
@steel_toe777 @charliekirk11 A ten year old poorly written blog. Nice.
@steel_toe777 @charliekirk11 Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying:		1) I acknowledge blackface is or at least can be racist.		2) Wearing black face, when everyone is doing it, at a game, is ‚Äúschool spirit‚Äù.  It‚Äôs the culture so it‚Äôs not racist.		Maybe the culture is racist?
@steel_toe777 @charliekirk11 So if it‚Äôs a basketball game and everyone‚Äôs in blackface, that‚Äôs school spirit.  But if it‚Äôs anywhere else it‚Äôs racist. Newsflash: both are racist.
@GOPChairwoman You have the worst job
@GeraltofPDX @Cernovich No I was referring to the style of my (parody) commentary not the individual involved
@D1aneMontana @charliekirk11 It‚Äôs people who suggest that a blastula is a little baby that has rights that brings misguided democrats to take the opposite extreme position.
@D1aneMontana @charliekirk11 That is the mainstream position. Most democrats feel this way.		But right wing crazies on the internet are suggesting that because something is legal it‚Äôs going to happen on Main Street and all day long. That‚Äôs an INSANE position to take. Doctors wouldn‚Äôt do this.
@steel_toe777 @charliekirk11 Oh so when a high school condones blackface (to taunt black basketball players) and everyone does it, it‚Äôs a‚Äôok and tally that one under school spirit. But in this other circumstance, the same act is REAL racism?
@charliekirk11 The same people who last week called it ‚Äúschool spirit‚Äù now push for resignation of governor protecting women‚Äôs reproductive rights.		UNBELIEVABLE		And oh btw...		The president is under 17 active investigations. That we know about.		HAPPY FRIDAY MAGA WACKADOODLES.

@cerno1987 @malavemark @NRA Respectfully, 3 marines who you know who are teachers, is not an argument for arming 5 million (HS and college) teachers across the country.
@Sam_Rohde @malavemark @NRA Meanwhile, your sacred #2A is already restricted. You can‚Äôt but grenades or an F35 or an AK-47.		So there‚Äôs already reasonable (I assume you‚Äôd agree those are reasonable) restrictions on gun ownership.		Do note that the solution isn‚Äôt everyone should have grenades...
@Sam_Rohde @malavemark @NRA Meta analyses consistently show that gun ownership increases the likelihood of injury or death by homocide, suicide and accident.		And that shouldn‚Äôt be surprising.		You might FEEL more safe, and YOU might be more safe...but from a public health standpoint, more death overall.
@Sam_Rohde @malavemark @NRA Why not priests? Why not doctors? Why not pro golfers?		Need to separate the issue of a single person and the nation‚Äôs solution to a problem (mass shootings) only seen at this level, in this country.

@Jedi_Reporter @broham @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier And to be fair, personally, I don‚Äôt consider a border wall to be either immoral or an immorality.
@broham @Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Too easy to hang your hat on ‚Äúlibtards just hate trump‚Äù and ‚Äúyou wanted border security in the past‚Äù		An honest accounting of the situation would recognize if this were REALLY an emergency it would have been done during Republicans complete control of government.
@broham @Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Also, the wall is not being presented by the administration as a part of a larger strategy of border security.		It‚Äôs ‚ÄúWE NEED WALL‚Äù		And to support their point solution to a complex problem, they present lies like 4,000 terrorists caught, when 99.85% were captured at airports.

@realDonaldTrump This doesn‚Äôt make sense
@Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier If you look at Mr. Kolfage‚Äôs past, he has set up GoFundMe‚Äôs and then pocketed some of all of the cash and not done the thing he set out to do.		As a wall funder, you might have an interest in seeing your donation used for a border wall, not to paint the walls on Kolfage‚Äôs house.
@Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Sir, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a racist.		I‚Äôm sure you love this country and everyone who is here legally. As do I.		Tactics on the right like to paint everyone center and left as open border socialists. It‚Äôs not true.		You probably know this already.
@Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Won‚Äôt sting. I‚Äôm indifferent to wall. Wall is fine.		Tired of the bad faith negotiations and drumbeat of lies. You, likely are too.		If this was a real üö® the smart thing to do would have been to get funding while controlling all branches of government.		Why now and not then?
@Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier Out of curiosity, do you think you deserve to know what kind of salary @BrianKolfage draws from the $20 million in ‚Äúwall funding‚Äù?		Like, if no wall gets built, but lots of talking and tweeting and posting happens...and Brian takes $1 million a year in salary.		All good, right?
@Jedi_Reporter @BrianKolfage @Cernovich @MarkDice @RyanAFournier But you were promised that Mexico would pay for it.		You jumped up and down and cheered.		Now you‚Äôre so eager to fund the wall through ‚Äúnot Mexico‚Äù, you‚Äôve forgotten your calculator		$20 million / $5.7 billion = 0.35%		So you‚Äôll need to keep this up for another 20 years		#scammed

@justsayin60 @Nick_Flannel @kpolantz @Popehat Hearing the prosecutor‚Äôs side of the story would involve an Asst DA sharing a summary of the case then calling a police officer or detective to hear what occurred from their perspective. Jurors would also have the opportunity to ask questions thru the ADA.
@justsayin60 @Nick_Flannel @kpolantz @Popehat As far as I recall, we voted to indict on each and every single case.		Part of the reason for this was based on a lower standard - probable cause - which is very different than ‚Äúreasonable doubt‚Äù at a trial.		I now understand the saying ‚Äúgrand juries would indict a ham sandwich‚Äù
@justsayin60 @Nick_Flannel @kpolantz @Popehat Grand juries can be convened for various purposes, but in my case we would hear something like 5-10 cases a day.		Our job was to hear the prosecutors ‚Äúside of the story‚Äù the evidence against the defendant and then vote on whether there was enough evidence to proceed with a charge
@justsayin60 @Nick_Flannel @kpolantz @Popehat As I understand, and this applies only to my situation in NYC, it‚Äôs a random drawing and less than 10% are selected for the grand jury.

@thecjpearson So what is it when the fire department responds to an emergency?		What is it when the military sends some f35‚Äôs to fend off the enemy?		Free stuff that comes out of nowhere?		#naivekid
@realDonaldTrump smh
@PreetBharara Yes.  But these days it seems that many a legal strategy is actually a PR strategy.		When you can't respond on the merits, attack the investigators, cast doubt on the justice department itself, and be sure to solicit help from foreign governments in doing so.
@renato_mariotti That is among the heaviest uses of the word "IT" in the history of the English language
@waltshaub I would also expect Fox news to disband, Sean Hannity to never broadcast again and the Republican party to rename itself.		As for the Trumps?  I'd expect them to leave the country and never return, assuming they make it out.
@freedom_moates How many are part of the @BrianKempGA voter suppression gang?
@freedom_moates WOMP WOMP
@GeorgePapa19 So you lied when you pleaded guilty to lying.		Any rationale as to WHY THE FUCK YOU WOULD DO THAT?
@Synergy3k @maddow But Hillary‚Äôs emails!!!!!!
@HillReporter Currently in India at a wedding on my wife‚Äôs close friend.		There are 22 national languages in India.		What‚Äôs wrong with some Americans who can‚Äôt deal with people speaking Spanish?
@KaseyMayer_ @freedom_moates @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump Dead silent?		Did you listen to the video on mute?		#factsmatter
@JacobAWohl Trump doesn‚Äôt have the votes, that is why

@JacobAWohl @RudyGiuliani Lol parody
@DineshDSouza @trumps_feed False
@charliekirk11 So quick to absolve your guy.		So quick to judge anyone else.		Why should anyone believe a word you say?
@simonamangiante Did you write this in Russian and use google translate?
@GeorgePapa19 Is that for Aries for Capricorn?
@JacobAWohl And when you consider the same fact, makes a lot more sense why Trump‚Äôs disinformation campaign is as successful as it is.
@charliekirk11 Agreed
@porn_lawyer @JacobAWohl @StormyDaniels Jacob needs something to do
@2WhiskeyGrace @McDonalds Many try to paint her views as those of THE Democratic Party. That‚Äôs not true.  I disagree plenty with her politics. But she‚Äôs real and she‚Äôs herself which is refreshing in today‚Äôs politics and something many trump flunkies can‚Äôt handle.
@2WhiskeyGrace @McDonalds Fiscal conservative social liberal here.		Despise foreign influence in our elections. Also deeply dislike liars.		That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt support Trump. Not because I want socialism.
@freedom_moates You sound scared

@StevenBeschloss Yep
@charliekirk11 Reality is, if those tapes were public it would be GAME OVER for trump and this twitter feed
@mab11106 @charliekirk11 The truth WILL come out. It may not be good for the Clintons and it may not be good for the Trumps...either
@mab11106 @charliekirk11 If they were indicted we would follow the facts.		Reality is, and nobody can provide an adequate explanation: two years of a complete republican control of government yielded no indictments of hillary or bill. Can you explain that?
@charliekirk11 @mab11106 Mob bosses get taken down for tax evasion not for the horrible murders they directed		The People don‚Äôt support mob bosses or ridicule the government and judicial process for this approach to justice.		So why continue to defend trump as he is plainly obviously going down.
@charliekirk11 Lol at this		You can‚Äôt be a serious person and suggest let‚Äôs assume the felonies of persons A and B while giving Individual 1 a complete pass.		Ah yes. You‚Äôre not a serious person. You‚Äôre not trying to use facts and reason to convince people but rather fear for your own base
@Montel_Williams @AdamParkhomenko @LouDobbs @DiamondandSilk Over the hill @LouDobbs is among MANY in the fox network who made an ECONOMIC decision about their own financial lives to eschew years (decades?) of journalism to become a shill for a criminal administration.		The fallout will not spare them. We won‚Äôt let it

@NRA NRA pretending to be relevant in society and tweeting things like ‚ÄúDear Haters...‚Äù

@xode0000 @pdxnorton @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 LOL.		Sooooo Trump lost the popular vote by 2.9 million votes. Tyranny of the majority apply there?
@xode0000 @pdxnorton @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Here‚Äôs the thing though. The nature of democracy is that the voters get to choose.		If the voters choose a fascist, so be it. If the voters choose socialism, so it is.		The beauty of democracy is that over time, works best for citizens will win out.
@charpie_chad @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Brilliant comeback random internet dude!
@StGregs @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Even if that‚Äôs true (that voters in her district are ‚Äúcuckoo for Cocoa Puffs‚Äù) those bowls of cereal voted her in. Duly. Elected.
@NorthernDragon @xode0000 @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Not red herring. Black Sea caviar
@xode0000 @freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Does president trump have to live up to the constitution too? Or just young congresswomen who you‚Äôre scared of?
@Weinsteinlaw @NRA Lawyers typically don't accept collect calls
@AltUSPressSec This is wonderful news!
@freedom_moates @Ocasio2018 Nope.  Duly elected congresswoman.		That's like saying you're attractive to the opposite sex.
@JoeConchaTV totally fantastic how obsessed republicans are with AOC.		and it's just getting started.

@XCHagenX @lachlan @oneunderscore__ Whatever you say...You‚Äôre a blind sheep on your best day
@XCHagenX @lachlan @oneunderscore__ False. None of this is true and if you actually believe that, have you decided what to believe when trump, don jr and many others are indicted then sent to prison? Deep state conspiracy forever!
@XCHagenX @lachlan @oneunderscore__ No, actually it‚Äôs Bongino-specific.		He spews among the most damaging narratives of all the right wing wackos.		He needs less exposure and this will do it!
@lachlan @oneunderscore__ This makes me very happy
@DavidWohl Bunch of babies...honestly
@charliekirk11 Funny how right wing wackos like Charlie magically shift the topic overseas when their fearless leaders become fearful soon to be felons...
@tonyschwartz Is Jim Jordan available? Maybe Jacob Wohl?

RT @LindseyGrahamSC: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
@CLewandowski_ @trumps_feed Your group is on a tree branch that‚Äôs about to snap.		Your lies are so massive that sadly the rational thing to do is to keep extending the lie further and further until the house of justice falls right on your face.		WOMP WOMP
@charliekirk11 An ongoing tactic		Claim ‚Äúabsolutely zero proof‚Äù of something, here, Russian election interference.		But as usual boy wonder is peddling shit.

@freedom_moates What‚Äôs wrong with you?
@kimguilfoyle Conflict of interest disclosure re this tweet would certainly be entertaining!
@realDonaldTrump Unfortunately most likely means talks just fell apart.
@Slippery_gnome @kaitlancollins @real_farmacist How DARE you with this sarcasm.		The trump administration is running like a well oiled machine.		They have the BEST people.		NO administration has done as much in as little time as this one.		None of that was serious.
@carterwpage @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @DevinNunes Some lies are so big you have to create an entirely new reality, hope everyone sticks to the story and then eventually go down with the fucking ship.		This is clearly what we‚Äôre seeing here

@JayChf @dbongino You seem like a reasonable guy. Thanks for sharing your views without vitriol.		I disagree the indictments have nothing to do with the president or Russia.		Again, time will tell and let‚Äôs both hope the country is better off no matter the outcome.
@JayChf @dbongino You watch a lot of Hannity clearly.		Time will tell.		We don‚Äôt know for sure yet, but if it is true that Trump sought to eliminate Russian sanctions for his personal gain, that‚Äôs conduct that all Americans should be appalled by.
@JayChf @dbongino No. Cohen‚Äôs guilty plea confirms discussions around Trump Moscow went on far longer than previously admitted.		All involved are telling the same lie, which makes it take longer.		You seem like a reasonable person. Watch or listen to Rachel Maddow from Fri and decide for yourself.
@JayChf @dbongino Here‚Äôs what will come out		Trump, through Flynn, Papa, Manafort, others worked to lift sanctions on Russian banks to get Trump Moscow built.  They lied to US voters about this EVERY DAY.		Problem is, everyone is telling the same lie, including Bongino.		It‚Äôs all coming out now.
@dbongino False.		#LIARREAH
@JayChf @dbongino With respect, mueller will indict trump and you and millions like you still won‚Äôt believe it.		You‚Äôve so bought into this deep state nonsense that you‚Äôre unable to see fact from fiction, data vs opinion, criminals vs non.
@robertbudesa @dbongino Justice takes longer than nonsensical fact free tweets and podcasts. I wish you well.
@dbongino False.		Not a scam.		Money well spent (and actually made money through assst forfeitures)		Lots of evidence for collusion in public domain, including potential witness tampering, just today.		Real question is: Dan what are your motivation s?

@realDonaldTrump This is getting sad.		The downfall of a criminal administration in plain sight, for all to see, globally, from the perspective of the ‚Äúmastermind‚Äù
@RealCandaceO If the situation were reserved, Candace would weasel out of the debate also.		There‚Äôs no upside in engaging in genuine debate for either of these so called conservative pundits.		Reality is: their views are surface level at best and they‚Äôd both be exposed in a debate format.

@ShadowingTrump What about impeached and not convicted?
@Victronix @saypek @RealCandaceO @senatemajldr Is your question:		Who cares that trump sold America out to make money for his family, while repeatedly lying about, given events A B and C?		Really?
@saypek @RealCandaceO @senatemajldr Pay attention, don‚Äôt change the subject		To get Trump Moscow built, sanctions needed to be lifted from Russian state run bank VTB. Trump surrounds himself with compromised officials and flips policy to personally enrich himself, using the presidency as a tool to do so. All true.
@akjakalope @HillaryClinton Those who continue to defend the criminal administration are on a branch that‚Äôs breaking.		Funny to think, despite drumbeat of disinformation and lies from @FoxNews, the downfall will be FABULOUS for ratings. How entertaining to watch @seanhannity the day Trump is led away...
@RealCandaceO @senatemajldr ...ignores that current and active con by ‚Äúthe right‚Äù selling America‚Äôs interests to further trump‚Äôs personal ones.		NOTHING TO SEE HERE!
@ProudResister Unfortunately, politicians don‚Äôt win elections by averting a FUTURE disaster.		Goes without saying, but denial of climate change, that it‚Äôs a man made phenomenon and the likely effects over time, is a fundamentally political stance and science be damned.
@JcDeplorable @Joshnewcomb4 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Clearly can‚Äôt answer the question so deflect to some other unrelated topic. Keep on!
@JcDeplorable @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump May 11 2017 interview with Lester Holt where Trump made clear that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation not because of fbi report as originally stated. 		That‚Äôs admitting to obstruction of justice.		At least Nixon committed his crimes in secret.
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump False.		Facts + context is not propaganda...
@TheDaniel_Ray @ProudResister @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs easy.		The disinformation campaign has been so successful, about 100m people don‚Äôt know what the facts are. They respond to insinuations and fear.		It‚Äôs a problem and can‚Äôt be solved until virtually all republicans in office are replaced (even new republicans are fine)
@toolsandbeyond @jerome_corsi You simply cannot be serious
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump We have witnessed:		Four of the shortest tenures in history of a cabinet official in that post		Five presidential advisors pleading guilty or being convicted of crimes		#FactsMatter
@JcDeplorable @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump BOT ALERT
@Joshnewcomb4 @JcDeplorable @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I have no idea.		But what I do knowis that a republican administration with CONTROL OF ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT did not pursue charges against Hillary. Why might that be?
@JcDeplorable @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Interesting how you put that:		‚Äú...he could be innocent‚Äù		Sounds a lot like you‚Äôre believing he could be guilty.
@JcDeplorable @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Uhhh the amount of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù on Donald trump that is already in the public domain is STAGGERING.		You are taking the reality that the tick tick of justice is slower than the news cycle as some sort of proof. Weak case! Try harder with a better argument!
@JacobAWohl As well he should.		There‚Äôs like 20 business days left in the year and trump and his family haven‚Äôt been indicted yet.		On the bright side, still plenty of time to develop your tweets and talking points for the inevitable!
@Susan_Hennessey 35% of the country will disagree with you with all the vehemence they can muster, of course without responding on the merits...
@dbongino It‚Äôs not actually viral if you have to post it multiple times...
@JackPosobiec @KurtSchlichter Pretty sure that‚Äôs a throwaway point of view.		One story today forgotten		The other story continues to accelerate
@realDonaldTrump @dbongino He ‚Äúgets it‚Äù of course means he‚Äôs willing to lie unabashedly and shame free.

@RepAdamSchiff What a crushing tweet.		Powerful and true.		Best @dbongino and @seanhannity and many others can do is simply ignore and develop their talking points for when the inevitable comes.
@Delavegalaw WOMP WOMP
@JacobAWohl No, that‚Äôs the leverage that Russia had over Trump that led to the collusion...
@DavidWohl Another deliberately outrageous utter falsehood.
@dbongino Among the falsest things you‚Äôve said! 		Deliberately outrageous falsehoods to continue to sell a book and podcast ads.
@nadifineart @dbongino I agree with all of these complete lies and utter falsehoods!
@dbongino false...
@JacobAWohl Just to correct you... I think they‚Äôre being held as criminal prisoners.
@DavidWohl Hey types angrily, alone in a dark room with the shades drawn...
@dbongino False
@DavidWohl That‚Äôs a bit of a stretch, even for a conspiracy theorizing, fear mongering, father of a future felon like yourself, sir
@GeorgeTakei 35% of America doesn‚Äôt see the link		They‚Äôll say NOT TRUE!		But provide no backup or articulate a rationale behind the assertion.		They‚Äôll say MUELLER‚ÄôS CONFLICTED!

@kathygriffin That woman, like many others, is being DELIBERATELY OUTRAGEOUS, facts, morals, even politics be damned.		It‚Äôs a game of collecting supposed ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù as measured by likes, comments and retweets.		Folks like Tomi and many many others have sold their consciences for a buck.
@RealCandaceO Said another way, ‚Äúpeace and love‚Äù!
@JacobAWohl Twitter is a video game...
@dbongino Hannity confirmed he‚Äôs opinion not news.		Can you confirm the same?

@RadioFreeTom Once damage has been quantified (a few days or a week or two in prison), cost of continued dishonest tweets stoking up obvious conspiracy theories seems minimal.		Or is it?
@KurtSchlichter Cites no evidence.		Lawyers tend to be capable of citing evidence when it is in their interests to do so.		When not, deny, divert and deflect.		Interested in the answer to the following: is the trump government part of the fraud cult? It‚Äôs their report, no?		Explain?

@AllAboardTrump @l0n3rw1thA8onEr @dbongino Your entire response sums up to ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt‚Äù. That‚Äôs as far and as deep as it goes.
@AllAboardTrump @l0n3rw1thA8onEr @dbongino Angela doesn‚Äôt have any ability to form a coherent response or engage on the facts.  Not with my time...moving on now!
@AllAboardTrump @l0n3rw1thA8onEr @dbongino This is a joke.  If you don‚Äôt know it, the joke‚Äôs on you.
@AllAboardTrump @l0n3rw1thA8onEr @dbongino Have you decided how you will respond when Mueller (R) shares undeniable proof that leads to impeachment?
@Barnes_Law @JacobAWohl Very dishonest.		See:		Total US car deaths: 34k (‚Äò13)	Total Central African Republic car deaths: 1k (‚Äò13)		According to Trump ‚Äúlogic‚Äù, US car travel is 34x deadlier.		But per 100k residents, US has 10.6 fatalities and CAF has 32.4.		Which is actually more dangerous? More honest?
@Pappiness It will be a national embarrassment should she be elected.
@jmstalks2u @dbongino Trump can fire Mueller. That makes Trump more powerful than Mueller.
@dbongino It pisses ‚Äúlibs‚Äù off when you spread patently false crap.		No HONEST person actually believes Mueller is the most powerful person in the country.		Unfortunately Bongino and lots of others on Fox gleefully spread lies and misinformation.		Conscience sold for cash.
@DavidWohl Actually, wrong
@dbongino Completely false...		Trump is obviously the most powerful man in America. Needs no elaboration because it‚Äôs so obvious.		Bongino trafficking in false information, as usual!
@dbongino False
@GOP @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump @SecWilkie False
@DavidWohl Keep hoping!
@CharlesMBlow Agreed
@AllAboardTrump @dbongino Okay then. You are an exact match with other righty‚Äôs who, for anything, simply cannot respond on the merits
@AllAboardTrump @dbongino How about you...destroying the country how. Try to be specific!
@AllAboardTrump @dbongino How about the claim of Mueller‚Äôs abuses. He was legally appointed and is operating well within the confines of this thing called...the law.		Meanwhile, your pal Trump inserts constitutionally dubious acting AG in office with grossly clear biases.		Which is an abuse of power?
@dbongino Completely false
@dbongino False...
@shannonrwatts @NRA Hi folks. You can‚Äôt buy a tank or hand grenade at the store. Sounds like an infringement.		Why might that be?
@amyspitalnick @NewYorkStateAG First, I shall clear my throat.		Next, WOMP WOMP.
@JacobAWohl False...
@rbbellingham @JacobAWohl He already has the (free) speech equivalent of face tattoos...he‚Äôs unhirable.
@davidhogg111 Well said
@DavidWohl @JacobAWohl Note the response isn‚Äôt ‚Äúno my son and I aren‚Äôt frauds, and here‚Äôs why [insert rational explanation here] but instead it‚Äôs deflect deflect deflect. WOHLs = FRAUDs
@charliekirk11 What do you even mean. State your point clearly rather than offering weak insinuations.
@GeorgePapa19 @jimsciutto @jaketapper Oh yeah, there‚Äôs been dozens of indictments and guilty pleas resulting from the Mueller investigation, but Hillary bleach bit with the emails server in her basement FISA warrant bought and paid for deep state lies!!!
@GeorgePapa19 @jimsciutto @jaketapper The Right, when faced with obviously non partisan facts that conflict with their narrative, can do nothing but change the subject and shirk a response. It‚Äôs pretty transparent and sad.
RT @IrateMillenial: @Comey BREAKING: White House Turkey refuses Presidential Pardon, is now cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
@JackPosobiec @JacobAWohl Deliberately outrageous with the sole goal of stoking further disunity. Congratulations!
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Wow
@JacobAWohl False
@EvaLB5 @CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends @FoxNews Can‚Äôt explain, got it
@krassenstein I‚Äôm sure just a coincidence...
@EvaLB5 @CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends @FoxNews Debunked? In what way?  Please elaborate...		How can you look at live footage of Fox where Corey blatantly makes fun of a child with Down‚Äôs syndrome...and call it ‚Äúdebunked‚Äù. 		That‚Äôs beyond absurd.  But please enlighten the world...
@jcfarber @benshapiro Trump likely baited Roberts. Any future rulings unfavorable to Trump and watch Roberts be vilified as a Hillary lackie...right here on Twitter
@RichMcWilliams1 @benshapiro The title ‚Äúdisgraced former tv host‚Äù will suit him nicely...
@EvaLB5 @CLewandowski_ @foxandfriends @FoxNews Thanks for this, right? https://t.co/G6KEBa1ZLO
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Exactly.		Founders assumed free press + intel of Americans would ensure criminals would not become Prez or be removed from office speedily.		That same criminal using his powers of appointment as a weapon and with full enablement by some Press illuminates key flaws in our system.
@levie Sounds like the Uber of Google for flight delay info!!!
@realDonaldTrump FYI as written means anyone born here is a citizen. That‚Äôs what it says.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump All of this is false.
@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump A single cold day and the fact-free Right proclaims unassailable proof global warming is a scam...
@itsJeffTiedrich I like beer.
@hadenusc @dbongino There‚Äôs this thing asylum and this thing called the rule of law.		Like, it‚Äôs possible, believe it or not, for judges to hate the caravan and the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù but that the law doesn‚Äôt permit the relief Fox News pundits advocate for.		The law is a thing, believe it for not.
@dbongino If there‚Äôs a real legal argument, then it will be brought forth and argued on their merits.		If not, FoxNews has plenty of programming.
@CarolinaFroggg @dbongino What shenanigans, specifically?		Or just commenting on vague generalities put out there by right wing Conspirators?
@HenikerMorpeth @dbongino Respond to the merits, if capable.		Is not the judiciary independent?  Why the attacks, now?
@dbongino Leave it to the wackos from the Right to trash the highest court in the land.		Is not the judiciary independent?		The timing of these attacks is very significant.		Wait for it.
@greta @trumps_feed @HelpBobLevinson No political win here for POTUS, unfortunately
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Trump stepping up his attacks on judiciary as a prelude to lots of indictments coming soon. Thanks Matt Whitaker for briefing the president on status of the investigation so the public knows as well!
@JohnWDean I agree with you but I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúshamelessly blatant‚Äù captures the depths of Donald‚Äôs depravity...
@TheRealSeanCrib @CannadogCO @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs correct. The founders created a construct through the amendment process that provides for changes as society invariably evolves. A good example of this is the 13th amendment.
@CannadogCO @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I respect your opinions as well
@Stop_Trump20 @ABFalecbaldwin @realDonaldTrump Can‚Äôt wait for @KellyannePolls to enlighten us how there‚Äôs no inconsistency here...
@rolandscahill The day Kavanaugh votes against trump (someday soon), it will be a good, no, great day for democracy...
@CannadogCO @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Ok...‚Äùlegislate through opinions.‚Äù Where is evidence justices confirmed under Democrats rule based on opinion versus justices confirmed under republicans?  Also, if the constitution weren‚Äôt a living document African Americans would get 3/5 of a vote...
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump What a joke.  Falsehoods galore...
@dbongino Sessions, Republican, declined to bring charges.		This is all a narrative to paint a picture of ‚Äúliberal bias‚Äù when Trump and his cronies actually go down for Russian Collusion, the thing that you and your fellows insist doesn‚Äôt exist.		Wait and see!
@SallyQYates The Right‚Äôs grand strategy is to convince a major chunk of the electorate that things like FACTS, JUSTICE and VALUES are somehow far left liberal politics.		Then, lie REPEATEDLY in all the ways that stoke maximum fear, likely because FEAR drives votes more than moral leadership.
@RealCandaceO @BillClinton @HillaryClinton Nasty, vindictive, hateful.		Ladies and gentleman: the up and coming STAR of the Republican Party!
@ha14279228 @dbongino If he didn‚Äôt need to, why did he recuse?
@ChrisDa07624877 @dbongino The very first sentence of sessions resignation letter says: ‚Äúdear mr president, at your request, I am submitting my resignation.‚Äù Resigning at someone‚Äôs request means you were fired.
@DicapEvergreen @dbongino Have a look at the time it took the watergate investigation to complete. Nixon and Agnew were all over how biased the media was. How‚Äôd that turn out? Fact of life that the skids of Twitter fly faster than the wheels of justice. But the arc bends towards justice. Wait and see!
@mmmtttattt @dbongino Yes - the law and order party indeed
@RckyFshr @dbongino If trump keeps saying no collusion witch hunt...his winings will convince some people that he‚Äôs telling the truth. Repeat lies long enough and some people believe them
@PammiiSue @charliekirk11 Conservatives are the ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù party but leaders keep getting indicted and keep pleading guilty! Funny how that works!!! Must be the deep state (you know, the career folks at the justice department) hard at work!
@dbongino This tweet not likely to age well over the next couple weeks.		You have to wonder: if there‚Äôs not a ‚Äúscintilla‚Äù of evidence, why does trump fire sessions and insert constitutionally dubious whitaker with such clear bias (just like you) against the probe without full info? 1+1 = ?
@tedlieu Emails clearly need to be banned or taxed.
@MaxBoot Confirmed: no shame
@johncardillo @JacobAWohl False
@PammiiSue @charliekirk11 Might have something to do with her (Obama‚Äôs) accomplishments. As I understand Melania posed for plenty of magazines, focused more on her appearance. If you‚Äôre a parent, who‚Äôd you want your child to emulate? Nude model or Princeton and Harvard Law grad?

@MichaelAvenatti I say this as a moderate and someone who values objective truth and who lets the political cards fall where they may. @MichaelAvenatti claims are weakened by refuting @TuckerCarlson claims while sharing no explanation for what actually happened.
