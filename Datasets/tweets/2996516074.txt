@DCHuskers @Huskers Why is Nebraska ratified US #23A 1961 called "3/4ths Persons" Amendment?	Idaho had enough population in 1910-1980 US Censuses for 2 US Reps, 2 US Sens, so 4 Electoral College votes, from 1912-1982, but that entire time DC had bigger pop, in 1961 getting only 3 EC votes, not 4.
@DCHuskers @Huskers DC was larger population than 16 US states in 1943 but crashed down -42.3% 1943-1999, as educated middle class fled to states allowed vote so build public universities, (later quality edu).		Today DC pop is only bigger than US states of VT &amp; WY.
@DCHuskers @Huskers In 1961, peak hateful power JimCrow politicians (pre 1965 Voting Rights) fearful of #DCstatehood ending vote theft so electing black politicians to US Senate, allowed "3/4ths persons" US Amendment #23A for DC to vote for US Prez only, to block statehood, which Nebraska ratified.
@DCHuskers @Huskers The last successful Nebraska step of any kind to reduce ongoing vote theft from US citizens of DC, was in the wake of so many educated people fleeing, black&amp;white educated flight, (like Pentagon) that DC became majority black 1st time 1960 US Census (now plurality black 2010).
@DCHuskers @Huskers SAC's boss US Air Force HQ (as prior name US Army Air Corp HQ), fled tyranny over DC with US Army HQ in late 1930s to Pentagon constructed outside DC in US state of Virginia, as VA was allowed public universities &amp; ROTC, unlike DC under tyranny (until 1966 when UDC was allowed).
@DCHuskers @Huskers Last Nebraska US Rep / US Sen to as much as cosponsor a #DCstatehood bill was US Sen Bob Kerry D-NE, on #S898 1993.		Unlike most Nebraska politicians ever, US Sen Bob Kerry, a Navy Vet, may have strongly opposed JimCrow vote theft from mil &amp; vets &amp; their families, &amp; denial of edu

@Edras_20 &lt;eye roll&gt; blaming where conservative abused people flee to is like blaming hospitals for being where injured flee to, it doesn't make any sense unless seen as just rural jealous snark.
@Edras_20 Although tyranny of DC is the most conservative form of government possible, DC at the street level is very liberal.		Maryland &amp; Virginia are long conservative &amp; therefore rural. If you want to make DMV less conservative, free DC, because DC will invest in expanding opportunity.
@Edras_20 DC has always attracted people abused by conservative malicious inequality, be it Maryland's, Virginia's, or El Salvador's, all examples of major sources of DC population, people fleeing poverty. Maybe you should respect what builds opportunity in DC, &amp; forbidden in El Salvador.
@Edras_20 @EleanorNorton @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @wmata @dcwater LOL! Liberal politics (democracy) building successful urban density has done more to fight poverty by using network economics than any other technology in human history.		Poverty is created in conservative areas that don't build opportunity, so impoverished flee to liberal areas.
@My_name_is_Aka I wrote my reply to you because you were going to invest the time reading a very subtle point of law, on which US Constitution based tyranny DC is under (as -a special territory under US I-8-17 tyranny for the federal district, vs PR GU MP VI AS under US IV-3 territory tyranny).
@My_name_is_Aka @ActingColumbia @dudenamedclark @staceyabrams Sorry, not you @My_name_is_Aka, as your tweet was super cute! More please.		It's @ActingColumbia who trolls really hard, repeatedly, saying things adamantly which don't match the actual facts on the ground, making it really hard for causal readers to unpack or fact check.
@Edras_20 @EleanorNorton @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @wmata @dcwater DC could not even found a Morrill Land Grant College Act 1862 university because of tyranny, until 1966, 104yrs delayed. Expanded economy &amp; tax base allows DC to grow UDC &amp; public schools so deeply hampered by tyranny.		Money is a big part of the problem, but tyranny is worse.
@Edras_20 @EleanorNorton @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @wmata @dcwater Building height ban by tyranny limits economy, &amp; only DC statehood can decriminalize tall buildings. Expanded economy of skyscrapers at rail hubs self funds massive rail expansion. Expanded rail increases demand for residential skyscraper demand. Expanded economy expands tax base
@ActingColumbia @dudenamedclark @My_name_is_Aka @staceyabrams Distinction without a difference as all inferior are in territories requiring statehood to remedy the malicious inequality. Don't split hairs like that, saying it completely wrong when it is linguistically almost always correct.
@My_name_is_Aka @ActingColumbia @dudenamedclark @staceyabrams 3) AS territory citizens are NOT US citizens but US Congress in violation of US #14A hold AS pop inferior as "US Nationals", not taxed, no vote, Green Card to move to a full US state, no vote when they move there.
@My_name_is_Aka @ActingColumbia @dudenamedclark @staceyabrams 2) PR GU MP VI territories citizens are full US citizens too free to move anywhere in the US, but in their territory are federally untaxed &amp; voteless, but if moved to a state are full equals, becoming a state's ordinary citizens, like DC's citizens moving to full states,
@My_name_is_Aka @ActingColumbia @dudenamedclark @staceyabrams &lt;eye roll&gt; (tweeter trolls too often) In short the 3 inferior classes of "we the people" live in what is usually called voteless US territories. The 3 classes are:	1) DC, special territory, a federal district, so treated very weirdly, so federally taxed &amp; voteless US citizens,
@Edras_20 @EleanorNorton &lt;eye roll&gt; ~80% of DC citizens ballots cast on #DCstatehood referendum were for statehood, to allow DC to improve forever, eg grow quality of @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @wmata @dcwater, what tyranny has forbidden DC pop by denying equality with most Americans, especially MD &amp; VA.

@dudenamedclark @staceyabrams @My_name_is_Aka In short #DCstatehood is the only US Constitutional path to equality &amp; parallel independence as each US state has in the federal model. Anything else is inferior &amp; revocable.
@dudenamedclark @staceyabrams @My_name_is_Aka Lot to unpack. DC is a US territory with &gt;pop than full vote VT&amp;WY. Yes DC has a city, Washington, so to best manage both, the non-binding proposal making only pretend DC gov covers both US Territory of DC &amp; City Washington with 1 level of gov, so will continue with #DCstatehood.

@AIPAC Will @AIPAC publish a public position on #DCstatehood, a US democracy &amp; anti-semitism issue (among many), so we may learn if silence is deliberate to side strongly pro GOP's ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny by stonewalling to forbid US citizens of DC seating @SenPaulStrauss?
@AIPAC @SenPaulStrauss Given @AIPAC's delicate politics courting "Jews will not replace us" "both sides" Trump/GOP, &amp; many of DC's Jewish pop fleeing tyranny over DC to #MD08 post WWII, try nudging just Dem US Reps &amp; US Sens who are Jewish, for now, to pro #DCstatehood to actually oppose anti-semitism.
@AIPAC If @AIPAC supports Israel &amp; US democracy, especially relevant in funding security for both nations (eg research pipeline producing F-35, F-15, etc), then @AIPAC should remind holdout Jewish US Reps &amp; US Senators to cosponsor #DCstatehood bills, to seat voteless @SenPaulStrauss.

@dmataconis Troll forked thread &amp; continued a series of petty personal insults on me as DC citizen for even asking what he meant &amp; what DC citizens &amp; US pols would actually have to do &amp; sacrifice to embrace his JimCrow Plan B vote &amp; taxbase theft plan.		He stonewalls facts &amp; insults people.
@dmataconis Can you name 3 US politicians supporting JimCrow Plan B vote &amp; taxbase theft from DC, what you call "the only" path, meant to maliciously block equality of #DCstatehood?		Pro #DCstatehood I can name all DC local leaders, most Maryland leaders, 197 US Reps, &amp; 31 US Sens (2017).
@dmataconis You stopped to insult me, &amp; then forked the thread to hide your laughably inadequate answers.
@dmataconis So your assertions is that Maryland government, DC citizens, &amp; 60% US Senate &amp; 50% US House should all openly agree to steal existing EC votes &amp; taxbase of DC citizens forever despite not one single DC, MD, nor US politician supporting your JimCrow Plan B?
@dmataconis (Ignoring your insults of me again.) As you make absurd &amp; extreme conclusion about US voting rights &amp; US politics, I have asked several basic follow up questions about your pro JimCrow Plan B vote &amp; taxbase theft assertions, which you haven't answered. Is it that you don't know?
@dmataconis To minimize Maryland being perceived as pro vote theft of 2 more of DC citizen's Electoral College votes for US President, which 38 US states (likely not MD) would ratify the #23A repeal based vote theft instead?		Only 25 states are pro GOP's JimCrow vote theft, so which 13 more?
@dmataconis Ignorant? Explain exactly how tyranny will force full vote Maryland to merge with voteless DC when neither DC nor Maryland want to merge? Explain exactly how you will repeal US Amendment #23A 1961 to minimize the JimCrow Plan B vote theft angle to primarily Plan B taxbase theft?
@dmataconis Tweeter cluelessly pro JimCrow Plan B hate based vote &amp; tax base theft from US citizens of DC to block fair &amp; equal answer of #DCstatehood unsurprisingly immediately reverses position in reply to 1st tweet asking why pro hateful Plan B, now siding pro fair #DCstatehood. &lt;eye roll
@dmataconis DC has more people than Vermont &amp; Wyoming &amp; pays more taxes than 20 states, yet endures federal "taxation without representation" under tyranny, only allowed to vote for POTUS but not other actual or equal elections.	#DCstatehood is the only fair answer, so JimCrow voices hate it

@ActingColumbia @xmasape &lt;eye roll&gt; Wow you love moving goal posts to an argument you alone uniquely support that a supposed jurisdiction with no power to tax, fund elections, no elected offices, no elected officials, is supposed to resolve the #DCstatehood legislation.		Real world? We use @councilofdc.
@ActingColumbia @xmasape Further, although DC citizens require clean(ish) process to ASAP #DCstatehood, many DC citizens want major changes to DC gov form with statehood, so demand protracted conventions, but if done now would both delay &amp; complicate #DCstatehood so should be fairly done post statehood.
@ActingColumbia @xmasape We disagree on law making for the required draft state constitution, as US Congress is opposed to such steps, making conventions extremely hard to fund, &amp; we the people of DC require a reasonably clean process to actually get #DCstatehood ASAP, so must use DC law makers.

@AlexandraD123 By building peak density employment hubs, cities don't bulldoze all their single homes, they upgrade their rail spoke station density to convenient 8 to 12 story apartment buildings, &amp; several blocks away the single family homes (row house or free standing) begin.
@AlexandraD123 I reject your assertion entirely. Many single family homes in Brooklyn NYC NY, but it has 3x DC density.	1) People fleeing tyranny over DC 1943-1999 cut DC by -42%.	2) anchor job hubs w/ peak density like downtown &amp; midtown Manhattan density sharply ups density on all rail spokes
@AlexandraD123 I don't understand your assertions at all.	Elaborate on why you think zoning magically forbids urban density in DC, while criminalizing all skyscrapers at rail hubs &amp; massive rail expansion to such employment hubs they fund, &amp; upping rail spoke station density, isn't relevant 2U?

@82_Streetcar @alex_block @mtsw No worries, education is a major grievance driving #DCstatehood movement for generations, why most Federal HQ which fled tyranny over DC already fled in the first place. I like asking what can we do now, &amp; what  should we do long term.
@alex_block @82_Streetcar @mtsw As is #DCTAG, also very limited, using DC tax dollars to appear like instate tuition rates at any public university but UMD is supposedly the most popular recipient of federal law DCTAG program DC tax funding (but likely federal tax instead of local tax, but I am not an expert).
@DCist Renaming @Wilsonhsdcps for 4th DC Council Chair John A. Wilson, of DC's Wilson Building fame, keeps Wilson last name, key for genealogy &amp; history &amp; continuity, "Wilson Tigers" name for now (despite Woodrow Wilson's Princeton Tigers reference it uses), lowers transition costs.

@82_Streetcar @alex_block @mtsw @udc_edu No, your attempted break up of UMD system &amp; most affluent MD counties, guts quality of edus for Maryland citizens long term, gutting tax funding, tuition payments, alumni donations. Merging in UDC likely takes College Park spots as well. It causes needed less havoc, so I'm done.
@82_Streetcar @alex_block @mtsw #DCTAG law effectively makes UMD undergrad shared instate tuition for DC citizens, but grad schools are not shared so DC pays out of state. DC citizens are not equal rights to the UMD campus.		Maryland tax base is in DC suburbs, any merger into DC guts Maryland economy &amp; edus.
@82_Streetcar @alex_block @mtsw @udc_edu was delayed founding by tyranny 104 years, so still ranks dead last of 51 flagship public universities, despite highest GDP per capita, because it requires democracy to grow equality.		It is wildy unethical to put Marylanders into DC if that forbids quality public .edus.
@Twonius @mtsw No! No part of Virginia is needed, even though JimCrow vote theft politicians in Virginia really want to.		#DCstatehood will trigger faster DC growth, eg upzoning &amp; region rail improvements to expand DC opportunity &amp; fund key DC services, eg #DCPS &amp; @udc_edu; so grows VA liberals
@82_Streetcar @alex_block @mtsw (&lt;eye roll&gt; *fair).

RT @nikkimcentee17: Just learned the US Botanical Garden basically has a "get parents on maternity leave out of the house with the newborn"…
Correction: Maryland Gov't's "offer"
Pro on-going vote theft tyranny voices always point to 1790, instead of 1801, to try to incorrectly say that there was never full voting rights US national capital under the US Constitution, when tyranny is actually optional, not used for 3 prior US national capitals under USCon.
In 1800, US Government moved the US national capital to standard US voting rights proposed City of Washington, Prince George's County Maryland, &amp; only the following year opted to accept Maryland government to abolish democracy in an area surrounding CoW, converting it into DC.
1801 founding date of both DC &amp; tyranny over DC (not 1790 search process) matters because DC is the 4th national capital under the US Constitution but 1st under tyranny. Prior 3, 1787-1801, had all standard US elections; NYC, Philadelphia, &amp; proposed City of Washington PG Co MD.
Most worryingly, this "on-going tyranny vs restore democracy" fight over the form of government is so often dismissed as one political party vs another, lying as if US citizens of DC could already vote, or says it is exceptable to usurp democracy by banning elections like this.

Biggest hole in "pro ongoing tyranny over DC" argument is 1783 back pay protests of US Congress haven't been copied. ~422,000 federal workers in tri-state as feds HQs fled tyranny to voting right US states, ~142,000 federal jobs remain in DC, only ~62,000 fed workers live DC.
Although slave owner James Madison's odious inherited inferiority forever has been abolished US #13A #14A #15A for slaves because of the US Civil War 1860-1865, but Madison's inherited inferiority persist for US national capital citizens of DC (note: DC area reduced 1846 &amp; 1946).
Further slave owner James Madison / E Publis demands inherited inferiority forever like used on slaves be extended to National Capital territory citizens under tyranny, denied all protections of democracy, such as no local binding "advice &amp; consent" judges to defend equality.
Slave owner James Madison's / E Publis's Federalist Paper 43 demands states offering some of their territory for a national capital territory selfishly use tyranny of (state) majority to alienate some of their citizens "inalienable rights", taking rights from private land owners.
Omits that US military was protesting US Congress for rejecting paying military for years during US Revolutionary War 1776-1783, was for the years of back pay the solders were owed in 1783.		Madison wanted tyranny over DC to allow US Congress to revoke all federal pay contracts.
Calls DC under tyranny with all actual legislatures banned, Federal, State, &amp; Local, &amp; since 1973 allowed a non-binding locally elected proposal making body instead, merely "oversight" by US Congress.		Drops "End" off the begining of "Taxation Without Representation" DC tag motto

@CIA @RepSlotkin Education access was central in @CIA HQ location it was marketed as "Langley" for its High School district, outside both vote theft tyranny over DC &amp; unlike Pentagon, outside Arlington &amp; JimCrow politicians threats to boot Arlington from VA, so CIA access to public .edu forever.
@CIA As E Street band deliberately fled ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny over DC ~1947, eg no Morrill Land Grant University Act 1862 undergrad (UDC delayed 104yrs) nor law school (delayed &gt;160yrs compared to MD &amp; VA), will @CIA brief @RepSlotkin #MI08 to cosponsor #DCstatehood bill?

@StudentsforDC @AUforDC @CUAforDC @GallaudetUforDC @GWUforDC @GUforDC @HUforDC @TWUforDC @UDCforDC Fact Check: DC was not created until 1801.

(eg interstate &amp; high speed rail ~75mi from SJC airport to BQN, to shorten budget flights ~1040mi to Miami, &amp; 25mi to Fajardo. Freight rail to link container port SJC &amp; Ponce's)
@StudentsforDC @CharlesARodrig2 @PRSC51 @TheJusticeDept Article also omits suggestion that #PRstatehood supporters follow US Rep @EleanorNorton D-DC's DC example &amp; pass as much US Congress legislation to make PR turnkey ready for statehood, eg replace PR's one Resident Commissioner with 5 non-voting Delegates to US Congress.
@StudentsforDC @CharlesARodrig2 @PRSC51 Article omits Trump / Session's @TheJusticeDept spitefully slow rolling authorizing the ballot design for #PRstatehood referendum, screwing PR out of validating the referendum which past anyway, as well as out of money they spent on the statehood referendum, to block statehood.

@RepElaineLuria Perhaps going on the record by officially cosponsoring US #VotingRights #DCstatehood bill every Congess, now #HR51 2019, is how to actually fight ongoing prejudice, be it anti-black, anti-semitic, anti-military (mostly anti-Navy as most Army left via Pentagon 1939), anti-veteran.
@JoeCunninghamSC #TrumpShutdown hurts DC, but vote theft does worse, DC pop crashed -42% 1943-1999, while Beltway region pop up &gt;300% same era, as Feds fled tyranny.	Of ~420k DC MD VA Feds jobs, reportedly 62k are DC residents, but 141k Feds jobs in DC proper employ 79k full vote MD&amp;VA commuters.
@JoeCunninghamSC So many Federal jobs fled tyranny over DC proper since 1930s to full vote suburbs with democracy quality public institutions, eg allowed Morrill Land Grant College Act 1862 universities unlike DC prior to 1966, DC pop declined from larger than 16 states, eg ME, to just 2, VT&amp;WY.

@BenThrutchley @andria_n_thomas @ElaineLuriaVA Correction: @andria_n_thomas has old tweet saying @ElaineLuriaVA campaign was pro #DCstatehood, while other Twitter chatter (I recall including Andria's own) said campaign stonewalled answering.		The problem is @RepElaineLuria hasn't cosponsored HR51 yet.	https://t.co/SLBSUyGh3M

@Abby4Iowa @iowahousedems Having emailed you (your staff LA) to cosponsor #DCstatehood bill every congress/year (now #HR51 2019), I am glad you oppose vote theft in Iowa. Will you cosponsor DC statehood to officially oppose vote theft in DC for more people than Vermont &amp; Wyoming?
@BullsLawDan @autoddmisc @caia437 @NKingofDC The District was to not be in a state when the US had less than 1000 soldiers, &amp; states controlled their major state militaries, so Congress could build efficient streets in DC etc, without conflict with an powerful existing state.

@BullsLawDan @autoddmisc @caia437 @NKingofDC US Congress has optional tyranny powers (US I-8-17) over a national capital to suspend nationwide US IV-4-1 protections against tyranny usurped federal process, which it exercises since 1801 ordinary law over DC &amp; US. DC was twice part BRACed, ~1846&amp;1946, sharply reducing area.
@BullsLawDan @autoddmisc @caia437 @NKingofDC Inherited inferiority was very popular with slave owner James Madison / E Publish Federalist 43, for both slaves &amp; a future national capital district, yet was abolished for slaves, but not for remaining DC.

@BullsLawDan @autoddmisc @caia437 @NKingofDC Talking point wrongly claims DC existed in 1st 25 years of nation &amp; 1st 12yrs of US Constitution. DC is the 10th national capital, &amp; 4th nat'l capital under US Constitution, but 1st under vote theft tyranny. NYC, Philly, &amp; proposed City of Washington MD, all voted equally.

@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense There is absolutely nothing "outside the box" here, just the same tired hateful tyranny politics we have come to expect from US JimCrow conservatives for hundred of years, since the dawn of slavery in the colonies pre US, &amp; maintained over voteless US citizens of DC to this day.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense What makes his WA spiteful partition to impoverish eastern Washington even worse here, he tries to use gutting of Washington State to nullify vote restoration &amp; democracy for DC citizens like me, to cement ever more out of touch hateful conservative usurpation of the US Senate.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense Twist here is @frankmiele is claiming conservatives idea wildly harming full vote Washington State citizens eg stealing Washington State University &amp; all Federal dams, etc, to steal 2 US Senate votes to usurp it more, more tyranny, isn't felonious.		(NB: I own % of a farm in WA)
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense It is utterly unsurprising that conservatives continue demanding theft of 2 more of EC votes from DC, &amp; banning DC equality &amp; opportunity, &amp; looting DC tax base, gutting billions of dollars of DC common law court precedents, claiming malicious vote theft isn't prejudiced tyranny.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense Peak JimCrow hateful vote theft tyranny conservatives in the US Senate (pre 1965 Voting Rights Act) fearing #DCstatehood would be won by newly majority black 1960 DC, the conservatives allowed US citizens of DC be 3/4ths person by #23A, stealing DC's 4th EC in 1964,68,72,76,&amp;80.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense Since 1801 DC had been upset about being held maliciously inferior, more so post 1860 when DC grew larger than the smallest state (still to this day). Extremely active just after both World Wars, &amp; HI &amp; AK statehood, but conservatives block #DCstatehood for so many they hate.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @DeptofDefense @frankmiele then declares ongoing vote theft by conservatives isn't about flagrant racism, yet in 1961 when 1960 US Census recorded DC educated flight (black &amp; white) skewed DC majority black, no longer hated Catholic, free states could only get "3/4th persons" US Amendment #23A.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary DC region pop grew &gt;300% while DC pop crashed -42%. Why? Conservatives hate DC citizens/residents so much, they forbade democracy &amp; most democracy quality institutions, eg no Morrill Land Grant College Act 1862 university &amp; ROTC, so numerous federal HQs fled DC, eg @DeptofDefense
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @frankmiele omits that DC was bigger population than Idaho 1910-1980 while Idaho had 2 US Reps &amp; 4EC votes for POTUS, but as so many voteless people fled voteless DC to full vote suburbs, DC pop declined 42.3% 1943-1999, dropping below 2 USReps 4 EC vote size in 1980 US Census.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary He blithely uses slaves owner James Madison's / E Publis's Federalist 43 inherited inferiority for DC just like for slaves, by tyranny of the majority (of Maryland legislature) to abolish DC citizens US voting &amp; civil rights 1st, yet slavery's inherited inferiority was abolished.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary After "omitted", @frankmiele launches into a democracy nullification plan precisely like slave states insisted on to forbid democracy &amp; retain slavery!? How does he hate democracy so much that he can abide vote theft tyranny, &amp; if returned vote, artificially partition to nullify?
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary But apparently @frankmiele will only post the JimCrow Plan B vote &amp; tax theft from DC citizens by forced merger paragraphs in the @RealClearNews article, deleting the two most shameful paragraphs with a silly "[Section omitted]" in his HeartlandDiaryUSA dot com blog.
@frankmiele @RealClearNews @HeartlandDiary @Frankmiele of @RealClearNews goes full tilt pro JimCrow Plan B vote &amp; tax theft from DC citizens by tyranny forced merger of ongoing JimCrow legislatures voteless DC into full vote MD, to block #DCstatehood equality, steal 2 more of DC's Electoral College votes.	#DCstatehoodNews

7) most gauling under Trump tax increases, State &amp; Local Tax (SALT) deduction is abolished, so DC taking on Federal spend on DC courts &amp; prisons, means Federal gov now collects double taxes on DC incomes DC gov taxes for new courts &amp; prison spending. Much more efficient to Fed $.
6) a well researched transition plan is required for prisoner handling, requiring DC US Senator to get accurate data to craft the plan. Further handling costs per prisoner could easily escalate needlessly by trying to rush it, for both DC &amp; Federal gov. Frugality means delay.
5) DC citizens pay the most taxes per capita of any state. If an accurate CFFS report was done, keeping federal spend, eg on DC courts &amp; prisons, may be the only way for DC citizens to get value for their federal taxes.	DC US Senators are required for assuring federal value.
4) DC prisoners are under Federal US Marshals, under a massively complicated array of long term federal contracts, supposedly with both government &amp; private prisons. Actually researching that in detail &amp; ever considering unwinding all that requires actual US Senators for DC.
3) US Congress abolished annual US Census CFFS reports entirely, making knowing how little is actually spent on DC citizens a massive hurdle of restarting CFFS style reports, let alone actually fixing these reports.
2) US Census CFFS reports on federal spend in each US state, were so brutally flawed for federal spend in DC, publicly available data works firmly against voteless DC citizens. Usually new DC US Senators would work for a decade just to unscramble that, like Moynihan did for NY.
My 10 year status quo Federal spend on DC state budget proposal is based on a bunch of related problems.		1) "DC" spending label has been long misused on international, national, regional, &amp; commuter spending, no one is certain how little is spent on actual DC citizens.
@JBurchDC @51stDC @washingtonpost Although I respect &amp; envy @JBurchDC successful Op-Ed, I have a serious policy difference. Although DC should now research &amp; pencil in initial estimated court &amp; prison costs, #DCstatehood state budget plan should start with 10 years of status quo Fed $, so DC US Sens can untangle.

@NatSecElitist DC population was bigger pop than 16 US states during World War II, but ongoing JimCrow vote theft was still popular. As a major number of federal HQs fled to full vote suburbs with public .edus, &amp; a tsunami of DC educated fled DC to full vote suburbs, DC pop -42% &amp; region +&gt;300%
@XIII_Mr_Undadog @udc_edu @udc_edu founded 1966, although very small racially segregated teachers colleges (1 black, 1 white) were founded late 1920s, meant that UDC is automatically under funded, denied accumulated alumni donations &amp; state capital spend. Also JimCrow abused migrants to DC didn't college.
@XIII_Mr_Undadog @udc_edu DC black pop changed in DC, I can't remember if it went up or down ~70k since World War II, while PG Co MD grew &gt;6x since WWII, to bigger than DC pop. Vote theft mattered to all educated who fled DC, while new to DC JimCrow abused blacks desprately needed k-12 public education.
@XIII_Mr_Undadog @udc_edu White population decline &gt;330k in DC since World War II massively skewed remaining population towards black. Black educated flight is harder to measure as many Howard U alums fled to PG Co, while countless JimCrow abused blacks arrived DC&amp;PG, hiding role of black educated flight.
@XIII_Mr_Undadog @udc_edu Federal offices fled DC because DC didn't have public universities for their kids, so no ROTC &amp; GI Bill &amp; affordable public education because JimCrow vote theft forbade it, so a tsunami of educated families fled DC to suburbs, educated flight, black &amp; white.
@XIII_Mr_Undadog @udc_edu @udc_edu could be massively improved, although it will likely retain HBCU label for a long time, it will likely post statehood more resemble DC population at large, so become plurality black. DC was 25%-34% black until World War II era when federal offices began fleeing tyranny.

@JohnJHance @PrivacyAttorney Since the 1930s, the federal executive branch has done everything it can to remove federal employees from ongoing tyranny over DC citizens, to the end hostage taking over DC citizens, eg no vote, no proper Morrill Land Grant College &amp; ROTC for 104yrs, no public law school 160yrs.
@JohnJHance @PrivacyAttorney My point is that Trump &amp; McConnell are massively hurting Virginia &amp; Maryland where most region federal employees live &amp; major % work too, pay rent &amp; tax &amp; almost all expenses. My point is clueless people think Trump is hurting just DC when tyranny did that damage post WorldWarII.
@JohnJHance @PrivacyAttorney DC citizens have always been hostages of the tyranny, denied #DCstatehood, which is why DC pop crashed -42% since World War II, now -22%, while region pop up &gt;300%, as federal HQs &amp; employees fled to suburbs. Full vote suburbs are taking an absolute beating under #TrumpShutdown.
@JohnJHance @PrivacyAttorney No, DC citizens are obviously hurting very badly as a likely top 10 US state in terms of federal employment, my point is DC citizens require statehood to have voting say to end this crap, while massive % of DC Federal jobs base &amp; federal employees fled tyranny over DC to suburbs.

DC statehood uses 1 US Congress law, so 1 legislature simple majority. Amendments=39 legislatures &amp; super majority
@PrivacyAttorney DC citizens without #DCstatehood don't have US Senators to fix broken US Census reports on employment &amp; federal funding, but people will keep quoting wildly wrong CFFS reports on Federal spending in DC even when US Congress banned them years ago. I don't have energy to refight it
@PrivacyAttorney I can't refind current correct US Census data on DC citizens working for Federal Gov vs US Census on Federal jobs in DC (non-DC citizen commuters &amp; DC citizens combined), because it takes hours, &amp; articles which do correctly remove commuters quickly get burried in sea of biased.
@PrivacyAttorney My repeated points here: 1) malicious voteless DC citizens deserves say, 2) stay factual, 3) don't double count full vote commuters hurting very badly as DC citizens, because DC deserves their own vote, not lumped in MD&amp;VA, 4) massive Federal jobs base fled DC because of tyranny.
@PrivacyAttorney I think you are using different stats, biased articles using bias stats about full vote region commuters who work in DC but aren't taxed in DC, bring bagged lunch so rarely even pay to eat or drink in DC, so not really part of DC proper, vs DC proper citizens % working federal.
@JohnJHance @PrivacyAttorney Not disagreeing DC is profoundly hurt by shutdown, especially as full vote federal worker commuters into DC sometimes do spend money in DC, but region is hurting more as countless federal jobs fled to full vote suburbs to side step vote theft, while DC pop is harmed by vote theft
@PrivacyAttorney Incorrect. DC isn't even top 5 states in terms of % of population working for Federal government, but likely in top 10 states. What is offensive is DC citizens have no say at all, requiring #DCstatehood to remedy.

@daveweigel @SeanMcElwee @washingtonpost @SenGillibrand @TheJusticeDept If Trump/Sessions/DoJ spitefully invalidated the referendum as reported, then its pro #PRstatehood result should be validated, placing #PRstatehood completion ball exclusively in US Congress hands.

@daveweigel @SeanMcElwee @washingtonpost @SenGillibrand @TheJusticeDept Although Puerto Rico ran statehood referendum election anyway, &amp; it passed, Trump's DoJ slow rolling ballot design approvals allows the DoJ to claim referendum invalid.

@HMSPitts All US wars use ordinary US law to exercise optional &amp; revocable US I-8-11 war powers. US citizens of DC are under optional &amp; revocable tyranny powers of US I-8-17, by 1801 US law. DC is 4th national capital, but 1st JimCrow voteless. DC bill is 3rd BRAC (~1846&amp;1946) &amp; statehood.
@HMSPitts Example tweet calling ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny over US Citizens of DC so southern conservatives can keep stealing 2 US Senate &amp; 1 USRep votes for selfish partisan gain, so normal, that troll claims removing vote theft some how treason!		182 US Reps cosponsors this bill.

@BklynCollege85 @drob324 @WaPoExpress @AOC Wrong, but unpacking long reference =tedious, it found 1) DC unequal, 2) court lacks power to 3rd BRAC &amp; US IV-3 statehood by court order alone, 3) US Congress can 3rdBRAC &amp; US IV-3 to restore equality, 4) if Congress modifies "district clause", not remove, then complicated.

@HermanSun3 Example tweet spreading pro ongoing vote theft tyranny lie that tyranny is required, when truth is its like war, an optional power. Law declaring tyranny over DC was ordinary 1801 US law, leveraging US I-8-17 tyranny, twice reduced in area (~1846&amp;1946) with US IV-3 statehood.

Either steals billions of $ in DC property, or forces DC pop entrap new victims of tyranny as buyers.
@JulieAKeller3 @jerblack @WaPoExpress @AOC Flatly untrue, as tyranny over DC is simple 1801 US law, twice BRACed/reduced by area (~1846&amp;1946) by US law &amp; US IV-3 statehood (via merger VA) &amp; the #DCstatehood bill is 3rd BRAC with US IV-3 statehood (38thTime) to found 51st equal US state.

@MissKit14013666 UDC ROTC delayed at least 104 years by tyranny of US Congress. UDC law school delayed &gt;160 years by tyranny of US Congress, compared with neighboring UMD &amp; UVA.
@MissKit14013666 You lie, as if 1964 Civil Rights Act never happened, &amp; all southern conservatives switched from rejecting Lincoln/GOP to rejecting Johnson/Dems, so white south switched to be GOP's racists.		We are done here.
@MissKit14013666 &lt;eye roll&gt; 2 row house sized schools for DC with population larger than 16 states by World War II, paid for by DC citizen taxes, no land grant, no campus, nor library buildings. Teachers Colleges they may have been founded &amp; named as in 1929, 67 years late, but not a university.
@MissKit14013666 @F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @WaPoExpress @AOC 100% of GOP/SouthernConservatives/JimCrow opposes democracy in the US, so anti #DCstatehood. 		Literally the ONLY people supporting US democracy are Dems.		Stop trolling readers with lies.
@MissKit14013666 @F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @udc_edu @dcpublicschool 1851 is founding date of a private institution, so @udc_edu honoring that age &amp; DC's desire for public education, while ignoring the tyranny, is political choice rather than factual #DCstatehood date of legalization of ownership.	Further @udc_edu BA's &amp; ROTC only issued post1966.
@MissKit14013666 @F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @WaPoExpress @AOC @udc_edu Incorrect, private schools are NOT publics, until @DCPublicSchool (illegally, violating US Congress tyranny) purchased (1870s) the 2 normal schools (B&amp;W), highschools where young women were trained as public school teachers. 1920s, liberal US Congress legalized the high schools.
@F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @MissKit14013666 @WaPoExpress @AOC @udc_edu Federal HQs which fled tyranny over US citizens of DC? @uscensusbureau (democracy apportionments), it's key (FIPS) subcontractor @usnistgov, @uspto (for all US verbs), @DeptofDefense Pentagon, @CIA, @NSAGov, @NatReconOfc, @NGA_GEOINT, &amp; dozens of others, with 1000s of jobs.
@MissKit14013666 @F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @WaPoExpress @AOC Example tweet pro vote theft.		A state legislature building, or court house, in any full US state, is mutual ground, but JimCrow vote theft over 700,000 US citizens? That is tyranny.
@F_WRLCK @N1nja_Nick @kerstetterjohn @MissKit14013666 @WaPoExpress @AOC Yeah, no Morril Land Grant College Act 1862 public university with ROTC for &amp; in every state but not DC, because tyranny of US congress hated DC citizens, so delayed founding @udc_edu 104 years until 1966!

@AdamRich84 #DCstatehood is an ideal wedge issue for Dems in US House, Senate, &amp; POTUS races forever, if most Dem US Reps &amp; US Senators &amp; POTUS candidates can be gotten officially onboard as cosponsors of every #DCstatehood bill, because GOP (nearly) universally opposes democracy in the US.
@N8W0LF If national journalists in DC #PalaceQuarter actually supported democracy &amp; #DCstatehood, every US news show would open with "year 218 of vote theft crisis".		Southern conservatives have always punished journalists asking about #DCstatehood, like @Acosta barred by Trump, =silence

@aseitzwald Easiest way to resolve "ongoing tyranny vs restore democracy" fight is Dems &amp; Obama &amp; similar former elected Dems (Biden, Mondale, etc), to force all Dems cosponsor #DCstatehood bill every time to officially record support, &amp; force bills/clotures votes, to wedge issue GOP.
@aseitzwald GOP's "party before country" thinking rejecting democracy entirely, so never help, leaves DC at mercy of winning over Dems, but Dems in 2009 put "country before both equality &amp; party", so DC remains irked with Dems &amp; Obama not following through, not forcing Dems onside, even now.
@aseitzwald Because GOP/conservatives hate democracy &amp; are pro ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny over US citizens of DC, there is obviously almost no support in GOP for US democracy eg #DCstatehood, so only ~4% of DC votes pro GOP/JimCrow vote theft ticket in US Presidential elections.
@aseitzwald Dems &amp; Obama said almost nothing, presumably to paper over this "JimCrow tyranny vs US democracy" chasm inside the Dem Party, to get as much done as possible those 2 years, despite such chasms, to use as much Dem unity as possible while it lasted, getting ACA etc instead.
@aseitzwald @councilofdc DC citizens, overwhelmingly &gt;90% Dem for US Presidents, are frankly irked with Dems &amp; Obama for not trying a vote on pure #DCstatehood bill to simply "out" all the pro JimCrow US Senators, both GOP &amp; some Dems, to utterly reveal the hate based politics of those US Senators.
@aseitzwald So DC retains its non-binding, proposal making only, tyranny fig leaf, pretend city legislature @councilofDC, established in 1973. DC has a Mayor who can't veto actual legislation, just these non-binding proposals.		Only US Congress, as tyranny over DC, creates &amp; revokes DC laws.
@aseitzwald 2009 "compromise" bill proposed incremental reduction of JimCrow vote theft tyranny over US citizens of DC, so no US Senators for DC, kept "3/4th persons Amendment" US #23A 1961 over DC, no state governor or legislature, no actual local government mayor (w/ veto) nor legislature.
@aseitzwald #S160 2009 passed despite Dem Baucus &amp; Byrd nays, but Ensign R-NV tyranny amendment, to gut all local DC gun control, had poison pilled this non #DCstatehood bill, as DC hates gun violence deaths in DC.		With pure #DCstatehood bill, no gun nut amendment can force House to reject.
@aseitzwald Actual full #DCstatehood bill 2009 died quietly behind closed doors, rumored Dems clearly didn't have the votes because too many Dem Senators support JimCrow vote theft, so instead Dems tried #HR157 #S160 2009 bill, only US House voting rights for voteless DC Delegate, &amp; failed.
@aseitzwald @NBCNews reporter @aseitzwald tweets that US Senator @ewarren D-MA's #2020 US Presidential campaign broadcast email pro #DCstatehood which was rumored first only went to DC citizens, actually went to her nationwide email list!	Screen grab photo of Warren's email.	#DCstatehoodNews

@HouseBlueDogs are a profound worry for #DCstatehood 2019, as a major % sided with 100% of GOP pro ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny over US citizens of DC in 2017, refusing to cosponsor #HR1291 2017.		#BlueDogs have 24 US Reps.	8 incumbents cosponsored 2017 &amp; 2019.	10 no both.

@DailyCaller @DailyCaller embarrasses itself employing slave owner E Publis/Madison's Federalist 43 arguments	1) ancestors can sell heirs into forever inherited inferiority,	2) majority can do same for lawful minorities,		dead give aways of DailyCaller bias, especially post US #13A #14A #15A.
@DailyCaller Virginia got only VA contributed lands back from US Congress tyranny over DC in 1846/1847, but in 1946 Virginia stole DC's DCA airport built on land clearly not in VA since 1632 MD charter, BRAC reducing 1801 DC tyranny area, creating US territory &amp; US IV-3 statehood merger VA.
@DailyCaller Virginia contributed lands to 1801 DC could not legally return to Virginia, but area attempted it in 1846 to defend genocidal rape culture slavery. In 1847 US Congress slave state pols legally returned it VA by reducing DC tyranny zone specified in 1801 law, &amp; US IV-3 statehood.
@DailyCaller Under US Constitution era, US has had its national capital in voting areas, NYC, Philadelphia, &amp; proposed CityOfWashington PrinceGeorgesCo Maryland, all before DC was created as a tyranny, further 2 chunks of 1801 DC were reduced to ordinary US territory &amp; US IV-3 merged Virginia
@DailyCaller @dailycaller article anti #DCstatehood is so badly researched it doesn't know which year DC was established &amp; immediately placed under ongoing JimCrow vote theft tyranny backed by federal violence, 1801 not 1790, nor names 3 of 4 voting US national capitals under US Constitution.

@Newarkguy1973 @ElNuevoDia #DCstatehood is ready, been so for generations (at least by population since 1860 US Census), but conservatives always strangle #DCstatehood efforts &amp; bills ever since, so DC citizens worked for decades to officially record support of US Reps via cosponsoring, &amp; it shows here.

@politicalseason @kateirby @AmbassadorRice @EleanorNorton 4C) the 1946 chunk of DC territory was DCA airport runways built on land fill in the Potomac River, clearly never in Virginia since the 1632 Maryland Charter, yet Virginia stole it, using federal tyranny powers to BRAC it from DC &amp; US IV-3 statehood to force merge it into VA.
@politicalseason @kateirby @AmbassadorRice @EleanorNorton 4B) the 1846 chunk of DC, Alexandria Co DC (but now Arlington Co VA &amp; old town part of Alexandria Town Co VA), contributed by Virginia to DC in 1801, rejecting DC in 1846, used BRAC &amp; US IV-3 statehood merger in 1847 to legally restore statehood, a merger called "retrocession".
@politicalseason @kateirby @AmbassadorRice @EleanorNorton 4) pro ongoing JimCrow tyranny lie rejecting that 2 major prior BRACs of tyranny over DC (~1846&amp;1946), reducing 2 chucks of DC land to ordinary US territory &amp; US IV-3 statehood merged those chunks with Virginia, prove BRAC &amp; IV-3 #DCstatehood is entirely legal &amp; 2x proven.
@politicalseason @kateirby @AmbassadorRice @EleanorNorton 3) pro ongoing JimCrow vote theft lie rejecting 37 US States have been created from US territories using US IV-3 statehood, so promoted to join the equality of now (13+37=) 50 US states.

@politicalseason @kateirby @AmbassadorRice @EleanorNorton Example pro JimCrow vote theft tyranny talking point	1) rejecting US Constitution power for tyranny over a national capital is optional, currently using 1801 tyranny US law to activate US I-8-1, like war is optional, specific laws, declarations of war, activate I-8-11 war powers.

@DCist Given how important bikes on transit is to assure egalitarian access to housing, employment, &amp; opportunity, there are likely ways to do this more safely at rush hour, given the fence &amp; trip hazard badly placed bikes can be, especially at rush hour &amp; emergencies. Removing seats?

@udc_edu &amp; @DOES_DC infrastructure academy training DC drone operators, truck drivers, rail line maintenance workers, rail operator, general aviation workers, fixed wing piloting, all might make sense in Millwood but Martinsburg WV &amp; Hagerstown MD both look much stronger sites.
As MARC Brunswick line has many trains per day, 25 miles from Harper's Ferry WV to this site is more important but still an immense distance for most DC gov uses. Working animal breeding &amp; training, such as dogs &amp; horses might be a logical use. Or dorms for intermodal training?
If the nearby Shenandoah River water is drinkable, &amp; legally drawable, the best use for such rural mansion site is disaster relief center for millions of DC region people fleeing urbanized DC if ever attacked. But emergency is not an ongoing business model paying for the site.
Although this 87 acre Millwood VA site &amp; historic mansion between FrontRoyal &amp; Winchester VA with I-66 (~12 miles from Front Royal) &amp; NorfolkSouthern main line rail (btwn FrontRoyal VA &amp; HarpersFerry WV) access from DC, it's unclear if DC gov could use this site well. #Ideas4DC https://t.co/A9gb8qm85n

@andygr @SolomonYue Assuring automatic / birth right US #VotingRights for US citizen overseas (all DC, &amp; "never resided US" children of US citizens of states MT ID UT TX MO AR LA MS AL FL IN MD PA NJ), is the only path forward for Republicans Overseas seeking actual US tax reform for US overseas.
@andygr @SolomonYue Clearly automatically voteless US citizens, of DC &amp; "never resided US" children of US citizens of states MT ID UT TX MO AR LA MS AL FL IN MD PA NJ, should want "no tax" as they are voteless &amp; not represented, to enforce "no taxation without reps", but voteless can't do tax reform

@andygr @SolomonYue Given DC has long (said to have) had highest pop % current &amp; former state citizens/residents living overseas, ahead of any US state, (although many fled voteless DC to full vote suburbs of DC in Maryland &amp; Virginia), DC is the logical state to recruit for any overseas tax reform.
@andygr @SolomonYue That's an amazingly asinine reply, rejecting founding US principal of "no taxation without representation" has 2 parts, 1st US #VotingRights &amp; then 2nd US taxation (fed &amp; state), so fails to embrace US citizens of DC &amp; default inherited US state citizenship for voting overseas.

Maximizing US air cargo market's use fuel efficient rail &amp; trucks, even hyperloops, is a major priority for DC citizens needing both economic opportunity &amp; fighting climate change. Mil cargo &amp; #AirForceOne decoy flights would help the nation. #Ideas4DC
For transatlantic flights US-Europe, a DC Sovereign Wealth backed B747-8F air cargo company (with defense contracts too), would have to use Providence RI TF Green PVD airport or Boston MA Logan BOS airport for rail &amp; truck transfers, ideally adding Portsmouth NH &amp; Brunswick ME.
Getting US law to restore Amtrak Express charter air cargo on high speed rail (ACHSR) would be difficult. 		EuroCarex in Europe would ideally provide air cargo on high speed rail (ACHSR) to rail gateway airports in Cardiff Wales, Prestwick Scotland, Brest France, A Coruña Spain.
To use private flights to pay for a DC sovereign wealth backed B747-8F air cargo company would best use shortest flights to more fuel efficient rail &amp; trucks, but requires a DC gov purchased &amp; improved rail gateway airport, ideally "2W5" Maryland Airport, &amp; US law @Amtrak Express
But the cost of new B747-8F aircargo airplanes is mind boggling $400mil, so unless USDoD @DeptofDefense pays for all of the @dcang113th B747-8F air cargo idea, unlikely, DC sovereign wealth would want to build a profitable private defense air cargo company, like Evergreen &amp; Atlas
B747 crews (pilots, maintenance) would be primarily trained by @dcang113th (&amp; @udc_edu) who would lease &amp; use planes in emergencies, eg US natural disaster response moving existing #DCGuard MPs. But by painting the airplanes similar to VC-25/B747 #AirForceOne adds decoy flights.
DC should build a sovereign wealth fund backed B747 air cargo firm, moving aircargo (fresh flowers, produce) from Miami to DC for rail &amp; truck to US north east, &amp; EU-Boston for DC via rail, painted to look like VC-25/B747 #AirForceOne with @dcang113th leases, to confuse spotters. https://t.co/I2LJH5f45p

@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 @MayorBowser @dc_osa @DCcolonist @councilofdc @fgarciadc @SenMDBrown @fgarciadc &amp; @SenMDBrown both host shows funded by #DCstatehood commission so suggested the unknown song writer explore coming to their shows to promote his voting rights song, rather than weirdly keep trying to strong arm politicians. The song writer was NOT @HeightRoyal.
@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 @MayorBowser @dc_osa @DCcolonist @councilofdc After protracted #DCstatehood Commission budget wrangling, a song writer (unknown name) got up &amp; demanded (again) #DCstatehood Commission be required to use a song he wrote &amp; therefore pay him!? Amazingly awkward. Slightly diffused by @fgarciadc &amp; @SenMDBrown show host interest.
@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 @MayorBowser @dc_osa @DCcolonist @councilofdc Although @V4DC2 is wildly irked by council rejecting "Douglass Commonwealth" &amp; duplicating "Washington" in state name, so city &amp; state address line on mail would stupidly read "Washington, Washington, D.C.", none of the name complaints mentioned it.
@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 @MayorBowser @dc_osa @DCcolonist Ann Loikow joins many people on naming of DC problem. "New Columbia" was replaced by @councilofdc with "The State of Washington Douglass Commonwealth". Loikow was deeply critical today.
@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 @MayorBowser Beverly Perry @DC_OSA spoke about current efforts.	1) She is overly optimistic about getting 13 GOP US Senate votes for cloture, &amp; 4 GOP votes for passage.	2) mentioned kiosks, but no data on usage &amp; eyeballs/tax $, nor adding kiosks to DC Union Station (WAS), DCA &amp; IAD airports.
@NPPendleton @DCstatehood51 So far most important issue is commission dispute over too small 2019 budget for #DCstatehood commission itself &amp; desire for 2020 budget expansion, &amp; @MayorBowser suggested exploring reprogramming (=budget expansion) process mid year 2019.	#DCstatehoodNews

@MayorBowser As biggest concerts now use center field island stages, several dedicated passages to center field with full turf &amp; soil covered cellar trap doors would be best, 1) one for moving celebrities &amp; crew, 2) emergency services to audience, eg removing injured &amp; arrested, 3) utilities.

@Zachary_Israel @EleanorNorton @NancyPelosi @RepCummings @OversightDems Of the 2017-2018 @OversightDems, only @RepDeSaulnier #CA11 hasn't yet repledged to cosponsor 2019-2020 #DCstatehood bill, so should be gotten immediately by @EleanorNorton.		Committee unbelievably has a 2017-2018 hold out, @repjimcooper #TN05, who should be removed from same.
@Zachary_Israel @EleanorNorton @NancyPelosi @RepCummings @OversightDems assignments are still fluid &amp; unpublished. If @RepCummings can whip enough votes from @OversightDems, #DCstatehood bill could get out of committee, to US House floor. This would give @EleanorNorton &amp; #DCstatehood supporters the chance to hold all Dem Reps to task.
@Zachary_Israel @EleanorNorton @NancyPelosi @RepCummings Assuming the 19 GOP/vote theft aligned incumbent Dems will stay that way, is a safe bet. This means #DCstatehood bill 2019-2020 requires every single other Dem US Rep now, amazingly unlikely, especially among the ~40 flips.
@Zachary_Israel @EleanorNorton @NancyPelosi @RepCummings We need to whip US Rep votes 1st, getting all Dems we can to cosponsor, to assure 218 votes yes.		Roughly 238 Dems, w/ 117 repledged, ~44 not yet repledged, 19 incumbents never cosponsored, 18 new Dems in holds, &amp; ~40 flips to Dems. 238-19=219, so we need every possible Dem vote.

@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @UDCLaw @UMDLaw @UVALaw DC's best public school (of 39 ranked DC publics), DC's "School without Walls", ranks only 22nd best (of all) high schools in the DMV region, &amp; 179th best public US nationwide	By comparison @SidwellFriends ranks 2nd best in DMV, behind public @tjhsst_academic (2nd best public US)
@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @UDCLaw @UMDLaw @UVALaw But those are only the best of @DCpublicschools, as there are 2 DC high schools ranked C+, 12 ranked C, 7 C-, 2 D+, 1 D, 7 below even that rank (or F), so total 8 DC high schools are in A/B vs 31 C/D/F range.		But DC private schools utterly outperform best DC public high schools.
@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @UDCLaw @UMDLaw @UVALaw Niche dot com ranks @dcpublicschools 10th out of 11 school districts in the DMV Region. Of public schools in the region, Niche ranks each of DC proper's best public high schools in 2 ways, a grade &amp; overall rank, so A+ (9th place overall), A (36, 42, 47), B (68), B- (75, 86, 88).
@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama @dcpublicschools @udc_edu @UDCLaw was maliciously delayed founding for &gt;160 years after @UMDLaw &amp; @UVALaw founding in the 1810s!	DC had more people than the smallest US state &gt;100yrs, &amp; 6 private law schools before DC was allowed by ongoing tyranny to have a public law school, purchasing bankrupt Antioch!
@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama @dcpublicschools @udc_edu Morrill Land Grant College Act 1862 passed to educate, &amp; ROTC US Army in every Union state for US Civil War.		4 year liberal arts &amp; ROTC @udc_edu was uniquely &amp; maliciously delayed founding 104yrs after Act despite US Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, &amp; Cold War!
@ChelseaClinton @SidwellFriends @MichelleObama If DC citizens were freed via #DCstatehood, ending ongoing vote theft tyranny over US citizens of DC, DC citizens would rapidly improve @dcpublicschools &amp; @udc_edu, but federal pols hide from the ongoing DC tyranny problem by sending their kids to private schools	#DCstatehoodNews
@ChelseaClinton DC citizens are liberal &amp; pro value added, so support our education market including superlative private schools in DC, allowing families to invest even more in their children, eg @SidwellFriends where my sister, mother&amp;aunt, cousins, &amp; @ChelseaClinton @MichelleObama's kids went.
@ChelseaClinton @ChelseaClinton applies nearly universal rule of keeping politicians' minor children out of debate, but there's a major exception, as DC citizens are kept JimCrow voteless, denied #DCstatehood, pols are not just sending their kids to best privates, but forbidding quality publics.

@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht @USPS @UPS @FedEx #RailCopyBus lines can also easily provide emergency back up if day time rail is ever disrupted.	Likewise #RailCopyBus lines can be regularly added to smooth peak rush hour if rail excessively congestion &amp; can't economically meet demand, but requires dedicated bus lanes downtown.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht @USPS @UPS @FedEx Developing #RailCopyBus lines, exactly duplicating rail mass transit for overnight service, same line color/name, shared named stops, builds up Transit Oriented Development density &amp; 24hr services at stops, &amp; trim expensive rail hours to expand rail maintenance for flawless rush.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht @USPS @UPS @FedEx #PAER uses high ticket price for valuable time saved compared with numerous competing transit modes, &amp; massive riderships, moving many people on each train for many different flights, to fund #PAER.	#ACHSR &amp; #LAER trains instead act like 1 flight, sharing HSR rail infrastructure.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht @USPS @UPS @FedEx PAERs would help cities offer Long-haul Airport Express Rail #LAER, using rail, when it works, to move all passengers on 1 flight to a rail gateway airport closer to the flight destination, chipping away air fuel needed while growing high speed rail, eg swapping flights DCA &amp; BWI
@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht PAERs would not just help improve existing Amtrak passenger trains, but reopens AirCargo on High Speed Rail #ACHSR, historically called Amtrak Express, between @USPS @UPS @FedEx sort hubs at airports, or rail gateway airports for transoceanic flights, replacing many flight hours.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton @SkysailsYacht Standardizing high speed rail &amp; HSR electric power can free each US city to build Premium Airport Express Rail (#PAER) connecting downtowns &amp; airport, with trains every 15,20,or30 minutes, while sharing locally improved right-of-ways with longer distance HSR trains, subsidizing.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton #SkySails @SkysailsYacht (when patents expire in 2030s) can provide massive reduction in carbon fuel for ocean shipping. US can majorly improve shipping routes, using tail wind in each direction across Atlantic &amp; Pacific Oceans, with coordinated fast rail to move freight in US.
@EleanorNorton @Princeton If #RenewablesCarbonFuels can be made cost competitive with fossil fuels, renewables can scale extremely rapidly, displacing fossils &amp; serving all legacy carbon fuel machines, &amp; makes collection of atmospheric fossil CO2 for sequestration massively more affordable. R&amp;D required!
@EleanorNorton #RenewablesCarbonFuels capturing atmospheric CO2, breaking it into CO using @Princeton Cobolt catalyst, can make most hydrocarbon fuels, plastics, &amp; amonia based fertilizers &amp; cleanser, but fossil neutral. Driving down the cost of such renewable carbon fuels requires major R&amp;D.
@EleanorNorton #WindCarRecharging is best for private electric car recharging at home over night, best capital use &amp; cost recovery.		#RenewablesVirginMaterials using renewables to make energy intensive excavations &amp; virgin construction &amp; container materials eg virgin FE Al Cu Pb glass brick etc
@EleanorNorton #SolarCool &amp; #WindHeat are best renewable energy model for building climate control, because they fail gracefully minimizing batteries, but require R&amp;D, financing, &amp; legal reforms.

@JBurchDC John Dingell @JohnDingell's proposal for abolishing the US Senate sharply undercuts #DCstatehood, because our/DC's 3 Electoral College votes, usually signifying 2 US Senators &amp; a US Rep, is the strongest precedent showing we in DC are not Maryland, but a partial US state.

@diamonde @offbeatorbit DC was entirely voteless from 1801-1961 until 1961 US Amendment #23A restored one election, US Presidential elections.		DC was 19% - 34% black from 1800-1940, only becoming &gt;50% black in 1960.		DC got its first partial US voting rights when it became majority black.
@DC_Vote @MayorBowser (Does this quote have context, because the talking point is usually that #DCstatehood is not Democratic Party issue, but rather a US democracy issue, so the missing capital D &amp; "Party" above makes this quote extremely contradictory to usual quote, so likely a typo by @DC_Vote)
