@ThomasKMilward @deuce4922 As much as I love to bag on the Seahawks, I actually think it’s a decent, no-risk move. And it terrifies me.

Two weeks ago, @OtherWillJames reported on the death of a homeless man in Tacoma during the snowstorms, possibly due to exposure. This is Kelvin Ibirithi's story.

@MartyRCampbell Yep. And I imagine it was quite awkward. 		For Tacoma journalism history buffs, The Reporter was The Voice before the folks at the *other* Voice forced a change, and Pandemonium before that. Jeff and @MattYoungmark did a lot of good work in this town.
Jeff Daniel gave me my first paid writing gig at The Tacoma Reporter back in 2000, writing about music when I was 20 - and too young to get into most clubs. He took a chance on a kid working at the lumberyard, and I'll be forever grateful for that. RIP, Jeff. https://t.co/cu9tzEUv0o

@seanrobinsonTNT It seems highly contradictory to me, but what do I know?
@seanrobinsonTNT As for waiting until 2020 to elect a mayor (if it was to pass this November), Swanson worries that voters would be inundated with presidential politics and not paying attention. Strangely, he's *not* worried about low-turnout and a lack of public vetting if the vote is April 23.
Dean Johnson, as of tweet time, remains the wild card. It's solidly 3-3, with Dean stuck in the middle. Should make for an interesting night for @herald_allison.
This is the explanation Swanson provided. For context, Swanson has long supported an elected mayor position, but has been moved into the strong mayor camp because that's what Kastama and Jacobsen support.
The only explanation I've heard - and, to this columnist's ear, it's not a great one -- is that waiting until November for a public vote would then mean electing a mayor in a presidential year of 2020 if it passes. To me, given higher turnout, that actually sounds like a plus. https://t.co/hU8ysPj6LF

To unpack: A BNSF investigation determined what everyone - aside from the railroad - already seemed to know. The trees were on their property.		However, since the private property owner/tree cutting company misled BNSF, according to Melonas, they might now face consequences.
Melonas also reiterated Thursday that BNSF was originally led to believe the trees were on private property.		“The party responsible (for the cutting) had indicated that the trees were off BNSF property,” Melonas maintained.
UPDATE: BNSF spokesman Gus Melonas says a site investigation today determined the trees were, in fact, on BNSF property. According to Melonas, "BNSF internal police and claims department are determining next steps, which could include fines, penalties and possible cleanup." https://t.co/lIZPx6hc9M

@ThomasKMilward Makes sense, right?
@deuce4922 @ahammsportsgeek Indeed. I guess that’s my point.
@deuce4922 @ahammsportsgeek Ok. So where to five AFC West championships, two Super Bowl appearances and one Lombardi trophy rank in the hierarchy of this evaluation?
@ahammsportsgeek In a way, I think this is also reflective of the critique I’m making. How many of the great QBs of the past would have survived in today’s instant-analysis environment? Elway surely had his share of lousy, 5-INT games as a young player. No one gets any time anymore to develop.
@ahammsportsgeek Maybe. But he also hasn’t landed anywhere else since being cut, which tells you something, no?
@ahammsportsgeek These days, I don’t know - but that’s my point and my criticism. Three years ago he was a genius. Now he’s apparently terrible. The truth is clearly somewhere in between.
@ahammsportsgeek He bombed on Lynch - a decision any number of GMs would have made had he not - and everything after that has been in trying to regroup. And he hired a young, overmatched coach two years ago.
@ahammsportsgeek Of course. Like I said, he deserves criticism, especially at QB. I just think saying he deserves to be gone ignores the body of work, and that critique is more about the instant-analysis sports culture than anything else.
@ahammsportsgeek He’s 3-years removed from a Super Bowl title and building one of the best defenses of the modern era. But go on ...		He deserves criticism, especially at QB, but to act like the franchise has been mired in futility for a decade is weird. We have a very short attention span.

@anniemused Very true. But the “it’s a regional issue” excuse can also be a copout. Fact is, there are cities creating transitional and supportive housing, and lots of places taking outside the box approaches to do it.
@jasonjgauthier In the most polite tone possible, you missed it. https://t.co/ZNhAD0keZ4
Finally, finally: One could argue that what the city has *really* done here is opened an expensive new shelter that’s full every night, and then used that expensive shelter as justification for passing anti-homeless enforcement laws. https://t.co/bv1K11ukxl
Finally, the city’s new idea - to close the transition site in ‘19 and move residents into new or existing shelter space - is optimistic at best. And that’s a kind way of putting it. https://t.co/bv1K11cJ8L
The city’s “it’s hard” take is true, and patience is deserved, but it also kind of ignores that the plan originally called for a phase three - which, again, was creating temporary housing. That hasn’t happened. https://t.co/bv1K11cJ8L

@DebbieCafazzo @MelissaSantos1 I see what you did there, Cafazzo.
@GritCityMissfit I hear that too, now better than before. But at the risk of over-analyzing, I would argue a person's "no" should be respected regardless of the restrictive sexual &amp; social mores contributing, &amp; deconstructing that oppression can be done in tandem to taking no for an answer.
@GritCityMissfit OK. Fair enough. I see your point as it relates to the "neighbors might think" line. But I just don't hear it like that. I hear it as an ode to aggressive sexual coercion and as a man - or "wolf" as the printed score often depicts - refusing to take no for an answer.
I know this is our history, of course, but it was still jarring. Not suggesting we erase it, but we do need to acknowledge and reckon with it.
On the same note, I was listening to “the Beach Boys” station the other day on Spotify (don’t @ me). Nearly every other song, at a minimum, contained something coercive or blatantly patriarchal.

One thing to clarify, I suppose: "Design features," in this case, mean things like, say, establishing a curfew or banning pets. Richardson's amendment did away with any talk of that. At least at this point, as it relates to the budget ordinance.
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

@Ironhead334 @BasalygaAlex It'll be interesting to see how history views Elway choosing Joseph over Kyle Shanahan. I hoped for the best at the time, weary of the Shanahan history. Now? Looks incredibly dumb.
@Ironhead334 @BasalygaAlex Oh yeah. He's garbage.
@Ironhead334 @BasalygaAlex Disagree. Hiring Joseph was a mistake, clearly. And one could argue sticking with him this year only added to it. But, as a GM, he's also won 5 AFC West titles, two AFC Championships, and 1 Super Bowl. He's earned some leeway, but it's evaporating quickly. Next HC hire is key.
@BasalygaAlex @Ironhead334 He's made mistakes, plenty of them. But I don't think he needs to go, at least not yet.		Still, feels like a looooooooooooong 33 months, doesn't it?

@kalegilmore @TroyRenck Agree. Which is why, in this situation, it's on the coaches. VJ made desperate, fearful decision all game (see: 62-yard FG) that cost us the game. Now, I will say that I don't exactly trust our o-line to pass block or not hold at this point either, but VJ blew it. No doubt.
@kalegilmore @TroyRenck I’m not a Keenum apologist, but I think this one comes down purely on the coaches. They had a distance in mind for field goal range, they achieved it, and they instructed QB to huddle up and call a run to set up McManus. Don’t think Keenum has the freedom to overrule that.
@kalegilmore @TroyRenck If this is a sincere question, in this scenario it's coaching. Case had already moved them into field goal range, including two 4th down conversions. Not his call to play it safe from there.		That said, if you're trying to suggest Rodgers is much better than Keenum ... I agree?
I agree. I also think that little of our o-line, sadly. If game comes down to trusting the o-line - w/o Paradis - or McManus from 51, based on what we’ve seen this season, I think you can make an argument that McManus is safer. Still, it’s definitely an indictment. https://t.co/dAV1Hq6eF4

@DerekMYoung As perhaps you can tell, I just finished it and have a lot of THOUGHTS!
@DerekMYoung I couldn’t help but be shocked by the way a politician with so much baggage --  legitimate, criminal baggage (allegations of sexual assault) – became President, and how easily that was for Clinton to get past. Mind boggling. But – again – it probably shouldn’t be.
@DerekMYoung On the other hand, the administration's stupid, paranoid reaction to all the scandals fed the beast. And - more importantly - the way Jones, Lewinsky and Broaddrick were dismissed and smeared was just despicable. There’s no way around it.
@DerekMYoung I mean, did anyone at the time *really* care about Paula Jones or Monica Lewinsky? That’s an honest question. If they did, they feel like the minority, at least in retrospect. Politically, they were used as a means to an end.
@DerekMYoung Was there a lot of garbage, lobbed purely for political purposes? Absolutely. Vince Foster? Whitewater? Mostly nonsense. And that all led to the Starr Report – which still feels like the culmination of something misguided and acutely partisan, from the get-go.
@DerekMYoung One of the things the series did for me was exposing how complex it all was, which - again - gets lost in the fuzzy pop culture memory.
I hear this all the time. Must-read. https://t.co/2AKjByIO3w
@DerekMYoung Oh, and of course it’s stomach churning to look back at just how absolutely horrible Monica Lewinsky was treated at the time. I’d like to think we’ve learned a lot from that, but I fear we haven’t.
@DerekMYoung Finally, appreciating how all the scandals tied together - the stupid ones and the real ones - really made me appreciate the complexities of the time, and took it well beyond the kind of pop culture recollection that many - including myself - had before listening.
@DerekMYoung I also found the feminist reaction episode absolutely necessary, especially today. The ongoing debate about consent, and what that means when the power dynamic is so clearly skewed, is essential in understanding how society has evolved, and how far we have yet to go.
@DerekMYoung A few other thoughts on this season and why it’s a must-listen (because it’s top of mind):		As much of a punchline as it has become, I was fascinated to learn about the real - and even more ridiculous - argument Clinton made about the definition of “sexual relations.” Good Lord.
@DerekMYoung Just listened to the Broaddrick episode last night. Truly appalling. I was in high school when it happened, and wasn’t paying close enough attention. I feel stupid for buying into the Clinton narrative - a guy largely under Right Wing attack at the time - for as long as I did.

What Puyallup is doing is “cracking down” on a problem it is actively making worse. 	-30-
BUT when a city is unwilling to step up and actually provide services – and goes as far as to actively try to push service providers from the city (which is precisely what Puyallup is doing) -- you can miss me with your high-minded nonsense.
In closing, the author is correct that no one should be forced to live in unauthorized encampments. No one really disputes that.
Again, delusional. The city has an obligation to help all residents experiencing homelessness. Period.
More, it reeks of the callous self-righteousness that got Puyallup into this mess in the first place. The message: children and families deserve help (they do), but THESE people – the chronically homeless – do not.
There IS a faith-based operation that runs shelters in churches in the winter and Helping Hand House – which provides housing for families &amp; children. Both are good, but pointing to Helping Hand House as an example of Puyallup’s generousness – as electeds regularly do - is spin.
There are no full-time shelters for the chronically homeless in Puyallup, and based on its actions it’s clear the City Council doesn’t want any – despite the homelessness crisis impacting quality of life in the city year round. Again, delusional.
As a local attorney told @OtherWillJames, the move is akin to creating “a procedural gauntlet that will make it impracticable to locate another facility anywhere in the city."  He’s right.
Barring an unforeseen shift, Puyallup’s City Council will soon move to restrict homeless service providers to a mere 18 parcels in the NW corner of the city.
Here’s what I have argued:	Puyallup’s elected leaders, at every opportunity, have either refused or tried to make it as hard as possible for organizations to provide services for the city’s chronically homeless population. In this, they’ve been consistent. And it’s delusional.
Huh. Interesting take. Since I'm referenced in it, a few thoughts (thread):		First, I agree people should not be forced to live in unauthorized encampments. I've never argued otherwise.

@iamcee_eff If you’re into deep dish, Katie Downs on Ruston Way is fairly solid. The pies are smaller, but stacked. Again, you can call in an order if you don’t want to eat there.
@iamcee_eff Hank’s has an underrated pie. Plus, if you haven’t been yet, it’s an awesome neighborhood bar. You can call in an order if you want take out.
@iamcee_eff The Cloverleaf is the go-to classic Tacoma pizza place. I recommend eating there, if possible. It’s best as fresh as possible.

It's where I grew up, with all that entails. I cow-tipped there, learned to drive there, hung out by the river when I shouldn't have been hanging out by the river there, played HS football there, had my first kiss there, etc.
I grew up in Puyallup, from 5th grade on. I went to Hilltop Elementary, Edgemont Jr. High, and graduated from Puyallup High School. I have friends there. My fantasy football draft will be there this weekend.
A few thoughts on this ...		I wouldn't be shocked if there's a sense out there that I *enjoy* ripping on Puyallup's misguided approach to homelessness. I'm sure some columnists would. 		I don't. https://t.co/yj7lfh11G5

@justincamarata They all count. But that’s also why I don’t get too caught up on the number, which is just stupid simple math. What we need is for people to realize producing journalism isn’t free, it has value, and that it’s worth paying for. If that connection gets made, we’re good.
@justincamarata Trying to respond to your previous tweet, but it’s not working for some reason. Stand by ...
@Marguerit Personally, I think the reason I don't like to get too caught up in a magic number is because the underlying principle is what's important. Do you want local journalism in Tacoma and Pierce County? If so, pay for it. It's not free.
@Marguerit It's worth noting this number is a massive simplification. It's what it would take to fund our newsroom, essentially as it stands. Doesn't take into account things like building costs, etc. And, you know, growing.
@Marguerit We've mentioned this plenty of times. Here's what the plan looks like. Our number is smaller, like 18K digital subscribers, if I recall correctly. We currently have just under 4K. We could probably do a better job articulating this in the future. https://t.co/8jU48p9Ygq

@Snowdog97 Not really. I will say that our plan moving forward relies on digital subscriptions. That’s the path that’s been laid out for us, and we’ve been given a number of digital subscriptions it will take to make the newsroom sustainable.
Please consider subscribing to The News Tribune. It's not just a subscription, it's a statement that you value the importance of local journalism in Tacoma and Pierce County. 		If you need some prodding, I explained the situation on FB yesterday. https://t.co/i68T4nD1fa
@AnagramPress This is not a column about whether artists should be paid for their work, and the idea of blaming artists for not "solving" homelessness is ridiculous. However, given the depths of the homelessness crisis, I do think it's valid to question how the city spends its money.

Cool also said "city outreach workers are working with the campers to connect them with services."		Of course, worth noting those services are extremely limited (at best).
Just received info from TPD regarding efforts to clear the homeless encampment on @TacomaHousing property:		72-hour vacate notices posted Sunday. If people fail to vacate property after 72 hours they would be in violation of the city trespass ordinance, according to Loretta Cool.
@mcdpeach @UniteThePoor @TacomaHousing The column also discusses how THA is now trying to partner with the city and service providers to create a new temporary space to help address Tacoma's homelessness crisis.
@mcdpeach @UniteThePoor @TacomaHousing This is a completely unfair take. The column discusses how THA worked for weeks trying to accommodate the camp, even offering part of its property to make it work, but was ultimately unable to due to its growing size &amp; code/legal realities. How many orgs/businesses would do that?
A homeless encampment has been growing on @TacomaHousing property, on Hilltop. The agency reluctantly signed a trespass order recently, meaning people will be moved along, once again. Where will they go? That remains the Q Tacoma has no answer for. https://t.co/MwMjH6S8Ty

@NotTheGoonie @Occupy_NWDC I'm not a fan of the influence of $ in politics. And part of the issue with the way it's reported - here, as a donation from a lobbyist that works on many issues - can work to conceal things. Still, I think the insinuation of a smoking gun here is premature, at best.
@NotTheGoonie @Occupy_NWDC Well, largely speculating here, but from previous conversations my guess that they'd point out that Thompson works on many issues, not just with GEO. For instance, they've been involved in issues related to the Puyallup Tribe and Port of Tacoma, among many others.
@True_Tacoma @CallaghanPeter That is one reason I found this response telling, as it relates to a part-time Council &amp; its reliance on advice frm the CM, City Attorney, etc. https://t.co/FLTUMusAyT		Also reminded of @seanrobinsonTNT here, and his timeless take on "sometimes the people want what they want."
@True_Tacoma I’m also skeptical of this claim. 		This episode reminds me of @CallaghanPeter, and the significant influence of the City Manager and staff. Largely, the “hands tied” assertion relies on the legal opinions expressed to Council by said individuals. Opinions, of course, vary.
Column: Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards has been under fire for the city’s reaction to NWDC protests. On Friday, I asked her to respond. https://t.co/7WbuDEQP19
@Marguerit @nate_bowling At the same time, I don’t think the insinuation that Woodards is in the pocket of Geo because she took a donation from a lobbyist with ties to a number of things is intellectually honest. So that’s why it’s not included in the Q&amp;A.
@Marguerit @nate_bowling As others have noted, Woodards didn’t take money directly from Geo. She got a max donation from a lobbyist that works for Geo and many others. I don’t like the influence of $ on politics, and I’ve been consistent in pressing the Council to do more to support NWDC protests.
@mcdpeach @Redefine_Tacoma @CityofTacoma @OccupyICEPDX To be clear, this is me speculating, not quoting or attributing to the mayor: I think there’s a hope that the Health Dept would do the inspection, and that if it finds violations, it would give the city agency to react.
@True_Tacoma @Marguerit @nate_bowling Forgive me if I’m mistaken ... but doesn’t dude also rep for the tribe, among others?

This is true. Throw in the increasingly common practice of requiring tenants to earn 3X the rent, and the problem just mushrooms. https://t.co/PgqztlquG3
So ... what are we going to do about that?
Essentially, even though apartments like the Tiki and others aren't ideal, they serve a population with no other options. And as places like this get gobbled up and gentrified, not only do we have a shortage of affordable housing, but we're actively losing more of it.
Folks who can't rent anywhere else -- because of fixed incomes &amp; other barriers -- end up here because there simply aren't decent options for them. And now, w/ the market hot and developers eager to make $, they're increasingly subject to displacement and at-risk of homelessness.
We know we need more affordable housing. @TacomaHousing and others have the numbers on this. In that void, places like the Tiki and Hudson Court - which aren't great, often have clear problems, and are often run by unresponsive owners - serve a vulnerable population in need.
One thing that has become clear to me over the last two weeks - which is obvious, actually -is the role apartment complexes like the Tiki and the newly renamed Hudson Court Apts play in filling Pierce County's need for affordable housing. https://t.co/eGe4qHoPf9

This is absolutely right. Without the pressure and organizing tenants and the Tiki undertook, none of this happens. https://t.co/Ql6gWpwt1A
That said, even w/ more time, for someone like Sarah Howe, living off of $790/month in SSI, or Matt Yablon, living off of $1000/month in SSI, coming up with moving $ - even with more time - is going to be nearly impossible without help. That's why relocation assistance is needed.

@pmocek I think they added it today, in part, to allow people to speak. Personally, don't see evil in that. Would the alt be better? I know CMs were talking about a resolution last week, and all of this was inspired by Tiki Apts story. Fair to say it should have been on radar sooner.
@pmocek Think council legitimately wants to help. Woodards told me moments before the meeting: "There’s not a council member that doesn’t believe we have to do something." But, yes, rules say no public comment on items not on agenda, so had to put something on to allow folks to speak.

@rachelgloria @just_shelter I read Evicted earlier this year, for @nate_bowling's podcast. The similarities between the book and what's happening at the Tiki Apartments were very much on my mind while writing and reporting.
Third, on a larger level: Pressure Tacoma to enact laws better protecting month-to-month renters. Other cities have them. Tacoma needs them. My understanding is folks will be attending next Tuesday's City Council meeting, and this should be one of the things they call for.

@RobMcNairHuff I've been called worse.
I am delighted to see, however, that Jason Rantz apparently follows my work.
Of course I don't want people living outside. That's literally what this is about. Criminalizing life-sustaining activities for people experiencing homelessness doesn't help that happen.
That's why the city's law making camping in public places is problematic. There's nowhere for folks to go with shelters full, and fining them, sending them to collections, putting things on their record isn't helping people get off the street.
Fact is, there are not shelter beds available for these people. The weekly stability site report from the city shows an average wait list of 51 people, and says an average of 66 people per day are being  turned away from Nativity House.
Point was not to suggest folks experiencing homelessness should be allowed to stay on private property. Point was to highlight that there were people in this particular camp on the waiting list for shelter at the Transition Site. That was the kicker of the column.

As the @metparkstacoma press release notes, "Tanner was a lifelong Tacoma resident who in 1978 became the first African-American federal district court judge in the Pacific Northwest."
At the same time, the @metparkstacoma board also voted to rename Marine Park along the Ruston Way waterfront in honor of U.S. District Court Judge Jack Tanner - a cause championed by Metro Parks Commissioner Aaron Pointer.

Again, this is wrong. There is literally no reasonable path to citizenship for most DREAMers. Most options involve either going back to a country they've never known, for many, many years, then applying for a Visa that's expensive or not guaranteed. Or marrying a US citizen. https://t.co/rJMNts7H4Z

A few things: 	No “corporate” masters tell us what to report 	There’s separation between the edit board &amp; the newsroom	Your attacks display a lack of understanding about how this works	Baseless flame-throwing is why your tactics get rebuked https://t.co/56iDdyiuyN
@Adam_Ashton @zeeck Back before I sold out, of course.		In my current role, my accomplishments are more modest: I've made the same woman from East Pierce County cancel her subscription three times (at least judging by the voice mails).

Hopefully it goes without saying that the need for volunteer groups to serve meals at Nativity House - while not as critical as it was/is during X-Mas and New Year's - is ongoing. So don't limit your volunteer interest to just the holidays.
Just spoke with Bill Bruno from Nativity House. He described outpouring to yesterday's column as "wonderful." Said his phone has been ringing nonstop. Sounds like he has Christmas meals handled, but still has a need surrounding New Year's. https://t.co/hQVXj4hQLK

@deuce4922 @ThomasKMilward I have this weird tendency to suck air with this horribly disgusting whistling effect. I've tricked myself into believing it only happens during recorded interviews. Because, otherwise, I'd hate myself.
Hi Timothy: There is contact info for Bill Bruno/Nativity House at the bottom of the article. My guess is he's swamped this morning, so be patient. And if the holidays are filling up fast, please still consider volunteering. https://t.co/7qhwQ1JBOG
"Hostile architecture," in my opinion, is a much for fitting description than "site hardening," which is often what I've heard efforts like these described as - like when Tacoma trucked in all those boulders to deter encampments near the library. https://t.co/4nIYJPu4h4

Went to Ikea and missed the Seahawks game. How’d it go?
@True_Tacoma @Jaime_Smith Ok, well then, that would seem to be a conversation about the word “posturing.” I think it’s clear a person or politician can posture - or present themselves in the best possible light - in support of something they also genuinely believe in.
Back of an old @NewYorker magazine found in my daughter’s room. https://t.co/2FdyFgpmwa
@DerekMYoung @seanrobinsonTNT @Jaime_Smith Been painting my daughter’s room all day. Might be the fumes talking. But don’t think I implied anywhere that positions were purely political. What I wrote was that fights w/ Trump also provide political opportunities, and as long as they’re worthwhile, the distinction is moot.
@Jim_Brunner @Jaime_Smith I mean, I don’t know. I feel like said bots could have spoken more to Inslee’s purely, 100%, unquestionably, without-a-doubt altruistic motives. But I’m a stickler.

@Jaime_Smith OK. I'm a fan of the 800+ words that follow, but if we're going to dissect the headline let's at least do all of it. Doesn't say it might be "about" posturing. Says it might be posturing, and "That's OK."
@Alison7613 @thenewstribune It's a joke. I love Christmas. Not wild about poinsettias, however,
This is an endorsement of Inslee and Ferguson's #NetNeutrality fight, among others they're waging against Trump. "Battles worth waging on behalf of WA voters," as I write.		If suggesting these fights are also politically advantageous makes me cynical, guilty as charged I guess. https://t.co/xo632w2KGA

@cmpn In your defense, I was walking the dog while tweeting. Dangerous combo. 		While I don’t know the solution, and it terrifies me, I just can’t stomach the idea of giving up on it and accepting this as status quo.
@cmpn I don’t know how to walk that back, but I don’t think it’s a nebulous thing.
@cmpn I agree with all of that. Except for the nebulous part. I think how we arrived here is the result of a years-long, orchestrated R campaign to demonize the opposition to the point that they’re more evil than child molesters.
@cmpn I don’t think you can really end partisanship. But it’s troubling to me that, apparently, for many Alabama voters the political “enemy” is worse than an accused child molester. That can’t be a sign of healthy democracy.
To be clear, we’re still in a whole lot of trouble. Alabama voters had a choice between an accused child molester and a Democrat. It was damn close. Our partisanship is toxic.

@seanrobinsonTNT @True_Tacoma Agreed. This is actually one of the elements I appreciate about CM Walker Lee’s proposal.
@seanrobinsonTNT @True_Tacoma I gotta say: I think quickly and consistently enforcing the rules for public comment would go a long way. And I also don’t see the value in some of the attacks that get thrown around.
Ok. Fine. I’m going to just be blunt. 		You don’t shut down Citizens Forum because some anti-LNG, anti-methanol commenters are jerks. https://t.co/FPerVLSai2
@KennyCoble @True_Tacoma The need to find ways to increase the spectrum of residents represented is real. But I will say that plenty of issues over the years have brought communities of color to Citizens Forum.
One thing to remember regarding tonight’s Citizens Forum debate:		A disdain for particularly vitriolic and nasty commenters shouldn’t make the decision for you. That’s not what this is about.
@KennyCoble I think it’s working exactly how it’s supposed to. It’s giving people a guaranteed opportunity to show up and get an audience with the full City Council. Now, should we do things to expand that opportunity? Absolutely.
@KennyCoble It’s seems pretty clear to me. There are DEFINITELY issues with Citizens Forum. I just don’t think you’ve got to replace one with the other. Especially when the critique I always hear is “You don’t listen to us.” It’s a bad look, if nothing else.
That’s even a tough sell on me. https://t.co/fJeS0wOfOn

@KateReports It's almost as if the entire middle section of the country, outside of major population hubs, voted for Trump. Weird.
@KennyCoble @izenmania Well, young or not, late voting trend (at least since 2011) has been documented. (As the ballots I'll be dropping off today attest to.)
@izenmania @KennyCoble My understanding is since 2011 the trend has increasingly moved toward late voting, ballot box use. Hunch is we'll see a (relative) spike.
@KennyCoble @izenmania Which is typical, given 2016 was a presidential election year and voter registration efforts were in high gear. But, yes, more voters = good
@KennyCoble @izenmania Keep in mind turnout isn't measured against population. It's measured by registered voters. And that's up about 44,000 since 2015 ...

I've argued for killing the August primary before. It still makes sense. https://t.co/mCJRWDJIb4
Still, and I can't stress this enough: 20% turnout stinks.
So ... if we again hit 20% turnout, with nearly 44,000 more registered voters, it'll mean more people voted.
Another thing to consider: There are just over 499,000 registered voters this year. That's up from just over 454,000 in 2015.
That's on pace with previous off-year primaries. 2015 was 20.54%. 2013 was 19.89%. 2009 was 19.23. 2011 was weird - 27.16% turnout.

@erikhanberg Anyway, appreciate the dialogue. Column format likely makes it seem like I'm more hardline than I actually am. Do see value of local action.
@erikhanberg To be clear: I'm all for agitation. I want agitation that leads to change, and doesn't potentially make people's lives worse in the process.
@erikhanberg Unless fed policy changes, I don't foresee a shortage of places willing to be home to immigration facilities. Do you?
@erikhanberg Yes. But we're talking about people's lives w/ this one.
@erikhanberg It is poorly defined. And it's complicated here by our reliance on PC Jail. But, as to policy, it can mean what we want it to on the books.
@erikhanberg It does if people just end up in places like Georgia, with no support, visitation, etc.
@erikhanberg Refusing to cooperate with the funneling of people into facilities like the NWDC, and standing up for the rights of those who end up there.
@erikhanberg The things that will be most effective in ending injustice federal policies on a local level are some of the things I mentioned ...
@erikhanberg What helps redo federal immigration policy, and what actually helps the people caught in the system? Alone, closing the NWDC does neither.
@erikhanberg Initially, I was in your camp. But I've come to believe any local action needs to be grounded in two primary goals:
@erikhanberg First of all, a toast to our 2+ year run of agreement. We'll always have that.

@seanrobinsonTNT @Roopee Biggest factor is going Eastside Community Center math depends on $3 million from Portland Avenue site. But there's definitely nuance.
@nate_bowling @Roopee @seanrobinsonTNT This is unlikely, I would say. But, like I said, surplusing does require unanimous vote.
@seanrobinsonTNT @Roopee Good news for community is surplusing requires a unanimous vote of board. They'll have to show no net loss of services to get that.
@seanrobinsonTNT @Roopee Let's talk. What I know: Metro Parks plans for one center per quadrant. New Eastside Center is it. MP says there's no $ 4 programming at 2.
@Roopee @seanrobinsonTNT This is the general sentiment of those I've spoken to, and it's hard to argue with.
@Roopee @seanrobinsonTNT Most likely outcome, imho: Community center goes, green space stays. But we'll see.
@seanrobinsonTNT @Roopee It's all related. And all related to fancy new Eastside Community Center.

Example: "Authorities say an encampment under the freeway - known as the Dystopian Hellscape - has 15 residents." News vans just arrived.
Even if you're just stealing the name from another encampment.

@Roopee Sure, but I do 100% of my gawking at the questionable life decisions of people I knew in high school via Facebook.

One of the irritating aspects of this election, which I'm just coming to terms with, is the continued accuracy of the Halloween mask poll.

@Roopee True. But, at the same time, kids are one of the very few places I find legit hope these days. So there's that.

So Donald Trump is President-elect. On the bright side, I kicked ass at fantasy football today. Pros and cons.
@deuce4922 Good point. That was insensitive of me.
Facebook is really at its best when you randomly discover some dude you went to junior high with is now a male model.
@Jim_Brunner I do. Not sure what I did to not get a "kiss my ass," but I'm certainly questioning my decisions.
"Kiss my ass, Matt Misterek (TNT editorial page editor). "		Must say, I feel a little left out.

@TomPatrickRyan1 I believe that's what the plan is. I think the beauty is in the frequency and reliability. No traffic &amp; constant service.
@Amelia_Oly @KennyOcker On the bright side, you've got Old School Pizza.
@TomPatrickRyan1 I think it's supposed to be in the 90-minute ballpark.
@KennyOcker Didn't necessarily say I'd retire from *this* business. Could be slinging legal weed by then.
In related news, can't wait to ride light rail to Seattle when I'm retired.
Pleasantly surprised by success of ST3. Feared the size would scare off voters. In this instance, voters proved wise and forward thinking.

@TacomaTransit That's generous.

Went home to be with my family.
Writing a column. And by "writing a column" I mean nervously refreshing Twitter like the fate of the world depends on it.
Serenity now.
Working from home fun: Just did a phoner while kitten attacked me, drawing blood, and sick toddler smeared banana all over the coffee table.
We got this, basic human decency.
