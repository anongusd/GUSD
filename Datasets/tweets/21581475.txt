God has revealed in His Word many privileges he's given believers. But too many Christians are unaware of them. 		-Thomas Constable
It's impossible to overestimate the power and importance of our Bible.
Being a Christian doesn't mean you don't fall short. It means that you admit you do fall short, and need Christ to save you.
