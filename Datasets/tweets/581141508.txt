Owner Jera Stewart started baking at age 9 &amp; hasn‚Äôt stopped since. Jera gained recognition in the community by selling baked goods at festivals &amp; food trucks. In 2012, she became a licensed home bakery &amp; in 2017 Jera‚Äôs Heavenly Sweet opened in the One SeaGate building in Toledo.

FCA‚Äôs investment will help bolster our highly-skilled workforce, ensure future innovation, &amp; set us on a path to surpass overseas competitors such as  China, which produces 96% of all EVs; all while taking steps to combat climate change and keep automotive jobs in Northern Ohio.
Since 1941, Toledoans have not only built Jeep into one of the most popular vehicle brands in the world, but also into a household name synonymous w/ American grit, determination, &amp; ingenuity. Jeep is in our soul. It‚Äôs our tradition &amp; we want to see it succeed far into the future
With rapidly changing driver preferences toward electric and other environmentally friendly alternatives, Jeep‚Äôs domestic investment in vehicle electrification is critical, especially as SUV‚Äôs and trucks become American consumers‚Äô vehicle of choice.
While electric drivetrain components will be built in Michigan, FCA‚Äôs investment in electrification will almost certainly benefit Jeep‚Äôs production platform and vehicles produced in nearby Toledo, such as the Wrangler and the upcoming Gladiator pickup truck.
FCA's announcement is exciting news for fans of the iconic Jeep brand. Electrification of Jeep vehicles is a necessary &amp; important step to future-proof the brand &amp; the tens of thousands of Toledo-based manufacturing jobs that have supported Jeep since WWII https://t.co/rScPoW3K9J

Deeply concerned by President Trump‚Äôs declaration of a national emergency at the southern border as justification for building a wall. A wall won't protect the most vulnerable points on the southern border: ports of entry.
Past national security emergencies have involved hurricanes, wildfires, hostage crises, epidemics and public health emergencies and terrorist attacks posing grave and immediate risk to American lives. The situation at the border clearly falls short.

Tonight we heard more of the same from @realDonaldTrump. Ohioans deserve better.

On the Great Lakes, use your voice help me educate this Administration and my colleagues on why we must protect our Great Lakes.
On the opioid epidemic, we have reached a tipping point. Local resources are crushed. We must work toward a better solution in Congress.
On the harmful Medicaid cuts in #TrumpCare, it is a moral issue for our Nation and we must defend Medicaid.
On #TrumpCare, every one who actually works in health care opposes it. Nurses, hospitals, doctors...
Some of our retirees are getting their pension benefits cut significantly. And that is just plain wrong.
We have to work together and you have to use your voice to help hold this Administration accountable. https://t.co/1csGThQab8

"You sign what's put in 	front of you [or] they don't bring you chickens, you cant make 	your mortgage payments &amp; you lose your farm &amp; home"

The industry has been rigged against farmers for decades. I met with chicken farmers in 1999 w/@RepJohnLewis &amp; others http://t.co/r0X4K1LOHD
Processors "retaliate against growers who attempt to speak out about the abuses or organize with other growers...for better contract terms."
This is just wrong. Local monopolies avoid competition bet'w processors &amp; drive farmers into debt or out of business https://t.co/PB0tVpBFi0
Contract poultry farmers earn about $0.34 for each chicken they raise. Corporate meat processors get $3.23 for same chicken. #TheMoreYouKnow
US #farmers report unspoken agreements among #chicken processors not to compete w/each other, leaving farmers w/few options and no leverage.
