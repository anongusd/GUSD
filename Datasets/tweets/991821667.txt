Thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the thrilling new technological developments under way.
AR allows the creation of new innovation hubs outside of traditional tech geographies
RT @eggerton: Thune on AR: Policymakers should not unnecessarily stifle innovation.
"We need to make sure our regulations aren't choking our innovation" -@CoryBooker
Re job training: What we're seeing with AR is an ability to train, communicate, and collaborate from afar. Big potential for job creation
AR and MR have tremendous potential beyond entertainment. We should encourage continued American innovation &amp; investment in these areas.
We encourage the Committee to give AR/MR space to grow, and avoid redundant/unnecessary #regulation that would have a chilling effect
Supreme Court left little doubt that our foundational laws governing speech are well-equipped to address emerging tech like AR and MR
ENGINEERING: Instead of looking at a 2-D screen, users will be able to stand in the space as they create it before a single brick is laid
BUSINESS: Mix of entertainment, information and work applications delivered by AR/MR has potential to improve every workspace in America
EDUCATION: One can imagine a class learning about the Civil War and seeing a digital Abraham Lincoln standing before students
HEALTHCARE: Already today, AR is being used to address pain management and rehabilitation needs of pediatric burn victims
As seen with #PokemonGO, this new &amp; promising evolution of games integrates learning, exploration and physical activity like never before
ENTERTAINMENT: Unlike traditional games best played from living rooms, AR/MR can be suited to many locations - indoors and out
Government should embrace &amp; empower these #emerging #technologies by allowing them to grow so they can reach their full potential benefit
The possibilities for the application in the fields of #education, #healthcare, #science, and #business are bountiful
4/4: Mixed Reality - Contains elements of both VR + AR. Using lens/goggles, user can see both real world and virtual world tied together
3/4: Augmented Reality - Technology that overlays software-generated images over the "real world." Think Pokemon GO and NFL 1st down line
2/4: Virtual Reality - User typically wears a headset/goggles and is fully immersed in a "virtual world"
1/4: Important differences b/w Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)
When it comes to balancing children's welfare, parental responsibility &amp; freedom of speech, AR/MR fits neatly w/in existing legal frameworks
ESA's members are committed to privacy and data security protections &amp; providing tools to make informed choices about products
