@kturner43 I know. When I go download music in the computer room, Penny cries outside the door, so I make her sit in my lap surrounded by  4 cats and if she reacts, I grip her mouth and threaten to put her on the outside of the door. Works pretty well.
@kturner43 My computer room doubles as a closed door cat room until the yappers and I go into the big bedroom, close the door and watch TV. The cats have the rest of the house and back porch until the next morning.
@kturner43 If you said no, I was going to ask if you would be interested in babysitting Penny (a/k/a Britney Bitch) when I go see mama. Penny hates cats more than Libs hate Trump. For real.
