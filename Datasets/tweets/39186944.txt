@JG_glove @LvlyWords @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems 63% number is a lie.		Immigrants produce many billions more for the economy through taxes than they take.		How can they enter legally when they are being denied asylum at the border, which is how you apply legally?
@andieAn99846851 @LvlyWords @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems Opioids are legal.
@andieAn99846851 @LvlyWords @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems the major crisis is opioids, over prescribed legally in the US. 		Fentanyl is 20x more addictive than heroine. 		If the cartels have upped their games and murderous rampages, why are we shutting down legal immigration from the Mexican families trying to escape them to the US?
@theoxlox @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems The president had a solution to DACA and wall funding delivered to him by bipartisan support, and he didn‚Äôt sign it.		Since he started ‚Äúrenegotiating‚Äù with Congress, the offer for wall funding had dropped from $20billion to less that $1.6billion.
@theoxlox @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems Nobody wants open borders.
@spitdabit @andieAn99846851 @LvlyWords @GOPChairwoman @SenateDems Correct. Fact.
