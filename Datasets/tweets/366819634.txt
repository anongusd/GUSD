@ABC Shame on ABC for airing this BS. Zero concern? Really Ivanka? She's so audaciously clueless &amp; entitled its pathetic &amp; frightening. The Trump Crime Family is so corrupt, they simply think they will walk away into the sunset. Praying for Mueller &amp; orange jumpsuits for all.
@ABC I find this insulting to the intelligence of the educated &amp; informed American people. Trump's base believes absolutely EVERYTHING they see on TV (mostly FOX) because clearly they don't read nor care to learn the truth about the low-life they helped to elect along with Putin.

@Shareblue This is THE perfect set-up for her brother, Erik Prince &amp; his company, BLACKWATER to come to the rescue! Wouldn't be surprised when she/Trump propose/recommend independent "contractors" provide security to schools across the country....then BLACKWATER gets the contract.
@Shareblue Waiting patiently for the handcuffs.
@volleygirl407 @GOP @realDonaldTrump too stupid to realize that may be the case...
@dougmillsnyt @IvankaTrump @PressSec Anyone surprised the DIVA is wearing RED (for Russia) or just the typical narcissistic Ivanka statement? She'll be selling that Chinese made suit on her website for $2K tomorrow. She is a disgrace to USA. GO AWAY!

@PressSec @IvankaTrump @_KyleMack Its frightening &amp; embarrassing these clowns represent the USA!
@PressSec @IvankaTrump Ugh! P---------- delegation? They are American misfits. So unfortunate for us they represent the USA. We must VOTE BLUE in November to oust the Trump Crime Family, his corrupt admin &amp; the rest of the corrupt &amp; unAmerican GOP!

@amjoyshow Simply vote for his DEM opponent. Time to get the NRA supporters out of government.
Let's see if the NRA owned GOP care more for their NRA blood money than they do American children. BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS &amp; BUMP STOCKS NOW! @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @VP https://t.co/XmDey3M0ME
@GOP @VP How do you propose to do so without banning assault rifles &amp; bump stocks? Common sense indicates you stop the problem where it starts...military weapons in civilian hands. You won't because the NRA OWNS the GOP. Stop accepting NRA donations. You have blood on your hands. Shame!
@EdKrassen @PhilFrantz NRA &amp; NRA funded GOP have blood on their hands.
@MarshaMood @tonyposnanski He's not a leader, PERIOD!
@tonyposnanski He's a disgrace to USA. VOTE BLUE in November to remove him and the rest of the GOP American imposters from our government.
@ForeverLogical So Russians are clearly meddling! That's my read! The Trump Crime Family are so incredibly compromised....just saying!
@OfficialJonZal I believe the man to his right is a Trump plant!
@Shareblue @EricBoehlert Of course he did! These GOP cowards can't stand up to the students because they have blood on their hands. Every one of the NRA owned GOP should return the NRA blood money!
@thehill Unfortunately he will not live. Putin murders anyone that speaks out against him. That is why we have not heard one word of condemnation from Trump!

@JackKingston I am so very proud &amp; thankful these young, bright Americans are standing up to Trump, the corrupt GOP &amp; NRA. GOP cares more for the $$$$ from NRA than they do the American children. These bright children are coming for you GOP &amp; NRA. We need an ASSAULT WEAPON BAN now!
@matthewjdowd Praying for a tsunami!
@Dax_x98 Me, either Dax. Unbelievable. Shame on anyone that feels this way.
@marcorubio You HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS. You are simply a disciple of the NRA. Return the $3 million you received from them. NRA owns you! GOP NRA puppets are a disgrace to USA! VOTE BLUE in November to oust every one of GOP.
@realDonaldTrump MORON DON please do your homework first before you tweet nonsense. Oh, darn, that would require that you read &amp; we all know you don't. You are an utter disgrace to USA &amp; world.

Why can Trump family, Cabinet, &amp; admin abuse taxpayer dollars without accountability? Current examples: Pruitt's excessive travel costs, inaugural funds to Melania's friend (26 mil). I simply can't imagine if Obama ever did anything akin to this abuse!
@Bebes_Scrubs @LilyPotter130 AMEN!

Stop whining and pretend you are our leader for just one day!		IMPOSE RUSSIAN SANCTIONS NOW! @realDonaldTrump
Where's your condemnation of Putin &amp; Russian meddliing? @realDonaldTrump
@DevinNunes @SharylAttkisson I'm also hopeful the BLUE WAVE in November will remove every Russian sympathizer a.k.a. GOP Congressman in our government. You are a disgrace to USA.

READ USA! https://t.co/mxh7JIPDuT
@GiGicmka Putin pegged him as a "USEFUL IDIOT" from the day he entered Russia &amp; praised the Russian oligarchs. He's been groomed/manipulated by Russia for years. Read "The Plot to Hack America" by @MalcolmNance . It reads like a Tom Clancy novel but is not fiction.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS GOP &amp; NRA have blood on your hands. You are all complicit in the deaths of  these children. You are shameless &amp; a disgrace to the USA..
@SenateMajLdr GOP cares more for your NRA campaign donations than you do for the children of America. Shame on every one of you! You &amp; the NRA have blood on your hands. VOTE BLUE in Nvember to oust the American imposters.

@thehill Thank you CNN! Can't wait to see it!
@Dax_x98 Happy you are here to tell your story and share with many that need to hear about your strength &amp; courage to push through it. XO
@thehill FOX NEWS is Russian State TV, oops, I mean US State TV, or both? The Trump sycophants at FOX are frightening...also owned by Russia maybe? In addition to tax evasion, evidence tampering &amp; obstruction of justice, she suffers from over inflated self importance. Sound like Trump?
@NBCNews What about the stats regarding mass shootings and the use of assualt rifles by a person diagnosed with a mental illness?
@Evan_McMullin So yes! Their goal was to support their chosen candidate &amp; create CHAOS in USA. They succeeded, didn't they? Its time to be informed USA,. READ!!!! Read The Plot to Hack America by Malcolm Nance, He is ex CIA Russian counterintel agent. He KNEW it was coming! READ! @MalcolmNance
@politico Seriouusly USA, Pence's opinion vs. Clapper's experience. That's a no brainer. @VP
@thehill Didn't Trump say he would "hire the BEST PEOPLE?" We didn't realize he meant the best pedophiles, the best sexual abusers, the best womanizers, the best domestic abusers. Birds of a feather...THIS is our leadership! VOTE BLUE in Nov to oust these crirminals!

@Hosss63 Hopefully this aberration will NEVER happen again in USA.
@HalmMary @M3RCYS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fox News is comparable to RT in Russia (funded by Russian Gov), specifically national/interrnationnal propaganda TV. I'm thankful that the other US networks are working overtime to provide truth to Americans in  these very scary times. Simply VOTE BLUE in 2018 to impeach Trump.
@GenJohnKelly You are a Russian BOT! This wouldn't have happened if a AUTOMATIC GUN was not involved, fool! It is time for WE THE PEOPLE to stand up &amp; speak out against GOP &amp; RUSSIAN meddling in our government. If Congress won't do anything, WE THE PEOPLE need to do so. VOTE BLUE in November.

@MalcolmNance It's an excellent book. It reads like a spy novel but, unfortunately, the sad truth is that Trump has been "groomed" by the Russians for years. You're the first &amp; ONLY ONE suspected Russian hacking well before anyone else. You, Mueller &amp; FBI are American heroes. Thank you!
@VP @POTUS For a man that PRETENDS to be a Christian, you care more for NRA campaign donation $$$$ than for the safety of American children. You are a coward &amp; a hypocrite. It is time for an ASSUALT WEAPON BAN not guns in schools. VOTE BLUE in 2018 to oust the GOP &amp; impeach TRUMP!

@SpeakerRyan This is the height of hypocrisy! You &amp; GOP are so desperate to be in power, you have turned you backs on the American people to achieve your agenda. EVERYTHING you have done thus far indicates you care only for PARTY before COUNTRY. Shame on GOP. Waiting for the BLUE TIDE in 2018
Yes, that would be DUMB DONNY! Time to get rid of him. VOTE BLUE in 2018!

@activist360 Love this!
@ananavarro The moron in our WH doesn't care about anyone but himself &amp; family. He has reduced the Presidency to an unprecedented low. Sadly, GOP R turning their backs, lying 4 him &amp; totally complicit in the debasement of USA. They are a disgrace to USA &amp; world. VOTE BLUE in 2018 USA! @Potus
@krassenstein DRUMPF is a PIG! He is a racist, bigot, mysogynist, pathological liar &amp; narcissist. It is simply alarming the moron in our WH is a total embarrassment to the USA &amp; world. Even more alarming the GOP is complicit! @Potus @realDonaldTrump @VP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @PressSecSanders

@scott_wheeler12 @jahimes Shame on YOU! The man in our WH is a racist, bigot, mysogynist, pathological liar &amp; clear &amp; present danger to USA &amp; world. Just another GOP fool with head in the sand or up your A--!

@Hosanna71010988 @ToddCarnes1066 @realDonaldTrump Yes, you are in the minority and obviously a racist as well. Crawl back under your rock!
@EdanClay @realDonaldTrump He is TOO stupid &amp; ignorant &amp; confirms it on a daily basis. He is a psychopath, a pathological liar &amp; narcissist &amp; is a clear &amp; present danger to USA &amp; world. GOP senators are now lying for him. It will take years for the USA to recover from this insanity! WAKE UP USA! VOTE 2018!
@GodlessNZ Godless yes, amoral yes, deplorable yes, despicable human being yes, Trump supporter, yes, racist, yes, Need I continue? You are one sick individual. This is 2018? Crawl back under you 1950 rock.
@RepChrisStewart You also stated that "others" in the room (when Trump called Haiti &amp; Africa SHITHOLE countries) said he did not say that, which is simply a LIE. No one but Trump said he did not say it. Others either confirmed it or said they "DID NOT RECALL"! Typical GOP response these days.
@RepChrisStewart I just watched you on @MSNBC. You are a liar &amp; a coward. You know very well Trump is a racist yet you, like many other GOP sycophants will do ANYTHING to lie for &amp; support the despicable man in our WH just so GOP can continue in power. The GOP does not represent American values.

@CyrusMMcQueen I've given him the nickname DUMB DONNY....should I add duck to that?
@CyrusMMcQueen We'll never learn how totally unhealthy &amp; unfit he truly is. I can only imagine his cholesterol &amp; triclyceride levels are sky high because he doesn't exercise PERIOD. He must be a diabetic but is probably on every medication to control all of those issues.

@WalmartNewsroom You don't recall! Shame on you! You are a COWARD, a LIAR &amp; YET ONE MORE GOP SYCOPHANT that has sold your soul to the devil.

@realDonaldTrump Typical lies &amp; FAKE NEWS from the LIAR-in-chief. The Brits don't want U on their soil because U R so disliked &amp; unpopular. Also, the embassy was leased, moron! One would think the "genius" real-estate guy would get real-estate facts straight; guess not when U R lying to your base

@FLOTUS What has happened to the White House Counsel on Women and Girls?
@FLOTUS Why not tell the American people a bit about exactly what you do Melania? We the people would like to know more about your meetings, meetings and more meetings, please. The previous First @FLOTUS44 was active &amp; visible on a daily basis. We know nothing about your activities!

@goldengateblond BAM!
@abhiprofen I am a 64 year old white woman &amp; I am just as angry as you. I am angry that the GOP has turned their backs on the American people &amp; world. Trump DOES NOT REPRESENT the majority of Americans that didn't vote for him. WE ALL NEED TO SPEAK UP &amp; STAND UP. Continue to speak up!

@CNN @PipkinDebbie as does everyone in the world. He is incapable of being a stellar example. He is woefully unfit for the office. Enough is enough. What will it take the GOP House to do their job and begin impeachment proceedings or 25th Amendment. MAGA and impeach him. @Potus @GOP @VP @SenateGOP
@SpeakerRyan @UMW No, I won't listen to a man from a party that has turned their backs on the American people &amp; our democracy. What will it take for you to acknowledge the man in our WH is woefully unqualified, mentally unfit, racist, bigot, mysogynist, pathological liar &amp; danger to USA &amp; world
@BrendaWestcott2 @CallMeFroggy92 @SpeakerRyan @USNavy @USArmy @usairforce Thank you for your service. I totally agree with you. I have to assume however, that many do not want to serve under the maniac in our WH.

@realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS from the pathological liar-in-chief. Shouldn't you be working on "something really special" like your letter of resignation due to your TOTAL UNFITNESS for your position in our WH?
Contact you Senators &amp; Representatives. https://t.co/iwG8gSf0rf
@realDonaldTrump You are so incredibly DUMB. You simply do not understand government, the Constitution, the 3 branches of government, politics, your own policies, ... and yet, you think you are a "stable genius"! You are a pathetic excuse for an American leader. YES, yes, yes, you are a moron!
@MSNBC This admin/GOP could be DUMB &amp; DUMBER III. They are simply an embarrassment to the US. Arpaio had no idea that acceptance of a pardon "implies" admission of guilt. STOP giving GOP morons air time. Its painful &amp; stressful to watch. USA deserves better. This is insanity &amp; shameful.
@PressSec Great Sarah &amp; lying GOP...but what about Sam's Club closures, translating to thousands of layoffs, and OWNED BY WALMART? Please address this in your briefing tomorrow!
@PressSec @POTUS This is hysterical. We the people are confident DUMB DONNY didn't read this! He doesn't read. His attention span is less than my "smart, very, very smart" Beable (Google it). He, you, this admin, GOP are a bunch of shameful, amoral, narcissistic, pathological liars. Karma is...
@WhiteHouse If this was not true, it would be hysterical! Unfortunately, it is FAKE NEWS and "SAD, really, really, SAD" as America's biggest A-hole would say. Time to remove DUMB DONNY, the American imposter from our WH.
@Rosie WHAT? Seriously?
@JRubinBlogger @GiGicmka Yes, DUMB DONNY must go!
@JRubinBlogger @GiGicmka I have decided I will give him a nickname as he has with so many others.

@realDonaldTrump Yes, Donald, your haters are the majority of the American people that are MUCH smarter than you....and we find no need to declare to anyone that we "have a good brain". What moron would make that statement? Answer: YOU, DONALD J. TRUMP!
@realDonaldTrump You are a moron.
Trump has spent 110 days of his 1st year at one of his properties. That translates to approx 1/3 of his time in office on vacation. He has spent more time golfing than Obama did in 8 years! No fake news GOP, just facts! When will he lead USA?He is a disgrace to USA. @SenateGOP

@AndthenIsleep and this is the leader of the USA! Pathetic!
@thehill Yes, it is a crime. Tired of TRUMP's FAKE NEWS. Wake up America. Trump is a pathological liar, narcissist &amp; mentally disturbed. Stand up Americans 	&amp; speak out. Trump is destroying our democracy. VOTE in 2018. Time for Impeachment!
@realDonaldTrump You are a MORON Donald! You have singlehandedly placed our country at risk both internally &amp; internationally. You are so woefully uninformed, unqualified &amp; mentally unfit to lead USA. Waiting patiently for 2018 midterm elections. You MUST GO!

@thehill Simply BS!
@TomthunkitsMind The man is a PIG!
@EdKrassen Trump is a MORON, again, a moron.....yes one more time, a MORON. Has NO BUSINESS in the WH.
@funder DISGUSTING pig! Yet he had audacity to complain about # of times Obama golfed. He has surpassed total # of times golfed in 1 year compared to Obama in 8. Unfit to lead our country. PIG PIG PIG! @realDonaldTrump
