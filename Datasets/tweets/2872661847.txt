RT @intellectulaw: @Linksuperpowers Well Said! #success https://t.co/0hMWWAGt83
If you chase two rabbits, both will escape.
The man who can drive himself further once the effort gets painful, is the man who will win.
To him who is determined, it remains only to act.
As a man grows older it is harder and harder to frighten him.
Failure is the foundation of success, and the means by which it is achieved.
Honesty is the first chapter of the book of wisdom.
Courage is the willingness to accept fear and act anyway.
A master can tell you what he expects of you. A teacher, though, awakens your own expectations.
All the fun is in how you say a thing.
Your greatest asset is your earning ability. Your greatest resource is your time.
The cyclone drives its powers from a calm center. So does a person.
Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure.
The only way around is through.
The ability to concentrate and to use time well, is everything.
You cannot teach a man anything. You can only help him to find it within himself.
Character matters; leadership descends from character.
Character is not made in a crisis, it is only exhibited.
It is the heart that makes a man rich. He is rich according to what he is, not according to what he has.
Do a little more each day than you think you possibly can.
Begin with the end in mind.
There is no way to prosperity, prosperity is the way.
Man‚Äôs character is his fate.
Luck is when opportunity knocks and you answer.
Laziness may appear attractive, but work gives satisfaction.
Human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes.
To enhance the quality of the day... That is the highest of the arts.
The less routine, the more life.
A man‚Äôs dreams are an index to his greatness.
When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.
Worry not that no one knows of you; seek to be worth knowing.
Circumstances do not make a man, they reveal him.
Attitudes are contagious. Are yours worth catching?
He that can have patience can have what he will.
If at first you don‚Äôt succeed, try, try, try again.
Success is a staircase, not a doorway.
God‚Äôs delays are not God‚Äôs denials.
Long-range planning works best in the short term.
We have all the light we need, we just need to put it in practice.
It is not length of life, but depth of life.
Reputation is what men and women think of us. Character is what God and angels know of us.
It‚Äôs better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.
Don‚Äôt give up at half time. Concentrate on winning the second half.
There is as much risk in doing nothing as in doing something.
It‚Äôs not failure, but low aim is crime.
A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
Success is never certain. Failure is never final.
Adversity brings knowledge, and knowledge wisdom.
There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.
Dream big and dare to fail.
RT @cindyn: Just "he"?! üòâ @Linksuperpowers
You are what you think about all day long.
Always do right - this will gratify some and astonish the rest.
People can cry much easier than they can change.
Self-determination is fine but needs to be tempered with self control.
Dare to risk public criticism.
Accountability breeds response-ability
Failure is not fatal. Only failure to get back up is.
Do it, dump it, or change it.
You aspire to great things? Begin with little ones.
Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
The difference between try and triumph is just a little umph!
The only real failure in life is the failure to try.
Keep your thinking right and your business will be right.
You are bigger than anything that can happen to you.
Anybody can do anything that he imagines.
The important thing is not to stop questioning.
To think is to practice brain chemistry.
Capital isn‚Äôt scarce, vision is.
Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting.
There is nothing lost or wasted in this life.
Half of being smart is knowing what you are dumb about.
A day of worry is more exhausting than a day of work.
Diligence is the mother of good luck.
What you can become, you are already.
What you can become you are already.
Never let yesterday use up today.
He who is afraid of asking is ashamed of learning.
Successful leaders have the courage to take action while others hesitate.
Be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.

Calmness is the cradle of power.
Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance.

You have to have your heart in the business and the business in your heart. -Thomas J. Watson
We aim above the mark to hit the mark. -Ralph Waldo Emerson
