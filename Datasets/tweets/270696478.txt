@dougdirt24 I don't see Reds sacrificing an additional yr of club control by having Senzel on the opening day roster. That would be stupid.
@KristySwansonXO so laughable. Obama got a pass for 8 yrs despite being embroiled in 1 scandal after another, while Trump continues to be chased by a rogue special counsel despite no evidence of wrongdoing. insane!
@JacobAWohl She won't retire til she's dead or a Dem is in the WH whichever happens first.
@LanceMcAlister No idea why they are pursuing Realmuto. Makes no sense. Doc has said the same. Praying he winds up elsewhere.
@charliekirk11 excellent points Charlie! if Trump gets funding but signs off on DACA amnesty, Dems win. Dems are only 1 amnesty away from a permanent majority.
@RobertJohnDavi great points Sir! call the Dems out on their hypocrisy!
@nightengalejr Glad he moved on from Boras! I wish Nick Senzel would do the same.
@ChickLudwig @ctrent Are we assuming that we are going to trade Kemp?
@ctrent Are we assuming that Kemp is going to be traded?
@nightengalejr @ENQSports As active as Reds claim to be in pursuing top free agents, do u believe we would sign one who would cost us a high draft pick?
@pauldehnerjr It's a real shame that the Lions snaked Ragnow one pick ahead of us. The Lions get a guy having a great rookie yr. We get a guy who can't stay healthy &amp; struggles to snap the ball when he is on the field.
@JayMorrisonATH I know it's his 1st yr as Bengals DC, but if the defense continues to play this poorly, do u believe Austin gets a 2nd yr as DC?
@dbongino I don't understand it either. What is so appealing about that fat slob? Tester doesn't represent the values of the people of Montana in the least.
@BrentBozell he'll win big regardless. now he has to go down as 1 of only 3 presidents in history impeached despite having done nothing wrong!
@BrentBozell well, Paul Ryan, who has sabotaged Trump at every turn, is already on his way out, &amp; the Establishment will never allow a conservative to be in the leadership.
how? they have only picked up 2 seats. what the heck happened to remaining 21? https://t.co/6E7sczGtRJ
@SenatorBrakey @ThomasEWoods Praying for you Senator Brakey! Good luck on Tuesday! Brakey for US Senate!
@LanceMcAlister I would rather have Dalton. Not the flash in the plan with a QB who has been gift wrapped great WR's, great RB, all pro TE, elite OL, &amp; great coach &amp; hasnt yet faced adversity. They said the same of RG3 &amp; Prescott. Pass.
@JayMorrisonATH are we looking at the next Aaron Rodgers? this is frightening to watch.
@JayMorrisonATH I predict bengals don't beat steelers again til Ben retires. deep down u know I'm right.
@JimOwczarski From what you're seeing, does our O-Line look much improved from last yr, especially considering Price's snap issues?
@nightengalejr Do see any chance Reds will be able to keep him or slim to nil bc of Boras?
@LanceMcAlister I would rather hold onto him &amp; get nothing then let another team fleece us like with Chapman deal.
@marklevinshow Good question. for instance, what ever came of the Benghazi committee he headed up? no arrests, no indictments, no one held accountable. but he gives great speeches!
@justinamash why do you care? what is so wrong about commenting about an issue he is passionate about? why are you a never trumper?
@ChickLudwig Should be Bailey, but unlikely bc of his contract. Guessing it will be Romano. What do u predict happens, @ChickLudwig ?
@LanceMcAlister ok then
@JimOwczarski If Jake Fisher doesn't progress at RT, since we didn't draft his replacement, who is 1st up to make a play for his job?
@MHartsockWHIO @LanceMcAlister @daytonsports @DragonsBaseball @Reds who could have seen this coming after he was shielded by his coaches &amp; threw just 28 innings his senior yr of HS? Should have taken McKay or Wright.
@vdare @AnnCoulter I supported Ann Coulter-endorsed Greg Brannon in the primary for that very reason.
@marklevinshow despite the fact that Trump endorsed him. Romney is such a back stabber.
@BradThor the nevertrumpers are truly a pathetic group of individuals

@ScottBaio @MrsScottBaio So sorry to hear that. I'll be keeping both of you in prayer.
@RealJamesWoods Agreed! Why does Schumer get a pass for making racist comments? Bc he's a Dem &amp; the judge is white? Unconscionable that he gets a pass!
@ericbolling @KatrinaPierson GOPe is celebrating alongside Dems tonight. Without question.
@kimmieguy @BrentBozell And now we go back to the GOPe sticking their finger in our eye reminding us that only their candidates can win.
@Swordofjanak @Debradelai I believe it's a 2 yr seat, so 2020 unfortunately.
@Ken_Rosenthal So nice of Jeter to trade Stanton for players off the scrap heap while gutting the rest of the roster. I'm sure Marlins fans miss Jeffrey Loria already.
@Ken_Rosenthal That's laughable. Call it a salary dump. The got crap in return. Cashman is laughing hard at garbage he gave up. Sounds like package Reds got for Chapman too.
@GeoffHobsonCin is he blind or in complete denial? Marvin can't be this clueless.
@JimOwczarski I believe this goes beyond injuries. They are giving half effort. They have checked out. Paying customers deserve better.
@JimOwczarski yeah, this one is over. Bengals checked out long before the opening drive of the game. nothing to play for anyways
@JimOwczarski before he went on IR, did you see any improvement from Ross in practice that gave you hope that he was finally getting it?
@JimOwczarski in your opinion, what is the most important thing it is going to take for us to finally beat Pittsburgh every now &amp; then? wait for Ben to retire? new HC?
@BreitbartNews this makes absolutely no sense. declining viewership, poor leadership, terrible decision-making. answer: re-sign him to big money deal.
@BenSasse Flake leaving the Senate can't come soon enough.
@LanceMcAlister it's why for all his talents &amp; successes as HC, that we have no choice but to move on from Lewis. this will never change. too many blown opportunities. plus, there is his inability to beat Pittsburgh.
@LanceMcAlister you think, Marvin? as if that matters any more. #seasonover
@MoEgger1530 ends the same way. very predictable they would have the ball on the last drive, burn out the clock, &amp; kick the winning FG. once again, jerked around for 4 quarters.
@JayMorrisonCMG safe to say end of ML era?
@pauldehnerjr could it have been any other way, Paul? honestly? how many times have we seen this play out?
@pauldehnerjr this game is over. Steelers burn out the clock &amp; beat us with a FG
@LanceMcAlister badly outplayed in the 2nd half. would be really surprised if we could hang on &amp; win this game.
@LanceMcAlister u just get a sense that this game is about to be stolen from us like we've seen over &amp; over &amp; over again. missed opps to put this game away.
@JayMorrisonCMG @LanceMcAlister infuriating how we let them pull that off right before the gun.
@pauldehnerjr I knew it was too good to be true that Brown might not play. Of course!!!
@AnnCoulter the sooner that crooked nose open borders buffoon leaves Washington &amp; retires to AZ, the better. #Flake
@AnnCoulter Evidently it was Pence who gave the assurances to open borders radical Flake.

@realDonaldTrump Jeff Sessions, for all his strengths on immigration, continues to show what a disappointment he has been as AG.
@SenFeinstein like all that time you gave the GOP to read your precious Obamacare bill. LOL. #LiberalHypocrisy
@pauldehnerjr how could we possibly allow Johnny Manziel 2.0 to have the game of his life against us? embarrassing
@pauldehnerjr likely the first &amp; last time we hear the name Cethan Carter again. didn't even help the play, so a pointless illegal block.
@pauldehnerjr Ced happens! #bust
@Buster_ESPN So that's ur way of convincing us that cheaters should be in the HOF? C'mon, Buster, u can't do better than that?
@BreitbartNews What Tim Scott fails to realize is that the unsubstantiated accusations Moore has faced could have come against him as well. Another reason we have the presumption of innocence in America.
@LanceMcAlister fitting that our season will end against Pittsburgh. couldn't be any other way, Lance.
@JayMorrisonCMG out of curiosity, did u support the decision to go with Bullock over Elliott? the guy had a flawless preseason but is also a journeyman, &amp; u see why when he appears to be unreliable.
@LanceMcAlister The day we chose him over Elliott will go down as one of the worst decisions we've made in franchise history regardless of how great he was in preseason. You can't even trust him on PAT's.
@pauldehnerjr The most shocking thing about that play was the accuracy of Osweiler's throw. Since when does Osweiler ever throw a ball on the money like that? Even he had to be surprised.
@pnehlen @SenateMajLdr @SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan @SenTedCruz remember McConnell is still seething over his puppet Luther Strange getting defeated by Moore. I wouldnt put it past Mitch to be behind this.
@pnehlen @SenateMajLdr @SenMikeLee @SpeakerRyan @SenTedCruz really sad to see Cruz &amp; Lee pile on with the GOPe despite no proof of these accusations. have we already forgotten the Left routinely does this: Herman Cain, Clarence Thomas?
@DavidLimbaugh if Moore pulls out, we get Strange &amp; the swamp wins. this has McConnell's fingerprints all over it. it's too convenient. not buying it, sorry.
@aubrey_huff just wanted to let you know as a fellow Christian I appreciate the stance you took today in promoting Creation &amp; exposing evolution for the farce it is. God bless you!
@JFowlerESPN typical Steelers. full of class. #lowlives
@LanceMcAlister Shaw: 3 penalties, the last one the most egregious.
@pauldehnerjr I have no issues with tanking at this point. You can't give one single benefit to winning anything right now. it's over &amp; this team is a trainwreck, which would lead to a 1st rd loss if they were even lucky enough to get into the playoffs.
@JayMorrisonCMG 3 by Shaw
@JayMorrisonCMG has john ross been benched after not running out that play?
@GeoffHobsonCin defense looks lost. aside from pick by Dennard &amp; sack by Geno, this defense looks overwhelmed.
@FoxNews @SenSanders @POTUS says the avowed socialist with ties to the Communist Party. #idiot
@LanceMcAlister is it safe to declare him a bust at this point?
@Local12Skinny Ogbuehi again. Good Lord, he's terrible!
@LanceMcAlister I already miss Marshall Koehn
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump disappointed that Mike Lee joined with the Establishment in condemning Moore. then again, he also pushed for Trump to drop out after access H'wood.
that's an odd way of putting it. what the heck is wrong with him that next season would even be questionable? https://t.co/6JxMu1tkGA
@JimOwczarski Considering the bad play of every member of our O-Line, is it possible to turn our O-Line into a decent one by next season?
@LanceMcAlister a real shame, but we had no choice. he would have taken the $.
@LanceMcAlister headed toward a 2nd straight top 10 pick, maybe top 5
@JayMorrisonCMG how can you allow any team to clean your clock like this on 3rd downs? even the Patriots would not be this good on 3rd downs.
@JimOwczarski they've checked out &amp; as has Marvin Lewis.  right now just going thru the motions.
@JimOwczarski not sure what's worse: getting destroyed by the Jags or making a really bad QB look like a franchise QB?
right, Shazier &amp; his other thug teammates https://t.co/RzxHSeZMis
yeah, he never recovered from that vicious hit. I'll never forget the disgusting smile on Ward's face when Rivers was spitting up blood. https://t.co/wpZlIOR3PY
@MrKCincy @pauldehnerjr forgot about Perry. even Keith Rivers had his moments. just can't believe we whiffed this bad in the 1st rd.
@pauldehnerjr Cedric Ogbuehi is going to go down as the worst 1st rd pick by this franchise since Akili Smith.
@pauldehnerjr there was a time where we actually thought we had a great defense. this team has so many problems on both sides. we do NOTHING right!
@JimOwczarski it's fair to ask: how much has our offense honestly improved since the change in OC's?
@Local12Skinny not sure why Jags fans are unhappy &amp; booing. Green's ejection hurts Bengals far more than Ramsey's ejection hurts Jags.
@pauldehnerjr no deep threat for Bengals now. what could go wrong?
bc we let 14 seconds go before finally deciding to call a timeout? https://t.co/2iSvt29FAI
@pauldehnerjr would have gone 65-70 yards easy. not even close to missing. feels like last week all over again.
@ESPNCincinnati_ wondering why we waited 14 seconds to call the time out
@JimOwczarski it just feels like theyre teasing us. why not just convert the 1st down right away rather than tease us for 3 downs before the inevitable?
@pauldehnerjr how do you allow any team to go 8/9 on 3rd downs? how does that happen? even the Pats could not go 8/9 on 3rd downs!
@JimOwczarski and killing us on 3rd down. pathetic.
@JayMorrisonCMG Do u think this likely puts the game in Bortles' hands, something Jax didn't want to happen?
@ESPNStatsInfo Pederson is such a meathead. why would u throw him a fastball near the plate when u can watch him flail away w/ a breaking ball low &amp; away?
@JayMorrisonCMG do u have concerns about Ross' inability to get more snaps? I know he's been injured, but is he that raw?
@JimOwczarski how do u not get pressure on their QB against an OL that bad? this is unbelievable!
@LanceMcAlister For how long? Clearly Dick won't say altho he did indicate we're going to embrace the suck for a 4th yr in a row.
@FAIRImmigration @politico @seungminkim it's so nice when Republicans work tirelessly to screw their base yet wont move an inch to keep any of their promises, like repealing O'care
@LanceMcAlister so Bengals season is over then?
@LanceMcAlister Honestly,  like u thought the result would be any different? A rivalry would imply each team wins on occasion.
@LanceMcAlister It's now psychological. I don't think they're ever going to be capable of beating them. If anything, they bring out the best in Steelers.
@LanceMcAlister We will never beat them. Just expect same result. Even post-Ben, it won't matter.

@BrianBuckeye @AndRewSmith_77 @mattwhite85 Brian, Im just having a difficult time believing this is best return we could get for Bruce.
@mattwhite85 @AndRewSmith_77 @BrianBuckeye Dodgers &amp; Rangers, both w/ rich farm systems, reportedly had significant interest.
@BrianBuckeye @mattwhite85 @dougdirt24 career yr, allstar season, yr &amp; a half of control w/ reasonable salary doesn't have much trade value?
@AndRewSmith_77 @BrianBuckeye @mattwhite85 do u really believe Dilson was the best prospect Bruce would get us? does that even sound right?
@AndRewSmith_77 @BrianBuckeye @mattwhite85 ok, fair enough, then why not trade him to a team offering a better return?
@jerrycouch4667 @ctrent says the guy with an egg photo
@BrianBuckeye @mattwhite85 @dougdirt24 he was an all star
@thistleton87 @dougdirt24 no argument there. but Detroit gave them 2 months of control as opposed to yr &amp; a half of control of Bruce.
@dougdirt24 when u saw what NY got for Miller &amp; Chapman, it begins to feel like we're not strong returns. even guys on MLB network agree.
@mattwhite85 @dougdirt24 maybe not eligible, but there were better prospects: Conforto &amp; Rosario for instance.
@jameswillis2011 @ctrent the other one would be the small return we got for Bruce today. Mets gave up more for Cespedes last yr.
@jameswillis2011 @ctrent one of the best 3b in game at time, Frazier, &amp; key player (Peraza) was a guy who Atl &amp; LA felt was a utility guy.
@dougdirt24 agree with you, but how can we trade an impact player like Bruce w/ control thru next yr &amp; not get a single top 100 prospect?
@ctrent is it not amazing how Tigers got a better return for Cespedes rental last yr? and NY got for Chapman rental this yr?
@ctrent from what u know, is Jocketty the one who has been calling shots on these last 3 disastrous deals or is Dick behind them?
@dougdirt24 Mets thought so highly of him that they sent him down to AAA twice. interesting how Tigers got more from Mets in Cespedes trade
@LanceMcAlister a complete joke. like Chapman &amp; Frazier deals, Dick/Walt sold low. no way you can sell this as a quality deal.
@ctrent 4th outfielder. if Nimmo is key to deal, Dick made yet another disastrous trade.
@jluckhaupt wasting his service time by having him ride the bench. Dumbfounded as to what Dick's "plan" is.

@pauldehnerjr it will be interesting to see if Mike Zimmer &amp; Jay Gruden get their first postseason win before Marvin Lewis gets his.
@pauldehnerjr why did Pittsburgh get away with not being penalized for Porter being on the field? Isn't that obvious?

@JayMorrisonCMG is it safe to say that the Bengals are truly a cursed franchise?
@JayMorrisonCMG he's right. Burfict &amp; Jones were wrong, but we win if Jeremy doesn't fumble that ball.
@LanceMcAlister yet we thought they would be 1-dimensional?
@JayMorrisonCMG is Pittsburgh selling out against the run bc they don't respect AJ?

@JayMorrisonCMG would the NFL allow us to switch seeds with the Chiefs?
@JayMorrisonCMG can we switch 4 seed with Chiefs?
@MarcusGilbert88 pretty pathetic. real mature.
@razor_michael @MoEgger1530 even if Dalton plays, he'll likely be rusty. I predict Steelers win no matter who is playing QB.
@MoEgger1530 no chance against Pittsburgh. u know it, Bengals nation knows it, betting world knows it.
@JayMorrisonCMG sounds great, but it's fair to ask: how many were playing their backup QB? playing Pitt w/o Dalton is a game-changer.
@LanceMcAlister this is not a funny scenario, Lance. we don't stand a chance against Pittsburgh without Dalton. No chance!
@pauldehnerjr we would be better off with 4 seed facing KC. no chance against Pittsburgh without Dalton.

@MoEgger1530 Cards still re-signed Wainwright, Carpenter,  Holliday, &amp; Molina to long-term deals. Nothing wrong w/ keeping core players.

@LanceMcAlister and that every team, including Reds, passed on Wacha simply bc they felt he didn't have a breaking ball.
@LanceMcAlister Cards aren't geniuses everyone makes them out to be. They were just fortunate that Pujols out priced himself during talks.
@LanceMcAlister I will never dislike Votto's contract bc he is a true superstar u build your franchise around. Glad Reds acknowledged that.
@LanceMcAlister Reds owe it to fan base to at least attempt to keep certain identified core players, like Votto, within certain parameters.
@LanceMcAlister U have a price for your superstar, &amp;, if he goes above that, let him go. Obviously. that didn't happen with Votto.
@LanceMcAlister U &amp; Mo keep bringing up Cards not keeping Pujols. However, they tried to keep him. Pujols out priced him in StL.
@LanceMcAlister I agree with what u said about rebuild. However, Reds need to identify who to build around. Nothing wrong with keeping Votto

@MoEgger1530 I agree! this flawed roster has Jocketty's fingerprints all over it! no manager could win with this roster.
@LanceMcAlister we would be fools not to trade Chapman. he might net us an elite prospect. he has little value on this disastrous club.
@johnfayman @Scott1693 it's sad that Price will get fired for a deeply flawed roster that has Jocketty's fingerprints all over it.
@dougdirt24 just when you thought this season couldn't possibly be any worse than last season. holy cow!
@KyRedsGal one of the reasons I had hope as well was bc we had great starting pitching to keep us in every game. not so much this year.
@KyRedsGal I didn't think 2015 could possibly be worse than last season, but I'm starting to feel otherwise.
@KyRedsGal Agreed! Cueto on the DL would be one of the worst possible things that could happen to Reds right now in terms of trade value.
@MoEgger1530 hopefully nothing more than that. any DL stint would be devastating for a return in any trade for Cueto.

@LanceMcAlister @700wlw it's going to be a long, miserable season when deep down we already know Reds don't have a prayer.
@Sut_ESPN Reds, Cueto, &amp; Votto
@LanceMcAlister after watching the Mets get Wheeler from Giants for Beltran rental, do u think Reds could get similar phenom 4 cueto?
@JessicaV_CIS yet we're supposed to believe that illegal aliens are in the shadows?
@LanceMcAlister @dougdirt24 if Nick Howard is relegated to relief work bc of command issues, this will go down as a wasted 1st round pick.
@LanceMcAlister what are Wood's numbers against Reds though? he seems to pitch like an ace when we're facing him.
@KyRedsGal I wish it weren't so either, but no effort has been made to keep Leake, &amp; Cueto wants Scherzer $. time will tell how it plays out
@KyRedsGal good points. I'm trying to be an optimist as well. I also can't help but feel that a plan to trade Cueto after ASB is in place.
@KyRedsGal are you beginning to lose hope on our Reds season? I feel like Walt has really put Price in a bad position.
@LibertyBritt  the more moderates who run, the better the chances a conservative wins the nomination. the moderates will split their votes.
@MoEgger1530 I agree with your latest blog! Walt sent Price into a gunfight with a knife. It would be nice for Walt to be held responsible.
@charliekirk11 SNL is also going on the attack against GOP candidates. Not sure what their angle is, but their liberal leanings are obvious

@LanceMcAlister bringing in Gregg in Tuesday's blowout win would have made a lot more sense than doing so in a tight game.
@KyRedsGal why bring him in a tight ballgame? how is Price going to explain that one?
@MoEgger1530 it does make one wonder what in God's green earth is preventing Walt from cutting him? who at AAA could be worse?
@LanceMcAlister how many games is Price going to allow Gregg to cost us? I just don't understand his rationale in bringing him in like this.
@LanceMcAlister why does Price insist on bringing in Gregg in tight ballgames? is he a glutton for punishment?

@LanceMcAlister although the return for Simon was really good, do u agree that the return for a stud like Latos was pretty pathetic?

@LanceMcAlister why stop w/ Latos? why not Leake &amp; Cueto too? Cards are going to continue to own us for the foreseeable future!
@johnfayman Cardinals fans are laughing hysterically!
@RMConservative why would Bentivolio do that? I thought he was a rock solid conservative?
@joshuapbrown @jluckhaupt yeah! we are weaker while StL &amp; Cubs are stronger. Pitt, minus Russell Martin, &amp; Brewers are in pretty good shape
@jluckhaupt still curious as to how we're going to contend in 2015 now that we have significantly weakened our rotation.

@Reds u know Hamilton is having a bad 2nd half when he gets thrown out trying to steal on Arrieta, 1 of the slowest pitchers to the plate.

@MoEgger1530 had a bad feeling about this series. never goes well at coors field. SP advantage for any club goes out the window at Coors.
@MoEgger1530 still trying to figure out why Price would put another game in Hoover's hands &amp; why Hoover remains on the club.
@MoEgger1530 safe to say our season died at coors field. it is official.
@LanceMcAlister is there any reason why Hoover is not in AAA? u can't tell me there are no better options in our farm system.

@redlegnation not against Uehara. game over.
@agrote21 @GroteT with the weaker Nava on deck, agreed! why give him a pitch to hit?
@EnquirerDoc because our bats went completely silent after the 1st inning? most putrid Reds offense I've seen in my lifetime.
@LanceMcAlister can u remember a Reds team that teased its fan base like this 1? a team thats destined to fail but lets u think theres hope?
@weltmoney I can't remember a Reds team in my lifetime that has jerked around its fan base like this one.
@weltmoney like a fastball right down the middle to a prolific power hitter at the plate? why not walk him &amp; take chances with weaker Nava?
@LanceMcAlister with milwaukee &amp; st. louis losing, this pathetic Reds team continues to blow opportunities to gain ground. unbelievable!
@ctrent wondering if it ever occurred to broxton to walk cespedes &amp; take your chances with much weaker Nava. just curious.
@weltmoney Agreed! Each would require upwards of 20 mil apiece. Hopefully, we'll be able to keep 1 of them along with Leake.

@Joe32077 @Reds agreed! I wish we would stop handing away games likes this!
@Reds when do the Cubs ever score 5 runs in a single game? that speaks volumes about how bad holmberg was!
@ENQSports can we trade Holmberg for Wada?
@Reds question: how often have Reds come back from 3 runs down this season? answer: never. conclusion: cubs win! time to pack it in.
@ENQSports we haven't come back from 3 runs down all season. let's pack it up &amp; call it day. Cubs win!
@ENQSports the most frustrating thing about watching this Reds team losing is that they rarely play well from behind. probably a loss.
@RedsBarbie @MLB Arroyo is the kind of guy u root for as a Reds fan. Could be tough to come back from at 37. Best wishes!

@LanceMcAlister ross has been lethal against us the last 2x out. plus, cueto doesn't get much run support. could very well be a sweep.
@redlegnation nice try. not happening. already turned channel.

@_Sir_Psycho @LanceMcAlister what they have shown in this series is that they're not contenders. contenders don't get crushed by padres.
@ENQSports @ctrent if tyson ross pitches anywhere close to the way he's pitched against Reds last 2x out, they could easily sweep us.
@ENQSports @ctrent can you imagine how great the Padres' record would be if they played the Reds more than 2x a season?
@redlegnation @Nicholaspkirby Ondrusek's contract is up after season. cut our losses &amp; non-tender him. this guy is so unreliable.
@LanceMcAlister any idea why the Padres have Reds' number?
@ctrent any idea whatsoever why the padres have our number? no other team has a problem beating this crappy Padres team except for Reds.
@redlegnation u can't help but question this team as a contender after a complete inability to beat such a lousy Padres team all season long
@LanceMcAlister just when we thought this team was contender, we ran into the Padres. baseball is truly a humble game.
@LanceMcAlister also, this game is over. book it!
@LanceMcAlister is this the most hits the worst offense in baseball has had in a game all season long?
@LanceMcAlister does it feel like we're heading back to the hamster wheel again that Paul Daugherty speaks of?
@ENQSports Ready to get out of San Diego &amp; put this eternal Padres nightmare behind us! Why does it feel like we're playing the Cardinals?
