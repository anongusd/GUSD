@realDonaldTrump Not sure what you’re referring to, but you’re in deeper than ever.....  “NOT CLEARED”!
@realDonaldTrump ....until he doesn’t agree with you!
@realDonaldTrump I believe you just described Donald Trump.  Dumb as a rock...   Donald Trump!  Never reads, so can’t expect you to understand more than a third grader ...yep, Dunb as a Rock Donald Trump!
@HillReporter It’s all on you Donald!
@realDonaldTrump Run, run, run your mouth,	It just shows you’re scared,	Muellerly, Muellerly, Muellerly,	Corruption to soon be shared!
@realDonaldTrump This is something you worry about!  We don’t care!  It’s truly not “all about you”.  You’ve brought your woes against yourself by your actions....
@realDonaldTrump 	Sssshhhhhhhh............

@DeadlineWH @SykesCharlie @NicolleDWallace Trump is, as Lindsey Graham said, “willfully blind” about this horrendous murder plot that played out as well as most things Americans expect from their president.
@JonLionFineArt @BarackObama @MichelleObama Amazing!  I love your drawings.  So real, so much feeling .....
@realDonaldTrump Please keep your mouth shut and stay off of Twitter.... at the very least, during this time of respect for the honorable and good man, George H.W. Bush.
@realDonaldTrump It’s not about you....
@realDonaldTrump Every time you tweet another message, you sound more concerned and more concerned.  If you’ve “ done nothing wrong”, why so concerned?  It’s very telling......
@realDonaldTrump If you’ve done nothing wrong, what are you concerned about?   Answer that!
@realDonaldTrump Your posts are VERY telling........
@realDonaldTrump What are you so concerned about?  Oohhh...    Your own prison sentence?

@realDonaldTrump You’re an embarrassment to our country!

@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews No thanks!  Sean Hannity has never been worth my time....
@realDonaldTrump If you indeed did nothing wrong, why all the tweets?  Are you trying to convince the American people or yourself?
@realDonaldTrump @GreggJarrett @JudgeJeanine I’m confused!  You don’t read.  You brag about it. Who is reading all these books to you???????
@realDonaldTrump @StephenMoore You don’t Read anything... how would you know if the book is good .... or not?????
@realDonaldTrump If only you read books .... or anything......

@realDonaldTrump So interesting seeing your fear and paranoia in your tweets!
@realDonaldTrump You’re sounding a little paranoid there Donald.  Mueller’s coming for you!  Be afraid, be very afraid!

@realDonaldTrump Worried?  You should be!
@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 They don’t ask for your quote or opinion, because they hate the lies and FAKE NEWS they get when you open your mouth!
@realDonaldTrump You’re showing your ignorance.....AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump It’s called “sarcasm”......
@realDonaldTrump Spending your day watching tv?  That’s not productive!  Do your job!
@realDonaldTrump You’d be better off if you’d just keep your mouth shut and your fingers off the keyboard.  Your words mean nothing anymore.  You’ve yelled “wolf” too often....   Sad....
@TIME If she’d teach her husband to stop his online bullying , she might not be so ridiculed about it.....
@TIME Was that Melania’s idea?  You know, handbags and all.....
@realDonaldTrump Is this so that you too will  have a chance at a new start after you leave prison?
@realDonaldTrump Have you ever given thought to how you will be viewed in the history books?  It will not be honorable.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Too bad you didn’t have time during the rain storm Saturday and at Arlington yesterday for our fallen heroes.
@realDonaldTrump Stop blaming others.  You use your rants to wind up those who have swallowed  your koolaid (and the cup).  You spread hate and division.  STOP!  Grow up and act like a president instead of a little child with temper tantrums!
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump....  quit, just  STOP spreading hate and division! You’re destroying our country!

@realDonaldTrump The country will never get your hateful words toward Dr. Ford out of their minds.  You’ve hurt whatever it is you think you are building in this country .... except hate.  “Hate” is not something to go into the history books beside your name.
@realDonaldTrump I don’t believe you know the meaning of “fairness” or  “common sense” and “due process” is beyond your ability to comprehend.
