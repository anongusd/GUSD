"Where ignorance is our master, there is no possibility of real peace."
One of our produced videos	https://t.co/dF2wPW8DJM
"To do great things is difficult, but to command great things is more difficult."
Remember happiness doesn't depend on who you are or what you have; it depends solely upon what you think
"Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."
"Empty your cup so that it may be filled; become devoid to gain totality."
"Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking."
"Circumstances do not make a man, they reveal him."
"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."
Only in the darkness, you are able to see the stars."Martin Luther King"
"Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy"
"Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong."
Don't be concerned others not appreciating you. Be concerned about your not appreciating others.
"Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not."
As our case is new, we must think and act anew
To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it
Learn as though you would never be able to master it; hold it as though  you would be in fear of losing it
When you change the way you see things, the things you see begin to change.
Control the situation, dont let it control you
A good enough man can accept the good,but a better man can accept the bad
Understand that u can fail at what u dont want just as easy as what u want, so you might as well do something you want.

For hope is but the dream	of those that wake.

results are the only thing that matter, no one cares about our excuses../ dont complain, and dont explain.
every day is a new day, every moment is a new moment, wake up now and show the world that u are a different creature
when you change the way you see things, the things you see begin to change
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
A leader is a dealer in hope.
behind fear, is the person you want to be, it can ether make you or destroy you
In doubtful matters boldness is everything.

Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
If you have no critics you'll likely have no success.
if one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.
It takes courage to grow up and turn out to be who you really are.
We become what we think about.
Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.
Stars of the same light shine together
Believe with all of your heart that you will do what you were made to do.
He who hesitates is lost.
Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes.
No star is lost once we have seen, We always may be what we might have been.

Your time is limmited, what you do; you become.
Life isn‚Äôt about getting and having, it‚Äôs about giving and being.
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
sometimes you have to go through the bad to get to the good
Set goals, and multiply them times 10, that's the X rule
Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us.
Work spares us from three evils: boredom, vice, and need.
Challenges are what make life interesting and overcoming them is what makes life meaningful.
With will one can do anything.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.
Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes.
If you do not hope, you will not find what is beyond your hopes.
Take calculated risks.  That is quite different from being rash.
Visualize it into reality
Positive core beliefs spawn positive results
We are still masters of our fate. We are still captains of our souls.
He who hesitates is lost.
No star is lost once we have seen, We always may be what we might have been.
You must do the things you think you cannot do.
you'll never fly if u never leap forward
They can because they think they can.
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts.
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.
The battles that count aren‚Äôt the ones for gold medals. The struggles within yourself‚Äìthose battles inside all of us‚Äìthat‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at
Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities. Seize common occasions and make them great.
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams.  Live the life you have imagined
Every artist was first an amateur.

Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
Challenge yourself with something you know you could never do, and what you‚Äôll find is that you can overcome anything.
Limitations live only in our minds.  But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
There is only one success--to be able to spend your life in your own way.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
You may be disappointed if you fail, but you are doomed if you don‚Äôt try.
Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.
If you can dream it, you can achieve it.
The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.
I have learned over the years that when one‚Äôs mind is made up, this diminishes fear
The best revenge is massive success.
Dream big and dare to fail.
You take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing, no one to blame.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one‚Äôs courage.
@SwankyKing #istar snapbacks http://t.co/UUTslDksjS
You become what you believe
In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
The question isn‚Äôt who is going to let me; it‚Äôs who is going to stop me.
Ask and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock and the door will be opened for you.
Dream big and dare to fail
The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.
Either you run the day, or the day runs you
You can‚Äôt fall if you don‚Äôt climb.  But there‚Äôs no joy in living your whole life on the ground
The mind is everything. What you think you become.
Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.
There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing
I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.
I would rather die of passion than of boredom.
If you‚Äôre offered a seat on a rocket ship, don‚Äôt ask what seat! Just get on.
Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it.
It is not what you do for your children  but what you have taught them to do for themselves, that will make them successful human beings.
Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one‚Äôs courage
Start where you are. Use what you have.  Do what you can.
Every child is an artist.  The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.
Definiteness of purpose is the starting point of all achievement
Fall seven times and stand up eight.
You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take
The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don‚Äôt have any.
Eighty percent of success is showing up
The past is a ghost, the future a dream. All we ever have is now.
To do great things is difficult, but to command great things is even more difficult.
You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.
Every strike brings me closer to the next home run.
Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit, the second is to look thing in the face and see them for what they are.
Failure cannot cope with persistence

The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible
We are what our thoughts make us, so take care of what yo think. Our actions are secondary, our thoughts travel far
Whatever the mind of men and women can conceive, and believe it can achieve
Live as if you were to die tommorow,  and learn as if you were to live forever
Our life is what our thoughts make them
A superior man is modest in his speach, but exceeds in his actions
Sometimes To go too far is as bad as to fall short
Imagination is everything, it is the preview of lifes coming attractions
Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle
Dream is not that you see in your sleep, Dream is that, that does not allow you to sleep
Sometimes good things fall apart so that better things fall together
The starting point for all achievement is desire
RT @UncleRUSH: "All that we are is the result of what we have thought. The mind is everything. What we think, we become." ~Maharishi Yogi
Be the change you wish to see in the world
RT @UncleRUSH: You have control over the work alone but never its fruit. ~Krishna Bhagavad-Gita
Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time after we fall
What your thinking, is what you are becoming
our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall
earning happiness means doing good and working, laziness may look inviting, but only work gives you true satisfaction

when everything seems to be going against you, remember that the Airplain take off against the wind, not with it
Failure is simply an opportunity to begin again. This time more intelligently
If everyone is moving forward together,than success takes care of itself
don't find fault, find a remedy;anyone can complain
The starting point of all achievement is desire.
No one is ever defeated untill defeat is accepted as a reality
Vision without execution is just hallucination
Men's success comes after they're biggest failures
@istarsociety @Iamkingswanky
The more business a man has to do, the more he is able to accomplish, for he learns to economize his time.
Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true.
Fortune favors the brave.
Men's best successes come after their disappointments.
