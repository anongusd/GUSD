RT @PHP2018: Republicans are making 2020 all about socialism and the media are accepting that framing without ever defining what socialism…
Ike expanded Social Security, raised minimum wage, created the Dept of Health, Education and Welfare.  Nixon formed the EPA. What we see now is a radical right-wing Republican Party. It's framing of everything it doesn't like as socialist must not be allowed to stand.
In fact, many of the things today's conservatives consider socialist are policies long popular even with Republicans. Ronald Reagan and Adam Smith both advocated progressive taxation.
Clearly, no candidate is proposing that, so maybe our response every time a cable news host parrots the Republican line should be to reject the framework that health insurance and environmental protection is socialist. Perhaps conservatives should be asked to define socialism.
Republicans are making 2020 all about socialism and the media are accepting that framing without ever defining what socialism is. FA Hayek defined socialism as "a system where the means of production are owned by the state and managed through central planning."
Now it's teachers in Oakland. We're witnessing a rebirth of muscular, active labor. It was unions that built the middle class, and it's unions that are going to save it. #GoodNews https://t.co/0UuzMHRmYm

@skorpyos @Ojeda4congress Richard was -- and is -- outstanding, but while there will never be another Richard, there is no shortage of exceptional candidates as culturally suited to their districts as Richard is to WV. Finding and supporting those people is what PHP does.
Our data show Ojeda outperformed other conventional Democratic House candidates in WV by almost 12%. Key to that was his appeal to working class voters Dems have largely lost. Sure, lots of people voted party, but @Ojeda4congress proved Dems can be viable in any district. https://t.co/8Gm0KcDoD4

VA polls are open 'til 7 PM. If you're in line at that time, you get to vote. The question in the 2nd District is whether Dems run a progressive, or the big-money candidate who voted for the guy she now wants to run against. Voters make the call. Be a voter. @mallardforva https://t.co/A02oFpfqgM
