The Senate must pass our resolution to terminate the president's national emergency declaration. I encourage more Republicans to stand up &amp; show the American people where they stand on this issue. 		No president should be able to go around Congress &amp; spend taxpayer money at will.
Heartbreaking to see the loss of life and devastation from tornadoes in Alabama. I‚Äôm sending all my sympathies to the victims and their families, and my thanks to the brave first responders.
In last week‚Äôs @SenateDems weekly address, I spoke about my bipartisan resolution to end the president‚Äôs unconstitutional emergency declaration. We cannot allow any president to take us down a dangerous path, cutting out the role of Congress and ransacking critical funds at will. https://t.co/JFmMUtLuRC
A majority of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--support my resolution to terminate the president's national emergency declaration. We have a historic opportunity to stand up, on behalf of the American people, for the separation of powers &amp; our Constitution.
I am humbled and honored to join our hero @repjohnlewis for the #FPICivilRights pilgrimage. We are walking in the footsteps of giants--men &amp; women who marched, bled, and even gave their lives to bring this nation closer to its ideals. Their work must be our work today. https://t.co/3SG9ien2Xp

This isn't just about understanding how many people live in our country. This is about making sure communities get all the resources they need to thrive, and that relies on an accurate count. We need to fund and support the 2020 census effort, and we need to work on this now.
229 years our nation authorized the first census. Fast forward to today, and it has become one of our most important tools for determining how federal funds are distributed. I'm working hard to make sure every single New Mexican gets counted in the 2020 census.
NM families shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between going to work or paying for childcare. @PattyMurray's Childcare for Working Families Act would ensure every working family‚Äî no matter their income‚Äî access to high-quality services to help families and their children grow and thrive. https://t.co/1TZycErKSa

Very proud that my amendment preserving critical farmworker protections finally passed Congress. This will safeguard hundreds of thousands of children‚Äî it was a battle worth fighting.
I urge every senator to support our bipartisan resolution terminating the president‚Äôs unlawful national emergency declaration. We must uphold our oath to protect the Constitution‚Äî no matter which party we‚Äôre in. https://t.co/04bQMtcpjG
Let‚Äôs be clear: voting down this power grab isn‚Äôt about where you stand on the wall. It‚Äôs about where you stand on the Constitution. We have to stand up to this blatant attempt to raid critical defense dollars for a pet project. We need to end this phony national emergency.
When we were sworn into Congress, we didn‚Äôt swear an oath to one party or person. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. And that‚Äôs why we need to vote to end this emergency declaration.
This isn‚Äôt a political issue. 	 	The president's emergency declaration is testing whether we're going to lie down and set this dangerous precedent‚Äî where any president can raid taxpayer money without the consent of Congress. 	 	We can't go down that path.
I've introduced a bipartisan resolution with @SenatorCollins, @SenatorShaheen, and @lisamurkowski to END the president's unconstitutional national emergency declaration. 	 	This is a historic opportunity to stand up for the Constitution, and for the separation of powers. https://t.co/LHo19N0p4n

WATCH LIVE: I‚Äôm on the Senate floor to talk about why Andrew Wheeler‚Äôs nomination to lead the EPA puts the American public at risk. https://t.co/9L3tflbk6z
Andrew Wheeler should not lead @EPA. Throughout his career, he‚Äôs advocated for measures that pollute our air and water, hurt public health, and will do long-term economic damage. And his record on climate change is simply disqualifying.	 	That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm voting NO.
Excited to see the House pass our lands package that is going to protect 275,000 more acres of land in New Mexico, reauthorize #LWCF &amp; do so much more to ensure our state‚Äôs precious public lands can flourish for generations to come. https://t.co/PrmmMrGwO4
Mr. Miller has a history of advocating against Tribal interests. He is going to preside over a jurisdiction that has 427 Tribal nations.	 	He should have been asked about his troubling record on Native issues, in a real hearing. But he wasn't.	 	I voted NO on his confirmation.
Eric Miller's nomination came to the floor after a 30-minute hearing, which took place with no Democrats present, during a recess week.		His nomination is the first in a century to override the opposition of both home-state senators.		These are major abuses of Senate process. https://t.co/IhG9qLeWyJ

If this so-called emergency is allowed to stand, it will set a dangerous precedent for future presidents to ransack taxpayer-funded programs for their own pet projects just because they don‚Äôt agree with the budget set forth by Congress. That‚Äôs not how our Constitution works.
Today, the House will vote to stop the president‚Äôs unconstitutional emergency declaration. The Senate must do the same. We cannot allow this dangerous power grab to stand.
Even the president doesn‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs an emergency. After all, he said it loud and clear: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù 		Unfortunately, he did.  Now the ball is in Congress‚Äô court. Are we still a co-equal branch? Let‚Äôs show it.
I‚Äôm also encouraged to see a bipartisan group of 58 former senior national security officials going public to tell Congress and the American people there's no basis for the declaration. https://t.co/denepNiZn1
Heartened to see Republican former members of Congress agree‚Äî 23 of them wrote a letter urging congressional Republicans to terminate this national emergency and stand up for the Constitution. https://t.co/dBmM6JA7bu
This national emergency declaration is an unconstitutional power grab to raid military funding to pay for a wall that Congress rejected. Republicans and Democrats in Congress should unite against it, because regardless of party, we are a co-equal branch of government.

When I first came to Congress, I began my journey on the #SouthwestChief üöÇ so I know the important role it plays in communities big &amp; small along its route, in NM &amp; beyond. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been fighting so hard to save it‚Äî and we got a big win this week.
This week, as @NCAI1944 convened in Washington, I got to have some great meetings with NM's Tribal leaders. We discussed their priorities and everything I can do to support them as the top Democrat on @IndianCommittee. Always so great to meet with these incredible leaders. https://t.co/G9ZzPpVMQ7

Seems like the @EPA doesn‚Äôt waste any time when it comes to reducing regulations to help corporate polluters, but when it‚Äôs time to go after those causing real harm to everyday Americans, they‚Äôve once again dropped the ball. https://t.co/Be0gY7TRnV
The @EPA put out an "action plan" to address #PFAS contamination in drinking water, but it doesn‚Äôt include an actual drinking water standard for these dangerous chemicals‚Äî which it must.	 	The EPA is delaying that decision for a year or more.  New Mexicans can‚Äôt wait that long.
In the year since 17 people died in the Parkland shooting, 1200 more children have lost their lives to guns.	 	No child in New Mexico or anywhere should be afraid to go to school. Today, let's pledge to end the violence. And that means action in Congress.
I am voting NO on William Barr's nomination for Attorney General.	 	After studying his record, I am afraid he will double down on many of the president‚Äôs worst policies and hesitate to stand up against attempts to circumvent the law to protect the president‚Äôs personal interests.

Nominees who can‚Äôt answer basic questions about the law. Nominees to be trial judges who have never tried a case. Exec nominees with serious conflicts of interest. Nominees who withdrew in scandal.	 	We do need to fix the nomination process. @SenateGOP's proposal doesn't do that.
Today @SenateGOP moved to change the Senate rules‚Äî without any hearings‚Äî to make judicial &amp; exec nominations go through even faster.

We just passed a major bill to protect #PublicLands. We secured some big wins for NM, including the permanent reauthorization of the #LWCF. 	 	I'm so proud to carry on my father Stewart Udall's legacy, by enacting permanent #LWCF to safeguard our outdoors for future generations.
Congress is a coequal branch of government. So for @POTUS to overrule the will of Congress‚Äî and the people‚Äî to raid money put aside for disaster recovery and military bases would be unheard of. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve introduced legislation to stop him. https://t.co/PXSxNAesiO
The #FamilyAct would guarantee paid leave, so New Mexicans could care for family members who might need it‚Äî newborns to grandparents. On top of that, it would boost our economy, cover &amp; protect all working people &amp; improve workplace equity. There‚Äôs no good reason not to pass it.
#PaidLeave would be a game-changer in New Mexico. 65% of NM households have two parents with paying jobs‚Äî that means they're often forced to choose between a paycheck and their families. That‚Äôs unacceptable.	 	That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm cosponsoring the #FAMILYAct. https://t.co/WVrnhhroMd

Some places are just too special to lose. BLM did the right thing delaying lease sales near sacred &amp; fragile land at #Chaco.	 	But now, the admin. should take the next step and stop leasing in this area, so that Tribal &amp; public concerns can be fully heard. https://t.co/9pYJ1pkYQK

One thing @POTUS made clear last night in his #SOTU:	 	His administration will keep ignoring what the people actually want in order to give big money donors &amp; lobbyists a leg up.		We must pass #ForThePeople legislation to fix our democracy and return it to the American people.

We continue to uncover disturbing revelations about the Trump admin's family separation policy. 		I stand with New Mexicans in condemning this policy, carried out with sheer cruelty and incompetence. I'm co-sponsoring the Keep Families Together Act to stop this inhumane practice.
The president‚Äôs appeals to unity rang hollow, because he insists on sowing hatred, fear, and division ‚Äì with rhetoric demonizing immigrants and spreading misinformation about our border.
After dragging us through the longest shutdown in American history, @POTUS seems committed to the same destructive tactics that caused 35 days of pain and fear for families across New Mexico and the country. #SOTU

Our bills take much-needed action against the admin's out-of touch attacks: they would restore basic due process to eminent domain, protect sensitive wildlife areas from border barrier construction and subject Trump‚Äôs wall to the same laws that govern other federal projects.
As a border state senator, I can tell you: most New Mexicans don‚Äôt want the president‚Äôs wall, because it could cause irreparable damage to our border &amp; environment. @MartinHeinrich &amp; I are standing up for our state with bills to protect NM's landowners, wildlife &amp; way of life.
We've introduced major, bipartisan legislation to close gaps in current laws that have left Native children, sexual assault survivors, and Tribal police unprotected.

Proud to lead the full New Mexico delegation and re-introduce the #EstherMartinez Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act. This legislation honors Esther Martinez‚Äôs legacy and promotes Tribes‚Äô work to maintain and revitalize Native languages.

Now that there is a path to re-opening the government, the president must face up to reality, drop his outrageous and wasteful wall demands, and support common-sense border security proposals so we can keep the government open long-term.
It shouldn‚Äôt have taken 35 days and a month of missed paychecks to end the #TrumpShutdown. In fact, this attempt at governance-by-extortion never should have happened.		Now, we need to ensure every person hurt by the shutdown‚Äî in NM and across the country‚Äî is made whole.

Native communities didn‚Äôt ask for a #TrumpShutdown. But, as is often the case, they're among those hurt most. We must open the gov't now &amp; restore essential services, not only because it‚Äôs the right thing to do‚Äî failing to goes against the core of our trust &amp; treaty obligations.
With @IHSgov &amp; @USIndianAffairs shut down, Native communities are losing essential health &amp; safety services. I'm introducing legislation to ensure Tribes are protected in future shutdowns‚Äî because even when this ends, who knows if @POTUS will force another?
On my way to the Senate floor where I'll vote to end the #TrumpShutdown, with no conditions attached.	 	Let's re-open the government, stop holding innocent people hostage, and then work to resolve our differences on border security &amp; immigration. It's as simple as that.
The #TrumpShutdown is taking public safety hostage, too.		As @afa_cwa says: "we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire [air travel] system will break.‚Äù		@SenateGOP: we need to end the shutdown right away.

This shutdown never should have happened in the first place‚Äîand it certainly shouldn't still be going on. The American people are hurting, and they can't afford to wait as @POTUS and @senatemajldr continue to stand in the way of a resolution.		It's time to re-open the government.

We're in the the longest government shutdown in American history. Families across New Mexico and the country are suffering. 	 	But we didn't get here by accident. At every step of the way, @POTUS and @senatemajldr have blocked sensible efforts to re-open the gov't. 	 	A timeline:
This cruel #TrumpShutdown never should have happened and needs to end. Senate Republicans should join with @SenateDems to pass a clean bill to re-open the government immediately.
The details of @POTUS' proposal show that it is even worse than it first looked.		Not only does it waste billions in taxpayer money on an ineffective wall, but it also includes poison pill, anti-immigrant changes to current law--while not providing meaningful relief for Dreamers. https://t.co/EN6AfZpcew
So @SenateMajLdr, please‚Äîlet‚Äôs end the shutdown that never should have happened, and then we can work in good faith on smart border security. This is untenable &amp; it‚Äôs actively hurting hardworking Americans.	It‚Äôs just wrong. End the #TrumpShutdown

Our national laboratories &amp; military bases keep our nation secure. They're a cornerstone of our economy &amp; workforce. Los Alamos &amp; Sandia are at record funding levels. And we want to make sure clean up at LANL goes forward. #UdallNMLeg
New Mexicans want and deserve quality health care, but not enough have it. Just as we have worked to defend the #ACA, we need to fight challenges in our health system.	 	And we must fight the opioid epidemic ravaging NM. We need to end the scourge of opioid addiction. #UdallNMLeg
As we work to vitalize our rural economy, we must think big. I am committed to closing the digital divide in rural NM &amp; across the nation. That‚Äôs why I have worked on grants and legislation to secure rural and tribal broadband. #UdallNMLeg
Acequias and land grants are so important to New Mexico. But they face red tape trying to access @USDA programs. We passed legislation to makes them directly eligible for assistance and funding. And we re-started the flow of funds to the Army Corps acequia program. #UdallNMLeg
As a senior member on @SenateApprops, I have a chance fight for funding that benefits our state.	¬†	One of my priorities is our rural economy. I've worked on legislation to increase resources for farmers &amp; ranchers who are just getting started or looking to expand.¬†#UdallNMLeg
In all I try &amp; accomplish for Indian Country, three principles guide me: respect for tribes‚Äô &amp; pueblos‚Äô sovereignty, promotion of self-determination &amp; federal government's obligation to engage in meaningful consultation whenever federal actions affect Indian Country. #UdallNMLeg
I have the privilege of serving as vice-chair of @IndianCommittee. Our state is proud to be home to one of the largest percentage of Native Americans in the nation. New Mexico has one of the richest diversity of cultures in the nation. #UdallNMLeg
The scientific consensus is clear. @IPCC_CH warns we have only 12 years to meet this challenge head on or we can‚Äôt reverse course.		And on that note: we must protect public lands. They're essential to our identity and economy‚Äî public lands belong in public hands. #UdallNMLeg
NM feels climate change, and we need to fight drought and modernize water infrastructure. We can't meet 21st century challenges with 19th century infrastructure‚Äî so I've worked to nearly double the funding to rural water projects. #UdallNMLeg
I support immigration reform. Dreamers &amp; their families should be able to stay in our state &amp; communities. Families must be reunited. Inhumane immigration policies must end. New Mexico is a border state. I am making sure we are all heard in these debates. #UdallNMLeg
When the gov‚Äôt is open, we can debate &amp; negotiate in good faith. I support strong border security. But I want to see cost-effective &amp; locally appropriate measures. Not the president‚Äôs wall that won‚Äôt work, costs billions &amp; would stand as a symbol of division. #UdallNMLeg
The terrible gov‚Äôt shutdown impacts more than 10,000 NM federal employees,¬† and many contractors in our state. This shutdown is affecting real people, with real mortgages, real bills to pay, and real families to feed.¬† 	¬†	The cruelty of this shutdown must stop.¬† #UdallNMLeg
I‚Äôve been working for years on comprehensive reform for our democracy. My #ForThePeople Act will rein in our campaign finance system, end gerrymandering &amp; set a high ethical bar for gov't officials.		These measures are not red or blue.  They are red, white, and blue. #UdallNMLeg
Democracy depends on all citizens voting.	Democracy depends on elected officials carrying out the people's will.	Democracy depends on gov't officials working for the people, not their wallets.		My #ForThePeople reform package will help return democracy to the people. #UdallNMLeg
Polls shows the people want affordable healthcare, good jobs, gun safety laws, measures to combat climate change &amp; humane immigration laws.¬† Yet, many in Congress &amp; the Executive only seem to hear the 1%. It‚Äôs no wonder trust in Congress is so low. #UdallNMLeg
Election season is over. It‚Äôs time to govern. New Mexicans are ready for action. Let‚Äôs deliver.		Our democracy needs rebuilding &amp; revitalizing. There is a deep disconnect at the nat'l level between what the people want &amp; what their elected officials are giving them. #UdallNMLeg
I am honored to address the New Mexico State legislature today, at the start of a new year where bold action is imperative. Follow along using ¬†#UdallNMLeg for updates. The speech is also streaming: https://t.co/F8k3ViYWzG
Today in ABQ, I stood with New Mexicans of all backgrounds, including:		-federal employees	-Tribal leaders	-contractors	-business owners	-families		who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. Their stories are heartbreaking. This should never have happened, and it needs to end. https://t.co/xhtThGAmjB
So thankful for the chance to address the 23rd MLK Community Commemorative Breakfast in ABQ today. A reminder that we can best honor Dr. King by continuing his work ‚Äì to further equality, lift people out of poverty, and spread a message of peace. https://t.co/0i3lsmRlzQ
Today, we must recommit to fighting injustice &amp; standing up for the values Dr. King worked for‚Äî the same values that define New Mexico. Love, understanding, and kindness are the keys to creating a better future for our state and our nation. https://t.co/96NJ4eV6St
.@RepDebHaaland said it best. This video is heartbreaking. But on this MLK weekend, Mr. Phillips of the Omaha Nation reminds us all of Dr. King‚Äôs lasting legacy of promoting unity over division. Let‚Äôs strive to meet his example. #omahanation https://t.co/wag3qbZjaV
Let‚Äôs put aside the broken politics and end the shutdown. After that we can have a good-faith discussion about border security without harming hundreds of thousands of innocent people.
The president has said he's "proud‚Äù to shut down the government and hold Americans‚Äô livelihoods hostage.		The American people are tired of this sheer dysfunction, and we shouldn't validate or accept it. It‚Äôs time to stop this governance-by-extortion.
It's time do the right thing: end the #TrumpShutdown and stop jeopardizing the safety of the American people. If we're really concerned about keeping our country safe, re-opening the government should be our top priority.
When we add it all up what do we learn? @SenateGOP &amp; @POTUS are putting the health of everyday people at risk to try and get billions in taxpayer $ for an ineffective wall.		That's not leadership. That's using innocent people as pawns for political purposes.
But that's not all. @TSA is understaffed &amp; unpaid. And @DHSgov &amp; @CBP are shuttered as well‚Äî showing that whatever the #TrumpShutdown is about, it's not border security
And Americans' health is on the line. @EPA suspended most inspections of power plants and even water treatment facilities. @FDA can't conduct its usual food inspections.
New Mexico, with all our incredible outdoor spaces, feels the impacts of closing @Interior. @NatlParkService sites are unstaffed but open, putting visitor safety and these incredible lands the government has promised to protect at risk.
The #TrumpShutdown is hurting more and more Americans every day. Because when federal workers are furloughed, the big and small things they do every day to ensure the health and safety of our nation fall by the wayside.		Here are a few examples of just how dangerous this is:
The Ornelas family is one of so many in NM &amp; across the nation hurt by the shutdown.		But this morning, @SenateGOP objected yet again to a vote that could end it.		The Ornelas family can't afford to wait any longer. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/Kr0vAeFcpH
The latest allegations against President Trump are astonishing.	 	To get the full truth, we need to protect the Mueller investigation and Congress must continue its own with complete transparency. No one‚Äî not even the president of the United States‚Äî is above the law.
On the Senate floor today, @senatemajldr refused to end the #TrumpShutdown. What‚Äôs it going to take for @SenateGOP to put the people over the President‚Äôs political demands?
LIVE: I‚Äôm demanding @senatemajldr call a vote on our bipartisan Interior Appropriations bill that would reopen parts of the gov't‚Äî including @Interior &amp; @EPA.	 	Time for @SenateGOP to do the right thing &amp; end the shutdown. https://t.co/tq0rGECRMX
Big Banks get assistance during the #TrumpShutdown but New Mexico farmers and ranchers don‚Äôt? It‚Äôs unacceptable to treat the NM farmers and ranchers who help feed our families and fuel our economy this way.	https://t.co/H9FoM3fPZm
Agriculture is $3bn of New Mexico's economy &amp; part of our identity. But critical @USDA support for hardworking farmers &amp; ranchers is cut off during the #TrumpShutdown.	 	@senatemajldr, this can't go on. Let‚Äôs vote to get @USDA and all agencies up &amp; running. End the shutdown. https://t.co/MOxC3Eo1zf
Horrifying: thousands more children were separated from their families at the border than the Trump admin first admitted.		No one‚Äî not @DHSgov, not @HHSgov‚Äî kept track of these helpless children. Incompetence &amp; inhumanity from @POTUS &amp; his administration. https://t.co/Sghdfg7HF0
Congratulations to @UNMHSC's Project ECHO! It's amazing to see a homegrown health effort go global. Your work has made a major difference in New Mexico, and you're going to make an even bigger impact around the world. https://t.co/dQWoqLyrQf
Congress wrote #ICWA recognizing that Native children‚Äî like all children‚Äî thrive when they grow up with the support of their families, communities and cultures.		But a dangerous court ruling threatens this vital law. That's why I'm leading a bipartisan brief to protect #ICWA. https://t.co/889kbnpxtf

Today on the Capitol steps, I joined @senatedems to highlight the stories of some of the Americans devastated by the #TrumpShutdown.	 	@POTUS &amp; @senatemajldr, these are just a few of the people this shutdown is hurting. We can end it now. https://t.co/e9cB00cl9A
Went to the Senate floor today to talk about the Ornelas family, one of the tens of thousands of families in New Mexico impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/0ogMSTNhRD
WATCH LIVE: Joining fellow @SenateDems on the Capitol steps to highlight the devastating effects of the #TrumpShutdown on New Mexicans &amp; families across the nation. https://t.co/V6oGSuqe5U
Their older son, Ian, is now the main provider for the family. Ian works at the Department of Interior, has been furloughed 26 days‚Äî and has now missed a paycheck.		The Ornelas family is scared to death Ian will miss another paycheck, and another.		The #TrumpShutdown must end.
Zachary Ornelas had a brain tumor, and has undergone two surgeries. He now needs constant care.		His stepfather, Ervie, reduced his work by 75 percent to take care of Zachary.		His mother, Leah's, paycheck goes to medical bills.		His family moved back in together to save money.
I'm on my way to the Senate floor to share the story of Zachary Ornelas and the Ornelas family, from Carlsbad, NM. They're one of thousands of families in New Mexico who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/Wfo1N4EzS8
.@GovMLG laid out an inspiring roadmap for New Mexico in her #StateOfTheStateNM address today. Priorities like funding early childhood, a clean environment and an open government will boost all New Mexicans. https://t.co/YUtDsadsOH
Today on #TuesdaysWithTom, I discussed the devastating consequences of the #TrumpShutdown on NM. The president &amp; @SenateGOP are holding New Mexicans' livelihoods hostage for a ransom of $5 billion in taxpayer dollars‚Äî all for an offensive, wasteful wall. https://t.co/xnZ0djylRb
It's simple: Secretary Ross misled the public to jam through the citizenship question. Intimidating immigrant families to stop them from filling out a census form is pure discrimination, and yet another example of the Trump administration's tactics of fear and division.
Relieved to see fed. court block Trump admin's citizenship question from 2020 census. It would have discouraged many NM families from filling out their form ‚Äî that‚Äôs unacceptable.	 	The census must count every New Mexican, or NM &amp; local gov‚Äôts will lose vital federal funding. https://t.co/KtlWiUcGRF
WATCH LIVE: I‚Äôm on the Senate floor sharing the stories of New Mexicans who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/BBT7kOamfi
Our priority is opening up the gov't and taking care of NM. That's why we‚Äôve:		-Sponsored legislation to pay federal workers and contractors	-Voted to fund the government	-Supported @SenateDems' call on the floor for a vote to end the shutdown‚Äî but @senatemajldr objected to it
In today‚Äôs @ABQJournal: New Mexicans are paying the price for the longest shutdown in US history. @MartinHeinrich &amp; I are standing up for federal workers going w/o pay &amp; all New Mexicans who are missing out on vital services.		The #TrumpShutdown must end. https://t.co/KvmbWs8PkI
So many New Mexicans have written to me to tell me about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting them and their families. Here are some of their stories: https://t.co/cpGztvM747
I represent a border state. @POTUS doesn‚Äôt have the first idea what‚Äôs going on in our communities. The president‚Äôs language demonizing immigrants &amp; border communities is appalling.		It‚Äôs time for the GOP to stop going along with these fear-mongering tactics &amp; stand up to @POTUS. https://t.co/03kjP6lZhZ
And when workers are furloughed, or working without pay, the impacts echo throughout their communities‚Äî millions miss out on services, local businesses suffer, our safety is compromised. We need to re-open the gov‚Äôt, get everyone back to work and get our country back on track.
Today should be payday for federal employees across the nation. But for 800,000 hardworking Americans &amp; thousands of New Mexicans, payday will come and go, and they won‚Äôt have anything to show for their work‚Äî all because of the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/hUj62SP6fv
Proud to see the House pass Interior Approps bill to fund public lands &amp; tribal programs with bipartisan vote. We need to stop the widespread impacts to tribes &amp; heartbreaking damage to nat‚Äôl parks.		@senatemajldr: it‚Äôs time for the Senate to vote on this. The shutdown must end.
Tribal health &amp; public safety programs should NEVER be used as hostages for political gain. We are talking about trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. The consequences of this shutdown are getting worse every day that this goes on.
For tribal communities, #TrumpShutdown consequences are real &amp; dangerous. Federal programs critical to health and public safety‚Äîfrom responding to 911 calls to conducting wellness checks for the elderly‚Äî are all impacted by this irrational, unnecessary #TrumpShutdown
This shutdown is hurting NM. Take Carlsbad: a shutdown means fewer visitors to national parks like Carlsbad Caverns. That means less business for a community whose economy centers on tourism. Small biz owners can‚Äôt afford these ripple effects. We need to re-open the government. https://t.co/HUtgbXuDNC
I‚Äôm leading a major Senate bill to fix our broken democracy, get corruption out of politics, and give power back to the American people. Read more here: https://t.co/dcMVerhiQC
Honored to be chosen again as top Dem on the @SenateApprops subcommittee that handles one of the areas most important to New Mexico‚ÄîInterior &amp; Environment. I‚Äôll keep working for:	 	-clean air &amp; water	 	-public lands	 	-the arts	 	-Indian Country	 	and much more.
This is a pay stub for an air traffic controller, as reported by @POLITICO.	 	$0. That's how much @POTUS values the work these controllers do to keep us safe.	 	Holding livelihoods hostage isn't getting us anywhere. Compromising our aviation workforce is the real security risk. https://t.co/4VIR3NyQhE
Another consequence of the #TrumpShutdown: talented federal employees leaving for new jobs. Many of them live paycheck to paycheck. But now their livelihoods are being held hostage, and it's their families and the communities they serve who suffer.	https://t.co/Qh17jRlzDD
Today, fellow @SenateDems &amp; I tried to bring a vote on bills to END the shutdown. Not just any bills‚Äî ones @senatemajldr &amp; R's supported a few weeks ago	 	But now they‚Äôre blocking them.	 	This shutdown is hurting everyday Americans. Why won‚Äôt @senateGOP stand up to the President?
On Friday, 5,800 people in NM will miss a paycheck. That means missed rent payments &amp; overdue bills. Real people are paying for the president's tantrum.	 	Instead of storming out when he doesn't get his way, @POTUS needs to come to the table‚Äî &amp; accept a solution to end this mess.
.@Interior should honor the public's voice. They need to extend the comment period on the proposed oil &amp; gas program in the #ArcticRefuge because drilling would permanently damage the land, harm treasured wildlife &amp; derail indigenous way of life. There's no reason to rush it. https://t.co/mZZIctjVt2
.@POTUS admits it: his trip to the border is just a photo op.		All while he's holding federal workers and services hostage‚Äîand demonizing our border communities.	 	The Senate needs to vote to open the government. https://t.co/rcW0AdH73z
New Mexicans didn‚Äôt hear anything new tonight from @POTUS.	 	They certainly didn‚Äôt hear a good reason for why @POTUS is holding their livelihoods hostage.	 	@POTUS and @SenateMajLdr need to end this #TrumpShutdown, before it hurts more NM families.
Tonight @POTUS will address the nation.	 	We'll likely hear more bizarre talk about what we need at the border ‚Äî from a president who doesn't know the first thing about the border.	 	But as a border state senator let me tell you: our communities reject the president's wall.
RT @CraigCaplan: Udall (D-NM) from Senate floor: "As Democrats stand ready to reopen the government, President Trump plans to address the n‚Ä¶
LIVE: I'm speaking out against the #TrumpShutdown on the Senate floor.	 	Democrats have passed solutions to end this mess. But @SenateMajLdr refuses to stand up to @POTUS as he holds the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of Americans hostage. https://t.co/L7e1Tnvq4h
Let‚Äôs be clear: If @POTUS cared about national security, he wouldn‚Äôt have shut down @TSA &amp; @DHSgov‚Äî forcing them to work with no pay. But he is putting the American people‚Äôs security &amp; livelihoods on the line to extort $ for a wasteful, hateful and ineffective border wall.
If there's one thing that's been consistent throughout the Trump administration, it's been their repeated refusal to tell the truth. And it looks like we'll get more of the same when @POTUS addresses the nation tonight.
Great piece from @FredWertheimer &amp; @NormEisen, two strong voices in the fight to restore our democracy, on urgency of #HR1.		I‚Äôm leading the Senate version of this bill, because America's working families are done with government of, by &amp; for the powerful. https://t.co/gXg72cmgqb
Day 17 of #TrumpShutdown. @POTUS is hurting ~800,000 federal employees for the sake of his hateful wall. Thousands in NM are going without pay.	 	@POTUS needs to stop using hardworking Americans as pawns. Dems have acted to reopen government. Time for @senatemajldr to step up.
On this day in 1912, New Mexico was admitted to the Union as our 47th state. Happy birthday to the Land of Enchantment! https://t.co/4DdECqUWKQ
800,000 people across the US‚Äîthousands of them in NM‚Äî are going w/o pay due to the #TrumpShutdown.		Forcing hardworking Americans to struggle is unconscionable. 		Democrats are offering bipartisan solutions. But Sen. McConnell won't stand up to @POTUS. https://t.co/PWqZyuxa3X
It‚Äôs time for @POTUS to end the shutdown. The House passed gov‚Äôt funding based on bipartisan Senate bills. There‚Äôs no good reason not to sign it‚Äî President Trump is putting New Mexicans‚Äô livelihoods at risk if he doesn‚Äôt.
And Native communities are in danger, as @USIndianAffairs services like clearing dangerous roads are on hold. The safety of tribal communities should NOT be a pawn in the fight over Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant wall.
Thousands of NM workers are federal employees &amp; contractors who aren't getting paid. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting NM families who have bills to pay &amp; mouths to feed‚Äî not to mention the massive impact this will have on our economy.		NM is paying a high price for Trump‚Äôs tantrum.
THREAD: @POTUS says he‚Äôd be fine with the shutdown lasting ‚Äúmonths or even years.‚Äù But that would simply be a disaster for NM.		Because for NM's federal workers &amp; Native communities, the #TrumpShutdown isn‚Äôt just inconvenient‚Äî it‚Äôs potentially devastating. https://t.co/XKssrSgNem
Excited about the bold reforms proposed in H.R. 1‚Äî a much-needed bill to fight corruption, fix our broken political system and put democracy back in the people‚Äôs hands. I‚Äôm proud to lead the Senate counterpart to this transformative, urgent legislation. https://t.co/V3o0BaiRUR
Proud that NM represents the historic diversity of the new Congress: @RepBenRayLujan &amp; @RepTorresSmall are part of largest @HispanicCaucus ever, &amp; @RepDebHaaland is one of Congress' 1st Native women.		Diversity in Congress means diversity of ideas as we fight for a stronger NM.
Today the House votes to reopen government using Senate bills passed w/overwhelming bipartisan support‚Äî even from @SenateMajLdr. There's NO reason for @POTUS not to sign.		Because every minute of the gov‚Äôt shutdown is another minute hardworking New Mexicans are hung out to dry.
New Mexico is one of the states hardest hit by the #TrumpShutdown. NM's thousands of federal employees work hard to protect our public lands, our borders and our nation. But they don't know when they'll see another paycheck. https://t.co/ScoRMxK8zj
Our democracy is at a crisis point. So in the 116th Congress, Democrats are working to end the culture of corruption in our politics. I'm proud to lead the Senate bill containing critical reforms to put democracy back in the hands of the people. https://t.co/0Kiasqufqn
Congratulations to @MartinHeinrich, @RepBenRayLujan, @RepDebHaaland, and @RepTorresSmall on your swearing in today. Our delegation is going to be hard at work for New Mexico, and I‚Äôm excited to partner with you to stand up for NM values and priorities in Congress. https://t.co/AChuhknzfD
#NationalPark designations aren't just symbolic. They're a promise from the gov't to safeguard treasured lands. But the #TrumpShutdown leaves them unprotected.		@POTUS: end the shutdown, let park staff get back to work &amp; get public lands out of harm's way. https://t.co/a8WbDqiuQS

Democrats are offering a responsible path forward to end the #TrumpShutdown, reopen the government, and provide certainty for New Mexico workers, families, and our economy. It's time for GOP leaders to end this madness. My full statement: https://t.co/o7Wr4qoLaH
Not only would closing the border hurt our economies and communities‚Äî it‚Äôs illegal. And above all else, it‚Äôs a betrayal of our core American values.  	https://t.co/LaMd7m866x

We're requesting an immediate @DHSgov &amp; @CBP investigation of 8-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gomez‚Äôs death‚Äî the second child to die this month in CBP custody. This is beyond alarming, and demands immediate attention. The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/CLeoUMHetu

.@POTUS puts polluters over people every chance he gets. I won‚Äôt stop working for the safety of all America‚Äôs communities.		That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm leading legislation to ban dangerous pesticides like chlorpyrifos‚Äî and why I‚Äôm fighting Trump rollbacks that leak more methane into our air.
MUST READ from @nytimes: the Trump administration's destructive attacks on environmental protections are having devastating impacts on the health of everyday Americans. https://t.co/VviNs5fBqj
A day after another child died in US custody, @SecNielsen blames everyone but the Trump admin for its callous mishandling of the humanitarian crisis at the border.	 	Meanwhile, @POTUS shut down @DHSgov to try and get his border wall as ransom.	 	This is no way to run a country. https://t.co/udtcg9A9IX
This is devastating news on a day when so many around the world are holding their families close. We can never become desensitized to children dying in US custody.

On Christmas Eve, here's more bizarre talk about border security from a president who clearly doesn't know the first thing about the border. Republican leaders need to stand up to the president, put an end to this madness &amp; reopen the gov't, before our country suffers even more. https://t.co/ylAlyGEQx0
Last night, @POTUS let the #TrumpShutdown begin.		Rather than agree to a bipartisan compromise, he's holding the gov't hostage in an anti-immigrant tantrum.		Who pays the price? Hardworking New Mexicans who don't know when they'll see their next paycheck.
.@POTUS called a shutdown a ‚Äúsmall price to pay‚Äù‚Äî tell that to families in New Mexico &amp; across the nation who don't know when they‚Äôll see their next paycheck if the gov‚Äôt shuts down.		Trump claims to care about working people, but doesn't mind extorting them to suit his agenda.
The Trump administration says we can‚Äôt afford investments in:		-healthcare	-the environment	-education	-good jobs	-SNAP		But they want to hold us hostage for $5 billion in taxpayer dollars? Backwards doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe this administration‚Äôs priorities. #TrumpShutdown
New Mexicans can‚Äôt afford the #TrumpShutdown, and we don‚Äôt support a border wall. https://t.co/zaImMDr1vP
My flight from NM just landed &amp; I‚Äôm on my way to vote NO on Trump holding government hostage to waste &gt;$5 billion in taxpayer money.	 	The Senate already passed a bipartisan bill to keep government open. Put an end to this madness so New Mexico families can enjoy holiday season.
.@POTUS couldn‚Äôt make it more clear: he is more than happy to shut down the government for the sake of his wasteful border wall.	 	Ignoring your responsibilities to the American people isn‚Äôt leadership. It‚Äôs a temper tantrum. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/8W8F9OOB50
With his latest anti-immigrant tantrum, @POTUS is threatening the livelihoods of thousands of hardworking New Mexicans if he doesn't get his border wall.	 	He‚Äôs holding the gov‚Äôt hostage for the sake of his own wasteful agenda. That isn‚Äôt leadership. That‚Äôs political extortion.
The Trump admin has cut corners throughout their reckless attempts to sell off the Arctic refuge: shutting out experts, ignoring science &amp; now rushing a key environmental impact report.		But the fight isn‚Äôt over. We will keep working to protect the Arctic.	https://t.co/4WYc1BuQim
My Farmers of Tomorrow Act is good news for NM, and I‚Äôm proud it passed in the #FarmBill. Getting the next generation into agriculture is key to a thriving economy. That‚Äôs why this bill opens up financial resources for young farmers and ranchers to get started.
The Trump admin is proposing SNAP restrictions that will hurt working families in NM and across the US. @POTUS already tried to get this passed‚Äî the Senate rejected it.		Since democracy didn't work in his favor, he's trying to write the rules by himself? We won‚Äôt stand for it.
Syria‚Äîlike Yemen‚Äîneeds a diplomatic solution. And Congress needs to reassert its Constitutional authority over the use of military force. https://t.co/XMZp1mKMfA
There are legitimate questions about the reasoning &amp; process of @POTUS' Syria announcement. But we must remember Congress never authorized de-facto invasion of Syria in the first place‚Äì-so I have opposed using U.S. forces in this complicated civil war, no matter who is president.

New Mexico is one of the states with the most at stake in this fight. Take it from a border state senator: we cannot afford a government shutdown ‚Äì and we don‚Äôt need the president‚Äôs wall.
.@POTUS says he‚Äôd be ‚Äúproud to shut down the government‚Äù just to get his hateful, wasteful wall. No leader should ever be ‚Äúproud‚Äù to let the country suffer through a shutdown.

Great to see @TIME honor some true heroes as the #TIMEPOY: members of the #FreePress who sacrificed freedom &amp; even their lives in pursuit of truth.

New Mexico is leading the way in solar and wind power, so we know what a key role clean energy plays in a more prosperous future. Having a @FERC Commissioner who is so biased against renewable energy would be bad for New Mexico, bad for our markets, and bad for our future.

From enduring the brutal Bataan Death March to braving the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, our veterans and service members from New Mexico and across the country have proudly answered the call to duty. We must strive to serve them as well as they served us.
On #VeteransDay, and every day, we honor the men and women who have sacrificed so much to protect our American values.	 	I'm committed to getting every veteran &amp; military family the care they‚Äôve earned‚Äî we owe them a great debt, even though it is one we can never fully repay. https://t.co/ODT1OuJhOf
In honor of Veterans Day, you can visit some of New Mexico‚Äôs most beautiful @BLMNational sites free of charge on Sunday. What a great chance for families to explore the outdoor spaces that define our history and our heritage! Find your park at: https://t.co/485B4KCjUA https://t.co/Ij8vEwKgDh

Today, we all woke up to tragic news: another act of senseless gun violence. Our hearts are with the victims in Thousand Oaks, their families &amp; the brave first responders who lost one of their own.		We can't grow numb to gun violence. It can't be the status quo. We need to act.
102 years ago today, Jeanette Rankin made history as the first woman elected to Congress‚Äî so inspiring as we celebrate the record number of women who ran for &amp; won office last night.	 	One thing is for sure: more women in office means an even brighter future for our country. https://t.co/Iu5XuPktks
Any effort to interfere in the Mueller investigation would cause a constitutional crisis. Unfortunately, we have reason to fear @POTUS firing AG Sessions is an attempt to do just that.		Acting AG Whitaker has publicly criticized the investigation &amp; should recuse himself from it.
The people of #NM &amp; the nation want expanded access to quality health care &amp; investments in education and good jobs. They want us to come together and get to work on their priorities. Let's take that message seriously &amp; build a future that works for everyone.
Yesterday, voters in New Mexico and across this country voted to turn the page ‚Äì and to stand up for the fundamental values that make our state and our nation strong. We voted to reject the politics of fear, hatred, and division.
It's vital everyone make their voice heard on #ElectionDay. It‚Äôs equally important to know your rights.

Ending the pay gap for Hispanic women is a moral &amp; economic imperative for #NM, where 100s of thousands of Hispanic women are working to put food on the table for their families.		We can't accept a reality where Hispanic women are making 47% less than white men. #47PercentCounts
It takes a Hispanic woman almost two years to make what a white man makes in one year.	 	That‚Äôs unacceptable. On #LatinaEqualPayDay, we mark the 11 extra months Hispanic women must work to earn equal pay. We must close the pay gap for women across #NM and the US. https://t.co/esmlctyj1u
One thing both parties used to agree on? Protecting the #ArcticRefuge from development. But now the Trump admin &amp; many in the GOP want to drill there, destroying this treasured land.	 	I wrote for @patagonia about why we need to act fast &amp; save the Arctic. https://t.co/SD8g0JtBxA

Throughout our history, we‚Äôve seen the power of young people to make change, and I am so heartened by this generation‚Äôs activism, engagement and commitment to making things better.
And at @NMSU, I spoke with an incredible group of engaged, informed students &amp; got their perspective on where our nation is headed.		From getting out the vote to taking on climate change, they're involved in many key issues that will determine the future of NM &amp; the country. https://t.co/5gAgzQVrI7
I hosted the Student Leadership Institute in Alamogordo for high schoolers from across southern NM.

To stay connected, rural NM needs access to high-speed broadband‚Äîfull stop. Communities can‚Äôt get ahead without it.	 	Closing this digital divide is one of my top priorities.

We have to stay strong. We need to come together and work together to protect and improve our health care and solve problems‚Äî not use refugees and immigrants as political scapegoats.
Today, @POTUS is yet again sowing division, stoking fear &amp; demonizing immigrants‚Äî but New Mexico won‚Äôt be fooled. If @POTUS tries to sign this unconstitutional order, we'll fight back. https://t.co/PibdvpVsr8
Starting Thursday, you can sign up for health care or renew a plan through the #ACA at https://t.co/NMhRtuxJFb.

Appalled by this act of violence &amp; hatred inside a house of worship, where all deserve to feel safe. Jill &amp; I send our deepest sympathies to all affected.		We can't accept this senseless gun violence as the status quo. And our leaders must end the rhetoric of hate &amp; division.

Cannon is a key asset with a bright future. I will keep working with the community and pressing the Air Force for results.		I won't rest until the families and businesses who have been hurt by this crisis are safe and made whole. Anything less is unacceptable.
I'm grateful to all of those in Clovis who took the time to explain their frustrations and fears today. I will keep fighting until you have the answers you need, and we ensure the safe drinking water every single family, rancher and farmer deserves. https://t.co/1e8ksTXIsZ
Sat down with Cannon AFB leadership to discuss &amp; get answers about how USAF will protect from and clean up possible water contamination from PFOS chemicals in the surrounding area. Later, I met with local community members to hear directly from them about this serious situation.
Agriculture is a critical part of New Mexico‚Äôs economy &amp; way of life. Today I sat down with farmers from across eastern New Mexico to talk frankly about the issues impacting them‚ÄîI look forward to our continued conversations &amp; to finding new ways to support their vital work. https://t.co/dbHdNCmFWJ
This politically motivated violence has no place in the United States. We all have a responsibility to condemn these despicable tactics and to set a better example for the nation. I extend my deepest gratitude to law enforcement for their work to ensure public safety.

It was great to hear about the ways the #ACA and expanded Medicaid has helped rural hospitals &amp; clinics here in eastern New Mexico. I‚Äôm focused on making sure rural communities have access to the health care resources they need‚Äîand these programs are an instrumental part of that.
The opportunity to hear from local leaders‚Äî who discussed their successes &amp; obstacles‚Äî reminds me why I fight to make sure rural New Mexico communities have all the resources they need to thrive.
Today in Santa Rosa &amp; Fort Sumner, I got to sit down with hardworking New Mexicans who are key to our rural communities‚Äô businesses and gov‚Äôts. Talking to them was a great reminder of how strong our state is when we all come together to serve the community. https://t.co/EvwQanBvuC

The Trump admin has announced they‚Äôre fine using taxpayer $$ to fund ‚Äújunk plans" that gut coverage of preexisting conditions.	 	Our healthcare system should be focused on covering all Americans, not leaving the vulnerable out in the cold. Let's keep junk plans off the market.
With all of the challenges we face as a nation, these kinds of divisive policies are not what America needs. Once again, the Trump administration is rolling back hard-fought progress when what our country really needs is to keep moving forward.	https://t.co/OlO2nRGblV

#NM is in the bullseye of climate change, &amp; we see firsthand how urgent this is.	  	It's time for @POTUS &amp; GOP Leaders to join most of America &amp; the rest of the world to take action. We have the skills &amp; ability to do it. Now we need the political will.
Today, I joined @SenMarkey to sound the alarm on climate change. We need immediate action. We only have 12 years to slash greenhouse gas emissions in half. 12 years to prevent catastrophe.	 	That‚Äôs the conclusion of 91 scientists from 40+ countries. https://t.co/ZwYGHZeLra

To those angered &amp; hurt by Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation, I hope you will continue to fight for the values that make this nation great. I will keep fighting ‚Äì because as frustrated as I am, I am inspired by your courage, which I have witnessed firsthand over these trying weeks.
The #SCOTUS fight divided the nation.	 	To those in #NM who supported Kavanaugh: I know we can disagree without doubting our shared love of this country. I voted No because I believe Brett Kavanaugh did not prove himself worthy of a seat on #SCOTUS.	 	I hope he proves me wrong.
Before his nomination, Judge Kavanaugh showed a philosophy that sides with the powerful at the expense of working people across #NM.	 	But what we learned about Judge Kavanaugh during this confirmation process may be an even greater reason to oppose him.	 	I voted NO.
In the wake of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford‚Äôs courageous testimony, survivors across #NM have reached out to tell me about their own experiences with sexual violence.	 	With their permission, I‚Äôm sharing some of their incredible words with you. https://t.co/5VwhzI14zH

This investigation wasn‚Äôt a search for truth. It was yet another example of Senate Republicans and the president doing everything they could to push this nomination through, with little regard for our Constitutional responsibility to advise &amp; consent.
It's clear @POTUS &amp; @SenateGOP put arbitrary limits on the investigation. Up to 40 witnesses tried to come forward, but didn't get contacted or interviewed. The FBI didn‚Äôt even talk to Dr. Ford‚Äîthe brave woman whose allegations they were to investigate‚Äî or to Kavanaugh himself.
A meaningful FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Judge Kavanaugh should have been a thorough, unbiased look into the facts about what happened. But the report the Senate has seen is anything but thorough.

We MUST halt these proceedings not just for the integrity of #SCOTUS, but to work toward a culture where survivors of sexual violence know they will be heard, supported &amp; respected. If @POTUS won‚Äôt call for an FBI investigation, he should withdraw Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination.
I watched today‚Äôs @SenJudiciary hearing. I listened intently to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford‚Äôs harrowing testimony. I believe her.	 	It is outrageous that @SenateGOP is moving forward with a vote tomorrow. The vote must be canceled.

The Constitution requires @POTUS to seek congressional approval for war. This legislation will send a clear signal that Congress is re-asserting its Constitutional authority, ending the looming threat of war to make our nation, and the world, safer.
The consequences of war with Iran would be catastrophic, risking countless lives, our national security &amp; our international reputation. The only way to stop Iran‚Äôs dangerous behavior is with tough diplomacy in league with our allies, not threats &amp; reckless aggression.
The Trump administration is taking us down an all-too-familiar path toward war in the Middle East, this time with Iran. Today, I introduced legislation to stop @POTUS from launching an unconstitutional war against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress. https://t.co/S1JELsa6Vi
With multiple serious &amp; deeply disturbing allegations now levied against Judge Kavanaugh, we must have‚Äî at a minimum‚Äî an immediate halt to these proceedings to allow for a full FBI background investigation, and for the Senate to hear from all relevant witnesses.

More than a century later, the Trump admin. is launching illegal attacks on our national monuments, &amp; on Teddy Roosevelt's legacy.	 	The DC Circuit Court will decide on @POTUS' illegal attacks. And let me be clear: only Congress has the authority to change a monument designation.
On this day in 1906, Teddy Roosevelt designated the 1st National Monument. Today, #NM has 10 National Monuments of our own, each of which shows why we're the Land of Enchantment.	 	Let's follow in Teddy Roosevelt's footsteps‚Äî and protect our precious lands for future generations.
Top foreign policy minds agree: @POTUS should stop threatening Iran with hostile rhetoric &amp; try some diplomacy.	 	That's why I'm intro'ing legislation that reflects the Constitution: the Trump admin needs Congressional approval if they want war with Iran. https://t.co/4uLYykjXRB
The Senate should halt all proceedings on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination until a full and independent background investigation has been conducted by the FBI into the serious allegations against him.
It shouldn't be difficult to treat Dr. Ford with the respect and dignity she deserves. These attempts by Senate Republicans to pressure Dr. Ford and force through this nomination -- with callous ultimatums and arbitrary deadlines -- must stop.

Senate GOP &amp; @POTUS need to do right by Dr. Ford. Right now, they are sending the wrong message to women.	 	We must not contribute to the culture of fear. We must build a culture where women feel safe telling their stories. Bullying brave women who come forward does the opposite.

I'm so proud of that work, but we can do more when it comes to making sure the promise of #VAWA is fully realized for all women. #VAWA expires on Sept. 30, so we need to work hard for reauthorization while modernizing &amp; strengthening it to protect the most vulnerable.
24 years ago #VAWA became law. Importantly, with each renewal of #VAWA, we've extended critical protections further‚Äî in 2013, we worked to get better protections for Native women, who are at far too high a risk of violence.
A shameful new low: @POTUS is denying official reports that nearly 3,000 Americans died in #PuertoRico due to #HurricaneMaria.

Considering the sheer number of documents still being shielded from the Senate &amp; the public, we may have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs willful misunderstanding of the rights held by Native communities.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs hearing underscored the danger his nomination poses to Indian Country. His position on the trust relationship between tribes and the United States gov't is dismissive, often outright hostile, and altogether runs against decades of precedent. https://t.co/70ONBX7Uzx

The Constitution requires the president to ‚Äútake care that the laws be faithfully executed,‚Äù but instead @POTUS plans to DEFY the law to keep families in detention. What about his oath of office?

Native Hawaiians have a special trust relationship w/ the US‚Äî Judge #Kavanaugh‚Äôs failure to recognize that is another reason why I am voting NO.

Republican AGs are suing to scrap protections for pre-existing conditions‚Äî&amp; despite promises, the Trump Admin is on their side. Once again, they‚Äôre trying to take healthcare from the 100s of thousands in #NM &amp; millions across the country who need it most. https://t.co/rBUZYMXXIm
We must empower all tribal communities to provide victims the services they need. I'm proud of progress we made on this in the last Violence Against Women Act &amp; I know we can build on it when we reauthorize #VAWA. I'm committed to vastly improving safety of Native women &amp; girls.
Often the public doesn‚Äôt know the extent of this violence, so we established National Day of Awareness for Missing &amp; Murdered Native Women &amp; Girls. As Vice Chair of @IndianCommittee I'm focused on collaborating w/colleagues, law enforcement &amp; tribal communities on real solutions.
Crimes against Native women too often go unreported, undocumented, or uninvestigated. The high rates of missing Native girls &amp; women is alarming &amp; must have the full attention of the @IndianCommittee #MMIW https://t.co/NNkKJBiH6s
One year ago, @POTUS rescinded #DACA &amp; left #NM‚Äôs 8,000 #DREAMers in limbo. Instead of working on a solution, he's dealt in anti-immigrant rhetoric &amp; rejected bipartisan fixes. I won't stop fighting until #DREAMers can live out their futures in the only home they've ever known.
I oppose Judge #Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination, and I am demanding Senate #Republicans halt these proceedings. @POTUS has possible felonies hanging over his head. President Trump should not be able to appoint a justice who could rule on his own legal issues. https://t.co/hbwO5VtEBS

A billionaire @POTUS is trying to cancel the raises of 22,000 hardworking New Mexicans, citing the "budget."	 	@POTUS wasn't concerned about the budget when he signed the #GOPTaxScam‚Äîblowing a $1.5 trillion dollar hole in the deficit to pay for tax cuts for the rich. https://t.co/vmzb4i77Sk

The court ordered @POTUS to reunify children &amp; parents a month ago. 565 kids, many younger than 5, are still separated from families. Our amendments support the well-being of children in #HHS custody, but @POTUS needs a plan to rectify this inhumanity now. #FamiliesBelongTogether
By ripping these families apart, @POTUS has inflicted unconscionable harm on innocent kids. The policy is completely un-American, and made worse by the fact that these kids are in unstable and potentially unsafe environments.
I'm working with @MartinHeinrich to hold Trump administration accountable for its continued failure to reunite families they tore apart. Our amendments mandate real transparency and require @HHSGov to provide better care for children still in its custody. https://t.co/Kdv63yFn6F

Congress is a coequal branch of government, &amp; GOP leaders need to put country before party. We must act immediately to protect the special counsel. And we should NOT be rushing a lifetime #SCOTUS appointment while this cloud of corruption is hanging over the administration.
Today, the president's campaign chairman was convicted on 8 counts. The president's personal lawyer admitted--under oath--that @realDonaldTrump directed him to violate campaign finance laws.		No amount of desperate spin from @POTUS can change those facts.

The fact that a federal court had to order the Trump EPA to ban a toxic chemical linked to brain damage in children is another disturbing sign of this administration‚Äôs priorities. Read my full statement: https://t.co/UvGPViHANo https://t.co/YuDKO79FH8
Last year, I introduced a bill to #BanChlorpyrifos--because the Trump EPA refused to act to protect children &amp; farmworkers. And today, a federal court is telling the EPA that there was ‚Äúno justification‚Äù for rejecting the science and keeping #chlorpyrifos on the market.
The Trump @EPA reversed the ban on #chlorpyrifos, a toxic pesticide linked to brain damage in kids. They put the profits of Dow Chemical ahead of the safety of our children.	 	Now, a federal court is telling EPA it must #BanChlorpyrifos. This is a major victory for public health. https://t.co/UcTDfrqEaq
Any conglomerate this large would undermine independence and shut out diverse voices in the media &amp; local broadcasting. This merger was especially dangerous under the leadership of Sinclair, which misled the @FCC to try and get this deal approved. https://t.co/3HlnrFztAl
The termination of the Sinclair-Tribune merger is good news for people who depend on reliable local news to stay informed. Proud to have worked with @SenatorCantwell &amp; countless Americans who spoke up &amp; helped stop this unprecedented corporate consolidation of local broadcasting.
Excited to see that #NM is the No. 8 #AmeriState in the country. It‚Äôs wonderful that so many young people get involved in @AmeriCorps programs, dedicating themselves to service in our communities. https://t.co/YkDCpRpHu9
In Congress, I‚Äôm going to keep working to make sure that Native Americans, and all Americans, can fully exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in our democracy.	https://t.co/nRSEo65m6y
To this day, our work to carry on Miguel Trujillo's legacy--to ensure that every Native American and every American can exercise their right to vote--continues.	 	Voter suppression efforts across the country are putting undemocratic barriers on the voting rights of millions.
70 years ago, a federal court affirmed the right of Native Americans to vote in New Mexico. The plaintiff in that case was Miguel Trujillo, Sr.‚Äìan unsung hero in #NM history. https://t.co/4QDgTXgosT

As a former prosecutor, I call this obstruction of justice. No one is above the law‚Äînot even the president. People in New Mexico and across the country are tired of ultra-rich and powerful people like Donald Trump trying to abuse their power to protect themselves. https://t.co/J9gemadgRr
The Trump @EPA has never met a toxic chemical it doesn‚Äôt like. The EPA‚Äôs job is to protect public health. Our request is simple: take #TCE off the shelves before more Americans are hurt.
Under the Obama administration, the @EPA proposed banning #TCE because it causes cancer &amp; liver, kidney, and neurological damage. But when @POTUS took over, the Trump administration listened to its friends in the chemical industry &amp; decided not to move forward with the bans.
WATCH LIVE: I'm standing with Americans whose loved ones have been hurt by the toxic chemical #TCE. It's time for the Trump @EPA to stop dragging its feet and ban this dangerous chemical once and for all. https://t.co/RjI4tNDSoK

What we are seeing is dangerous &amp; unprecedented. Real action is needed to protect our democracy.		Congress must protect the Mueller probe. And GOP leaders in Congress should convene oversight hearings on @POTUS' bizarre and reckless approach to Russia and NATO.

We should not consider this #SCOTUS nomination legitimate -- not until we return to a real advise and consent process as required by the Constitution.
.@POTUS has farmed out the selection of his #SCOTUS nominee to far-right interest groups. The result is that a majority of the country is being left with no voice on an appointment that could span decades.
Make no mistake: these extreme, far-right groups put Judge Kavanaugh's name on their wish list for a reason. #SCOTUS
.@POTUS pulled Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs name from a pre-approved list concocted by radical special interests that are committed to undermining a woman‚Äôs right to choose, health care protections, safeguards for workers &amp; seniors, LGBTQ rights, &amp; so many other critical public protections.
It is the Senate‚Äôs constitutional duty to advise and consent on #SCOTUS nominees. But after @SenateMajLdr made a mockery of the #SCOTUS nomination process, the only advice and consent that @POTUS has sought out is from the extreme, right-wing groups who hand-picked this nominee. https://t.co/L8dMsIdC6N
Let‚Äôs not forget: Scott #Pruitt was carrying out Donald Trump‚Äôs toxic policies at the EPA. And there‚Äôs no indication Andrew Wheeler will be any different. We can‚Äôt stop fighting back. https://t.co/AChqjdqHdK
The American people‚Äôs disgust with Scott Pruitt should serve as blaring red siren for the Trump administration. Americans will not tolerate another EPA administrator whose primary goal is to fight the core mission of the EPA.
Scott Pruitt‚Äôs tenure at EPA was an utter disgrace. He treated his position as a golden ticket for his own personal benefit ‚Äì at the expense of the health and wellbeing of American families and the environment. #Pruitt should have been fired long ago. https://t.co/gEdbT69WOd
We are not Americans just because of an oath, or a piece of paper. We are Americans because of an idea: the idea of freedom and justice for all.

The #CapitalGazette shooting is a horrifying tragedy. My thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, &amp; all affected by this appalling act.		Now more than ever, every public official must speak up to defend the free press. And we must act to end such senseless gun violence.
If the McConnell rule was in place in the 2016 election year, it should be in place in 2018. Given @POTUS' attacks on due process and the rule of law, we should let the people speak before we consider his next #SCOTUS nominee.

.@POTUS must seek a new authorization from Congress to wage war in #Syria. I will continue to push Congress to debate and pass an #AUMF and require the administration to fully explain its strategy, and the cost, impact on American troops, and the parameters of its plans in Syria.
This isn‚Äôt reality TV ‚Äî tough talk with no long-term strategy puts the Syrian people, American troops, and our allies in danger. The U.S can‚Äôt afford to be dragged deeper into the Syrian civil war, and doing so risks a great power conflict.
Assad‚Äôs violence is horrendous, &amp; he must be held to account by the international community for the many thousands of his fellow Syrians he has murdered. But @POTUS is dangerously escalating the situation in #Syria by acting w/ no legal authority &amp; no consistent, thoughtful plan.

Every day we neglect these programs, more people will suffer.  	 	It's time for GOP leaders to stop the partisan gamesmanship, put American families' health first, and work with Democrats to reauthorize these programs immediately.

In #NM, 17 community health center clinics serve 330,000 patients in 90 underserved &amp; rural communities. They employ almost 3,000 people across the state.		Republican refusal to reauthorize the Community Health Centers Program puts these patients and these jobs at risk.
GOP inaction has put access to affordable health care for over 11,000 #NM kids &amp; their families in danger. These families deserve to know‚Äîdoes our nation still believes they deserve every chance to lead healthy, successful lives? We must #ExtendCHIP &amp; keep our promise to them.

Republicans are within hours of passing their #GOPTaxScam in a late night Senate vote. I was on the Senate Floor fighting for working families and opposing this #GOPTaxScam. WATCH: https://t.co/hI1jh4b3x8
BREAKING: House Republicans just passed the #GOPTaxScam to give massive tax cuts to corporations &amp; America's wealthiest -- paid for by working families. The final vote is just hours away in the Senate. The American people deserve better, I'm voting no.
Every week hundreds of Dreamers across the country are losing their protected status because of @POTUS' heartless decision to end #DACA. Congress must act. We have a bill, the Republicans should allow a vote. #DreamActNow
While Republicans are busy rushing their #GOPTaxScam through before the holidays, they are neglecting the 800,000 young people at risk of deportation. We need a #DreamActNow
Communities in #NM depend on strong environmental programs to protect clean air and water, and keep families healthy. Harmful riders that gut these programs have no place in mandatory budget bills. Join us in demanding #NoPoisonPills https://t.co/ExZ5lLGQIO

Dreamers are scared they will be deported from the only country they have ever known. States are running out of money to provide kids‚Äô health insurance. Meanwhile‚Ä¶Republicans are passing a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. #DreamActNow #FundCHIPNow #GOPTaxScam
Let the GOP know you‚Äôre paying attention and you oppose the #GOPTaxScam to raise taxes on the middle class and force cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the budget for everything from infrastructure to scientific research to environmental programs.
Republicans will take a vote on the #GOPtaxscam as early as TOMORROW. But they can still vote it down and choose to work with Democrats on common-sense tax reform to help working families, not just corporations and the super rich. Keep calling and making your voices heard.
Dreamers represent the very best of our nation. They are ambitious, talented, passionate young people who want nothing more than to work, get an education, care for their families and contribute to their communities. They deserve protection, they deserve #DreamActNow
We have almost 800,000 young people whose lives, dreams, and future hang in the balance. They are scared, their families are scared, and everything they have worked for is at risk. Tell Congress we need to pass the #DREAMActNow
Wishing everyone celebrating the festival of lights in New Mexico and across the country a very happy #Hanukkah
UPDATE: A last minute addition to the #GOPTaxScam would personally enrich President Trump, his family, and other billionaire real estate developers. Now they‚Äôre trying to rush it through Congress days before Christmas. https://t.co/l8PF8kVfdW
The Republicans are trying desperately to give their billionaire donors a big gift before the holidays. But there's still time to stop this #GOPTaxScam--call Congress before it's too late. https://t.co/6dmVREngq9

States across America are running out of funding to help the 9,000,000 children who rely on #CHIP--but Republicans are focused on passing a massive tax cut for corporations and the ultra-wealthy. This is simply inexcusable, we must act to #FundCHIPNow.
It's been 75 days since GOP let #CHIP expire which provides health care for 9,000,000 children. Senate GOP made the time to pass tax cuts for millionaires. They‚Äôve voted to open the #ArcticRefuge to drilling. Yet they continue to ignore children's health.
5 years after #SandyHook, congress has made no progress on commonsense gun laws. Just last week, yet another school‚Äîthis time in #NM‚Äîwas touched by a devastating act of gun violence. It is long past time to act to prevent gun violence‚Äîwe owe it to our children &amp; communities.
Today‚Äôs vote to repeal #NetNeutrality rules is a major blow to the internet as we know it. @AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs legacy will be leading the surrender of the free &amp; open internet to corporations, letting ISPs create internet toll lanes, &amp; stifling online competition, innovation &amp; dynamism
Too many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, are already stuck in an internet slow lane. We should be working to expand broadband access and bridge the digital divide ‚Äî not repealing #NetNeutrality rules and destroying essential protections for a free and open internet.
One thing is clear, the internet is an essential aspect of everyday life. It is not a luxury, it has become a necessity and it should remain free and open to every New Mexican and every American. #ProtectNetNeutrality
Who are @FCC Republicans listening to as they dismantle #NetNeutrality? It‚Äôs certainly not the millions &amp; millions of Americans pleading with them to keep the internet free &amp; open.
I want to thank the many advocates for #chemicalsafety who spoke out against #Dourson ‚Äî especially the brave families who lost loved ones due to unsafe and unscrupulous practices. Their willingness to share their personal experiences truly made a difference for others.
I am glad Michael Dourson did the right thing and withdrew his nomination to head the EPA's chemical safety office. As someone who has spent his career working for weaker safety standards for dangerous chemicals, he was a terrible choice, and he faced bipartisan opposition.
He told me that DACA has given him ‚Äúwings,‚Äù and the freedom to work and study at NMSU to pursue his dream of becoming an engineer. He is also a volunteer firefighter and wants to give back to his community. He deserves to feel safe in his home. #DreamActNow
Carlos has lived in the US since he was a baby.

Los Dreamers son tan Nuevo Mexicanos y americanos como yo‚Äîy no deber√≠an vivir con miedo constante en el √∫nico pa√≠s que ellos conocen. Miedo a ser deportados, perder sus trabajos, y no poder seguir adelante con sus estudios #DreamActAhora, #DreamActNow
Dreamers are every bit as New Mexican and American as I am and this is the only country they've ever known. They shouldn‚Äôt have to live in constant fear of deportation, losing their ability to work, or being unable to finish school #DreamActNow

The majority of Americans agree; drilling doesn't belong in the #GOPTaxScam and it doesn't belong in the #ArcticRefuge. 	https://t.co/wAW2j6qZ6v
Republicans are getting closer to passing their #GOPTaxScam &amp; it still includes drilling in the #ArcticRefuge. Americans don't want massive tax cuts for the ultra rich and they definitely don't want to destroy our public lands to pay for it. https://t.co/buxgDoJnQZ
There‚Äôs still time to stop this bill. The Republican margin is razor thin. Keep burning up the phones &amp; tell GOP leaders what you think of this #GOPTaxScam before it‚Äôs too late.
Meanwhile, the #GOPTaxScam‚Äôs attack on the #ACA will leave 13 million Americans without health care. And it will cause out of pocket costs to soar across the country.
The #GOPTaxScam‚Äôs $1.5 TRILLION deficit hole will mean a huge tax increase on most Americans down the road ‚Äî in the form $12,500 in debt per family and GOP cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
BREAKING: Republicans say they‚Äôve reached a deal on their #GOPTaxScam. Here‚Äôs the big picture: huge tax cuts for the rich and for big corporations. Skyrocketing health care premiums and huge deficits for the rest of the country to pay off.
@FCC Too many New Mexicans, especially in rural areas, are already stuck in the internet slow lane. Instead of rolling back #NetNeutrality  that protects internet openness, we should be finding ways to make affordable high-speed broadband accessible for everyone.
If @FCC Republicans succeed in rolling back #NetNeutrality tomorrow, internet service providers will be able to block, slow &amp; throttle internet service for certain sites. Meaning NM students, small biz owners &amp; everyday consumers could see slower download speeds &amp; higher prices.
I stand with @SenGillibrand, a consummate professional and an excellent senator. @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs tweet is disgusting for a childish bully, and it‚Äôs wildly out of line for a POTUS. @realDonaldTrump absolutely should apologize and remove his tweet. https://t.co/XeOgvLNebp

Thank you @jimmykimmel &amp; Billy for raising awareness of the egregious neglect by Republicans not to fund the Children's Health Insurance Program (while trying instead to pass massive tax cuts for their donors). It's time to prioritize the health of our children and #FundCHIPNow https://t.co/UBCHrztFxF
Among the NM families who are unsure what will happen to their kid's health insurance is Colton‚Äôs. He was 8 yrs old when he was diagnosed w/ cancer. Without #CHIP, his treatment would've cost his family 100s of dollars a month- close to the cost of rent. We must protect his care. https://t.co/TGGhxU1qVz
It's been 2 1/2 months since the GOP let the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program expire while they were busy passing tax cuts for billionaires. 9 million American children-including 11,000 in NM-depend on CHIP for health care &amp; states are starting to run out of money #FundCHIPNow https://t.co/tbYSmig7nW
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC The @FCC's primary responsibility is protecting consumers and public interest, not reducing competition for big corporations and protecting their bottomline, but eliminating #NetNeutrality  rigs the playing field in favor of big business, hurting entrepreneurs and ordinary people https://t.co/w2MgP5DJGv
On THURSDAY, the Republicans on the @FCC intend to vote to eliminate #NetNeutrality . We are asking @AjitPaiFCC to abandon his reckless plan to radically alter the free and open internet as we know it. https://t.co/LdUWo4AsAk
The #GOPTaxScam will add over a TRILLION dollars to the deficit. How are they going to pay for it? They‚Äôre already talking about cuts to programs that help seniors and those most in need, like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid and food assistance. https://t.co/xndJeR6cgc
If the @HouseGOP gets their way, the #GOPTaxScam will eliminate the deduction for medical expenses. Americans with extensive medical costs could see their taxes go up tens of thousands of dollars per year. https://t.co/BHmSo6XlFW
The #GOPTaxScam is an attack on the #ACA. The nonpartisan @USCBO says the bill will result in even higher premiums and would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million. https://t.co/DaGpyXiwbT
The #GOPTaxScam doesn't just raise taxes for middle class families (to pay for tax cuts for the ultra rich), it jeopardizes their health. Here's how:
There are almost 8,000 DREAMers in NM at risk of deportation because of @POTUS' reckless decision to end #DACA. We should not be tearing apart families, we should be helping these young New Mexicans achieve their dreams. Tell Congress to act and pass the #DreamActNow.
There is no excuse for leaving almost 800,000 young people's lives, dreams, and future hanging in the balance.	 	It's time for a vote on the #DreamActNow, we can't wait any longer to protect our immigrant youth.
The GOP is rushing to pass their #GOPTaxScam because the more the American people learn about what‚Äôs in it, the more they oppose it. It's irresponsible- and immoral- to cut taxes for the ultra rich &amp; corporations while raising taxes &amp; cutting health care for middle class families
"How could anyone trust #Dourson to put public health before the interests of the clients he has spent decades defending?" We can't. The Senate must #RejectDourson.
#Dourson has made his living producing junk science for the chemical industry to help them weaken our safety standards. Now, @POTUS wants Dourson to run the EPA's chemical safety office. We can't let that happen. #ScienceForSale

We still have the chance to do one good thing with this #GOPTaxScam ‚Äî STRIKE the provision that would sell off the Arctic coastal plain without real hearings, consultation, public input. I‚Äôm voting to #ProtectTheArctic
Republicans are setting up a fiscal trainwreck by adding almost $1.5 trillion to the deficit, which threatens future government revenues &amp; long-term budgets for #NM families, schools, labs, bases, scientific research funding, &amp; public lands. Those are some outrageous priorities.
We could have had responsible bipartisan tax relief for middle class families. Instead we got the #GOPTaxScam for the very wealthy, multinational corporations &amp; private equity and hedge funds. And it was jammed through complete w/ scribbled notes &amp; no chance to read the details.

#GOPTaxScam will help corporations &amp; the ultra wealthy &amp; leave working Americans out to dry. It repeals the state and local tax deduction, a key provision for middle-class families, but reduces the estate tax - a tax break only 30 NM families are wealthy enough to benefit from.
The #GOPTaxScam treats corporations better than people. Corporations receive the only permanent tax cut while 1 in 3 working New Mexicans will see their taxes go UP by 2027.

3) The bill creates new loopholes for the mega-wealthy and tax dodgers, encourages multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas &amp; big corporations are getting the only permanent tax break - while small biz is getting the short end of the stick.
2) The GOP is using the tax plan as another opportunity to undermine the ACA. Their ACA repeal-without-replace provision to remove Obamacare's individual mandate will result in 13 million more uninsured Americans by 2027 and soaring health care premiums.
1) The GOP plan will hurt NM's working families while lining the pockets of the ultra wealthy. And according to the nonpartisan CBO report released yesterday, it's even worse than we thought. https://t.co/3kQ0rN3d9r

Democrats are united. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that #Dreamers can give back to their communities &amp; help build a better future.
#Dreamers are asking for their chance to achieve the American dream. We‚Äôre asking GOP to do what‚Äôs right &amp; help us codify that opportunity.
Democrats stand ready to pass the #DreamAct. Many Rs have signaled support for #Dreamers‚Äîbut the time for talk is over. Now they must act. https://t.co/2hF0YQZDQx

Carlos and the 800,000 #Dreamers like him "have proven ourselves of being worthy of being in the US.‚Äù Help me share his story if you agree.
Carlos grew up like every other American kid and knows no other country. He says #Dreamers ‚Äúwere given wings when we got #DACA permits.‚Äù
Carlos‚Äî#Dreamer, NMSU student &amp; volunteer firefighter‚Äîshared his story with me. He says ‚Äú#Dreamers need your support.‚Äù RT &amp; help #DefendDACA https://t.co/ChbuvhtO6c
I said before that Trump is increasingly unfit to be POTUS. His #DACA decision, following #Charlottesville &amp; Joe Arpaio, is more evidence.
#Dreamers' future is in the GOP‚Äôs hands. Now is the time to stand up &amp; speak out‚Äîlet your representatives know you want to #DefendDACA.
Trump‚Äôs decision is shameful. #Dreamers represent America's best‚Äîtalented, patriotic young people who want to give back to their communities
Ending #DACA is a cruel, short-sighted mistake that will hurt families and our economy. I will fight tooth and nail to defend #Dreamers. https://t.co/bk6LOR2wfo
On #LaborDay we celebrate the contributions of NM &amp; US workers &amp; their determination to ensure all families can achieve the American dream.

Jill &amp; I offer our heartfelt condolences to the family &amp; friends of former NM Rep. Lucky Varela. We join all of NM in mourning his passing.
.@POTUS‚Äô dangerous, hateful ideas aren't real solutions-we need comprehensive immigration reform &amp; an earned path to citizenship
A wall along the entire border would not increase security, it would cost billions in taxpayer $ and stand as a symbol of waste and bigotry.
DACA allowed thousands of young people to get legal status to continue their education &amp; contribute to the only country they've ever known.
The divisive threats from the Trump admin - to strip DACA &amp; build a border wall - are not what this nation of immigrants stands for.
I'm heartbroken by the horrific events in Clovis tonight. Please join Jill and me in keeping Clovis in your thoughts and prayers.

@USGLC @POTUS Eroding relationships with our neighbors and attacking international norms is not a sustainable economic strategy for New Mexico or the US.
@USGLC @POTUS Rhetoric about ‚Äúbuilding a wall‚Äù has strained relations w/ Mexico &amp; talk of tearing up NAFTA threatens economic development in #NewMexico.
@USGLC @POTUS In #NM, we feel direct and real implications of U.S. political and economic relations with other countries.
@USGLC Now @POTUS wants to cut $300M from PEPFAR‚Äôs budget &amp; cut the State Dept &amp; USAID 31%. I'm strongly opposed &amp; will fight those dangerous cuts.
@USGLC For example, President Bush created PEPFAR in 2003 to combat AIDS abroad. Today, it's saved 11.5M people &amp; 2M babies have been born HIV-free
@USGLC The world recognizes our leadership. From my seat on the Foreign Relations Cmte, I‚Äôve seen the good smartly targeted intern'l aid has done.

Strong #ChemicalSafety reform requires strong implementation‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to square dramatic cuts in EPA‚Äôs #dirtybudget with successful reform
@EPAScottPruitt Science is about evidence, not beliefs. And the evidence that we must #ActOnClimate is overwhelming. Ignoring the problem is not a solution.
.@EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs inability to articulate this Admin‚Äôs position on #ClimateChange‚Äîthe biggest existential threat we face‚Äîis beyond alarming
The sudden removal of the White House's #ClimateChange website is part of a troubling pattern of ignoring or hiding evidence of this threat.
Exposure scientists say Chlorpyrifos is a dangerous pesticide that threatens the American public. I'm pushing EPA to act to protect families
@POTUS #Superfund sites like the Bonita Peak Mining District, which includes the #GoldKingMine, need comprehensive remediation ‚Äì not a Band-Aid.
@POTUS #EPA proposes cutting 30% from #Superfund &amp; speeding up Superfund cleanup. I don't want focus on speed to lead to shortcuts &amp; lax standards.
@POTUS #Climatechange is a global crisis &amp; requires urgent global action. But #EPA &amp; @POTUS are making dangerous moves to isolate US fr the threat.
EPA proposed budget axes almost all $ to fight #climatechange. Sadly that goes hand in glove w/ @POTUS decision to renege on #ParisAgreement
Most Americans &amp; I see EPA's core responsibility is protecting public health, clean air &amp; H2O. #EPA seems to think it's to cater to industry
#EPA's dangerous proposed budget tells states to take the lead but cuts support to states by 45%. The end result will hurt clean air &amp; water

#Trumpcare would deal a crippling blow to the health and economic wellbeing of families in #NewMexico. Join me in speaking out against it.
The equation is simple. #Trumpcare means insurance companies will charge more and cover less.
#Trumpcare takes us back to the days when women had to pay more for services like maternity coverage.
Make no mistake: #Trumpcare gives insurance companies the power to charge people more for being sick.
#Trumpcare means health care taken away. The bill‚Äôs Medicaid cuts alone would strip 250,000 people across #NM of coverage.
#Trumpcare means jobs lost. This bill would cost #NewMexico 31,800 jobs over the next 10 years, cratering our already fragile economy.
