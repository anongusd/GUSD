@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady What happens when the next generation is 3%? 		Somehow we may be better off sticking together.
@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady Well, the choice might be to do what @fernandorivero did and get all your friends to join and vote as a block and take over leadership. Again, we all need to figure out what to do to address the declining vet pop and influence issues. So we are 7% of the pop now.
@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady Lots of work to do in this regard. In that declining pop of veterans, the only two growing demographics are women and minorities. Posts that aren’t welcoming both are not going to grow.
@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady Last year was the first that Gulf War era vets became more numerous than Vietnam and remaining Korea era veterans. Here’s the Q: without organizing in a meaningful way, how will veterans defend their rights and benefits in the future?
@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady Also, veterans should be very concerned about losing political influence over there decades to come. There are abt 22M veterans in the US today (pop 325M). If all variables hold constant, by 2043, the VA predicts there will be less than 15M in a pop of 438M.
@JRMoockjr @fernandorivero @iAmTheWarax @TrueBoots @lieutenant_lady What would you recommend the traditional VSOs do to meet the needs of younger generations of veterans?

@tcburkejr @iAmTheWarax @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ Bottom line, we're not going to turn away a vet asking for help. We are restricted, however, on membership. Hope that helps.
@tcburkejr @iAmTheWarax @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ These are important conversations to have. Community is important. It materially helps veterans and, when done right, can save lives.
@iAmTheWarax @tcburkejr @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ It is. Not to foist off the reality, but each of the Congressionally-chartered VSOs are literally chartered by Congress w/ their own membership criteria. It's a matter of law. Us: wartime vets. VFW: in theater combat vets. AMVETS: all vets. Etc... We don't make the rules.
@LaurenDownSouth @iAmTheWarax @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ Not sure. We're checking.
@tcburkejr @iAmTheWarax @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ And our service officers help ALL veterans, member or not, honorably discharged or not. We also assist vets with bad paper discharges appeal and have lawyers on staff to do so. We hold power of attorney on 750,000 vets...many of them are not members.
@34Ironhead @tcburkejr @iAmTheWarax @SeanPNickerson @AmericanLegion @VFWHQ We're a Congressionally chartered veteran service organization, so we have to abide by the law. Our membership criteria is here: https://t.co/DtNC9dACdd 1) Serve during wartime. 2) Be honorably discharged. So a DD214 and $40 generally gets it done.
We're checking in to why this vet was denied membership by a local post. Our membership criteria: 1) Serve during wartime, 2) be honorably discharged (see: https://t.co/Zvwt18onrd) Thanks @TaraCopp for shining a light on this #veteran's frustrating story.  https://t.co/17k9CpKvGY

@clusterbb @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Actually, @RANDCorporation just published a report on VA care vs private sector care. Check it out: https://t.co/aGbi0JWkNo
@clusterbb @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs @POTUS Actually, we represent 2,000,000 dues paying members. Together, the big 6 VSOs represent more than 5,000,000 veterans. The VA was making progress over the past two years, and now it is leaderless.
The lack of permanent leadership @DeptVetAffairs is starting to take a toll. @POTUS the VA needs strong, qualified leadership now! https://t.co/ayT1FKv7Ju
3) For outpatients, VA facilities performed better than commercial and Medicaid HMOs; and better or similarly to Medicare HMOs.
2)  On average, VA hospitals performed the same or "significantly better" than non-VA hospitals on almost all patient, mortality and effectiveness measures, researchers found. But on average they had worse readmissions.
Key takeaways are:		1) The Veterans Affairs medical system is working as well or better than non-VA care, researchers with the RAND Corporation found in a study released on Thursday, with the caveat that there was "high variation" in quality across facilities.

6/ We believe this legislation, as currently written, represents a fair compromise that will help to strengthen veterans’ healthcare for future generations while ensuring that veterans’ caregivers of all generations get the support they deserve.		Denise Rohan	National Commander
5/ When VA care is unavailable, we support the use of non-VA providers.  We also believe the Secretary of @DeptVetAffairs must remain the gatekeeper for healthcare and that veterans should not be expected to pay for care related to their service-connected disabilities.
4/  @AmericanLegion fully supports funding the VA to ensure our veterans receive the care they richly deserve.  We also strongly urge the VA to fill the more than 30,000 vacancies throughout the department to increase their organic capacity to deliver healthcare and benefits.
3/ Our 2M members believe the VA remains the best place for veterans to receive care for their illnesses and injuries.  The VA is more than a healthcare system.  It is a symbol of America’s commitment to our veterans, and it is a community where veterans care for each other.
2/ It also provides a responsible, long-term funding solution to the Veterans Choice Program.		The American Legion was instrumental in the creation of the VA following #WWI, and we have nearly 100 years of history working to ensure its success.
1/ Statement from @AmericanLegion Nat'l Commander Denise Rohan: 		H.R. 5674, the VA MISSION Act, provides necessary and critical improvements to @DeptVetAffairs current community care programs, expands the #veteran #caregiver program, and reviews the VA’s national infrastructure.

"In conclusion, the VA’s insurance programs provide valuable benefits and important financial security to service members, veterans, and their families given the extraordinary risks involved in military service." -- @Jeff__Steele
"... such as updating the antiquated mortality and annuity tables, increasing the maximum benefit cap, and extending the enrollment eligibility to 10 years."
"Legislation sponsored by Representative Stevan Pearce has been introduced in this Congress, H.R. 4146: the Disabled Veterans’Life Insurance Act of 2017, that would remedy many of the issues that currently exist with S-DVI program, ..."
"Others simply cannot afford to meet the costs of a policy at the time of separation."
"Though other government-sponsored programs may have existed when the servicemember was released from service, many veterans in their younger years may not have the foresight to take action on long-term financial matters, such as life insurance."
"For many severely disabled veterans, S-DVI is the only life insurance coverage available to them."
"Regarding the S-DVI program, these policies are issued for a maximum face value of $10,000. This amount has not been increased in almost six decades. By comparison, $10,000 in 1951 would be worth around $90,000 today adjusting for inflation."
"In addition, The American Legion, in speaking with attorneys representing TSGLI claimants, has learned that the military services are not consistently applying the proper burden of proof."
"The American Legion, in preparing for this testimony, found that this claims analyst position is no longer active. This raises the question of how VA is currently assessing consistency and quality of claims decisions."
"According to the report, VA's contractor created a claims analyst position to work with VA and the branches of service to review all incoming claims to validate decisions and develop reports to assess consistency of claims decisions across the branches of service."
"A 2009 GAO report found that fewer than 63% of claims filed for traumatic brain injury were approved.  GAO further found that the program lacked consistency across branches and lacked assurances that decisions about benefit payments were accurate."
"Regarding TSGLI, the program provides automatic traumatic injury coverage to all servicemembers covered under the SGLI program. TSGLI claims are adjudicated and decided by the military service department involved, and not by VA."
"The Government became a self-insurer because private insurance companies were unwilling to assume the unpredictable risks associated with war. The Government became the largest life insurer in the United States at the time with the coverage provided by this program."
"More than four million life insurance policies were issued during WWI.  As of 2017, there were just 124 active policies remaining, with the policy holder's average age of 95."
"The program was established to meet the needs of World War I veterans and represented the first foray into servicemember and veteran life insurance by the Federal government."
"But as a matter of historic note, 2019 marks the 100th anniversary of United States Government Life Insurance program or USGLI, just as it does for the American Legion."
"You have my written testimony, so in the time I have I’ll focus on the Traumatic Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance program, or TSGLI, and the Service-Disabled Veterans’ Insurance Program, or S-DVI."
"VA has entered into a group policy with the Prudential Insurance Company of America to administer these programs."
"The VA currently administers six life insurance programs, 4 closed and 2 open to new issues. In addition to the life insurance programs directly operated by the VA, the department also has general supervisory authority over two other major government life insurance programs."

“We wouldn’t have an issue with the bill if it contained the passage that is reflected in the VA handbook stating ‘or the veteran’s preferred prosthetist who agrees to accept the preferred provider rate,’ which unfortunately, this bill is missing.”
“American Legion is committed to ensuring all veterans, especially those with catastrophic injuries receive expert care, we just have to be careful that we don’t create a mechanism whereby the VA has no control over how care is delivered or how the government will pay for it.”
.@LouisCelli on #HR2322 The Injured and Amputee Veterans Bill of Rights: “At this time, we are unable to support HR 2322 … because it appears to be missing some language.”
“That said, we support HR 4635”
“VA’s hundreds of vet centers were built on that very premise and The American Legion continues to support relatable, individualized peer to peer counseling where veterans who have had similar experiences can share their stories and tactics for recovery.”
.@LouisCelli on #HR4635 Peer-to-Peer Counseling: “Peer to peer counseling has always been a preferred counseling medium long supported by The American Legion.”
“The American Legion supports this bill and looks forward to working with this committee to address all of the issues surrounding the consolidation of community care contracted programs.”
.@LouisCelli on #HR4334 Improving Oversight of Women Veterans’ Care Act: “We still need to address the inequities facing our women veterans who use the Choice program for gender specific healthcare needs.”
“… participation in a unified database that helps guard against drug interaction and duplication of prescriptions is an important step in ensuring veterans receive proper and accurate care.”
“In the absence of a single lifetime medical record that can be accessed and shared among all of a patients’ medical professionals …”
.@LouisCelli on #HR3832: “The Veterans Opioid Abuse Prevention Act will bring the VA online with state-based prescription monitoring programs.  This is in the best interest of patients and helps doctors provide holistic quality medicine at the federal level.”
Our friends of the 4th Estate hard at work. https://t.co/YYhDdOMPpv
“Will this solve the problem?  Not entirely, but what it will do is prove that we are willing to invest in high quality professionals that care for our wounded and ill veterans.”
“HR 1506 can help fix that by making VA a more attractive employment option for our healthcare community by offering to pay off some of their student debt.”
“Congressional leaders, the American people listen to you, media quotes you, your constituents look up to you – all of this negative exposure and lower pay standards is crippling the agency charged with taking of our nation’s warriors – we need to fix that.”
“We’re quick to pounce on VA’s missteps and shortcomings, but it’s rare that we gather in these rooms of congressional oversight and champion VA’s accomplishments.”
“The Department has been the subject of intense scrutiny over the past several years, and rightfully so, but along with that scrutiny comes responsibility, the responsibility to be fair and balanced.”
.@LouisCelli on #HR1506 VA Health Care Provider Education Debt Relief Act: “The Department of Veterans Affairs went from 33,000 vacancies in 2016 to 43,000 today – a 30% increase.”
“This draft legislation will call on VA to conduct the research necessary to determine of the cannabis plant, marijuana, has medicinal value, or not.  Our veterans are asking for this research, and our nation has an obligation to provide it.”
“… and yet The United States continues to lag behind other developed nations by restricting scientific research into this drug.”
“The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently reviewed 10,000 scientific abstracts on the therapeutic value of cannabis and reached nearly 100 conclusions in a 2017 report …”
“… because the United States Drug Enforcement Agency continues to insist that cannabis has, and I quote,  “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”
“There is no education that discusses medicinal uses, drug interaction, placebo effect, dosage rates, strains, or anything else regarding this plant …”
“And yet there isn’t a single physician who has been formally trained by an accredited US based medical school on what this plant can, and/or can’t do.”
“… and all fifty states have legalized one of its chemical derivatives:  Cannabidioil, or CBD”
.@LouisCelli on draft VA #MedicinalCannabis Research Act of 2018: “Today, 30 states have medical cannabis laws that allow patients to use cannabis for illnesses ranging from inflammation and pain, to epilepsy and cancer …”

@psgaygop @POTUS Additionally, many civilian doctors won't accept veterans as patients due to their extensive polytrauma. The requirements of these veterans care is beyond many civilian doctors capacity for care. This is a complicated issue.
@psgaygop @POTUS It's somewhat fashionable in some quarters to advocate for the privatization of the VA. The civilian healthcare system is already stressed. There is no wisdom in moving another +9M veterans into the civilian system. The American Legion is 100% opposed to privatizing the VA.
@psgaygop @POTUS We disagree. On balance, most veterans tell us they are happy with the quality of care they get from the VA. It’s the access to the care that is the main issue. VA is one of the largest integrated healthcare systems in the world with more than 9M veterans enrolled.

@Paulaminger1 @ConnectingVets We think Matt did a fine job on the radio. Or are you talking about the Choice hearing?
@LouisCelli @patriciakime @DeptVetAffairs @MilitaryTimes @LeoShane 2/ They described their situation to us as a catch-22: be in compliance w/ VA policy and federal law and continue to take "zombie" drugs (their words), or use cannabis w/ better outcomes, but place themselves at risk of losing VA benefits.
@LouisCelli @patriciakime @DeptVetAffairs @MilitaryTimes @LeoShane 1/ And another: veterans "must not be be denied VHA services solely because they are participating in State-approved marijuana programs." So many veterans using cannabis to treat service-connected illnesses are very concerned about loss of benefits.

...and the VA's new policy directive on #MedicalCannabis can be found here: https://t.co/97RLVZxhUH
We look forward to continuing to advise the Department of Veterans Affairs on this important initiative.	 	Denise Rohan	National Commander	The American Legion
This is why The American Legion, through Resolution 11, continues to call on the federal government to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances act to enable safe and efficient drug development research.
Many states believe cannabis is a drug with medical value and many studies, to include the recommendations of the National Academy of Medicine, support this contention.
We are pleased that the VA is now taking the full medical history of these veterans into consideration when evaluating their physical and mental health.
As long-time advocates for evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine, like Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, The American Legion believes Directive 1315 is an encouraging step in the right direction towards the accomplishment of American Legion Resolution 28.
This updated policy will help encourage veterans using medical cannabis to more openly and fully discuss their healthcare options with VA medical providers - with full reassurance that their VA benefits remain secure.
The American Legion applauds the @deptvetaffairs Directive 1315 which helps clarify access to Veterans Health Administration clinical programs for #veterans participating in state-approved #MedicalCannabis programs.

@AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin 3/ We look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin and his leadership team to make the VA more efficient, transparent, and effective in delivering improved healthcare options and outcomes to our nation’s veterans.”	 	Denise Rohan	National Commander	The American Legion
@AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin 2/ The Choice program, implemented in the wake 2014 wait-time scandal, was never intended to be a permanent program.  For many months, the Legion has advised the VA on ways to provide better, more timely care to veterans based on feedback of our 2M members around the world.
1/ @AmericanLegion applauds the Secretary of @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin for his efforts to improve #healthcare for #veterans by streamlining out-of-system community treatment options while strengthening care at VA facilities nationwide.

.@LouisCelli: VA needs to clean up their physical inventory of properties by: discarding some, rehabilitating others, and rebuilding where demand requires it; and this rehabilitative process is what needs to happen today.
.@LouisCelli Over the years, many of the buildings @DeptVetAffairs uses to deliver this care have been left to deteriorate in favor of fiscal savings, leaving veterans with a collection of aged infrastructures.

@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Nope. Both resolutions passed the NEC... It ain't personal. It's science.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Which requires data, facts, &amp; evidence. Again, if you have studies to refute, send it. We can't base policy on feelings, Butch. Facts matter
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Butch, we have young vets joining the Legion because we are advocating for this research.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Come on, Butch! We've done a lot of research here. This has everything to do w/ facts and evidence. If you have evidence, send it.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs You spelled, "dedicated to advancing medical research to improve the lives of veterans" wrong.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Deflection. We said we're for research. We showed studies. We asked for you to send any data you had. Instead, you quit. Ok. See ya.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs Are you saying our members aren't interested in facts? We'd disagree with you there again.
Check it out, y'all. https://t.co/5eGNt9evR1
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs We disagree then. We want more research to have a fact-based discussion about medical and drug policy.
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs No, we are not advocating for recreational use. We ARE advocation for clinical research. There's a big difference.  https://t.co/w8pKWy9qc5
@wimountainman @AmericanLegion @DeptVetAffairs We're interested in data and facts, not feelings here. Many veterans tell us they were able to dump cocktails of meds by access to MMJ.
