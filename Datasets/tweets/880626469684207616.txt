@Bensgonecoastal @SenatorCantwell @PattyMurray While the deck might be stacked against me I believe that I must stand up against corrupt politicians who accept bribes from companies to hurt their own constituents. While I don't have the funds or resources to fully compete against her it's my civic duty.
RT @jasonjgauthier: You used public money to settle harassment claims. You no longer to deserve to sit in the peoples' house. https://t.co/…
@FergusGigi @adigdn @primality @SenSanders If a corp., group, or person donates money that I morally disagree with I would take their money donate it to a good cause. Comast sends me money, Give it to lawyers fighting #NetNeutrality . Klan gives me, send the money to UNCF. That way they have less money to do harm with.
Things 1%er @SenatorCantwell can't understand: having to flip the breaker off to turn off the heat so it does not turn on because you can't afford the heat bill. Having to wear a coat in your house. Keeping your shoes on till bedtime so your feet don't freeze.
@FergusGigi @adigdn @primality @SenSanders But side note the only person that has donated money to my campaign currently is myself. And that is less than $200. My goal is to collect as little as possible so I can remain as free as possible to do what is best for our interest.
@FergusGigi @adigdn @primality @SenSanders Im not seeking out corperation donations. I have an online donation collection for the average person to donate. But I cannot control if a corporation donates through the site. But let me be clear their donation grants them no control over how I vote. I govern for the people

@nate_haley @SenatorCantwell So Maria has to tell Al to go. Her game plan is to placate to only the Democrats she has ignored all the Republicans for the entirety of her career. She cannot risk losing even one vote. But I don't want to be a candidate for one party I want to support and help everyone in Wa
@nate_haley @SenatorCantwell Maria likes to play it so safe that she actually chose to vote against a bill that punished people that hurt pregnant women more because she was afraid it would upset pro-abortionist. She would rather have pro- abortionist be happy then protect a mother and her unborn baby.
@SenatorCantwell Some examples of herself serving. First she blocks cheap meds from Canada while collecting money from the pharmaceutical industry and then complains that the Healthcare System doesn't work. She chose to do what was in the Pharmaceuticals best interests and not the Washingtonian.
@nate_haley @SenatorCantwell she's only saying this because it's an election year. She did not actively ask for the mayor of Seattle to step down for his misconduct. Cantwell plays it safe. It's why I'm running against her. She does what's in her best interest not the constituents.
If I could put something into the tax reform/cut bill it would be to cut serving military personnel's taxes by 50%. While we might not have the money to pay them what the deserve, we could effectively be paying them more by having them pay less taxes. They do enough by serving.
@giufuliafa @SenatorCantwell By promoting politicians &amp; law that end government corruption. There is an amazing nonpartisan group that has written The American Anti-Corruption Act  https://t.co/E2s5vuK3ky While it works to fix the problem at a state level I would live to bring it to the federal level.
@giufuliafa People flagged it because a lot of people think Republicans are all bad. it was flagged because you can't use it to run a campaign. You have to create a page. Which I did. People are very protective of their side and will do whatever they can do to help their side #nohardfeelings
@giufuliafa agreed. I feel if we sat down and chatted you would find I agree with most of your beliefs.  My major differences between @SenatorCantwell and I is I believe most of the governing should be at the state level and money needs to come out of politics
@giufuliafa it was Halloween. Also, I get their concerns &amp; understand their why they feel frustrated. They feel they don't have a voice or the president does not represent them. It is the same feeling many people in WA feeling about @SenatorCantwell
@JawTard Well do. While I might take a verbal bashing I find that when people get to know me they find out that we're not so different and the little differences are far less important.
@giufuliafa @SenatorCantwell It's unfortunate, your mind was made before knowing legislating goals. But I'm aware that people think politics is a sport and they have to only cheer on the team they belong to regardless if their politician is corrupt and taking money from big corps. to further their agenda
@giufuliafa @SenatorCantwell Heaven forbid someone makes a typo on twitter Remember @SenatorCantwell misspelled Medicaid on a giant sign before the Senate.  Thank you for pointing out the typo. It teaches me I must be more careful when crafting my these tweets.  #Covfefe moments
@giufuliafa I would hope that an teacher would be able to separate facts from feelings. Your tool judgement is based on a a stereotype on how you feel all Republicans are. These kinds of statements only further The divided between Americans. We're not political parties were people.
@giufuliafa You're pretty quick to judge.Clearly the common was made as a joke. We have a whole show that's based on teasing Portland it's called Portlandia it's very popular but maybe satires above you. But the likelihood is the mean comment was made because you don't feel I'm on your side.
@giufuliafa I doubt you would find it as funny if this was used to take down a black lives matter, gay rights movement, or an antifa Twitter Facebook or any other social media count.
@giufuliafa While you might find amusement in the fact that I was silenced by false flagging. Remember this kind of behavior can be used to silence anyone's voices. People should be able to express how they feel without being silenced for a different opinion.

@SenatorCantwell This is why I am running against @SenatorCantwell We dont need cuts we need reform. Something she has not got done in her 18 years. We need change and we need it now! Close loop holes &amp; vote out the corrupted. #Rhodes2Change
@Mr_Sneller @SenatorCantwell I think it would need many brackets. I would have to meet with economists to know money many a minium of 6. Plus a lesser tax bracket for military soldiers. For example 15k 5% 30k  10% and so on. But I would need someone to crunch the number once in office.
@Mr_Sneller @SenatorCantwell 1.  Anti corruption legislation. We need term limits, stop gerrymandering, legal brides, on so on. 2. Tax reform/budget reform - I belive we need a bracketed flat tax for people and corporations. 3. Military/Homeland sec. reform - Things like helping vets etc. 4. Education reform
@Mr_Sneller @SenatorCantwell I bring an opened mind &amp; a listening year. To fix DC we have to vote out the bought politicians and vote in normal rational people. I want people to vote for me not a party. My plateform focus on 4 area to help all Americans...
A little twitter wisdom for the day, “When you're arguing with a fool, make sure he isn't doing the same thing.” ―Anonymous
@SenatorCantwell This is why I'm running for Senate. I want to bring solutions not naysaying, pointing fingers, or the blame game. You have had almost 18 years to design legislation. If you had a solution you would have presented it by now. #Rhodes2Reform #Cantwellhastogo
@adigdn For the record, I am not a politician, but a science teacher. I like to gather data and compare options to make the best decision. I am not an expert in the field but if selected to govern I would find the best experts in the field and seek their wisdom. Then craft legislation
@adigdn I'm not opposed to the idea I would need data on the impact on the insurance worker &amp; the process to select the corporation and how to root out corruption during the process. The whole industry needs to be rebuilt. From doctor pay to lobbyin to drug profiteering #Rhodes2stability
@adigdn to answer your question corporations are free to donate. But let me make it very publicly clear. This grants them no favor or power over me. I will do what is best for Washingtonians &amp; American. I would rather be a good man rather a rich one. Its why I am a teacher.

@adigdn @primality @SenSanders @FergusGigi My main focus if elected is to craft legislation to end govrnment corruption.

@adigdn @primality @SenSanders @FergusGigi Thats being said I think we need to start at the state level and build somekind of #Medicare4All system. I believe it would runner smooth and be help wach state design what works best for them. I believe fed. Power should be used sparing. I also know we have to stop corruption..
@adigdn @primality @SenSanders @FergusGigi I believe every needs and should have some kind of reasonably priced healthcare. It bad for people and American to have sick bankrupt people. But currently medical complex has a strangle hold on drug prices and insurance. Even with insurance I can not afford to use it ...
