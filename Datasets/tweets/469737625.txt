@nsudha @mmsecaira @Crosscut Here’s an article from @Poynter that amplifies the point I’m trying to make: https://t.co/mko8WT8vsW
@nsudha @mmsecaira @Crosscut You’re missing my point. The problem is when journalists adopt terms that are used by advocates on one side or another or that are associated with advocacy. Neutral doesn’t have to=white/male dominated. Again thanks for engaging.
@nsudha @mmsecaira @Crosscut So is “social justice.” I don’t think we should have a “social justice” beat either. Bottom line: I’m a huge fan of @Crosscut &amp; public media generally.	My point is simply that the names we give our new beats should reinforce our independence. Thanks for thoughtfully engaging me!
@nsudha @mmsecaira @Crosscut Yes, I know what EJ means and it’s important to look at enviro issues through a race and equity lense. My concern is: reporters are supposed to seek truth. If justice comes about b/c of that, great. But it concerns me when we blur lines by adopting terms used by advocates.

@curtinsea @GovInslee @wastatepatrol @Jim_Brunner @WashingtonSRC For 2017-19 Inslee requested $46,695B in spending. The budget that passed for 2017/2019 is right at about $45B.
@curtinsea @GovInslee @wastatepatrol @Jim_Brunner @WashingtonSRC K-12 is now more than 50% of the state budget. This chart shows where growth in spending has gone in recent years: https://t.co/Vbo5tVAMdw
@curtinsea @GovInslee @wastatepatrol @Jim_Brunner @WashingtonSRC Both chambers write their own budgets. The chambers take turns on who unveils theirs first--they switch off year to year.
@curtinsea @GovInslee @wastatepatrol @Jim_Brunner Senate Rs did an analysis that shows it would be 75% since 2011 (before he took office). 62 percent since the 2013-15 budget. For context: @WashingtonSRC controlled the Senate for much of that time, #waleg writes the budget and McCleary drove much of new spending.

Response from ranking Republican on Senate budget Cmte to ⁦@GovInslee⁩ budget proposal. #waleg https://t.co/bwCVRQW0tQ
@sydbrownstone Inslee sounds bullish about the chances this year in light of bigger Democratic majorities in the #waleg saying Dems want a "middle out" not "trickle down" tax system. He calls cap gains an excise tax. Opponents call it an income tax and no doubt will sue if it is enacted.
Inslee tax package: New 9% capital gains tax targeted at high income households. Increase in B&amp;O tax rate on service businesses. Make real estate excise tax graduated, not flat, to pay for court-ordered fish barrier removal. FYI: if cap gains tax passes, legal challenge expected
Budget context. Current budget $44.6B. @GovInslee proposed budget: $54.6B. 21 percent increase in spending. Big items: $4.1B in K-12 McCleary-related "bow wave." $2.4B state employee pay raises + demand on state services. $900M to move K12 employees into state healthcare system.

@adigdn What is not accurate about that? Be specific, provide evidence. Thanks.

Under @govinslee proposal 50% of carbon tax would "support the transition to a clean energy economy," 35% for flood management and storm water infrastructure, 15% for vulnerable communities. Utilities could get 100% tax credit for "reinvestment" in carbon cutting technology
During his State of the State today, @GovInslee will propose $20/ton tax on carbon emissions from transportation fuels and power plants starting July 2019. Tax would increase 3.5% + inflation annually. Would generate estimated $1.5B in first two years.

Sup. Ct. of Washington is adjourned.
State Atty wants justices to end case, but if it retains jurisdiction just to ensure #waleg follows thru in 2019 with full funding #mccleary
State atty admits full funding is not in place by Court's 2018 deadline, but says everything in place to be enacted in 2019 budget#mccelary
State attorney Copsey says #waleg putting $8.3B into schools over next 4 years. @waOSPI Reykdal says it's more in the $5B range #mccleary
State gets 9 minutes for rebuttal...
Ahearne concludes by saying #waleg has "alligator mouth" when it comes to school funding. #mccleary
Interesting: I don't think I've heard mention by plaintiffs that @SeattleSchools @tacomaschools say they lose $$ under #waleg #mccleary fix
After nearly 50 minutes, takeaway is justices are tired of #McCleary, frustrated w/both sides and struggling w/what to do next w/this case
RT @OlympiaJoe: Stephens talking about balance of power between judiciary and legislative branches. Asking Ahearn'e philosophy. #waleg
Plaintiffs' lawyer says he wants order from court saying the #mccleary funding plan is "not compliant" &amp; order full funding in 2018 session

Justice Yu wants to know how property tax swap is "regular and dependable" source of funding to schools. #mccleary
State lawyer says there's extra "safety net" funding for districts like Castle Rock. (BTW special ed cap is 13.5% to be exact) #mccleary
Now Justice Gonzalez asking about 13% cap on special ed funding. Says Castle Rock has 16% special ed. How will they get fully funded?
Justices focused on teacher salaries in questions to state lawyer. The last big piece of #mccleary was state picking up salary tab.
Background on the property tax plan #waleg agreed on this year to fund schools. Question is does it satisfy Sup Ct: https://t.co/5BRa4kggm5
State lawyer says there's enough revenue to provide "all the funding that's necessary" to fully fund schools in #mcceary plan.
SCOWA justices off to testy start with state lawyer in #mccleary school funding hearing. Question is did #waleg fully fund schools by 2018

Bryant closing: if elected says he will focus on education, rural unemployment, prisons, mental health... #waelex
Fast hour. Closing statements from candidates now. #waelex
Inslee opposes I-732 carbon tax on ballot. Touts new carbon cap rule from Ecology. Says good reason not to trust Bryant on enviro #waelex

Debate questions and answers now addressing how to recruit more young women into #STEM, and wage gap for women ... #waelex
Inslee pivots back to taxes. Says training police will require new dollars. Says Bryant wants to "starve" other programs to fund ed #waelex
Inslee invokes #mlk and says "We are a long ways from the mountaintop." says funding for police training not sufficient #waelex
Bryant says police need to be trained to be "culturally sensitive." Says Gov can set tone against "racism and bigotry" #waelex
First audience question is about tensions between police and communities of color #waelex
Inslee says image that sticks with him is photo of (grandson?) 2yr old Chase Inslee "rapturous" over blackberry milkshake. #waelex
Question for candidates: what image on social media has moved you during campaign? Bryant says school children not campaign seflies #waelex
Bryant on "safe place" proposal "I'm very reluctant to enable a felony on municipal property" but says "I'll keep looking at it." #waelex
On Seattle/King Co "safe place" proposal for heroin users Inslee says he needs to study it. #waelex
Probably first time in WA debate history that county recording fees for homelessness has come up. #waelex #signoftimes
Inslee says 2700 more low income units since 2013. WA leading country in rapid rehousing. Blames rising rents for homelessness #waelex

On income tax Inslee says "I am against" Bryant challenges Inslee to pledge to "veto" any new tax on income. Moderators intervene #waelex

Bryant calls for spending 50% to 51% of state budget on education #waelex says Inslee doesn't have a plan to fully fund schools.
Now moving onto education as topic in WA gov debate #waelex. Question is lay out plan for solving #mccleary
Bryant says "I support the 2nd Amendment, I own a gun" that's why I don't have a problem with background checks or waiting period #waelex
Gun violence is first issue in #waelex governor's debate. Inslee calls for "commonsense" safety measures and voices support for I-1491
Inslee says he's a "confident and optimistic" governor for a "confident and optimistic" state. #waelex
Bryant comes out swinging accusing Inslee of "incompetence and broken promises" #waelex

Justices now asking state atty about deadline for full funding. State argues it's Sept 2018. Plaintiffs says 2017. https://t.co/gSJWhK7acs
Lawyer: "The state has succeeded in running out the clock" on #mccleary plaintiffs' children who are now out/almost out of public schools.
After 1hr in WA Sup Ct justices sound skeptical of both sides in #McCleary school $$ case. No decision on contempt/sanctions expected today
Plaintiffs' atty says levy swap "doesn't solve problem." Idea is lower local levies and raise state prop tax levy https://t.co/ZkvxSniqz8
Arguments in WA Sup Court boil down to: state is one (admittedly big) step away from full funding. Or state has been "staring at a switch"

Justice Owens suggests #waleg could just undo sanctions imposed by court like closing schools or nixing tax breaks https://t.co/X4SFRXRG3v
Sanction option 2 say plaintiffs is suspend all 600+ state tax exemptions. #McCleary
Plaintiffs offer 2 possible new sanctions: declare all school statutes unconstitutional. Critics say that would effectively shutter schools.
Plaintiffs' attorney says $100k/day sanction has not been effective but other sanctions would "coerce" #waleg to act #McCleary

Fascinating case of Dems splitting the vote allowing 2 R candidates to snag top two slots in state treasurer race https://t.co/eZVmGxjKf7
Looks like Sec of State Kim Wyman has tough race on her hands. D challenger Tina Podlodowski posting 46% of the vote to Wyman's 48%. #waelex
In WA Gov's race, incumbent D Jay Inslee has 49% to R challenger Bill Bryant's 38%. #waelex
In WA Sup Ct race, Chief Justice Madsen has 64% of vote to Kittitas Co Prosecutor Greg Zempel's 29% despite PAC ads for Zempel pre-primary
If primary results are harbinger, seeing super tight races in 2016 #waleg battleground districts like Vancouver's 17th &amp; E King 5th. #waelex
All 39 counties have reported results now. According to Sec of State this count is likely about 50 to 60% of eventual total #waelex
In open (and crowded) non-partisan OSPI race Erin Jones and Chris Reykdal are top two candidates at this hour. #waelex
In open Lands Commish race Republican Steve McLaughlin and Democrat Hilary Franz hold top-two slots at this hour. #waelex
GOP State Senator Mark Miloscia and Pierce Co Exec Pat McCarthy, a Dem, hold top two slots at this hour in open State Auditor race #waelex
Two Republicans, Duane Davidson and Michael Waite, have top-two slots at this hour in open State Treasurer race. #waelex
Early results give R Marty McClendon and D Cyrus Habib top two slots in open Lt. Gov race. #waelex
King and Snohomish have now reported primary results putting @GovInslee at just under 50% of the vote. Time now to look down ballot. #waelex
Turnout for recent past primary elections has been around 40%. Late-arriving ballots could boost turnout now at 24% return rate. #waelex
This year 5 of 9 statewide positions are open--meaning incumbent not running. Lt. Gov race drew 11 candidates. 9 for OSPI. Crowded ballot!
Despite many open seats, turnout has been lackluster for this August primary. Just eclipsed 20% today according to Sec. of State's office.
Several smaller, more rural counties have reported primary results giving GOP candidates early leads. Waiting on biggies King, Sno, Pierce
So far just one county, Lewis County, reporting returns in the #wagov race. Republican Bill Bryant has 60% there. https://t.co/14MFNQfciF

Judge Leighton sets "placeholder" retrial date of November 14 for State Auditor Troy Kelley. Defense wants March date after he leaves office
Kelley defense says if motion on double jeopardy is denied, will appeal to 9th circuit and that could cause 12-18 month delay.
Defense says Kelley's financial resources have been "significantly depleted', also says he will waive speedy trial.
Defense has pending motions to acquit, dismiss outstanding charges. Judge Leighton has not ruled on those yet, but will.
Fed prosecutors ask judge to set new trial date for Wa St Auditor Troy Kelley to re-try on deadlocked counts. Defense "very disappointed"

Gov staff say most inmates who were released early won't be locked up again if they stayed out of trouble because they earn credit while out
Most early releases were 100 days or less but there was at least one who was released 600 days early says @GovInslee attorney Nick Brown
"Were there any crimes committed" by offenders who were released early is key question says @GovInslee
Washington's prisons chief calls it "unforgivable error" and says he apologies. Effort underway to round up inmates who were released early
Gov Inslee bringing in former federal prosecutors to investigate what went wrong, how this happened. IT fix expected by Jan 7, 2016
.@GovInslee says he's ordered DOC to halt all releases from prison until hand calculation done on each inmate believed eligible for release
To be clear, family alerted DOC to problem in 2012, but coding fix to computer system was not made. @GovInslee calls it "maddening"
Coding error only affects offenders with enhanced sentences - approximately 3200 offenders. Only small fraction will be returned to prison.
After victim family did it's own calculation on early release, DOC did hand calculation and, as a result, offender wasn't released. #wagov
"This error was undetected by anyone for 10 years," says @GovInslee counsel Nick Brown. Victim family brought this to attention of DOC.
Since 2002 DOC has been incorrectly calculating good time credit. Result: 3% released inmates were released earlier than allowed by law.

BREAKING: Washington Prosecutors Want Death Penalty Vote In 2016: https://t.co/1UqUhG6l63 #waleg #wagov
LAST TWEET: Eyman's lawyer told me last week he's confident I-1366 can withstand post-#waelex legal challenges going forward. #waleg
OPPONENTS CHALLENGE: they say I-1366 violates single-subject rule and violates process for amending Wash. constitution. #waleg #waelex
REMINDER: I-1366 cuts Wash. sales tax next April unless #waleg sends 2/3rds for tax hikes constitutional amendment to voters #waelex
WHAT'S NEXT? Opponents will ask King Co judge for injunction to prevent 1366 from taking effect while post-#waelex legal challenges mounted
CONTEXT: Wash Sup Court ruling today explains why it upheld lower court allowing I-1366 to appear on Nov ballot #waleg #waelex
BREAKING: Wash Sup Ct reserves judgment on constitutionality of Eyman's I-1366, but opponents have standing to challenge #waleg #waelex
Now with link to story: Wash I-1366 ahead, Eyman declares early victory: https://t.co/915xCmhmHh #waelex
While Eyman's 1366 leads and he declares victory, opponents  will likely challenge constitutionality in court #waelex
On the #waleg front, Republicans appear to have picked up a key seat in the 30th LD with Teri Hickel leading Carol Gregory. #waelex
Now with King County reporting I-1366 advantage drops to 54% with more than 800k ballots counted so far statewide #waelex
So far I-1366 leading by solid margins in all but 3 counties that have reported including Pierce. Still waiting on mega-county King #waelex
As more counties report in, I-1366 maintains its nearly 60% lead but King, Pierce have yet to weigh in #waelex
Add San Juan county to the counties reporting at this early house. #waelex #election2015
Those early I-1366 numbers are from just 3 counties: Cowlitz, Franklin, Garfield #election2015 https://t.co/T7yhpW8xIm
In early returns Eyman's I-1366 tax limiting measure has strong 60% to 40% lead. #ElectionDay #election2015
