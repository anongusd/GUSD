@hubbardhawkeye @GOP @marc_lotter Good for you. Such a waste of time and money, right? I mean, imagine all the opportunities you'd have without your scam education... 		Also, see Roe versus Wade for more details. I'm pro choice. 		How do you feel about babies being stripped form their families and put into cages?
@hubbardhawkeye @GOP @marc_lotter Did you go to college? Maybe you wouldn't call it a scam if it didn't cost so much. 		Healthcare is a right in the most wealthy country in the world. If other countries can do it then so can we. 	Keep voting against your own interests and giving more and more to those w the most!

@jonkarl @costareports @realDonaldTrump Nail him to the wall on this.
Who would invade the US using unarmed mothers and children anyway? He has no chance at success over this. It's a DISTRACTION.		He wants us talking about anything but RUSSIA. That's the real threat to himself, his family, and HIS WEALTH, which is most important to him above all.
So good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Only a total racist or one who panders to racists would argue that mothers and children fleeing violence rise to the level of the threats described above.
A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if "actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay." (N/A)
Felony¬†charges may be brought without presentment or¬†grand jury¬†indictment¬†in cases arising "in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger." (N/A)
Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of¬†habeas corpus "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it." (N/A)
This is N/A. Calling unarmed mothers and children fleeing violence "invaders" doesn't mean we are being invaded. Last I checked, these people aren't stirring up an insurrection either. They're in detention centers, fearing for their lives, praying they don't lose their kids.
The last national state of emergency was declared because of 9/11.		Here's what the Constitution says on when you can declare a state of emergency:		Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
All the people who went to his rallies to participate in the call and response  over the wall are like, 		"huh. I didn't see this coming."		Because they are stupid racists. https://t.co/VTGXHHNjcT
