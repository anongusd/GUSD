The ABLE Financial Planning Act allows ABLE beneficiaries to roll over regular 529 accounts to 529A (ABLE) accounts up to the annual maximum contribution. 🏦 We were proud to be at the forefront of passing these two critical pieces of legislation. 📜
Since its passing in 2014, we were able to pass two improvement bills to help those with disabilities work without the risk of losing their benefits! ABLE to Work will let people with disabilities save an additional $12,060 in an ABLE account. 💵💰
The #ABLEAct was supported by 381 out of 435 US Representatives and 78 out of 100 US Senators – 85% of the entire US Congress! This law has been heralded as one of the most significant pieces of disability legislation since the Americans with Disabilities Act. https://t.co/kLDJXWBTnx
Your personal stories, your voices and your advocacy matters- the passing of the #ABLEAct is a great example! Join @NDSS in advocating so we can ensure that Americans with disabilities, from sea to shining sea, can achieve a better life. 💙💛 🏛️ https://t.co/lzU9zXIbm3
