But stock prices don't tell a country's full economic story. Medical bankruptcies and foreclosures and stagnant paychecks do, too. Student loans. The cost of daycare and doctors. Wages that won't budge. Jobs displaced. Retirements on edge.
Donald Trump bragged during his State of the Union address that our country is "considered far and away the hottest economy in the world." From one standpoint, he's right. Those who have done very well already are doing better &amp; better every single day.

Sign my petition to tell Donald Trump to support all of our troops and lift his ban on transgender servicemembers.		https://t.co/qjlfuBzreS
This week, the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump‚Äôs ban on transgender troops to proceed. As if gender identity has anything to do with love of country. As if he has any right to comment on another American‚Äôs courage.
President Trump inflicted real pain on thousands of American families over a campaign promise he couldn't keep. 35 days of missed paychecks, disrupted federal services, &amp; national security threats. All because he couldn't get his way. This shutdown never should have happened.
In case you haven't heard, @SecretaryRoss, 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. https://t.co/r5paWnuzAQ
We must demand insurers treat behavioral health equal to physical health. Protect Medicaid, the largest single-payer of mental health treatment. Give the opioid epidemic the level of investment it requires. And make sure no one ends up in prison for the "crime" of mental illness.
We‚Äôve got to do better. As our newly Democratic House dives into the larger health care debate, I'll be fighting to ensure mental health stays at the forefront.
As we fight against GOP efforts to dismantle the ACA &amp; push for universal care, one thing is critical: We must keep mental health care at the center of that conversation. For too long we've cast it to the margins, treating it as an afterthought rather than a life or death reality
If you'd like to contribute to the movement for justice at our southern border, chip in here: https://t.co/fJ1YFXMg1A
Couldn‚Äôt be more proud to share that, thanks to your generosity, we've raised a quarter of a million dollars to support the incredible work of groups aiding asylum seekers, like the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services &amp; the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project
Since Trump announced his zero-tolerance policy at the border, our movement has stepped up again and again to show that millions of Americans reject the scapegoating and dehumanizing of immigrant families searching for a better life.
Thanks to @ColinAllredTX, the House passed a bipartisan resolution to protect the Affordable Care Act and defend coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Proud to see one of our #HealthCareHeroes already making a difference in Congress. https://t.co/42h57yILFp
The President is taking his anti-immigrant crusade to new heights while American families‚Äô livelihoods are on the line. Yes, we‚Äôre facing humanitarian horror at our border. But it was manufactured by @realDonaldTrump and his White House.
Nearly a million American workers forced to go without paychecks this week because their president is playing some political game.  Funding for everything from domestic violence shelters to air control to health inspections in jeopardy‚Äî that‚Äôs an emergency.
Families legally seeking asylum at our border don‚Äôt constitute an ‚Äúemergency.‚Äù But kids in tent cities, family separation, tear gas, hieleras,  &amp; vicious ICE tactics ‚Äî that‚Äôs an emergency.
We‚Äôre so grateful for all of your friendship, advice and support in 2018. Hope you and your families had a peaceful, happy new year. Ready to tackle 2019 together! https://t.co/5p78XUtiOu

Let's tell America a different story. About an ever-scrappy, ever-striving nation that had the audacity to declare all men are created equal. The country that conquered the moon. The country that lights the globe. That keeps its promises. That isn't just great but good.
Democrats, we speak for the voiceless and the victimized. We speak for the frustrated and the forgotten. We speak for the scrappy and the struggling and the striving. We speak for the tens of millions of Americans fighting their own quiet battles every single day.
The real divide is the one the GOP has been building for years. One that Donald Trump has carried to new heights while distracting us with his tweets and his tantrums:  the powerful and privileged on one side‚Ä¶and everyone else on the other.
Donald Trump has masterfully manipulated this debate, convincing the nation that battle lines run deep between us. Black vs. white. Coast vs. heartland. The poor vs. the middle class. Shame on us if we fall for it.

We must take back the House in 2018.  But we shouldn‚Äôt stop there.  Let's win back key state legislatures to level the playing field for the decade to come.  Join me and @Forward Majority as we fight to restore the American promise that everyone is equal + every vote counts (4/4)
Gerrymandering has yielded Republicans an estimated 18 additional seats in the U.S. House -- so to take back Congress this fall, Democrats have to win by at least 57 percent of the vote, not a simple majority (3/4)
GOP control of more than two-thirds of state legislatures has allowed Republicans to embark on an unprecedented effort to gerrymander Congress, suppress voters, and legislate themselves into power --&gt; #PA is exhibit A 2/4
As we fight for the values we hold dear in Congress, we must not lose sight of one of the root drivers of Republican power: control of state legislatures 1/4

"So here is the answer Democrats offer tonight: we choose both. We fight for both. Because the greatest, strongest, richest, nation in the world should not have to leave any one behind."
"The American promise is being broken. By an Administration that callously appraises our worthiness and decides who makes the cut and who can be bargained away. They are turning American life into a zero-sum game. Where for one to win, another must lose."
"It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it‚Äôs far, far bigger than that. This administration isn‚Äôt just targeting the laws that protect us ‚Äì they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection."
