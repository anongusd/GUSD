@AOC Evidence of your statement please.
@phantasmaglo @nytimes The trouble is, when you make a level of education free for all and a ‚Äúneed‚Äù for society you then force that on all as a minimum standard. And, since nothing is free it really hurts the overall economy more than having education be a choice under a free market.
@phantasmaglo @nytimes I‚Äôd have to study up on your system, structure, and history. Frankly, I‚Äôve learned very little about Australia.
@phantasmaglo @nytimes My concern is the number of politicians and citizens who think it should be mandated, i.e., ‚Äúfree‚Äù education, which would totally destroy the market and create a new bottom with many more in debt. It‚Äôs bad enough as it is already. We need to remove ‚Äúfree‚Äù money and controls.

@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 I can‚Äôt see the explotations from anyone besides the looters, aka the government. In a natural market workers are in demand. The employer has only as much leverage as the market allows; this is the same for the worker, s/he has the leverage that the market allows.

@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Wealth comes from creating value. It only gets out of hand bc or cronyism. Illegalities May occur as well, but with less intervention abuses become much clearer to prosecute.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 And again, I‚Äôm fine with your beliefs and you have the right to elect state leaders to enact these socialist ideals. However, to force it upon the entire Union is not liberty and requires both slavery and theft. Think it through because it‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs my final thought.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 That‚Äôs theft. I see no reason anyone would have a right to the wealth you create. You may forgetting why we have such amazing technology and innovation. You do know the top 1% of the world simply makes over about $31k/year? We all benefit greatly from that which you speak against
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre mixing up a bunch of things here. Again, no one has a right to the value you create. You decide what happens to it.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 I didn‚Äôt say impossible but it is the cronyism which enables the subsidies, price fixing, and various other regulations which do stifle competition, and these are all government tools, not private sector.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 That is not at all what my research has shown me, and I‚Äôve studied a number of countries from multiple perspectives. Those countries do provide frameworks states could follow though.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 They are the constituents... the only reason there is cronyism is bc government is protection by force, and every single company and sector wants its protections. We cannot solve this with more government.

@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Time to go read my friend. Good chat. I‚Äôll circle back to Twitter later today. I seriously encourage you to read Rob Paul‚Äôs: Liberty Defined. He goes over 50 very very hot topics. Fantastic read. Yaron Brook is a brilliant writer if you want some recent libertarian economics.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Example: notice how electronic prices keep going down, quality keeps going up, and thus access increases? That‚Äôs a very unregulated market. Now look at healthcare. More regulations than any other market, more rules and barriers to entry, less access bc of way higher costs.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 That‚Äôs not hoarding though. As long as the money is in the system it‚Äôs helping the economy. I understand your concern but my point is: the government is making the rich richer by ensuring competition is essentially impossible. Look at unregulated markets and see what happens...
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 And I‚Äôm sure you hate cronyism right? Don‚Äôt you see it‚Äôs only there bc of the government? If the federal government didn‚Äôt have all this power to subsidize and price fix what would the lobbyists have to influence? The federal agencies are the fundamental problem.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Under their own constitutions. The federal government‚Äôs job is to protect our rights from the states infringing (think back to Eisenhower in Alabama). They are to ensure free movement and trade within the union. But since even before FDR we‚Äôve been giving away all of our Rights.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Taxes are ok but only for what‚Äôs constitutionally mandated: border security, military (not to be an aggressor as we definitely are), patent services, and maybe some small agencies, but generally this country was designed to have these free states that could operate...
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 If you work hard for your family‚Äôs future no one should have the right to infringe on that. It‚Äôs that simple.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 The form of libertarianism that I ascribe to is best explained by Ron Paul. Basically we should all have our liberty. I believe in states‚Äô rights. I‚Äôd like to see the federal government do what they were designed to do under the Constitution. I‚Äôm fine with state run healthcare.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 These are all ideas that would crush the poor and middle class. No social planning has ever worked. The most basic economic principles yield the greatest results. The government is a mafia middleman.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 In some ways yes but more Relativism as Ayn Rand calls it.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm not disagreeing that major corporations are able to use massive tax write offs on some years, as amazon did in 2017, but it‚Äôs micro to say they pay no taxes. The EEs pay a ton of taxes. Corporate taxes hurt the bottom/middle bc of where they get passed.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 100% disagree. The federal government is doing way too much. I see no need for more taxes. We need to remove agencies.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Good book but fictional.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Very clear to me bc you use the word inequality in only one fashion. You say ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù like it‚Äôs a real phrase. You‚Äôre brainwashed by the mainstream right now. You seem very bright. In time you will find more insight. Suggest you read some Thomas Sowell to start. üôè
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm 100% sure you‚Äôve never read a single book on economics or any libertarian principles.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 I never said ‚Äúfake‚Äù. Snopes has been inaccurate at times. Generally they are good. However, they are not a legit reference either my man. Do you know APA or MLA or any type of fomatting which requires references? References must be peer reviewed. Snopes is not.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 All I can suggest is that you spend some time objectively looking at the these questions. At one time I only looked to progressive answers. Now I can clear see there is nothing more sound than libertarianism. Good luck to you.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 FYI if they pay their workers more arbitrarily, good will cost more, people will lose jobs, it will hurt the entire economy, and people who need jobs at a lower wage will be priced out.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 I‚Äôm sure you feel that way.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Prove that out. I guarantee you won‚Äôt find them choosing anything, instead they are following all federal laws. BTW, what does living wage mean exactly? Where does the government have a right to ensure you have any amount of a wage? Reference please.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 It absolutely is not. No university would accept it. No research paper would use it. You need to share the source content, in full.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 And they employee the most people in America. They‚Äôd be a lot less wealthier if the government wasn‚Äôt ensuring Walmart had very little competition.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 You do realize all income taxes come from payroll, and you do realize Walmart has the most EEs for a retail store, and thus they contribute soo much to the economy. Now I agree 1000% subsidies should all be gone, but that‚Äôs a small government solution my friend.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Bro, that is not a legit reference. You need to actually pull data from peer reviewed sources. You‚Äôre looking at microeconomics. Of course they pay taxes, but they also are able to use tremendous deductions.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Of course low income workers are on food stamps. That is not what you said though. Look at Amazon‚Äôs income statement from last year. To say they pay no tax is not accurate at all.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 Ahh ok. Enjoy your socialist system. Your leader is soon to be ousted. Conservatives will take over Canada in time.
@LivingWageHI @Ocasio2018 Oh it‚Äôs definitely a Left v Right thing.
Donald
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Beyond untrue.
@marycatheriinee You certainly sound like one.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I can only hope that one day you will review what you‚Äôre saying.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 All financial aid is done the same, as it‚Äôs a federal program; look it up. At undergrad, grants and sub loans are based on EFC. At grad level it‚Äôs all unsub and everyone can get $20,500/year up to lifetime maximum of $138,500.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre super confused. Please research this BS you speak.
@marycatheriinee Wow, and you assume my gender. I thought that was against the rules.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 The bottom 50% pay essentially no direct federal income taxes. You‚Äôre confused on where the money comes from.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 And this is where you show you don‚Äôt really understand economics. Corporate taxes do not harm the rich. Consider if a corporation had to pay more taxes, who would they charge? Consumers or workers or in a case where the majority shareholders are not the owners, shareholders too.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 What do you mean funding by the government? You do understand that‚Äôs people and businesses paying taxes, right?
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 About $20k/year up to $138,500 lifetime, and again: you can‚Äôt qualify for grants and sub loans at undergrad unless you don‚Äôt have high income.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 How do you figure they would still not pay bc of taxes and then how does it not create a new minimum standard? Let‚Äôs get the federal government completely out of the way and drive down prices. Then we can let states do as they like, based on their Republic forms of government.
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 So it‚Äôs not free...
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 But you only get financial aid if your parents don‚Äôt make enough money...
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 When you say free, could you please explain what that means?
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 Who funds the government? Please please study up on some civics and economics. I‚Äôm confident you don‚Äôt understand how ‚Äúthose‚Äù countries operate.
@marycatheriinee @Ocasio2018 Currently universities either base it on merit (conservative states) or race equality (liberal states). Can you explain how everyone could have education without paying for it and how if everyone had a bachelors‚Äô that wouldn‚Äôt create a new base standard?
@HaveEdgeTimes @Ocasio2018 First, nothing is free. Second, it everyone had a bachelors‚Äô it would then be the base standard which would hurt the poorest the most and the middle class more than the wealthy.
@TheWalkingDeaf @Ocasio2018 Why would we be spending less ‚Äúin theory‚Äù? The artificial supply of federal aid has created a rushed demand with low quality. In the end, it hurts the poorest the most and the middle class more than the wealthy.

@sgourley2b @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 You think we need government to steal from us to help others? Please explain which government program takes from the rich and gives to the poor. By my count all but one program takes from the poor and gives up. There would be way more charity if government didn‚Äôt get in the way.
@sgourley2b @bsand100 @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 What do you know of the Lafer curve? I really suggest you study some economics on this. Tax increases don‚Äôt always mean more revenue. All depends on world rates. Anyway, corporate taxes should be 0! BC again.. corporate taxes are a tax on either consumer, employee, or shareholder
@sgourley2b @bsand100 @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre so confused. You‚Äôre talking corporate tax cuts. Personals are only not permanent bc of the Dems. Reps recently voted the bill to extend and all Dems voted no. Please explain why that was? What do you mean tax cuts for the rich? Explain what you mean by that.
@sgourley2b @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 You only gained progress bc of capitalism. Early 1900s federal government only consumed about 3% of gross revenues. It was the most prosperous time in history and only ended bc of the awful government idea: the Federal Reserve. The looters just keeping taking from all side.
@sgourley2b @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre so confused my friend. Look at France. Look at Venezuela. Look at Cuba. Look at every socialist society throughout history. They all run out of run. All the governments turn to tyranny. Liberty, the Republic, true free markets - that will save America.

@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 The answer is literally, zero people. Again, prove out what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll never show any factual basis.  Hopefully you will see how offbase you are. Maybe not today but I have hope for all liberals (not really liberals since that actually means liberty).
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 You need to get off Twitter and study. Seriously man. Nazis were socialist nationalists. They were total government control. Took all the guns. Took over all businesses.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Give me some proof. You‚Äôre making radical opinions with no factual basis. His son and law and grand kids are Jewish. He‚Äôs from NY. You clearly don‚Äôt know what a Nazi is.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Prove what you‚Äôre saying with data bc you‚Äôre spewing opinion with no factual basis. Richard Spencer was a collectivist. Watch his interview with @DineshDSouza. It‚Äôs right there on YouTube. Who cares what a few extremists like. Look at progressive extremists. You can‚Äôt blame O.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 I agree Trump fear mongers. It‚Äôs what all politicians do. Republicans use military. Democrats use social programs. Doesn‚Äôt mean our border doesn‚Äôt need to be secured. Dems have known this for many years but now have amnesia.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre actually the one being racist ^^^
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Racist agenda? Please do explain.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 You‚Äôre missing other parts where he spoke about the great people he loved from Mexico.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Exactly. So not what you said. You‚Äôve got to sift through the noise.
@bsand100 @sgourley2b @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 Exactly.
@sgourley2b @rweingarten @Ocasio2018 Please do explain. Let me ask: when a corporation pays tax, who pays? Consumers, workers or shareholders... can you name anyone else? Also, how much taxes of a percentage of all the taxes do the top 10% pay? Final question: what government program doesn‚Äôt steal from the poor?
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 None? Again, that‚Äôs not factual. I agree that most congresspersons actually agree with Trump, as he‚Äôs just parroting the same thing Dems did for 20+ years.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 He actually tried to jail minors, and the reason they had to catch and release is bc the 9th Circuit shut down his executive order. You don‚Äôt seem to have a full rounded understanding of what has occurred. 		Trump has not changed asylum bc as you state: he can‚Äôt.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Go back and listen to the rally. He never said ‚Äúall‚Äù. If you can‚Äôt be truthful with content it‚Äôs not really worth a debate.
@rweingarten @Ocasio2018 Just a reminder: she‚Äôs not using her money. She‚Äôs using our taxpayer dollars.

@HelenKennedy @realDonaldTrump Yes please tell us how he ‚Äúplayed‚Äù anyone?
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Dems only changed their tune on immigration bc of Trump. I‚Äôm sure you can see that. We all need to protect America. There is no such thing as a country without borders; we‚Äôve seen what happened to Europe. Dems need to make a deal. Trump is def. ready.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Tariffs btw are something we mostly all disagree with, but why they‚Äôre being used is not a terrible idea. China has not been free with their trade, and finally we have a POTUS pushing them. Tax cuts are supported by anyone who understands economics.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 Slavery ended by Republicans, Jim Crow laws, put in place by Dems. Equal rights for minorities and women were put in place bc of Republicans. We need to end the war machine. We need to end the welfare machine. We need to return to liberty. We are responsible for ourselves.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 The government is in control of way too much. Planning does not work. It only takes a study of history and economics to understand this, but Americans refuse to learn outside of schools, especially elites. Republicans have been the good guys since the country was formed.
@Migard32 @Ocasio2018 We should not be so concerned w majorities. Majorities are dangerous. Democracies are dangerous. The Republic is incredible,  it sadly we‚Äôve stopped following the Constitution. The issues you mention are heavily political, but the bigger key is: we‚Äôre losing our liberties.
@BluCowDawg @Ocasio2018 @RepWilson That‚Äôs not why she won. She beat out a man that didn‚Äôt ever come back to his district. Plus, liberal NYers really don‚Äôt understand how terrible Democrat policy is for economics.
@ezraklein So tax the people so everyone can get a day off. Automatically register everyone so that people can manipulate the system and record those votes? Smart.

9 - Unless you want to use a different word, it seems more obvious than not that God does exist.		Thanks, @joerogan #EdwardFeser. Great book: Five Proofs of the Existence of God.
8 - Why are they not living out some other actualization? Even if there is a probability and that is why; then why is there a probability?		The questions won‚Äôt end until you answer: what is the first cause?
7 - Forget the existence of the universe for a moment. For any object to be existing, what is causing it to be actual? At the most fundamental level, why are the chemicals, or molecules, or even subatomic particles getting the actualization for their cause?
6 - Almost everyone knows that light acts as both a particle and a wave, and time itself is ‚Äúbent‚Äù... do either of these concepts make sense? Not without serious pondering of the complex ideas themselves, but you know they are true nonetheless.
5 - Ponder this: do you know what a unicorn is? You certainly know the essence? But existence cannot happen unless essence comes together with existence (confusing of course)...
4 - Of course, these ideas are beyond complex, and again you simply cannot ever understand God. It‚Äôs not possible because of the universal rule we live under: essence and existence within our universe are separate things.
3 - God is essence and existence in one, and thus you cannot comprehend such an idea because to know the same essence and existence is to be that same essence and existence.
2 - However, no philosopher making an argument for God ever made this assumption or argument. They all believed that ‚Äúeverything that has potential has a cause‚Äù.
1 - I don‚Äôt know why or where, but at some time I was given the thought that ‚Äúeverything that exists has a cause‚Äù, and this idea alone allowed me to question (dismiss) the existence of God.

@somethingbrite @svik232 @CindyinSDakota @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm aware. I was stationed in the Navy on 9/11 #NeverForget. I‚Äôm against all radicals of all religions.
@somethingbrite @svik232 @CindyinSDakota @realDonaldTrump I didn‚Äôt say that. There are many issues in the Middle East - https://t.co/a4CUVd4IRw
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Dude tons and tons of companies have come forward. Many are just small so you‚Äôre not seeing them on the MSM.  Look for local news stories. Trickle down is a term used by the Left. Please review supply side economics. Also, this bill even provides some demand side economics.
@Justacidic @eye_wuv_errbody @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Notice ‚Äúpublic‚Äù employees. The NFL is a private business. #FactsMatter.
@somethingbrite @svik232 @CindyinSDakota @realDonaldTrump They‚Äôre the world‚Äôs largest sponsor of terror. Their people are amazing. Their government hates Jews and is totally corrupt.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC That‚Äôs not true at all. Go back and look at history. They‚Äôve always been attacked for being partisan. Even with that said the tax foundation shows all but 5% of people‚Äôs taxes come down and CBO is not allowed to use dynamic scoring: https://t.co/nvpWoksQiT
@Justacidic @eye_wuv_errbody @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Your opinion which is your right. I prefer honesty from our POTUS. Obama‚Äôs fake PC BS destroyed America.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Referring what for next year? The corporate cuts are permanent and all others last for 10 years.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC The increased child tax credit and doubled standard deduction basically allow everyone(vast majority) to file on a simple form and save $ on taxes. Meanwhile they‚Äôll find more jobs and more buying power throughout the economy. Wow I‚Äôm excited. Time to head out. Good luck to you!
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Plus the 20% pass thru deduction for small and medium business + immediate expensing - economy is going to roar!!! Which absolutely helps all people - small and medium business run this country. #MAGA
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC That‚Äôs totally fake news. All the brackets came down and the ONLY lost deduction was SALT on homes over $500k. https://t.co/nAGmxRwlBh
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Neither is non partisan. Yes the personals will expire in 10 years if we don‚Äôt get Dem votes for a 60 vote bill. So either help us vote for Rep in or call your senators.
@Justacidic @eye_wuv_errbody @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @ABC Trickle down is a fake phrase. Supply side economics are solid economics. If you don‚Äôt believe in the dynamics of the Laffer Curve I could undetabd your concern but taxing does not equal revenue (not an exact correlation) - think about it: if you tax 100% do you maximize revenue?
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @CNN The bill went through 5 committees, the house and senate 2x each. You are correct that he Amendments we‚Äôre finalized in the final committee where they House and Senate worked out the final bill and it then went back thru both Houses.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @CNN The personal taxes last for only 10	years bc of the rules of reconciliation. If we had 60 votes they‚Äôd have been permanent and again @tedcruz has a bill ready to go. We need 9 Dem votes. Call your Senators.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump @CNN Again you‚Äôre showing your ignorance. Amendments were added during he process. The debates I am speaking of were all the floor debates during all the regular order of hearings. All of which the Dems decided to do nothing in except protest. I watched 70% of them.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Okay bud, if you insist. I‚Äôm simply using hyperbole bc again he‚Äôs gotten sooo much done - it‚Äôs very impressive.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump POTUS has his free speech rights to say they should be fired, just as I do. He‚Äôs right to say it. They‚Äôre kneeling to our flag for what? Police brutality against criminals? Have some bad cops done bad things - 100% but almost every black man dies at the hands of another black man
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre incorrect. You do not have free speech first amendment protections at your place of work. The constitution protects you from the government. You‚Äôre showing yourself to be uneducated in your responses.
@Justacidic @eye_wuv_errbody @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump So for you it‚Äôs a quid pro quo &amp; free speech doesn‚Äôt matter when you don‚Äôt care about it. How are these things equivalent? None of the people I mentioned have anything to do with the alt right. And if you think they do you are uninformed and uneducated on what the alt right is.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôve yet to hear a single reason why this tax bill is bad for Americans (overall). Did you see @ABC 3 family analysis on the bill? Only 5% of Americans will see a tax increase over $20.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump You say I‚Äôm cultish yet it‚Äôs clear to me you only watch @CNN. The 10 years was literally talked about on business networks all the time. It was discussed in the congressional hearings all the time... did you watch any of the debate or did you just follow the MSM? Be specific.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Be factual. How am I being cultish?
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump The 10 years was talked about a lot. It‚Äôs all bc of reconciliation. You understand @tedcruz has a bill right now. He‚Äôs asked @BernieSanders to partner with him. It turns the 10 permanent. Again, we need Dems for that.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Oops 14%
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump The tax bill is not perfect, but it‚Äôs far better than where we were. We could only do what we could do with 50 votes. 13% off the corporate tax already has tons of companies raising wages, giving out bonuses and promising investment. This is what it‚Äôs all about. Supply side econ
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Do tell my friend. The poor do not pay any taxes. How exactly would any elderly pay more? I know this tax plan well. Be specific.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump All deductions in my mind are handouts. I am for a flat tax on spending. I do not approve of income tax and government run ‚Äúalmost anything‚Äù. The government is ineffective, inefficient and unaccountable to anyone but itself.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump If Dems got involved they could have negotiated your SALT concerns. Trump said so himself in the NYT interview - you should read it if you haven‚Äôt. How do I pay more? BC if you deduct your SALT and all other things are equal I pay more in Federal tax than you - it‚Äôs@that simple.
RT @ABC: Defense Sec. Mattis says U.S. determined to reduce number of civilian casualties in Saudi-led campaign against rebels in Yemen. ht‚Ä¶
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump If you‚Äôre not against free speech infringement, are you against the violent protestors at campuses? I don‚Äôt see how there can be a dichotomy.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump There is no hypocrisy there. Both the players and Trump have their rights. However, they are protesting at their place of employment and in that there are no free speech protections so the teams have every right to fire or penalize.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Trump is a machine Muli. You honestly need to learn a bit more about the person you‚Äôre trying to criticize. All he ever wants to do is work.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Muli, it‚Äôs not fact. Every Republican Senator said Trump got deeply involved. You‚Äôre stating MSM opinion. I was born in 81. Yes, I agree, like every person on earth Trump is a hypocrite.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump I am okay with eliminating more entitlements and deductions. If you want to reduce government even more we‚Äôre on the same page. I wont argue for any handouts unless they are for the truly disabled (not someone who is obese bc all they eat is sugar as an example) and the elderly.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôd have to be more specific. That‚Äôs not always true. But I‚Äôm confused, you‚Äôre cool with the handout, but only if it‚Äôs for you? Trump would have negotiated SALT if your congressmen would have got involved. You should blame them.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump I have an issue for example when @AnnCoulter or @benshapiro or @_miloeifler cannot speak on a campus bc the campus says they cannot protect them and it‚Äôs too dangerous. That is truly an infringement on free speech.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump I have no issue with anyone protesting or speaking their truth. I have an issue with violence and property damage (things perpetuated on campuses not by the POTUS). Why are you against free speech?
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Clearly I am also using hyperbole, as Trump always does. I don‚Äôt believe anything (here I go again) is always or never. I am exaggerating for effect.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Trump was talking to Congressmen(women) every single day. He was working with his appointments nonstop. He‚Äôs always working. You seriously need to learn more about the man. You‚Äôre confused by the rhetoric. You‚Äôre literally just believing his critics.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump BC no one would ever tell you Trump isn‚Äôt a hard worker. Even his critics understand he is non stop. To say he didn‚Äôt get into tax reform shows your ignorance. There is a reason tax reform and especially Anwar were never done in my lifetime.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump First, SALT deductions are bad for America. Why should I pay more federal tax than you just bc my governor and state government can crush it without all the taxing? We can agree to disagree. There is no factual basis here.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump FYI I know it‚Äôs not even him, it‚Äôs all his amazing appointments and his deal making (with tax reform as an example). This is why I changed parties. I knew a real entrepreneur would change the game as POTUS. Until you‚Äôve at least read #TheArtoftheDeal you shouldn‚Äôt speak on Trump
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Trump isn‚Äôt perfect. No one is blind. But he is crushing the job of POTUS. America has never done so well in its first year of a POTUS. @realDonaldTrump is truly #MAGA!
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not talking about all people. But yes, I do generally believe that college aged men, with tons of money, are much more likely to be terrible to women than compared to someone without money and means.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump We look at the totality. Golfing is fine. Obama didn‚Äôt get anything done besides a terrible terrible ‚ÄúClimate deal‚Äù and the worst healthcare fix ever. Trump has got SO MUCH done. It‚Äôs unreal. Even @CNN cannot disagree.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump There are like 1,000 in the alt right. There are 100,000+ in the alt left. I‚Äôm not too concerned about the crazy side of my party, as it rarely ever appears in society. Your fringe is all over campuses actually trying to stop free speech.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump He has the right to get upset at protest. He is also a citizen. You don‚Äôt have to like his candor. I voted for Obama twice, but he totally lied to us. The second time, that was my fault. He destroyed this country.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump He‚Äôs the hardest working POTUS ever. No one questions his work ethic. He‚Äôs golfing and working. He never stops working. You clearly don‚Äôt know much about Trump. Tax reform, SALT displacement and ANWAR. Wow. Only the first year. MAGA.

@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump You know Trump once owned a football team in the USFL. He lead the charge and won an antitrust suit against the NFL. Eventually they merged. You should learn more about his life. He‚Äôs a genius negotiator.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump So in your view the POTUS should not have free speech? I also feel the anthem protests are bullshit. I served this country. We don‚Äôt kneel to our flag. Cops are not inherently racist either.
@Justacidic @Leslie67915456 @realDonaldTrump Truth to your statement, but I believe both the alt left and right are crazy and need to move away from the fringe. So do tell, how has he ‚Äúinfringed‚Äù? Which by the way is a fairly strong word meaning to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù.

@Aelin24012198 @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Because he does not serve the elites as every Democrat and Republican I've ever seen does
@Aelin24012198 @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Because the actions he has taken at our federal agencies have been phenomenal. His rollbacks of regulations have been a game changer.
@20indicia @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump What an outlandish claim. Who believes in propaganda? You definitely watch CNN.
@20indicia @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Ok well then it's likely we just see the world differently. Isn't that ok? I don't believe in conspiracy. I like to see the evidence.
@20indicia @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump How'd that Iraq war turn out? Benghazi? Sadly, our government is very broken. Finally a POTUS who isn't controlled by the system. MAGA
@20indicia @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Who's the one believing propaganda? I only look at what's actually happened. I don't watch CNN.
@meghanchel In fact, legally speaking he could've halted the investigation.
@meghanchel They have so much legal authority. You can only obstruct something for which you do not have authority over.
@meghanchel I'm still laughing that you're bringing up obstruction. Do you realize it's basically impossible to try a POTUS under that statute?
@clptnfan @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Although maybe you're just so angry bc you can't find love, and with that I feel bad for you bc I do care for all humans. MAGA - even for u

@clptnfan @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump That's factually inaccurate. I replied to Trump's tweet, and I am only replying to you because you replied to me. You're very disrespectful.

@clptnfan @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump I hope you're not a Dem bc to use a word like Cronie...they're all freaking corrupt. Thank for Trump ain't a politician.
@meghanchel Just sit back and watch. You'll be whining about Mueller soon bc he's gonna start looking into the illegal politically motivated unmasking
@steveblair17 @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump If you're a Dem, you drank the koolaide bud. I simply decide based on what is best for me, my family, and my country. Hillary was garbage
@meghanchel Dershowitz is the Democratic legal mind. When he says there is no illegality I know he's way more on point than you - who has no legal ed.
@20indicia @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Wait and see. In the end you'll complain bc Dems are gonna get lit up for their illegal surveillance for political purposes which is illegal
@meghanchel There is no investigation into obstruction. You won't find that "fact" anywhere. Conflicts - I wouldn't disagree but those are hard to prove
@clptnfan @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Then why are you trolling? I see no factual evidence he's been "wrong". I love his goals and vision - is there a reason we cannot disagree?
@meghanchel You cannot obstruct justice by doing something you have a constitutional right to do. Listen to Dershowitz. He'll clear it up for you.

@meghanchel @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump To make a statement like that, and without being able to back it up, shows some serious ignorance.
@meghanchel @DaysLeft4Trump @realDonaldTrump Actually I pay very close attention, and not a single reputable legal mind agrees w you, and thus I think you should likely question urself

@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I wish Congress could move faster, but our system is deliberately designed to be slow.
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Slow down there. These things are coming. Why would you expect them so quickly? With all Dems ACA took 18 months. It takes time sadly.
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump It's okay that you want a bigger government and I want a smaller one. Let's agree to disagree and work to negotiate the best policies we can
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I don't really care about debating legislation. You're a lefty right? You're not going to see things as I do, which is fine, right?
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You added some arbitrary standard of "major" post facto. Did you not? Thankfully, we continue to kick people like you out of power :)
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I'm aware of every bill. I simply said he's signed the most legislation this quickly in my lifetime.

@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Why would I be worried? ACA took 18 months so we're moving way faster. I like the House and Senate bills. Anything to shrink federal power üëç
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump There are pages and pages of signed legislation. Checkout https://t.co/C2mAaekKax or you can look through the Congressional site.
@TrumperTrolling @Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Well since Brian labels that as truth I guess we'll go with it. Reality - most legislation passed in our lifetime in such a short period
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Once again explain the # of voice votes? Why are Dems slow walking appointments and obstructing?
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Fact - Dems are way off on # of voice votes proving obstruction.
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Fact - it took 18 months to pass ACA under Dem control. Fact - Trump has signed way more bills to this point than Obama had.

@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump My point is that the minority party always has to bend more than the majority party, but the Democrats are not willing to bend even a little
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump That's interesting I was actually pushed right of center because of Obama. Love the goals of the current Admin.

@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump We don't way a POTUS picking every appointment alone. They need appointments to then appointment more. Dems are trying to run out the clock.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You also have to remember that the slow walking of the initial appointments then makes it more difficult to pick deputies.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I honestly want to see the parties come together. I'm a pretty centered conservative, but Dems have to move closer to the center. Waiting...
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I acknowledge he has less appointments at this time, but do you understand the situation with the voice votes?
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Correct and I replied to you. The number of appointments that you put up has nothing to do with confirmations.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Dems should be working w Reps. Reps control; Dems need to bend. It's really that simple.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump And to walk out of a session to prevent cloture is not only obstructionism but childish as well. I'm not a fan of any obstruction.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Reflect my efforts? How does a name reflect efforts. I'm stating factually that Dems are not providing the right level of voice votes.

@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Dems have even gone as far as walking out to prevent cloture. You can't make up this obstruction. The Dems are a party of nothing. Sad.
@HeatherlyArts @rcvobert @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump The reason he has less confirmed is bc of way less voice votes. The number of appointments doesn't impact confirmation process.
@Whysthat0 @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You need to learn how to make a response using one tweet, two max.
@Ang30331048 @LaurieEmm @janAdele86 @rcvobert @HeatherlyArts @TrumperTrolling @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You're likely forgetting Dems had complete control for O's first 2. He was so bad they lost total control.

@janAdele86 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure you understand how the Senate works.
@nprice41 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump And without 60 in the Senate you can't do much.
@nprice41 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump I'm not really sure what you're talking about, but he has appointed many people. How does SCOTUS have anything to do w legislation?
@bejeebies @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump That's not a bad thing. I'm all for a small government.
@bejeebies @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Oh he has definitely appointed many people. The screening process is fairly long. I do agree there are way less appointments, but...
@Jaxgma3235 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You are correct Republicans don't just fall in line like blind sheep, as the Dems do. FYI ACA took almost two years to pass.
@Jaxgma3235 @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump You are talking about doing something through reconciliation. They absolutely need votes to pass any bill through the standard process.
@TerpAttorney @DanJCass @foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump Of course they can obstruct. They have delayed at every appointment hearing. See how I can reply without making a childish comment?
