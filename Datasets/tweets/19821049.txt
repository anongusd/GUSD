@bswagspeare @RealSaavedra @Vermeullarmine Maybe there wouldn‚Äôt be a need for a wall if laws were created to prosecute not protect those who come to our country illegally.  They, Congress, have created a need for the wall.  (Congress failing to create stricter laws that are enforced!) once again they are refusing to work.
@bswagspeare @RealSaavedra @Vermeullarmine You‚Äôre missing the point.   Their job is to secure our borders.  Their job is to make the laws - put something permanent on the books.  They‚Äôre playing games.  When is the last time they actually came together to fix a problems with illegal immigration?
@FOX2News (5) This shut down is on Congress not Trump.  We all know it.
@tweets4tom @FOX2News Yep, they don‚Äôt really care about the workers.  It‚Äôs all about getting their way.
@Kentjones17 @FOX2News He said ‚Äúone way or the other‚Äù from the get go.   Go back to pre-President days.  Listen to the rallies.  We always knew it could be in the from of a compromise.  Ie...trade.  Some people just took it too literally.
@tweets4tom @FOX2News They want to continue to resist..
@FOX2News (4) without pay until they do what we sent them there to do.  This is the crux of the shutdown.  Trump pressuring them to do their job period.  Protect the American people by doing your job!  That‚Äôs what he wants from them.  He said so... ‚Äúgive them a chance‚Äù - they‚Äôre failing.
@FOX2News (3) Legal laws put into place by congress that are binding not just a penned in temporary presidential order.  That‚Äôs all we could get out of Obama because congress didn‚Äôt do their job then either.  This is nothing new.  They refuse to work together and should be the ones to work
@FOX2News (2). A border wall is a small price to pay to slow the rush we‚Äôve been experiencing.  CONGRESS has been lax to say the least in ending the immigration problem this country has.  Trump expects them to do their job!!  So do we citizens who elected them.  We need a lasting solution!
@FOX2News Just watched the comments on ‚ÄúLet it Rip‚Äù.   The Quesion:  Is is fair to hold the wall as ransom for shutting down part of the government?  What was missing is the fact that, with illegal immigration comes a cost to all citizens that over the years is astronomical.  (1)

Good, bad, true or false it Impacts
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôll let you rest.  Sorry you‚Äôre down for a bit.   Not seeing the other tweets. Take care.
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump I guess I don‚Äôt see how you believe that only an educated person should receive a good living wage.  I‚Äôm not talking a high middle class income but at least a comfortable wage. A college degree should give you a Luxurious lifestyle of sorts.  I don‚Äôt begrudge anyone a good wage.
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Not everyone has the stamina to get through college..  I believe everyone has tough times.  Sorry for your loss during yours.  I commend you for that.  I went through college while raising my family and working a full time job.
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump When good jobs for uneducated people dwindle, then I see an issue.  I too was educated and had a very good job.  Starting wages were going down and so we‚Äôre pensions.  Both my husband and I were in fields where that happened to new hires.  They will never see the wages we had.
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump That happened because of ACA (Obama care.) Companies with over 50 employees had to pay for part of their health care cost.  By going to part time workers they eliminated that cost.  Over and out - you guys on the left want to believe your own truth.
@Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @thatkeith @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Good paying jobs dwindled under Obama.  Part time jobs increased, lower wage jobs where people had to work more than one to make ends meet were increased. If you call that increasing jobs,  I call foul!  A family still had to get assistance working jobs like that.
@toilettweetage @thatkeith @Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Proof positive!!
@toilettweetage @thatkeith @Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump You must be watching fake news.   My health Care cost have gone down during Trump years and more than Tripled under Obama.   How‚Äôs that?

@thatkeith @Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Health care cost skyrocketed.  My check was worth less and less as his term lengthened.  I was ecstatic when Trump won!   I know a lot of people felt the same. You don‚Äôt  have to like the man to love his business savvy brain.   But I love both- he takes no crap.
@thatkeith @Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Perception that a businessman was now in charge would bring good results in our economy not Obama‚Äôs doing.  I can tell you for a fact my 401k grew very little during his years also my wages in the federal government was stagnant.  His policies made me think I woujd never retire.
@thatkeith @Caitlinh24 @LGillon2 @toilettweetage @Woody4KC @ememmerson1 @PMS71771 @realDonaldTrump Keith, the renegotiated agreements between countries that were taking advantage of the US is huge in the perception of our growing economy.

@ThaDufus @bradcrites @CherylkOfficial @Andrea_L70 @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump You should try a dose of the Red Pill.  Enlighting!  Check the backgrounds of MSM‚Äôs ties with past left wing governments.  See where they are really coming from.  Biased as hell!!

Tells a lot about the direction the MSM took a long by time ago.  Wake up America
@CherylkOfficial @Andrea_L70 @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump Amen sister!  Passing the buck as on like everything else, Isis, NK, Election tampering, Daca, Immigration, National Securiy, Jobs.... etc.  Obama was one big TRAIN WRECK to out nation!  He earned a huge paycheck for sitting  on his duff.   No way did he win re-election honestly.
@poconomtn The biggest freaking load of stink we have witnessed in our day, and they turn a blind eye!  They are so full of hate for our president and self righteous despicable double standards that they can‚Äôt even look in the mirror.    What a revelation, if they were to open their eyes..

Maryland and Massachusetts are pushing to allow illegals to vote in local elections.  How is this even right?
@RathertJanet @SomersetVic @IAmBritishreal @realDonaldTrump Wow really?  Let me spell it out for you.

@Startaconvo1 @comradebernout @S373NS1N5 @e_t_davis @LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 My other though is how about both sides finally come to the table to work on moving America in the right direction.  We need compromise.  They are paid to work not obstruct- why do they continue to get voted in when they prove they are a brick wall.
@Startaconvo1 @comradebernout @S373NS1N5 @e_t_davis @LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 Never has their been such despicable hatred aimed at a president.  There in lies the problem.  He won.   Let him reign for his term.  If he doesn‚Äôt fit the bill vote him out..but if he does, we all benefit.
@Startaconvo1 @comradebernout @S373NS1N5 @e_t_davis @LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 I agree to a point.. it‚Äôs really about shutting their hatred down.  I believe the right leaning supporters have had enough of the divisiveness.  Can you image if we all pulled together how well tuned America would be.  If we keep ignoring their progressive push-where would we be?
@DDbarnes340 @Tweetsfor45 @Golfinggary5221 For sure!
@comradebernout @Startaconvo1 @S373NS1N5 @e_t_davis @LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 This has a little bit of credible truth to it.  Most of us on the right believe there is goodness on the left.   Although the far far left liberalism and the nasty vile rhetoric coming from the left has divided the country beyond repair anytime soon.  Sad to say.
@Startaconvo1 @S373NS1N5 @comradebernout @e_t_davis @LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 Guess you‚Äôre not too educated to the corruption on the left that you support so strongly.  Do some research.
@LWilsonDarlene @charliekirk11 No doubt!
Only the left is in fear of a reversal of the Roe vs Wade decision.  Instead of using an abortion for birth control, why not obtain or use a proven methods as intended before conception.  Just a thought...
@charliekirk11 That‚Äôs a given.  What about those states allowing non -citizens to vote?  Since when does America let other countries citizens decide our laws?
@Tweetsfor45 @Golfinggary5221 There's talk of her ramping up to run for a third time in 2020.  Despicable!   People need to remember her past.

@minibebz @CalebJHull Down right vile comment.  Keep it to yourself.  No one wants to hear this.
@ThugSD91 @CalebJHull Did your mom forget to teach you the saying "if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all"??  That is where the left in this country is going wrong.  Vile hatred is on your sleeves.  Shake it off to get through the pearly gates.

@PIB8buoy @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs definitely against all the rules when working for a federal agency to engage in politics.   They should lose their job.  Anyone else would have.

@juniman73 @RichardTBurnett You are correct!  If all republicans have a good rep-ore with their own children and steer them in the right direction in life. Then the Dems can‚Äôt project their stinking thinking onto our young adult children.  Teach them to think for themselves.

You should be thankful Trump ran and is keeping our country from further erosion.  Obama was instrumental in this Coup against a sitting president.  (Unprecedented)  Trump should ruin his name.
@FoxNews @MickMulvaneyOMB @POTUS All you self righteous libs, I bet you say things about people you don‚Äôt like all the time..(the President for instance). Your not immune to spewing nastiness from your mouthes.  You just think you‚Äôre the only ones who can do it. No one is perfect!  Mirror
@marklevinshow When Rosenstein gave that letter to Trump explaining the reason why he should fire Comey.   It was part of the fix.  If Trump followed through on his recommendations, it would allow them to follow through with their scheme to put the SP. Investigation in play.  Been saying it.
@PoliticusSarah Sarah has a very tough job, Standing up to the idiot journalist that have forgotten how to report honest newsworthy stories.  Most Americans are sick of it!   M. Wolf was not funny- would you want someone to treat you or your child that way? True test before speaking
@juliet_delaney @realDonaldTrump Even the Dems don't like Comey.  Remember?  He was blames for Hillary's loss..did you forget?  Now he's what? The Almighty Savior to you left wing nuts? No one should give him one RED cent!   Idiotic People to say the least.
@patriciagallery @realDonaldTrump Who cares?
@ShellyShields16 @realDonaldTrump Not likely....We're on to you guys!
@SusanLittlehal1 @realDonaldTrump President Trump- that would be the worst thing you could do.  Give in to their crybaby antics.  For the good of our country Susan, you could stop the resistance and help right the wrongs this country has been dumped into.
@rkbroder @realDonaldTrump Who would you suggest?  Since you have all the answers?
@SickofTrump76 @realDonaldTrump How would anyone know if they are qualified since they aren't even Vetting them! They aren't doing their job.  Worst congress we've ever had.   Their acting like babies because things are changing, for the better-vote them all out!
@HindieBD @allaboutme4545 @realDonaldTrump It didn't take 15 months.   Trump still has hundreds not approved!  Thats their job to vet the applicants and get these positions filled -they are preventing this country from running as well as it can. A timeline should be implemented. *Not followed-he gets his picks-PERIOD!!
@realDonaldTrump Extortion216-Spot On!!
@realDonaldTrump DJSchults-Seriously your memory betrays you!
@THE_TNT_TEAM How can I join your forum?
@GOP @POTUS Sad day.
@IamR00by @thelaurakoski @Couchspud44 @snowmother4 @realDonaldTrump The path to our Lord and heaven starts with accepting Jesus as the savior.  No matter when it happens in your life God accepts and welcomes you.  God is working through Trump.   It‚Äôs Obvious to believers.
@SpeedieEdieBomB @PdClout @massey35121 @stopyut @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Health Care should be affordable.  Aca was not.  Those paying for-insurance (notgetting handouts) stopped going to the doctors because of the deductables.  Free heatlhcare recipients were going for sniffles. Horrible law!!
@TheTonyCardone @foxandfriends @GovMikeHuckabee There to Earn a paycheck but not working us ok with you?  Fire Her.
@susandeame @foxandfriends @GovMikeHuckabee She was paid for doing a job- not for texting her boyfriend all day.  She wasnt doing her job.  Fire her -any other company would-No matter what the content of her messaging.
@SenKamalaHarris Kamala Harris,The man doesn‚Äôt know how to tell the truth.
@neontaster At least people can start to Dream again..
@HoarseWisperer @OdinMo @9Gweedo @DebbyPepWatson @realDonaldTrump It wasn‚Äôt a law.  No need that challenge it.  That‚Äôs why Trump scrapped It.  Do it right- create a LAW on the books.  Congress‚Äôs Job not the Presidents.  He‚Äôs telling them to do their job..Dem‚Äôs are stalling.  Wonder Why??
@HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump It was never fixed!   It was a taped together one man fix.  Trump is expecting the congress, we elected, to do THEIR job and put a law on the books to give the DACA recipients real security.   Six month time line from Trump. Dems won‚Äôt talk or come to the table..WHY?
@TGowdySC You‚Äôre truly one of the good guys!  I‚Äôm going to make miss you...so will our government.
@UnwisedWords @MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump You talk about all the lies.  What are they?  Are you sure the media isn‚Äôt brainwashing you with their spun web of deceit?  They‚Äôve got Soro‚Äôs behind them - be careful what you believe....
@realDonaldTrump True-the assault is against Americas Christian faith.  (No manger displays-no Christmas trees in public-No Merry Christmas in public businesses-No Place for God in public schools.) Whiplash from intolerants if we so dare.  The Assault is REAL and everyone knows it. Time to fight!

Parents who are lied to by their teens- are they held responsible for knowing what goes on 24-7? (Can't be) Same concept as Snyder's delima.
Tired of the Governor, who was being lied to about what was going on with the Flint water crises, being blamed and ridiculed for the Mess.
