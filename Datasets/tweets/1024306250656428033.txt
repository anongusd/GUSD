@ScottWalker You clearly do not understand how marginal tax rates work.
And one that many may not be paying close attention to. The administration is responsible for regulation, in accordance with the law, and it seems someone should pay attention to this potential method of obstruction of justice that may not normally receive attention.
He later referenced "current" regulations regarding releasing conclusions of the report even if content related to that conclusion could not be released.  While I don't think he was necessarily pointing at something, it could be a backdoor way of undermining the release.
@maddow Could the Trump administration change regulations regarding the release of the Mueller report in order to protect the President?  AG nominee made several statements today regarding following regs and laws regarding the release of the report.

@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson I am not ignoring anything.  MY entire point has been that if you have a problem with Warren, then use FACTS to attack her, not LIES.  Misrepresenting something because it fits your narrative better, is lying.  That is what YOU are doing, not me.
@danielle760 @JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson This DNA test was not so she could SEEK anything from any first nation.  It is simply a rebuttal to continuous attacks from the President.  Making it anything more than that is simply partisan politics.
@danielle760 @JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Your membership OR opinion is not relevant to genetic science.  It works exactly the same in you as it does in any other human.  She is making no "claim", unless you have evidence of a petition to be recognized by the Cherokee or Delaware nations.  I have seen no such thing.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson What federal forms did she list it on?  The only thing I have seen evidence of Warren herself doing is listing herself as a minority in a directory of law professors. That's meaningless.  Everything else has come as a result of political attacks.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson The date matters because you are conflating the recent DNA test with things she said YEARS ago.  Show me evidence that she is claiming TODAY that the test proves she is Cherokee and Delaware.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson That doesn't mean other humans were not here at some point, and displayed signs of activity.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  What there ISN'T is DNA evidence that there was settlement AND dispersion through the continents, like the BLB theory.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson The same guy who did the study that Smithsonian is reporting on, did a study that was published this year (so, AFTER that one) where he does not dispute the BLB theory.  Whether they actually crossed the bridge or not is irrelevant, that is the accepted path among archaeologists.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson Wierd, that recipe IS NOT FROM 2018.  Also, did she write the recipe book?  Did she edit it?  Do you have ANY evidence she herself put that there?
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson She cited oral histories passed down through her family.  That IS NOT the same thing as claiming the DNA test results prove ANY tribal connection and Warren has NOT claimed her DNA test does.  STOP LYING.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson If you had actually read the report, you would know it says the most likely generation was the 8th.  The 8th generation is 1/256, or 0.39%.  The average white American has 0.18% Native American DNA.  0.39%/0.18%=2.17.  TURN OFF YOUR #FAKENEWS PROPAGANDA.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson Just because it is just as likely to be 10th as 6th, doesn't mean using 10 and not 6 is honest.  You are cherry picking one because it fits your narrative.  THAT IS A LIE.  The report gives a range.  If you only give one side of the range and not the other, you are LYING.
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson The DNA samples from Mexico, Peru, and Columbia are from Native Americans from those countries.  They spread there from the same ~250 people who originally crossed the Bering Land Bridge and BEAR THE SAME GENETIC MARKERS AS NATIVE AMERICANS FROM THE USA. https://t.co/qpc8pUjLjc
@JohnBurleson @danielle760 @bennyjohnson Show me ANYWHERE in the DNA test results that indicate they were testing for Cherokee heritage.   That's right, you CAN'T, because it DOESN'T.

@danielle760 @JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Tell me, did the DNA of natives from Alaska suddenly change when they crossed into Canada fourteen thousand years ago?  Just because you don't believe in science, doesn't make it false.  It just makes YOU ignorant.
@danielle760 @JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Native Americans from Peru and Mexico bear the SAME genetic markers (DNA) as Native Americans from Oklahoma, and from Alaska.  Or do you think the DNA changed when their ancestors applied for visas to immigrate from the United States TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO?
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson She put it in a law school DIRECTORY.  That is NOT a "false claim to advance her legal and political career."  That means SHE WAS ALREADY AT THE LAW SCHOOL when she did that, so it helped nothing.  She entered politics in 2012 and SHE didn't bring it up, her opponent did.
@karenvance0810 @garrisonmartin8 @JesseKellyDC Yes, 1/1024 is the 10th generation.  The DNA test results said 6-10 generations.  6th generation is 1/64.
@thehill Waiting for President Trump to denounce this EVIL protest during our SACRED National Anthem... Wait, shit...
@gdkenoyer @AmericanCO91 Yes, as it was not possible for her to make a statement in 2012 about a report she received in 2018.  If so, then stay away from Salem, MA, Senator!  Some are apparently unable to grasp basic math concepts, like the subtle nuances between the numbers 6, 10, 2012, and 2018...
@storm_paglia HAHAHAHA, what?  The report also says she may be 1/64th (1.6%), and that she is most likely 1/256th (.39%), which are both MORE than .18%.  You should know your facts before you make an ass of yourself.
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer That video is from 2012
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer That video is from 2012
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer That video is from 2012.  The DNA test was released today.  To my knowledge, Warren has made NO CLAIM that the DNA test proves any kind of TRIBAL ancestry, since it CAN'T.  If you have evidence she did, please provide it.
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer DNA proves genetic history.  Whether or not the Cherokee nation recognizes it is irrelevant to its scientific veracity.
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer No she isn't.  She is saying her DNA test proves she has Native American ancestry.  That is ALL.  She has PREVIOUSLY cited ORAL HISTORIES of Cherokee and Delaware ancestry.
@AmericanCO91 @UltimaT09819438 Execpt you are lying again.  Because she said HER MOM told the story.  You are seriously attacking someone based on an oral history?  Really?  Seems pretty ironic given that Native American histories have been primarily passed down orally.
@AmericanCO91 @gdkenoyer She is repeating an oral history.  That makes her a liar?  Also, you claim to care about someone telling the truth and continue to lie about her DNA results, which said her Native American ancestry is between 1/64th and 1/1024th.  Means her grandparent could have been 1/16.
@AmericanCO91 Show me the request she has made to the Cherokee nation to be recognized as a Cherokee.  Or show me something she has ever said that indicates she has ANY desire to do so.
@AmericanCO91 SHE ISN'T ASKING THE CHEROKEE NATION TO RECOGNIZE HER.  That is a legal process that she has not requested or made any indication that she EVER WILL.  But hey, I guess every American who ever repeated an oral history is a liar, right?
@AmericanCO91 I'm sure Warren would mention nothing of it if she were not being consistently attacked.  I would imagine Warren wishes she never said anything.  This story is ONLY kept alive because Trump continually attacks her.
@AmericanCO91 I have never said she is.  I am saying she has a DNA report that says she has a Native American ancestor in the 6th to 10th generation and that she has cited oral histories of Cherokee heritage, similar to MANY Americans.
@AmericanCO91 See, now you are being disingenuous.  Certainly, you were not making that broad of a generalization when you said "Many people had to prove they were Cherokee to be recognized"
@AmericanCO91 No, she is responding to attacks by the President.  We ALL have oral family histories, and all of them vary in how true they are.  That is the nature of oral histories.  She repeated one publicly (certainly for political reasons) and has been attacked for it.
@AmericanCO91 In what way?  The head of the appointment committee that appointed her at Harvard says it played no role, and an investigation by the Boston Globe verified that. https://t.co/A2l1raifXm
@AmericanCO91 Is she ASKING the Cherokee Nation to recognize her?  I've seen no evidence that she is.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson The academic term is "essentialization", or the belief that ALL people of a certain population group are ESSENTIALLY the same, based on stereotypes/tropes/other inaccurate and ignorant beliefs about the population.  Using "Pocahontas" in the pejorative does EXACTLY that.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Something is not "racist" because of the "race" of the person is directed at, it is because it shows a lack of dignity and respect for persons of another "race", and seeks to marginalize those people based on that "race". "Pocahontis" is such a term when used in the way Trump did
@AmericanCO91 Apples and Oranges.  Warren said she had Cherokee heritage based on oral histories.  So do I (have oral histories of Cherokee heritage).  Many Americans do, I would imagine.  The DNA test does not establish that and Warren has NEVER attempted to make a legal claim of membership.
@AmericanCO91 What's your point? Show me evidence of Warren trying to make a legal claim of membership in ANY first nation.
@AmericanCO91 No, I was not.  The person who said 6-10 apparently did not see the 2/ at the beginning of the post, indicating it was the SECOND post in the thread.  I am not reponsible for someone's lake of attention to detail. Here is the FIRST:  https://t.co/zQCppfjOEB
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson So you are saying you have more knowledge and expertise than the person who did the test/analysis?  Care to cite your credentials, professor?  Because the person who wrote the report cited theirs. https://t.co/nB8lmHsHJu
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Yeah, you gotta turn off your Trump #fakenews propaganda network.  They are lying to you.  Show me where Warren has tried to make any LEGAL claim of membership in ANY Native American nation.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson READ THE REPORT.  Are you an expert in conducting these tests?  Because the person who conducted it IS.  The report is very clear, and it says NOTHING about being inconclusive. https://t.co/nB8lmHsHJu
@AmericanCO91 I'm not defending Warren.  I am saying it is dishonest to say it is only 10 or only 6.  The generation the report says is MOST likely is 8, but it gives a range of 6 to 10.  THAT is what should be reported, not cherry picking 10 because it suits you best.  THAT'S A LIE.
@AmericanCO91 What about them?  I would wager that most families with oral histores of Native American ancestry reference the larger first nations. Cherokee, Sioux, Navajo, Apache, etc. If Warren is repeating stories that were repeated to her, then her story is consistent with many I've heard.
@unclepaulyrules @AmericanCO91 The passage of native peoples over the Bering Land Bridge, and their dispersion throughout the Americas has been established genetically, and through anthropological and archaeological research.  DNA does not have a "nationality".
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson It doesn't matter.  She isn't trying to join the nation, she is trying to defend herself from racist attacks by Donald Trump.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson I'm not defending Warren.  I have no interest in her political claims of Native American ancestry.  I am simply saying that the DNA test results are consistent with what she has previously said publicly about her lineage.
@AmericanCO91 I say a good percentage of American fmailies have oral histories that tell of Native American history.  In my family I have heard of both Cherokee and Blackfeet Sioux.  Who knows what is true, but that doesn't mean Warren is lying.  It means she is American.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Not really.  The migration of native peoples over the Bering Land Bridge and through the Americas has been established as fact, and their DNA markers reflect.
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson It's not relevant to the findings in the DNA test.
@MidasRex1998 @JesseKellyDC Pleas READ THE REPORT.  It makes NO mention of LATIN American ancestry. https://t.co/nB8lmHsHJu
@AmericanCO91 So it's ok to lie if you don't like the person you are lying about?  Not to me...
@AmericanCO91 I am not defending Warren, I am defending the truth.  I have little interest which side that lands on.  Facts are not partisan.
@AmericanCO91 Read the report.  It says the most likely generation is the 8th, but give a range of 6th to 10th.  Trump's #fakenews propaganda is ONLY saying it is the 10th generation.  That is cherry picking and THAT is the lie. https://t.co/nB8lmHsHJu
@JohnBurleson @bennyjohnson Yes, 6-10.  Meaning it is just as likely it is 6 as it is 10.  So saying it is 10 without acknowledging it is ALSO 6, is cherry picking.  That is a LIE.  Moreover, this is a thread.  I said 6-10 generations in 1/
@karenvance0810 @JesseKellyDC 10 generations is 1/1024.  The report CLEARLY states 6-10 generations.  6 generations is 1/64.  Saying it is 10 without also saying it is 6 is a fallacious argument.  In other words, STOP LYING.
@AmericanCO91 The "it" I was referring to is the fallacious argument cherry picking the 10th generation without acknowleging the report gives a 6-10 generation range.  Fallacious arguments are disingenuous, hence they are lies.
@bennyjohnson 3/ That is ENTIRELY consistent with her previous claims of Native American ancestry and would make it HIGHLY likely that stories of Native American ancestry were told within the family.
@bennyjohnson 2/ Six generations is 1/64th, and means that her great-grandparent, who she may have known, may have also known THEIR great-grandmother, who was full blooded Native American.
@bennyjohnson Cherry pick much?  You are nothing more than another cog in Trump's #fakenews propaganda machine.  You are using the 10th generation, when the results CLEARLY stated Warren's Native American ancestor was from the SIXTH to the tenth generation. 1/

@newsbusters Do you pay attention to anything, or just talk out your ass because it smells good to you?  "Strong evidence" is the term that was used in the DNA test report.  Or, because you aren't really journalists, you didn't bother to read that.  Just another opportunity to stir shit...
@ddale8 Clearly, the only environment Donald Trump cares about is his own...
@JesseKellyDC 3/ That is ENTIRELY consistent with her previous claims of Native American ancestry and would make it HIGHLY likely that stories of Native American ancestry were told within the family.
@JesseKellyDC 2/ Six generations is 1/64th, and means that her great-grandparent, who she may have known, may have also known THEIR great-grandmother, who was full blooded Native American.
@JesseKellyDC He didn't "crush her".  He parroted the talking points being put out by his #fakenews propaganda machine, and used the 10th generation, when the results clearly stated Warren's Native American ancestor was from the SIXTH to the tenth generation. 1/
@CalebJHull Umm...6 generations would be 1/64th.  The DNA test found Native American ancestry from 6-10 generations ago.  6 generations means that her great-grandmother, who she may have known, may have also known HER great-grandmother, who was full blooded Native American.
@theshrillest It's not so much to prove her ancestry as to prove that she is not lying, as Trump claims.  He will continue to attack her anyway, I am sure.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty I won't argue that 9/11 wasn't politicized by the Bush administration.  It was, and continues to be, politicized by ALL sides of politics.  But you suggest foreknowledge and intentional incompetence to achieve a political end, based on a few absurdly stretched circumstances.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 2/ Any similarities could just as easily be explained by commonalities in ideology.  Making the leap from association to a "Fruedian slip" in a position paper that gave it all away that 9/11 was intentionally allowed, is quite a stretch of imagination.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty "sprang from"?  10 of the signatories of the PNAC statement of principles in 1997, went on to work for the Bush 43 administration.  That DOESN'T mean that they worked for, at, or with PNAC in any meaningful way, or that PNAC's positions on anything influenced Bush policy. 1/
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty It wasn't a joke about 9/11.  It was a joke about misfortune, and the term "trifecta" was in reference to the three things that might happen to cause Bush deficit spending, DID happen.  Deficit spending was something Bush campaigned against, so the connection is pretty clear.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty I've seen no reports, from the Suskind book or any other sources that Bush used the word "leave".  All reports say he said "All right.  You've covered your ass now."  Minor point, but for the sake of accuracy...
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 5/ All of these are only VERY loosely or potentially related circumstances.  None of them are evidence of anything.  If ANYTHING, it is a cautionary tale of how toxicity in government led to tragedy.  We should remember that in TODAY'S environment.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 4b/ ...fired around that time (had his own problems) and the investigation into bin Laden all but shut down.  Tenet/CIA had MUCH to do with this environment, and Bush was fed up with it by Aug 2001.  Clearly, he should have paid more attention.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 4a/ ...and through the transition to Bush in 2001.  Bush admin didn't like it, thought it was messing up their transition, and Bush's agenda.  By that time, briefings had devolved in some cases to shouting matches and the FBI's lead investigator from SDNY was...
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 4/ Read (or watch) Looming Tower.  If you understand the toxicity between the CIA and FBI pre-9/11, Bush's comment to the briefer makes more sense.  Tenet enabled it, and it bled over into WH meetings/briefings.  Bin Laden had been talked about extensively during Clinton years...
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 3/ During the 2004 campaign, Bush had a story he used about DEFICIT SPENDING, in which he had commented during his 2000 campaign he would only do it if there was war, recession, or national emergency.  Hence the "trifecta" joke.  Bush was well known for self-deprecating humor....
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 2a/ That DOESN'T mean they advocated for it, or had ANY influence because of their report.  Having served during that time, there was some shifting in the ways we fought, equipment, org structure, etc.  But that was because of the nature of the conflict, NOT a think-tank report.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 2/ PNAC was a neo-con think tank, NOT the government.  The 2000 report was "Rebuilding America's Defenses" and they were correct.  Fundamentally transforming the way the military operates happens very slowly, absent emergent circumstances that force it.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 1/ Re: Bush/Cheney Testimony.  He is the POTUS, so he has priviledge.  Kean, the chairman of the 9/11 commission said "This is real history.  Presidents just don't do this.  Presidents don't meet with commissions like this."  Bush wasn't "allowed" to do ANYTHING, he agreed to.
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor So it's ok for the president to be as tribal/partisan as he wants because fuck em anyway? Really? Facts are not liberal or conservative. If the media is providing factual reporting, then it just is what it is. Not being slanted to your side DOESN'T mean it is slanted to the other
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor He is the President of the United States, not the President of the People Who Voted for Him and Still Support Him.  He should not be intentionally "triggering" anyone.  Leaders are not dividers, they are unifiers.  They don't always succeed, but Trump INTENTIONALLY divides.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty But I've never seen anything that legitimately established they "allowed it" because of an ideological agenda.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty Throw into that a new administration that didn't seem to want to be bothered, and Tenet holding over at CIA, and the FBI team couldn't find support.  Yes, there was significant incompetence and politicization of real emergent conditions.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty There was a lot of stuff going on for years, the CIA was particularly tribal, and the FBI unit that was leading the charge had to do much on their own.  By the time 9/11 happened, the tribalism had devolved the situation so much, everything fell apart.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty If you haven't, check out The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 by Lawrence Wright.  The miniseries is also very informative.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 4/ Moreover, you use of the word "also" implied agreement with the previous commenter, and THEIR implication that Bush did it all for the oil. (Which another comment said outright)
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 3/ I'm pretty sure that was the gist of it from the reports, documentaries, docudramas, etc I have seen.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 2/ As far as your question, I think the bin Ladens were allowed to leave because of the connection that was being made between UBL and 9/11, their diplomatic status, and that their lives were in significant danger because their name was bin Laden.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty Point taken.  I conflated your reply about the Bush connection with others who said it was for the oil and didn't clarify which one I was talking to.  /1
@mrscience_ @LarryOConnor What you described is still an accomplice.  Accomplice is very closely related to COMPLICIT.  Active or not, he was a participant.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty I missed no point.  If you have legitimate, fact-based issues with Bush, that is fine.  What you did, though, was say something that is demonstrably FALSE.  Doing so only delegitimizes any legitimate arguments you may have.  Facts MATTER.  Surely the age of Trump has shown that.
@WmRJohnson @LarryOConnor President Trump told us all, and it has been consistently demonstrated through countless reports.  Please don't give me any #fakenews nonsense, either.  The only ones ACTUALLY peddling fake news are Trump and his propaganda network.
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor Donald Trump knows his audience, if nothing else.  And he knows there will be some who it will really annoy, and that THAT annoyance will give fuel to his partisan propaganda machine (Fox News, Breitbart, Daily Wire/Caller, conservative talk radio, etc).  THAT'S his intent.
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor So instead of emphasizing and articulating that Lee is widely recognized as a great military mind, and how that made him a great general, he stirred shit by saying it in a way he knows it going to be inflammatory.
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor You are the one who brought up historians.  I think someone gave Trump a story to tell, and he added his typical, graceless, self-serving hyperbole to it.  Instead of making the story about Meade and Grant, his penchant for stirring shit had to emphasize Lee instead.
@saltyconchy @BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty These ideas you have of the Bush riches are imaginary.  There is literally ZERO evidence of any significant and abnormal increase in wealth by ANYONE responsible for the Iraq war.  It is purely baseless conspiracy theory and ignorant speculation.
@saltyconchy @BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty "Barbara Bush and her husband each had a reported net worth of $25 million at the time of her death"	https://t.co/Ul3cabobld
@saltyconchy @BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty Patently false.  The highest figure I have seen for Cheney's net worth is $105 million.
@BTJ7 @LarryOConnor Historians thoroughly research and develop a deep understanding of the people they write about.  Trump is no historian.  He talks about things he has little real knowledge of, and has no ability to provide the proper nuance and perspective.  He is simply trying to stir shit.
@DanielJHannan What does the guy he defeated have to do with Churchill??
@WilkowMajority Wait, so writing off charitable donations is bad?  Just because someone calls for increased taxes does not mean they also cannot offset their tax burden if they are donating to charity. The two are not mutually exclusive.
@LarryOConnor Rommel was also forced to commit suicide because he participated in a plot to assassinate Hitler.
@LarryOConnor Patton was also a general, and could legitimately critique another general.  Trump, someone who NEVER served, wouldn't know a good general if they landed on him. Trump had someone tell him a story and repeated it because he likes to stir shit.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 4/ So again, if Bush started a couple of wars for oil money, WHERE IS IT???  There is none.  So you are telling me Bush started a couple wars for oil money AND GOT NOTHING??  That is simply absurd.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 3/  If Bush ONLY invested, Dow was ~10,000 in 2000 when he was elected.  Today it is ~26,000.  So, if Bush's 2000 money, unadjusted, were invested and gain at the same rate as the Dow, that is $36.4 million, EXACTLY WHAT HE HAS.
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty 2/ If Bush did it all for oil, where is all the oil money?  House of Saud alone is estimated to be worth $1.4 TRILLION.  THAT'S oil money.  Quick math, $15 million is ~1/1000th of 1% (0.00001) of $1.4 trillion.  So again, where is Bush's oil money?
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty Not the point.  In 2000, W was worth 14 million, after selling his share in Rangers.  Today, that is 20.5 million, inflation adjusted.  So in 18 years, that has only gone up to 35-39 million, depending on estimate.  That's not oil money. 1/
@BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty George W. Bush is worth what, $35 million?  That is fractions of pennies in terms of oil money, 10 years removed from office.
@TerryDRealtor @BanTorture @travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty George W. Bush is worth what, $35 million?  That is fractions of pennies in terms of oil money, 10 years removed from office.
@travitron1000 @BillKristol @GoodTwitty George W. Bush is worth what, $35 million?  That is fractions of pennies in terms of oil money, 10 years removed from office.
@bennyjohnson @cvpayne @FoxBusiness Wait, so "pay to play" is suddenly good?
@JasonLeopold What I see here is that OLC's "considerable number of FOIA requests" it has PROCESSED at the END of FY18 was 194.  When I worked at VA, we processed THOUSANDS a year, and that was just one regional office. (There are 57)
@DLoesch No, it is FAR WORSE.  They are being led by THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  @realDonaldTrump is using the power and authority of government to ACTIVELY subvert the US Constitution.
@Neoavatara Scalise still has a responsibility to be truthful.  If he is leveraging his attack to falsely accuse Democrats of calling for violence, then he should be called out for it.  Being a victim is not a license to lie.
@johnhawkinsrwn Wasn't RWN banned from Facebook for engaging in #fakenews?  Seems to me that MIGHT have something to do with it...
@FaizaPatelBCJ @MazMHussain Liberal relative to the norm in Saudi Arabia, is what I ASSUME they mean...
@TimJGraham “Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist,” says Khaled Saffuri. = NOT ANONYMOUS.  Is this really @newsbusters standard of competence/honesty??
@TimJGraham You do realize the source's name IS IN THE TWEET, right?  If you typed/pasted his name in connection to what he said, then isn't that the exact OPPOSITE of anonymous?
@Devilsmirk @brianstelter @LarryOConnor There is a difference between being ultimately responsible and being personally responsible.  One comes from authority, the other from complicity.
@TryAgain78911 @Devilsmirk @brianstelter @LarryOConnor I'm not certain what is proper when faced with omniscience.  Should I bow? Prostrate myself?
@momma72of2 @brianstelter @LarryOConnor Is it really necessary to take your argument to such an extreme that literally NO ONE is saying what you say they are?
@Devilsmirk @brianstelter @LarryOConnor Not to mention, Ford herself told friends, who may have told friends.  She was looking for an attorney.  Attorneys have offices.  Offices have lots of ears.  Someone could have heard the story from multiple sources with different info, and pieced enough together to find her.
@Devilsmirk @brianstelter @LarryOConnor And staffs, who gossip with other staffs, who gossip with other staffs.  How long do you think it took for word about her to get out on Capitol Hill?  Someone was accusing a SCOTUS nominee of sexual assault.  Really?  Once on the Hill, it's in the media, then many looking.
@LarryOConnor If @brianstelter said it the way you did, he would not be representing facts. We do not KNOW the facts and circumstances surrounding her name being leaked, we only know that it WAS.  There are a number of plausible ways that could have happened, which you ignore.
@PaulMoser52 @TimJGraham There is no "koolaid", there are only FACTS.  We have a president whose BEHAVIOR presents us with facts that cannot be ignored.  Going to Washington to burn everything down and shit on everyone is NOT leadership.  Leaders are unifiers, NOT dividers.
@feraljokes Pretty sure he said "boofing" was flatulence...
@TimJGraham Being married to a monster who is probably the most corrupt President in the history of the presidency doesn't help.  Nixon certainly had more power to enable his corruption.  Hardin, Jackson, Buchanan, Johnson varied to degrees, but Trump? Soulless and unashamed about it.
@Martnee777 @ericfingerhut @gabrielmalor Not what she said.  Ford said she was confused by Grassley in the hearing and thought he was SAYING they offered to send the senators to California.  It was a misunderstanding.  They didn't offer that, they offered staffers, which she declined.
@gabrielmalor They did find out.  SJC offered to send staffers to California to take her testimony, and Ford did not accept because she wanted to talk to the Senators.  She was confused by the question in hearing because she thought Grassley was saying Senators offered to come.  They didn't.
@brianstelter It's not about the media, it's what Drudge/Rush/Hannity/Fox "News"/Daily Wire/Daily Caller/Breitbart/etc. SAY the media is saying.  They have no accountability to the truth, and really, nothing but ratings.  Take something loosely related and twist it to your partisan needs.
@DonWayneHair1 @TimJGraham @brianstelter Broadcast journalist
@TimJGraham @brianstelter Being friends with a politician and spending free time with them is NOT the same thing as openly supporting a political party/candidate while on duty, in front of the camera.
@Kokomothegreat So instead of falling off the wagon...  Also, staged? nah...
@bellagaia1 @seanmdav @JesseKellyDC Interesting that people who have CLEARLY not read the article try to criticize my reading comprehension.  I CAN read, I DID read it, and nowhere does it either state or suggest that she was threatened.
@KrystyniakKaren @RdbReal @redsteeze If you are content in your partisanship, who am I to argue?
@SnidePrince @dcexaminer She didnt go to the same high school, and she never said she never HEARD of him.  She says she doesn't know him.  Big difference.  He wasn't famous in high school, and not for decades later.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet **but NOT THAT any portion of the actual latter were made public prior to the WaPo report.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet According to the New Yorker, the letter's existence became known because Democrat committee members found out about it and were requesting to see it.  At that point, it is Hill gossip and easy to see how it's existence became public. https://t.co/cTiRWHC0xo
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet It looks like there were reports of the letter's existence prior to the Sep 16 WaPo report on Sep 16, but any portion of the actual letter was made public prior to the WaPo report.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet If she were just to send them to the committee, there is no guarantee that her personal, confidential details will not be immediately leaked.  If she gives it to the FBI, it will be placed in the SCIF in the Capitol building with only 100 senators and 10 staffers with access.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet And THAT is what matters, and the reason this allegation should be investigated seriously, thoroughly, and independently.  THAT is what Ford is requesting when she says she will release the evidence only to the FBI.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet I understand what you are saying.  My point is:  How could her attorneys/Feinstein use her politically in 2012 and BEFORE the nomination, if they had no knowledge of her existence?  Everything that happened after that, perhaps.  But the allegation itself is not political.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet To my knowledge, The Privacy Act of 1974 does not make exceptions for politicization.  She is a citizen of the United States, and is protected by the same laws as you and me, and has expressed on NUMEROUS occasions her desire for privacy.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet You continue to ASSUME that Ford is doing this for political motivation. I am not.  Again, 2012/pre-nomination.  There is nothing to suggest that ANYTHING she has done was politically motivated, and if her lawyers are not representing HER, she needs to fire them.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet I absolutely want more facts.  I am not saying she should not give it to the committee, I just respect her desire for this VERY personal information (polygraph and therapist notes) to not be released in a way that may compromise her privacy.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet I need to look at the timline again. Was the letter released before or after the WaPo report? If it was released after, then the release is irrelevant because the accusation is already public, and the story could have gotten out a number of ways.  Ford said she had discussed it.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet It's HIGHLY doubtful we will ever see anything, EVEN if she gives it to the FBI.  She probably does not want to give it to the Committee because she does not want it made public.  Understandable and DOES NOT suggest she is lying.  Very limited people have access to the FBI docs.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Feinstein stated she did not provide the letter because Ford requested confidentiality. FORD stated she did not want this public. The others have been answered. Ford has indicated, through her attorneys, she will provide ALL evidence to the FBI. They have not contacted her for it
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet That is your ASSUMPTION.  It is not a fact.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet I don't care who it is bad for. I don't know Ford and I am not a Democrat. I want a SCOTUS nominee to be properly vetted, and if there is new, credible derogatory information, it should be thoroughly and independently investigated. If that means he loses the nomination, so be it.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Were they using her when she told her husband/therapist in 2012 or when she reported it to the WaPo or her congresswoman (NOT Feinstein), PRIOR to the nomination?  Not possible, because neither her lawyers OR attorneys knew her at that time.  Fact matter.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Really?  If you lie to the FBI, even if not under oath, that is a crime.  BOTH have the power of the law behind them.  If the courts were to compel them to release the documents to the SJC, then I would support that.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet You are operating under the assumption that Ford has political motivations.  I am not.  Again, husband/therapist in 2012, and reported PRIOR to the nomination.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet That's not how it works.  They are not couriers, they are investigators.  They could look at the testimony, the poly, the notes, and use that to piece together the puzzle in order to direct their questioning during the interview.  THAT is investigation.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet She gave sworn testimony. If she lied, that is perjury and she should be prosecuted for it. I have seen nothing that is inconsistent with a person who has experienced significant trauma (which I have personal experience with and have studied fairly extensively, particularly PTSD)
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet The FBI has apparently not contacted her for those documents.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet And Ford has indicated she will release them to the FBI.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet According to her testimony, she was clear it was him in 2012 when she told her husband and her therapist.  She was clear enough that it was him that she contacted the WaPo AND her congresswoman, BEFORE Kavanaugh was nominated.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet It is also unclear that, given the limited scope and timeline for the investigation, that the FBI was afforded the opportunity to thoroughly investigate the matter.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Did she give the same statement to the FBI?  Do we know this?  The report does not discuss that, only that there were text messages between Keyser and McLean.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Again, there are forensic techniques that are employed in real interviews that can reveal latent memories.  It's a real thing.  Look it up.
@linda_clermont @WilkowMajority What makes you believe that?  I was initially satisfied with the nomination.  In fact, I wrote an article DEFENDING him. https://t.co/Qz0lqfqQPW
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet Pressured to what? The report says it was to CLARIFY her testimony, NOT to make a false statement. It suggests that McLean believed that the statement, as reported, was unclear enough that BK used it to refute the allegations. If Keyser didn't do that, clarification is needed.
@SnidePrince @dcexaminer Umm...if you don't remember him, then how are his accomplishments relevant?  Do you follow the accomplishments of every person you have ever met, even briefly or in passing?  Come on, let's not be disingenuous here.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze You stated, "Then nail his ass and take him off the court." That would indicate guilt. I simply responded to that. Congress/WH limited this investigation in TIME and CONTENT. A real reopening of an SF-86 due to new, credible derogatory information would not be limited like that.
@RdbReal @McCormackJohn @jonfitchdotnet I think exactly what I have been saying. I am independent, and I am anti-partisan. I am conservative (perhaps closer to libertarian, so conservatarian?), and I left the Republican party because it has devolved into hyperpartisanship and abandoned values. Particularly since Trump.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze How about not put him on the court in the first place?  You think that a SCOTUS impeachment would be better?
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Yes, both sides have a goal. That should be irrelevant to the process of making sure the nominee is not a criminal, as is alleged.  By the way, your characterization of a FBI background investigation is simply innacurate. Investigations for high level clearances are EXCRUCIATING.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Because the interview by the committee, as related by the prosecutor hired by the GOP to ask their questions, is NOT the way to explore the facts.  Rachel Mitchell made that incredibly clear in her questioning of Ford.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Prior to the hearing, her attorneys requested that an FBI investigation be conducted BEFORE a hearing was held.  That investigastion would include a cognitive interview.  The Senate refused their request and demanded a hearing.  This is a matter of FACT.  They DID request it.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Why would I lend credibility to someone who has a vested interest in diminishing/refuting her testimony, and has CLEARLY been pushing this forward rapidly because the midterms are rapidly approaching and a confirmation would be a GOP win?
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze They are under fire by the PERSON THEY ARE INVESTIGATING.  President Donald John Trump.
@RdbReal @redsteeze C.O.G.N.I.T.I.V.E. I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze I did not suggest that they come to conclusions.  But to suggest that they are only goign to collect and collate witness statements is simply FALSE.
@linda_clermont @WilkowMajority I would be satisfied if the FBI were given the time and the freedom to conduct a complete and thorough investigation.  Partisan concerns about not being able to confirm a SCOTUS nominee before the midterm elections are irrelevant. THAT'S the real GOP motivation here, NOT facts.
@linda_clermont @WilkowMajority The SJC is not the FBI and her statement/testimony IS NOT a congnitive interview, as the FBI would conduct, using forensic methods to bring out additional facts she may not consciously remember.  It's a real thing.  Look it up.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Yes, the Senators are the ones deciding, but the investigatory body reponsible for ALL federal background investigations is the FBI, NOT the Senate.  That is because investigation is LITERALLY their expertise, as is suggested in the I.
@RdbReal @redsteeze If you are suggesting you said it because she is actually incompetent, then how does that relate to your overall argument?  My comment about Feinstien was related to her honesty, and you rebutted that with "didn't know".  Let's not be disingenuous here.
@RdbReal @redsteeze "didn't know" suggests you really believe she DID know.  If not, why bring it up?  If you are implying she did know, because who could NOT know if they are competent, then you are suggesting complicity, which would make her a traitor.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze And yet she is STILL requesting the FBI interview her.  Even if her recollections during the interview might reveal contradictory facts.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Yes, Senators with a political agenda are NOT the same thing as an FBI interview.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze It's not that it is under oath.  There are forensic methods employed in a congnitive interview that are essential for exploring her recollections.  Moreover, in her testimony, Ford stated she hired the lawyers AFTER the letter and the call to the newspaper.
@RdbReal @redsteeze As pointed out by Rachel Mitchell during the hearing, 5-minute segments on TV in front of 21 senators is NOT the same thing as a cognitive interview that uses forensic methods to fully explore her recollections.  FBI are experts, NOT Senators. NOT the same, AT ALL.
@RdbReal @lpinneo @redsteeze Because the FBI are experts in investigation. Senators with a partisan agenda and a desire to be re-elected are NOT. They also want their client to be interviewed properly, as they requested PRIOR to the hearing.  Agreeing to the hearing was only a concession. You don't remember?
@RdbReal @redsteeze Just because a foreign agent worked for her doesn't mean she was implicated in it.  They are two ENTIRELY different things.  Yes, facts do matter.  Just because you don't like her, doesn't make her a traitor.
@lpinneo @RdbReal @redsteeze They want the FBI to interview Ford, because -- as pointed out by Mitchell in the hearing -- 5-minute segments in front of 21 senators IS NOT a cognitive interview where her recollections might be accurately assessed.  FBI are experts in investigations, Senators on TV are NOT.
@lpinneo @RdbReal @redsteeze They don't run the show, they represent their client.  The FBI investigation is so that all of the facts, and the evidence, can be reviewed and analyzed by law enforcement professionals, not partisans interested in promoting their agenda and winning elections.
@lpinneo @RdbReal @redsteeze As the legal representatives of Dr. Ford, they certainly have input on whether their client, the ACCUSER, should have a comprehensive interview, by the FBI, related to her allegations, and NOT a political shitshow in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
@RdbReal @redsteeze Are you suggesting Feinstein knew and actively participated in espionage against the United States?  Do you have evidence of this?  Facts matter.
@RdbReal @redsteeze My understanding is that Ford's attorneys have indicated they will turn over all relevant materials to the FBI when they contact Ford.  The FBI has not.  That's not the same as refusing to turn it over, as has been suggested.  They want EXPERT analysis, not partisan attacks.
@RdbReal @redsteeze Lot's of "what ifs", but no facts.  Feinstein has stated she and her office did not release anything.  Are you suggesting she is lying?  Do you have evidence of this?  Are you suggesting Katz was not really representing her client?  Do you have evidence of that?  Facts matter.
@FreeBeacon Yes, to CLARIFY because Kavanaugh was using it as a defense. "it is refuted by the very people she says were there....Refuted.”  NOT refuted, just not confirmed.  Two ENTIRELY different things, and Keyser was being informed of this.
@Kokomothegreat My bloop pressure has been a little high too...
@BrentBozell @TimJGraham Yes, when someone is accused of attempted rape, the coverage of that will generally relate that the person has been accused of attempted rape.  That is factual reporting.
@tbfiii @Heminator 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@redsteeze Considering that Katz is Ford's attorney, it seems that communication between her and Ford's senator (to whom she sent the letter) would be expected.
@tbfiii @Heminator That is LITERALLY what I just said about you.  But nice witty come back...  Good job, Timmy...
@redsteeze Yes, to CLARIFY because Kavanaugh was using it as a defense. "it is refuted by the very people she says were there....Refuted.”  NOT refuted, just not confirmed.  Two ENTIRELY different things, and Keyser was being informed of this.
@tbfiii @Heminator If you are content in your clear partisanship AND ignorance, then who am I to suggest otherwise?
@irondoctorDC @WilkowMajority And why do you keep insinuating that I care "what the left wants".  I care about accurately representing FACTS.  The Alaska Bar Association states in the first line of their front page they have over 4000 members.  That's all.
@irondoctorDC @WilkowMajority It's not my number.  From the home page of the Alaska Bar association: "The Alaska Bar Association has over 4,000 members."  First line. Their words, not mine.  I also said many of those may not be actively practicing or may be retired.
@SnidePrince @dcexaminer I've been to a number of small AND large gatherings where I did not know and likely will never remember some of the people there.  Especially 36 years later.  A lot of people I met casually in many circumstances I have no memory of ever meeting. What's your point?
@tbfiii @Heminator Can't be proven and fabricated are two entirely different things.  Do you have something that you remember from 30+ years ago that you know is true, but you cannot PROVE it? If you say it is true, did you then FABRICATE it? Inconsistencies are consistent with trauma victims. FACT
@carr_laura @Heminator Umm...I wasn't referring to me.  I was referring to the WSJ reporting and the inaccuracy of the claim being made by partisan right-wing media.  According to WSJ, McLean approached Keyser because BK was falsely claiming she REFUTED Fred's testimony. To CLARIFY the statement.
@seanmdav @JesseKellyDC You mean someone with vast experience in witness statements advised her friend that Kavanaugh and his supporters were claiming she REFUTED Ford's testimony and advised she might need to issue a clarification?  Yeah, not the same thing as suborning perjury.  And "fabrications"?
@dcexaminer According to the WSJ reporting, she was advised to clarify because Kavanaugh and his supporters were claiming she REFUTED Ford's allegations.  Nowhere has she stated such a thing.
@irondoctorDC @WilkowMajority I am misleading no one.  Your comment, if accurate, illustrates that there are INDEED "100s of female attorneys in Alaska" as @WilkowMajority questioned.  What is misleading?  And what does Harry Reid have to do with ANYTHING?
@linda_clermont @WilkowMajority Fact: There were dozen's of potential witnesses they could have interviewed but didn't.  Including Ford and Kavanaugh.	Fact: Two of the names were alleged attackers.	Fact: What people put on a form is not always the complete story.	Fact: People can fear something and still do it.
@blcartwright @bennyjohnson This IDEA is being floated by The Daily Caller and other partisan right-wing media outlets. You think they are not trying to impeach Ford's credibility? I see someone with expertise in witness statements telling her friend hers might need clarification. That is "huge"? Not to me.
@irondoctorDC @WilkowMajority Ok.  Are you claiming they are lying about their membership?  Those are their numbers, not mine.  Also may include people who are not currently practicing law or retired, but YES, the Alaska Bar states they have over 4000 members.
@WilkowMajority It has to do with his nomination if he LIED about it, @WilkowMajority.
@blcartwright @bennyjohnson Still doesn't make it the "vast left-wing" or "deep state" conspiracy that right-wing media is trying to paint it as.  That's just partisanship, and readers should understand that.
@blcartwright @bennyjohnson Because it is bad optics for Dems, probably nothing more.  The issue probably came up during the course of the interview, because the FBI WOULD ask if anyone had approached her about her statement.  FBI would have requested the information.
@bennyjohnson NOT huge.  She was asked to clarify her statements, because it was being falsely used to exonerate Kavanaugh, by saying she REFUTED Ford.  "it is refuted by the very people she says were there....Refuted.” -Judge Kavanaugh
@WilkowMajority Alaska Bar Association has over 4000 members.  https://t.co/GIhYZhGNLS
@stockdemons @thehill Alaska Bar Association has over 4000 members.  https://t.co/GIhYZhYpas
@Itsjustanillus @thehill @TeaPainUSA Alaska Bar Association has over 4000 members.  https://t.co/GIhYZhYpas
@witty_blonde @thehill Alaska Bar Association has over 4000 members.  https://t.co/GIhYZhYpas
@KateBennett_DC @FLOTUS Well, they ARE orange...
@Heminator Yes, to CLARIFY because Kavanaugh was using it as a defense. "it is refuted by the very people she says were there....Refuted.”  NOT refuted, just not confirmed.  Two ENTIRELY different things, and Keyser was being informed of this.
@SweetieWalker @NoahCRothman @AYTYTD1 There has been little criticism of Kavanaugh for his current drinking habits. That is a Republican talking point. The criticism of Kavanaugh is for his lies, related to his HS/Yale drinking habits, because temperament/credibility, and whether he was "blackout drunk" at parties.
@toddeherman @CNN @CNNPolitics Do you actually read the articles you post, @toddeherman?  First, this is an article from CNN International, about a British woman, and it only references the UK.  It was published under @cnnhealth, NOT @CNNPolitics.  Who is trying to influence election turnout here?  Not CNN...
@amber_athey Eh, not really.  If market share demographics from the 2016 election are consistent, your numbers are meaningless. https://t.co/SJoY6WTqsc
@JRoy777 @Heminator Their potential (and apparent) political motivation for the timing of the release is COMPLETELY irrelevant to the process.  The politics on both sides are clear, and the Republicans are, and have been, trying to rush this nomination through to confirmation prior to November 6.
@JRoy777 @Heminator This is new, credible derogatory information.  Any time new, credible derogatory information is presented, it is the duty of the relevant agency (in this case, the White House) to add the derogatory information to the SF-86, which is then reopened by the FBI to investigate.
@JRoy777 @Heminator Moreover, if there were a real, credible investigation into Dr. Ford's and other's allegations, where are the detailed reports of their findings?  Where are their records of who they contacted and what leads they followed into discovering ALL of the facts?
@JRoy777 @Heminator I never said anything about a criminal investigation.  The FBI is the agency of record for ALL federal background checks and security clearances.  An investigation run by the party who is nominating the candidate is NOT a credible investigation.
@JRoy777 @Heminator Sorry, but that is not how FBI background checks work, and THEY are the agency of record for ALL federal background checks.
@JRoy777 @Heminator I'm sorry, but when and by whom was their testimony sworn?  What law enforcement officials have explored these allegations in the accomplishment of a background check?  What facts have been followed and what facts discovered in the course of an official FBI investigation?
@Heminator Refuted and unverifiable by whom?  A proper investigation has not been conducted, and is being intentionally avoided because the "timing" is not friendly to the majority party.  The RIGHT thing to do is allow the relevant investigatory body (FBI) to do just that: Investigate.
@DanaBashCNN @sarasidnerCNN It was foolish.
@KrisParonto @CNN @facebook @fbnewsroom @cnnbrk @cnni @CNNPolitics Ummm...I'm pretty sure that is what they commonly refer to as reporting.  Follow leads, call people who may have information about the leads, research documentary and other evidence.  Those are just basic investigative practices.  Certainly nothing unethical.
@cheryl_schantz @KrisParonto @maziehirono @SenFeinstein Sorry, but your inability to recognize this is a decision they likely made TOGETHER, is absurd. They have young children who have been forced from their home and subjected to an impossible process. Their decision for their father to remain with their children should be respected.
@cheryl_schantz @KrisParonto @maziehirono @SenFeinstein It is certainly NOT "a fair question."  It is an insidious, disingenuous attempt to insinuate that there is marital discord related to her allegations, and a cowardly attempt at maligning her credibility.
@toddeherman @JohnJHarwood @Palinspired This information was not KNOWN to the FBI during the previous investigations.  Whether true or not, this is new, credible derogatory information.  Regardless of political motivations or timing, these allegations should be investigated.
@cheryl_schantz @KrisParonto @maziehirono @SenFeinstein I don't think that is -- or should be -- anyone's business but theirs. According to reports, this is a process that has forced them to move out of their home and presumably into a hotel. I don't think anyone should be questioning their motive for their decision. It's disingenuous
@KrisParonto @maziehirono @SenFeinstein How is it even a RELEVANT question, much less a "good" one?  There are a number of reasons he may not be present, INCLUDING caring for their two young children who are surely in school.  Mrs. Kavanaugh LIVES in the D.C. area.  Mr. Ford lives in the Bay area in California.
@mollyhc @peterelkind My immediate reaction when he said that, WITHOUT knowing her history:  STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!
@TCribby @toddeherman The Democrat's political motivations are clear, but so are the Republican's. They are trying to rush this through because they do not believe they can confirm him after the election. REGARDLESS of whether the Dems take control. Irrelevant. These allegations should be investigated
@toddeherman The investagatory body responsible for background check, INCLUDING new derogatory information, IS the FBI.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has neither the resources, nor the mandate, for this.  An FBI report would present ALL the facts, from EVERY source.
@toddeherman I'm pretty sure the hearings, including what witnesses are subpoaened, are controlled by the majority.  Background checks, including investigating new derogatory information such as sexual assault allegations, are the responsibility of the FBI, NOT the committee.
@toddeherman Which "EVERY person Dr. Ford said would corroborate" have been interviewed by the FBI related to these events, or in other sworn testimony?  THAT is the relevance of an FBI investigation, not to mention their resources to follow all the rabbit trails to learn EVERY fact.
Judge Kavanaugh is ABSOLUTELY lying about the FBI's role in the investigation process. The FBI would conduct a THOROUGH investigation into ALL the facts from EVERY source to find the COMPLETE story. The Senate Judiciary Committee has neither the resources nor the mandate for that
@toddeherman Didn't Kavanaugh first interrupt Leahy...twice?  Perhaps I missed the part of Ford testimony where she did the same.
@FreeBeacon I'm pretty sure the prosecutor's name is Rachel Mitchell...
@toddeherman @SenFeinstein When someone has a security clearance and new derogatory information is discovered, the investigation into their clearance is reopened. Without outside derogatory information in evidence, the information provided by the applicant in their SF-86 is the basis for the investigation.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty The constant mortar attacks, ambushes, and other combat activity I was involved with in Iraq was tough to deal with, but nowhere near the trauma of being a first responder to the UN bombing in Baghdad on 8/19/2003, mopping gallons of blood, dozens dead, disfigured, dismembered.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty So you are equating an incident of someone punching you on a playground with attempted rape?  Care to continue fashioning the casket your absurd opinion belongs in?
@MattWolking @trumps_feed How is that relevant?  It is certainly NOT exculpatory.  If anything, it makes her statement that it WAS NOT Garrett even more credible.
@qhardy @LindseyGrahamSC It does seem quite hypocritical to attack her testimony for being uncorroborated, while simultaneously refusing to call for an FBI investigation. The politics on BOTH sides of this are clear, but that should not influence the decision to investigate NEW derogotory information.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty Moreover, your assertion that "she just goes up and says “hi” to someone who had her “fearing for her life”" is factually incorrect.  Rewatch the testimony.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty Then you must certainly understand that the way one 15 year old acts in ANY circumstance is not necessarily consistent with how another 15 year old may act.  Now add to that a traumatic experience, and faced with someone they are terrified of, that increases reliability? Absurd.
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy You DON'T have the right to do anything you want with the ballot.  If voting is compulsory, you don't have the right to not go to a polling place where you would receive the ballot, and you don't have the right to discard the ballot if it is mailed to you.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty Are you saying ALL 15-year-olds are consistent in the ways that they act when faced with someone/something they fear? If so, it seems very clear to me that you have neither BEEN nor KNOWN a 15-year-old.  Also, the FBI is the agency of record in federal background investigations.
@Offendeddude @LarryOConnor @MZHemingway From the totality of her testimony, the dating and 4 TO 5 other parties where Kavanaugh was present occurred PRIOR to the assault.  She also stated clearly she only saw their common friend infrequently, following the assault.
@NRO @jackrcrowe You can't figure out that someone who already has a fear of flying might be PARTICULARLY fearful if that flying was for the purpose of facing a terrifying experience?  You cannot possibly concede that might require additional time to prepare for the flight?
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty How is that relevant to something she says occurred 6-8 weeks AFTER the incident?  Moreover, additional facts would likely be forthcoming if the FBI were permitted to conduct an investigation.
@jaketapper @amyklobuchar If I had to guess, I would say they were trying to establish that Ford MAY have been medicated during the polygraph, skewing the results.  That is the problem with conspiracy theories:  They lack facts.
@pbump Who is Timmy?  Where did he live? Is the layout of his home consistent with Ford's testimony?  All things the FBI could legitimately investigate if they were involved.
@bradcundiff @KellenDunk @pbump @ktumulty How is that relevant?  The hearing is the first time she has spoken publicly about the incident.  It seems likely that there would be details related to the incident that would not be publicly known before she publicly spoke.
@CheriJacobus I think they could have been trying to establish that she may have been medicated during the polygraph, skewing the results.  Clearly, they were not aware that Ford was ALREADY in the area and that the polygraph was conducted PRIOR to her flight.
@DLoesch Umm...According to Ford, she was in Maryland for her grandmother's funeral.  The test was timed to accomodate her pervious schedule.  She DID come to testify, as is clearly evidenced by her presence in Washington D.C. for the hearing, and NOT in California.  What's your point?
@DailyCaller According to her attorney, she was not aware of the "gang rapes" at the time she attended.  Perhaps not until her own experience with being assaulted at one of the parties, I would imagine.
@Kokomothegreat While it is not a criminal prosecution, it seems to me the Sixth Amendment applies here.  Just as important as her right to be heard is his right to completely understand the charges against him.  How is that reconciled if he cannot see her testimony?
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Should it be taken figuratively?  If it can be argued that speech can be taken figuratively, then is it really a right?
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy How do the pollsters know to sign off your name?
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Voting, on the other hand, is an enumerated right (14th and 15th amendments).  If one has the right TO do something, they also have the right NOT to do it.
@SeeYouAroundKid @james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy It is not simply "attendance".  How is one to know if a voter attended, if the voter did not speak?
@james_eoghan @SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Jury duty is connected to rights of citizens secured in the 5th, 6th, and 7th amendments.  If the government must provide a jury of peers, then it must be permitted to require jurors to appear.
@SeeYouAroundKid @james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy That is still being litigated, and it is messy because its mandate was attempted within the existing economic structure of our health insurance/provider industry.
@SeeYouAroundKid @james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy You described laws that require something else other than being born. I am not REQUIRED to do those things if I do not meet the CONDITIONS for their requirements. Compulsory voting laws apply legal requirements based on nothing else but birth. THAT is unconstitutional, unmadated.
@SeeYouAroundKid @james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Everyone that is born is required by law to obtain a driver's license, pay child support, and own factories which produce carbon emissions?
@SeeYouAroundKid @james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Really?  Tell me of a law in the United States that requires speech based on nothing else but being born, that does not have a constitutional mandate (i.e. taxation, raising an army).
@james_eoghan @RaphaSV13 @SeeYouAroundKid @briebriejoy It doesn't matter how accommodating the process is, there is still an action required which has a legal penalty for not taking.  It still requires speech, and that is unconstitutional.
@RaphaSV13 So again, unless Congress is willing to invoke the Article V process for proposing consititutional amendments, then it is simply not possible.
@RaphaSV13 It is not making you fill the form that is the violation.  It is the penalty for NOT filling the form.  There are programs that are required because of constitutional mandates (SSN/TIN for taxation and Selective Service for raising an army), but there is no mandate to vote.
@realDonaldTrump Go to bed, Mr. President.
@RaphaSV13 The fact that there ARE sanctions for those who choose to not participate is what would violate our First Amendment.  Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  Freedom TO speak is also freedom to NOT speak.
@RaphaSV13 I changed no definitions.  Are you suggesting that compulsory voting laws are NOT laws that require citizens to vote?  If Brazil is your example, their laws stripping rights from citizens who do not vote would certainly be unconstitutional in the United States.
@RaphaSV13 According to our laws, it DOES violate freedom of speech. It is not a law unless it CAN be enforced, and any enforcement of REQUIRING citizens to speak is ethically no different than the enforcement of a law that LIMITS speech. If one can be legally justified, so can the other.
@RaphaSV13 @SeeYouAroundKid @briebriejoy I made no such implication.  But our laws ARE governed by our constitution.  Your flippant dismissals will not change that.
@RaphaSV13 @SeeYouAroundKid @briebriejoy So unless Congress is willing to invoke Article V, and propose constitutional amendments that fundamentally change the liberties secured for us in our Constitution, then it is simply not possible.
@RaphaSV13 @SeeYouAroundKid @briebriejoy It's very nice that it has worked out for you in Brazil, but that does not change the fact that in the United States, according to OUR constitution, Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  It doesn't matter how enforceable it is, making the law is prohibited.
@RaphaSV13 @SeeYouAroundKid @briebriejoy @briebriejoy is advocating compulsory voting.  By definition, compulsory voting would force one to vote.  Congress making a law forcing citizens to vote is a violation of the First Amendment.		compulsory	ADJECTIVE	1 Required by law or a rule; obligatory.	https://t.co/ZIVS0yXd85
@KenGardner11 How so?  Kavanaugh has made specific statements related to the nature of his activities and priorities while in HS and at Yale.  How is it "low" for people with information to the contrary to say so? Are his supporters also "low"?  They have also spoken...
@SeeYouAroundKid @RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy Nah?  How do you force citizens to vote while not curtailing their freedom of speech?  Freedom includes both the right TO act and the right NOT to act.
@RaphaSV13 @briebriejoy I was thinking of the part that says "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech."  Kinda shoots down the compulsory voting idea...
@briebriejoy You are aware of the first amendment, right?
@roddreher Because if you are confronted with your 17-year-old loutish drunken behavior and you LIE about it, then that speaks to your character as a 53-year-old judge.
@cainfam22 @JackPosobiec Hillary and Barack aren't the President of the United States.  But let's be honest here.  Trump has not stopped attacking Hillary and Barack since he was a candidate, nor even slowed down.  They've shown much restraint in comparison.  Facts are facts.
@joshtpm It seems to me that would be a catalyst for impeachment proceedings against the president.  Multiple pardons to facilitate perjury would certainly be considered a high crime.
@ShannonJoyRadio @dcexaminer This is not an opinion piece from @dcexaminer, they are promoting it as NEWS.  The only problem?  They neglect to mention and completely ignore the fact that a Republican victory is not guarunteed, if not unlikely.
@MichaelRWarren @MZHemingway Why does it seem like critics of the Mueller investigation are pretending that is not ALREADY the way our justice system operates?
@MichaelRWarren @MZHemingway If law enforcement officials discover an uncharged crime, don't they ALREADY have an ethical, if not legal, obligation to investigate that crime?  And if they discover sufficient evidence, to refer it for prosecution? /1

@Frederico_69 @RobProvince @peterelkind Right, because instead of going home after a long day, she decided to go to the apartment directly below hers and kill the resident of that apartment.  Because that would facilitate her need to rest, right? Have you ever heard of Occam's razor?
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind When it happened to me, it took a minute or so to realize I was on the wrong floor.  Keys didn't work, I banged on the door and shouted to my wife with no answer.  Finally, I figured out I got off on the third floor instead of the fifth.
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind In an apartment building where everything looks the same from floor to floor, it is an easy mistake to make, especially if you are tired.  And EVEN if you are someone who is well trained to notice things that are unusual.  His apartment was directly below hers, I believe.
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind What I see here is a conflation of her position as a law enforcement officer, and her actions of getting off on the wrong floor and believing she was actually entering her home.  Have you ever mistakenly tried to enter a residence that was not yours?  I have.
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind What I am opposed to is characterizing her entering that apartment as a break-in or a home invasion.  If that is what is determined, based on the FACTS, then she should certainly be held accountable.  But declaring it without facts is unjust, for EVERYONE involved.
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind I am certainly NOT trying to find a reason to lift the blame from her.  She entered a residence that did not belong to her and she killed someone in the process.  She should certainly be held accountable for that. /1
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind What you are espousing is a lynch mob mentality.  String her up because the victim and his family deserve justice, right?  The problem is that you are describing revenge, not justice. Justice is finding the truth, whatever it is, and holding the accused accountable for only THAT.
@Sdunigan @exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind No, it's fact-based reasoning, and it is what every person, regardless of their status or position, has a right to.  When she entered the apartment, what was her state of mind? This is not excusing her action in killing someone.  The justice system will determine that. /1
@JAgent9 @whackadoojones It's not their overall intent.  It is their intent relative to the crime they are charged with committing.
@JAgent9 @whackadoojones Absolutely.  They may be seeking asylum, or they may be victims of human trafficking.  If they entered with the intent of violating 8 USC 1325 (a petty offense, by the way), then yes, that would establish corrupt intent.
@JAgent9 @whackadoojones That's not something that has been established.  She entered an apartment that was not hers.  Illegality requires corrupt intent, in most cases.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind Either way, being on the outside of the one way out puts you in a position of control.  Very likely an armed burglar would understand that and surrender.  If not, backup is on the way.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind At that point, it's a standoff and backup is already coming.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind And if you are in the doorway, cover is close if the person comes out shooting (blindly, by the way)
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind I specifically said you wouldn't rush in.  But banging on the door and shouting might draw the person out because they likely aren't expecting company and most likely are not armed.  In that situation, an armed, uniformed (?) LEO would inspire that burglar to kiss carpet.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind I am, of course, speaking to her apparent state of mind, not the fact that it actually WASN'T her home.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind According to her affidavit, it wasn't a "dwelling", it was her home.  Are you telling me that all LEOs who face threats to their own lives or property off duty fall back and call for backup?  If so, you are incredibly misinformed.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind Like I said, if armed, I like my chances.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind Now what are the chances of that 1.4% that the person facing those multiple armed burglars is an armed, trained law enforcement officer.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind I'd be interested in what percentage of that 7% is multiple armed burglars -- in an apartment.  I'd imagine 10% is generous, so let's say 20%.  That's 1.4% of burgaries where a person might face multiple armed burglars.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind A structure that has only one entrance is similar to having a hilltop.  There is only one avenue of approach, and a trained person can manage multiple adversaries.  However, according to BJS, only 7% of burglars are armed.  https://t.co/p0IecZuy8Y
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind I agree, but I also understand that when it is your own -- or you THINK it is your own -- property, it can change your thinking.  The right of a citizen to protect their own property is something that runs deeper than training, so we can't say something is certain.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind Which might mean banging on the door and shouting in the hall.  If witnesses were in their apartments, and not in the hall, the veracity of what they recall is pretty spotty.
@exfogcity @RobProvince @peterelkind It was an apartment, so unless it is on the first floor, it's likely one way in, one way out. If armed, I like my chances. You wouldn't want to go barging in, but if trained that's an advantageous situation. I'd still call for help, but would also try to assess the situation.
@whackadoojones You're right, there is new information that calls her affidavit into dispute.  It still doesn't make it a break in.  There are no facts that establish that.
@brendanredacted @RobProvince @peterelkind It does look like there is new information since I last read about it.  It still doesn't make it a "break in" or a "home invasion".  That ASSUMES a lot of information we don't HAVE.  Looking over recent reports, there is still nothing that indicates corrupt intent.
@RobProvince @peterelkind Well, she didn't EXACTLY break into his home.  The door was ajar and she thought it was her home.  That doesn't make it any less tragic, so let's stick to facts...
@deadrody @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews You've already demonstrated your lack of integrity, so I wouldn't expect you to hold yourself to your own standard.  @toddeherman and apparently your standard is that if it is called a "comment", it is a lie, fake news.  WaPo called it a comment.  Come on, where's your outrage?
@JoeFree76 @CarterFliptMe @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Doesn't matter.  If a media outlet you don't like uses a word you can twist as a reason to attack, regardless of what they are actually saying, it is "fake news".

@CarterFliptMe @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Sorry, but that makes absolutely NO sense. If you read the article, they provide a complete account of both sides and in fact, lead the reader to the obvious conclusion that the attacks against Kavanaugh are not warranted.  But they are using "disinformation" in the title? Absurd
@CarterFliptMe @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Who's playing word games here?  It is his comment describing their position.  No one from CNN -- and certainly not I -- has asserted it was his POSITION.  But it was a COMMENT about THEIR position.  This is not word games, it is the plain, ordinary use of the English language.
@afternoonsand @realBobWoodward @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie "Woodward said he had multiple sources for every claim in the book."  You can believe him or not, that's your right.  But your BELIEF that he is lying doesn't mean he is lying.  @realBobWoodward isn't some hack, he's probably the most respected journalist alive.
@bourbasted @realBobWoodward @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie If you take the above tweet and this one in concert, it's a pretty clear deduction. https://t.co/DGWxbPnc9m
@bourbasted @realBobWoodward @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie So yes, there is some inference there, but logically deduced.
@bourbasted @realBobWoodward @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie Can't read it until tomorrow, so I don't know what extent he describes who was in the room, or just who was participating in the conversation. It is likely that some witnessed the conversation but did not participate, but also likely from participants, if using multiple sources.
@deadrody @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Facts are facts.  Whether you agree with me or not is irrelevant.  By any OBJECTVE standard, Kavanaugh's reply to Cruz can reasonably be characterized as a comment.  By any OBJECTIVE standard, comment is not a 'loaded' word.  Saying otherwise is just partisan nonsense.
@realBobWoodward @TODAYshow @SavannahGuthrie There is a point to be made here.  The only thing anonymous in this is which of the participants were the sources of the conversation.  Bob has stated he has multiple sources for each thing he talks about, so if he says who is there, the sources are listed, just not which ones.
@deadrody @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Kamala Harris is not mentioned in the article.  The scrutiny they describe in the article is from Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights.  https://t.co/ywmtmCE3Mm
@deadrody @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews It's televised, so I'm sure people can judge for themselves how they feel, regardless of how Harris characterizes it.  The title doesn't qualify the scrutiny, that's what the ARTICLE is for.  However, illegitimate scrutiny is still scrutiny.  There is nothing inaccurate there.
@CarterFliptMe @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews He is not quoting anything.  He is paraphrasing their position in his own words.  That is a comment.  Your ad hominem does nothing to support your position by the way, and I am certainly NOT partisan.  If anything, I am ANTI-partisan.
@MattGenelin @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews They did not say 'assertion', 'belief', 'position' or any other word that carries an implication that HE is characterizing all contraceptives as "abortion-inducing drugs".  They said 'comment'.
@MattGenelin @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews The article is ~650 words, but they are being accused of "fake news" because of one ACCURATE word that someone doesn't like in a 7-word title?  Come on, that's absurd.  Moreover, 'comment' is a pretty benign word, in ANY context.  You're grasping at partisan straws here...
@MattGenelin @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews If he were quoting, and not paraphrasing in his commentary, he would have used the exact words of those he was paraphrasing.  Some partisans are saying it is his position.  CNN does not do that.  They provide the facts, IN THE ARTICLE.
@MattGenelin @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews It is not misleading.  It leads no one anywhere, except to facts.  Kavanaugh was commenting about a case he decided. He used the term, and he faced scrutiny. The title does not imply he agrees with the characterization of partisans who attacked him for it. https://t.co/K6GMdzPjfi
@CarterFliptMe @toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews "It was a technical matter of filling out a form.  In that case, they said filling out the form would make them complicit in the provision of the abortion-inducing drugs that they were as a religious matter objected to."  This is a comment, not a quote. https://t.co/KQvMt4YivA
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews He was quoting during an explanation of a position he took in a case he decided.  Certainly, that can be accurately described as "commentary".
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews You tweeted that to Stelter, who had nothing to do with the article, using it as evidence of CNN being fake news.  So I know exactly where you got your information.  From Fox News, via "Fuzzy Slippers".  Clearly partisan and clearly NOT interested in FACTS.

You originally linked an article from a blog that took a tweet from a Fox News personality as evidence of CNN's "race to the bottom".
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews Show me the lie in "Kavanaugh 'abortion-inducing drug' comment draws scrutiny"
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews The headline doesn't say he took a position.  The headline say he commented.  A comment is not a position, or a belief, it means he SAID it
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews That is not bigotry, that is FACT.  Something you could use some more of, instead of forgoing intelligent conversation for flaming and ad hominem.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 6) They provide NO disclaimers, verbally or on screen that their opinion hosts are not providing news, may not even be providing facts, and MAY IN FACT be lying to their viewers.  And there is ZERO accountability for their hosts to tell the truth.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 5) As for Fox News, you need to take your partisan goggles off.  That network lies repeatedly, they have a clear partisan agenda, they ACTUALLY promote fake news, and they make no clear distinction between News and Opinion shows.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 4) But just because you don't like the way they did something does not make them fake news.  That is partisanship.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 3) The unintelligence or ignorance or apathy of readers to not read beyond a headline or a tweet is no one's responsibility but the readers.  Headlines can be misleading, yes.  BUT THEY ARE ONLY HEADLINES.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 2) Anyone who ACTUALLY READS the article should have enough FACTS to deduce that Harris and those she was representing with her questions were NOT being honest. The authors gave PLENTY of evidence so it was very clear that Kavanaugh was not saying what they claimed he was saying.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper @FoxNews 1) Where is the lie? "Kavanaugh 'abortion-inducing drug' comment draws scrutiny"  Whether he was quoting someone or not, he discussed it, hence he commented on it.  It CERTAINLY drew scrutiny.  And IN THE ARTICLE, they explain both sides and inform their reader of the facts.
@toddeherman @CNNPolitics @brianstelter @CNN @jaketapper Did you actually read the article, or are you just regurgitating what some partisan on @FoxNews told you?  If you read the article, @CNN clearly provides both sides of the story, and makes no conclusions.  That's not fake news, that is factual reporting. https://t.co/ywmtmCE3Mm
This is why @realBobWoodward's book can't be attacked by the @WhiteHouse like previous books.  Woodward has extensive interviews transcribed and likely coded, with multiple sources for everything he wrote.  This was a carefully and thoroughly researched ethnography. https://t.co/DGWxbPnc9m
@Hambonee03 @Dardan__B @CanesinceDay1 He gave up because she picked up the gun.
@jacobsoboroff I think what the author is suggesting is that, as bad as we think it has been, it would have been far, far worse.  I think they still failed in their ultimate duty to those who pay their checks -- US.  But the implication is that far worse would have occurred.
@TimJGraham One does not have to be a "lefty" to recognize the importance of slavery in the founding of this country.  It is explicitly provided for in the Constitution, or have you forgotten?  We have changed, and thank God for that.  But that does not change historical fact.
@EdKrassen @ChuckGrassley Let's just acknowledge this for what it is:  a 'gotcha' moment in an attempt to stall the confirmation process.  It's partisanship.  I get it, and if Dems succeed, good for them.  But let's not pretend this is some massive breach of ethics or the law by Kavanaugh.
@EdKrassen @ChuckGrassley The only wayt I could tell you what I said in an email is based on policy and training.  I know what I would say about a certain subject because it is consistent.  A particular exchange or a conversation with someone on a particular day?  Not a chance.  No clue at all.
@EdKrassen @ChuckGrassley I think perjury is a bit extreme.  When I worked at the VA, managers could get as many as 500 emails a day.  I wonder how many emails a WH lawyer or heaven forbid, the staff secretary received.  If you asked me about an email or a conversation I had, I would have no clue.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/tUuh5DTzSG
@charliespiering More politics of fear...
@TimJGraham Psst...America WAS founded on slavery and genocide of Native Americans.  Pretending it didn't happen doesn't make it false, and acknowledging the truth doesn't make one less American OR patriotic.  Facts are facts.

@Slate Trump aides have no power to do anything but resign.  Removal of the President, through any Constitutional means, REQUIRES action from Congress.  The ultimate responsibility in checking the Article II body rests with the Article I body.  Any suggestion otherwise is simply false.
@butternugget42 @vlmadden @BillKristol I am certainly not enabling anyone or giving them cover.  I have made my postitions regarding the current administration VERY clear.  Partisanship IS ignorantly accusing someone of being on the OTHER 'side' if they are not clearly and unquestioningly on YOUR 'side'
@TaniaWalker Now I hate you...damnit! 🤣🤣🤣
@WaywardWinifred Except that's not what he says in the email.  He says he isn't sure that all legal scholars believe it is settled law.  He DOESN'T say HE doesn't believe it is settled law.
@butternugget42 @vlmadden @BillKristol The "view" is that partisanship/tribalism is bullshit; it's destructive and counterproductive, it ONLY leads to more division, and it perpetuates extremism.  Moreover, it -- more than anything else -- will lead to the eventual demise of this great republic.
@vlmadden @BillKristol I don't think that was the point of the op-ed

@jaynordlinger It seems to me that it's a shot across the WH bow after their reactions to the @realBobWoodward book excerpts.  I think it was timed, and that it was done in the NYT intentionally.  Did @realDonaldTrump 's Deep Throat just write an op-ed?  "Hey, I'm here, and not just me..."

@jdawsey1 Wouldn't it be something if Sarah Sanders was the anonymous writer?
@evanscottolson @emptywheel Because the precedent deals with cases that were analogous, but not precise matches.  Nixon and Jefferson were regarding documentary evidence and the Clinton subpoena was withdrawn because he agreed to testify.  So it isn't settled law, thus the hypothetical.
@evanscottolson @emptywheel Because it is not a hypothetical.  Yes, as a matter of law, people CAN be subpoenaed. Moreover, the so-called "Ginsburg rule" relates to nominees answering hypothetical questions regarding issues they may have to hear in SCOTUS.  General subpoena power is not one of those issues.
@Dsquared75 @emptywheel So, in his opinion, four decisions of the Court rise above the rest.  1) Civil rights 2) The role of SCOTUS in overturning unconstitutional laws, EOs, etc 3) The executive cannot seize private property without constitutional authority 4) legal accountability of POTUS
@evanscottolson @emptywheel Clearly, they can.  Asking that would be superfluous.
@emptywheel @Dsquared75 Yes
@Dsquared75 @emptywheel He said it was, in his opinion, one of the four most important decisions the Court had ever made.  Together with Brown and two others I missed.
@emptywheel Except that's not what he said.  He said he would talk about US v. Nixon, but would not engage in a hypothetical concerning an issue he may have to hear, if confirmed.
@fred_guttenberg I understand it must feel like being snubbed, but if Kavanaugh is confirmed, he may have to hear a case related to Parkland.  Having a picture of him being friendly with a victim's parent may be seen as controversial.  He was probably just being cautious.
As a recovering Republican and antipartisan conservative, there is certainly no love lost between me and this administration and the Republican party in general.  However, THIS is nonsense.  I understand the frustration from Democrats, but please, just stop the nonsense. https://t.co/rgT7RW2Izs

@dlfeltham @CillizzaCNN What is clear is how little he knows about how the government works. True to his authoritarian tendencies, the president seems to think that his cabinet heads control every facet of their respective departments. Federal employees are duty bound to uphold the constitution, not him
@KurtSchlichter Interesting that you characterize the opinion of a private citizen, that has received no support from anyone, as representative of the opinions of many millions of voters.
@RandalGibbs @CillizzaCNN You shouldn't be bothered by irrelevant things such as facts... 🙄
@dlfeltham @CillizzaCNN I think the president believes the job of someone he appoints is ultimately defined by him.  He has no commitment to the constitution or the rule of law.
@CillizzaCNN I'm not surprised that he says it.  We know the character of the man.  What surprises me is the sweeping complicity of Republicans -- in politics, media, and the citizenry -- in failing to hold him accountable.  He says it because they permit it.
@LilBeanieTweets @chuckwoolery @HillaryClinton It's not difficult to grasp at all.  If you do something at work to get yourself fired, the excuse the someone else who used to work there did it too, is probably not going to save your job.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Jim Crowe laws were repealed and unfortunately, your second statement is not true.  That's why we have 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, and 24th amendments, the Civil Rights Act, among other civil rights legislation
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I'm certain that the Civil Rights Act is one law that will never be repealed.  It is the government's responsibility to ensure that all people's rights are protected.  That is the entire basis of our laws and civil society.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The federal minimum wage is a law, so it  comes from congress.  Regulations are the administration's guidelines for executing the law, and policies/manuals give federal workers instructions on how to apply the regulations, based on the laws.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I would say with the proper policy requirements by the government.  Government is there for a reason, and commerce, trade, and finance are among them.  But regulation should be smart, and without favor.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Bernie Sanders has a habit of sticking his foot in his mouth from time to time.  I would imagine anyone who ever experienced a bread line would readily tell you how bad they are.  Hunger is never good.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Proper deregulation takes the executive and legislative branches and should always be done carefully and thoughtfully.  Stripping just for the sake of stripping is bad.  Reregulation is better.  Consolidating, simplifying, streamlining, etc.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The problem is that regulations are always based in law.  So, extraneous regulations can be stripped away pretty easily, but if so much so that the law is left unapplied, then the Article 2 body has failed in their duty.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I would imagine there are some that can explain it very eloquently and saliently.  Platforms are summaries, and I would assume they have something far more detailed.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Without studying their platform more closely, my rough interpretation is that they would seek to eliminate or severely limit corporate influence on economic legislation and regulation.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The government has a lot of influence in the economy, and in turn, corporations and special interests have a lot of influence in government.  So much so, corporate/special interests are heavily embedded in our laws and regulatory system.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Not being a democrat OR a socialist, I have nothing to defend in their position.  Their platform raises a ton of questions for me, but I also won't assume they mean something they don't say.  Two completely different things.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 How they plan to achieve it is laid out in their platform.  They certainly envision an economy that shifts away from corporate control, but they also specifically reject the idea of a centralized economy, instead preferring decentralization.
@indefact @TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 in this context, order means system and in politics, system is government.  So they are saying: we are saying no to a government system that is based on private profit.  That doesn't mean they are saying no to a profit based economy.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Remember the words they used: we reject an order based on private profit.  They did not say we reject private profit.
@guilgonzalezc @charliekirk11 and North Korea is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  They are neither democratic, nor a republic, and their people are among the most opressed on earth.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 No, there is a pretty clear distinction.  It is nuanced, but nuance is very important.  If i dont like soemthing and i reject it, i turn away from it, diminish its importance.  If i abolish it, that means i destroy it.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 There is certainly talk by some of single payer, but there have been no credible proposals of it.  Credible proposals have to go beyond stump speeches, debates, and interviews, and our legislative process is very arduous.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Not exactly.  The primary definition of reject is to say no to.  Abrogate is to put an end to, and while reject and abolish are both synonyms of abrogate, reject is not a synonym in its primary form, so not synonyms of each other.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I've seen no credible proposals of taking all the "cars" away.  Just that they need to run better.  Reasonable people can have reasonable discussions of what that means.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 With that said, that doesn't necessarily mean my analysis is correct.  I am comfortable with it, but that is why analyses need discussion.  Iron sharpens iron.  In academia, we call it peer review.  It's not fun, but it's necessary.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 We aren't fighting, we are discussing.  This is what we are supposed to do.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 No, it's not the same.  Close reading is an analytical tool.  It does not add meaning, it analyzes it.  Saying they meant abolish is adding meaning.  Nothing in what I said added anything to their statement, it merely unpacked it.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 But those "buses" you refer to are part of the social safety net.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I also worked for the VA for three years.  In the VBA (benefits), but we worked very closely with the VHA (health) and NCA (cemetaries)
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The Veterans Health Adminstration is a civilian run organization.  It is not operated by the military.  There is no punishment for dissent, and the organization is very similar to civilian hospitals.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Lol.  Ok.  Fair enough.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The problem is you are ascribing something to them, not based in fact, but what YOU think they REALLY mean.  We should be held accountable for what we say and do, not what someone arbitrarily decides our "true motives" are.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 VA is not military, so Army innovations is different. What the VA has is a population that has certain factors in common, not just war, and that population has unique health markers. It's a fertile ground for research, and they do a lot of it.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Certainly not, I spent more than 2 years deployed to combat zones.  Their innovations are varied.  Electronic medical records were developed by the VA, a lot of diabetes/endocrine research, mental health certainly, cancer research.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 That's essentially what I just said.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 You have to read closely.  An order based on private profit is a SYSTEM that prioritizes private profit over everything else.  It is the BASIS for the system.  They are saying there are other factors to consider, beyond ONLY profit motive.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 What I meant was that the DSA has not called for all wealth to be redistributed so Bill Gates and the kid at McD's make the same.  If they have not done that, then assuming their position on redistribution takes that extreme, is disingenuous.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 UW has a 3.361 billion USD endowment, so there are private contributions.  I was in the anthropology department and government grants are pretty common.  Also a lot through the Gates and Clinton Foundations
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 It's a public institution.  Much of the funding for the UW Global Health department comes through PEPFAR.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 No, VA is a cabinet department.  Not part of the DoD.  I worked for the VA for three years in the Compensation Service of the Veterans Benefits Administration.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The greatest failure of ACA is it didnt address the underlying exploitative nature of the current system.  To quote Obama, they tried to put lipstick on a pig.  Had an NCO tell me once, you can only make shit shine so much.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 What they need to do is REregulate it, strip out special interests and ensure it is simple, efficient, and transparent.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Deregulation of public services is generally a bad idea.  People generally don't police themselves, and there must be accountability when it comes to PERSONAL health because that directly implicates PUBLIC health.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 As for wealth redistribution, it depends on the extreme.  Taxation for any public service is naturally redistributive.  Unless the party calls for all citizens to make equal pay, then taking that extreme is disingenuous.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I read it, but you have to read it critically.  Rejecting an ORDER based on private profit is not the same thing as calling for the ABOLISHMENT of private profit.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 My alma mater University of Washington, has developed much of the leading public/glibal health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention.  Option B+ was one of the pivotal innovations in preventing the spread of HIV, particularly in the global South
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Government run doesn't mean research dies.  Most research is government funded and takes place at public research universities, and even in the government itself.  The VA has historically been VERY innovative.  Electronic health records, for 1
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 So not VASTLY different in ideology, yet everyone only points to failed authoritarian states like Venezuela and use that as the shining example of socialism, but not, say, Denmark.  It just comes off as disingenuous to me.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Eh, I just went over their platform and I wouldn't say they want to ABOLISH profit, though they do certainly favor much stricter controls and wealth redistribution.  But that exists in these social safety net countries as well.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 But no one in Washington wants to touch that.  Fixing it may eleiminate millions of jobs.  My concern is: is it a bubble, and if so, will it burst?  If it is and it does, that's a big deal.  But how to fix it?
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 It's heavily regulated, but the regulations favor special interests that have ballooned health administration, and equally on the insurance side.  Our health administrations are massive compared to other developed countries.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The big difference in the United States is health care.  We have allowed it to remain private, and it has become roughly one sixth of our economy.  That's a big deal because much of that is exploitative.  Specifically, health insurance.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 When most free socialist countries have a system closer to Democratic Socialism.  The social safety net you referred to.  Goverment controls public services, but the larger economy is free market.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 The problem I see with discussions of socialism from much (not all) of riggt wing media is that when they say they are describing socialism, they are really describing Marxism.  Which is actually communism.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 It is, but it's an odd combination. Citizens still have relatively little personal and political freedom and the party is still the ultimate power. But they have departed from the ideology economically. Still not free, but not communist either
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Socialism exists on a spectrum, like capitalism.  Either in their purest forms can be dangerous.  Every socio-politico-economic system that is successful incorporates a number of different ideologies in order to succeed.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 None of them are purely socialist.  China is communist and that is closest, though not really the same.  Many others fly under a flag of socialism, but are really authoritarian.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I meant they are similar in size to individual US states.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Gotta be careful though.  I think I read that China took over one of Sri Lanka's ports because Sri Lanka was unable to pay.  Something like that.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Yeah, BRICS has been around for a number of years.  A lot of investment in Africa and South America where countries are trying to get away from World Bank/IMF requirements.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 It looks like authoritarian countries/repressed societies were not included on the socialism list I found.  Interesting that China was, but they are not strictly authoritarian, although Xi looks like he may be heading in that direction.
@LilBeanieTweets @chuckwoolery @HillaryClinton What does that have to do with holding Trump accountable?  We teach our children when they are toddlers that bad actions from one person does not excuse bad actions from another.  If Trump is not conducting himself in a manner befitting his office, he should be held accountable.
@LilBeanieTweets @chuckwoolery @HillaryClinton You referenced Hillary voters tacitly supporting Bill, then asked why I was not equally repulsed by Bill as Trump, so yeah, I'd say I understood what you were getting at.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Can't compare raw numbers because most European countries are similar in size and population to US states.  This is why I would never advocate for a socialist system in the US.  Too many people and too much geography. Can't work here is different than can't work anywhere, though.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Economic Freedom index from Heritage.  Sweden and Denmark are higher, Norway and Finland lower, but still in the 20s
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Incidentally, those all came from global metrics, not some obscure ranking.  Your assertion about Scandanavian countries is false.  Finlad is 3, Sweden 6 and Norway 7.  If you include Denmark, they are 2 behind China
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 I cherry picked nothing.  3 in the top 10 on the economic index.
@TheHaunt3 @torpex777 @charliekirk11 Again, simply not true. 7 of the top 10 most socialist countries are in the top 10 freest countries. 6 in the top 10 least corrupt, 6 in the 10 most democratic. Guess who's not on any of those lists.  The USA.  That's just facts, not partisanship.
@squatconspiracy @charliekirk11 Again, simply not true. 7 of the top 10 most socialist countries are in the top 10 freest countries. 6 in the top 10 least corrupt, 6 in the 10 most democratic. Guess who's not on any of those lists.  The USA.  That's just facts, not partisanship.

@torpex777 @charliekirk11 Because there is corruption in socialist countries does not mean that socialism and corruption are synonymous.  Correlation ≠ causation.  There is also corruption in non-socialist countries, and there are countries with socialist systems that are NOT plagued by corruption.
@LilBeanieTweets @chuckwoolery @HillaryClinton lost that election, remember?  So by definition, he was NOT placed back in the White House.  What you are doing is obfuscating, and it is disingenuous.

@dialex63 @La_Avion_ @charliekirk11 I have neither said, nor alluded, that "socialism is wonderful".
@dialex63 @La_Avion_ @charliekirk11 Corruption was rampant in Venezuela under both Chavez and Maduro.  THAT is what brought down Venezuela, not socialism.
@dialex63 @La_Avion_ @charliekirk11 Sorry, but what you describe is not socialism, it is authoritarianism.  As I have said previously, I am not defending socialism.  However, I do NOT accept the fallacious premise that because a country is "socialist", then everything bad that happens is SOLELY due to socialism.
@ddale8 It seems to me that if 2/3 of the Senate is required to ratify, then 2/3 of the Senate must be required to rescind.  However, that would require Article 1 and 3 bodies willing to hold him accountable.
@chuckwoolery Expecting our leaders to be honest, to NOT be corrupt, or criminal, and to conduct themselves in a manner befitting their offices, is NOT "holier than thou."
@chuckwoolery I don't think it was intended to be veiled, and in today's political climate, "establishment" is a vast improvement.
@UltimateEmpath @jdawsey1 Without Article 1 or Article 3 bodies to hold him acocuntable, that may be the case.
@jdawsey1 Is it a settled issue whether a President can unilaterally withdraw from a ratified treaty?  It seems that if a treaty requires the legislature to ratify, then it should require the legislature to rescind.
@KnippelBj @charliekirk11 First, corruption is not unique to socialism.  Second, I did not defend socialism.
@charliekirk11 That's just simply not true.  The issue with Venezuela was corruption.
@johndai81376725 @combienDUtemps @AntarianRani @ddale8 Wait, did you just call the president an asshat? 😮

@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 6) When it comes to FACTS, Rand's philosophy is axiomatic.  Something is either true or it isn't.  A is A.  There are clear contradictions in this story, and without definitive confirmation from Davis, his previous definitive denial stands.
@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 5) To quote Ayn Rand: "Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong."
@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 4) Without a direct quote in writing or on video where Davis specifically states that he was CNN's source, and in what capacity, then I question the veracity of @BuzzFeed's report that Davis was the source for CNN's reporting, specifically.
@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 3)  CNN's reporting states that Davis declined to comment.  Davis is also on the record with @andersoncooper on 8/22 and @chucktodd on 8/25 stating definitively that he was NOT a source for the CNN story.
@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 2)  Davis has said he was a source for REPORTERS, but aside from the Buzzfeed report that does not include a direct quote from Davis, I have not seen Davis say specifically, after the report from BF, that he was a source for CNN.
@SMTM2016 @MZHemingway 1) Davis said that Cohen says his testimony was truthful.  That is different than Davis saying Cohen's testimony was truthful.  That's my point.  Without an admission from his client, or his client's permission for Davis to admit it, Davis places himself in jeopardy by doing so.
Guy Lewis just said something to @donlemon that made me think.  Is it possible that Mueller handed off the Cohen prosecution to SDNY, but will be handling potential charges against @realDonaldTrump for campaign finance violations, himself? @CNNTonight
@keithboykin Wait, wasn't the Boston Globe sold by the NY Times something like 25 years ago?
@DailyCaller @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump There is quite a difference between practices OCCURING in past administrations and those practices now being EXPLOITED by the current administration.  From the article, “We’re seeing these kind of cases skyrocketing,”
@DavidAFrench Correction, that is ALL Trump voters in 2016.  % of Republican voters is likely higher.
@DavidAFrench 40% of Republican voters in 2016 election cite Fox News as their primary source of news.  There is certainly a correlation there... https://t.co/b1teHm0BzZ
@thehill Oh, to be a fly on the wall of THAT household...
I love this. https://t.co/kv1BoVgazO
@BronxLaugher @yashar Not just that, but he publicly admitted that his client committed a crime that his client had not admitted or given HIM permission to admit.  That certainly causes significant jeopardy for Davis in doing that.  Kinda had to walk it back when he was id'd as the source.
@imillhiser Had*
@MZHemingway First, the anonymous source was Cohen's lawyer.  Second, he kinda had to walk it back once it was revealed he was the source.  The comment placed him in jeopardy for disclosing his client perjured himself in front of Congress, without ad/permission from his client.
@SykesCharlie That's what happens when the Oval is unoccupied.  The moral compass is missing.
@JenniferJJacobs And McGahn is also leaving soon.  Wonder why?
President Trump escalates his use of 'politics of fear' when warning evangelical leaders of violence by Democrats if GOP loses midterms. https://t.co/xEcpb2ePPs via @indefact
@wreiddalton @jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @UdoGuengerich @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick Lingering effects only dissipate if those responsible for the injustice accept reposnsibility for them.  The United States has done little to acknowledge, much less atone for, a number of atrocities.  Its treatment of its indigenous peoples foremost among them.
Seems like @realDonaldTrump imputing his own past and current practices on others is the ultimate Trumpism. https://t.co/VaekF2M5Bu
@keithboykin The term itself is probably a variation of "monkey with", "to handle or play with (something) in a careless way", so itself not really racist.  Using the term "monkey" to describe a black person though?  Bad idea https://t.co/wyqXrNoKmD
@jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @wreiddalton @UdoGuengerich @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick So no, let's NOT talk about other examples we have little connection to and have no power to correct wrongs that still exist at the expense of the indiginous peoples of OUR nation.
@jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @wreiddalton @UdoGuengerich @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick Nice try at obfuscation, but your point falls flat.  We talk about North America because it is the example that we are most directly connected to, and which has lingering effects in our society, today.
@JenniferJJacobs People who sdon't understand the algorithms complaining that the algorithms are biased.  Makes perfect sense.  Maybe they just need to do a better job?
@NYTNational If @realDonaldTrump doesn't like so much negative news, perhaps he shouldn't create so much negative news.  Press is just reporting, they don't choose what is there to report, or at what quantities...
@whpresscorps Pretty simple equation:  If you don't want negative coverage, put a lid on the negativity coming from the Oval and your podium.
@whpresscorps Perhaps because 96% of the media outlets are ones you have categorized as 'liberal'?  Also 'conservative' media are FAR more partisan and seem to intentionally ignore news they deem unfavorable to @realDonaldTrump
@jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick I have no agenda.  I simply don't follow the point of your reply.
@LilithResists @realDonaldTrump “A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word 'darkness' on the walls of his cell.”  --C.S. Lewis
@jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick I'm asking you to explain your reply.  I don't think the British can help me with that.  Or the French, Dutch, Germans, or Spanish, for that matter...
@jehrydsuki @TElovesCanada @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick I don't follow.  Why what was necessary?  To conquer and colonize?
@Acosta @KateBennett_DC I think @realDonaldTrump's animosity stem directly from this:  @SenJohnMcCain is the kind of person Trump aspires to and hopes to be, but is wholly incapable.  McCain possessed something Trump never will:  HONOR
@PressSec @KellyannePolls @POTUS What I see there is:  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  August 27, 2018.  @SenJohnMcCain died on August 25, 2018.
@Acosta I often wonder how some will ever find employment after their service for @realDonaldTrump, outside of deeply partisan organizations.  This is the bed they are making...
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo To me, the solution is open discussion of ideas, eschewing partisanship.  We had a very useful discussion today of something we apparently had disagreements, but in the end I think both realized we had much in common, in spite of those disagreements.  THAT is democracy in action.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Disagreement is not what divides our country, pettiness is.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo You are right, but bias can be accounted for with close/critical reading/thinking.  My first criteria is:  Is it FACTUAL?  We have to start there.
@CillizzaCNN When I see RINO, I interpret it as "not partisan enough for us".  That is something I can get behind.  We NEED less partisanship in politics.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I respect that.  Remember, disagreement is the heart of democracy.  I spend a lot more time than the average person researching and thinking about this stuff and I try very hard to offer positions that disagree without being partisan.  I hope it is useful.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Indeed.  And to you as well.  It is always my intention to present independent and fact-based positions, and to have healthy conversations about the issues.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I'm generally not a big @maddow fan, but she makes some important points.  If there was a relationship between Trump and @NatEnquirer to shape public opinion for @realDonaldTrump and against @HillaryClinton, that could be major. https://t.co/O5nYhPS9qg
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Fair enough.  My position was similar.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I have a feeling if they pursue the relationship with Trump and Pecker/National Enquirer/AMI, this gets a whole lot more rotten.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Perhaps it was the talking points you were using and the arguments the people using those talking points are making.  Many in conservative media are trying to minimize this as nothing.  It certainly is not, and my gut says it is just the tip of the iceberg.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Perhaps I misunderstood.  I referred to both his conversation and the charges of more than a dozen women.  I took your reply as a reply to both references.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Believing it will/will not come to much is far different than taking a stand that someone who commits a felony should be held accountable for it.  My take is that you are arguing that should not be the case.  Have I misunderstood?
@BodilLehrmann4 @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick I was replying to "while the grantors of that citizenship were for all intents and purposes, immigrants?!"  There should be no ambiguity in that...
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Indeed, he may have the hardest evidence for Trump to overcome...
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I think charging a sitting president with a felony is a very serious thing and the DOJ is probably making sure they have it right before they act.  There could be a number of things influencing timing that have nothing to do with either option you presented.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I think the women who have alleged Trump assaulted would disagree with your characterization of their charges.
@PatClearySoCal @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick Asked and answered.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo That's why the testimony of Cohen, Weisselberg, and Pecker are important.  If they were involved, and they were, then they can establish intent.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Both felonies and if Trump conspired with/directed Cohen to commit those acts, then he is guilty of felony conspiracy.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo The campaign vs private is not a legitimate legal argument, as I understand it.  The charges are not using campaign funds to pay for the hush money.  Cohen's charges are willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and making an excessive campaign contribution. cont.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I'm sorry, but more embarrassment than "grab em by the pussy"?  Context is important here.  There were also more than a dozen women already accusing Trump of sexual assault, but he paid hush money for claims of a couple affairs to prevent the embarrassment of his family?  Context
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo If he would have been transparent and directly paid the women and reported it, there would have been no crime.  That is not the case.  Remember the context, it is important and shows the intentionality.  This doesn't exist in a vacuum.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo This isn't about public opinion of infidelity.  The charge is not infidelity, it is about a candidate for president conspiring to hide his use of funds to influence an election.  There is evidence of that: the president's voice on tape before the McDougal payment.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo I am unconcerned with partisanship OR public opinion.  If there is corroborating evidence of Cohen's sworn testimony, then it is the duty of Congress to take action.  What another may have or may in the future get away with, is irrelevant.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo The burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.  Can you honestly say there is a reasonable doubt that it was with the intent to influence the election when it happened just a few weeks before the election and soon after the Access Hollywood debacle?  I don't.
@sherman21 @speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick That's a complicated question.  Many came as an escape, or as an opportunity for a better life.  Ultimately though, yes, they took as theirs what was not theirs to take and killed many millions in the process through disease and murder.
@NormOrnstein @MaxBoot and @GeorgeWill (other not real)
@cnni Wait, isn't that @realDonaldTrump's inauguration?
@BillKristol What grinds me is how it was intentional.  Not lower the flag, but lower the flag and raise them again at midnight Sunday.  That takes a truly petty person.  Not lowering the flag at all would have been less petty to me.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Do you have a source?  According to the fact check, criminality is tied to intentionality.  What someone else may or may not have done is irrelevant.  Donald Trump is responsible for the actions of Donald Trump.
@CillizzaCNN Donald J. Trump.  The Petty President.
@speecherkelly @jameshaning @LatchemRick Because they didn't come as immigrants, but as conquerors and colonizers...
Saturday, we lost a true statesman, patriot, and hero. A straight shooter, but a man of integrity and compassion. We will miss you, John. https://t.co/hUO4dYVydx via @indefact
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo In Trump's case, the allegations and publicly known evidence indicate that Trump, Cohen, and Pecker conspired to pay off Clifford and McDougal, with the primary purpose of influencing the election by keeping them from the American people just before the election. That's criminal.
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo Not reporting contribution &gt; $1000 w/i 48 hours &lt; 20 days from election, erroneous contribution dates, and late returning contributions that exceeded legal limit.  Serious, but still accounting related, and nothing indicating intentional, so shady? no https://t.co/YpGzHixUtP
@yashar @jennyhan True story... 😕
@scottdrum @toddeherman Right.  People are going to intentionally become homeless so they MIGHT have a chance to be one of the 195 people to live in a "government shack".  That's absurd.  Already 12k+ in KC and 6k+ unsheltered.

President Trump claims markets will crash if he is impeached. Is he employing "politics of fear" to keep support from his base?	 https://t.co/C4rcFzWULH via @indefact
@mgrlno @rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo That's not true.  In order to plea, the prosecution must still provide the case to the judge, the defendant must describe his crimes and how he is guilty, and the judge must accept the plea and enter a verdict.  Just because there was a plea, does not mean justice was not served.
@mgrlno @rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo It should be made clear that you are referring to the former head of the FEC who is opposed to campaign finance regulation and the champion of 'dark money'.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @CortesSteve https://t.co/PlWChgttW9
Does @CortesSteve realize how clownish he comes off with his superfluous partisanship?
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @JayGoldbergNYC Cohen is trying to avoid jail time.  Lying under oath could get him five more years.  It doesn't take a great leap OR a genius to conclude that telling the truth is in his best interest, NOT lying. Cohen is doing this for self-preservation.
@ChrisCuomo is on @CuomoPrimeTime asking if a pardon may be coming for Paul Manafort. Wouldn't a pardon effectively force Manafort into cooperating with the government and testify? If there is no jeopardy, then he cannot legally refuse to answer. Doing so would be a crime, right?
@waltshaub @JRubinBlogger @Susan_Hennessey It seems more likely that it was not within the scope of his investigation, so he shipped it to the appropriate jurisdiction.
Am I the only one who gets distracted when someone is on TV saying something important but they clearly have a large booger in their nose? 🤣🤣🤣
@snopes I must be slow today.  Just had a good chuckle, but a couple minutes too late.  #woosh
@waltshaub @Slate More likely he wants $500k for his family.  He will be spending his days and nights courtesy of the US taxpayer for quite a while and needs no money to tell the truth.
@Hadas_Gold No surprise.  The UK is our strongest ally and our president's neverending scandals and corruption are certainly of great interest to them.
@MikeDelMoro @sarasidnerCNN How many times in the history of the United States has a sitting president been implicated in, or the subject of, so many criminal investigations?  Are there any?
@MichaelDenesyk @CaliforniaGram I think the facts are clear in this case. Cohen made the payments and was reimbursed by the Trump organization.  Cohen's attorney @LannyDavis on CNN now with @wolfblitzer reiterating this.

@CNNPolitics Again, @GOP are so desperate to maintain their power that they refuse to take any action that might reflect badly on @POTUS.  The partisanship here is clear.  What is also clear is that the Republican party has abandoned their duty and are now complicit. #RecoveringRepublican
This is an important distinction. https://t.co/3uTDU8kKPA
Let's be clear: The immigration status of the accused in this case is not a relevant fact; it is a political tool. https://t.co/bQDkrxH9xi
@thehill Generally, people don't get charged, plead guilty to, then get convicted of crimes that did not exist.  If Cohen is guilty of a crime and Trump participated, there is only one logical conclusion.
@SymoneDSanders @KarenAttiah Silly facts...
@rockinu440 @asymmetricinfo There is a big difference in accounting errors by a campaign and a deliberate attempt by a candidate and his fixer to defraud the American people (two, actually).
@GrouchoMarx1011 @asymmetricinfo @POTUS Thanks!
President on Fox News saying payments didn't come out of the campaign.  Doesn't matter.  If the payments were made in an effort to influence the election (they were), then they were a CONTRIBUTION to the campaign that he had a duty to report.
@maggieNYT @jmartNYT Yes, of course.  Failure to signal is the same thing as reckless driving because they are both traffic related.  Makes PERFECT sense...
@asymmetricinfo The Mollie Tibbett case is no more or less important than any other murder that has been committed.  The immigration status of the accused is not a relevant fact, it's a political tool.  The @POTUS being an accused felon is relevant to every US citizen.
