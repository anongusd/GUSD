@GeraldcHasty Necessary part of the process
@JeanieSovereign So how should Americans exercise their right to tell Congress what to do?
There's plenty to go after Cohen on but trying to suggest conspiracy because the chairman of the Oversight &amp; Intel committees requested testimony from a witness seems a bit of a stretch.
@JeanieSovereign Lobbyists are often hired by coalitions of voters to advocate on their behalf. There are labor lobbyists, business lobbyists, gun-rights lobbyists and gun safety lobbyists, etc.
The issue of lobbying or not being discussed by Meadows &amp; Cohen is the practice in DC of "non-lobbyist lobbyists." Essentially they consult &amp; enable access similar to lobbyists, but don't directly advocate for their clients in the way that lobbyists, who must register, do.

@roon0292 @DrWutt Let's see who he is running against.
@roon0292 AL is gone. CO is in trouble. AZ, IA, NC, ME need to be on a watch list. I think Collins wins. Too early to predict on others although all incumbents are strong.
@roon0292 I tend to agree. At least as of today.
@roon0292 Also, weirdly, Heitkamp.
@roon0292 Thanks ... so proves my point. I think the key isn't so much that holding the WH guarantees big gains so much as it guards against (big) losses.
I mean... =&gt; https://t.co/zRnQVGpcCS
@roon0292 Right. I'm not saying Trump winning is automatically a boon to Rs. But Trump losing could hurt them. In 2012 Obama won re-elect, Rs lost House &amp; Senate seats. In 2004 GWB won, Rs won Senate seats (can't remember House.)
.@SenPatRoberts has a dry sense of humor. =&gt; https://t.co/jFNnZ4SbO4

@SenhorRaposa Purpose is both. And in a presidential, Rs will do better if Trump does better, generally speaking. That's the assumption to run with until we see data that's different.
@brianros1 As an aside, I think the POTUS candidates need to stop taking cues from others and formulate their own policies, even if it's essentially a copy. Otherwise they appear tools of others &amp; that doesn't look good in a presidential campaign.
@brianros1 FDR was smart - talked big, governed practical. This is the key. Moderation doesn't sell. Uncompromisingly radical doesn't tend to become law.
@brianros1 Broken up in pieces various aspects of it could be appealing. Harder sell all combined into one massive wishlist. And until the policy makers who support it better define it, the opponents can more easily define it any way they want.
@SenhorRaposa Because he believes it helps potentially vulnerable Senate Republicans up in 20, and he believes it could help Trump, which in turn helps his incumbent members.
@brianros1 This in fact might be quite smart. I'm not convinced Rs win the climate debate, given political trends. I'm rather unconvinced they lose the debate, however, if they get to run against the GND.

@chlobert_ @Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost I tend to disagree w/ this POV.

@connormw @Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost @IlhanMN It also doesn't mean lawmakers are being bribed.
@connormw @Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost @IlhanMN I tend to have a different view on these sorts of things -- even from many of my colleagues. FWIW. Anyway, we disagree and that's not going to change, so I didn't see the point in arguing it further.

@Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost @IlhanMN Money that goes to politicians in form of political donations comes from Americans.
@PeebsY0 @SpeakerPelosi Fair enough. I wasn't accusing otherwise, to be clear. But I believe there should be clarity about positions &amp; rhetoric.
=&gt; https://t.co/FgDKTZAH0W
@Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost Foreign state money can't play in U.S. politics. It's against the law. So it's not happening. Maybe it's possible some people have different views than you on Israel. That doesn't mean they're being bribed.
@gagz_gaming I've covered these 40 a lot. Don't necessarily disagree w/ your point. But most of them have been pretty quiet so far. Nature of news business.
@PeebsY0 @SpeakerPelosi If everyone's bought off then everyone on all sides is bought off. Just a fundamental disagreement about this.
@tigerlilymom So, that would apply to Democrats &amp; labor policies, and abortion policies, etc etc. Politicians have views, that attracts money of supportive groups. Taxpayer funded elections would force everyone to pay for politicians they oppose. That's a First Amendment problem.
@opinionated75 @Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost Distinction w/out a difference.
@gagz_gaming No disagreement. So the next time Rs trope about Soros lets discuss.
@Iamyu3000 @kristinegWP @rachaelmbade @washingtonpost Being critical of Israel &amp; U.S. policy toward Israel is different than saying Jewish money is buying off U.S. lawmakers. Be critical, drop the trope, &amp; we're not having this discussion.
@gagz_gaming Yeah, I think he was asked. But also that was months ago. Why not stick w/ the event at hand rather than asking "what about when Rs did it?"
@PeebsY0 @SpeakerPelosi You can discuss anything you want, that's different than using tropes about people getting bought off. 1) it's a trope, and 2) there are such things as sincere differences that aren't about being bribed.
@gagz_gaming Is this a fresh tweet? Why the whataboutism? This was discussed when it happened.
@RobertKYarbro Either souncing or peizing works.
@gagz_gaming @SpeakerPelosi There was a pretty big, similar reaction to this, if I recall.
Nothing out of bounds about debating U.S. foreign policy &amp; Washington's relationship w/ allies. But suggesting differences exist cuz opponents being bought off, particularly re: Israel, goes far beyond that -- &amp; is politically detrimental to side that employs this rhetoric.
@PeebsY0 @SpeakerPelosi Suggesting that Jewish money is buying off members of congress is different than engaging on policy differences. I believe you when you say it's non-controversial on Left but politically it's problematic elsewhere.

@nachofiesta @sethdmichaels bye.
@sethdmichaels No worries. Glad you reached out. Gives me stuff to think about and it's how I learn.
@sethdmichaels I think the way you said it just here is more compelling, and I was being critical of what he said, not the policy prescriptions, which I tend not to comment on (foreign policy being an exception.)
@sethdmichaels I can see and I respect it and don't take offense.
@sethdmichaels ...So, here's what I'd suggest: Just use plain language to say humanity is at a civilizational crossroads ... Also, to make the point, IMO it might sell better if the focus was on the Green part &amp; less on the New Deal part. That might help attract support from across spectrum.
@sethdmichaels Well, I sometimes share things w/ a snarky comment to suggest there is a better approach w/out suggesting what that more effective approach is. Guilty on that front &amp; I don't want to pretend otherwise. But it's fair point of criticism. So...
@sethdmichaels I take your point but I don't think it's an apples to apples analogy.
Dear people in politics, Hitler analogies are best left to situations that are similar to what Hitler is distinctively known for. =&gt; https://t.co/eBY9WU3UGE
@sethdmichaels I'm not arguing that per se. I'm saying that he's not going to convince enough people with those analogies. It's my political analysis of his approach to persuasion on this issue.
@sethdmichaels Fair enough. But I think in order to convince enough people of that position, this is not the most effective way.
@sethdmichaels I think he might want to work on the comparisons he's using to say the U.S. should adopt the proposed GND because otherwise civilization will cease to exist.

@HanKiwon I think it's easy to say that this POTUS is his own worst enemy in unique ways that are uniquely avoidable. The point is that he is leaving opportunities on table to be more successful politically and legislatively. OK, gotta run. Let's do this again.
@mpmacal Analysis is by it's nature subjective. But there was no subjective intent. ... That line by POTUS was confrontational. But that doesn't make it out of bounds.
@morganwarstler @DrWutt In fact I specifically make a point of validating many opposing views, cuz many are indeed valid &amp; I'm not always right. And I link to all sorts of POVs all the time, whether agree or not. So where this comes from I've no clue. But as such, we don't disagree on this point.
@HanKiwon Meh. But we agree on the hand-wringing about partisanship. That stuff has never concerned me either way, from Right or Left. (He has good instincts about his base, but beyond that, I wonder.)

@morganwarstler @DrWutt This is silly. But I welcome disagreement on the platform so please come again.
For those of you who enjoy a little "Blame" w/ your "America First." =&gt; https://t.co/ORJaIHBLOd
@HanKiwon Onus is on both sides to compromise. I just think most of POTUS' political problems are self-inflicted. There are always policies that are accepted &amp; not accepted. But his behavior is often his key obstacle. That's why 2018 happened despite a booming economy.
@AnnieAsheFields @derbybbb @philipaklein I'd quibble with some of this. POTUS fights all sorts of fights that are questionable but he does it anyway. But it's well argued and not entirely unconvincing.
@morganwarstler @DrWutt I'm getting bored. I can't even remember exactly what you were complaining about.
@AnnieAsheFields @derbybbb @philipaklein It was one of his better performances, as I noted, but POTUS isn't w/out responsibility in governing choices he has made &amp; is making, both when he had GOP Congress &amp; now w/ split Congress. Debt reduction has never been an interest of his. Nor is it an interest of most Rs in DC
@morganwarstler @DrWutt It's among my jobs. And the No. 1 way I do that is to write and report stories people want to read.
@AnnieAsheFields @philipaklein In my house, that's the role I play. What can I tell you.
@HanKiwon ...There is some fracturing no doubt but I wouldn't overlook how powerfully unifying their desire to beat Trump is. That's what happened in 2018.
@HanKiwon Trump is no ideologue but he is a partisan - and his style of communicating is overwhelmingly and sharply partisan. In fact, this is why I often say he squanders opportunities he would otherwise uniquely have to expand his base of support. On Dems...

@HanKiwon ...Maybe I'm wrong...Even if I'm right I don' think that automatically or necessarily translates into him losing re-election. Depending on who Democrats nominate, he could still win just the right amount of votes in just the right electoral battlegrounds.

@morganwarstler You're right, in grand scheme I tweet a lot more of all sorts of things than Examiner. But I still tweet Examiner stories every day or every other day, depending. But we might be hiring editors and you should apply.

@PnutBilly It was a Straw Man comment not unlike that which Obama uttered quite often.
@consmover This was a decent speech that could in theory be unifying. But 1) that would require POTUS keeping this tone more often, and 2) that ship has sailed.
@dumbdonaldtrum3 @HotlineJosh Ironic, no doubt.
...And Wednesday (or Thursday or Friday) morning's tweets will probably set things back to normal. But what if this had been his GOP convention speech? Or his inaugural speech, &amp; he followed through w/ tone &amp; tenor in office? I know - see Earth 9. 2/2
Among POTUS' better teleprompTer performances and all things considered not a bad mix of partisan dogma &amp; aspirational bipartisanship. Trump's challenge is that this is like year 7 of his presidency, rather than year 3. His ability to change hearts &amp; minds is minimal...1/
So, that was long.
"Great Nations do not fight endless wars." Prez Straw Man
"If I had not been elected president of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be involved in a major war." @realDonaldTrump on North Korea. (No mention that #CVID, the conditions the U.S. set for engagement w/ #DearLeader, has been sidelined &amp;/or discarded)
"But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, over $100 billion increase in defense spending from our NATO allies." @realDonaldTrump (NATO will settle for not being attacked by its most powerful member, I presume.)
Don't hold your breath on POTUS' trade legislation proposals going anywhere in Congress, either.
@ddimartino1 no doubt
@susancrabtree YEP.
POTUS finds a way to connect w/ Congressional Democrats &amp; get them chanting USA. Probably the best moment of any of his #SOTUs. So much potential in that regard that's rarely realized.
@BossClaw Just because it registers high doesn't mean everyone agrees about what should be done or what exactly the problem w/ immigration is.
POTUS missed an opportunity to overhaul U.S. immigration law, &amp; secure more wall $$, when he his party controlled House &amp; Senate &amp; many Senate Dems were running for re-elect in red states. His proposals tonight, beyond whatever compromise is reached to avoid a shutdown, are DOA
"I pledge tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE." @realDonaldTrump

The thing about POTUS #SOTU immigration riff: It worked for Trump in just the right electoral battlegrounds in 2016 (or so it appeared.) But it was a massive loser in 2018 in suburban swing districts &amp; true battleground states save Florida.
"Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate, it is actually very cruel." @realDonaldTrump
"I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally." @realDonaldTrump (this line will not please many of the activist immigration hawks backing POTUS, &amp; they'll likely complain to the West Wing tomorrow.)
.@SpeakerPelosi just gave the hand-signal to her side of the aisle to hold off on the boos as POTUS discusses illegal immigration.
=&gt;&gt; https://t.co/2eJextIgGs
"If there is going to be peace and legislation there can not be war and investigation, it just doesn't work that way." @realDonaldTrump
"...ridiculous partisan investigations..."
"We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty." @realDonaldTrump (Democrats ran on #Obamacare in 2018 &amp; it was largely a winner...finally.)
We're now knee deep in the valedictory portion of the evening. #SOTU
"There's been nothing like it." @realDonaldTrump says of the U.S. economy cc "Morning in America"

@Michael35978113 I get it completely. See my story today. But the point I like to make is that there's a difference between catharsis &amp; accomplishment. POTUS could accomplish more if he altered his approach. Might be less cathartic for those who like see him whipsaw Rs in Congress, however...
@AnnieAsheFields I think there's a difference tween catharsis and accomplishment.

@DanielWatsonLa @hughhewitt You keep mentioning his policies, which I don't take any issue w/ in terms of your point. His rhetoric has been lacking. It's glaringly missing compared to how he treats everyone else.

@DanielWatsonLa @hughhewitt First he slammed China, then he did the BFF routine, and he still routinely slams them.

@Michael2014abc @louiswu5 ...But policy made by the civilian leadership isn't automatically best either, even though I agree w/ civilian control as laid out by Const.
@Michael2014abc @louiswu5 Sometimes withdrawal is the right policy. But "never withdrawing" is not automatically bad policy. It's paid dividends in Europe since WWII and Korea, for instance. Commanders supporting a policy doesn't automatically make it the best policy...
@Michael2014abc @louiswu5 Whether or not a policy enjoys broad support is a separate issue from whether or not it's good policy.
@DennGordon Debatable. I think though that you could look to overseas deployments since WWII and Korea and argue that never going home, so to speak, pays enormous dividends.
@Michael2014abc @louiswu5 If doing so prevents more domestic terror attacks, then it might be a very good plan. At very least there should be honesty about the implications of withdrawing.
@louiswu5 That's a separate issue from whether it makes good policy. Good policy is not about will or resources. It's about what's good policy.
@DennGordon Debatable but fine. At least you're being honest about victory vs no victory, as opposed to just saying victory was achieved.

Voters often feel about policy the way they feel about the politician championing that policy. It doesn't always work out this way but it's hard for an unpopular politician to win a policy argument that is the subject of intense debate. =&gt;&gt; https://t.co/w92y5uytAd

@wawasense @realDonaldTrump Exactly. The party that thinks it's winning in essence, is OK with pain because they believe the other party will get the blame for the shutdown, and blink.
@AnnieAsheFields @realDonaldTrump Doesn't work that way. The point is pain and frustration, so voters get mad, blame the opposition, and force them to blink. No pain, no frustration, no blinking. Shutdowns are risky high stakes - very inefficient way of achieving policy.

@DennGordon Hence, the conundrum. There are compromises that would get a wall, but Dems would have to get something.

@JasonHornbuckle His ability to do that is questionable - and if he does it many voters will wonder what the shutdown was for if this was an option. It would make the problem go away but it's not a win per se.

@JasonHornbuckle Nobody. That's why he was smart to adopt it and push it. This isn't criticism. The idea for a wall existed.
@JasonHornbuckle All of that is true. But he attracted a broad cross section of voters. Won two huge landslides that included the popular vote. Voters were so pleased they elected his VP in a third landslide.
@JasonHornbuckle He didn't create support out of thin air. He just latched onto it and owned it. He deserves credit for recognizing an issue that was being ignored. He could have more support, and get more done, if he talked about it differently.
@JasonHornbuckle Right. But my argument is now he is undermining that progress.
@JasonHornbuckle Disagree. Reagan was nowhere near as polarizing as Trump w/ the broader electorate.
@JasonHornbuckle He doesn't have to do that, and I wasn't suggesting that. Just talk about the issue differently. That was the point I was making.
@DennGordon Take it up w/ the voters.
@JasonHornbuckle My argument isn't he should give them whatever. My argument really was that, the way he talks about it engenders more voter opposition than support.
@JasonHornbuckle But the wall is only partially being built. There is far less wall than Trump says is necessary. That's supposedly why he's holding out for wall money (says Trump, not me.) Had he made that trade he could have had a lot more money and therefore a lot more wall.
@JasonHornbuckle Yes, this is true. (I checked.) But my overall point is, he could have had more money to do more wall last year and in this latest pending bill, had it not become, politically, wrapped up in him and his rhetoric.
@JasonHornbuckle Maybe, maybe not. Most of that was existing -- according to POTUS there is no wall yet.
Wasted opportunity to drive a narrative that would reach beyond POTUS' base. =&gt; https://t.co/Fccq4JjJgt
@JasonHornbuckle Fine, but this isn't making it easier. I'd argue, using your metric, that their chances have gone from zero to negative 25.
Sort of surprised. If he had taken questions and said he wants to cut a deal, he might have forced Democrats to answer back about what their plans are. =&gt; https://t.co/91O1uoHgAV
@JasonHornbuckle Separate issue.
This is very similar to voters' views of health care during Obama years. Polls found strong support for elements of Obamacare - when polled separately as issues. When voters were asked abt Obamacare, it was big thumbs down. (Over time, as we learned in 2018, that changed.) =&gt;&gt; https://t.co/A9rZbbu5ML
POTUS begins shutdown at political disadvantage because Wall &amp; Border Security have become wrapped up in being all about him &amp; his rhetoric. Separated from Trump, on issue of border security alone, Republicans would be in a much better position. All of this could change, clearly
Interesting that POTUS didn't hold a presser like this before now, when he could have owned the spotlight in DC.

@TheBrain2019 Questionable view. But you can hold that view w/out arguing that Russia was right to be there because of terrorism and was only there because of terrorism. It was a communist invasion to create another communist dictatorship.
@NoahCRothman They short-circuited that problem, as you can see.
Trump just has a completely different view of U.S. foreign policy -- &amp; historical events in the world -- Post WWII than...Just about any American political figure, ever. It's essentially the Paulian view of the world.
"The reason Russia was in Afghanistan" was because of terrorism. "They were right to be there." (So, POTUS overlooks the USSR's communist invasion of Russia as part of Moscow's Iron Curtain foreign policy &amp; offers the, presumably, Putin line on it was about terrorism.)

@MatthewMGlynn He's referring to Republicans in Congress. And he's right about them. But I also think he's correct about GOP voters generally.
