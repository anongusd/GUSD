I’m not famous..... But wouldn’t that be cool 🙃
It’s really annoying when people use the phrase “I don’t get into politics” then proceed to act and speak according to a twisted supremacist agenda.
Boyfriend: mmmmmm you’re adorable		Me: thanks I thinks so 🤗
@byebellaxo @JustAGirIThing You look really happy in both pictures though and it’s not like fat = ugly because obviously doll you’s gorgeous and that smile is Amazing ❣️❣️❣️
Even if people don’t REALLY think I’m funny- I make myself laugh and that’s what counts🙃😂
I think it’s really great to know that everyone has a little bit of “I want to save the world” in them. And that for most of us, even the small saves count as the big ones. Because they fucking ARE, it all matters. PEOPLE matter. ACTIONS matter. WORDS matter.
I never post but I’ll probably be posting this more frequently because people are shitty. The difference between a bully and a victim is who tells first. And let me tell y’all motherfuckers it’s almost never the victim.
