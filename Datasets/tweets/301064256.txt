@smdemora @JoeNBC Depends on the rate of tax in the state.  How many crumbs did you get under Obama?  I would love to chat all night about this but I have some work to do.  Have a nice night.
@smdemora @JoeNBC I can dispute it.  My wealthiest clients would have had a higher tax burden under the new law.  I gave an instance, you didn’t agree with it.  I could list several off the top of my head but you wouldn’t agree with those either. Enjoyed the chat.
@smdemora @JoeNBC I do and I have clients in states without a state income tax.
@smdemora @JoeNBC I’m a CPA and did an analysis of my clients’ 2017 tax returns using the new tax law and the vast majority would have saved thousands of dollars.  My clients are middle class, small business owners, teachers, factory workers &amp; independent sales people
@smdemora @JoeNBC There are lots of instances where things he says or does are misrepresented by the press but more importantly they NEVER report on the positive things.  One example is the tax cuts being just for billionaires &amp; Corporations. 1/
@smdemora @JoeNBC Reporters should just report but they often don’t anymore.  Too much of a rush to get a story out and too little verification of facts.  I think we both agree the rhetoric on both sides needs to be toned down.
@smdemora @JoeNBC It doesn’t start with Trump but people like Joe and other tv pundits constantly push that idea.  I’m a husband, dad, Veteran, small business owner, community volunteer &amp; Trump supporter.  Media can reduce the hate by reporting fairly &amp; accurately.

@jeffmatthews80 @KimStrassel @lisamurkowski Even if true in college and high school, which I suspect it’s true for a lot of young people, it doesn’t make one a rapist or a life-long drunk.  I can testify to that personally for me and many of my friends.
