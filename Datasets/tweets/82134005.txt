@AwasiBernard @BBSimons @Fentuo I think it is fair to ask that the analysis be restricted to the first two (2) years of each administration.
@AwasiBernard @BBSimons @Fentuo Sorry for the typo, it is approximately 12.4 percent not 22 percent.
@AwasiBernard @BBSimons @Fentuo What this means is that for the period 2009-2012, the cedi depreciated by approximately 22% every year against the US dollar. I hope this helps in your interpretation of the information.
@AwasiBernard @BBSimons @Fentuo It is average annual depreciation. Hence for the period 2009-2012, the sum of the depreciation rates against the US dollar for FY 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 is divided by 4 (i.e the number of years) to get the average annual depreciation for the period.
