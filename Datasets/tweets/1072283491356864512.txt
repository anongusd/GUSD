@Manyakitty307 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FBI He is hiding his sexual behavior. That is not new.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump We just want a legitimate president that we choose. Any party but our choice without foreign influence. Is that too much to ask?
@Comey We miss you Sir. You have been a Republican that put country first and bc of that we respect you. Thanks for your service.
@MeghanMcCain The Republican Party is synonymous of RACISM, ANTI LGBQ, ANTI WOMEN. Itâ€™s very clear itâ€™s the party of old white men. Itâ€™s sad but this is the feeling.
@norcalsamy @MeghanMcCain Everyone should stop having FANATISM for the political parties and always to shop around. So leaders get forced to put the best candidates instead of crappy ones.
@MeghanMcCain Regan spells REAGAN.
@curiosita33 @DevinNunes @VDHanson @RepTjCox Nunes is a scam. He is going down bc of conspiring with Flynn of getting money from Turkish gov to deport the Turkish man in PA. QUID PRO QUO. This is the most corrupt admin EVER. And I was a proud Republican!
