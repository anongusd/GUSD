.@USBPChief: What the numbers don’t show, is how my men and women care for these vulnerable populations with the limited resources they have. As I have said before, we do not leave our humanity behind when we report for duty.
(3/3) Today, nearly 80% of those apprehended are from countries other than Mexico. The vast majority are Central American family units and unaccompanied children that require significant care in Border Patrol custody and then enter a backlogged immigration system.
(2/3) To understand the numbers, you have to look at what is happening on the ground. In the 1990s, a time when Mexican nationals represented up to 90% of apprehensions, an agent might have apprehended and returned the same individual multiple times in one shift.
(1/3) @USBPChief: There is an ongoing debate about whether this constitutes a border security crisis or a humanitarian crisis.  Let me be clear – it is both. I’ve been asked many times how the current situation can be a crisis compared to years when we surpassed 1M apprehensions.
.@USBPChief: We are seeing a dangerous new trend—families and unaccompanied children are crossing in large groups ranging from 100 to nearly 350 people—68 groups so far this year, compared to only 13 in all of last year, and 2 the year before.
.@USBPChief: With no consequences to crossing the border illegally, the flow of family units across our SW border is unprecedented. In the first 4 months of FY19, family unit apprehensions along the SW border are 290% higher than the same period last year.

Every day, #CBP officers and agents go towards danger, as Agents Pierce and Morales did, trying to right a wrong, protecting others—even at the risk of their own safety, and every night, so many confront the darkness with courage and determination, as Agent Martinez did. https://t.co/nDPUFCDGTB
Agent Martinez was patrolling along Interstate 10 in a remote area when fellow agents were alerted that he and another agent were in distress. He died as a result of his injuries on Nov. 19, 2017. The circumstances surrounding his death are still being investigated. https://t.co/xxjdj17NtD
Agent Morales was confronted by an assailant with a knife in May 2017. While attempting to disarm the assailant, Agent Morales was stabbed multiple times. He died as a result of his injuries four days later. https://t.co/90UU4FHsVx
While off-duty in Aug. 1995, Agent Pierce witnessed an innocent man being stabbed. Agent Pierce identified himself as a federal law enforcement agent, apprehended the assailant, and while trying to disarm him, suffered fatal wounds. https://t.co/iFvzIIHDAA

Joint statement from ICE and CBP regarding #HurricaneHarvey Spanish translation: 	https://t.co/BWf3XJLZm3 https://t.co/Sw5JApXI7Q
CBP will remain vigilant against efforts by criminals to exploit suspended operations caused by the storm. (7/7)
Two checkpoints, one along Hwy 77 and one along Hwy 4, have been temporarily closed. (6/7)
At this point, anyone travelling through a USBP checkpoint would be traveling directly into storm-affected and/or evacuated areas. (5/7)
Travelers leaving the lower RGV to the north- if traveling along Hwy 77 or U.S. 281- may encounter checkpoints that are operational. (4/7)
Those evacuating storm-affected areas will not travel through a U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint. (3/7)
Checkpoints located in the Rio Grande Valley, although located along evacuation routes, are well south of the storm &amp; affected areas. (2/7)
TX evacuation routes leading the public away from areas most directly impacted by #HurricaneHarvey aren't affected by checkpnts in RGV (1/7)
