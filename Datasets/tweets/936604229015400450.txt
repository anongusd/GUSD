@klidifia @realDonaldTrump Check out my reply previously. Add:	Increased racism.	Increased white nationalism.	Increased gun violence by home grown Americans, not illegal immigrants as he would have you believe. 	I've watched Trump for over 30 years. He's always been bad news.
@klidifia @realDonaldTrump National debt at unprecedented level.	Pharmaceutical prices for life saving drugs (insulin) beyond what most can afford.	Stock market is not indicative of the economy.	Companies using tax cuts on buyback rather than employee benefit.	Low &amp; mid class paying higher taxes this year.

@johnbeckham192 @UcheniKot @kristiania_93 @KamalaHarris @EllenPage Disagree. Happens faster with kids: smaller muscle mass. It may only have been 3-6 hours since her last water. She was in high heat. Her temp would have been up, the first sign. She needed fluids (pedialyte) forced as soon as BP started to transport them to facility.

Is that making America great? If so you MAGA really have set the bar for greatness low. Oh right, a wall is more important.
@james92051427 @SenSchumer Knock something out, have something to replace it. Just ending it without replacement do no one any good.
@OliviaVivianne @LeviatanRmrz @acoustiksoul @KamalaHarris Ever heard of the Language line? Hospitals use it. Telephone the line, tell them the nationality of the patient, they find a translator, put phone on speaker. Have an ex-corpsman, medtech or a NA on the bus sent to bring them in with a thermometer, Gatorade, Pedialyte in coolers.
@james92051427 @SenSchumer In the meantime thousands of voting tax payers without insurance will die. Stuff your wall!
@OliviaVivianne @LeviatanRmrz @acoustiksoul @KamalaHarris She wasn't at first, would still have had increased body temp. She can be lethargic &amp; refuse water &amp; food, which is why fluids (Pedialyte) should be FORCED. MDs write orders for kids &amp; elderly in hospitals to FORCE FLUIDS because the sensation of thirst diminishes. Preventable!
@UcheniKot @johnbeckham192 @kristiania_93 @KamalaHarris @EllenPage This is what you are referring to: water intoxication, overhydration. Also very dangerous, Gatorade orally is a help. Children can be given Pedialyte, available at any grocery, Wal-Mart or CVS, etc. The key is spotting it. And a simple temp check showing elevation will spot it.
@johnbeckham192 @UcheniKot @kristiania_93 @KamalaHarris @EllenPage Here is an article about an healthy athlete dying of dehydration to illustrate how easily it occurs. Happened this summer in DC. https://t.co/II9MCWlxj0
@johnbeckham192 @UcheniKot @kristiania_93 @KamalaHarris @EllenPage Usually hyponatremia (sodium loss) &amp; hyperpotassemia (potassium retention) caused from heat exposure. Known as heat or sun stroke. If treated with fluids &amp; electrolyte monitoring/replacement it is reversible long before sepsis (not caused by infection) causes multi-organ failure.

@SecNielsen @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump  Hire ex-corpsman or medtechs to be included with transport vehicles for illegals. Arm them with a thermometer. Elevated temp is the 1st sign of dehydration. If healthy marathon runners can die within hours of dehydration, a child sure can!
@OliviaVivianne @LeviatanRmrz @acoustiksoul @KamalaHarris Well, they usually call transport vehicles to the desert to get them back to the facility. A trained ex-corpsman or medtech, armed with a thermometer taking temps as they're herded on the bus would have picked it up immediately. Make them part of every transport. T°&gt; is 1st sign.

@OliviaVivianne @LeviatanRmrz @acoustiksoul @KamalaHarris Father spoke Mayan. Form was English. Problem? And form, like most, may have only asked for her PAST medical history.

@WazzuCoug94 @Lydialuvsdogs @RealSadotWhite @conservmillen Should he have simply left her behind? He was trying to get her away from a nightmare of violence &amp; death.

@WazzuCoug94 @Lydialuvsdogs @RealSadotWhite @conservmillen Look, I don't know what your profession is, but having been an RN with a speciality in infectious disease for over 40 years tells me this was OUR ball and WE dropped it!
@WazzuCoug94 @Lydialuvsdogs @RealSadotWhite @conservmillen One nurse or med tech on the bus with a damn thermometer would have clinched it. They should be part of the recovery transport team. Had she been that ill already a simple Temperature would have sent up red flags. Temp increases with dehydration and/or sepsis.

@WazzuCoug94 @Lydialuvsdogs @RealSadotWhite @conservmillen No, but it could have been start, until IV fluids and antibiotics started had she been screened by a nurse immediately upon triage.

@LCCrusader @NBCNews After my mum passed I found a large tin filled with silver coins. My dad emptied his change in it every night. He died in 1970 &amp; they added copper to coins about 1965, so everything in the tin is pretty much silver. A silver quarter is worth about $3.50. Also found iron pennies.

@LCCrusader @NBCNews Those that are dated from 1982 and earlier are heavier because those are the coins made with 95 percent copper. A copper penny is worth more than other pennies -- now mostly made of zinc -- currently priced at $0.024.
@LCCrusader @NBCNews It sure wouldn't pay for the cost of the search!
@LCCrusader @NBCNews Yes, heavy. But that isn't what they'll find in an old coal mine. It will be hollow snips of wire, ends &amp; pieces, left behind as waste. My grandpap, a coal miner, told me most snips weren't above 5-6 inches long. Took him 2 weeks to find enough to make a twisted bracelet for me.

But not the Pepsi I sent him after: he'd paid for it but left it on the cart!
@NBCNews The search is estimated to cost over $1M. And you gotta have boat load of copper to make serious money. Current price is between $1.63 - $2.45/lb for scrap copper. Copper is fairly light weight. A five gallon bucket of copper would fetch roughly $900 if its top grade pure.

@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics I consider him dealing with Russia for personal gain while running for the highest office in our land treason. Things like that make a president vulnerable to foreign influence. But the HJC will decide if he has committed treason, not me. That is my own personal opinion.
@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics We will all know when the investigation results are released. In the meantime, the House Judicial Committee will decide when or if to impeach and what in his case constitues "high crimes and misdemeanors".

@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics NO! The constitution DOESN'T lay it out!

Article II, Sec 4
@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics I'm thinking YOU should read the "rules" for impeachment you unsuccessfully attempted to quote to me!
@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics Considering the House Judiciary Comm decides what a "high crime or misdemeanor" is, it can be "collusion with any government, or individual" if that is what THEY decide! So, yes, he can be impeached for collusion !
@james92051427 @DumpChumpRump @CNNPolitics Do you even know what you're talking about? Or are you so desperate to protect your poor choice for president, that you will babble anything to avoid admitting you may have made an error?
@james92051427 @CNNPolitics Abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, unbecoming conduct, &amp; possibly tax evasion. Actually, not releasing his tax returns can be considered abuse of authority. All his verbal abuse of people is unbecoming conduct.
@james92051427 @CNNPolitics Manhattan is where his business dealing are, and they hate him.
@james92051427 @CNNPolitics High crimes &amp; misdemeanors covers allegations of misconduct by officials: perjury of oath, abuse of authority, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, unbecoming conduct, refusal to obey a lawful order, chronic intoxication, &amp; tax evasion.

@james92051427 @CNNPolitics It was not $154 B and it was Iranian funds frozen in our banks when Sanctions began back in the 1970s.

@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump How is using unarmed drones to patrol our borders a "human rights" issue? My post never suggested arming them. Again, don't read what isn't there! And are you saying people can't climb a wall on the Mexico side and simply stand there pitching rocks at our guards?
@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump And you were not asked to refer to me as "Ma'am". I was merely pointing out I am not "buddy". Do not try to read words which are not there.
@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump My asking has nothing to do with your lack of punctuation, more with your lack of critical, analytical thinking, usually developed as a result of multiple life experiences and life education. Not stereotyping, more intuition.

@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump The first line of defense should be border agents - not a wall. With our technologies, a physical wall should be the very last thing considered. Invest in trained agents &amp; technology. If one can deliver bombs &amp; Amazon packages with drones, why not drones as an adjunct to agents.

@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump I repeat: ask Berlin about their wall. But that aside, we host more homegrown terrorist, radical, milita, anti-goverment, Nazi, Communist, anarchist, supremacist groups/cults than any other country in the world. Concerned about terrorism? Well, start here at home!
@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump Well, just see to it only YOUR TAX$$ are used for the wall that can be flown over, boated/swim around, climbed over, tunneled under, etc. You might also volunteer to lay bricks or pour cement. Just like doors &amp; windows, walls can be breached. Ask Berlin about their wall.

@Sunny_Singh10 @Guinz @realDonaldTrump Pehaps. But no one here is avocating OPEN borders. And the terrorist in France was homegrown, born and bred, radicalized in prison. Much like the homegrown terrorists here and all our mass shooters. The 911 terrorists entered legally via Canada by plane.

@0517Marie @BeKinderTrump @realDonaldTrump It was due to Iran's international banking privileges, or lack thereof. It was paid in multiple nation's currency, according to where Iran had privileges. The other alternative would have been in gold. Want to know more, research it yourself like other intelligent people do.

@LCCrusader @realDonaldTrump They invested the money, like you would. To not pay would violate international banking laws. Plus, the International Court in the Hague ordered repayment with interest. Obama managed to come to private settlement with Iran before the court ruled and saved the US many &amp;&amp;&amp;s.
@LCCrusader @realDonaldTrump Possibility radical. https://t.co/ypNmgu3Wgn
@LCCrusader @realDonaldTrump I doubt you know the answer to that either. Or can adequately prove what you may think. Despite all that, the money belonged to Iran and was returned to them, along with the accumulated interest of 40 years. We're STILL in possession of physical property belonging to them.
@beverlySkaggs6 @4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump My friends in NYC had business dealings with him in the 80's. So, I do know a good bit about him. He STILL owes them money &amp; they're dead!

@Elvis88697556 @mitchellreports @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer It's real easy to understand if you choose to educate yourself about it. If your bank froze your money for almost 40 years, wouldn't you go to court to get it back?
@Elvis88697556 @mitchellreports @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Didn't have to: that was Iranian money frozen in our banks. He simply released THEIR money back to them along with the earned interest &amp; fines we were required to pay by the international court in the Hague, before whom Iran brought suit against the USA for return of the funds.

@pjones59 @bbdevices @dextervanzile @therealjimrich They already do. Big lumber companies plant trees as they cut. But it is 30 years or more before they can be cut.

@koeni4 @RealSteveReed @Hwnheart @FoxNews I have real problems with "generational" entitlements also. I remember hearing the 13 yo daughter of a 33 yo welfare mother who'd just delivered her 5th illegitimate child, say: "I can't wait to have a baby so I can get a check too!" I saw RED!
@pjones59 @bbdevices @dextervanzile @therealjimrich Domestically, we are not able to supply all that is required. Especially lumber. That's why all paper products will increase. I'm not sure what with the ink.

@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Well, there have only been 5 presidents elected who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. It happens. Rarely, but it happens.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Right. But we may need to revise the Electoral College. I don't know how, but it should be examined.

@KateMikal3 @janice_masson @NonVisualMan @davidfrum Yep, exchange rates are really confusing.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews I'm talking about the owners of the company I was familiar with (my sister's in-laws). Relatives of Bugsy Seigel. Not real sure if I'd  have welched! And my step-gran's brother Frank worked for Capone! Joking aside, you don't welch on contractors you've dealt with for years!
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Of course. But in these numbers? For one person? HH Holmes did the same thing when he built the Murder Castle in Chicago in 1893. He was a mass murderer. Not paying contractor bills is what helped catch him. Gee, you don't suppose??
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews The reporters can question him about anything. Freedom of speech and press, you know. If you are reading what I'm reading, twitter, facebook, domestic newspapers &amp; foreign papers, you will see everyone is having problems with it now! And if you remember he LOST the popular vote.
@2021_free @realDonaldTrump Mnnn, just be the Alzheimer diagnosis he was trying to conceal!
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Now, I'd have to ask myself why he felt the need to defend himself like that. With the number of law suites in the courts right now about non-paid bills to contractors, where there's smoke there's fire!
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Obviously they were doing very good work and fulfilling their end of the contract. They had the same contract with the Kennedys for years and they paid promptly. Trump welched on the contract.
@MrDane1982 @AriWilker It was a decades old "conspiracy"? Moe grasping at straws. Actions of a desperate man.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews My friend are dead, their sons sold the company and the new owners are STILL trying to get the money he owes. Do you know the borough of Manhattan, his home base, voted for HRC in both primary and secondary election? They don't like him. Many of them have experience with him.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews He is no diplomat, does not understand US or world economy, is divisive, is clueless about our government &amp; how it works, &amp; does not seem to understand the value of occasionally keeping his mouth shut, &amp; doesn't even have the honesty or intregrity to pay his damn bills!
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Then by that logic AND the fact that the Republicans UNANIMOUSLY vote NO to a proposal to invest funds in our election system to render it unhackable, by that definition the entire Republican party has no integrity and are guilty of corruption.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews Well, paying his bills would be a start! He STILL owes the contractors in NYC for Trump Tower work. There is a law suit now. My friends had an exterminating co. w/contracts to do his buildings and those of the Kennedys. The Kennedy's paid. Trump never has done so.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX Nasty! Think I'd rather have the chicken shit! Less diseases. Nutters come in all sizes, shapes, sexes and political affiliation.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews How do you know they do? If you think that then start supporting universal voter ID &amp; improved voting methods that are unhackable. That is the only way to prevent voter fraud of any kind. Ask yourself why the measure to do this was defeated by Republicans unanimously in Congress!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX They would be expected to deal with insurance, workers comp, unemployment tax, etc, as well. Things most Americans demand of a job. Which is probably why Ivanka has her clothing line made in China. And we wouldn't be able to afford an apple.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX Well, around here people will not work for the money paid by the apple orchards. They'd never get their crops in without migrants. Keep in mind not all migrants are Mexican. A nurse I know who's job was to visit the camps says at least a quarter are homegrown white!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX I know. He became the Great Emancipator by accident.
@james92051427 @ChrisSalcedoTX @FoxNews I can't remember Bill wanting a wall but I paid little attention to politics after Nixon. I've always been Republican until Trump. Came from a long line of them. Even had family in state legislature. And then Trump. I've known of him for years, at least 30. Very unsavory fellow.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX How could you miss it? It was the restaurant Sarah Sanders was asked to leave. Our nutter drove 2 hours to fling chicken crap in the restaurant the day it reopens! I know which one you're referring to, it was human feces. I can't remember where. Totally nuts! Nutters everywhere!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews Well, there are no Federal or Constitutional amendments banning local laws. So, once again I say: improved voter ID and improved voting methods is where your argument should be focused to counteract any harm to the system. Don't get focused on one tiny thing.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX You can prove farmers are all Democrats?? Don't you see what a dumb statement that is? You're making wild, unsubstantiated allegations with 0 facts. Odd, considering many of Trump's farmer supporters are Republican having voted for him. And they are the ones depending on migrants
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX I'm liberal, but educated. The Civil War was about economics &amp; States rights. Most wars are about money or land. The fact that slavery was the spark was providence. Could as easily been something else. Lincoln actually never intended to end slavery. Just prevent it from spreading
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews Possibly, but I thought my education liberal in all it exposed me to. I came out with religious and racial tolerance and the absolute certainty that there was always something I could learn from anyone, and that I would never be too old to learn.
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews You should be a female: they are the real minority! I've dealt with THAT for 60+ years. And then add being a Little Person to it. You don't know what it's like to be a REAL MINORITY!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX The dude who threw the crap at the Red Hen restaurant was a Republican. And from my town! A real nutter. But there are nutters on BOTH sides. You are making generalizations and that is unfair to both sides.
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews How is a local school election in San Francisco or Takoma Park MD harming the rest of the country? Aren't you making mountains out of mole hills? Isn't the issue about the SAFETY of our elective process, so we can maintain the sanctity of our democracy? BIG PICTURE!!!!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews No one's arguing with that. It just happens that the LAW in those communities allow voting in school elections.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX I do agree with you on that. Having a mock election is a great idea to teach them how the system currently works, but it should not involve real candidates. It should be class members.
@tobyjwoods1 @FoxNews Yep. I've friend who had the misfortune to do business with him back in the 80s. They're both dead now and never did get the money he owed them!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX I agree to a point. I went to school in Chicago in the 60s. We had classes offered for African-American History, History of Religion, as well as being required to take American &amp; World History. We were also required to pass a Citizenship Test to graduate. A liberal education.
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews It's up to the state. Not you. And while you are entitled to your opinions, don't you think all our energies would be best directed to advocating universal voter ID and corruption free voting systems? Isn't THAT the Big Picture? Don't swallow a camel and strangle on a gnat!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX You could actually claim the same about Catholic schools, Hebrew schools, even the Lutheran school I attended. And just what is wrong with religious or liberal tolerance? That's why our nation was founded. Pilgrims, remember? Looking for a place to practice their faith unmolested
@ChrisSalcedoTX @james92051427 @FoxNews You've missed most of the conversation. They can only vote for school referendums, etc. They can't vote for State officials or in any Federal elections. Go back and read ALL our posts so I don't have to repeat myself.
@tobyjwoods1 @FoxNews I know. How would they remember everything? So, Trump's assertion that it is illegal is an "ass"ertion only. Usual grasping at straws!
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX Again, this is only for local elections. Usually school boards, school spending referendums, maybe town counsel. They cannot vote beyond that, so this would not benefit rights, lefts, or middles! You are thinking extremes. Don't get carried away.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX The facts are that allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections actually increases their applications for full citizenship, because now they have a vested interest in the community.
@FoxNews In 2001, the American Bar Association’s Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility reversed long-standing precedent and held that lawyers may ethically tape their conversations.
@HouseGOP Shut up! https://t.co/WSGKgvdIdT
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX The whole point is, that except for Federal elections, there is nothing in the US constitution or Federal Laws barring a state from making it legal for noncitizens to vote in local, county or state elections, either by State Constitution, State Amendment or State Law.
@acertainparty @FoxNews But here we go: it's his restaurant, and he can serve the clientele he wants, however he wants. No shirts, no shoes, no service.
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX The Illegal Immigration Reform &amp; Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 states it’s unlawful for noncitizens to vote for candidates seeking federal offices. But it’s not illegal for noncitizens to vote for local offices if allowed by a state constitution, statute or local ordinance
@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX No they don't. There is nothing in the Constitution barring a state from allowing non-citizens voting in local elections if allowed by State law. They cannot vote in elections for State of Federal representation. So they can vote for a local school referendum if it's State law.
@acertainparty @FoxNews It occurs only on Sunday, for church goers with proof of church. Temple (Saturday), mosque (Friday), 7th Day Adventists (Saturday) would be up to the restaurant and dependant on the location. Here, the closest Temple or Mosque are more than 25 miles away.
@realDonaldTrump You're babbling again! But you're right! Obama did nothing wrong! You, on the other hand, are guilty as hell!
@acertainparty @FoxNews I've just never known one to do it. My housemate says when she was a kid there was one in her home town that did (we're both in our 60s). The owner did it to bump up business on Sundays. I'd have no objection to it as long as it was inclusive of all religions.

@james92051427 @FoxNews @ChrisSalcedoTX Well, I guess any city can change THEIR law to include these people if they want. And guess what? THEY CAN! The federal law does not prohibit non-citizens from voting in state or local elections!
@FoxNews I've never known a restaurant that did that. I wonder: if they also give a senior discount and the senior brings in their church bulletin, do they get a double discount?

@JustMeLiberty @JAlmerini @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump What children? Pizzagate? You know, you really should renew your tin foil hat. There is mental help for conspiracy theorists such as yourself. I suggest you get some.
@JustMeLiberty @JAlmerini @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump You too. Learn how mining right work while you are at it.
@JustMeLiberty @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump They don't. They own a majority of stock in a Canadian mining company. This Canadian company bid for mining rights to a plot of ground in Utah. Whatever they take out of the ground belongs to them! It's done all the time. We own mining rights in lots of foreign countries. Get it?
@JustMeLiberty @JAlmerini @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump The last news released on this was January 2018, and it is about the Foundation. This stems from a 2016 question about the use of Foundation funds earmarked for Haiti. And this question is still unanswered and has zip to do with Uranium 1.
@grouch_ass @lalaboo62 @AJadedLady @thehill Well, everyone's butt and privates smell! People even PEE in public pools, especially small children! Given a choice I'd rather have someone's SOCKS! You lead a very sheltered life, don't you?
@JustMeLiberty @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump The man gave the donation to the Clinton Foundation and had divested himself of his holdings in the mining company 3 YEARS BEFORE giving the donation. He was NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY! He could do anything with his money he wanted to! What don't you understand?
@JustMeLiberty @JAlmerini @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump That is a notorious fake news site, bordering on parody.  I'd be even more suspicious of the story because that's the only site I can find it on. I would figure such a story if reputable would be picked up by more than 1 source! https://t.co/sn6WxI6Gxb

I'm still wondering about @JustMeLiberty source for this grand jury spoken of in what the AG said was a dead issue, the debunked Uranium 1 controversy.
@ModernMindsPsy @PsychToday Electro Shock Therapy????
@JustMeLiberty @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump HRC had nothing to do with that. The State Dept was only one of 9 agencies involved in the sign off. And having done a search of multiple sources, there is no grand jury convened.
@JustMeLiberty @dennis0805a @realDonaldTrump I didn't say they were the boogyman! From various sources I've read, the uranium belonged to Russia in the first place! They had controlling interest in the mining company with the ore rights. All the U.S. Agencies involved had to do was sign off on THEIR ore leaving the US.

@Soared4Truth Do you have kids? If their parents are thinking it's now ok to show racist ideas, actions and speech because Trump does it, their kids will also. Racism is a learned behavior. And we had the problem of cyberbullying BEFORE Trump. He has just put his stamp of approval on it!
@Soared4Truth My friends and I are pretty much horror struck at what we see happening in our country. We're all baby boomers and veterans of the Civil Rights Era. We feel like we're moving BACK in time: regressing, not progressing!
@Soared4Truth No, I see his example in his own tweets. They are NOT the way I would want any child of mine to act. In fact, were my kid say some of the stuff he says, they would get a bar of Dial soap in their mouth to wash the nasty out!
@Soared4Truth How about the multiple law suits still going on in New York about his many documented instances of singling out Black and Hispanics tenants or refusing rentals at his properties?
@Soared4Truth Most (not all) of the recent examples of racism such as the one with the 92 yo man, the lady in the Puerto Rico shirt, kid selling water, etc were Trump supporter instigated. They were zeroing in on his handpicked scapegoats. As if he had given them carts blanc to have at it!
@tishdurkin @poeticbiology @thehill I don't really think she had any written rules to back her up.
@amarl @Boatoptional2 @LauraLitvan True. But still not bad money to just drive a car. Not like he spent years in college, constantly having to continue educating throughout the years, etc. Not putting him down by any means because look at the pompous windbag he had to deal with! He was a better person than I!
@thehill There were no rules about socks/clothing except in her own feeble mind. He may have been Diabetic, protecting his feet from abrasion on concrete. Diabetics get neuropathy, can bump &amp; damage skin tissue easily, get infections &amp; loose toes, feet, legs, &amp; life.
@LeistHarry @tishdurkin @thehill He was a guest of a tenant and wasn't causing trouble. She also wasn't the owner and had no documentation of the "rules" she was enforcing.
@ErtRob3 @FairlyFae @thehill You usually get worse than dirty socks in a public pool!
@Soared4Truth Trump divides every time he tweets about his favorite scapegoats: immigrants, usually Hispanic. A woman attacked a 92 yo man walking on the side walk because he accidentally bumped in a child - probably lost his balance. She beat him with a brick. He was born in the US.
@Soared4Truth Bipartisan cooperation? Died because the Republicans blocked him in every way they could. They controlled the House for 6 of Obama's 8, years and fully controlled the Senate for final 2 of those 8. Confirming a bill into law requires the majority of both houses.
@Soared4Truth Would you want your child to act like him? No respect for women, not even his wife. Thinks he is 'elite' and superior to you. Bullys people by calling them belittling names publicly, because it one of the ways he makes himself feel superior. Racist, remember "sh*thole"?

@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren It's a choice that only the mother and partner should make.
@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren The wefare program has been revised to finally pay for tubal ligation. Right now there are entire generations of families who receive government assistance. The whole system does need revised. I had a period where I needed temporary assistance for about 12 wks, didn't qualify!
@Soared4Truth Never. He has no leadership abilities at all. He leads by being a bully! That isn't a leader. And certainly not a positive example of a leader. It is an example of a prepubescent tyrant!
@Sloopyinca @thehill Mine don't need to be made public, Trump's do. It is a REQUIREMENT for running for the office of president. Every past president has done so. He should not be exempted.
@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren You speak from personal experience. Not all have that. But you should also understand that we're not pro-abortion, but pro-CHOICE. There is a difference. You made your choice, now you must allow others the same freedom.
@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren We always have! 40, years ago, just after a 33 year old woman had given birth to her 7th child, I overheard her 13 year old daughter say, "I can't wait to have a baby, so I get a check too!" We taxpayers paid for every one 1 of those kids until they were 18, &amp; then for their kids
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/4J7ZObk7UH
@thehill Does this mean Trump might not be able to renew his? He still hasn't released his tax returns so we don't know if they've been paid or not!

@business @bopinion This has long been proven in Europe. Why are we so damn backwards in the US?
@rashadrobinson @MoveOn Interesting article. I never realized that. Thanks for posting. The EPA really need to get back on track, for all our sakes.
@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren Regulating abortion is regulating my uterus. But I guess the beating heart of the woman in question doesn't count. Look you make your decisions for your body and I'll do the same for mine.
@thehill Maybe he gets a high when sitting behind one of those trucks in traffic! Me, I prefer to not be gassed in my car by exhaust fumes! Every minute an idiot is born, Pruitt happened to be the idiot for that 60 seconds!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I never lost pride in the US, just lost pride in her current so called President.
@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren My uterus is my business. Mine and my partners. Not yours, and most certainly not the governments. History will repeat itself if abortion rights are repealed. Society will have to shoulder that guilt just like a woman who chooses to abort will have to.

@phemsint @CarmineCooley @TomiLahren It would simply send abortion to back alleys where women would die. So much for Pro-life, they would be guilty of murdering millions of women.
@emmartin173 @Tugikorlo @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Yep, I need to back out also. Getting too much for me. Time to break out my tin foil hat!
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump I doubt it. I'm afraid my time is otherwise occupied this afternoon.
@Tugikorlo @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump I have what Trump does not: common sense.
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Look, sorry, but you are way out in left field. Obama's birth records are clear &amp; correct. No human with out the capability of time travel could logically construct such at conspiracy. Common sense, when applied, tell us that. Trouble is, common sense is sadly lacking in the US
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Still doesn't matter. Obama isn't President. And what are Linda Adam's bonafides? Just who is she? Can she prove it? Who vouches for her identity? "Oh, what a tangled web we weave...when first we practice to deceive." : Walter Scott
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Like I said before: he would have still been an American citizen. The further theory is old. Plus, as I reminded Wayne, Obama is no longer President.
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Well, look, if somehow 56 years ago, it was decided by "they" to make Obama President someday, the conspiracy to do so would have been mammoth, far reaching, &amp; all encompassing. Impossible. 2 people might keep a secret. 3: never. There would be far more than 3 in that secret!
@Tugikorlo @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Trump is such a "small" thinker. A petty man.
@JO3Canada @KATUNews Conspiracy theorists. They absolutely fascinate me. They see conspiracy in everything. For most, though, it's a way for them to explain why they are underachievers: I couldn't succeed because everyone is against me. I've always wondered who "they" and "everyone" really are!
@Tugikorlo @BMonsoon @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump Right. Conspiracy theorists? Don't believe everything the voices in your head tell you. Obama probably didn't need to attend classes like Wayne did because he was smarter! I aced a few classes like that myself. And Wayne is probably petty enough to be jealous of Obama.
@Tugikorlo @emmartin173 @RealWayneRoot @realDonaldTrump And this would, if accurate, make a difference how? Topeka, KS is still a state in the US. Even better, it lays within the continental US. He did go under the nickname of Barry as a child, but used his stepfather surname, Soetoro. His mother was actually born in Wichita, KS.
@amberNjtton @KATUNews Greed frequently make people shoot themselves right in the foot, doesn't it? Interesting, with him not an immunologist or virologist. If I remember he was a Pediatric Gastroenterologist. Wonder how he makes a living now?
@infowars Most people who are sexually abused, male or female, are first so shocked they wonder if they dreamed it. And then they are so embarrassed they frequently don't report it. It's a common happening. Who you are makes no difference. https://t.co/GVUJEblgzO

@twooatsodasgary @thehill Yep. Considerably more objective.
@Noel_zeek @thehill Ambien? The sleepwalk murders excuse? Interesting!
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal Ok. But he will do anything to repeal anything Obama did. It may not get through Congress.
@CNN Well, @DonBlankenship here in WV was responsible for the deaths of 29 coal miners because he skimped on protection equipment &amp; sentenced for violation of federal statues, &amp; spent 1 1\2 yr in prison &amp; is still running for senate. He isn't going to win. Bryce isn't 1\10 so bad.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal Well, I'm just saying the party is probably going to make another run at it. And if it's repealed it ain't gonna be pretty.
@Molly3186 Some cry "Bengazi" as well.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal Nice. I was the Director of IC for 20 years before retiring.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal Well, if it is repealed, and the family loses all insurance, that bill without insurance, can vary from $30,000-$300,000 or more, depending on the cause of the cardiac arrest and treatmen. My husband's ambulance bill last year after cardiac arrest, for a 2 mile drive, was $2000.
@twooatsodasgary @thehill I do. Even more so now. I even read the foreign newspapers.
@twooatsodasgary @thehill Yep. You are right there.
@twooatsodasgary @thehill At least I said more than "womp womp"! I used real words.And let's be honest. You really don't know that the Latino music was simply played for no other reason that to irritate the neighbor, do you?
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal Of what: nurse practitioner, what?
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal They may have another go at it before November elections. https://t.co/H9cSap7Puy
@twooatsodasgary @thehill Then there is no one to blame but ourselves. I vote every election: city, county, state, etc. And all primaries.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal And what do you do?
@twooatsodasgary @thehill Isn't that why we vote in the primaries, so they don't keep getting on the ballot?
@twooatsodasgary @thehill I didn't quote you. I said your argument was not convincing, since you offered no argument.
@twooatsodasgary @thehill I made no such assumption. Made no difference to me. I'm ex-Republican turned Independent.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal No, it's what I know after over 40 years in healthcare. I'm real familiar with insurances, Medicaid and Medicare.
@twooatsodasgary @thehill Better the devil you know than the one you don't!
@WhiteHouse ICE doesn't patrol the borders! Or aren't you informed enough to know that?
@SniperPatriot88 @CheriJacobus @DonaldJTrumpJr PS: *cite* may be the word you want.
@SniperPatriot88 @CheriJacobus @DonaldJTrumpJr So, where is your credible source? Link?
@twooatsodasgary @thehill And so are you with your "convincing" infantile " argument." You are a menace to your party. Trying to bring them down from within? You make the entire party look bad!
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal I will bet you that all these preexisting conditions will be on the "official" list along with some you will never even have considered. And all it takes is one of these listed, diabetes, to kill many adults, children, indeed, entire families.
@desselle0010 @RepJayapal @NancyPelosi Insurance companies have always done that! I went 40 years and very rarely used my insurance, but the premium went up yearly. I was paying for all those people getting chemo, organ transplants, etc.
@AjR_NY @RepJayapal @NancyPelosi Because you and I are paying for their healthcare for life with our taxes.
@ColetteManker @RepJayapal Once the ACA protection is removed, look out, it was that which protected you. ACA/Obamacare FORBID insurance from canceling you! They maybe perfectly free to cancel you if that is repealed if you were not insured before you developed those conditions.
@Texas_Eric1 @RepJayapal In your dreams! I work in health care, and there are several other conditions considered preexisting that didn't even make this list. In addition, they can turn you down if your PARENTS have these conditions because YOU will inherit the tendency to develop them.
@kerickson6813 @RepJayapal @NancyPelosi Yup!

@AP This is disgraceful. Our military should be better than this. We tout them as "the best", but apparently that's another untruth of the Trump administration.
@Soared4Truth @KeithAvant Yes. Ridiculous, or so I thought even as she said it. I have no use for people who generalize based on race, sex, religion, ethnic heritage, or any other label.
@SenatorTomUdall Pruitt had no clue. He said as much when he was appointed but continued in the position. Apparently to soak the taxpayer all he could. He has no honor. The honorable thing to have done would be to have declined the appointment immediately.
@BillKristol He grovels well, doesn't he? Sound like something Essex may have said to Queen Elizabeth I in an effort to keep her from beheading him (she did anyway!) Well, the public beheaded Pruitt already.
@BlondeEyesBlue @ABC He has done absolutely nothing deserving of respect. Do not confuse disrespecting the man with disrespecting the Office of the Presidency. They are NOT the same. Unfortunately, TRUMP has never respected the Presidency or he would have shown it in both actions and statements.

@WriteTonight @LynKY1950 @GOP @DariusVolket @realDonaldTrump I read everything. I was an Infectious Disease Nurse, head of the department for 20 years before retiring.

We want a fair immigration system enforced by persons of humanity. But all of us have to work together for it. Stop spreading stupid, there's enough already.
@ellenreese21 @thehill What are you on about? There was no mention of undocumented immigrants. Did you even bloody read the article before you started that totally off topic rant? Do yourself a favor, read the articles, so you make less of a fool of yourself. You are a menace to the Republicans!

@SharonMcCammon1 @patfarr67 @IsraelUSAforevr @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Here it's the voters card, federal drivers license and your name must also be in the county rolls with signature.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Do you know where Norway is? And that it considered to be one of the most developed democracies the world. And has the highest standard of living in the world. And that most of them don't want to come here on vacation anymore because you're such an ass?
@AlexJMcNabb @thehill Boy, are you out of touch! SHE attacked the kids, who were doing nothing but swimming. Then when SHE called police to throw the kids out, the LEOs talked to witnesses, watched the video, and arrested HER. Whereupon, she resisted arrest: hit one and bit the other officer! Lovely!

@mikefarb1 14th Amendment: While education may not be a "fundamental right" under the Constitution, the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment requires that when a state establishes a public school system, no child living in that state may be denied equal access to schooling.
@mikefarb1 Amazing. No wonder our nation lags consistently behind other industrial nations in education. We'll be back to uneducated, poor, and perpetually pregnant in just a few short years!	https://t.co/DjN2arMGKn
@NBCNews You know, one doesn't have to be a Democrat to dislike and distrust Trump. I've been a Republican all my life until Trump. And I've disliked everything about that man for almost 40 years. I know plenty of other  life-long Republicans who feel exactly the same.
@DaveyRox @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Correction! I wasn't implying you were unskilled labor but asking if your company was hiring skilled or unskilled labor. Sorry, that was very clumsily phrased. What sort of work?
@slg_carolina @w_terrence @JimEAllen2 I see Miss Carolina blocked me. I wasn't the one to make a totally unfounded, exaggerated statement! Another conservative who believes in the right to freedom of speech but only if it supports their view. That sort makes all Republicans look bad. It's very self defeating.
@BKLibertyFirst I guess you aren't willing to have an exchange of opinions/ideas without sarcasm, finger pointing or ridiculing, since you haven't responded. With supporters such as you, the Republican party is self defeating. You make them all look bad.
@slg_carolina @w_terrence @JimEAllen2 Well, I'm a liberal and I've decided no such thing. And no other liberal I know support that either. And how do you claim to know what all liberal want? Are you omnipotent? Like God?
@DaveyRox @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Who are you? Untrained labor? Glad to hear it. I most certainly don't like to see people losing jobs! In all this time, you are the only one to reply to the affirmative.
@RawStory Unbelievable! Behaviour learned at home. Disgraceful.
@CNN @julianzelizer @CNNOpinion I really don't know a single Democrat calling for abolishing ICE or any other LEOs. Exactly what fool would wish for total anarchy and open borders? Ah, tis easier to point fingers, blame, &amp; otherwise bad mouth your opponent than work together. What the hell is wrong with people?
@BKLibertyFirst Well, did you decide you couldn't have a discussion without insults?
@w_terrence @JimEAllen2 Actually, celebrating the 4th has nothing to do with the President or Office of the Presidency. It's celebrating the establishment of a new nation, not a man. So I'll celebrate the founding of this nation and those principles on which it's founded, such as freedom of speech!
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray Could you possibly conduct a discussion without accusations, finger pointing, or general nastiness? I've not used insulting language or nastiness or even sarcasm with you. I expect the same consideration.
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray What I defend are some of the controls &amp; protections afforded by the plan. Unfortunately, it was passed so it was an all or none deal. I said then you don't sign a contract without reading it fully. But repealing WITHOUT a better plan to take over isn't very bright either.
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray I prefer controls on medical law suits &amp; medical equipment pricing. A Sears tool cart with drawers cost about $250? Weld an IV pole to it &amp; two hoops to hold an O2 tank, call it an Emergency Cart &amp;  the price is now between $650 - $1100. Epipen costs $30 to make, sold for $300!
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray As soon as it was said I knew that wasn't going to happen. The plan hinged on HEALTHY, YOUNG people signing up - those who might go years paying premiums &amp; not using it. But young, healthy people didn't sign on. "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley.”
@thehill And another nutter bites the dust!
@MRyan1154 I'm also a renegade Republican who also counts herself as an ex-Republican, for precisely the same reason. Having known of TRUMP for some 40 years before the election, I actually voted Democrat. Better the devil you know!
@BKLibertyFirst Read my second post. Geesh, you sound like Trump: NASTY, aggressive, derisive. Hardly the way to win anyone to your view point. Just sets people's teeth on edge.
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray Sorry, it is Affordable Care Act. Being a nurse, I am used to emphasizing the 'health' aspect. Yes, everyone's premiums increased to help defray the cost of those with preexisting conditions. You would prefer they not be insured? You could find yourself among their ranks one day.
@FoxNews @POTUS He has said exactly the same thing of every meeting with a foreign leader. I think his record is stuck. It's another symptom of Alzheimer's Stage 2: repetition.
@BKLibertyFirst @PattyMurray Obamacare, otherwise known as the AHA, makes it illegal for a medical insurance company to refuse to insure you if you lose your current insurance &amp; have a preexisting condition, such as Diabetes, are a smoker, etc. The AHA also allowed for federal subsidies to help w/premiums.

@NBCNews Didn't @NBCNews talk to anyone who was actually laid off? Talk to them again after the jobs are gone, SNAP is cut, their parents SS and Medicare are cut so now they're helping support them, and their own retirement pensions have to be cashed in to meet daily expenses!
@GOP Sadly, history disagrees. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1929 resulted in tariff wars causing decreased trade. When trade drops, so does GDP, forcing job reductions, business closures and consumer belt-tightening. Simple econ 101. https://t.co/st2h6LcKgA
@HouseGOP @RepJasonSmith @POTUS Simple government econ 101: budget &amp; policies and effects for first 1 1/2 years made by previous administration.

@Apritions @nevrmyprez @realDonaldTrump Actually, you are correct. You might try telling that to the many Republicans who've cursed me, verbally harassed me, belittled me with obscene name calling, for stating my opinion of an issue. Is it any wonder many are responding in kind? But two wrong do not a right make.

@FoxNews Actually, why would a man be wearing any hat indoors? Women can wear hats but not men. It's totally inappropriate. He should have been politely asked to remove the hat first, not because of the type of hat but to satisfy long custom and not served if he made a stink about it.

I've been beat up so many times by conservative posters who have cursed me and called every nasty name you could think of that it's rubbed off! Thank you for drawing my own pettiness to my attention. We all need to be reminded!
@orkinbugman @randy_sheets @FoxNews You did, just in April. But more sanctions have introduced that Trump is declining to enforce.
@randy_sheets @hottestcatlady @FoxNews They know what it means, but chose to ignore it. And I didn't 'decide' what it meant, I read the actual law then I read multiple law analysis done by immigration lawyers and law professors. You, too, can read, it is fundamental!

@hottestcatlady @randy_sheets @FoxNews I'm against separating families for presenting at a border intake &amp; requesting asylum. It is legal - no law broke. I'm also against separating families charged with a misdemeanor for a first time crossing. That is not how the Law reads. So, WE are actually breaking our own law!
@Freedom_Heiter @randy_sheets @FoxNews And you are intimate with the conditions of the children how???

@allcome2dust @1Forest679 @edieconstantine @HouseGOP @cathymcmorris True, but they do have closed circuit tv in their office so they can monitor floor activity.
@randy_sheets @FoxNews Like perhaps the Russian Sanctions signed into law months ago by our Congress STILL awaiting enforcement.
@Southernlad65 @Pattillotrish @Shelby14_02 @FoxNews Intelligent argument. You will assuredly get converts to your view point with THAT argument.
@sotnak @mypennmarydel @randy_sheets @FoxNews And how that working out? My understanding is that it's been somewhat of a failure as a deterrent.
@hottestcatlady @randy_sheets @FoxNews Should have been, might have been: perhaps they anticipated the outcry it would bring. Sometimes you have to chose your battles carefully to get anything accomplished. Creating civil unrest really should not be a presidential goal. It is self defeating.
@mypennmarydel @randy_sheets @FoxNews Actually, those were the children they DID remove from 'parental' arms if the adult could not prove parentage. They also took kids unaccompanied by any adult, such as that poor child left unaccompanied several days ago by the coyotes in the desert.

@Rumphress @Venti_Poet @WhiteHouse He can't overturn a state law. Only four ways: the state legislature itself overturns it, changes it or state supreme court does it. Or the US Congress makes a law that supersedes the state law or the U.S. Supreme court strikes it down. The president cannot strike down state law.
@TXBOY361 @EdKrassen @topherralph He sure did pick an awful time to do this, no doubt about that! No accounting for crazy, though. I live 80 miles from DC so the news is all about this story but no new details. He did purchase his gun legally as he only had a misdemeanor (harassment) on record, no mental care.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Repeat a lie long enough and the people will eventually believe it as truth. 	Right out of Joseph Goebbels Propaganda play book.
@jof827 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Lady, I have not called you any nasty names or disparaged you in any way. I haven't disparaged your opinion. I expect the same consideration. You don't present any verifiable fact of a rational discussion, you just hurl insults. You make all Republicans look like imbeciles.
@jof827 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump You can believe what you want. I don't care. Every media is biased to some extent. You have to be smart enough to read it all and form an enlightened opinion. https://t.co/NgoU9zvFrM

@WallRossi @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Why? If Obama spent $114 MILLION total for ALL travel in 8 years &amp; Trump has spent $56 MILLION as of April 2018 (not inclusive of travel &amp; security expenses for the rest of his family) the taxpayer is on tap to spend in excess of $224 MILLION in 4 years just for HIS travel.
@jof827 @Danbeek @danadaynadaina1 @realDonaldTrump Illegal aliens can't vote. Minorities who are citizens should vote. Democrats are not socialists and the *their* is the possessive form of 'they' but *they're* is the contraction for 'they are'. Basic English grammar.

@TXBOY361 @EdKrassen @topherralph Just listening to the local news now: no info why he did it at this particular time. He had an escape plan but police response was too fast. He had even blocked the fire escape door. The Judge who heard his slander case against the Capital was also targeted but he got caught.
@slsteinman2 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I am quite aware of that. My post merely states what the yearly salary is. His 1st Q salary of this year went to the VA, 4th Q salary of last year went to an infrastructure fund. However, he has spent $56 MILLION of YOUR dollars on golf weekends. Considerably more than his salary
@dinadcr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I'll tell you what. Why don't you read ALL the posts attached to mine and look up the sources quoted. I've had enough non-reading, non-researching people and their ridiculous uninformed comments. I'm tired of reposting stuff already posted. Reading is fundamental.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It will possibly take Wisconsin a generation to recoup what they've given away in tax rebate, revenues and utility services to get this company. And apparently Wisconsin voters are pretty pissed about it.

@mchayden100 @maggieNYT And according to the newspapers AND the Annapolis police who have already examined his Facebook page and Twitter feed it started in 2014, after he lost his "slander" suit against Capital for reporting the facts of his guilty plea to an harassment case. https://t.co/E8fkM2J1EJ
@larkwick @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump The facts on Obama are pretty concrete. As of May 2018, Obama played golf 37 times over 8 years. Trump has played golf 56 times since inauguration. https://t.co/o86BsLgAUZ

@mchayden100 @maggieNYT And it's in the papers: LA Times, Statement released by the Annapolis police, etc. I read.

@DaveyRox @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Oh, I do. Harley Davidson was planning on opening more plants HERE to build product for sale overseas. Now with the tariff they're moving the entire thing overseas. Ergo: no jobs for Americans. Farmers are facing new 25% tariffs on goods sold overseas, sales will be lost.

@maggieNYT The Annapolis shooter is just a nutter with no published political affiliation, who had a grudge against the paper because they published the facts of his guilty plea to an harassment case. He sued for slander and lost. He's been planning this since that loss in 2014. Facts!!!!!

@TXBOY361 @EdKrassen @topherralph He apparently had been planning this for several years. Ever since the courts squashed his suit against Capital in 2014.
@EdKrassen Nothing I've read indicates any political bias in this shooting. Just a nutter whose held a grudge for years because the paper printed details of his guilty plea to an harassment charge. He thought they slandered him. Geesh, stop twittering garbage. Makes you part of the problem

Using EPA employees as personal body servants. The swamp wasn't drained, they simply changed players!
@lifesafeast @flashfire451 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump A family of grifters.
@StiversBilly @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I don't feel that way. You are entitled to your opinion. Racism is a learned behavior, learned in childhood, usually from ones parents &amp; family. People who are racist, have always been that way. They chose to show it because Obama was black, not because he incited them.
@BigD4110 @Danbeek @danadaynadaina1 @realDonaldTrump Me neither. You've really got to pay attention with them all. That's why I like several sources saying the something.
@mahilena Well, they have not actually been able to verify that he has done so, from all I have read so far. He says he has but there's not been confirmed evidence to the affirmative.
@lifesafeast @flashfire451 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Yes, brings up the question of why her product line as well as Daddy's clothing line are not manufactured in the US to "bring jobs to Americans" .
@CarolynPerc @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump That was the IRS cheating the taxpayers (and since when have they not cheated the taxpayer), not the entire administration. Geesh, one bad apple!
@Nannyalwaysrite @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump This has been posted multiple times. Don't people read the entire thread?	Total for 8 years of golf, vacation, all travel for whole Obama family is $114 MILLION. https://t.co/acDxYpAEm5
@Nannyalwaysrite @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Well, you are entitled to your opinion. Of course, more than have of his golfing trips have nothing to do with the business of the nation, though that is what he claims. Of his 37 trips, 22 were to pay golf with Athletes or TV celebrities. I doubt they were making business deals.
@tfuscellaro @KarenRienbolt @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Yes, Obama vacationed. Here: you can read this yourself: https://t.co/zmneJ3qXiA
@tfuscellaro @KarenRienbolt @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump The babysitting fee comes funds given to every president for personal expenses. Food, expenses for State dinners, etc are paid for by the president. This article may give you an idea. There are other such articles available that you can Google. https://t.co/ZS6UMHbHUc

@keyef2 @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Where did you read that in my post? That shouldn't be part of any news organizations agenda!
@FarmerDarth @FedUpResistrGrL @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump He is paid for speaking engagements, like all past presidents. He recieves a presidential pension ($200,000/yr) as well as an "incidentals" sum of up to $200,000. He also is entitled to SS protection and health care for life. So, where did you become privy to his tax returns?
@FarmerDarth @ChrisPipkinSr @FedUpResistrGrL @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump That too, is a matter of opinion. I hardly think having decent hard working Americans at each other's throats, increased incidences of racism, intolerance, hate, and increasing civil disobedience are indicative of things being "better". But we are all entitled to our opinions.
@TomiLahren This was not politically motivated. It was simply an act of crazy by an unhinged nutter.
@BarbStellar @LancasterPolice The Annapolis shooter wasn't tazed when arrested, and he had just killed 5 people. I see no distinction here.
@FedUpResistrGrL @gregf1971 @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I do the same. I also follow foreign news when in English and many are.
@stokedonlife @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump And then there is this: https://t.co/t4lzpq2Z9f
@BarbStellar @LancasterPolice Right, sure, tazer him BEFORE he does something. That would be like me, as a nurse, leaving someone on the bedpan for hours because they might need it before I leave. Cruel and unusual!
@stevetabs645 @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I am aware of his hobknobing with politicians and that they are talking shop (what else!) But of the 37 partners listed fully 22 of them were athletes or TV celebrities who have no business concerns to wheel and deal about. https://t.co/MFN60LAwt7
@RockyClavelo @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump That amount in the source I referenced DID include vacations, which you would have seen by reading it. As far as the other presidents.... I'll find it tomorrow, I'm too tired tonight. Unless you would like to bone up on your research skills and actually do the work yourself.
@stokedonlife @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I don't gamble. If there is peace in Korea or between North and South Korea, if that's what you mean, it will be due to their efforts, not ours. If between us and North Korea, we were not at war unless you're counting the Twitter war between Kim and Trump.
@monrdm Why don't you do some research on your own instead of spouting nonsense you don't really understand. Or do you spit out all the pap you're fed without looking at the pros and cons of the issue?
@monrdm Just keep on your blinders. There is a caveat with just about every point you're listing that you many not have realized. But it would take to long to inform you. Example: farmers are going to be real hurt now that the EU has put a 25% tariff on many food goods. Who will buy?
@BridgesAretha @Dowens8490 That's different.
@stokedonlife @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Each to his own: I prefer a done deal. You can live on air maybe but I'd rather have a real plate full of good things to eat.
@CostanzaND @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Keep hoping. Your bar must really be low.
@monrdm And when you read foreign papers you'll see ISIS is still out there and still active. They just haven't launched an attack on us. If ISIS is kaput, why isn't our military home?
@stokedonlife @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump And don't count your chickens! No, no kudos until it's done and over and It ain't over til the fat lady sings. You all have some really low standards if you're willing to settle for vague promises. Me, I'm waiting for the concrete.
@monrdm https://t.co/MFN60LAwt7
@monrdm That's funny. Only two were reported by the media. Were they incognito? If so how did YOU penetrate their disguise? The media follows Trump around the golf course just to report who he's with. He lives in a glass bubble. But only one diplomat and one head of state made the list
@JudyA99862091 @ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Pull up the link. Jesus, Obama's is the blue line on the chart! You can read a chart? You people must go out of your way to play dumb. Play dumb or are dumd?
@JudyA99862091 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump A person born abroad in wedlock to a U.S. citizen mother &amp; a U.S. citizen father acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under section 301(c) of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act (INA), if one of the parents has had a residence in the United States or one of its outlying possession
@JudyA99862091 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump It was a state. Wouldn't have mattered where Obama was born. His mother was an American citizen which automatically confers citizenship on the baby. How do you suppose kids born to military stationed overseas are American citizens?
@ThereelsAC @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/SLEEOfS1Nr
@ThereelsAC @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Obama took over after Bush plunged us into a recession. It took years to pull out of that. Anyone who understands how it works would know that. We are just now beginning to feel the effects of Trump legislation &amp; budget. All of 2017 was predetermined by the budget left by Obama.

@KarenRienbolt @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Of course they did. But with very few exceptions, the Obama's traveled as a group. Michelle took very few trips alone.

@ChrisPipkinSr @FedUpResistrGrL @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump They are all biased to a greater or lesser degree. It's up to us to use our brains, research and sort it out. 	New DRAGNET or old? I love old time radio and DRAGNET is one of my favorites. And I liked the TV DRAGNET but not the films.
@heidi_noddin Look. Just do some research on your own. Real research. Look at multiple web sites with an open mind. This Republican has already done so. I've watched him for 40+ years. And it does not add up to a person I want to represent our country.
@KarenRienbolt @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I've tried. But $400,000 a year is not a blip on his radar considering what he's raking in at Mir-a-Lago in Secret Service expenses: food, rooms, golf cart rental, etc. All of which taxpayers pay every weekend. That all adds up. Those same costs every time one of his kids travel.

@Glenbrat1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Yes, now they will be making more off shore causing Americans to be paid off!!! And they had planned some expansion of functions here. That's cancelled. And so are the bloody jobs! They state it is due to the tariffs! Means less jobs for Americans. How is this confusing to you?
@BigD4110 @Danbeek @danadaynadaina1 @realDonaldTrump Yes, only state propaganda info from Fox will be believed. There is no one so blind as those who will not see.
@Glenbrat1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump They already have some plants in other countries (India, etc) but will be moving more manufacturing functions overseas which may precipitate increased lay offs here and less manufacturing in the U.S. This means less US jobs. Read: https://t.co/PDmA9Tmlho
@Glenbrat1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Your statement isn't making sense.
@stidom1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump He is already on track to double the number of just golf trips in the first two years than Obama did in 8 years. At last count he's gone to Florida 54 times since inauguration. Obama went a total of 37 times in all 8 years. The sums posted for Obama included ALL travel.
@Glenbrat1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump They were playing on building here to sell overseas, using American workers (you know, Americans in those jobs). They now plan to move that plant out of America due to the tariffs, ergo no jobs for Americans!

@Glenbrat1 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump So, Trump goes to Florida. At least in Hawaii the taxpayers financing the SS expenses, etc. were benefiting the local economy: restaurants, hotels, etc.  In Florida, every dollar goes into Trump coffers at HIS resort. Not the local economy. Your point?

@sandi_hellmann @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Seriously, read the whole article: Obama 37 golf trips in 8 years. Trump 57 in the first year. https://t.co/o86BsLgAUZ
@ChrisPipkinSr @FedUpResistrGrL @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Well, I have many reasons. I've followed him since the early 1970s. It's been interesting. My husband, the most die-hard Republican and most politically well informed person I've ever seen, turned to me just before the election and said, "Trump scares me. He will destroy America"
@Danbeek @tisJoniMerritt @PoleNordPoleSud @danadaynadaina1 @realDonaldTrump Well, there are conservative haters as well. Sort of like the pot calling the kettle black, ain't it?
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Me too!
@tisJoniMerritt @PoleNordPoleSud @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Just like NONE of them did. Do you please everyone, do everything people want you do do? Most of us don't. Jesus, it's called opinion! I don't agree with yours but I'll fight for your right to have it. And not agreeing with someone doesn't equate with hate. Don't exaggerate.
@ChrisPipkinSr @FedUpResistrGrL @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump How about this: I'm a 40+ year Republican and I cannot abide Trump.
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump It's funny and awful at the same time, I know what you mean! I think that no matter what are politics are it benefits us all to come TOGETHER and work on solutions. To be the solution, not the problem. Watching this stuff in Annapolis. My sister shops in that area.
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I actually was not a Seinfeld fan either. Saw it one of two times and the Soup Nazi was on.
@tisJoniMerritt @PoleNordPoleSud @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Visited 17 countries in 6 trips. Not once has he visited our military in conflict zones. And the Puerto Rico trip was a disaster. https://t.co/bX53CTRTfs	https://t.co/BO3ELlWf9P	https://t.co/GOoFMAwlRj
@lalamary45 @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You read? Forbes.
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Something about what?
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I like verifiable FACTS! It doesn't say "I'm a Nazi"! I'm also a spelling and grammar Nazi. Have you never watched "Seinfeld" and their funny struggles with the " Soup Nazi" during lunch? If you haven't I suggest improving your reading and comprehension skills.
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump I am Jewish by ancestry, Christian by faith. I have every religion in my family, including Muslim. I am not bitter, I am tired of American being torn apart by hate, stupidity, divisiveness, and scandal. The Founding Fathers must be rolling in their graves.
@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump And YOU shouldn't make assumptions! Are Jews now required to wear a Star of David sewn in their clothing in the US like they were required to do in Nazi Germany?

@luvadaone @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump You don't know what a real Nazi is. And saying that to someone whose great aunts and other family members were murdered by Nazis in Treblinka in 1944 shows what sort of person you are.
@ChrisPipkinSr @FedUpResistrGrL @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump No one hates you. We don't even really know you. But you are judged by the company you keep, said every mother and father everywhere. You're just being misled.

@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump It might be this lousy autocorrect! I've seen some very weird stuff in my posts because of it! I think I need more coffee myself. Let's get a cuppa and toast one another and to hell with politicians!
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump Well, it's hard to get past the bad he's doing. He's divisive, a known liar, his morals are questionable at best, he is a cheat in business and practices racial discrimination in his businesses.
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump I don't have a handle on WHEN the phones were destroyed. Was it before or after the request?
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump And that's exactly what I've done. I've formed an opinion of him - I don't like him and don't trust him as as far as I can throw him. Truth be told: I'm on the fence about the Clintons as well. Never been a fan there either.
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump I have absolutely no idea what she thought. I don't read minds, do you?
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/8tfGc4s0NL
@Bobbyhamilton94 @Danbeek @danadaynadaina1 @realDonaldTrump You justify all of Trump's actions. Obama wasn't perfect. No human is. The presidency doesn't come with an instruction manual with reactions outlining every contingency, any more than child rearing does. The person who states they never make a mistake is a liar.
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump I haven't made any slanderous remarks. I don't like him and there are things that I know he's done to friends in business with him but I base my feeling on those things he has said on video tape. That is what is incriminating in my eyes. His own mouth.
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump They still haven't come out with charges, have they? Most of their money acquired since out of office has been from books written and speaking engagements. But actually the person making the charge must prove it. Where's yours? Proof, not innuendo or speculation.

@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump "Crooked Hilary"??? Derisive. And there is no concrete proof. If there were at present she would be in jail. Speculation doesn't make it so. And in slander the burden of proof is on the slanderer. It is also very infantile behaviour, suitable for a bully, not a president.
@realDonaldTrump Derisive name calling again. So infantile.
@realDonaldTrump More name calling? Grow up!
@ChrisPipkinSr @danadaynadaina1 @Danbeek @realDonaldTrump Those trips were included in the final total of $114 for for the 8 years of Obama's term. It also includes trips taken by Michelle during that time. https://t.co/acDxYpAEm5

@carterbrianl @kim_carrozza @tmbogue @RWPUSA Wow, that was an old article.
@kim_carrozza @DianneandDaisy @tmbogue @RWPUSA Also confirms that "civility" is NOT a trait in Trump supporters. This is what they consistently do: bully, deride, name call, be nasty in general. As if by being bullies makes what they say valid and credible. In short, they make a joke of themselves.

@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Yes, I just hope it doesn't end up like the Japanese internment camps the military had for Japanese-American citizens in WWII. https://t.co/Bv6OHxnhgD
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump They've been there for decades, deary. Human trafficking, smuggling has been going on for centuries.

@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Well, most of us DID know that, which is why there was so much conflab when POTUS claimed he couldn't change the law. Thought he could mislead and no one would call him on it. He was wrong.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump I am. I doubt very much this wall is going to stop illegal entry. The majority of undocumented entered via work visas and simply stay once the visa expires. That is what FLOTUS did. Instead of leaving to wait for permanent status like she should have, she stayed as an illegal.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Not the same thing. They are providing living space, not going out and rounding them up.
@tacosdetocino @LMDPhoto_Design @customwww @TomiLahren They do if they know! Employers who do this are banking on the illegal not saying anything (why would they?) and American employees keeping mum to protect their own job. After all, if he's caught and shut down, they're out of a job. Self interest.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump It is a law, but he made Americans believe his POLICY of enforcement was the law. That is what he was trying to say he couldn't reverse. And Nazi ideas haven't been here, in our government, for years, but they're there now. https://t.co/oNxHtVG5WR
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump How far out into the Pacific will the wall go so they can't go around it. How high and how deep? Will it enclose the coast along the Gulf and run along the shore of every state including Florida?
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Military intervention? Explain, please. State governors are refusing to send their National Guard.

@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Actually, he never enforced the law as it was written in 1997. Neither did Clinton. Trump has been the first to enforce it as it was written and passed.
@meltingseaglass Sorry to disappoint you.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Yep. But he tried to tell the public it was a law he couldn't reverse, except policy and laws are not the same. Policy can be reversed. Law has to be vote on by Congress.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump And it is still occurring, according to some reports I read today.
@meltingseaglass You must all live in the same bubble.
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump You're defeating your own argument. Obama separated children when they entered with an adult with no proof of parentage, or entered alone. Current policy is separating verified parents from their children BEFORE making illegal crossing or presenting for amnesty at crossing points
@livingCindy @michaelleves @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump Again, you are misinformed. Try reading something that might be outside your bubble. Being ignorant is just a state of being uneducated. To be stupid, one must actively, willfully avoid being educated. https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@michaelleves @livingCindy @Ska32780 @dashiell_x @DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump And the ignorance about real life they show while doing so! I think many were raised in a bubble, isolated. And I doubt many do much reading that isn't connected with their own agenda.

@tacosdetocino @LMDPhoto_Design @customwww @TomiLahren Actually, yes, if those employers are paying them under the table.

@Dives_Et_Potens @tacosdetocino @customwww @TomiLahren We wouldn't unless they become citizens.

@LanceChamplain Why is this girl being killed by a drunk driver an issue? Just because he happened to be an illegal? I'm saying if he'd been a citizen, this wouldn't even be a blip on the radar. We accept that citizens can kill but go crazy if it's an illegal. Swallow a camel, strangle on a gnat

@LanceChamplain He went to prison for manslaughter. Wasn't long. He probably got out long ago. He walked away without a scratch on him.
@LanceChamplain And all the families who've lost loved ones murdered by citizens: Parkland parents, Pulse Night Club, Las Vegas, etc.? They simply were not "glamourized" or sold themselves to serve someone's political agenda, but does that make what happened to them more acceptable?
@LanceChamplain Yes. Not apples/oranges. The vast majority of those killed by DUI are killed by fellow American citizens. What you are citing is an anomaly, an outlier. Certainly not an everyday event. Swallow a camel, strangle on a gnat!

@LanceChamplain And my two nurse friends were still killed by a 3 time DUI White Homegrown American citizen on Welfare without insurance in a borrowed car while they were on their way home from work. Yours is not exactly a convincing argument.

@realDonaldTrump Yeah, right. Mexico is going to buy 100% of their corn and other foods from Argentina starting in 2019. It will lose our farmers BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. How is this winning?
@realDonaldTrump Is he aware that is of his state's biggest employer (BMW Volvo) may soon be heading where your tariffs can't reach?
@Dorothytooo @Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump But only if the illegal alien is within 100 miles of the border and been here less then two weeks. Otherwise, they are entitled to a court hearing with legal representation if desired.

@AndrewF03316484 @JimMcFalls @gr8america_2016 @AltNatSecAgency @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Read the document. Most of our Constitution applies to everyone, regardless of citizenship status.

@WalshFreedom @harleydavidson Malignant narcissism!
@WTFisGoingOnDon Well, if one's IQ is 70 or below, then even an IQ of 71 could appear brilliant!
@realDonaldTrump Again with the insults!!
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot You started by using insults. I don't respond well to that at all!
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot Obviously. But you make all of us look like idiots. Want to be a Republican? Then stop hurting the party with your dumb crap. Start being a thinking Republican. Engage in sensible, verifiable dialogue with people. Cut the insults and idiot memes. That impresses &amp; persuades no one
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot A thinking Republican. Which is what we all should be. My family has been Republican side coming to these shores in 1889. We've served the Republican party in State Legislatures. But we've always remained independent thinkers and always looked at both sides of issues.
@realDonaldTrump You're blaming Harley Davidson??? For circumstances YOU caused? You really are out of touch with reality! Another clear sign of dementia and narcissism!
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot God, you really are an idiot!
@DAngelo136 @kurteichenwald @PressSec Another good point. And that was a period of time when people came in droves, seeking freedom from persecution.
@DAngelo136 @NillaOfPojo @kurteichenwald @PressSec Excellent point. Obviously, and I thought this for a long time, our path to citizenship is too convoluted. I'm pretty sure that if most of the native born citizens were given the citizenship test, there would be about an 85% failure rate. Including Trump!
@DAngelo136 @NillaOfPojo @kurteichenwald @PressSec Oh, I'm with you! It just more racism. Trump has made that abundantly clear.
@rowemag @kurteichenwald @PressSec Sorry, you're right. I normally catch those mistakes. It was late, I was tired,  so I missed it. Thanks.
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot I'm not a Democrat. I'm a registered card carrying, 44+ year voting Republican. I just happen to disagree. Take your stupid and be an idiot elsewhere. People like you give us all a bad name, they think none of us are intelligent enough to have a dialogue with.
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot You do keep proving my point.
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot I see, yes, lack of education always drives Trump supporters to memes! That's why I left the Republican party after 44 years. I had too much education, so I really didn't fit any more. That's why Trump LOVES Republicans, they aren't bright enough to investigate his claims!
@whiskeysierra55 @RealWayneRoot Why? I would give you the satisfaction. But you're not real good at expressing yourself are you? Use a lot of memes, single words, pictures, and retweets? Is it spelling problems or sentence structure that stops you? Maybe it's educational issues, or the lack thereof!
Why in the world did I have to read about this sad thing in the UK Papers? Is every bloody thing here in the US about Trump and his evil minions? https://t.co/HQGc2QeJGr

@OnlyHearSeeHate @Letsget69749127 @AlishaFruits @FoxNews Well, none of the Japanese in America were doing that! and that's what's being referred to here.

@RiledEm @thehill I'm sure she took breaks. We all do. If we don't own anyone anything, they didn't owe her anything either. “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” Jesus, during the Sermon on the Mount.

@WalshFreedom I just be ill, but that's exactly how I feel. Had I been the baker of have made the cake. Thousands of people were cared for by me through my nursing career of 40+ years who never knew I might not have liked them. But they all got my very best care.
@Urfuhked @realDonaldTrump Undocumented immigrants could be deported from the U.S. without a trial if they had been in the country unlawfully for less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. But in all other circumstances, they must have a hearing. https://t.co/JXM63m322U

@realDonaldTrump Well, we're still awaiting your tax returns. Where are they, what's the problem?
@realDonaldTrump I don't think Obama, Clinton or Bush made such a cluster f**k of it!
@realDonaldTrump Yes, do away with the rule of law! Who needs laws?
@realDonaldTrump How far out into the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico will your wall go? Or do you also plan to wall in the entire southern coast? Florida's gonna love that!
@jason_waskey @thehill Yes. I'm comment on how people want to wipe out the past rather than learning from it. At the time her books were written and actually took place, her portrayals of minorities were accurate. It's an essential part of our history. Being ignorant of it condemns us to repeat it.
@leonoraOBE @cheeky_bookworm @Walgreens Nurses have faced issues like this for years:any bus uncomfortable assisting with a post miscarriage D&amp;C, Tubal ligation, or Vasectomy for religious reasons was assigned a different surgery.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @politico I'm sorry. I'm speechless. It's just impossible for me to come up with anything subtly downgrading enough to say and still remain a Christian. Momma said, "If you haven't anything nice to say, just say nothing". I'll follow that advise this time.
@ThatGrieta @kathgallagher3 @CNNPolitics @PressSec Very likely. Or at least she will get the riot act read to her be the Congressional Ethics Committee. I'm sooo glad it ain't me!
@PutrinoS8888 @DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton I don't read minds. I can't know what key you meant to hit. I bet your mom is real proud of your nastiness to people you don't know. Didn't she teach you that you get more flies with honey than with vinegar? Just mount a valid, sensible argument without name calling and bullying.
@PutrinoS8888 @DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton Why must you think that you can get your point across by being insulting? It is so offputting. Hardly makes anyone want to listen to you. And you might have something perfectly valid to say. But you can't get past the nastiness. Biting off your nose to spite your face.
@ThatGrieta @kathgallagher3 @CNNPolitics @PressSec Apparently to the ethics rules it doesn't matter. I'd didn't make the rules, Congress did. People in public service better grow thick skins because they have always been and always will be public targets. If they can't take it they should stay out of the public eye.
@PutrinoS8888 @DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec And who is Mr Unknown? If that refers to me, it's Mrs. And as to who I lead, just my own soul. Oh, and pardon me for ask a simple question. Apparently, that is verboten in America now.
@PutrinoS8888 @DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton Well, this educated college grad cannot even understand what you are attempting to say! What is "kier"? And ignorance is just not knowing something or being unlearned. To be truly stupid you have to want to be unwilling to learn. I'd rather be ignorant than stupid!
@DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton Only you can answer that about yourself.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Oh, will you stop whining!
@JRubinBlogger I'd have served her. I'd have baked the wedding cake. It's not my business to say who people marry &amp; not my business how many lies one tells while serving the Devil. It IS my business to do the best job I can, to follow my own moral compass, &amp; to know a lie when I hear one!
@stringfellowfr4 @gjwood @JRubinBlogger That statement cuts two ways.
@thehill But, now this might come as a shock: Obama hasn't been president for at least 18 months! Do they ALL live in the past? Do they realize how juvenile they're sounding: "But, Mom, Tony hit me first! " "But, Mom, he threw the rock first! ".
@NBCNews @realDonaldTrump  "Bring them back" ???? Is he going also? The proper phrasing should have been "send them back". And this is supposed to be the leader of the free world?? He can't even speak English! He sounds like an uneducated hick! Oh, wait! Could it be? YES!
@ananavarro I would have served her. I also would have baked the wedding cake. It's not my business who people marry or how many lies another tells while serving Satan.
Even those of us in West Virginia are not immune to what is happening in our nation:	https://t.co/l21JdjARIN
@deepstatesux @IngrahamAngle @PressSec Doubt it. I'd have served her had it been my place. I don't like her but she would not have known that. In my 40+ years as a nurse, I've cared for &amp; worked with hundreds of people I didn't like, whose politics I didn't agree with, but they got the best I could give.
@Letsget69749127 @thehill More like an idiot!
@WalshFreedom Ok, I can get behind that. Sometimes we can agree.
@realDonaldTrump No. Both Republicans AND Democrats need to come TOGETHER and fix the laws. But you will never support that because you will lose one of your favorite scapegoats. You are so pathetic.
@thehill @IngrahamAngle  START APOLOGIZING! You have a lot to make up for.

@amarcherrunge1 @thehill I believe that to be a personal choice to be made by a woman and her partner, not the government or people who don't know the circumstances. THEY must deal with their own ethical issues regarding abortion. It is not for you or me to force our views upon them.
@deepstatesux @IngrahamAngle Well, you are entitled to your opinion. But, they weren't doing "it" in the bakery were they? I personally would have made the cake. It's their business who they marry, not mine. I'm just in business to make a living and their money is as green as anyone elses.
@talkinstory1 @CNNPolitics @PressSec Nope, was still a personal issue.
@wedgeclamp @CNNPolitics @PressSec Actually, I'm Republican, and I know what bathroom to use. I'm just able to see the issue from a broader viewpoint.
@davidelseyofco @CNNPolitics @PressSec Except she could have gone elsewhere to eat. It wasn't the only open restaurant. So, no she wasn't starving with no other access to food.
@ThatGrieta @kathgallagher3 @CNNPolitics @PressSec No, she is tweeting a personal issue on her government sponsored Twitter account. She can tweet about personal issues all she wants on her personal account. And this was personal.
@DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton I have to say, people with no moral compass would find him refreshing. Most of us are appalled. A president needs to meet a higher moral standard to be respected. I can't respect him, he is morally bankrupt.
@DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton So it's ok that he calls people "crying Adam schiff" or "crooked hillary". It's being a bully. It's also childish. Oh, progress: country downgraded to a flawed democracy, cuts to Medicare, cuts to child health &amp; food programs, increase in racism &amp; religious intolerance. Progress?
@CNNPolitics The owner can serve who he/she wants, like the baker can make a cake for who he wants. Neither are ethically bound in any way. @PressSec is bound by an ethical standard to not use her government accounts to tweet about it.
@thehill There are no ethics in this administration. From the top on down. Sad. A president and his staff should be held to a higher ethical standard. Unfortunately, there are no standards here.
@DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton We all represent our constitution - We the People - remember? We all are guilty of acting that way, regardless of party. I'm tired of it. My opinion is that people think it acceptable because the President does it in his Tweets. But it's not acceptable, no matter who does it.
@DCottonware @IngrahamAngle @PressSec @HillaryClinton Actually it might mean I will not have to put up with people who think it's ok to constantly disparage, verbally abuse, condemn, call abusive names and generally bully anyone who might think differently or have a different opinion, religion or skin color, than they do.
@pachydermparty @20XTS14 @thehill @realDonaldTrump Read what Newt said. I shouldn't have to get nasty with you, use foul language, or disparage you in any way to get my point across. You might not agree, &amp; that's ok, I might not agree with you, but I see no reason to be vicious. The "spineless fk" rant is nonproductive for us all
@Soared4Truth @FoxNews Excellent point about the underage kids getting the parent's guns. That is what Adam Lantz did. Terrible thing, all those small children. Well, let's look at what other nations do, very few of them have these sort of shootings. Or maybe it's a culture thing.

@DailyCaller As I said twice already: not a lot of photos to use since no one's been allowed to video or photograph or interview the children. One uses what's available. But we like swallowing camels and strangling on gnats! This is a gnat.
@Soared4Truth @N3PHILIM73 @tainteddemo1 @realDonaldTrump And think of some of the people he's put in some of those positions: Pruitt, who knows NOTHING about the EPA and is very busy wasting tax money on inanities. Ditto: Carson, Devos, Neilson: who can't keep her stories straight and contradicts herself. Hardly confidence inspiring.
@Soared4Truth @N3PHILIM73 @tainteddemo1 @realDonaldTrump I don't live in NYC. And it is traditionally Democrat. Of course, lately there have been quite a few red precincts turning blue. Funny that.
@Soared4Truth @N3PHILIM73 @tainteddemo1 @realDonaldTrump The IG is biased and recused himself for that reason. We will wait for the Mueller report. I find his CV much more convincing. So, let's consider the jury still out on that topic.
@Soared4Truth @N3PHILIM73 @tainteddemo1 @realDonaldTrump Very good points. I misread and stand corrected.

@Soared4Truth @N3PHILIM73 @tainteddemo1 @realDonaldTrump Maybe I've lived a bit longer than you (I'm 66) so maybe I've seen a few more presidents &amp; promises. No, I didn't vote for him.

@Pissyfits @WhiteHouse Actually, I'm a card carrying, voting Republican for over 40 years. Not everyone who disagrees with you is Left or Democrat or any other of your nasty little childish names. Being that nasty doesn't make you credible or persuade others to think your way.
@Tomorgan74 @WhiteHouse I'm not. There will ALWAYS be extremist who will hate us and anyone like us. But this is happening at NATIONAL levels. You are naive if you are not beginning to realize that.
@pam_maranda @WhiteHouse How? We've alienated our allies, especially our border neighbors with the tariffs, are subjected from severe criticism from most nations previously friendly to us, are slowly losing our once powerful standing in the U.N. AS WELL as our once respected world status.

@eugenegu @joncoopertweets As a nurse of many years, I also was horrified to read this. Chemical restraint went out of favor years ago. A nursing home can't use it to control dementia patients, PER GOVERNMENT REGS, so why is this occurring??

@RealAlexNovelo @NJtoNYC @billmaher I agree totally. It's definitely for profit in any hospital run/established by businessmen and just about EVERY nursing home is for profit, which is why there is such crappy care for our elderly.
@NJtoNYC @RealAlexNovelo @billmaher Absolutely! I'm a nurse and my malpractice was not too bad but I was not an advanced practice nurse. My OB/GYN was paying almost $350,000/year and had never had a major law suite. When he retired he tried doing pro bono work at free clinics but couldn't afford the insurance.
@NJtoNYC @RealAlexNovelo @billmaher Not bad. Same where I'm at. I guess it's all about location, location, location!
@RealAlexNovelo @NJtoNYC @billmaher Yeah, it's pretty bad in "medically underserved" areas. People aren't going to medical school like they used to either. Practicing medicine is scary: people sue if their hang nail was cut wrong and malpractice insurance is costly: over $100,000/yr for some specialist, like OB.

@JohnnyM88007982 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Obama care protects you from being cancelled by your health care if your treatment is too expensive, or is required for the rest of your life. It allows you to get insurance even if you have a chronic and costly condition. It prevents mental health care from being capped.
@JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It was improving after the disaster left by the Bush tax cuts. Everything occurring within the first year of any presidents term is predetermined by the budget &amp; policies placed at the end of the previous term. A president sees effects of his term decisions about 3rd Q 2nd year.
@JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump MAYBE. Don't count your chickens, my dear. The play isn't over yet. Let's all just keep dialogue open. We may never change the other's mind but we can have great mind bending discussions, without name calling or anger.
@JeffMast55 @AndrewWiener11 @pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You may be. I bet we all are to one extant or another.
@perlmutations https://t.co/j280FQeIgT
@rayofliteindark @perlmutations Yep, some arrived in Baltimore at midnight last night.
@yang_so_yummi @SkipHelms1 @AlanJohnLondon @FoxNews @POTUS Did I misunderstand you?? I'm sorry. I'm sleep deprived today - too much Twitter last night. Please clarify. I'm not usually so dense!
@JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh, typical when one has NO FACTS TO ARGUE WITH! Every Trump supporter resorts to memes, gifs, and name calling when they can't support their argument. And so childish!
@JeffMast55 @AndrewWiener11 @pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump None so blind as those who refuse to see! Screaming "it's a lie" doesn't not make it so. The facts do not support you.
@AndrewWiener11 @JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I'm on a pension and SS and in Feb I got a 2% rise on each. Then, my BC/BS premium AND my Medicare deduction each went up 3%. So now, I make 2% less disposable income than I did before! And now this: https://t.co/owNhxpWtwg
@JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Oh, like the jobs Ivanka gave the Chinese in China making her clothing line, exempt from tariffs thanks to Daddy? And the ones her father gives to work visa Haitians at his resorts? And the jobs being lost with 150 Starbucks closing?
@pabloalejan @JeffMast55 @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump And the jobs at Trumps own resorts that hide HAITIAN immigrants on work visas because they work cheaper and don't mind not having benefits. Or the jobs his daughter Ivanka has given to Chinese making her clothes line in China? For the same reason, cheap no benes. Those jobs???
@pabloalejan @JeffMast55 @AndrewWiener11 @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You mean like the jobs several hundred people who work for Starbucks will be losing when they CLOSE 150 stores? Those jobs?
@JeffMast55 @AndrewWiener11 @pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Well, I kept my insurance and my doc. Sorry you couldn't. I guess your doc chose to not participate in your network? If so that happens all the time, Before and after the AHA.
@TheVictoryBell Here is what happens when children are removed from parents at the border.	https://t.co/j280FQeIgT
@TheVictoryBell It isn't FIXED! He returned it to the pre May 2018 status. But the damage is done: to Trump, to America and our world image, to us as American citizens, and, most of all, to those children.
@TheVictoryBell 1. Obama is NOT PRESIDENT!!!	2. When children were separated by Obama it happened only when they were unaccompanied or the relationship of the adult with them could not be verified.	3. The children from point 2 were fostered in homes by the HHS.	4. https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@AndrewWiener11 @JeffMast55 @pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Supported myself for over 40 years by nursing. Now retired on my pension and SS, however long that might last. Specially now this sign of our "booming" economy has appeared: https://t.co/owNhxpWtwg
Another sign of our "booming" economy?? Tax cut??		Social Security to tap into trust fund for first time in 36 years https://t.co/lkdH0IT3VI
@TomiLahren The chief dud caved.
@TheVictoryBell I see your darling caved. Sorry. It's hard when an idol falls. But he just can't stand being unpopular.
@CindyJohnston @FoxNews @POTUS I fully plan on it!!!!
@yang_so_yummi @SkipHelms1 @AlanJohnLondon @FoxNews @POTUS Then I may be a bot also. I've got no problem with disagreements, I do have difficulty with willful blindness.
@pabloalejan @domenicmusco12 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump It was better BT, Before Trump. Where are you?
@WhiteHouse Your link doesn't work! Typical.
@JoseThePaisa @WhiteHouse @POTUS Better what?
@WhiteHouse https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@StanleyBarsch @WhiteHouse @BillClinton https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@WhiteHouse So human of him to fix the crises HE CAUSED!!! Jesus, the man is a Narcissistic Pus Bag! And now he'll want adoration for doing so! Satan, come get him, he sold his soul to you long ago. Isn't it time to collect?
@SkipHelms1 @AlanJohnLondon @FoxNews @POTUS No. Two followers???? Bot a little?  https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@FoxNews @POTUS Amazing, he holds that order up so everyone can see he can do cursive script! Not answering any questions, I see. How can a mechanical Disney droid have feelings? He created this crisis and STILL refuses to take culpability! Who will rid us of this turbulent president?
@Sparta300War @GArceneaux3 @jk_rowling Danny, based on the majority of the responses here - you lost!
@Conservative_00 @ABCPolitics Obama only used the law when children were unaccompanied. And, guess what? He is not in the WH at this time!  https://t.co/39UtBYoQwy
@ABCPolitics Is not @FLOTUS Catholic? Thank you, Pope Frances.
@Brasilmagic Really??? Way to go!
@SpeakerRyan @RepKevinBrady @USTreasury @ShopFloorNAM Sorry, Herr Goebbels, your propaganda doesn't fly. https://t.co/0EsFihJlfL
@yeahunoeme @queenieF2013 @JonnoMc @marycaddell @CLewandowski_ Good! I really wish that not only do those guys not have lips, but no mouth as well! I also don't trust heady eyes!
@CLewandowski_ No, you mocked the mentally challenged child. Don't deflect or make excuses. You did exactly as you saw your Lord and master do when he mocked the disabled reporter. Monkey saw, monkey did! He was wrong, you are wrong. You are disgusting.
@thehill I do not like Trump BUT CHILDREN ARE OFF LIMITS! That is probably making her sick with worry. Peter Fonda a has burned his few functioning brain cells out with drugs years ago and suffers from the usual addict's problem of poor impulse control.
@DailyMirror This is sick.
@JamesPMorrison Thank you, well said.
@TheVictoryBell Unemployment rate trending down since BEFORE he took office. Jobs being lost every day due to business closure, worse once the tariffs hit. Ivanka doesn't manufacture her clothing line in the US, she is using Chinese cheap labor &amp; Daddy made sure not to level clothing tariffs!
@TheVictoryBell Jury still out on NK, treaties are frequently ignored &amp; it could take years to remove nukes. Hostage release was already in the works. Trade thing could rebound to bite us in the ass. Good about the vets seeing private MDs, but all the rest hasn't happened yet. Counting chickens.
@reveal @wesley_jordan I hope this isn't true. They can't even use chemical restraints in nursing homes to prevent dementia patients from harming themselves!
@TheVictoryBell It was all trending already! None are so blind as those who WILL NOT see, or even TRY TO SEE! I'm sorry, I enjoyed our discussions. But stay in your own mind since that's where you're comfortable. We wouldn't want you to to grow and become a fully actualized adult.
@KajEriksen @VeronicaxSawyer @CLewandowski_ Bazzinga!
@thehill Finally, something positive done by the Senate!
@SteveSchmidtSES @duty2warn Me also! And it's been over 40 years for me!
@realDonaldTrump Always someone else's fault. Narcissists NEVER take responsibility for anything untoward.
@realDonaldTrump YOU are the biggest threat to our safety.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Is EVERYTHING about your sorry narcissistic self? God, what a baby you are!
@TomiLahren I applaud the Border Patrol and admire their work at a very difficult job. But I don't like the job they've been ordered to do. YOU are making unfounded, untrue accusations. YOU ARE A RABBLE ROUSING TROUBLEMAKER.
@TheVictoryBell Oh, she did win the popular vote, by over 3 million.
@TheVictoryBell No. Read it at the link I sent. They look at ALL polls.
@TheVictoryBell Oh dear. You are buying the party propaganda. This was all occurring BEFORE he took office. Except the Trade war. Wherein he is busy biting off our noses to spite his face. We haven't begin to suffer from that. Reading from multiple sources might widen your horizons. Try it.
@TheVictoryBell Oh, and are you aware that Trumps over all approval rating from all polls is only 42.5%? That means the majority DISAPPROVE of him.  https://t.co/pKDxfFJdro
@TheVictoryBell What has he accomplished? I've asked this of others and it's been interesting. I'm always willing to learn.
@TheVictoryBell The economy is not doing as well as you think &amp; with the Trade war it's going to get a lot worse. The stock market is not indicative of the rank &amp; file economy. How many people will lose jobs when Starbucks closes 150 stores? GE has slipped from the Dow after 100 years. Not good.
@TheVictoryBell @DRUDGE_REPORT @infowars @DailyCaller Still got that bridge for sale!
@TheVictoryBell And TRUMP is ACTING like a Nazi regardless of his Jewish connections. I don't think that in his narcissistic view he even realizes it.
@TheVictoryBell No, you are tired of scrambling to find a convincing, credible, persuasive argument. Happens all the time with Trump supporters: they resort to name calling and insults. Much like a child. Just like Trump!
@TheVictoryBell @DRUDGE_REPORT @infowars @DailyCaller I don't do Fox. I listen to ABC nightly news, they just give those PESKY FACTS no opinions. It is neither right or left. I form my own opinions. You might try it, could open a whole new world!
@TheVictoryBell Oh my God! You've been reading Orwell and Rand. I bet you think the Freemasons and Opus Dei are involved also. And the Illuminati! Hey, I've got a bridge for sale. Let it go for a reasonable price! Stop listening to garbage and start looking at facts and doing your own thinking.
@TheVictoryBell You see, I've followed Trump since the 1970s. I've seen first hand the results of his grifting, lying &amp; cheating. His home borough of Queens didn't even vote for him. I know people who did business with him in good faith who are dead and STILL haven't been paid what he owes them.
@TheVictoryBell Yes I suppose have the narrow State Sponsored view given by Fox "Entertainment" channel would allow me to fall right into the party thinking. Then I could be as small minded as every other tiny man. Sorry. Ain't happening. I'm fighting the Cheeto Nazi with every breath &amp; thought.
@JulieForeman16 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen You know, you might actually be human and reach out to them. Teach them recycling and they can educate you on their culture. Could be a win/win! Broaden both your horizons.
@JulieForeman16 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen You're concerned about GARBAGE CANS? Dear Sweet Jesus. They may not even understand the concept of recycling. I DON'T RECYCLE! Grasping straws!	No, they aren't on farms now, it's a cultural thing!! Long time cultural heritage isn't shed in a day, or year or even a generation!
@TheVictoryBell We live in a globalist economy. Every country is dependant on every other country to some degree. All the recent TRUMP tax cuts are benefiting these huge companies &amp; TRUMP is now deregulating the banks so they can run roughshod over their clients, YOU, to benefit their investors.
@JulieForeman16 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen I bet the children are still hungry. It's not as much money as you suppose. Not with growing, bottomless pits that children can be. I bet mom &amp; dad are both working day labor jobs to supplement, paying taxes, SS, Medicare on that money they will NEVER be eligible to collect.
@Lucius14 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen That is an excellent point. And you are correct: the so called "crisis" is one of our own making. Our @POTUS has precipitated the crisis himself with the Sessions enforcement directive of May 2018 to push for his vanity Wall.
@JulieForeman16 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen I guess they aren't. Most are devout Catholics and are forbidden birth control by their religion and having large families is traditional in Latino culture. In an agrarian society, families have to be large to get the work done on the farm.
@Lucius14 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Oh, and doesn't history repeat itself!!! Here we have a wanker doing the exact same thing! And people get upset when I make Hitler/Trump comparisons. I am constantly confounded by the willful blind stupidity of my countrymen. "There are none so blind as those who will not see."
@BLS75 @Lucius14 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen I think American History teachers have some explaining to do! Obviously they haven't been teaching our history very well at all!
@Lucius14 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Yeah, well, you are an immigrant. Just like all the rest of us, unless you can trace your ancestry back to Native Americans.
@BLS75 @Lucius14 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Did we ASK the original inhabitants of this land if we could enter? No, we just waded ashore and started planting their land and building forts! Then we brought our families and friends and TOOK even more. We moved the original inhabitants to reservations of the poorest quality.
@BLS75 @Lucius14 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Your native American?
@john_1776_Lee @beewellbeebrave @Holodayyy @MacEachan @TomiLahren "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!" Have we forgotten? We have invited them.
@GinaGladden2 @lbodenleon @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Well, perhaps there may need to be some compromises made. Both parties can't possibly be so stupid as to think they can always get everything their way. Childish thinking. Compromise is always win/win. You set your priorities and compromise on smaller points, like adults.
@Lucius14 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen I bet none of us would be here! People today seem to totally forget that THEY were once illegal immigrants/aliens who were, for the most part, accepted, helped and even welcomed by Native Americans. And in typical "white superiority" we repaid them very poorly.
@john_1776_Lee @Holodayyy @MacEachan @TomiLahren Congress almost unanimously passed a law outlining Sanctions on Russia. It's still waiting to be enforced. Parents coming to our border with their children requesting asylum are thinking only to move those children to safety, away from cartels and drug wars.
@neonmom59 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen The Russian Sanctions are also laws passed by his Republican dominated Congress almost unanimously. They still await enforcement.
@lbodenleon @GinaGladden2 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen The Republicans could have introduced a bill at any time &amp; probably carried it, they are the majority. Have they done anything? There is enough guilt to go around without pointing fingers on party lines. And until we work together as Americans, there will be more guilt to share.
@TheVictoryBell Apparently you do not have my vantage point as a nurse. The last ten years or so have brought a devastation not seen in heroin addiction.I've seen, cared for, &amp; known far more opioid addicts than heroin addicts. Illegal drug addiction is far less than LEGAL, PRESCRIBED addiction.
@TheVictoryBell His Congress is primarily Republican. It's truly unfortunate that party should come into play AFTER elections when all should be focused on one thing: coming TOGETHER to do the best for the employers - The American People.
@JulieForeman16 @BLS75 @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen Good morning. Yes, the CHILD is eligible as an American citizen. It is still a citizen receiving the benefits.
@lsmart928 @BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Yep. The Versailles treaty really crushed Germany and the Great Depression sure dug them in deeper. There were a lot of factors involved. But he wrote Mein Kampf in 1924 and that where his racist side showed!
@BotFromRussia @The_Lock_God @puiwingtam @sheeraf What might they find on you, if push came to shove? If they could deport him and he didn't breaks any law here, what might be hidden in your past? Sorry. But that's how they work.
@BotFromRussia @The_Lock_God @puiwingtam @sheeraf But he was a perfectly law abiding American citizen. He broke none of our laws. He broke no laws while he lived in Germany. He was a concentration camp guard, just doing his job, allowing Jews to be murdered daily. Just following orders. Deported, but did not break our law.
@The_Lock_God @BotFromRussia @puiwingtam @sheeraf Oh, Trump especially would throw his beloved Ivanka under the bus to save himself. Hitler first targeted "useless eaters", the mentally challenged and mentally ill. Then when no one blinked he went for another "infestation",' which is what Trump is calling immigrants.
@BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Of course, we would hope it never gets that far. But it all starts somewhere and all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing. And recognizing the signs is a start!
@BotFromRussia @The_Lock_God @puiwingtam @sheeraf Yes. Really. They've deported naturalized citizens before. They revoke citizenship and out you go. They did it most recently to an elderly exNazi prison guard who was judged guilty of war crimes in WWII. He was stripped of his naturalized citizenship and deported to Germany.
@BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Mine were marched into a gas chamber in Treblinka by the Nazis. Deemed a "subhuman infestation " because the were elderly and Jewish. You might say I have more than a history book acquaintance with Nazis.
@pez1963 @BotFromRussia @FoxNews @SecNielsen Read it?
@BotFromRussia @puiwingtam @sheeraf I would expect you to not begrudge these people who didn't have your opportunities the chance to better their lives. That is why we all came. To begrudge them makes you less of the American you think you are.
@BotFromRussia @puiwingtam @sheeraf Asylum is given to people trying to escape drug cartels in Guatemala. I'm sorry all your family didn't make it. I applaud you for getting here. Most of these seekers don't have your education &amp; can't go through those proper channels in their country. So they walk to the border.
@BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen They're working on it. Didn't happen in Germany over night either. Took several years. Hitler worked on it from 1918, until he finally got to be Chancellor in 1933. Kristalnacht? Wearing Stars and pink triangles? Then the camps. My family died in Treblinka? Yours?
@BotFromRussia @puiwingtam @sheeraf There are better ways of doing this than taking small children from parents presenting peacefully at our border REQUESTING asylum. Start paying attention to what the issue really is! People who don't self educate are exhausting!
@BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Well maybe not. 47 followers? Maybe you are a bot!
@BotFromRussia @pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Why don't you educate yourself? Trump is following right along with Hitler's Bible "Mein Kampf". The parallels are right there. It's not brain surgery. Even a chump like you can read.
RT @puiwingtam: Microsoft employees posted an open letter telling the company to stop working with ICE, saying “We believe that Microsoft m…
@JamilSmith @CLewandowski_ Cory, how's that second a-hole you have now working for you? God, you are really the east end of a donkey heading west!
@FoxNews @SecNielsen I wouldn't have handled it the way they did, but I might have passed her a note reminding her what happened to the Nazis at Nuremburg who were "just doing their jobs". We hanged them for crimes against humanity!
@CuddleTalk @FoxNews @SecNielsen Right. But we're not KIDNAPPING children and holding them hostage for a bloody Wall!
@pez1963 @FoxNews @SecNielsen Yeah, the Nazis we hanged at Nuremburg were just doing their jobs also! You are sad.
@johncusack Absolutely no debate! You are 100% right!
@Amy_Siskind He looks bad, because he is!
@TheVictoryBell What? He already OWNS Congress.
