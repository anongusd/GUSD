@MetaAdamJohnson @mattyglesias Car and home insurance should be run by Gov as well then ?
@SabearcatNathan @Izengabe_ @nada_lemming @newrepublic @alex_shephard Yes indeed it is. Private schools are better.
@KFILE Why not good taxi union approved cabs? Why is the socialist supporting capitalist Uber and Lyft ?
@arindube One day I want to be important enough to have draft tweets.
@Gaussgoat @mattyglesias You can make the same argument about food. Food is a basic necessity to survive. Food shouldn’t be for profit hence all grocery stores and restaurants should be run by Gov. It’s a slippery slope to Gov run everything.
@MetaAdamJohnson @mattyglesias Why not? If Gov is so great at insurance why stop there? Why not spread the glorious gov machine and recreate NHS in US? VA for everyone.
@nada_lemming @newrepublic @alex_shephard Yep. He is not doing it openly but as any good socialist who celebrated Soviet Union I’m sure he believes in it. His supporters are doing it openly.
@Gaussgoat @mattyglesias The only way to make any service or product cheaper is by reducing regulations like patents and increasing competition. It’s just a myth that Gov can run anything more efficiently than private companies.
@Gaussgoat @mattyglesias Socialists think that they can reduce cost by letting gov take over an industry. If it’s true for healthcare why not take over all industries and make everything cheaper?
@LawrenceHall105 @mattyglesias It’s one thing to have a good faith negotiation another to call your opponent evil and sabotage a deal. Socialists generally believe that Gov can provide same services without  “greed” Bernie, AOC and other socialists do not believe in any private companies.

@gang_kazi @RoKhanna @KyleKulinski It can be funded by $12.6 tax increase per tax payer or reduction in other expenses like Defense etc.  There’s no free lunch! Pun intended.
@gang_kazi @RoKhanna @KyleKulinski Yes, taxes would be also around $12.6 per month per tax payer since only 10% of the population will need assistance at a given time.
@gang_kazi @RoKhanna @KyleKulinski Yes. Farmers already grow enough for everyone. Poor people can’t sometimes afford it. Same amount as food stamps which is around $126 per person per month.

@bae23guevara @Cox_Box_Tornado @LaterCapitalism 90% of businesses fail coz inventing something new is really hard. In order to incentivize people to invest in a business with 10% success rate they need to see 10X to 20X upside. Without that kind of upside no one will take huge risks.
@Cox_Box_Tornado @bae23guevara @LaterCapitalism All of the countries above are free market systems with a big state distribution of wealth. Basic income is a good idea and should be adopted in US to make US better.

@bae23guevara @Cox_Box_Tornado @LaterCapitalism Inequality can be reduced with a basic income.

@BadSunAK @HungryComrade @liberdead The current model works well where you own minor portions of companies through savings and your major source of income is working hard and making an income.

@ChrisSturr @sleeter2 @Karalyn2001 @ComradeStar If Gov can really reduce cost of services then we should let Gov run grocery stores, hotels, software companies, airlines and rest of the economy as well. Why stop the good thing with just healthcare ?
@ChrisSturr @sleeter2 @Karalyn2001 @ComradeStar Gov run services tend to be more expensive. Competition drives prices lower.
@SilvrdSpin @ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Bread, Cars, Rockets, Cloths the list goes on.
@sleeter2 @Karalyn2001 @ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Yeah. Plenty to learn from the best country in helathcare ranking. The Netherlands. No wait times. Universal Coverage. Best helathcare outcomes.
@MariLucia89 @TheClickPit @ChrisSturr Yeah. All unverisal coverage requires Gov paying for those who can’t afford to purchase  insurance themselves.

@king_elected @ChrisSturr @ComradeStar https://t.co/0LMsZTPrSS
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar I know, US can improve by adopting the Dutch model without adding long wait times and rationing common in Gov run models. Govs are not good at increasing supply quickly. Imagine Gov run hotels or grocery stores to get an idea how it might work.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar If Canadian health outcomes were better and wait times lower than Netherlands then I would have supported the Canadian model. When we have a proven model with universal coverage, no wait and better outcomes why not use that. Good things in life cost money.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Universal coverage
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar US can do better than Canada. US system can be made better with universal coverage like the Netherlands. Canadian style rationing is a low bar to achieve. US can do better than that.
@lovebizarre1 @Forte_x_Melody @ComradeStar Will a Gov run mall be better ?
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Yes best healthcare like best hotels tend to be more expensive than avg healthcare. Universal coverage is harder and a more important issue. Cost can be reduced easily with competition like every other product or service in life.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar If everyone eat BigMac for dinner everyday then cost of dinner will be lower as well.  The best helathcare in the world is in Netherlands and it’s privately run and has universal coverage.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Lack of competition and abundance of regulations. US also pays 120% of K-12 education via public schools. Public Hospitals won’t solve this problem.  Competition will reduce prices but some people will still need UBI to get universal healthcare.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Let me try this one last time. Let’s say hotels or hospitals are expensive due to profit motives. Find 1,000 other people who think said hotels or hospitals are expensive and start a slightly cheaper hotel / hospital.
When to use blockchain in business. https://t.co/8Vdo5tIFoF
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar The idea that profit motive drives cost is incorrect. Profit motive made food, airfare, hotels and housing cheaper and it will make helathcare cheaper as well with enough competition and reduction in Gov regulations
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Why are you not convinced? You think it’s too expensive ? UBI should include money for helathcare, housing and food.
@ChrisSturr @ComradeStar Can be easily fixed by giving a universal basic income to everyone. Everyone can have helathcare and housing and food without anyone having to deal with Gov run services.

@DrMCaligari @TIME At least then no one will complain of teachers salary. It will be what people choose to pay like nurse’s salary.

@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade Social Wealth Fund could be a good source for bootstrapping UBI. It will me more palatable than using tax money for UBI. More like social security for all that invests in stock market.
@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade We both agree Netherlands solution is better than US solution. Let’s do that. Need to convince another 60 million people.
@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade Solving inequality is not my objective. I’m OK with some people having better houses than others as long as everyone has housing. There has to be incentives for people to work hard.
@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade I disagree. Universal helathcare has already been delivered by market based solution in Netherlands. One highest quality functioning example invalidates your statement.
@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade Public Housing really? Do you really want anyone to live in public housing instead of giving them housing vouchers ?
@carpe_futurum @scottsantens @HungryComrade You don’t have to reply. Also try cash app and see who pays :) US is still free market for now.  More power to you. You can then hire more people to answer more policy questions.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade What happens if car insurance or flood insurance is shitty? I don’t think that won’t be  problem. We can easily create FDIC like backstop to rescue people who get affected by very few insurance companies which may go bankrupt in a given year.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Universal coverage means everyone will have insurance. Either they pay it themselves or get Gov subsidies to pay for it. There won’t be anyone without insurance.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade It’s less complicated than filling out 100 different forms with various agencies for basic needs. One place to get all the help needed for every citizen instead of 100.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade The only way to avoid supply constraints is to allow private providers to add supply as needed.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Problem with equity it makes wait times long for everyone. Luxembourg - “As is the case with any universal healthcare system, there are always long queuing times that can be a hassle during your trip.” https://t.co/5QqnS9lfD7
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Yeah UBI will have to be based on income and place of work to compensate for local variations. Majority of people won’t need it just like majority of population won’t need it when they are employed and only need it when they are not employed.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Not according to this  Swedish consumer group https://t.co/0LMsZTPrSS
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade It won’t be an arbitrary allowance it can be fixed to any number people decide it need to be. Could be 10K per person or 40K for family of 4 or whatever number it needs to be.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Employer based insurance is not ideal. The choices are made by HR departments and not by actual consumer. Prices would come down if people choose themselves with more competition similar to car insurance but with anti discrimination laws in place to provide same price for all.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade The best universal healthcare in the world is the Netherlands. They achieved it through subsidies for poor and a highly competitive insurance market place for others to choose the best option.  Gov run services can get universal coverage but with lower quality plus longer wait.
@HungryComrade @carpe_futurum I’m not ok with with people being homeless or without food or healthcare. I believe in universal housing, food and healthcare. I believe the most efficient way delivered that would be though a market based solution.  People would better off with Universal Basic Income.
@HungryComrade @carpe_futurum Adding a middleman (taxmen) won’t make it any more efficient. People who can’t afford it definitely need financial help to buy it but others should buy directly without Gov aid like food, housing and every other service is purchased.
@carpe_futurum @HungryComrade Yeah we need universal healthcare. People who can’t afford definitely need help to buy helathcare including dental and vision. Never understood why different parts of the body is separated out. Ridiculous!
@HungryComrade @carpe_futurum She said her mom on Medicare got 12K dental. How is that a solution. We need something lot better than Medicare.

@farnamstreet Gov cannot make anything cheaper.
@Donny_V @timbray @dhh Truth is Truth! Don’t you agree.
@Donny_V @timbray @dhh Will food be cheaper if Gov run all grocery stores? Socialists think so but everyone else know food is cheaper because of innovative processes created by private companies. Same applies to hotels, airlines, rockets, computers, schools and doctor and nurse services.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh Even US doesn’t want current US style healthcare. We will be better off with Netherlands style helathcare. US can use better outcomes and universal coverage like Netherlands without Canadian or UK wait times and mediocre service.  Learn from the best.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh Except socialist think somehow Gov employees make better choices for citizens than citizens themselves.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh Gov run airlines also appear “cheaper” sometimes they are cheaper but as an industry airlines are better off with more competition. Same with banks or hotels. Helathcare is no different.  Schools are no different.  Except socialist think somehow employees make better choices.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh I would agree that mediocre, rationed Gov service can be cheaper than higher quality service. There’s no math to support that Gov employees somehow invent better helathcare process to make the whole industry cheaper.  Private companies at least innovate to get cheaper.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh Helathcare is no harder than rocket science. Rockets became cheaper with private competition. If people are allowed to choose insurance it will become cheaper. If we punt choice to “Gov”. Gov employees are also people who just have less incentive to pick the best option.
@chrissyteigen Kids love a drunk mom excuse. Great start!
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh US helathcare could come down in cost if there are more insurance options to choose from like Netherlands. 15 plus options for every citizen to choose from as opposed to a handful elected by HR departments of employers who really don’t care as much as employees themselves.
@timbray @Donny_V @dhh Yes, Gov run services are usually mediocre and subsidized and “cheaper”.  The best hotels in the world are more expensive than the “mediocre” Gov run hotels. The goal should be universal coverage and best outcomes. US services will never be cheapest in the world.
@Donny_V @timbray @dhh Do you really believe that Gov regulations reduce prices? How do you reduce price for food or housing or cars or cloths? Competition or Gov regulations? If you think Gov can “fix” prices then you don’t understand how markets work. You are a true socialist!

@JewdyGold Surgery. Lots of them.
@brahim_doc @JackRNewhouse @bootrag @PFTompkins It’s legal but it’s not a good idea to let giant corporations to be arbitrators of what speech is acceptable or not. It’s better for users to rank content themselves and promote content they like by like / up-voting them. Democratic solution to address the same issue.
@timbray @dhh US definitely fails in coverage. The goal should be universal coverage with best outcomes. You can always lower cost by giving mediocre care to everyone. https://t.co/0LMsZTPrSS
@timbray @dhh You can give enough to be able to buy basic insurance for people who can’t afford to by. The best helathcare in the world is in Netherlands and they have the efficiencies of private market with Gov support for poor.
@dhh Not true. Majority of Veterans Affairs Receipts would rather have the money to go to private hospitals. Netherlands has great universal healthcare through private service providers.
@dhh Libertarianism is much better as it promotes social services in the form of basic income without Gov agency take over.
@dhh The biggest problem with socialism is promoting the idea that private enterprises cannot services well and Gov agencies should take over those services. Start with 20% of GDP, healthcare then move on to banking etc.
@dhh The best way to deliver services to the poor is to give them money to buy those services unlike what socialists want which is to nationalize those services.
