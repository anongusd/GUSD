WH official who was in Day 16 room: “Exact phrase ‘we do not dispute your facts’ was used multiple times” by the Dem aides.		@VP on Day 17 cited the comments as the foundation for reaching solutions.		Day 18 of shutdown, Trump side and Dem side can’t agree on what they agree on.
Pence told us he was struck that the Dem staff on Sunday “actually used the phrase that they did not dispute our facts about the border.“		Actually: Dem staff just didn't contradict VP. Because Pelosi/Schumer already made clear they  disputed some of a similar WH presentation.
The law also allows the Defense secretary to terminate or defer construction of Army civil works projects during a national emergency.		That again risks a political backlash because the $7B Congress has devoted is mostly for important commercial routes and flood risk management.
If Trump diverts any of the $10.3 billion in military construction funding, it would mean sidelining projects for military families, @justinsink notes. 		$1.6B of that budget is slated for family housing, $352M for medical facilities, and $267M on educational facilities. https://t.co/vmykcIgzJ1

Trump has "made no decision on that,” Pence tells us when asked if Trump will pursue a national emergency declaration. "What I'm aware of is that they're looking at it and that the president is considering it." Says he wouldn't want to go beyond what Trump has said on the topic.
Pence told reporters the Trump administration wants statutory change to allow children to apply for asylum at embassies in other countries, which would require personnel changes at State Dept.
The reason Trump is asking for more money now for the border than in his proposed budget is because "things have gotten a lot worse," Pence says. Even the @washingtonpost reported over the weekend there's a "bonafide" crisis, he says.
Pence, in a briefing with reporters, says he's hopeful the shutdown can be resolved, but Democratic leaders need to accept Trump's invitation to come back to the WH this week "and start negotiating."

NEWS: In a heads up to @realdonaldtrump and Congress committees, Cohen lawyer Lanny Davis says after Mueller probe is final, Cohen will "state publicly all he knows about Mr. Trump." 		"Mr. Trump’s repeated lies cannot contradict stubborn facts."
COHEN SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS IN PRISON. 		Also hit with forfeiture of $500,000, restitution of $1.4 million and a fine of $50,000.		As judge read sentence, Cohen closed his eyes and shook his head slightly as if in disbelief, Bloomberg News reports.
The judge says Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to a "veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct" motivated by "personal greed and ambition." 		MORE: https://t.co/Qrc6ooOvIK
COHEN, audibly emotional, says to people of US: "You deserve to know the truth and lying to you was unjust.”		Trump "publicly mocks me, calling me a rat and a liar.''		Cohen says wants to ensure that when history of Trump is written Cohen not recorded as "villain of his story."
MICHAEL COHEN in court: "I take full responsibility for each act."
"After cheating the IRS for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the presidential election, Cohen’s decision to plead guilty--rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes--does not make him a hero," NY prosecutors said in court papers. https://t.co/09AfrD8vkM

On a government shutdown, Trump said: "If we don't get the wall money, a very possible shutdown."

Q: IF COHEN WAS SUCH A BUM WHY DID YOU HIRE HIM?		"Because a long time ago he did me a favor," Trump told us.
"It just wasn't set up," Trump said when asked about meeting at G20 with Saudi Arabia's crown prince MBS, who the CIA says likely directed the Khashoggi murder. "I would've met with him. We just didn't have time."
"I probably will be meeting with President Putin," Trump told us. "I think it's a very good time to have the meeting." 		But he will be getting "a full report" on the Russia-Ukraine situation on AF1 on his way to Argentina, and that will determine whether he meets with Putin.

Despite Trump's congratulatory tweet on BMW, the car company has not yet committed to building a new plant in the U.S. 		CEO Harald Krueger said Tuesday that a second site in the U.S. is just a maybe. No firm plan, @ElisBehrmann reports. 		https://t.co/rAQHEx4BG5 https://t.co/PzM754sp0W

Jordan Karem was on campaign trail with Trump the day before the midterm elections this month when he got the news that his father had died, aides told me.		Michael Karem was an advance staffer who worked for 4 GOP presidents—Nixon, Reagan, both Bushes.		https://t.co/roE90EoLHC
Scoop: John James, the Michigan businessman who ran for U.S. Senate this year, is one of the people that Trump is considering as a replacement for UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. 		@JohnJamesMI lost his challenge against Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow.
Karem was chief of staff to an Arizona utility company CEO, Pinnacle West’s Don Brandt, before he joined Trump’s campaign in July 2015.		He plans to stay in DC, I’m told. (Not returning to Arizona.) 		He has told colleagues he doesn’t intend to write a book.
Unsurprisingly, the role of body guy isn’t a typical one in this White House. Trump leaned on Jordan Karem for many tasks, including weighing in on matters on Trump’s mind—policy, staffing, politics, etc—and relaying messages to contacts inside and outside WH.
Jordan Karem gained a reputation for being forthright with Trump, sometimes brutally honest. (One of the few willing to do that.)		He’s 1st aide to see Trump in a.m. and last aide to see him at night—greeted Trump outside his room and walked him from Oval back to the residence.
NEWS: Jordan Karem is leaving post as Trump’s body man and director of Oval Office operations. He ascended in the White House ranks from a rank-and-file advance aide to one of Trump’s confidants.

Trump on “Fox News Sunday” confirms he’ll find new post for the embattled Mira Ricardel. 		“I met with Mira 2 days ago....we’re going to move her around because she’s got certain talents. But, frankly, she is not—she’ll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way.”
“We’re in solidarity, sir.” — Fox News’s Chris Wallace on journalists standing together as Trump says some reporters are the “enemy of the people” and others aren’t.

Two others in the chambers for Brett Kavanaugh's ceremonial investiture: Judge Merrick Garland, who was nominated by Obama to the Supreme Court, only to be blocked in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. 		Also in the room today: Mitch McConnell.
As the White House press corps was escorted out via a hallway behind the Supreme Court chambers, a clerk called out: "You've got justices on your left," and Neil Gorsuch, Samuel Alito and others walked past us. Clarence Thomas was to our right, adjusting his street clothes.
Among those in the very full room for Kavanaugh's investiture ceremony: retired Justice Anthony, Trump's first White House counsel, Don McGahn, U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh's voice was strong and carried throughout the chamber.		Chief Justice Roberts extended a "very warm welcome" to Kavanaugh and wished him "a long and happy career."
"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General," Roberts told Whitaker. 		Roberts then administered the judicial oath. 		Kavanaugh: “I, Brett M. Kavanaugh, do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich..."
Chief Justice John Roberts said: "We are pleased to have with us today the president of the United States." 		Whitaker stood and said, "If it may please the court..." and moved that the commission, signed by then-AG Jeff Sessions, be made part of permanent record of the court.
DETAILS from investiture ceremony: Brett Kavanaugh sat in same chair used by each member of court since 1972 -- the chair of Chief Justice John Marshall from 1819 to 1835. 	After Kavanaugh entered at 10:01a, there was a short pause, then audience asked to stand as Trump entered.

Melania Trump’s four-nation Africa tour is a wrap. https://t.co/IluSj28RLF
Melania posed for a photo shoot on a overlook by the pyramids as dramatic music (orchestra with a thundering base beat) played and a local dance troupe, like you might see in the Cairo Opera House, performed. 		The dancers were a surprise, her aides said. https://t.co/tJA3uUQ2ik
Very tight security here in Cairo for FLOTUS. Pres Trump impressed upon el-Sisi when they talked at UNGA that Egypt should take good care of her. 	Melania was swarmed with security agents at all her stops. Egyptian security even climbed high on Khufu pyramid to keep a look-out.
Melania toured Pyramid of Khufu, biggest of 3 great pyramids of Giza. 		She went inside, just for 5 minutes, not all the way to tomb.		(The shaft has no hieroglyphics or decoration. You walk upright for 40 ft then crouch. Leads to sarcophagus.	It’s really hot in there, I’m told.) https://t.co/Vzh8wp2rf7
Asked her best accomplishment on this 4-country Africa trip, Melania Trump told us: “That we care.”
Asked at the Sphinx in Egypt if she believes Christine Blasey Ford, MELANIA Trump says: 	“We need to help all the victims no matter what kind of abuse they had. I am against any kind of abuse of violence.” https://t.co/LzpQnRcD1W
Asked about perception she tries to influence Trump:,	“Well, I don’t always agree what he tweets. and i tell him that. i give him my honest opinion. and honest advice. sometimes he listens sometimes he doesn’t. ... it’s very important for me that i express what i think.”
MELANIA on POTUS’s “shithole” remark: “I never heard him saying those comments and that was anonymous source and I would leave it at that.”
BREAKING: Melania Trump, asked at Sphinx about Brett Kavanaugh: “i think he’s qualified for the supreme court. i’m glad that dr ford was heard. i’m glad that judge kavanaugh was heard. and that the fbi investigation was done. it’s completed.”
Melania is taking questions from reporters — a rarity. 		She answered our questions for about a minute at the slave castle in Ghana, did a private interview with ABC News, and spoke to us off-record on Air Force One. 		She also made very brief public comments at four events here. https://t.co/LiK89Tt3SX

Local officials in Egypt told me they hope FLOTUS visit is an engine for tourism. 		Tourism is down about 7 million people a year since the peak just before the revolution in 2011 — because visitors worried about instability, lack of law and order, petty crime, sexual harassment. https://t.co/Mjb7BEAydU

Until Melania’s visit, it was taboo to allow a disabled person inside Emintsimadze Palace, or close to royalty, diplomatic aides told us.		The king felt that was wrong, so he went to a school for deaf to invite kids for 1st lady’s event.		In yellow: one deaf guest, one blind. https://t.co/gX1tPgL0eU
