3 Something needs to change because most Americans, including federal workers, are living paycheck to paycheck. When we all make a living wage &amp; have access to affordable healthcare there should be less of a need for welfare.
2 When welfare is used correctly it works as it was designed to. My husband &amp; I are proof of that. We used welfare when he was hurt on the job &amp; while we went to court bc his company refused to pay workers comp. Once we were back on our feet we came off it.
1 It's not petrifying to help someone in need when you have compassion &amp; empathy.  It's time to redefine that dirty word socialism...or make a new word. Those that need help should be able to get it without rich ppl acting like they are better then them. https://t.co/lzzoEXcHwC

I didn‚Äôt know anyone that worked in the Twin Towers, the Pentagon or anyone who was on any of the 4 planes that were used in the attacks, but I wept for them along with the rest of the nation &amp; I still do whenever we pause to remember that day.
We knew someone from church that worked in NY &amp; took the train so we waited anxiously to hear if he was safe. It turned out he was stuck on a train &amp; never made it into NY. A blessing in disguise for him &amp; his family.
That night, I was watching TV in my room &amp; saw George W. Bush‚Äôs address of the nation. I hadn‚Äôt really cared for him &amp; his bumbling of speeches up until that point but this time he made an impression on me. He was calm, resolute &amp; that gave comfort.
I know we drove back home at some point &amp; our parents eventually got home from work, but I really don‚Äôt remember anything from Wendy‚Äôs on until that evening.
Jessica took me &amp; our younger two siblings, Alan &amp; Amanda to Wendy's. After getting food at the drive thru, we sat in the car and listened to the news on the radio. We were all in disbelief.
By the time I got home, all my siblings were already there.  My parents were still at work but we were finally able to talk with my mom. She said they were not allowed to leave work &amp; told the four of us kids to stay together or something like.
I don‚Äôt remember whether or not the train was running at 2nd &amp; Spring Garden but it must not have been because from that point I walked all the way home to my parents' house in Fishtown.
I tried to take SEPTA to get home, but all the buses were filled to the brim &amp; not stopping. I starting walking down Spring Garden St towards the River Front hoping that maybe further down I could catch a bus.
I couldn't find my older sister Jessica ‚Äì she drove us that day. I tried calling her but my cell phone wasn‚Äôt working. I walked to the parking lot where we had parked that morning but she had already left.
Finally, someone popped their head in the door &amp; said we were evacuating CCP. It turned out ALL of Center City was evacuating. It was believed at the time that anyone of the high rises in Philly could be next.
After Jazz History, I went to my English class &amp; waited for the professor to show up. She was late, as usual. The door to the classroom was open so the rest of the class &amp; I were all waiting at our desks for maybe 20 mins or so.
They were adamant that it was bigger than "just an accident" but there was no panic and we went to class. I honestly don‚Äôt remember what Dr. Lewis even taught that day.
I said, ‚ÄúMaybe it was just an accident,‚Äù thinking it was a small jet. I can remember the seriousness on their faces. I had chatted often with these professors &amp; they were always so light-hearted outside of class.
‚Ä¶with Dr. Kovach &amp; Dr. Lewis in their shared office before Jazz History (taught by Dr. Lewis) like I always did when I was early. Dr. Kovach &amp; Dr. Lewis were listening to a broadcast on the radio &amp; discussing a plane that hit a building in NY...
