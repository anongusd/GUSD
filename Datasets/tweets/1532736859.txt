I don’t want you to have to guess about My intentions. I want to make you laugh/cry as we tackle some big stuff. And If you don’t agree with me, I want you to be able to say, “at least that bitch is honest.” Thanks G.U WADE https://t.co/JvCLnMxcYZ
Being right is overrated. You can be right and be miserable. You can win every battle, but your relationships are being damaged. Sometimes you have to let the other person think they’re right, even when you know they’re wrong, just for the sake of peace.

Never let failure get to your heart and never let success get to your head.
Some of the things we go through that we don’t understand are not going to make sense right now because we can’t see the big picture, but God knows what He’s doing. He’s positioning you so you can carry out His purpose. Trust Him knowing that He’s ordering your steps.

Who told you that you’re not going to love again? Who told you that you’re not going to be healthy again? Who told you that you’re not going to accomplish your dream? Don’t believe those lies. Start looking again. Start dreaming again. Start believing again.
L'amour ne se limite pas à ressentir une attraction pour un homme ou une femme. 	L'amour véritable est un état de conscience qui nous pousse à faire le bien autour de nous.

Don’t be discouraged by opposition, be encouraged by it. On the other side of difficulty is a new level of your destiny.
Someone who really loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, how hard u are to handle, but still wants u in their life.

When you have big dreams, you’re going to have big challenges. If you were an average person you would have average problems.
Sometimes life is unpredictable. It dictates things that you do not want to pursue

As life goes on Im starting to learn more and more about responsibility	And I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me.
Sometimes you will realize that some questions you have about life will remain unanswered and accept the fact that many mysteries you want
Learn to be grateful for what you have now and always remember that things you have now are those that you once wished for.
