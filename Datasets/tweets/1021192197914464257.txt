@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa *works
@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa They are not big words or catch phrases; this isn't a campaign, snarky comeback fest, or popularity contest. This is how KNOWledge words. We have to start on common ground. Facts, logic, provable, testable, etc. If as intelligent beings we can't start there, we can't start.
@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa *doesn't necessitate a wall. 		Lowest levels in years the facts show. And apprehensions ≠ illegal.	Claiming Asylum is not illegal because this is United States of America.
@Tymac31 @tinamd55 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa You were talking about DRUGS, champ. 		Continually changing 'lanes' doesn't help your case; in reality it makes it appear as if you don't have one.
@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa Yep. We see you 'winning' the same way @realDonaldTrump does... By dancing around claiming failure as victory in alt world. Enjoy the safe space of alternative facts in the alt #MAGA reality. The rest of us are watching it crumble before our eyes. We see your/their failures.
@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa None of which support your claim, even if they were/are correct stats. You can't prove what is coming in thru unsecured borders, therefore you can not prove the need for wall.
@Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa I don't have to. You made claims. Facts do not support your claims. This is how things are tested in a FACTS BASED REALITY when a claim/statement is made. It is tested with KNOWABLE FACTS. There are even academic procedures to test the LOGIC of an argument. You've failed.
@Tymac31 @brutalityofwar @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa We are at record lows for illegal entries. That doesn't say anything as to 'we must have wall now'.
@Tymac31 @sryforurloss @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa You were talking about Chapo. It's hard to keep you on subject, even worse trying to get you to the whole 'FACTS to support your claims' thing.
@Tymac31 @ehahn5_shirk @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa So you don't have ANY supporting FACTS that these big scary things are pouring into our country in between the ports of entry necessitating your 'we must have wall now' claim. 	😉 got it
@tinamd55 @Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa Where could I find details of this story?		And how big is a 'bunch'?	Is it as much as drugs as there are packed in a tractor trailer that coming through the ports of entry on produce trucks??
@rick072670 @Tymac31 @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa Assumptions ≠ facts.		You do not have FACTS to support your claim. Failure at the 'proof' stage.		In addition, you also claimed those same facts are unknowable. You are proving the  hole in your own argument.		Continuing to type voluminous responses will not change the above.
@Tymac31 @ehahn5_shirk @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa Still waiting on your supporting facts....	Insulting people isn't going to come change her point, or the lack of yours.
@Tymac31 @sryforurloss @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa Through tunnels, planes, ports of entry, boats, subs, etc. Check the facts of his case.		A wall isn't stop those if you think about it...
@Tymac31 @brutalityofwar @pjwgenealogy @Oil_vampire @Circa It's owned property. I'm not ok taking citizen's, company, or an organization's property for a wall that stats (facts) do not prove is necessary. You do not have proof that these big scary terrible things are 'pouring' in to the country. You're watching too much Faux News on Fox
