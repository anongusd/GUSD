@JeffSadosky @danpfeiffer Yeah, definitely. And tonight will be a miss. But we do remember Oval addresses for a reason. They're different than Roosevelt Room remarks.
@danpfeiffer Respectfully disagree. Presidents have access to backdrops that enhance a message, as you know. Rose Garden, West Front, East Room and the Oval. The history adds gravitas as does prime time.

Watching McCain be carried into the Capitol where so many colleagues and friends will pay their respects is a reminder that there really is a lot of love and humanity in that building.
When Daniel Inouye was lying in state, I stumbled upon a private moment where Bob Dole was escorted in to an empty rotunda to see his friend. It was quite sad and beautiful.

Yes people probably take them too seriously...but...I was also raised to indeed take the president seriously. So here we are.
So it's clown nose on clown nose off. If he tweets something that gets a bad reaction - just a tweet. Good reaction - presidential statement.
Who knows what foreign governments think, considering the rhetoric he employs there, but my guess is they take them seriously.
Media and political professionals consider them presidential statements, as his spokespeople have described them. (I'm here)
Speak to a rank and file Republican voter and they compartmentalize them and think DC media/elites overly obsess over them.
The debate over the seriousness of Trump tweets remains as unresolved as the day he was inaugurated given today's 'just his opinion.'

And if you think everyone should just altruistically do precisely what you want and their voters don't...well, I can't convince you of human nature here.
So instead of yelling 'F your career' at them, maybe tweet them an attaboy when they speak out. Create incentive for others to follow suit.
I accept that most don't like the word 'career'. So let's just say 'position'. If you want to be in public service, it's harder to do so if you lose an election.
And if you're being attacked at home by constituents and by the left and by the media, guess what...those are signals to not engage.
If you want GOP members to oppose Trump but attack them when it's short of shutting down the Senate, human nature will tell them 'better to stay quiet'

@DammitJoey @PoliticalKel Harry Reid was the Majority Leader at this time. Harry Reid is a Democrat.
@JeremyKonyndyk The false choice of agreement or war was never a credible argument IMO.
@JeremyKonyndyk Again, Twitter is a tough platform to re-negotiate the JCPOA, but here's a start: https://t.co/iU3yao5gSD
@JeremyKonyndyk My standard is: Negotiate deals that are near the mainstream of political thought, especially when the latter is bipartisan. That's not a high bar.
@jonathanweisman @PoliticalKel I have no idea the connection here. If the argument is that the Senate has a hard time on ratification...that was first rejected treaty in 14 years.
@JeremyKonyndyk Well those 3 questions require more than a tweet. But we don't know on 2014 because WH went *into* negotiations already abandoning Congress.
So if we're asking what the "world" is learning it's this: make sure any agreement with the United States is ratified in Congress.
President Obama's problem wasn't just Republicans. He couldn't get Democratic support for the Iran deal.
It's almost as if everyone warned the Obama administration in 2014 that an Iran deal not able to be ratified by the Senate was a mistake. https://t.co/sMq54QstBs
