@CONSMILITIA @Smashingsocial1 @LibertyHangout And we have many of those organized militias. All the branches of the military in addition to local police departments. We, as private citizens, have no reasonable or realistic need for a grassroots militia. None.

Earmarks are provisions in legislation that require certain expenditures of allocated funds. These provisions offer incentive for legislators to support a bill since it benefits their district, which is why we need them now more than ever given the current partisan divide.
John Boehner and Mitch McConnell banned earmarks in 2011 in an effort to reduce spending and improve trust in government.		Earmarks account for less than 1/2 a percent of total government spending, and trust in government has gone down since their ban.	https://t.co/quPmq4Nw1G

@The_JJAllen @IlhanMN It‚Äôd be nice for everyone to have equal access to university, but that‚Äôs just not the reality we live in.
@The_JJAllen @IlhanMN K-12 &amp; college are very different. K-12, required by the law and a public good, provides everyone the basics for life &amp; a job. Higher ed is about specializing in, studying, and becoming an expert in a specific subject.
@IlhanMN In terms of college I am ‚Äúpoor‚Äù. I could barely have afforded an associate‚Äôs degree from Ivy Tech. I am fortunate to be attending Purdue on a scholarship because I worked hard. Yes being poor sucks &amp; I can relate, but still: if you can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt go.
