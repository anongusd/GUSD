June is Pride Month! AFA-CWA supports all LGBTQ Flight Attendants and workers in their fight for protections on the job and in their communities.
Today, we remember the Pilot and 10 passengers who perished as American Airlines Flight 1420 crashed upon landing at Little Rock Int'l Airport in 1999. Four Flight Attendants were among the 134 people to survive the crash. We remember this day with them and all of their families. https://t.co/MOBD8eHiQS

39 yrs ago today, American Airlines Flight 191 crashed shortly after takeoff from Chicago’s O’Hare Int'l Airport. All 13 crew members and 258 passengers onboard were killed, as were two people on the ground. Today, we pause to remember those lives lost. https://t.co/NFQylJlAba
There are four important considerations when designing and producing a new uniform for Flight Attendants: Style and Image, Wearability and Durability, Security, and Health and Safety. https://t.co/jcsbTw3Ro6 https://t.co/Mb3N8oPmnk
Health hazards posed by uniforms is a newer issue stemming from the rapid rise in purchasing uniforms made overseas. 20 yrs ago, most Flight Attendant uniforms were made by fabrics produced in the US. But trade agreements have moved production overseas. https://t.co/jcsbTw3Ro6 https://t.co/WBAwx7KLW7
