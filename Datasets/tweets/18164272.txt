@fivefifths Just because something is good or enjoyable doesn't mean it belongs in this particular piece/book/whatever.
@fivefifths One of the most important rules about editing anything is that sometimes you have to kill good material (or in this case, fans' favorite characters) to make the overall story work.
@fivefifths Season 7 was mostly fan service — which is especially hilarious because ASoIaF is set up as a pretty explicit critique of fan service in fantasy writing.

@fivefifths Say what you will about Martin (who desperately needs an editor), but he has a mission and a message. The show writers eventually lost sight of that once they were on their own.
@fivefifths Season 7 was Very Bad.
@fivefifths This also goes to the point that the show is Bad Now.
@fivefifths My fondest hope is that Littlefinger meets a different fate in the books than he does in the show.

A high net-worth individual is a rich man or rich woman. Zero-percent financing means an interest-free loan."
Decommissioning weapons means disarming. Being economical with the truth famously means lying.
The army is accused of committing numerous human-rights abuses probably means The army is accused of torture and murder.
It is sometimes useful to talk of human-rights abuses but often the sentence can be rephrased more pithily and accurately.
France’s proposed solidarity contribution on airline tickets is a tax. The British solicitor-general’s evidential deficiency is no evidence, and George Bush’s reputational problem just means he is mistrusted.
Enron’s document-management policy simply meant shredding. The Pentagon’s practice of enhanced interrogation is torture, just as its practice of rendition is probably torture contracted out to foreigners.
But a good writer owes something to plain speech, the English language and the truth, as well as to manners….
This does not mean that good writers should be insensitive of giving offence: 	on the contrary, if you are to be persuasive, you would do well to be courteous.

Yet without fail pundits seem to blame the *activists* for.... Having opinions? Participating in politics?		If you think an institution's response to political pressure is bad you should blame the people in charge of that response.
Politics happens. Pressure comes from different groups for different reasons, and targets vary widely. What determines outcomes is how powerful decision-makers (university administrators and trustees, Fox and its advertisers) respond to political pressure.
The Tucker Carlson boycott is a good example of a situation like when students protest controversial speakers on college campuses where everyone gets confused about who actually has decisionmaking power. Political activists are not the relevant decision-makers in either case.

One could also argue that half a million could reasonably be expected to buy loyalty even after the formal termination of the agreement (if Flynn's timeline is accurate). Flynn would no doubt argue he would've advised against arming YPG even if he hadn't been paid by Turkey.
I should note that Flynn's (late) registration as a foreign agent claimed that he stopped working as a Turkish agent in mid-November 2016, about two months before Flynn advised Trump to delay attack on ISIS. Turkish payments to Flynn weren't publicly known at that time.

@dylanmatt I imagine Flynn's defense would've been that the YPG are terrorists and he would've advised against arming them even if he wasn't being paid by Turkey (i.e. the classic lobbyist defense).
@dylanmatt If you want to make a case that Flynn committed treason (which I'm not sure is useful), the Turkey/ISIS stuff is by far the best example. We *are* at war with ISIS. https://t.co/q2u7h0ITuD
I am shocked by how often people forget that the president's national security adviser was secretly working for another country when he told the president not to attack ISIS.
Yeah, let's not forget that Flynn reportedly advised Trump to *HOLD OFF ATTACKING ISIS*, presumably because Turkey, the country secretly paying Flynn, didn't want the U.S. to arm the Syrian Kurds. Trump agreed, delaying assault on ISIS capital for months: https://t.co/aXF5NSxhD2 https://t.co/LZXsFvTut5
