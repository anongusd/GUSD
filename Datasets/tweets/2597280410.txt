15/ Eight years since writing the above, women are still risking their lives to come forward. These men are merely risking their power, and even that seems too much for them to bear. Whatever comes of today, this is another testament to the strength of survivors.
14/ if that is still the case then he must take the allegation against him  seriously and understand that allowing himself to maintain his position  of power is an example of using his male privilege to dismiss the issue  of violence against women.
13/ He has claimed to support women‚Äôs rights;
12/ To end sexual violence we must build a culture that validates and respects women and defines masculinity in terms other than aggression and violence.
11/ Or do we acknowledge that we live in a culture where sexual violence is more prevalent than we choose to see?
10/ Do we create an atmosphere where women are intimidated and blamed for coming forward? Do we value a man‚Äôs word over a woman‚Äôs? Do we scapegoat perpetrators as monsters and ignore the larger social conditions that contribute to an atmosphere that breeds sexual violence?
9/ There is more at stake than character and reputation. The question we need to ask ourselves is, ‚ÄúHow do we address this form of violence?‚Äù
8/ The question we want to ask when finding out that a friend, colleague and leader is alleged to have attempted to rape a woman is, ‚ÄúCould he really have done this?‚Äù
7/ The standards of masculinity that promote aggression and dominance are taught through the media and popular culture, and we are all exposed to these influences.
6/ Rape culture is everywhere in our society, from movies and music to magazine ads. Rape culture is even seen in the belief that, when a woman turns a man down, she is simply ‚Äúplaying hard to get‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt really mean it when she says ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù
5/ This is based on another dominant assumption that only crazy people and perverts commit sexual crimes. That is not the case.
4/ Women face even more interrogation when the perpetrator is someone they know, particularly if it is a person with influence or power.
3/ "The common reaction women receive when reporting sexual assault is disbelief and blame. That is why sexual assaults are hardly ever reported, let alone prosecuted and convicted.
2/ Wrote this about rape culture in 2010, before we successfully pressured the #UniversityofCalifornia student regent to step down after an allegation of sexual assault. We have come a long way with #MeToo but we still live in a culture of sexual violence https://t.co/Dd3rGwSwh3
