Compliance hearing reveals existence of 15,000 pages of new #Benghazi documents never released to Congress.
So, let me be as clear as I can be, we intend to access all of the information necessary to do the job the House instructed us to do
The pace at which this process is moving is not conducive to the Committee’s work.  It should not take a public hearing to make progress
New docs are precisely the reason the Speaker constituted a Select Comt: to produce a complete, definitive record for the American public.
These new docs are a reminder no previous Cmt compiled or had access to a complete record of the events
The purpose of today’s hearing is to hear from agencies about compliance w/ requests for documents &amp; access to witnesses.
The House asks this Cmt to investigate: “all policies, decisions &amp; activities” related to the attacks… the operative word  is “all."
Hearing today: WATCH LIVE at 10:30 am http://t.co/d0w2fhtZxP http://t.co/IKuGhiBIQL
Hearing today: This is about ensuring Exec branch transparency, accountability &amp; timely cooperation w/ Cong oversight http://t.co/d0w2fhtZxP
Hearing tom. on requests to agencies: Because we cannot do our job without obtaining a complete record of the events. http://t.co/WlzChigG17
The Cmt is continuing probe into all aspects of #Benghazi &amp; is currently focused on access to all first-hand accounts http://t.co/OINZpElpJd
