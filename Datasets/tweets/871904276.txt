@realDonaldTrump Out of curiosity, what is a "hardened" Democrat? In contrast, what is a hardened Republican?
@KarenJimmerson @LCPSOfficial I left P'ville for Chantilly at 7AM. Got to Leesburg and turned around. Not worth it.

@TrumpRockNRolls @realDonaldTrump Good!
@realDonaldTrump Did you happen to hear about the school shooting in Kentucky yesterday? 	Just wondering, since you managed to tweet about everything else that bothers you, but not your condolences and sympathy for the victims - much less any resolve on your part to even try to solve this crisis.
@realDonaldTrump And I would say, saying all of that, or even feeling the need to, completely disproves the very point you think you‚Äôre making. Step down and seek help.
@realDonaldTrump You truly are an idiot, aren‚Äôt you?
@OrrinHatch @SpencerJCox @rudygobert27 @sltrib Nice try. We all know you meant the Utahn of the year article because you thought it was praising you.

@wusa9 #offscripton9 I was raised to believe the ‚Äún‚Äù-word is one of the worst words anyone can use. I‚Äôm not comfortable hearing anyone use it.	But I‚Äôm not going going to dictate to minorities whether or not they can use words in their culture that white society labeled them with.
@RepCicilline @cspan Good luck with that!

@KarenJimmerson @JessicaPost When there was no party presence at any fairs, Oktoberfest, or other community events, that‚Äôs on the party.

@RealSheriffJoe @realDonaldTrump You are aware that, according to The Supreme Court, accepting a pardon is a legal admission of your guilt, right?

@juliemason @timkaine Just asking the question? You just seem to have gotten very gleeful when playing the spoiler or Devil's Advocate.
