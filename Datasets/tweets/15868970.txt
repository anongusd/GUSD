Ultimately, @OurHomeSF passage will enable us to house and help
@asmallteapot @JaniceForBART @sfmta_muni That's true.  It took time to win approval as the proposed escalator was initially challenged because of a technical consideration.  I was grateful that this was overridden at the top and we are now moving forward.  I will request schedule and hope it's not years away.

@TheGlamazonPDM Pollo, there are 1,000 people on the waiting list for shelter.  The 65 member SF Homeless Outreach Team has less than 50 shelter beds out of 1,200  they control and they do not have sufficient tools for the magnitude of this crisis.  We will never be effective without more funds.
@TheGlamazonPDM @rpnorton @OurHomeSF 29% of those homeless identify as üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà LGBTQ.

@deadmanlagging @SFBART I checked last night &amp; was advised @SFBART had responded.  You are right to push the operator call button and the train operator will report to the control center who will advise BART PD.

@w6fu @CALencioni @SFBART Too often police feel they have the least ability to draw on the resources that those you encounter need most.  I am working on a better link w Community Justice Center, among others for @SFBART ‚Äî but conditions are unacceptable &amp; just like I tackled 16th I‚Äôm lining up for Civic
@w6fu @CALencioni @SFBART I should be careful with my words. It is demoralizing for officers to repeatedly come into contact w people broken by addiction, mental illness and chronic homelessness &amp; find the service system is too hard to link to and doesn‚Äôt prioritize connecting on streets or in stations.
@CALencioni We are also in negotiations w @SFBART PD for new contract. A generation ago our PD considered to have best salary/benefits. Now considered to be at bottom of 18 Bay Area Departments. Yes, we need visible, community oriented PD presence ‚Äî impossible without improving compensation.
@CALencioni @SFBART 100% yes.  I‚Äôve brought SFPD &amp; @SFBART PD together 4 more collaboration &amp; am meeting w/our collaborative courts so they play more of a role improving safety.  BART PD is down 20% w!several retirements in months ahead. I‚Äôm trying to improve the overall system.  Civic is my focus.

@fempathizer @suldrew @TheRealWBTC @SFBART Most SF escalators are 40+ years old, so well past their useful life.

You are right.

@Beautiful303030 @stirlingspencer @JaneKim Thanks, Frank.  When Jane was 1st elected she stayed at Next Door to understand why people don‚Äôt want to stay in shelters.  I worked w Jane to establish #311 instead of long lines for 90-day shelter reservations &amp; she was relentless in getting public health nurses in shelters.
@Beautiful303030 @stirlingspencer @JaneKim I respectfully disagree.  1/2 the SF homeless population lives in her district.  Jane stayed in a shelter &amp; always supported housing, services.  Maybe look at districts that have no shelters and avoid citing services.  This is what concentrates homelessness &amp; results in tents.

@suldrew @SFBART My understanding is that our new CBTC Train Control System ‚Äî in procurement and 5-6 year implementation- is a prerequisite.  I‚Äôve asked Deputy GM if we‚Äôve explored the costs or if I can request feasibility paper.  I ageee this should happen and SFO shuttle is good example.
@ericmkingsbury It‚Äôs a terrible tragedy whenever a train strikes someone.  I don‚Äôt know circumstances.

@_Z__ @SFBART First new downtown bathroom will open at Powell -- not till early 2019.  The BART PD podium at Civic Center was an embarrassment -- we need data-driven, community oriented, crisis-intervention trained policing for our 21st Century problems.
@_Z__ @SFBART I believe there was one in Chinatown years ago and mostly people urinated on it. Chief Rojas is committed to patrols, despite 20% vacancy rate at BART PD.  I will get more details of deployment in SF to share via Twitter and FB.
