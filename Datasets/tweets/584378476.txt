A study pegs the cost of the #GrreenNewDeal at $93 trillion over 10 years. Even if that overshoots the true cost by a factor of 5, it's still hard to see how Congress comes up with that much dough. Talking about it with @fmtalk1065 at 12:15.
@jackbilson3 @NateSilver538 @ClareMalone @galendruke @micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight He also supported an "assault weapon" ban ad waiting period of handguns as governor, as well as affirmative action and tougher regulation by the EPA. Those stances may be right; they may be wrong. But they are not going to be population among GOP primary voters.
@jackbilson3 @NateSilver538 @ClareMalone @galendruke @micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight The Republican Party primaries are dominated by social conservatives. And abortion pretty much is a litmus test. Is Weld the kind of dynamic candidate who can bring lots of new voters to the primaries? Let's just say I'm skeptical.
@jackbilson3 @NateSilver538 @ClareMalone @galendruke @micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight His literal constituency is Vermont. But the Democratic Party was fertile ground already for his ideas. How far do you think Weld is gonna get in a GOP primary as a pro-choice candidate? That, by itself, would make his bid a non-starter.
@jackbilson3 @NateSilver538 @ClareMalone @galendruke @micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight Thw difference is Bernie already had a natural constituency on the Democrat Party. Half if Iowa caucus goers describe themselves as socialist. Weld's brand of Republicanism is pretty much extinct.
@jackbilson3 @NateSilver538 @ClareMalone @galendruke @micahcohen @FiveThirtyEight Bill Weld will never be president. I'm confident of that prediction. And certainly not as a Republican. He has no constituency in today's Republican Party.

@HCathcartinBama @JoyceWhiteVance @senatemajldr Interesting. Thanks.
@realjohndri I think Mueller will go wherever evidence leads. Independent counsels have huge incentives to produce results. I doubt Barr will intervene to stop Mueller from finishing. I wouldn't be shocked if that takes longer than most people predict.
@JoyceWhiteVance Why would the Senate have vote? Can't @senatemajldr just sit on any resolution coming from the House? The Senate fails to vote on most House-passed bills.
@realjohndri Ah, no. The solicitor general represents the administration in court. The AG will be Mueller's supervisor. My guess is Barr will let it play out.
@wallacedewey Those aren't your choices, though. Your choices are Barr, a DOJ professional with a long career, or Whitaker, dogged by multiple scandals.

@realjohndri I respectfully disagree with the notion that it is feasible. We simply don't have the technology to zero out carbon emissions in 10 years.
@ricardo_de_anda @AnnaTarkov @CIS_org The numbers dispute that, though. Immigration at current rates only barely changes the worker-to-retiree ratio. To maintain the current ratio, we'd have to take in FIVE TIMES as many immigrants as we currently do. That would push the population over 700 million in just 40 yrs.
@ricardo_de_anda @AnnaTarkov @CIS_org Except I don't argue that immigration is all bad. Immigration confers a of benefits on the host nation (but reversing the aging crisis is not one of them). There are also some drawbacks. And immigration policy can be designed to maximize the benefit.
@HCathcartinBama OK.
@AnnaTarkov @CIS_org It is, indeed, a different way 9f looking at things. Harvard prof George Borjas says Immigration views can be understood by the question, Who are you rooting for? If it's the immigrant, one set of policies follows. If it's citizens, another set will follow.
@HCathcartinBama And there are all sorts of tax credits for all sorts of things.
@HCathcartinBama They support pre-K, but they want new money, right? Redirecting the AAA money would still keep it out of existing classrooms.
@AnnaTarkov @CIS_org One of the most popular arguments for immigration is that it will save entitlement programs by rebalancing the worker-to-retiree ratio. But that's not true. There are other reasons, but they ought to be rooted in what's in the national interest.
@HCathcartinBama The money for the AAA scholarship program is coming from kids that are not in the public schools. If those kids WERE in the schools, how do you think those schools would feel about losing the money to go to pre-K?
@AnnaTarkov @CIS_org Yes, I know the history. But these are just numbers. What is the proper number of immigrants coming into the the country? Does it matter? Does the country have an unlimited capacity, or are some limits appropriate?
Critics are calling it a #GreenNewDisaster but conservatives ought to take the proposal seriously and engage the proposal rather than laughing it off. https://t.co/LDoNK2ystf

@realjohndri The soulessnes of capitalism is kind of its genius, if you think about it. People acting in their own interest efficiently allocate resources -- much better than any central planner with a soul. The baker works to sell bread, not out of altruism. But that bread benefits others.
@realjohndri Our means-tested government programs (so that doesn't even include Social Security and Medicare) exceed $1 trillion a year. That's bigger than the entire defense budget. So there is plenty of redistribution going on.
@HCathcartinBama Indeed. It affected a small number of people nominally, and then an even smaller number of people after they set their accountants to work. The rates are less important than what people actually pay. And the top 1 percent pay more now even with lower rates than they did then.
@jmccarter80 As I said in response above, Europeans have more government benefits, but they pay for them with higher taxes. American liberals too often suggest we can have the benefits, and the rich will pay for them.
@realjohndri The European countries are capitalist, too. They just have higher taxes and more social spending.
@Vinniedus Yes,  but the rates are not just higher for the rich. They are higher for regular people. If that's the tradeoff we want, so be it. But let's be honest about the debate.
@HCathcartinBama In the 1950s? I'm not sure what the thresholds were. The top rate didn't kick in until a high level, though, and there were all sorts of mechanisms for avoiding it. As I said, 8 taxpayers paid it in 1960.
@HCathcartinBama As the blog states (I assume you are reading it now?), the top marginal rate in the 1950s was 91 percent. Somewhat misleading. B/c of loopholes, shelters, few actually paid it. In 1960, a total of 8 taxpayers got hit with top rate. Also, top 1 percent paid less than today.
@OfficialSPGB Yes, as the blog explains, Americans increasingly view socialism as mere wealth redistribution -- not ownership of the means of production. I wrote about "socialism" as understood by today's millennials.
Growing numbers of Americans are receptive to socialism. Politicians want tax rates on rich hiked to 70-90 percent. But those rates on the super wealthy won't generate enough money. Look at Europe, which taxes middle class heavily. https://t.co/tGcGaCCmtj

@realjohndri @CIS_org They looked just at the $5 billion budget request passed by the House last year (but not the Senate). Your point on maintenance is well-taken. I do t think CIS had any cost estimate to go on. But obviously, the higher those costs are, the more effective the wall would have to be.

@rolandsmartin I think we're talking past each other. I am not disputing any of that. My only point was that the barriers to black voting did not come from the 19th Amendment.
@rolandsmartin @Liz_Cheney No argument. Congress didn't follow thru. But the intent of the 19th Amendment was to extend rights to everyone. Southern lawmakers tried to alter the amendment to give states the responsibility for enforcing it. It was rejected, suggesting that the original intent was for all.
@MzMuzik12 @rolandsmartin Tell me where I'm wrong.
@rolandsmartin This certainly is true. But the intent of the 19th Amendment was not to enfranchise only white women. It was meant to enfranchise all women. The reason black women could not vote in practice was not the result of the amendment but the failure to enforce it.
@rolandsmartin @Liz_Cheney The 19th Amendment applied to all women, not just white women. Many state and local governments illegally abridged that right. But that had nothing to do with the amendment, itself.

@QuinHillyer Illegal immigration gets the most attention. But we take far too many LEGAL immigrants based on who their relatives are rather than whether they have the skills and education to benefit the country. That is by design, because that's the way the rules are written.
@QuinHillyer I just think we ought to have an immigration system designed to help America. The one we have is designed for America to help the immigrants. We've got it backwards.
@mattklewis Trading permanent amnesty without reforms to prevent the next wave of dreamers for one year of funding for a wall that never would be built would be foolish.
@QuinHillyer Agreed. If our policy would just stop encouraging illegal immigration, we wouldnt need a wall.
@QuinHillyer @brithume Yes, which could help the stock market. But it would do nothing about debt. The stock market did not cause the last recession. Excessive housing debt and bad loans did.
@QuinHillyer @brithume Well, if you're right about the timing, there is nothing Congress can do about debt that would prevent a recession that is happening now (or has already started).
@QuinHillyer @brithume Agreed. My only point is that a stock market decline doesn't guarantee a recession, and the timing of recessions cannot be predicted with precision.
@QuinHillyer @brithume I certainly agree debt is a big problem. That goes for both government debt, as well as -- less appreciated -- personal debt. Most Americans are not prepared for emergencies.
@QuinHillyer @brithume The expansion is historically long, so law of averages says recession is possible. But a stock market correction is inevitable and does not necessarily precede a recession.

@JohnHammontree I thought about the "petition the government" clause. But of course citizens don't have equal access to the president. If a connected donor wants a meeting, he'll get it. If you show up at the door of the White House, there is no obligation to open it.
@JohnHammontree I'm not arguing about what politicians SHOULD do. I'm just trying to work through what the Constitution REQUIRES them to do.
@JohnHammontree The First Amendment says Congress can't abridge "freedom of speech, or of the press." I'm not sure if blocking people from following you on Twitter qualifies. It doesn't abridge anyone from speaking or publishing.
@JohnHammontree So then the distinction is how the person uses the account? Trump can't block people because he communicates policy views, but another president who used it to talk about baseball could block people? That seems even more problematic.
@JohnHammontree Well, along those lines, though, there is an official POTUS account. Trump uses his personal account. Is there that much of a distinction between tweeting a message that excludes some users and emailing the same message to recipients that exclude some users?
@JohnHammontree It will be interesting to see what the appeals courts do with this. Under the logic of this ruling, must a politician accept every "friend" request he gets on Facebook?
@JohnHammontree Certainly, it could embolden someone to sue. Do you know if there are any Alabama lawsuits already?
@JohnHammontree I don't think this is a clear-cut case. It Twitter is a public forum, does that mean Twitter, itself, is restricted from blocking content?
@JohnHammontree All public officials are bound by the Constitution, but one judge's interpretation of it generally is not binding outside that district. (The exception is when a judge issues a nationwide injunction). We'll see what happens to this case on appeal.

@ALPolitics @lhedgepeth_star Seems like s a semantics argument. To me, eliminating a line item of unspent money is an accounting gimmick. And in any case, even if you think "uncertainty" or whatever results from this, what is disingenuous is leaving folks with the impression that kids will lose health care.
@ALPolitics @lhedgepeth_star Yeah, advocates always see the sky falling. Health care for children is very popular. I don't see elected officials going against that. And in CHIP's case, there's some evidence it actually SAVES the government money. This is not a real cut; much ado about nothing.
@BamaIndependent @kaitlancollins @WhiteHouse @kellysadler45 I tend to think we're too quick to call for people's scalps. In this case, it was a remark made in private and apparently out of frustration. People often say things in public they regret, let alone in private. If the apology is sincere, it ought to be accepted.
@ALPolitics @lhedgepeth_star It's a cut on paper only. The entire rescission bill contains budgeted money for programs that are defunct. If an actual crisis comes, Congress can always appropriate more money. The "cut" will not impact one child and it does not affect the CHIP deal struck earlier this year.

@MadisonU Because he thinks it will allow Iran to develop nukes — either clandestinely or — by waiting out the sunset clauses — legally down the road. Not only that, but the deal made it easier for Iran to foment terrorism in and around Israel through non-nuclear means.

@Josh_Moon You still didn't address how a racist country elected him twice. Put it this way, if Obama had been allowed to run for a third term, would he have beaten Trump? My guess is he would have.
@Josh_Moon The problem with that theory is that it ignores the fact that Trump won a lot of places that Obama one twice. So racists votes for the black guy twice but then voted for Trump because they're racist? Doesn't make sense.

@BamaIndependent I don't remember Trump ever saying that, although he says so many conflicting things, it's hard to know for sure. But since his "60 Minutes" interview before his inauguration, he's been pretty consistent. Everyone agrees it would be silly to try to wall the mountains, for exple
@BamaIndependent And contrary to this report, Trump does not call for a 2,000-mile-long wall. People say that all the time, but it's not administration policy.
@BamaIndependent Well, I agree we need to do a much better job tracking people coming on visas and making sure they leave on time. It was a key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission and has not been done. Cost-benefit of the wall is debatable, but barriers do work.
@BamaIndependent Scanning the summary, this seems consistent with what I said, no? With Mexican immigration down, overstays outnumber border crossings. 2007 is about the time when Mexican immigration started to decline.
@BamaIndependent One thing to consider though is that people over staying visas are more like than border crosses to be educated and less like to cost more on social services.
@BamaIndependent It's hard to tell because we don't track visas very well. The rule of thumb has been that overstays account for about half. With Mexican migration down, the overstay share is probably higher now.
@BamaIndependent Border apprehensions were 1.6 million in FY 2000. By FY 16, that had dropped to 563,000 (although that was up over what it had been a few years earlier). Places that got the fence saw declines on the order of 90 percent.

@BamaIndependent @DarrellIssa And we're going to lose a seat because we're not growing fast enough; not because we're not counting them.
@BamaIndependent @DarrellIssa The 2010 census form asked 10 questions -- how many people live in your home? What kind of a home is it? What us your race? Are you Hispanic, etc. Adding citizenship back to that doesn't seem onerous.
@BamaIndependent @DarrellIssa Theoretically. If the undercut is dramatically more pronounced in Alabama than elsewhere. This is why mayors generally make a big push to get people to fill out the form. But citizenship doesn't really have anything to do with that.
@BamaIndependent @DarrellIssa Interestingly, the Constitution doesn't say much about the census. It calls for an "enumeration" every 10 years "in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." Asking about citizenship surely isn't required. But it can't be prohibited by the Constitution, either.
@BamaIndependent @DarrellIssa It was asked on the main form for 1820 to 1950. Then it Elway asked on the long form until 2010, when the long form was eliminated. It is asked every month on the Census surveys.

The 2018 Alabama legislative session is almost over. Here's what lawmakers did (or didn't) do on Tuesday. #alpolitics  https://t.co/Saic8pZf4r
@MadisonU Yes, and holding down wages. If the supply of low-wage workers contracted, the cost of those workers (i.e. wages) would rise. Bad for business owners. Bad (to some degree) for customers. Good for American and legal immigrant workers.
@MadisonU Well, you fix part of it. But you still have downward pressure on wages. Let's say you have 1M illegal immigrants working in restaurants and you give them amnesty. That's still 1M people competing with low-skill Americans. More workers = lower wages. It's supply &amp; demand.
@MadisonU We don't need to turn off the economy. But we can make it harder for illegal immigrants to work. We could make E-Verify mandatory. We could punish businesses that bypass Americans and legal workers.
@MadisonU … get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and get deported. We ought to turn off the magnets that draw illegal immigrants. Then we could have a rational discussion about amnesty for long-time residents. But folks have to be confident it won't trigger the next round.
@MadisonU I'm not w/out sympathy. As a starting point, we ought to agree on deporting criminals. There are enough illegal immigrants booked into jails to keep ICE busy. When you force ICE to hunt them down in communities, you increase the risk that more sympathetic illegal immigrants …
@MadisonU Immigrants (mostly) aren't bad people. But unless we want open borders, there is not point in limiting immigration if we're not going to enforce the limits. And if we are going to have open borders, we ought to close down ICE &amp; Border Patrol and at least save some money.
@MadisonU It is true that immigrants, as long as they don't become citizens, marginally help Social Security. But it's so trivial that it does not change the fiscal picture. SS is another discussion, but immigration is not the solution.
@MadisonU I wouldn't count on immigration saving Social Security and Medicare. Immigration barely moves the needle on entitlement programs. Immigrants tend to age with the rest of us; they're not that much younger than the country as a whole.
@MadisonU …  but if I find you two years later, well, you've already got my stuff, so it would be unfair to send you to jail.
@MadisonU The logic of that is that if we catch you at the border, you go back, but if you manage to evade Border Patrol, you get to stay. It would be like saying if I catch you in the act of braking into my house you go to jail …
@MadisonU I don't think anyone advocates zero immigrants. Personally, i would favor a system more like Canada and Australia that skews toward immigrants with better education and skills necessary to succeed in a modern economy.
@MadisonU It is a civil violation, but anyone here illegally is removable under federal law. I like immigrants, too. But they should come legally. If they don't and we ignore it, we make schmucks out of folks who stood in line for yrs to come legally and undermine respect for our own laws.
@MadisonU Well first of all, you realize that people who entered the country without authorization DO has different rights. Second, it's an interesting theory. Do you have data that shows people will rat out their neighbors but only if they won't be deported?
@MadisonU So your concern is not that people won't report crimes b/c they fear they will be deported, but that they won't report crimes because they're afraid the perpetrator will be deported?
@MadisonU Illegal immigrants DO get due process. Anyone removed from the country has to be adjudicated by an immigration law judge. You don't have to prove the additional crime; only the immigration violation. If you deport someone with, say, a pending theft charge, you save cost of trial.
This suggests Democrats might be over-interpreting the likely anomalous Doug Jones victory. https://t.co/CEnfr2vFLQ
@MadisonU So your position is only convicted criminals should ever be deported?
@MadisonU Because the sheriff doesn't ask the legal status of crime victims or turn crime victims over to ICE. We're only talking about the criminals.
@MadisonU You make it sound like ICE wants police to refer crime victims to them. Not true. They want jails to transfer custody of illegal immigrants. Remember -- the ones who have landed in jail for other crimes.
@MadisonU I think the sheriff should extend the same courtesy to ICE as he would any police agency that put in a hold request.
@MadisonU None of that changes is jails honor ICE derainers as they would a detainee from any other law enforcement agency. When you release criminal aliens, who do you think they victimize?
@MadisonU I'm late to this debate. But what impacts immigrant communities more? Taking custody of criminals in jails? Or having ICE round them up in neighborhoods while arresting other illegal immigrants they come in contact with along the way?

@dpreston2020 @DaHyundaiLawyer @oldsaltyseadog @fmtalk1065 @WhatTheFredSay @thetwitmagnate @CassieFambro @TheMobileGator @DCameronSmith @andrew_williams @KellyK2KFinley Actually, I was saying the opposite. The kids have made points just as valid as the adults. Many, in fact, are the same points. The intelligence of the points run the gamut -- just like the adults.
@DaHyundaiLawyer @oldsaltyseadog @dpreston2020 @fmtalk1065 @WhatTheFredSay @thetwitmagnate @CassieFambro @TheMobileGator @DCameronSmith @andrew_williams @KellyK2KFinley No, I meant if the kids are going to engage in the debate, especially in highly personal terms (i.e., Marco Rubio has blood on his hands), then they can't hide behind, "Oh, we're just kids. We're immune from criticism).

@SWHesq @tuningforklove @MSkotnicki @AP (5) What else in the Bill of Rights should we scrap? Lots of progressives already aren't fond of the First Amendment. If @realDonaldTrump decides to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to talk to Mueller, I bet that will be a target. We've long simply ignored the 10th.
@SWHesq @tuningforklove @MSkotnicki @AP (4) Would we send police door to door? And how would they know what doors to go to? There is no national database of gun owners. Would police be empowered to search any home they like to look for guns? We'd have to repeal the Fourth Amendment, too.
@SWHesq @tuningforklove @MSkotnicki @AP (3) If we banned all semiautomatic firearms, it eventually would have an impact. But there already are more than.100 million of them in circulation. Seizing them would have a greater impact, but how would we carry it out?
@SWHesq @tuningforklove @MSkotnicki @AP (2) But Second Amendment or no, those kinds of measures never would pass Congress.
@SWHesq @tuningforklove @MSkotnicki @AP (1) This is true. Government-sponsored research concluded the 1990s "assault" weapons ban had no impact on crime. Repealing Second Amendment at least has the logic of allowing the kinds of Draconian measures that actually might impact gun crime.

@CassieFambro I'm not even arguing against the policy, just pointing out that you can't give a benefit to one person without forcing someone else to pay for it. If we are going to guarantee maternity leave, I'd prefer it be paid for by a share taxes on employees &amp; employers (similar to SS).
@CassieFambro It may be good; it may be bad. But it does reduce freedom. The government can't give a benefit to someone without forcing another to pay for it. We can debate how much the state ought to restrict freedom, but we ought to at least acknowledge that it what is happening.
@CassieFambro In America, you have the freedom to offer certain benefits or not to employees, and you have the freedom to take the job there or not.
@CassieFambro It's called freedom.

@BamaIndependent Well, not treason, which has a very specific definition in the Constitution. But a serious crime, for sure. But that's just my point. No evidence in the public record of that. At least not yet.
@BamaIndependent There's been no evidence of a conspiracy involving ANY of Trump's advisers. George Papadopoulos, for instance pleaded guilty to lying about talking to the Russian government. The lie was a crime. But talking to the Russians was not.
@BamaIndependent Sure it is. I didn't say is wasn't a crime. I said it wasn't evidence of a criminal conspiracy involving Trump.
@davitydave @jmccarter80 @Josh_Moon I'm not negating anything. I'm not calling for Mueller to be fired. I'm not calling for the probe to be shut down. I'm just saying that speculatuon has gotten way ahead of the facts.
@BamaIndependent No, I don't think the Trump campaign did much vetting. And yes, there's a lot of chaos with the staff. Those are reasons to vote against him, not evidence of a criminal conspiracy.
@davitydave @jmccarter80 @Josh_Moon Yeah, sure. I support the investigation. All I'm saying is we've not yet seen evidence of a criminal conspiracy.

@jmccarter80 @davitydave @Josh_Moon We'll see. I'm certainly open to the possibility.
@BamaIndependent @Josh_Moon But the pleas have nothing to do with collusion. 13 Russians; no Americans implicated. Manafort and Gates for conduct the predated campaign. Two low-level aides and Mike Flynn for lying about otherwise legal conduct. Not saying that disproves case, but it surely doesn't prove it.
@davitydave @jmccarter80 @Josh_Moon Absolutely true. However, it seems hard to believe we would not have gotten wind of a blockbuster piece of evidence if it existed.
@Josh_Moon At worst, that's a campaign finance violation, and even that is a stretch. To make a "collusion" case. you have to prove a quid pro quo. And all we have is conjecture. I'm willing to wait for evidence, but so far none in the public record.

@StevenTDennis I'm not necessarily against it. I'd just have to see the details.
@StevenTDennis An administration that dislikes guns might deny gun ownership broadly. In some states, for instance, it is extremely difficult to get conceal-carry permits.
@StevenTDennis Gun ownership is a constitutional right, so before we deprive a citizen of that right, we ought to have a good reason. And there ought to be safeguards in place to prevent abuse.

@StevenTDennis That might reduce accidental deaths. I'd have to see the details of what the background checks involve. I'd be leery of making subjective judgments about who is a good person and who's a danger.
@StevenTDennis It probably shows that there is more to gun violence than availability of guns. Gun killings have gone down dramatically over the past 25 years even as the number of guns has gone up.
@StevenTDennis This is true. Lots of ways to get guns. Many criminals simply steal them. Most can purchase legally. Requiring background checks for private sales may be a good idea. But it seems unlikely to do much.
@StevenTDennis OK, I'll accept Polifact's estimate is 22 percent. But has there ever been a mass shooting tied to someone evading a background check by buying a gun from a friend or relative without a  avkgrpund check?

Clearly, having 300 million guns is part of the issue. But we're also more violent in general than other industrialized countries. And on the narrow issue of mass shootings, we're not as much of an outlier. France has had lots of deaths. …
@BamaIndependent Well, I wouldn't say everyone. But it is hard to believe that it's just a coincidence that mass shootings almost always happen in places where the public is not allowed to bring guns. Many mass shooters have explicitly said that was the reason they chose their targets.

@BamaIndependent @dpreston2020 @DCameronSmith @fmtalk1065 No, as I said earlier to @dpreston2020 there are plenty of restrictions consistent with SCOTUS precedent that have and could be taken. Background checks. Waiting periods. Even banning "assault" weapons. All have been upheld. The question is whether they would reduce crime.
@BamaIndependent @DCameronSmith Well, it's interesting that almost every mass public shooting in the past half-century has occurred in "gun-free zones." Maybe we need more armed citizens. But like deaths from car accidents, we'll just have to accept we can't eliminate it.

@StevenTDennis Yeah, Schumer doesn't want a wall. But what I'm saying is if he could get the DREAM Act by giving up funding for a wall for the next fiscal year, it would be a big win for him, right? Trump might be willing trade away more significant reforms if he could get the wall.

@Josh_Moon The House voted to renew CHIP last year, and most Democrats voted against it.
@JerryHinnen @Josh_Moon Agreed. If the Senate passes CHIP, and the House shoots it down, that's on the House. But no one has really advocated ended CHIP.
@JerryHinnen @Josh_Moon And that logic should apply to the Senate, too, no? Or just the House?
@JerryHinnen @Josh_Moon So the House should just do whatever it thinks the Senate minority wants?
@JerryHinnen @Josh_Moon Well, again. The House DID vote months ago to fund CHIP. The Senate never did because of that pesky 60-vote rule. Democrats mostly voted against the reauthorization because they objected to how it was funded.
@BamaIndependent @LifeZette I don't think that had much of an impact. If it did, it would have shown up in the House vote. And the CR sailed through the House. The problem is going to be in the Senate, and that's because of real differences. Trump working the phones wouldn't change that.

@BamaIndependent @LifeZette Yeah, but you realize 60 votes are required in the Senate, right? Republicans need nine Democrats at least. Democrats have absolute veto power if they stick together.
@thegnc @LifeZette Actually, you need 60 votes in the Senate. So Republicans need at least nine Senate Democrats.
@Josh_Moon Democrats want DACA and CHIP. But if forced to choose, they pick amnesty. Or they are at least willing to use CHIP as leverage to get amnesty. There is no other conclusion you can draw.

@thatbjenkins @Josh_Moon I'd have to see the details. But my guess is if the Alabama Legislature does it, it will be on the cheap. I don't see the state hiring any additional workers to enforce it.
@Josh_Moon If there are no able-bodied, non-elderly people on Medicaid, then this is purely symbolic and you have nothing to worry about, right? Even the Trump administration wouldn't approve a waiver for the other categories.

@JohnHammontree Look at Bob Corker. He was the most reluctant Republican but ended up voting "yes." He's not running again, so donors should not be a concern one way or the other.
@JohnHammontree I just dispute the premise that Republicans are voting the way donors tell them to. That suggests that they don't really want to do it but feel pressured by donors. They don't need a push. They enthusiastically want to do it.
@JohnHammontree Yeah, I think the Tea Party would prefer to solve that on the spending side. But actual Republican lawmakers don't have the stomach for that. The "dark money" premise is that Republicans cut taxes b/c of donors. I think it's the other way around. Donors give to GOP b/c they cut.

@Josh_Moon And that's not even counting the Republican-leaning voters who actually cast ballots for Jones.
@Josh_Moon Well, Jones won by 20,715 votes. There were 22,819 write-ins. It's reasonable to assume many or most of them were Republicans could not stomach Moore. Then there are GOP voters who stayed home. I'd say there's a pretty good chance a normal Republican would win that race.
@Josh_Moon It was, indeed. But it still most likely would not have been enough to beat a normal Republican.
@ddcombest @Josh_Moon Good point.
@Josh_Moon Yeah, bit the question is was this an unusual set of circumstances or is Alabama fundamentally different? You seem to believe the latter. Maybe you're right. But that seems to be making lots of assumptions.
@Josh_Moon You told national TV audiences the Moore would win because (paraphrasing here), Alabamians are bad people. But now you write, "we could reshape this entire state, start moving it forward and never look back." Did Alabama really change that much? Or were you wrong before?
@Josh_Moon This is what you wrote two days ago: 		"So, no, the outcome of today’s election will not determine who we are as a state. We’ve already laid that out for all to see."		But now everything is different because your prediction was wrong? That doesn't make sense.

@MIKE_FINCH2 Mobile County also voted for the Democrat against Moore in 2012, so that wasn't a shock. Baldwin is interesting. The Eastern Shore voted more Democrat than usual. Jones carried he Daphne Civic Center precinct, probably first time Dem has won that box since I've lived here.

@JohnHammontree Right.
@JohnHammontree Voting behavior is actually easier to predict than many people assume. You tell me the background and demographics of a voter, and I'll tell you how he votes with pretty good accuracy. Harder to predict is whether he shows up.
@JohnHammontree Sounds about right. Seems like counting solely on a big black turnout is not going to do it. Hard to think black voters will be a bigger share of the electorate than in 2012 when the first black president was running for re-election.
@JohnHammontree Moore took 63 percent of the vote in Shelby in 2012 and only won overall by less than 4 points. Seems to me, Jones just needs to outperform Vance in Shelby (and Baldwin, Elmore, Autauga, etc.) by a little bit. He doesn't need to come close to winning them.
@JohnHammontree Do you think Jones actually has to win the suburbs, or just hold Moore's margins down? Seems unlikely Jones will actually win Republican-leaning suburbs.

@MIKE_FINCH2 @fmtalk1065 I'm by no means predicting a Jones win. It could go either way. But he has a definite path. And that path is to win over enough suburban Republicans while holding on to the normal Democratic base. The 2012 results suggest it is a distinct possibility.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @fmtalk1065 Yes. Look at the 2012 race for chief justice. It was very close. Many Republican voters defected from Moore. And that was BEFORE a second suspension from the Supreme Court and sexual-abuse allegations.

Can Doug Jones win the #ALSEN race? Sure he can. A winning path most likely would be peeling away more Republicans that Bob Vance did in the 2012 state Supreme Court race against Roy Moore. #alpolitics https://t.co/Hi1T3OnLVZ
It seems unlikely that Jones can win by increasing black turnout. Hard to believe black voters will make up larger share of the electorate than they did in 2012 when Obama was on the ballot. Jones will need more Republicans than Bob Vance got then against Moore in SC race. https://t.co/4jdIXdbM4Q

@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP More important than its impact on any individual taxpayer is whether it succeeds on its macroeconomic goals — sustained growth in the 3-4 percent range and rising wages. I have to acknowledge, I have my doubts.
Sen. Jeff Flake is a self-proclaimed deficit hawk who expressed deep concerns about the GOP tax bill. Odd the, that he apparently was willing to vote "yes" in exchange for a commitment on DACA amnesty.  https://t.co/0IwDXjaDQq via @LifeZette
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP Happy holidays to you, as well. Thanks for the civil discussion. I hope the extra money in the early years helps you, and I hope Congress extends the cuts in the out years. Most important, I hope it spurs faster growth and rising wages.
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP It's a gimmick to make the deficit spending appear less on paper in order to meet Senate budgetary rules. But if you really think Congress will let the cuts expire, when you get your tax cut this year, save it so you can mitigate the increase you think is coming a decade from now
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP (2) … Unless you think Congress won't extend the cuts when they reach their expiration date, and that is a political question, not an economic one. And history suggests that Congress will extend them (at least for the middle class).
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP It's not an economics discussion. It's a politics discussion. If you want to argue the bill will increase the debt, that's fine. But if you want to say it increases taxes on most people, it does not …
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP That's a different argument. Is the hope for faster economic growth worth additional debt? That's a legitimate debate. But it's just wrong to say most people will pay more in taxes when the law takes effect. It's only true in a decade IF you believe Congress wouldn't extend them.
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP Most people take the standard deduction, so they don't qualify for the other deductions. And the standard deduction doubles. Plus rates come down.
@Josh_Moon I'll go ahead and take my rather substantial tax cut now and take my chances with a future Congress, 10 years from now. The Bush tax cuts were written the same way. On paper they were temporary. In practice, they got extended for all but the wealthiest taxpayers.
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP No, it's really not. The only year that Congress can guarantee is next year, and most people will get a sizable cut. Any year after that will be determined by whoever is in Congress at the time. They can raise, lower or keep taxes the same.
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP Should tax increases require a super majority, too?
@dimariebragg @EmilyPersists @Josh_Moon @GOP The only way those numbers are true is if you believe people will give up insurance if the government doesn't fine them for not having it (and count the subsidies they no longer collect as a tax increase) and if you believe Congress won't renew cuts set to expire.
Only one Republican voted against the Senate tax cut bill after debate that stretched past midnight. https://t.co/F2xioUM8CL via @LifeZette
@StevenTDennis What do you make of that? Rubio and Lee didn't want to be seen as divisive?
@ConnorASheets Fair enough. I disagree. But even if I'm wrong and you're right, I don't think it's a disastrous as you fear. And I agree with you on the process. It's terrible. You shouldn't be scrawling hand-written changes on a bill hours before voting.
@ConnorASheets Read the story, though. It's not just that Sherrod Brown backed the private jet thing. It just seems not as simple as a giveaway to the very wealthy.
@conor64 @henrycjjackson That's good advice, but problematic politically for someone in office.
@ConnorASheets Admittedly, I have not studied the corporate side as closely. But the private jet thing is backed by one of the Senate's most liberal Democrats and has been greatly overblown, according to this article. https://t.co/8d5BoOrAdx
@ConnorASheets Ah, now you've hit on a legitimate criticism. I happen to think the JCT dynamic analysis understates economic growth somewhat. But I haven't seen anything projecting it's deficit-neutral. But your original complaint was that it was regressive. It's not.
@ConnorASheets Most people at every bracket will pay less. Something like 90 percent of filers will be able to take the standard deduction, which means they don't need deductions. The people affected by loss of deductions mostly are in the upper middle class or higher.
@CassieFambro Because the Republican leadership needed Lisa Murkowski's vote. ANRW drilling has been a priority for Alaska for decades.
@ConnorASheets The impact of the changes on the corporate side are hard to predict, but the changes on the individual side retain the progressivity of the current code. Taxpayers will more than $1 million in income pay 19.3% of taxes; would be 19.7% under the bill.
@ConnorASheets Ah, I got you. I was focusing on the crawl. It's been a long day. I'll make a prediction, though: The tax-cut bill will be neither the panacea promised by its proponents nor the disaster claimed by its detractors.
@ConnorASheets Marco Rubio's amendment to extend the child tax credit to people who don't pay income taxes to claim the full amount is a disaster?
And that's how we know this is just politics. If Democrats truly wanted to help parents who don't pay enough income tax to claim the full value of the child tax credit, they'd vote for this and take half a loaf. https://t.co/1YqpauTmrC

@Josh_Moon It can't say anything they want because it has to fit into reconciliation rules. Dems oppose raising taxes on 87 million people, right? Then we can count on them to extend the taxes before they expire, right?
@Josh_Moon I never defended every feature of the bill. I'm just pointing out that it's dishonest to say it raises taxes on most middle class families when it actually cuts taxes on most middle class families. These special lobbyist carve-outs are what I'd like Congress to get rid of.
@Josh_Moon The Bush tax cuts were supposedly temporary. too. But Congress extended them for all but the upper-income earners.
@4lgsgood @Josh_Moon We don't really know for sure how it will be spent. Whether they "need" it is a matter of opinion. But it should be noted that the current rates are the highest in the industrialized world.
@Josh_Moon Point is that what supposedly happens 10 years from now means nothing. The only thing that matters is what happens next year, b/c that's all this Congress controls. One Congress can't bind another. The cuts could be permanent and it would be no guarantee taxes wouldn't be raised.
@Josh_Moon Some people will pay more. Most people in every bracket will pay less The projections are based on sunset clauses in the back end of the 10-year budget window. I assume Dems would join Republicans at the time in extending those cuts, right?

@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette I agree. There's too much black and white. Immigration isn't an unmitigated good or bad. We benefit in many ways. But there are downsides.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette I took that as net, but you could be right.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette Let's stipulate that there is no single cause of wage stagnation. It's a complicated issue. Like immigration, itself. But it is a factor.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette Yes, but too often immigration advocates are reluctant to say how much is enough or too much. We don't think enough about those details.

@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette Hundreds of millions would come here if they could, polls show. Assuming you don't want to double the size of USA, you agree with limits.…
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette I don't think FAIR actually advocates for zero immigration, just less.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette That is true. But we've gone through periods of high immigration &amp; low immigration. After previous surges, we have slowed it down.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette … We ought to favor immigrants most likely to help the economy, least likely to require gov't assistance or to compete w/ most vulnerable.
@tinaleeinberlin @FAIRImmigration @LifeZette I think numbers matter. But more importantly, is an immigration system designed to help America and not just immigrants …

@Josh_Moon Collins has been consisting in voting to keep Obamacare. McCain voted 18 months ago for a full repeal.
@Josh_Moon I get it. You like the result. I'm not even talking about that. I have no problem with Susan Collins, who has been consistent for 2 years.
@lyman_brian @Josh_Moon He was at the newser called to explain whey they'd vote for it. Seem implied. But I could be misinterpreting.
@Josh_Moon People get annoyed when pols flip-flop after 5 years. This was 5 hours. The facts didn't change in that time.
@1111summit Agreed. He's still a war hero and I respect his career. But this was not his best moment. He said one thing and did another.
@IndependentinAL The caucus was too divided to ever pass something, in my view. But McCain said just hours ago that he would vote for it.
@Josh_Moon As I said earlier, he voted "no" on something he said five hours ago that he'd vote "yes" on.
@1111summit He voted "no" on a bill he said just five hours ago that he'd vote "yes" on.

@MadisonU Yeah, it would have looked a lot like the last six years under Obama.
@MadisonU Yeah, probably the single biggest argument (from conservative perspective) for voting for Trump.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Actually, even "full repeal" is still just partial repeal. It would cut the funding and the mandates but not the insurance regs.
RT @FAIRImmigration: House Democrat Accuses Border Agents of Human-Rights Violations https://t.co/VUHwDb2DYZ via @LifeZette @BrendanKKirby
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Also crucial to keep in mind, House waiver would have applied only to individual market consumers who let insurance lapse (&amp; only for 1 yr)
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro That was in the House bill, not the Senate bills. I don't any state would have sought a pre-existing conditions waiver given the politics
Senate Dems who voted against Jeff Sessions are aghast that Trump is undermining him.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Chronically ill. The pre-existing conditions protections of Obamacare stay (for the most part). And yes, I've read the CBO reports.
@MadisonU This is true. But they're trying to do a very big &amp; hard thing with a very narrow majority. Not sure Jeb or Marco would have more success.
@MadisonU Fair enough on the other stuff, it's actually the job of the legislative branch to pass laws.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Mostly neutral. Depends on which plan. House plan had a waiver on pre-existing conditions that likely no state would have sought.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro To clarify, ACA was good for the sick and old but bad for non-subsidized young. GOP plans good for young, bad of the old. Neural for sick.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro For proof of that, check out how much a 60-year-old would get hammered under House and Senate repeal plans.
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro It helps the sick of all ages enormously. It also benefits the old because they pay less than actuarial tables would suggest they should.
@StevenTDennis They were wrong to a very large degree in their original score of Obamacare. The thing that bothers me is degree CBO is taken as gospel.
I think Trump is not well-versed on details, of insurance policy, but the $12 comment could just have been a misstatement. https://t.co/ngQdTdxlvi
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Yeah, but ACA prohibited any variation base on health status. That shifted burden even more on young &amp; healthy.
@StevenTDennis And by the way, I think CBO vastly overstates the number of people who would give it up just because they don't have to buy it.
@StevenTDennis Yeah, I don't think anyone argues with the direction, just the accuracy. But many of the people who choose not "lose."
@MIKE_FINCH2 @CassieFambro Yeah, but it is still based on actuarial risk (or should be). That's why people on the beach pay more for home insurance than inland.
@StevenTDennis If you tell me the Phillies are going to win 90 games this yr, I'll guarantee that's too high. But I can't tell the real total, either.
@CassieFambro Certainly not under Obamacare, which mandates artificially high premiums on the young in order to subsidize the old.
Time and again, CBO assumes millions of people have insurance (including Medicaid) only b/c gov't orders them to. https://t.co/TqQbT74PKE
@StevenTDennis Can we say no one really knows, but that 22 million is too high?
@StevenTDennis Paul Ryan is correct. CBO sees 6 million fewer Medicaid recipients — before any cuts even take place — just b/c gov't wouldn't mandate it.

@Russian_Starr They're being billed as a threat to congressmen.
@MakersMound @Josh_Moon True but not relevant to my point. Not expanding Medicaid should not reduce exchange participation. Different population.
@brotherflounder Yeah, but too much of a hassle if they already have it? They're signed up at that point.
@brotherflounder Sure, which is what happened. And CBO overestimated the power of the mandate. But I'm guessing people won't give up Medicaid if they have it
Lessons from Virginia primary: Trump Effect and the limits of Bernie Sanders. https://t.co/5cdnw20OwQ via @LifeZette
@brotherflounder I'm not sure I get the point.
@Josh_Moon … And not having Medicaid expansion should have meant MORE exchange customers.
@Josh_Moon States were never required to set up exchanges. That was always voluntary …
@Snertly @Josh_Moon The CBO projects higher prices in the short run and then lower prices over the long run. Given CBO track record, though, I'd be skeptical.
@Josh_Moon CBO's Medicaid projections are not based on the waivers. It's based on the original bill, which had no waiver provision.
@brotherflounder So people getting Medicaid completely for free will give up that free benefit because the government doesn't mandate it? Makes no sense.
@Josh_Moon Sure, but CBO vastly overestimated the number of people who would sign up through the exchanges. Didn't even come close.
@Josh_Moon … To take one example, CBO projects millions will leave Medicaid NEXT YEAR, even though changes don't take effect till 2020.
@Josh_Moon The CBO assumes people won't get insurance unless the government mandates it …
@Josh_Moon You realize the CBO numbers are bogus, right? Not to defend the GOP health bill, but the CBO makes some pretty questionable assumptions.
@Josh_Moon Where do the numbers come from?
@Russian_Starr OK, so there's a general white privilege. But in this case, it doesn't seem to apply. Can we agree on that?
@Russian_Starr Context was Hodgkinson specifically. "He's a white man and media privileges white men-even criminals." But it didn't privilege him.
@Russian_Starr But you said this particular person enjoyed white privilege. It's hard to argue that in this specific case. He was shot dead.
@Russian_Starr He was shot dead. So that doesn't seem like much privilege.

@StevenTDennis Sure, but the mandate isn't making very well.
@StevenTDennis Doesn't do the insurance market any good now, though, if they wait until they are old (or sick).
@StevenTDennis That means the young get overcharged. They already aren't buying (even though the government commands them to).
@StevenTDennis Yeah, not defending ACHA. It was flawed in a lot if ways. But if we accept older peole can be charged more seems sicker should be too.

@StevenTDennis Obama limited it to convictions. But EO language, I think, allows Trump to act more broadly. All, after all, are deportable.
@StevenTDennis Definitely had to pass background check. Question is what about people with gang ties but no convictions?
@Josh_Moon Yeah, I never said vouchers were cure-all for everything. But I think we ought to make choice more widely available.
@Josh_Moon If minority kids use vouchers, it makes private schools more diverse. Or many rich families don't want that?
@Josh_Moon Suppose it depends on where you are talking about. In D.C., voucher programs was very popular among low-income families.
@Josh_Moon How is it that state devotes $10K to private schools?
@Josh_Moon In other areas, liberals lead the charge against privileges for the wealthy.
@Josh_Moon I just never understood why on this one area, liberals were OK with inequality. Rich have options. Poor, not so much.
@StevenTDennis Even under Obama, DACA didn't apply to people deemed public safety risk, correct? (i.e. gang ties).
Join me at 1:15 on @fmtalk1065 to talk national politics.

@IndependentinAL We recognize  impact of trade with trade-adjustment grants to help displaced workers. Nothing comparable for immigration.

@IndependentinAL Natives less willing to work for rock-bottom wages. Even when natives do take those jobs, wages are lower. Supply/demand.
@IndependentinAL And the biggest beneficiaries are wealthy people and businesses. Low-skill immigration increases income inequality.
@IndependentinAL … Immigration is a crutch that allows us to avoid figuring out how to help that population.
@IndependentinAL Perhaps, but the folks hurt the most are the most marginal in our country — low-skill, low-education natives …
@IndependentinAL … Like trade, immigration creates winners &amp; losers. Yet we often don't even want to acknowledge that indisputable fact.
@IndependentinAL There is no question immigration increases national wealth. Problem is, it's not evenly distributed …

@StevenTDennis Well, certainly Medicaid accounts for more than 6 million by itself.
@StevenTDennis He's probably counting only the exchanges minus people who lost insurance they had.
@Josh_Moon You are right about that. The government has looked the other way on immigration for far too long.
@Josh_Moon I literally don't know what that means. Mass immigration makes tomatoes cheap because it depresses wages.
@Josh_Moon well, the proper response would be to change the law. If you can't get that done, the law should be respected.
@Josh_Moon To be clear, though: There is no basis that "millions" of people voted fraudulently.
@Josh_Moon 2008 and 2010 examined. Point is that there likely is some level of non-citizen voting in every election.
