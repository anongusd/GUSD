Wearing blackface in school does not impede ones ability to govern.		Advocating infanticide does.
We need to learn to forgive. Each and every one of us has done one or more stupid deed in our lifetime, and if we are going to hold grudges on everything anyone has done, we are destroying humanity. That applies to Northam, Neeson, Kevin Hart, etc.
Why do liberals listen to @Maddow, @MichaelEDyson, etc. instead of @JonHaidt?

Israels 143-mile border wall cut its illegal immigration rate by 99%, But democrats pretend that a wall is ineffective.
Federal, State and Local costs of illegal immigration is around $135 billion a year, But democrats argue that a $5.7 billion dollar wall is "expensive".
Over 17,000 illegal immigrants are trafficked into the U.S. each year, But democrats care more about their base.
80% Of Women and Girls who cross the southern border are Raped along the way, but Democrats think that protecting the border is immoral.
17,000 adults with criminal records, 6000 gang members, were apprehended at the southern border, But Democrats think it's no big deal.
In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics were seized at the southern border, But democrats whine about employees not getting their paycheck.

Now Robert Mueller wants Michael Cohen charged with lying to congress. If @Comey was right about not interfering with congress when it involved Hillary why is it different when it comes to Cohen?
@Comey answered that the reason an investigation had not been opened yet was that, "out of respect for the legislative branch being a separate branch, we do not commence investigations that focus on activities before Congress without Congress asking us to get involved."
On July 7, 2016, @jasoninthehouse asked @Comey why the FBI is not investigating Hillary Clinton for lying to Congress.

@TheRaDR A person who's primary act in America is breaking the immigration laws is not protected under the Torah.

I never thought I'll say this, but go learn from @TheRevAl how we preserve democracy and freedom. It may be difficult, but it's worth it.
But today we see social media companies like @Twitter, @YouTube, and @facebook censor free speech, we see companies like @GoDaddy, @stripe, and @PayPal denying services from companies like @getongab who allow the free flow of ideas, and worst of all - the media is applauding it.
Even @TheRevAl and @NYAmNews understood that in order to ensure liberty and justice for all, you also have to defend, painfully, the liberty of people who hate you and wish you ill.
@NYAmNews editor @elinortatum said: "Amsterdam News loathes and despises everything that the Klan stands for, but we have to stand up for their constitutional right to march in New York City."
‚ÄúWe absolutely denounce the Klan. The question here is whether the mayor can violate their First Amendment rights.‚Äù @TheRevAl said.
In October of 1999, The NYPD imposed a ban on a planned KKK rally.		@TheRevAl's @NationalAction and African-American newspaper @NYAmNews joined the Klan in their legal battle to overturn the ban.
