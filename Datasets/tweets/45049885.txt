@JudgeJeanine Whats even more crazy than this statement is Republicans who think all of Broward county should be "disqualified." Why would be punish legit voters for a voting officials terrible job? Its not the constituents fault. Punish the officials but count the damn votes.

@OATH101stUSARMY @DLoesch @SteveLevitan Ok? Your point? Cause my point is there is obviously a problem in the process if someone with nerve damage in a limb is excluded from owning a firearm as if they have a mental disability. So why not fix that problem instead of scrapping a otherwise good idea?
@OATH101stUSARMY @DLoesch @SteveLevitan Who in their right mind would want a person with a legitimate mental illness to own firearm. In fact, it takes a serious mental illness to be approved for ssdi, so that just hurts your arguement even more.
@OATH101stUSARMY @DLoesch @SteveLevitan The same people who approve ssdi because of a mental illness should be able to report said mental illness  in a background check. Nerve damage in a limb is not a mental illness so it and other disabilities should be exempt from reporting in a background check regarding a firearm.
@Murttgen @AndrewLoeschner @shannonrwatts @DLoesch @MomsDemand @NRA She would probably respond with a "America has a mental illness problem"

@Murttgen @AndrewLoeschner @shannonrwatts @DLoesch @MomsDemand Thank you. It can be said of any community. If we keep ourselves accountable and responsible, we will be stronger. Instead of coming together after a mass shooting with a real solution, the @NRA comes together to try and fear monger so their base thinks the #2a is under attack.
@Murttgen @AndrewLoeschner @shannonrwatts @DLoesch @MomsDemand She, and the association she speaks for, ultimately hurts the gun owner community. @DLoesch has the ability and responsibility to create a culture of responsible gun ownership but she instead chooses the opposite.
@Murttgen @AndrewLoeschner @shannonrwatts @DLoesch @MomsDemand Great fury in non gun owners and law abiding gun owners as well. People like @shannonrwatts would have never started these grassroots movements if people like @DLoesch did a better job influencing her followers to do the right thing and accept gun laws that will make us safer.
@BetteMidler My ancestry is full of Americans who fought for change in wars in American soil. We no longer have to combat, we've come to a position of voting and intellectuals. Dont let Republicans take us back to bad times.

@BlindFaithBook @TrumpitAll @jboystanley76 @HillaryClinton @Seahawks There are a lot of black men and woman who do lead that example too. There is nothing wrong with pointing out the injustice as well.		Also, "young blacks"? I dont think you would appreciate references like "to young whites."

@BlindFaithBook @jboystanley76 @HillaryClinton Trust between the police and the community is actually key. This protest didnt show up over night. This was long over due... the police and justice system were not keeping themselves accountable nor did they care too. We can get past this as a country. We have to get past denial.

@jboystanley76 @HillaryClinton Ive seen and it was just as wrong as the others. Do you have more info on how the police officer was handled after the murder?
@DeliberativeAss @HillaryClinton I dont but they usually call me "Miss" or "Hun" or some other term of endearment. Ive witnessed a lot of police interactions and its blatant there is favor. We also live in a world of technology and we have documented proof of injustice. 🤷‍♀️
@brady62 @HillaryClinton Poverty is too a factor. I do not want to divide at all, I want everyone to be equal and recieve equal justice. Then ill shut up.
@jboystanley76 @HillaryClinton Poverty is a factor in police brutality of course. Youre less likely to be able to defend yourself. But when youre a poor person of color, your chances of being profiled and undervalued are even greater. Im from Deltona, its a town over from Sanford FL. Trayvon Martin. I get it.

@TalbertSwan @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @Cornell They knew the best chance for survival was to ensure a country where everyone can survive. No matter race, gender, religion, or social class.		We are still waiting for the modern day wealthy to catch on. 🗝⏰
@TalbertSwan @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump 14 generations ago, my family came to America as wealthy english settlers. Rupublicans and nationalist believe that maintaining wealth is the key to survival of their blood down the line. My family invested in the country and community instead. (Example: @Cornell)
@TalbertSwan @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump I will not conform to Trump supporters and allow my standards to leave others behind. Community is everyone, not just myself and other white people. Americans need to understand that once we leave people behind, everyone else is vulnerable to be left behind at some point as well.
@TalbertSwan I tried considering Trump in the beginning and respect was not reciprocated. @BarackObama made it known (repeatedly), whether you voted for me or not, I will still do the best for you and all Americans. @realDonaldTrump has done everything to show us he's the opposite.

@ladyoutlander72 @TheRightSided1 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars No. If you use your verizon service to harass another person, that person would first contact local law enforcement and go thru the process of pressing charges if they want, if successful they can issue the findings to verizon who then can decide to end your services.
@ladyoutlander72 @TheRightSided1 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars What you do have the right to do, is start your own platform. Conservatives try, but its not as successful as more inclusive media. 🤷‍♀️
@ladyoutlander72 @TheRightSided1 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars Except they can:		"What are Verizon’s rights to limit or end Service or end this Agreement?		# 2c		(c) "spam," or engage in other abusive messaging or calling;"		https://t.co/q2GHrrDb77		🤷‍♀️🤔
@ladyoutlander72 @TheRightSided1 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars I dont like that they can choose what i see based on algorithms either but unfortunately its in the member agreement when we sign up.

Wow. We actually agree on something. https://t.co/dl1aiyENUa
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars You expect a lot from a random twitter person. I have a children and an actual life to attend to. Im sorry you have so much time on your hands and that you chose to use it to twitter rant. You're adorable. 😂😂
@ladyoutlander72 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars 39 pages of legal jargon. Wonderful. It'll be awhile.
@arelab13 @TheRightSided1 @JackPosobiec @infowars This is where people like @KyleKashuv and Alex Jones are different. He has a different opinion even though he's been through the same experience as @AMarch4OurLives. Neither party lie and harass eachother. So even though I dont agree, I will defend Kyles right to his opinion.
@arelab13 @TheRightSided1 @JackPosobiec @infowars Lol. I will always defend a persons right to their opinion even if I dont agree. The apparent difference between you and I is that I will never defend someone harassing and spreading lies about grieving parents who just want to stop a terrible (preventable) tragedy.
@ladyoutlander72 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars Maybe this will help		https://t.co/Vrt6OWkc7j
@ladyoutlander72 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars Then there is always fox news I guess? The point is we have a right to speech but we have no right to force media platforms to allow it.
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars From drugs or terrible education? 😂😂😂 You just cant help yourself can you. Do you defend hate speech because its just simply apart of you? I hope you find the peace you need because it seems you are disturbed. Have a great day.
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars Hate speech can be used as a form of harassment. Are you allowed to sit with your peers and use hate speech? Unfortunately yes. But once you start following someone around, speaking hate and harassing someone. Its illegal. He did that with his podcast and followers.

@ladyoutlander72 @blairanton @JackPosobiec @infowars So you're actually upset with media platforms for choosing to not allow such things on their networks. They can always join NRAtv? If they dont go bankrupt that is.		#WhenGoodPeopleWin
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars "My fragile little mind" is fine. You're obviously upset. And no, you cant just say anything in the US. There are laws that stem from the constitution that do not allow hate speech. You can't harass someone with no repercussion. But again, thanks for your opinion.
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars Thanks for your opinion.
@blairanton @TheRightSided1 @JackPosobiec @infowars Like this tweet. "You've never read the Constitution." I think you've never read the Constitution."		Difference. Plus, defamation is when there were physical or financial damages because of his lies. Please tell me how Rosie has hurt Don this way? He lost nothing from her context
@blairanton @ladyoutlander72 @JackPosobiec @infowars The difference is defamation. Lies spread that hurt them enough it was proven in court. "I think they are crisis actors." Vs "they are crisis actors."		Difference.
@TheRightSided1 @arelab13 @JackPosobiec @infowars I have and I have an ancestor who signed it. 😂
@ChrisdeCearsaig @livininpa2 @JackPosobiec @infowars @RealAlexJones Tell it to the judge who ruled in the sandy hook parents favor. They had to prove damages to win defamation
Even better with no sound 😂 https://t.co/AH12fh6u0s
@KrysyndaDay @mediachecker @glennbeck @CNN @PhillyANTIFA @charliekirk11 I never equated that? Or even mentioned 60s protest. I think you've misunderstood. I responded to a tweet like that though.
@ladyoutlander72 @JackPosobiec @infowars Why does everyone seem to confuse an opinion with hate speech and lies? He wasnt saying "i think they are crisis actors" he was saying "they are crisis actors." 		There. Is. A. Difference.
@livininpa2 @JackPosobiec @infowars He has a right to an opinion. He does not have a right to defamation and hate speech.
@Akishbettie @JackPosobiec @infowars They actually sought after him the legal was with a defamation lawsuit and won. They proved in court that he spread lies about them. There is a difference.
@TheRightSided1 @JackPosobiec @infowars There is a difference between free speech and hate speech. Hate speech is not protected by our Constitution.
@KrysyndaDay @mediachecker @glennbeck @CNN @PhillyANTIFA @charliekirk11 And plantation owners didnt appoint black slave drivers because they thought it would earn them favor and decrease the likelihood of revolt 🙄 she says she is off the liberal plantation but she really joined a conservative one to excuse them of racism and propaganda
@mediachecker @KrysyndaDay @glennbeck @CNN It was @PhillyANTIFA who claimed responsibility. It was pretty fluffy for antifa if you ask me but if you know who @charliekirk11 was you'd know why no one cares they caught some water. She might as well have been uncle ruckus driven from a restaurant. https://t.co/9gLYIn7LE7
@kylegriffin1 This whole Trump catastrophe started from @realDonaldTrump's hate for @BarackObama. It isnt too far fetched that #Russia, the  @GOP and/or the @NRA got together and picked the most likely person they could puppet in the Oval office. I probably would have picked Lil Donnie too.
@JackPosobiec @infowars Disgusting how many people care about Alex Jones voice over the voices of slain childrens parents whom he slandered. He was wrong @JackPosobiec.

@LadyThriller69 Ive been treated poorly by far left liberals too because im pretty center but it doesnt make me abandon my own views which are more left leaning tham right. I get it but the appearance of a full swing is probably why they feel betrayed. Just insight from my perspective.
@DLoesch Aww look @CameronCam29 you got a xo, maybe thats her new queue to her followers of where to direct hate mail and death threats.
@logan48227 @TheView You're right.
@tunertap @LadyThriller69 Amen to that
@LadyThriller69 I just think it misleads the public from your intentions which are good.
@LadyThriller69 Its being director of pr for @MAGAFirstNews thats leads to such assumptions. But thanks for clarifying.
@rob_sheridan Yes wasnt it odd she said shes on the white house working on her agendas yet she didn't attend sports day on the Whitehouse lawn?

@LadyThriller69 I know
@LadyThriller69 I get it.
@LadyThriller69 Classifying whole groups of people because of some who harassed you is how many people I know became or grew more racist too. The most racist person i know was gang raped by black men in highschool so he blames all black people. I dont see a difference between his hate and this.
@LadyThriller69 So all liberals? Including myself?
@LadyThriller69 Probably because you were authentically independent and your tweets reflect that but now all the liberal hate is coming out of you and its just sad

@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv They should get more attention. They are heros. I agree.
@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv I would be for armed guards even veterans in schools after mental health checks of course
@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv They could help for sure but the kids will still be at risk while coming in and leaving the school, its still a large movement of students. Texas doesnt have lock up laws so the kid had access to his dads guns. We cant guarantee laws will protect us but we should still have them.
@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv Im sorry, my phone died. I think the gun registries and confiscation risk could be addressed together, for instance making it a local registery. Its the same way these legal cannabis or sanctuary cities protect themselves. Responsible gun laws on a state level.
@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv unable to get to their guns. We should blame all those "responsible owners" who didnt secure or report the guns stolen. I have guns, I have children, its not a hard decisions still. 2/2
@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv There are not background checks for private sales in most states. I understand why locking them up would take time to get them out but not that much time. But gun reform advocates are not to blame for the need, more people are hurt from stolen guns not locked up then people 1/2

@TacticianWang @bjoewolf @KyleKashuv Im all for law abiding citizens to own guns. But the laws need to include accountability. Storage, sales, background checks, and having them taken away with charges of domestic violence. We do this and majority gun owners will still be law abiding. What is everyone afraid of?
@omegabyte @dettolah @Luis_Savery @charliekirk11 What they chose to name it doesnt matter, poor chose cause people like you but it still what happens that matters. No diplomas only ceremony of the students and accomplishments with guest like the other events.

@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 When I said we here I mean the democrats who are truly progressive  and not racist. This attack is on democrats as a whole. Which includes myself.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 No, but thank you
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Black and white, people of all colors made the switch.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Last time I checked, the political parties dont get to approve who joins or affiliates with the party. They can only deny unwanted ideology, which they do. Racist are republican too, yet the party doesnt refuse them? Why?
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Thanks
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Nothing new to me. You are the one putting words in my mouth that were never said or typed.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Im sorry, is @charliekirk11 black?	Or is he allowed to comment only because he agrees with you? Because I havent said a single thing out of context. Thanks
@FoxNews Juat here to see all your racist followers comments
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Who chimed in on a white person? Racist much?
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Ooooook 👏 whatever makes you feel better
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 My own family? No they are not black if youd like to ask one more time. &amp; im not saying all democrat were all the sudden not racist in the 1960s, im say thats when it started. Some stayed im sure.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Why are you going so far off topic? And if you want to argue whos more black maybe you should argue with another black person? Cause attempting to corner me with race questions when im clearly not black is just counter productive.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Lol. Let pull up my old black person application forms i made them fill out and ill get back to you
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Democrats in the early 1900s were racist yes. In the 1960s the racist dem exited to vote republican.  I appreciate party loyalty but if dems switched platforms again today then it's always country over party and we'd vote accordingly.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 "We" as in my family.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 👏👏👏👏 😂
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Ive talked to plenty elderly Americans of all shades sweetheart.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Lol please quote me where i said anything about what "black people" were doing in 1968. And what does myself knowing "elderly black people" have to so with it? 		You cry assumptions and then assume. Do you know me?
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 Not a "wild opinionated assumption," its called a "educated guess." Which means Ive done a lot of reading on Lincoln and its clear the righteous man he was. My educated guess would be that he would be a god fearing democrat like Obama.
@augustsonshine2 @apexpredator112 @charliekirk11 So your family stayed republican even after how drasticly the gop has changed, and you agree that people still live on the "democrat plantation"? That a legit question. Because it sounds like GOP are the one stringing you and your family along. We saw the change, why didnt you?
