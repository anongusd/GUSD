But today, I join leaders across our country in calling on the Trump Administration to abandon this new proposed rule and reinstate the #CleanPowerPlan so we can provide the global leadership necessary to confront this threat.
Through the @USClimate, we are already working with states to uphold the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
Put simply, it‚Äôs a bad idea to abandon any tool we have to fight climate change together.
This proposed replacement of the #CleanPowerPlan will make our efforts to reduce carbon pollution more difficult, and will remove a strong incentive for state and federal governments to work together to clean up our air.
We have worked hard in Delaware to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and partner with other states in addressing pollution that feeds rapid climate change.
The #CleanPowerPlan set national targets for carbon emission reductions, but provided flexibility for the states to determine how best to achieve these targets.
Rising average temperatures and stronger storms pose risks to our $8 billion agricultural industry and threaten our natural resources. And unchecked air pollution presents health risks for all Delawareans.
Delawareans up and down our state are already experiencing the effects of climate change and sea level rise. Delaware is the lowest-lying U.S. state, and 17,000 homes here are at permanent risk of inundation.

Congress and the President need to step up and fix the mess that our immigration system has become.
I served in Congress, and I watched for six years as that body failed to pass a comprehensive immigration policy that would secure our borders in a way that upholds the values of this great country.
If President Trump revokes the current inhumane policy of separating children from their parents, Delaware will be first in line to assist our sister states in securing the border.
Under normal circumstances, we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to answer the call. But given what we know about the policies currently in effect at the border, I can‚Äôt in good conscience send Delawareans to help with that mission.
Today, we received a request to send DE National Guard troops to the southwest border.

If we fail to show restraint, we are setting ourselves up for difficult budget challenges next year or the year after that could require us to cut the very programs we‚Äôre funding this year.
The fact remains that our spending needs over the next several years will outgrow our ability to pay for them.
We‚Äôve been focused since I took office on limiting spending growth, on directing one-time revenue into one-time investments, and on making sure we don‚Äôt spend beyond our means. The new DEFAC estimates don‚Äôt change our priorities.

Delaware‚Äôs English Learner Strategic Plan helps lay the groundwork for us to improve our delivery of services to these children. The Advisory Council on English Learners will help keep us accountable to the strategies and goals outlined in the plan.
Since 1997, the number of English learners in DE has increased by 433 percent. 	This school year, DE public K-12 schools serve nearly 12,000 English learners.
Our state‚Äôs changing demographics require us to think differently about how we reach all Delaware students, and especially our English learners, to ensure they acquire the language skills they need to be ready for success in college, career, and life.

If it is permissible under the opinion, full-scale sports gaming could be available at Delaware‚Äôs casinos before the end of June.
We believe that Delaware likely already has all necessary laws and regulations in place to implement full-scale sports gaming under the direction of the Delaware Lottery.
Specifically, we will be looking at whether the opinion allows Delaware to offer full-scale sports gaming beyond parlay betting on National Football League games that was reinstituted in 2009.
In the coming days, the lottery office will consult with the Delaware Attorney General‚Äôs Office to more fully understand the details and impact of this decision on Delaware.
But when the Supreme Court took this case last year, the Delaware Lottery began preparing for the possibility that the Court could overturn the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act.

We support the notion of energy diversity, but the environmental and economic importance of the Atlantic Ocean must be weighed against the potential unintended consequences of these types of activities.
As Gov. @LarryHogan, @GovMalloyOffice, @MassGovernor, @NC_Governor, @GovRaimondo, @GovernorVA and I said in our letter to @SecretaryZinke, each of our states has unique natural resources and an economy that is reliant on tourism as an essential driver.
Drilling for oil and gas in the Atlantic off Delaware‚Äôs coast would create the risk of a catastrophic spill or other related disasters that would not only threaten our natural resources, but pose serious threats to Delaware‚Äôs economy.
I signed a letter with a bipartisan group of Atlantic state Governors opposing the Trump Administration's plan to allow oil and gas drilling in the Atlantic Ocean.

I got to know Jamie well throughout my career in state government and as Lieutenant Governor. He could always be counted on for direct and sound advice.

Needless to say, they are as angry & frustrated as I am. They want political gamesmanship to end. They want a solution - time is running out
Spent most of day on Capitol Hill & headed to State Fair for after. Leaving now. Wanted to hear directly from Delawareans about debt ceiling
@CancerVixxen working hard to put an end to this. I'm hopeful that House & Senate will quickly pass reasonable bill w bipartisan support
@dtwalker91 Senator Reid has bill to raise debt ceiling into 2013 and includes more cuts than the amount we're raising the debt ceiling
Boehner bill is 6-month fix. Doesn‚Äôt solve problem: rating agencies say they will downgrade U.S. creditrating unless larger agreement passed
Shouldn‚Äôt he be talking to Dems so he can get a bipartisan bill that will pass both chambers? This bill is DOA when it arrives in Senate
This is ridiculous. We‚Äôre spending all night here so the Speaker can pass a bill with no D votes so it can go to Senate to be defeated
But we must not allow a default in the first place. Congress needs to act quickly to prevent a completely avoidable crisis.
I've introduced legislation to ensure that Members of Congress don't receive pay during default or retroactively http://tinyurl.com/3bf8tzh
500 Delaware jobs will be saved under Harim USA's now-approved takeover of Allen Family Foods http://bit.ly/qbwgrl
I believe that a significant number of both Democrats and Republicans would support such a plan -- if they were allowed to vote on it.
Why is he insisting on preventing vote on reasonable framework that polls consistently show the overwhelming majority of Americans support?
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Speaker Boehner should bring a bipartisan, balanced compromise to the House floor.
This debate is not a game. This debate is about the future of the United States economy.
It's entirely clear that we've reached this point because Republicans are simply unwilling to compromise.
