Happy 216th Birthday Ohio! I‚Äôm proud to represent the Buckeye State and the wonderful people of the Second District today and every day.
Otto Warmbier‚Äôs imprisonment and death were heinous crimes at the hands of the brutal Kim Jong Un regime. We must never forget this regime‚Äôs despicable human rights record, even as we work to denuclearize the country.

As well, U.S. Forces will remain at al-Tanf, a base in southern Syria near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders.
It was a wise and strategically smart decision by @POTUS to maintain an international security presence in northeast Syria. This military presence maintains a needed strength to oppose ISIS as well as serving as a buffer between Syrian Kurds and Turkish military.

Border security is a key component of our national security, the common defense, and homeland security. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/SKlhHwGAsg
Sometime between 9/11 and today, our conversation about border security got muddled. The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes ‚Äì all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of immigration policy.
I am grateful to live in a nation where more people want to come in, not out. However, open or unsecure borders put the lawless ahead of those who play by the rules. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/YZDuzSqydQ
Funding for border security shouldn‚Äôt be a political point. This should be about keeping Americans safe, keeping illicit drugs out of our country, protecting families, and our precious lives. #SecureOurBorder https://t.co/LRM681EF68
Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders. #SecureOurBorder
Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, ‚Äú. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.‚Äù
Our border security weaknesses invite a humanitarian crisis. Without a wall, we leave room for drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other threats to enter our country. We must secure our borders to know who and what is coming into our country. #SecureOurBorder
60,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended crossing the border last month. We need a wall and increased border security to help enforce and strengthen our nation‚Äôs legal immigration processes. #SecureOurBorder
Both parties agree that we have a border security crisis but Republicans also have an answer. Congress needs to approve wall funding in order to properly address the national security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border. #SecureOurBorder

We passed H.R. 3537, which would amend the Controlled Substances Act and add 22 synthetic drug compounds to the list of Schedule I Drugs.
Earlier this week the House of Representatives took action to crack down on these deadly substances.
in such a way that they don‚Äôt expressly violate existing drug laws, making it easy for them to find their way onto the streets. (2/2)
Synthetic drugs are designed to mimic or enhance the effects of natural drugs, but their chemical structures are purposely altered (1/2)
The opioid epidemic is hitting the 2nd District hard, and synthetic drugs are a significant part of the problem.
H.R. 954 would exempt those who lost their health insurance under the co-op program from paying the individual mandate penalty.
Americans who have been failed by Obamacare deserve a break, not another blow.
Now these individuals are faced with 2 choices: find other coverage fast or pay the individual mandate penalty.
17 of the original 23 co-op programs have flopped, costing taxpayers over $1.8 billion and leaving thousands without health insurance.
Obamacare is a disaster for many reasons, but the co-op program is one of the law‚Äôs most recent and visible failings.

Here's a look at what's coming up on the House floor this week: https://t.co/7ao4K69D01
Proud to vote for H. Res. 639, a vote to stop POTUS from ignoring the law of the land and undermining American people's voice in Congress.
House has passed H. Res. 639, which authorizes @SpeakerRyan to submit an amicus brief to SCOTUS, defending Congress' Article I powers.
In April SCOTUS will hear arguments for U.S. v. Texas, a case challenging 1 recent example of executive overreach: POTUS immigration orders.
The Constitution is clear: legislature makes laws, executive enforces them. But POTUS has repeatedly bypassed Congress to enact his agenda.
Glad to see the Obama administration finally recognize ISIS brutality for what it is: genocide. https://t.co/OqZNxu9oL8
.@RepBobGibbs Thanks for asking me to speak!  https://t.co/mfPGDpnVLt
American voters deserve a say in filling SCOTUS seat, one that is likely to have a generational impact on the Court and the nation.
I stand with @Senate_GOPs and their decision not to act on a SCOTUS nomination until our new president takes office.
The Constitution gives POTUS power to nominate Supreme Court justices. The same document gives the Senate equal power to refuse his nominee.

Repeated claims that GTMO is a recruiting tool, or costs are too high when compared to alternatives, are simply not in line with the facts.
GTMO = critical element to our fight against terrorists. Yet the Pres. continues to search for a problem to satisfy his solution to close it

These dangerous times demand clarity in America‚Äôs moral leadership.		Name the enemy, stand w/ our allies, and leave no daylight in between.
The strategy to defeat ISIS is not to strip Americans of their #2A rights, rely on others for leadership, nor runout the clock in the fight
We are not going to win if we let their deliberate fear &amp; terror change the nature of our society, through limiting freedoms or feeding hate
...which is, unfortunately, under-recognized when this Administration falsely calls ISIS the JV team or claims that the threat is contained
The violent struggle of radical Islam against free and open society continues to be a national security threat ...

In the months ahead, it will be up to Congress to stop the #IranDeal and prevent a Middle East nuclear arms race.
#IranDeal removes Qasem Soleimani from the sanctions list, an Iranian general who has long aided Hamas and Hezbollah.
#IranDeal doesn‚Äôt allow for anytime, anywhere inspections of Iran‚Äôs nuclear facilities.
#IranDeal doesn‚Äôt secure the release of the American hostages in Iran.
Since 1979, Iran has seldom acted in good faith, &amp; is the world‚Äôs largest state sponsor of terror. Today‚Äôs #IranDeal sounds like a bad deal.
