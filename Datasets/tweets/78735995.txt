I find the Netflix hate absurd. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the Oscars are about celebrating the filmmaking process. Directing, editing, acting and so on. Why shouldn‚Äôt a Netflix movie excelling in the filmmaking process be honored? https://t.co/0gde0yYl5O

So, no doubt this wasn't the most exciting #SuperBowl. But in all seriousness, credit does have to go to both defenses.
Very close again, but Gostkowski seals the win. #SuperBowl
They can kick a field goal and finish things off. #SuperBowl

Changing my prediction. Rams win, two safeties, 4-3. #SuperBowl
The last game of 2018's Stanley Cup Finals is going to be higher scoring than this. #SuperBowl
Still a good move to go for it there on fourth down I think. Maybe should have been a run, but the defense has played well so far. Why not take a chance? #SuperBowl
Amazing how open Edelman gets when running routes. Wow. #SuperBowl
üëç https://t.co/Pn2qIwSaP3
At least the low score is more because of good defensive plays and less to offensive mistakes. #SuperBowl

In all fairness to the #NBRAwards, it's pretty nice to see A Quiet Place, First Reformed, Can You Ever Forgive Me and Eighth Grade honored.
With that in mind, the campaign for First Man has crashed. It's going to need some sort of spark real soon to snag some momentum. #NBR

@totalfilm There are even real life examples. Look at Jerome Bettis, won a Super Bowl in his home city and retired on the podium. That's a happy ending to that chapter in his life.
@totalfilm Life does give people victories sometimes and movies with happy endings are about showcasing those victories that people experience.
@totalfilm I don't think they're unhealthy. If they're not earned I can understand them not being justified, but many films are about extraordinary moments in life. No, happy endings don't always happen in real life, but that doesn't mean they don't happen.
