@RNicholasBurns @MaxBoot @USCGJerusalem Unfortunately, this is read by Palestinian public as a sign of indifference to them. Administration needs to take steps to reach out to Palestinians if it is to have any hope for its plan.
@CNN Richard is a visionary, and no doubt he will bring that to his next challenge.
@mdubowitz Absolutely, aside from being the right thing to do, it would put more pressure on the regime.
@TreyYingst Very worrisome—neither side may seek a war, but neither wants to appear to back down.
@Norman_Roule Quite a prize.
@mdubowitz I, too, think this is mostly a maneuver. But it is a maneuver because he is under pressure from the IRGC. There are elite politics and competition between pragmatists who believe confrontation threatens the Islamic R, and those who see it sustaining them and the regime’s ideology
The president’s reversal on Syria is good news. The bad news is no one knows when the next reversal will come.  It is not “brilliant” when no one can count on you and won’t, therefore, go out on a limb that they fear you will saw off.

What Washington—and Iran—Should Take Away from the Warsaw Conference - The Washington Institute for Near East Policy There isn’t normalization but there is a new normal between Israel and Arab states largely because of Iran’s threats to both.   https://t.co/KWLYm2kdMi
At the Warsaw Conference, I conducted back to back discussions first with three Arab ministers and then with Israeli PM Netanyahu. Same room, same views of Iran’s aggressive, threatening posture in the Middle East, and unmistakable convergence of what should be done to counter it
The PA may not like it, but Arab states will pursue their interests even when the Palestinian leadership opposes. Case in point: the Warsaw Conference. Arab states had more of an interest in arguing for unity of effort against Iran than boycotting a conference the PA opposed.

Israel has found a way to raise the costs to Iran in Syria. But the Iranians are now doing more on Syrian bases, believing the Russians will limit Israeli strikes against those targets. Israel is making clear Syrian bases are not off limits if Iran puts advanced missiles there.
Whether countering Iran or managing Russia, Israel is on its own in Syria. The targets it hit yesterday did not draw a Russian response—so far. The Iranians took a new step, firing a missile with a big payload from a Syrian base. Iron Dome destroyed it. Escalation is likely.

Contd: Iran leaving Syria was never in the cards. Bolton should also seek to use our presence  to get Putin to pressure Assad to stop the new, dangerous Iranian practice of building their missile capability in joint Iranian-Syrian bases.  It will trigger wider war at some point.
John Bolton has now declared that the withdrawal from Syria will be based on two conditions,ISIS defeated and unable to return and safety for our Kurdish partners who carried the brunt of the fighting in the ground against ISIS.  Iran or Shia militia presence is not a condition.

@TRTWorldNow There is a need for the world to put pressure on the Houthis and not just the Saudis on Yemen.
It is clearly better that the US withdrawal from Syria will be over 4 months rather than one. But the strategic reality is the same: our enemies know they just have to wait, we get nothing for it, and our friends in this region know they are in their own.
