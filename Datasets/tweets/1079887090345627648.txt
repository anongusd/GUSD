@realDonaldTrump You literally just said "much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built",so why do you keep insisting you need more money? Need more plaques with your name on it? https://t.co/kuLNggNABB
@KR_Archive @realDonaldTrump Yep. More people should be made aware of this. It proves he  wants a monument with his name on it. If you read several legitimate sources they cover this but I like to use the NPR link because the picture shows up. https://t.co/kuLNggNABB
@johnbufford @realDonaldTrump Yep. He managed to add this though along with taking credit for stuff he's not done nor opted to do. He also continually misinformed about the amount of money. https://t.co/9GjkTpDWPf
@realDonaldTrump Wrong! You're claiming that all FUTURE money earned by us from them via trading will pay for the wall, but you CANNOT self appropriate where that money will be used. Congress has to approve it, hence why you're still throwing a fit and keeping our government shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump More propaganda of yours to brainwash the gullible people that support you. 	You keep talking credit for the wall that, like you just said, is already built, but YOU haven't done much of the work! Only a small section already ordered by Obama to be renovated. https://t.co/NXYN7lgQ8A

@realDonaldTrump Then there will be money for the wall YEARS from now. You have to wait. 	Now that we know where Mexico's FUTURE money will be spent, you no longer need the Democrats approval for funding now and can stop spreading fake news about them. Open up the government NOW!
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Was this one of them? 	Remember when Trump was already given $1.6B this year. https://t.co/Ifazv7x3CH
