@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC I'm sorry that you think I wasted your time but you never said o e thing about whether the wall keeps prisoners inside. You said well effective but there are escaped right??
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Corrupt is our criminal justice system let's talk about that	 We can agree to disagree on the other.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Seriously
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC So 11 million people are in this country illegally and that's not a problem.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Escapes really how many yearly
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC The same way it will keep illegals out.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Understood but you simply have no choice but to accept the fact t that it's true. The wall keeps prisoners in.
@jkbjournalist @RollingStone Taxpayers are also subsidising fraud being committed by prosecutors and judges that cover it up. Get a handle on it
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC I guess you are going to continue to avoid. The wall is effective by keeping prisoners inside it. The same say a wall would be effective in keeping illegals out.
Stop prosecutorial misconduct. It's a must. We can no longer tolerate this outrageous conduct. It will effect you one day through friends and family. We must stop it now
Stop prosecutorial misconduct. Corruption in our criminal justice system is our downfall.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC You still can't answer me it's a si.ple answer stop with all the rhetoric and avoidance the wall seoeratex us safely and keeps the prisoner in. Don't talk to me about the fsilurdx of the justice system it's all crooked anyway. Just tell me if the wall keeps the prisoner inside.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Can u please just tell me whether the wall that separates us from prisoners is effective.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Simple why do we have a wall around prisons. Does it effectively keep prisoners behind the wall.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Actually no you have not. It's simple why do we have a wall around prisons? Why???
@candoclemency @latimes @atownram @AnricaC Let's make this the move me #3
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC You might want to consider what it is costing you to provide for these illegals. But not only you but your family friends kids. Why don't we take care of us before we take care of others.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Wow,  you still have not answered me as to why we have a wall around a prison?  It's simple what's the answer?  It seems you don't want to answer that question. Don't know what a co is but I am assuming it's a cop. The wall keeps the prisoner inside right ?
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC It's communicating not argumentative remember?  Again you have not had a wall so you don't know whether a wall will work or not right! The analogy is a good one why do we have walls around prisons. Can you answer that. I think it's to keep people in right?
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC Quite the analogy. Let's see why do we have walls or fences around prisons??? To keep people in or out????
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC We all can have an opinion. We have me we tried a wall so there is no proof that a wall will not work.  We need to stop illegal immigration. We need to take care of our own first.
@JoshuaBHoe @LindseyGrahamSC No history has proven that without a wall we have massive illegal immigration. That's a fact. Are you able to prove that a wall would not work. Maybe it would better serve the American people to end the corruption in our federal courts and judicial system......
Wall wall wall wall wall wall nothing less stop illegal immigration.

No more immunity for prosecutors.
@StephBest85 I understand.  The new law for a into effect and you get 54 per year..  the issue is how to calculate the good time. So if you get 120 months sentence. 66.6 percent is 80 months.  Now you subtract the good time of 15% is that correct. Thank you in advance

President Donald j Trump. I implore you to investigate the southern district of fraud. Immunity is no longer acceptable for prosecutors. FIX the corrupt criminal justice system......please.
Expose the corrupt criminal justice system. It's the only way to stop it.
For too many years we have allowed our criminal justice system to be taken over by corrupt prosecutors who break the law to advance there agendas. It's time to stop them.
Amazing it's all about reform. However, there is much more to the story you must fight to take immunity away from prosecutors	It's the only way to fix the broken criminal justice system. Now's the time
No more immunity for federal prosecutors..... time for them to be held accountable......
No more immunity...	.
No more immunity for federal prosecutors..... Hold them accountable. They are not above the law....

No more immunity for federal prosecutors.... They are not above the law. Hold them accountable.
Maybe federal prosecutors should talk about all the lying and deceiving they do when they coerce plea agreements from defendants who have no idea that a federal prosecutor can lie to them to force them to plead guilty to a crime they did not commit. Let's talk about it folks.
Time to hold the southern district of Florida accountable for there blatant prosecutorial misconduct. Enough is enough. Show them they could end up in jail for what they do and they will stop.
Let's get these people home yo there families. It's disgusting already. Let's put the prosecutors in there shoes for one day
The first step has begun we are now on step two mode. Let's get going
Can anybody please tell me how the federal courts became so corrupt in the southern district of Florida.
The first step is the first step in the right direction. We now need step two Mr. President time to clean out the US attorneys office. The southern district of Florida is a bunch of bad apples in pursuit of there personal agendas
You may not like it but unfortunately there are also judges in the southern district of Florida who think they are God, above the law and untouchable. This must stop.
Does anybody really believe that our system of justice is truly fair. The southern district of Florida US attorneys office is corrupt. Why is nothing being done to root out the corruption. Remember Epstein.
My new year resolution is to fight for every person in prison. We cannot allow the wrongly convicted to rot in prisons in this great again country we call America. We must not allow for prosecutors to commit crimes to advance there personal lives. This must stop let's fight.
Let's get the campers home . Stop wasting government resources.
We need to keep working on getting people home from prison. Prosecutors are responsible for crimes that most Americans don't believe they would commit
Federal judges are not above the law Mr President. Hold them accountable.
Hold federal judges accountable.
Why are we not standing tall with the man who is trying to protect us. I just don't get it. The left is out of control
Build the wall it's not for Donald Trump it's for the American people.
Hey go Muller has got to go. Time to shut it down. Another joke in American injustice.
President Trump please open an investigation into the US attorneys office in miami. You are the only one who has the courage to put an end to the corruption. We need you to put an end to there injustices. Prosecutors and federal judges are not above the law.
When will the truth be told. The citizens of this country must be told the truth about the southern district of Florida. Prosecutors lie, they withhold evidence ,intimidate witnesses, and suborn perjury. I personally know of one. Stop the injustice
@WaqarVick I wonder how we can take back the justice system from the criminals that are running it. Comey and the rest are nothing but fraudsters.
Start the investigation
Muller should be investigating the corrupt justice department. That's where it starts his staff.....
President Trump. Why don't you have an independent investigation into prosecutorial misconduct here in the southern district of Florida. The justice of the banana republic
@ChuckGrassley thank you
Why should the federal judge in fort Lauderdale not be charged with obstruction of justice. He's covering up for the prosecutor. Hold him accountable
Does anybody know someone in the media willing to cover the exposing of these corrupt prosecutors and judge.
We need coverage so that we can expose these fraudsters. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have honest judges and honest prosecutors.
Judge _ _ _ _ _ stop allowing prosecutors to lie in your courtroom. Stop covering it up.
@SenTomCotton You sir have given an oath to the citizens of this country. That oath is not a license to lie. Stop spreading false rumors and do your job	 It's not about you it's about us. We can vote you out the same way we voted you in..
No one is above the law ! No one stop the crimes being committed by rogue prosecutors.
In fort Lauderdale federal courts prosecutors commit crimes daily. It is a crime to lie to federal judges. It is a violation of civil rights to withhold exculpatory evidence. When will the judge in fort Lauderdale stop allowing it in his courtroom.
@SallyQYates @senate4cjreform I am happy to see that you support the first step act. Can you support the removal of prosecutor immunity.
@Barbie007 it's not about the truth barbie it's about whatever they want it to be. Don't give up.
@ChuckGrassley I personally want to thank you for all that you have done to help correct these injustices. I hope that you wl continue the fight to stop the fraud being committed by prosecutors and the judges that cover it up. Please stay with us.
@SenTomCotton @24hrTVMazi Tom cotton shame on you. You have no concept of reality. These huge sentences ultimatetly become the heaviest burden on the taxpayers. By taking these people and putting them in prison for years there's nothing left to support them when they get out. That'away causes recidivism.
Take away immunity given to federal prosecutors and hold judges accountable.
@cut_50 How many votes does cotton need to pass the amendments
@SenTomCotton why won't you answer the question. Do you have any ownership interest in vendors or private prisons. I wish you could even have the ability to comprehend  the criminal justice system. It's broken and corrupt. Get it right
@SenJohnKennedy I would like to know whether you have any ownership interest in any supplier or in any private prison provider. You obviously have no concept of reality. The system is corrupt are you part of it?
I know that we're focused on first step. We're almost there. We must never forget how we got here in the first place. Let's put an end to the immunity and no accountability given to federal prosecutors. No one is above the law.
In fort Lauderdale Florida there is a federal judge covering up and or ignoring fraud being committed in his court room. Any idea why?
@senate4cjreform @jaredkushner Thank you Jared Kushner without you this could never have happened. BH

@SidneyPowell1 @24hrTVMazi @GenFlynn @mflynnJR @JosephJFlynn1 So true so true however you left out one other part which is the threats made by prosecutors. Coercion , intimidation ,lies and more
Tom cotton I'm still waiting for an answer do you own or have any interest via friends family or any business entity that either owns or supplies any product to the prison systems. Why won't you answer that question.
Federal court judges give oaths to enforce the law. They are not mandated to create the law. There failure to follow the law is injustice.
Are federal judges permitted to violate the law. No! A federal judge in ft Lauderdale Florida is doing just that. Sunday night he will be exposed.
Corruption means gross impropriety. Official use of official duty contrary to the rights of others. Stay tuned Sunday night federal judge exposed. Southern district of Florida.
Let's clear out the fraud in the federal courts in the southern district of Florida. Ft Lauderdale federal courts are covering up fraud. See it Sunday night		It's time to expose the federal judge who's allowing it to happen.

@realDonaldTrump Fake news! Let's stop the narrative. President Trump the justice department is corrupt. Take control and stop the southern district of Florida  us attorneys office from routinely committing crimes and lying to federal judges.
Let the Senate vote it's time after 30 years to fix the broken antiquated system of justice. Pass the first step act.
The miami herald is a joke . They don't report anything that they don't benefit from. They are afraid to report the truth about the us attorneys office in miami.
The miami herald is politically biased and only created the story to hurt Trump. They are not interested in reporting the truth about the us attorneys office.
The United States attorneys office in the southern district of Florida needs to be exposed. The fraud being committed by federal prosecutors is irreprehrnsible. The wave to save will expose it soon.
It's getting closer to exposing that prosecutor in the southern district of Florida. The wave to save is coming
The southern district of Florida. Federal prosecutor who lied will soon be exposed. He must be held accountable.
We can no longer accept the status quo. We cannot allow federal prosecutors to be immune from their crimes. Hold them accountable take away their immunity.
I need to stop the pain. THEY LIED AND TOOK EVERYTHING. The prosecutor lies and LIED and lied again. Stop the pain.

Hold federal prosecutors accountable. The southern district of Florida United States attorneys office is corrupt. Find out who it is.
Why should federal prosecutors get away with lying to federal judges. If a prosecutor lies to a federal judge he should be held accountable.
@SidneyPowell1 when will the pain stop Sydney. When will the suffering end. Those prosecutors must be brought to justice. No free pass for corrupt prosecutors anymore. A crime is a crime and they should be held accountable.
Robert Mueller is just like the rest. Another rogue federal prosecutor  out of control trying to fill the narrative.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President is it okay with you that federal prosecutors lie and deceive federal judges. Is it okay that federal judges cover it up. Stand up for justice.
Senator cotton do you own shares or have any interest in any prison companies or supplier. You are dead wrong about the first step act. It's strange that you would misquote the bill and it's true purpose.
Mitch McConnell this will be your legacy. Nothing more than another politician who made promises and told a whole lot of lies. This is about injustice. No more prosecutorial misconduct. Stand up for justice.
There's no justice when a federal prosecutor lies to a federal judge. There's no justice when a federal judge knows it's s lie and then ignored it. Stand up for justice .
@SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @AmericaFirstPol @mosbacher_mica @_VachelLindsay_ @Debradelai @BernardKerik @TheLastRefuge2 @JackPosobiec The fact is that Sen cotton has no concept of what the first step act does.

@shonhopwood @SenTomCotton Unfortunately for you Sen cotton you are on the wrong side. You most likely stand with the corrupt prosecutors who commit crimes everyday to put people in prison. I for one would not be surprised if it turned out you are a stock holder in some private prison llc.
