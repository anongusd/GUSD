@StephanieCarvin Ahead by a Sentry
Wishing @JoeyBats19 all the best with the @Braves . Maybe not right for the @BlueJays this season but deserved a shot somewhere. Hoping he’s got a few more monster HRs and bat flips in him before coming back to TO to see #19 added to the Level of Excellence
Dear @TSN_Sports why are you showing the Raptors game on TSN1 AND on TSN 4 tonight and not the First Four? And don’t give me the TSNGO solution, it’s garbage and isn’t even supported by airplay or chrome cast

Thank you @Encadwin for the memories. You deserved far better from the #bluejays . So incredibly disappointed in Atkins, Shapiro &amp; @Rogers
That is a brutal call for Upton. Not a strike, not a swing #ourmoment #FireDiaz

Why not put Happ or Estrada in and call up Hutch for a spot start?? @BlueJays
Great to have @DShulman_ESPN back in the booth with Buck Martinez for @BlueJays games and @jonahkeri at the desk. Well played, @Sportsnet

@BlueJays Love R. Martin but he clearly needs to rest. Remember that catcher that did great last year? He's waiting on the bench #FreeDioner
Feels like the @BlueJays are playing a spring training game versus their AA team. So many former Jays on the A's, so many current Jays HRs

Unbelievable night of baseball. And Epic collapse by the Red Sox.
