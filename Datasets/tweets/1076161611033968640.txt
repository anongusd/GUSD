Honored to have been visited by Mayor Bryan Barnett from my hometown of Rochester Hills and the rest of the team. How fitting! The first mayor from #MI11 to visit our D.C. office! Looking forward to doing great things together. https://t.co/h9hc9nRBt9
I am relieved that federal employees can finally return to work and receive their paychecks. I will fight to ensure that a permanent solution is agreed upon, and that we never have a government shutdown again.
The reported deal to fund the federal government through February 15th is welcome news to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or working without pay, and the millions of Americans who have been harmed by this reckless shutdown.
Yesterday was our intern Ashleigh's last day working with us. Thank you so much for your hard work Ashleigh, and best of luck in your new adventure! https://t.co/qRdPHIbUNk

Very proud to have voted last Thursday to reauthorize the Office of Congressional Ethics. The OCE does the important job of ensuring that all elected representatives are held to the ethical standards that voters deserve.
I proudly voted Thursday to prohibit discrimination in the House of Representatives on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. People must not be judged by their gender or who they love, but by the content of their character.
