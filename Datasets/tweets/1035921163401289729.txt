Trivia: Name one top thing that married women will do to get their husbands to do almost anything.
Does anyone knows why we usually do not challenge running VPs or Presidents?  They are supposed to be party leaders. Challenges will cause disunity. Democrats jumped into the race letting Biden know he is not welcome. Trump announced to shut up any challenge.
No bias in my opinion here. If Paul Manafort is sentenced now, the President is within the right to pardon him.  The delay has been calculated. If pardoned Stone will behave like Manafort. Mueller is being calculative.
Al Sharpton endorsement means nothing to the Black votes. Trump is going after the black votes guys.
If Democrats take for granted, the black vote might go heavily for Trump. Blacks on TV do not represent blacks. Whites and Blacks are closely alike. Candidates must do differently if they want to have the presidency. Just an advice.
Think about your life. Do you want to be the old Kid in Elementary school? This is how Joe will feel in the flood of young candidates running. He needs to pick something to do. He is better to be remembered as  VP than a spoiler or loser. I will not run against Trump.
I like Joe Biden. He better not run. Trump is not as easy as people think. He is a hard runner. He is a marketing giant. He has a solid fan that appears to be expanding. Joe Biden became VP not because he did well in the primaries. I hope he supports other candidates.
@thistallawkgirl You are right.
I wanted to turn the world the way I wanted when I was young. As I grew up, I learned to get out of its way. Why I am still alive and breathing.
One of my famous books is, The Thirty nine Steps. In it, The Black Stone follows Richard Hanny. The Black Stonehas no name. Invisible. It was a made up name for the bad guys by Richard. Mystery Man! My life is a mystery, not Black or a bad guy.
The big dig in Boston had cost overrun. It is	 the tunnel system in the USA today. Go tell Sen Kennedy that this was not a great project. The wall has cost overrun. I think it is a dumb project not because of the cost but what the wall can do. https://t.co/XPS43lXquX

What I say should not offend anyone. When we resist, it is literally defense. It is like we have no alternative but to apply civil disobedience. I want to go on the offense. It is how my life has been structured. There are always alternatives.
Years ago, projects depended on my ability to lead. I felt I could do anything that any man on earth could do. For 20 years I proved my worth to be alive. The very work, the very sleepless hours that I put into work saving lives took inches of me until I could no longer work.
Listening to newsmakers these days is stressful about the direction of everything. Everybody wants to be somebody else or doing something else. Those with power abuse it. It is like crabs pulling other crabs into the mud.
What are we doing to prisoners before release?  We make sure they end back in prison. Private Prisons are  a for profit, costing us twice than public prisons. Government wants these private prisons to be 100% full or else. They work on how to keep prisoners there for long.
Prison reforms have been a joke. When folks are locked up in solitary confinement and released into the public soon after. They are unable to cope with our world. Some commit suicide. Some mass murder. If we do not change this, we are trumping ourselves.
I believe that I am somebody. That what I do or say has meaning about the existence of our survival. My one voice might be weak and nimble now. If I continue, someone will hear me and pick up. My tweet might not be perfect. It can be a seat for other ideas.
As a project manager, I found that teamwork sometimes produces okay results. I have a peace of mind when everyone takes accountability than a perfect job of one man. It is what we leaders are trained to assess from time to time. We need effective leadership.

It is sad that the #trumpshutdown has become a 20/20 Presidential campaign issue for President Trump. Dems must manage this issue well. Appear to negotiate while framing stands well. Delicately Frame the wall as racist tendencies by Trump. Provide clear alternatives.

Mueller might have a lot of time in his hands, we don‚Äôt. Mueller, please Hand over what you have to the house. Now, OR I support leaking if there is a delay by even one more day.
Combining legalism and journalism sometimes helps ordinary folks. The special counsel can define the inaccuracies or shut up. So Mueller is held by the balls to release his findings or this is the beginning of the next phase, leaking. We cannot wait while Trump bleeds our country
‚Äú We stand by the story,‚Äù Buzzfeed.
Saying federal investigators is in dispute between Buzzfeed and the Special counsel. Sourcing disagreements not the facts.
The special counsel is simply noting that they do not leak. They should push back to avoid Trump from using the argument of ganging on him. . Or declaring him guilty before trial.

We have seen how Trump feels about impeachment. He suggested to be impeached for the shutdown, something that is not impeachable.  Mueller‚Äôs report will clear or implicate him. We must stay focused and compartmentized.
Trump calculated wrongly. He picked the wall too early for the 20/20 elections forgetting that, a house with these many members will hold on. House members truely rerepresent, weighted average. Senators are not. Ca has two. Wyoming has two.

Do you prefer indictment over impeachment of Trump and why? I prefer indictment and trial while Trump is in office.
We must know that Trump is dragging the shutdown to drown Mueller news of investigations. As long as Russia is off the headlines, shutdown continues.
This very Congress has the decision of impeaching Trump. The Congress looks like America and reflects America. The hate and the racism and supremacy tendencies of Trump are gradually disconstructing Trump and his old ways.
Observation: Trump helped elect the most women in Congress. Trump helped elect the most blacks yet in Congress. Trump has flipped the Congress to Democrats almost permanently. Republicans are undoing their seats.

This year, I will focus on healthcare, government, NPO, Leadership, Sociology, Policy, Statistics and immigration based on application and theories. I have a doctorate in law and policy from a major USA university. From time to time I will frame my tweets around these issues.
We do not expect Medical Doctors to do it all. E-Clinicalworks provides tools to remain competitive without asking your neighbor if you can borrow some salt. We are there for the big guys‚Äö major facilities and small guys‚Äö small practices and one man practice. Follow me for more.
Researchers have published many papers on Mental Health, but the definition of mental disease is illusive to some Americans who are directly impacted. Also, the definition can be misconstrued by some policymakers who refuse to adequately fund Mental Health.
How do I consider Mental Health? And how do I contemplate Mental Health? Should I construct my own, pithy, vague pronouncement? I could assert that Mental Health is a tangle of paradoxes.
The 1986 IRCA Federal immigration legislation through EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act) compelled hospitals to provide emergency care to all patients. I hope we obey the law.
All you have to do is tell a lie many times and many people would begin to believe it. But the bigger picture shows illegal immigrants‚Äô pull factors to be jobs, education and reuniting with families.
Policymakers are constantly debating strategies to restrict medical care to unauthorized immigrants, hoping to solve healthcare crises that are impacting low-income citizens. This is the wrong strategy.
During Trump‚Äôs Press conference, I noted that Trump‚Äôs situation is really bad than I thought reading his tweets. Live, I saw an irregular, rambling out of focus Trump. It made me sad, knowing he will not accept help. We took him seriously, but he is really sick.
Before us is Trump for us to stop the bleeding. I support impeachment and leaving him in place.  If the house draws articles of impeachment, senate tries. When it comes time to vote, republicans will want Mike Pence. All democrats will vote present. Bruise Trump for 20/20.
The person we need in 20/20 is someone articulate, logical, great at delivery, understands framing and young. He or she will beat Trump like a drum. We need an American support, not just democrats but republicans as well.
Donald Trump is a Republican no matter how we look at him. He brings out the hidden things about republicans, which some republicans did not know. Tax cuts, the wall, etc. Trump is simply separating right wings from moderates.
Border Security is what we want. The wall is your joint with Mexico. https://t.co/c9iFrNLiqc
Frankly, I have always counted on a balanced government because it acts as checks and balances. I am excited for tomorrow ends a one party Govrn. headed by Trump. House impeaches and Senate tries. If Trump continues with the shutdown, we may impeach him as act #1.
Yes, Trump is breaking his campaign pledge of having Mexico to pay for the wall by forcing us to pay for it. A few stupid journalists are saying Trump is complying with his promise. Some people are delusional too.
True! I studied immigration policy. Most of the undocumented immigrants in the USA are visa over stay. Very few come through Mexico. An immigration law will solve the problem and not building Trump‚Äôs wall.

The law works well when all parts of the policy are implemented. As any other policy, it needs fine tuning. This has not taken place yet. Trump cannot eliminate it. It is closer to single pay. If the public option is added, it will cover all Americans.
The system froze on golive when a certain number of users logged on at the same time. This was fixed.
My hospital was actively involved. I cannot name it. An error was made where limited users tested concurrently as this portion was given to an IT company that was not versed with proper testing.
When Obama was elected, he decided to implement the healthcare policy nationwide. He tried to add a public option but encountered resistance.
Under George Bush we got the Federal Government to subsidize the program as an R&amp;D to be implemented throughout the United States. The program was fine tuned, adding IT innovations.
The Massachusetts House and Senate adopted a research from the Heritage Foundation. I was working for a Harvard Teaching Hospital then..
Massachusetts under Governor Michael Dukakis started a program of setting money aside to provide healthcare to all legal residents of Massachusetts.
The ACA aka Obamacare was enacted into law under Obama but R&amp;D took place here in Massachusetts under Governor Mitt Romney and first started by Governor Micheal Dukakis. The idea is from Heritage Foundation.

Cult leadership is a way of having followers believe blindly in the ‚Äúsuper being leader‚Äù. It is bad because the dangerous leadership has a tendency to deconstruct our values and norms.
Leadership means getting buyin followers. If Trump cannot get half the country to buy into the wall, it is definitely a bad idea. Leaders do not coarse or corrupt. They do not punish opponents. They ditch the idea.

Attorneys are jumping to ask why Michael did not sign a full cooperation agreement. My hypotheses is that, Cohen knows very well he cannot survive for long without some supporters of Trump wagging him. He is safer in jail while we figure what to do with Trump.
Please my reflection should not frighten anyone for history proves that this country is bigger than any one man or woman. We hold hope!
Cohen‚Äôs sentence is a matter of law and policy. His testimony frightens me as there are a lot of people out there who support our President blindly. Are they little Trumps too? If true, then we are in deep sh*t. We must pray. Pray hard for our destiny is uncertain.

Disclaimer: I am not a medical doctor. My friend who are neurologists and psychiatrists observed something wrong with President Trump. They needed time with him and diagnostic tests to support or denial their observations. Trump might not know that he is a pathological liar.
Cohen: The mental state of Trump is very problematic for this country. He, Cohen never believed Trump will be elected President, he recollected. From history working for a Trump he cautioned this country.
Breaking News: Michael Cohen: ‚ÄúPresident Trump as President is a danger to the Country and to his family‚Äù
Trump actually said these words: "I'm proud to shut down the government."	Translation: he's "proud" to defund services, and put federal employees at risk right before the holidays, unless he gets $5 billion to waste on a border wall.
When these hospitals merged, they preserved their autonomy and collaborated whenever possible. Other competing hospitals went with take over. Most struggled and closed. Layoffs occurred. This is the same problem in Europe, but in a large scale.

Michael Cohen pleaded guilty avoiding a trial. Trump cannot look at the sentencing guidelines to declare his innonsence. He is named in the sentencing guidelines directly and indirectly.
Michael Cohen has a chance to reduce his sentence. As I  observed before he has a lot to trade for reduced or no jail sentence. Others suggested his holding back might be to get a parden from Trump. But crimes charged in NY are not subject to a parden.

Trump would like to make everything about this country about him. America is bigger than one person. We should fix it not for him, not because of him but for ourselves, our children and the next generation.

FBI was given a case. Instructions were limit the scope. Limited scope is relative. FBI will bring back what they find. FBI will try to be timely but if it takes longer, the majority leader cannot table a vote without the results. The truth is, Kavanaugh is toast. Withdraw pal.
His year book shows threesome triangle. It means he and his pal know a lot. Kavanaugh did not want the fbi probe in this line. The scope is narrow. And lastly, fbi is not a robot.  If they need more time, they will ask for more time.
Sometimes political pundits are either intellectually dishonest or really do not know what they are talking about. Some say time is too short so fbi will not reveal anything. I disagree. We have established that Kavanaugh likes beer a lot. It means he was frequently drunk.
If any of my followers is looking for me to use white and black, I will not because there are good men and women on both sides. When someone is bad, he or she is bad. It matters not the color of his or her skin. My studies point to this fact.

An FBI check takes time if we do not have a specific frame. In Kavanaugh, we have witnesses already. And the scope is to test the validity of facts. Kavanaugh should withdraw now to save his name and career.
Nope, you guess. You want to compare his/her views with yours. https://t.co/JVLPYtV3Fw
Reports.  FBI started investigations this evening. They will hit all the witnesses by tomorrow. Kavanaugh, please withdraw. This is my friendly suggestion to you.
I think the report will not be favorable to Trump and Kavanaugh.
Let me reconstruct this: Trump does not believe in the fbi. Kavanaugh was hired by Trump to help him while on the bench. Trump is against Russian investigations. Fbi will produce a report to denied a Kavanaugh the seat. You all see the drift?
Kavanaugh is in deep shit. Anyone in his right mind would withdraw by now.  This delay is structured to impede voting for him. It gives a way out for republicans. A real judge would foresee this. No bias here. Just an opinion.

This is a way for Kavanaugh to withdraw. There is not enough votes to confirm him.
This is my take, Jeff doesn‚Äôt want to vote for Kavanaugh but will like support from other members. He knows where some of his few colleagues are. This gives a way for Kavanaugh to withdraw.  Trump believes Ford. It means Kavanuagh lied.

Make no mistake that confirming Kavanaugh creates a new paradigm shift. It might not be easy to deconstruct this bad culture again. Any Senator who votes for him endorses sexual assault. Bill Cosby can use his case to get out of jail. We do not want this to happen. Heee, do we?
I reflected as I watched both Ford and Kavanaugh, as one respected Senators and the other bullied at them. Is this how Trump has transformed our culture by bragging how smart he is? And asking all to bow before hiim?
If the vote for Kavanaugh is rushed without properly investigating these issues, he should be impeached when on the usjc. Somehow rule of law must hold or we will see a deconstruction of our institutions.

Kavanaugh talks about how good he is. This is disturbing. I am objective here. Kavanaugh was deceived by Trump and conservatives. Now his career is gone.
From what I have heard, I believe Ford and not Kavsnaugh. This guy is in love with beer. This rambling about beer is disturbing.
We drank beer. I drank beer. I like beer. I have gone to sleep and not passed out. Not that I can recall is the right answer.
Republicans again are making a big mistake by using a consultant.
This is what Trump wants. Kavanaugh has decided to protect Trump, this is his downfall.
Well, you should have seen this coming and to withdraw. For the sake of your family you must withdraw.
Kavanaugh was coached to show emotions. He is crying to get a job. Christine has nothing to gain. This is the paradox.
My first question too Kavanaugh  after this rambling is, did you watch Ford‚Äôs testimony?  Do you believe her?
Did Kavanaugh drink? He could have said that, ‚ÄúI will not asssult anyone‚Äù but partying and drinking and even getting drunk can be traumatic. By saying he was out of town or it was someone else are not enough.
Who is Kavanaugh lecturing? I did not want to say this, as someone with the highest degree in law and policy, my suggestion is for Kavanaugh to withdraw immediately.
This is not about Kavanaugh. It is about our country. If Bill Cosby can go to jail for crimes decades away do should Kavanaugh. He should be advised to withdraw.
Talking down pn Senators is not the right approach. Withdraw to preserve whatever dignity you have. When one says a public office job, it is not working for nothing. Kavanaugh was paid.
