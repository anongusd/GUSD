@JoanneFaulkne17 @frodolovebot @StefanMolyneux Planned Parenthood was developed by eugenicists, I doubt you'll care about that.
@SuperLubo101 The answer isn't fully yes or no.
@SuperLubo101 The last sentence clearly states my position.
@SuperLubo101 If I didn't know that the sky was blue and I told you it wasn't, I would be lying, but I wouldn't know it. That's an honest lie.
@SuperLubo101 You can be unaware of your intentions, and your subconscious could play a part in that. So it's both, though usually no.
@SuperLubo101 Where did I say intent was subconscious?
@SuperLubo101 This proves you lied, thanks
@SuperLubo101 An honest lie is lying without knowing that you are lying, it's simple.
@SuperLubo101 I said someone may not be aware of the true reasons for their actions, it's Psych 101. You said that's false, so I brought up that the subconscious can make us do things without being aware of the reasons.
@SuperLubo101 Do you need the dictionary for everything? Think things out on your own.
@SuperLubo101 again with the strawman, that's not what I said.
@SuperLubo101 You have google
@SuperLubo101 I brought up appearances, I didnt say you did.
@SuperLubo101 Now that is a strawman
@SuperLubo101 Well you didn't retain any of it.
@SuperLubo101 It would be an honest lie if you were unaware
@SuperLubo101 Well you should crack the textbook, you didn't didn't learn much. The subconscious can make you do things and you wouldn't be aware of the reasons.
@SuperLubo101 Learn basic psychology. People are commonly unaware of the real reasons they do things.
@SuperLubo101 If you are unaware of an intent it is still there.
@SuperLubo101 What argument am I saying you made that you didn't make?
@SuperLubo101 Yes people can be unaware of intent
@SuperLubo101 No, you lied about not knowing what appearances were, I said maybe you didn't intend to lie. It's not a strawman, you should look that up so you don't use it wrong again.
@SuperLubo101 This was all to save you face btw, you're basically arguing that you're a bald faced liar.
@SuperLubo101 Yeah, I'm not arguing that the intent isn't there. I'm saying at the time they do it they may not be aware of that intent or didn't think it through before they did it.
@SuperLubo101 Yeah, and I argued that if a person didn't knowingly intend to lie, it's still a lie. Hence the hypothetical.
@SuperLubo101 I went on appearances, and when you said you knew I took your word for it and told you how it appeared. You then proceeded to cry for about an hour because I made fun of you.
@SuperLubo101 The hypothetical was to show that intent isn't what determines if something was a lie.
@SuperLubo101 yes there is, I straight out told you what it was.
@SuperLubo101 I wasn't referring specifically to that statement. I think in that case you were too vague.
@SuperLubo101 You still don't get it? wow.
@SuperLubo101 You really are just stupid aren't you. Ad Hominem can never make your argument correct.
@SuperLubo101 Of course you can. If a person says they don't know something and then says they do know it, it is clear they lied. I gave you the benefit of the doubt by saying honest mistake, but I'm now seeing that you're arguing in bad faith.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Yes I do, it's my hypothetical situation, and I phrased it in a way that only required yes or no. You just know I'm right and want to derail.
@SuperLubo101 lol uh no it doesn't in any case genius
@SuperLubo101 Saying Im trolling doesn't make me wrong.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux It's not an opinion, it's a fact. The question only required a yes or no answer, anything else is irrelevant.
@SuperLubo101 I'm very good at people reading, you just don't like that I'm pointing out your flaws.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Well it derails the conversation. I asked you a simple yes or no question and you go into details that are irrelevant to our hypothetical situation.
@SuperLubo101 Take your own advice. The fact that you know they can be both yet you act like they can't be used together shows you're dishonest yet again. If you are feeling fear, it can make you panic. You would say the fear made you fear.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux You can in hypothetical situations. Why do you try to argue the small details and ignore the big picture? I think it's avoidance.
@SuperLubo101 Panicking is an action, fear is an emotion. Panicking can be caused by fear. You're really trying too hard to sound smart here.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux It's not about proving it. Like I said, it is a fact she cheated, she said she didn't because she panicked. If your argument that intent is what determines whether something was a lie or not was true, she would not be lying to you.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux No shit sherlock
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux But she panicked and it just came out due to fear.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux In this situation it is a fact she cheated and she said she didn't. Whether you believe her or not is irrelevant.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux But she didn't intend to lie, so it's not a lie. Right?
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Quit with the bullshit and give me a straight answer. If she did cheat, when asked about it she panicked and said she didn't, is it a lie?
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux It doesn't matter. You acted like you didn't know something when you did. How is this so hard for you
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux She was scared and panicked when she said she didn't cheat, is it a lie?
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Courts have to have a higher bar for charging people with perjury, this isn't a court of law. Now you're just trying rationalize your lying.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux So if your girlfriend cheated on you and said she didn't because she was scared and panicked, it's not a lie?
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Well you did twice in this thread. Now you know you lie unintentionally.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Yeah sure welcome to the internet, but the deeper lesson here is to not lie to people by acting ignorant. You can take it or leave it idc
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux I am fucking with you, but I'm being honest about it.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux So you do understand what appearances are. But you lied again and acted like you didn't. That's why I said to say what you mean, because now you look underhanded again.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux You sure don't like to appear ignorant do you
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux So you don't understand what appearances are, got it. Or do you and you're acting like you don't again?
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Do you not understand what appearances are? Your thought process has no bearing. 		I know low IQ people by their actions, I don't need to know the number, it's obvious.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux I named myself this because it's funny, but low IQ people seem to think calling me an asshole is somehow clever. Anyway, asking what he means does make you look ignorant, and when you ask that when you do know what he means, you then look underhanded.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux You realize I named myself this right?... My first comment was because you made yourself look ignorant, then when you said you knew what he was saying, I helped you to not look ignorant.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux Are you retarded? I told you how you can come across to people in a better way, that's constructive.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux I'm constantly amazed how people think that's clever. Anyway, I was giving you constructive criticism, don't be such a bitch.
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux So say that, asking what he means makes you look ignorant or like you're slow rolling him
@SuperLubo101 @StefanMolyneux whoa don't use big words @StefanMolyneux , you're confusing the boy
@6raabir_Boubi Who hurt you?
@USUprising But white genocide is a conspiracy theory right?
@lp4236 @StefanMolyneux @QuintusCurtius Strength of will my ass. You can't will a Geo Metro to perform like a Ferrari, and it's the same for humans.
@FracksSake @bad_tits @imwithdick @Andywarski Baked is already dead
@kyleruggles Loser
@kyleruggles Do you even realize how lame you are? Maybe if you engaged with your opposition instead of putting them on your little lists to get them silenced you would learn to talk like a man.
@kyleruggles No, I just can't believe someone actually thought that would be clever. Pathetic form, Ruggles, get better.
@kyleruggles Are you really just asking who, what, where, when, why questions now?
@kyleruggles Who what?
@kyleruggles I'd say around 9 months before you were born
@kyleruggles Because your dad got her hooked on it so he could put her on the street
@kyleruggles Because your mom smoked crack
@kyleruggles Because you're so dumb you can't Google "crack" or "crack baby"
@kyleruggles @BBCWorld Exactly
@kyleruggles @BBCWorld It's what your mom smoked when she was pregnant with you apparently
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld ok.... lol are you on crack?
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld Yeah women love wimps man, you must be beating them off with a stick. That "saying" part makes no sense, why do I think "speaking can be heard when responding to text?"
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld There you go again, I'm hurting so bad! I bet you'll get lots of sex playing that one up.
@kyleruggles Yeah check my replies, speaking perfect english and making coherent arguments. Idiot.
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld I agree I am funny, but nothing makes me laugh more than your soy infused profile picture. It says to the ladies, "I'm tormented by how damaged I am." But usually when guys go for that look they don't mean brain damaged.
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld Oh sorry, I forgot reading is hard for people like you. Hey, since you're into conspiracies, you should go hunt some reptilians! I hear they're taking over the world.
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld That's the only comeback you have? Soft. Your intelligence level is showing, so it's not surprising that you don't understand discourse and choose to silence people instead of attempting to defend your flimsy positions. You'd only make yourself look bad.
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld So you go around looking for people who disagree with you to silence? How weak your beliefs must be.
@kyleruggles @mariyah_12 @BBCWorld I'm american and everyone who disagrees with you isn't a troll, grow up
@thehill Democrats want open borders now wtf you talking about?
@JBinAV Nice deceptively edited video you have there Prince Valiant
@6raabir_Boubi I'm starting to think they have da hivemind worldwide https://t.co/e3I8PkS2py
@corbieres99 @Reuters So where are they?
@Reuters Invite them to live in the Vatican with you
@sylvainpitre @pigfeet8 @6raabir_Boubi @CNN @realDonaldTrump Im super concerned about facts	I read Huffington Post	Pick one
@stillgray @6raabir_Boubi What do you know about being conservative? You're upholding feminist standards of male behavior, and in a conservative culture this would be expected from him if his wife attacked him.
@ACLU Why did we buy Israel a wall if it isn't the solution?
@MTJanene @NBCNews So you're fine with black kids being killed as long as the shooter isn't white?
@stetayen @nytimes The question is, why didn't she come forward when it happened?
@nytimes oh wow just in time to keep him from running, how convenient.
@NBCNews It's sad, but you have to wonder why it only makes news when the shooter is white.
@mariyah_12 @BBCWorld Very creative
@BBCWorld As they attempt to break in to our country... if they wanted refuge they would've taken it when Mexico offered it.
