@realDonaldTrump Baloney. Have you heard of tunneling?  Have you heard of rock climbing? Have you heard of bombs? Do you really think you can stop immigrants? We didn't elect Putin or Turkey's president. THEY want to take over our country and are far more likely to than Mexico. You R sucking up.

@realDonaldTrump Because of Obama's very hard work in pulling this country out of the recession Bush created and stuck him with, before you even thought of running. People fact check the numbers and you lie about them. No other American President has ever been laughed AT by the U.N, as will God.
@realDonaldTrump You and the Repugs just debased justice, debased the Senate, debased the entire political process. But thanks. You just fired up women even more. Like your new pet, SCOTUS said. "What goes around, comes around." A homily goes, "One monkey don't stop no show." The show begins.

@CBSNews Of course, Trump has to politicize this to make himself appear nobler. What a crock.  Abusive men like Trump are the reason women don't want to come forward. Trump should have been jailed after HIS first assault and now there are how many more? Now, emotional abuse. Again.
@CBSNews The men of this country need to remember: it could be YOUR wife, YOUR daughter, YOUR sister, your mother. This shouldn't be "politics as usual." Be an advocate for change.

@LACaldwellDC @OrrinHatch HOW ON EARTH DOES HE KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE PARTY IF HE WASN'T THERE? Senator Hatch, your bias is showing. Mr. Kavanaugh, your LIE is showing. There was NO PLOT TO WITHHOLD. She was afraid to come forward because of biased and ignorant remarks like these: they're just a start!
@AshHinchy I don't blame you for being upset. The camera knew instantly where to pan, and everyone around there was watching HIM, not the team. No wonder everyone around them has a smile on their faces. They should make him the team mascot. It's wonderful!

@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC No, Mr. Lindsey. You took a vow to protect your country and serve your constituents, not to aid and abet Donald Trumputin.  Before you start knocking President Obama, you'd better start look at a few more poll numbers, starting with 538.  Eighty per cent of the country disagrees.

@JohnBrennan I'm proud of you Sir.  Many millions of us are proud of you. The people who don't speak up in your defense have no courage of their convictions. We consider the source of this presidential stupidity, believe me. History will come down on your side.
@JohnBrennan I yelled at my TV when Trumputin was campaigning and flapped his yap on screen, the same thing Meaghan McCain said, "America has always been great." Those who don't believe that are the traitors.
@JohnBrennan I totally agree.  Trumputin and gang paid no attention to why he really took a knee, they just wanted a misdirecting controversar du jour.  I've read many comments from veterans who say that peaceful protest and free speech is what they fought for.

@realDonaldTrump YOU are the reason lives have been ruined....they put their faith in YOU.  McConnell,  Nunes, and the rest of the Republigang will soon find out you will turn on them too, to try to save your own hide. You don't have a loyal bone in your entire body.
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm Hillary is the most is the most investigated woman in political history, and yet...NO charges...NO indictments...and the mere thought of Hillary Clinton being president makes Putin want to pee his pants...I wonder why? Instead he picked a stooge to support...ever wonder why?
@realDonaldTrump Hardly disgraced or discredited with all the guilty pleas, indictments, and convictions...just HOW is he discredited?

@realDonaldTrump The man worked his tail off for you, and you talk about him that way?  Shame on you. No morals at all. You demand loyalty but give none.  Who died and appointed you God? When you see God He'll say, "Lucy, you've got some 'splaining to do.

@JulesGuitar @CNN @JasonS423 I think you are a researcher, not a parent.
@JulesGuitar @CNN @JasonS423 Have you dealt personally with the effects of school shootings? There was one shooting in between Thurston and Columbine...no media. The media swarmed here, inspired a year‚Äôs planning by Columbine shooters, and disrespects the Thurston families by denial they created it.
@JulesGuitar @CNN @JasonS423 Keep arguing just to be right. The Kip Kinkel shooting was the first major media shooting. The media put those families through hell. A friend worked at the hospital and saw all the wounded kids. What good was ‚Äòthe people‚Äôs right to know‚Äô?
@JulesGuitar @CNN @JasonS423 Kip Kinkel wasn‚Äôt the first, but the first with huge media attention. I‚Äôve been watching the local coverage for a week.The Columbine shooters took a year to plan. May 1998-April 1999. One shooter in between, no major media. Media disrespects what they put families through.
@JulesGuitar @CNN @JasonS423 Well, I live here, and as former protective services for the 2nd largest newspaper in Oregon, I had to deal with all the national media. May 21, 1998 two dead, 22 wounded...plus his parents. The media attention inspired Columbine.
