RT @petridishes: “what’s the truth that he fears most” sounds like something a gateway Sphinx asks you on your way to Thebes
@adambonin I mean, that would sorta be the default (and not particularly surprising). But, if so, I’d expect about a dozen opinions concurring in part or concurring in judgment or concurring in part and dissenting in part or dissenting. 😑
Honestly hard to know where the court is going to end up here, as honestly pretty much all of the justices — Thomas didn’t speak, as is his usual practice — asked tough questions about both the specific facts of this case and the underlying doctrine (which is a mess).
* = Appears that Wall, the principal deputy SG, is acting SG for this case because SG Noel Francisco’s former firm is Jones Day.
The set-up was a tough one for Monica Miller, the humanists’ lawyer arguing against the cross — though she did well. Three lawyers argued against her: Neal Katyal, former acting SG under Obama; Mike Carvin, conservative SCOTUS litigator from Jones Day; and Jeff Wall, acting SG*.
Just out of court in the cross case: #SCOTUS is divided, and struggling, and all of those words — with the case itself, its consequences, and (particularly for the two newest justices) with the future of the Lemon test.
The decision is 7-1, with Breyer dissenting. Kavanaugh did not participate. https://t.co/zAlDkxlNdH
The final #SCOTUS decision today is in Jam v. International Finance Corp., with Chief Justice Roberts writing that the International Orgs Immunities Act provides the same immunities as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
Here's the decision in Garza, a second defendant win in a row (and a second decision in which Roberts joined the more liberal justices): https://t.co/5ACPyPMTfp
The second decision is in Garza v. Idaho, with the decision by Sotomayor reversing the Idaho Supreme Court. The decision is 6-3, with Thomas writing, joined by Alito and Gorsuch. #SCOTUS
Chief Justice John Roberts joined the more liberal justices in vacating the Alabama court decision below. Opinion by Kagan. Kavanaugh did not participate. Here is the decision: https://t.co/tJkBZUnvrJ #SCOTUS
In a 5-3 decision in Madison v. Alabama, the Supreme Court says that a person cannot be executed if he or she is suffering from any mental disorder and cannot rationally understand why the court wants to execute him or her.
It’s a two-box day, meaning three or four decisions are coming at 10a, before the cross case arguments.
(This just happened in the basement of the Supreme Court.)
“Do not take down the cross,” a man who has been detained yelled. He added to tell the justices: “Unless they repent, they will burn in hell” for allowing abortions. https://t.co/sjLPuNMVCr

@Sam_Rubinstein Mine: “Running: It might reduce your therapy bills, but, more importantly, it will help you be able to focus on what actually matters when you are at therapy.” 😂
[For new followers, I’m sober and I talk about it — and mental health — at times because it’s important for me to be honest about addiction and mental health, but also to reduce stigma and, even though I am constantly imperfect, also so I can be a resource for those who need it.]
The great thing about being an addict who knows they’re an addict is that you can find healthy things like running that, if you go overboard at times (as I always will), it really just means you went running for 75 minutes unexpectedly, nothing more!

Justice Thurgood Marshall also wrote in dissent at the time: “The Court today places its imprimatur on one of the most potent remaining public expressions of ‘ancient canards about the proper role of women.’”
White, J., dissenting: “[A]dministrative convenience has not been sufficient justification for the kind of outright gender-based discrimination involved in registering and conscripting men, but no women at all.”

@JWMoons I'm not even sure what that means — since the whole point would be that anyone can access the full, unedited video. That would be better than now, when you're literally relying on reports from the people in the room.
@RealFacelessMan I mean, I'm not taking that point — but, even if true, that would be public accountability for public officials, so ... good?
@cordenthusiast The point is that the largest circuit has been doing it for nearly a decade, and lawyers and judges and journalists and the public see no problems — and many see many benefits.

You can, however, now listen to the opinion announcement audio at least here, FYI: https://t.co/ew9XfECpHd
No, it’s not likely to happen any time soon. This past summer, a bunch of us Supreme Court journalists asked the court to release the ~audio~ of the opinion announcement in the travel ban case earlier than it normally would be released (that fall). The court denied our request.
The Supreme Court would do a great service to itself, to journalism, and to the American people to allow the public to see the arguments more easily. The 9th Circuit has had live-streamed arguments for years, with no problems. The upsides are plenty, and downsides are few.
Two views of the First Amendment: https://t.co/ToKwcuY2FF
The looks and chuckles won’t be reflected in the transcript and almost certainly won’t be able to be heard at all — let alone be able to be known from whom they came — on the audio. Nothing comes close to seeing arguments in person to understand what’s actually happening.
For those keeping watch from home: 	-Justice Ginsburg asked multiple questions in today’s “what happens to a trademark license in bankruptcy” case. 	-Justice Breyer talked about air-conditioned igloos, promoting Justices Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh to look at one another and chuckle.
Going upstairs for arguments. Back later.
Gorsuch says "there can be no serious doubt" that the Excessive Fines Clause should be applied to the states, but he says the vehicle to do so "may well be" the "privileges and immunities" clause, rather than the "due process" clause.
The majority in Timbs held that the due process guarantees of the 14th Amendment compelled the incorporation of the Excessive Fines Clause. 		Thomas says the "privileges and immunities" clause of the 14th Amendment should be used to apply the provision to the states.
In Timbs — a major question before the justices — Gorsuch filed a concurring opinion and Thomas concurred in judgment only. 		Ginsburg just finished reading from her opinion.
Here is the decision in Dawson: https://t.co/sN201C1NkU		Here is the decision in Timbs: https://t.co/xqi8FP1pGH
The second decision is in Timbs v. Indiana. The decision is by Ginsburg, who is reading her decision from the bench. The court ruled that the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated — meaning applied against the states. No justices dissented.
The first decision is in Dawson v. Steager, and it is a unanimous decision by Gorsuch reversing the lower court. #SCOTUS

@ira I'm OK with that?
Q: "Did you ask Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to change the leadership of the investigation into your former personal attorney Michael Cohen?" 	Trump: "No, not at all. I don't know who gave you that. More fake news. There is a lot of fake news out there. No, I didn't."
So, while the DOJ statement simply hewed to Whitaker's limited language about "promises or commitments," Trump gives an outright denial of this NYT claim: https://t.co/BLKozm7YPo
Asked whether he asked Whitaker about the US attorney's recusal in Cohen's case in the Southern District of New York, Trump, per pool, said, "No, I don’t know who gave you that."

@hwkbgr I don’t think showing empathy is the same as expressing opinion.
At the end of the day, I’m sad. I’m sad for Smollett, I’m sad for the Chicago community, I’m sad for everyone who’s been wrapped up in this from all views, but I’m mostly sad — and spoke out today — b/c there are queer people of color dying due to hate, and those deaths are real.
Since then, there have been issues w/ the coverage, as I said earlier this afternoon. Reporters need to be careful. That fear and empathy can inform our knowledge and make us better reporters, but the reporting needs to be careful — especially if facts blur and stories change.
Today, I saw this idea that people in the media were “rooting for” an outcome and it disgusted me. I was “rooting for” anything OTHER THAN that a person was attacked because they were black or gay. But, I know it happens, and, as I’m gay, I had a moment of fear.
That first day, I tweeted the police statement and nothing else BECAUSE I know there is lots of misinformation in these situations. I was responsible. I also was a human, showing empathy, and saying that what I had just read was awful.
Yes, it would be awful if Smollett concocted this, and that should be addressed appropriately. But beyond posting the initial police report that first morning, I stayed quiet until today because I am not there. I do not know enough for me to feel comfortable saying what happened.
If your definition of owning me is that I showed empathy the morning of the news of Jussie Smollett’s reported attack, in a tweet that noted twice that we didn’t know everything — “It appears” and “alleged” — then go have at it.
@Corr2II2 One can show empathy as a human, as I did, and be a reporter by literally making it clear two times that we still did not have all the information: “It appears” and “alleged.” So, I really don’t know what you’re talking about.
@platewithears Maybe not, but the discussion is. And there are many people who think what he’s thinking even if they’re not tweeting it (and many others are, judging by my mentions).
Chuck is literally lecturing people for “rooting for” one outcome while declaring an alternative outcome as fact before the police have even had a follow-up interview with Smollett. I, on the other hand, stayed quiet while this is investigated until Chuck started lecturing. So. https://t.co/jmX0DTedGG
Off here for now. Back Tuesday for court. Have a good remainder of your weekend if you’re still off or a good Monday otherwise, all, and let us try to be good to one another — and ourselves.
@garod2204 No, I’m not a liar. I tweeted a police statement about the allegation, called it an allegation, and said “it appears.” Get a grip on reality.
This proves my point and is just sad. Chuck thinks that me sending out the initial police statement, noting it is an allegation, and saying “it appears” somehow proves his point because my reaction to reading that was that it was awful. I really don’t know how to deal with that. https://t.co/0O90TrhlaK
@JayKlos @Kno @bellvedere @ChuckRossDC No, it doesn’t. The only thing I shared was the initial police statement, not an article. I am waiting on what the police say. The latest I saw is that they are still trying to interview Smollett again. Am I wrong?
@bellvedere @carrynosticks @ChuckRossDC I didn’t report any allegations as fact. I literally said it was an allegation and that it appeared to be X. I re-posted the police statement — not an article — and said it was an awful situation. The idea that you and Chuck think that proves something is weird to me.
@ChrisHerc @ChuckRossDC Thanks!
Yes, I will “editorialize” that it’s “awful” when a police department puts out a statement regarding an allegation of a bias-motivated crime just like I “editorialize” that it’s “awful” when the police or family members tell me or other reporters that someone has died. https://t.co/WCOaSBr1YH
@ChuckRossDC People do get their news from more than just me, Chuck, as you’re aware, and this has been all over, so I am fairly certain those who wanted to follow every in and out are doing so.
@ChuckRossDC I tweeted that morning, when the report came out — and said “it appears.” I have since let the reporting work its way, and have not sent out anything about it because reports have been conflicting and unclear. When we have more, I certainly will do so.
@bellvedere @ChuckRossDC Is it not awful? 🤔
@ChuckRossDC Yes, Chuck. It appears. Reading comprehension is a great skill. And, note that you had to search back to that one tweet ... since that’s all I tweeted.
There are lots of issues with the Smollett coverage, but it’s not that people were “rooting for” an outcome. Rallying behind a person who claims to have been victimized can be difficult for journalists to do fairly (as we have seen), but it’s not “rooting for” an outcome.
This reveals much about Chuck’s thinking, and it’s troubling. He sees the coverage of whether a person was attacked in a bias-motivated crime as “rooting for” an “outcome,” as opposed to being a reaction of concern about the way biases play out and can turn into violence. https://t.co/xezYo7xC2S

Neither of these rulings is particularly surprising, to be clear. Just noting them!

@steve_vladeck Yes.
And, yes, none of this gets to the substance that some challenges likely would remain live even once Barr ~does~ become AG.
Seriously, though. Why would a judge do this? We talk about process and procedure 'til we're blue in the face with courts and then here's a judge dismissing a case as moot based on a Senate vote, before the executive implements that vote, on its own motion. Unnecessary, at best.
@RVA2MI Whitaker is still the acting AG at this point, so far as Cogan knows. It's totally irresponsible (and unnecessary) for the judicial branch to act after a vote of Congress before the executive has implemented the change or even requested the dismissal.

Stepping out again! Be back soon.
Asked about his comments that the Mueller investigation is "nearly complete," Whitaker says that was his position. 		Then says: "Bob Mueller is gonna finish his investigation when he wants to finish his investigation."
Rep. Swalwell asks whether FACT received foreign contributions while it was there.		Rep. Collins interrupts, says that's not the point of the hearing, and suggests if Swalwell would "stop running for President," then the hearing would go better.

Asked by Rep. Cedric Richmond if he would have a problem with a transgender person working for him, "from a clerk to an agent," within the DOJ law enforcement agencies, Whitaker responds clearly and simply: "No."
The arrest of Roger Stone was an attempt to scare people into not working for the Trump campaign in the future, Rep. McClintock says. He was continuing the CNN conspiracy theory thing.

tfw you're a very serious acting attorney general https://t.co/o778njOjRW
The committee has taken a break so members can go to the floor for votes.
Collins asks about Bruce Ohr — a DOJ employee who has gotten Trump's Twitter wrath. 		Whitaker says that Ohr still works for DOJ. 		Whitaker notes the ongoing IG's investigation and Huber's work, as well as that it's an HR matter, and won't comment further.
CNN also has reporters staking out Mueller's office and the federal court where the grand jury meets, so they're everywhere (and have the money and people to do so).
I would have been there if he was staying in DC.
Collins is questioning why CNN was at Roger Stone's house before his indictment, implying there was a leak. 		That's ridiculous. We ALL were waiting to see what was up, given the grand jury's having met on Thursday. I had a "Roger Stone indicted" pre-write.
Whitaker says: "I have not interfered with the special counsel's investigation."
UPDATE: THE GLASSES ARE REAL. https://t.co/pNtmvljvVD
Nadler asks a question, and Whitaker says that he sees that Nadler's time is up, so he won't answer. Everyone laughs at him.
Nadler asks for Whitaker to return to the committee for a deposition, at which time he expects a proper assertion of privilege" at that time.
Did I just imagine Whitaker put on a pair of glasses for a second? I looked again and they were gone. Am I having a stroke?
Whitaker says he has been briefed on the special counsel's investigation. B/c Sessions was recused from that investigation, Whitaker says he wasn't briefed as COS.		Nadler asks Whitaker for the number of briefings. Whitaker responds, asking for "the basis" for the questions.
Whitaker says that, as acting AG, he has made "no promises or commitments" to anyone at the White House "regarding the special counsel's investigation or any other investigation."
Whitaker, a little less than 30 minutes after the hearing began, starts his opening statement. https://t.co/kqZIoIRu15
Rep. Doug Collins' motion to adjourn, which followed his decrying "theatrics," failed 24-10.
Lol. Collins called for the roll call vote — but a bunch of the Republicans aren't even there to vote to adjourn.
Rep. Collins moves to adjourn the hearing, demands a roll call vote. [He doesn't have the votes.]		The clerk was not even here, because ... well .. that was not expected to be necessary.
He's yelling from the start, FYI.		"This is not the Senate."		I know, Rep. Collins. I know.		"Back to theatrics again," he said without irony. https://t.co/HqcF318naj
"This is nothing more than a character assassination," Rep. Doug Collins—the ranking Republican—says. Collins says that Nadler sent a letter to DOJ last night confirming, "There will be no subpoena tomorrow"—and asserts it was that move that led to Whitaker to agree to appear.
Nadler, on the subpoena threat, now that Whitaker is there: "I agree there is no need to resort to that measure. For now."
Nadler is giving his opening statement: From the start, he's questioning Whitaker's decision not to recuse himself from the special counsel's investigation. 		Here's my report on that December decision: https://t.co/PNaXVSZ69k

Some days, it’s hard to believe all of the news that happened actually happened in one day. ... This is one such day. 😑
Nonetheless, no one signed their name to it, and its not really the fulsome reasoning one expects before a court votes to allow an execution to proceed.
A fair caveat to this in the death penalty case is the unsigned order, which I guess technically has to have been agreed to by the 5 non-dissenting justices in order for it to be a majority of the court. It says Ray's having "waited until January 28" is the court's reason. https://t.co/IhPwTuDpSx
@cdingens What do you mean? I say exactly what I mean. They are notes.
In the death penalty case, the dissenting justices explained their opposition (through a dissent from Kagan, joined by the others). In the abortion provider case, only Kavanaugh wrote to explain his opposition to the stay and only for himself.
Important Note: The Supreme Court tonight allowed an execution to proceed in Alabama against the ruling of one appeals court and kept a Louisiana law from going into effect against the ruling of another one. In both cases, the 5-4 majority provided no reasoning for its decision.

@ReichlinMelnick I mean, two of the three have been confirmed, though!
@ssamcham @theglipper @RMFifthCircuit I’m not the one who issued a date certain stay! It was unusual for this court, so it would seem to me to be odd to relay on what’s going to happen (or not) below. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@smmarotta @ssamcham @theglipper @RMFifthCircuit I agree that these are what I expect.
@oaklandas12345 (See thread above) means “See thread above.” I literally answer that question in the thread.
@theglipper @RMFifthCircuit @ssamcham Not quite the direction you all have moved towards, but wouldn’t it at least be bad form to have issued the administrative stay — at least in part to prevent confusion within the lower courts and in the state — but then leave this flapping out there in the wind come midnight?

Top Democrats In The Early 2020 Primary States Haven't Heard Anything From Joe Biden https://t.co/ilfg6TH4zc by @henryjgomez
The 5th Circuit held arguments before SCOTUS granted cert in the 6th Circuit cases, but then they held the 5th Circuit cases once SCOTUS granted cert in the 6th Circuit ones. And post-Obergefell decision, just resolved them in light of that.
Big side-note here for me: I am so mad we never got to see the 5th Circuit marriage opinion. Higginbotham was the key, middle vote on the panel.
@Distopos She chose not to.
In sum, there was no disagreement about the case itself, which was resolved on the specifics of the claim and not on the law, but there was a bubbling disagreement under the surface — even among 3 Republican-appointed judges — about LGBT protections under existing federal law.
The third judge on the panel, Judge Jennifer Elrod, a George W. Bush appointee, did not write.
Judge Patrick Higginbotham, a Reagan appointee to the 5th Circuit, wrote separately to note — albeit without ~quite~ saying it — how ridiculous that is. https://t.co/YDxVQ3daOf
Ho, a Trump appointee to the 5th Circuit, has been on the appeals court bench for just over 13 months. In the majority opinion, which resolves the case on other grounds, Ho wrote about a 5th Circuit opinion from 1979, which he insists is still good precedent in the circuit. https://t.co/7Y3tbfpgko

The DC Circuit initially had ruled in December w/ just a judgment — upholding the dist ct contempt order. The company went to SCOTUS at that point, since the judgment resolved the issue, contained some reasoning, and was going to go into effect. The opinion followed in January.
The main purpose of the supplemental brief by the foreign country-owned company at #SCOTUS was to include information about the DC Circuit's opinion on the issue — which came out a few days *after* the company filed its cert petition.

Note: I don't think we'll learn a ton from the supplemental brief, other than likely confirming (or disproving) my theory on what the DC Cir was doing and what the supplemental brief is about, b/c the gov't says no sealed material will be revealed by filing an unredacted version.

Here's a thread on how I got down that rabbit hole: https://t.co/yhZX0BMsjf
Cross-referencing the district court, DC Circuit, and SCOTUS dockets, it seems likely that the supplemental brief at #SCOTUS relates to a series of rulings — from the dist ct on 1/15 &amp; 1/24 &amp; the DC Cir on 1/29 — that appear to relate to accrual and enforceability of fines.
Recall that last Friday, we learned, definitively from a DC Circuit filing and the district court docket who the lawyers are: It's Alston &amp; Bird for the foreign country-owned company and lawyers with the special counsel's office. Thread: https://t.co/fzF50EF4LA
Update in the mystery grand jury matter: Both sides now agree that the foreign country-owned company’s supplemental brief at #SCOTUS can be filed in unredacted form. (So, I’d imagine that means we’ll be able to read it. Soon? I’m checking.) https://t.co/2wHbjzMXby

When, at the least, the nationwide injunction in this case is stayed — as both sides agree is appropriate in light of the SCOTUS orders — the military will be free to start implementing the Mattis policy, which would ban nearly all trans people from joining the military.

THANK YOU. 		What's next? https://t.co/EB8lrRc6vO
@CamillaDThrilla @rcfp Yes.
There was a per curiam — unsigned — order from the DC Circuit — sealed, of course — on Tuesday. We have no idea what it is, technically, but it doesn't appear to relate to the @rcfp request, so it could be an order on the company's 1/16 motion.
In English: I think the DC Circuit filing on 1/16 by the company likely was a request to stay the accrual of fines. And then on 1/25, the company filed a supplement, responding to the 1/24 ruling from Howell. The government responded to that supplement on 1/28.
Following the 1/24 order from Howell, the company filed a supplement in the DC Circuit on its pending request. That DC Circuit request appears to remain pending, but was initially filed on 1/16, the day after Howell denied a motion to stay the accrual of fines pending [REDACTED]. https://t.co/YpQzVJfxFy
Note also that at least the top government lawyer's office appears to be the same length as the special counsel's office line in Andrew Miller's grand jury dispute. https://t.co/EKetp5VhsX

@GreenLoftJN @JohnDiesattheEn I think you can roll over a lot here, but that is — in part — because some reporters have cyclical beats — i.e., campaign coverage — and they can more easily take time off in odd years. So, it’s truly a part of our job at points that would mean we have lots of accrued time.
@GreenLoftJN @JohnDiesattheEn That’s not our policy.
@GreenLoftJN @JohnDiesattheEn You can roll over a certain amount, and it builds per pay period, not starting at zero on 1/1.

President Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, on today's Roger Stone indictment: "The indictment today does not allege Russian collusion by Roger Stone or anyone else. Rather, the indictment focuses on alleged false statements Mr. Stone made to Congress." https://t.co/IGFHuP3k75
He taught me a lot in our time together at the DC bureau — including from before we even had an office — but he helped you all out, too, when he taught me that my ledes were always bad. “When you write your first lede, hit enter, then write something more direct and accessible.”

In sum: The Trump administration has now asked a federal court to quickly halt enforcement of the last injunction against the transgender military ban issued by Mattis so that DOD can begin implementing the ban.
In today's filing, DOJ asks for "an expedited ruling on this motion." https://t.co/KbxnKK2JDS
As @dominicholden noted yesterday, even the lawyers for the challengers to the ban have acknowledged that the trial court in Maryland should at least stay the nationwide injunction in the Maryland case i the wake of the #SCOTUS orders. https://t.co/qbZPV5bzNA
This follows Tuesday's #SCOTUS orders staying injunctions in two other challenges to the Trump administration's policy: https://t.co/eKOVT9mH6j / The Maryland case injunction, which is as to Trump's initial ban, is the last remaining injunction before DOD can implement the ban.

SCOTUS removed the evidence case from the argument calendar — https://t.co/5wAx3XUgdJ — but has not yet acted on the request to dismiss the case. Today, DOJ's filing asks the justices to hold that decision until they decide what to do with the forthcoming cert petition.
Why is this all worded oddly? This filing is not the actual request for SCOTUS review. Instead, it's a response to the challengers' request that SCOTUS dismiss the case before the justices over the evidence to be allowed at trial in the Census case. See: https://t.co/qk9cYZz8kK
DOJ is going to propose hearing the case in April — or May, which would be unusual: https://t.co/Z5MV8sywYj

Besides the removal of the Census case from the argument calendar — https://t.co/5wAx3XUgdJ — there was no news from #SCOTUS today, a move that likely means DACA, the trans ban, the Title VII LGBT cases, the Indiana abortion case won't be heard this term even if they are granted.
@DLind I mean, I'd file them together at this point.
So, although the case has been removed from the argument calendar — don't think it's gone. I'd be surprised if we don't see it back before the justices, on the merits, yet this term.
So, what now? Well, the most likely next step is for DOJ to ask the Supreme Court to review the case — a request for certiorari before judgment. (This would make sense b/c the issue needs to be resolved before the Census is printed this summer.)
Yesterday, DOJ also announced that it is appealing the district court's ruling. https://t.co/k9v3P0OzI2
Yesterday, the people and groups challenging the inclusion of the question asked #SCOTUS to dismiss the evidence-issue case: https://t.co/qk9cYZz8kK
BREAKING: #SCOTUS removes the Census citizenship question case — over the evidence allowed in the case — from the argument calendar; the "briefing schedule is suspended pending further order of the Court." It was supposed to be heard on Feb. 19.
@Gbencohen If there are no orders today, I would say that's almost certainly what it means.

One case likely to be in that follow-up group would be the Census citizenship question case, assuming DOJ seeks cert before judgment in the near future.
OK, we're on #SCOTUS watch now, waiting to see what, if any, new cases the justices agreed, at today's conference, to hear. These are almost certainly the last grants to be heard this term — unless the court grants an expedited briefing schedule or schedules late arguments. https://t.co/TkEVXUCrn9

That led to BuzzFeed in 2012, which — with several trips around the planet, including covering the marriage equality movement, working at the Supreme Court, and interviewing a president and several cabinet members — led to today.
I started writing more and more about LGBT developments, and when I was finally able to move to DC I had built up enough of a body of work that I started freelancing for @metroweekly. That led to a part-time job, which soon became a full-time job, which soon became my career.
It was the beginning — even though everything I saw, or allowed myself to see, at the time convinced me otherwise.
But, it was also when I restarted Law Dork — the blog is started in law school — and it was the beginning of a new career, soon to be a new city, and — within a year and a half — a new life when I got sober.

Barr doesn't have good answers here. He justifies his answer to the NYT by saying he had seen "articles" about the Uranium One issue and thought there were "tax" issues about the Clinton Foundation, which is a weird attempted hedge between this morning's answer and that quote.

In addition to everything else, this application defines "transgender identity" as "moral misconduct." It doesn't even try the old attempt to claim that conduct, not status — see "homosexual or lesbian sexual activity" — is the issue. https://t.co/dhodEHUS61
(Zarda is a Title VII case, and the cert petition is pending at SCOTUS.)
Hirono asks about Zarda, but doesn't know that cert has already been sought. (And Barr seems to think it's been granted.) On the DOJ position that LGBT people aren't protected, though, Barr seems definitively in favor of DOJ's view, "It's been common understanding for 40 years."
And it could have been much clearer had Booker been more clear about what he was saying. Barr actually seemed more up to date on the Title VII issues than Booker.
All said, that — overall — was QUITE a change from the Sessions view.
He does, however, appear to think that Title VII's sex discrimination ban does not cover discrimination against sexual orientation or gender identity.
BARR: "I am perfectly fine with ... gay marriage, but ... I want accommodation to religious communities." 		Barr thinks firing people because they're LGBT are wrong, and supports legislation banning such discrimination.
This sure SOUNDS contradictory to what Barr told the Senate his views are today. https://t.co/Ujdl5xX5KU
"Given the abuses of the asylum system now," Barr says he'd prefer that processing be done outside the US.
Blumenthal is now asking about the Gitmo policy regarding Haitian refugees, including those with HIV. We wrote a bit about this in 2016 — https://t.co/3v0FwxGyxq — and @scottbix wrote more here re: Barr specifically: https://t.co/VlN2SFfT0u https://t.co/NlHob0rRcn
Blumenthal is up and is talking pardons. He asks whether the president can be prosecuted while in office. Barr notes longstanding DOJ policy that the answer is no and says, "I see no reason to change them [those opinions]."
"I personally am very skeptical of the commandeering argument," Barr says of the argument against the feds re: sanctuary cities.

Leahy is up in round two, and Barr said he has not read the Carpenter decision — a decision from this past term that is one of the most important 4th Amendment decisions of the internet era.
"Is waterboarding torture?"		Barr sighs. He says that the law defined waterboarding as illegal. So, he said the issue is clear now. 		So, he didn't really answer?
Feinstein asks if Barr will give Mueller's report to Congress. 		Barr says his "goal" is to get as much to Congress and the public as is possible. https://t.co/ogqQv7V0QC
In round two, Grassley pushes on FOIA and government openness, noting that agencies too often come up with excuses to keep things quiet.

This is what Kennedy was talking about with the Catholic question, FYI: https://t.co/G8SQoGG7KB
@azstudigital https://t.co/G8SQoGG7KB
Echoing a Sessions issue, Barr appears to think that there is a potential constitutional flaw with nationwide injunctions. 		"I'd like to see these universal injunctions challenged," Barr says.
Kennedy suggests that some of his colleagues think Catholics can't serve in government, a reference to issues raised about certain judicial nominees' positions.
We're back. It's Kennedy time. He's asking about leaks. https://t.co/ZsNHbPY5xB
Having 10-minute "comfort breaks" is the first true sign of the Lindsey Graham Era on Judiciary.
In Sen. Hirono's questioning, Barr appears to mostly agree with Sessions' policies on (mostly against) consent decrees.
@ChrisRaimondi @RVnGrammy No, he’s not. I meant to make a reference to the joking about Barr’s grandson and wrote nephew, which made it all confusing.
Sen. Hawley is up. [Correction: I failed at making a joke with this tweet, and it just led to confusion, so making it just a tweet.] https://t.co/ysfIt8giNK
@MirMGreg @nlawson946 Enh. Barr isn’t going to say allegations against Trump are “stomach-churning” at his confirmation hearing. It was awkward, but that wasn’t particularly surprising to me.
"The president can fire a US Attorney," Barr says — but if Trump fired a US Attorney to stop an investigation: "I would not allow an investigation to be stopped if it was a lawful investigation," Barr says.
Blumenthal is now going down a similar path as Coons had done regarding whether Barr will allow Mueller unfettered authority, and Barr is responding the same way.
Blumenthal is asking about the Mueller report, and he pretty much continues down the same path as was traveled this morning, asking Barr to be as transparent as possible.
Sen. Blumenthal is up, and tries to get Barr to say that the allegations against Trump are "stomach-churning." Barr appeared to have been confused at first, but I think they got to a point where he was just avoiding answering. https://t.co/TtcIPf8n48
The three roles of the AG, per Barr: 	- providing advice to the president and cabinet (and argue at SCOTUS, I think this was part of this one?)	- being a policy adviser on legal and law enforcement issues	- top law enforcement officer enforcing the law

@DogsHateBoots He didn't "deflect." He answered, and then contextualized.
Barr goes on to say, however, that he thinks China is a bigger foe.
Now up: Sen. Sasse, who talks about Russia. "Is Putin a friend or a foe?" 		Barr: "I think the Russians are a potent rival of our country. ... I think he wants to weaken the American alliances in Europe. I think he wants to become a bigger player in the Middle East." https://t.co/cdfwOTDROf
Quick analysis: If you read the government's arguments in the past defending the legality of Mueller's appointment, Barr's answers here fit with those arguments — which keep Mueller as an inferior officer and, hence, constitutional under the Appointments Clause.
Barr says the special counsel regulations should not be changed while Mueller remains in his investigation. 		As for if Trump ordered the regs changed or Mueller fired without cause, Barr says: "I would not carry out that instruction."
Barr won't give the same commitment, instead referencing the current regulations, saying that if he disagreed with Mueller as to a prosecutorial decision, Congress would be informed. (This, to me, seems essential to DOJ's arguments re: the validity of Mueller's appointment.)
Coons references the confirmation hearing of Elliot Richardson, Nixon's AG, noting his answers in questions to questions about deferring to the special prosecutor.

Klobuchar asks whether Barr would ever allow the jailing of a journalist "for doing their job." Barr won't directly answer, then says, basically, yes, telling her that "there could be a situation where someone would be held into contempt."
Klobuchar asks about voting issues, and Barr gives a non-specific response.
Asked a thinly veiled question by Klobuchar about whether Trump working on the misleading Trump Tower statement would be obstruction of justice, Barr only says: "I'd have to know the specifics."
Klobuchar asks about FBI leadership and Trump's criticism. On Wray, Barr says: "From what I know, I think very highly of him." https://t.co/TADPJfsbSu
Klobuchar is up, and asks Barr about furloughed DOJ employees. Barr defends Trump's position.

Ernst is focusing on immigration. 		Barr, in response, echoes Ernst: "It's not just a law enforcement problem, it's a national security problem."
The additions followed the fact that no women Republicans were on the committee when Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination was before the committee, leading the Republicans to hire an outside lawyer — a woman — to question Christine Blasey Ford.
Now up: Sen. Joni Ernst. This is the first time a Republican woman has asked questions at a Judiciary Committee hearing. (Ernst and new Sen. Marsha Blackburn are the first two women Republicans ever to serve on the Judiciary Committee.)
Barr says he'd be concerned about the consequences for other groups if that information about FACT's donors were examined — referencing membership groups and the First Amendment.
Whitehouse is now asking about FACT and Whitaker's $1 million payday. "I don't see how the department can do a proper" conflict check if we don't know who was funding FACT.
On White House communications with DOJ, Barr says only the AG and DAG should be talking w the WH re: criminal matters.
Barr says he made no agreement regarding getting rid of Rosenstein in order to get the nomination and that he did not request Rosenstein to leave, that Rosenstein said he viewed the position as a two-year stint.

DOJ reaction to Census ruling: Still reviewing but "disappointed." https://t.co/cIh5mo9AcV
At this point, though, it would still have to all be done on an expedited timetable in order to be heard and decided this term — and decided before the forms need to be printed.
DOJ could seek a stay of Furman's ruling and file a notice of appeal today. At the same time, lawyers in the SG's office could seek cert before judgment at SCOTUS—noting possibility of the justices delaying the evidence case so all of the issues on the case can be heard together.
Now would be a time for DOJ and the SG's Office to seek certiorari before judgment — a reason why using that effort in so many other cases when they lost below might be questioned.
More on the Census ruling to come from @dominicholden, but, on the #SCOTUS issue — recall, the court is due to hear a case over the evidence to be used in the trial in February: https://t.co/s5GUnE4NBK — it's not *exactly* clear what happens now.

Stokeling decision: https://t.co/trfHEezCIB
Thomas's decision for the court supports the 11th Circuit's more broad definition of "violent felony" under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Sotomayor wrote in dissent that the majority's decision "distorts" the court's 2010 decision limiting the ACCA.
The final decision is in Stokeling v. US. Thomas has the opinion for the court, affirming the 11th Circuit in a 5-4 decision in which Breyer joins the conservatives and Roberts joins Sotomayor's dissent with the liberals.
Here is the decision: https://t.co/NCl1yvGSe4 / There will be one more decision today.

Barr also is to say: "I also believe it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the Special Counsel’s work," pledging to provide "as much transparency as I can consistent with the law."
“I believe it is in the best interest of everyone – the President, Congress, and, most importantly, the American people – that this matter be resolved by allowing the Special Counsel to complete his work," Barr is to say. "[O]n my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work."
"If confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with" the special counsel's investigation, Attorney General nominee William Barr will tell the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, per prepared remarks.
As for grants, the next possibility for the justices to grant case will be Friday.

There are other challenges at the lower court level, which is how the matter normally would be considered. Starting at #SCOTUS was a long-shot effort to short circuit the process.
Here was my initial story on that request, which was an effort by Tom Goldstein: https://t.co/8WUdx6KAqp
#SCOTUS denied the request challenging Acting AG Matthew Whitaker's appointment — it was in the form of a "motion to substitute" Rod Rosenstein for Whitaker — and the underlying cert petition for Barry Michaels this morning. There were no noted dissents.
#SCOTUS orders the Kentucky Supreme Court to reconsider its standards for determining intellectual disability in the death penalty context in light of the US Supreme Court's decision in Moore v. Texas. Alito, Thomas, and Gorsuch dissent. https://t.co/Y0kqsVUD2W
Here are the orders: https://t.co/nMboZ4CFmI /
JUST IN: In today's orders, #SCOTUS took no action on DACA, the trans military ban, Title VII LGBT issues, an Indiana abortion clinic case, a Texas gun case, or a 9th Circuit Equal Pay Act decision — meaning all remaining pending before the justices.

And, of course, if the court wants to hear more cases — in May! — it could schedule them. But, that would be unexpected.
We have February's calendar filled &amp; #SCOTUS announced the partisan gerrymandering cases will be heard in March. There are already 21 other granted cases not yet on the schedule for March &amp; April arguments. So, the court could still, technically, fit a case or two in late April.
So, #SCOTUS will issue more orders on Monday — but those rarely include grants at this point in the term (b/c they issued grants today out of the conference). The court then will note on the dockets which cases have been re-listed for the next conference, which is Jan. 18.
And, in another grant, #SCOTUS will address Exemption 4 of FOIA, which exempts disclosure of "confidential" commercial or financial information. The question: What does "confidential" mean? https://t.co/pfoVqsaKr6 https://t.co/TWLoAXSPV7

Why are we paying such close attention to this? This was, likely, the last conference at which cases granted will be heard this term.

@RPMatthews @rickhasen Hi, thanks for your ALL CAPS ANALYSIS. 1. It's news that they're doing this, regardless of their purposes. 2. The proposed shortlist is shorter than the full Fed Soc list — so instructive and news. 3. The shortlist adds two new names from the last shortlist: Grant and Rao.
... Politico's reporting is not telling us about Ginsburg's status. It's telling us about what the White House and Sen. Graham's committee are already doing should there be a vacancy. And that — and the fact that it's happening — is news.
Of course, you need a vacancy to have a vacancy. And, from all that we know and have been told, Justice Ginsburg's surgery was successful at removing the nodules, there is no other evidence of disease, and she is working from home and is planning to return to work. But ...

Here's my report on this Very Interesting Development. —&gt; The Russian Lawyer At The Trump Tower Meeting Was Indicted On Charges Of Obstructing Justice In A Money-Laundering Case https://t.co/poql1rmQim
JUST IN: Natalia Veselnitskaya — the lawyer in the Trump Tower meeting — was indicted related to her alleged actions the Prevezon matter (a hearing for which she also attended on that day in June 2016) on Dec. 20, 2018. The case was unsealed today. https://t.co/cnnoNrmNJH https://t.co/i05BGrz1pw
@RealFacelessMan @ReggieHargett @gabrielmalor I don't disagree. It's an interesting question whether a justice confirmed after arguments should participate in cases heard before he joins the court — and there's no apparent rule — but that is the reasoning, as we understand it.
@shellouise42 @robertloerzel That is not accurate. First, Justice Ginsburg does not have a spokesperson. Second, the Supreme Court's public information officer, Kathy Arberg, only has said what was in my report: https://t.co/xjUj0gqjBE
More —&gt; https://t.co/ETrGDtCh5C
@ReggieHargett @gabrielmalor That's because he was not on the court, not because he had not been at the arguments.
@Scrooched21 @MWPalmer He generally writes a majority opinion for one case each sitting, just like every justice. (They are generally not the high-profile cases, but they're there.)
Chief Justice Roberts again announced from the bench that Justice Ginsburg is "unable to participate" in today's two oral arguments, but will participate in the cases based on the briefs and transcripts. From yesterday: https://t.co/xjUj0gqjBE
Here is the decision: https://t.co/ELbnkgWz0u
The final decision today is in Culbertson v. Berryhill (the acting commissioner of Social Security). Thomas has the majority opinion, reversing the 11th Circuit in a case over fees. The decision was unanimous. #SCOTUS
There is another decision coming.
Here is the decision: https://t.co/S79CZI9fLk #SCOTUS
The first decision is Justice Kavanaugh's first majority opinion, in Henry Schein, Inc. v Archer &amp; White Sales, Inc., vacating the 5th Circuit in an arbitration case. The decision was unanimous. #SCOTUS
This is an interesting thread —&gt; https://t.co/HPQI55QfH0
It's a one-box Tuesday here at #SCOTUS, meaning one or two decisions in argued cases should be coming at 10a.

In both cases, the court said the issue was whether the right at issue was clearly established at the relevant time — for qualified immunity purposes in the 9th Circuit excessive force case and habeas relief in the death penalty 6th Circuit case.
In today's two per curiam decisions, released in the orders, #SCOTUS reversed an excessive force decision out of the 9th Circuit and vacated a habeas grant out of the 6th Circuit. There were no noted dissents from either decision.

@charlie_simpson (Duh. I forgot Shakespeare Theatre Co, where I’ve probably seen more shows than anywhere else! This is why lists are dangerous!)
Night, all, and let us try to be good to one another — and ourselves — this week.
@charlie_simpson DC has tons of good theater. In addition to the Kennedy Center, there’s Arena, Signature, Studio, Woolly Mammoth, Roundabout, Synetic, Keegan, Ford’s Theater, shows at the National and sometimes Warner theaters, and, actually, a lot more! https://t.co/guhO1GDsLr
@elitistja So great. She and Elaine May both.
So, when you see me going off to shows, please understand that this is something I care about. I think it’s important, and I love being able to support the incredible people out there doing such amazing work. 💜 Keep it up.
I am a ridiculously privileged, white cis gay man who gets to see a ton of theater — in part, though, because I’ve prioritized that. I don’t drink, I don’t do much in terms of expensive travel, but I love theater, so that’s where I spend a good deal of my free time and money.
Before the night ends, I wanted to thank three Broadway shows that closed today for the incredible stories — and backstories — they brought to the stage and the larger world: Harvey Fierstein’s Torch Song, Once on This Island, and Head Over Heels. Thank you, all. 😊
@djkocisi2 We’re still waiting on a DC Circuit ruling. Nothing to report.

Well, just sigh now.
Conflicted sigh.
@staceyNYCDC ‘Tis true.
Close was fantastic in The Wife, but Melissa McCarthy gave a performance we almost never get to see and it was flawless.
Close is always fantastic, and she just made her argument for the Oscar.

@EsotericCD Thanks. 😊 And happy new year!
And it’s not just me: I hope everyone else takes some time as this year begins to think about a few things you can do for yourself this year. ... For now, I’m off! Night, all, and let us try to be good to one another — and ourselves — in this new year.
To that end, I’m, once again this year, going to try and sign off here earlier when I’m able to do so and take other time away when I can. There’s so much going on, and it never ends, so I’m just going to step away sometimes to unwind and re-center.
And, of course, there will be shows — I’m going to NYC this weekend! — and concerts. And gaming. And, one hopes, men. And, I’m sure, much more. My point is that I’m going to try to focus on what I need to do for me more in 2019; ultimately, that will be better for everyone.
I got a new blender for Christmas, so I’m hoping to become a smoothie aficionado. I’m going to keep up my exercise routine. I’m going to continue trying to take time off. I’m going to spend time with my friends. I’m going to do other things that work for me, like therapy, etc. https://t.co/8tkHxExlCZ
So, I want to focus on doing those things that keep me centered. My work is better when I do that, and my relationships are better when I do that. I am better when I do that.
In 2019, I want to do a better job of remembering to listen to myself and my body. I’m a gay, alcoholic, bipolar perfectionist; most of my problems come out of those moments when I lose the ability to accept the world as it is. When I’m centered, those moments happen less.
When talking about my sobriety last week, I mentioned that I’d return to this topic. Well, here we are! https://t.co/qdKiAR25YM
Before we know it, everything will be moving in full force again, and it’s easy — at least for me — to lose track of the little things that I do to make my mental and emotional health better and more stable. For me, I need always to remember those things or I get off-center.
Here’s to 2019. As I have for the past few years, I made sure to get to the gym today. It’s a little thing, but it’s a good way of reminding myself that I need to take care of my body — not just for my physical health, but for my mental and emotional heath, too. https://t.co/b8OhWEJtq6

A look back at 2018 and the way the law pushed its way into the center of nearly every major story — stories that, as I write, "highlighted the importance of, consequences of, stability of, and fragility of the [US legal] system and its institutions." https://t.co/Wbm9WTOmeS
@LouisPeitzman Fair.
There's been no real movement from Mueller or the US Attorney's Office for DC, who brought the Patten case, since then on these topics, but today's filing suggests issues in Patten's plea remain so sensitive that prosecutors aren't willing to say anything publicly about them.
Patten's work in question significantly overlapped with Paul Manafort's and Foreigner A has been identified as Konstantin Kilimnik, who was charged alongside Manafort by Mueller's office with obstruction of justice in June. Patten's plea was announced on Aug. 31.
@LouisPeitzman You're so picky.
@MadisonPage16 That's literally what I just tweeted.
Notably, Sam Patten also admitted to, but was not charged with, organizing the purchase of tickets to the Trump/Pence inauguration for a foreigner through a straw purchaser. This was detailed in documents filed on the day of his plea. https://t.co/gXK4qpNjMT
The actual joint status report was filed under seal, so we don't know what's going on exactly. It was still a joint report and today was the day it was ordered to be submitted by the court back in October, so the timing isn't surprising or an attempt to bury this news.
@norriscm huh?
Samuel Patten, the longtime DC lobbyist who pleaded guilty to failing to report his lobbying work for Ukraine back in August (see: https://t.co/69qZ7XsJy3) and agreed to cooperate w/ federal prosecutors including Mueller, had a status report due today. We didn't learn much: https://t.co/IypA13yI1t

OK. TTFN, have some stuff to do!
@RealFacelessMan It was a tweet from more than 5 hours ago. He has not corrected any "conflation," if that's what it was, so, it is what it is: A false statement.
@RealFacelessMan This "let me read a false statement from the president charitably once I figure out what he might have meant even though that would still not make it true" is a very weird way to approach the way someone should handle understanding the president's statements.
@johnson_carrie @renaemerle I cannot wait for this one.
@RealFacelessMan He literally said nothing about the phones being wiped. He said the special counsel's office deleted 19K messages between Strzok and Page. This is false and is a reference to FBI phones' messages and the data collection tool's failure — and it wasn't 19K messages b/w them.
@RealFacelessMan @0x0100007f I do agree with this, as to the iPhones. But this is not the 19,000 number.
@RealFacelessMan Are you talking about the iPhones? Because that's not where the 19,000 number comes from. Read the OIG report and come back.
@davidsanger Yes — like 1,000 for each count — and many of the texts between them were overlaps. So, it's likely less than 10,000. https://t.co/biiEy2yFz6
And here, in the third paragraph of the OIG's conclusion, you'll see where the 19,000 comes from. https://t.co/vLpCRfk9tl
Here's the discussion of the data collection tool, from the OIG report (which is the "recent" happening to which he is referring, I suspect): https://t.co/KxiVlx8YLd https://t.co/oolcTzGbMr
This is completely false, as detailed in the OIG report where this number is explained. The "deleted" texts are actually messages that were not collected, at that time, by an automated tool used by the FBI — not anything done by the Special Counsel's Office, let alone recently. https://t.co/1AjlWTucr9

@dkap6259 Amazing! Congrats!
@KellanMartz @sorrykb Or the judge having raised the question made them realize they didn't want to argue otherwise in a brief, so backed down.
@QuabbityAshwitz As to?
@sorrykb Well, in this case, they're agreeing to continue to work on the returning effort. (I hope that's clear from my tweets!)
@Jondoespolitics The emergency stay request is insofar as the injunction affected people other than the plaintiffs. (See the original story linked to in the first tweet.)
In sum, what's all that mean? 		DOJ told a federal judge that returning those plaintiffs removed due to Sessions' policy on violence-based asylum claims will be treated as "involving the safety of human life" and efforts at returning them will continue during the shutdown.
That briefing was due by 1p today, but, instead of doing so — and here's the news — DOJ backed down, stating it will "treat work relating to complying with the requirements in paragraph 5 ... as excepted activity" and asking for the stay to be lifted. https://t.co/5UZNJqoFNx https://t.co/79UXbs9UyD
Judge Sullivan granted that motion on 12/26. On 12/27, though, he issued a further order, directing briefing on the question of whether paragraph 5  "is related to an 'emergenc[y] involving the safety of human life or the protection of property'" &amp; referencing this provision: https://t.co/lwQd8tULQm
Due to the shutdown, the government has been filing motions to stay proceedings in civil cases. In this case, they only moved to stay paragraph 5 of the court's injunction — the provision ordering the return of plaintiffs removed under the Sessions policy. https://t.co/OvPGnGcbsd

@RichardMilhousN @NonWhiteHat A good point!
@xtrixcyclex Very kind. Thanks.
@CarolynKraft3 Hi, glad to chat more in DMs if you wish. My DMs are open.
@brainvomit1313 Exactly. Sounds like you’re doing your best to take care of yourself. And that’s so important.
@jaolson28 It’s incredible. Congrats!
@EmpathSuper Uncle is plenty for now!
@GivenGrace1986 Amazing! Congrats!
@MollyJongFast Thank you!
@RichardMilhousN @NonWhiteHat That’s impressive, and I’m glad to hear my late-night rambles matter.
@erick70115 Congrats. That’s amazing.

@JohannaVa84 Congrats!
@laurelk229 Congrats! That’s amazing.
@texas_liberal Congrats. That’s amazing.
@Stop_Nonsense1 Lol. I had done the same at first!
For now, it’s bed time. Tomorrow, another day. Night, all, and let us try to be good to one another — and ourselves.
In any event, here I am. I’ve had so much help and love and support to get here, and I am just forever grateful for all of those people — and that I’ve been able to live a sober life for the past 8.5 years.
It’s also important for me to get help — from many directions and many people. If you think you need help with your drinking, there are many options — whether it’s therapy, friends, a 12-step group, inpatient or outpatient help, or something altogether different. Ask around!
I’ll have more on this around the new year, but it’s so important to my sobriety and mental health that I be honest about the things that make me happy — and then organize my life so that I do them.
I also go to bed tonight knowing that I’m back in DC and doing the things that make me feel good about myself and make each day easier — like exercise and fun! https://t.co/1IhtSqsmQx
@srquinn47 Congrats to you. That’s amazing.
@stilljadedco And tomorrow will be another day. Don’t get down. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself. Take the next right step.
@RuningWildly Thanks. Tomorrow will be another day.
@fannonstg Thank you. That’s very kind. (And congrats!)
@cpm5280 Incredible. Congrats!
@ctwbella Amazing. Keep on!
@Stop_Nonsense1 That’s amazing. Congrats!
@eggbeating Fantastic. Congrats.
@djolder Always. 💜
@yashar Thanks, sir. ❤️
So, I head to bed tonight knowing that my life and, I hope, the lives of those around me are better because of that daily decision. I am and will always be imperfect, but knowing that I can always work to improve myself, and can do so sober, gives me hope and a sense of purpose.
But, and again, for me, the most important thing that I do each day is stay sober. It makes all of the other things — including most of the reasons why any of you follow me — possible. One day at a time.
Each day since then has been full of lessons, hopes, challenges, successes, setbacks, happiness, sadness, and everything in between. It’s been, in other words, life. But, there’s not a single day that would have gone better, for me, with a drink.
It’s one of a thousand or more ways that my life is indescribably better thanks to the decision I made on June 27, 2010, to stop drinking, but being able to appreciate what a gift being an uncle is — and my desire to be a good uncle — ranks really high up there.
This year, I got to spend a sixth Christmas w/ Henry, my absolutely wonderful nephew, &amp; a first Christmas w/ his fantastic little brother, Sam. I can’t imagine my world without the joy that they bring into it—and yet I know my sobriety has made those relationships possible. #tbt https://t.co/VJwVlYdXQj
It wasn’t until I took the time to actually hear those people — many of whom were some of the closest people in my life and those who I most respected — and had the courage to be honest with myself that I could do anything about my addiction.
Eight-and-half years ago — 102 months ago — I decided that I needed to live a different life. Alcohol had long stopped working for me that way I once had imagined it did. It had long caused problems for me. I had long avoided others’ comments of concern. https://t.co/lX7LK2oXt5
This was my ninth sober Christmas, and while I still have much to work on to improve myself, it’s impossible to imagine the Christmases I have now existing as they do if I were still drinking.
@nabihasyed @MatthewSchafer @BuzzFeedNews Agreed, all around.

@patrickmcmahonn Roll play.
— He wished the child Merry Christmas, asked if all was cool,	Asked how old he was, and if he was doing well in school. 	But I heard him exclaim, ere I let him fall out of sight—	“Are you still a believer in Santa Claus? Because at 7 it's marginal, right?”
... A glare in his eye and a twist of his head 	Soon gave me to know I had so much to dread;	He spoke so many words, did so little work.	He began calling the children; he was kind of a jerk. 	Laying his fingers all over the phone,	And giving a nod — (This will make you moan.)
And Melania in her 'kerchief, and POTUS in his cap,	Had just settled down to make calls for NORAD,	When out in the hall there arose such a clatter —	Trump sat in his chair, he didn’t even appear to notice. https://t.co/Zo8o3KohxQ

@ASilNY The story answers that question.
The cabinet secretaries were worried as they went to their beds;	While visions of vacancies danced in their heads.

@JustRichWebster Right, I know. (I remember that coming up when the guy was renominated for the one post.) If the new law specifies that references to the old title apply to one or the other, then him. Otherwise, I’d say it skips to the next in line.

@nycsouthpaw @jameswest2010 I was thinking more, "The Things I've Seen Would Make You Faint."

And, since it seems to matter so often these days, here's the rest of the line of succession at the Pentagon. Under a 2010 EO, next after the Deputy is the Secretary of the Army, then Navy, then Air Force. Here's the EO: https://t.co/R7nx0HBw6G https://t.co/78wuLoFlXx
@NakatomiTim @MarkSZaidEsq There has been reporting that it’s a Special Counsel’s Office matter, and the DC Circuit opinion stated that it is a subpoena regarding a company owned by a foreign country. Most beyond that is speculation.
Note Trump's language: Shanahan "will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense" on 1/1/19. This appears to signify an automatic move under federal law — 10 USC 132 — and not an appointment (hence, "assume the title of"). https://t.co/fv7UExJWsQ https://t.co/4qjDPj2fU9

@BradMossEsq Makes more sense, procedurally. And, yesterday’s denial just came from the three judges.
@BradMossEsq And, it wasn’t necessarily an en banc request. I think this is much more likely: https://t.co/NEl2mvsP6x
@BradMossEsq Well, this is only a stay application at this point, so, no (apparent) cert petition (yet). (Of course, it could be worded as a stay request with cert and/or mandamus as an alternative argument.)

On Thursday and Friday, note that there was sealed action in the case, at the DC Circuit, leading up to today’s #SCOTUS filing: https://t.co/75tRf91HTt
@joshindenver Makes sense, yeah. SCOTUS action today.
Note: https://t.co/SSxsGbcmdT
It is an application for a stay, so likely an effort to stay the lower courts’ refusal to quash the subpoena and halt the continuing fines on the company for not complying (similar to what was sought in the DC Circuit).
BREAKING: The company owned by a foreign country that is challenging a grand jury subpoena in federal court in DC, and lost its challenge at the DC Circuit, has asked the US Supreme Court to step in. The case is under seal, so we have no additional information at this time. https://t.co/HlybVd4Dd5
