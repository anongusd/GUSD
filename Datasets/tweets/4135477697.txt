@RepThomasMassie absolutely not sir. Do not merge state run medical cannabis programs with federal background checks for guns.

Watch some great videos about Veterans learning how 2 grow medicine. Just growing cannabis is therapy in itself. now combine that with what comes out of the plant after maturity—you have a way to heal. Veterans can get their lives back through cannabis. Great job @Matt_Grimshaw https://t.co/0fv1CNZymr
We could bring thousands of jobs to Veterans here in the USA. Cannabis can heal in many ways, 1–by therapy just from growing. 2–the medicine that comes from those grows. 3-giving Veterans purpose again. JOBS JOBS JOBS and Veterans getting purpose again! https://t.co/UkbMbEa2La
@BrianKempGA 55% of GA voters Supprt cannabis legalization and 81% support in state cultivation of MEDICAL CANNABIS. Why do U not?

Great job Sir and thank you so much for working for Veterans and patients in FL and throughout our country! #FMCCE #cannabissaves https://t.co/UHJVIi9ivg
@realDonaldTrump @SenatorIsakson @VAChair @mattgaetz @RepBrianMast @SenBillNelson @SenDuckworth why does it take media getting involved &amp; threatening to put the VA on television. To get a Veteran his prosthetic leg? Your system is still broken. Employees are awesome. System sux! https://t.co/RhKBDPNqe7
Absolutely sickening. A child taken from his parents because they use a natural medicine that alleviates his seizures!! @SenatorIsakson @sendavidperdue @GovernorDeal please get involved and demand these charges be dropped and the parents reunited with son and with medicine!! https://t.co/NAbbIpWAIa
We could lead the nation &amp; show how GA’s VETERANS can lower costs @ VA if you would allow us 2 grow medical cannabis for GA’s Veterans and civilians. We could also bring thousands of jobs to GA. We are willing to sit down with you anytime to discuss how we can make it happen! https://t.co/M0Tbt4tOyN
Please remember you are not alone! If you see a brother or sister who seems “off”. Call and talk to them or stop and say hello. Help each other out &amp; let’s take 22 down to zero! Approximately 22 Veterans a day commit suicide. We can reduce this!	Veterans Crisis Line 800-273-8255
@FLGovScott sir you have no merit to appeal last weeks court decision. Please let medical cannabis be. Let patient’s live in peace and have access to medicine without interference from the state. Whole plant Cannabis is perfect in its natural form. That’s how nature intended it. https://t.co/DBwD9fiSaq
@CaseyCagle U are very quick to help businesses and corporations. When will u help Patients? Veterans? When will u allow us access 2 life saving medicine? When can Vets grow medicine in GA and save GA’s Veterans? Until u decide VETERAN LIVES over profit, We will not support U. https://t.co/NSFWtu27uO
Florida Supreme Court has decided not to lift the stay against a patient @joeredner is dying of cancer and the lower court said he could grow his own medicine.

We like him but are absolutely not sold on this 10 billion dollar deal the the DOD said unequivocally does not work.

@millerkevinc @realDonaldTrump We could not agree more and have been advocating for the research for years now. No one will put the money behind it to find the program. We will eventually find the funding. The question is how many more of our brothers and sister need to die before congress sees the problem?
@Stand4Heroes let’s work together to bring Cannabis to the forefront as a treatment option for Veterans and also active duty. All we need is the funding. We have the plan and the personnel. #cannabissaves #pillskill

And the #1 cost to the VA is prescriptions too. So why In the world are we spending more $$$ on pills than care 4 our Veterans. Why are we not preventing issues instead of pharmaceutical management? Yes it’s all about the money!! Cannabis can be grown by Veterans @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/GvkVKoivbX

@FLGovScott Veterans tell U what we're going 2 do &amp; then do it. We don't hide it/be secretive about it. Like putting a medical cannabis program together we'd make sure Veterans actually got a license 2 grow. No need for that when you know who's getting it before they're issued.
FLORIDA voters.  Beware--Your governor is PLAYING the system like a super conductor of an orchestra.

Not the ones who work at the VA but the ones who are supposed to be cared for by the VA. @realDonaldTrump @SenDuckworth @RandPaul @SenBillNelson @SenateMajLdr https://t.co/Btfpvw9c6p
It’s time to end the war on Cannabis. @realDonaldTrump please push for Veterans to get access to life saving cannabis medicine. WE ARE BEGGING and everyday dying from overdose’s that can be prevented and suicides that can be reduced. @VAChair why are you letting us die!???? https://t.co/slTJ0oGxkx
This week is the week to call your members of Congress and ask them to support the 2018 farm bill that would remove hemp from schedule 1 classification. @HurdOnTheHill @RepMattGaetz @RepTimWalz @SenDuckworth and hey @VAChair when are you going to support Veterans growing hemp? https://t.co/kmUjGRjTWP
@VAChair @SenatorTester how about you two work with your colleagues and get the VA a boss B/C Veterans are dying everyday and there isn’t a leader at the helm. And while ur @ it, allow us 2 use Cannabis as a treatment option. Help save lives instead of taking lives with bigpharma https://t.co/1w10OzTAdP

We could not agree with you more Sir @JohnMorganESQ FACT alcohol is # 1 reason our military members get in trouble.

@RepTimWalz sir we can not say thank you enough 4 listening &amp; absorbing then acting on behalf of Veterans!

@VAChair @DeptVetAffairs Bet you didn’t talk about tremendous cost reduction the VA could see by allowing Veterans access 2 Cannabis!! VA spends more money on pills than on care for us. How bout talking 2 VETERANS who use VA to see how 2 improve care and reduce cost. We have an open door and phone policy
@VAChair @DeptVetAffairs Bet u didn’t talk about best option to end overdose deaths n our Veteran community. Medical cannabis states have a 25% reduction in overdose deaths. Thats black and white FACT. Cannabis saves lives. Johnny your personal life experience should support Cannabis access for Veterans.
Pennsylvania Veterans!! Flower will be available for you all. We are moving forward and soon the entire Veteran community throughout the country will have access to life saving Cannabis medicine. https://t.co/VRBtqm2Cxd
@RepTimWalz @DrPhilRoe @RepLouCorrea Sir we support this but we would also like to see verbiage in the bill that allows the VA to work with organizations outside VA like Veterans For Cannabis and also get the medicine from sources other than Mississippi grow. Happy to help out anyway we can.
Soon hemp will hopefully be completely federally legal and open the way for organizations like Veterans For Cannabis to grow and extract our own hemp based products for Veterans and civilians both to reduce opioid dependency. @VAChair when are u going to see the lives being saved https://t.co/xJuOmhVpZr
@VAChair @VAVetBenefits It’s great U look forward to hearing from some people and then some of us are on your town hall phone calls and you dont want to take questions about your inability to accept medical Cannabis as a treatment option for Veterans. When you get outa office bet u will listen then!
@Rep_Mel_Ponder sir, tomorrow we will be meeting with a Veteran in your district who can not use his Cannabis medicine because he is going through Veterans court. We will reach out to you and your team afterwords to determine how to solve this issue as quickly as possible.
Today was another great day in FL for patients who can not afford cannabis medicine. This case will set precedent and set patients up to fight the government. This will SAVE LIVES. Judge again clears way allowing man to grow own cannabis		(Via Daily News) https://t.co/JewLB02EGc

@realDonaldTrump you want to save Veteran lives. Work with Joshua Littrell &amp; Veterans For Cannabis. we will show you a safe, non toxic, natural alternative 4 pain manangement. CANNABIS SAVES AND WORKS. Don’t need studies. Just need you to make it legal and save millions of lives.
@realDonaldTrump if you want to reduce the number of deaths from opioids give Veterans &amp; civilians both access to Cannabis as treatment. U can save lives. Put Joshua Littrell in charge of the VA and he will fix that broken system. Put people in charge who use VA as primary care.
@realDonaldTrump sir I️ can tell you 1sthand that the opioid epidemic can not be fixed by taking medication away from Veterans who have been managing their pain for sometimes decades responsibly with pain meds. You are pushing Veterans to street drugs or to take their own lives.

@Mark_Schlabach @cbs46 It's ridiculous that we are still putting people in jail for cannabis. He should have known better, but the cop could also have taught him a lesson by not taking him to jail. Discretion over ruining a life means the world to those of us who put our lives on the line for Freedom.
