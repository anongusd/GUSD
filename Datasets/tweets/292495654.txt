.@RonWyden: The mission of the EPA is to protect human health, and to fight for clean air and water, for everyone. Wheeler fights for those who endanger our health and pollute our air and water. 		This isn’t a tough call. I’m a NO on this backward and dangerous nomination.
.@RonWyden: That’s why there’s so much grassroots energy out there about the Green New Deal, which I’m proud to co-sponsor. People know what a grave threat climate change poses, and they want action.
.@RonWyden: It’s only going to get worse, if this country doesn’t address it with big, bold steps. My wife and I have 11 year old twins and a 6 year old daughter. I think about what their generation is going to be dealing with down the road.
.@RonWyden: Climate change is not just about fires. Across the West there’s the threat of crippling drought. The hurricanes that batter the east coast and the gulf of Mexico are intensifying and drowning our cities with rain.
.@RonWyden: And perhaps most alarming of all, Wheeler essentially waves his hand at the existential threat of climate change. In my home state, when you’re talking about climate change, you’re talking about fires. And not your grandfather’s fires.
.@RonWyden: Wheeler is rolling back rules designed to protect workers from exposure on the job to dangerous chemicals that can cause asphyxiation and heart attacks. 	   	He’s rolling back EPA’s enforcement writ large, eviscerating a whole host of safeguards already on the books.
.@RonWyden: Wheeler is rolling back fuel economy standards that reduce pollution and help drivers save at the pump -- and not even car makers support him on that. 	   	He’s rolling back rules designed to stop dirty power plants from belching toxic gasses into the air.
.@RonWyden: Given what he’s done during his time as acting head of the EPA, he’s already proven what sort of backward-facing administrator he will be: Andrew Wheeler will be “Administrator Rollback.”
.@RonWyden: An EPA administrator ought to work to protect our health and the environment. Wheeler has spent his career as an industry lobbyist, doing just the opposite.
.@RonWyden: Wheeler is Scott Pruitt without the appetite for luxury travel on the taxpayer dime. Yet another descendant of the sea doing the bidding of the dirtiest, most powerful industries out there, no matter what physical harm his policies will inevitably bring to Americans.
.@RonWyden: the Senate is debating the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as administrator of the @EPA. I’ve got bad news for anyone who wants the EPA to live up to its mission: to protect public health so Americans can breathe clean air and drink clean water.
.@RonWyden will be speaking on the Senate floor shortly against Andrew Wheeler’s nomination to be @EPA administrator. Follow this thread for live updates. ⬇️

.@RonWyden: William Barr has been more than clear about where he stands. He believes that the president alone decides when there’s a threat and, when he does, he doesn’t have to worry about Congress, judges, the laws or the Constitution.
.@RonWyden: Members of both parties have long been concerned about surveillance authorities under FISA or the possible abuse of FISA. But those concerns are small potatoes compared to what Mr. Barr has proposed, which is that the law need not constrain the president at all.
.@RonWyden: Fears about Mr. Barr’s views on surveillance are not conjecture.  They are based on Mr. Barr’s own testimony. I ask every member of this body to read it and consider what is at stake.
.@RonWyden: Mr. Barr’s dangerous views on executive power have been consistent throughout his career. But in 2003, he laid out in his position that the president is not accountable to surveillance laws and that the president enjoys giant loopholes in the Fourth Amendment.
.@RonWyden: As Mr. Barr himself has made clear, he would take us back forty years, to an era before the Church Committee when neither Congress nor the courts had any role at all in checking or overseeing an abusive, out-of-control government.
.@RonWyden: Mr. Barr poses a unique threat to the rule of law and the Fourth Amendment. If he is confirmed as attorney general, Mr. Barr could take us back, and not just twelve years to an era of warrantless wiretapping.
.@RonWyden: What Mr. Barr has said is that regardless of whether Congress votes for more checks and balances and oversight, it doesn’t matter. Because Mr. Barr has made it crystal clear that the president can do what he wants.
.@RonWyden: There is a bipartisan coalition in the Congress that has fought to protect the privacy and constitutional rights of Americans.  But Mr. Barr’s views, once I have laid them out today, should frighten every member of this body.
.@RonWyden: That brings me to the topic I want to focus on today: Mr. Barr’s dangerous views on surveillance &amp; his contempt for surveillance laws and the 4th Amendment. This is not a partisan issue.
.@RonWyden: I am firmly opposed to the nomination for many reasons, I am deeply concerned about his view that the President is effectively royalty...

.@RonWyden: I’ve been a member of the Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee, which oversees FERC, for a while now. I have to say, I’ve never seen anything like this sort of deliberate effort to hijack the Commission, pick Americans’ pockets, &amp; do the bidding of special interests.
.@RonWyden: McNamee wanted to implement a taxpayer-funded bail out for big coal companies. His proposal was so flawed, every member of the commission he’s nominated to join voted to reject it.
.@RonWyden: McNamee has a plan to bail out the dirtiest, oldest, most inefficient coal plants, &amp; he wants American families to pay for it with higher utility rates. Let’s not sugarcoat Mr. McNamee’s plan. It’s a ripoff of American consumers &amp; a big payoff for coal executives.

.@RonWyden: Is rushing a flawed bill the best way to make major changes to privacy law? 		No.		 #StopCISA
.@RonWyden: This memo’s interpretation is inconsistent with the public’s understanding of the law. It should be withdrawn &amp; made public.
.@RonWyden: There is a secret DoJ memo that is clearly relevant to the cybersecurity debate, which continues to be withheld from the public
.@RonWyden: It is wrong to say that corporations’ privacy rights matter more than individuals’ privacy rights do. #StopCISA
.@RonWyden: Cybersecurity legislation must contain strong protections for privacy rights of law-abiding Americans. CISA does not #StopCISA
.@RonWyden: Any information-sharing bill that lacks adequate privacy protections is not a cybersecurity bill – it is a surveillance bill
.@RonWyden: It’s also imperative for cybersecurity that government agencies don’t force companies to weaken security standards #NoBackdoors

.@RonWyden: It’s my colleagues right to agree w/13% of experts who think CISA is a good idea. But they can't pretend it's not controversial
