@thehill Wrong Senator. It happens everyday!!
@thomaskaine5 Likely!!!! Unlikely they didn't have!!
@finebaum Spring practice and the NCAA
@RepCummings You, Sir, are one of the great ones!!
@JohnJHarwood No
@SpiritBen Our players and coaches handled this situation in a classy way!!
Why sure! Everyone has done that in some form or another. It was an allocation of time and striving for the best we can be. https://t.co/m7VuBKQ8Z5
@alfranken Read his book. Shows his inexperience. Great but scary read!! Miss you Senator!!
@EdKrassen Strengthens the field!!
@SenWarren If he let's these Section 8 and mortgage interest assistance contracts expire then that's a high crime and misdemeanor!!
@in_pubs I'm with you!!
@NikkiHaley I agree!! That  ,also, should apply to the Executive Branch.
@BarbMcQuade @MSNBC @maddow @chrislhayes @KatyTurNBC @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika @NicolleDWallace @AliVelshi Watch MSNBC daily. Enjoy all of you. You all deal in FACTS!
@ProudResister Proud of you!!  Been sober 30 years
@PreetBharara Relax! You're not alone!
@StevenBeschloss Certainly its disproportionate representation.
@McFaul @NBCNews @MSNBC Enjoy your comments.  They come from experience and knowledge.

@tonyschwartz Stocks trade on fundamentals and corporate vision going forward. Trumps behavior has triggered this. People are hitting the sidelines!
@PreetBharara Many thanks for clearing that up for the 7 year olds!
@alfranken Mexico is not responding to the offer!
@TomSteyer When the Dept. of Treasury starts checking Banks on liquidity, that will spook the street!!
@amjoyshow Joe because of experience. We really need that to clean up this mess.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I agree!!
@McFaul We gave them their money back that we had been holding for years. Bet we kept the interest. Just another Trump lie.
@McFaul Doesn't the executive branch have anyone who can  interpret for him?
@siano2020 Unstable and idiot!
@TomSteyer The model is do whatever it takes regardless of the rules.
@TomSteyer I'm with you. At the end of the day,  stocks trade on fundamentals and corporate vision going forward. Spent 45 years in the investment banking business.

@BradLoganCOTE @ClayTravis @Outkick You (ESPN), better figure out how to keep this guy on.
@SteveKornacki What about the near wins?
@JoeNBC Stay on him. As you said this morning, all the repubs are scared of him.
@BillKristol @MalcolmNance Took the words right out of my mouth. Volume increased after the tweet.
@JefferyByres @BarrettSallee Check out where these guys were on the depth chart. Weren't playing a lot. Look at the facts but an opportunity for them.
@BarrettSallee My opinion. One of the reasons he decided to transfer was that there was a real question in his mind about being able to beat Jordan out.
@GunterBrewer Prayers for your family! Billy was a great guy. We were teammates for three years and lifelong friends. He'll be missed by all.
@SECcountry I bet none of these sportswriters never played a snap on the college level. They wouldn't know  a coach from goat!!
@RomaroMiller It's the follow up that will change. The actions taken going forward that could change.
@mspears96 I don't know. His short game is really dialed in. Wouldn't bet against him.
@BarackObama I voted for JFK and Obama for all the good and right reasons. If the youth stay behind this issue, it will come.
@TylanKnight Congratulations! Thanks for signing at Ole Miss! Great decision.
@lukeknox24 Played there years ago. Congratulations! It'll be the time of your life. Good luck!
@finebaum I said a 50 point dog. Men against boys.
@NewsHour Someone needs to come to their senses. The Republicans and The White House has not showed any ability to.
@LanceMBarry @RickyBuckets @JWCanes2 @Charg3r2 @Cobrag6 @Solid_Quez I played on those teams. No leather helmets. How much success you guys had in the 21st Century?
@BradLoganCOTE Not a severe blow. Lots of time left in 2019 cycle.
@JTaamu10 You're the man!!
@alfranken Your a good man that represented your constituents well. Know you'll continue to make many contributions to society.
@BradLoganCOTE That's pure BS. The ball had crossed the plane and he had control at that time.
@melindagates Your sense of purpose,  attitude,  helping others, and peace of mind most important to me!!
@CoachPhilLongo Welcome to Ole Miss!! You and your family will love it.
@Rconyers75 Thank him for his service and contributions to Ole Miss and young people!!
@HillaryClinton you bet!! Already voted for HRC
@CNN What might happen is that he gets locked up.
