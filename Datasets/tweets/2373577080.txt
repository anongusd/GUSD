QUOTES| "American management thinks that they can just copy from Japan" - Deming
TEEN_TIME when your money is trapped in PayPal and you have to shop to get it out
Maybe a living wage is liberal Hollywood for star unemployment
In the USA if you make the same you're twice as smart and the homes are half as much
In Canada a broomstick makes $15 but the homes are sky high so they don't live near you
Living wagers are the first to try their luck on one another...all young MDs on high alert it plenty of fish season
You can't tell the human potential of a living wager stuck in a deadend job. Its Gigi
@DPRK_News @Cernovich Hope not!
The national socialistic agenda in Canada equates Harvard to a broomstick and calls it social justice. Canada is a bipedal terrorist.
The national socialist agenda calls Amazon's skilled wage the minimum wage at $15. America will be the next national socialist nuclear superpower
Canada pumped $200 million into the Clinton Foundation, as America grows, the poor are vocal about creating a national socialist agenda using financiers of the Tower of David
Cotez helped finance the Tower of David, and she is in the US for more
A living wage is National Socialism, yes the poor but more so the uneducated are creating the agenda for the educated in demand labor
The Canadian people assert cultural priorities over monopolistic airwaves yet fail to consume domestic products and sneak foreign goods into the country. Canadians are good for nothing.
@cxcope Who are they?
The NYT follows no course of modern 20th century journalism but 19th century flyers
Calling Mrs Trump a whore is a  slap in the face
Canada is a NATO traitor
Canada has not not fund a harmful cult including ISIS, Falun Gong, and Anti Christ Christianity
Lying and violence willfully are the same that ISIS is a cult like Falun Gong
Other things about London ONT; if Brescia may close again this year or Toronto bring in needles, the Junos can go suck its own dick #music #governing
London ONT I can already tell; Junos cost money? How about the comic and record swap as usual then? Sure.

I'll do it, it'll be my break out role for a successful movie career.
Why don't you put Sarah Jessica Parker against Trump and save your own.
URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ Engineering jobs aren't for Uber or Tesla slugs and they never will be; governments just aren't real people any more!
URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ Working for such companies is the same as wasting your time dealing dime bags, you make just as much, and it trashes your resume; it makes the government of those places look particularly money grubbing
URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ And it's the same problem in the West as it is in Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Syria and East Asia!
URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ If I were paide $100K to solve math problems as Engineers I wouldn't be caught dead with a CEO like Uber's or Tesla's showboating; government people just don't get it!

That's my tip.

URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ Poor or rich, talented or successful, the media is using false weights to weigh gold for rheumy eyed people looking for a pass through tall mountains.
URBAN FIXSHION WRITING ✒ Social welfare is providing the poor with what they need; it's like a closet not like wiping their ass for them. If you know what you need they're glad for it and then leave.
If the rich pay for their boy's way, so can the poor, that they're on the same level

If being poor is a 'disability' then you need a special program other than working in the capitalist market. You see trillions and billions, you don't know where it goes and what it means because Drake's been throwing it around for free
That's an easy one, it's you not because you're poor. Poor is a monster that follows you around that has nothing to do with the US Constitution in this case about suspended driver's licenses
NEWS! Miss Philippines wins Miss Universe 2018 – Thailand https://t.co/faXz0wfhFn
No bus would be unconstitutional. If Californian's are taxed on SMS texts and they put that toward public transit, then driver's licenses will still suspended because that's what taxes and public transit is for. Lookihere, poverty can be Drake or Elon, so it's not about that.
