@TheDemocrats How is the border wall expensive when compared to what we as U.S. Citizens have to pay yearly to the illegals coming into our country. The U.S. pays out over $125 BILLION a year for illegals. Pay for the frackin wall already. It is a cost of $25 Billion to build.

@CadetBrainSpurs @realDonaldTrump Are you a Socialist?
@CadetBrainSpurs @realDonaldTrump NAZI = a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party.
@CadetBrainSpurs @realDonaldTrump I asked you a question. Answer the question. The only NAZI I see is the ones from the left.
@Richard15498168 @NeroFiddled @realDonaldTrump Sorry but, they are not trying to get to the United States legally. They are trying to cheat the system.
@CadetBrainSpurs @realDonaldTrump Sure you are. One question, are you a Socialist?
@kennethcohn @NeroFiddled @realDonaldTrump Let them all into Liberal/Progressive states. Let's see how they solve this fucked up issues of illegals.
@kendraleeober @realDonaldTrump He is following the law. Get off of your fat ass and read what the laws are and stop relying on the MSM.
@donajea3161 @realDonaldTrump So tell me, what law has he not followed?
@NeroFiddled @realDonaldTrump They are NOT immigrants, they are invaders. Mexico does not want them. If they were immigrants, they would come to our country legally!!!
@CadetBrainSpurs @realDonaldTrump In what way? Do you have inside info? Or, do you believe what you are told by the MSM?

@realDonaldTrump Are we a Nation of Laws or a third world country?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Aww, another snowflake that does NOT know the laws. Good grief, you remind me of my brother, a complete idiot!!
@realDonaldTrump It is called child abuse when others use children to benefit their means. The LAW applies to all not just certain individuals. If I make to much sense, then just move along.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you. We are a Nation of Laws not a Nation without laws.

@John_KissMyBot Do not get me wrong. I am a Constitutionalist but, there are many incorrect quotes out there. Just take a few minutes to check the validity of any quote.
@John_KissMyBot FYI it was not Hilter that banned the guns but, the previous gov that did to prevent the Nazi's form having weapons This Idea backfired on them when Hilter rose to power. Hilter did take advantage of this and made many laws to prevent the Jews from using any form of self-defense.
