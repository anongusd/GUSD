@loondale @agendamigrante Fleeing violence is literally what asylum law was created to address.
@loondale I would just encourage you to strive for a slightly more nuanced idea about what kinds of people the members of the caravan are. It's possible that there are multiple interacting reasons that have driven them to migrate, which can be both violence and lack of economic opportunity
@loondale You do realize that the US is a member of the UN? That the UN is in NYC?
@loondale No, actually. UNHCR doesn't write the laws for asylum for any country. They make recommendations and create international agreements but they have no power to make any country take that up as their domestic law.
@loondale @agendamigrante Finally, if they're coming to a port of entry, they aren't doing anything illegal at all. Currently they don't even have to go to a port of entry if they're asking for asylum. I just think the hysteria over this is a bit ridiculous.
@loondale @agendamigrante The UNHCR, again, does not have any authority over the caravan. They can create refugee camps and provide resources but they literally can't tell them what to do.
@loondale @agendamigrante But many of them truly are fleeing violence in their home country. This video clearly did not want to show you those people, because it wouldn't fit their narrative. Again, it isn't illegal to ask for asylum, no matter what your reason. Whether it is granted is another issue.
@loondale @agendamigrante Third, this video tries to convince you that every single member of the caravan is purely motivated by economic reasons. That may be true of some, and they wouldn't qualify for asylum in the US.
@loondale @agendamigrante Secondly, if your only source is this one video, you have a completely misrepresented view of this group. Many have opted to stay in Mexico. There's nothing saying that they HAVE to do that, if they're asking for both asylum or immigration.
@loondale @agendamigrante First of all, I am literally currently writing my thesis on refugees and citizenship in the international system lmao. Im legit going to Africa in 2 weeks to conduct field research on the subject, so stay tuned lol

Not only is Trump's proposal unconstitutional, it goes against a fundamental American legal value.
There are two kinds of citizenship: jus soli and jus sanguinis. In other words, citizen by right of the soil, and citizen by right of blood. The US has been a partial jus soli country since independence, and fully jus soli country since the end of slavery/14th amendment.
I specialize in understanding statelessness. And Trump's citizenship stunt, if enacted, would lead to literally millions of stateless people in this country, many of whom would theoretically qualify for citizenship even under the new law.
