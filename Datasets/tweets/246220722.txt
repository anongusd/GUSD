We on the left have been calling Trump a treasonous bastard during his first year in office because we knew the truth about this TRAITOR. It now appears that weak-ass media &amp; conservative pundits are catching up with us. We were right all along! #TreasonSummit https://t.co/KAdZc3yhbz
What is absolutely scary is that Trump‚Äôs staff prepared a plan for him to confront Putin about his attack on our election &amp; Trump willfully &amp; recklessly ignored his staff‚Äôs plan &amp; advice. The dangerous &amp; reckless MANIAC is NOT listening to anyone. What does Putin have on him? https://t.co/4PbPHGC2tQ
@Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle Kelly is NOT a man of honor or integrity. A man of honor does NOT blatantly lie on a Black Congresswoman with a racial animus. A man of integrity does NOT refuse to apologize after being caught in his racist lie. Kelly is a dishonorable LIAR &amp; RACIST. https://t.co/F3knuTonFo

Dear media: STOP calling it ‚Äúmeddling!‚Äù Russia‚Äôs widespread, military-sponsored, planned cyberattack was a declaration of WAR on America‚Äôs most important democratic institution ‚Äî our elections. This WAR will continue to do more damage to the nation than a few bombs. https://t.co/ChpQbZ2AZi
