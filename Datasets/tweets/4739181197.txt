As someone who is a de-facto Democrat, I would say we need to run more candidates like Richard Ojeda and Amy McGrath to win back these areas.
To reinforce my argument, I would look at what Tim Ryan said in his bid to overthrow Nancy Pelosi. I think the Republican strategists have done a good job canvassing the democrats as aristocrats out of touch with mainstream society. (This is ironic because of Trump‚Äôs wealth)
The term ‚Äúcoastal elites‚Äù shows the branding struggle the Democrats have. Even though the majority of people are liberal, I feel that a lot of people in the supposedly forgotten Midwest see them as lacking their values. https://t.co/EDyN9bBBW7
