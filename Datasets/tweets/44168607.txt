(1 of 18) Timely Warning The following information was reported to the Gainesville Police Department (GPD) and is being distributed to the
(2 of 18) campus community due to the crime‚Äôs close proximity to the University of Florida campus:		A robbery was reported to the Gainesville
(3 of 18) Police Department that occurred at 920 S.W. Depot Avenue (Wood River Apartments) on Friday, November 30th, 2018 at approximately
(4 of 18) 12:45 AM.		The victim said someone knocked on the door and when she opened it slightly, a black male attempted to force the door
(5 of 18) open while armed with a silver and black handgun. The victim resisted and began screaming for help. Neighbors came out to see what
(6 of 18) was happening and the suspects ran to and fled in a Dodge Charger style vehicle, possibly gray in color with tint on the
(7 of 18) windows.		The suspects are described as two black males, with one wearing a camo jacket and jeans, the other was wearing a red
(8 of 18) shirt, jeans and a dark jacket. 	 	Anyone with information about the incident or who may know the suspects' identity is asked to
(9 of 18) call the Gainesville Police Department at 352-955-1818 or text keyword GPDFL plus your tip to 274637 (CRIMES). Those who wish to
(10 of 18) remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 352-372-STOP (7867). 		The UFPD firmly believes that crime is never the fault of the
(11 of 18) victim. These general safety tips are provided in an effort to assist members of the UF community. 		If you or someone you know is
(12 of 18) a victim of crime, please contact law enforcement immediately by calling 9-1-1. 		Immediately report any suspicious person or
(13 of 18) activity to law enforcement.		Always be alert and aware of your surroundings. 		Check to see who is at your door before opening it.
(14 of 18) If it is law enforcement, you can request to see a badge and/or department identification prior to opening the door.		If someone
(15 of 18) bothers you, don't be embarrassed to attract attention to yourself. Yell! 		Do not allow anyone to follow you in your residence as
(16 of 18) you enter. 		If you observe any suspicious person or activity, immediately contact law enforcement by calling 9-1-1.		You can
(17 of 18) receive free, confidential services, with or without filing a police report, from the Office of Victim Services, available 24/7 at
(18 of 18) 352-392-1111.

UF officials will continue to closely monitor #HurricaneMichael throughout the night and Wednesday. Please check your email and https://t.co/Ar4eOQlKk4 for updated information.
Unless notified otherwise through UF Alert texts, UF employees should plan to follow their regular work schedules, and students should plan to follow their normal class schedules. Faculty and staff in other UF programs outside of Gainesville should consult their supervisors.
UF administration is aware that the state and Alachua County have declared a state of emergency in Alachua County; however, it is important to note that this declaration is primarily for the purpose of making disaster funds and other resources available should it be necessary.
Based on the most current information from emergency management and weather officials regarding #HurricaneMichael, administrators have determined UF in Gainesville will remain open and all classes, events and clinical activities will continue on a normal operating schedule.

UF officials continue to monitor #HurricaneMichael, but it is important to note that no hurricane watches or warnings have been issued for Alachua County and UF facilities in Gainesville today remain on a normal operating schedule. Next update no later than 3pm.
