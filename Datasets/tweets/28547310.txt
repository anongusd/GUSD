Thank you professor Perry! Today's Twit-lecture great!  RT @MHarrisPerry: This is hugely simplified but it's the general idea. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: But as Left voter u still must go down curve until u find first plausible candidate. Now that is farther Right. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: So, if you are candidate you still have to go get your 50% so instead of crashing middle, you now crash right. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: In this case big hump skewed eithr Right or Left. In US, ovr past 50 yrs we look more like  skewed distribn. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: Ok, But what if the distribution is not a normal curve, but one of these instead. See pic http://bit.ly/mQVz6H #smallleft
RT @MHarrisPerry: Same is true if you are a voter on the Right. You move until you bump into the closest electoral choice. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: If you're voter far to left you must keep traveling along curve til u get to the 1st candidate/ party near you. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: That's right! You have to "crash to the middle" to get 50%. #SmallLeft
RT @MHarrisPerry: Look again at that curve.   http://yfrog.com/hsod9rg Where can you position yourself to get at least 50% ? #SmallLeft

Unfortunately they did find evidence of personal herbal medical choices being made in the privacy of our home as they rooted thru drawers
This is the downside of living in a low crime area. How slow is it to execute a search warrant with 5 cops &gt;city and county&lt; for an Xbox?
Finally took them into town to apt. and exactly where kid said it was. They're still pursuing thieves. No charges on us...yet anyway. Jeez!
Completely cooperative despite outrage &gt;: play the game to win it. Told them Xbox at Dad's apt yet still went searching. 5 cops...5? really?

@YogaSpeak Hahaha! Hula-hoop fitness is big, but was referring to Hula dance from Hawaii. Now THAT really would been something w/that crowd!
@YogaSpeak Why thank you! My work with seniors and pre-schoolers makes me feel like I'm really serving my Higher Power. Namaste'
@YogaSpeak Humor essential for me! Get self-conscious otherwise... Last summer taught Hula to 150 non-dancers. Tech issues. Horrid but funny
@YogaSpeak Have a Sufi sensibility...love the connecting threads between plethora worlds' movement forms: yoga dance chi gung improv gesture
@YogaSpeak Oh, I dance wherever I go :) Love sacred dance/body prayer. Love to teach "non-dancers"-help discover deepest rhythms/free body

@YogaSpeak Ha! me? insulted?... no, no worries! Dance metaphors are some of my favorites, next to sailing and surfing :) dynamics!
@YogaSpeak Thanks... I prefer my  cardio and asana practice separate, so it was really fun. Belly-dance, African & Latin dance pumped hearts
Taught a class this year that combined body-celebrating world-beat dance grooves w/ 45 min section of yoga.. "Fierce Grace" #yogachat
#JustGoodYoga works for me. Loving intention most important element after solid foundation of knowledge. "Stira sukkha asanam" #yogachat
@YogaSpeak Good alignment is pre-requisite. Yet, what that is  correct is different for diff bodies, especially after LIFE (read;:injuries)
@UrbanGirlYoga Yes! Very passionate about that!
@YogaSpeak Yes! He is duly respected Grandfather and pioneer of modern yoga. Sensitive to making demi-gods out of great folks :) #yogachat
I love to teach people how to find their own Truth in movement; to listen to wise healer within. Too many make idols of asanas. #yogachat
@YogaSpeak  And that is why I am not such a big fan of Iyengar Brand yoga - forgot his teachers teaching :) hehe he's human! Bikram so silly

Dog takes over hunt for chipmunk while cat looks on. http://twitpic.com/30hak2
Concerned the chipmunk will go into deep hiding, the critters will get bored and leave the scene, and I'll have a stalemate. Wait -squeeking
or maybe I should just let things work out for themselves. I'll open the front door and give it a chance to escape...
Oh no! Cat just brought in LIVE chipmunk. Cat and dog are chasing it around my living room. Guess I have to get involved! shyte!
