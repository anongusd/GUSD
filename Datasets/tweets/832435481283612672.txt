@PattyMurray @usedgov We deserve answers on why you refuse medical aid to babies who survive an abortion. Letting them die screaming on a table or in a garbage can is inhumane.
@PattyMurray You support #BlackHistoryMonth yet refuse to protect infants who survive an abortion, many of whom are black? @DNC hypocrisy and #racism? How many $$ do you get from #PlannedParenthood? Is it enough for you to allow murdering infants?
@PattyMurray ‚Äî we are not happy with your condoning infanticide.
