#MAADD Mother Against Abuse of th Developmentally Disabled
My mom went to a pre trial hearing in Cambridge Ohio today for my assault case.  She saw Diane Stein the lady that hurt me. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt ever have to see her again.
I‚Äôm happy today in my home.  Today my mom went away for the afternoon and I stayed  here with my sister .  It‚Äôs fun to have her visit me !
Thank you Aunt Deedra for having such a great #christmasparty that even I could enjoy! It was so nice to be included. She even let me pick a movie to take home! i love to carry the cases around with me and memorize the boxes they come in. #bradysvoice @whyImautistic https://t.co/gQvgorh5bq

Brady has a purpose and a voice. I would have never known the disabled didn‚Äôt have the same rights as other Americans unless my son was one of them.  	I plan for Brady‚Äôs challenges to be heard and with exposure comes change.  Please help #BradysVoice @whyImautistic to be heard.
Federal laws protect the rights of people with disabilities, which can include people with learning and attention issues. These laws are the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

My mom went to the state vs Dianna Stein arraignment today in Guernsey County Ohio for me.  Dianna has 12 felony indictments of assault/ patient abuse on me  while I‚Äôve been at a State Hospital. I couldn‚Äôt go. It‚Äôs too hard for me to be quiet and still in a courtroom.
sometimes I like to cut my own hair, it drives my mom crazy and makes me laugh. To bad I can't talk and just let her know that I'd like a fresh Christmas cut! At least I got one after all #bradyvoice @whyImautistic https://t.co/wa69UOhRb7

It's a sad world we live in, a voice to this daily trauma is only the beginning. No family should have to endure the trauma of abuse, it is time for a real change. I am an American and I deserve the same equal treatment as any other citizen. #bradysvoice @whyImautistic https://t.co/clypWPqqoO
@Oprah My fam learned there's an investigation being launched as to where my $7.25 for burger day went, apparently my money isn't the only money missing. My fam feels just as confused as I do. I thought these people are paid to take care of me not to steal from me ü§¨ #bradysvoice

I don‚Äôt understand what moms talking about with my rights. I sure think it‚Äôs funny when she gets excited though! Mom‚Äôs going to ask #MikeDewine to talk with her about my civil rights #MAADüò° #BradysVoice@whyImautistic
@EstiktaConsult According to these Rights, member states have a responsibility to protect all children, with and without disabilities, as well as adults with disabilities, from discrimination and abuse in any form and to ensure that all persons are treated with dignity and respect. üéñ#MADDüò°
@EstiktaConsult Both the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (1975) and its subsequent Convention of the Rights of the Child (1989) were developed to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities.
@EstiktaConsult There wasn‚Äôt any reason why. I‚Äôm no instance was I behaving in any way inappropriate. Even if i was misbehaving, it would have been outrageously wrong to hurt me.  #BradysVoice@whyImautistic

The United States Department of Justice reports that as many as one out of three girls and one out of five boys, will be sexually abused by the time they‚Äôre 18; this rate is even higher among children with disabilities. #BradysVoice@whyImautisticüò≠#MAAD
@StopBadDocs @NitaLowrey @PainPtFightBack @Oprah I HAVE some talents that make me capable of making it known what parents of the developmentally disabled face.  There‚Äôs a LOT of amazing moms - and dads,  with #nonverbalüò∂ #autisic and otherwise #developmentallydisabled children.#BradysVoice@whyImautistic speaks for all of us.
It costs Medicaid a lot of money for my care. It‚Äôs around $175,000 a year for me to stay in a state facility to keep me safe and I was not safe here. Families should be given the choice to have the same $$ to have the care provided at home.  #BradysVoice@whyImautistic

@Right_Smarts That‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs cool to make someone feel good. Your interest in #BradysVoice just made my mom smile. I like when she‚Äôs smiling. Please get #MAAD with her and share my tweets with anyone you can think of with influence to help change for the rights of Developmentally Disabled
@Patri0tiCupcake Over 70 percent of people with disabilities report being victims of abuse. Over 63 percent of family members said their loved one with a disability had been an abuse victim. 62.5 percent of those with developmental  disabilities said they had experienced abuse #BradysVoice
@Patri0tiCupcake Thank you! Prayer is the incense of Heaven! Please put faith in action and write, call, tweet, post to every person of influence you can think of? #BradysVoice is my message that Americas people will not stand for the statistics of abuse the developmentally disabled. #MAAD
@Snowhitemy4b Thank you Snow! #MAAD , Mothers Against Abuse of the Disabled is my mission! Tolerance of this injustice for the most vulnerable of our American family has to be changed! This is what America does! #BradysVoice is the story of the challenges non verbal developmentally disabled.

I‚Äôm in this place and my mom wonders if I‚Äôm sleeping. We spend time on FaceTime every night at 8 pm. I like getting to hear mom talk to me every night. I wish I could tell her what happened to me today. How I got these scratches on my hand and face#BradysVoice
I have scratches on my hand today and one on my face. A nurse reported the injury to my mom. I can‚Äôt tell my mom what happened and no staff reported what happened. My mom gets so upset that I get hurt. #BradysVoice
@frazierpayne Thank you Paula, Disability Rights Ohio has already jumped in this. The criminal part of this is under way. I want something much more important to come out of Bradys story. I want him to get to make a difference.  Lots of voices to be the voice of the non verbal #BradysVoice
I want to be at home everyday with my mom and my brother. There are too many rules that don‚Äôt make sense that prevent my mom from being able to work and have care for me at home. I wish that was different #BradysVoice
Isaac is my little brother. He takes care of me and helps my mom keep me safe and happy when I get to come home on week ends#BradysVoice https://t.co/mxsuf2C1uw
I have a little brother. Isaac is 13. He helps me when I‚Äôm at home. He helps me take a shower so mom won‚Äôt have to. He thinks It gives me dignity to not have my mom help a grown man that needs verbal directions when he‚Äôs naked. I wish everyone else wanted to give me dignity.
My mom and me are learning to use Twitter to help me speak. We‚Äôll get better.  Mom isn‚Äôt tech savvy.  If you are, will you help her?  #BradysVoice
@maudsleyhealth The power will be in the numbers. This is just one case of one abused disabled person that will last 15 minutes on a new cycle: 	One person is a troublemaker. Two people is the troublemaker and their friend. But more than two people gives power to the problem.  #BradysVoice
@maudsleyhealth The bullying is rampant. This isn‚Äôt his first time. Only the first time we can prove it.

Mom told me about what she saw. She said she was mad at Diane for what happened. She was most mad because she was pointing at me in my face and yelling things at me that mom couldn‚Äôt hear. She wants me to tell her what she said to me. I can‚Äôt talk.
Mom saw  the ‚Äúedited version‚Äù of the 30 days of video tapes that document assaults at the hands of my direct therapeutic workers at the state facility I‚Äôm staying at. If I could talk, she would have known the names of all the people that hurt me before today. #BradysVoice
