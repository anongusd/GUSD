What are your concerns about Universal Healthcare? Share them below or on our FB page, and let’s start this conversation. 		What do you support about Universal Healthcare? Let me know that as well, so we can create a system that works for everyone. 	FB: https://t.co/cAEyAedv4m
We are the *only* highly developed country in the *entire world* that does not care for our own citizens. We can afford Universal Health Care. In fact, we cannot afford to continue with our current system.
We live in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, yet it is all too common for a simple medical procedure to send someone into bankruptcy. People are dying because they can’t afford to go to the doctor. Creating a GoFundMe cannot be our safety net.

And I finished my day with the usual: discussing, this time with Senate members, how to get healthcare to more people. 		We plan on starting a new healthcare caucus to dig deeper into this and DO SOMETHING.
Thank you to @LittleSenator for his leadership on these issues and inviting me to carry these bills in the House.
The goal is to keep our labor force strong so our economy remains strong!
The second bill would grant $75,000 to the Lakeville Chamber of Commerce to create a Lakeville Works Internship Program. This would provide opportunities for high school students to get hands on experience and learn useful skills.
Recently, I had a patient tell me that he has been forced to spend $125 to charter a van each time his wife, who is in a wheelchair, needs to make a clinic visit. This is unacceptable. This bill will help undo these type of hardships.

3. Treat an active disease and reduce potential complications. This reactionary step is the worst option. We should always strive to prevent disease vs. treating it. 		Forcing classroom teachers to arm themselves is like stepping in at Step 3. 		We should never even reach Step 3.
2. Catch the disease early and treat it. This is the second best option. Example: Diagnosing early colon cancer by getting regular colonoscopies.
1. Prevent the disease from happening. This is the best level of preventative action. Example: Eating a low sugar diet to prevent diabetes.
Gun violence is a public health epidemic. There are three stages of disease prevention:

Affordable child care shouldn’t be out of reach for anyone. Wages have not kept pace with skyrocketing child care costs. https://t.co/FNHmBba4O9

RT @RepJenSchultz: Republicans invited speaker associated w/ anti-Muslim hate group to Capitol to speak w/ legislators. I won’t be there. T…
I stand with my Muslim neighbors in Lakeville and Burnsville - rhetoric of hate is not welcome here.
I’m saddened that my state representative is bringing a speaker to our state that embodies anti-Muslim sentiments - someone who calls for police in every place of worship of any group is a danger to everyone’s fundamental American freedoms. #mnleg https://t.co/izKbCMAu1A

As we post MLK quotes that still resonate today, let us thank those still fighting for justice, equality, and equity. We must recognize that the playing field is not equal. It is our job as those benefitting from this society to ensure all are afforded the same opportunities. https://t.co/4UGuZeQRZY

“The idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong with the world.” - Paul Farmer 		Everyone in 56B matters.
Immigrants come to this country in search of a better life and you better believe they come ready to work for it. Many come from conditions we can only imagine, but don’t dare to. They endure, they sacrifice, they work and they flourish.
I am an immigrant. I have lived in this country for 29 years. I call this country home.
It is shameful that our president is so ignorant when it comes issues pertaining to immigrants. We are a nation of immigrants. https://t.co/njoLbkXPC1
