Given the courageous protests now taking place inside in Sudan, it would be unconscionable for the @realDonaldTrump Administration to remove Sudan from the State Sponsor of Terrorism list or provide Khartoum with economic support or additional sanctions relief.
(Ghost houses are harsh detention centers where torture is common.) On Friday, #Bashir imposed a year-long state of emergency.
Over the past several weeks, the people of #Sudan have been protesting economic hardship, and an end to Bashir‚Äôs repressive politics. They have been met with excessive violence and mass arrests. Many have been sent to the infamous ghost houses.
For decades, Omar al-Bashir has violated the Sudanese people's basic human rights, supported extremist groups, repressed religious minorities, and stolen his nation's wealth while most of its people live in poverty.	https://t.co/NGwvOcPyiS
