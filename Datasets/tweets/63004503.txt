Big problem with news orgs taking Trump’s rallies live is the many falsehoods that go unchecked. But if he says something newsworthy, as opposed to repetitive attacks. obviously it should be covered. https://t.co/AipkUvvE8i https://t.co/B5e0kvynRf
@jayrosen_nyu There doesn't have to be a debate between "everything trump says/tweets is news" vs. "nothing he says/tweets is news." As with most things, use editorial discretion. Focus on what's interesting and new and try to avoid amplifying falsehoods.
@jayrosen_nyu I think Ezra had a good point. Obviously, don't ignore what Trump says on stage if truly newsworthy. But the umpteenth attack on, say, John McCain is "nothing new" and probably not worth another news story or cable segment.

Sinclair's promos do mention "false news" on social media, but also charge "some media outlets" with publishing "fake stories" and "some members of the media" with pushing "personal bias and agenda." That's why Sinclair's promos, in 2018, have been seen as echoing Trump.
Trump appropriated "fake news" after the election to dismiss critical or unflattering coverage from legit news orgs. And he's used the term throughout his presidency to suggest the public should trust him and not the press.
Some of these @brianstelter clips are from just before the 2016 election, when "fake news" was often used to describe intentionally misleading stories or misinformation. Those spreading "fake news" or bogus stories online and on social media were not seen as legit news outlets.
Sinclair is accusing CNN, and specifically @brianstelter, of hypocrisy in warning about "fake news" in the past, but characterizing Sinclair's recent promos as echoing Trump. But there are things to remember about the shifting definition of "fake news" https://t.co/5uioCtqyPy

And Risen was the lead of Wednesday's Morning Media https://t.co/ufACEpDXOH https://t.co/iWuKaoBSdW
How Wolff describes his sourcing: "Some of my sources spoke to me on so-called deep background, a convention of contemporary political books that allows for a disembodied description of events provided by an unnamed witness to them."
Big Wolff rollout across NBC: He'll appear on Friday's "Today" show, "Meet the Press" on Sunday, and "Morning Joe" on Monday.
For instance, Wolff writes Trump told “a passing New York media acquaintance” that Haberman was a “nut job.” In other instances, Trump is said to consider Haberman “mean and terrible" and “very mean."
Also, Wolff said publicly in April that Trump had personally told him he doesn't like Maggie Haberman https://t.co/NCp6YvXFmb I was thinking of this as several times Trump is quoted in the book criticizing Maggie, though it's not clear to who.
https://t.co/jpmDoRSPR5
There are other moments where it appears Wolff is sitting there with key players, though not said outright. For instance, he runs several direct quotes from Conway and Hicks talking about concerns with the WH Correspondents Dinner before noting a "journalist” is present.
When reading the book, I assumed Wolff was at the “small dinner arranged by mutual friends in a Greenwich Village town house to see Roger Ailes,” though Wolff's presence isn't explicitly stated.
Mike Allen reports now that Wolff taped dozens of hours conversations with officials, and notably, that the lengthy back-and-forth in the book between Bannon and Ailes took place at a dinner Wolff himself hosted at his Manhattan townhouse. https://t.co/pd1yFycYKi

Some context from @CJR post-Charlottesville: https://t.co/WaQ9IOAgRZ https://t.co/YF0IAdxjUC
Morning Media question after weekend "Nazi next door" controversy. Does the NYT need a beat reporter covering white nationalist movements? https://t.co/ZNMvcTN9oz
@stengel Ex-Time Inc EIC @johnwhuey: "It’s difficult to believe the Kochs would pay a premium to buy into the print media model without the hope that they can harness Time and Fortune to further their agenda."
Ex-Time editor @stengel: "It would be naive to think that just because the Koch brothers don't have a seat on the board that they wouldn't wield some kind of editorial influence.”
Meredith says Koch brothers will have "no influence" after Time Inc deal despite putting in $650 million. Koch spox calls investment "passive." Really? https://t.co/ZNMvcTN9oz
Koch spox: "This is a passive financial investment made through Koch Equity Development (KED). Our investment does not include common equity, board or management representation. KED is acting as a capital solutions provider of preferred equity." https://t.co/4vDfLhz17W
