@DelphineTree698 @Lrihendry You can give 100 people guns. Not all will actually shoot them. I suppose stricter gun control is the quick easy answer. Definitely not the best though.Taking sway guns will not take away the fact these young minds have the desire to commit mass violence. Band-aid cure.

@mflynnJR @Lrihendry And by what measure are "strong and loving parents" weighed these days?
@Lrihendry Yes I 1000% agree however it's very important to make sure they are qualified and actually respond to red flags not just cover them up or try to throw kids in the system. Money talks and people won't take the time to care.
And if the price is right the judicial system will help him take you down and keep you quiet. #familycourtcorruption https://t.co/RgwO2pqvLf
@GrizzleMeister Or you can put everyone on parole or probation. That generates revenue. Also why don't they ever mention all the money paid to  oorrupt attorneys in fee's or the foster system,,,non-profits. That's where the big money goes. They reap all the benefits ,ü§îthink harder

@Education4Libs @Lrihendry The latest answer from govt seems to be if your not wealthy it's either jail or foster care then jail. #familycourtreform. The problem is court corruption and a judicial system that operates on money not justice! Wake up people!
@Channel4News Look at divorce rates and the current family court system. Narcissistic abusers and bad parents who can pay for corruption are raising abused kids. Foster care will add money but it won't take the damage away. Money can't fix everything. #familycourtreform	#txcorrupt
