THANK YOU @SenatorShaheen for bringing up the critical importance of having women at the table in negotiations and conflict resolution! We will hold #Pompeo to the commitments made today at the #SFRC Confirmation Hearing
#Pompeo says "stability" when talking about #Syria, we hear "intervention." #StopPompeo
#Pompeo says there are few people like soldiers who value the prevention and resolution of conflict--what about the people on the ground in #Syria and #Yemen?
@SenJeffMerkley refers to #Bolton's statement that a first strike on North Korea is on the table and presses #Pompeo for his view, but once again we're disappointed by an evasive response: he's "with the President"--not much comfort! #DiplomacyWorks #StopPompeo
@ChrisMurphyCT gives #Pompeo chance to revisit his answers to questions about executive authority to go to war, meetings with Trump, and the Special Council's investigation--Pompeo doesn't budge: he won't comment, he can't discuss, he doesn't know. #LiveTweet #StopPompeo
When asked about Trump's constitutional authority to launch military action against Assad, #Pompeo responds he DOES have the authority and its uncontested. @RandPaul replies: that point HAS been contested... by our CONSTITUTION. #StopPompeo
When asked about his views of diversity, #Pompeo says "my record is exquisite." Yikes! https://t.co/03cuxqwxBF https://t.co/4f77z3oKSZ https://t.co/3bscm4TjRx Thank you for challenging Pompeo on this issue, @CoryBooker!
Sen. Isakson asks #Pompeo to "replicate" the environment of the CIA in the State Dept. and Pompeo commits to doing so--but we know that means “more white, more male, more Jesus.” https://t.co/zEwGRMtMbV #StopPompeo
#Pompeo has no clear response to the contradiction of pulling out of the Iran deal while allowing enrichment in Saudi Arabia https://t.co/EKUdDy3HAJ
@EdMarkey asks #Pompeo if he would support #Bolton in a preemptive strike against North Korea; Pompeo leaves it on the table: "There may come the day." The reality is that diplomatic options are never exhausted! #DiplomacyWorks #StopPompeo
Sen Udall recalls importance of #JCPOA, contrasts with Pompeo's previous comments about regime change in Iran and a possible first strike. Thanks for bringing the heat, @SenatorTomUdall! #DiplomacyWorks #StopPompeo
@JeffFlake asks Pompeo how it looks to North Korea is U.S. exits the Iran Deal, Pompeo evades... because he can't promise ruining one diplomatic agreement won't ruin the prospect of another. #StopPompeo
A telling moment in the #SFRC Confirmation Hearing. #StopPompeo https://t.co/54Cy2rIRZE
Sen. Coons requests Pompeo push back if he disagrees with Trump's ideas--but Pompeo has said repeatedly that he will stick to this Administration's "agenda." We don't need a yes-man, we need a defender of human rights and diplomacy. #StopPompeo

@SenatorShaheen presses Pompeo on his history of anti-Muslim and anti-LGBT comments. Pompeo: "Look at my record." We're looking, @RealMikePompeo, and we're holding you accountable. #StopPompeo
Pompeo says he values defending human rights--a direct contradiction of his Islamophobic views and support of "enhanced interrogations." #StopPompeo
Pompeo's views weaken our hand in negotiations and compromise the diplomatic efforts he promises to deliver #StopPompeo https://t.co/h7t3ITFaF2
--but Trump has never shown us a comprehensive plan for engaging in diplomacy. #StopPompeo
Cardin presses Pompeo on regime change in North Korea--Pompeo evades, states he'll stick to "Trump's plan" ...adds later he will "rally the world to the causes that benefit America" #StopPompeo
Sen Ben Cardin asks Pompeo about keeping/pulling out of the Iran Deal, "I can't answer that question." #StopPompeo
Pompeo promising to fill State Dept. vacancies is a scary proposition--we need REAL diplomats who will AVOID war! #DiplomacyWorks #StopPompeo #LiveTweet
"Will you champion our values? Will you champion diplomacy?" asks Sen. Bob Menendez at Secretary of State Confirmation Hearing/ Spoiler alert: HE WON'T.  #stoppompeo #LiveTweet

The clock jumps forward to 2 minutes to midnight, signaling a greater risk to the safety of the human race.  The time has not been this close since 1953. How will you choose to respond?	@BulletinAtomic #disarmthepatriarchy https://t.co/lzsJTjXxDv
Check out @RepRoKhanna's 3 pronged strategy:		(1) A congressional letter to President Trump calling for military-to-military communication 		(2) No First Use of nuclear weapons, unless there is an imminent security threat.		(3) Dialogue with North Korea.		https://t.co/wiipQ2AQjr
Doomsday Clock Announcement tomorrow at 10am EST.		Following the inauguration of President Trump, the time ticked forward half a minute. After a year of escalating tensions with NK and Iran, we are sure to be closer to doom.		Details here: https://t.co/dQJs5JCRHR @BulletinAtomic
