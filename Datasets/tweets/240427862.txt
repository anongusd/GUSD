Finally, H.R. 5628, the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act was also included. The AIDD Act will improve access to drug disposal programs for leftover Rx medicine. A majority of opioid users become addicted with pills from friends and family. This will reduce the availability.
Emmett's Law (H.R. 5695) will educate health professionals about information on substance abuse and overdoses they can share with family members. For the story behind this bill watch this video: https://t.co/g3DMqWgynO
H.R. 6 also includes the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) Act (H.R. 5197) that we introduced with @BillPascrell. The ALTO Act builds on a successful model used in NJ to encourage alternative pain management in the ER, where many patients are first prescribed addictive medicine.
H.R. 6 includes four bills we have championed. First, the POWER Act (H.R. 5176), which we introduced with @USRepMikeDoyle. It will help reduce repeat overdoses by helping patients get connected with treatment options directly following an overdose.
The Senate just passed major bipartisan opioid legislation -- H.R. 6 is now on its way to be signed into law. This is a significant step in the ongoing fight against this epidemic. It will increase access to treatment, improve prevention, and give law enforcement more tools.

We are calling on Twitter, Facebook, and all social media sites to focus their resources towards developing a better system to block the illegal sale of opioids on their platforms. This is simply unacceptable, and it shouldn’t take being called out for these companies to act.
Earlier this year, we highlighted this issue for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and we did so again today with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Once we brought up examples of criminals using Twitter to conduct opioid sales, they immediately banned those users and took down the ads.
Illegal online pharmacies are using social media to circumvent the law and facilitate the purchase of addictive drugs without a prescription. This issue is particularly hard-hitting for WV, where we have the highest opioid overdose rate in the nation.	https://t.co/lR4dv50jOu

WV is  hardest hit by opioid epidemic (52 deaths per 100,000). DEA needs to shift resources back into state to help combat this crisis. Recently, they placed a tactical diversion squad in Clarksburg, but that is only the second DEA unit in the state. More resources are needed.
Fast forward to today, and we have continuously allowed the production of dangerous opioid pills to increase…didn’t the DEA learn anything from our successes in the past? The data should have raised red flags, yet they kept increasing quotas. Enough is enough.
Back in the seventies when America was facing a major problem with amphetamines, the DEA stepped up and instituted quotas, cutting production by 90%, and the problem went away. In the eighties, they did the same thing when Quaaludes became a problem. https://t.co/4kHIzRCRYo

It is now time for the Senate to take action and ensure the nearly 9 million children who use CHIP can have certainty. Inaction isn’t an option. It is time to paint or get off the ladder.
But when none were offered, the House passed CHIP. GOP gave every opportunity for good-faith bipartisan negotiations to take place. WVhas over 21,000 children who depend on this program for their healthcare, and these families needed the peace of mind that this program provides.
This is now the third time House Republicans have passed CHIP. Funding for CHIP had been delayed upon the requests of the Democrats in order to propose amendments or modifications. https://t.co/EeGu1YaFGZ
If Democrats don’t get on board with the reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), this might become a reality for the nine million children who depend on it

#TaxReform will boost the middle class and allow all Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. Our seniors deserve to see the same benefit, which is why we’re asking the Administration to ensure seniors have the resources needed to take advantage of these savings.
With the tax cuts, seniors could potentially see more money in their monthly checks. This letter asks the Administration to inform all recipients of social security that they may want to adjust their withholding in order to benefit from the tax reform.
This week I led a letter to the Social Security Administration asking them to notify all seniors of the changes resulting from the Tax Reform and Jobs Act being signed into law.

Come February when the tax cuts kick in, you will see that there were no changes to social security, no changes to Medicaid or Medicare, and people will reap the benefits of these historic tax cuts as they get to keep more of their hard-earned money.
It's truly sad to see the lack of civility in our nation's political discourse, and even sadder to see so many on the opposite side wanting our President and country to fail. Let's put the charged rhetoric aside and enjoy this Christmas season with our loved ones and friends.

The Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act has PASSED! Here’s how it will help your family:	✔ Lowers tax rates	✔ Increases the standard deduction	✔ Eliminates special-interest deductions	✔ Preserves the Adoption credit	✔ Repeals the Death Tax
We must make the tax code simpler &amp; fairer. This bill removes special interest loopholes, reduces rates, &amp; makes it so that most can file taxes on a postcard. It will also increase America’s competitiveness on the world stage, &amp; open the door for private sector job creation. https://t.co/mVpwHOCjmg

Rather than using tragedies to divide us and provide cover for executive overreach, the Pres should focus on making us more secure #2A

@bitmapped @coweaver Those setting rules shld b responsible to parents. Local officials more accountable than DC bureaucrats.
@coweaver @bitmapped #CommonCore coercion empowers federal bureaucrats in Washington, not parents, who know best for their kids
@ByrdsHead That's true. Obama has used "waivers" of failed NCLB to force federal regs on local school boards though, &amp; not help to rewrite
Families and teachers tell us "teaching to the test" is hurting education -- #StudentSuccessAct moves us beyond that &amp; focuses on kids
Status quo for education isn't working. To stop #CommonCore &amp; empower parents we need to pass new legislation and update education bill
We have 1-in-5 high schoolers dropping out, 37% not proficient in math -- We need to act to change our education system #StudentSuccessAct
#StudentSuccessAct pushes back on Obama Admin to restore power to local school boards -- Voting against would have endorsed status quo

According to IRS records, federal workers owe the government about $2.5 billion in outstanding taxes. #TaxDay2015 We need accountability.
@bitmapped I'm a big proponent http://t.co/VlLpW9aih6 but EPA plan is not just e-e, it kills jobs, makes grid unreliable, increases costs
You know what needs work? The IRS. We're stepping in. http://t.co/VdfBX8RVHg

I co-sponsored an efficiency bill with @PeterWelch, @ReganWV - I know the benefits http://t.co/VlLpW8SHpy https://t.co/mif9tm2DRg
@_DanMangan @AnthonyAdragna nrg-effic is common sense http://t.co/VlLpW8SHpy but increasing costs &amp; claiming "bills" go down = delusional
Gov't takeover of power grid will increase costs. Ppl will then use less. For @EPA to call that "good" is delusional https://t.co/jUcyQ9y4j1
By driving up energy costs, @EPA will MAKE Americans "efficient" just so they can heat homes, not by choice. https://t.co/a0paShGolM
.@EPA insists energy "bills" will go down - not cost of energy. Why insistence on "bills" &amp; not "costs" or "rates"? https://t.co/jUcyQ9y4j1

.@emorwee Is @EPA just interested in an energy efficiency bill? We've got that http://t.co/VlLpW8SHpy These regs are much more, wider dmg
.@emorwee Sounds like a bad time to increase costs of production and make energy prices higher for American families then.

But @EPA insists on shutting down coal plants, threatening our electric grid, and pushing jobs oversees. How does that make sense?
From UN: 96% of CO2 is naturally occurring - man responsible for only 4%. And if you shut down ALL world's coal plants, reduce #GHG .002
