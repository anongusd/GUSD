If untreated, this can lead to permanent organ damage or death.
When a person is in shock, his or her organs aren't getting enough blood or oxygen.
Shock may result from trauma, heatstroke, blood loss, an allergic reaction, severe infection, poisoning, severe burns or other causes.
Inadequate fluid intake often contributes to heat cramps.
The spasms may be more intense, more prolonged than are typical nighttime leg cramps.
Heat cramps are painful, involuntary muscle spasms that usually occur during heavy exercise in hot environments.
Many people who experience a heart attack have warning signs hours, days or weeks in advance.
A heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes, but it can also have no symptoms at all.
