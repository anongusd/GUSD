6) This should stand as a warning to the World, there are consequences for breaking the law and entering America illegally.
5) Families can be reunited at the conclusion of their legal case.
4) The media are invited to responsibly tour/review the childcare accommodations.
3) Children will be cared for separate from their parent’s detention center, but to high, humane and compassionate standard.
2) While adult illegal immigrants have broken the law and will be charged, a prison is no place for a child.
Here’s what the White House should have explained last week:		1) We have ended Obama’s “catch and release” policy, so illegal immigrants detained at the border will NOT be released into general population pending trial.
@elpunoFL They don’t need to explain for your benefit, they need to explain for the average voter. You’re better informed than most.
@elpunoFL Yea, I know. My entire point is that the White House needs to EXPLAIN THIS!
This is EXACTLY what I want to hear the White House saying. 👇 https://t.co/rFkir9Kt9b
