@Copperr1 @NBCPolitics Assuming facts without any evidence?  Do you work for Buzzfeed or MSNBC?
@chris_damyen @NBCPolitics Getting in someone‚Äôs face like that is absolutely provocation.  Thankfully, the teenager had self restraint to not respond.  You do not have the right to impede someone else‚Äôs ability to move.  This is a political rally.  This isn‚Äôt the NFL.
@bennyjohnson See this video: @chris_damyen
@chris_damyen @NBCPolitics Phillips is staying that he was ‚Äúsurrounded by these kids‚Äù, however, the video clearly shows he purposefully walked over to the kids, and beat his drum within inches of their face.  He is the instigator.
@chris_damyen @NBCPolitics What did the kids do?  Hangout on the stairs and watched a much older man approach them, beat a drum within inches of their face, and the kids didn‚Äôt retaliate at all and didn‚Äôt get violent?  The kids did great not to retaliate to Phillips‚Äô instigation.

@strixspines @CNNSotu @NYCMayor Agreed it needs to be accessible.  Free markets allows business to compete and drives down costs of health insurance.

@strixspines @CNNSotu @NYCMayor Healthcare is not a basic human right.  Healthcare is provided by highly paid and skilled doctors, who are paid for their services. Check the US Bill of Rights.  The word ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù is never mentioned.
@pwbnyc @strixspines @CNNSotu @NYCMayor Government controlling any consumer good is a bad idea.  The US Constitution does not grant permission for the federal government to control healthcare or health insurance in the USA.  Therefore, let States and private citizens control their own healthcare and health insurance.
