Thanks @stacylf9 &amp; all for a great #EdShift chat!
A10: Listen to every part of student body, understand that you may not understand a student's experiences, report fairly #EdShift
After #TheRealUW, @BadgerHerald dedicated issue to giving students platform to tell their campus experience #EdShift https://t.co/3bg7N4i5qk
A8: Use social media to LISTEN to what peers have to say about their campus experiences, get viewpoints you wouldn’t hear otherwise #EdShift
Big issue w/ campuses that lack diversity is minority students are expected to speak for entire community, don’t make same mistake  #EdShift
A6: Don’t always use the same source when reporting on an underrepresented community. Make sure to get a variety of viewpoints #EdShift
A6: Would go back to A3, but add - have regular convos, not just when you have a story to write #EdShift  https://t.co/U6A6ZsVbUU
A5: Emphasize human interest stories, amplify voices not heard enough #EdShift
A5: This is something I struggled w/ personally, and still don’t know the answer to #EdShift
A3: This is a way to build relationships/develop trust in communities that traditionally don’t trust media. Listening is important! #EdShift
A3: Have convos w/ historically underrepresented communities, what issues are important to them? What do they want to read about? #EdShift
A1: Never let the conversation die. Report on diversity plans/proposals, revisit the plans, reflect on the plans. #EdShift
