Note too that the people who are most invested in discrediting the Russia investigation are coincidentally the least likely to be harmed by the implementation of the worldview of people like Peter Theil, Robert Mercer, Erik Prince, and Steve Bannon.
Long story short - leftist ‚Äúanti-imperialists‚Äù have decided that it‚Äôs more important to defend Putin and Trump and will get people killed as well as legitimize the transnational racist authoritarian nightmare that Putin and the mafia Russian state are trying to build in the west.
The US doesn‚Äôt go to war with nations that have nuclear weapons because those nations are harder to bully. Hence why we plan to attack Venezuela and Iran but dialogue with Russia and North Korea.
It‚Äôs an assertion with literally no proof. DC think tankers and defense hawks occasionally flirt with the idea, but there‚Äôs a reason that most think tank proposals are not taken seriously by actual policy makers. It also distracts from this admin‚Äôs actual rush to attack Iran.
The idea that the Mueller investigation is a setup for war with Russia is the worst, most cynical view here-ahistorical propaganda meant to sow doubt, promoted both by journalists with potential legal exposure in the Russia investigations as well as Russia-sympathetic media.
It‚Äôs important to call out the government for abuses and anti-democratic actions around the world. But the FBI, the IC, and the Mueller team/SDNY etc. are actually doing the right thing and investigating the right shit here.
Yes, the US has interfered in elections. It still is today. That doesn‚Äôt mean that Russia and US GOP should be given a free pass for destroying what semblance of free elections exists in the US. Or do you only care about voter suppression when you can fundraise off of it?
It‚Äôs frightening that instead of recognizing the necessity of a temporary alliance with the center and center-right on the Mueller investigation and white collar crime that led to this, many US leftists would rather defend Putin using Trump‚Äôs arguments. It‚Äôs sickening.
I mean, the Russian state and the Russian mafia are fully intertwined at this point, and extreme right wingers/authoritarians/neofascists are being united into a globalized movement under Putin‚Äôs leadership in collaboration with US and European right wing leaders.
There is a long history of left-wing opposition to organized crime, especially amongst Socialists/Communists. Yes, there are people who fetishize military and law enforcement who also support the Russia investigation. That doesn‚Äôt make the investigation wrong.
No limits to the violent cruelty of this administration. They want more people to die. I‚Äôm sure that the Trump/GOP connections to organized crime have nothing to do with this at all. https://t.co/dIWWwfFjtq

same shit as always - this is why it was so important for her to hold the line on the shutdown and the SOTU, they'd try to make her irrelevant otherwise, while demanding that she clean up their messes and give them the credit for fixing things. https://t.co/CkSmYfqctY
To be fair, a lot of it is willful and knowing ignorance though. https://t.co/ON5AHUIrxO

One of the most baffling things around the coverage of the Senate votes today. Why are reporters and pundits working as stenographers for R Sens pandering to GOP base instead of the fact that GOP whipped against the bill that GOP passed in Dec - simply to prolong the shutdown? https://t.co/tRCbYs34PG
A very good point, and I noticed at least one amendment in the rules committee that points to where this could go. However, the exit from the bubble will be slowed down if the media doesn't hold GOP accountable for being more upset about the SOTU cancel than unpaid fed workers. https://t.co/EldWmE8hFe
Leon Fresco is a national treasure, and this is why - though you'll probably have to have steel cage matches between ICE and OIL attorneys before they'll even consider integrating. ü§£ü§£ https://t.co/ln0Tn7a2OF
First sign that Donald isn't shielding Congressional Republicans from shutdown blame anymore. There will be more like this, even if/when the shutdown ends. https://t.co/piheOlKsB6
Pretty much the real SOTU. https://t.co/0St1llTtq9

And now the administration declares war on TSA workers for not being able to afford to come to work when they are not being paid https://t.co/SG7itgzxkG
This is the next major domino to fall re: the shutdown. Trump and the Congressional GOP are putting people in danger - bashing fed workers is a VERY popular Republican campaign tactic - yet the media will still claim that both sides are to blame. https://t.co/HBedZCrfAz
YAY WITNESS TAMPERING IS SO AWESOME! https://t.co/KUgXH5l57I
Agreed. 00's US covert actions set the table for this situation. Sanctions made it worse. https://t.co/1hLl0JU5kn
I hate being affected directly by the shutdown (my spouse is our only income rn and is working 60 hours/wk w/ no pay but I want them to hold the line on this so this shit doesn't happen again. https://t.co/826aSaR34n
Reiterating this point because the shutdown will not end until Congressional GOP understands this, whether or not the administration does. https://t.co/ma5aWDowhA
It's so awesome to have a President with organized crime connections, such a "disruption" - us educated folk are really learning our lesson. https://t.co/JkKqIaNuAG
Remember when some leftists claimed that Donald would be less of an imperialist than HRC? He also launched more drone strikes in ONE YEAR than Obama's entire presidency - however the antiwar cult will still mob ppl about drone strikes anytime someone praises BHO publically.
I remember when a bunch of "anti-imperialists" told me that Donald would be the candidate of peace and anti-imperialism. Wonder what happened. https://t.co/dvZqzvkDIx
Still the core truth at the center of this dispute. Opening the government is not a concession. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/ycYYIegT6t
So true. There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the win from the start. He‚Äôs never gotten near 50% in approval. He‚Äôs always been overrated, but his approve/disapprove is now hardening - it seems like 2018 was a warning, but the shutdown is the last straw for many. https://t.co/lQHcbV4Jyj

@owillis I saw that live and took it as making fun of him/sarcasm, fwiw.
@MEPFuller Isn't being for it, then against, then for it again pretty much what brought us to this point? They're pretty much in alignment with the Trump Doctrine now.
@JRubinBlogger They're like family members. He looks adorable. I'm so sorry.
@RepCummings My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
@ChrisVanHollen My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
@RepEscobar My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
It's terrifying that this happened on US soil with zero accountability. What's not surprising is that the "OMG losing our sovereignty" nationalist types have no problem letting autocrats run roughshod over our laws, as long as it's the autocrats they like. https://t.co/YKma4QIo60
Same story - word for word - as me. They only get worse. https://t.co/Df3jkIYTUN
@jbview It kneecaps daca/tps and hollows out asylum protections. The whole thing is a poison pill.
By claiming that this is the only bill that can be considered in the Senate, McConnell owns this bill, and is now a de facto Stephen Miller collaborator. https://t.co/8A4ds1hKVn
32 days of a shutdown and not one reporter (demanding that Dems give DJT his wall in return for opening the govt plus a D priority) can explain how this would create less uncertainty for fed workers instead of more. If Ds give in, what removes R incentive to do it again?
Co-signing - I cant agree enough with this sentiment. https://t.co/FXVCdJc3bp
The media will continue to treat him as credible, though, and responsibly blame both sides when one is so clearly full of shit. https://t.co/JAWyjhkMyS
Agreed. This is just fantastic. https://t.co/QdrLoABlDC
Shocker, McConnell lied. Also, today is Tuesday. https://t.co/HUbzhHRBiz
@StevenTDennis All the ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt Dems negotiate?‚Äù takes completely ignore this reality, and also ignore that the same dynamic applies no matter how long the shutdown goes on. Why is ‚Äúno negotiations when the government is closed‚Äù the unreasonable position in your analysis?
@StevenTDennis If Schumer made a wall deal, what would stop GOP from prolonging the shutdown or causing another shutdown in the future to secure other unpopular policies like say a wholesale destruction of asylum protections? What is the limiting principle if Dems give in to hostage taking?
Thread, but BLUF is that this bill destroys asylum law in the US. https://t.co/xiaoHQd9Uq
@AmandaMarcotte Also gutting the asylum system, especially for unaccompanied minors, doesn‚Äôt lend itself to a bipartisan deal. They literally snuck in systemic destruction of asylum under the guise of a daca deal. Also they lied about the TPS extension.
Can‚Äôt emphasize this enough. Especially as someone affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/ahLjzjWhj4
Reiterating a point I made earlier. Completely agree. https://t.co/O80AOLNyn6
So glad that the new members of Congress aren‚Äôt letting themselves get played by sanctimonious concern trolling by conservative media. This is a wonderful change from years past. https://t.co/RBxjqBZ5Ag

Remember that joke about Glenn Beck‚Äôs activities in 1990? The media still hasn‚Äôt paid attention to the lesson of that joke, and they are still making the same mistakes. https://t.co/u8VAv5JP0i
Agreed. https://t.co/cimqQJxM12
@TheToddSchulte @TomJawetz Got ahead of myself. 1293 is the page number - end of Section 106. Still subsection (F).
1293 is the page number - end of section 106
Currently asylum applications are confidential by regulation. This provision changes that bigly by allowing the government to disclose asylum applications and docs submitted - bc this administration wants to break the asylum system by any means necessary. https://t.co/1GaTrOb3Fs
I hope @DLind (and others reporting on this) noticed this because the disclosure requirements for asylum applications will put people at risk in a way that has been unappreciated in the commentary on the ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù between Miller and Kushner... https://t.co/vPqJT7WvWF
@TheToddSchulte @TomJawetz There is stuff in this bill that is creating new dangers for asylum applicants. 1293(F) is going to put people in danger through disclosure requirements. Media hasn‚Äôt caught this yet.
I usually fall off of the rail entirely. üòπüòπüòπüòπ https://t.co/smowONntZF
Totally agree - anyone who paid attention to the previous poison pills in the failed "DACA for wall" proposals before now knew where this was going. Miller strikes again, but this whole admin thinks they are the smartest, most clever people ever. https://t.co/nABbnjAyTk
It's amazing to see history being made in real time. https://t.co/fPrz6vMLb3
