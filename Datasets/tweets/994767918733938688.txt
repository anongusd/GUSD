@bookgaslighting I'm an empath too. I plan on reading your book once I get done with the few books I currently have on my reading list. So many people ask me to read things. I will get to it!
#HealthyFaith A9: No. Even if someone felt hopeless and had no idea that there was a God, there would still be one. https://t.co/0yz11Sojbo
#HealthyFaith A8: Some of us have lived multiple lifetimes and have already been through this nonsense before? (Disclosure 1: I believe there is a God Disclosure 2: I feel these questions deserve nonsense answers tonight.) https://t.co/g52j9VOF5b
#HealthyFaith A7: There is a natural balance to things. That's intentional. It's not just luck. When things are wrong, you can feel it. People really need to pay attention to that. You just know. I believe that God gives us that sense. https://t.co/ZJYcMB7eMQ
#HealthyFaith A6: Maybe we evolved and there hasn't been an asteroid large enough to wipe us out yet. Just pure luck basically. I don't like these questions today. I believe there is a God so it's weird answering as if there wasn't. https://t.co/EAJRk4XA89
#HealthyFaith A5: I know of many books that give alternative solutions. I am not saying that they are better obviously. I just have read many alternative beliefs because I find it fascinating. https://t.co/xb1yFmImYE
#HealthyFaith A4: I would assume evolution? So Science? (Answering a question with questions....) https://t.co/gfxETJW6ou
#HealthyFaith A3: They would probably say that you are worthy of those rights because you are human. Many people who do not believe in God still believe in humanity, kindness, love, etc. They would base it upon their faith in those things instead. https://t.co/SkzpRlD2bb
#HealthyFaith A2: I agree. Everyone has certain rights and the only way to know what they are is to discover them. There are God given rights, human rights, and government granted rights etc. Not created but need to be upheld. https://t.co/ayNdebnpcr
#HealthyFaith A1: I imagine based on unrealistic health and beauty standards set by the media that the majority would make everyone look perfect and be healthy. They would not give us free will and people would be without compassion. I prefer God's creation. https://t.co/VzhOafpBEf

The statement alone is offensive to all of us who have suffered through an abusive marriage and divorce. But in the context we believe it was intended, in response to the article she wrote, then yes, we agree with her that divorce is the solution (not murder.)
Divorce is better than murder. People had been trying to defend someone who murdered their abuser. She never said it's easy or safe to go through a divorce from an abuser. It's not. Be careful about defending murderers. There is NEVER a good reason for murder. Don't let Hate win! https://t.co/uDnXuIfBZK

@GillEK04 @NoneinThree @Dontlookback198 @EVAWuk @UN_Women @DrDomWillmott This is awesome! I often see the phone numbers for the local DV shelters in the bathrooms at the doctors offices and other places but this is even better because this gives an opportunity for them to get help immediately and not have to endanger themselves more by calling.
@IkegwuonuChidi3 @dviolenceuk @NYCagainstabuse @btsadv @PWDVA @NGYouthSDGs @benmurraybruce @TonyElumeluFDN @TONTOLET Care needs to be taken which is why we are fighting for changes in the way DV is handled. It's usually reactive instead of proactive. Statistics show that if one parent abuses another that the children will eventually get abused too. More needs to be done to protect the children.

@KISS985BUFFALO @jonasbrothers @GregOnRadio Awwww yeah! Gotta love the @jonasbrothers
@ArtistsUnited1 @ExportedFromMI Yes, I understand. Most of my family are Trumpsters too. Remember self care when you have to deal with them. It's painful to see people we once respected so highly stand behind someone so vile. You will find your tribe. Accepting like-minded friends become our family as we grow.
@bookgaslighting I already did. Can I have my $150,000 now? ;)
@ExportedFromMI Holding onto hate is never good for your personal wellbeing. It's a heavy burden. The problem here though is that Trump supporters are knowingly allowing what Trump does to continue. It was one thing perhaps to wait and see what he would do but to still support him is inexcusable

Thank you @NCJFCJ for the discussion today. You asked great questions about #TeenViolence #TeenDatingViolenceAwarenessMonth #teenDVMonth #TDVAM
@NCJFCJ A10: https://t.co/GyfrqTaAuD https://t.co/PYPw0AEozY
@NCJFCJ A9: We are working on a bystander training that teaches about trauma and trauma informed help for regular people. The professionals have this training but most average people such as family and friends do not understand things like triggers. Always believe and always listen.
@NCJFCJ A8: They need to take each case seriously and understand how teens react to violence and how it effects them. They need to hire adequate amount of staff which includes court advocates who are well versed in a trauma informed approach.
@NCJFCJ A7: They need to know that they are valued and can do better. They need to be educated on the long term effects of their actions and taught about self love. Oftentimes those who hurt others are hurting themselves.
@NCJFCJ A6: They need to have an understanding of it and the impact in order to serve those in need properly
@NCJFCJ A5: It can be overwhelming because it's almost inescapable. You can be reached anywhere at any time via social media.
@NCJFCJ A4: We highly recommend the YWCA. They are so helpful and teach classes at schools about consent and healthy relationships.
@NCJFCJ A3: Many people get distracted because of it and their grades drop. They get depressed and stop doing things they enjoy. It ruins their experience.
@NCJFCJ A2: People are often unaware of how common it is. That was the response we have been getting all month as we have been focusing on raising awareness.
@NCJFCJ A1: Violence damages them. Those who experience it may end up violent themselves. It leaves a lifelong impact on mental and emotional wellbeing. Very often there is depression, ptsd, and anxiety along with chronic illnesses that can develop also.

@helensmomma They actually saved my life. My regular OBGYN missed it, said I would be fine. I wasn't getting better so I went to Planned Parenthood. If I hadn't, I could have died. I had a very bad infection that could have spread to other organs if I wouldn't have gotten their 2nd opinion.

@Alyssa_Milano Exactly! I've been arguing with people about this all day!
"Conditional" meaning funds can only be used for life saving, treatment of illness, or preventative care. That's a better compromise than completely De-funding.
So here's my argument...if it was really about preventing abortions wouldn't they still fund the life saving things done at planned parenthood?  Meet in the middle with conditional funding. Poor communities need health clinics. https://t.co/j5hiJ7KNPs
@Change @amazon I doubt Amazon "promotes" everything they sell. I remember searching for stuff about it before I knew what it was. We don't treat people like that where I'm from. Some people buy controversial books to understand things. Not necessarily promoting it by being educated about it.

#HealthyFaith A8 Well, I'm an ordained minister so I learned a lot of it in my seminary studies. Sometimes though I will google other perspectives and see what language scholars and historians have to say about these things. https://t.co/i8uzHbPDqT
@rossamoore Awww yeah! I love going to Shakespeare in the Park in Buffalo, NY. It's wonderful. I love that stuff!
#HealthyFaith A7 I believe Jesus is who He said He was. As far as the bible and other religious books in general, they are the written history of the belief of a people. So we can trust that much. Jesus was real historically and the rest is faith and the Holy Spirit. https://t.co/NUkjzHmlR9
I don't mind the old translations. To me it's classic. I studied Latin. I like that stuff but I understand the need to make the Bible as easy to understand as possible for all people. #HealthyFaith
#HealthyFaith A6. Absolutely. It's a form of Evangelization to make the bible as accessible as possible to as many as possible. Thy and Thou instead of Your and You does not change the context of the message. I'm a Shakespeare fan so I would not change the wording but I get it. https://t.co/t1HYIYWako

@rossamoore yeah, my favorite hymn I would often sing at weddings and such was based on that chapter "Set Your Heart on the Higher Gifts."
#HealthyFaith A5. It's NOT a good idea. You have to have some kind of guidance. There has to be rules and a higher power to keep people in line. Every structured anything has structure or it's a hot mess. People are the same. https://t.co/aNPaqcv35j
@RachaelColby7 Context is King. That says it all right there. Simply put but right on! Awww yeah!
#HealthyFaith A.4 It means that it's going the opposite way.  That's fine if it's going good and the culture is going bad.  I don't think it is though. People are fighting for justice and human rights more than ever before. Justice, Kindness, and Love. And the Greatest is LOVE https://t.co/vbMCD3ltwj
*full of not just full
#HealthyFaith A3. With very few exceptions the bible is full horrible ways to look at and treat women. Jesus did not treat women the way the bible says to. Many churches use the bad parts of the bible to marginalize women and make excuses for abuse. https://t.co/7SnoQ4yqnD
#HealthyFaith A2. Parts of the Bible are literal in the sense of the history of a belief of a people. Did Moses run up and down the mountain like it's implied? Probably not. He had a staff because it was a journey up the mountain. The point is in the lesson not the storytelling. https://t.co/KUULok2sLP

@bookgaslighting I understand. I just know that there is a ripple effect to having someone lose their job. They might have a family. Someone did the same thing to someone I know and they lost their job as they were expecting their 2nd child. Just something to consider.
@bookgaslighting I understand how badly you want to do that but what will it solve? They will lose their job? Revenge is not justice. Take the high road on this one. I really do understand. I can take down an entire company that if I want to out of revenge but I have chosen not to. Peace instead.

@CSLCHSnMore Some people don't like his style. I do though. I didn't call him anything. I actually watch his show.
@JATuckerEsq @CSLCHSnMore I'm an ordained minister. I just like his style of teaching how to take personal steps to fix your life. That's all. I think there is a benefit to hearing things like that to start taking positive steps to fixing messes in your life.
@JATuckerEsq @CSLCHSnMore Aww, I like watching Andy Stanley's show. He puts things in an action perspective so people can apply what they learn to their life. I like his style. He can reach a different audience his way which in my opinion is important.
@CSLCHSnMore A lot of the Bible especially the Old Testament is about the history of the beliefs of the Jewish people. If someone was just given a New Testament Bible and went on that they could still be an incredible Christian. Being Christian is about following Jesus and His teachings.
We need #FamilyCourtReform Does anyone know of any legislation that is trying to be passed for this? If not, who wants to help us put something together for the powers that be? #SeriouslySerious We don't like it so we have to change it. Let's make it happen!

@frfrankpavone To be clear I was not dissing the movement. I personally support saving all life. I was calling out the nonsense of the MAGA hat that represents President Trump. Aside from being pro-birth, most of what he stands for is not pro-life or Christian.
@frfrankpavone @realDonaldTrump I don't think it's that. There is just more to being pro-life than just being pro-birth. You should really be both especially if one is a Christian. A lot of the stuff the President stands for besides being pro-birth is not really pro-life or Christian.

@FTDbook @helensmomma Absolutely. Anti-bullying efforts seem to be common in schools now but consent and other forms of abuse are not yet. I think these kinds of things should be a part of the core curriculum.
@helensmomma @FTDbook The YWCA goes to schools to teach these things. I think the schools need to request them though.
@helensmomma @FTDbook Right. One of the main issues with the way things are is that things are always reactive instead of proactive. For example even though statistics show that when the mother gets abused eventually so will the children; nobody helped me protect my children Until he hurt them 😞
@AndrewPThompso1 @FTDbook Ok.
@AndrewPThompso1 @FTDbook I'm going to start collecting information from male survivors about their experience then we can share what we learn with the police departments so they can do better.

@rossamoore Thank you :)
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith Because Jesus said so and He doesn't lie. ;) We just have to trust Him. That's the hard part when things get all crazy; but it's so worth it because Jesus never leaves us.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith "You are going to the wrong church, pal." Some churches indoctrinate instead of explain/teach. One of God's greatest gifts to us is free will. The choices are ours to make. Faith in itself is a choice. You can be given facts and still choose not to believe.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith Relationships are a 2 way street so it's important that we make that time for God, pray, go to church, live the beatitudes, etc. Relationships have requirements. Sometimes it's not easy but it's necessary to have a healthy relationship otherwise you have a hot mess.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith Sometimes even the bad stuff that happens prepares us for the good God wants us to do so I will say No. Its important to have boundaries and practice self care. A few weeks ago, I cancelled all appointments and cleared my calendar. I needed a break and that was ok.
@SMVigil @rossamoore Exactly. My favorite bible quote and the mantra for my other ministry is Psalm 37:5 "Commit your way to the Lord, Trust Him, and He will Help You."
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith As people of faith it is important to keep our faith in Jesus and ask the Holy Spirit for Guidance always. Years ago I was told that discernment was not just about your career path or college choice, it's the everyday things and it's important to include God in it.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith I believe that your liberty is your ability to choose. After leaving my abuser I finally felt free because I no longer had someone telling me what to do and what to think anymore.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith I think it's been helpful to have at least one rule. Boundaries are so important. Things get chaotic without them. Job requirements are a great example. You need qualified individuals in order to be successful.
@rossamoore #HealthyFaith Your freedom is not limited because you are still choosing how to spend your time. (Your skill might still be limited but that's another story ;) )

@FTDbook Oh I know. So many times calling the police made matters even worse for me and many others. They either don't understand or dont care. More training programs are needed for handling police.
@FTDbook Not all abuse is visible and happens behind closed doors. 1 in 6 men deals with intimate partner violence but rarely speak up. There is a stigma where they think it makes them look weak. A lot needs to change.
Be kind to everyone and stand up against injustice. MLK started this journey towards peace and unity. The best way to honor his memory is to continue to fight for what is right. #MLKDay
People who abuse follow patterns and each time the cycle goes quicker and gets worse. They stalk and/or manipulate and control long before that first physical impact. Know what to look for and get help before it gets worse. You can do it.
When someone blames you for their poor choices and actions; You are in an #AbusiveRelationship Just because someone doesn't hit you doesn't mean you are not being abused. When they control who you talk to, where you go, and/or control the money; it's still #DomesticViolence
#FinancialAbuse When you cannot afford anything for yourself because you are paying all the bills for him; You are in an #AbusiveRelationship #DomesticViolence

"Fair chance" means supporting funding for crisis pregnancy centers, daycare, paid maternity/paternity leave, affordable healthcare, social welfare programs, affordable education, etc. Not judging life/choice stance here, just calling bs on the Penses.
The Penses need to get it together. Being pro-birth is one thing. Being pro-life is another. You can be supportive of giving babies a fair chance at life. That's noble of you but don't be for all the other terrible things then and say you are pro-life Because you are not. https://t.co/cwxdrGBp9V

This needs to be said...Please consider donating to your local food pantries and domestic violence shelters during this government shutdown instead of donating to the Catholic Church that has been hiding abuse for decades and continues to do so. #TrumpShutdown #OpenTheGovernment
@mdnorris1962 We have been saying that all donations should be held until there is some accountability within the Church. There are many other organizations that could use funding right now with the government shutdown; domestic violence shelters specifically and food pantries, etc.

@rickybarnhill33 @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump People in power get away with hurting others. There wasn't a trial so no burden of anything except the victim blaming she suffers. Dr Ford gave her testimony to be considered since she felt it was her civic duty to do so. That's it and we believe her because we've been there.

@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith Live in the present moment. Too many regrets from the past. Too much fear for the future. Gotta Trust in Jesus better.
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith There are moments where we get distracted and have to try harder. Anger at injustice does it for me. On a mission to help others and sometimes discussions can get a little heated. Working on that. Gotta always magnify Jesus in all we do.
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith He's talking about helping one another and standing up for what is right. Being a Christian is about doing what Jesus did. He helped people and we should too. We are all blest with various talents and abilities. It's our job to use them for goodness.
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith Our choices, primarily when we choose to continue to have faith. There are many things that can make us doubt or feel like choosing otherwise. It's so important to always choose to have faith. Keeping faith and trusting in Jesus saved my life.
@SMVigil @CSLCHSnMore YES!!!!
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith To me the clue is to stay connected to the vine. Stay close to Jesus and live in a way that shows that you are a part of his crew.
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith To me where you abide is where you live. So when we live in Jesus, we are living like it. I always think of the beatitudes as a great guideline of how we should be and how we need to treat one another.
@CSLCHSnMore #HealthyFaith We need to stay connected to the Vine (Jesus) in order to survive and since we are a part of Him, we need to live like Him.

Part 2 of 3. We all ignored the warning signs and defended the abuser at one point or another. At some point though we accepted that what we hoped for was not the reality we were dealing with and decided to change that by leaving...
Part 1 of 3. If you are in an abusive relationship, you need to stop looking at what you had hoped for and see things for what they are. We've all been there and know that sometimes the hardest part of leaving is accepting that your hopes have been shattered...

@right558 @BeaKinde @MissingKids Right and part of the problem I have with the public school system is that everything is so standardized and not equipped to meet individual needs. Luckily my children are doing well so far but I would homeschool them if they need to be. I homeschool just their religion classes.
@kellys_author Almost 10 years.
@right558 @BeaKinde @MissingKids I was homeschooled because our family could not afford private schools and the public schools in our area were not that great. My parents wanted to ensure we all had a great education and I am forever thankful to them for that.
@MissingKids This is not common for homeschooled children to be in danger. Most parents who homeschool do so for the best interests of their children and their education. This is a tragic incident that should have been prevented. Someone should have noticed that they were gone.
Take some time to reflect on 2018. Are you on your way to where you want to be? If not, what is holding you back? We have all come so far this year; many of us finally escaping our abusers for good. It's been a tough year but we are still here. We are Survivors!
@kellys_author The first day I met him I told my friends that I thought he was a big baby. He acted like the world revolved around him. For whatever reason I though "well I'm glad he felt like he could vent to me." Ugh! I never heard someone complain so much about their boss before.

@PenelopeSolas @Dickmalone9 @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone The Virtus Training is useless. Another liability bandaid. Only once did I report a lay person who should not be in Youth Ministry did it get taken seriously. They passed the background checks and we're current on their Virtus training modules.
@PenelopeSolas @Dickmalone9 @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone I'm very much aware of the Diocese stance on "Protecting God's Children" as I took the required Virtus training for my previous roles in Religious Education and Youth Ministry. Either way means adults should have been protected too. It's just common sense.
@PenelopeSolas @Dickmalone9 @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone I just re-read and have to call  out that grooming is a form of abuse. Might not be technically an all out assault but it's the prelude. It's not acceptable. I know way too many of the priests on the list but it won't cloud my judgment on the messed up abuse they committed.
@PenelopeSolas @Dickmalone9 @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone Either way he shouldn't have been able to continue as an active ministry priest. He was saying mass at St. Tim's. I was there many times and saw him. I remembered him from Saint Thomas Aquinas in South Buffalo.
Why do the perpetrators and enablers get so much say in court? A Survivor said "the weekly visitation is a weekly re-traumatization that the court won't let me protect my child from because they rather protect the abuser's rights than my child's well-being. " #FamilyCourtReform
@PenelopeSolas @Dickmalone9 @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone Counseling doesn't stop abusers. It's like a liability bandaid. Someone only changes when they choose to. Most abusers just go through the motions of what is mandated of them.
@PenelopeSolas @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese @BishopRJMalone Well then you choose not to see that then. I hope everyone involved goes to jail. No special treatment.
@RepBrianHiggins We appreciate you. As long as I can remember you have always fought for what is right. Thank you

I'm sharing advice I gave to someone earlier. I get it. I went back before too. Trying to save lives because I too am lucky to be alive! Abusers have nice days. They are and will always be abusers. Cherish the good times and move on.
Write down all the excuses you are giving of why you are considering going back to your abuser. Then imagine your mother, best friend, or close relative giving those reasons. What advice would you give them? Every survivor who went back has told us "I'm very lucky to be alive."
We are outraged! Why isn't more being done for them?! They deserve justice! https://t.co/Yz8fmLr78g
Share ideas of how you are giving this #GivingTuesday
It's #GivingTuesday today. Do something kind for someone. So much focus is put on monetary giving that we often forget how valuable giving our time and attention to others is. Donate an hour of your time today. Soup kitchens, shelters, and hospitals always need volunteers.
Over 300 women will die today and every day worldwide from an act of intimate partner violence. Help us stop this. #DomesticViolenceAwareness
None of the children are wearing bombs. You Trump supporters need to stop with the nonsense already. It's OK to say this is wrong. You should say it's wrong. You shouldn't blindly follow Trump on this.
Another one is there are criminals hidden. There may be a handful among them. Making sure the few bad guys don't get in is what border security should be working on instead of throwing tear gas at children.
We can't understand the lack of outrage towards women and children getting tear-gassed. Someone said they might be victims of trafficking. If they were then why did our country tear gas them instead of helping? Bad comeback. Stop the nonsense.
It is NOT ok to throw tear gas at children. Also seeking asylum is 100% legal. There has to be a better way to make sure that ALL the people coming to the border are seeking asylum. To assume every single one is would be dangerous. Nobody expects that but the majority are.

If your church tells you to stay in an abusive relationship, that is Spiritual Abuse. Biblical "submission" is way too often twisted around to "justify" this. Churches need to do better in handling domestic violence. Message us for more info.Time to have this conversation!
@Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese I'm glad this question is being raised. Even in instances of domestic violence, the powers that be wait for the children to get abused instead of being proactive. Statistics show that when the parent is getting abused so will their kids eventually. Action must be taken sooner.
@GreeneBlitz @Charlie_Reports @BuffaloDiocese People do not always press charges right away because of fear and trauma. Many times it's hard to prove and the few if any they do tell do not believe them. Your attitude towards the #metoo movement is why nobody would confide in you if they were abused. #BelieveSurvivors

@GuyVentner @dragon_lady_51 @DearProgeny @senorrinhatch We appreciate the constitution but having to get dragged through countless hours of court proceedings revictimizes the victim. Far too often the rights of the perpetrators take precedence over the victims and that's not OK.
@StrayWolf_ @dragon_lady_51 @UVIL1991 @DearProgeny @senorrinhatch She wanted to let them know about her story before they confirmed him to the Supreme Court. I think we can all at least agree that if her accusations were true without a doubt that he should not have been confirmed.

Trauma effects memory as part of dealing can be blocking.
@GuyVentner @dragon_lady_51 @DearProgeny @senorrinhatch This is one of the most harmful amendments impacting survivors of all types of violent crimes. When someone almost kills you and you have to stand in front of them retelling what they did is traumatizing.
@SC_GYoung @senorrinhatch We doubt after the backlash and death threats she will. The majority had no problem confirming him so what good would it do to drag herself through a vicious trial. Retraumatizing for no reason. Not gonna happen.
@IrishHoosier17 @senorrinhatch Her goal was to let people know who and what they were confirming for their consideration. It wasn't a trial.
@bzarillo @dragon_lady_51 @DearProgeny @senorrinhatch Calling out injustice and standing up for fellow Survivors is what we do. Calling out our mission because we disagree about Dr. Ford is shallow.
@UVIL1991 @dragon_lady_51 @StrayWolf_ @DearProgeny @senorrinhatch Do some research about how trauma affects people.
@Captain_JimKirk @senorrinhatch We believe all Survivors
@DearProgeny @senorrinhatch Nobody hopes or wishes her allegations are true. We just believe her that they are. To be clear any allegations that were made and proven to be false such as the one in the original post is not OK especially as it makes it harder for real victims to be believed.
We choose to believe Survivors and stand up for them. If you do not then go ahead and block us.
All of our members have had  personal twitter accounts since 2009-2011. The twitter for our group started when our group started. I guess stuff like that matters to Trump Supporters.

#Safety4Survivors Make sure national media coverage educates the types of Domestic Violence and advises everyone of which candidates support #VAWA so they know who to vote for. Hint, not one Republican does. #BlueWave https://t.co/osotboFaCV
@YWCAUSA @nnedv We love the YWCA. Keep up the great work!
Media coverage is so widespread that a wrong message can have a long-term negative impact. This many times makes people afraid to speak out. Be brave! Silence is where violence thrives.  #UseYourVoice #safety4Survivors https://t.co/v3QYtbsSMN
The #1Thing is that you are worthy of happiness and https://t.co/dXHikOXnqH deserve a good life. To share this we need to remind one another that they matter. Be kind to everyone you encounter always. https://t.co/yfJMQa4jL8
A1. The Courts are not set up in a way to be proactive. If there is abuse in the home against a parent in front of the children, it effects them. Do not wait for the abuse to be inflicted directly on them before taking preventive action. #Safety4Survivors https://t.co/tmuuGuM0ZU

@JohnCornyn Furthermore he lost all if any credibility when he started talking about alternative universes.
@JohnCornyn Not at all. He was incoherently rambling. He should have made a bulletpoint list of what he wanted to say. It's clear that he truly cares but it was hard to follow. If it had been presented better and not during Hurricane Michael, perhaps it would have been better received.
@RudyGiuliani Kanye genuinely seems to care. It just was a very disorganized way to go about stuff and the timing was bad. People are upset that was going on during hurricane Michael too. There was no reason to give that so much media attention. It wasn't a summit. He's just a rapper.
