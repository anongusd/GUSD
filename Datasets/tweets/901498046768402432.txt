@gatewaypundit Now Hillary go gently into the night find a place to sit prop up your feet and ask your maid to bring you a bottle pf chardonnay.
@CNNPolitics You forgot daffy duck, the road runner wiley coyote, petunia pig,bugs bunny,porky pig snd my favorite Jim Acosta
@lmsimon4 @CNNPolitics Why not Hillary did it.
@TurnoutPAC Oh good put Obama up then we can see his college transcripts. The Republicans can do to him what the Dems did to the last judge nominee.
@VeronicaTellsIt @DLoesch And you are linked to the mineless sheep brigade.
@RoKhanna In 11 years the only thing I care about is new congressmen and women who dont cry the sky is falling
@RoKhanna Do you actually think throwing tax payers money at this is going to solve the problems?
@RoKhanna That's their problem. They got 50 k loans for degrees they can'tfind jobs for does AOC ring a bell? Bartender.
@renato_mariotti @RoKhanna @AOC Well since collusion with Russia is going down the tubes let's just try another road.2020 elections. at this rate favor the Republicans
@RoKhanna What financial interest did Obama and H. Clinton have for the uranium deal?
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti Do you have proof of criminal violations or are you listening to talking heads?
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti Duh! Believe what you want its still a free Country for now.
@surrealyo @mmorten @dcexaminer @BernieSanders @AOC @eScarry They do not take in millions and. in all 3 countries. 80% or more of the citizens can speak English.Imagine that!
@maziehirono Than why do the Dems support socialism because the gov. will decide what they think is best for the people.
@PattyMurray @maziehirono @SenBobCasey Child Care Advocates?
@DanR_Breen @mivulgar @TRACILS70 @seanagnew @jemelehill America has over 45 million getting some kind of gov.handout that's more than the population of all 3 countries.
@mivulgar @DanR_Breen @TRACILS70 @seanagnew @jemelehill This American knows why .Small populations.93% or more same race.93%or more speak the same language.They don't have other people in their countries calling them racists. I could go on but you get the gist of it.
@jemelehill If you have a IQ of over 70 than you know what it is and do not want to gov. running their lives.
@Debbie_3 @mmurraypolitics They are not sheep like the other sides voters.
@DJHuntPCG @mmurraypolitics @maggieNYT Democrats?
@sandsun4me @mmurraypolitics @maggieNYT We do that's why I left the Democrats.
@Teresa90773625 @CNNPolitics How do you like living in a red state?
@Blaq502 @shaunking @wcbuecker My photo might scare you.
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti No since it does not say for Stormy Daniels. I don't rush to judgement since I am not comsumed with hate just let the facts come out. But since the Dems are leading the charge  not sure I  would believe them unless they have solid proof.
@BuckSexton Obama Bot! Nothing new with CNN.
@Toria6069 @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton Wow! Hate runs deep on this thread..
@ndblackirish97 @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton Those who cry racist are the racists.
@58_yankee @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton BS!
@JudiWunderlich @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton Are we talking about Dem
@ChefBeena @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton Why dont you think she can think for her self she said she wanted to do it.
@mimi1bandolera @shaunking @MarkMeadows @LynnePatton No he does not Talib does.
@Blaq502 @shaunking @wcbuecker She did not humiliate herself She said Pres Trump is not s racist. Oh but I guess she cant speak for her self why does the left always think that of minorities?
@brian87robinson @RashidaTlaib @MarkMeadows And some needs to tell Ms Talib she is racist and anti America.
@MaraGay The only reason you say that is the blackface is a Democrat and you don't criticize your own.
@MaraGay @jbouie The greatest threat to our freedom are lefty Dems and Socialists.
@MaraGay Are you talking about the Congresswoman?
@MaraGay @nypmetro Well when things are run by Dems that what you get.
@Teresa90773625 @CNNPolitics Don't bet on that.But that's what the left always says. Reminds me of my school days on the playground.
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti I need proof not just rumors and. for the hush money not a crime if true and campaign finance violations are usually monetary lik Obabma had to pay.
@TMURPH88 @Jenn198523 @IlhanMN She got elected because her constitutes think like her. Check out her district.
@KeathMayes @renato_mariotti What alternate universe do you live in? Typical Dems changing the narrative. America has woke up and will not believe any of this junk the left spews.
@astgeirsson @renato_mariotti Collusion topic has been none stop for over 2 years. and now you want us to believe it was Trump nope you are not getting away with falsehoods.
@Stannis_Rex @renato_mariotti What?
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti Nope try again.
@BanashKelly @renato_mariotti Trump focusing on collusion ?thats all the media and the left have been talking about for over 2 years
@MindBlink13 @renato_mariotti Do you work for SDNY office? No one has charged them with anything shouldn't we wait and see what happens.
@DumpTrumpRump @renato_mariotti Nothing has been proven just the left's wishful thinking.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you it's nice to have a conversation with someone who can have a discussion without name calling.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And some of us who have been around for a long time see the Country headed on the wrong direction I see Dems wanting to control our lives and thats not how I grew up.Freedom iis what makes us great!
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What are your thoughts on Obama giveing Iran billions and nothing changed?
@phillipkmccarty @thehill @LindseyGrahamSC You don't kniw America do you?
@phillipkmccarty @realDonaldTrump Dont you just love America and the 1st Amendment only here you can say things like you just did and not land in jail.
@phillipkmccarty @stevemorris__ @MarkMeadows He's not but that Lady https://t.co/A0DCaV47A5.
@Teresa90773625 @CNNPolitics Oh yes we do! Don't speak for me!
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 3 new women in the halls of Congress 1 just lost New Yorkers jobs and the other 2 sound anti American.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump They were glad that Trump didn't get a deal with NK they would rather see the West Coast go up in flames.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Dems voted down bill to protect babies who live after abortion attemp.But God forbid a child at the border is separated from his illegal parents they cry Trump is. bad yet Obama did the same.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump No.1 Russia Russia Russia, oh gosh don't look like there is any collusion let's go after his finances. No.2 believes Cohen and Hillary Clinton and her motely fools.More to come.		.
@charliekirk11 We need people to investigate all of this and the Dems in power Dems are always digging for dirt where are the Republicans?
@dcexaminer @BernieSanders I think that's a felony but no one has the balls to arrest him.
@EECJONES @Acosta @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Our enemies that are doing us harm right now are within and they are not Republicans..
@dailyclench @rhowardbrowne @dcexaminer @BernieSanders @AOC @eScarry Really wrong Bernie has made a career of being a politican and is a draft dodger How many hpurs has be worked AOC is in Congress because some people are sheep and need a Sheppard.
@OfficialSPGB @dcexaminer @BernieSanders @AOC @eScarry Bernie wants to keep his 3 houses but you have to share your house with others.
@mmorten @dcexaminer @BernieSanders @AOC @eScarry Because they are small countries and almost everyone speaks the same language and they have so much in common.They do not take in millions of people either.
@CosmicSib @NBCNews I think a. Country like North Korea having nukes is a big issue don't let your hate get in the way of reality.
@preacherwayne @NBCNews Don't worry theres a lot of people cant even speak English let alone write it.
@septheunicorn @NBCNews He already has but just keep burying your head in the sand.
@coachegge @NBCNews I dont think he spent billions like Obama did to appease Iran.
@SkinsHogHeaven @NBCNews What did we get in return for Obama giving Iran billions in cash?Zilch!!
@juicejuice64 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Obama and his billions to Iran now that's a portrait of a fool.
@beaches97 @NBCNews No having a dictator threatened to blow up the West Coast is much more serious.
@brianplydon @NBCNews I guess Trump should have sent billions of cash to Kim like Obama did right!
@Claudman75 @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump Sure and I bet you are!
@vbopp8 @NBCNews How do you know? Been all over the world have you?
@nbrezi @NBCNews No he's been gone. for over 2 years.
@FKAFernando @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse And keeping illegals out of our Country.
@dcexaminer @AOC @realDonaldTrump She is also stuck on stupid.
@WayneDupreeShow Just goes to prove some people are stuck on stupid all their lives.
@Jennza3 @Acosta Treason? What has he done or you just following the sheep who buy into the leftist media?
@EECJONES @Acosta I would rather try to get along with a Country with nukes but I don't live on the West Coast so whatever.
@RealJamesWoods And Earth to Cory Booker you are not Spartacus
@DemodogsandCats @HoarseWisperer On there you go with your eliteist Attitudes I would rather be a hayseed than one of the Liberals.
@christophurious @HoarseWisperer I like southern accents unlike those on the east coast.
@NotOnMyWatch83 @HoarseWisperer Don't give up your day job and go study what evil is ,like killing babies that were just born.
@iosolofede @HoarseWisperer Oh there goes the elites thinking they are better than this Rep.
@JulieFAnderson1 @HoarseWisperer @RepClayHiggins Really like Omar hates Isreal?
@littlebit_mia @HoarseWisperer @aj_mirabelle How did AOC get on the committee?guess any one can if she's on it.
@marybookwriter @HoarseWisperer @cj_spinks @GOP No the Dems are frightening.Don't get old they will pass a bill to have you done away with.
@Kamaribis @HoarseWisperer Not any worse than NewYorkers accents.
@Jackie22188020 @HoarseWisperer How  about AOC and Omars district could say the same for them.
@HoarseWisperer Yep especially with a D behind their name.
@HoarseWisperer It takes one to know one.
@mschlapp Katie is right amd he wants to make money off of all of this when he gets out of prison
@joshtpm Are we watching the same hearing
@joshtpm @DonaldJTrumpJr Don't believe much out of Cohen's mouth. He is such a sad sad man.
@joshtpm Abd the race baiter is now asking questions.
@SassySculptor @kidgolferman What about all those Union Soldiers who died on the battlefield or those that were sick that came home but could never work they should get reparations.
@DavidAFrench Ye without sin cast the firdt stone.
@LaylaAlisha11 @LNW4Trump @ILMFOrg Yes and he does not practice what  he preaches wow a socialist with 3 houses it's ok for him to be rich but not the common man or woman.
@dswir121 @HillaryClinton The future will give us what we make of it and it's without Hillary and by the way I voted for Bill Clinton twice
@RyanAFournier Her sign should have said Dumb!
@Barleymasher @AOC Nope not terrified just hopeing we don't catch the disease that some on the left has.
@kcharlesmoore @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein @AOC Can you tell me what has changed to make this a do or die in 10 years situation.I am serious what?
@dgarr71 @sunrisemvmt The sky is falling! I have heard that for decades still isn't happening.AOC is not someone I would believe.
@libra9515 @HillaryClinton When you think you are smarter than someone else with a different opinion and yo u resort to name calling you have lost the battle just like Hillary did.
@libra9515 @HillaryClinton Stock market goes up and down all the time,didn't know you talk to our allies, children have to be protected until the border patrol can determine if the adults are really their https://t.co/RcLePDkjlO!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Is it racist to have doors and locks on your house?
@SenJeffMerkley Hilary and Obama are not President.
@SenJeffMerkley Tell us again after you leave the doors to your house wide open.
@SenJeffMerkley Shouldn't you tell China and India the same thing?Air does not stay in 1 place.
@LevineJonathan If these laywers don't practice in Ky then it's a mute point.
@deebs842 @HillaryClinton You must think all females think alike wrong!
@dswir121 @HillaryClinton Some people learned from the past that's why she's not in the White House.
@PeaceNeeded1 @HillaryClinton Thank God people seen what she is like and no destruction in the forecast unless the Socialists gain power.
@JacqulineLei @HillaryClinton People did not vote for Hillary because we who have been around for awhile know her and all she has wanted was to be was President and the hell with the people.
@libra9515 @HillaryClinton America is doing better under Trump.
@coryscobra @HillaryClinton The biggest threat to our democracy are the Socialists in gov.
@SamiraLV @Jim_Jordan We all know about the fake accusations.
@Dogwhistle1984 @efoster_eric @Jim_Jordan Well if so he better hurry up over 2 years and nothing.
@efoster_eric @Jim_Jordan And none have to do with Trump.
@Blak272 @Jim_Jordan Jordan has.more credibility than all the socialists in Congress
@RealJamesWoods She's also dangerous since there are people out there who think like her.
@ChrisMurphyCT Correction 100 people die each day from PEOPLE useing guns. Guns cannot kill anyone without a person pulling the trigger.
@dcexaminer @CNN I don't care about statistics if just one illegal comes into this Country and harms a citizen that's one too many
I wish the Democratic Congresswomen who were grilling AG Whitaker on children separated from their parents at the border had as much passion for aborted children as they did for the illegal's children.
@ItzBekka @KenDilanianNBC And Clinton Comey Clapper and all the other Democrats.
@Maurice46478372 @KenDilanianNBC I think you have already divorced yourself from reality.
@bratz2you @KenDilanianNBC I like him!
@maddezmom @KenDilanianNBC @GottaLaff Or Obama's administration.
@mercedesana88 @KenDilanianNBC I think he went to the same school is AOC,  sorry could not pass that joke up.
@hypatia264 @KenDilanianNBC 1st off its executive privilege not to reveal what takes place between them and that's all you on left say clean up your own house first. As if a Democrat never lies.
@russell_b67 @neontaster Because she knows nothing and going to the moon was not a socialist idea.
@nowthisnews @AOC Not going to happen.
@RealJamesWoods Amen Mr.Woods!
@Hillteamhomes @AOC She's not going to get anything done just get Trump reelected.
@abby_b_fit @AOC Yes we need to know who the socialist's are.
@ignored_the @AOC He did not lie were you even watching?
@rtilleraas @AOC Do you even know what tyranny i
@Jerly1970 @AOC Yep we now know who all the socialist are.
@CruxleyC @AOC @Peggynoonannyc Young and attractive are not qualifications to be in Congress.
@oannewsfeed I wonder why since the Senator has cancer herself.
@1Romans58 @KAG4All Yes!
@LazyMeatball @TrumpsDC @AOC Isn't she the 1 who cofronted Flake? If so she's paid by Soros may be here illegally and said she was sexually assaulted at 5 years old but her bio says she didn't come to the US until she was about 13.She has a lot of nerve .She has no right to say anything about our Justices.
@GeneralWiseAss @JustinShock @KamalaHarris I qualify to tell women to not use abortion as birth control.
@realDerekUtley @RyanAFournier She was chewing her cud.
@RagingGayCons @LeezimmLz I thought the same thing
@greggutfeld It reminded me of another group.
@GrahamAllen_1 Because The President is freeing their people
@dcexaminer @SherrodBrown Pretty soon every body will be called a racist and then there will be nobody for the Left to pick on.
@rekastner @Millie__Weaver @Sarah__Reynolds The little girl that died near the border her Dad is responsible for her https://t.co/MswPV7QbxI for those killed in wars of choice put the blame on those Countries not Americans	But we here in America can do something about abortion
@kerstenpr @Millie__Weaver @KaitMarieox If this is what you believe conservatives are them you are what's wrong with America.
@BryanMa18455275 @mschlapp Oh I get it if they aren't perfect just kill them.Are they going after old folks next?  Younger people need to be careful future generations may find when you are old you may not be worth letting live.
@kwilli1046 Many years ago I seen them in Missouri Yes they can be seen that far south but very rarely.

@internet_h8r @DanCrenshawTX @AOC @BernieSanders @IlhanMN @TulsiGabbard @RoKhanna He lost it fighting for our Country and our freedom so you can ask stupid questions.
@McLeemz @DanCrenshawTX @AOC @BernieSanders @IlhanMN @TulsiGabbard @RoKhanna Ha ha that's funny.Being cool does not mean they are smart.
@Hamitron @DanCrenshawTX @AOC @BernieSanders @IlhanMN @TulsiGabbard @RoKhanna And may the bird of paradise fly up your nose

@Melxtex @bennyjohnson Einstein this has nothing to do with Russian Collusion!
@jjalex206 @bennyjohnson You do know that not one of those indictments had any thing to do with Russisn Collusion.
@SctMms66 @bennyjohnson Better than CNN.
@RockyMountViews @bennyjohnson Likely someone at the FBI tipped CNN off.
@TrueLiberal2 @bennyjohnson @kvon631 For what? Hillary or any liberal would be better.

@FeysPerson @HillaryClinton We weren't.
@TheSteveTheCat @HillaryClinton Madam nothing you mean.
@neauxluh @HillaryClinton Oh good grief!!!!!
@skkorman @HillaryClinton The people spoke end of story.
@Cdn4LFC @Aronzaqua @JJohnson2u @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 No you are the racist,American hater and a sexist.
@TheSuperStoic @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 IF is the definitive word here, no evidence of that. It was perfect legal to a U S Citizen to want to built a Hotel in Russia. We shall see in the coming months what happens.
@Cdn4LFC @Aronzaqua @JJohnson2u @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 Of course they do if a Liberal invented it, you know the Heinz 57 varieties.
@alexisariaavery @SenAlexander Rep gov. coming in so even if Mr Alexander resigns after the new  gov . takes office then  He would appoint another Republican to serve out his term to 2020.
@spiffyhipps @SenAlexander Sanders, Schumer, Markey, Leahy,Wyden, and many more on both sides.
@Jillymoe @SenAlexander Yep and Sanders , Schumer Leheay  Markey and a lot of Dem Senators
@SarahClapp @SenAlexander DEar Lord if we could get Bernie Sanders to retire.
@metaquest @SenAlexander BS!!!!
@lauralosche @SenAlexander If you want what the Senator has move to Tennessee and run for Senator in 2020
@barbarikon @SenAlexander Nothing will make this Country better until the mental illness that runs through the Democratic party is cured.
@TheSuperStoic @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 I am not going to sit here and cite all the campaign laws for you, look them up yourself! Obama was fined about $375,000 for campaign violations so according to you Obama should have been tried for treason. Who was working for a a hostile foreign gov?
@TheSuperStoic @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 You don't have to turn to me for anything I was stating a fact. Hating a sitting President is not a legal reason for treason.
@Cdn4LFC @Aronzaqua @JJohnson2u @NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 Says a non US Citizen.And it's a She!!!
@trucker747 @Ocasio2018 Why don't she take Obamacare herself she can if she wants to several Reps. took it . No she's she says one thing and does another thing.
@BreitbartNews Wapo and Rubin are a threat to Americans.
@LillianVikingDK @Emolclause @GOP @JohnCornyn BS!!
@Marjee123 @Emolclause @GOP @JohnCornyn You don't know much about Kentucky if you think Sanders has a chance there. But not a bad idea since he can't move he would lose his Senator status.
@Lauriel53557215 @Emolclause @GOP @JohnCornyn When hell freezes over.
@txgt @smgraubard @Emolclause @GOP @JohnCornyn @BetoORourke Could it just be that some Texans don't like progressive ideas?
@Flipmac1 @nypost Say to me the world is getting sick.
@ScottG325 @EASTBAYMMA @nypost BS!!!
@werebrokenpple @nypost Everyone deserve equal rights? If  so I want 1/2 of everything you have for the rest of my life. Nobody is equal in all things.
@saintseester @redsteeze She doesn't know the difference between healthcare and health insurance.
@Windhorse_1 @avatarmax123 @MWKnight3 @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump False!!!
@jmreycroft @maziehirono @sooze555 No she is just one Senator.
@hagsback @maziehirono Amen!!
@Panomeia @maziehirono Kool-Aide anyone!!!!
@sherkatillion @maziehirono Remember the cages photos well they were under Obama.
@SandzBobbi @maziehirono Are you really that dumb on this subject?
@beccainpuyallup @maziehirono @TsalagiOK They are nt internment camps she is not telling the truth.
@MoradoVirginia @maziehirono No.
@GardenIslePhoto @maziehirono I am with you I do not believe one word the Senator has said.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Yes  But do you?
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Sounds like a threat Avenatti.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson @AlanDersh If Alan Detsh says it's extortion you can bet it is extortion.
@LarryBoorstein @ErikaAndiola I am sure there is a investigation  going on. I will wait and see how it turns out before I comment anymore on this. I still blame the dad.
@kwilli1046 God Bless!!
@LarryBoorstein @ErikaAndiola Do you really think the Border Patrol carries food around for 163 people Gee what's wrong with you? They are many miles from the base and the poor little girl did not get sick until the were on the bus.

@LarryBoorstein @ErikaAndiola Because from what I have read they were out in the desert and there were about 163 of them and it takes a while to get them transportation to the nearest facility. It's not the Border Patrols fault they snuck in to the Country we have laws you know.
@Yolieoc @SenJeffMerkley @POTUS @DHSgov @SecNielsen Oh I see it but not thru your eyes other people have been there and they all say something different than your side does.
@Yolieoc @ErikaAndiola @CarmenYulinCruz @SecNielsen Not going to happen.
@MargauxWilder @JordanUhl @ManMet80 @indeed Who cares
@moirami @cin552001 @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan I think  the right should boycott all of the sponsors on CNN and MSNBC
@BreitbartNews Hopefully this will be my last comment on Amy, I don't care.
@PsychoMetalHed @Jenn198523 @DailyCaller Jerry Brown does not represent me or people other than Californians.
@Yolieoc @SenJeffMerkley @POTUS @DHSgov @SecNielsen You are not telling the truth.
@LaszczStella @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan That's fine I respect your opinion but I also have one. I also take issue with hard working people paying for people who do not come in the legal way.
@JLDrain @JordanUhl @DaveFromKnoxvil @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan @pacificlife Brainwashed ? I don't answer to anyone I have opinions just like you do and maybe someday you will wake up yourself .
@Yolieoc @ErikaAndiola @CarmenYulinCruz @SecNielsen You lost me at the racist pig comment don't like it here go back to where you came from. Have you been to our jails and prisons? People are separated from their families also and held in locked places. No this child's father is responsible end of story.
@JLDrain @JordanUhl @DaveFromKnoxvil @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan @pacificlife Well 1st of all I am a female that ends your question on sexism. And I was sexually assaulted by a 15 year old boy in the neighborhood at age 8 so there goes your theory on that. As to racism we were taught to respect everyone . How old were you? I have shoes older than you.
@abuhamzah1975 @JamilSmith @LibyanBentBladi @CBP As long as their parents drag them along. The thing is they have been told if they bring a child it's more likely they can get into America and wait their hearing.
@aurabogado Proof please!
@j0ffrey @TMC6876 @MinkyMiaa @ErikaAndiola Then why did he bring just one child? Could it be he was told he could get in faster with a child. It's her fathers fault.
@BarrySchwartz11 @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 How many rooms do you available for them?
@nccreative4 @AtlCush @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 It's news and we should know about illegals commiting  crimes
@nccreative4 @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 Bull!
@JRayMickey @hawkeye_1276 @biggiesnotdead @ErikaAndiola They are not gods and can't save everyone.
@LarryBoorstein @ErikaAndiola Blame her father.
@AutonomousFemme @ErikaAndiola Stupid! Should we charge you for all the deaths in Chicago this weekend?
@gdeguzman99 @ErikaAndiola @curaffairs Read! Read! Read! she died at a hospital who was trying to save her paid for by hard working US Citizens because her father caused all of this.
@LarryBoorstein @ErikaAndiola They know how she died because her father took her on a long journey because he thought he could snek in our Country with a child and would be allowed to stay. Reading is good for your brain.
@Jayren93982080 @JamesOC86886930 @ErikaAndiola Stupid statement.
@SpeaksFreely13 @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 That's just not true read all about the poor little girl and get the facts straight.
@Gmafortruth @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 No the people who come here  and enter illegally and the ones who help them  are the ones who have blood on their hands. America is not responsible for these people.  How many more people in Chicago have to die before you pay attention?
@rules_speedy @ErikaAndiola Where did you get these lies or did you just make them up?
@jimmyraft @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 Nope not even close is he responsible for your faulty thingking also?
@missionhillman @franks_3111 @PSanna866 @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 Whether you like it or not that is the law don't like it try to get it changed.
@Yolieoc @ErikaAndiola @CarmenYulinCruz @SecNielsen No America is not responsible for her death her father is. You do not understand anything about America. and responsibility.
@Wehms2 @scbchgrl @ErikaAndiola @Ocasio2018 You are so wrong why do you hate America and still live here.
@drawandstrike @Str8DonLemon Tell Hilary to take her ill gotten money and go down to the border and help these people.
@windergal @Phressssh @jacks301 @JamilSmith @CBP @NickMiroff She was on one of your buses? Then you are responsible for her death.
@windergal @Phressssh @jacks301 @JamilSmith @CBP @NickMiroff You going to pay for all the medical workers and lawyers? Right I thought not.
@ManjitGillTSSA @JamilSmith @sandybeach1028 @CBP And send them all to Manjit's house.
@CirceTejada @TheZigZagDude @gene_canfield @JamilSmith @CBP You do not know why they decided to come here unless you know them.
@TheZigZagDude @CirceTejada @gene_canfield @JamilSmith @CBP Liberals do not think logically they just hate Trump.
@courtmouse2003 @JamilSmith @chelseaperetti @CBP Nope the parents are to blame not Trump or anyone else. How did they know she was sick and had not anything to drink or eat for days? If that was the case then they can say you should be arrested for not knowing she was sick.
@Moniorti @PatedBears @JamilSmith @CBP I suggest try living in a different country since you don't seem to like ours.
@theClaudiaInez @JamilSmith @VictoriaCerulli @CBP I blame you for not respecting the laws of this Country.
@AllisonMetro @JamilSmith @CBP Tell that to her father.
@abuhamzah1975 @JamilSmith @LibyanBentBladi @CBP I know some poor people they will come to live with you and take over your house since you are a open border supporter.
@NncyRuth @JamilSmith @devodian @CBP @HillaryClinton @Carolyny1948 Hillary is never going to be president can't you get that through your thick skull? This treason thingy you all keep saying just shows you don't know the law.
@JLDrain Glad you got a good laugh sure beats you being angry all the time over Trump.

Oh and don't grow old  you may do what I did  and come to my senses.
@celiacole18 @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan O'Reilly had issues about sex. It was not about what he said it was about what he did. I used to be a Democrat but the party stands for not much that I believe in somehow along the way they lost me.

@SomeDuke @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan Yes Fox viewers older and have more money than these twits on here trying to shut down free speech.

@jhwalker36 @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan Yep true and Fox viewers I would bet have  more money and influence than the Twitters on  here.

@AinslieBrent @MissBossyBoots_ @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan Older people with money versus young people with no money.

@GingerJ66019714 @JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan @TuckerCarlson Amen Ginger Jones!!

@bad_takes @JordanUhl I agree with Jason Chaffetz. Does anyone know if the man with her is really her father?
@JordanUhl @indeed Do you agree on what the Founder of Pacific Life said about Chinese immigrants?
@lisablizzard1 @JordanUhl @GovHowardDean @GSK @GSKUS And a lot of them are older and use their products. Young people not so much.
@JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan This is not going to work too many people watch Fox and use these peoples services unlike  the Liberals who are young and don't.
@libtards_owned @GoSkers2018 @ndrew_lawrence @JordanUhl @GSKUS so do brown and black people all colors.
@Pinkey_Bethyl @JordanUhl @GSKUS The founder of Pacific Life made remarks about Chinese Immigrants . The Company has no reason for dropping ads on Carlson's show. They need to explain all of this.
@JordanUhl @ask_progressive @subaru_usa @mitsucars @Expedia @CapitalOne @indeed @LibertyMutual @Varidesk @JennyCraig @Bowflex @AstraZeneca @Nutrisystem @WeatherTech @GSK @pfizer @Allergan @Jordan are you aware of what the Founder of Pacific Life Amasa Leland Stanford said about Chinese immigrants and yet employed them on his railroad. Pacific Life needs to explain why they pulled their ads and yet their Founder said things about the immigrants.
@soledadobrien Maybe you should  check out the Founder of Pacific Life's views on Chinese Immigrants.
@WFAAJFlo @pacificlife Yes let's just do away with freedom of speech be careful someday someone will do away with your speech.
@ScottBolgiano @pacificlife Seems the founder of Pacific life didn't like Chinese immigrants read his statement on Wiki.
@pacificlife The people who want you to pull your ads from Mr. Tuckers show are for the most part are young and do not use your services. I find CNN and MSNBC to offend me daily maybe you should pull your ads from those networks also.
@pacificlife Do you disagree with the founder of your company Amasa Leland Stanford  what he stated about Chinese immigrants and still employed them on his railroad. I think you better clean your own house first.
@jshuey @pacificlife `I can say the same thing about CNN and MSNBC. They offend me everyday perhaps we on the right should start our own campaign to shut down CNN and MSNBC. The left will regret their assault on free speech when they grow old in a society that tells them what they can and cannot say.
@StephenKing Can Pres. Trump send you about  100 illegal aliens to take care of so taxpayers don't have to?
@HTLHellcat @ChuckCallesto I don't care .I hope she changes parties.
@ChuckCallesto Ms Navaro,was born in  Nicaragua and immigrated to America, went to good colleges(paid for by?) and all we get from her  is a foul mouth.
@GiantSoundLLC @THR @iamsambee Why do you know so much on this subject?
@Jasonrgarrett1 @OilFart1 @THR Well at least everyone knows Trump, Bee not so much.
@Midwesterner196 @THR No taste.
@Jasonrgarrett1 @brianrockwood @THR For goodness sake she's a Canadian and a Comedian at least the people on Fox news know what their talking about even the Dems on there.
@docrocktex26 @SInow Not all comments on here are from men just so you know.
@lookoutandlearn @Ocasio2018 @RepSpeier That's because some of them get campaign money from big oil and gas.
@fluxus2 @Ocasio2018 @BadJohnBrown They don't want to ban private jets.
@GinnyRae101 @Ocasio2018 You can write all the bills you want they won't get past the Senate.
@JuliaSp68139555 @LindseyGrahamSC Where where you when Obama was racking up the debt?
@ThomasRKurowski @LindseyGrahamSC The seniors will get their checks, where were you at the last shutdown?
@mschlapp The Liberals will find something else to hate and whine about.
@Gerald_Weaver_ Sick!!!
@bonniebailey63 They knew what he was before they voted for him,He didn't pretend to be a devout Christian never has, I thought the Liberals liked atheists.
@Gerald_Weaver_ Keep believing whatever you want it won't help.
@cynthia_kirk03 @Gerald_Weaver_ Didn't John Dean spend some time in jail?
@educatormary @Gerald_Weaver_ If he is (which he is not) then our time on Earth is about over.
@funder @Gerald_Weaver_ Old News.
@Gerald_Weaver_ Lets face it Trump could appoint Jesus Christ  and you would have a problem with that.
@theblaze As Gomer Pyle put it so eloquently  Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!
@IngrahamAngle @michellemalkin Can we investigate this ? Why do those on the left aways get  away with these things?
@ApocalypseNow10 @AlanDersh Everyone has a right to their opinions and I do too, what I can't figure out is why the Left has turned against him for stating legal opinion, its as if a person does not agree to what The Left says they tear into them.Does not reflect well on them.
@JohnEhrenfeld @AlanDersh I never hear anything about a stain on Bill Clinton for being a friend to Epstein and being on his Islands with him.
@ApocalypseNow10 @AlanDersh You know nothing about Alan Dersh, if youdid you would know he's a Liberal but happens to follow the law.
@John_Miller_NYC @AlanDersh I could ask you the same question do you know what your friends are doing in a room near you or what they are doing 24 hrs. a day?
@DenbrotS @AlanDersh @nola24073693 The key word is allegations. Anyone any given day can accuse someone of misconduct and in this Country you need proof.
@eiregirl58 @AlanDersh I believe him.
@theunderdogfan @AlanDersh Mr. Dersh is a Lawyer and follows the rule of law. He is a Liberal and I doubt he voted for Trump.
@grandmaghostie @AlanDersh There are some women who lie and this needs to be https://t.co/P0MdyH1iwJ. Dersh never said he did not believe women but he follows the law and there must be evidence.
@deeg25 Shootout at the OK Corral.
@mrelebouki @Ocasio2018 No Thank You we see just fine.
@jusmilo @Ocasio2018 She can take Obamacare just like  some other house members do but she won't.
@LizCratty @shannonrwatts Everybody already knows about this stuff I can't believe those on the Left missed theses stories.
@ChristineLindl1 @shannonrwatts Don't you think he is however this is a old story.
@FloridaCityNet @shannonrwatts That is not true and you know it.
@ChrisHowellUCLA @shannonrwatts Nope this came out about 2 years ago.
@stephwest28 @shannonrwatts @AlanDersh Thank You. Why are Liberals mentally insane?
@MNMaurice1969 @shannonrwatts @AlanDersh He has sued the woman and her lawyers for defamation.
@csavitt @shannonrwatts He did sue them.
@AussiePunter32 @shannonrwatts Yes Dershowitz was there and at least one time his wife was with him. Bill Clinton hung out with Epstein also and Prince Andrew also you might be surprised to find out all the people who hung out with Epstein.
@Fishbones2017 @shannonrwatts Yes genius he worked on their cases. You know even bad people are entitled to a good lawyer.
@savourfinefood @shannonrwatts @chrislhayes Yes and took the girl and her lawyers to court. Read about it it's online.
@zurent @shannonrwatts Does Bill Clinton ring a bell he was friends with Epstein and made several trips to his islands.
@bdAllison @shannonrwatts Yes and the girls also recruited other girls.
@angelfly72 @CasablancaRic @shannonrwatts @CNN @AlanDersh Gee I didn't know Bill Clinton was part of this administration!!!
@CarolineCJoseph @shannonrwatts Bill Clinton was also mention as being to Epstein's islands .
@ejburg44 @sue_oshea @shannonrwatts @AlanDersh Bill Clinton also.
@kathyklotzguest @shannonrwatts @MiamiHerald Dershowitz is a Liberal and he said it himself however he follows the law. This story has been out for at least 2 years and I guess you may have not heard it because Bill Clinton was also with Epstein on his islands many times.
@bright_kolleen @shannonrwatts @RobertMaguire_ These women have been heard and the one who accused  the professor went to court it got thrown out, Oh by the way Clinton was with Epstein on his islands why nothing in the MSM  about him, Oh I know he's protected by the Liberal media.
@Homeoffree61 @shannonrwatts @fawfulfan I stand with Alan.
@GartrellLinda Of course that's how Hitler was so successful brainwashing a majority of the people.
@McNaughtonArt Tom Arnold is not worth our time.
@rspeters @SenFeinstein Waiting for the House to implement the articles of   impeachment then send it to the Senate where it will die. They impeached Bill Clinton nothing happened.
@rikki012000 @SenFeinstein Right now they will just tweet about it. Lying is not a impeachable offense and I a not sure if it would be under oath.
@laurargy @SenFeinstein How is she going to charge him? She does not have the power. She is just 1 vote.
@answerallman @matthewamiller Do you know the old saying Keep your friends close and keep your enemies closer.
@curlygurl218 @matthewamiller I doubt it nothing much here it was not illegal since Trump was not President just a citizen.
@davidinseattle1 @matthewamiller The Senate will do no such thing.
@karlamoPA @matthewamiller @69News No we knew who they were and what they stood for, Never underestimate your fellow Americans.They are much smarter than Liberals think they are.
@mcatsee @akhenaC @matthewamiller @PeteSouza If you believe in this kind of military action who's to stop anyone if there is ever a Democrat President.
@KyleKashuv @MLB Me too!!
@dmboggs74 @JoePerticone @ColMorrisDavis Ok Thanks !

@TheLilPoundcake @JoePerticone She's so stupid she actually works for a living.
@ChristopWFisher @JoePerticone Nope just the left loons.
@truespartan01 @JoePerticone @JamieOGrady Yes because some people have nothing better to do in life.
@dmboggs74 @JoePerticone @ColMorrisDavis Only the loons on Twitter but they laugh at anything they disagree with.

@malthus_james @frank212 @BuzzFeedNews Actually I read the whole article and it did not say anything about a campaign Trump wanted to give Putin a apartment so people would buy the other apartments at a huge price to be near Putin.
@davidmwessel @peterjhasson @WSJ Why do they include these statics ? Why don't they just do the people who die from disease?

@mschlapp What a traitor he is.
@BreitbartNews How insulting to real women, women should stand up to these people.
@RobertDean42 @Nobodieknows @ChuckRossDC Well, I have to have proof and unless this person has video tapes it's a he said he said.
@winkweindel @jww372 @sweetshark @Ocasio2018 @EuphoricEuler @LindseyGrahamSC There is a little thing called wait their turn.
@Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC @NMAAHC I think Mr. Graham knows more than you do.
@RealSaavedra Well  who would have thought this ? Well we did!!
@KatrinaPierson Of course he does He spent many years in America before becoming a citizen.
@srlawton @imillhiser Can you tell me where the Democratic Party went? The Democrats today are off their rocker.
@TomiLahren @Newsweek I agree I seen your tweet. Newsweek is Fake News and should be ignored.
@Debsjaxs55 @Saty07801076 @SenBillNelson No the Dems in Broward and Palm Beach tried to steal it.
@Debsjaxs55 @politico Look in the mirror.
@Debsjaxs55 @LovesPatriot @Slate Shame on you!!
@Debsjaxs55 @Michaelb255 @SenBooker Are you talking about the migrants at the border?
@wilydelaine @mighty_jar @BridgetPhetasy And it was fiction but some people have a hard time with reality.
@soleilchat @BridgetPhetasy @nadabakos @KenTremendous A yes the Liberals leaders.
@BridgetPhetasy The internet is glorious and sometimes like this it's  mentally insane.
@jljacobson @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How do you propose to pay for them? We have US Citizens here who need help. Perhaps you can drive down to the border and pick up some of them and bring them to live with you.
@misterg16 Where were you during the Obama years and Ms Obama  decorated the White House at Christmas and it was quite lovely. Ignorant they are not they can see through the hate for Trump.
@DPleis @HTX_Con @Alyssa_Milano It is breaking the law to enter the way they are doing they must get in line like all the rest.And quite frankly don't care about international law we have laws here.
@EdKrassen @Reuters Can someone prove  that this is what the caption said or more propaganda?
@DarthVegeta21 @Ocasio2018 Thank You for your opinion, and my opinion is I blame Bush and Obama for their decisions they made while in office.
@MattEIce913 @BreakingNews @MarciaDaughtre1 @Reuters Fired from the Mexican side of the border Good Grief !!!
@my2greatgirls @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump We are a nation that has borders.
@Mandari25733571 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Then maybe people should not attemp to break into our Country,
@PureLilac1 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Gas on the Mexican side of the border when the border patrol fired gas  at the migrants  who had broke down the fence and got inside never was any gas fired across the border, Maybe if you are so interested in this look at all the videos before commenting.
@DrIsaacFNewton1 @RepSwalwell @USNavyMomPA @realDonaldTrump They have no right to charge the border. THe can get in line and wait their turn.
@awelab1956 @RepSwalwell @CherokeeNative3 @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenateDems @SenSchumer Oh Please where are you getting your info the US is not useing tear gas on children fake news again.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Well there are several videos on the internet showing migrants breaking the fence and it was only adults that broke down the fence and gas was dispensed this photo of the little girl and her mother were pretty far away from the fence and tear gas, fake again.
@DarthVegeta21 @Ocasio2018 I don't know if you ever did but everything that happened in the last 10 years is always Trumps fault.
@DarthVegeta21 @Ocasio2018 Obama and Bush  did it too. Remember the government bailing out the car companies and the Big Banks. Only difference back them it was Obama golf trips.
@DavidMariotti5 @Ocasio2018 That is so true and when WW2 was going on the sentiment against people of German Ancestry in the US was so bad some people changed their last names. And there  were 1000s of Men who fought  that had German ancestors.
@Guttersmith @Ocasio2018 You do know that the government gives them money don't you.
@WLHEARNS @Ocasio2018 Not in my school books. They taught us about slavery and why we should never ever enslave anyone again.
@heavy_skunk @Ocasio2018 Those under 40 maybe because people were taught history about the US back then the good and the ugly.
@bicycleriiights @Ocasio2018 I guess you know that all the land was not populated with Native Americans when Europeans came to this Country.
@bicycleriiights @Ocasio2018 Blame your schools people over the age of 40 were taught these things in school back then schools nowadays kids are indoctrinated on what the far Left wants them to believe.
@JSixpak @Ryan_Deitsch @thepocketgeek @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @marcorubio If hate speech is decided to be a symptom of mental illness then there will be no need for gun control because the government will just come and take the guns by force causing a war.
@EMMA17978241 @DFBHarvard Of course they won't cover it as refugees to them are all law biding. They don't want the truth to get out.
@Ocasio2018 You tax Wall Street they cut back on employees, speed up research in automation and in the end you have accomplished nothing. Beside you and Congress will get very little through the Senate and the President.
@Socialiife @troublingtome @Ocasio2018 Fleeing from a violent Country really? looks like they brought the violence with them.
@Ocasio2018 Those of us that are older have heard the same old song and dance that people are going to die since 1970. But since many of you were not around back then you would not know.
@jGidgetGirl @SallyQYates @erin777cats Your welcome!
@Jenn198523 Love it!!!!
@BasedPoland @JackPosobiec And so it begins.......
@RealKyleMorris They don't respect the law  why should we let them stay?
@Ryan_Deitsch @thepocketgeek @ScottforFlorida @RonDeSantisFL @marcorubio It is never going away you could take all the guns away from everyone in the world and evil people will find a way to kill. Mental heath should be looked at more closely but the politicians are dragging their feet.
A very Special Thank You to all of the men and women who have fought, served and gave the ultimate sacrifice so we can live in the Greatest Country on Earth. So when we start to feel sorry for ourselves lets be reminded they gave more than service they gave everything.
@christysevans @SallyQYates @CBenjaminFord Thank You for your honest opinion and having said that in my opinion I would not want Ms. Abrams running my state if I lived in Georgia.
@CopyDan It's a dang cartoon!!
@wheelchairhippi Where did you get your history lessons from Cracker Jack box?
@marklarsonradio @SchulzMuseum Where's Woodstock the little yellow bird oh no Charlie Brown didn't invite Woodstock .Oh the horror!!!
@VABVOX @Sabriyyah54 You are white so.....…..
@dori_Coz @JoeNBC Trump did not have to tell us about Hillary some of us grew up with her in the news.
@donwross @JeannaHeaster @JoeNBC And none supporters are not dying? Wow what do the have the Trump supporters don't have?
@michaeljknowles @DavidWohl No.
@christysevans @SallyQYates @CBenjaminFord I don't think I give a pass to anyone but Trumps were not personal bankrupties  and she must have made quite a bit of money if she owes the IRS 1000's
@DumbleDarkVader @BillKristol Wishing bad diseases on another human being is awlful and there's also a little thing that's called karma.
@BillKristol I am very sorry you contracted TDS, hope they find a cure.
@thereal_katie_a @Ocasio2018 Thank You I try to respect everyone's opinion
@dbongino Fox news needs to send Hillary a truck load of Chardonnay and she will change her tune.
@WBryanH @PoxNewsCEO @SallyQYates @Sabriyyah54 I donot know where my tweets went I know I didnot delete them????Don't you guys have anything better to do like bash Trump or paraise  Hillary? I don't.
@PoxNewsCEO @SallyQYates @Sabriyyah54 I know what patriotism is but about 20 years ago some  Democrats left who they were and became intolarant and thinking only what they believed was right, anyone who does not agree wiith them are called delusional, ignorant and russian trolls,I left them behid.
@Nickyboy63 @PoxNewsCEO Read what I replied to Tom C. Very delusional to think everyone who disagrees with you are russian trolls.
@PoxNewsCEO @Nickyboy63 Ha Ha ! Love it I have been called a lot worse in my lifetime. Just so you can throw away your crappy software program the 1832 in my user name is when my ancestors came to America and not from Russia although what would be wrong with someone's ancestors coming from there?
@brandongroeny No therapy needed. and it begins......
@thereal_katie_a @Ocasio2018 Ocasio is a socialist who has no clue about our government and thinks we can pay for everyone to have free stuff but has not clue on how to pay for it except to tax hard working https://t.co/qmP0KYcCv9's not fear or anger just she is clueless.
@PoxNewsCEO @SallyQYates @Sabriyyah54 Don't tell me about Patriotism.
@MathaiSamkutty @SallyQYates You need to check out the so called reporter he has a lot of history and was not much a lover of America.
@AttilaSn @SallyQYates They don't care about the man murdered they only care about bringing the President down.
@pdxlynn @SallyQYates @MrJonCryer Yates really she would not enforce our laws.
@ZootsAlures @SallyQYates Because there are people in this Country you know US Citizens who think he is doing a good job.
@myonetallcup @SallyQYates He is trying to enforce the laws the Left want to ignore them.
@marbee0228 @SallyQYates Nope it people on the Left who didn't get they way.
@MsJ9Love @freespirit1155 @SallyQYates Where was outrage when Hillary did it ?
@ToxicStew @SallyQYates in the immortal words of Aerosmith "Dream On"
@MedPierre @SallyQYates And Ms Yates had core values going after Republicans.
@JohnGAcosta1 @SallyQYates @aquarius1049 one opinion among millions good thing the US does not legislate on feelings.
@Psychopants3 @SallyQYates @InSpiteOfTrump A Chief justice is a mere human and it's a double standard the Left plays they have been calling some of the justices names. Uncle Tom ring a bell?
@roger37064 @SallyQYates @GOP @realDonaldTrump If you cane name just one thing he has done that  is criminal I might listen, and don't give the 9th Circuit  bs.
@Impeach45_March @SallyQYates You do know that it's the Senate that decides impeachment.
@jGidgetGirl @SallyQYates @erin777cats This Country is doing just fine but with the past adm. I was getting worried.
@Famoustwo7 @SallyQYates @debisnsync Nope
@68DodgeCoronet @SallyQYates Honesty?
@LindaHaleRCSD @SallyQYates BS!!
@christysevans @SallyQYates @CBenjaminFord Yes and put Ms Abrams on the finance committee since she is so good with money.
@JackPosobiec And we all thought humans had advanced from 1000's of years ago I guess not.
@SaysHummingbird @BennettHelen2 This is old news, it was reported over a year ago.
@wvjoe911 @BennettHelen2 Oh was he talking about Hillary Clinton?
@Stop_Trump20 @BennettHelen2 Hate is bad for a person's health.
@RBReich @BennettHelen2 And we thank the men and women who are on our border keeping America safe!!!
@BennettHelen2 @MichaelAvenatti @Twitter I watched the whole news conference the video was not doctored.
@MarkCanonica1 @MichaelAvenatti @Twitter Because he is President and Twitter does not want a potential boycott.
@blawgg We tax the rich , tax corporations, we welcome over a million immigrants a year, we let refugees and people who's countries have be destroyed by natural disasters in  and we have citizens who need America's help, You have take  a large Country why don't you take in more?
@blawgg Well Americans do worry about illegals they are paying for them because America is very generous. We are a Country of 330 million people Canada is a Country of  36 million. Last time I checked Canada does not have 1000,s on their border trying to get in.
@KurtSchlichter some people don't know the difference between public hanging and lynching why?
@thereal_katie_a @Ocasio2018 Never forget that old white men founded this Country. She may want to have a change in government but she is one voice.
@Psychobunny03 @Ocasio2018 She's not a Senator just a Rep.
@Lontar47 @Julian_Epp Why should rich people have to take care of people who are not smart enough or too lazy to help themselves. There should be a safety net for people who are really in need and by the way  the poor come with pitchforks and rich folks come with a armed army.
@JackPosobiec I am raising my hand!!
@2whatend @ACleverNickname @Ocasio2018 Very true too many worthless degrees today colleges taking students money and then they can't find a job. There are so many trade schools and when you get out you can have  very good paying jobs,
@ACleverNickname @Ocasio2018 I have a degree in life something you can only get from living  and learning something new each day but at least when I was in school I was taught about the branches of government. Having a college degree  helps you but it does not necessarily  smart.
@blawgg Since American has 10 times the amount of Citizens plus illegals and visa holders than Canada I think it would be very difficult to insure everyone but I hope they can work on it.
@abbsworth @finestone_me @Ocasio2018 No just stateing my opinion just like you did.
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti I get it everything is Trump's fault.
@colorcodedlife @Ocasio2018 That's great! now I hope you use your degree for good .
@Kath53774387 @CrumDesi @MichaelAvenatti On a slow boat going down the River of De-Nile.
@nectarina12 @jfalbanese @ArjunAshok57 @cranksteel @Ocasio2018 And you may be denied also if we have single-payer. If the goverment has ran such a poor VA service how do you think they will run a program for 330 million.
@cranksteel @ArjunAshok57 @jfalbanese @Ocasio2018 I believe that you can get a second opinion but don't quote me. and I guess you know that a majority of people on Medicare have to pay about 134.00 per month and that only covers 80% of the bill and then they have to get a  RXprescription ins. which is required by the government.
@blawgg No I am American.
@ArjunAshok57 @jfalbanese @cranksteel @Ocasio2018 Yes insurance companies do deny treatments sometimes but so does the Government through Medicare or Medicaid and government has the power over life and death pretty scary!!
@blawgg I have had to deal with Medicare for love ones and yes they denied some test.
@ACleverNickname @Ocasio2018 Having a college degree and using it is a different thing why was she a bartender and not working in economics ?On job training.
@MikeHersh @Sarge14854821 @HiiiPowerRevo @Ocasio2018 If she is so smart why does she not know anything about the government?
@sammoff93 @Ocasio2018 Wow ! Really?
@layhaps @Ocasio2018 How is she going to do that? Even if something gets past in the House it then goes to the Senate and last time I checked the Republicans run the Senate and then there is still the President he can veto it.
@jfalbanese @ArjunAshok57 @cranksteel @Ocasio2018 No but the government does . The same with Medicare and Medicaid you don't always get what you want they can deny you tests and surgery.
@cranksteel @jfalbanese @Ocasio2018 Just ask a Canadian how long for non emergency tests and surgery!
@jfalbanese @Ocasio2018 And really lousy heath care. Nothing is free someone has to pay for it.
@msramming @krossny1 @Ocasio2018 Why do you hate Liberman?
@colorcodedlife @Ocasio2018 And everyone who is under 30 needs to repeat high school again.
@BrockAuthor @Ocasio2018 Figures.
@finestone_me @abbsworth @Ocasio2018 He is a very nice man who isn't a socialist .He was a blue dog Democrat with sense unlike the ones we have today.
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti Sure I am but I don't drink the  Kool-Aid.He is going to be a senator and that's all folks
@readandrepeat2 @EricHolder Does not matter what you think he is going to be a Senator from Florida end of story.
@rickbrando1 @nytimes @jorgeramosnews This is the America I know and  we do care for other people from other countries but you can't just let every one in who comes across the border illegally.
@Fitter521 @nytimes These people always go judge shopping notice how all these cases are filed on the West Coast.
@SebGorka New York City always does.
@theblaze What has our Country become!
@kwilli1046 He was resisting!
@logan724 @staceydash @NASA @NASAHubble And your proof it is not. Have you ever looked at plants and animals under a microscope no way it was a big bang.
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti She was investigated by the FBI under Comey who's wife was a supporter of H. Clinton and they have found nothing YET!!
@readandrepeat2 @EricHolder If there was any voter suppression it was in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, Votes showing up all over the place mysterious trucks picking up and unloading ballots from private cars.That's very suspicious.
@readandrepeat2 @EricHolder As for Rick Scott and Medicare fraud that was in the news about 9 years ago when we was running for Governor old stuff and he was not charged his company was. No fraud as Governor and no voter suppression.
@readandrepeat2 @EricHolder I don't believe I said that the other 65 counties were controlled by Republicans because I know that is not true the large cities in Florida are Democratic controlled in cluding the famous I-4 corridor.
@readandrepeat2 @EricHolder How did democracy lose out in Florida where the 2 Counties are controlled  by Democrats
@dgb49 @EricHolder Yes voter ID!
@john_busbin @EricHolder @grigg_dana Dems hate losing!
@herrick_a @EricHolder Florida's trouble was 2 counties that are run by Democrats.
@TABATreason @EricHolder 2 Democratic Counties  in Florida  tried to cheat the Republicans   but they got caught at it.
@CindyKub @EricHolder If there was suppression than how did the Dems win so many seats?
@KirstenPowers How would you know you don't live in the real world and neither does the Wasingtonpost.
@KirstenPowers Abortion is also a death penalty  for unborn babies.
@KirstenPowers Oh we get it now all white people are racists including you.
@MrAndyNgo A purple haired white woman with a black heart.
@DOUGHENRY12 @MrAndyNgo It's a disease called hatred.
@MrAndyNgo These people remind me of the people who tried to keep black people down with separate bathrooms and water fountains , they are the racists.
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti I bet to differ Trump has been getting things done unlike Obama who divided this Country by race.
@hallsofdust @sblmgtrmsl @DregsUSA @staceydash I get that their are more registered Democrats then Republicans and a lot of Independents too. All I am saying is you can't put a label on people. I don't always vote straight party line.
@hallsofdust @sblmgtrmsl @DregsUSA @staceydash When I see a poll conducted on a million people then maybe  I will believe it. Everybody has so many different views and at different times in their lives I really don't put much faith in polls.
@hallsofdust @sblmgtrmsl @DregsUSA @staceydash Boy are you wrong about straight white women.
@BelleTimsit @LNGarmOFthLAW @Ocasio2018 @qz No she's not very bright.
@sairasameerarao Earth to saira tacos do not belong to you give them back, see how silly your statements are.
@sairasameerarao For the record they look like cow udders to me.
@sairasameerarao Because the Democrats are in bed  with them also.
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti You can't blame Trump for your ins. rising that was Obama as for your SS# it will be there for you if the Democrats don't screw it up.
@TeaSippingBarb @Moordairdachs You have been believing what the left wing press is feeding you ,why don't you read all sides of a story and stop being a follower.
@sairasameerarao My ancestors never killed anyone how about yours and all people in the US did not own  slaves . How do you think the slaves were freed ? They were freed by white people.
@sairasameerarao So by saying you were born here you are also complicit in this so called genocide and stealing land. So this is not your land either by your reasoning.
@TeaSippingBarb @Moordairdachs It's a little thing called a law.
@Bsanchez1213 @USATODAY No that's his wife.
@Mauldin4GA @USATODAY @Elise_Jordan @ Bill what to bet Gillum was a lousy mayor Floridians dodged one.
@CyndeeVS @USATODAY They won't miss you.
@rupleasant @USATODAY Sorry no freebies  coming.
@RealJamesWoods She is under the influence of something.
@lisabe65 @KOM_editor @MichaelAvenatti He is not a liar and he is not being investigated. as for not being fit to be a lawyer that title is held by Avenatti.
@COConservataria @nypost Unfortunately I seen stuff like this in New York City 30 years ago.
@egeogh @JessicaHuseman @Amy_Siskind Can't believe those Palm Beach SOCs
@bcook128 @Giftedbutlazy1 @dailytrumpfail1 @Mechagodzilla75 @MichaelAvenatti I can tell you any woman that has been gang rape or assualted has emotion when she recounts what happened to her Swetnick had no emotion.
@bcook128 @Giftedbutlazy1 @dailytrumpfail1 @Mechagodzilla75 @MichaelAvenatti I seen Swetnick's interview she changed her story on some key things and then when ask about the gang rape she said matter of factley she was raped every way there was no emotion nothing as if she was simply telling a story.
@ReasonableBloke @TuckerCarlson Maybe maybe not let the law sort it out. There must be witnesses to all of this because why would the Club revoke this mans membership?
@DrRJKavanagh Sorry but the one on Thinkprogress is a farce the original video was on Twitter by the people who were at Carlson's house they took it down soon after, I seen it. The one on Thinkprogress has been edited.
@ReasonableBloke @TuckerCarlson They are adults pay attention!!
@blue_and_tattoo @TuckerCarlson @BenHowe Maybe the man should not have called his daughter the C word. Gee I didn't know you lived with the Carlson's for 20 plus years that you know so much about them,
@CrumDesi @Kath53774387 @MichaelAvenatti Yes and Acosta tried to keep the mike from her and hit her arm with his hand.
@SkydivePaul @MichaelAvenatti Add Hillary Clinton also.
@Inalein_19 @Ben_Stotler @JohnT15 @MichaelAvenatti Did you notice the video on Thinkprogress website how it goes to different frames and this is not the same one the group posted on Twitter the other day.
@NinaJ82422165 @JoeConchaTV It also says that man threw wine on Carson's son Touche!
@NinaJ82422165 @LadyConser @JoeConchaTV It is not against the law to call another human a bad name that's why. She told her Dad and Brother.
@JFNYC1 @JackPosobiec New York is lost.
@MichaelAvenatti @Acosta Yea and he likes  it when we the American people watched it live and seen what Acosta did.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump you are funny Avenatti~~
@MichaelAvenatti So true and you are going to be investigated also.
@MichaelAvenatti Likely like maybe so or possible or just throw that in there.
@dailytrumpfail1 @Giftedbutlazy1 @Mechagodzilla75 @MichaelAvenatti I don't think Mr Grassley can be sued.
@Carolineoscars @MichaelAvenatti He can't unless this Juan guy wants to and it may open up a can worms on his part.
@NinaJ82422165 @LadyConser @JoeConchaTV Because this man Juan did not call the police yet he may do it but why wait a whole month if Juan did not say anything to the young girl?
@MichaelAvenatti Why didn't this Juan file charges if you think it was assault ?
@NinaJ82422165 @LadyConser @JoeConchaTV A friend went to the restroom with her looks like a witness to me.
@61_capt @MichaelAvenatti It's a private club pay attention.
@Luvmookie @MichaelAvenatti You need glasses in the video there is a woman who goes to his front door. Fake news again pretty soon nobody is going to believe the Lefties.
@Jfriedmanmagic @MichaelAvenatti Sure in fiction section at the local Library.
@Carolineoscars @MichaelAvenatti And lose like he did with all the lawsuits lately?
@Giftedbutlazy1 @Mechagodzilla75 @MichaelAvenatti He has forward the letter to the DOJ they will decide not Mr. Grassley
@gardeningnut2 @MichaelAvenatti Not going to happen.
@SteveKingIA Maybe somebody needs to hold these state officials accountable. I wonder if Trump could issue some kind of executive order or Congress there is still time to pass law.
@CalebJHull why do those on the Left , march and protest children being separated from their parents at the border but are pro abortion? Are'nt the children in both instances separated from their parents?
@Mysterydasein @CalebJHull @JonahNRO Nope the dna of both this baby and a 2 inch embryo are the same it's a human.
@cllaauussaannn @ananavarro @Yamiche @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan Ms Navarro is a immigrant she was born in Nicaragua and continues to bash this great Country who took her in.
@ajplus @SeekerBull Lot of people with nothing to do.
@DaShanneStokes @SeekerBull Not going to happen and this is our Country too not just yours.
@CydEHargis You can spin it all you want I was watching the news conference and his hand came down on her arm, No doubt about it.   I would swear to what happened and I am sure the networks  keep a copy of the live feeds.
@JFay99 @Ryan_Deitsch @davidhogg111 Crooks running the elections in some counties.
@kreame1 @Ryan_Deitsch @stevendeknight They didn't have crooks as Broward County has running the show.
@justVote2018 @Ryan_Deitsch @davidhogg111 Nelson is obsolete!
@dondrapershadow @Ryan_Deitsch Republicans want to preserve the law and not govern with feelings!
@BabyPortabello @MSNBC Someone just doing her job and you don't want her to ever find  work my goodness what happen to the Left?
@jeanette_ivy @MSNBC The US Government appointed her also known as we the people.
@Patriots2005 @MSNBC Put your glasses on please.
@bacholator @MSNBC No other way around but thanks for the spin.
@bobmacw @MSNBC Oh please read history if any thing some of the media is doing the same propaganda  that the Hitler Regime put out during his reign of terror.
@biskiteater1 @MSNBC The U S Government gave her the authority to take the mike, he touch her also she was doing her job.
@frockedfrog @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump enjoy doing about 10 years ?
@dryden2911 @MSNBC No he could be.
@kaloshilo @MSNBC Because he keeps the Senate where the House sends the bills you do know that? And they either pass the law or can it.
@esglegal @MSNBC Please go to the nearest Eye Center you cannot see. Trump is not a Dictator but he has authority no other person in this Country has.
@RussKlettke @MSNBC The Trumpies control the Senate and the White House they are not a clueless as you think.
@BetterBaker @MSNBC @DavidCoss no he was out of line!
@wedonopeneyes @MSNBC @Acosta It was her job to get the mic!!!!
@csedgman @MSNBC @Acosta No he did not why do I see something in the video you did not?
@KurtSchlichter Thank God!!!
@PaulDSmith9 @anamariecox Personally I like the long hair on  the Singers from the 60's 70's.
@uncamark @redhead_1862000 @anamariecox @brianstelter Nobody is a traitor to their  gender we are all different in opinions.
@jlawlsc @Angelo_Pappas_ @anamariecox @brianstelter Flash back to Obama ! Remember the love fest by the Democrats.
@PaulDSmith9 @anamariecox It looks a lot better than some haircuts young men have today.
@psuANTHONY @anamariecox @brianstelter Disgusting!!!
@ACTBrigitte I agree and why do some evil men get to live so long while good men and women die young. I guess there is no social justice for life span.
@combienDUtemps @MollyMcKew Yes and I would bet the areas she talks about are mostly run by Democrats.
@MollyMcKew @jan_scott000 And you don't think Trump love this Country? I know Bush did but Obama I don't know.
@MollyMcKew Optimism has returned it came back Jan 20 2016.
@MollyMcKew That's a really dumb statement ,societies are held together by common things. American is one of a few Countries where the societies diversity actually works.
@MollyMcKew If every person is created equal should'nt the unborn which was created have a chance at life?
@MollyMcKew Sure young people accept without question that's how you become a dictatorship. which we don't have.  You also should read if you have not already what he said about immigrants and don't take part of it and leave out the rest.
@MollyMcKew He said they will defend themselves not just shoot at them for no reason, 70% of them are young men. You have fallen into the trap of telling things that are not true. I am sorry you caught the TDS.
@MollyMcKew Obama appointed the far left judges while he was in office. Whoever is in office can do that. I was not pleased with his appointments but the people elected Obama , I had to live with that.
@MollyMcKew Just like the Democrats ignore the racist hate filed people on their side. You might want to do a little research on what the Nazis told the people of Germany about the Jews.Sounds a little too familiar what the Left is saying about the right.
@MollyMcKew Can you tell what rights do the Republicans want to take away from Americans ? I happen to see that some on the left want to limit free speech if it's not what they want to hear, for example on colleges campuses.
@MollyMcKew If you were really partisan you would see that the inflammatory BS comes mainly from the left. When you view everything through the prism of racism you cannot judge what is really going on.
@MollyMcKew Why should we sacrifice our men and women for a Country who may not share the same values as we do, We must help if we can but every Country has able bodied men and women who could make a difference in their own Countries.
@EWErickson I am not. Women should not be allowed to get on a plane fly to the US get off have their baby and fly back to their country.
@SteveSchmidtSES Trump didn't  ask the people from south of our border to come here, why are you so angry?
@tribelaw That's a ugly statement you made, nobody is forcing them to come here , I don't see them having chains on and a master forcing them to walk this way.
@tribelaw Well considering all the Leftist fanatics that rule south of our border what has Brazil got to lose.
@tribelaw @SteveSchmidtSES I think it should be The Rise of Lindsay Graham He finally found his voice good for him!
@tribelaw To save your lives? I don't get it.
@foxandfriends No!
@MichaelAvenatti Why are they so angry?
@BreitbartNews She really has room to talk Hanoi Jane.
@ChuckRossDC Ana has never been a Republican in her views.
@MortonViews @DRUDGE_REPORT From what I read they are American lawyers which I consider to be traitors.
@DistanceRun @michael31821845 @AC360 @JeffreyToobin Most states take a state issue ID card. Heck you can't get welfare without a ID or get into the CNN building.
@sparksdnelson @ianbremmer @vanhoutenphoto @Debra yes look at the face of the invasion 70% are young able men shouldn't they stay and try to make their country better.
@Cissysbaby @mike_pence @BrianKempGA It's still going to be awhile relax.
@DaveVescio @DineshDSouza I am not sure these women will persuade anyone to vote for the Democrats.
@KKHannegan @IAStartingLine @JohnJHarwood Or Joe Biden.
@TheModerateView @IAStartingLine @JohnJHarwood I agree Vote Maxine Watters and Adam Schiff out!!
@21briwat @IAStartingLine @nycsouthpaw Yea kind of like on college campuses when a conservative comes to speak and the left break windows burn things ,yea right like that.
@IAStartingLine Compareing King to the Pittsburg shooter is what white Libbies do.
@WayneDupreeShow Houston! we have a mental health crisis in this Country.
@RealKyleMorris Look like this woman could use some anger management courses.
@c_johns1042 @peterjhasson @MariaChappelleN @McCaskill4MO It's not going to happen in rural Missouri, they are still conservative.
They must not know what the flag is about.
Controversial flag causes stir at Penguins ceremony for Pittsburgh shooting victims https://t.co/SHtZvnTE8M
@BillKristol Mr, Kristol get out of your ivory tower and please change parties.
@itsJeffTiedrich You go through a lot more to buy a gun than vote.
@itsJeffTiedrich Right now some free loader who always votes blue gets off his couch in his free paid  apartment by the government , gets in his nice car and drives to get some free groceries all the while singing let them all in I don't care because I  get every thing for free.
@itsJeffTiedrich According to the Left what you just said about taco trucks was racist.
@TopRopeTravis @Stmolly4 Don't need troops to protect against white supremacists not very many of them unlike the lefty loons.
@CynBlogger @AJentleson @small1ldy1 @realDonaldTrump Native Americans were also immigrants.
@taketothesea @ThePerezHilton @Maria_Hinojosa That child born to a illegal mother and father is a citizen of whatever country the mother is from.
@greta I had one went to orthopedic doctor  he gave me a shot in my thumb  and no more trigger thumb.
@benandjerrys @netargv @womensmarch @ColorOfChange @HonorTheEarth No more ice cream from your company.
@JuddLegum Here's some companies the Republicans may want to boycott, Atlanta Falcons, Built a Bear,Disney,McDonalds, Dell, Sears, Mobil, Kinkos ,Darden , Cosco, Starbucks, Ebay and Hewlett Packard.
@kwilli1046 Thank You for these stories. We often get so wrapped in our own privates worlds and think we are the only ones with problems. Thanks for bringing us back down to earth.
@RealKyleMorris Sounded to me he might be a racist.
@MichaelSkolnik @realDonaldTrump Obama golfed while 2 American men were beheaded.
@TwitZanne @Oneevol @DavidAFrench @AndrewGillum And neither is DeSantis
@ElliottRHams Keep strong Elliott your people are God's chosen one's.
@SevenNationR @karencollinsnyc @Davis1970T @DavidAFrench Karen is what the left does best  deny, deny ,deny.
@TwitZanne @Oneevol @DavidAFrench @AndrewGillum Guillum is good at playing the race card.
@TheDjOj @DavidAFrench @benshapiro Why does the left protect all their loonies ?
@zampella @DavidAFrench We had a President that began to divide us  when he took office in 2008 and when the left lost the election the hate began. Yes there is some bad on the right but nothing like on the left.
@jrmduc @LudwigsGhost @djrothkopf @HeerJeet @Jerry with statements like the one about the mine shaft is  the reason that those on the right think there is a TDS going on.
@KrsaMaeFshr @LudwigsGhost @HeerJeet Oh is he related to Pocahontas Warren?
@NormOrnstein @LudwigsGhost @HeerJeet You better check out the Soros what he has done since he was a teenager and ever since. Why he is wanted over seas. It's not anti Semitism to believe he is a very dangerous and evil man.
@ChrisMurphyCT Mr. Murphy why is it anyone on the right criticizes someone on the lefts policies you Democrats dig in your pockets and bring out a card. Soros is not a good person.
@DariusTanzania @Conservativeind @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump Way to get a point across.Not!
@MrMaxBradley @Thirteen_Prime @KD__14 @piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump Or air planes flown into buildings and they used box cutters to overtake the crew and passengers.
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Senator Grassley is not a lawyer that is why he sent it to the DOJ.
@JoeConchaTV I can't believe I just agreed with Chris Wallace!!
@MichaelAvenatti In the immortal words of Aerosmith, "Dream On"
@NARAL @MichaelAvenatti Sure you do and I believe in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa Why am I debating you? You are a Canadian our laws do not pertain to you. have a Good Day!!
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa Yes I forgot a 0 my mistake oh and since we are spell checking etc. it's  you're  the one not once.
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa We were given the right to have arms by our Founding Fathers and until someone comes along and takes that freedom away it will be law. And if this should happen I am afraid that this Country would see war again among it's citizens.
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa And guns are for protection how  did having no guns in Iran a few years ago work ? People must be allowed to protect themselves if you rely on the gov. to do that  for you might be dead.
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa It's a no brainer the population of Great Briton is 65,700  the population of the US is 327 million.Chicago alone has more gun deaths each year.
@haywood_cm @SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @mmfa Thanks for the chart, looks like gun deaths have been falling the past few years that's good news. Between 2015 and 2017 there were 35,000 to 37,000 plus deaths from car accidents so what's your point?
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa That's your interpretation of the Amendment,You all complain about Trump taking away your rights but how do you defend yourself against a government that would take away your right to have a gun?
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa The key words here are violent people and the answer to that is we need more mental health programs not taking the guns away from law biding gun owners, why should they have to be punished for those who are violent?
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa Knives enable violent people to stab other people, cars enable violent people to run people down, planes enable Islamic terrorists to kill 3000 people with a plane and by the way they overtook the passengers and crew with box cutters.
@MarxistLEO You are right I do not know everything and neither do you but in my defense I did stay at a Holliday Inn once.
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa There are millions of responsible gun owners in this Country and they have the pesky little thing called the 2nd amendment.
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa Here is a novel idea guns do not kill and injure people the person using the gun does.Put the blame were it belongs. If you don't like guns fine don't have one and you have ever right to want the laws changed.
@SteveRDaugh Stephen: no not yet. Thank You for the debate. You will not change your mind and neither will I.
@SteveRDaugh @David_Gergen I have not boasted to you about Trump winning. I have been around a long time and I see this Country so divided that it scares me.  Where does all this hate lead to? We live in the Greatest Country on Planet Earth and there has to be some common ground somewhere.
@MarxistLEO Yes I know what is was I lived through those times and seen it through Journalist's eyes. If anybody doesn't know history it's people like you.
@SteveRDaugh @SenSchumer People on Medicare Advantage plans pay some of the cost unlike people on Medicaid plus they still have to pay for Medicare.
@SteveRDaugh No you are wrong I have been watching the news long before you were born. I watch John F Kennedys assassination , Robert Kennedys too and watched the 1st landing on the moon and watch the Vietnam war through journalist's eyes . Now  it's all propaganda  on both sides.
@SteveRDaugh Yea tell that to Rep. Waters, Cory Booker and Eric Holder and H. Clinton.
@David_Gergen @SteveRDaugh Since the beginning of Trumps campaign the Left has unloosed the jackals of hatred and after he was elected it got worse.
@SteveRDaugh Raw Story is taking her words out of context. I watched the whole interview she said the Border Patrol would defend themselves she never said the would shoot anyone.. This is why Americans don't trust the news.
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa Just about everything can be a leathal weapon . All I was saying is we can't hold everyone responsible for the actions of one person.
@SenSchumer @SteveRDaugh Well your side took 750 billion out of Medicare to pay for your Obamacare.
@MichaelAvenatti @StephenKing You call the President for violence and you are doing the same thing.
@xan_desanctis @TPUSA So called Conservatives like you are the reason it took me a lomg time to change parties and I am with Owens!!
@Robotrix1 @mmfa @Kathy really sick and you blame Republicans?
@backyardsage @mmfa You have no proof of who is sending those bombs here we go again guilty until proven innocence!!
@epiphanymia @mmfa I guess you don't follow the news.
@SteveRDaugh @AndyB820 @haywood_cm @mmfa Cars kill should we make the accessory to murder also?
@MarxistLEO @mmfa Drinking Kool-aide again?
@Feebeekiwi @djrothkopf Or ricin to Senator Collins and the White House. But that doesn't fit your agenda.
@lauren_fichtel @DMadison1812 @djrothkopf @themellowdee It would make sense if the person or persons want the people to believe it was a Trump supporter.
@LennyKleinfeld @nobrtshnyobjs @michele5411 @djrothkopf @olikolokolo Or it was done on purpose to make people believe it was one of those so called uneducated supporters of Donald Trump.
@ScherTodd @jbarro Oh like the photos from when Obama was president?
@thenation @joanwalsh If you can't win on your merits use all the cards you can find.
@RabbiJill @joanwalsh Did you say anything when the Congressmen were shot at playing ball?
@TnGovern @peterdaou @GOP Well how about the elections coming up the Dems were losing ground. We have to wait and see what happens.
@jssjanetss @krassenstein In the words of Aerosmith " Dream On"
@oregon_writer @krassenstein So does Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder.
@CelestialZenith @krassenstein @Simonsaysmore As always guilty till proven innocence is the left's mantra.
@bearcats03 @BillWeirCNN 1st of all we have guest worker programs for farm workers everything is legal. White people do hotel and motel work, I guess you only stay at them in big cities, and All colors of people use to work in construction, till the illegals started coming in  after Katrina .
@hhammaly @metskrause @harikondabolu Nope America did not have welfare back then you helped yourself or you died.
@galenh @AriBerman @IVoteForWomen @davidhogg111 @GreatBlueWave Racist !racist !racist! Russia! Russia ! Russia! Give it a break!
@Vynestra @cameron_kasky You don't live in Florida so your opinion does not matter.
@JimmyAnonymous2 @mike_pence @Jimmy if you look at the caravan you will see very few families mostly young men. Why don't they stay and try to make a better country?
@DGComedy @MichaelAvenatti I bet the judge who just told Avenatti he owes 4.5 million to a partner wants to see Avenatti's tax returns also.
@Cleomsf @amber_athey Really why do women need safe spaces aee tey that delicate?
@David1960Tx @RandPaul @maggieNYT Obama  did not do anything when American citizens were beheaded by ISIS. Let the gov. sort this out.
@MyPalHalTheHack @RandPaul @maggieNYT What about them they need to go home with their  parents.
@detoxoutdoors @RandPaul @maggieNYT Detox what do you want the gov. to do start another war and get our children killed over one non US Citizen?
@MichaelAvenatti @CharlieDaniels And I guess your porn client could have said no to Trump if this happened . She didn't care if he was married did she? she is as much to blame as he is,
@marklevinshow The CDC needs to issue a warning the TDS is becoming a epidemic.
@pillay_dee @BKnight561 @StormyDaniels Ms Daniels is not looking out for any woman if she wants their boyfriend or husband she will go after them.
@JuliaJanzen @ananavarro And the Democrats are not true Democrats anymore.
@Felgraf_Physics @tonyhuneyc @EthanGandhi @ananavarro nothing is going on with Medicare and Social Security. Obama took out 750 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obama Care.
@TeenVogue It was also known for murder and many illegal things please tell the whole story, some of us lived through those times.
@sam_says_2 @CamEdwards No The confederates were all pardoned  and they went back to their homes and made this country great again!
@indietv @HamptonsLowLife @CamEdwards @seanmdav No he was a great General. By the way my ancestors fought with Grant .
@Mamadoxie @CamEdwards @Pamelajn922 @Mamadoxie I agree that was a long time ago and we should all be proud of our ancestors no matter what side they were on.
@AmericanGriper @Mamadoxie @CamEdwards @Pamelajn922 They were not traitors and if you study the Civil War you might learn something oh and by the way  my gg grandfather fought under Grant with the Army of the Tennessee.
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Because he does not have to be a lawyer and neither does anyone on the Supreme Court.
@camanpour @HillaryClinton Sad, Sad, Sad, Give it up.
@brianstelter @JackofBFP @GCDickens @CNN Well at least the Replublicans wouldn't be rioting in the street and crying.
@brianstelter Yep it sure was, shows us what TDS looks like.
@GayleBfromSoCal @BarstoolNewsN @BetoORourke I don't care what they look like just that they do the people's will.
@KenDilanianNBC @_waleedshahid Still a sore loser? California and New York should not be able to rule the rest of the Country.
@mattyglesias @_waleedshahid This is  why our Founding Fathers choose the electorial college knowing some time in the future people on the left would want to do away with our laws because they lost a election.
@yeselson @_waleedshahid Majority does not rule in this Republic!
@_waleedshahid Yes we are well aware of Soros. A very powerful and evil man.
@_waleedshahid Old America is not dying but some people want it to but they will not succeed.
@odbair @MhaoYeager @PrisonPlanet @wastroud How do you you don't even know the man. He's intitled to his opinion and unfortunatley so are you.
@PrisonPlanet https://t.co/HBtAJdcZo2 is what you get when you think you are special.
@MichaelAvenatti No all women is not correct. We can think for ourselves.
@MichaelAvenatti @waltshaub @CoryBooker Yes it's under attack from the Left.
@MichaelAvenatti @Zigmanfreud Next time like this clown show it may be a father,brother or son. You don't change your story after swearing under penalty of perjury.
@AlanDersh @MichaelAvenatti Mr. Dershowitz is a great scholar. He knows the law. You sir could get a few pointers from him.
@pickerel1701 @nytopinion I think a white woman.
@nytopinion The woman who wrote this hit piece looks white to me. Does she not know that by being white she is a racist?
@TrancewithMe @UmbertoBagg We have heard about him check out what he did as teenager during WW2, You better check him out he is no friend of America.
@leeleeb50 @Jillian1008 Good.
@MichaelAvenatti Isn't there a saying thats all fair in love and war? This Battle has been won by the Republicans.
@kelkeith @MichaelAvenatti Don't know about that but you don't have to be a lawyer to be a judge on the Supreme Court. so they can disbar him but that would not matter.
@womensmarch @SenatorCollins This is why you will never all women on your side.
@roseann_cannon @KatrinaPierson I stand with Katrina.
@JillJillmjordan @KatrinaPierson @Donna6499 Sarsour hates America.
@BreitbartNews @DineshDSouza Brain washed white girl.
@jason_howerton I thought that the left women wanted men to shut up why is a man leading these women?
@MichaelAvenatti You better hope your client Swetnick is not brought up on perjury charges.
@DavidKlion Actually the Dems want us to do back to 1692 you know the Salem Witch Trials.
@DavidKlion That would'nt be so bad, People had to work if they wanted to eat instead of getting free things for doing nothing and the young kids would not have time to play on their Iphones.
@AngieMallery @HuffPost No Thanks we don't need any more Amy Schumer's.
@charliekirk11 @CUBoulder Wow and these kids are our future! Brain Washed.
@emrata Accused not convicted.
@WenAcst86 @BeaudoinCharlie @VJBEADS1 @MichaelAvenatti @peaceandteachin @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley Can you prove you are right?And don't use Urban Dictionary it did not come into being until 1999.
@JMZElection @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley Because Ms Ford has not filed a complaint against Kavanaugh in the County where this was supposed to have happen. This is not a Federal matter.
@dbongino Probably not and look at  all the litter .They must have maids at home.
@kylegriffin1 @Morning_Joe How about putting the blame on the parents who let their children come to America alone. These children are in danger from the coyotes aka drug cartel. Congress needs to start making laws to prevent them from coming here.
@DollaDollaBail @MSNBC Hate is bad for your health.
@StephSaysAgain @MSNBC So should the Cartoonist in Illinois.
@perrybarber @MSNBC Nothing wrong with a Dad kissing his daughter on the cheek if you think this is bad boy you have a problem.
@Laser_Cat @MSNBC Wow what hatred!
@SusanStone12 @MSNBC Just because some of the women in the room were sexually assaulted dose not mean the believe every woman who makes a claim are creditable. Does Duke Lacross Team come to mind?
@AmyHeckathorn @ChrisEvans Because that's  how our government laws are. Don't like them  try to change them and good luck on that.
@MichaelAvenatti She is not creditable, she's changing her story.
@MichaelAvenatti @StormyDaniels History will remember her for what she  is and was.
@lilyswan88 @AnaMariaArchil2 @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @CPDAction @BeAHeroTeam She came to this Culture at 17 she was assaulted in Columbia.
@DebraKirschner @AnaMariaArchil2 @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @CPDAction @BeAHeroTeam She was not  sexually assaulted in America she said it was when she was 5. She didn't come to America until she was 17 and her org. is funded by George Soros.
@HarberRay @AnaMariaArchil2 @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @CPDAction @BeAHeroTeam She said she was sexually assaulted when she was 5, Why is she yelling at a US Senator? According to her bio she didn't come to America until she was 17. So this happened in Columbia.
@AmyHeckathorn @ChrisEvans Our Founding Fathers were wise beyond their years to in act the electoral college. New York and California should not be the only states to get to elect the President. This Russian crap has gone far enough pure nonsense.
@AmyHeckathorn @ChrisEvans No the history of Hillary Clinton is not BS some of us were adults when she and Bill came out of Arkansas. We don't need to read history books or newspapers, it was live on tv everyday. We discussed this among friends.
@BRRubin @CChristineFair Protestant Reformation beginning to end 131  years. Islam 7th century to present day 2018.
@CChristineFair Shame on you.
@CChristineFair @TuckerCarlson You don't speak for all women.
@CChristineFair GOP war on women?No's actually the Democrats  who only care about votes.
@MichaelAvenatti @megynkelly She's right.
@MichaelAvenatti Just watch the interview with your client not good!!
@KatrinaPierson @RealSaavedra 5. Fought and died in the Civil War to help free the Slaves.
@AmyHeckathorn @ChrisEvans You got Trump because the people  know the history of Hillary Clinton and A lot of us have lived with her bull for years.
@Bre_payton Way to go Missouri!!
@RonWyden Of course you will I never doubt it for a second you are a Democrat.
@RonWyden Some states have mail in paper ballots!
@CyrusMMcQueen @mfinmac And socialism isn't? Actually  some  liberal  kids today hold on to their parents shadows they are so afraid.
@chelseahandler @mfinmac Are they coming to stay at your house?
@debsglory @jimsciutto @CNNnewsroom Every generation have different words and meanings nowadays the words are used for sex terms tell a lot of us about the newer generation.
@eddyman1 @jimsciutto @CNNnewsroom @Kavanaugh Don't  women want to be equal? Well then he has every right to throw the question back at the felmale senator.
@KeithOlbermann You been doing this for 40 years and still don't have the hang of it yet.
@Keith335 @xtrixcyclex @Snapandbud @RadioFreeTom @amyklobuchar How do you know no one ever said "alumnus" are you all seeing?
@sarahwoodwriter Kavanaugh says he goes with the law, Roe vs Wade is law. Perhaps Trump needs to put a different judge up for the Supreme Court like a woman who wants to overturn Roe vs Wade.
@maura @bessbell Yea since only 1999 not a reliable source for meaning of culture words before then.
@foxandfriends Did Joy forgot she's white?
@charliekirk11 Wow such angry people with nothing else to do.
@Allison_Burnett @MichaelAvenatti well if these facts are true, she was 19-20 at the time did she supply the booze? She knew the punch was spiked did she supply the booze? went 10 to 11 times and seen the line of boys and never said anything and neither did the other party goiers? She herself got raped really ?
@kindNotWeak2018 @RadioFreeTom Urban Dictionary started 1999 17 years after he was in high School mute point.
@Keith335 @xtrixcyclex @Snapandbud @RadioFreeTom @amyklobuchar No he did not lie words in culture can change over time and kids can make up their own meaning of the same words. Kids in different areas of the Country also have the same words with different meanings. And most of you weren't even born back then.
@ewadswor @soychicka @dcpoll @RadioFreeTom @DebraMessing Urban Dictionary did not come into being until 1999, I saw words in there that we use to say that donot have the same meaning now.
@dcpoll @RadioFreeTom @DebraMessing It was back then meanings in culture change with time.
@LauraGS14 If you think Hillary Clinton cares one iota about any of you you are either young or naive because her goal in life was to be president she cares about none but herself.
@LauraGS14 Nope he is not delusional. Women have sons and husbands and fathers and the majority of women want to here both sides before makeing a decision.
@KayleeM23 @MoarCryptoPls @BuzzFeedNews She wasn't in high school she was in college and was about 19-20 years old then.
@JessicaValenti @ambertamblyn Good Morning to my beloved male family.
@Alyssa_Milano @ambertamblyn Yes they vote but not always the way you think. Just because someone is a woman does'nt mean they feel the same as you.
@Maya__Salam @ambertamblyn Well if she didn't want to tell her story why did the Dems leak it out? Seems like she got assulted again by the Left.
@AP @ambertamblyn And she came off as being a little girl.
@ambertamblyn Some  Lefty women are wageing a war on women not men.
@SadeCiera @dchundley @KirstenPowers Ford couldn't remeber much either.
@SadeCiera @dchundley @KirstenPowers Same old talking points from the sheep how did he perjure himself?
@KirstenPowers Just so you know Republican women voted these "white men" to be their voice in Washington.
@wwredpepper @CuomoPrimeTime If he was calm you would have called him a wimp!
@crazyrayu @CuomoPrimeTime @FBI Razor did you watch a differwnt hearing than I did?
@LyYvLa @Atkampeter @marie5483 @CuomoPrimeTime You do that the Urban Dictionary came into existance in 1999 about 18 years  later and all teens have words that meant something  different back then than it does now.
@MichaelAvenatti @DuffySoapbox @tedcruz Mr Avenatti if Cruz is acting like it's the 1940s then he's a good guy, you know when young men , farmers, store clerks, factory workers of all backgrounds went off to war and shead their red white and blue blood on foreign soil so future generations could have freedom.
@MichaelAvenatti How are you going to spin the fact your cleint was sued for sexaully harrashment against 2 men and fraud  in 2000?
@KathyWinkler2 @MichaelAvenatti He's more likely  he will bring his own self down.
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Hey Dersh is a Liberal but he is fair with the law unlike you.
@YOURWRITECO What it means now and in the early 80s is different. Urban Dictionary was founded in 1999.
@ReebokATL  You do know that your 3 some in your world is different than in the 80's In my world back then never heard of these words.
@theblaze Bunch a stupid people wasteing their money.
@markberman You do stay out of politics as a Judge but this is a personal hit job.
@GovHowardDean Yea I remember your run for president.
@seungminkim @peterjhasson Oh yes it is, for too long the Dems have doing this stuff to the Republicans .
@KatiePavlich Wow Graham is mad!!!! Finally some backbone from the Republicans!
@andylassner Her's my take you know nothing!
@mamapainterhard @sarahkendzior @RosieM1919 Don't like when people judge other people guilty before they know all the facts.
@brendaboone21 @sarahkendzior You didn't see Judge Thomas hearing did you thought not.
@CarolTragash @whyweiss @sarahkendzior Don't watch.
@DesertButtercup @KirLeiby @sarahkendzior Are we watching the same hearing? You can see the love on her face.
@LauraGS14 @sarahkendzior Just your opinion and he has been in court longer than you have been alive.
@RayRedacted @sarahkendzior It's a witch hunt, Salem all over again.
@WayneDupreeShow She may hate men her father was a lousy dad.
@KatiePavlich Senator Hirono has a lot of issues check out her bio and about her father,
@RileyJayDennis Too many good men and women have died so you can spout your nonesense.
@KatiePavlich Why would Blumenthal tell the truth. He's a liar about serving in Vietnam.
@ACTBrigitte Yes he is a lying man.
@KatiePavlich Lying Sen. Blumenthal is on tv now. I had friends die in Vietnam  and lost two great friends die of complications of Agent Orange. I had to leave the room.
@jason_howerton @ChrisCuomo @MichaelAvenatti I guess Avenatti didn't read the statement his client swore to  about gang rape and boys lining up outside rooms. Aventatti clearly needs to get his facts straight
@jason_howerton @ChrisCuomo @MichaelAvenatti Avenatti said his client didn't know what was going on but she describes boys standing in line she was about 19-20 at the time I don't think she was that dumb.
@TomSteyer I bet you like your tax cuts.
@TomSteyer You are a corporation who is attempting to buy our democracy. You were  also a investor in the Keystone Pipeline,
@robreiner Maybe you should wait till we hear from both of them tomorrow, you already claimed him guilty hope nobody in Hollywood feels the same about you.
@ryanjreilly Did not write in cursive is that a clue to how old this person is? I don't know just asking
@NataIS @russ53616 @JessicaValenti Please get your facts straight Ms Swetneck was 19-20 years old when she said she was attending parities with 16-17 years olds. In the US a woman is a adult at 18.
@TeamCavuto And they should why a 19-20 year old is going to parties with 16-17 years old and went to 10 parties saw illegal activity and never said a word.
@FreeBirdApr1957 @FLGovScott What ha Nelson done for Florida?
@VetResistor @CluneEsq @AC360 Majority of Americans? Speak for yourself.
@Gaia80001 @CluneEsq @AC360 @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski How do you know she will tell the truth were you there when it happened?
@RevDrBowen @frankthorp @ThomasARoberts The people voted it does not matter what you and I think,
@joyouswarrior @frankthorp Grassley is in charge and has the authority to do it.
@psychanne @JackTorres00 @jMicheleeee No they will take us in the wrong direction. Everyone will be guilty until proven innocence
@TeamPelosi They will stand with women who have been truly assaulted until then  They will reserve their judgement on this case until both parties testify.
@polemicintent @SethAbramson @MichaelAvenatti Oh the will find something on Avenatti before that. This has opened up the flood gates.
@JeffRieder1 @SethAbramson Could work the other way and turn the senate red.
@MsPackyetti @SenGillibrand Why does Ms Ford keep delaying?
@SenGillibrand Oh yes women are paying attention. but I will not jump to conclusions until we hear both sides.
@girlgeek_rva @rsteade @annadromaeosaur @StrangelyLiterl Really being a successful adult professional woman means you can't lie? than by your logic  being a successful adult professional man can't lie either.
@AngelaBelcamino @CChristineFair Not going to happen.
@krassenstein WE Believe Kavanaugh
@CillizzaCNN !st of all FBI has no jurisdiction over this matter and then why are'nt you taking on Keith Ellison? There's more evidence againnst him than Kavanaugh.
@is_kathie @Lawrence @I_am_katertott why isn't she willing to testfy is she innocent?
@Lawrence Because he is smarter than you. He knows that the FBI has no jurisdiction over this matter.
@MarvinDigeorgio @imprisonTrump45 @ananavarro She has a lot to gain keeping the judge from becoming a Supreme Court Justice.	 Polygraph tests are not reliable. How come she can't give details about when this happened, the house , you know evidence.
@imprisonTrump45 @brianefallon Me too that this is a attempt to stall the Judge's votes.
@CoolRich59 @brianefallon I agree about the former aide says everything.
@kelly_joslin @maziehirono @GOP You answered your own question Allegedly!!
@maziehirono Dear Senator, millions and millions of women in this Country have sons. Telling men to shut up will not sit  well with millions of them,besides do you have proof what Dr, Ford said is true if so then let the American people see it. You may alienate a lot of women.
@marg76379576 @maziehirono I do not, not enough evidence.
@gogriffsgo32 @benyc North
@chick_in_kiev If women want to equal to men you have to take the heat.
@haleakela19 @NormEisen You quote a Comedian?

@dRiveraCash @TuckerCarlson Be careful what you wish for today you want Fox shut down tomorrow someone else may want you shut down.
@KamalaHarris you obvious haven't looked at the laws or you know what you said is not true. Educate you self on trucking rules please.
@maxywon @jandtee @TuckerCarlson Not a good scenario, colleges have many students that are not US Citizens then and now. We are talking about  out here in America .

@Kimgtrue2me @SenKamalaHarris He will be only 1 judge and cannot change the laws all by himself.
@ElizabethJeser1 Yea I get it only humans with the same point of view as you have.
@KatiePavlich I am sorry Fox but I turn the channel when he came on.
@Butters_Moore @HoarseWisperer @MalcolmNance @USAttyBash How do you know she has a 3rd grade mental capacity since she is a Lawyer and you are?

@SethAbramson The right got Sotomayer and Kagan so now it's your turn to cry.

@cdkang76 @DianaBowen Where was Justice Kagans records?
@DianaBowen I wish someone would invent a time machine to go back when women had no birth control. They  were the real deal. Women today have so much more than our mothers grandmothers and g grandmothers and sometime come off to other people as spoiled brats.
@DianaBowen @SenWarren Lots of non workers today visiting the hearing.
@importantmeagan Dems are not in control so the Reps will do what they want.
@dawnlaguens Do you have proof that the majority of people do not want Kavanaugh confirmed? No I don't think so.
@krassenstein Who gives a dang!
@imliving @jzikah @JordanUhl @Am_Ledger Same on the left.

@DunwickLona @IrishNewsHound Wow you mean that all those republicans are throwing garbage in the river I will bet its those people  who live there.
@LauraLom234 @louis_5466 @moonpieluva @politico Florida has been very good with the Governors they have had especially when they have had hurricanes.

@LillyDiabetes Really Lilly dropping Conor Daly for something his Dad said in the 80s is truly dumb. Can you verify that none of your employees in the last 40 years has ever said a racist word?
@Jennife06465352 @CRTV @AnnCoulter @ericbolling He was here illegally end of story. Maybe check out what  some men south of the border think about their women and they bring that mind set here.
@krassenstein Went to your website to see who your sponsors were. So who's funding it George Soros?
@MikeSco42149142 @mattdpearce Laura understands that this is a country of immigrants but that those in the past assimilated. They did not speak their native language in public and learned English and did not fly their home  flags on US soil
@McNaughtonArt Love your painting!

@krassenstein Michael Avenatti will not run too many skeletons  in his closet.
@krassenstein The government cannot prevent shootings it has to be done on the local level.
@krassenstein  Today 14,000 legal immigrants will become citizens see I fixed it for you.
@ChrisCuomo Left the Dem party you and rest have gone too far left.
@michellebhasin Boko Haram kidnapped the girls  held them for years and  raped them. So stupid to compare.
@michellebhasin Ms Sanders was only doing what people on the left do every day. Tweet.
@theintercept  Africans were slaves and had no choice. those who illegally cross our border and  had a choice.
@iamfonda Hey Peter you are rich and have a big home why don't you put your money to good use and invite about 50 of these illegals families to come live with you till this is all solved.
@TonyFly @atrupar Really sick!!!
@TBSNetwork Samantha Bee needs to be fired.
@marthamaccallum @therealroseanne @RealCandaceO If you are on the wrong side of politics this is what always happens.
@charliekirk11 Maybe the right needs to start boycotting sponsors of these shows like Joy Reid and the View.
@Publix  I  can't believe you caved to the bullies hope you don't loose too many customers
@notianrapoport @TomiLahren @foxandfriends Do you only like Liberal women. Calling her a name only 	strengthens the argument against the left.
@notianrapoport @marklevinshow The hate needs to stop on both sides .
@CleverTitleTK @geni Got be careful sometimes there a lot of mistakes in family trees verify with other sources.
@CleverTitleTK First I will begin by saying there's no way to be 100% sure Christine Hertel could not speak English.The census are not always accurate. There a several 	discrepancies in the 1900-1930 census for Fred and Christine Hertel.
@MikeJMacco @CleverTitleTK For free start with https://t.co/cXzDIxXOxM. Type in your ancestor census go from 1840 to 1940 and go from there.
Bayer just lost me as a customer.
