@taylor_newbold I agree. The U. S. government should stay out of this. We've made a complete mess of Central America. The Venezuelan people elected their leader. That's democracy. It's not our place to tell them that they are wrong and that they should have the leader we want for them.

@graywolflaw @GlennKesslerWP @dzengles As a resident of Louisiana, I can tell you that you are correct. Corruption by our politicians is considered par for the course. The people here are so accustomed to the corruption, lies, and poor leadership, that they are suspicious of anyone who is trying to make a difference.

@ForecasterEnten Because Beto ran against Cruz, who is known by more people than Kemp. Also, the Senate has a more far-reaching impact nationally than a governor. Not to mention that Beto was pretty cool in his youth.
