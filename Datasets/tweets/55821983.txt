@inclusionist @GregRichane @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton My point was the Clinton and New Dem record overall. They created AmeriCorps, urban and rural empowerment zones, &amp; Individual Development Accounts. Restricted public charge coverage. And greatly expanded EITC. Did much more to address poverty than traditional Dems of 80s and 90s
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton @IndivarD A few states. including Arkansas under Clinton, did implement some useful, progressive,  reforms, but Congressional Dems did not lead on this.
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton @inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton @IndivarD Self-described liberals, who blew off reforming welfare in a progressive manner, when they were in power, share some of the balme for conservatives later implementing punitive reforms.
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton @inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton @IndivarD I think one key aspects missing from this discussion was how broken the AFDC program was before reform, not just for taxpayers, but for recipinets as well. Most welfare recipients hated welfare.
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton Important to note that 93 Clinton budget -- passed without a single GOP vote -- included a very large increase in EITC benefits that significantly reduced poverty for low-income workers.
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton Bill Clinton later said that he should have pushed welfare reform before health care reform, under the Dem Congress, and I agree with that.  Welfare reform should have included a boatload of new money for child care, job training, and job subsides - as Clinton originally wanted
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton For the record, I have srongly challenged the impact of welfare reform: https://t.co/HmMJWcvqmV
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton As for the 1994 crime bill, 26 of the 38 voting members of the Back Caucus in the House voted for it. Yes, it includes dreadful provisions, but it also banned assault weapons, funded the Violence Against Women Act, and  funded youth activities widely derided by the Right.
@inclusionist @TazraMitchell @ChelseaClinton By the time Bill Clinton left the Presidency, African American and Latino poverty had reached all-times lows.  There were plenty of problems with welfare reform, especially after he left office, but your characterization of the effort does not reveal its full impacts
@GOPLeader .@GOPLeader Lincoln died 153 years ago. That's long way to go back to find an exemplary Republican.
@TazraMitchell @inclusionist @ChelseaClinton There is no doubt that racism has been used to sell cuts in social programs, even when the greatest numbers of recipients are white. But its also wrong to suggest that any discussion at all about reforming social programs is inherently racist. Most POC would fervently disagree.
@TazraMitchell @inclusionist @ChelseaClinton It is well-documented that the Republicans have used racist language regarding social programs for decades, as I have repeatedly denounced: https://t.co/btEfZ9fm8N  But its inaccurate to say Bill Clinton did.
@TazraMitchell @inclusionist @ChelseaClinton Then how do you explain that welfare reform, as originally proposed by Bill Clinton (with more more for child care and job training) as a way to reduce poverty, was -- and is -- broadly supported by people of color?
@inclusionist @ChelseaClinton .@inclusionist @ChelseaClinton This proves my point. By featuring, 11 white people and 2 Back people at the ceremony, Clinton went to great lengths to not make this about race. And you seem to discard the evidence that effort was widely popular among African Americans.

In other words, vast inequality will eventually harm even the wealthy, and house of cards will -- yet again -- fall.
But the reality is that, when such a massive percentage of the U.S. population lives in or near poverty, they are unable to purchase many of the goods and services of that the economy produces, which means the economy is actually fundamentally unsound.
Yet even though about half of U.S. households earned less than what is generally considered to be middle class, much of the media continued to report that the ‚Äúfundamentals of the economy were sound,‚Äù mostly because the stock market was roaring and unemployment was low.
In 2017, 10.7% of U.S households earned below $15k annually. Another 9.6% earned below $25k, another 9.2% below $35k, and another 13.3% below 50K. That meant, in total, nearly half of U.S. households earned below $50k.

To better compete in rural America, Dems need to equally improve their policies, messaging, and on-the-ground outreach on rural America.  Most importantly, party needs to prove it cares about such areas and shares key values such as community.
If Dems want to build a truly durable House majority, win back the Senate, and win key Electoral College prizes like Ohio and Florida, they must be more competitive in rural areas, if not winning them, at least not losing them by 50 point margins
There are no obvious leader choices because so few Dem members are rural
Instead of hand-wringing over the ages of the House Dem leadership, there should be hand-wringing  that none of the Dem leaders represent mostly rural districts, where Dems are increasingly getting shellacked, despite suburban gains.

All the truly effective protests in history ‚Äî including those led  by Susan B. Anthony, MLK, and Gandhi ‚Äî focused outage into a smart strategy to win over the public by focusing on mainstream values such as fairness, justice, faith, community, and equality.
Some say even protests that alienate the public are useful because they empower protestors to feel they ‚Äústood up against injustice.‚Äù But if the injustice is even indirectly facilitated by such protests, in the long run, the protests will feel even more disempowered.

Some on the Right imply that federal tax fraud isn‚Äôt a serious crime but it‚Äôs among the most serious of crimes because it‚Äôs stealing from every one of your fellow 326 million Americans.
Kavanaugh and his supporters have repeatedly use his anti-hunger volunteerism as supposed proof that he is too good a person/ or too busy a person to have committed sexual assault.  Media really should check out his volunteerism claims.
Further given that Kavanaugh coaches basketball a few nights a week, serves on a parochial school board that likely meets on weeknights, and claims to be a Washington Nationals season tickets holder, does he also ‚Äúregularly‚Äù volunteer on Wednesday late afternoons/ early nights?
But the program in question only uses volunteers on Wednesdays from 4:15 - 6:15 p.m. It is a 10 minute drive or 20 minute walk from the court at which Kavanaugh works. I assume most high-ranking federal judges rarely get off wok that early,
Media: please investigate the veracity of the claim of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs and his supporters ‚Äî- which they have made repeatedly ‚Äî that he ‚Äúregularly‚Äù volunteered at a certain program that feeds low-income people in DC. A pro- Kavanaugh ad even features a photo of him volunteering.

I am a beyond disgusted that Kavanaugh cited his volunteer work at a soup kitchen as supposed evidence he couldn‚Äôt have committed sexual assault.
So is Kavanaugh's official position as a judge that, anyone accused of criminal activity should be set free if the investigation and trial can't be completed in ten days, they should be set free?
So Kavanaugh's top defense is, consider all the nights I was too busy to comnit sexual assult, and look at all the women I didn't sexually assault?
So Kananaugh's sworn testimony is that -- over decades -- he never once went somewhere spontaneously?
Kavanaugh says he wasn't even in Ford's social circles. But Ford testified she knew his close friend Mark Judge.  This is the zillionth reason Mark Judge should be interviewed by the FBI and then testify before the Committee, under oath.
If a clear, serious crime is committed, and both the victim and perpetrator are clear, what the frig difference does it matter how the people who first were told of the crime immediately responded?
Women who are sexual assault victims and Black men shot/assaulted by the police are the only U.S. crime victims who are regulary treated as they are the criminals.

@seungminkim .@seungminkim So there argument is that alleged felony sexual assault and potential rape isn‚Äôt a problem is the alleged assualter and rapist wasn‚Äôt caught earlier?
If Kavanaugh did commit sexual assault and attempted rape at 17, the question is not whether he should be criminally prosecuted now. The question is whether  this ‚Äîas well as his clear perjury ‚Äî should deprive him of a lifetime seat of our nation‚Äôs highest court of law.
@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 Long before you joined Trump‚Äôs campaign payroll, he called for death penalty for Central Park Five for their alleged sexual assaults. They were all younger than Kavanaugh was alleged to be. They were proven innocent, but the Right is selective on juvenile crime.
@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 60,000 juveniles, many much younger than 17 (the age Kavanaugh was at the time of this alleged felony) are incarcerated today.  Do you support freeing them all immediately?
If the Trump and GOP claim that 17 is too young for criminal ‚Äî and moral ‚Äî  responsibility for crimes, will they call for the immediate release of the 60,000 juveniles (many much younger than 17) now incacerated in the U.S.?
17 is old enough to enlist in U.S. military, where you make life or death decisions, about your-self, your fellow soldiers, and civilians. The Right better not claim that 17 is too young to be held accountable for sexual assault and attempted rape.
So it‚Äôs come to this: the nominee for a lifetime seat on the highest court of law in the land has been credibly accused, on record, of felony sexual assault and attempted rape. He was nominated by a man who bragged, on tape, of engaging in serial sexual assault.

Trump called for the death penalty for the 14 and 15 year olds of Central Park Five accused of sexual assault. Kavanaugh was older than that when he allegedly committed sexual assault. If it‚Äôs true, his youth at the time no excuse. Btw, the Central Park 5 we‚Äôre proven innocent
I have no idea if it‚Äôs true that Kavanaugh committed  sexual assaults in high school, but it useful to note that the G.O.P. has repeatedly pushed to imprison minors and for lifetime bans on benefits to  people who commit crimes, even when they are very young.

Kavanaugh just claimed that he barely heard of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a quite famous Right-wing legal advocacy group. Shouldn't repeatedly testifying falsely at a confirmation hearing, in and of itself, disqualify, any nominee?
How can Kavanaugh claim, as his just did, that he knows, for sure, that Trump conducted a very widespread search for his SCOTUS pick, but claim, as he also just did, that knows nothing about the role of the Federalist Society in the process, even though Society picked him?

On most key moral and practical issues facing the country, McCain was on wrong side of history. Yes, he voted against Obamacare repeal in the end, but he overwhelmingly voted for a knee-jerk far-Right agenda. His reputation as a "moderate maverick" was mostly a self-invention
Nothing did more to pave the way for Trump &amp; Trumpism in GOP than elevation of Palin. McCain also was one of few to vote against MLK holiday. He opposed LGBT people serving  in military.  He gave up on both immigration &amp; climate change work after pressure from Right. No moderate.
We should both honor McCain for his service to the nation, and frankly admit the grave harm his political career brought to the country.  His Palin pick alone should forever taint him in history. Her rallies on McCain's behalf were hate fests, &amp; McCain never publicly rebuked her.
Now that McCain was properly buried with respect, we can critically assess his mostly negative political legacy. He was cheerleader for multiple, catastrophic wars, did nothing as GOP blocked even consideration of judge Merrick Garland, and he foisted Sarah Palin on America.

@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump Just a reminder: fighting in court by insisting you are innocent is only admirable if you are actually innocent. Just because you always have a right to plead not guilty doesn‚Äôt make that the right thing to do if you know you are guilty as hell.
@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump FYI, Mr. President, the norm for a leader in such a instance is to condemn the crimes, say you are horrified and feel betrayed by someone you trusted, not to excuse the criminal behavior and praise your former staffer for refusing to admit responsibility.
@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump If anyone is looking for a good President, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of anyone who long retained the services of Michael Cohen!
@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump So how many years ago would it have been just fine and dandy for your campaign chair to have failed to pay taxes and to have committed bank fraud to cover-up payments from a dictator aligned with an U.S. enemy?
@thehill .@thehill As an anti-hunger advocate constantly fighting against GOP cuts in nutrition assistance programs, I must note the irony that my tax dollars are helping to feed Manafort and will soon help feed Cohen.
It‚Äôs horrible when anyone gets murdered, but it‚Äôs amazing how much more attention young white women get when they are murdered
Federal tax fraud is arguably one of the most heinous non-violent crimes, since you are literally stealing from all 325 million Americans.
More inportantly, on a moral level, tax fraud is abominable. My father taught me that when people don‚Äôt pay their fair share of taxes, they are just not ripping off some amorphous government, but they are also stealing from their neighbors.
Plus, as a ‚Äúimage‚Äù professional, surely you understand it is horrible optics for a wealthy person such as yourself to downplay the importance of massive tax fraud by a wealthy person such as Cohen.
.@DonnyDeutsch @Morning_Joe @morningmika  Donny: While it is commendable that you are defending a personal friend, please get your facts correct. When Trump directed Cohen to commit the crimes in counts #7 &amp; #8, Trump was a mere candidate, not President.
As you know the First Amendment protects all of our rights to petition (lobby) government.  I hope we always clearly distinguish between lobbying that is free, deon ratio expression versus lobbying that is paid conlfict of interest.
.@SenWarren Serious question: Would your bill ban all lobbying or just lobbying that is financial conflict of interest by former officials? For instance, would you ban a former progressive USDA Secretary from lobbying for free against SNAP cuts?
For decades, many Americans have believed the false, facile narrative that all politicians are equally crooked, so nothing matters. Among the worst things Trump has done (out of a very long, horrid list) is advance the fake narrative that undermines the very essence of democracy.
Melania is trolling Donald only as much as Marie Antionette was trolling Louis the XVI. In other words, not at all. Unless you believe ‚ÄúLet them Eat Cake‚Äù was not a clueless diss of the masses, but some secret co-sign with revolutionaries. Not.

@marcorubio .@marcorubio Can‚Äôt the free market fix this?
It is thus wrong to extrapolate ‚Äì either positively or negatively ‚Äì as to what Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs primary win means for the nationwide general election.
In swing Congressional Districts in off-year elections, a candidate	needs about 60,000 votes to win a general election. That‚Äôs about 4 times the	amount of votes you need to win a primary.
Crowley garnered about 3,000 fewer votes than fellow incumbent Clarke.  Only 1 in 20 Dem voters in Crowley‚Äôs district showed up to vote for him.  This is the latest proof that big city political machines are mostly dead.
I personally like Joe Crowley and he generally (but not always) supported progressive causes, but most astounding was the near total collapse of his ‚Äì and the Queens‚Äô Dem party‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúmachine‚Äù ‚Äì appeal to actual Democratic Party voters.
Moreover, Ocasio-Cortez‚Äôs win ‚Äì which has been portrayed as a great victory of mass political mobilization ‚Äì may have actually been possible because of LOW overall primary turn-out.
But Ocasio-Cortez is now a household name and Bunkeddeko (for now) is largely forgotten.
In the NYS 11 CD in Brooklyn, out of the about 347,466 registered Democratic Party voters, 318,931 (92%) didn‚Äôt vote, 14,804 (4.2%) voted for Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, and 13,729 (3.9%) voted for challenger Adem Bunkeddeko (who was endorsed by the NY Times).
These numbers in no way take away from the historic, inspiring victory of Ocasio-Cortez, nor do they in any way diminish the reality &amp; importance of a progressive resurgence in the Dem Party. But they do show somewhat fickle nature of who makes history and who becomes footnote
In the Ocasio-Cortez v. Crowley primary, of the about 235,745 registered Democrats in the district, 208,107 (88%) didn‚Äôt vote in the primary,	15,877 (7%) voted for Ocasio-Cortez, and 11,761 (5%) voted for Crowley.

I don‚Äôt know which is the scarier option: 1) the House G.O.P. knows reality and is  engaged in a craven attempt to keep power and/ or cover up their own crimes; or 2)  they have actually convinced themselves what they are saying is true and they actually believe it all.
I am finally watching Strzok hearing in C-SPAN. Truly astonishing perversion of reality.If  House GOP was the investigator on the Orient Express, instead of actually investigating, they would have spent their whole time trying to convince us the murdered person committed suicide.
So it turns out that overall, snobbish connoisseurship is completely compatible with populism, at least when it comes to music. Who knew?
For instance, the most famous blues artists ‚Äì Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williams (both I and II), Bessie Smith, Howling Wolf, BB King, John Lee Hooker, Lightnin‚Äô Hopkins, Robert Johnson ‚Äì were generally better than the totally obscure ones.
As for U.S. music, while I‚Äôve found some true ‚Äúundiscovered‚Äù gems over the years -- mostly by people of color and/or rural people who are usually overlooked by the elites who run the music industry ‚Äì the large majority of the best artists and music in America are well-known.
Now, I am not including in this point international musicians who are big stars in their homelands but relatively unknown in the U.S.  ‚Äì One of the biggest thrills of my life has been getting to know them
I will even make this claim that is both radical and reactionary: out of  the top 100 British songs of the 1960‚Äôs, I‚Äôd say at least 90 are by  three bands: the Beatles, the Stones, and the Who.
Yet I must finally admit this: the songs and artists generally regarded by critics as the greatest generally ARE the greatest.
I've spent decades obsessively collecting music ‚Äì especially R&amp;B, rock, blues, roots, jazz, &amp; world music ‚Äìwith a near-fanatical quest to find undiscovered masterpieces for forgotten genius.

@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump Many have already pointed out that the phrase ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù was associated with Stalin‚Äôs USSR, Mao‚Äôs China, &amp; Hitler‚Äôs Germany. Do you approve of any ‚Äî or all ‚Äî of those murderous dictatorships, collectively responsible for tens of millions of deaths?
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump So your position is both that this never happened and its Obama‚Äôs fault? #stablegenius
For those in GOP who think defending Trump and illegal GOP campaign acts now is really smart politics, they may want to check out the results of the mid-term election of 1974.
For a moment, forget that speaking out against foreign government interference in our elections is the right thing to do morally and patriotically.  For any GOP leader, doing so now is also imperative for their political preservation.
The hard evidence is now crystal clear that the Russian government wanted to help Trump steal the Presidency &amp; GOP steal Congressional elections.  The best ‚Äî the best ‚Äî GOP defense at this point is that they were unwitting dupes. Is that really the hill they want to die on?
People often overuse the terms ‚Äútreason‚Äù and ‚Äútraitor‚Äù but working with the government of a foreign enemy to undermine fair and free elections in your own country pretty much fits the textbook definition of those words.
@realDonaldTrump .@realDonaldTrump I am note sure of your point here. So if you and/or your campaign committed crimes in the last few months of the Obama Administrstion, that‚Äôs Obama‚Äôs fault?
When people on the Right today say they just want judges ‚Äúwho follow the Constitution,‚Äù they are usually clueless as to what the text does or does not say. What they really mean is they want judges who will keep rich, white, men in charge.
The most famous self-professed leader of Constitutional ‚Äúoriginalism‚Äù or ‚Äútextualism‚Äù - Justice Scalia - would often ignore key words on the Constitution ‚Äî or give them modern meanings the framers could never have intended ‚Äî just to advance his political views.
When people claim today definitive knowledge of what either text means on a specific modern issue, it just so happens that they claim the text reinforces their own world view.
The U.S. Constitution was written 231 years ago. The Bible was written thousands of years ago.  On many matters related to contemporary living, neither original text gives us exact guidance about what the authors would specifically want done today.
@NoahCRothman .@NoahCRothman Since you &amp;	others on Right love using the word ‚Äúoriginalism‚Äù coined by Right, please explain how the original text of the Constitution informs justices today on how to rule on cases related to biotechnology patents, war powers to send missles, or net neutrality?

@TalkPoverty @TalkPoverty While it is true that the word ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù is often falsely used (often with racist overtones) by Right  to apply to non-welfare programs, it is not automatically racist to use ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù to specifically refer to just cash aid, which people of all races call welfare.

@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 Twitter is a public forum. You can‚Äôt possibly elect to use a public forum to repeatedly blast Trump and Trumpism without being questioned in that public forum as to why you went to work for Trump as a paid staffer.
@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 So is it your position that it‚Äôs just fine and dandy for Russia to kill journalists, jail political opponents,  invade sovereign nations, and enable war crimes in Syria so long as it‚Äôs not quite as bad as North Korea? Seriously?
@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 True you owe me nothing, but you do owe the public an explanation for your public 180 degree turn. The public record proves Trump did, on multiple occasions, defend Putin killing journalists: https://t.co/OBQzBBWi5Z
@AJDelgado13 .@AJDelgado13 10 months after Trump said on national TV that he was fine that Putin killed journalists    and said U.S did the same, you went to work as a paid staffer  for his campaign. He‚Äôs been a public racist for decades. Please provide explanation for your new wokeness.

@Pinboard .@Pinboard I greatly appreciate your effort to make Congress more progressive, but respectfully,  spending $1.8 million on Dem primaries, two-thirds of which you lost, is not best way to do it. Much more effective would be funding targeted voter registration and enagmenet efforts

Remember that the patron saint of so-called Republican moderates ‚Äî George Herbert Walker  Bush ‚Äî won the Presidency by bashing his opponent for supposedly being against the Pledge of Allegiance and the flag and for furloughing a Black prisoner. Trumpism is not entirely new to GOP
Reality still must matter.  That is all.

When democracies die, it is not because they lose in wars. It‚Äôs because their populaces side idly by as freedom slips away, bit by bit. I am not nearly as bothered by Trump as the I am by the reality that large swaths of U.S. public  are declining to stand up against Trumpism.

If Trump wants to send economic aid to a place he doesn‚Äôt understand and has opposed him fiercely, he can start with the Bronx.
Trump‚Äôs framework for a North Korea deal (stopping nukes, providing economic boost, while doing nothing on human rights) is almost exactly the same as Obama‚Äôs Iran deal, which is utterly despised by Trump and the Right.
