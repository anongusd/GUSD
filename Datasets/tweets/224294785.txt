In order to actually combat gun violence, we must take a long, hard look at making improvements in our society, like repairing our mental health care system &amp; enforcing existing laws. We must stop playing politics w/ legislation that will not benefit the American people.
Today, the House will vote on H.R. 8, a poorly drafted &amp; ill-considered bill that would punish lawful gun owners w/o doing anything to prevent gun violence. I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure &amp; get to work finding REAL solutions to #EndGunViolence.

In order to actually #EndGunViolence, we must look at improvements to our mental health care system &amp; more effectively enforce laws on the books. We should not be wasting time on ineffective bills that only serve to impede upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.
H.R. 8 would make these actions illegal: Loaning a gun to your neighbor, donating a firearm to a museum, gifting a gun to a relative. The bill would even make it a crime to remove firearms from a friend's house, at their request, if they express concerns about suicidal thoughts.
Late last night, I voted against Judiciary Committee passage of H.R. 8, a poorly drafted &amp; ill-considered bill that would punish lawful gun owners without doing anything to prevent gun violence.

I believe that American innovation &amp; our unique entrepreneurial spirit are the keys to meeting the energy challenges of the 21st Century. The President’s proposed ACE plan embraces this outlook &amp; will give Alabama businesses certainty moving forward.
For 8 long years, Alabamians suffered under an overly-empowered EPA that burdened hardworking men &amp; women w/ countless overreaching regulations.
President Trump's plan to roll back the Obama Administration’s so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ represents an important step towards returning power to the states and further dismantling the Obama-era regulatory regime. https://t.co/8YNNepyrGG

Over the last year &amp; a half, Republicans in Congress &amp; the Trump Administration have worked to unleash our economy &amp; foster growth here in the United States. Since November 2016, 3.7 million jobs have been created. 1 million of those came after the #TaxCutsandJobsAct became law.

It’s no secret that Iran has not stopped its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon, and we must take this threat very seriously in our future negotiations with the leading state sponsor of terrorism.
Moving forward, Congress must stand locked-arm in our approach to dealing with this rogue nation for the sake of our national security. I believe it is imperative that we reinstate the economic sanctions against Iran that were in place prior to this nuclear agreement.
I strongly opposed this Obama-era executive agreement, and I support the Trump Administration's efforts to ensure that we truly end Iran's nuclear weapons program.
I've said from the very beginning that the Iran Deal was a flawed, weak deal that serves the interests of bad actors in Iran at the expense of our own.

The new #FarmBill maintains vital nutrition assistance for our most vulnerable Americans when they truly need it while making a commitment to helping them improve their circumstances.
As I told @wsfa12news, this farm bill also includes some important welfare reforms that implement strict work requirements &amp; close categorical eligibility loopholes.

During the 2013 government shutdown, the families of more than a dozen U.S. servicemembers who were killed in action were initially denied military death benefits. During the recent #SchumerShutdown, several more families were impacted in the same way. This should never happen.

This problem is very real, even in Alabama, as the stretch of highway between Birmingham and Atlanta is known to be a "sex trafficking super highway." Adults and children are being bought and sold as slaves in plain sight, and it is happening in our backyard. #EndTrafficking

Now, the Trump-Sessions Justice Dept appears to be following up &amp; taking the evidence seriously. In a letter to Senate Judiciary, Assistant Attorney General (and my former chief of staff) Stephen Boyd requested unreacted documents from the committee's investigation.
Systematically altering abortion procedures to preserve organs and sell them to researchers is against the law. Yet, despite clear evidence and Congressional referrals, the Obama-Lynch Justice Dept looked the other way and declined to investigate.
Finally. I applaud the Department of Justice for opening an investigation into Planned Parenthood's appalling and illegal practice of harvesting &amp; trafficking the body parts of aborted babies. https://t.co/CDiFUU5Hxj

Watch my remarks introducing the Protection &amp; Advocacy for Veterans Act on the House floor live at https://t.co/vr9EtUU5qM
My bill would engage Patient &amp; Advocacy agencies to ensure veterans receive the mental health care &amp; substance abuse treatment they deserve.
We owe it to our veterans to look beyond traditional means and bring all resources to bear in ensuring proper MH &amp; substance abuse treatment
Many might not recall the first "red flag" at the Central Ala VA was a May '14 report showing 52% of mental health patients waiting &gt;14 days
In the VA saga, most remember sensational incidents like the missing X-Rays, manipulated wait lists &amp; the vet who was taken to a crack house

I hope the shocking Army force reduction nationwide serves as a wakeup call to Washington for real world impact of these ill-conceived cuts.
I have fought sequestration from day one, and that fight isn't over. If we don’t fix sequestration, next round of cuts will be more harmful.
Such a strong demonstration of support truly helps me make the case in Washington for protecting the critical mission at Fort Rucker...
I appreciate the work of so many mayors &amp; community leaders in the Wiregrass who rallied support for Fort Rucker as concerns grew about cuts
This is part of the Army's nationwide reduction of 40,000 soldiers caused by sequestration cuts that are hollowing out our military...
Army announces Fort Rucker will have a 186-soldier force reduction over two years. That's 6%, much less than the 40% some had feared...

No, sir. It has been a year. There has been a problem, and they have known about it. But it isn’t fixed. Not even close.
“in terms of managing the VA, where we have seen a problem, where we have been aware of a problem, we have gone in there and fixed it.”
One year ago, @POTUS said hindrance was not knowing abt problems. “This is stuff that is eminently fixable, but we’ve got to know about it"
Why? Because my constituents – my veterans – in Alabama are getting the worst health care service in the country, and they deserve better.
I'm preparing legislation to compel national VA to take over perpetually failing systems like a dept of education takes over failing schools
A lot of promises made by national VA to improve CAVHCS, but once our problems left the front page, there hasn’t been sufficient follow-up
What hasn't happened? Improvement where it matters most for our veterans seeking care at the VA.
A workload report at the end of April showed &gt;6500 consults OVER 90 DAYS were still pending, w/ half awaiting approval for non-VA care
Worst and 2nd worst in the nation, both in the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System.
VA medical centers in Montgomery &amp; Tuskegee were recently identified as worst &amp; 2nd worst nationally for delays in appointment completions
What hasn't happened? Improvement in veteran patients' access to care. Hasn't really happened nationally, certainly not in Central Alabama
systemic waitlist manipulation, missing XRays, falsified records, crack house incident, reform law passed, director fired,VISN chief retires
“This is my administration," @POTUS said a year ago. "I always take responsibility for whatever happens.” Let's review what has happened...
One year ago, @POTUS said, “We’re going to do right by our veterans across the board, as long as it takes..." https://t.co/YUVJqpA5NB

Worth a watch: @wsfa12news coverage of ongoing problems at the Central Alabama VA with a poignant personal angle ➝ http://t.co/SsCNS7KlB6
We need a permanent Central Ala VA system director who is both empowered and willing to change the lousy culture and turn the place around.
As Congress reconvenes next week, I’ll be looking for ways to turn Washington’s attention to the problems in the Central Alabama VA...
I’m done with VA's excuses. When I see these numbers and hear from my Alabama veterans, it is clear more must be done to speed improvements.
All who presided as this scandal occurred must answer the tough questions and be held accountable. Only way to truly deter future wrongdoing
It is remarkable how quietly this major change in VA leadership has occurred, particularly given how troubled the Southeast region has been.
This troubling report comes as Chuck Sepich, the VA's Southeast Network Director overseeing AL, GA &amp; SC has quietly retired...
We want to see improvement in patient outcomes, which is why the AP report is so important. It looks at actual completed VA appointments...
So, the "scheduling" wait time might look okay on paper, but what good is that if the veteran patient never actually got to see a doctor??
Here's what happens at Central Ala VA: veteran schedules an appointment. Then VA calls to cancel &amp; re-book, sometimes at the last minute...
These stats confirm what we are hearing from Alabama veterans: access to care is still atrocious &amp; the scheduling runaround is still rampant
VA medical centers in Montgomery &amp; Tuskegee were worst &amp; 2nd worst nationally for completing appointments &lt;30 days http://t.co/kxErYg1WxX
