@sahilkapur This is how we #SquareUp. We've created an economy where low and middle income people often need two incomes. This is one way to help them get a little further ahead.

@fightfor15 @SEIU Squaring up with workers means we also #SquareUp with local communities. Workers spend money in their local communities if they have it.  Unfortunately it is not "trickling down" as promised, but pooling among a privileged few.  A healthy economy cannot sustain such inequality.
@SherrodBrown This is not just how the chips fall.  It's the result of an economy rigged against the majority of people.  It's time to #SquareUp and restore a social contract that gives #EqualOpportunity to all, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or zip code.

Trump is exposing the danger of congress assuming we'll have a decent person in the Oval Office, and the people deserve much better from the separate, coequal branch of government.
We need a system of #AccountableCapitalism.  Sufficient oversight to ensure fair wages, non-discrimination, rigorous environment protection.  The days of sitting back and hoping for results from a self-policed system of social corporate responsibility is over. https://t.co/IJ7eWCiLYg
This is a great demonstration of the importance of putting your values out there.  Conservatives are never afraid to embrace their ideals, but progressives are supposed to moderate their positions before they even come to the table.  #FightFor15 #Progress https://t.co/8iURfoCWTx
Unfortunately the story of Moira's family is far too common.  Work hard, do everything right, and yet are financially devastated by such an occurrence.  It's time to #SquareUp with Moira's family and all others like it.  They've been carrying an outsized burden for far too long. https://t.co/WEPXePyzsM
@OpenSecretsDC @jaketapper Depressingly unsurprising.  Time to @SquareUp and give the people a government that only cares about their interests.  #PaytoPlay #Swamp
@AFSCME https://t.co/WMv9OXF4UD
Well if this isn't the perfect illustration of our #swamp... time to get money out of politics and #SquareUp with the many that have been getting screwed.  Kyl returns to Covington https://t.co/Xqolk11wAS via @politico
To #SquareUp, the US needs a Brandeisian brand of anti-trust enforcement.  Relaxed enforcement for the last 40 years has helped stack the deck against the many. #NewSquareDeal #Competition https://t.co/fAeDxsMzVj

Excited for #Wisconsin to have a governor in @GovEvers that will fight to #SquareUp with its people and undo the anti-worker and anti-democratic agenda of @ScottWalker. #Progress https://t.co/AQzGtEjWWa
#PresidentCarter has seen this become increasingly the case for decades.  It's time for the US to protect #labor and #unions, to completely take money out of politics, and ensure #EconomicOpportunity for all in order to finally #SquareUp with the people https://t.co/zHaTWlqDWW
In order to #SquareUp with our people, we must all better understand the disparities in our society, including for families of color.  Let's reject the notion that we can only talk about race or class, but not both.  They are inextricably linked. #DignityofWork #EqualOpportunity https://t.co/YeOVkJ3UEv
Not saying he isn't, but nobody, NOBODY, gets to ride their legacy to the nomination without putting forward a comprehensive vision about how we're going to #SquareUp with the people. https://t.co/sdRb88AY0m
Watching @NoahCRothman lecture on @Morning_Joe on how the markets, little-to-no government involvement, and economic growth through mass consumerism are our only way forward in response to climate change is....rich. His is a philosophy that has dominated since the 80s.  #SquareUp
If we learned anything from 2016 it should be to let all voices be heard and the primary, and see who can build a movement to carry into the general.  Let the process play out.  I trust the @TheDemocrats primary voters to sort it out.  No pre-primary filter needed. https://t.co/Fnlq0aAlnY
This is the type of bold policy initiative we must unapologetically embrace to #SquareUp with the American people.  Let's set the parameters of the debate and demand that it and those like it are viewed by all as reasonable and realistic goals.  #HealthCareForAll #Progressive https://t.co/XErUHEj1fG
This is the type of structural change needed for the US to #SquareUp with its citizens.  This is precisely how the deck gets stacked against everyday Americans, and it's been commonplace for far too long.  #SwampCreatures #RealReform https://t.co/8UogtPEjXp
A small number have gotten very rich on the backs of workers like Lila for decades. We must lock arms with our brothers and sisters and labor and ensure that we have elected leaders that will #SquareUp with people like Lila.  #JobsNotWalls #DignityofWork https://t.co/cWYgrLm5i6
Hard pass on @TerryMcAuliffe . If we're going to be "big, bold, positive and realistic", we can't have this type of milquetoast messenger.  It's time for somebody that will tackle the fundamental and structural immoralities of our society and #squareup with the American people. https://t.co/RRgM3YOqY7
Agencies run by former lobbyists.  Members of congress walking into lucrative lobbying jobs.  If we are going to #SquareUp with the American people, we need a government that is not bought and paid for by special interests.  #anticorruption #SwampCreatures https://t.co/FWadtIGFrt
Just another demonstration of the disrespect @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP have for working Americans.  We need a president that will fight for and respect working families.  It's time to #SquareUp with these workers and get on with the real issues. https://t.co/TieBeOJgr0
It's long past time to reset the rules of our democracy so that it actually works for the many.  Good to see @SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats taking an ACTUAL step to #DrainTheSwamp https://t.co/dlY7jbgt4k

The presidency should not belong to wealthy mega donors, and it should not belong to a wealthy candidate that can self fund.  It belongs to the people.  Campaigns for president should be funded accordingly.  This is a principle Democrats need to do more than pay lip service to. https://t.co/iqH08z0spb
