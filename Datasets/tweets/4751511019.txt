@PalmerReport Congratulations!
@McFaul And where is this kind of garbage about male candidates?
@TheRynheart I hope they take each other out. I’m not worried about the orange fool because he’ll be in prison for being a traitor.

@SykesCharlie Folks seem a little keyed up these days. Gee, I wonder why.
@TrueFactsStated Poetic justice.
@GeorgeTakei Every time I think he can’t get dummer, he does. Is there no bottom?
@RepTedLieu @POTUS Thank you!
@KevinMKruse Bigger shovel.
@politico After two years of not doing your job, you’re in no position to demand anything. You should be brought up on charges for obstruction of justice!
@Alyssa_Milano That’s not called abortion, it’s called murder.
@HuffPost Many people live paycheck to paycheck, they count on the refund to help pay bills that are behind, buy food, buy kids shoes and clothing, things they can’t buy because there’s no money left after monthly surviving. Obviously politicians are out of touch with voters.
@TheDemCoalition Too late, he’s headed for prison.
@BetteMidler Plus the fact that unless you were a model the things didn’t fit and the store personnel looked at you like you were trespassing.
@MichaelAvenatti Disgusting!
@GeorgeTakei I hope it marks the end of his wall forever!
@TheDemCoalition I hope it included him being in the testimony yesterday, standing at the back of the room glaring at Cohen.
@TeaPainUSA That’s not called abortion it’s called murder.
@TeaPainUSA That’s the point! They need to start over and think about their priorities.
@HuffPostPol Pence goes first. He was recommended by Manafort so you know he’s neck deep in corruption. Him first, trump next.
@politico The only reason he’s angry is because he didn’t have all the attention. Cohen hogged his air time.
@TeaPainUSA Don’t forget the book deal.
@jdawsey1 When is he going to be brought up on charges?
@StevenBeschloss Wouldn’t that be nice?
@EdKrassen The Republican Party is crooked with a good old boy, frat, mob attitude.
@AriMelber Cummings knows they’re dealing with the Russian mob.
@TimInHonolulu Wish they would start dropping. Waiting is hard.
@SenJeffMerkley Who has killed most of his relatives.
@PreetBharara How come he’s always hostile?
@ECMcLaughlin @GOP And they’re down right hostile.
@TeaPainUSA You can certainly tell a Democrat from a Republican by the questions they ask and their attitude.
@KarenAttiah WHat a crock of crap!
@Texas_Dexter Totally cute!
@pfizer Yes, you’re there for them at what price.
@briantylercohen @OccupyDemocrats He’s literally had everyone who opposed or displeased him murdered.
@krassenstein He’s going to sit there screaming at the tv and twitting until his fingers are bloody.
@politico One wonders why he isn’t in jail.
@StevenBeschloss Just when I think he’s reached bottom, he keeps digging.
@TravisAllen02 Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
@dailykos From a man who obviously never has to worry about food or rent or keeping the electric on or kids school, doctors or any of the normal day to day expenses.
@MotherJones He never cared about them from the beginning. He only cares about lining his pockets and it doesn’t matter where the money comes from.
@HuffPost Don’t you have anything else to write about? It seems to me her views on why she’s running for office would be a good start. And why don’t you publish this kind of rubbish about male candidates?

@AMHotFlash @Goss30Goss They figured it was their own special piggy bank. Trump has already said if there’s money, it’s his.
@TeaPainUSA He’ll have lots of time to practice in prison!
@LouiseMensch Go away! Far, far away. England wasn’t far enough.
@AshaRangappa_ He doesn’t want to get booed when he shows he can’t throw.
@RadioFreeTom So what? She still won!
@KATUNews It’s an expensive waffle!
@TeaPainUSA I’d like to say it will go way down, but the idiots who back him can’t read,
@BillKristol @TheDemCoalition History does repeat itself.
@PalmerReport Just when you think he couldn’t possibly dummer, he is. What a dim wit!
@aravosis Wish I had a waist that small!
@JoeNBC Instead of acting like it’s a big scandal, just ask her.
@ElieNYC Matches mine.
@McCreadyForNC @realDonaldTrump And why is he allowed to run again? Why isn’t he in jail?
@EdKrassen Whom ever is not in prison.
@funder He doesn’t know how the government works and has surrounded himself with idiots.
@TravisAllen02 Why is that man not locked up? Why is there a re-election? Why doesn’t that allow the other candidate to win?
@atrupar Going to be hard to do from prison for treason.
@McCreadyForNC They shouldn’t get a new election. The man should be in jail, not running for office.
@JeffreyGuterman @CNN Billionaires are dropping like flies.
@counterchekist @lauferlaw @GOP @NCGOP My question is why isn’t he in jail if he rigged the election? Why is he still running for office?
@RedTRaccoon @VICE Guess she didn’t learn anything from her Mueller interview.
@cnnbrk It’s about time!
@TeaPainUSA Obviously his oath meant nothing.
@DemsOfState Why is he still allowed to run for office? He should be in jail!
@StevenBeschloss Maybe someone in the family should go out and get an honest job, just like the rest of us do.
@RepEscobar What a giant waste of time and money. Plus the fact it looks like hell and goes completely against what America stands for.  Everyday I hate that man more and will celebrate when he and his whole family of traitors are put in prison for the rest of their lives.
@maydaymindy9 Yuck! Now I have to go scrub my brain.
@george_capen Looks like someone in the family needs to go out a earn an honest living working just like the rest of us do.
@JoyceWhiteVance It’s called treason!
@GeorgeTakei With all of their latest hires, they must be trying to compete with Fox. I, for one, no longer watch them.
@paulkrugman That man has been insane for a long time.
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @AriMelber Can you blame them?
@LannyDavis @realDonaldTrump Why should he be paid to tell the Truth? He wants the money for high paid lawyers so he won’t spend the rest of his life in prison for treason. He should have thought about that as he covered up crimes for his mob boss.
@TimInHonolulu @CNN @FBIWFO @FBIAtlanta Hype, hype, hype.
RT @funder: .@realDonaldTrump-YOU are the “enemy of the people.” Everyone who retweets this agrees. #ImpeachTrump
@tribelaw Let’s hope they rip him in half.
@Turnip2020 Every single day!
@briantylercohen Where do they find these people? And why do they elect them?
@krassenstein Wonder how fast he’ll be in jail?
@politico Short employment time since pence is going to prison for being a traitor!
@PalmerReport And we hope there’s more days like this to come for him. Keep hitting him!
@CREWcrew No one should be surprised.
@pattonoswalt In real life, he was a real Jerk
@people Just once I’d like to see her in clothing that covered her and wasn’t so tight she walked funny.
@politico Care to take a lie detector test Donny?
@mmpadellan What music did he listen to?
@politico The same way they’ve been running since the beginning of the country.
@DearAuntCrabby @maydaymindy9 I don’t think she’s wearing underwear. Not flattering and certainly not cute. She’s perfect for Donnie jr.
@davematt88 @Texas_Dexter In intelligence?
@PalmerReport That’s because his panicked attorneys explained to him what he did and what was going to happen because of it.
@GeorgeTakei They better hurry up before he’s put in prison for the rest of his life for treason!
@CharlesPPierce Oh joy.
@TeaPainUSA I certainly hope this lands him in jail.
@MSNBC Mueller has made sure that info was shared and there are state charges that can’t be pardoned. Plus Manafort has many more charges to go thru. He hasn’t seen the judge for the last time.
@JoyAnnReid Yes we are terrified and want the politicians who were voted into office to get off their collective butts and get rid of him! The sooner the better!
@MotherJones He’s such a smug SOB!
@ABC One wonders why you would use that picture of the pope with the subject of the article? No one thinks this is humorous, even the poor.
@ScienceChannel God complex.
@usweekly Read one story that said the reason they don’t wear them is for a speedy escape should they be threatened. Don’t agree with it, just read it.
@washingtonpost How is he in a position to dictate to Democrats?
@ReneeLibby2 300+
@MingGao26 Both kicking and screaming all the way.
@lauferlaw Just like his whole presidency is a giant joke!
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump You just knew something was going on. When he gets his craziest, I always wonder what’s coming and hope it has Mueller attached to it.
@Reuters Lies, lies and more lies!
@KamalaHarris I already signed one.
@lauferlaw The problem is they’ve been getting away with it for so long that they feel impervious. Nothing is going to touch them, just ask them.
@tedlieu @GOP @realDonaldTrump I like you more and more! Thank you for caring about America!
@funder @TheDemCoalition About time!
@joncoopertweets It’s hard to vote for one since they’re all important and urgent.
@PalmerReport So what is going on today that trump doesn’t want us to notice? Everyone is focused on the “emergency” what’s going on elsewhere?
@TheBeatWithAri @djenvy Who the hell cares what music she listened To? What does that have to do with anything current? How about the men candidates? What music did they listen too? Absolutely stupid!
@JoyAnnReid These people just keep getting crazier and Crazier!
@krassenstein Welcome to the real world!
@GeorgeTakei End this madness!
@DearAuntCrabby He paid for it from one of his government piggy banks.
@lauferlaw @tedlieu @QeyeTDogbytes Russian mafia.
@JayInslee @HowardSchultz Put your money where your mouth is.
@DearAuntCrabby Russian mafia.
@chrislhayes He’s probably lying to protect his family from the Russian mob.
@EdKrassen He doesn’t pay for anything! He’s robbing from one of his handy piggy banks like the election fund.
@krassenstein If it’s like the last time, trump wrote his own report.
@mkraju And how many times that day she was asked by how many people?
@DogginTrump 👎
@Billbrowder Guess we’re weeding them out early.
@ABC No dog would want him.
@StevenBeschloss Who paid for it?
@lauferlaw Any tag line for a story, no matter how far fetched it is.
@dbongino Delusional.
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Rerun of military parade that was nixed.  What a waste of $!
@HuffPost And do they ask the men candidates ridiculous questions like that?
@MichaelAvenatti @CNN If it means us waiting awhile to help mueller, then we should wait. Neither dems or repbs protested the delay. There’s something brewing.
@TheDemCoalition @funder Ivanka. Your father had nothing to do with it! Stop taking credit for what Obama did!
@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH Given the size of the universe, there will probably be many more discoveries.
@jdawsey1 Waste of $!
@politico Why do democrats let him run in their party. He votes republican every time!
@HuffPost Simple solution. Quit reporting his rallies.  No coverage of any kind.
@TheDemCoalition @DonaldJTrumpJr People in the town hate him enough that they had to bus in the audience from other cities.
@MSNBC Prison.
@mmpadellan They had to bus in people from other towns for his rally because the people of El Paso don’t want him there.
@ChelseaClinton I wish they would put him in prison!
@stucam7771 Almost?
@politico Why should we believe them?
@ninidanatual 🤢🤢🤢🤢
@amvetsupport The doctor should be assigned by someone other than the president.
@CREWcrew @AllResistNews Jared needs to be in prison!

@enews Looks like wrapping paper.
@tribelaw I’d be surprised if he isn’t.
@SteveKOIN A few more lights and it could be Christmas time.
@TheDemCoalition @DonaldJTrumpJr He didn’t mention that he and his family didnt have one on either and when the camera panned over to republican men, they didn’t have them either. He’s such a jerk! Mueller, please lock him up soon!
@DearAuntCrabby I’ve had it several times and wouldn’t wish it on anyone except maybe trump. If you’re the one that has it, I’m sorry for your pain. Who knew coughing could be so exhausting.  Take care and remember, lots of liquids.
@lauferlaw No one is a fan of him.

@NBCNews What a waste of good soldiers!
@DearAuntCrabby Delusional!
@krassenstein He should have thought about that before he committed treason!
@HuffPost Who cares if your rich? I don’t like him because of his ego and his lack of any government service. We don’t need another president who doesn’t understand the constitution and thinks it doesn’t apply to them.
@funder And it’s okay for trump to bully whoever he wants.

@PalmerReport The thing is, Pelosi had already cancelled her trip and trump wasn’t paying attention. So his little snide letter was a mute point to begin with.
@GeorgeTakei @SpeakerPelosi She had already changed her schedule and wasn’t going anyway. He just doesn’t pay attend because he’s too busy throwing a temper tantrum.

@aravosis Why do they keep giving these nut air time?
@NBCNews Pelosi is correct! He shouldn’t be invited to make one of his evil speeches that we don’t want to hear. Lies, lies, lies.

@joncoopertweets He should be for obstruction.
@PalmerReport I prefer traitor!
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump It sure took them long enough to wake up!
@PalmerReport The only reason he did that stupid speech was to be on tv and be the center of attention. Unfortunatly for him, most people just didn’t watch.
@DearAuntCrabby He sure is packing on the pounds.
@mmpadellan 👎
@PalmerReport There’s no steak with ketchup either. And may I add YUCK.
@dailykos And who’s going to make that decision?
@PalmerReport The orange fool can’t get much crazier, can he?
@EdKrassen Sorry to disagree but the punishment for treason is a firing squad.
@DavidPriess Ted Cruz is an idiot! Millions of Americans want to see justice! No one is above the law. Stop this insanity now.
@CNN I still say he took the $ out of the campaign fund. One piggy bank is as good as another.
@CBSNews This is disgusting!
@funder Who the hell does he think he is? No one is above the law!
@ELINTNews Why isn’t this from an American news source?
@BrianKarem @JoyAnnReid @realDonaldTrump He meant himself.
@PhilipRucker @PressSec He’s probably taking the $ out of the campaign funds. One piggy bank is as good as another has been how he works.
@PoliticusSarah @Slate This needs to be written into law so no other president tries this.

@MalcolmNance @CBPSanDiego This is a bunch of bullshit! All this against harmless, unarmed, defenseless men, women and children. The orange buffoon needs to be in jail! He’s a traitor!
@JohnWDean He met with putin.
@PalmerReport Mueller tied the state and federal charges together. When Manafort signed his agreement he didn’t check the fine print. If Mueller did that to him,he’s done it to the rest of them. Again, several steps ahead.
@PalmerReport Everyone kept their story straight, just happened to be the wrong story to the wrong people.
@Reuters Pompous ass!
@MotherJones He’s such a stupid ass!
@thedailybeast If he had anything, he would have released it before this.

@Kokomothegreat Good, I hope he packed his bags and he loves living in Russia.
@PalmerReport Trump might as well confess to what Putin has on him because it will come out in the end. And then he should resign before he’s throw out of office.
@krassenstein @JackPosobiec Clinton’s daughter didn’t sit her butt in meetings she had no business in and didn’t make decisions. Their daughter was more qualified than Ivanka ever thought of being.
@EdKrassen Right up there with the Gambino family.

@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Hard to be elected from prison.

@GeorgeTakei Good, I hope they get worse!
@BetteMidler He can’t be pardoned because mueller tied his state charges to his confession.

@leftyjennyc And then being sniffed up by the other dog. What indignities!
@TravisAllen02 Hopefully they will all be in prison by then!
@PalmerReport I wish he’d implode!
@people I thought people had more class.
@grantstern @JaySekulow @OccupyDemocrats Let the good times roll! Come on Mueller!
@CNN @CNNOpinion If he’s so fragile, please hurry up and fall apart!
@DearAuntCrabby Bye bye.
@PalmerReport And his whole family!
@DemWrite @MaxineWaters We hired them to investigate and if they don’t, they too will get voted out!
@joelockhart @realDonaldTrump @PressSec There’s nothing funny, witty or humorous about the White House or the government at this point in time. The yellow fool has made sure of that.
@Buddynevins The fools have been having chicken pox parties so everyone can get infected at one time. What fun!🤯
@stephenfhayes @SykesCharlie He won’t be running, he’ll be in prison!
@TheRickWilson YUCK!
@krassenstein You forgot treason!
@MichaelAvenatti With current events it’s hard to imagine trump rerunning from prison.
@HuffPost He meant everything evil he’s typed!
@BetteMidler Watch the science channel, might learn something.
@DearAuntCrabby And as they investigate the Russia mess, how many politicians will fall?
@PalmerReport And then as they uncover more, let’s look how many politicians fall. Wonder if the republicans are worried? Wonder who will try to control the evidence?
@ProudResister We’re listening and waiting for someone to finally do something about it!
@PalmerReport He needs to quit picking crooks. Oh right, that’s all that will work for him.
@GeorgeTakei They still have enough money to bring suit against Washington state because we passed stiffer gun laws. Coffee, bullshit!
@NBCNews At least we won’t have to hear him say something stupid.
@MotherJones They still have enough money to sue Washington state who had the moxie to pass a stiffer background check.
@DearAuntCrabby @highbrow_nobrow Franklins dad had hit he head on the lid so many times. “He said what?”
@DearAuntCrabby @SenatorCollins Maybe she’ll get smart and just retire.
@TheRickWilson I want to know how someone this old made it this far being so stupid?
@RepMaxineWaters Take away her security that is costing us a fortune.
@dailykos No but they can still run ugly commercials and file law suits against Washington state.
@NathanLerner Believe it when I see it. He doesn’t have a great track record.
@ProudResister @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump Does he take the blame or dump it on his kids? Whatever he answers Mueller already knows the truth.
@DearAuntCrabby I could care less, I’ve been pissed for over two years!
@DearAuntCrabby @vicenews Why aren’t they in CA helping?
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump How about just stating the truth. He didn’t want to go so he didn’t.
@DearAuntCrabby We should be so lucky.
@DearAuntCrabby The skeletons are rising.
@JoyAnnReid One wonders how someone this evil and stupid manages to think they are relevant.
@PalmerReport They recirculate stories all the time.
@TheRickWilson Goes to show, they never listen to women.
@GeorgeTakei 🤢
@DearAuntCrabby I hope he implodes!
@PalmerReport Don’t you think the rest of the world was waiting for the election so they could see how the American public really feels? I hope we sent a strong enough signal to say enough is enough! We want our country back and we support our allies.
@RepMaxineWaters Hold his feet to the fire for us.
@DearAuntCrabby Licking his wounds from his “successful” trip.
@PalmerReport If he’s so miserable, quit!
@EdKrassen Licking his wounds.
@PalmerReport And from what I read they told trump he couldn’t meet with Putin.
@GeorgeTakei I think they should have a recount in Texas!
@PalmerReport And I for one, will watch with great glee!
@CalvinMoore_ @kyrstensinema You sir are a real fool!
@TeaPainUSA Pardon me, but these pictures are a crock of crap!
@RepTedDeutch Who the hell cares what Hannity has to say!
@GeorgeTakei Sad and sick!
@funder I like presidents that aren’t traitors.
@ida_skibenes You forgot, I like presidents that aren’t traitors.
@DearAuntCrabby Nice, isn’t it?
@davidfrum He’s meeting with Putin.
@Lawrence Could be because he’s meeting Putin.
@McFaul He met with his owner, Putin.
@BetteMidler And to meet with his owner, Putin.
@DearAuntCrabby Poetic justice.
@McFaul @USMC I think the idiot is completely disgusting! The only reason he went to France was to visit his owner, Putin.
@Mandari25733571 @jaketapper And ted nugent
@krassenstein He’s in France meeting with his owner now. They can just go back to Russia together.
@PalmerReport And now he’s in France meeting with his owner, Putin.
@McFaul He’s going to meet his owner, Putin.
@joncoopertweets Who cares that he’s depressed? He’s not so depressed that he can’t run to France to meet his owner, Putin.
@CBSNews Make his life so miserable that he resigns.
@TravisAllen02 My eyes hurt from rolling so hard.
@dailykos The blind leading the terminally stupid.
@funder But he can lie about it.
@DearAuntCrabby Too bad I quit drinking 20 yrs ago!
@McFaul The man is totally delusional!
@PalmerReport I want him to lose it all.
@MikeLevinCA @BarackObama Me too!
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump Look at me! Look at me!
@DearAuntCrabby @GeraldoRivera Temporary! He’s always been a nut case.
@PalmerReport The problem I see here is that those rabid followers have guns, transportation and hate. What will happen when a group of them go to the border and start shooting innocent people seeking asylum?
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump The only reason he went is because his daughter brow beat him into it. Plus it was a great photo op.
@PalmerReport Charles Manson didn’t commit the murders but he still lived his life in prison. Why should trump be different?
@guardian Nope. He’s always been weird.
@TIME He’s a fricken idiot!
@PalmerReport Someone probably slipped his meds in his food.
@DearAuntCrabby @kanyewest Made an ass out of himself and the office of the president and believe me the orange fool needs no help being an ass!
@MSN They already said they don’t want him!
@GeorgeTakei Disgusting, evil little man!
@CNN One big except, the Democrats are not shooting people.
@PerezHilton I knew there was a reason I’ve loved him all these years! Good music and common sense.
@EdKrassen I don’t think he will ever understand how much he’s hated!
@Oregonian Hypocrite!
@realAliTweets He has to pardon him first. Then he can appoint him.
@CBSNews Not just NO, but HELL NO!
@dccc @HillaryClinton And many more🎼!
@PalmerReport So now they have this guy, we go through a circus trial and then after he’s sentenced. The orange fool pardons him.
@politico Maybe people are just tired of his lies.
@PalmerReport I think it must be changed also.  We must get that fool out of office and into prison ASAP!
@PalmerReport Congratulations for getting blocked! You hit a nerve someplace.
@PalmerReport Congratulations!
@MarkNelsenKPTV @fox12oregon Looks like the eye of a giant bird.
@PalmerReport Already did! Voted straight democrat.
@PalmerReport Trump is treating Cruz like Putin is treating trump.
@GeorgeTakei Made me chuckle!
@coleyworld Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
@EdKrassen @NRA @FCC Help Puerto Rico	Rebuild EPA	Undo health care changes
@Kasparov63 I have no idea why people should be shocked, the orange fool has proven time and time again that there’s no bottom to his evil.
@PalmerReport Gout
@people Put clothes on! No one needs or wants to see that!
@CharlesMBlow What a jerk!
@people Horses##t! It’s real private to post nude photos every day. Idiot!
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Orange fool works for me.
@NBCNews Going for the sympathy vote.
@NathanLerner We’ll also investigate them.
@THR @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson Couldn’t happen to a more deserving person.
@briantylercohen He’ll just find something else to make in to a mountain. He such a predictable idiot!
@PalmerReport We all knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of time. The man is dummer than rocks!
@fox12oregon Absolutely disgusting!
@PalmerReport I just wish it didn’t take so long!
@MichaelAvenatti @Mediaite Sorry  Michael but that endorsement is not at the bottom of the barrel but under the barrel.
@TrisResists @lfkraus @Lady_Star_Gem @PatsyResists @TheSWPrincess @JadedCreative @B52Malmet @Trumpet1984 @debbiesideris @DeadpoolResists @SlythSeeker That is just plain gross!
@blakehounshell What difference does it make what spurred the registrations? What’s important is that people vote.
@Oregonian That’s why he voted straight party. He is protecting his big donors and doesn’t care about the voters after he’s gotten into office
@MSN Just wait you old fool!
@GeorgeTakei Yea, like his daughter.
@politico All those paid protesters are going to vote you out and put you and all your cronies in jail.
@PalmerReport He want to increase his nepotism with his untalented and unqualified daughter.
@chrislhayes Too late.
@GeorgeTakei She’s so clueless why bother.
@CBSNews Hopefully he’ll be out of power by that time!
@OK_Magazine Yuck!
@thehill If anything’s it’s made us more determined to end this madness!
@PalmerReport How about we get as many as possible
@thehill Shut up!
@thehill True, we’re sick of you and the circus you’ve created!
@thehill @senatemajldr And neither will the voters!
@GeorgeTakei We knew before, it’s just now been verified.
@coleyworld Entitled much?
@GeorgeTakei You’d think he’d quit digging at some point but guess he’s just now bright enough!
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump @GOP Quit lumping all whites together!
@chrissyteigen Oops!
@AinCarolina1 @ProudResister Because we have the same color doesnt mean we’re all the same!
@KeithOlbermann Can we also say we wish he’d go away. Far, far away.
@grantstern If he loves him so much he should move so he can be nearer.
@PerezHilton I won’t watch anything with him in it.
@PerezHilton She’s delusional!
@PalmerReport Would you expect trump to pick anyone that’s sane?
@PalmerReport He’s probably sleeping because he doesn’t give a damn.  He needs to retire. We should have age limit, term limits and IQ tests.
@MichaelAvenatti They don’t want the truth.
@CNBC @elonmusk What about earthquakes?
@AJentleson Age limit, term limit needed.
@SenJeffMerkley Or any court!
@PalmerReport He’s probably too busy talking to Putin to find out the nexy great plot.
@CharlesMBlow Hopefully every one of them will be voted out! Age limit, term limit needed.
@NBCNews Why in the world would anyone think that’s humorous?
@krassenstein Or corrupt.
@NBCNews He doesn’t seem to care about what’s legal and what’s not!
@PalmerReport Grassley thinks he’s pushing it through.
@LincolnGraves Nice to see normal red sky’s instead of fire smoke induced.
@RogueNASA Well he’s kind of right because birds are descendants of dinosaurs. I’m sure he doesn’t know that but even fools can be a little right some of the time.
@enews Why would you even pose this statement? Isn’t there enough strife in the world for you right now? Why add to it?
@DailyMirror Go away! Far, far away!
@GeorgeTakei She did win!
@thehill Delusional.
@thehill Put the blame where it belongs! Squarely On trumps shoulders.
@ProudResister I want to know if we can opt out.
@Bakari_Sellers Planted?
@PalmerReport Or all the people for Cruz at 2am saying the same thing. Suspicious?
@AmandaMarcotte Kind of like Cruz emails at 2am that all said the same thing.
@thehill He’s faced a lot more in his life. This is just a bump in an amazing career!
@thehill Enough with the expensive witch hunts. Just stop!
@RogueNASA The storm is 300 miles wide.
@thehill Liar!
@PalmerReport No shit!
@CBSNews Even when he says he isn’t as ass, he’s an ass.
@thehill That’s a crock of crap! He committed treason and nothing they say can change those facts!
@etnow They both need to grow up. And clean their mouths.
@Cosmopolitan They both need to grow up.
@KamalaHarris You are my hero!
@RogueNASA @Lawrence And before the rallies they advertise for actors especially minorities to be the audience.
@NewYorker @BorowitzReport Good.
@LincolnGraves Couldn’t happen to a more deserving person.  Shouldn’t have taken this long!
@Lawrence What makes them think someone’s going to stand up and say, “I did it!”?
@thehill You take one also! And trump and all of his enablers!
@thehill And so are you!
@politico He was so upset by the comments that he invited Ivanka to the funeral?
@fototec_fu Notice how silent they’ve become.
@thehill He’s the one who can clean up the mess that is now the government post orange fool.
@NBCNews What a racist ass!
@CBSNews @MajorCBS He know all those things and doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He’s all about me, me, me.
@SBSNews Wonder when people are going to figure out why they’re called wild animals?
@NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters He doesn’t like women who are smarter than him and who see through his bull crap.
@jaketapper And well known fool.
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump He hates it when people are right and tell it like it is.
@MSNBC You hired her you idiot!
@GeorgeTakei And heartburn!
@funder Come on democrats!
@Lawrence Hopefully we’ll never hear of him again!
@SethAbramson Probably been threatened.
@TheRickyDavila Their going to be poor again when the checks go to prison.
@KGWNews Good, now deport them.
@TMZ @realDonaldTrump What a crock of crap!
@weaversmom @MalcolmNance We need him back!
@PalmerReport He’ll have lots of company.
@woody_tobias You should have offered, all of them.
@chrislhayes @TheDemCoalition Me too!
@PalmerReport Well, I wish they would get it over with so we can save our democracy!
@CBSNews Bye bye.
@MSN My doctor told me you can drink too much water. Happy medium.
@mentalpausal @PalmerReport @ksaun001 Right into the swamp!
@PalmerReport Where Rudy? He should be saying something.
@GeorgeTakei Why don’t we honor their and deport them?
@PalmerReport Bet you’re heart broken.
@NBCNews Translation. I can’t do my regular evil traitorous activities with everyone watching.
@SenFeinstein When Democrats take over they can impeach him.
@MichaelAvenatti @Lane79Reg He also didn’t earn that title.
@joncoopertweets It’s also called treason.
@adam1alexander Tell xfinity if they're going to name a series after themselves they should carry all the programming. No FS2 in my area!
