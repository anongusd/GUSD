@ADHD_Capital @DonaldJTrumpJr With the Oath of Office and the Constitutional guarantee of Republican form of government...		Not only do the self declared socialists corrupting the Democratic Party have a "temperament unfit for the job", they are all in direct breach of their Oath of Office.
@RonPaul Sooo.... the market value of gold would be fixed at $42.2222/oz -- because that is the statutory value gold is accounted for at the Treasury at this time.		Don't believe me? Read the last paragraph in Note 2 from the Treasury Balance Sheet:		https://t.co/RRiSwDZlOx
@VP @USCG @DHSgov With legalization of marijuana in many States, it is in the financial interests of every American involved in that booming industry -- and those who benefit indirectly via increased tax revenues --  to hinder the illegal importation of marijuana into the US.
@MaryFolkerts @BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Mary, 		I developed an economic solution that makes the edu system self-funding and the initiative is about getting that solution applied.		Do you grasp how much money in tax revenues the success of this economic solution will free up for other purposes... like Healthcare?
@BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump Help school Congress and the President on this proposal to monetize a specific form of public domain intellectual property.		Here is the essence of the Constitutionality of the proposal.		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/UhLCRn1sHH
@BetsyDeVosED @realDonaldTrump The subject matter taught in schools is all public domain intellectual property.		Private intellectual property is valuated and monetized all the time by private corporations.		We can do the same thing with public intellectual property at the Treasury.		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/lErKDi6pmO
@RepJayapal @Public_Citizen If only there was a way to pay off the US Debt in full, then the $350 Billion a year paid in interest on #TheDebt could be used to fund #MedicareForAll without tax increases!

@AEIeducation @SenAlexander @AEI @delislealleges @streeterryan @LanaeErickson @EricaLG @MACooperPhD The edu system is helping develop Wealth in the form of public domain intellectual property every year.

@AEIeducation @SenAlexander @AEI @delislealleges @streeterryan @LanaeErickson @EricaLG @MACooperPhD It would be far more effective to recognize that the knowledge &amp; education held by graduates and evidenced by diplomas &amp; degrees constitute PUBLIC DOMAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, and monetize the assets directly at the Treasury.		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/9kkE41v3Ad

@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It's time to add this to the list of accomplishment:		"We have started accounting for over $30 Trillion worth of public domain assets previously going unaccounted for at the Treasury; Paid the National Debt, and made education tax free &amp; tuition free."		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/pTZE2ik5zT
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Our economy is suffering a $30 Trillion loss by failing to account for and monetize the Wealth being proposed for monetization by this initiative:		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE		With the National Debt paid off, that frees the $350+ Billion paid in interest on the debt for other uses. https://t.co/asyyRghM89
@SenSanders You have been made aware of the $30 Trillion in assets going unaccounted for and monetized at the Treasury.		Rather than advocating eliminating the National Debt via the economic innovation being proposed, you take cheep shots at the President on Twitter.		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/KxWUxctOQs
@PattyMurray The mess is the #NationalDebt and it existed long before Trump held office. Over $350B in interest was paid last year.		We should clean up that mess.

@SenWarren $350B+ in tax revenues was paid on the US Debt last year.		When the US Debt is paid off, interest payments end.

@PressSec No compromise is needed, just funding. This grass-roots initiative will:		1) Fund all education (Pre-Ph.D.),	2) Fund all public training (civil &amp; military),	3) Pay the US Debt — in full,	4) Free up $350B+/year in interest on #TheDebt,		https://t.co/slRrmGQTJE https://t.co/lHJb6XHIsz

@VincentLane16 @RonPaul The racists are just getting it from the classists bro...  consider this: all the racist &amp; sexist stuff is Divide &amp; Conquer. It's not quite 99% vs 1%, but rather the "lower classes" vs "upper class". We must unite a Majority to make a change.
@RonPaul The doctrine of scarcity was developed by someone who failed to recognize the inherent ability people have to create abundance.		It was born of ignore-ance, and is an artificial paradigm.		Calling it reality is indicative of mild psychosis.
