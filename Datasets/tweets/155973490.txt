@francjd I don‚Äôt disagree with them that it‚Äôs worth looking at, and it appears that outside of health the biggest reason is travel and cost. But as it‚Äôs written it‚Äôs confusing and I think doesn‚Äôt say what people want to think it says.

Reporters writing about #CrystalCity I parked there for three months straight in 2016, AMA
Crystal City is absolutely not cool, but is kind of a blank slate surrounded by transit options. I‚Äôm also intrigued about how this changes the somewhat anemic DC tech universe.
But that issue aside, Crystal City is kind of a weirdly perfect place to drop a giant company in. Abandoned but functional office space sitting right over metro, next to an airport and surrounded by bike paths. Less than five miles from downtown DC.
Also, they‚Äôre shutting down the southern part of blue/yellow lines for the ENTIRE SUMMER of 2019 bc YOLO!
It took my husband 1.5 hours to go two miles from Crystal City to my daughters daycare last Friday thanks to metro shut down, airport traffic and (love you DC drivers) rain. Was perhaps some foreshadowing of what‚Äôs to come with Amazon...

@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast There's a Risen and a Rosen, which is confusing. But can't find anything that either was jailed. Other presidents have jailed reporters (ie Judith Miller). What makes Trump unique is that hes saying a profession is the "enemy of the people" repeatedly without offering any proof.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I can't find any evidence that Risen was actually jailed? THis story says they subpoeaned him and then ended up not questioning him under oath so he wouldn't be found in contempt of court and then sent to jail. The subpoena was then dropped. 		https://t.co/ZcqX5ONMEv
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I understand that. And I don't disagree about exposing division. But I do think he's made it worse and perhaps far worse than it was or needed to be. We can dislike President Obama's policies or dislike President Trump's policies without calling people rapists, criminals, enemies
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast ...But also a good reminder that if the president thinks there's an enemy among us, there's a way to deal with it besides tweeting through the judicial system. The equivalent here would be Obama tweeting that it was really unfair that reporters covered leaks.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast This is about DOJ subpoenaing reporters to testify and searching phone records, not being locked up or harassed. I'm not saying that was right, I frankly don't know enough about the Espionage Act.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast And look, I think people like Trump because he is so unusual. So be it! But its odd to like that and then also be mad when he gets covered as being...unusual.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast And I would say "bitterly cling" to something is not quite on the level of being called a rapist, an enemy or that the president would grab your genitalia without permission.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Yup and that line got covered EXTENSIVELY and he got a lot of criticism for that.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Are you saying Obama locked up reporters and harassed their families?
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I think they would've run it about other presidents. Do I think its the greatest idea in the world? No.		Also again I'm being literal, but publishing that does not = "view him as Hitler"
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast However, I welcome any examples where you think he was using some sort of coded, "smarter" sounding language. I can't think of any.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast What was his intent? I don't understand.		I disagree that Obama ever said or used any elevated language to call groups of people rapists, say he would grab women by the pussy, say an entire profession isthe  "enemy of the people."
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I know this might seem overly literal, but its hard to say "most media types" in a meaningful way. How many people are you talking about? Who are they, exactly? How do you know they think he's Hitler? That is similar to someone saying "all Trump supporters like XYZ"
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast And when you are extremely powerful AND say things that are unprecedented in history of office, you are going to get even more attention.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I disagree that he should keep up that rhetoric because he won't get good press coverage. No president got good press coverage literally all the time. On top of typical presidential scrutiny, what Trump says, like it or not, is also highly unusual for an American president.
@BBPHredux @thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Part of that higher level of scrutiny is the explosion of content in the past 5-10 years. But I think particularly 5 years. 		Re: the dog whistle thing, I do think his rhetoric is more divisive than any other modern American president. I can't find a good comparison.

@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast The end goal was keeping the power on right? Was there an exact set of steps you all knew you had to follow to do that? Or did it take some creativity? Could someone come behind later and say: ‚Äúyeah you got the power on but you shouldve done things in a different order‚Äù
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I was making a joke that newsrooms are messy and wouldn‚Äôt be good at colluding with one another, much less an entire political party.

@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I'm not a FISA expert but I believe they are all determined by judges who have been appointed by both Democratic and Republican judges. If a Democratic candidate does something that grants a FISA warrant, then it should be followed through.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Good day! Happy to talk about any future stories you think are lies.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Hmm well that is unfortunate. I don't really understand what this image is showing.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I'm sorry V Jeanne K I am confused by this re: the not having a peaceful transition of power. You give far too much credit when it comes to organization required for some giant scheme of collusion! If you are ever near DC Ill happily show you the chaos of a standard newsroom :)
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Do you think I lack an ounce of intelligence? Do you think I am a sheep? I don't think that about you. I think that we can agree to disagree with exchanging insults, yes?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Well anyway, I sense you are done with this conversation. I don't expect you to agree with me, but as I said before I do hope you consider that there are not sinister motives in the media. A lot of what you criticized comes down to "heavy is the head that wears the crown."
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I'm saying they cared about reporting the most important information at the time. The information was important because the Senate Judiciary Committee was considering the accusations ahead of a confirmation vote. Does that make sense?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast A lot of this is about news judgement. Most news judgement decisions come down to: who has the most power? Who can do something that really affects the lives of readers?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast They were newsworthy when senators were deciding how to vote. Now that Kavanaugh is a justice, it doesn't matter nearly as much. He's in that position for life and it would take a lot more than sworn declarations to remove him. Does that make sense?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I have to do some work but I will be back if you'd like to continue this conversation! I know its unlikely you'll think the media is great, but I do hope you can entertain the idea that its not sinister. Thank you for this civil and productive conversation.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Say you talk to person A w/their lawyer, they tell you that the dog ate their homework. You air a story reporting that. Then lawyer releases statement saying it was the cat. 		You're going to 1) be mad at the lawyer 2) talk directly to the person before you report anything else
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast ...and 2) To make money many places are creating tons of content as quickly as possible to get the most clicks
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I don't even know about the ice cream or koi fish fwiw.		Anyways, my larger point to all of this is doesn the media make mistakes? Surely. Are they perfect? No. Are there non-sinister reasons for it? You bet. Often it comes down to 1) those who have power get tougher coverage
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Id guess Hill story was written by a staffer who writes many short pieces a day. Its a screenshot so I cant click through. So whether they have time would depend on their workload. The Hill and many others produce as much content as possible to drive traffic. Not saying its ideal
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast What was he lying about while president? I am confused.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast On the NBC example, this is the timeline I get from that story:		1. Avenatti conferences in 2nd woman		2. Interview airs		3. 2nd woman releases sworn statement that contradicts conference call		4. NBC decides they need to talk to her w/out Avenatti, cant find her until after vote
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Depends on how you define nonstop mockery :) But if your point is that Obama can make mistakes and doesn't get criticized for them, again I'd say its because he's not currently president, doesn't have the nuclear codes anymore, etc. Recall the tan suit incident!
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast The biggest reason this doesn't happen is not some love for Obama -- it's that he's not president. His statements get far less attention than Trump's because he's not in the White House anymore.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast The party in power always gets more attention from the press, because they are able to do things that the minority party cannot.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast The Obama admin did not separate children from their parents. They did have pen-like housing for some kids that showed up without parents. One reason that isn't explicitly spelled out all the time is that Obama is no longer president and as such, not very powerful.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast The difference was that the Obama admin wasn't separating parents and children at the border. Does that make sense?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Is your critique with The Hill for tweeting the quote from President Obama? Or with President Obama?		I said in a reply that might've gotten lost that Obama definitely got a lot of criticism for not being prepared to handle the parent-less children at the border.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast We can also agree to disagree, of course. I think this has been a good, civil discussion and I respect your position on things.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I don't think its exclusive, but I think having a leader like President Trump who speaks as no other modern president has, makes a focus on the GOP more relevant. Really the focus should mostly on him, but he is the leader of the GOP.
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Yes okay, good example. The Obama administration did have a problem with an influx of immigrant children coming to the border without parents. At the time this was a big story, and the Obama admin got lots of negative coverage for that. I can pull up some links if you'd like.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast So in this case, the jaywalkers are pundits and the bank robber is Trump. 		Re: Scalise, are you referring to Bernie Sanders motivating the shooter?
@vjeannek @calvindanielsll @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Ha, I agree the umbrella story was not important. If there's a particular lie you you'd like to focus on happy to talk through it.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Yes, agreed re: people believing that! And that makes me nervous.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast Re: why this is getting a response, my guess is that people are genuinely frightened by President Trump's continued divisive rhetoric and so focusing on how we are all to blame seems like a distraction.		A metaphor might be ticketing jaywalkers when a bank robber is on the loose.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast What I'd like is to focus on what can make a difference. In this case, President Trump's commentary is what I really think could change things.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast My critique was with the tweet. I don't think its very meaningful right now to say "no one is perfect" when someone (the president) is such an outlier. 		I'm sure we'd all agree it's pretty futile in any situation to try to find someone or group that's perfect.
@thethirstymayor @elyse4design @DavidSm48146504 @mattklewis @CNN @thedailybeast I agree that the Scalise incident was horriffic. (My daughter's first time on the swings was next to that baseball field, I pass it every day.)		I do think the president is the outlier here. No one is innocent, but it is so unusual to have a president say the things he says.

Our society has agreed on a justice system that routinely makes decisions on innocence and guilt when there is no absolute proof. That the investigative processes that are the foundation for that system have barely been used is genuinely shocking to me.
...and Trump's election is what brought about #metoo and the record number of women running. So who knows what this episode will produce in return. The unintended consequences for Republicans moving so quickly on this could be enormous.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, I'm going to go ahead and predict that the reaction to that is going to be a lot closer to that of Trump getting elected than one might think.

@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Okay I‚Äôm going to bed. Sleep well @Blue_In_Green59 in the knowledge that your misdemeanors, whatever they are, are far superior to the misdemeanor of seeking aslyum at not a port of entry and so your kids, should you have any, are not going to be taken to a government shelter.
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 SAD!
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Have you HEARD of all these people speeding? So many of them do it. And they are US citizens! With no respect for the law!
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Are you mind reading every immigrants experience who arrives at the border? Are you like a crime psychic and you can just tell who is guilty and who is not? That would be like me saying I just know you are a speeder. You love to break the speed limit!
@_grammar_ Keep up the good work!
@_grammar_ Yes thank you it was an errant ‚Äúr‚Äù
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Shouldn‚Äôt you have more respect for your own country‚Äôs laws? You probably aren‚Äôt fleeing gangs when you speed. (I know im not.)
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Let he who is without (misdemeanors) cast the first stone. If you want to act like your misdeameanors are better than someone else‚Äôs because your are a citizen, fine. One could argue it‚Äôs worse because you are a citizen and you are willfully violating your own country‚Äôs laws.
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 And do you ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù or do you know? If you were living in Central America and didn‚Äôt speak English do you think you‚Äôd definitely know?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 You aren‚Äôt answering my question. You may think a 55MPH speed limit is stupid too. If you drive above it though, guess what? Misdemeanor time! Maybe your kids will go to the government shelter then
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Do you even know the threshold your particular state has for reckless driving versus a regular speeding ticket?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Are you scanning the federal register every day?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 What if the policy just changed? Would you know about it? Do you have magical powers to read executive agency rules?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 What if you‚Äôve just gotten lucky?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Have you memorized the US code? Are you absolutely sure?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 And FWIW, I don‚Äôt think your kids, if you have any, should be taken from you if you‚Äôve committed misdeamenors. And I don‚Äôt think @ovi8 kids should be taken from him for being drunk in public.
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 I can‚Äôt read your mind. You can‚Äôt read mine. Together, we certainly can not read thousands of asylum seekers minds. What I do know is that I am guilty of committing misdemeanors in my life and I do not think my 2 year old should be taken to a government shelter.
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 When I actually don‚Äôt know that and am not going to@pretend that I know your understanding of the law and what you‚Äôve done, much less thousands of other people
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Also, this is like the equivalent of me claiming that you, @Blue_In_Green59, absolutely 100% KNOW that you willfully committed misdemeanors
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Tell me @Blue_In_Green59 you‚Äôve never committed a misdemeanor, not once
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 Are you innocent?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel @ovi8 What do you think @Blue_In_Green59 ? I thought it was SIMPLE
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel You seemed to enjoy @ovi8 celebration in DC after winning the Stanley Cup. So did I. But did you know being drunk in public is a misdemeanor? It‚Äôs against the law. Should @ovi8 kids be taken away to a government shelter now?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel Do you have children @Blue_In_Green59 ? If you have committed misdemeanors in the United States, do you think they should be placed in government shelters? Is it really that simple?
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel Is it really that simple @Blue_In_Green59 ? Are you completely innocent of never committing a misdemeanor in your life?
For those who think that taking someone‚Äôs child away from them and putting them in to a government-run shelter is befitting of a misdemeanor: pledge that you have never jaywalked, never broken the speed limit. That is the same class of offense we are talking about.
@Blue_In_Green59 @aterkel I have. I have committed many misdemeanors in my life. I have jaywalked and I have broken the speed limit. Do you want to come take my 2 year old out of her crib and put her in a ‚Äútender time‚Äù shelter?

@MeghanMcCarthy_ @guhoya6 @USAirways take off time
@charles_gaba @DCHealthLink Adding a ?: will you release data on how many people had to apply on paper or on phone b/c site did not work?
@guhoya6 @USAirways people boarding now. new departure time is 9:45, though that seems ambitious. we are still in the emerald/ruby?? status
@guhoya6 he has arrived! the gate broke out with applause. nothing like a good angry airport crowd. @usairways
@guhoya6 yes. the gate agent has disappeared in the past 15 mins so...not a great sign. @usairways
@guhoya6 @USAirways yup. all the passengers managed to get here on time!
@guhoya6 heard the pilot is in a car on the way to airport. was delayed 30 mins then 1 hour. snowed here but not impossible. @usairways
@guhoya6 @USAirways I would guess no. Apparently pilot has not shown up in DC.
.@usairways can't recall a flight that was delayed because the pilot didn't show up on time. somewhat disconcerting. #dca #1992 #usairways
.@usairways the plane is at #DCA, the passengers are at #DCA, the crew is at #DCA...but not the pilot. we are one hour late. #1992
