On the world stage, President Trump undermines his own DOJ, his own intelligence community, and gives credence to Putin to do the same.
When asked again if he would denounce Russia's meddling in our elections, Trump again pivoted to a conspiracy theory about a 'missing' server. July 3rd, Trump's own appointed US attorney explicitly debunked this in court. He again shamelessly misleads the American people
Mr. President, you are the leader of the free world. You are the President of the United States. You do not insult your country by saying we are on par with Russia, who has attacked our elections, attacked our allies elections, and seized Crimea.
Embarassingly weak of our President to spend his entire address flattering Putin, when even Putin spoke more critically. Hope "great deal of time" Trump claimed to discuss election meddling was greater than this joint address has indicated.

The GOP‚Äôs CR leaves the statuses of DREAMers, 900 of which serve in our military, at the whim of an unreliable @WhiteHouse.

The GOP‚Äôs CR does not make CHIP permanent, which will cost our gov‚Äôt $6 billion according to the CBO, funds that would be better served toward affordable health care.

Which leads me to a sad and undeniable conclusion:		THIS PRESIDENT PEDDLES HATE
8) His speeches have been full of dogwhistles	9) And even Neo-Nazi and Alt-Right websites praised his initial #Charlottesville statement
6) One of his top advisers is an alt-right leader	7) He originally balked at the opportunity to do the bare minimum: call out Neo-Nazis!
4) His DOJ is rolling back voting rights and civil rights advancements	5) His DOJ is seeking ID of over 1 mil political dissidents
1) Trump started racist Birtherism conspiracy	2) He called Mexicans "rapists"	3) Just last night he retweeted a major alt-righter
