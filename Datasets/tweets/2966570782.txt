4) Stop gushing about what a good friend the DPRK's brutal dictator is. We need to stay clear-eyed and we need focused, smart policy when it comes to dealing with North Korea.
3) Trade symbol for symbol and action for action. That's how negotiations work.
2) Stop picking fights with allies like Japan and South Korea over nonsense so we can work together on important things. And for God's sake, don't cancel the joint military training exercises.
1) Set realistic expectations instead of going through cycles of saber-rattling and failed summits.

Calling our exercises with the South Koreans "provocative"? Committing to "security guarantees" in exchange for a handshake with a lying, calculating dictator? If we emerge from this situation with a nuclear and legitimized North Korea and no Asian allies, what have we gained?
President Trump is naïve. He promised Kim “security guarantees” while Kim didn’t say anything he hadn’t said already. Because he needed this meeting to be positive, he caved. Classic weak, know-nothing Trump.

All this after China agrees to a $500 million loan to a Trump-backed Indonesian infrastructure project. Small price to pay to get their ZTE slush company back up and running. Pay-to-play, this-for-that, quid-pro-quo. https://t.co/XDeEVzctdx
Rather than making the strong case for our national security interests and telling ZTE to sleep in the bed they made, Trump is letting them off the hook.
This is crony capitalism, except the crony in this case is a foreign state-controlled corporation that is a threat to U.S. businesses and security.
There’s no excuse for throwing allies under the bus, allowing the U.S. Ambassador to Germany to insult his hosts, and then letting a Chinese state-controlled enterprise off the hook for violating U.S. sanctions.

Trump seems increasingly unable to do the actual work of being President while dealing with his growing scandals and legal troubles. He seems unable to have a sustained focus on anything other than attacking the DOJ, FBI, and Special Counsel.
I have strong concerns about the fitness of their Commander in Chief, what these strikes will actually achieve, his lack of legal authority in ordering this action, and his failure to develop a broader strategy for Syria.
As a veteran of the Iraq War, I'm relieved that no US service members or allies were killed while executing last night's strike. It's a testament to their professionalism and courage.

…OR we could fund the desperately needed expansion of the veteran caregiver programs that support families caring for severely disabled veterans.
We should increase access to life-saving mental health care for veterans returning from war and address the increasing suicide rate resulting from undiagnosed &amp; untreated mental health issues.
Instead of spending billions on a wall that we don’t need, we could also address nutrition instability for the 1.5 million veterans on food stamps. Trump wants to slash this funding and make it harder for vets to put food on the table. 	https://t.co/0qyRVbbIOU
Using the National Guard to do border security is very expensive. For what it would cost the Guard to make just TWO arrests at the border, we could give a homeless veteran permanent housing for an entire year.
I personally have seen the unmet needs of men &amp; women who return from war. I served alongside them. Instead of wasting money to send troops to the border, @realdonaldtrump should consider honoring his promise to veterans &amp; their families. A few ideas off the top of my head:

Thank you, Sakshi, @DefendOurFuture and all of the young people out there. Keep up the good work! https://t.co/mgFz1zN0Uw
9A: Your voices matter. Staying engaged is critical. Meet with your lawmakers; write and call them. Educate yourself on the issues. Vote.
9A: I hear you, and I hope my colleagues in Congress and the thousands of elected officials across the country are listening as well.
9A: Young people have so much at stake. To protect our children and future generations, we need to #ActOnClimate now. https://t.co/7OmigEyOo5
A8: But it’s not just about his travel. @EPAScottPruitt is under numerous investigations for actions he’s taken in office – working in his own self-interest at the expense of the environment. He’s unfit for public office and he needs to go.
A8: I’m glad that he’s now traveling coach. His misuse of taxpayer dollars to fund first-class travel and accommodations is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/vTrEYiDD76
A7: Let’s be clear: @EPAScottPruitt’s toxic agenda is burdening taxpayers and future generations with the costs of climate change, pollution, and recovery costs from extreme weather.
A7: I am not impressed, to say the least. By rolling back environmental &amp; public health safeguards, it’s clear that @EPAScottPruitt is putting the interests of polluters before the health of our communities. https://t.co/y5EDMMgw6A
A6: We know that pollution disproportionately impacts communities of color and low-income communities. Slashing funding to EPA’s EJ programs would be devastating for the people who live in neighborhoods impacted by pollution. #Latinos4CPP https://t.co/kxbg3FaTsv
A5: This is a real problem. Arizona has a backlog of more than 750 leaking underground storage tanks. EPA support has been essential to monitoring these tanks and ensuring that polluters pay their fair share of cleanup costs. https://t.co/TOeSBjwS0o
A4: Cutting staff and hobbling EPA’s ability to hold polluters accountable means that entire communities would be at greater risk from hazardous pollutants in our water, air and soil.
A4: The proposed budget slashes funding that supports state and local air quality monitoring programs. Cleaner air means fewer Cod Red days on which parents must keep kids indoors, and fewer asthma attacks for the 175,000 Arizona children diagnosed with asthma.
A4: EPA’s budget is already at its lowest levels in decades while its responsibilities have increased significantly. The president’s proposal would threaten our health, our communities and undermine the growing clean energy economy.
A4: President Trump's proposal is wrong for a number of reasons, and we certainly can’t cover all of them in this conversation. I oppose cutting @EPA’s budget. https://t.co/tx4bDQf6X0
A3: Even if you can’t be in Gillette, WY, on March 27th for the last listening session on the repeal of the #CPP, you can still submit a comment – more than 500,000 have already done so: https://t.co/rkjWQsfS8L. https://t.co/mkvHPuE0d5
A2: A lot of companies have already taken steps to meet their responsibilities under the #CPP. Repealing it now would be a reckless move that would hurt those companies that have taken responsible steps to innovate and include enviro-conscious development in their bottom line.
A2: In my district, more than 10,000 are employed in clean energy industries and $149M has been invested. The #CPP encourages clean energy innovation and that means more job opportunities for everyone, including people living in underserved communities. #Latinos4CPP
A2: One analysis by @E2 found that repealing the Clean Power Plan could cost as many as 560,000 jobs and $52 billion in economic activity nationwide in 2030. #ProtectCPP https://t.co/vRjh7nZ3X6
A1: Finally, our actions have very real consequences for communities around the world who look to the United States for leadership on this issue. We should step up and join other nations who have made and are sticking to their commitments to act on climate change. #ProtectCPP
A1: We also have a duty to protect our environment so that future generations can enjoy the outdoors and inherit a healthier, safer planet. #ProtectCPP
A1: It’s a matter of public health. The #CPP aims to reduce harmful pollution &amp; improve air quality. Smog &amp; air pollution cause increased incidence of asthma, heart attacks, premature deaths – which disproportionately affect low income people &amp; ppl of color. We must #ProtectCPP https://t.co/ZsAXyIXEu8

I hope that President Trump &amp; his administration will take notice of the Dreamers who attend tonight’s address and it will remind them to get to work to fix the problem they created.
Like so many Dreamers, Antonio is a patriotic man, working hard and contributing to our community. Like so many Dreamers, his life was placed in limbo when @realDonaldTrump made the cruel &amp; callous decision to end the DACA program.
He also owns his own business, La Machine, focused on grassroots activism, community engagement &amp; voter contact programs in Arizona and the Southwest.
In 2011, Antonio was one of the founding members of Team Awesome, a group of Dreamers who canvassed to get progressives elected to the Phoenix City Council.
Antonio is a 27-year old DACA recipient who became involved in politics and community activism after he was denied entry to the Marine Corps due to his legal status.
Tonight, I’ve invited Antonio Valdovinos from Phoenix to attend the #SOTU with me.

@realDonaldTrump Don’t let the @GOP fool you. The #GOPTaxScam isn’t meant to help middle class families get the help they deserve. It’s flat-out Reverse Robin Hood – stealing from average Americans to further line the pockets of the rich. (12/12)
@realDonaldTrump Banks also WIN under the #GOPTaxScam, w/ a potential $6.4 billion tax cut for the 6 biggest banks. (11/)
@realDonaldTrump Elimination of the estate tax will save President Trump &amp; Commerce Secretary Ross ~1.1 billion &amp; will save DeVos ~$351 mil, Mnuchin ~$244 mil &amp; Rex Tillerson ~$150 mil (10/)
@realDonaldTrump Real estate moguls like @realDonaldTrump &amp; Jared Kushner will save millions through exemptions from major deduction eliminations. (9/)
@realDonaldTrump So who actually WINS under the #GOPTaxScam? The spoils of this tax plan go overwhelmingly to the richest Americans, including @realDonaldTrump &amp; his cronies. (8/)
@realDonaldTrump Small businesses LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. Most small businesses already pay less than 25% tax rate. Even this cut will mostly benefit LLC and S-corporate owners like @realDonaldTrump &amp; Betsy DeVos’s family. (7/)
@realDonaldTrump Homebuyers LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. The House tax plan would shrink by half the mortgage interest deduction for all new mortgages. (6/)
@realDonaldTrump Sick people LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. The House version of the bill eliminates the medical expense deduction used by families w/ high medical bills who need to cover costly procedures insurance won’t cover. (5/)
@realDonaldTrump Teachers LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. The bill eliminates a tax credit for the 99% of teachers who use their own $ for classroom supplies. Meanwhile, corporations will still be allowed to deduct business expenses like office supplies. (4/)
@realDonaldTrump Students LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. Tuition fee waivers will be treated as taxable income, raising grad student’s taxes. Elimination of the student loan deduction &amp; deduction for employer-provided assistance will worsen the student debt crisis. (3/)
@realDonaldTrump Children LOSE under the #GOPTaxScam. The weakened child tax credit excludes 10 million low-income children &amp; doesn't help the families that need it most. (2/)
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; his fans are obsessed with WINNERS and LOSERS. So who WINS and who LOSES under the #GOPTaxScam? (THREAD)

@POTUS Instead of threats &amp; over-the-top rhetoric, we need to pursue a smart, long-term strategy to address these growing threats. 2/

@realDonaldTrump Transgender people aren't a drain on the military, they help our military be what it is today - the most formidable force on the planet. 7/
