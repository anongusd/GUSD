@TheKevinBoyd @AOC Stop blindly revomiting fake news sources like Fox who want ratings not accuracy - Fox realizes AOC is a leader of the progressive movement capable of making sweeping changes that will hinder the corruption of the establishment for which they benefit
@TheKevinBoyd @AOC AOC (Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez) is currently the most lied about woman in congress - a large portion of the GOP &amp; Fox News is hoping that people believe their countless lies about her without fact checking
@TheKevinBoyd @AOC Not giving up cars - new reliance on electric cars. As for the meat, she told a child to cut back on meat (what almost any Dietitian tells most their clients) when he ASKED her about what he can do to protect the environment-she not once said anything about giving up farming
@TheGoodGodAbove Robert Reich, Ted Lieu, Alexandria Ocasia Cortez
