@odibro @AdamSinger I can't remember the specifics, but as I recall, it was an out-of-network ER doc, tho ER was in network. My insurance paid, but belatedly after ER started billing me directly, and I didn't have access to my insurance's receipt? Something like that.
@AdamSinger the whole time I kept thinking, I'm a health reporter and have the language/education to argue this out... how do average Americans deal w/ this (I know the answer, and it's depressing)
@AdamSinger I hate that patients have to go through this. I went through a similar (tho much lower stakes) back &amp; forth with Sutter, where they'd tell me verbally I had paid all I owed, then send me letters w/ bills. Refused to give me written confirmation I didn't owe anything.
@AdamSinger I'm so sorry you're going through this. =(

@PRB51 @HelenBranswell @FayCortez That's roughly what I tried to say- that it's similar to getting the flu from the subway every year, only safer because it won't replicate and make you really sick. But she feels that the vaccine isn't "natural."

@844y As for what non-genetic differences, things like diet, other comorbidities, could affect how a disease presents. Hope that helps.
@844y I think the only way to know the answer is to run the trials. AAs tend to get diagnosed younger with myeloma, but their cancer tends to be less aggressive. Scientists don't totally understand why. Zytiga (prostate cancer drug) works better in black men than white.
@844y We do address this in our story- it is an imperfect category. But potentially for environmental and other non-genetic reasons, there's evidence that disease can be experienced differently by patients of different races.

@jeet_mahal I've seen many cases tho, where drugmakers won't disclose the price in approval press release, waiting for a phone conference 2 hours later. That feels unnecessary to me. I'm pretty sure negotiations aren't happening in that 2 hr gap.

@statesdj @ESchattner Market withdrawal is also probably bad for patients if the drug works! I didn't realize til reporting this story that the FDA does have power to fine companies (w/o withdrawing drugs) for not complying with PMRs, but FDA has never done it.
@ESchattner Agree! 1o f the issues I tried to raise was the lack of post-market rigor. Many folks I talked to said it's fine to accelerate approval, but then we need to track. Are we OK w/ never knowing (or waiting many yrs to know) if there's clinical benefit?
@ESchattner I totally agree we all want better drugs ASAP especially for underserved populations. The central question to me is how much uncertainty are we willing to trade for speed, and are we doing that with open eyes?
@MarcSchwabish It‚Äôs hard to say definitively yet because a lot of studies aren‚Äôt complete, or use other surrogate endpoints as their measurements. Hopefully more data will be generated in coming years to answer this question.
@JMaraganore I respect the work you do, @JMaraganore, and always welcome your input- feel free to email any time.
@JMaraganore You miss my point. Certainly some great drugs have been created &amp; science is advancing (whatever you think of price, hard to argue Sovaldi isn‚Äôt good for patients!) But FDA acknowledges we trade speed for certainly &amp; these pathways are increasingly applied w less robust followup.

But FDA‚Äôs requirements for post-marketing studies to confirm benefit are less than robust‚Äîcompanies can take 10+ years to complete trials, and FDA has never fined a single one for missing a deadline.
For sure, nobody wants the FDA to take years to make decisions, especially when patients have no options. Balancing speed versus information is tricky. FDA often says they‚Äôll gather more information after drug goes on market.
The drug industry now pays 75% of FDA's drug review budget. Former FDA staff say that approvals get celebrated, rejections get questioned. 		FDA‚Äôs attitude: "Keep Congress off your back and make your life easier."

@Jjkam07 @adamfeuerstein I think the easy fix would be if there was reliable webcasting for all the breakout sessions. Even w/o the press, those rooms can't fit all the investors. It's not about "serving the press". Press are serving readers (incl investors who can't get in!)
@Jjkam07 @adamfeuerstein JPM already limits the number of press slots for this reason. You have to register, it's not a free for all.
@Internet__Rando I agree space is a problem but arguably that's why you need press there, to inform the investors who couldn't make it in. Also, as @bradloncar has long advocated, webcasting breakouts should be standard.
