Thank you to our sponsor, @ShopFloorNAM, and speakers @RepHolding, @RepJohnLarson, @dhume and Roy Kamphausen from @NBRNews! #OpenUpIndia
.@dhume: If the govt moves boldly, we could hope to see sustained high growth. #OpenUpIndia
The problems are enormous and the difficulties of addressing them in the right sequence is daunting, says Kamphausen @NBRNews #OpenUpIndia
Young people is possible India's greatest challenge. Needs to create about 1M new jobs a month to keep pace, says @dhume #OpenUpIndia
Modi is looking for investment anywhere he can find it, says @dhume #OpenUpIndia
There ought to be enough momentum to get it done sooner, says Kamphause at @NBRNews #OpenUpIndia
.@dhume So much talk of boosting U.S.-India relationship and goal is to turn $100B to $500B. Not particularly ambitious. #OpenUpIndia
If your benchmark for comparison is last govt, Modi's doing well. If it's the expectation from the election, then no. -@dhume #OpenUpIndia
Two biggest things Modi's done: 1. Changed the mood of India's economic story. 2. Stabilized macroeconomy, says @dhume #OpenUpIndia
.@dhume Manufacturing is not a silver bullet for India, but there's still room to have much more manufacturing that it has now. #OpenUpIndia
India has missed the manufacturing bus that allowed other Asian nations to lift people out of poverty, says @dhume #OpenUpIndia
The reason it's described as decisive is that for the first time since '84, a single party won a majority on its own -@dume #OpenUpIndia
.@PatrickFoulis asks, how decisive was PM Modi's victory? #OpenUpIndia
.@dhume There's been an upswing in the India-U.S. relationship since after the Cold War. Since '90s, greater interest. #OpenUpIndia
Mismatch of opportunity in India. Obstacles that couldn't seem to be resolved, says Kamphausen from @NBRNews #OpenUpIndia
Roy Kamphausen from @NBRNews discusses the difference between India and China. #OpenUpIndia
.@PatrickFoulis asks, what was the state of India before Modi? #OpenUpIndia Watch live: http://t.co/BVTkOTqUJP
RT @RepJohnLarson: @CQRollCall Thank you for letting me speak on how we can #OpenUpIndia on the day #RollCallTurns60 http://t.co/Ype5kYFWtF
The Economist's @PatrickFoulis leads our panel discussion with @dhume and @NBRNews. Watch live: http://t.co/BVTkOTqUJP #OpenUpIndia
On patents: the same concerns that apply to India, apply to China. Govts have to work on those issues. -@RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
If you bring in the rule of law, enforce patent protection and creating work in India, becomes great equalizer. -@RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
We can't reset view towards Asia without first making sure we're there to assist the nations that are our allies-@RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
Nothing brings more dignity to a person than a job, says @RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
On trade: We have to solve our issue here and India has to solve their issue there, says @RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
.@davidhawkings sits down with @RepJohnLarson at #OpenUpIndia
The promise that trade, in and of itself, will put people back to work is a hollow one, says @RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
Problems exist because of globalization. Not a bad term, but series of consequences, some good, others bad, says @RepJohnLarson #OpenUpIndia
.@RepJohnLarson takes the podium with a happy birthday to @rollcall! #OpenUpIndia #RollCallTurns60
Joining us now to speak on U.S.-India trade relationship, @RepJohnLarson. Watch live: http://t.co/BVTkOTqUJP #OpenUpIndia @ShopFloorNAM
.@RepHolding: India, for all its challenges, has built in advantages. More in the middle class than we have people in the U.S. #OpenUpIndia
Question to @RepHolding from the audience: Would it make sense to look at India more like Europe? #OpenUpIndia
We're negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with India now. Would also be a powerful signal India is open, says @RepHolding #OpenUpIndia
I'm excited. Is India open for business? It sure is, says @RepHolding #OpenUpIndia
I would predict that the U.S.-India relationship will be the defining relationship in the 21st century, says @RepHolding #OpenUpIndia
Corruption is on the retreat is India. Good for transparency, says @RepHolding #OpenUpIndia
On the last trip to India, Modi sat down with us. Every suggestion business brings him, he takes it serious, says @RepHolding #OpenUpIndia
.@RepHolding on Modi: We knew this was going to be a very important election. #OpenUpIndia
In his first year in Congress, @RepHolding led a CODEL to India. #OpenUpIndia
.@RepHolding speaks about what got him interested in India at #OpenUpIndia. Watch live: http://t.co/BVTkOTqUJP
Coming up now, @davidhawkings introduces our first keynote speaker @RepHolding, watch live: http://t.co/BVTkOTqUJP #OpenUpIndia
Manufacturers were encouraged when PM Modi said India was open for business, but we haven't see the results - @JayTimmonsNAM #OpenUpIndia
