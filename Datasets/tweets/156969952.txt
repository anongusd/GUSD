Last month @USDA and @HHSGov announced the members of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee who will examine #nutrition science across the lifespan, including for pregnant women, infants, and toddlers from birth to 24 months in their scientific report.
Over half of our #WIC state agencies now have Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) We thank you for your hard work and efforts as we progress towards the goal of nationwide EBT by 2020. –Acting Deputy Under Secretary Brandon Lipps #NWAWLC19
In the wake of a devastating hurricane season, #WIC approved flexibilities to ensure mothers and their children continued to receive nutritional support.
In September FNS announced a $2 million cooperative agreement with @JohnsHopkins for the development of new tools and resources to improve #WIC services.
FNS understands the importance of having a strong network to help mothers achieve their breastfeeding goals which helps support a healthy start in life for many babies and is a foundation for self-sufficiency – Acting Deputy Under Secretary Brandon Lipps #NWAWLC19
Last August @USDA launched the WIC Breastfeeding Support campaign, connecting families with helpful resources and support wherever they are in their breastfeeding journey.
