@EFF @BryanQuinn1981 Good, if any university system in the US can make Elsevier squirm it would be the Cali system. Would be nice if a few other big systems came along too to force Elsevier to lower university subscription prices so science does not get held back as Cali and Elsevier duke it out.

@JaggerMickOZ If it facilitates heat transfer to space it must also facilitate heat transfer back to Earth. 		CO2 does not emit radiation in any preferential direction.

@JaggerMickOZ That represents energy that, without the extra CO2, would've gone into space.
@JaggerMickOZ Again Mike scores an own goal. 		If CO2 absorbs and reemits energy from outgoing IR, how can there not be a temperature increase if you put more CO2 in the way. Some of that radiation from CO2 is gonna be emitted toward the Earth.

@JaggerMickOZ Not as in CO2 absorbs energy, goes to pub, does some laundry, then reemits.
@JaggerMickOZ By "trap heat" I mean absorb or scatter then emit back to Earth this that energy stays on Earth - some also emitted away too.
@JaggerMickOZ Exactly why the coolant analogy is not a good one

@BryanQuinn1981 Centrifugal force rant over. It's totally valid, but only in rotation and all that, so there you go hard nosed physicists!
@BryanQuinn1981 But whatever. It has real world concequences and exists as a description of a physical phenomenon. Atmospheric and oceanic motion would be extremely difficult to describe if you tried to describe both as inertial references frames. Why? Cuz Earth is a spinning sphere, lol!
@BryanQuinn1981 Anyway, centrifugal is just kinda a different type of force for non inertial (accelerating) reference frames and I feel like the physics types who call it a pseudoforce are playing semantics, which I guess is important in physics. It's not a "real force" in a Newtonian sense.
@BryanQuinn1981 Reference frame and so feel a "force". Same with spinning, you are trying to not accelerate (accelerate bis both changing speed and direction so spinning, even at constant rotation rate is accelerating as you are changing direction) so you feel like you are gonna be thrown off.
@BryanQuinn1981 Lol, you could be a physicist then as they really don't like centrifugal as it isn't a "real force." It's really just the spinning version of feeling pushed against a seat when accelerating a car. Nothing is pushing you back, rather you are trying to stay in the same inertial...
@BryanQuinn1981 Thank you. Glad it is enjoyable and most of all clear! Very glad it makes sense.

@DawnTJ90 I would hardly calling this "trashing" - all of this is basically correct. Paleoclimate records are not as good as actual observations.
RT @MichaelEMann: Just saw this--thanks so much! https://t.co/S40Mg7cerK
@MichaelEMann This is a good use of this GIF! Climate deniers' insane screaming definitely reminds me of the spine chilling Ring Wraiths' screeching. Keep promoting the truth Dr. Mann!
@DawnTJ90 If it was not made public, how do ya know about it?
@stevecripe57 @MichaelEMann Michael is not the "dork," @LifeIsThermal is.
@DawnTJ90 Again, I am not talking about precision in models. No one would ever suggest that paleoclimate work is to increase climate model precision.
@DawnTJ90 And they also generally agree well.
@DawnTJ90 Also, where did I say anything about uncertainty/precision. Proxies are mostly for increasing accuracy.
@DawnTJ90 K
@DawnTJ90 Also, Wally here is referring to the Holocene Climatic Optimum, round 8-6 (or so) thousand years ago, not MCA. Highest insolation in the Holocene.
@DawnTJ90 More not from wally		I've been trying to figure out the issue of "Was there a &gt;&gt; &gt; Medieval &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Warm Period, and if so where and when" for a decade or so, and still &gt;&gt; &gt; have the &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;impression that the records for the 9th through 14th centuries are &gt;&gt; &gt; extremely &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;mixed
@DawnTJ90 There are plenty of other ways to see if MCA was globally warm outside of the few places glaciers exist. For example, here in the US West there is little evidence of a warmer MCA, only a drier one.
@DawnTJ90 Yeah, paleoclimate proxies are a good way to improve models. So what.
@DawnTJ90 More		"The geographic pattern of Holocene climate fluctuations remains murky, but several things are clear. The Little Ice Age and the subsequent warming were global in extent." Note lack of the word medieval
@DawnTJ90 These are quotes from your link		They call this a own goal
@DawnTJ90 "The case for a global Medieval Warm Period admittedly remains inconclusive"
@DawnTJ90 "Evidence for the Medieval Warm Period from other parts of the world exists but is spotty and/or circumstantial"
@DawnTJ90 LOL, proxy evidence for cooling, like Baffin Island glacier extent - this paper and some of Giffs other stuff - lines right up with large volcanic eruptions near the equator.

@DawnTJ90 So, most paleoclimate papers cite models because they are either trying to test their results or see what results they should be getting when different models diverge.

@pyochum81 @The_KingfishSA @NateSilver538 Exactly. In 1960 some people voted for Kennedy because he looked better on TV than Nixon, though Nixon was the vastly more experienced candidate. The election was so close that that easy could have swayed the election (along with other variables of course).

@NateSilver538 I don't see why he shouldn't try for president. It's not like he has to declare for one or the other now. He can try president, if it goes nowhere he can do a Rubio and switch to Senate. End of story.

@NateSilver538 But also, to some degree the problem is so big and we waited so bloody long that solutions are gonna have to involve a lot of "The Feds doing lots of big expensive things."
@NateSilver538 Again, this is like reason #5 or something that we didn't do something about this sooner, but this is such an important problem, I would not have glued on all the extra stuff.
@NateSilver538 I think the climate policies of GND are good if vague, but I worry they are attaching it to so many unnecessary other liberal things (that I generally support). So while that's a new strategy legislatively, its not new in the public sphere of ideas.
@NateSilver538 I feel like one reason (of many, see oil &amp; gas interests) climate policy has not advanced much is the above. It came in on the environmentalism horse to some degree and so carried all the other very liberal stuff that that movement decided to attach to itself.

@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost My point is that "take Calif away" then XYZ is a silly and pointless argument.
Interesting. Did the math on this. Under a popular vote for president CA &amp; NY dem voters only get about 9-10% of the total national vote, but, because electoral college is winner take all (expt ME &amp; NB), in EC they get about 15% of the vote. https://t.co/yIq9NZtn7R
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost https://t.co/BaMzIpENsB		You need more than ~9-10% of the vote to win.
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost Well, every single state governor is chosen by "mob rule"
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost https://t.co/HrPGoQDekG		According to this math, getting rid of the EC would actually weaken CA &amp; NY Democrats power in choosing the president.
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost In fact, just did the math, this is interesting. 		NY and CA total have a total of 84 electoral college votes. Total is 538. 		That means in the electoral college, NY and CA Dems control 15.6% of the vote. So gettin' rid of EC weaken those Dem voters.
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost Which I seriously doubt you would be so gungho about if it favoured Dems instead
@BernieSanders Btw I was assuming undergrad only. I'm not sure what Bernie thinks about the cost if medical school or somesuch
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost Again, as my simple math shows, no one can win with just CA &amp; NY, nor get anywhere close.
@TonyOceanDreams @denverpost So? If I take out Ohio, Kerry won. If I take out literally any R state in 2000, Gore wins. 		Please have a point.
@MileHighMagic30 @denverpost No one said they didn't
@MileHighMagic30 @denverpost It's also one which does not make the point very forcibly.
@MileHighMagic30 @denverpost Lol, this is just a legal argument. If NPVIC got to 270 and went into effect the Supreme Court almost certainly would rule on it, but it hasn't yet, so I'm not interested in some person's legal arguments.

@terri_zerr @LevaultBill @9NEWS Yes, and you seemed to have made an error here about it not counting.
@Istaphobe @LevaultBill @RealTT2020 @9NEWS Wow thanks for your insightful comments
@Cat69Q @LevaultBill @9NEWS Yup, and the states have a right to change the rules if they want to.
@Cat69Q @LevaultBill @9NEWS No "states" count as a whole block more or less without EC. And guess what, now all the blue state Rs votes would count!
@Cat69Q @LevaultBill @9NEWS Let's try some math here		Cali in 2016 gave Clinton 8,753,788 votes, and NY 4,556,124. Total CA &amp; NY = 13,309,912. Total votes cast for any candidate = 136,669,276		So Clinton's NY &amp; CA voters make up 9.7% of all the votes cast. So no, CA &amp; NY can't decide the pres. alone w/o EC
@Roxiemusic2018 @Telegraph Those were the comments I was referring to. üòÉ

@LevaultBill @9NEWS Sadly, for you, the Constitution does not say how states are to apportion electoral college votes.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS I am god damned tired of self righteous conservatives who think they and only they love this country and all others are unpatriotic, Communist, traitors.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS And this country too. It's a bloody good one. I love it so much, when I see it needs improvement I demand it be improved, when I see it stumble on false old ideas, I help let it up and out of it old erroneous ways.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS I love the Constitution. Best in the world by far. My favourite part is the bit about amending it as times change.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS Sure Clinton was a bad candidate, but you just don't like getting rid of the EC because you know Republicans would only have won one election in the last quarter century without it.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS Not if you got rid of the EC. Now all the conservatives in northern California or upstate NY would have a reason to vote again cuz then their votes would count!!
@gandiolsen That's cuz that's what the evidence shows
@gandiolsen That last bit is not correct
@LevaultBill @9NEWS 2nd graders could do it
@LevaultBill @9NEWS The way you get these numbers is you take the number of voters in a state, divide by the number of electoral college votes that state has and compare the states. It's not witchcraft or mumbo jumbo.
@gandiolsen Science is not scepticism, it's investigation by hypothesis and investigation of those hypothesis. Scepticism is part of the process, but not the whole.
@gandiolsen I have no idea
@gandiolsen I don't think the planet will be destroyed, nor does any other scientist. Very negativity impacted, yes. Destroyed, no.
@LevaultBill @CaryurC @9NEWS K
@LevaultBill @9NEWS Literally one voter in Wyoming has the voting power of 3.7 people in California. How is that "equal voting rights"
@gandiolsen Have I shut down you scepticism and not allowed you to argue?
@LevaultBill @CaryurC @9NEWS If it's so bad than I guess the D's will lose the state house in 2020. 		Prediction noted and filed.
@gandiolsen It also does not go forward if we wreak a significant proportion of the world's prosperity by not acting on issues we know to be of existential threat.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS Again, why should "coast people's" vote count for less than anyone else's
@gandiolsen It's not highjacked. Trust me, we are doing real legitimate science.
@LevaultBill @9NEWS If that's were folks live, yes. 		If "all people are created equal," then all their votes should be equal. A New Yorker is no less and no more a human than a Bismarckian in North Dakota.
@gandiolsen I am sorry, you are mistaken on this point. Maybe some folks investing in wind turbines or something, but not cut &amp; dry academia scientists.
@gandiolsen While folks in the sci community think CC is real, myself and every other scientist I know wishes deep deep down that we are wrong. None of us want what we think is happening to be happening and that's why we are trying to figure it out.
@gandiolsen Thank you.		Whenever I have an argument with a person sceptical of CC but the argument goes in positive direction, I always like to tell folks this (next tweet):

@gandiolsen Thats part of the reason I work in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. To try to get a better idea of how the Earth works beyond the short time period we humans have been watching it.
@redco2012 @LevaultBill @9NEWS Will do. Thanks! üëçüëç
@gandiolsen I was convinced by the evidence I saw and thought it would be deeply immoral not to do this as my career.
@gandiolsen I certainly have no wish for you to die. Absolutely not and I can assure you that almost no one else in the field wants that either. 		That's why I work in climate science and I'm not doing paleontology like I wanted to do as a kid.
@gandiolsen So climate change is fake cuz other factors might be effecting polar bear populations? 		Ya know, the Science is based on lots of stuff other then estimates if polar bear populations.
@gandiolsen Also, what is your source in this meme, neither of those two things I have ever heard.
@gandiolsen Top tips: when ya get proven wrong just shout "it's fake" and have a tantrum.
@gandiolsen Look up the term "anomaly" -- from the map on the right. Literally is a comparison to average melt the time of year. So incorrect again.

@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin @LifeIsThermal No I can't, I have no idea. That's one good reason to be sceptical of how well that equation is really working since we don't seem to have a good idea of what answer we are supposed to get.

@gandiolsen Yeah it's ticker tape. Old school
@gandiolsen And before you say any silly rubbish about the "new ice age" thing in the 70s, that *WAS* a small group of scientists meet mostly septically by the rest of the community, but whose idea got some newspaper headlines cuz it sounded exciting

@secretbetteryou @voxdotcom What your asking for is very silly. You want scientific evidence that something works that we have not tried. 		NEWSFLASH!		Ya have to run an experiment before you have scientific evidence to prove something.

@Chemjobber @NREL Errata:		1) or really any footprint, but focused on Dino's cause I was obsessed with dinos		2) &amp; a battery
@Chemjobber @NREL I remember I got the idea online somewhere, but I don't remember how it worked. Had something to do with mag field &amp; Aurora Borealis. I know I compared the data to actual Aurora data &amp; it kinda worked.
@Chemjobber @NREL 4) used a neodymium magnet on a taught string and something with a Lazer pointer to track something about Earth magnetic field. I don't really remember how it worked or what I was doing specifically. 		I never won.
@Chemjobber @NREL 3) how changing fluid chemistry changes eruption time of geysers. Made a model geyser with a hot plate from ARC store, a flask with tube out top, corked on top. Added like a bit of gasoline (supposed to be human pollution), baking soda or lemon juice to change pH, stuff like that
@Chemjobber @NREL I did 		1) seeing how different sediment types preserved dino print morphology (probably did not use that word üòÉ)		2) electrical conductivity of some different household substances using some cups, wires, &amp; my dad's voltimeter
@annvalentine @Chemjobber Ridiculous that they didn't.		People who use parents lab access should be disqualified.
@annvalentine @Chemjobber I would have awarded you the winner at this science fair.
@annvalentine @Chemjobber Yours is a good study. 1) actually an experiment and 2) actually extremely important.		Did you know we have a desalination plant on the lower Colorado River because of too high salinity from agricultural runoff. This is a REAL problem -- unlike seeing if hamsters have hemoglobin.
@Chemjobber @NREL ***You bet, that kid did
@Chemjobber @NREL Sorry @NREL you got ated at.
@Chemjobber When I was a kid, the parents of one of the other kids ran the sci fair (her dad worked at @NREL too, so he hÃ∂eÃ∂lÃ∂pÃ∂eÃ∂dÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂nÃ∂ did her projects) and guess who won those years. You beat, that kid did! 		Guess which of is now an actual real scientist?

@NikolovScience @ClimateOfGavin &amp; Gavin is fully right not to get into bad faith "debates" as well.
@NikolovScience @ClimateOfGavin &amp; no, I am not willing to "debate" with people who knowingfully misrepresent science, esp. ones who publish bad papers and then change the subject when they see they messed up.
@realDonaldTrump It this the dollar bin replacement for your military parade?

@2DoisToby @PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus Yeah, I don't think CC is gonna work without some renewable energy supply either. I'm not convinced they can get a net removal rxn if they use fossil fuel derived power. But stitch to a non fossil fuel energy source, then it's a whole new game.
@risingfluids @CriticalStress_ I stepped into it in a tightly mood not realizing there were so many people. Oops.		Cool that there are two D. Oppos in the "Earth Sciences".

@LifeIsThermal @cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Or defining what random thing you are waving around!
@LifeIsThermal @cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Again, you, just like your friend Carl, threw some random thing out and shouted, prove me wrong! without even defining what you want to be wrong about.
@LifeIsThermal @cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin What specifically about it?
@RedTRaccoon @MTF_Tweets I was gonna recommend		1) Skallagr√≠msson after Egil Skallagr√≠msson, after the hero in a famous Nordic saga &amp; earlier settler of Iceland		2) Cetshwayo after the king of the Zulu Empire during the Anglo-Zulu War &amp; lead the victory of British at Isandlwana		But no, the rules &amp; regs
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Also that I have to look up elsewhere what the real values are is dubious as well. Very shoddy.
By the way, the reason this irritates me is that it would be a good opportunity to get the public involved in science, but no because of the dumb naming rules it isn't. https://t.co/WlLmeL46R8

@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin And I would like too see how well this equation works for say every planet and large moon rather than just two plus Earth.		 I'll wait.
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Nor is it really particularly close for Titan. 		Again you seem to have a back of the envelope equation for estimating planetary temps from TSI idealised for estimating Earth's temp. So what?
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Okay, well it's still not very close. 		https://t.co/TcM5eSkXAA
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Typo, *you're
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin I am not sure how this equation is derived, but it bears little resemblance to the correct way to estimate temp from SB law and radiation ins and outs. It seems to be similar but with values changed a bit to nudge the answer closer to correct.
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin More than double actually. Equation fail.
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin Besides, the estimated Venus temp is not even remotely correct. Really is ~735 K. So your off by almost double.
@cdjstrydom @ClimateOfGavin What's your point. That there is a back of the envelope way to estimate global average temp from TSI. Groundbreaking work here.

@LeslieDHopper @RadioFreeTom Almost everyone who wants to go by Dr. So&amp;so is an asshole, it's almost like a scientific rule.
@LeslieDHopper @RadioFreeTom I use them if folks want me to, but I have found, at least in the scientific world, that they are widely disliked.
@LeslieDHopper @RadioFreeTom No, suggesting not using formal terms automatically means I disrespect everyone is silly. Try again.
@SHuggins67 @RadioFreeTom Titles. And c) I don't like decorum or any of that. The president is merely the most public citizen and I think should be treated as such and not more, and certainly should be ridiculed when ridiculous.
@SHuggins67 @RadioFreeTom Humm... but a) I think Trump has already proven otherwise, long before he was elected, b) I don't think I ever used the title if Obama, just called him Obama. One thing I liked about Bernie was that he was Bernie, not Mr. Sanders, so I guess that is a refection of my dislike of..
@SHuggins67 @RadioFreeTom Oh yeah, people coming to opinions about folks beforehand is bad. I know several police officers from various ways. Every single one is an outstanding person.

@RadioFreeTom And I think the results have been really great. Basically no one on some massive ego trip like the stereotype professor of the 1950s. That kind of professor is an endangered species.
@RadioFreeTom Seems fine to me. Best time in human history. More democracy, better health, most equal between races and genders, and so on. Lots of things need to be improved, but that the world today is not bloody great relative to everything else is an odd viewpoint.

@RadioFreeTom Should be "...so few respect Trump..."
@RadioFreeTom Ugh typos!!
@RadioFreeTom And that this is hardly a new "problem"
@RadioFreeTom I was not complaining, I was just pointing out one if the reasons so few disrespect Trump is due to the insane disrespect given to Obama, who, at least, deserved more respect.
@RadioFreeTom I also seriously doubt being nice to Trump would make Republicans more likely to be nice to the next Dem. Being mean might make them worse to the next Dem, but it likely does not work the other way round.

@cy_beh @skdh I don't think so. There is a lot less herd like behavior amount climate science than the public tends to think. Most things widely agreed on are either 1) very well founded, like freshwater would slow down or interupt AMOC or 2) generally vague, like "this is a big problem"
Not that that is necessarily relevant to physics, but I have always found it a strange location to start doing science since it sets preconditions on your explorations of something unknown.
This is interesting. From the Geosciences perspective I have always found theoretical physicists insistence on "beauty or elegance" odd. No one would ever describe the natural world behaving in a mathematically elegant way, quite the opposite. 	 https://t.co/bbEJ5X2hIT

@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Okay? I never suggested that.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Well, some folks who die in or have negative health effects from meltdowns where most certainly not working on them.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus I know, that's the point.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus No, but included are work place accidents. No one could argue that working on wind turbines seems risk adverse.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Okay, well, good luck convincing the public on this one.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus One is choice the other isn't
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus We are gonna need more REEs and other trace metals for other stuff anyway. Batteries for example. Or as additives in high grade metals. So we are gonna have to do it with or without more solar panels.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus I do and so would most people
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus That's cause it is poorly managed. Earth's economic REE deposits are likely not large enough to supply human needs anyway, so will have to come from iron meteorite mining.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus People having on job accidents and people dying from a power plant meltdown are two totally different things. One is someone who accepts risk when taking a job, the other is citizens harmed by bad management or ill luck. Not a good comparison.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus I think anyone aware of former uranium mine problems in the US West would disagree with this. Certainly new solution mining techniques are better, but arguing impacts are low seems specious.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus I know, but they don't produce hazardous products nor do they cause localized disasters when they have something go wrong.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus If I remember right folks were also worried about Sr too but similar story.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Yeah, they have low efficiently. So what.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Cesium definitely bioaccumulates. But the amount released seems to have been small enough it dilluted fast enough to not have a major impact. But saying none if it can bioaccumulate is incorrect.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus I definitely am not okay with that. Even less so. But better than extracting &amp; burning organic materials is a pretty low bar.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Yeah, as I said, the ocean is big compared to the volume released
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Just so you don't tell me the field was okay with what happened, they weren't at all.
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus And you are talking to a (Paleo)oceangrapher by the way.

@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Until someone shows me a coherent way to prevent meltdowns and do something with the waste other than shove it in a mountain I am not convinced expansion is a good idea.
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus The dangers I am aware of (if it ever works, lol) are 1) too much energy generation -&gt; heat and 2) again to much energy and humans messing up other things at large scales as it becomes possible to do so energetically speaking. Both seem kind of arm wavy and assuming misuse.
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus Probably not my lifetime, but within the lifetime of someone born today, maybe.
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus Which was a bad idea in my opinion
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus And something of a larger scale than renewables can do will be necessary at some point in the future or humanity will have to self enforce stagnation.

@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus But I agree, we need to start switching to ~100% renewables NOW or we will never have that kind of future!
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus Someday, if we want a Star Trek like future, we are gonna have to do something along these lines. Renewables with required trace metals from say iron meteorite mining works today, but not in 2150.
@PaulGizelt @RadicalGoats @EricHolthaus No to an energy source with no harmful products and without risk or melting down and spraying crazy isotopes all over the place? But why?
@RadicalGoats @PaulGizelt @EricHolthaus Maybe, we will see, but there has been a noticeable uptick in their optimisum in the  last year-ish, which *might* mean something. Who knows.

@EDOMLIH @NewYorker Incentives to get people to not smoke are good as no one needs access to tobaccoo. But people need access to medicine irrespective of their weight.

@tom__de @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins Maybe, but that's how states feel in the US, but few call for leaving. Maybe it is better to give up a bit of sovereignty in order to get the nice things that more unification gives like greater international power or coherent trade policy.
@Sands777 @RichardDawkins Okay, some folks wanted one though. How many?, enough that remain wins, maybe?, not enough for that, maybe?
@tom__de @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins I am not sure. I think it is better to have it, even if it is inefficient. The EU certainly makes Europe able to act more coherently on the international stage.

@turnerabcd @RichardDawkins Who are all of these halfwitted cheesecakes liking this garbed comment.
@Carla_littlerob @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins The argument is not about is leave a good  or bad idea or are leave/remain views accurate, but just about the precision of the options in the initial referendum.
@Carla_littlerob @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins No one else said that. The point us about precision of statement, not accurately of statement nor if something is a good or bad idea. Just precision.
@WestEssexTaxis @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins That's not the point of the metaphor. 		Could be stated "stay where you are is precise, go somewhere else is not precise"
@tom__de @simonhancock_uk @turnerabcd @RichardDawkins Thanks for this thoughtful question. I think it part of home. Given the wars the British fought in Europe, I would think most British people would see Europe as home, or part of it. They shed so much for the idea of Europe, it confuses me that they want to leave.
@Sands777 @RichardDawkins Yeah they did to leave, but how many voted for say a Norway like option vs a no deal like leave vs etc - who knows, some. That's exactly why I think the first referendum was flawed.
@Markeaton999 @RichardDawkins Okay, then I guess remain is a fairly certain vote -&gt; more EU. Sounds bonny to me.

@metaburbia @RichardDawkins Remain is fairly soecific, it is we (UK) want to be part of a more integrated EU and want to have a role in deciding what that looks like. Sounds fairly specific to me. About as specific as you can expect in future geopolitics.

@mulier_loquax @RichardDawkins Based on your logic, voting remain seems fairly precise. Remain would this say "I am good with increased EU integration and we want to remain a part of that process. That seems fairly specific.
@mulier_loquax @RichardDawkins Lol, the only thing you proved is that the future is uncertain.

@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Changing the impactor comp and physics certainly does not disprove the idea, but it is not intellectually rigorous.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Is that what it is now? What about the Pt? Petaev et al and Moore both conclude it must have been an Ir poor Fe Meteorite?
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE What angers folks is when others demand they accept their idea on incomplete evidence and act outraged or accuse others of being unscientific for doing so.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE That's how science works. Everyone is open to this but the evidence needs to be REALLY good! It currently is not.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE The composition has changed, so has the impact mechanism, and now, with this Hiawatha speculation so has the whole no crater thing.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE I dislike the way the hypothesis changes everytime they run into a problem. I count that was goal post shifting.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Look, the YDIH is an extraordinary claim. I am only open to it if there was extraordinary evidence as the YD is entirely explainable without it. Extraordinary is not the current state of the evidence.
@CosmicTusk @Marc_Young_90 @JoeMacGregor So because one is older than the other means it's okay to speculate without facts on the age of a crater?

@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Moore paper.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE And now it was not an airburst or diddly impact, now it's one that makes a bleeding 19 mile crater UNDER AN ICE SHEET!!!!! But also somehow does that without creating a local impact ejecta in in the ocean only 30-40 km away. https://t.co/crOhN1OcRt
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE &amp; YDIH shouldn't talk about goal post moving. First it was an airburst or stream of chondrules or comets, then it was an iron meteorite because how do you get so much Pt from a chondrules, again with no impact structure. First it hit the LIS, then not, now Greenland.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE LOL!!! Looking at the more paper more closely, the US sites have more Pt than GREENLAND!! Lol. 		RIP Hiawatha.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Pt anomalies have also been associated with volcanism.		 https://t.co/NXRDxhDznM
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE From the the Moore paper above		"This study finds no evidence to contradict the conclusions of Petaev¬†et al.1..." 		So if that evidence showed a bigger impactor, why not say it?
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Why would GISP data being from years older do anything. There conclusions are based on concentrations in the ice core, not spread of signature?
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE No, but a mid sized body, like the one Boslough suggested in 2013 could. There are other sizes of meteors other than small and creates 19 miles wide crater. Again, the Pt anomalies are too small for a really big (19 mile crater) impact.
@CosmicTusk @Marc_Young_90 What is this about. So what? https://t.co/JmTKnvTxqm
@CosmicTusk @Marc_Young_90 Yeah, they did so as suggesting Hiawatha is YD age factlessly speculation and flys in the face Pt evidence.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE A 19 mile crater under an ice sheet.
@CosmicTusk @TonyAngelo @NASA_ICE Some kinda small extraterrestrial body probably. At least that's that Petaev et alia (the Pt in GISP) core concluded. From their abstract, the object was "unlikely to result in an airburst or trigger wide wildfires proposed by the YDB impact hypothesis". Aka not something to make

@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Referring to the so called evidence
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE If there are supposed to be nanodiamonds (nevermind that some were actually not diamond, but graphene, lol) all over the world, we are not all over the place on these seds?
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE You are telling me that a meteor creating a 19 mile wide crater through ice and, according to YDIH, massively changing Earth's climate would have no local sedimentary signature?
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE And before you get on your Pt icecore horse don't forget the authors of that paper concluded the that source, if a meteor would be "unlikely to result in an airburst or trigger wide wildfires proposed by the YDB impact hypothesis" Hardly something to make a 19 mile wide crater.
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE If indeed you are suggesting Hiawatha is YD, you need to prove it.
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Scatted in random spots, commonly not replicable, not at all contiguous, with (sometimes) dodgy geochronology.
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE And before I answer any of your questions you have to prove that Hiawatha dates to YD. Right now you are just factlessly speculating with precisely zero evidence at that's how old it is.
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE https://t.co/rXWEOAcALS
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Ugh typos. Mean to say some of the cores are EXTREMELY close to the site.
@martinsweatman1 @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Literally these some cores are only a few 10s of km away. You are serious telling me an impact which would make 19 mile crater under an ice sheet would leave no local fingerprint. Rubbish.

@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Anyway, destroying ozone should result in a increased cosmic ray flux and massive increase in insitu production of cosmogenics.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk But so far it has just been theoretical/Emanuel having fun with math or getting people worked up.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Then Dino's die of cancer basically. Also helps explain why burrowing animals more easily survived.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I have also heard some rumors of folks think about doing a stable cosmogenic nuclide study for KPg to test Kerry Emanuel's hypercane hypothesis (impact should have heated oceans to temp you theoretically would have hurricane that can extend to top of atmosphere &amp; destroy O3 layer
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Renne is the guy who helped/lead redating of KPg and found it to actually be 66 Ma not 65 Ma recently.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Also I think Paul Renne at Berkeley has been doing some dating stuff
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk She is very much on the volcanism&gt;asteroid side, has been involved in a lot of the newer dating, et cetera.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Try "KPg impact volcanism", "asteroid volcanism", combos like that and do some reference mining. 		Also check out Gerta Keller at Princeton. She is like the Cretaceous volcanism queen.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Yeah, it was really weird.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Yup, that is sort of the idea. A ground truth for antipodal impact volcanism.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Oh no, that's one of the big things going on now in KPg stuff. Lots if people doing high precision Argon argon dates to get better chronology of large end K volcanism.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk He did this really weird thing where he U dated the bones and found they "dated" to after K, well la. Nevermind that U dating a fossil tells when when it was replaced with apatite, not when it died &amp; that uncertainty for dates U dating fossils is HUGE!!
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk James Fassett. Retired from USGS
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Saw him talk a GSA once in Denver. He seemed a bit weird.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Looked him up again (been awhile since I have checked up). His name is Fassett
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I sorta check out is stuff every now &amp;then just in case, but it is pretty quixotic.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Interestingly there is a guy here in CO who thinks he has Paleocene dino fossils from San Juan Basin i think. But his stratigraphy has been really sloppy or the bones appear to be reworked into later river sediments. So there is always some curmudgeon.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Yeah I know some people were super recalcitrant about it. Folks don't like being wrong I guess. Most of those folks have switched sides or are retired/passed on. I am sure there are probably some folks who still don't.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I know, but the argument is more about to what degree each played, not one or the other. Often things have more than one cause &amp; it can be difficult to state which was most significant.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Okay, well best of luck!
@TonyAngelo @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Also, it is now the even confirmed that either are an impact structure yet. Not all circular things are craters.
@TonyAngelo @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE There is no evidence that either impact is YD age. It is just sometime in the last several million years. Based on the fact that no impact debris exists in YD age sediments from around Greenland would suggest neither of these craters is YD age.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Certainly some people 30 yrs ago refused to accept it, but not really now.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk A role if secondary.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Refuse is too strong a word here. There are legitimately difficulties in fully explaining how literally all non-avian Dinos went extinct. I don't think anyone (serious) fully does not accept KPg impact anymore. But there is a fairly good case that concurrent volcanism also played
@TonyAngelo @CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE There is no evidence of an impact in the NW Canada region. Until there is evidence of such an impact there I will assume there is not one.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Well, there is also plenty of literature against YDIH which I would not call dishonest, and I would like to give you some advice if you wish to go on in the sciences. 		You need to chill out man.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I got angry by the several insinuations that I was ignorant of the field. Please don't do this when arguing with someone. Imagine going into a profs office hours and saying they are ignorant about XYZ what is part of the field they work in (here Late Quaternary).
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Sorry I got angry
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk That is why journals publish YDIH papers even though most disagree. That is also why you sometimes see it at AGU. We want to make sure what we think is right is right. I applaud those who research this, but they have not convinced me yet. Maybe they will some day.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Look, I want you to know something important. I disagree with you and so do many others. But if good enough evidence came along I would accept the hypothesis. So far, for me &amp; many others, we have not seen that evidence. But if I saw it I would happily accept that.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I am merely listing what the Alvarezs found for KPg. 		What I would want for YDIH would be debris layer found in arctic ocean seds. But there is not one.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Pray were? https://t.co/30B8qtlyhk
@CosmicTusk @Marc_Young_90 Yeah!?
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk The scientific community is waiting for good evidence. They get angry as YDIH have basically ignored most of the problems with the hypothesis
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Yeah, but the Alvarezs came back with very good evidence	1) impact ejecta found all over the planet almost everywhere with KPg seds	2) actual crater dated to KPg	3) tsunami deposits	4) evidence of widespread wildfire		When they presented good evidence, people accepted it.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Wally is not the "father" of paleoclimtology, but here s one of the sciences most important members. I honestly don't know why he said he thinks it is right, most don't agree.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Maybe you should go to AGU later this year and survey the paleoclimatologist TS there.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk We do, but when others go to another site and don't find the same signal we are septical
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk I want it all over the place on five Continents, not like here &amp; there. I want it all over the ocean sed record too.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Don't you dare tell me that YDIH is widely supported, I work in paleoclimatology. You know quite well that that is total nonsense. Highly published on ‚â† widely supported.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Lol. If there was a significant impact the evidence would be all over the place, especially in the arctic. But it is not. Instead there are spotty bits around.
@Marc_Young_90 @CosmicTusk Yes I am very familiar with it. And I am also familiar with the papers which were largely unable to reproduce YDIH 'evidence.'

@CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE Plus there is no evidence that the impacts are YD age. Totally factless speculation.
@CosmicTusk @NASA_ICE How about because Keigwin et al 2018 showed very convincingly that YD meltwater plumb came out into Beaufort SC via MacKenzie River area. Pray how could an impact in Greenland trigger a meltwater plumb in NW Canada?

@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Also, thank you for resisting the BS from the current sham antiscience EPA!
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Well, I think this proves your point that endothermic vs exothermic can be confusing!! üòÉ
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Just to be clear, the energy taken in goes into chemical bonding in the products, at least in a chem rxn. In melting is it really does go into more vibrational kinetic energy as well.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Well, an endothermic rxn won't happen useless you have something that the energy can come from - a hand, solution it is dissolved in, air, whatever.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel In the initial tweet you said the substance gets cooler, for which I interpreted to mean the system lost energy. But you really meant it makes the stuff around cooler.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel I think I understand the confusion here. In an endothermic rxn the system takes in energy, and it doing so makes the surroundings from which it took that energy cooler.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Temp is literally a measurement of internal vibrational kinetic energy
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel It would if you include the surroundings as part of the system. That is why in thermodynamics you have to define the system and the surroundings specifically.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel The actual substances in the rxn increase temp. The surroundings lose temp. https://t.co/douhZeXTtp

@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel That's because the rxn is absorbing energy from the surroundings (the water making up the liquids in the bag), the same way that putting ice in warm water cools the water - melting the ice takes in energy. The temp measured is of the surroundings, not the reacting substances.

@ImNotABot17 @RayPhillips207 @washingtonpost 115 kya was at the height of the last interglacial. We are not at the hight of the current interglacial. That was about 7000 years ago or so. We should not be seeing peak interglacial conditions when we are suppose to be *slowly* going back into another ice age.
@ImNotABot17 @RayPhillips207 @washingtonpost Totally false. That is literally what my job is.
@altUSEPA @MikeNelson247 @DenverChannel Umm... Endothermic rxns don't result in substances getting colder. They "feel" cold though. But that's because energy is being transferred from you to the substance. That's why holding ice feels cold, the ice is taking energy from you.

@DagomarDegroot Pretty stunning though that population decline due to European diseases could possibly show up in atmospheric CO2 records!
@DagomarDegroot King of LIA is volcanism &amp; related feedbacks. The CO2 drop or solar minima (Maunder, Spree, etc) help, but are definitely lower order. Forcings for minima and CO2 are just too small.
@DagomarDegroot Thanks! 		Also that drop in CO2 is no where near enough to explain LIA. Not even close. Besides LIA started before these dates anyway. But they *could* be right about cause of small ~10-20 ppm drop in CO2. It's a reasonable hypothesis, but we need more work on NA ecological ‚àÜ.

@fartelengelbert @RichardTol @RARohde About how much larger magnitude the current change is.
@fartelengelbert @RichardTol @RARohde Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. I think the point above originally was that if you assume the CO2 drop during the LIA (or that small part of it in the paper being talked, which, by the way, is a terrible assumption) caused all that cooling, we should be concerned...
@fartelengelbert @RichardTol @RARohde I mean, if someone is thinking about it that hard, they probably would be informed enough to know that the relationship is like that.
@fartelengelbert @RichardTol @RARohde Okay, I think I understand. Are you concerned that people might assume a doubling if CO2 would double temperature? I guess that is a reasonable concern, but I have never seen anyone misinterpret it that way.

That's an approximation. If that was truly accurate we would....

Here is one of these silly Anthropocene threads. Not sure if non-GSA members can view. 		https://t.co/9LMhrzYzq0
By the way, this tread has been going on for about a month. Has split into several topics, some almost totally unrelated.
The best ever was a months long argument between emeritus profs (mostly) about the Anthropocene a few years ago. 		The main takeaway I got was that some older geologists did not like the Anthropocene mostly as it was newfangled.
This is true. GSA is mostly tectonics, paleontology, sediments, and ***oil &amp; gas***. Not sure why. AGU does all of these well too, if not better, except oil and gas, + more geophysics, paleoclimate, modern climate, oceans, meteorology, planetary/extraterrestrial geoscience, etc
Today's topics include a thread originally about a Creationist book on the Grand Canyon which has morphed into an argument about why GSA is so bad with paleoclimate sciences.
Oh, getting to be around 12. 		That must mean it time for the "new GSA forum comments email" where I can read random emeritus profs argue about pointless things and see technical oil and gas questions answered with endless jargon. https://t.co/VKNfM38TXH

In any case the ecological effects from population decline in America's due to Europeans is a field that needs a lot more study.
Plus this would require steady or close to steady land use elsewhere. I don't know if there is good evidence for that.
Still, no way does the relatively small CO2 decline in LIA explain the cooling. No way. Nor does it explain why most of the effects seem 'larger' in the NH.

@not_p_harris @NGrossman81 This is excellent! I am pleased to inform you that you have officially won Twitter.		Not the same movie below, but still Sellers. https://t.co/z4p61q7vPX
@conservativejj1 One solution is fusion of He-3 and deuterium (H-2). But you would need to mine the Moon or capture gas from the gas giants to get the He-3. That could spur a second boom in space exploration.
@conservativejj1 Plus, confronting this problem will spur in all kinds if new invocations and idea. For example, some day we need to find another type of energy other than fossil fuels, because we will eventually run out anyway.
@conservativejj1 Certainly if humans are to reach some kind of Star Trek like world, we would need to figure out how to stop glaciations. One good thing about what is happening now is that when we get through this (and trust me, we will) we are **really** going to understand how the Earth works!
@conservativejj1 Also as a side note: That kind of warmer world might not be bad. The part to worry about is moving very rapidly from one to the other.
@conservativejj1 I also believe people have suggested that the turning point for the Otoman Empire might be related  to serious droughts in Turkey as well.
@conservativejj1 Side note: This is why Earth went into a glacial/interglacial world in the first place.
@conservativejj1 Anyway, I hope that helps/answers you questions. Would be glad to explain further or point to open access literature on the subject. 		Thanks for asking serious and insightful questions!!
@conservativejj1 Climate changes in the past, minor to today, helped extinguish great civilizations. The Maya and Ancestral Puebloians by drought, the Vikings in Greenland from the Little Ice Age, the explosion of bubonic plague after the 536 CE event, helping end the Roman empire. Etc
@conservativejj1 The droughts did not help. I am very concerned what the middle East will look like when average summer temps are +120F over large areas.
@conservativejj1 3) that is probably the biggest worry of all, at least from a human perspective. Instabilities in climate could exacerbate other problems. For example, preceeding the Syrian civil war were several years of very bad drought. While that conflict was primarily caused by other things
@conservativejj1 There was an outgassing of sequestered radiocarbon old CO2 from to oceans to atmo. It might have come from a major disruption of the highly stratified Pacific. Today, the 'oldest' waters, meaning longest since being at surface are in the deep Pacific. Their 14C ages are +1000 yrs
@conservativejj1 But there are dangers here to. If to much freshwater (see greenland) gets into the North Atlantic, this circulation slows down. The last few times this happened very weird and confusing things happened. For example during the Younger Dryas and Heinrich Stadial 1...
@conservativejj1 A majority of our CO2 emissions and resultant trapped heat has gone into the oceans, and robust vertical ocean circulation means it is easy for the oceans to absorb impacts (other times in Earth history vertical ocean mixing has been much much slower)
@conservativejj1 Some changes could also dampen the effect of warming. For example, warmer=more evaporation, so we might get more clouds to reflect sunlight. But warmer also makes it hard to condense water. The effects by clouds I one of the biggest sources of uncertainty in projections
@conservativejj1 Huge Western fires really are, to a large degree, just huge and very rapid changes in local ecology.
@conservativejj1 Now large area are essentially stressed ecosystems existing in a place they should not be. Add lots of human ignition sources, the poor 'stop every fire' policy of most of the 20th century, &amp; an increase in lightning only storms, and you get huge fires!
@conservativejj1 A good example of that is the increase in Western wildfires. The climate has changed so fast that today large parts of the west today are covered by forests which grew in a wetter climate in the west. Ecosystems can migrate if climate changes show enough, but here it was too fast
@conservativejj1 2) I am not sure if I entirely understand this question. Certainly the changes are in part just the result of a warmer climate (hurricanes carrying more water vapour for example). Others are because of the rate of change being so fast.
@conservativejj1 But obviously this takes along time. Past warmer climates we're able to exist as the 'world was flatter'. The last few 10s of millions of years have been anomalously tectonically active.
@conservativejj1 Long term is by a process called silicate weathering, aka chemical weathering of silicate rocks (feldspars, mica, amphibole, all the common minerals). Because there is so much exposed rock and new rock is constantly being replaced by the way, current CO2 level is not stable.
@conservativejj1 We will skip the next glaciation, and maybe the next after that. But the current levels of CO2 are not stable in the Earth's atmosphere with the way the Earth is 'set up' now. 		Why? Too much tectonic activity, or mtn building. The way CO2 is removed from the atmosphere...
@conservativejj1 There really are two parts if stabilization. The short term - some kind of warmer world, probably kinda like the Oligocene or mid/late Eocene.		Then there is long term, +100,000 years. Eventually Earth will go back into the glacial interglacial world.
@conservativejj1 Thanks for the questions. Let me answer each in part. 		1) Yes, the system will rebalance at some point, but when depends on what happens with future emissions. It will definitely not stabilize within any living person's lifetime unless we humans do something to stabilize it.

@BryanQuinn1981 @GerardoHGarcia @washingtonpost No, I they are good. You are noticing a trend. That is basically what we do in science.
@BryanQuinn1981 @GerardoHGarcia @washingtonpost What really is going on is climate change increases wavyness in the jet stream/polar front. That means mid latitudes are more likely to get socked by colder and deeper lows during winter as cold polar air is able to reach further south.

@rogerthatone @NPR Also don't think this line they have drawn protects against tyranny in a meaningful way with the level of advanced military tech today.
@rogerthatone @NPR Other folks have argued differently. I am not saying this interpretation is wrong, but rather that the subject is not settled.
@rogerthatone @NPR In the Las Vegas shooting, 58 people were killed. That seems massive. I doubt a 18th century light infantryman could kill 58 people with the weapons they had.
@rogerthatone @NPR Also 'mass destruction' is not well defined. I could argue that the numbers of people killed in shooting in which the weapon used was semi automatic crosses this boundary.
@rogerthatone @NPR Why does it include full auto weapons? This is just a legal argument, not a law.
@rogerthatone @NPR Maybe it is, someone should challenge if they think it is. 		For the second: Good, the law is working then.
@rogerthatone @NPR Certainly there are 'arms' you cannot buy legally in the United States.
@rogerthatone @NPR Yeah, sure, that's because it is generally considered legal and/or not fully litigated, and legal currently
@rogerthatone @NPR I think California and Iowa have full bans on private ownership of fully automatic weapons.
@rogerthatone @NPR Sorry typo. Caliber ammo
@rogerthatone @NPR Or higher calibration ammo
@rogerthatone @NPR And if so, why is the ban on fully automatic weapons legal?
@rogerthatone @NPR I think you know there is a large legal argument about what the text of the second amendment means. It does not just say 'right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,' that is only the second clause.
@badger7_7 @NPR @Everytown That is true, and I am glad it is. But the WHOLE system should be under one set of rules.
@rogerthatone @NPR Okay, but that is not a good argument for not increasing restrictions. Drunk driving is not the leading cause of car accidents, distracted driving (using phone, et cetera) is, but that's not a good argument to legalising or tolerating drunk driving.

@rogerthatone @NPR https://t.co/6S3IFQSDGd
@rogerthatone @NPR I can make a convincingly statistical argument that sunsetting the ban allowed for an increase in deaths in large shootings. https://t.co/ioq1vQAKCB
@rogerthatone @NPR Okay, so.
@rogerthatone @NPR Well I can't tell from the photos. If they are all acting in the same way, all should be banned in my opinion.
@rogerthatone @NPR Does not the bottom one fit a larger magazine?
@rogerthatone @NPR Okay
@badger7_7 @NPR @Everytown I understand it can't stop those who use the blackmarket, but that is not a reason why background checks should not be standardized across all states.
@rogerthatone @NPR Moving goalposts. Being able to tell from photos is irrelevant, which is what you originally asked me to do. Again, I support the ban on assault weapons as legally defined in the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.
@JAT1967 @RealJamesWoods I don't do that and I strongly condemn those who do. I am very sorry that people have accused you of that, that is unfair.
@rogerthatone @NPR I have no idea. I can't tell if a weapon is semi automatic from looking at an image of one. Maybe you can, but that is irrelevant.
@rogerthatone @NPR Okay
@RevengeKlown @NPR How
@RevengeKlown @NPR Nope. Same reason as before, it is much harder to do. Drunk driving is already illegal.
@badger7_7 @NPR @Everytown Yup, universal background checks can't stop them all. But it would make it harder.
@rogerthatone @NPR And don't be so conceited about your correct wording criticism about 'assault weapons.' You know perfectly well that the term was legally defined by the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which included semi automatic firearms as part of that group.
@RevengeKlown @NPR Look. Bad people are always gonna do bad things. But I don't see any reason to increase the effectiveness of their badness.
@badger7_7 @NPR Fine. But I think the rules need to be strengthened and more strongly enforced, and on a federal level.
@RevengeKlown @NPR Good luck killing scores of people with a bat.
@RealJamesWoods @JAT1967 This is a silly argument. All #libs are bad or dumb or wrong because I found one who is.
@realDonaldTrump Good. WH press conferences are a waste of time. Just media covering BS talking points as if was news.

@NPR This is funny. I posted this second part thinking more liberal people would get mad about me saying NYC law might be unconstitutional (reply was on post from NPR, reasonable to expect liberals). Instead, a whole bunch of conservative reacted. Life is weird.
@rogerthatone @NPR I don't think it is fair to say that if I am uninformed in the jargon I am uninformed in general. I would not say you were uninformed about aridity in the US Southwest if you could not explain what El Nino-Southern Oscillation and why it's state controls winter precip in US SW.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Okay. Bye
@rogerthatone @NPR I know it is not my full right, but I can have the opinion that more restrictions are a good idea, just as you have the right to disagree.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 I have nothing to with this if true.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman Thanks. Happy hunting.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Bad eye sight. Single shot rifle shots, bullets with lower momentum than an AR or something. Don't have chance to hunt or shot much.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman I also applogize to you for originally sounding too antagonistic. I am convinced you are an ethical hunter too. I was a bit worked up from others more aggressive comments.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 That is incorrect. I can see your responses. You have not been blocked.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman I know an AR can do one shot at a time. But I think if you make an errant shot and miss, I think having a single shot that I have to reload is more fair chase.
@rogerthatone @NPR I am not in the military nor ever have been. I own a single shot Winchester and pump action shotgun, and that's it.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR That you!
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman By regular, I mean single shot.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman You said you use an AR. Semi automatic AR is not a regular rifle.
@rogerthatone @NPR How am I supposed to prove that?
@crafty1chris @_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Okay
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman That is fine. I think hunters should use regular rifles and shotguns. When hunting I am going for experience to understand my ancestors and nature. I don't need it for food. So I try to make the action as like theirs as I reasonable can.
@rogerthatone @NPR That is okay if he disagrees.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman @BC_Club1887 @TheTRCP Hunting should be difficult. You should have to walk and track, ensure you take good aim. Show respect to wildlife. 		https://t.co/d4ILF81Hb1
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR That is fine. We disagree. There is nothing better or more patriotic than disagreements on how our country should be run.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman @BC_Club1887 @TheTRCP When I hunt, which is not very often, I use old fashioned rifle or shotgun only. Why because I have deep and profound respect for wildlife. I think it is ethical to hunt the hard way. It shows respect.
@crafty1chris @_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Rubbish, people help ID other criminals all the time for lighter sentences, et cetera.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR Good. That is what I want.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman Check out @BC_Club1887 or @TheTRCP for fair chase tips.
@crafty1chris @_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 I would prefer those people not dead. They could have helped identify the others the article mentions fled the scene.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR Okay, when then say what you mean to say initially, don't say it is a half measure and then say it is nothing measure.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR So
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman It us also lazy hunting, like people who hunt out of side by side. Fair Chase and shot is also part of ethical hunting conduct.
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman How are you going to ensure you make all clean kill shots if you fire into a group of deer?
@Colt45Wild @crafty1chris @_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 I did not say it never happened, I only said I was unaware of that happening and asked if it had. Now I know and that is good to know.
@crafty1chris @_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Bully for you, I don't follow the news on every single shouting incident ever. Why was his weapon choice more effective than a shotgun. Then at least some of those, admittedly, criminals would not be dead.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR If it is a half measure, it can't do nothing, otherwise it would be a nothing measure.
@Burt1Lafleur @NPR I know the first point. I still think the law should be changed with respect to semi automatic weapons as well.
@rogerthatone @NPR They don't serve any legitimate purpose in civilian life. They are not good for hunting nor are they good for self defense. Certainly some bad people would get hold of them in blackmarket, but having them legal only makes that access easier. Law enforcement should have access.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 Other than law enforcement maybe.
@_RainyDayWoman @JAT1967 When has anyone taken down 'bad guys' in this country with a Kalashnikov?
@JAT1967 @_RainyDayWoman Yes it would! But it would also be very unsportsmanlike.
@rogerthatone @NPR Sorry, but that term I meant, "assault weapons"
@rogerthatone @NPR I think semi automatic weapons should be banned. If you wanna argue about if that term is legally defined, fine, but that is just semantics. I think existing laws need to enforced, but that is not an argument for not having new ones.
@_RainyDayWoman And if you wanna know my answer.		I don't like seeing kids needlessly killed, I don't like see concert goes mowed down, and semi automatic Kalashnikovs are not useful weapons for hunting nor self defense outside of a warzone.
@_RainyDayWoman Based on the fact you liked this tweet (before I responded) I serious doubt you came to this 'debate' with anything remotely resembling honesty		https://t.co/eOk4Zix5Bw
@_RainyDayWoman I did. I made a comment about gun reform ideas I support + and ones I don't, as in the NCY law going to supreme court.
@badger7_7 @NPR Yes, I think some laws should be altered.
@_RainyDayWoman I am not the one who flipped out at someone suggesting an opinion is disagree with.
@rogerthatone @NPR Whatever. I said I think NYCs law is unconstitutional and supreme will rule against, but that support changes to other existing laws and/or continuing support for some types of restriction. You responded with NRA meme soup.

@treecarverbill @_RainyDayWoman @NPR Who?
@_RainyDayWoman @NPR Why what?
@badger7_7 @NPR None. All are good.
@badger7_7 @NPR Sorry, meant magazine. My mistake.
@NPR To be clear, before someone flips out, I am for assault weapons ban, cartridge size limits, and federally mandated very strong background checks. All are fully legally justifiable and help prevent deaths/crime. I fail to see how this law is either of those things.
@NPR I am fairly pro greater restrictions on gun ownership, but I totally fail to see what the justification for this law is. Sad because if Supreme Court takes it down, gun nuts will take it was a victory.
@AirborneChick @david_flood @ChandanChintz @NPR ?
@ChandanChintz @NPR The Repub party did not choose Trump, and then Bernie challenged Clinton. Remember how everyone &amp; their dog were coming up with reasons why Trump was not going to get the nomination. #retroactivethinking

'People aren't dumb. The world is hard' - Richard Thaler, founder of behavioral economics, Nobel Prize, 2017
@Liam92358628 @KitChatvlog @coffeeenated @KHayhoe @MichaelEMann @ClimateOfGavin So you don't have the same physics, they are just based in the same physics.
@Liam92358628 @KitChatvlog @coffeeenated @KHayhoe @MichaelEMann @ClimateOfGavin If anything, GCMs are vastly superior to any weather Sims.
@Liam92358628 @KitChatvlog @coffeeenated @KHayhoe @MichaelEMann @ClimateOfGavin Weather Sims must run in a short period of time, so there are major approximations made to physics. Climate some can run for months and months. Boundary conditions data is very coarse and can be erroneous. There is intrinsic chaos in atmospheric conditions.

@BenGDressen @nytimes You too. Thank you! Keep engaging with the subject. Learn everything you can from both sides. You have inspired me to learn a little more about what refuters specifically disagree with.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I feel confident in my acceptance of its reality based on my work and others, but the last thing I would ever want to do is blindly accept it. And, to be honest, I really truly wish it was not true. If it is, we are in for one hell of a ride.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Sorry typo in last sentence		I am deeply sorry if they think so
@BenGDressen @nytimes Thank you. I have enjoyed this. I have not convinced you, though I did not expect too. And I totally agree some science people in the past have been way off in their predictions, and scientists should be asking what they did wrong. People used to say Plate Tectonics was rubbish.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I don't think they should shut up. I enjoy debating them, it improves my ability to do so, and I always learn something new. Even if I think someone is incorrect, I don't want them shut up. I am deeply sorry if it herself think so.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I agree. I really don't like how some have shut down those against, not allowing them to speak. Face the Nation is probably not a great place for a (useful) science debate anyway, but I think those debates should happen.
@BenGDressen @nytimes ...And so improve my ability to make predictions. That is how science works.
@BenGDressen @nytimes That is correct, predictions are not facts. But making predictions and testing to see if they are correct is the best way to come to 'facts'. If I never predict any races I will be never correctly guess a winner. If I watch enough races, I might figure out who is fastest...
@BenGDressen @nytimes Science is not fact collection. It us asking a question, coming up with all possible answers, and then testing to see which is right.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I believe is this is a call for predictions.		https://t.co/D9z9qCWd0J
@BenGDressen @nytimes And please explain why adding a heat trapping gas would not... Trap heat.
@BenGDressen @nytimes You asked for a prediction which ended up being correct. What do you mean replicate, they merely asked what happens if you double CO2. So far we are following their prediction. Please explain were all the extra CO2 we have in the atmosphere now is coming from.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Sorry, first week is not very clear. They said if you double CO2 (increase by 2 times) you get 2 degrees warmer global average. We have increased CO2 by 1.4 and have warmed 1.5. The track they predicted is the track we are on.
@BenGDressen @nytimes The trend is following right on track. They made a prediction, using a computer model, and so far what has occurred is concurrent was what they said would happen.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Here is paper		Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity https://t.co/zvdGorh0Q3
@BenGDressen @nytimes Look, this is as simple as it gets. In 67 these guys used on on the earliest climate models to see what happens if you double atmosphere CO2. Two degrees warmer. Baseline is 280 ppm. Now a bit above 400. 1.4 times increase. We are now 1.5 times warmer than 280 world. See next...
@BenGDressen @nytimes You will note it was liked for about 2 seconds.
@BenGDressen @nytimes That was a mistake trying to open the tweet. Using phone.
@BenGDressen @nytimes We have tree-ring records for the last 2500 years here that are highly accurate and precise. Millions of years is irrelevant to this research, if you want to talk about paleoclimate in late Holocene, you study, ahem, the late Holocene, last few this and years.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Besides. You are being disingenuous. You said that no predictions about climate change were correct. I named a slowdown of NADW formation as one thing predicted, showed that it slowed down, et cetera.
@BenGDressen @nytimes If you think they are guesses I am sorry you are so deeply ignorant of how science works.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Monte Carlo simulations are a robust statical tool. If you don't understand how they work, then don't assume they are fakery.
@BenGDressen @nytimes The last few decades have been drier than the previous decades, as predicted, and getting worse. If you think scientific data analysis and climate modeling are guessing, then you are deeply ignorant of how either process actually works.

@BenGDressen @nytimes Al Gore is not a scientist
@BenGDressen @nytimes A 50% increase one year is not statistically interesting when looking over long term patterns. Again, these snows come in larger more violent storms.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Snowfall has decreased in UK. When it does come, it comes more often in larger, more violent storms.
@BenGDressen @nytimes 1) Sagan was an astrophysicist	2) the claim is largely true. We are witnessing of highest rate of species extinction that has occurred in millions of years.
@BenGDressen @nytimes We was incorrect. By the US West is a lot drier and these have been problems with topsoil degradation. The opposite of his claim has not happened.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Nice try. I want predictions based and disproven by data and statistical analysis, not conversations and anecdote.
@BenGDressen @nytimes This is incorrect, many predictions have come true. Increased snowfall in Antarctica, more polar vortices spun off of the polar cyclones, show down in NADW formation, retreat of glaciers, increased aridity in US West, stronger ACC. Want more?
@BenGDressen @nytimes They enable a *hypothesis* to be tested. A *theory* has already been tested &amp; confirmed many many times, such as evolution. That is why climate science is legitimate science, as you correctly state, it makes predictions and we see if they are true.

@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes I have no idea. I assume so. Some people suggested that maybe that would they could get around that depending on what type of rape classification they charged, but the whole thing was very murky/legally questionable/expensive. Lawyers fighting for years over innane details
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes And the crime happened when Brett was a Georgetown Prep, which is in.... Maryland
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Where Brett went to school is irrelevant. The crime accused happened in Maryland.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Well, that is where the crime was supposed to have happened.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Again...		By the way, if the state of Maryland was to arrest him for rape, that would maybe not have a statute time limit, but Ford herself can't bring him to court herself.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Nope, it does not. It just says they are not pursuing in count and she does not want to see him impeached. Reason why. It is beyond the statute of limitations.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes But only maybe, kind of legally foggy there
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes I never told you I did not read article.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes By the way, if the state of Maryland was to arrest him for rape, that would maybe not have a statute time limit, but Ford herself can't bring him to court herself.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes She is not bringing him to court BECAUSE SHE CAN'T LEGALLY DO SO!
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Sorry, him to court
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Did after I tweet as I already knew I was correct. The accusations are beyond the statute of limitations. She cannot legally bring home to court for sexual assault.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes That's because it is beyond the statute of limitions
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes You just told me I am suppose to wait until courts decide. Show me the court how decided he was innocent. Dr Ford has not withdrawn her accusations.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes Which did not go to court.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes That is why it is going to court.
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes I don't think you understand what presumption of innocent means. Legally it means the the burden of proof is on the prosecution. It doesn't mean someone cannot accuse someone if something until legally proven, nor does it mean the public must assume innocence until legally proven
@randyn_420 @Pugable @nytimes That is not what you said. If someone is accused in court of 'xyz', you would not say they 'didn't' do it, you would say, there were accused.

@joinertek @washingtonpost This man I had argument with (I got blocked. Sad) seems to totally fail to understand how deeply insulting the mock powwow dancing to the drum is. Absolutely disgusting racist behavior by the students.
@joinertek @washingtonpost Again, the boy stays in his face and mockingly smiles, shouting, chanting political slogans, powwow jumping up and down. Even if he put himself in the crowd the 'exemplary' thing to do would be to un-surround him.
@joinertek @washingtonpost Irrespective of whether you are correct or not (I don't think you are), if the native gentleman acted incorrectly, that does not justify the students doing so. Just because someone breaks the social contact does not mean others get too as well.
@joinertek @Freedom_Heiter @washingtonpost Purposely staying close to his face and smiling in a mocking way while everyone else around chants, mocks, and powwows around. Yes, that is unethical.
@joinertek @washingtonpost The students were at a political event generally for folks who are 'conservative' and wearing Trump related regalia. The Trump admin./coservatives has been highly antagonistic to Native American issues and people. The native gentleman was fully within his rights to confront
@Freedom_Heiter @joinertek @washingtonpost I strongly condemn anyone who has sent either party death threats.
@Freedom_Heiter @joinertek @washingtonpost I bear no responsibility for any sunhuman swine who may send these kids death threats. But that does not mean they behaved in an ethical manner, nor does it mean that the native gentlemen's actions were illegitimate.
@joinertek @washingtonpost They were at the March for Life - a public protest no doubt. In what way is the native gentleman not a counter protestor?
@Freedom_Heiter @joinertek @washingtonpost One of the kids parents has whined, and so are you.
@joinertek @washingtonpost Again, explain why you are upset that people at a public protest event should be confronted by counter protestors.
@Freedom_Heiter @joinertek @washingtonpost If I was at a public political protest, I would go there expecting the possibility of being confronted by counter protesters and would not whine about them irritating me.
@joinertek @washingtonpost Exemplary action would be to ignore him, not surround him, or even better engage in a useful dialogue with him. Just because they did not do the worse thing does not mean they acted 'exemplary'.
@joinertek @washingtonpost ***Attack him
@joinertek @washingtonpost Antagonistic does not equal non peaceful, show me were he does any physical harm to anyone. The point of protest is to be provocative. That they did not attach him is a very low bar.
@joinertek @washingtonpost Please explain why people who choose to go to a public political protest event should be immune to not being peacefully confronted by counter protestors.
@joinertek @washingtonpost How about the powwow like jumping up and down to drum beat.

@BenGDressen @nytimes Records of the types of bugs preserved in lake sediments, records of the past extent of mountain glaciers, lake level records, records of the past ranges of animals or plants, records of movement of the today petrified Nebraska Sand Hills
@BenGDressen @nytimes Cite someone who has lost their job.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Records from the chemistry of cave stalactites or stalagmites, ice cores (which previous brought up as accurate),
@BenGDressen @nytimes Yes we do have good records. We have tree-ring records, yearly lake sediments, historical and archeological records, pack rat middens, pollen records, ocean sediment chemistry records, records from  the chemistry of yearly mollusk or clam growth rings
@BenGDressen @nytimes Is this not an open debate?		It is correct climate has behaved like this before. All the times it did so were really bad. All the evidence suggests we are doing this.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I don't think that. But they certainly have a vested interest in denying climate change.   So you ought to also have some skepticism if the ideas they support as well. I love skepticism. My job as a scientist is basically to be a skeptic. I am glad you are too.
@BenGDressen @nytimes No. Problem today is oil and gas, but warm anomoies in the recent past (medieval, Roman) were natural fluxuations in climate likely made more severe by human impacts on climate due to agriculture. Those impacts are far less than what we are doing today.
@BenGDressen @nytimes If you want to get records for specific locations, you may or may not be able to find them. But to get global, you just need values covering the major climatic regions.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Yeah. They did not find bio or chem weapons, but they found the facilities to make them. I will also remind you it was PETROLEUM companies that helped egg on that war.
@BenGDressen @nytimes https://t.co/OHGdRAuWmj		MCA is totally natural variation, as you correctly said exists.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Nope. Depends on what you are talking about. For long term changes in climate (thousands of years) 50-60 year intervals are perfectly fine. And what you are referring to is temporal precision, not accuracy.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Nope. But we have discovered significant human caused impacts on the global environment from agriculture.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Actually rice fields (methane) and deforestation for agriculture mostly. Much smaller affect than what we are doing today.
@BenGDressen @nytimes No I did not watch it. Ice core data is most precise after last 2-3 millennia, but not necessarily most accurate.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Correct, is it not, but you incorrectly stated that the actual temperature record only went back 50 years.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Citation please. Show me that Paris climate agreement channels money to Gore or Bushes.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Literally the US Defence Department (the military) is worried about climate change.  Here is an example. https://t.co/iJDeslNUwO
@BenGDressen @nytimes MCA was natural climate variability, a shown by climate models, possibly egged on by what is called the early anthropocene hypothesis.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Oh, and by the way, during the MCA the American Southwest experienced megadroughts lasting 50-60 years with aridity values several times worse than anything we have ever experienced since Europeans came here.
@BenGDressen @nytimes I literally study the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) as my primary research subject. Warming is much less than modern and really only in Northern hemisphere. Last updip in below figure is MCA. https://t.co/padYhf1Xsl
@BenGDressen @nytimes Yes, younger dryas was a very rapid change. 6 years or so. But the magnitude of global temp change was less than what we are doing. Plus it had profound negative impacts globally. Along with humans, helped lead to the extinction of mammoths, Irish elk, cave bears, etc
@BenGDressen @nytimes We say the end of the dinosaurs extinction is the 'fastest' because it was an asteroid impact!!! - everything changed within the scale of days/weeks.
@BenGDressen @nytimes And over much of the world, we can get annual, to seasonal records with tree-ring data going back 2-3 thousand years.
@BenGDressen @nytimes We can make claims about further in the past using paleoclimatology. The results are less precise, but multiple independent methods show the same answers, so conclusions are robust.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Good temp records go back about 120 years, though yes, more recent more precise. But there is no reason older records such be inaccurate and biased toward 'too cold'.
@ElectCDavis @SenatorCantwell https://t.co/WxLSM3gLPH
@TinehAgent @latimes Neither. 		If people choose to go to a public political protest (March for Life here) they should expect to be possibly peacefully confronted by counter protesters. Anyone butthurt about that is being a wimp and/or disenguous.
@TinehAgent @latimes Again, I fail to see how drumming and chanting is threatening or justifies immature behavior. Little kids is generous as well.
@TinehAgent @latimes Nothing, or leave, because I am not some immature little twerp like this kids. If it was a native man, I certainly would not start jumping up and down powwow style and shouting about walls &amp; things.

@BenGDressen @nytimes KPg impact is the asteroid which killed dinosaurs, btw
@2001MUgrad @WeatherKait And for the first question, no I don't think so, maybe clumped isotopics are this good? I work with foraminiferal Mg/Ca, we can get like less than +-1 C or so, getting better as time goes on.
@2001MUgrad @WeatherKait 1) dinosaurs are not a 'species'	2) they did not invent science and astrophysics, so they did not know they were gonna get killed by an asteroid. We did invent science, on the other hand.
@YaleClimateComm @nytimes Sadly, more death and destruction I suspect.
@BenGDressen @nytimes This is a big deal has many people will have their lives negativity impacted or be die prematurely as we (humans) were to immature to not mess up the planet we live on even though we knew we were doing it.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Melted permifrost ruins building foundations. Acidification of oceans kills calcifying organisms on bottom of marine food chain, messing up whole ocean ecosystem. Drier places tend to become drier, wetter places wetter.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Hotter = more energy = more intense and frequent storms. Changing climate rapidly means large areas no longer have ecosystems suitable to new climate, see forests in US West now primed to burn in huge fires. Infectious tropical diseases move northward.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Humans burning those carbon sources into order to use the energy they contain to do things, drive cars, fly planes, heat homes, etc. Global temps have increased about 1 C, but that is global average. Arctic is like 7 C. That is a huge difference.
@BenGDressen @nytimes You brought up the Dinosaur extinction. Your science was wrong. As a scientist &amp; paleoclimatologist, I corrected your mistakes so you could be a better informed citizen.
@BenGDressen @nytimes See here		https://t.co/j4IAffMRHa
@BenGDressen @nytimes KPg impact (asteroid) was +1 billion Hiroshima bombs, no 900 bombs.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Solution is to remove those gases by having an alternate energy source to do so.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Cause is very rapid addition of carbon from 'geologic time scale reservoir' - in coal, Natural gas, etc - into short term cycle - air, oceans, soil, biosphere, etc. That carbon is going into atmosphere as heat trapping gases (co2, ch4) and oceans as dissolved inorganic carbon.
@BenGDressen @nytimes The point is the extinction causing mechanisms are concequences of the impact rather than just the blunt force of the impact. Had the asteroid hit the middle of the Pacific, the world would still probably be ruled by dinosaurs.
@BenGDressen @nytimes No, when asteroids hit things they throw debris all over the place. That stuff falls back down, heats up in the atmosphere (it is going very fast) &amp; Cretaceous impact released massive amounts of sulphur. See here https://t.co/JlrQJnU6ZP
@ybbac @Lonnie_Jansen @simondonner Maybe, but you never know with people... :)
@BenGDressen @nytimes And you statistics are wrong. Currently GHGs have trapped equivalent of about 2.7 billion Hiroshima bombs. And the KPg impact: more than 1 billion.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Besides, that extinction will likely be larger than the one we are causing, so no, I don't say that it is equal. It is just the only one were the rate of change is faster than today.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Most of the mass extinction has nothing to do with the impact itself, but rather the effects. Heating atmopsgere from falling debris, wildfires, release of sulphur into atmosphere from the high sulpher content rocks it hit, maybe hypercanes destroying the ozone layer.
@BenGDressen @nytimes The reason it was changed was that baboons like @JimInhofe would bring in snowballs to the Senate floor everytime it snowed, signifying, who knows.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Also, my point was, when was there a supposed temp drop and we decided to start saying climate change rather than global. I don't see it on the record.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Not globally. There is no 'global summer' or winter. I'd est, when summer in US, Europe, Asia, it is winter in Australia, south Africa.
@Arborsierra77 @Cumngetmee @bonanzabrandon @nytimes And besides, it is not like termites just suddenly appeared in last 100 years or doubled in numbers. They are background. They have been since the TRIASSIC.
@Arborsierra77 @Cumngetmee @bonanzabrandon @nytimes Also the termites being a major player in methane part of carbon cycle is rubbish. Best estimate is less than 3%.		https://t.co/mcHKi5r5Os
@Arborsierra77 @Cumngetmee @bonanzabrandon @nytimes Radiocarbon dead means those GHGs are  derived from sources old enough that any 14carbon the may have had has now recayed away to 14nitrogen.
@Arborsierra77 @Cumngetmee @bonanzabrandon @nytimes This is nonsense. Termites can only produce methane from existing organic material (dead plants, etc) which is already part of the short term (non geologic) carbon cycle. The greenhouse gas emissions now on atmosphere are 'radiocarbon dead', so they cannot be from any decomposers

@jestreit @AngeleStar11 @nytimes Here is a good figure showing this sort of thing for California https://t.co/4YwR31E8pD
@jestreit @AngeleStar11 @nytimes See what happened with the fire in Paradise CA just recently. Basically huge areas no longer are climatologically supportive of existing coniferous pine forests and are rapidly changing to something else (shrub land? Maybe? ask an ecologist). Scary. This won't be fun.
@jestreit @AngeleStar11 @nytimes But while the magnitude of greenhouse gas release was similar to what we are on track to do, we are doing it 100 to 1000 times faster. Terrestrial ecosystems simply will not have time to 'get out if the way' or 'move geographically'
@jestreit @AngeleStar11 @nytimes But we are causing a mass extinction now. The most similar event to today is the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Widespread extinction (particularly in oceans due to acidification), ecosystems disrupted, moved around due to changing climate. Not fun.
@jestreit @AngeleStar11 @nytimes This isn't exactly correct (but the idea is correct). I think you are referring to the End Permian Extinction. ~ 96% of marine species died in that one, 70 of terrestrial (more uncertainty there). But the End Permian was much slower than what we are doing now üò±It was the biggest
@JerryBeets @nytimes If they had not done this a date 200 years before present in a paper from 1975 would now be 244 years ago. You see why that would be confusing. If you see years before present in any paleoclimate paper/figure, it means before 1950. That is the rule.
@JerryBeets @nytimes And in case you were wondering why the first figure goes only to 1950. Geology/paleoclimatologist types decided to set 1950 as 'precent' several decades ago. Why? Because as time went on, years before present in figures would no longer mean the same thing in later years.
@JerryBeets @nytimes Here is a better one going past 1950 (as difference from average). Note the slow cooling trand as we slowly march back into an ice age, but then it jumps suddenly up 1 degree - see 2004 arrow. Something weird happened to Earth's climate recently.... https://t.co/u4NfQJBQ5G
@JerryBeets @nytimes It's adapated from this paper https://t.co/1xkNPCqt3H
@JerryBeets @nytimes Year zero on this figure in 1950.
@TheodoreBNolan @nytimes So maybe it will be a bit warmer, but you get far worse winter storms.
@TheodoreBNolan @nytimes Nope. Climate change increases strength of winter arctic cyclones (warmer=more energy) which them throw off more powerful and frequent storms, like the famous bomb cyclone Boston last year were atmosphere pressure dropped so fast it made +1/2 feel sick.
@BenGDressen @nytimes No I don't remember this... https://t.co/OPCttyN2p2
@BenGDressen @LivingGreenLif5 @nytimes Sure Earth has seen changes of similar magnitude as what we are doing. But this is happening 2-3 orders of magnitude (100 to 1000) faster. All other similar events STILL lead to major extinctions. Only one faster was the asteroid impact 66 million years ago - see RIP dinosaurs.
@BenGDressen @nytimes That is 7,111% more precipitation in Khartoum than at the South Pole. Ice mass increases in the interior or Antarctica should set off alarm bells.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Average annual precip at south pole is 0.09 inches. In Khartoum, Sudan (Sahara) it is 6.4 inches.
@BenGDressen @nytimes Also, and this is mentioned in article suggesting you did not read it, snowfall (more ice) in Antarctica only increases when air is warmer. Why? The air is so cold generally it hold little water vapour and that amount can't get inland before falling out. Antarctica is a desert.
@BenGDressen @LivingGreenLif2 @nytimes Yeah, some parts of Antarctica were/are supposed to gain ice from ramping up the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (most powerful current on Earth) from warming Earth (more energy). Doing so cuts off Antarctica from heat transport from equatorial regions more. This was predicted.
