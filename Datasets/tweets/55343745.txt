@Ocasio2018 I don‚Äôt agree with all of AOC‚Äôs stated policy beliefs, but I üíØ appreciate and agree with a younger, vocal and diverse Congress. And that the majority of us shouldn‚Äôt be beholden to the few just because they‚Äôre from more sparsely populated states

@terib3294 @joss I don‚Äôt know anyone except Wall Street friends happy with the tax cuts and climate change isn‚Äôt a politics issue. if u think science isn‚Äôt settled those scientist aren‚Äôt real. paid by lobbyists. But you‚Äôre right. Time will tell. Glad I‚Äôll be on the right side of history.
@terib3294 @joss We live in a global society. With the free market you say you‚Äôre for and all of the other innovations in the world in the past 50 years that Trump is trying to hinder, we have to care what Europe and the rest of the world thinks to stay relevant.
@terib3294 @joss I will never apologize for supporting healthcare as a right. Repealing ACA would have significantly reduced my taxes. I‚Äôm a donor from a blue donor state. But I support national healthcare. Premiums were under market. I‚Äôm sorry your premiums increased &amp; ACA has problems. Worth it
@terib3294 @joss Ok the market isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwavering‚Äù.  It‚Äôs scared shitless for a trade war. It‚Äôs gains were holdovers and tax cuts may have initially helped the market but it‚Äôs NOT going to help the economy.

@terib3294 @joss And Paris accord? Again big picture. Long game. May save some money but withdrawing made us look foolish. The environment and climate change is a global problem. We should be the leaders and staunchest advocates for climate change. Instead we look like science-denying morons
@terib3294 @joss ACA quadrupled bc trump caused instability in the market.
@terib3294 @joss The ‚Äúnon-existent‚Äù trade war with China. The Chinese‚Äôs sole purpose in the tariffs they imposed are aimed at middle American farmers. East coast farmers who advocated for the repeal of the WOTUS rule are backtracking saying it‚Äôs harming their ecosystems. No one looks big picture.
@terib3294 @joss The economy is tanking, and if you think ‚Äútrickle down‚Äù economics are going to work this time when it didn‚Äôt work under Reagan or either Bush, this isn‚Äôt a conversation worth having. And no I don‚Äôt appreciate the growth of the deficit ever, but  ‚Äúbut Obama‚Äù is never an excuse.
