But the law is in the books and its purpose is clear. There is no nullification. There is no secession.  Federal law is “the supreme law of the land.” I would invite any doubters to Gettysburg, and to the graves of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln.
Stop protecting lawbreakers and giving all officers more dangerous work to do so that a few politicians can score political points on the backs of officer safety. I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration.
Stop treating immigration agents differently from everybody else for the purpose of eviscerating border controls and advancing an open borders philosophy shared by only the most radical extremists.
Contrary to what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals, we are not asking California, Oakland, or anyone else to enforce immigration laws. We are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions to stop actively obstructing federal law enforcement.
In recent years, California has enacted a number of laws designed to intentionally obstruct the work of our sworn immigration enforcement officers—to intentionally use every power it has to undermine duly—established immigration law in America.

AG Sessions: That’s why today I am here to announce two new violent crime task forces that will focus on the areas most in need here in the Charlotte area &amp; Western Pennsylvania.
AG: I will not accept rising crime. Plain &amp; simple, we will not allow the progress made by our women &amp; men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.
AG Sessions: The violent crime rate is up by nearly seven percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.
