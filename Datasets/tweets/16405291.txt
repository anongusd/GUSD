@WalshFreedom Your tax-hiking new governor is NUTS!  Prayers to you and the other taxpayers in Illinois. https://t.co/Nhu7VhP9YF
Yeah, that oughta work (&lt;‚Äî more sarcasm).		PS...I forgot to mention that the governor wants to borrow $2 billion.  Yep.  More debt to tackle the debt problem.		PSS...If I missed any other tax hikes, lemme know.
In summary - the new governor wants to reduce the budget deficit created by politicians over several years who are addicting to wasteful, big government spending not by cutting spending, but by raising multiple tax hikes and ignoring the pension crisis.
The state‚Äôs unfunded pension is a serious problem that should get shored up.  But the governor wants to delay pension funding in order to reduce (but not completely close up) the budget shortfall.  In other words, he wants to kick the can.
TAX HIKE #12:  Looks like the governor also wants to enact an ‚Äúassessment program‚Äù (i.e. tax) on health insurance companies through Medicaid.  Someone call the Guinness Book of World Records.  This has to be record number of tax hikes, amirite?
TAX HIKE #11: The governor wants to phase out a tax credit for a private school scholarship program.
TAX HIKE #10:  The governor wants to raise millions in more revenue from an amnesty-type program for delinquent tax filers.  This sounds like harsher enforcement, eh?
TAX HIKE #9:  The governor wants to cut spending...haha...just kidding.  The governor wants to raise state income taxes on foreign income.
TAX HIKE #8:  OMG, please...when will this stop?  The governor wants to reduce the deduction that retailers get for collecting the state sales tax.  So basically the governor wants to give businesses a pay cut for being involuntary tax collectors.
TAX HIKE #7:  This is exhausting, but we must keep going. The governor wants a ‚Äúhigher tax structure‚Äù on ‚Äúsuccessful video game terminals‚Äù that will raise $89 million in more tax revenue.
TAX HIKE #6:  He wants to tax sport betting, which is now legal.  Thankfully, only rich people bet on sports (&lt;‚Äîsarcasm).
TAX HIKE #5:  You thought his new tax ideas were done, right?  Wrong!  He wants to a new tax on plastic bags.  Whew.  That‚Äôs a lot of tax hikes.  Now, let‚Äôs talk about the governor‚Äôs spending cuts.  What?  There are more tax hikes?  Yes!
TAX HIKE #4: He also wants to legalize marijuana and tax the smoke out of that.
TAX HIKE #3: ...and a tax hike on regular old smelly cigarettes.  But that‚Äôs not all.
TAX HIKE #2: He promises not to raise taxes on working class people, buuuut, he‚Äôs proposing a new tax on e-cigarettes...
TAX HIKE #1: He wants to get rid of the state‚Äôs flat income tax (constitutionally mandated) and replace it with a progressive tax structure.  In other words, a tax hike on upper income people.
So Illinois‚Äôs new governor wants to fix the state‚Äôs budget shortfall.  Take a thread journey with me on all of his ideas to do that... https://t.co/JKIgaAczy0
