I think Johnny Mac is really a Walmart greeter! I love it. #favoritedentist #BigBrother17
Johnny Mac "was your name the same Audrey?" #jMac stoned and hysterical. # how easy is dental school?? #BigBrother17
I bet more comes out about Audrey. CNS IS just exploiting the Caitlyn Jenner fame  #BigBrother17
@alvaro817 he would be sucking down the nitros!
She is not going to eviction. The real question is what will the stoned dentist yell at the camera tonight! #BigBrother17
By Audrey! The no reason lies are bad for your game.  #BigBrother17
#edshow all smoke and mirrors to make Americans think these politicians actually care. Why make a deal that will never pass #johnkerry
@edshow make the wall as high as possible #DonaldTrump
@edshow no reason to import anything from anywhere. Bring back the steel mills,the toy makers,the copper mines. That is the real issue.
@edshow cancel all welfare cancel all food stamps. People want to work and want to feel self worth. Bring back the jobs ! #selfworth
@edshow New York raised minimum wage because the politicians got rid of all the blue collar manufacturing jobs and sent them over seas.
#BigBrother17 good night #bye Audrey
