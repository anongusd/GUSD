I will stand up to whoever's in the Oval Office to do right by NH. Gov. Hassan simply can't say the same. #nhsen #nhpolitics
Gov. Hassan's dodging on this critical issue. Sec. Clinton didn't make a "mistake," but a conscious choice to imperil natl security #nhsen
If Gov. Hassan won't break w/ Sec. Clinton on national security, when will she? We need leaders who'll stand up for natl security #nhsen
If Gov. Hassan was serious about cybersecurity, she would meaningfully call out Sec. Clinton's mishandling of classified info #nhsen

Health care costs are going up, and @Maggie_Hassan is not going to do anything to change the cost trajectory or increase choice. #NHsen https://t.co/CjNLOsCmt5
We saw @Maggie_Hassan's talking points on @FOXNews last night &amp; we are expecting to see them again at the debate tonight. #NHsen #NHpolitics https://t.co/tqCGo7RmOB
Could you imagine Hillary Clinton with a rubber stamp like my opponent on all of these issues.  #NHpolitics #NHsen
I'm running against @Maggie_Hassan who has never seen a tax increase she doesn't like.  #NHpolitics #NHsen

We need more choice and competition, not more of these one-size-fits-all health care policies from Washington. #NHpolitics #NHsen
Under this law, too many New Hampshire families are struggling with higher deductibles, higher co-pays, higher premiums &amp; less choice #NHsen
It's unfortunate @Maggie_Hassan supports these unaffordable policies that are raising the cost of health care. #NHsen #NHpolitics
Premiums are going up across the country &amp; Granite State families are hurting because of it. #NHpolitics #NHsen https://t.co/FCdbexsM3a

I'm working to build an even better climate for good-paying, 21st century jobs. #nhsen #nhpolitics
Major difference in our approach to leadership. I believe in NH common sense solutions. Gov. Hassan backs top-down, one-size-fits-all #nhsen
I will always hold DC bureaucrats' feet to the fire to do right by our NH small businesses #nhsen #nhpolitics
The fact is Gov. Hassan voted to kill a bill that would have prohibited sanctuary cities in NH. #nhsen #nhpolitics https://t.co/AqS4CZBA57
That's why I voted to double border fencing &amp; patrol, strengthen e-verify, and reform legal immigration to meet our needs #nhsen #nhpolitics
Heartened to hear that Gov. Hassan agrees with me on need 4 comprehensive immigration reform. But border security must come first. #nhsen

We need to bring NH common sense to the Senate, not the reverse. So, I'm pushing back on regs that don't make sense 4 NH #nhsen #nhpolitics
This isn't me talking. This is Gov. Hassan's local paper. It's time for her to stop taking credit for work she didn't do. #nhsen #nhpolitics https://t.co/aBoisKZvL7
Let's be clear: I want to lower taxes &amp; cut red tape. Gov. Hassan's time in office has been defined by the opposite. #nhsen #nhpolitics https://t.co/Gqg6WMSPvz
Gov. Hassan consistently takes credit for tax cuts she vetoed &amp; bipartisanship she didn't show. That's not leadership. #nhsen #nhpolitics https://t.co/AV1tNgmu4o
I want to simplify the tax code &amp; lower rates to bring trillions back from overseas to invest in our economy #nhsen #nhpolitics

Let's replace Obamacare to expand competition, choice, &amp; transparency #nhsen #nhpolitics
We don't need more top-down, one-size fits all from DC. We need more choice &amp; solutions that make sense for NH. #nhsen #nhpolitics https://t.co/TL96MJ48Pp

Call on our leadership to allow vote on this bipartisan proposal so we can get a result for the American people
This attack confirms for us that we have to take the fight to ISIS and defeat radical Islamist terrorists
We have to stop the politics on this issue ‚Äì Our proposal is common sense and ensures terrorists can‚Äôt buy guns &amp; keeps Americans safe
Thank @SenatorCollins and all my colleagues here today for coming together with us on this impt proposal

My statement on my votes to advance debate on preventing terrorists from purchasing firearms: https://t.co/Q1HsVqkHHy
I look forward to working with my colleagues on our legislation that prevents terrorists from purchasing firearms &amp; protects Americans
Senator Collins and I have drafted legislation that we believe can gain support of both parties and pass the Senate. It‚Äôs a real solution
But I have concerns that ‚Äì while well-meaning ‚Äì the time frame for those investigations is simply too short.
Supported Senator Cornyn‚Äôs legislation in December because it afforded due process protections...
But measure doesn‚Äôt require govt to show anything other than ‚Äúreasonable belief‚Äù that you have been engaged in conduct relating to terrorism
Senator Feinstein‚Äôs approach is very broad &amp; could include innocent Americans while leaving them without sufficient due process protections
But these measure, while worthy starts to this discussion, each fall short in some ways.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll be voting to advance both options before us today in order to provide an opportunity to come to a bipartisan compromise.
During the past week, I‚Äôve been working with Senator Collins &amp; reaching out to our Democratic colleagues to find a path forward
This is a gravely serious issue that requires a serious response. There is a solution here &amp; I'm committed to finding it.
I‚Äôve been talking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in good faith to figure out the best way to achieve that goal
I believe we need to address what gaps exist in our intelligence system &amp; recommit ourselves to defeating ISIS.
If you‚Äôre too dangerous to board a commercial airplane, it stands to reason that you shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy a gun. It‚Äôs as simple as that
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again ‚Äì Terrorists should not be allowed to buy guns.
But this attack also highlighted the urgent need to make sure that terrorists cannot purchase a firearm.
We have to defeat radical Islamist terrorists, and we have to destroy ISIS so they can no longer spread hatred, violence and death
This was the worst terrorist attack on US soil since September 11th and it shook us to our core.
49 innocent lives were lost, and 53 more were injured, and I cannot imagine the pain their families and loved ones must be experiencing.
Hearts broke across our country as we woke on Sunday to news of a horrific terrorist attack on a nightclub in Orlando.

I'm joining @hughhewitt's radio show this morning at 8:05 am ET. Hope you can tune in!
Thank @SenJohnMcCain and @SenatorShaheen for their leadership ‚Äì Glad to work w/ them in fight to end this program
Urging my colleagues to support SJ Res 28 and stop this wasteful program once and for all
If we can‚Äôt get rid of such blatant government waste &amp; duplication, how are we going to tackle $19 trillion in debt?
For the past 5 years, I have called for the repeal of this wasteful program at my town hall meetings across New Hampshire
The fact that we have 2 government agencies doing the exact same job &amp; finding the exact same things is absurd.
Spending significantly more to do the exact same thing is logic that only works in Washington.
.@USGAO estimates it will cost $20 million to start &amp; $14 million/yr to operate ‚Äì compared to $700,000/yr cost of original inspection regime
For the past 15 yrs, FDA has already been inspecting catfish, using similar testing &amp; interception methods as USDA
But don‚Äôt take my word for it ‚Äì @USGAO has ruled this program duplicative &amp; a waste of taxpayer dollars 10 times!
Disguised as a food-safety program, this inspection regime is really a multilmillion dollar solution to a nonexistent problem
USDA‚Äôs catfish inspection program is just another example of why the American people have so little faith in Washington
On the floor discussing one of Washington‚Äôs most wasteful programs ‚Äì USDA‚Äôs duplicative catfish inspection program

VA Sec said wait times aren't a valid measure of performance, but I'm sure the families who lost loved ones waiting for care would disagree.
Appalled &amp; outraged that VA Sec would make the callous comparison btwn brave vets waiting for care &amp; Disneyland tourists waiting in line

We would not be a free &amp; safe society without the sacrifices that our law enforcement officers make every single day.
We stand with you, we are proud of you. We have your back because we know that you have our backs every single day.
During Police Week, I want to say to our law enforcement officers in NH &amp; across this country who keep us safe: Thank you.
Officer Stephen Arkell was also taken from us far too soon. He was truly an unsung hero who helped so many other people.
Chief Michael Maloney embodied the values of service, integrity, and honor, and his leadership in the Greenland PD will never be forgotten.
There have been far too many law enforcement officers in New Hampshire who have been killed in the line of duty.
Each year, we read the names that are etched into a memorial of those NH law enforcement officers that have been killed in line of duty.
2 of the hardest times I had as AG were giving eulogies for officers killed in line of duty: Officer Michael Briggs &amp; Corporal Bruce McKay.
This National Police Week, I want to say to the families of our police officers: Thank you. Families serve too.
Every time we're home on holidays, our police officers are out patrolling our streets &amp; our highways and keeping us safe.
We are so grateful for the service of Officer Ryan Hardy and Officer Matthew O'Connor.
Tragically, last week, we had an example of the dangers that our police officers face every single day.
Speaking on the floor now in recognition of National Police Week to honor &amp; thank the men and women of law enforcement who serve NH

Let's put this authority into law so that those who break the law don't get bonuses. I'm urging the Senate today to take up &amp; pass my bill.
Amazingly, VA Sec doesn‚Äôt have authority to claw back bonuses, even if‚Äîas with the wait lists‚Äîtheir misconduct led to a bigger bonus check.
I intro'd bipartisan legislation to require the VA Sec to claw back bonuses paid to employees involved in serious misconduct or felonies.
A common theme in all these VA scandals‚Äîthose committing misconduct are getting bonuses - aka getting checks paid by the America taxpayer.
But length of time veterans wait is one of the ways bonuses for hospital officials were determined.
Unfortunately, one of those cases was in NH. They tried to keep numbers down on the length of time vets waited 4 appts.
The VA inspector general investigated 73 VA facilities across the country and found scheduling problems in 51 of them.
The denial of earned care for veterans is always tragic but it is inexcusable when it is driven by bureaucratic tampering and falsifications
Going to floor soon to discuss my bill to claw back VA bonuses ‚Äì We need to do better by our veterans. Watch: https://t.co/C5qcKny4AM

Urge my colleagues to pass #GAP Act so we can strengthen equal pay laws &amp; combat wage inequality
Proud to work with @SenCapito @senrobportman @SenatorBurr @SenDeanHeller on #GAP Act
After hearing fr stakeholders, we updated #GAP Act this week to protect salary transparency &amp; employees‚Äô right to discuss
#GAP Act prohibits retaliation against employees who discuss their pay &amp; tells employers they can‚Äôt institute pay secrecy policies
#GAP Act is a sensible approach to update, clarify and strengthen these laws
Unfortunately, there are a patchwork of laws &amp; differing court opinions tht govern employees‚Äô ability to discuss pay w/o retaliation
#GAP Act makes clear that employers must pay men &amp; women equal wages for equal work w/o reducing merit pay
#GAP Act builds on NH‚Äôs highly successful bipartisan pay equity law ‚Äì Men &amp; women shld receive #equalpayforequalwork
In NH, more than half of the women are the primary or co-earners in their households. We need to address this problem
Let me be clear ‚Äì no woman, mother, sister, daughter should ever have to face gender-based pay discrimination in the work place
Women face many challenges in work &amp; family life ‚Äì I have dealt with this first hand as a working mom of 2 kids
On #EqualPayDay, I‚Äôm speaking on the importance of ending gender-based wage discrimination in NH &amp; across the country
Respecting women is an issue that Rs&amp;Ds can agree on. We share common ground in wanting to fight pay discrimination https://t.co/N83IZYd9po
Salary transparency is key in this fight. GAP Act protects employees' ability to talk abt pay &amp; tells employers they can't sidestep that.
The GAP Act takes a sensible approach to strengthening equal pay laws and addressing pay discrimination https://t.co/N83IZYd9po #EqualPayDay

Like the Manchester high schooler who shared his concerns for his community that‚Äôs being devastated by this epidemic
This crisis does not discriminate by age, socioeconomic class, gender, or any other category. Not R issue or D issue ‚Äì it affects all of us.
#CARA is an important tool because it embodies the comprehensive approach ‚Äì it brings all stakeholders to the table
Tackling this epidemic needs a comprehensive approach - strategies 4 treatment, prevention, education, individuals in recovery
The Senate should listen to and learn from these Granite Staters who are on the front lines. This is what they‚Äôre saying:
Across NH, people are working to raise awareness about the epidemic in every way ‚Äì from 5Ks and rallies to roundtables and community forums.
I‚Äôve had the opportunity to visit these facilities and hear directly from the talented people who work there. They do important work.
Treatment facilities work around the clock to deliver compassionate care and resources for those struggling w addiction
On ride-alongs with @mht_nh_police, I‚Äôve seen firsthand what they encounter every day &amp; their incredible work to save lives
I have made it a priority to hear from  those on the front lines in NH finding effective strategies to solve this urgent problem
A mother in Greenville: ‚ÄúAs I tried to comfort those who have been affected by this tragedy, I think that my son will be next.‚Äù
Griffin family fr Newton: Lost their 20 yr old daughter to an overdose &amp; Doug Griffin has made it his mission to raise awareness
A parent in Salem: She can‚Äôt afford to pay for a treatment program for her son, but she knows he needs help
I have heard heartbreaking stories from all over NH. This is hitting every corner of my state hard
But I will say it again ‚Äì These statistics are not just numbers. Behind every number is a son, sister, mother, neighbor or friend
In February alone, there were a record high 14 suspected opioid overdose deaths in Manchester ‚Äì NH‚Äôs largest city
This is a life or death issue in NH. Number of drug overdose deaths is staggering: NH had over 420 drug overdose deaths in 2015
Glad to work with @senrobportman @SenWhiteHouse &amp; @amyklobuchar on #CARA and thank them for their leadership

This an unserious plan that underscores need for Gitmo 2 keep dangerous terrorists off battlefield&amp;gather intelligence needed 2 keep us safe
Admin plan uses recycled discredited arguments. Any1 who thinks terrorists will lay down arms if Gitmo closed misunderstands their ideology
Americans do not want Gitmo terrorists here &amp; Congress has repeatedly affirmed will of ppl by prohibiting admin from moving detainees to US
POTUS #Gitmo closure plan does not endorse location in US for relocating detainees or a credible strategy for future terrorist detainees.

We need to hear a stronger response from #FDA on this matter ‚Äì we need engage all stakeholders in this fight
I urge Congress to come together and pass #CARA so that we can help turn the tide against this deadly epidemic
#CARA would expand opioid prevention and educational efforts, while bringing more resources to 1st responders
I‚Äôm pleased that the Judiciary Committee recently unanimously approved of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act
Should Dr. Califf be confirmed, he must pledge to the Senate that he will work to implement real change at FDA
While FDA Action Plan takes steps in the right direction, it must go further &amp; address risks of abuse in decision-making process
Last year, the FDA approved OxyContin for use by children as young as 11 &amp; did not consult with an advisory committee
.@samhsagov reports that 4/5 new heroin users started w non-medical use of prescription pain relievers
While Rs &amp; Ds have come together &amp; admin prioritized $ to fight this epidemic, I continue to have concerns that FDA is not following suit
I‚Äôve heard from countless families about the heartbreak of losing a loved one to addiction ‚Äì this epidemic does not discriminate.
Last year, over 400 people in NH succumbed to a drug overdose ‚Äì and if it weren‚Äôt for lifesaving Narcan, the number would be higher
This is the single largest public health and safety issue in NH &amp; every corner of the state is being hit hard
Across the country, approx. 30,000 people died from a heroin or prescription opioid overdose in 2014
The heroin &amp; prescription opioid abuse epidemic is devastating NH, and the home states of many of my colleagues

On Senate floor calling for the President to immediately nominate a permanent watchdog to bring accountability to the VA
We should have a vote on a clean bill now that will keep the government funded
It's time to quit the games. I came here to solve problems &amp; that means we need to address this issue
We need a clean funding bill now so we're not wasting time and bringing ourselves closer to brink of shutdown
Right now we're paying a game of chicken and it's a dangerous game
This is the same question I asked during the 2013 shutdown over Obamacare funding - and I didn't get an answer then
They can't answer the question, what's the end game for success here?
I've asked those who are pushing this strategy,where do the votes come from to get a successful result?I have not received an answer to that
Even if we could get 60 votes in Senate, President knows we don't have votes to override his veto. So end result would be a shutdown
President has vowed to veto any bill that redirects Planned Parenthood funding - he's dug in and prepared to let govt shut down
Despite the fact we don't have the votes to redirect Planned Parenthood funding, some are still pushing to tie this to govt funding bill
With 1 week until govt funding runs out, we need to make sure we keep the government running

We remember the ordinary citizens who became heroes through uncommon acts of courage.
We remember the bravery of our 1st responders, who did not run away from danger, but who ran forward to the aid of others
14 years ago today, the bravery and selflessness of so many shone brighter than the hatred meant to bring us down
But today we also reflect on the strength and unity of the American people in the face of such horror.
We will never forget these men and women, or stop praying for their families and loved ones.
We honor &amp; remember the nearly 3000 innocent people who were tragically lost in the horrific terrorist attacks on our nation on Sept 11 2001

I worked with @ChrisCoons to introduce two bills to address these issues: Manufacturing Skills Act &amp; the Manufacturing Universities Act
We can also reform, improve our education system to make sure graduates are better equipped with the tools they need to succeed
We must ensure that we‚Äôre adequately training not only our current workforce, but also the next generation of American innovators.
Employers today need workers who are critical thinkers, problem solvers, and team players.
... is that they‚Äôre having a hard time finding skilled workers to fill open positions (2/2)

RT @DaveSolomon72: @KellyAyotte hears from Lori Weeks of Strafford whose deceased daughter's SS# was stolen, and tax pro John Walker http:/‚Ä¶
Heartbreaking testimony from Lori Weeks of Strafford-tragically lost her daughter in car accident, identity thieves then stole her identity
with the goal of identifying necessary steps the IRS must take to improve its response to this growing problem (2/2)
The purpose of our hearing today is to take a critical look at how the IRS handles tax-related identity theft cases (1/2)
Congress can also play a role to the extent that legislative fixes are needed to reduce fraud
While the IRS is taking some steps to reduce fraud, its clear that much more must be done to prevent fraud from occurring in the first place
The least the #IRS can do is provide them with copies of their fraudulent returns so that they may secure their personal identity
Tax fraud victims should not be left in the dark regarding the full extent of what personal information was stolen
And with major data breaches occurring more frequently, I am concerned that we will see tax fraud affect even more taxpayers next year.
That‚Äôs a nearly tenfold increase since 2010.
About 2.4 million taxpayers‚Äô names or Social Security numbers were used to file fraudulent tax returns in 2013.
We‚Äôre here today to discuss a growing problem, not only in NH, but across the country ‚Äì tax-related identity theft.
