@FoxNews @charliekirk11 That’s a very East German viewpoint.
@GOPChairwoman For a strict constitutionalist, this is a severe stretch.
Agree or disagree but today’s marches follow a long and particularly American tradition of peaceful protest to affect change. Let’s hope our leaders take inspiration and work together to move our nation forward. No - let’s PUSH our leaders to do that.
RT @marcorubio: Today many are peacefully exercising their #1A right to march for gun ban. Many support gun ban. But many others see it as…
@marcorubio So what are you proposing to do? Leaders take action. There is a reasonable middle ground that millions of Americans will support!
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump All pretense of measured, objective journalism gone.
@alexreid2000 @charliekirk11 Since you’ve only given me “not” items I’ll have to assume that you think Japan is in Western Civilization? They’re not Islamic nor Socialists? And you don’t have to go far back in history to see that culturally they’re FAR from “globalist”
@RepCardenas Kudos for outlining a reasoned case.
@charliekirk11 I’d love to read your definition of Western Civilization.
RT @RepAlGreen: Lawyer resigns. National Security Adviser fired. Porn star sued. Dow down 700+ points. How does this make America great aga…
@TuckerCarlson When the leader is actively promoting your entertainment/opinion shows... you’re State TV
Amazing how so many who call themselves fiscally conservative are cheering a $1.3 TRILLION dollar spending plan that increases the debt. Kudos.
“As leaders we must reject the ‘us against them’ mentality” is something REAL leaders today need to say more. Well said @SenDougJones - now who from the @GOP will echo that sentiment? https://t.co/0YCsGkhdjH
@thehill In other similarly shocking news, reports are that the sky is blue.
@RepSwalwell Completely agree. Did you feel the same way in 1994 regardless of what your definition of the word “is” is? Because many of us feel the same way. And we’re damn tired of it.
@TuckerCarlson When this is the message right below yours... I wonder why priorities aren’t consistent. https://t.co/2bpLE1MKBp
@MarkSimoneNY Funny. I don’t remember JFK using campaign funds to pay off Marilyn Monroe.
@GOPChairwoman This from the same group that spent 8 years with no agenda other than “Not Obama.”  When will the adults get to DC?
@StephenGutowski Can you advise on a number of acceptable killings in schools per year?
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Isn’t that exactly what Muller is doing?
Kudos to @BrookeBCNN for asking the correct question. Let’s hope more journalists follow her lead!! https://t.co/RusdtlvDSm
Solid bipartisan legislation to protect those who need help and would otherwise be helpless. Kudos to you @senrobportman https://t.co/E1O1bdhdRh
@Reuters When people clamor (rightly) about inefficiencies and waste in government please remember this - a law certain to be struck down by each and every Federal court.
@FoxNews @iamjohnoliver Slammed by whom? Self reporting. He’s a COMEDIAN. Get over yourselves.
@JohnCornyn It went out when @FoxNews went on the air.
RT @ReasonbleCenter: @matthewjdowd Matt, perhaps could ignite this by doing an @ABC special on this?  @uniteamerica @UnitersCentrist @Indie…
@DonaldLHolland @FoxNews Rastafarianism is a religion for one example.
@FoxNews So the same people who are arguing that we have enough gun laws are now advocating MORE drug laws?
@thehill Wouldn’t this be SOP for the White House (and, totally unenforceable under Federal sunshine laws).
RT @SenJohnMcCain: Special Counsel Mueller has served our country with honesty and integrity. It’s critical he be allowed to complete a tho…
@SrChrisPerry @FoxNews @EthanBearman @JudgeJeanine Whitewater had nothing to do with perjury either.
@thehill Drudge could find over 75% of readers want to re-instate the Chappaquiddick investigation too.
@KamalaHarris Great concept but it requires people to provide said service. So how do you propose enforcing providers to provide "access" to their services as a "right?"
@realDonaldTrump Because when you're investigated you want the hardest, meanest, most biased, most thorough investigator to do it. So when they come up with nothing you can stand back and say with clarity there was nothing. But. He's got three indictments... so far. Not nothing.
@ShantezMartina @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I’m still waiting for a name to back up your earlier claim.
@ShantezMartina @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Again... who? Who did he want that was rejected? Only one person was from what I can tell and he was rejected because he not only beat his wife but he couldn’t divest his company as required by law.
RT @ReasonbleCenter: Flake makes case for GOP to challenge Trump @CNNPolitics https://t.co/EKIcD7DZRA
@SrChrisPerry @FoxNews @EthanBearman @JudgeJeanine THREE people are indicted of federal crimes. By definition this isn't a meritless investigation. And the total cost is less than HALF that of a proposed parade.
@ShantezMartina @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump So you're saying he had his pick of people to bring on to support him in his mission to stop all of this and instead chose non-ideal people so it would take him longer to kick off this massive defeat of the "globalist, tyrannical" forces?
@ShantezMartina @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Name three "first" choices that were tossed for "no reason."
@thehill This was an offhand remark - has there been a proposal to really react to? I mean, come on, this guy gives enough REAL stuff to do stories on - you don't need to play in the manure to dig up the dirt.
@GHOSTMONKEY99 @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump The insults don't elevate your message. Not disagreeing, just pointing that out.
@ShantezMartina @FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Uh, Rex Tillerson was his first choice. As was Reince Priebus. And a good leader wouldn't accept a bad candidate to "get started." Frankly, there are still dozens of roles unfilled and un-nominated throughout the executive branch - on top of those being held up.
@SrChrisPerry @FoxNews @EthanBearman @JudgeJeanine Whatever there might be. Whitewater produced 0 indictments (the impeachment claim wasn't an indictment) while Muller already has several indictments in process.
Remember.... the standard for Presidents in on-the-record interviews by special prosecutors is to tell the truth... about whatever is asked. https://t.co/N68TKUJUlp
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump But he HAND-PICKED these people... any manager who hires people and then fires 1/4 of them within 12 months is NOT a good judge of talent.
@FoxNews @EthanBearman @JudgeJeanine The Whitewater investigation went on for THREE YEARS before any articles of impeachment were drawn up. Watergate took over two years from the break-in. This pace isn't off the standard.
Anyone else out there missing the time when our leaders had a sense of decorum? Like before there was sex with interns in the Oval Office or childish insults tweeted online? So glad my kid gets to grow up with this new standard.
@IngrahamAngle His grammar is correct since he's speaking about "Our Politicians" as a collective not as individuals.
If you didn't care about inappropriate contact in the Oval Office (or lying about it) then you shouldn't care about extramarital sex with a porn star (or using campaign funds to pay hush money). We need to focus on the bad leadership, not bad morals.
@JeffFlake Gee... why would a sitting Senator from Arizona be in New Hampshire? Just announce and be transparent. #Flake2020
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The fact you can say this with a straight face is amazing. This Administration has the worst hiring record of any in modern history.
@robsambolic @MarkHess1052 @davidharsanyi @KatiePavlich See? Here's the thing. I'm just fine with trusting that our system works not because an army is scared of individuals with rifles but because our leaders are scared of individuals with votes. I own guns. Not assault rifles, but guns. There's no need for a 30-round clip. Ever.
BTW... being Pro-Life means being pro-life. If you don't look at this and wonder how we're not doing more to fight oppression then you're not really 100% pro-life. https://t.co/QzLY2Achoc
@FoxNews @VeteranTinoco Ladders work too.
@MarkHess1052 @davidharsanyi @KatiePavlich This isn’t change for change’s sake... they’re arguing for a specific change in policy that affects them. Disagree with their position but they are advocating for real change.
@DiamondandSilk Y’all serious??? It’s called priorities. Look at the GA 5th. NOBODY is going to defeat John Lewis. It’s a waste of time money and resources to run someone there.
@FoxNews So... you’re saying we should let them in to begin with? Because @realDonaldTrump disagrees with that.
@HouseGOP It's a reboot of a 49-year-old program.... to combat a modern problem. Yeah, I've got super high confidence. Explain why I should feel better?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump This is simply a re-activation of a 49-year-old program. This is NOT a real response. Congrats at throwing $50M of taxpayer money at a 2018 problem with a 1968 solution
the @HouseGOP and @HouseDemocrats are collectively patting each other on the back for passing the #StopSchoolViolenceAct ... read it. They re-enabled a law from 1968. Which is perfect because NOTHING about the problem has changed in the last 49 years.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary So you support giving the authorities more ability to take guns out of the hands of those with mental issues?
@HouseGOP Good job. You re-authorized a bill from 49 years ago. Nice job patting yourselves on the back. Can you go do some real change now?
@RepDonaldPayne @HouseDemocrats Correct me here... but if we have the Dream Act enabled wouldn't deportations and detentions be used for those who have truly broken the law? Dreamers (of all ages) should be allowed to stay. But to say we should strip funding for deportations - too far.
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Great idea! Let’s raise the prices on foreign goods so nobody can afford them! That’ll help.
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS You mean like Merrick Garland?
There are 5 million members of the NRA. There are 350 million people in the United States. Over 130 million votes were cast in the 2016 election. If you don’t agree with the NRA - drown out their voices with your votes.
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for everything you've done for our nation.
Agree or disagree but there's nothing wrong with - or better there's EVERYTHING RIGHT with young people engaging peacefully with political discourse. #NationalWalkoutDay
@davidharsanyi @KatiePavlich Courage for what exactly? Is it courageous to maintain the status quo? I get your point of being in the minority... but the real courage is always to advocate for change.
Key word here... Bipartisan. Now... let's see if anything can actually come from this. We need MORE Bipartisan meetings and discussions but MUST hold both parties accountable for actions! https://t.co/sJOgef8lPk
In related note... millions of Americans want to recall their 2016 Election Votes after the wheels have come off in Washington. https://t.co/HyrqLZVwL6
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany And moderate Republicans have been run out by your network for the past 12 years. Look no further than your ruthless attacks on Sen. @SenJohnMcCain and on @JohnKasich
@FoxNews So what's more important here... his religion or the lack of mental illness help he was able to receive?
@SenFeinstein And the middle will be listening for proposals that are truly commonsense. So far, very few have been. But we're hoping you're working for ALL of us...
@nextdoorMuslim @IngrahamAngle @ConorLambPA @TomCottonAR @realDonaldTrump Uh... the "heartland" just elected a Democrat. The same "heartland" district that voted for Trump +20 elected someone he ACTIVELY campaigned against.
@stuartmulin @nextdoorMuslim @IngrahamAngle @ConorLambPA @TomCottonAR @realDonaldTrump Who knows. He changes direction more often than the wind.
@IngrahamAngle @ConorLambPA @TomCottonAR Love it. So when @realDonaldTrump campaigns against him and calls him names he's a horrible liberal... and when he wins he should switch parties to the GOP?
@LouDobbs Dear @LouDobbs - how exactly does this Make America Great Again? What does this do to HELP?
@SenBlumenthal Completely agree... so where's your head-to-head meeting with the NRA to find middle ground here? Where are you working across the aisle to get things done? Stop shouting from the sidelines, get in the middle and get your hands dirty. #MovetheNeedle
@SenWhitehouse @SenateDems Would love to know who this pandering serves? How about proposing REAL, PASSABLE environmental protection? Find options that move the needle, not just screaming from your side of the bench.
@realDonaldTrump Thanks for wasting $18B of our hard-worked dollars on technology that can be defeated by a LADDER.
Tired of sitting on the sidelines. Jumping into the fray. The middle has been silent for too long. Congrats middles, join in and shout along with me.
