.@SenSanders finishes strong "I don't believe in giving tax breaks to the very, very wealthy, and cutting life and death programs."
Oh staahhhp, @TedCruz. Denmark ≠ East Germany. Democratic socialism ≠ to communism. @SenSanders vision doesn't need guns or atheism.
A lighthearted moment referring to Larry David's impersonation of @SenSanders. 😂
Clear that @TedCruz and @SenSanders are on the far ends of their respective parties. Would love to see debate reaching more toward center.
JFK would be run out of today's Democratic party according to @tedcruz. Probably true because they reject #ProLife positions.
Bush tax cuts already favored the rich, says @SenSanders. They don't need more tax cuts, and more cuts won't help economy grow, he says.
Round 3 was supposed to be about capping "small" biz tax rate at 25%. Neither addressed it. Disorganized &amp; rhetorical. More heat than light.
Round 2 estate tax: advantage @SenSanders. Cruz defends tax free income for ultra wealthy heirs; let's promote employee ownership instead!
But when @SenSanders brings up campaign finance, Koch brothers driving #TaxReform, he makes a good point about $ breaking real democracy.
Round 1 re lowering corporate tax rate: advantage Cruz, because @SenSanders isn't addressing the issue directly.

@holycounciloc, congratulations on the Council, and on being another unified voice in the world for peace, unity, and truth serving mankind.
@Chris_Buckley, the convention will be in July, unfortunately on FB. So far we are in the nomination stages, but it could go either way.
@Chris_Buckley @CDU_US We have effectively merged into @AmSolidarity. I did not realize they still tweeted! Chris Erickson is ASP now.
@Chris_Buckley, unfortunately at this time, we have chosen to use fb for our convention &amp; discussion. Input via email is welcome, however!
Check out our complete platform at https://t.co/oVfkRmHHB0 -- consistent life ethic, strong community, &amp; economic equity are primary themes.
With @HilaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump as the nominees, it is Right, it is Duty, to throw off such Parties, and to provide for our Future.
If you think business should serve humankind, &amp; government can have a balanced role in the economy, you're not crazy--just not represented!
Come be a part of the @AmSolidarity official convention! Info on Facebook, and all registered members are welcome to participate!
