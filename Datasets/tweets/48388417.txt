@MrMediaTraining Agreed on the humor. I think a difference is how Crenshaw was injured. And with Norm Macdonald, I remember it being part of the character portrayal and not the focal point of the sketch. Patterson’s blindness was definitely mocked, but i feel like the genesis is a distinction.
Dan Crenshaw wasn’t even a household name. He’s not Ted Cruz or Steve King. Out of hundreds of candidates, #SNL did some research. And then specifically mocked Crenshaw b/c he’s the only candidate wearing an eyepatch after losing an eye in an IED blast in Afghanistan. Yikes.

I wasn't using '14 as a baseline for turnout. All I was trying to do is measure "inches" as referred by Quinnipiac. So I think what we can say, is that at a minimum, inches/5% = 200,000+ votes. But with higher turnout 5% = 300,000+ votes. https://t.co/RcNngmJbO0
@GregSpeedDC This is encouraging because I might need a new calling in a week.
@BrianKSmith81 @daveweigel The point was that, at a minimum, "inches" is a couple hundred thousand voters, if not more.
@MaxPower_007 I agree that '16 turnout will likely be higher. So that means "inches" will mean even more votes.
Would you take the over/under on #ILGov Bruce Rauner at 36%?

@jacobfhsmith @dougducey I think rejected is a strong word. What if they just wanted Sinema more? And plenty of senators have served after winning with a plurality and getting "rejected" by a majority of a state's voters.

@BriPC23 I think a uniform definition could be good. But then proportional representation based on what? Which race, which cycle, for a decade worth of districts?
@OriginalBad As I've said, more competitive districts is better for business.
@PoliticsWolf But it still isn't "fair" though, right, under the definition Robby and others are using.
@OriginalBad I'm not saying Republicans didn't gerrymander PA. They absolutely did. But the Democrats' selective use of the word "fair" is going to drive me insane.
@cardinals150 @LPDonovan @DKElections Right now? Zero. According to Democrats' definition of fair, it should be something close to statewide performance. In MA, that's probably at least 35% (depending on which race). So GOP should get at least 3 of 9 congressional seats.
