@AMprefersPM @_waleedshahid @BernieSanders @shaunking I'll vote for no one who doesn't release their taxes and BERNIE'S on what, his 3rd or 4th home.	I see very little difference between him and Trump at this moment.
@chucktodd @Jim_Jordan Why do you MSM anchors let them off the hook? Why not call him on his BS, it's not like WE care, if you have his lying, obfuscating, self on our screens, EVER! Who will you interview next, Kellyanne? CNN has her and others, which is why WE call em FOX lite!

@ShirleyMArmenta @IGomezGuitar @Humanities201 @IlhanMN You said it..61M voted for Trump.	In a land of 350M...and you can see, the problem with your math going into 2020...after 1 term of a disastrous Presidency...well...

@MrDane1982 It's way, way early. He is at top right now (Biden not in yet) but plenty of time and candidates, to choose from.
@nypost @newyorkpost whataboutism in regards to your owners ride?
@Zeoran @profmjmack @AOC "Biggest NARCISSIST, you've ever seen?" Is something wrong with your eyes? TRUMP literally had a proxy, outbid everyone, for his self-portrait, he wanted to make sure, EVERYONE knew his portrait, was top seller! Then hung it in one of his shell compaines!

@Sandra_D_in_OKC hello from Oklahoma
Trump at C-PAC basically calling for the Klan and any other RACIST, BIGOTED, anti-semitic, Cult 45 sheep, to be accepted in the mainstream or else "you should sue them." 		And then hugged the flag in an unpatriotic way, basically begging C-PAC, to reelect him
Where is the outrage from the GOP over Wesr Virginia GOP putting up a poster linking @IlhanMN to 9/11?		Or how chummy Jared "I'm an easy mark" Kushner is kowtowing to Mr. Bonesaw?		Or anything Trump does!
I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to super inflate the price of my house and land, by oh! Let's say....3600%, purely just to help with inflating my EGO, but I don't want ANY legal repercussions, mind you.

Israel may have been just as complicit in our elections as Russia. Of course this would be at the behest, of Benjamin Netanyahu. Papadopoulos had to register as an Israeli foreign agent, these threads are being pulled. Not a good look, if true, at all Israel.
Jewish community is this OFFENSIVE to the Arab community?	Where is your OUTRAGE with this obviously hate based tweet? https://t.co/aQRKZAnPfP

@ecartsonis @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump These questions I second.
@LincolnsBible @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump This question...yes!
@dorothyofisrael Marginalized???
@dorothyofisrael @IlhanMN Nope..AIPAC is a lobbying entity for the Jewish community...all lobbyists need to get out of Government, full stop!
@dorothyofisrael @IlhanMN Oh, so this is a deflection..so I'll take that as a NO you didn't have the same reaction...anyhoo! Anti-semitism is deplorable as is all RACIST tropes...but I'm not seeing it, in this instance.
@dorothyofisrael @IlhanMN Also...did you have this same reaction to Kevin McCarthy after he was inflammatory towards Soros, Steyer, right after a pipe-bomb was mailed to Soros house?
@dorothyofisrael @IlhanMN I'm not dismissing I'm stating that speaking out against AIPAC is NOT anti-semitic.
@DanielSeidemann Not the World, she called out a hypocritical GOP Congressman, who is guilty of worse than what she said, yet where is McCarthy's scorn, call for his head, his apology..all he did was delete an fed-up tweet, that he had pinned.
@kylegriffin1 @PrincessBravato Sure! I lived in St. Pete, Fla...I KNOW this is bullshit.
Why are both sides coming out hard against @IlhanMN because of her jab at AIPAC? It's almost like they don't want to piss off a lobbyist entity. I mean if they don't lobby or donate to members of Congress why the heat? I don't see it for the NRA!
@dorothyofisrael Really...I'm Native American partly..an insult of the trail of tears or wounded knee...black face or Klan garb...yes those piss me off...stating facts on AIPAC isn't. It is an attack on free speech, which is kinda what the GOP wants..to ban protest of Israel.

@factsimile1 Amazing! I thought he wanted to "own" you. Mehta! He weak.
@NickMathews21 @NBCNews When Trump does.
@factsimile1 @smug_liberal @Existingbefresh @LMS55118731 @AOC Again...you are the one bagging on @AOC so that would be; "she's living rent free in YOUR head." Us commenting are with HER!
Experiment: If I say Israel needs to stay out of America's politics and by saying this, use my 1st Amendment right to free speech, is this anti-semitic?
@RobertWhitekett @AOC You only use Venezuela as your model of Socialism there are more examples but you DOGWHISTLE Venezuela because your President does.
@smug_liberal @Existingbefresh @LMS55118731 @AOC No mankind will save the planet.
@smug_liberal @Existingbefresh @LMS55118731 @AOC And we will NEED a planet too.
@smug_liberal @AmorGaia @Existingbefresh @LMS55118731 @AOC Have you visited Mexico City before?
@smug_liberal @Existingbefresh @LMS55118731 @AOC Yet we seem to have unlimited money for the Military...so...ummm...me thinks it can be done.
@RobertWhitekett @AOC Wow!	Good defense sunshine.

@realDonaldTrump Lazy! 		You say you are working hard but this post is an RT. Your fingers are tiring, nap time.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Good job President Pence!		 Now if you could get the phone away from the senile guest Trump..someone who is supposed to be watching him, messed up and he has insulted, many cultures, lately.		Turn on Scooby-Doo...that will keep him occupied for awhile.
@realDonaldTrump You can act like you don't know the difference between a weather event and climate change an you have said, you don't care, because you won't be around but I ask you this;		 BARON will be around, does that matter to you?
@Jim_Jordan @AdamSchiff Well is Simpson a Gov't official? No!		Do you feel Nunes committed a grievous error in judgement by telling a person, under investigation, that he is being investigated? I think not!		Gym! Take a seat, you have no case here, you have zero credibility.
@CapehartJ @SenKamalaHarris @SenAmyKlobuchar @SenWarren That's just because that's the only one's you can remember...oh! Wait..
@realDonaldTrump Amy Kloubacher announced a run against you in the cold and snow..I know you watched it..you should do some sit-ups..you will need the stamina..TV watching and tweeting isn't excercise..you will need to be ready...another Blue wave is coming.
How do you do that..I CAN'T get him to block me.  Pro-tips please and thank you! https://t.co/arN1tenjRt
@deemaah_ksa  you are responsible for ordering the death of Jamal Khashoggi. America will deal with Trump and Kushner and company 1st and then deal with you and your Country. America will not allow you to walk away from your heinous crime.
@AdelAljubeir you know exactly what happened and where the body is..MBS ordered this murder..full stop! Jamal Khashoggi's body, will never be recovered because the Government of Saudi Arabia had it dismembered and disposed of..MBS = GUILTY!

@Twitter Trump's latest tweet still isn't in violation? Doesn't even merit a 24hr time-out? He will continue to tweet hate speech, until you step-up and tell him enough is enough.

@realDonaldTrump Trump or as I sometimes call him "Putin's bitch" still hasn't figured out, how to be a US President..Your circle is closing on your criminal enterprise and America will remember you, as a cautionary tale. Never trust a TRUMP!
@GOP Take all the seats! 		You support Trump who shows an unhealthy affection for dictators, World wide.
@realDonaldTrump Putin, MBS, KimJongUn, Sissi, Assad, Xi! Never in American history has a US President called this group friends, while bashing our Western alliance and our own intelligence agencies.  My hope is..YOU GO DOWN HARD WITH ALL YOUR SYCOPHANTS.

@ChaseIronEyes Who made this statement?
MSM keeps talking about the Elizabeth Warren "scandal" and continues to miss valid/valuable information on a possible RUSSIAN ASSET leading our Nation. Glad there are digital media warriors, who strive to keep us informed. @SethAbramson
@senatemajldr Boy that "2nd kick of the mule" mantra of yours must've knocked you senseless. You literally made it "your mission" to obstruct Obama's 2nd Presidency.
@peterbakernyt @AnnieLinskey @AmyEGardner Instead of reporting on a story that has been apologized for an accepted, next time you interview Trump, have the intestinal fortitude, to ACTUALLY ask better/tougher questions.
Concerning the state of Virginia: didn't Chief Justice Roberts say the South was fixed, no need to bother with looking at voter SUPPRESSION? A paraphrase of course and I know Virginia isn't in the South, the point is..ALL that is going on in the Country!

@ananavarro She DID need to apologize and it wouldn't hurt to add a scholarship or 2 for Native American Children. Let's also not forget about the Native American communities that are being denigrated, each time Trump calls Mrs.Warren names.Glad she apologized, finally.

@RealJamesWoods Who is James Woods?
@realDonaldTrump Hey Trump there's been 2 mass shootings this week...care to tweet out some condolences to families in Florida and Louisiana instead of bagging on journalists being fired or a WITCHUNT? Or since they aren't immigrants it doesn't fit your narrative!
@tariqnasheed Tariq is taking a move out of the Trump dystopia of Urban myth by declaming POC BAD ,hence the "Build the Wall"..listening to Rap music, pull back her hair.."Uncle "Tariq would fit perfectly inside the House of Trump.
Wrong! Once again, his statement was 'I was a Marine reservist during Vietnam, i never set foot in Southeast Asia'...'the Vietnam war was STILL going on,when i was active duty '...WaPo issued an APOLOGY..dickhead! https://t.co/PhGiAzswH2
Hey TRUMP care to comment on the MASS SHOOTING at the bank where 5 were killed by a homegrown  WHITE terrorist.  Would your WALL prevent that? Keep lying to America and yourself, that WALL is a RACIST monument to you and your RACIST base,only,YOU WON'T WIN! https://t.co/z2NPmXKTaD
You have 57.6M followers of which 23.3M are RUSSIAN bots, your polls numbers are tanking and 71% of AMERICANS don't want a WALL. You are under so many investigations that you CAN'T even be considered a President, it is time for you to resign. Buh bye! https://t.co/z2NPmXKTaD

@jaketapper Does this change your mind JAKE TAPPER,  tell your Gfriend Laura Ingraham, she is wrong..those MAGA HAT WEARING ENTITLED WHITE BOYS WERE IN THE WRONG...Just because you're a Catholic school boy yourself, try being impartial next time.
@jaketapper @reason @robbysoave @jaketapper FYI the school has already apologized so obviously they didn't appreciate the conduct of their students...you are what is commonly known in the BIZ of working with youth as an enabler! You CAN'T spell HATRED W/O REDHAT...you have a MAGA hat?
@jaketapper @reason @robbysoave Hey @jaketapper your Catholic bias is showing again..it's a shame that your Gfriend Laura Ingraham has you "spinning" this...you are the lucky Winner of me turning the channel, when your show comes on..
And there is the one tweet that shows the reason, why a "field trip to a Rez" won't work.  The adults are not teaching inclusion, they are preaching Trumpism. The Church is literally whitewashed and had no Cultural references, Uncle Nate got the APOLOGY https://t.co/TM7IohXEAK
So you're glad are you. The entitlement knows no bounds. It's a shame that a family was wrongly accused just as much as the Native American VETERAN, had to endure the total disrespect of that kid, with the smirk. If parents don't check behavior, then who, US? https://t.co/SczOXV7KRO

@piersmorgan This is Twitter you can type ASS shoot you can type ARSE too..you want to be dragged..@AOC AOC doesn't have to respond to the lightweights, we got this..you haven't been relevant since the original Magnum PI,you CAN'T fade AOC or shade her. Bye felicia!
@McCormickProf @amconmag Covington Catholic and all you enablers clutch those pearls. All WHITE school, they don't know how to act out in society, when all they see is the same image..80 teachers all WHITE..please..he stood and didn't move...consequences must come from somewhere.
@RepThomasMassie And you're as full of shit as the adults who didn't properly chaperone and allowed a group of hormone addled, testosterone fueled teens, to mass up like that..the one young man was in the wrong and once again, you're full of shit.
Can you tell that to Jake Tapper and his girlfriend Laura Ingraham, please,they seem unable to comprehend video footage. https://t.co/54pXBx139d
The full 2 hour video you are referencing has some of the kids chanting "build that wall" to which, they Black ISRAELI'S began their hate SPEECH toward the kids...it's there,go back listen...before the skateboarder. https://t.co/jSUF7Rx6Yx
@jaketapper @reason @robbysoave @jaketapper eff's up again...like did you WATCH the 2 hour video..All videos or are you cherry picking, to pander to the Right and your secret crush? Uncle Nate calmed EVERYONE briefly, as shown and said on video, DO BETTER!

@kellyrae2723 @TheWreckining @no_neanderthals @Jekajojo @kathygriffin So if it was black kids wearing BLM hats and a White Christian VETERAN then it wouldn't be "kids just being kids", it would be cops, arrests, thugs...such PEARL CLUTCHING for these poor lil Catholic boys. They know they were being rude.
@kellyrae2723 @Jekajojo @kathygriffin Seriously! Everywhere on the internet, TV outlets....they are showing the African AMERICANS taunting...the kids....you must not be WANTING to see it....or you're watching the SATIRE channel FOX

@WhiteHouse Hey Bob Mueller add extortion to the pile...see if that helps with a RICO case...
@realDonaldTrump So you could have gotten $25B last year and now make a deal for $5.7B?!? You should talk with your COS/OMB guy, so he can check your math.
@realDonaldTrump I will be doing,literally anything else,at that time,I'll have to pass!
@realDonaldTrump Donald, Donald, Donald, you do know that Witness intimidation is a naughty thing to do,right? I'd say ask Rudy but, personally, that dude ain't doing you any favors, out in the public eye..Giuliani is BAD BAD optics for you and may be undermining you, as well
@realDonaldTrump No YOU ARE the enemy of the people, stop deflecting, you know all the shady shit you've been doing and so does Mueller and so will the American people, soon...and then bye bye...to you.

@ChrisCuomo So you want to cave into a person, who by now, all evidence is pointing to being compromised by a foreign government, RUSSIA and who knows, how deep this goes. 	You CAN'T give in to a lunatic like Trump..McConnell needs to be dealt with or gone around..
@ChrisCuomo when did he "back off $5B? Last I heard he was up to $5.7B...if you know different then REPORT that...you know; your JOB...not all of us get to go to fancy lunches with an (alleged) RUSSIAN ASSET! Stop Dogwhistling!

@secupp @IlhanMN How is it homophobic?	Oh! Because YOU brought up sexuality,  because I didn't hear anything about sexually in the video. Seems someone is projecting.
More childish behavior from Republicans in the House. Jason Smith (R-Missouri) interrupted Rep. Tom Cardenaes (D) by yelling "go back to Puerto Rico " while speaking about Bill's to open Government. Doesn't SEEM like Republicans are taking shutdown seriously.

Is Tucker Carlson really that stupid?	Surely it's an act, when he said he doesn't really know, why we are in NATO helping Countries like Latvia and Estonia.  Now @realDonaldTrump yes I would believe he has no idea but Tucker CAN'T be that dense.
He's not in Louisville, Kentucky office, I called and only got ahold of a staffer...I did say I wanted to leave him a message.."open the Gov't there are enough votes in the Senate and enough to cover veto, do your job"..she said she would pass it along. https://t.co/oP5yNruxel

@christinawilkie @PressSec Did she realize the irony?
Per Richard Ingel https://t.co/HduCWbPbWK
ISIS claiming responsibility for suicide bombing in Syria..multiple deaths including Americans.
@SteveScalise Wrong! They are grown ass ADULTS dillhole.	They knew it was a photo OP ploy...YOU MAD BRO!

@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews Why?  Are you "coming out" finally? We already know...don't let Trump hold THAT over you.
@jimsciutto RUSSIAN ASSETS losing their silent majority
@senatemajldr Piss right on off you RUSSIAN TRAITOR. Put the vote on the floor or resign...you telling STEVE KING to find another line of work for being RACIST was exactly RIGHT...you need a federal prison cell.
@realDonaldTrump Electoral college that was corrupted by the Russians who were working on your behave, is how you usurp the WH, not the citizens.  exDOJ counterintelligence calls you "a clear and present danger" to OUR great Country. Resignation is your best option, do so!
@twitter you still refuse to suspend @realDonaldTrump account for blatant racist attacks against multiple groups of people not to MENTION witness intimidation.	So you DO have double standards...
RT @NOLAnews: Protesters chant “Lock him up” right outside the New Orleans Convention Center, where @realDonaldTrump is speaking today. htt…

@LindseyGrahamSC @LIFEforSC Next award should be Boris award for best RUSSIAN ASSET
Reports are that Trump used the word Fu*k to Mick Mulvaney, is the MSM going to hammer him for his language, like they did the Congresswoman's?	Naw...
Unless...you need a loan! https://t.co/wtX5kz8uM2
Well technically you DO negotiate when HOSTAGES are taken..in this instance however the proper NEGOTIATION is a PERP walk out the front door for Benedict Donald! https://t.co/2Yx57yYSLP
@marcorubio @POTUS What happened to OUR COUNTRY?	Who is working for RUSSIA in the GOP and who isn't?	You don't negotiate with a hostage taker and you DAMN sure don't negotiate with a fu*kin Traitor.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Racist POS!
No...what is it then..go ahead enlighten. https://t.co/PQ24r8SBGx
@NRA well...well...well..it's not enough that you foster the gun love in the Country but are nice and cozy with Russia apparently. Ollie North just CAN'T seem to escape shade.	Bill Barr CAN'T save you now...oh wait...hmmm...Trump just might..naw has own prob
There are like 1,000 News reporters on Twitter, all news formats. The tweets about Wounded Knee etc are a direct and extreme insult to Native Americans of this Country. Trump is an insult.STAND UP!
@realDonaldTrump Twitter doesn't this violate your standards protocol? It is blatantly RACIST. It walks all over the memorial of WOUNDED KNEE. POC have no voice? You CAN'T even suspend his account for 24hrs? This is absolutely WRONG, take a STAND TWITTER!
He doesn't care that he just did like an ultimate insult...he just keeps snorting away... https://t.co/wmSOKB7ojd
Trump wants to militarize the border now, Congress you need to move your ass, we don't know what plans he may have made with Russia and does the Military follow a lunatics orders?
@realDonaldTrump You're eventually going to jail along with your kids....so...there's that...what a Father you are...
It's Little Big Horn and Wounded Knee and very scared to the Native community....so yeah...go straight to hell Trump!
Who is supposed to baby sitting Trump tonight...because he just insulted an ENTIRE NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE
@pressec 	So Trump being Racist again..who the fuck is watching him
@realDonaldTrump You have some nerve talking about shit you no NOTHING about...you are really a piece of shit.
@realDonaldTrump Hey motherfuka you know shit about Wounded knee, Native Americans or anything American.  Keep your racist FUCKING MOTHER SHUT YOU RUSSIAN TRAITOR...
@SenJoniErnst She didn't speak out against the last 5 racist comments until after she won her reelection,  so save that FAKE YOU DIDN'T WRITE IT YOUR AIDES DID ANYWAY TWEET.
@AshaRangappa_ Username Thor Norse....so yeah!	Probably should have used references from Vikings to threaten Asha...so TOTAL FAIL DUDE!
@RepSwalwell @RepAdamSchiff Dana Rohrabacher is bent over so bad I'd be surprised, since he lost, he hasn't left for mother Russia already, that's one reason for the cover-up...Lindsey Graham had his e-mail hacked in July 2016 by Russia, he has done a 180..2nd reason...McConnell, Nunes
@Jim_Jordan @RepJerryNadler @POTUS @Jim_Jordan I know, you just didn't type "professionalism "...that's RICH coming from you....time to hit the SHOWERS?
@AOC Me thinks you win @Aoc...CBS I'm sure has had someone trolling...messaged received...mic drop!
I'd say the World is off balance but it's round so it's just spinning.
@tedcruz dude...that beard..
RT @funder: Reply to this tweet with a note to @SenateMajLdr. I’ll start. Dear Mitch-The government would reopen if you held a vote. But yo…
The WORLD is watching this fiasco called America.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump A GOP Senator from South Carolina with a possible connection to Russia along with a small group of GOP  Senators possibly in collusion with the President...may be brought up on charges that Bendict Arnold would cringe at,you pompous motherfu#@&amp;!
@pauliegtweets @IlvesToomas You do realize the shit storm your Mother Russia is about to stir up don't you?  The US has screwed the pooch with Trump...we'll fix OUR problem and best believe Russia is "dead red" in OUR sights.
Another key question we should ALL be thinking on right now...What will our response be to Russia, because there most definitely must be a very VERY hard, firm, unbending,  response.
@thehill Is it...really Pompeo...from where I'm sitting...not to hard to believe about right now and oh by the way...you have sacrificed your credibility for a possible Russian asset...so good luck with that.
@PressSec 	You didn't answer ANY of the report though. Hard on RUSSIA?	How so?	By relaxing sanctions on Ukrainian Oligarch with ties to Putin?	I thought you were quitting, hurry and do so..
@EdKrassen Nope...naw .NO...hell no..

@LindseyGrahamSC #votelindseygrahamSCout
@MichaelCohen212 Can you once and for all confirm that individual one is indeed President Trump and can you give some sign that Melania..a) is divorcing Trump and b) knows more of the "russian" angle.
@realDonaldTrump telling the Coast guard to have "yard sales " to compensate for no paycheck, in order to buy food and medicine ACTUALLY does make you a HUGE, muthafucka!
Have a yard sale!	What a Motherfu*ker!
@mirandablake505 @StephenRT1400 @ddale8 He is Canadian not American
TRUMP: "My Oval office broadcast was the most watched ever, NOBODY had a more watched or better spoken, SPEECH, I'm great"	@realDonaldTrump just letting you know, what you'll say, beforehand because ya know, LIES!
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Liar
@MikeSimba90 @kasie @KasieDC That's the 1st time that words been said on this show.
@thehill @LindseyGrahamSC  you have lost your spine, respect and any semblance of integrity since you have tried yourself so tightly to Trump,  when he goes down, like Nixon, those who did the same, will suffer the same fate. #KARMA
@kasie @jaketapper Come on @jaketapper step-up man..you could've extended your segment :15 sec to throw in their budget reconciliation BS but you didn't, you let the LIE play .do better
@thehill And why apologize?	She was right, he is and so are you.
RT @thehill: Manchin apologizes to "all Americans, any sitting Congress person" for Tlaib's profane call for Trump's impeachment https://t.…
@KaitMarieox You think it would offend her if someone said merry XMAS or happy HANUKKAH...how about if someone broke it down to her that Christmas is based on a PAGAN holiday and it isn't really Jesus's birthday anyway just celebrated on the 25th of December because ya know the English
Straight outta China... https://t.co/bN8EBucNw6
@realDonaldTrump Billions of lives saved?	Are you counting other Countries?	We only have 350 million here in America.
@realDonaldTrump Not only does the World think badly of us for electing Trump as our President but when they read his tweets, see the misspelled words, they think our education system, is sub-par as well.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Douchey
@realDonaldTrump Erdogan gave you an order...relayed via Putin and you quickly acted, against all advice from the adults in the room...WHY?!...because you desperately want to be accepted in their club of corruption and greed...you know you are losing your fortune here.
@realDonaldTrump Not knowing who Brett McGurk is says WAY more about you than any shade, you throw at him.
@realDonaldTrump Was your wife in Florida or St.Marts?...somebody flew on a govt jet there...we all were betting it was Munchin but there are a bunch of Russians there.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like your lunch was the Freedom caucus doing their cheer routine, stroking your ego and pledging fealty to your regime. After they got off their knees, they bent over and kissed your ring, so shut down continues, got it.
@realDonaldTrump The crisis you are making in the AG's office is looking like illegal activity and will BE stopped soon...MUELLER TIME! #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump Lies...lunch with Freedom caucus and other boot lickers..that should be productive
@realDonaldTrump Dip shit... Flynn and yourself wanted to sell a person to Turkey...you still might...#TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump Mcgurk quit as of 12/31 did you get that memo Trump
@realDonaldTrump How long does it take to finish your thoughts for the 2nd part Trump?
@funder #TrumpResign
@LindseyGrahamSC What happened to you?	When John McCain was around you had a backbone..now...you speak out once...stephen Miller and Trump spank you and you fall back in line, like a whipped pup...SAD!
@KatrinaPierson Get in touch with Cindy McCain...I'm sure she would tell you a few things.
Can't make out that statue in the background.... https://t.co/uuLuOf194t
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump That's a buzz phrase for a precursor to resignation.  Health will be the face save for Trump, to leave office, to save his Children.
