Slashing corporate taxes is not the right way to grow the economy. Investing in families would spur growth &amp; help millions get ahead.
Trump tax plan creates a huge deficit and does little to spur growth. It simply leaves behind working families who actually deserve support.
Trump‚Äôs tax plan is a fraud. A massive tax cut for corporations would balloon deficit and undermine investments in hard-working families.
Trump wants to slash taxes for millionaires &amp; big corporations, but do nothing for hard-working families who make this country great.

Presidential Tax Disclosure Act makes disclosure mandatory, ensuring all presidents will have potential conflicts of interest made public.
Public polls consistently demonstrate that a majority of Americans want President-elect Trump to publicly release his tax returns.
Though he indicated his children will take over Trump Organization as a blind trust, they are also serving on his presidential transition.
As President-Elect, Trump has refused to divest himself of his business holdings.
Trump‚Äôs failure to release his tax returns raises serious questions regarding how his financial holdings could impact decisions in office.
As President-Elect, Trump has continued to withhold his tax returns.
During 2016 campaign, President-elect Trump was first major presidential nominee since Gerald Ford to refuse to release his tax returns.
‚ÄúThis commonsense legislation will be critical in ensuring that President always operates under strictest ethical scrutiny and standards.‚Äù

This country needs a diverse White House staff that is committed to the core American values of inclusiveness, diversity and tolerance.
White House Chief Strategist must be prepared to serve the interests of all Americans, not those of a select few.
It should be of great concern that civil rights groups, including @ADL_National and @splcenter are widely opposed to Bannon‚Äôs appointment.
As Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, Bannon aggressively pushed stories that promote anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism.
Millions of Americans fear how Trump Administration will treat them and appointment of Bannon exacerbates and validates their concerns.
Bannon‚Äôs appointment sends the message that those who commit hate crimes will not only be tolerated, but endorsed by new Administration.
