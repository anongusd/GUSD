What a night of results -- the GOP's trade of suburbs for rural areas has totally turned the House map inside out, but the exchange has worked out better at the statewide level in some of the biggest guv races
Of course in one of the closest House races in the country right now, #VA02, there is a tabulation discrepancy between AP (https://t.co/9UJMhTcO8k) and VA elections authority (https://t.co/QWVxeFOhfB)
Bit of a Virginia legislature 2017 feel to some of the *early* House results -- Clinton-Republican districts are looking really tough for GOP, but holding their own in Trump districts -- so far. Could change -- #VA02 and #VA07 razor-close
Florida update: GOP Rep. Brian Mast wins in #FL18, but GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo trailing by 1.4pts with 90% of vote in. And Dems picked up #FL27 https://t.co/9UJMhTcO8k
Virginia update: ~90% in and Dems clinging to a small lead in #VA02 and miniscule lead in #VA07, two potential flips: https://t.co/9UJMhTcO8k
Barr holds #KY06 for the GOP, beating McGrath https://t.co/hpQas5SAKn
Close to three-quarters of #VA02 in and GOP Rep. Scott Taylor is up +2.6 -- but that's more than 7pts behind Trump's margin in that part of the district, and he only won the district overall by 3.5
BARNBURNER in #VA07: 36% of precincts in, Brat (R) leads Spanberger (D) by 0.5 points -- but Trump beat Clinton by 7 in same slice of district in 2016 while winning #VA07 by 6.5. VERY close so far
About half of precincts reporting in #VA10 -- in completed precincts, Wexton up +13, running very close to Clinton's +16 in those precincts in 2016. Clinton won the district by about 10
Little tidbit from @UpshotNYT's House polls that I've been looking at -- in aggregate across all districts, voters who 1) like their GOP rep, and 2) dislike Trump split close to 50-50 on their House ballots.  Shows how big a factor the president is compared to local stuff

It's no coincidence this has become more common in the super PAC era. If it was harder to recoup the money fewer people would choose to spend it this way

@dtwyman No problem, and I appreciate your thoughts. I just think we did cover that in the story! (If not the tweet, as you point out.) And you are right but there are multiple things going on here

Very proud of @politico for producing what I think was the best piece of data journalism about #ALSen - correlations to Moore's 2012 race right down the line with tonight's results &amp; this nailed the "why" https://t.co/Ahp5npO2fz https://t.co/z7dpR9D9cZ

Alabama earthquake: https://t.co/2sRVOtrUjL
Whatever the result, #ALSen is shaping up as another datapoint for increased polarization separating urban/suburban voters and rural white voters
In Madison County (home of Huntsville, 1/4 black &amp; 1/3 college-white), Jones is running 19 pts ahead of Clinton in completed precincts (29/73). Clinton got 34% statewide.		(Pulling this out because the county publishes live precinct data)

Watch Shelby Co. ‚Äî very white, very Republican &amp; most college degrees per capita in Alabama. Ds typically run in the 20s there but if coll+ whites come out for Jones, he could reach high 30s or even low 40s and this could get very interesting

@DavidSeawright I mean, also well spent? On 1 hand, a lot for one House district - on the other, wonder if small-donor money like that is "extra" in a sense
Safe to say at this point the ~ $4.6M the @nrcc and @CLFSuperPAC put into IEs in #GA06 was money well spent
@geoffreyvs Interesting! I've got Ossoff about 3-4% on average ahead of Clinton in Cobb -- right where he'd need to be on % but not where his votes are
