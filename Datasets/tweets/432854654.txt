We should be incentivizing carbon capture technology in common sense ways that are also economical. Otherwise, we‚Äôll continue to cede technology innovation leadership to other countries.
The EPA Power Plan was another example of President Obama and Gina McCarthy regulating by having the tail wagging the dog... The standards were unattainable and did nothing to clean up the environment and instead killed high paying jobs.
