President Trump took the policy issues that often polarize Washington and appealed to Americans with moving stories that showed the human side of policy decisions. #SOTU
The president was right to call out the atrocious actions of lawmakers in NY &amp; VA for pushing America toward infanticide. President Trump has not only been the most passionate president in talking about the humanity of the unborn, he has been the most persistent in protecting it.
.@POTUS: Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God. #SOTU
.@POTUS: To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother’s womb. #SOTU
.@POTUS: Lawmakers in NY cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love &amp; dreams with the world.
Another 3,750 troops to our southern border? If we had bricks on the ground – we wouldn’t need boots on the ground. #SOTU

“A society is judged by how it takes care of the most vulnerable.” That’s why we must have a pro-life president. #VPDebate
All laws are a reflection of someone’s moral standard! #VPDebate
Pence pulls back the curtain on Clinton/Kaine’s radical position on partial birth abortion. #VPDebate
Kaine boasts that Hillary negotiated the failed Iran nuclear deal without a shot being fired. True, it’s the coming boom that worries me.
Pence tells voters about Hillary’s pay for play scheme that raised money for the Clinton Foundation. #VPDebate
Pence refuses to give Kaine a pass on Hillary’s role in negotiating the failed Iran deal that ensures Iran will have nukes in a decade.
Kaine boycotted Israeli PM Netanyahu’s speech on Iran, given to a joint session of Congress. Only 1 of 8 senators to do so. #VPDebate
Again, Pence takes on Kaine for Hillary’s illegal handling of classified information. #VPDebate
The terrorist threat has been reduced? What world is Kaine living in? San Bernardino, Orlando, New York, New Jersey, Minneapolis etc.
Hillary did not apologize for calling half of Trump supporters a basket of deplorables. She apologized for saying “half." #VPDebate
Again, Pence goes where Trump did not -- takes on Hillary for insulting Trump supporters as “basket of deplorables." #VPDebate
Hillary will continue Obama's M.O. of indicting police officers for bias before knowing the facts. Remember the beer summit? #VPDebate
Here is the key to strengthening law enforcement in this country – a president who obeys the law. #VPDebate
We need more private sector jobs, not more government. #VPDebate https://t.co/3V1phZ9TTF
Kaine is a typical democrat politician – fixated on taxes! #VPDebate
Great contrast – Kaine left Virginia $2 billion in debt. Pence has reduced taxes created jobs in Indiana. #VPDebate

.@MegynKelly and I will discuss #marriage and SCOTUS ruling during 9 PM hour on #kellyfile.
Looking forward to joining @MegynKelly tonight during 9pm ET hour to discuss #SCOTUS #marriage ruling. #kellyfile
We'll keep speaking uncompromisingly about what #marriage is, has been, and always will be: the union of one man &amp; one woman. #SCOTUS
Americans will not stop standing for transcendent truth and never accept the legitimacy of this decision. #SCOTUS #marriage
#SCOTUS has set our govt on a collision course w/our cherished #religiousfreedom, explicitly guaranteed in 1st Amendment.
Just like Roe v. Wade in 1973, courts will not have the final say on this profound issue. #SCOTUS #marriage
It's folly for #SCOTUS to think it resolved #marriage issue. By disenfranchising 50 million Americans SCOTUS has supercharged it.
No court can overturn natural law.  Nature &amp; Nature’s God cannot be usurped by the edict of a court, even #SCOTUS
W/out foundation in Constitution's text, our history, or traditions, this #marriage decision has done serious damage to #SCOTUS legitimacy.
#SCOTUS #marriage ruling is shocking abuse of power, and will never be accepted http://t.co/OM0ZgyP1gw
How did the followers of Jesus respond to the threats designed to silence them?  They prayed for even more boldness to speak!  Acts 4:29
