RT @bobpockrass: @blairwa there was a mistake on an initial lineup circulated by #NASCAR. Reutimann didn't qualify.
@selinadanielle_ I have something I want to tell you, not a perv I promise!
@selinadanielle_ I promise I'm not flirting or trying to hook up with you, but can you hop on facebook and check your messages?
@selinadanielle_ there are soooo many sources out there, and it's hard to keep up with it all.
@selinadanielle_ Shoot for the stars! I'm sure it takes work and it's more than just posting updates, probably hard to keep up with it all
@selinadanielle_ and David may not even have a person at the track. I saw RBR's page hasn't posted in 3 hours.
@selinadanielle_ And of course there are no NASCAR drivers who run their own pages on Facebook, and it is probably some PR person or
@selinadanielle_ And I honestly can't believe NASCAR could make a mistake like that. Jayski posted the "OFFICIAL" lineup....
@selinadanielle_ I agree, I can't believe he didn't qualify. I'm a huge Reutimann fan also
@selinadanielle_ I know the feeling. I am a huge Reutimann fan and couldn't believe he didn't make it, but for some reason....
@selinadanielle_ http://t.co/p1eJVdmL
@selinadanielle_ There has been a lot of confusion about Reutimann for the Truck race. Websites had conflicting reports
@bobpockrass Reutimann? I know he was a DNQ but the jayski site had him 35th on the official PDF from NASCAR? Said two others withdrew?
@bobpockrass conflicting reports of Reutimann DNQ or starting 35th? Which is it?
@FO_ThomasPope I think Reutimann DNQ
#Danica on Nationwide Pole for tomorrow's race. We get to see what she's made of!
@Kenny_Wallace No "in-car tweeting"? Remember the old Jarrett commercial? In car commentating crew!
I didn't know Arlen Specter was running in 2012? And Dukakis?
@blairwa @MissSprintCup Thank you for the Reutimann pic! I manage his Facebook page so that comes in handy and his fans love it!
@MissSprintCup Hi! If you see David Reutimann in his Burger King uniform can you snap a pic pretty please?
