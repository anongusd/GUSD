@SenhorRaposa @jonahwexler Ok let's break it down	1.) "She's too left to run statewide. It's not Vermont."	2.) "Wait, do you think a Republican would really beat her in Clinton+16% Washington?"	3.) "No, why? I'm saying it's Washington."		what comes after that last bit
Should I watch Umbrella Academy?	(Either way I probably will)

@AsInMarx He was, actually (they called a special thing to swear him in). He only got to vote in the lame duck session tho.
But in a stroke of luck, Tony Evers won the gubernatorial race and chose him to be Secretary of the Department of Workforce Development. So by winning this semi-obscure special election for the state legislature by 3%, he vaulted himself into a state cabinet position. (2/2)
An underrated story of 2018 was Caleb Frostman. He won a special election for a red Wisconsin State Senate district and then lost the regular election by ~9%, meaning he was a Senator for just a few months (and had never held another office). THREAD (1/2)

What’s remarkable is that it manages to be sexist towards both men AND women (in different ways). Sexist toward men for the obvious fact that you’re forcing them into it and not women. Sexist toward women for insinuating that they can’t handle the same thing as men.
@Hunter_Bishop I don’t even really agree with that argument. Service should be a choice, not an obligation.
The way it’s set up is also very sexist.
So yeah probably my most libertarian view is that we should entirely abolish the draft. I’ve got some pretty anti-NSA views too. https://t.co/Ry2QQz3qwx
