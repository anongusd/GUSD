And ...Michelle Wolfe Is talented. Comedians make us laugh/think/uncomfortable- but at WHCD we shld make fun of ourselves, &amp;call it a night.
Women who use their government positions to spread lies and misinformation deserve to face the same withering criticism as men. But leave our looks out of it. Watching from home, I hurt for Sarah, her husband and her children.
The WHCD should be about honoring the best in journalism. Enough with the comedians, enough with the late-night parties. These are serious times for both the free press and the public they serve.
Watching a wife and mother be humiliated on national television for her looks is deplorable. I have experienced insults about my appearance from the president. All women have a duty to unite when these attacks happen and the WHCA owes Sarah an apology.

TRUMP Campaign exposed as lying and treating Americans as if they are too stupid to know what they saw. #plagiarism #obvious
Stunned that Trump surrogates are so dishonest they are defending plagiarism-The trump campaign owes Melania and the party a HUGE apology
Who was in charge of Melania Trump's speech. That person is responsible for plagiarizing Michelle Obama's speech. #lying #wearenotstupid
The Trump campaign thinks Americans are stupid. Someone failed Melania Trump and plagiarized. Campaign blaming media #ajoke
Plagiarism-the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas &amp; passing them off as one's own-That happened last night in Melania's speech
The Trump campaign actually thinks it can convince the public that there was no plagiarism.. #Wearenotstupid   #watchthetape #enough
Plagiarism is not the fault of Melania or the media -- it was the fault of the campaign. #Wearenotstupid

Learn to press the reset button.  Don't allow one bad moment to influence how you interact with people. #KnowYourValue
People pleasing is poison! Don't worry about making everyone around you feel comfortable. #KnowYourValue
Thanks for your questions! Now I am going to share some tips from my new book Grow Your Value out today! #KnowYourValue
@businessdiva @msnbc It is never too late to rebrand yourself. Your value is your life experience and wisdom--own it! #KnowYourValue
@KeirSimmons Hi and THANK YOU!! Encourage them to speak up and be assertive--aggressive is NOT a bad thing! #KnowYourValue
@stnickmedia I dont think there is a stigma--women supporting women is a good thing! #KnowYourValue
@NishaChittal Millennials should STOP trying to befriend their bosses!!!! #KnowYourValue
@karasstiles Millennials constantly have pos reinforcement &amp; think things happen quickly. Take time to establish yourself &amp; gain trust.
@karasstiles don't expect too much too soon. (1 of 2) #KnowYourValue
@2sunsky there is never an easy time to have kids--don't put it off trying to game this out.  (2 of 2) #KnowYourValue
@2sunsky There is no negative impact on your ability to do your job-it makes you better.  Don't put it off. (1 or 2) #KnowYourValue
@reed_riva Start a negotiation on the topic by saying they don't have enough women at the top and you should be one of them. And say WHY.
@MicheleMathis Distinguish between criticism that you should not take personally and BS that you should not put up with. #KnowYourValue
@TrettaBush There is value in being EXACTLY who you are. Every asset you have should be aligned with your message and will boost your value.
@_Julian_NYC Grow Your Value has an incredible chapter just on Millennial because they are certainly a special group.  #KnowYourValue
@LeighRoche8 Don't be afraid to ask for help in every facet of your life to make things work.  Do what is in front of you. #KnowYourValue
@jtodonnell You must know your market value and be ready to communicate it effectively to your employer. #KnowYourValue
@jtodonnell It starts with knowing your value before you can determine whether your employer truly values you. (2 of 2) #KnowYourValue
@jtodonnell Yes, but if you say you are going to walk away you have to be ready to take that step.  (1 of 2) #KnowYourValue
@MichaelBlaisure YOU ARE SO GREAT! Women need support systems--it is hard to do it all. Tell her to stop apologizing! #KnowYourValue
@InnesReport There is ALWAYS room to empower other women! Learn how to communicate your value first and others will follow. #KnowYourValue

.@milaubro However long it takes! I tried many, many times before I got my raise! #KnowYourValue
.@LiviaMarie4 Ask questions, find out what other people are paid, but since it's your first job, you'll be learning more than earning.
.@MetalFloss The answer is they do not. Women tend to think their hard work will be noticed--nothing is noticed, it needs to be pointed out.
RT @MetalFloss: @morningmika @msnbc I know my value. The question is, do others know it? #valuecreation
.@LareenStrong That's a choice that's very personal because if you don't have the ability to walk, you have less leverage. #KnowYourValue

.@NishaChittal Yes, &amp; that leaves lots of money on the table. In a negotiation, it has nothing to do with being likable, it's about respect.

RT @floridaPRpro: #KnowYourValue Is the 'lack of communicating value' really the root cause for unequal pay in the workplace?
.@Adebukola Absolutely, that's a real concern. Know the lay of the land, do your research. Do you have a backup plan? #ProtectYourself
