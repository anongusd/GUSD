On the 150 anniversary of the 14th Amendment, we must all remain vigilant in defending the basic principles of our country, and the protections of the 14th Amendment.
As a country, we must not allow our civil liberties to be rolled back. If freedom is taken away from one individual, it is taken away from us all.
150 years later, America faces a president who wishes to undo 150 years of progress; a president who has separated thousands of children from their parents and fails to reunite them; a president who is today announcing his pick for the next justice on the Supreme Court.
“No state may deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” 150 years ago today, the 14th Amendment of our Constitution was ratified.

Roe v. Wade. Equal rights. And now affirmative action. Donald Trump continues to attack our values day by day. It's vital we stop him from creating a permanent conservative majority on the Supreme Court. We cannot let him reverse equal representation protections for our students.
Donald Trump continues to mislead the American people -- first on North Korea and now with his threats toward NATO. The bullying must stop -- he's the president, and he should start acting like it.

Right now, Trump and his supporters are giving Americans a false choice -- this is not about enforcing immigration law. The Trump Administration created a policy that rips families apart for their own purposes. And now they’re lying about it.
We have to decide if we’re a country that tears children from their parents, or a country that welcomes immigrants like my family.
When I was on the Somerville Board of Aldermen, I wrote one of the first sanctuary city laws -- because it was the right thing to do to build a community where everyone is treated with respect.
Like most Americans, I am the descendant of immigrants. My grandfather arrived in this country from Italy when he was 18. My other grandfather was a first-generation American, whose parents immigrated from Ireland.
Today, the Trump administration is trying to make us forget that we are and have always been a nation of immigrants. Nothing that Donald Trump does or says can change that.
If @SecNielsen really cared about children's safety and well-being, she would work to stop family separation -- not make excuses for an inhumane policy that is tearing children from their parents.
