Please develop an ‚ÄúActive Shooter‚Äù	Evacuation Plan for your place of worship. Go over this plan with your staff just like you would a Fire Drill.
Tip from DPD Bomb Squad: When assessing an unattended items ask these basic questions: Who put it there? 	What is the package made of?	Where is the package located, is this an obvious location?	When was the package placed there?	ALL CAN BE DONE WITHOUT APPROACHING THE ITEM.
Tip from ATF: if a critical incident is happening inside of the church, get to safety before calling 911. Make sure to give basic information to 911: number of shooters, where they were last seen and a description of the shooter(s).
Tip: Key Control - Know who has access to your keys. Make keys with ‚ÄúDo Not Copy‚Äù written on them for your church staff.
If you are at Church, school or work always remember if you see something say something.

@fireGCCUSH to answer questionl Chief Craig has opened an internal investigation to ascertain the reasoning behind this decision and he will
@fireGCCUSH @gccush make every day. They would even sacrifice their life for yours so be easy with those blanket judgements.
@fireGCCUSH @gccush do you know any DPD officers? I doubt it otherwise I am sure you would know of the sacrifice these men and women
@fireGCCUSH @gccush why do you assume the DPD is corrupt? Why can't it be that one person made a mistake and not judge the whole department?
@NicolaHawatmeh very good question. That is why Chief Craig opened an internal investigation to find out why that supervisor let him go.
@DetroitRocks understood which is why he launched an internal investigation against the supervisor that let him go.
