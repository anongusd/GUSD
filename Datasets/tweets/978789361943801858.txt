Still, my group of fellow tweeters have agreed to be supportive of each others choices &amp; vote for the Democraric nominee.
@TheMMeltdown The same goes for The First Amendment, although admittedly it does not apply to hate speech or inciting comments.
@TheMMeltdown They care nothing about the life after birth.  They don't care whether the infant has food, clothing or shelter at any point in his or her life, and they care more about imprisoning them than educating them.

@SarahJKS77 @siano2020 The family of one of my best friends in high school and college owned a dairy farm.  I am so glad to hear about your environmental efforts.  The issue of beef and the environment is really new to me, and I am open to learning more from you.  We use a lot of dairy products.
@SarahJKS77 @siano2020 True.  I love steak and burgers.  I have just started being concerned about their carbon footprint.  I am always ready to learn.

I am confused about why you are on this thread? Personally, I have too many responsibilities to spend time on the tweets of people I cannot tolerate.

@cmclymer @xan_desanctis IMHO many people, such as Brett Kavanaugh, are not as much pro-life as anti-choice.  Justice Kavanaugh, while in a lower court, supported a court ruling requiring that three special needs women have abortions.  Unless eachperson is valued equally, the debate over abortion is moot
@cmclymer @xan_desanctis Thank you for mentioning pre-existing conditions.  I was advised by three perineonatologists to terminate my pregnancy due to an in-utero diagnosis of spina bifida myelomeningocele.  I chose ....  chose ... to bring Nicholas into the world.

@dstressdotcom @IlhanMN I know the history, the doctrines &amp; the people.

I will stand for the rights of Muslims, Jews, et. al.  Have a good day.
@dstressdotcom @IlhanMN Read of Thomas Aquinas who, in early Christian history, proposed a doctrine-Theism-which few believe &amp; led to the original meaning of atheism, Against Theism, solely to say Muslims don't worship the same God as Christians &amp; Jews. All Abrahamic religions, we worship the same God.
@filbertius @johnpavlovitz *blush*  Thank you.  So many loud, radicalized people are using Christianity to further their immoral agendas.  We have to stand with each other.

@dstressdotcom @IlhanMN The second is your assertion that most of the world has converted to Islam, which is not true; however, were it to be true, I can peacefully coexist with members of the world's other religions.  In fact, I already do.
@dstressdotcom @IlhanMN I'm going to approach your question from two angles.  The first is that you assume my becoming Muslim would be a negative thing.  I respect Muslims and their beliefs.  The vast majority are peaceful people who share similar values with other Abrahamic religions.
