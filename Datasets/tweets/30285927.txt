@Carol38553 @MonarrezBlanca @markbarnes19 @DLoesch She loves AOC and tears down successful women. She is not a Republican.
@Mayman10 Sure, Jan.
@Mayman10 The socialist college punk, having his way paid by mommy and daddy, has logged on. Real world experience lacking, he thinks he knows everything. Google is his substitute for real knowledge.
@Mayman10 @Golfin247 @AOC If they built their model that way, yes. You won’t believe that, because you think the government is your daddy. You think money grows on trees. You think life should be free.
@Mayman10 The volume of mail handled doesn’t mean shit. The way a business is run does. UPS managed their business, and they had revenues of $67 Billion. The USPS is poorly run, and it lost over a $Billion. Government does nothing efficiently. I asked for 1 good example. You lose.
@Mayman10 @Golfin247 @AOC Ah, the ol’ liberal comeback - I’m uneducated. I’m not, but that’s irrelevant. Any model losing $1.7 Billion a year is a failure. Unions, poor labor mgmt, no oversight, &amp; poor cost tracking contributed. You possess a lack of reality that’s beyond comprehension.
Post office lost $1.7 Billion in 2017. This genius calls that a success. He wants socialism. Is anyone surprised? https://t.co/8rA8HmyMtS
@Mayman10 @Golfin247 @AOC UPS isn’t losing money. FedEx isn’t losing money. Amazon isn’t losing money. Your apologist position isn’t doing you any favors. You’re socialist? Socialism is a losing game, unless you’re one of the people unwilling to work, yet still getting paid under the NGD.
@willqrop2 @cjstats02 @BStapleG @rachelajohns @AOC Apparently, they do, looking at employment rolls. You’re not very good at this.
@Mayman10 @Golfin247 @AOC The Post Office lost $2.7 Billion in fiscal year 2017. Only a liberal would call that a success.
Indeed. Dicks of a feather hang together. https://t.co/QWLzndrdVm

@gil_joy5 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Voluntarily subjecting one’s kid to the environment surrounding illegally crossing a border with an organized group like this one doesn’t say much for the parents.
@AG_Conservative Maybe he thinks rushing the border is like a game of Red Rover.
@URBANWONKENOBI @Ocasio2018 You are amazingly gross.
@swpz_reaper @RantyAmyCurtis There’s really nothing left to say here except your hyperbole makes you look like an idiot. I’m going to do you a favor and mute you vs blocking. You obviously need some educating. #Buhbye
@swpz_reaper @RantyAmyCurtis You don’t know shit about me - what I do, the charities to which I donate, both time and money. I believe in giving back; I do not believe in enslaving someone else’s labor. I’ve been quite clear, not in the least “abstract”. Die on this fictional hill if you like. I don’t care.
@swpz_reaper @RantyAmyCurtis Nobody has a right to free health care. Period. Someone somewhere is paying for it, whether it’s though taxes for govt programs, etc. No govt has the obligation to save every citizen from individual health issues. That’s not govt’s job. 	Get over your victimhood. It’s unbecoming.
@westernlvr My brother got my mom’s birds when she passed. They’re African ring necks, and they love to destroy stuff. Cannot imagine giving them something that easy to tear apart! He must have loved it!
@swpz_reaper @RantyAmyCurtis Calm your freebie arse down. I don’t expect anyone to work for free. If you do, that’s a great socialist model, but not how we do things here. Not yet, anyway. There are multiple avenues to get funding. This person has probably already found them. Free health care is not a right.
@swpz_reaper @RantyAmyCurtis 1) Learn what ironic really means.	2) The cost of a transplant and the extended care are pretty high. Do you work for free?? Didn’t think so.
@URBANWONKENOBI @Ocasio2018 What are you, 6? Trump degree? You’re so much better off that I? Whatever, little boy. This is Twitter, not a contest. I hope you do think your life is great. I know mine is. Now, go find your mommy. 🙄

Just keep @Acosta out of the press pool. He’s unprofessional, immature, and basically a pain in the ass. Trump may be all those things, too, but he’s in charge. What did Obama say? Oh, yeah. Deal with it. https://t.co/VA7bGD7hEw
@DMRDynamics @Acosta What a joke. Most of the press is probably rejoicing he’s out of there. He’s a petulant, whiny baby with no idea of how to adult.
Wow. https://t.co/cVHRyOGAsW
@GOPChairwoman @obriensarahj01 @realDonaldTrump I would argue that neither President created jobs, but Trump has created the environment to allow that creation to happen.
@cottage_orchard @MzCohen @Acosta Did you just say you wish Trump dies? Is that really what you just said?
This is a tweet from a “journalist”, not a session entry from a shrink. And Acosta wonders why he isn’t taken seriously. https://t.co/dKgLN6h5hR
@PhilipRucker @Acosta @PeterAlexander @AprilDRyan If so-called journalists didn’t act as immature as Trump, forgetting their role is to report the news vs be the news, you might have a better reputation. Instead, what Trump says about you ends up making sense.

@JoeTalkShow @tedcruz The race was far closer than I expected, even with the press’s Beto Show® in full force. That so many Texans could be either fooled by Beto’s act of be in favor of his economy killing policies boggles the mind.

This is a real tweet. https://t.co/zZj0WwdYFz
@JoeTalkShow @tedcruz When Beto is on every lib news program and has most of them fawning over his skateboard skills, we’ve lost a good deal of reason among voters. You may as well be holding the debates and all political discussions on the Kardashian channel.

@NeverTrumpTexan @BetoORourke What you seem too dense to understand is how Obama’s crazy regulation &amp; other shit policies held back production that is now leading the world. Business succeeded in spite of him, and now it’s on fire. Don’t worry, cupcake. There are others to do the thinking for you.
@Duvisited @brianstelter @JamesFallows If the country is being destroyed, why are so many people trying to get in?
@ddale8 It’s quite entertaining when you slam Trump for having Fox commentators (not reporters) support him, then you tweetstorm how bad Trump is, how he lies about everything, how he’s such a bad guy - and call yourself a reporter. You just can’t make this stuff up. 😂
Poor @brianstelter keeps getting pwned... https://t.co/KpUhJi4BzP
@NeverTrumpTexan @BetoORourke Since I’m in the industry, it doesn’t get more serious. Obama tried to stop fracking. Held up the Keystone pipeline. Stopped drilling in the Gulf while paying Brazil to drill. Paid $millions to alternative energy buddies, and they failed. Burying your head doesn’t change facts.

@Trey_xc @dbongino Breaking campaign fund laws should be bad for anyone. Democrats just apply the law as they see fit.
@inminivanhell @dbongino Because church funds and campaign funds are covered by different laws. It’s not about your feelings; it’s about the law. This isn’t hard.
@flyersjunkie @harrylegend33 @JamesRussell88 @MortsSources @DeaqonJames @ToNoAbsolutes @xraytechtrader @dbongino I get it. Beto is a Dem, therefore the laws don’t apply to him, right?  Pretty sure this falls under personal use of campaign funds, which is illegal.
@ananavarro @AndrewGillum If you were really a Republican, you couldn’t vote for Gillum based on what he stands for. For once, be honest, and admit you’re not even close to a Republican.

@SPeitsch I know exactly who was shot. Do you have a point, or are you still seeking attention?
@ChicagoBeerSnob @BklynMichael42 @zwilliams0 @DonCheadle No, it shouldn’t fit ANY talking point. It’s a liberal, feel-good, hate the GOP meme. It’s based on assumption, and it’s about keeping score. Hopefully, you’re better than that.
@OhYouGoAwween @DonCheadle Wow. You’re so clever.
@bbramble1957 Is this how you really talk? This is creepy.
@bbramble1957 @DonCheadle I’m usually a pretty happy gal, thanks! Doesn’t mean my heart doesn’t hurt for those who’ve lost someone or have tragedy in their family. Your hate is oozing in your tweets. #BeBetter
@wbishop_3 @DonCheadle Show me someone in this thread who does want to hurt someone. That’s a silly statement to make.
@bbramble1957 You have no idea what degrees I have, so you’ve already made an ignorant statement. Not exactly sure what beats what, but it’s going to be based on opinion, not fact. The rest of your tweets are garbage filler. Do better.
@ChicagoBeerSnob @BklynMichael42 @zwilliams0 @DonCheadle It’s BS made up to validate political ignorance like yours. That’s all it is. Go back to your echo chamber safe space.
@BklynMichael42 @ChicagoBeerSnob @zwilliams0 @DonCheadle Already answered this. It’s based on assumption and implies politics are responsible. I don’t find that to be true.
@bbramble1957 You aren’t very good at this.
@SPeitsch You really aren’t very good at this. The criminal acts at hand were spurred by hate, not by politics or any politician. Keeping score is as sickening as blaming someone else for a crime they didn’t commit.
@bbramble1957 You didn’t? Sorry about that. Not everyone has the privilege, I guess.
@ChicagoBeerSnob @BklynMichael42 @zwilliams0 @DonCheadle Your little pie chart seems to make a lot of assumptions. Like I said, I condemn all of the violence. You just want to keep score. Politics have little to nothing to do with those atrocities. They’re based on hate, which you want to perpetuate.
@bbramble1957 @DonCheadle I watched the Houston rally the other night and found it fairly entertaining. I’m no Trump fan, but I’m not triggered to hell and back like you seem to be. Pretty happy about that.
@pragmaticNYC @DonCheadle Ah, OK. I’ll start with Maxine Waters, and the list is quite long. I could post video of all the Dem activist attacks, (like that guy roundhouse kicking a female prolifer), but none of us has all day.

@theRubyRoad @alexbachrach @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle I’m not afraid to use anything. I post my picture all the time in my tweets. My dog just got a great update on his lung disease, so I posted his pic. I’ve been doxxed, had people call my job, &amp; other cowardly acts. I’m not the coward, pumpkin. Try again.
@MyNameIsPaulB @ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle @FoxNews “You people”. White people? Women? Dog owners? Texans? Which group, exactly??
@BklynMichael42 @zwilliams0 @ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle Some don’t merit responses at all, say for example - memes.
@ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle I’m against banning of almost anything. I’m actually a Constitutionalist, all about freedom and shit.
@SPeitsch @DonCheadle Nope. I do a good job of talking the regular way. If you’d like to discuss my ass, go ahead.
@BklynMichael42 @ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle Memes in general distort or take things out of context. Either state your point, or move on.
@kimd42542 @DonCheadle So much that you had to respond to it twice. OK.
@alexbachrach @theRubyRoad @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle Your opinion is noted and will be given the amount of attention it deserves.
@alexbachrach @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle I’ll do my best. Dumbing tings down is not usually my thing. I can try to make an exception.
@MyNameIsPaulB @ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle @FoxNews Oooooohhh.... A liberal group that labels conservative or right-leaning group as hate groups. Got it. 😉

@ericacarr6 @DonCheadle I actually sent a get well card to his office, cupcake. What did you do??
@SPeitsch @DonCheadle 1) Not a dude. 2) No idea where you got that string of nonsense, but hey, you do you. 😂
@Liel9999 @DonCheadle Nah, I’m good.
@bbramble1957 @DonCheadle Oh, I’ve had enough school, thanks. What’s lacking here is any common sense or modicum of decency among the liberals in this thread. There is an over abundance of “I hate the GOP”, though. Medically troublesome abundance. Also, learn how to use commas.
@WordsWithJoe @NeverTrumpTexan It’s clear that one issue had nothing to do with the other. If Mr. Triggered wants to bring up crimes committed by illegals, different topic, but there are plenty of examples. Clear enough for you?
@theRubyRoad @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle I’m still not clear on just which people I personally handed a gun. You keep leaving that out:
@ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle Are you out on a day pass or something? Good lawd.
@pragmaticNYC @DonCheadle What does that even mean??
@alexbachrach @DonCheadle Hmm.. Since none of those groups include me, I’m not seeing the point. But keep on keeping score with psychotic criminals. That makes sense. 🙄
@kimd42542 @DonCheadle Yeah, nice try. 😂
@alexbachrach @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle Do I need to use smaller words for you? I can’t use crayons on Twitter.
@alexbachrach @theRubyRoad @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle I do support the NRA, and your description of the organization is incorrect. They’ve done a lot to put legislation is place to make the world safer. Your politics cloud your judgment.
@wbishop_3 @DonCheadle I see all of it as deplorable, condemning it from both sides. You and Don want to keep score. Pretty sick, really.
@UKrazyFan If that’s what you think, you’re crazier than the bomber.
@zwilliams0 @ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle Guess you can’t see very well.
@ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle LOL Yes, I’m well aware of your “source”.
@theRubyRoad @jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle Exactly to whom did I give access to guns, pumpkin?
@kimd42542 @DonCheadle Yes, your grasp on reality has completely slipped, and it is sad. Bet you loved Kanye before he went to the WH. Tells me all I need to know about your emotional intelligence &amp; maturity.
@WordsWithJoe @NeverTrumpTexan Nope.
@Liel9999 @DonCheadle I don’t buy i to liberal blame games. You’ll have to find another outlet for your warped, enabling behaviors.
@ChicagoBeerSnob @DonCheadle Oh, goody! A liberal meme made with absolutely no facts! Thanks for making my point that Dems try to find political points with criminal acts. You played into that quite nicely.
@doeroftheword2 @DonCheadle Comprehension isn’t your strong out, eh, pumpkin?
@DonCheadle Why don’t you ask a boy or troll? How pathetic.
@buffsblg @DonCheadle Try and find it, liar. Your pathetic attempts to blame an entire party for a criminal act defines you.
@gritmonger @DonCheadle Your profile says you stand with Antifa. You are violence personified. Credibility of zero.
@micky_h76 @DonCheadle Say buhbye, troll.
@jjstrauss75 @DonCheadle Keep blaming Trump for psychotic killers, throwing accountability to the wind. If you really want to place blame, I look at the enablers on the left, consistently giving the perpetrator an out. Your TDS is out of control.

@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter Yeah, you keep doing your little tribal self. Bless your heart.
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter I supported Kavanaugh, so take your sanctimonious attitude elsewhere. You had zero to do with his seat on SCOTUS.
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter If that’s your history, you should like Sasse for standing up for what he believes and not toeing the party line. Same reason I like Rand Paul. If you don’t, fine. Just don’t fall back on the tribalistic slinging of “RINO”.
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter It’s not stupid; it’s just varying degrees of tribalism. Just don’t say it doesn’t exist on the right or call it “code”. It happens on both sides.
@michaelcmaronna @pjb438 Get some original material, pumpkin. 	The 1st amendment applies to everyone equally. You trying to apply it in varying degrees based on people you don’t like shows me you really aren’t very good at this.
@JoeTalkShow @DineshDSouza @Debber66 I miss you on Houston morning radio. Podcast is the next best thing. 💛
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter No. Fighting tribalism is trying to get you out of your sheep-like group think, hoping you’ll actually think for yourself and not vote based on color, region, or even what a Republican might say. Trump has several lib ideas. He’s not solid conservative.
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter Your assumption game is weak. Try again, pumpkin.

Hey, @ricasoli99! I think we’re doing Puglia in May! Another chance to finally meet!
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter There is just as much tribalism on the right. (See the “Trump does no wrong” crowd.) And we were talking about Sasse. Since when does he want single payer? You’re not very good at this.
@michaelcmaronna @pjb438 Awesome. Now do Maxine Waters.
@deplorable2015 @KurtSchlichter You obviously haven’t even looked at Sasse’s voting record. So you hate the guy, because he doesn’t slobber over Trump. Zero reason to label him a RINO. Your ignorance of the tribalism on both sides is also noted. 🙄

@WyomIndependent @MichaelAvenatti @GOP @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @BobCorker @lisamurkowski Based on hearsay from an ambulance chaser trying to cash in on a porn star? The rest of us will honor American values and the Constitution, and we’ll give Kavanaugh his right to due process. Lying harpies with political agendas creating kangaroo courts don’t fly here:
@matetro @MichaelAvenatti By all means, slander someone you don’t know for reasons you’ve made up in your head. Good lord.
@Spaces @lacheraqui @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley @SenateGOP Once again, you do realize he is being tried by the Twitterazi without evidence. That you’re a part of this should have you evaluating why you are so easily swayed and led by your emotions vs facts.
@politicangst @TheOrangeDevil @Top_Sergeant @MichaelAvenatti @Marion_aruaL @ChuckGrassley @SenateGOP I’m encouraged to hear at least one person in your family has the common sense to wait until the facts come out before rushing to judgment. Kudos to your dad.
@csd @MichaelAvenatti Based on what evidence?? Avenatti is trying him on Twitter. This is how you want our legal system handled? God help you.
@TXStarLite @MichaelAvenatti @rvrrunnr01 @cherokeesher2 @FreddyRoo2 Where does ANYTHING say he raped anyone, much less “many others”? You’re a loon.
@katb1107 Good luck with that one! 😂
@Angelatida Get out of traffic!!! 😂😂😂😂
@CrowSwezey @DLoesch This idiot is the reason teenagers piss most people off.
@calvinstowell @DLoesch If you knew even one iota about Dana, you’d know “scared” isn’t in her vacabulary. Plenty of folks far more clever than your lame arse have tried to intimidate her, and it has never worked. She gets death threats, threats against her kids, has had to move, and STILL stands tall.
Please cite what is illegal about this mailer. This mailer that took 1.5 seconds to recognize as political mail, @katb1107. https://t.co/njPbuyjos8
Wait... it’s OK if Beto doesn’t remember everything that happened while very drunk 22 years ago? Does this apology to Kavanaugh’s accuser? Her memory may be flawed??? https://t.co/HHmYaAIhe3

@LazyCircles @SenTedCruz Oh, I’m about as informed as they get, cupcake. What I’m not is starry-eyed over a skateboarding Socialist, a Congressman who voted to end my freedoms, or who wants to Californize my Texas.
This precious, delicate flower doesn’t like guns. If you think gun ownership is a right, he doesn’t like you. If you own a gun, he doesn’t like you, either. He also doesn’t like Dana. There’s a lot of hate in his world. Maybe Jazz needs a Snickers. https://t.co/vsstKUXEcd
Somebody really needs to be looking out for these fools. Good lord. https://t.co/lGFs9hCmLb
@LazyCircles @SenTedCruz Medical prices have skyrocketed due to Obamacare. It was designed that way. It’s working exactly as planned, made to force us into socialized medicine.	The deficits may be growing even faster than the records set by Obama. Trump isn’t GOP, so it’s not surprising. I’m for cuts.
This actually made me laugh out loud! If lowering taxes, getting rid of crippling, useless regulation, and creating  an amazing environment for job growth is pandering to Christians and small-minded, I’ll take it. 	There’s no way to say Texas isn’t succeeding. 	#TXSenateDebate https://t.co/vxhxuI2tQm
I agree. #Beto has pulled every emotion-based ploy he can in the #TXSenateDebate. He has no plan to keep Texas a solid business magnet, no plan to help lower medical costs. No plans expect to make Texas California 2.0.		No, thanks. I’ll take the #Freedom candidate - Ted Cruz. https://t.co/b5flNx7ap6
Typical liberal view - All hat, no cattle.	Texans want a Senator  who will keep their word. @SenTedCruz has voted to lower taxes, ease crazy regulation, and has created an amazing environment for record job growth. 	Keep your Kennedy wannabe. I’ll take substance. #TXSenateDebate https://t.co/DvONK5goZS
@JennieH05347891 @TheView @Janefonda You value the opinion of someone who took the enemy’s side in Vietnam, yet you’re questioning looking at Trump from a viewpoint other than Trump Derangement®?		Bless your heart.

@RepRepublic @OfficialJLD Nah, it’s just about aligning yourself with those who share the same hatred. Facts don’t matter. Truth doesn’t matter. Squashing anything remotely associated with Trump is key.
@OfficialJLD When you believe vague accusations simply because they are made by a woman against someone you hate due to your politics, you have shown the most basic lack of humanity.	Congratulations on reaching new levels of pathetic, Jules.

This is the idiocy that is Democrats.	A lot of Dems said to pass on Garland as well. 	No one has rushed this nomination. You’ve created a circus to stall it.	The nominee is accused of a lot of things. You libs have quite the imagination.	The nominee should be confirmed. Now. https://t.co/GouH2su09O
@ZeroJour @SenatorDurbin No one is talking about Sotomayor. Focus.
@SenatorDurbin Your disregard for Jaunita Broadrick is somewhat glaring with your razor-like focus on a drunk memory of a feminist, Trump-hating, women’s marching, parents’ foreclosure vendetta-ing, lib activist hack with an ax to grind. But, hey... use what ya got, right?
@AltCyberCommand Don’t be sorry; be accurate. SCOTUS nominees are not subject to some random standard you invent. They should be confirmed on their merits, their understanding of the Constitution, and their demonstrated regard for law. This circus has zero to do with any of that. Liberal games.
@ZachDow4 @StevenDevenpor2 @SemperLibertas @FeatherandNail @anasmithfreedom @RealJamesWoods This is not true. The actual numbers may be lower, but the percentage is not. Your premise has been proven false by multiple posts with statistics. 		And looking at big picture, why exactly is the number of crimes by illegals OK with you? Even “equal” should not be OK.
@1975jetsfan4 That you have anyone, anywhere, tweeting they “stand in solidarity” with anyone before hearing any testimony shows you how far off the rails these people have gone.
@1975jetsfan4 I think this is a desperate attempt to keep him from being confirmed. The absurdity of it all is astounding.
Exactly. https://t.co/io2ITI2ydc
Oh, good god. https://t.co/v07gXLVKDg
@AngelaBelcamino Why, exactly? Because she’s a woman, we’re supposed to believe her story? When she doesn’t remember where, or how many drinks she had, or because her parents’ foreclosure was confirmed by his mom, the presiding judge at the time?  	You are plain, fucking scary, the way you think.

@kikibrew @JimsExwife @DLoesch @Nicoxw1 No one said it’s anyone’s responsibility to have a gun in their home. Having one definitely changes the odds when someone with a gun enters your home.

Last time I checked, Dana had over 500% more followers on Twitter than you.

Don’t think she’s looking for money. https://t.co/Zuck2mQ6fc
@Montel_Williams @GregGriffin7 @DLoesch No, Payday Loan huckster, she isn’t. The abuse she has thrown at her daily, usually by cowards like you, would make most men cower and retreat.

@BoogieShmooo @DLoesch @shannonrwatts You do realize that Dana supports the shooting victim in this scenario, right? I’d hate to think you’re just a blind sheep attacking for no other reason than someone else telling you what to think.
