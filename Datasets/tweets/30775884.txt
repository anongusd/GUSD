9- What messages do you send to your partner? If you don‚Äôt know, are unwilling to make the time, or frankly, simply can‚Äôt be bothered... then WHY continue the relationship? Your answers just might give you the clue you need.
8- mind such as viewing naked bodies or actually following through with emotional or physical betrayal of your partner? While you may have rationalized and moved on, your partner and partnership may be forever destroyed .
7- yourself right back where you started, countless times now? Or are you on a roller coaster that leaves you again where you started but feeling worse than ever? 	Or are you still looking outside your relationship for your thrills whether seen as small and insignificant in your
6- So how do you address the underlying issues that have created the stale stalemate? 	Have you or your partner initiated these difficult discussions? Which partner? How often? How did it go? What has happened, since? Are you on a ferris wheel where you go in circles and find
5- Mental relationship will determine the physical relationship. If you have a physical relationship in a union that placed no value on the mental relationship, you can only address the physical. There IS NO mental relationship on which to build.
4-unquestioned trust, and true love. If not? You‚Äôre probably in a relationship that exists solely on maintenance of the lowest level with no real satisfaction, trust, nor true love. 	A RELATIONSHIP does not exist when only one partner is making the effort.
3-years later still in a mutually unsatisfactory relationship, you should ask yourself, have I actually made a serious effort or have I just existed? If you HAD made a continuous habit of investing in your relationship, you would have an exponentially stronger faith in each other
2- Some would say it is the ONLY reason. 	When one is NOT willing to make the effort, when one would rather ignore or avoid discussion, your decision/desire is clear: YOU DO NOT CONSIDER YOUR RELATIONSHIP WORTH THE EFFORT.  If you find yourself

@JaysonHLynch1 Whete‚Äôs the interpreter?
@JaysonHLynch1 @Davidthagnome @jordanndavis @JStein_WaPo @AOC You mean like our president?
5/18/18 Putin signed decrees on composition of new Government. 5/25/18 Putin announced he would not run for president in 2024, justifying this in compliance with the Russian Constitution. 6/14/18 Putin opened the 21st FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia for the first time
Putin won 2018 presidential election with more than 76% of the vote. 4th term began 5/7/18;same day, Putin invited Dmitry Medvedev to form new government. 5/25/18 Putin took part in opening of movement along highway section of Crimean bridge.
Jan 2017 US intelligence community assessment expressed "high confidence" that Putin personally ordered an "influence campaign" to denigrate Hillary Clinton &amp; to harm her electoral chances and potential presidency. Putin consistently denies any Russian interference in US election
Putin ordered the withdrawal of the "main part" of the Russian forces from Syria; Russian forces deployed in Syria continued to actively operate in support of the Syrian government.
9/30/15 Putin authorized Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, following a formal request by the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups. 3/14/16 Putin: mission set for Russian military in Syria had been "largely accomplished".
Members of international community assumed Putin's annexation initiated new kind of Russian foreign policy taking annexation to mean that his foreign policy had shifted "from state-driven foreign policy" to taking an offensive stance to re-create the Soviet Union.
Oct 2015 Washington Post reports Russia redeployed some elite units from Ukraine to Syria in recent weeks to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Dec 2015 Russian Federation President Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine.
Members of international community&amp; organizations like Amnesty International condemned Russia for its actions in post-revolutionary Ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law &amp; violating Ukrainian sovereignty. Many countries implemented economic sanctions against Russia
2014Russia made military incursions into Ukrainian territory. After Euromaidan protests &amp; fall of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, Russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions &amp;infrastructure within the Ukrainian territory of Crimea &amp;annexed Crimea
Jun 2013 Putin attended televised rally of All-Russia People's Front where he was elected head of the movement, which was set up in 2011. Journalist Steve Rosenberg: the movement is intended to "reconnect the Kremlin to the Russian people" &amp; one day, if necessary, replace the UR.
2012/2013 Putin &amp; UR party backed stricter legislation against LGBT community; Putin asked critics to note law was "ban on the propaganda of pedophilia &amp; homosexuality"; denied there was any "professional, career or social discrimination" against homosexuals in Russia.
1st day as president Putin issued 14 Presidential decrees called the "May Decrees" by the media including one stating wide-ranging goals for Russian economy &amp; decrees concerning education, housing, skilled labor training, relations w EU, defense industry, inter-ethnic relations+
Counter-protest of Putin supporters occurred culminated in gathering an estimated 130,000 supporters at the Luzhniki Stadium. Some attendees stated they had been paid to come, were forced to come by their employers, or were misled that they were going to attend a folk festival.
Anti-Putin protests took place during/after the presidential campaign including Pussy Riot performance Feb 21 &amp; subsequent trial. Estimated 8,000‚Äì20,000 protesters gathered in Moscow May 6 when 80 people injured in confrontations with police, 450 arrested; &amp; 120 arrests next day.
3/4/12 Putin won the 2012 Russian presidential elections in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of vote-rigging. Opposition groups accused Putin &amp; United Russia of fraud. The vote was criticized by Russian opposition &amp; international observers.
9/24/11 @ United Russia party congress, Medvedev recommended party nominate Putin as presidential candidate &amp; revealed the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow Putin to run for president/2012. This was termed by many in media as "Rokirovka" term for the chess move "castling".
After parliamentary elections 12/4/11 thousands of Russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin's time. Protesters criticized Putin &amp; United Russia demanding annulment of election results. Fear of revolution in society sparked.
Putin was barred from 3rd consecutive term by Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was elected his successor. In a power-switching operation on 5/8/08 ONE day after handing presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed Prime Minister of Russia.
10/7/06 Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist exposing corruption in Russian army &amp; its conduct in Chechnya, on Putin's birthday. The death of Politkovskaya triggered international criticism, with accusations that Putin has failed to protect the country's new independent media.
Continued criminal prosecution of Russia's then richest man, President of Yukos oil and gas company Mikhail Khodorkovsky, for fraud &amp; tax evasion was seen by international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin.
Putin started reconstruction of impoverished condition of the country, winning a power-struggle with Russian oligarchs, a 'grand bargain' with them allowing oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for &amp; alignment with Putin's government.
First major challenge to Putin's popularity came in Aug 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the Kursk submarine disaster. That criticism was largely because it was several days before Putin returned from vacation &amp; several more before he visited the scene.
The first Presidential Decree that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled "On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family". This ensured that "corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives" would not be pursued.
@MaddowBlog The first Presidential Decree that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled "On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family". This ensured that "corruption charges against the outgoing President and his relatives" would not be pursued.

Thousands of variables have impact &amp; someone is looking to verify their suppositions. They can postulate all they want but should say we may be 100% WRONG
@DrLeeKeyes @googlenews No mention of porn. Stupid study. I found that if a couple was HAPPY with each other AND RESPECT ONE ANOTHER then they DON‚ÄôT FUCK AROUND. Take away the RESPECT? Fucking around will happen because FACE IT- men are horn dogs and will fuck anything they can whenever they can.

@silvermist_art @heartbodysouI @pootietanggg_ @persianthoughtz Maybe your local Bass Pro Shop has a stuffed one; the one in Orlando does
That‚Äôs some reach! But the person as you see did exactly the right thing to make himself no threat https://t.co/ccGo2P47cW

@SaysHummingbird @LexAlexander As a Russian agent, he is in the catbird seat
@LexAlexander Howard Schultz needs to get a damn clue. Go away, Howard. We do not want YOU.
@LexAlexander Let the stupid remain stupid. Sadly, I have learned there‚Äôs no fixing stupid.
@JuddLegum From article: But not everyone was bailed out. In 2008, 861,664 families lost their homes to foreclosure, and there were more than 3 million total foreclosure filings. Overall, there were "7.8 million foreclosures...during the 10 years between 2007 &amp; 2016."
@JuddLegum From article: One of the chief architects of the bailout that saved people like Griffin but left ordinary Americans out in the cold was former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.	Where is Bernanke now?	He works for Griffin at Citadel
@JuddLegum Alan Kruger should be in jail for his asinine decision to not help home buyers. His reasoning is faulty. But hey, bail out the corporations that RUINED THE ECONOMY?!? WHEN WILL WE THE PEOPLE, THOSE MAKING LESS THAN $110,000/yr, GET THEIRS?!?!!
This. Will. Make. You. Ill. Sick. Disgusted. And stark raving mad. 2008. George W. Bush was in his last year as president. And secret deals bailed out the disgustingly rich who should be in jail for what they did. Read this thread. https://t.co/iZ3R15LYiW
Btw... EVERYONE SHOULD READ JUDD LEGUM. Although the details he is able to reveal about our government, politicians, and banking will make you ill. Get his newsletter. Then get ready to fix what is terribly wrong with our system. https://t.co/fQlRZVnSW2
RT @GetWisdomDude: @JohnBrennan #trumpResign ?	45 Won‚Äôt.		But That‚Äôs Ok.	America Has Earned	The Right To See The	Marshals Perp Walk Him. ht‚Ä¶

@sbryt @StehlarTerry @DenbrotS @sahluwal Read the other answers. When dealing with dementia, there‚Äôs little to no recall. You could explain 100 times and it would all be a waste of time.
@beckyfyfe @DenbrotS @sahluwal Agreed
@DenbrotS @sahluwal Agreed. The head motion. The automatic ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù for the ‚ÄúGod Bless You‚Äù - out of character with the rest of it. She doesn‚Äôt even know what she‚Äôs saying. I said dementia as she looked the same look mother had when agitated.
@sahluwal @Don_Miele Honey, pay her no mind. I can tell you she is is suffering from dementia. One of the signs is losing your ‚Äúfilters‚Äù. You end up saying rude things almost like a child that doesn‚Äôt know any better. I see it in her eyes.... just like mother started.
@jbakerwebb @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Are you serious?!?! Or delusional
@cubanblast @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump You forgot one thing. A pathetic lying asshole of a president
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt bring god into that picture, I don‚Äôt! Ummm, ya bum, YOU don‚Äôt bring god into anything. Except schools now? Get a clue
@realDonaldTrump What in holy hell would you know about the Bible, TWO Corinthians?
