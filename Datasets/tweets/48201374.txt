@Alyssa_Milano 6. Trump's family history does not equate to his life. Are U everything ur Father believed &amp; said? His history is filled with many examples (if you bothered to look) of altruism, anti-racism (he's been given a few awards for it) and caring 4 ppl of all races &amp; gender.
@Alyssa_Milano 5. Declaring a Red MAGA hat is in any way equal 2 the KKK's terror &amp; murder is irresponsible &amp; stupid. Dems like U comparing the Horrors of the KKK or worse Nazi's &amp; the Millions tortured &amp; murdered is ludicrous in the extreme &amp; a perfect example of how far down crazy road U R.
@Alyssa_Milano 4. UR holier than thou view does not meet any meter of UR past or any recent dem actions. UR radicalized mindset has made u both blind &amp; soulless to anything but HATE of Trump/GOP. The Hat says MAGA. The divisiveness comes fro U &amp; Dems demanding we all think &amp; act like Ur party.
@Alyssa_Milano 3. And Ignoring everything that doesn't meet ur crazy view of Trump &amp; his supporters. Even NOW while pretending to support "reproductive rights" &amp; feel sorrow for Young Children at the border Ur party is supporting &amp; endorsing the murder of 50+ Million babies up to 9 mon/BIRTH!!
@Alyssa_Milano 2. I'll also remind U Democrats were calling for "resist" and rioting, Antifa hate attacks and ambushing and KILLING cops in the Name of Black lives matter. Did those kids wearing "Red Hats" beat up or attack the Indian chief? U called for it against them. U R projecting U hate.
@Alyssa_Milano 1. Can't fix this kind of stupid. Immigrants seeking legal entry have been accepted for 200+ years. Banning Muslims? He banned 7 of 50 countries R U saying the other 43 R NOT really Muslims? since U like history Dems started the KKK &amp; used them to terrorize blacks for decades.
