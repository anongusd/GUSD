"I don't know if we can expect 16 cars at the race track," says Scott Miller to the same degree as they do first and second re: going over the Playoff cars following the 26th race of the season #NASCAR
"We're in show business," says Scott Miller. "Fans like burnouts...let's just say at the very least that there are habitual offenders on this..." #NASCAR
The hammer done dropped... https://t.co/35K7JdOSvN
"I know one of the  guys who was disqualified for an @NASCAR_Xfinity race," says @JeffBurton (tongue in cheek) who is in the room. "He never did that $hit again." #NASCAR
Congratulations! https://t.co/faSu9AUhGa
"We're not planning on suspensions right now," Miller said. "If you're disqualified twice, I don't think suspension (will be the crew person's biggest concern)," adds @odsteve #NASCAR
"The engines, because of the nature of some of things we have done for efficiencies...the engines pose somewhat of an issue...They will be inspected at the R&amp;D Center on Wednesday," Miller says...and penalties could arise if something is discovered beyond the track #NASCAR
"There will be a 20-minute hold where the teams can protest," says Mike Forde #NASCAR
"All the owners and all of the teams are tired of this," Miller adds ...@odsteve says this will fall in Jay Fabian's hands #NASCAR "We will take a random car back for the sole purpose of seeing if there's anything we're missing," adds O'Donnell.
This is for all three series...can I get a Hell yeah? #NASCAR
To clarify--anything with a major (Level 3) violation... @odsteve says to expect a 90-minute process after the track. "You will know who the winner is on Sunday night."
Post-race inspection-- "Going forward, post-race inspection will take place at the track," says @odsteve "The first place car if there is any penalty will be disqualified."
The 2019 inspection protocol #nascar https://t.co/ie3RQIJp0X
"Inspection will be open all the time," says Miller...not just during official inspection times #NASCAR  "We have to stop all this, we tried to do it a little softer and it didn't work. We're going to try a different approach."
"It's going to be worse this year," Miller replies to Claire when  asked about putting the hammer down last year in inspection #NASCAR
There will be a dedicated group of inspectors that stay in each garage.. "We have to eliminate this cat and mouse game," says Miller #NASCAR
There will also be a technical lead--who will be attached to the hip of the series directors, Miller adds #NASCAR
"You'll notice a different model in the garage with the series directors and the assistant series directors," says Scott Miller. Says the assistants will worry more with logistics. Jay Fabian's assistant will be the affable @KipChildress
"We're not going to stick our heads in the sand, we're going to adjust as necessary," Miller adds he doesn't expect bump drafting #NASCAR
"Yes, yes we are," says Scott Miller when asked if he anticipates drafting during qualifying...five minute breaks between each round now #NASCAR
This was a fabulous interview if you missed it...She might have lost her voice but she hasn't lost her sense of humor! https://t.co/tP8DOHXtE8
.@odsteve says #NASCAR wants to follow the @NBA 's model of international expansion...says @iRacing helps. Sees China as a key area. "The goal is to expand on what we've created here in the United States," adds @BenKennedy33
"The international series will go to nine different venues this year," says @BenKennedy33 adding Czech Republic to the list #NASCAR
