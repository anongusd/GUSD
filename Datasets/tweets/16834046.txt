Breaking the idea of young men‚Äôs roles as ‚Äúbreadwinners‚Äù and ‚Äúfighters‚Äù is fundamental to prevent school dropout and open pathways for positive development.
CARE‚Äôs data on #migration shows that boys who drop out are ‚Äúlost‚Äù once they leave their communities. Climate change factors like extreme drought and conflict over resources increase migration. We need to provide localized learning and earning pathways for young people.

CARE‚Äôs Tipping Point project challenges social norms that sustain #childmarriage ‚Äì by changing men‚Äôs behavior in the home, encouraging positive peer pressure and empowering girls directly.	https://t.co/1H2JKqZ4U6
Reducing early marriage requires a synchronized change in social norms at the household and community levels, as well as building alternative pathways for adolescent girls and girls‚Äô own agency to envision a different future for themselves.
Because of interrupted access to education, limited mobility and social networks, girls are less likely to engage in self or wage employment.
Early marriage has a negative effect on girls‚Äô health, education, ability to engage with peers and to participate in decision-making processes. Married girls are at high risk of intimate partner violence.
A5: Child brides are at significant risk of having children at younger ages, suffering complications in pregnancy and childbirth, contracting HIV/AIDS, having more children over their lifetime, leaving school, and living in poverty than their unmarried peers. #Gender360Summit
RT @emilyUshrair: #Gender360Summit @CARE's approach to #gender #transformative change cuts across all of our work! https://t.co/yZS8UXz9DS
We work with youth, of course, but also with health providers, parents, religious leaders, and community ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù so everyone understands the #reprohealth needs of young people and can work together to meet those needs.
Young people who‚Äôve learned leadership skills (decision making, voice, agency, organization, and self-confidence) are more likely to self-advocate for further education. They‚Äôre also more likely to seek health services and to have an active voice in sexual relationships.
Adolescents need to be able to visualize an alternative pathway. They need to see the benefits/application of continued education in everyday life. Education that‚Äôs irrelevant to their daily needs isn‚Äôt appealing, and we need to continue teaching relevant knowledge and skills.
A4: Young people need access to quality, confidential, and judgment-free sexual/#reprohealth info and services. CARE‚Äôs #SRHR programs work to break down barriers at all levels ‚Äî individual, institutional, and structural ‚Äî so young people can get them. #Gender360Summit

RT @aprilhouston: I was fortunate enough to meet some of the youth who volunteered to be peer leaders for this program, and let me tell you‚Ä¶
Some countries, for example, have promoted ‚Äúgender equality stamps‚Äù for private companies that recognize companies who make strides towards greater gender equality.
It‚Äôs also important to help young people understand what types of jobs are in demand so they can train for and pursue them. Instead of learning pre-determined vocations, which flood the marketplace in an unsustainable way, they need to learn how to identify and fill market gaps.
CARE's research shows that low financial literacy among adolescents equates to low rates of savings amongst adolescents. We are focused on identifying how to strengthen financial literacy and knowledge on savings among adolescents.
A3: CARE‚Äôs research shows that adolescents often lack numeracy skills, so they have trouble understanding concepts like profit and loss. We need better financial literacy training if we want young people to be able to make better decisions about money. #Gender360Summit

Many STEM curricula continue to include only examples of male role models. Girls and boys need to learn the contributions of scientists, regardless of gender. Without that education, many girls cannot imagine a world where they, too, can be leaders.
While technology can be a gateway to information, it can bring negative consequences. Teachers and parents recognize those consequences often, but we have to teach them how to support safe technology use at all stages of development, and teach young people about internet safety.
A2: CARE‚Äôs research tells us girls and boys have significantly different access to technology and use tech differently, echoing gendered hierarchies, in and out of classrooms. Girls need better access to and practice with technology. #Gender360Summit
