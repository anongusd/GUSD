@BrettKavanaugh Thursday July 1, 1982 while drunk you sexually assaulted Dr. Ford. Your an alcoholic with control issues, anger problems, liar that feels entitled.  Rape/sexual assault is about power and control. You get drunk and rape your wife. Sick SOB! #StopKavanaugh #MeToo
@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorCollins Thursday July 1, 1982 he documented all 3 boys drinking brewskis same thing we called them in the 80's. He assaulted Dr. Ford that day. Call for FBI, can't have a Trump on the court for 30 years. Liar, Clinton's, anger
@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorCollins Judge Kavanaugh hasn't been truthful from the beginning even on small things just like Trump  Mark Judge didn't give a sworn statement, his lawyer wrote and signed it leaving him unaccountable. The anger, delusional, drunk

@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorCollins The rest of the people especially Mr. Judge has to be brought before the committee and place under oath.  His lawyer signing a six sentences statement isn't under sworn oath under felony. Kavanaugh acted just like Trump. Would you put Trump on the court?  Stand up for #MeToo
@JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorCollins Dr. Ford was honest and believable but not only was Judge Kavanaugh not believable but showed the anger, aggression, and dishonesty of an alcoholic. He didn't show the temperament for a judge. Mr. Judge must be heard from

@BrettKavanaugh you sick SOB can't help but lie and throw your family under the bus.  You deserve to be in prison not on the court.  There has been questions of your lying and drunken behavior since your last hearing for the D.C. Appeals Court which you shouldn't be setting on!
