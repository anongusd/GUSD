#OntheBlog Chairman Sumwalt highlights our call to action for the transportation industry, regulators and safety advocates &amp; community to implement the safety recommendations associated w/ our 2019-2020 Most Wanted List. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/Jc40IIF9Ny
NEW video: Introducing the 2019 - 2020 Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements. https://t.co/r8U6TQmgol #ntsbmwl
For more information about the 2019-2020 Most Wanted List visit https://t.co/DDygjyiGfu #ntsbmwl https://t.co/zWzJOETZcD
Vice Chairman Landsberg: Sleep apnea can be very insidious; people wake up, they're tired, they don't know why. The good news is that sleep apnea is a treatable condition.  We need better education about screening &amp;  treatment. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/NbkzBFiHIF
Member Weener: When an accident or crash happens we need to ensure occupants have survivable space. We also need to keep occupants in that space, for example, w/ lap &amp; shoulder belts, &amp; for children through the use of child car seats and booster seats. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/zRmZNnrM4d
Vice Chairman Landsberg: Fatigue affects us all, but especially teens. Teens should get 8-10 hours of sleep a night. But I don’t know how many do. Put them in a vehicle fatigued, and that’s a lethal combination. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/DFlQ3LAXzw
Chairman Sumwalt: As a result of our investigations we've found ways that 135 operators can improve. For a couple of decades, airlines have been using data that comes from routine flights, to look for where the exceedances are. Part 135 operations should be doing this as well. https://t.co/qJ8ALJQMeO
Member Weener: The NTSB has been making recommendations on collision avoidance technology for 20 years. We want to see collision avoidance systems installed as standard equipment on all new highway vehicles. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/E4TkQKLH9J
"Safety should not be a luxury, it should be standard." #ntsbmwl https://t.co/E4TkQKLH9J
Member Homendy: About the same proportion of highway fatalities are related to speeding as impairment, yet we don’t think of it the same way. We recommend the use of technology – automated enforcement &amp; vehicle based – be used more broadly to reduce speeding-related crashes. https://t.co/HIpU1taSEr
Mem. Homendy: In 1961 Pres. Kennedy set a goal to put a man on the moon by the end of the decade--July 1969, Armstrong &amp; Aldrin did that. In 1969, NTSB investigated its 1st PTC preventable accident. In 1 decade we put a man on the moon but in 5 decades we haven't implemented PTC. https://t.co/G1M2WF0ynD
Member Homendy: To address other drug impairment across all modes we recommend that all safety critical personnel should be drug tested, but the panel of what they are tested for should be expanded. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/1HFThe60TG
Member Homendy: 1/3 of all highway fatalities result from alcohol-impaired driving. Those deaths &amp; injuries are 100% preventable. #ntsbmwl https://t.co/1HFThe60TG
Vice Chairman Landsberg: The distraction problem does not just lie in your hand – it is in your head, when you are not cognitively engaged. To address this issue, we need good smart laws, greater enforcement of those laws, &amp; education so that distracted driving carries a stigma. https://t.co/9Mqi2wWBVD
The 2019-2020 Most Wanted List promotes several specific safety recommendations that can and should be implemented during these next two years. It also features broad, longstanding safety issues that still threaten the traveling public. https://t.co/p67UwQS3Me #ntsbmwl

Since 1969, we have investigated over 150 PTC-preventable accidents. #NTSBrail #MWLMonday
The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 gave the railroads an extension to install PTC by 2018. https://t.co/E3ja2gvmHL #NTSBrail #MWLMonday
In 2008, after the deadly PTC-preventable head-on collision between a commuter train and a freight train in Chatsworth, California, Congress passed the law requiring PTC implementation by the end of 2015. https://t.co/5GNCFjiuQ3  #NTSBrail #MWLMonday (Photo by @latimes) https://t.co/s4ypiDBqx3
#DYK We first recommended a system similar to PTC more than 40 years ago? https://t.co/Mab2GAEMaB #NTSBrail #MWLMonday
PTC, a collision avoidance technology, prevents mistakes from turning tragic by taking over train operation if the human operator is not responding appropriately. https://t.co/nO7M2n59AJ  #NTSBrail #MWLMonday https://t.co/i8wNAkrrQv

There is increased risk w/ the growth in shipping flammable liquids &amp; we must do what is needed to mitigate risks
Railroads are filling a transportation gap recently &amp; rapidly transforming themselves into rolling pipelines
Production of crude oil increased rapidly creating a need to move it along	routes where a pipeline infrastructure does not exist
Increased production of ethanol in North America created a need for it to be	transported to &amp; from diverse locations across the continent

Sumwalt: Only a fraction of the info about weather hazards gets reported through the present system to the next pilot who needs it.
Sumwalt: NTSB has investigated numerous accidents that illustrate a complex set of relationships in the PIREP system.

This collision is the fifth accident the NTSB has investigated since 2011 involving large vessels in or near the Houston Ship Channel.
Just after meeting and passing the first of a line of outbound ships, he began to lose control of the vessel.
In the thick fog, the pilot of the Conti Peridot lost the use of visual cues on which marine pilots rely.
On the day of the accident, dense fog rolled in, at times the pilot of the Conti Peridot could barely see the ship’s bow, 400 feet away.
Meeting now, the collision of the bulk carrier Conti Peridot  with the chemical tanker Carla Maersk. March 9, 2015, Houston Ship Channel.

Accident Animation, WMATA Metrorail accident, L'Enfant Plaza  https://t.co/afY2LxV8Sh
Only robust, permanent safety oversight ensures safety improvements become the norm and continue as norm throughout WMATA’s operations.
All the actions, plans we have seen to date are necessary but not sufficient for long-term safety improvement.
This is the 13th NTSB investigation of a Metrorail accident, 9th since 2004. 101 recommendations issued to WMATA by NTSB.
WMATA needs a regulatory structure with rules, inspections &amp; enforcement. Federal	Railroad Administration can provide all three.
Tri-State Oversight Committee no more able to enforce corrective action in 2015 than in 2009.
2015 hearing on WMATA’s safety culture revealed disturbing picture: organizational, oversight shortcomings continue.
9 people died in a 2009 WMATA accident, our investigation report cited WMATA’s lack of safety culture, ineffective safety oversight..
Metrorail safety critical to daily life of Washington, effective operations of all branches of federal, local governments.
Chairman Hart, “It is our hope that the report we consider today will help to ensure	safety in WMATA’s rail operations in the future.”
Meeting now on January 12, 2015 electrical arcing, smoke accident near L’Enfant Plaza. Ninety-one people injured, one person died.

Fatigue can actually impair our ability to judge just how fatigued we really are! #MWLMonday #NTSBmwl
Human fatigue is an enabler of other impairments, such as poor judgment, decision	making &amp; slowed reaction times. #MWLMonday #NTSBmwl
Fatigue degrades a person’s ability to stay awake, alert, &amp; attentive to the demands	of controlling their vehicle safely #MWLMonday
.@NTSB has issued more than 200 safety recommendations addressing fatigue-related problems across all modes of transportation. #MWLMonday
Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a common fatigue-inducing medical	disorder that affects pilots, drivers, captains, &amp; conductors. #MWLMonday
For over 40 years, @NTSB has identified fatigue as a problem	&amp; obstructive sleep apnea as one of its several causes. #MWLMonday #NTSBmwl

Today's meeting on the NTSB's passenger tire safety special investigation report has concluded.
The NTSB makes 11 recommendations to NHTSA, AAA, Rubber Mfgr Assoc &amp; tire mfgrs to address safety issues identified at today's meeting.
Hart: Today we'll challenge government &amp; industry to address systemic issues and provide consumers with needed tire maintenance information.
Hart: Many vehicle owners do not understand that tire aging is a separate issue from tread wear.
Hart: Few people are aware that tires must also be registered so that they can be recalled if they are defective.
Hart:  Our current system for tire registration and recalls has proven to be ineffective.
Hart: In 2013, such tire-related crashes took more than 500 lives and led to 19,000 injuries.
NTSB Chairman Christopher A. Hart: 33,000 times a year, a problem with a passenger vehicle tire leads to a crash.
