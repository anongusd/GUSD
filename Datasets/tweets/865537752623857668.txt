üéôÔ∏èThis is the best podcast episode in history. Nobody makes better podcast episodes than us.  Yes, this week we're looking at the Hyperbolic Fallacy. 		Including a great interview with reporter and author @JoeStrupp about his book Killing Journalism		https://t.co/VLRkjTlCEL
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I have stuff to do.  Thanks for the discussion, I hope you found it as interesting as I did.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Right, so your question should have been "May I ask, will every single case ever of discrimination be treated as seriously as this".  I'll stipulate the answer to that is no.		We seem to have wandered of the point of Obama causing global recessions.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Super bad example.  That case DID get support.  It went to trial!  And it hasn't even been ruled on yet. Closing arguments were just last week.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Read my fucking tweet.  The CASE is about race.  It was brought because of discrimination.  Part of the settlement involved payouts.  Another part involved Citi setting up a consortium to assist ALL low to middle income people, not just black ones (that would be discrimination)
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The CASE was about skin color.  Explicitly.  That specific part of the SETTLEMENT wasn't about skin color.  It was open to any low to middle income applicant.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump You'd like me to guess if a case against a large bank who was denying people loans purely because they were Asian; or because they were Indian; or because they were white, would get support?  Yes.  Yes it would.  You're not logicking very well.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump ... Secondly, this solution had nothing to do with skin color. This was a concession Citi made so that they didn't have to go though a court case where the other side presented evidence they were denying loans based only on skin color.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump First of all, it was made to assist people who were denied by ONE lender due to income.  That doesn't mean all lenders would deny them, and the solution wasn't to give them a loan anyway.  It was to ask if they qualified for any other lenders...
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Make your fucking mind up and stop moving goalposts.  You yourself said the economy crashed in 2001.  Is the Buycks-Roberson case your best evidence or not?
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Right.  If their income means one lender denied their application, they have the right to have it considered by other lenders "under their particular loan policies and programs".
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump That's not what happened.  They simply weren't allowed to treat 'black folks' different from white folks if their financial situations were similar.		At no point was it even suggested in this case that any decision should be made 'regardless of credit standing'.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Also, not for nothing, Obama was the very junior associate on an 8 attorney team on that case.  He billed about 130 hours, barely spoke in court and Citibank's lead lawyer says he doesn't remember seeing him in court at all.  A bit disingenuous to suggest it's Obama's fault.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump That case made Citi treat black people the same as white people. The settlement agreement didn't make them 'loosen' anything. It said they'd form a consortium &amp; if one member denied an application they'd see if any other members would grant it. Still had to meet lending criteria https://t.co/BjZ0VsaJai
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump You're talking about Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank?
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Good to know.  Feel free to explain how he caused the crash when he was a lawyer if you have time.  Interested to hear your take on it.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Of course I thought you meant when he was in office.  When you say 'Obama's legal team' and talk about something that affected the entire country/world, who would think anything else?		Thank you for explaining.  At least now I realise you're not suggesting time travel.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I'm really trying to understand here.  Obama became president in 2009.  		When do YOU think the economy crashed?  Genuine question.
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Laying the ground work from the future?
@alkforex @jukeboxjunkie88 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Are you fucking kidding me? You blamed Obama's legal team doing something in the 90s. Obama. In the 90s. Read those dates again and tell me I'm dismissing data and evidence. You're blaming Obama for a crash that happened years before his presidency.

@charliekirk11 Donald's staff is also a lot smaller.  mostly because they keep quitting, getting fired or getting indicted.
Basically that was just a 10 minute way of saying he lost.
@Alyssa_Milano I honestly don't think he would care.
He ends by threatening another shutdown or a state of national emergency on Feb 15th if he doesn't get a good deal, then leaves without taking questions.  Of course, the fact he just totally caved doesn't put him in the strongest position to threaten anybody.
Trump believes that crime will go down by a massive percentage and drugs will be cut by a number that nobody will believe if he gets his wall.  These are not evidenced in the data.
This speech may go on until the three week re-opening is up.  He's basically filibustering the government
He thinks people are leaving their violent, oppressive and war torn countries and heading for the US is because the economy is strong.  Because migrants walk thousands of miles based on the Dow.
Seems like the deal is to reopen the government and then negotiate border security, which is exactly what the Dems have been saying for a month.  They didn't give him anything at all.  He just caved for nothing.
He's moved on from the deal, back to drugs and stuff.
Now he's saying that human trafficking is at the worst it's every been in the history of the world.  Blames the internet.  Forgets slavery, presumably.
Yes!  He did. This, for the record, is bullshit.  Experts who combat human trafficking say this doesn't happen
I bet he talks about tape over the women's mouths
Now he's back to the scaremongering again
Claiming again that he never proposed concrete walls.
Trump says the steel barriers have see-through visibility.  As opposed to opaque visibility, presumably.
Now he's saying how great the deal is *going* to be.  So there's no deal yet.  Looks like he's caved without getting any money, otherwise he would be talking about the 'significant down payment' he definitely would have convinced the Dems to give him. Art of the deal
Trrump praises the bipartisanship of those debating the shutdown/wall issue
Trump claims the Democrats have fully acknowledged that having fences, barriers, walls "or whatever you want to call it" will be part of the border security
Trump says all Americans are very very special people, and he's proud that you are citizens of America.  Someone wrote this on a teleprompter for him

@Tagg1957 If it makes you happy to talk about how CNN once sponsored an award that an independent jury gave to a liar, then have fun with that.  I believe Coca Cola sponsored the 1999 Tour De France, so you should probably imply they approved of Lance Armstrong taking steroids too.
@Tagg1957 Didn't defend him. He's a lying fake journalist that has rightly lost his job. But Junior's tweet implied he was connected to CNN, outright lied that his stories were about Trump, &amp; ignored the fact that he's not part of American media. Lying fake Trumps should be called out too.

20. There are better ways to address this.  Gun control works.  It worked for the Australians after Port Arthur and it worked for the Brits after Dunblane.	[/Thread] #NeverAgainMSD
18. At Fort Hood in 2009 Nidal Hasan killed 13 and wounded 30.  He was surrounded by armed, highly trained soldiers.  Even better trained than teachers.	19. If they knew teachers had guns, the shooter would target them first.
17. Chris Kyle, one of the most skilled shooters in history, was shot and killed by a young man he was mentoring. Kyle and a highly trained friend were both armed at the time, and could do nothing to prevent it.
15. Teachers don't have time for marking and lesson prep - let alone weapons training.	16. Philando Castile - a public school employee, pulled over by cops, told them he had his licensed, legally purchased gun on him.  They shot him.
13. If having more guns in more places made Americans safer, America should have the lowest gun related deaths of any developed country.  Not the highest.	14. Teachers are not automatically good people. What happens when an overworked teacher snaps and shoots a kid?
11. There are 3.6m teachers in the US. That's 720000 extra guns needed.  Even basic safety training would cost $72m.  Proper training?  More like $720m.	12. And the guns would cost another $360m. No wonder the NRA is in favor of this.
9. It won't deter shooters because of fear of getting shot- 40% of mass shooters kill themselves &amp; more than 10% die by cop bullets. They go in expecting to die.	10. Police officers who engage active shooters get shot themselves 46.7% of the time
7. Most school shooters are kids. Will the teachers be able to shoot a kid - maybe one they taught and knew well?	8. What happens when a disgruntled kid decides to grab the teacher's gun for a prank, or to make a statement, or to use it on another kid they're fighting with?
5. Public schools can't afford books and pens.  Who pays for the guns and training?	6. Who takes responsibility when a kid gets caught in the crossfire or gets hit by an errant bullet - the teacher? The school district? The government?
3. The armed, trained deputy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High took cover outside instead of confronting the shooter.	4. When the SWAT team arrives, how will they tell, in a split second, who is a shooter and who is a teacher?
20 reasons putting guns in teachers hands is a stupid idea (in no particular order):	1. Teachers don't want to be armed	2. The NYPD has an accuracy rate of 34% (43% if the shooter is less than six feet away). How accurate will the teachers be?	#NeverAgain [Thread]
