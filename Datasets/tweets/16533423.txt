.@Pinkomomma yeah, funny you should say that, there's a German metal band with the Wolfen name, I did search to show not original.
But yeah, I've been gone b/c had enough stress and chaos in "real life", didn't need to seek it out on Twitter also!

.@KiranKS Or citizen, non-citizen, to reflect definition as not of dominant culture. #atheist

.@KiranKS Default assumption is usually cracker like me. Same is true when specifying other ethnicities or non-Xian religions. #atheist

.@ChanceP83 So to demand further anti-patient regulation, and use to block #hcr for other patients to get any kind of care is perverse. #p2
.@ChanceP83 ...not only that fraud already weeded out, but many deserving claims are difficult to collect, currently weighted in Drs FAVOR
.@ChanceP83 Fact that Murtha died from error w/ best access to care shows very possible risk to happen to"reg folks," and studies showed...
.@ChanceP83 Promoters of tort reform resisting #hcr for uninsured have tone and quips that prob is Drs victims of loads of fake claims paid.

.@ChanceP83 No, not "pretty pissed" at that aspect in particular, disgusted and annoyed, but you asked what Murtha case had to do with #hcr
.@grimmlock @VeronikaG I saw that trollcat earlier today, thought it was funny/twisted as usual, and your tweets made me think of it.

2 @PC_ROB Study didn't say upfront only showed clothing shopping behavior, although that's what they used. Implied for EVERYTHING.
2 @PC_ROB That's like trying to find gender diff claiming "who likes to drive more" when only counted folks who choose "with a truck."
2 @PC_ROB Used shopping behavior for couple of items to generalize and project that onto shopping for all products, that's why flawed.
2 @PC_ROB No, these aren't "specific" cases, that's my point! Study made generalization based only on shopping 4 certain items, like clothes
2 @PC_ROB Both genders have both styles, just depends on personal interest of shopper. And pulling sexual stereotypes in was just weird
2 @PC_ROB I know you didn't catch clip, but point of study was that women browse when shopping, men don't, just get-in, get-out. Not true...
2 @PC_ROB No, I've seen women do same in hardware store, like my mom, why I also used my non-clotheshorse friend who lingers in bookstores.
2 @PC_ROB if differences are valid, like "Gay men are attracted to men", but "they shop like women b/c also attracted to men," not so much
Man, that poor dude on the plane, now on MSNBC.
2 @PC_ROB I don't think hardware store examples are just different individuals, have you ever been in hardware store? Like a clubhouse!
2 @PC_ROB And you and I are just BSing on Twitter, it was weird for DrNancy to make just a statement on her national TV health/science forum
2 @PC_ROB ...and my dad in a music store (he's musician.) I have a girlfriend who grabs-n-goes for clothing, but takes forever at bookstore.
2 @PC_ROB ...may have different shopping behavior for other items, as example I used for my husband in hardware, also true for my grandpa...
2 @PC_ROB Of course it's ridiculous, 1st assumes being Gay male is same as being a woman. Plus, guys who may shop quickly for clothes...
And study itself is BS, said women-as-gatherers in wiring, or some such nonsense. That women browse, men grab-n-go. Not my guy in hardware.
This was in context of study claim women shop differently than men, so DrNancy chirped in implying Gay men shop like women? Stereotype much?

@Proudlib I guess Corso/Depp got the pay off, doin' the nekkid naughty with the sexy demon-chick at the end!
@Proudlib But I think the all-time creepiest movie is The Changeling with George C. Scott.
@Proudlib I love Prince of Darkness, another on my list just mentioned. I guess I see Ninth gate as sexy mystery, not horror.
@Proudlib Really? I lost count how many times I've seen it, like The Godfather I & II, no matter how far in when I catch it, I watch to end.
Groovus, double-feature! Near Dark has been followed by one of my other favorite films, The Ninth Gate. Even if Polanski's a creepy scumbag.
@cherokee_autumn Oh, yuck! Those are the worst. I always keep saltines and broth in my pantry, never feel like going to store when that sick
2 @Dasani_01 Yep, Bill Paxton, as character Severin, is going to get blown up in a minute. He is hilarious in this role.
"...Normal folks, they don't spit out bullets when you shoot 'em, no sir!" ~ Caleb's Dad on Near Dark
My favorite vampire movie is on, Near Dark. "Those people back there, they wasn't normal..."
@cherokee_autumn Hey, I just got on and caught the end of that, what's wrong, are you sick?

2 @PC_ROB Yeah, last year we forgot some leftover gravy in the back of the fridge, was NOT pleasant! Extra turkey is all we really need.
2 @PC_ROB My mom's treating us to a buffet, too. We'll prob get discounted turkey tomorrow to cook for sammiches.
2 @PC_ROB Is it over the river and thru the woods?
Crap, another typo!
2 @yywhy Nope, my tweetdeck said status unavailable, or something for few hours last night. Hdan't even been on since Tuesday!
@PC_ROB Oh, good, Tweetdeck has been acting buggy. What are you up to today?
Am I showing up? Hello Twitterverse?

2 @Dasani_01 I've just accepted I'm nuts. Plus found there's finally a name for my weird schedule: "delayed sleep phase syndrome."
@Dasani_01 Not only that, health issues of my youngest are due in part to some of these effects on my system. Sucks.
@Dasani_01 No, I have a saga of diff meds, and some of my current physical health conditions are result of side-effects. Made me worse.
@Dasani_01 I've been on almost everything, suffered many side-effects, and those untried have similar effects I don't want to risk.
@Dasani_01 Which meds? I'm on many...
2 @Dasani_01 I'm trying not to get too riled up, need to catch a nap in an hour after youngest gets on schoolbus , up all night as usual!

It's a pattern that goes back at least the 20yrs I've lived here, whatever party in White House, opposite side elected as VA Governor.
When 1st Bush Pres, Va elected Dem Gov Wilder; 2 Clinton terms brought 2 Rep Govs, Allen and Gilmore; Bush II = 2 Dem Govs, Warner & Kaine.
Seriously, Obama has NOTHING to do w/ VA outcome, other than we're perverse in electing Gov from opposite party than that of White House...
RT @OTOOLEFAN: Why aren't there ever any UFO sightings near Yale or MIT? It's always near a town called Bumblescum.

Of all the politically charged things I say, it had to be something about balloonboy that aired on TV. Oh, the irony. So which tweet was it?
I really don't want to sound like a media whore, especially surrounding topic, but can anyone tell me which of my tweets was read on CNN?
RT @DianeLSullivan: @LaBrujaRoja They just read your tweet on CNN! || What?!? Crap, and I missed it! Which one? I bitched alot.

2 @RandiPDX I'm sure it would be one among many, seems like CNN are the ONLY ones not sick of this story.
2 @RandiPDX No Way! i just ckd during commercial, @donlemoncnn is STILL doing balloonboy? WTF?!? Why are they doing this?
2 @RandiPDX I switched it over to Syfy, weird movie premiere. Probably will suck, but better than CNN/s nonsense.
@RandiPDX And MSNBC has marathon of Prison and crime "documentaries", I can only take so much of Fox, what's a newsjunkie to do?
Wait, wait, wait... @donlemoncnn , was that even ONE minute to student that DIED?!? After 40 mins to balloonboy BS? Is this Nat Inquirer TV?

@claridad27 The Ninth Gate isn't scary, unless you're super-fundie Christian maybe, to me movie is more sexyhot murder-mystery!
2 @OTOOLEFAN Like when screen filled with back of man's jacket. Took a lot of precision!
2 @OTOOLEFAN Hitchcock filmed it to make it look that way, but cuts actually during what appear to be moments of all-black screen
2 @OTOOLEFAN Another one is Rain with Joan Crawford. But I'm also a Crawford devotee, even if she was nuts. Maybe I identify with her!

2 @OTOOLEFAN The Ninth Gate, for example, great if B&W, w/ color only for close-ups of demon-girl's eyes, and the big demon sex scene at end
2 @OTOOLEFAN So there's still a use for it, some movies could still be in B&W, intensify drama, with splashes of color for specific emphasis
2 @OTOOLEFAN I think Black-and-white format can be useful to focus more on characters, great color cinematography can be distracting
