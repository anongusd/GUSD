@McgibbletsEsq @jadler1969 @DouthatNYT Footnote: it's not the National Emergencies Act, but a different law (10 U.S.C. ¬ß 2808). The NEA doesn't itself confer emergency powers; it is a framework statute that governs the process of invoking other statutes that create standby authorities. (There's about 125 of them.)
@DouthatNYT @jacklgoldsmith @marty_lederman ... which is why Congress never bestirred itself to check how presidents have used these statutes until now -- why, as Trump said Friday, nobody complained about the nearly five dozen previous such declarations. The present situation is not analogous.
@DouthatNYT @jacklgoldsmith See my chain with @marty_lederman. I challenge whether "abuse" is the right word for presidents invoking statutory standby authorities consistent w/ Congressional will; this is more a semantic complaint about "emergency" being used as a term of art to mean "special circumstance."
Notable that Trump did not say the alternative is to bring them to Guantanamo. Here's @EricSchmittNYT's &amp; my latest on the huge and fascinating problem of what will happen to the ISIS detainees in the Kurdish-led SDF's makeshift wartime prisons in Syria. https://t.co/YDNb8GMvRI https://t.co/IJyTrCzJXT
@marty_lederman @DouthatNYT @jacklgoldsmith Is it "abuse" if previous examples of presidents invoking statutory standby authorities were consistent with Congressional will? Or is that just a semantic complaint about "emergency" becoming a term of art meaning "special situation" (e.g. sanctionable behavior identified)? https://t.co/zmBxmbyomQ
(&amp; what's the definition of "abuse" for that pattern whose existence I'm challenging? A bad-faith claim that an "emergency" exists, to achieve a policy goal Congress had specifically weighed and rejected?)
Is it accurate that presidents have chronically abused the power to declare a "national emergency," @DouthatNYT? Which specific historical example or examples are you referring to? https://t.co/vrjaf1I0Eq
@emptywheel @marty_lederman @RDEliason There's an unsourced line to that effect in a Nov 2017 WSJ article; is there anything else more concrete? Could it be that WSJ sources didn't understand that OSC was transitioning control but that was the plan from the start? (I have no idea, just not sure this is established.)
@emptywheel @RDEliason @marty_lederman On the previous point, as Marty has written a lot about elsewhere, Rosenstein didn't appoint Mueller under the reg, but rather just said its procedural provisions 600.4-600.10 would apply to him.  https://t.co/gllRSV8Duz
@RDEliason @emptywheel I agree that Barr, not Mueller, is the decider. My point is the rules neither require nor prohibit (except for grand-jury secrecy redactions) Barr lifting the confidentiality from a long report, if Mueller gives him one. (Similarly, DOJ has no policy for impeachment referrals.)
@emptywheel @RDEliason I'm not the one who has written any of those "report is imminent!" articles, so I don't know, but I agree with your assessment of their likely origins.
@emptywheel @RDEliason There sure have been a lot of cycles of news reports saying Mueller is expected by sources to deliver a report by summer's end/after the midterms/by mid February etc, haven't there.
@emptywheel @RDEliason So if it's true Mueller is writing a lengthy report, a lot will turn on how Barr interprets his ambiguous promise to act "consistent" with the regs in turning over info to Congress. The regs are silent, so what's consistent with them? /2
@emptywheel While it is absolutely true that the special counsel regs drafted by the Clinton DOJ do not envision or require a fulsome Starr-like report from the prosecutor that goes to Congress and becomes public, it's important to note that the regs also do not prohibit one.  @RDEliason /1

Weird moment as Rep. Cedric Richmond demands that Whitaker agree with him that DOJ was created in 1957 by the Civil Rights Act &amp; accuses Whitaker of wasting time when he starts to talk about Ulysses Grant. (Richmond must mean the Civil Rights Division but says again DOJ.)
Not sure how to square Whitaker saying he talked to no one in Trump's circle or the White House about his views of the Mueller investigation when he was a private citizen before joining DOJ, when he interviewed with Don McGahn to be the WH lawyer dealing with it in July 2017.
Finally back. Asked by Lofgren what the basis was for his comment at the Huawei press conference that Mueller investigation is close to completion, Whitaker declines to say
We're in a 15-minute break. The substantive news so far is that Whitaker has testified he didn't tell Trump or his team any information about the Mueller probe. From a spectacle perspective, the highlight is Whitaker telling Chairman Nadler that Nadler's five minutes were up.
Collins, having raised concerns about political theater and character assassination, asks Whitaker if Bruce Ohr is still employed by the Justice Department.
Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the new ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, should be an auctioneer. His speaking tempo is a blitz.
Whitaker makes news: testifies he hasn't briefed Trump or White House about info from the Mueller investigation, hasn't overruled Mueller or interfered in special counsel's work in any way.

@curtisabradley @jacklgoldsmith @edswaine @marty_lederman I agree presidents have done this since the pre-WW2 stirrings of the imperial presidency era, mostly in minor instances that that no one challenged, plus the two big ones (Taiwan, ABM).

@jacklgoldsmith @edswaine @marty_lederman @curtisabradley Point taken but I think I can carve out a stable terrace on your slippery slope for a situation where the Constitution says nothing, there's no Supreme Court opinion on point, and historical practice is inconsistent, without necessarily embracing nihilism for everything.
@edswaine @marty_lederman @jacklgoldsmith @curtisabradley I'm just saying there is no real answer. Practice was the opposite in 19th Century to what it became in 20th (raising priors about whether Constitutional meaning can evolve), &amp; even a long and clear historical practice isn't dispositive when untested (see, e.g., INS v. Chadha).

Objection from someone: Barr could mean 1512(c)(2) catchall is not redundant to (c)(1) w/out having it cover all proceeding-impeding acts in an open-ended way, by interpreting (c)(2) to mean the various types of "witness tampering" described elsewhere in 1512 but not other things
I love it when Chuck Grassley get righteous about making the government more responsive to FOIA and protecting whistleblowers.
@becingber He didn't; the topic then shifted. I interpret that to mean he thinks such an order would be "wrong" and he is not going to do anything "wrong" which is not necessarily the same thing as illegal. I suppose he means he would resign or force president to remove him instead.
FWIW, Barr's arg that the 1512(c) obstruction of justice statute only covers evidence tampering is inconsistent with the plain text of the law - makes (c)(2) redundant. (Separate issue from theory it doesn't/can't cover the president's exercise of his constitutional powers.) https://t.co/8YX05aKgcx

First-cut take on the ongoing confirmation hearing for the once and future attorney general, Bill Barr https://t.co/JYLXS3T3dw
@rroiphe I thought he said a president *can* fire a US attorney, but that he wouldn't stand by and allow it if he thought it was to stop a lawful investigation. I.e. he'd resign in protest. But that doesn't make the firing illegal obstruction of justice.
@joshgerstein The exchange seemed garbled to me. Scenarios of putting out info that will hurt the US = prior restraint injunction. "Contempt" instead connotes refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about one's sources, right?
Notably, Barr deleted the words "by me" when he read his opening statement today. In many subtle ways, he seemed to me to signal today that he may be qualifying his longstanding executive power views. Very interesting. https://t.co/5GjZ2asKNp
Barr sure doesn't sound like a zealot on criminal leak investigations, talking about "internal discipline" to deter leakers. Notably, he's from the earlier DOJ era when the government never brought such charges - the change kicked in post-9/11 slash mid-Bush43 administration.
@becingber He is qualifying/softening. I don't understand how the notion that it would be a crime for potus to give a pardon to someone who promises not to implicate him in a crime is consistent with his theory that Congress can't criminalize a corrupt exercise of constitutional powers.

From Barr's 1989 confirmation hearing for OLC: In an ambiguous situation where more than one legal conclusion is possible, he would accept a superior's (AG or POTUS) judgment &amp; not resign even if he disagreed. (Also notable: calling the attorney general the "president's lawyer") https://t.co/6r4tFqZcxU
A subtle caveat in Barr's statements in his written testimony that he wants to let Mueller finish and be transparent about findings is "where judgments are to be made by me." Under Barr's view of executive power, Trump could direct the AG to substitute his own legal judgments.

@NinaBernstein1 @JillAbramson As a description of the situation (not moral behavior), it is correct that each side is equivalently dug in, in a way that precludes split-the-difference compromise that could end the shutdown. Dems would be choosing to "lose' if they provide any wall funding at all.
@NinaBernstein1 @JillAbramson + the whole thing is a meditation on the tradeoffs between a realistic way out of the immediate jam, which is causing increasing real-world damage to people and the economy and threatens to go on indefinitely, at the cost of longer-term constitutional norm/rule-of-law damage.
@NinaBernstein1 @JillAbramson Only by people who are not good at reading comprehension. this is not about (false) moral equivalence. It is an empirical fact that for the government to reopen via the normal budget process, either Trump or Dems would have to decide to capitulate on wall spending.

@AndyGrewal @alegalnerd @RealFacelessMan @arikarikari Twitter is doing something weird and not letting me reply to this q but you should examine the specific campaign-finance statutes that Cohen has pled guilty to violating via actions prosecutors say Trump coordinated with and directed - counts 7&amp;8. https://t.co/YacatbR5or https://t.co/W1islOHGtX

Corsi says he just figured that out on his own -- i.e. it was an educated guess, and he wasn't conveying back info he had obtained from WL, directly or via the WL intermediary he initially lied about having reached out to on behalf of Stone. /4 https://t.co/1u41tvJrte
As we know, since Corsi released a draft plea deal he spurned, Mueller was interested in an email Corsi sent Roger Stone on Aug 2, 2016, as he returned from Europe, suggesting that he knew WL would release Podesta-related emails in October. /2 https://t.co/c7ax96B5sR

Actually maybe not so minor: compare it to Obama's decision to transfer 5 Gitmo detainees in the Bergdahl prisoner swap w/out giving Congress 30 days notice as a statute required. Trump is endorsing an exec power theory GOP loudly rejected under Obama. https://t.co/OiszKfiL8k

@JakeLaperruque Can you point to any evidence that anybody had even thought about using pro forma sessions to block recess appointments that far back in time? Anyway: https://t.co/E63jCki8cX
@nycsouthpaw Well, McC is clearly dissembling when he says his Garland move fits within tradition. There have been too few election-year vacancies during divided control of govt to establish a pattern that would amount to a tradition.
@JakeLaperruque i am not even sure what we're arguing about now
@nycsouthpaw https://t.co/MRLQbGJqKj
@nycsouthpaw McC obviously wasn't referring to a situation when an opposite-party Senate took up a nomination the year after an election won by the incumbent president. Maybe you think Senate GOP would have kept the seat open 5 years if HRC won, but that's not the Garland fact pattern.
@JakeLaperruque pro forma sessions to block a recess appointment weren't a thing yet
@JakeLaperruque I was responding only to the much RT'd claim that this interviewer held McC accountable w/ "the facts," bc his grasp of them was garbled. That doesn't mean there's not plenty of other things to discuss on this topic.
But, as a factual matter, McConnell was right to object to 1956 as a counter-example to Merrick Garland. Eisenhower recess-appointed William Brennan; it is not the case that the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed a Republican SCt nominee ahead of a presidential election. https://t.co/H809E7hYup

@rgoodlaw @gregorydjohnsen This is what Kaine is trying to get at. Is there a limit on who can be deemed a defensible partner?

@gregorydjohnsen I think the issue goes beyond the AUMF entirely. DOD deems a country or force X a partner for training/advising for reasons that have nothing to do with the AUMF - the Estonian military, say. Can DOD then go after its adversary for defensive strikes?
I put on my website @timkaine letter &amp; explanation of the issue of what limits, if any, exist on exec branch's authority to designate a force its "partner" &amp; then defend it from adversaries who are not congressionally authorized wartime enemies of the US https://t.co/AOoTugTg3b
@gregorydjohnsen I don't think that's the right reading of this issue. This isn't about the stretching of the AUMF to cover strikes against associated forces; it's about strikes against an adversary of a partner even when the AUMF is not even arguably relevant.

I'd distinguish this from something valuable for the public discourse @DavidAFrench also did: he tracked down the long-retired octogenarian judge and asked him, and Pickering said Noel Francisco was his WH contact and he didn't remember knowing BK at the time./9
So that became the narrative meme on the right. I doubt very many of the bottom-feeding aggregators and Twitter commentators clicked through and even knew they were being misled. /8

@RocCityBuilt If you click the link I provided, you will understand that it is known that they targeted Page before getting wrapped up; that connection must be under the adjacent still-redacted parts. https://t.co/VEWt3YGRfX
Some say the Steele dossier was the sole basis of the application. That's false. There are redacted pages of other facts + we can see it cited info from a prior investigation into Russian spies who sought to recruit Americans. (They targeted Page https://t.co/VEWt3YGRfX )/13 https://t.co/pg6ycTfodB
Finally, each renewal application grew by a significant # of pages. Bc of heavy redactions we can't know why for sure, but that dovetails with chatter that the renewals (by Trump-era DOJ), to justify extensions, included discussion of useful info the wiretaps had gathered. /12 https://t.co/N4jiNyDR7r
We also learned the identities of the judges who approved the wiretaps. All were appointed by GOP presidents. (That's not surprising since Chief Justice Roberts, who decides who sits on the FISA Court, has a history of stacking it w/ GOP appointees https://t.co/iyohsNJC3G) /11 https://t.co/PDMdAIn5JI
Democrats in February said that was misleading because the purpose of including the article was instead to tell the court that Page had denied the allegations about his meetings in the July 2016 Moscow trip. And that is indeed how the application presents that material: /10 https://t.co/8L8Avzkqg8
Specifically, the Nunes Memo underlined with emphasis: "This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News." /9
Another big part of the fight was the Nunes Memo's suggestion that the FBI included a Sept. 2016 Yahoo News article as false corroboration of Steele info -- we now know that Steele was actually a source for that article. /8
Part of the complaint is that the court should have been told it was DNC/Clinton campaign, by name, that funded Steele. We see that the practice of FISA applications is to bend over backwards not to name Americans. Here's a renewal "masking" Trump's identity, for example. /7 https://t.co/lBA1eGK2oy
The Dem rebuttal said the court *was* told that the person who hired Steele was politically motivated. We can see that is the truth: the court was clearly told why Steele was looking into Trump-Russia ties. /6 https://t.co/nDerp9Xe2l
Speficially, the Nunes Memo said the docs fail to "disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele‚Äôs efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials." /5
One issue was whether the FISA Court was given enough information about the funding of the Steele dossier to understand that it was campaign opposition research, even if Steele had been a neutral source in the past, in order to decide how much weight to give it. /4
The importance of seeing these docs is that the public can judge for itself whether Devin Nunes and HPSCI Republicans were telling the truth in February when attacking the FBI and Russia investigation on Trump's behalf; Dems said they were mischaracterizing the docs and lying. /3

@trueholygoat @jbouie No, we agree. That's my point. While it's true that the early Trump WH has put more energy into judicial nominations than the early Obama WH did, that factor is minor compared to the presence/absence of filibuster rule, when thinking about their very different records.

Trump WH definitely more focused on appeals court judges than Obama WH was, but primary difference is GOP could filibuster Obama's nominees (&amp; Leahy enforced the blue-slip rule), while Dem senators can't filibuster Trump's nominees (&amp; Grassley tossed the blue-slip rule). @jbouie https://t.co/wxIPLtobIM

This quote from Trump at his Cabinet meeting this morning reflects that road map. https://t.co/trf8OqAaXO
In short, Trump wins either way. If Gee caves or Congress acts, his detention power expands, ending what he sees as an incentive encouraging families to migrate. If not, deterrent of separations resumes but he can say it's not his fault ("my exec order says this isn't my policy")
@Krhawkins5 Not sure what the basis for that would be. Here's the Ninth Circuit in 2016 upholding Gee's ruling that the Flores agreement applies to accompanied minors: https://t.co/JpSGXntw66
...which means Trump didn't really back down or retreat or get out-maneuvered at all. Rather, he used the separations to pressure Judge Gee (or Congress) to expand executive power to indefinitely detain entire families. If they don't, he can blame them when separations resume.
DOJ court filing makes clear Trump admin doesn't think it can hold families together for more than 20 days. Since the admin is determined to detain adults during immigration proceedings, if court or Congress doesn't act in interim, seems likely separations resume in 19 days. https://t.co/Zq8z184DqM

and if so whether the agency would be willing to declassify it. Although the IG report didn‚Äôt mention it, this could also be a factor here, since the CIA is likely unable or unwilling to declassify this non-secret-but-TS/SAP fact since that would break the fig-leaf deal. (7/7)
BTW a related issue that often arises in decisions about whether a 793 leak case is chargeable is whether a judge would rule that the defense needs to be able to talk about the actual evidence (not a CIPA substitution) in open court for a fair trial, (6/7)
OTOH, more details might cut the other way! For ex, was this only discussing the general fact of drone strikes and/or specific strikes that were already widely reported? Or, were any about proposed strikes, i.e. real secrets in function as well as form? (I don‚Äôt know.) (5/7)
So if that is what it is, you can see why State Dept officials might get sloppy and occasionally reference it insufficiently obliquely in low-side email, but also why it might be harder than usual to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the criminal intent standard was met. (4/7)
That universally known fact is deemed TS/SAP bc the Pakistani govt consented to the strikes on condition US would not acknowledge them, providing a fig leaf of deniability. But US officials talk around its edge in unclass settings all the time - it's often literally a joke. (3/7)
Your premise is that this info was unmistakably big-deal secret, as most TS/SAP is. But my understanding is it may instead fall into a murky category of formally highly classified but actually well known: to wit, the fact that the CIA has a drone program in tribal Pakistan. (2/7)
I've been thinking about this too since reading that part of the IG report @dafrench @AndrewCMcCarthy.

And here she is on whether Russia committed election interference, another topic that could put the intelligence community at odds with Trump. Note she agrees with the 2017 IC assessment that said Russia was specifically trying to help Trump win, which Nunes/HPSCI GOP questioned https://t.co/ff2hvkJhc7
Torture dominated the confirmation hearing and lots of senators asked redundant questions, so Haspel never got asked about other big topics. There were some unrelated questions in the QFRs. Here she is on the Iran nuclear deal Trump just abrogated, for example: https://t.co/oKkHsjLyqI
Haspel was also asked about people the agency detained and abused by mistake, mostly famously Khaled el-Masri. Here's what she said: https://t.co/k6nVFXLvT3
The existence of this second Durham report was disclosed by Durham himself in a declaration in a FOIA lawsuit I brought some years ago, as spotted and remembered by @Krhawkins5. https://t.co/YgFS319Nr1 https://t.co/OldTBxb8cl
That report, which Durham wrapped up in 2012, has not been made available to the Senate and I don't know (neither do lawmakers) whether Haspel was under scrutiny for anything she said or did. Obviously even if she was Durham didn't end up charging her. (cont'd)
Finally, there's a new development: I am told that Senate Democrats have asked DOJ to provide to Congress a second, little-known Durham report about whether people investigated in the tape destruction matter committed grand jury perjury or made false statements. (cont'd)
Haspel also explains that when she said she was read into the interrogation program a year after it started, she meant a year after Bush's Sept. 17, 2001, MON (finding) that authorized the CIA to capture terrorists, not a year after it developed its EIT/torture policy.
Haspel says that both of the Nashiri tapes in the trove of 92 videotapes destroyed in 2005 were already not viewable in late 2002, which is why she said only one detainee was on them. So they were among the several that the CIA erased or broke early. She doesn't say who or how.

@WorknCapitalist @chrislhayes @EdWhelanEPPC @DavidAFrench Not a lot of treaties have been nullified so the sample size is small. But yes. For example, the ABM Treaty was signed by Nixon and abrogated by Bush43.

@EdWhelanEPPC @DavidAFrench I'm just pointing out that part of Bush's legacy is presidents can yank the US out of treaties, so the meme that the Iran deal would've been safer if a treaty is wrong. Its only protection either way was Trump's respect for the norm of POTUSes not breaking predecessors' deals.
Appeals Court Bars U.S. From Transferring American ISIS Suspect https://t.co/OsuWPraMCo
The thing is, because George W.

@LizaGoitein is that Zawahiri's group subordinated itself to Bin Laden's authority and became part of AQ (i.e. it was a merger, not just an alliance), &amp; post-UBL internal splits &amp; name changes have not abrogated the USG's legal authority to keep fighting it. /2
@LizaGoitein I will grant that in legal filings the government tends to cover its bases by ambiguously invoking both theories in the alternative (e.g. ISIS is covered by AUMF because it is either part of or an associated force of AQ). But the essence of its analysis /1
@LizaGoitein (Also please when writing multi-tweet thoughts respond to your previous postings each time so the Twitter system will thread them in a way that makes it easy to read them coherently.)
@LizaGoitein You read "including ISIS" as modifying only "associated forces," but it can equally be read as clarifying that the entire phrase "Al Qaeda &amp; assoc'd forces" (i.e. orgs that are AUMFable) includes ISIS. Anyway, bottom line, I'm not making this up based on my personal thoughts.
Another protester starts shouting and is pushed out by Capitol Police. Burr just said that if there were any more interruptions he would ask the police to remove "all individuals," i.e. clear the room.
@LizaGoitein The exception is Al Shabab, which they don't see as part of AUMF-era Al Qaeda, but instead consider AUMFable under associated forces analysis./3
@LizaGoitein They think that even though that entity fractured after Bin Laden's death, its successor splinters, even though they may disagree with each other, and even though AQI changed its brand name, are still the group AUMF covered./2
@LizaGoitein Well, I don't think that is what USG thinks. They think the AUMF covered BinLaden9/11-era AQ, and various groups located elsewhere like AQAP and AQI became *part of it* over time, not associated forces of it. /1
BTW with my colleagues @AllMattNYT @npfandos, under @amyfiscus's able command and control, we are doing live briefing on the Gina Haspel hearing here https://t.co/nsvGc2kGPo
Protester interrupts hearing, shouting "Bloody Gina! You are a torturer!" and is removed.
Haspel laments that torture of KSM cast a "shadow" over huge counterterrorism success of his capture. We don't know whether she had anything to do with his torture, but he asked a Gitmo judge this week for permission to tell the Senate something about her. https://t.co/u5jowMhzyQ
Haspel says she'll obey "the law" but insists CIA "followed the law then," meaning when Bush-era OLC wrote memos saying torture was legal. Asked by Warner what she'd do if Trump OLC issues new "get out of jail" cards, she says she'd do nothing immoral even if "technically legal."
At opening of Haspel confirmation hearing, Senator Burr essentially says let's look forward not back. Long shuttered program conducted years ago already addressed; this hearing is about how you'll lead CIA into the future, not how you faithfully conducted missions in the past.

@EliLake @AriFleischer To be clear, I'm piping up here at @AriFleischer, bc as White House press secretary he defended Bush's abrogation of the ABM Treaty, making a bit precious his RT of your suggestion that Obama should have made the Iran deal a treaty if he didn't want Trump to be able to do this.
@EliLake @AriFleischer No, Carter abrogated a mutual-defense treaty with Taiwan, w/out asking Senate to un-ratify it, as part of recognizing mainland China as the real China. But that was more ambiguous bc presidents do have the power to recognize which govt is legit (via power to receive ambassadors).
@EliLake @AriFleischer Harder why, specifically? What would stop him? The executive power precedent Bush established (building on a more limited and ambiguous one Carter established) doesn't turn on whether a president negotiates the exit or whether there is a good reason to think a treaty is outdated.
@EliLake @AriFleischer There's am idiosyncratic tangent we could pursue if you want to argue that Russia did not legally step into the shoes of USSR for treaties signed before 1991. But that is a distraction from q of whether making Iran deal a treaty would have prevented Trump from pulling the US out.
@EliLake @AriFleischer Remember when Bush43 unilaterally abrogated the ABM Treaty?
@LizaGoitein AFAIK, the only group the executive branch considers to be an "associated force" under the 01 AUMF is Al Shabab in Somalia.
@LizaGoitein I don't think it is right that the executive branch considers the 01 AUMF to cover ISIS as an "associated force" of Al Qaeda, per your associated forces of associated forces thing, It considers ISIS to *be* Al Qaeda, for purposes of the AUMF.

@eScarry @dcexaminer Bad faith. "Those two events had many in the press paring back their predictions for a blue wave."
@eScarry @dcexaminer *March 6 primary
@eScarry @dcexaminer Actually you cite only 2 examples to make your case that the 2 events this week "had many in the press paring back their predictions for a blue wave" -- a line in a WP article and my essay that both predated this week and made no horserace predictions. Anyway, I've said my piece.
@eScarry @dcexaminer 5/ More broadly, my piece was not horserace journalism. It was not a prediction that a wave will or won't happen. It was an attempt to think through how the expectations of a wave are helping to keep the peace &amp; what the consequences may be if one doesn't turn out to materialize.
@eScarry @dcexaminer 4/ -- or to the observed partisan turnout in Texas' March 3 primary. It's just false to cite a piece published before those things happened as if they were a reaction to them.
@eScarry @dcexaminer 3/ I also dispute framing my essay (which I've been thinking about for a long time and started drafting after the Feb 13 SSCI hearing, and which the NYT published on March 3) as a reaction to a poll that Axios published on March 8.
@eScarry @dcexaminer 2/ But I didn't write the headline and the interpretation you're putting on it is the expansive one. So I dispute that "Savage said it was even possible that Republicans 'win' in the midterms, even though the party that controls that White House usually loses seats in Congress."
@eScarry @dcexaminer 1/ Headline a little ambiguous. If one interprets "win" broadly, i.e. "pick up seats relative to last time," that doesn't really fit my piece. But it's ok if one interprets "win" as meaning "while losing some seats, still win a majority of them &amp; so keep control of the House"
@eScarry @dcexaminer I know the online headline over my piece asked "What if Republicans win the midterms?" but I neither said "win" nor discussed GOP picking up seats, as you framed it. I instead weighed a trickle-not-wave scenario, i.e. Dems pick up some seats but fall short of flipping the House.

Nunes Memo's complaint that FISA court wasn't told about Bruce Ohr's contact's with Steele are misleading, Dem memo says, because they post-dated the application and he didn't have anything to do with the investigation anyway https://t.co/ABgQMKofr7

But in the Bush era, the executive branch's claim that the president could detain Hamdi as an e.c. despite being a citizen rapidly spread to the Padilla case. So this bears watching closely. (In Hamdi case, SCt ruled for Bush on AUMF grounds and didn't get into Art II issues.)
Important to note that this claim addresses captures on battlefields &amp; is silent about whether this purported inherent c-in-c detention power extends elsewhere. So Bush-era analogy is Hamdi (captured in Afghanistan), not the far more controversial Padilla (arrested in Chicago).

Thread from last night on the incompatibility of the Nunes memo and the Grassley/Graham criminal referral https://t.co/uMnt6NDPHy
@ChuckRossDC @BradMossEsq I think you are likely overlooking the significance of the word "directly," especially given what we know about critiques of the corroboration claim from others who have seen the application or understand FISA process intimately. See thread: https://t.co/JDObZXnTC9
12) The takeaway appears to be that G/G and Nunes/HPSCI were each trying to discredit Steele and the FISA application in different ways. Ironically, the G/G referral puts forth facts that are incompatible with the Nunes memo's key suggestions, unintentionally undermining it.
11) Or, if Steele never actually told the FBI he wasn't talking to reporters - because of redactions, it's not clear -  then G/G's gotcha is just that the FBI failed to correct the record in subsequent applications when it became clear that it assumed wrong.
10) If so, that would go to his credibility in general, which would go to the credibility of the Trump-Russia info he supplied, and which was used in both the original applications and the extensions.
9) So G/G's complaint about Yahoo article is diff from Nunes memo. The line saying FBI didn't think Steele *directly* provided his info to Yahoo appears off bc Steele later said he talked to Yahoo. G/G suggest Steele may have misled FBI about whether he was talking to reporters.
8) Rather than as corroborating facts, they said, you'd instead put an article like that in an application to show the court that the fact of the investigation to had become public, making it more likely subject would destroy evidence or try to conceal his actions.
7) That makes sense. FISA experts, like David Kris, have told me that no FISA application would include an article citing anon sources claiming the govt is scrutinizing X for purpose of showing establishing X as a fact; the judge would say "you are the govt - tell me directly."
6) Here's that passage. If I am correctly interpreting G/G's telling, then, the court was told Yahoo was indirectly recycling Steele's info, which means it wasn't told that the Yahoo article amounted to independent corroboration of Steele's info. https://t.co/9zJUwJp2QM
5) Rather, G/G referral complains that the application said the FBI did not believe Steele "directly" provided info to Yahoo, which now looks wrong. That is, the FBI was saying Steele's info had indirectly reached Yahoo through an intermediary.
4) Another critique of the Nunes memo was it claimed the Yahoo News article (derived from Steele) was used to corroborate Steele, but that is not why the article was referenced. The G/G memo appears to confirm that it was not presented for the purpose of corroboration.
3) One critique of Nunes memo was it suggested FBI failed to alert court that Steele research had politically motivated origins (thus misleading re neutrality/credibility), but FBI did tell the court that, w/out naming names. G/G memo confirms the alert is in the application. https://t.co/fFAK2aeHKV
2) (Here's the newly released version of Grassley/Graham https://t.co/eSQOn123QM )
1) When Nunes memo came out on Friday, Schiff statement singled out two key claims in particular as "serious mischaracterizations of the FISA application." The newly released less-redacted version of the Grassley/Graham criminal referral re Steele illuminates both. https://t.co/RJV4UW8BuF

@EdWhelanEPPC @SeanTrende So ... ur arg is maybe G secretly changed policy upon Trump's inauguration but it only became clear that he had done so in Nov when he 1st acted on it (putting aside that obv Jan is not when he made the call), ergo candid way to describe this is clarified policy, not changed one?
@EdWhelanEPPC @SeanTrende So that the chain is not lost: https://t.co/6QD6SCbimK
@EdWhelanEPPC @SeanTrende Yes. His policy, both observable in practice and stated explicitly on the record (for example, through his spokeswoman to me in February 2016) was that "absent signoff from both of the home state senators, the nominee does not go forward." https://t.co/kiw0B1VigN https://t.co/rMcRFzgmyy
@EdWhelanEPPC @SeanTrende I think it is not forthright to describe Grassley's current blue-slip policy as "clarified," rather than something like "new," "changed," "revised" or "curtailed." Why not just be straightforward about it? It is what it is.

Rep Chabot (R-OH) lists Mueller staffers who contributed to Dems &amp; calls them biased partisans, Rosenstein says there's a diff btwn political affiliation &amp; bias &amp; says Mueller is committed to making sure any staffer's personal political views do not affect investigation decisions
Asked if political texts/contributions of some Mueller staffers creates appearance of impropriety, Rosenstein says no violation of DOJ rules &amp; special counsel employees subject to civil-service rule that can't take political affiliation into account for career hiring decisions.
To the extent there is any ambiguity about the scope (expansion/clarification) of Mueller's jurisdiction, Mueller has sought and obtained Rosenstein's authorization to do what he is doing, RR says.
Rosenstein said he consults regularly with Mueller and the special counsel is conducting himself consistently with his understanding of the scope of his investigation.
Rod Rosenstein says if ordered to fire Mueller, "I would follow the reg. If there were good cause, I would act. If there were no good cause, I would not." As of today, he says, he still has seen no good cause to fire Mueller.

@PGEddington This is getting repetitive. I've made my point. You can disregard it if you wish. But regardless, thanks again for liberating a better copy of that report! G'night.
@LemonSlayerUS @PGEddington I may go to bed soon but it'll be at this link when it finishes OCRing:  https://t.co/ZTqWbrC78W Unfortunately the way DocCloud works it doesn't become public until it finishes processing - my biggest grip w/ DocCloud. @normative
@PGEddington Deitz is the main player here, not Hayden. He teaches at GMU now.
@LemonSlayerUS @PGEddington I uploaded it to Doc Cloud. It's taking a long time to process but I'll post the link when it's done OCRing.
@PGEddington This is why it's important to interview both sides of a dispute. But in any case there is no dispute about whether the lawyers spiked their idea pre-9/11, as Hayden wrote! Binney, Loomis, Drake all agree they did. They just think the lawyers were wrong &amp; their idea was legal.
@PGEddington deploying the system in a pilot program using *foreign* data ‚â† feeding *Americans'* metadata into it. the latter is was what the proponents wanted to do in late 1999 (&amp; what Loomis was proposing again right after 9/11) and what the lawyers nixed pre Stellarwind/OLC era.
@PGEddington + Here's Loomis complaining that lawyers were still nixing using Thinthread on USP data after 9/11 (but pre Stellarwind), OLC conclusion that nullified the 12333/USSID18 problem, &amp; Hayden re OLC having eliminated the previous legal bar to Thinthread-style USP metadata analysis https://t.co/sMlwDso1CE
@PGEddington I'm going to tweet the relevant excerpts from my book, which includes what the Thinthread proponents said along with what the Deitz and Hayden and the Snowden-leaked draft NSA IG report said. https://t.co/xo0WWwafzY
@PGEddington The point is IG report doesn't support your conclusion. In *2002,* after OLC's post-9/11 bulldozing of legal restraints on surveillance for Stellarwind, lawyers said Thinthread was ok too. They spiked using Thinthread on USP data *pre-9/11*, when conventional law still mattered.
@PGEddington (See Power Wars pp 178-181 and 187 for synthesis of what Binney, Loomis, Deitz, Hayden, etc said about this.)
@PGEddington 2. Don't think this is right. It's true NSA OGC (and DOJ OIPR) thought it would be illegal to use Thinthread on USP data in 2000, as Hayden wrote. If lawyers said otherwise in 2002 (post-9/11 Stellarwind era, when FISA was deemed disposable!) that doesn't contradict his account. https://t.co/KA3Y8LrgUz

@pwnallthethings @marty_lederman @ProfDBernstein @benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman Morrison says Congress can do so for purely executive officers, too. So if it can impose a good-cause-only removal limit on (implicit, not explicit like pardon) removal power, why not a no-bad-cause limit? Q is whether it implicitly did just that with obstruction statutes.
@pwnallthethings @marty_lederman @ProfDBernstein @benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman Does the "crime" angle matter for thinking about this no-bad-cause restriction? Congress *can* enact only-good-cause restrictions on removal power, in which if POTUS is thinking "I don't like him" as opposed to "he's inefficient," the firing is illegal. Same thing?
@marty_lederman @jacklgoldsmith In South Florida, people like to say Miami is the capital of Latin America
@marty_lederman @benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman If there is no Morrison-esque space after all whereby Congress may constitutionally restrict if not eliminate a president's control (via removal power) of an exec official, then it is more likely that obstruction statutes can't criminalize a corrupt firing of a FBI director
@AliWatkins Bush admin did this in 2008 when Protect America Act lapsed. I don't remember it being an issue in 2012 re 702. You may be thinking about a 2014 article re Section 215 Patriot Act sunset &amp; phone logs program, but O admin didn't try to use that theory. https://t.co/cX64gONnJo
I am told that the article on the government's conclusion that the warrantless surveillance program can lawfully keep going until late April 2018, even if Congress lets the FISA Amendments Act Section 702 lapse on Dec. 31, is now opened for comments. https://t.co/BjP5EU92lI
@benjaminwittes @marty_lederman @JoshMBlackman That may be overstated. Conflates clear bipartisan consensus that the old IC statute was a bad idea (&amp; so Scalia's dissent vindicated on policy grounds) with the notion that Rehnquist's abstract legal analysis in Morrison (&amp; Humphrey's Executor) is now widely seen as dubious.
@marty_lederman @benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman that formulation goes too far. presidents direct the government to do things all the time for "political reasons" without it being deemed corrupt, even if it's probably illegitimate on good faith policymaking grounds
@benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman @chongathon sorry the "obv" was too curt - just saying I recognize there is a category of removable abuses of power, e.g. high misdemeanors, beyond acts that violate federal statutes; that wasn't my point
@benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman @chongathon obviously
@benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman That aside, isn't the legal question best framed as whether the obstruction of justice statutes, as applied to a corruptly motivated act of DOJ supervision/firing, fall within or outside the Morrison v. Olson space of permissible congressional limitation of presidential power?
@benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman So is your subs example something more than that? (Your obscenities example seems more like a 25th Amendment issue.) /3
@benjaminwittes @JoshMBlackman On one hand, impeachment is a political act, so arguably anything a majority of the House is willing to impeach a president over is sufficient grounds.

@JulieGammack Manafort's version of this, according to indictment, was to put his foreign income in offshore entities that bought property in US. He then took out mortgages on those properties, so the $ in his US accounts that he was spending looked like loans from banks not taxable income
@DavidCornDC Exactly. Plus just going around on a wild spending spree - let's buy a strip club and a funeral home! let's completely rehab a old resort and build a church! - w/out a clear source for all that $ would create exactly the suspicions real $ laundering is designed to avoid creating.
In $ laundering, you attribute fake *revenue* to a legit cash business &amp; pay taxes on it, allowing you to then safely bank/spend it. The show instead has Marty creating fake *expenses,* pretending he paid for more HVACs, carpets, lumber etc than he actually bought. Ass-backward.

Mattis says Niger deployment was not under the 2001 AUMF, but was a Title 10 train and assist mission.
Tillerson and Mattis agree there is no congressional authority to strike North Korea, but say Trump has constitutional powers in that area.
Mattis says replacement AUMF must have no time/geo limits, urges Congress to maintain nec. authorities to "take our own side in this fight."
Mattis says existing 9/11 (&amp; Iraq) AUMFs are sufficient &amp; shouldn't be repealed, but a new Congressional expression of resolve would be ok.
Tillerson says as ISIS collapses in Iraq/Syria, will seek to burrow into other vulnerable countries, hence need for no geographic limits.
Tillerson says Congress should not repeal AUMF without a replacement in place. replacement should not have time or geographic constraints.
Tillerson says 9/11 AUMF is enough to fight terrorists, plus there's Trump's Article II powers, cites Reagan's 1986 strikes on Libya
Cardin: The 9/11 &amp; Iraq AUMFs have now become mere authorities of convenience for POTUS to conduct military activities anywhere in the world
Cardin: I do not think American people want the US conducting a global, endless shadow war, under the radar, covert, and beyond scrutiny.

@emptywheel because she has no articulable reason to believe that FI or CI will be obtained by her use of that USP selection term.
@emptywheel To clarify I think even if Agent X is trained for raw 12333 sigint, if she queries a USP for routine crime case, it can't ping that database
@emptywheel Maybe wrong but I thnk sharing guidelines prohibit queries by agents working run-of-mill criminal cases frm pinging raw 12333 sigint content
@emptywheel That would make more sense than commingling, as it's just not in their nature to accept externally imposed rules where not necessary
@carwinb What was it about that you found striking?
@emptywheel I thought raw Title I/702 FISA database is separate frm raw 12333 both bc of the sharing guidelines &amp; to keep FISC oversight away frm latter
@emptywheel you think run of the mill crime case queries already ping the 12333 database today, notwithstanding this rule? https://t.co/DLyaCA9Gjk
@emptywheel including e.g. domestic bank bank robbery cases. &amp; w/out any kind of court order to look at hits mandate, unlike the (limited) 702 one.
@emptywheel What I mean is this would seem to require linking the raw 12333 database into the federated search system for every query the FBI does /1

Judge wraps up for the day. Ubben's narrative has reached getting to the CIA annex but it's before the mortar attack. He'll pick up tmrw.
Ubben now describing the initial attack on the mission from his perspective - out by pool when cry of alarm on radio signals something wrong
State Dept Security Agent Dave Ubben takes stand. He helped Wickland escape from Benghazi mission, then wounded in CIA annex mortar attack.
Peter Sullivan, Ambassador Chris Stevens' brother in law, briefly testifies to introduce to record a pic of Stevens meeting w/ some Libyans
@theCCR Redactions don't make clear what it was about, but here's a news article about the Gitmo doc leak. https://t.co/g0pm2nUCJv
FBI file on Michael Ratner of @theCCR, incl report re leaking to CCR of then-classified list of Gitmo detainees https://t.co/wQi6XEobmu
On cross defense tried to plant seeds that maybe attack was an inside job. On redirect prosecution tried to quash doubts. Wickland excused.
Prosecution objected that some of what he knows is hearsay/irrelevant. Judge places some limits on what defense may elicit from him.
In cross, Khattala's lawyer asks about other security threats/suspicions. She wants to introduce thought many could have been responsible.
After Wickland described mortar attack and getting to airport to leave Libya, direct ends.
Wickland describes driving armored vehicle from mission to nearby CIA annex, hit with bomb, sprayed with gunfire, plowing through roadblock
Wickland describes others going into the burning building. Found Sean Smith's lifeless body, couldn't find Stevens, decided to leave.
Wickland is picking up with the narrative of himself taking refuge on the roof of the burning villa and describing how rescuers reached him
Scott Wickland, the State Dept security officer who was with Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith, has resumed testifying.

At Benghazi Trial, Harrowing Testimony and Clashing Views of a Defendant https://t.co/JIn81WZNB7
ICRC says it visited the US citizen ISIS militant who surrendered to Syrian militia &amp; was turned over to US military last month. No details.
Trial is done for today. Wickland's testimony became far more dramatic, describing harrowing experience of the attacks. He'll resume tmrw.
but so far prosecutors have just been using him to ID numerous photos/diagrams etc of the compound so they can be trial exhibits. /3
-- he's the one who got separated in the smoke from Stevens and Smith in burning building, searched fruitlessly trying to save them -- /2
State Dept bodyguard Scott Wickland has been testifying in p.m. session of Benghazi trial. He's got an emotional story to tell /1
Defense Jeffrey Robinson finished opening. Thrust: Abu Khattala being scapegoated. attacks tragic but no evidence he planned/ participated
Crabb finished his opening statement. The thrust: Abu Khatalla didn't personally set fires or shoot mortars but is nevertheless responsible.
Crabb was launching into narrative of the attack as it unfolded but tech difficulties with making a surveillance video play. 5 min recess.
Prosecutor John Crabb Jr. is into his opening statement. Tells jury Khattala was extremist militia leader who hated US, plotted attack
Judge Cooper is now explaining the 18 charges to the jury, including providing material support to terrorism and murder of a diplomat

@MiekeEoyang @ncweaver @Timothy_Edgar @peterswire Since Prism doesn't collect from non-US webmail services, I'm sure they don't want to drop upstream even if it's relatively less important.
@MiekeEoyang @peterswire @Timothy_Edgar from PCLOB 702 report https://t.co/f5sYRIbWTU
@MiekeEoyang @peterswire @Timothy_Edgar it has not been my understanding that routine email chains were what we were talking about when we talked about MCTs but maybe i'm wrong.
@MiekeEoyang I published all the FOIA docs yesterday so my stash is public. Look at the Sept 9 filing starting on pdf 117 https://t.co/sWN3b1tUxP
@MiekeEoyang Granular numbers in FOIA docs show that of a sample of 5081 MCTs (all from upstream!), only 713 were active-user coms; 86% were about coms
@MiekeEoyang Also even if there were MCTs via Prism (&amp; I don't think so), most MCTs came via "about" &amp; Prism never used "about" so ratio still messed up
@MiekeEoyang I don't understand why there would be MCTs gathered via the Prism system and haven't ever heard that suggestion. Why do you think that?
@MiekeEoyang With the added ambiguity that those hypotheticals doesn't account for the problem of some coms being broken into multiple transactions /5
@MiekeEoyang Yes making this doubly weedy, these #s are of historical interest only anyway bc ending "about" collection sharply reduced MCT intake /4
@MiekeEoyang If X=10, total annual 702 collection was 305.79M; upstream was 50.35M or 16.5%	If X=100, total was 544.29M; upstream 288.85M 53.1% etc /3
@MiekeEoyang It turns on the unknown of what the average number of coms in an MCT is /2
@MiekeEoyang Well, that's a suggestion you're imputing, not that I'm making...

@brianefallon Interesting
@brianefallon He could in theory keep the firing protections part of the reg and relieve him of the rest. But this is all uncharted
@brianefallon Of course if it is right he could delegate plenary AG powers to Mueller even tho Mueller isn't Senate confirmed  (unlike Fitz was),
@brianefallon I think he was arguing that keeping Mueller in the reg system, unlike Fitz, gives him greater protection from being fired, so has an upside
@brianefallon I don't agree that that is what he was saying.
@brianefallon Would make it easier to fire him, since the reg says only AG can fire &amp; only for good cause. Bush could've removed Fitz, a US atty, at will
@brianefallon That wouldn't eliminate potus removal power, which is not something Rosenstein can do. In fact taking Mueller outside the reg like Fitz was
@brianefallon She was pressing Rosenstein to delegate his AG supervisory authority to Mueller, as Comey did for Fitz.
No it isn't. She wanted Mueller freed from AG review of maj decisions, like Fitzgerald in Plame leak case. Bush still could've fired Fitz. https://t.co/Kg0eysPKyU

@emptywheel So keeping to the 3/2 wording, and the nicer-sounding reason that he was involved in Trump campaign w/out regard to Russia, saves face
@emptywheel A piece of this may be that Sessions doesn't want to admit that he recused because of exposure of his false testimony re Russia contacts
@emptywheel makes clear that it encompasses both election meddling per se &amp; nature of any links btwn Russia &amp; individuals associated w/ Trump campaign
@emptywheel Right but 3/2 is recusal from any investigation related in any way to the 2016 campaigns, and 3/20 description of the Russia investigation
@emptywheel oh they're still being coy about what Mueller is looking at (i.e. whether obstruction is part of it now)
@emptywheel bc easiest/safest to recycle previously approved wording rather than craft something new when they are still being coy
@emptywheel Seems like not a lot of wiggle room given 3/20 description of the investigation, wording DOJ cleared
@emptywheel Lilely derivative of wording used in early March tho
@emptywheel Simpler: On 3/2, DOJ wasn't publicly saying if there even was a Russia (+links to Trump camp asscts) invest; 3/2 wording reflected coyness

@LizaGoitein @danielschuman We will have to agree to disagree about how to interpret this.

@LizaGoitein @danielschuman (i.e. only the president's sr advisers) with who else can be the 2nd party who is advising the president or his sr advisers /3
@LizaGoitein @danielschuman the issue of who else besides the president himself can be the primary communicant able to invoke the presidential coms privilege /2
@LizaGoitein @danielschuman Espy was deliberative process privilege, not presidential coms. But more broadly I think (maybe I'm wrong) that you may be conflating /1
@LizaGoitein U.S. v. Nixon just speaks of "high government officials." Judicial Watch = DAG convo w/ pardon atty, not direct convo btwn DAG &amp; POTUS, no?

@JameelJaffer 3/ the forn affairs spying use of this - and prob most of CT use by volume too - is going to be mostly foreigners emailing other foreigners
@JameelJaffer 2/ the problem was that transit authority stopped working for forn-2-forn coms with the shift to global use of US-based webmail providers

@emptywheel That could be. This is so basic though.
@emptywheel But the context was Lee suggesting it wouldn't be a problem to remove "foreign affairs" from the permissible purposes of 702 collection
@emptywheel You're interpreting that as that Comey only meant FBI doesn't get FG cert stuff, not that 702 isn't use for FG stuff? ...

@emptywheel @JakeLaperruque Look at the box again, misprint got corrected
@JakeLaperruque Ah maybe confusion stems from an initial typo on IC on the Record look at same box now, not about unique identifiers but CDRs
@JakeLaperruque Not unique numbers. Calls. If you called your mom once a week, that alone would be 260 CDRs, even before any potential duplication..
@JakeLaperruque I think 500 CDR/identifier guesstimate is way too low. We are talking about years of call records. How many calls have you had since 2012?
