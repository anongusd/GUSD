I have nothing against Bernie Sanders. Just as in 2016, if he wins the nomination i will vote for him. I can respect to blocking Maga's, but why block people who haven't made a decision on their Democratic candidate? It makes you no better than trump supporters. Do better. https://t.co/dW31577Y7w

This should be shared over and over again. Can you imagine trump walking through this crowd and laughing and greeting people with a warm smile and a handshake?

@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @politico Pure unadulterated bullshit!
@PressSec @POTUS He offers no solution. He will not get his foolish wall.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump His usual garbage. Wrapping himself in a God he does not honor, a flag he dishonor's  and a military he didnt serve.
@foxandfriends @Varneyco The middle class will see tax increases in four years.
@ebc2017ebc @BretBaier @Comey Delusional Faux News fan. Why don't you try listening, watching and reading a little Comrade?
@BretBaier @Comey You Faux News people are hypocrits. You support a treasonous President who sides with Russia, a sworn enemy of our country
@SSReaney @BretBaier @Comey For God's sake you had investigations against Hillary and her emails and Benghazi with that Ray faced Gowdy.Stop
@ebc2017ebc @BretBaier @Comey James Comet will go down in history as a true American Hero and Patriot.
@GOP Will you please post the date when I'll start having to pay more from your "tax cuts". Is it 3,4 or 5 years?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Would you please quit!
@MeghanMcCain @JayCaruso I still believe 90% of his book is the truth. He overstepped himself with this Haley stuff for sure. I hope!
@GOP Will the employees get their tax cuts every year like the corporations will? Just asking.
@SenateMajLdr @Hostess_Snacks @business Are these businesses doing this every year like the corporations will get their tax cuts?
@foxandfriends Joy Reid was wrong to say that. It was equally absurd for trump to lump all immigrants in with MS-13 gang members.

@foxandfriends @Jim_Jordan Deflectgate at it again. No problem that we have a traitor in the White House who is tearing apart our democracy.
What the world is witnessing is the disintegration of our democracy the it's institutions by trump and Russia. Fact. https://t.co/95yjuoua1C
@IvankaTrump @nypostbiz Why not just raise wages and the employees get a real raise? A one time bonus compared to billions for big corps!
@DLoesch @SecretaryZinke Another crook heard from.
@S4m_sp @ChrisJZullo If you mean corruption by Secretary Clinton, you were one who listened to the game news of the right and Russian bots.
@foxandfriends It's the truth. It's a small price for corporations to pay, one time, for a permanent tax cut for them. Talk about Carrier!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @federalreserve @HHSGov How come all these highly qualified people keep either quitting or being indicted?
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Thank You President Barack Obama!
@DLoesch @CNBC Talk about the employees who lost their jobs at Carrier, the closing coal mines etc. How about a 15dollar minimum wage!
@foxandfriends @TomiLahren Another dumb bleach blond Faux News reporter. Come up with something truthful. How about some facts!
@foxandfriends @TomiLahren Deflectgate is happening at Faux News as we speak. 24/7 Trump Propaganda.
