@TheTruthis10712 @callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr In the event that you don't know what "good night" means when a woman says "goodnight" it basically means no means no.  Google can help with your other questions if you are open minded.  You're welcome. Good night.
@TheTruthis10712 @callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr What I can also tell you is that only 5 % of rapes are reported. Another reason I can't extrapolate on Conservative rapes. Police don't care either.  Rape is rape. Guess what? Sometimes even Liberals rape.  Please feel free to Google stats. p.s. Do you know what good night means?
@TheTruthis10712 @callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr It's literally impossible for me to tell you where the conservative victims are. I did not mention my political affiliation. What I can tell you that yes, even Conservatives get raped.  And even Conservatives can be feminists. But it's not a feminist thing. It's a human thing.
@callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr I think what you mean to say is, of the 150 K students 23 % reported rape. And that's how studies work. They use a small sample size to extrapolate to gen pop.  It's called science, not feminism. I don't know that you are the target audience for this tweet. Good night. Again.
@TheTruthis10712 @callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr I believe I have made my point, and you appear to be deflecting to this problem as a media problem. I presume that's what you mean by "you guys." We don't choose the rape statistics.  We report what they are. They are what they are. You're welcome.  Have a good night.
@callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr As an intimate crime perps take advantage of the very fact it's an intimate crime that can not be exposed. Lastly, I'm a journalist &amp; have covered trials such as #JianGhomeshi and know that rape stat as a fact. Didn't need to pull it. I know it. One victim every 8 minutes. 2/2
@callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr Unfortunately, even with your three points I'm not sure what your overall point actually is. Please clarify? The list is intended for victims, as a message that rape is not their fault.  Yes, most men know not to. Even rapists. That's why they go to such lengths to cover it. 1/2
@callmesomethinn @Blossinator @delaneytarr Perhaps the majority of men know this.  But fact is that by the time it takes you to read it, another victim is born &amp; 1 in 4 women reading it say: #Relatable.  And sadly, perps that choose rape do study how not to get caught and anti rape tips for women. This will help victims.
@cory_estelle @sondrad1212 @delaneytarr What I like about this, and why I RTd, is that it sends one message to victims, the most important message of all: it‚Äôs not your fault.  There are no prevention tips for victims.  It‚Äôs not their fault.  How to prevent rape? Tell perps not to rape. It‚Äôs their fault when they do.

@synthpIay But I won't debate it with you further as you are clearly too closed minded to see what true awareness and acceptance actually is. Acceptance is about acceptance. Not picking and choosing what you can accept. Picking and choosing to suit your agenda is called ableism. Good day.
@synthpIay The word "autistic" is offensive to a vast majority, again you discredit yourself. I was commenting  to warn others, not debate. Those that aren't ableists know we should accept all even those you personally do not like, like autism speaks. THAT'S what the day is about.
@synthpIay It's not about that exact phrase. It's about awareness. I find it quite astonishing you would post a whole rant about why those in the autism community shouldn't be supported on something sanctioned by the United Nations. THAT is ableism.
@synthpIay It was actually the United Nations by General Assembly Resolution 62/139 adopted December 18, 2007 that proclaimed yesterday World Autism Awareness Day, not the organization Autism Speaks. And that's what the light it up blue is all about. It's not about that exact phrase.

@1loriking @JustinTrudeau First, I agree it doesn't all fall on Trudeau but, for me personally, I am tired of hearing what a feminist he is. Feminists take action they do not JUST make pretty speeches. Second, love how hardcore you are and know you are making a difference with your own actions. Respect!

@1loriking @JustinTrudeau and we must be loud for victims too. When we hear these stories we must be their voices when they can not be. We become just as culpable if we don't. It's an act of service for our fellow Canadians to speak without fear for victims. It's a disservice to our country not to.
@1loriking @JustinTrudeau It's in every single office in this country, whether that's a back room of a convenience store run by refugees or the hill. What we need to do is hold our higher folks accountable and support victims. They are afraid to speak. We need to eradicate that too, with love and support.
@1loriking @JustinTrudeau Trudeau knew before he was elected. It is the open secret that nobody talks about. There are things he can do now.  A lot of things. He can influence the decision-makers. And I agree it is not just men. Don't think I said it was, but if I did, my bad. It's everywhere.
@1loriking @JustinTrudeau Well it happens every day. It's not a 10 years ago thing, that is what I am saying.  What does a "harassment framework" that is in progress do for the page or the staffer or the aide that this is happening to today. ZIP.
@CndnSheepdog @JustinTrudeau Preach!!  More would be done to hold perps accountable if more public support was available. Agree 1000 percent. First step is for us to hold up our fellow human.
@CndnSheepdog @JustinTrudeau You are so right. Due to events happening at the global level we have reached a point in Canadian history where we have an opportunity to effect real change, and be global leaders. It is more important than ever before for victims to report and for us to support them. Everywhere.

@Graceann319 @TeaPainUSA @AlanDersh Well I'm not testing Dersh allegations as I have very clearly stated multiple times.  Again, I'm asking Tea Pain, not you, to confirm. When someone is accused of pedophilia, making a joke is not appropriate, nor is silence. But you keep pushing the Dersh agenda I mistook nothing.
@ladyathos @TeaPainUSA @AlanDersh That is not my point. Maybe read my point again. I'm not testing the allegations. I'm questioning TeaPain about his position on how he handles false accusations.
@Graceann319 @TeaPainUSA @AlanDersh Also I was directing my question to TeaPain not to you.
@Graceann319 @TeaPainUSA @AlanDersh Please put names and agendas aside. I'm not looking for evidence against Dersh. I'm addressing the fact that TeaPain said he would make a joke if someone falsely accused him of pedophilia, or worse, ignore the claim. There is nothing funny here.
@TeaPainUSA @AlanDersh I'm no Alan Dersh fan but he's 100% accurate that Claude is a coward and a liar.  But, names aside. You'd really make a joke if someone falsely accused you of pedophilia? Dersh's response is appropriate if he's not guilty. Most would react this way.

@smudboy @lAnonmouslyAnim @oncbtime Your arguments are sound and fair, and prove why net neutrality is so important.  Without it, your ISP decides who says what when, and who sees what when.  It sets a dangerous precedent to lay the groundwork for more restrictions down the road. That's not freedom.
@smudboy @lAnonmouslyAnim @oncbtime Yeah, I hear what you're saying. But as another commentor said, not all geog regions are created equal on this. In corporate America, every day companies risk losing business from one person to get $$ from another. Just how it goes. Sadly. Not about right or wrong, it's about $$.
@smudboy @lAnonmouslyAnim @oncbtime It's not about stupidity. They most definitely are not stupid and will protect and serve their interests before yours.  Read the Terms &amp; Conditions on your contract. There is likely a clause that says they can do that anytime. And they will if they can.

@DylanByers A woman left journalism after a Charlie Rose incident.  God knows how many other have too, because of him, or god knows who else. THAT is the real tragedy of the talent drain.  If you observe anything else I suggest a vision check.
@sarayasin @DylanByers I'm hearing remorse that he got backlash, nothing else.  It's clearly really freaking hard to say which is why it never. Happens. How many victims have said, "I just wanted an apology, to know he didn't think I was just an object to toss aside so his talent could be showcased."
@mcwspeaks @elisabeth @DylanByers Yes. Thank you. https://t.co/riEHl3C15k

No. It's not worth taking stock of. Talented people are a dime a dozen. And so too, obviously, are victims who lie awake at night wondering what's so wrong with them that their talent can't be recognized too. Men that choose abhorrent behavior choose the consequences too. https://t.co/q2Zz8cr5KP
