Final Harper/Nationals take: one cultural weakness the team has is the lack of the one key rival team. Phillies/Braves/Mets all kind of share a bland division rival status. (No one cares about the Marlins.) So maybe Harper-to-Phillies makes that a real rivalry?

After the call, school spokesman says, "Fordham received a follow-up letter from one of Mr. Trump's attorneys summarizing the call and reminding us that they would take action against the University if we did, in fact, release Mr. Trump's records."
"We told the caller that Fordham is bound by federal law, and that we could not/would not reveal/share any records," says Fordham spokesman. (This is the school's policy whether or not you're running for president.) (2/)

@marquettehigh Up until now, thankfully, I had never seen an allegation against a priest I had known or been taught by. I knew intellectually that would change at some point, but reading it is a real gut punch.
@marquettehigh The Jesuit education I got at @marquettehigh and then @fordhamnyc is one of the most important foundations of my adult life, but it's dispiriting and maddening that there's always another shoe dropping somewhere.
Just got an email from the Jesuit high school I attended - @marquettehigh - listing 3 priests accused of sexual abuse over the years, including one who was there when I was a student. 		Transparency is an important first step, but many many more steps are needed.

Ford, continued: "I tried to convince myself that because Brett	did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience."
Ford, continued: "For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys."
More from Ford: "I don‚Äôt have all the answers, and I don‚Äôt remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult."

Not a lot that's brand new here, but the latest sign Democrats view corruption and conflicts of interest as a powerful motivator for voters, and something to frame campaigns around.
Among ideas she has in a new bill:	-lifetime ban on lobbying for lawmakers, cab secretaries	-ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks	-require disclosure of presidential candidates' tax returns
Warren says loss of faith in government is "what leads people to turn away from democracy" and that fed gov currently works for "rich, powerful, and well-connected."
Warren says Trump Administration "are not the cause of the rot. But they are just the biggest, stinkiest example of it."

Yeah.... I am not going to win this matchup. https://t.co/u6VXt8dFGb
@BrandonMOlson Bogus.
As I take on @ninatotenberg in the first round, let us never forget when she paused a live video we were doing to yell at someone nearby to be quiet. (8:55). Remains the highlight of my time at NPR. 		  https://t.co/y4sp5akOYA
Alright everybody, help me take out Duke in the first round. https://t.co/zO6Y1Jy0i0
@JamusLynch @nprpolitics Getting there for sure
üö®important @nprpolitics podcast update: Tyler said yes to the proposal üö® (after this and the couple on their way to have a baby, a little worried about where timestamps go from here.)
@nasu1917b @tamarakeithNPR @DomenicoNPR @NPRone I ate at an eat n park this week - had a cookie of course! and between fracking and politics have probably filed 30 stories over the years from that part of the world
@elliewing @tamarakeithNPR @DomenicoNPR @NPRone This is the first one I think. We had a couple on the way to deliver a baby a couple weeks ago. Not sure which of those is more remarkable?

@rachelnpr Not yet! But I am heading back either way
Pulling over in - where else? - a Sheetz parking lot in between Pittsburgh and DC. to record today's @nprpolitics podcast. We are making sense of Conor Lamb's upset (likely) win in #PA18 and what it tells us about the midterms. https://t.co/HLzePt0PiT

AP hasn't called the race and Lamb campaign isn't declaring victory just yet, but DCCC just put out a statement congratulating Lamb on a win.
Allegheny County Exec Rich Fitzgerald to the Lamb party: "hang in there for another hour or so"
MORE CNN ABSENTEE DRAMA: Washington County official says they're counting absentees tonight, not tomorrow. 1,195 ballots to count.
Lamb room goes nuts at CNN reports he netted 752 votes from the Allegheny absentee. And sending a reporter to the absentee warehouse is paying off big-time for them.
Allegheny County got applications for 4,100 absentees, but doesn't have a hard number yet on how many were returned. But expect to update before 12. Per @905wesa
"Don't Stop Believing" now playing at Lamb watch party, as they cling to a 95-vote lead.
OK friends, according to what Washington County's director just told CNN, my earlier "Lamb is ahead by less than 100 votes" tweet is NOW accurate.
Allegheny County confirms to @905wesa that they expect to report their absentees before midnight.

We are now... incredibly close. Lamb up by less than 100 votes.
So all of Greene County is in and despite their optimism, Democrats did not come anywhere close to winning it. But a much more narrow margin than Trump carried over Clinton.
RT @markdharris: Toomey carried Upper St Clair by ~20, Saccone will lose by at least 10. Crazy
Talking to again from Lamb's campaign party in about 15 minutes on @npratc. Lamb is up, but we're still waiting for results from a key county.
Broke about 70-30 for Trump, but multiple Dems have told me they feel very good about a 50-50 wash, or even winning here tonight. That would be pretty surprising. https://t.co/HUboGj5APl
