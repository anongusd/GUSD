@elonmusk One promethium 147 direct charge nuclear battery can generate 30,000 kilovolt which is 30 Megawatts Islands like Hawaii import 91% of their energy needs guess you see where I am going with this.
@elonmusk If you want a battery powered world you are going about it all wrong, you want atomic batteries, promethium 147 atomic batteries 30,000 KV each connect up 10 in series in Puerto Rico that is 300,000 KV or 300 Megawatts to solve Puerto Rico's electricity needs
