3)it makes me wonder the age of the writers because of perspective. I mean, have you seen Seinfeld (the sitcom)? I'm not feeling that you guys have seen it. Also, @cicgcshow doesn't have to be ALL funny. The Ellen episode was a mix of emotions &amp; let us get to know her better.
2)what a show entailed:  him, a guest, a car, coffee, &amp; conversation. We NEVER expected Seinfeld to ask questions FOR us or take suggestions about his guests. And we like it that way. There are tons of people that haven't been on &amp; it's always interesting to see who he chooses..
1) @washingtonpost &amp; @vulture have reviews out pretty much giving a bad review to @cicgcshow . I'm chiming in as a @netflix subscriber with a good review.  As fan of the show since the beginning, I would note that @JerrySeinfeld was clear from the beginning about...
