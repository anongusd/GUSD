@CleveJones1 @jmarksmywords @realDonaldTrump There is no thoughtful way to end the wars, otherwise they would be over already. Bring the troops home! Perpetual war is not the answer.
@joeycham72 @bdomenech Its mind boggling... Im a lefty and if Trump brings home our troops and stops the wars, he is my man!
@Ultinebe @bdomenech Thats right lefty here that cannot be more pleased about a troop drawdown.
@ananavarro If Trump going loco is him ending our perpetual useless wars i can go for a lot more loco Trump.
@RichardEngel Why are we there? Bring the troops home and let them fight their own war.
@Evan_McMullin Bringing home the troops and ending the wars is more than i ever hoped he would do. Perpetual war is not the answer.
@NickKristof Ending a war as a distraction is only 10 million times better than starting one as a distraction. Finally Trump is doing the right thing by not being presidential. Perpetual war is not the answer.
@LindseyGrahamSC They live there let them fight their own wars. Bring the troops home!
@AriFleischer I never thought i would say it but im with the pres on this one. I have been waiting for a president to stop the wars and if its Trump, then Trump is my man.
@danielsgoldman Why are we killing Syrians? Bring the troops home. Stop the wars. Halt the invading forces. Perpetual war is not the answer.
@JenGriffinFNC Yeah it would just be terrible if we stopped invading their country and killing them in a war no one wants to be in.
Hey my fellow doves, were you also disappointed that Obama never ended the wars? Well now that Trump wants to end them don't turn into hawks on me! If he ends the wars, this lefty will vote him back in during 2020. Country above party. Perpetual war is not the answer.
@realDonaldTrump End the wars and i will vote for you in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump Bring them home!
@realDonaldTrump I have always thought you were a disgrace, but if you end the Afghanistan and Iraq wars as well as withdraw from Syria i will vote for you next election and advocate for you to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

@NCFL42 @mgrcharliecash @RealSaavedra Yeah he is separate enough that all the millions are going to his kids, the ones he still shares bank accounts with, but no one cares if their children are making millions though, so I'm sure he doesn't take any of that money into account when running the country.
@NCFL42 @mgrcharliecash @RealSaavedra Yeah Trump and Trump Inc are definitely separate. All the money that goes to Trump does not go to Trump, it goes to the taxpayers.
