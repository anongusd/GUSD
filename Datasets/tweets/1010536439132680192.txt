Addressing climate change thru policy &amp; regulation is imperative. It must begin yesterday. Earth is dying. 		#GreenNewDeal is masterful yet idealistic. Accomplishing 25% of it's tenets in short order would be a great start w/ much more to come.		Adopting it outright is fiction.
Who has done something to get folks registered to vote? Anyone?		We need a Democratic President, Senate &amp;  House come 2020. 		We need votes to make that a reality.		We'll be able to write our own policies &amp; policy changes if we all work toward the goal of a Democratic whitewash.
Democrats do realize Whitaker isn't going to answer a single question don't they? So the point is.....?
Comparing the #Kavanaugh situation to the Fairfax situation is unfair. We HEARD Dr Ford first hand. All we have with Fairfax is a  third party account. Should it be investigated? Yes. But the Governor still needs to go.

In a discussion re: Guiliani's convoluted statements about collusion by the #Trump campaign, Chris Matthews wrongly described #Trump as a 'politician'. He's not a politician, he's a Mob boss. A very poor one.  A Mob boss's entire list of illegalities isn't proven in 2 short yrs.
Everyone's being too hard on @realDonaldTrump. I don't see what's so hard to believe about everyone in #Trump's campaign all being rogue actors, conspiring w/ Putin operatives, breaking laws, paying for rigged polls, giving out campaign data &amp; lying to the FBI. Makes sense to me.
ALL VOTERS: If your state has Republican Senators, it's imperative you contact them &amp; insist they take a stand against the shutdown. Tell them to demand @senatemajldr McConnell take a vote in the Senate &amp; if #trump vetoes then they vote to overrule. It's that simple. DO IT TODAY!

Great question on @Morning_Joe. Does @realDonaldTrump deserve 4 more years?  Most say no. But more importantly, do WE the people? That's a resounding NO. All Dems, 62% of Swings &amp; some Reds say NO. We deserve better &amp; WE amount to 65-70% say NO. The Trumpians are the minority.
@SenateGOP @HouseGOP We realize you're afraid to speak up against @realDonaldTrump. Thing is, our country will not last another 2 years w/ this president. The last couple weeks have made that clear. SOLUTION: Vote w/ @SenateDems to impeach this president &amp; your worries are gone.
I replied to #Trump tweet condemning his attack on Obama's for having what looked like a brick wall around their home. The WP revealed this to be one more lie as there's no such wall. He duped me..again. I believed him. Consider my ass kicked. ALL statements must be fact checked.

#Trump caters to his base. GOP Congress caters to his base. The 'base' is a 1/3 of the country. A 1/3. Perplexing. He can't win anything w/ a 1/3. Bad strategy. Bad business plan. He &amp; they are clearly lacking in intelligence. #VoteThemAllOut
#Trump has all our allies upset w/ his chaotic behavior. Doesn't he understand that?, experts ask. Of course he does. That's his plan. He doesn't care one bit re: Germany, France, UK, etc. He wants our allies to be Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, North Korea, etc. He has to go.
Everyone making a big deal re: huge numbers of open positions in the WH. Many very important. Experts say no one wants to work for this admin. &amp; say they wouldn't suggest  anyone to do so. Thing is there were huge #'s of open positions since Day 1.  DT wants it that way.
So now it finally comes out. #Trump hasn't visited the troops because he was SCARED OUT OF HIS MIND. Apparently pooped his pants. So scared he couldn't contain himself IN FRONT OF THE TROOPS. It's all about him. Not a word displaying concern for THEM. Unfreakinbelievable.

FACT: No doubt Flynn has explained why it was so crucially important to lie, days into the presidency, about contacts with Russia, knowing those contacts we recorded.
FACT: Mueller redacted almost all examples of Flynn's cooperation &amp; assistance, kept them private from everyone but the judge, so other yet unnamed defendants don't have the benefit of knowing what Flynn told Mueller &amp; others. They can ask questions in which they have the answers
FACT:  Almost certainly, Flynn testified before a grand jury, locking in his testimony which can be used in the future trials of other defendants. 		This gives prosecutors leverage in case Flynn strays off course in the future.
FACT: Flynn provided context &amp; insight about things not spelled out like who was there and what does it mean, to name two.		Language used could have 'inside' meaning or be code &amp; acronyms. Flynn explained all that.
FACT: Flynn provided documents &amp; communications to Mueller &amp; others.		So not just Flynn's statements but cooperation to back them up.
FACT: Flynn's decision to plead guilty &amp; cooperate, affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming &amp; cooperate'.		'Firsthand' is key as it means 'in the room' when activities took place.
FACT: Flynn provided 'firsthand' info about context &amp; content of interactions between transition team &amp; Russian officials.
FACT: Flynn provided assistance into the Russia investigation on a range of issues including interactions between individuals in the Transition team. A "non-exhaustive' summary is provided in the Addendum.
FACT: Flynn provided substantial information in an ongoing "criminal investigation" the details of which are unknown but it's separate from the Mueller investigation.
FACT: Memo has repeated mentions of Flynn's "timeliness' of cooperation.
RT @bjcreigh Me too! She gets to the details and answers all the questions I'm asking but in understandable terms plus has the best personality. I love how she smiles while slicing and dicing public servants that are scum. https://t.co/YMFdsGdybU
FACT: During 1st week of presidency, Flynn was compromised by lying publicly about convo's w/ Russia about sanctions since Russia knew the truth. Danger of blackmail by Russia. Russia then had leverage over Flynn. Was a counterintelligence catastrophe.
FACT: Despite ongoing cooperation in ongoing investigations, Mueller agreed to sentence now due to the speed and level of cooperation thus far.
FACT: 'Downward departure from sentencing guidelines is warranted in this case because of the substantial assistance by Flynn to the Federal Government'.		What, by itself, does that spell, boys and girls? 		T R O U B L E   F O R   D O N A L D
FACT: Flynn's quick decision to cooperate inspired others to follow suit.		FACT: Flynn was intimately involved in the Donald Organization during transition when many illicit activities took place w/ Donald in the know.
FACT: Flynn spoke w/ Kislyak twice about Russian sanctions PRIOR to inauguration as a private citizen. Broke the law.
FACT: The speed, depth &amp; accuracy of Flynn's cooperation yielded him a recommendation of zero jail time.		A signal to others on the fence about cooperating.
FACT: Flynn met with Mueller &amp; other DOJ offices 19 times.		FACT: Assisting w/ three ongoing investigations. 	1- A criminal investigation, not Mueller's 	2- The Mueller Russia investigation	3- An investigation we know nothing about
Turns out there were actually many telling, interesting pieces in the Flynn memo. Yes, details were redacted, but Mueller gave away some very important morsels that should make Donald very nervous. TBC. https://t.co/XjD871zQCd
The Flynn memo's a snoozer. But Senator @tedlieu suggested something none of the other legal pundits picked up on in the massively redacted memo. He said Mueller must feel his job is secure. If he didn't, he would've revealed much more. That's good to hear. Thanks Sen @tedlieu !

@realDonaldTrump says the #Kashoggi murder at the hands of MBS may be fiction. On parallel, he touts a $100 BILLION arms sale that'd create HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of jobs.		Reality check:	The arms deal, as written, would give the US $14.5 billion &amp; 17,500 jobs.		Unabashedly evil.
We need @TeamPelosi more now than ever.		The ever mounting # of investigations to be led by the House will require @TeamPelosi to vitually run solo in the fight for 2020.		Seasoned leadership is a must.
Young people lead the way to correct climate change. An issue literally destroying our planet. Their attempts are noble &amp; appreciated. They'd gain the ears of those tasked with addressing the problem if they just VOTED. If you don't vote, don't complain. It's simply noise.

@WalkingDead_AMC @MichaelKudlitz (Abraham) made his directing debut (ever) last night. It was fantastic. In my top five. The hr &amp; 4 min went by so fast, seemed like 20. Every scene filled w/ surprises &amp; every character shined. A real nail biter. Kudos @MichaelKudlitz. #TWD
@ShinyBoles Because the WORMs are bottom feeders, living under rocks eating dirt.
It's fascinating how stern the Republicans &amp; their leader are regarding the idea of whether the Dems will compromise &amp; act in a bipartisan manner. Perhaps they can show us how to do that. They've been so successful in that regard for the last two years.
Just a thought...In the USA, women didn't get the vote til 1920...98 yrs ago...yet woman are 51% of the population. That 51% only need a handful of men to create a whole new country. Run by that same 51%. War would be just be a memory &amp; racism just a thing of the past.
BOTTOM LINE: Repubs vilify @NancyPelosi because they know she routinely, often amazingly, achieves success getting the Democratic agenda enacted. They're afraid. They're lame right now. She's got a proven track record. This is no time to weaken our newly gained power. Not now.
FACT: Since 1789, there has never been a black woman in any of the 7 leadership positions in the Dem party. That's unacceptable. Black women have lead the charge, for years, flipping federal &amp; state seats. This HAS to change. TBS, Pelosi should remain Speaker for now.

I'm 57. I've never been afraid of any one group. Been fearful of individuals who present a threat of some kind. I'm grateful for that. Am I  naive? Or did my mother just surround our family w/ decent, caring, opened-minded people? I'm now afraid of a group,Trumpians. Very sad.
Tomorrow: 	- pee before you leave the house	- pack water &amp; snacks	- wear comfortable shoes, bring your pumps	- bring two unlikely voters with you	- make sure you have your ID &amp; registration card if you have one	- charge your phone	- in line, ignore rumors you have not confirmed
The ideological difference between Dems &amp; Reds is polar opposite. There's no one left to convince to vote Blue. Our only remaining weapon is massive turnout. Bring it home. Vote Blue, No Matter Who.
In this race, there's no room for compromise. Perhaps after the election we can start to find common ground. That will be impossible if we have no power. Vote, no matter what. Vote Blue, no matter who. We need the Senate too. It not list. We can still do it if turnout if massive.
States like PA don't have early voting. If you live in such a state be prepared for lines, possibly extremely long lines. Make the appropriate plans. No need for research. Vote Blue No Matter Who.
Some states may have rain on Tues. Dems are notorious for staying home when it rains. Our country is literally at risk. Be prepared for rain &amp; lines. Don't give others reason to call us snowflakes. We don't melt, we VOTE! Bring this home. Straight Blue no matter who.
Per @axios Interference is taking  form of ' false flags' claiming Dems are hacking election programming. The mention of this can have the same effect as true hacking. Hacking may be occurring, Russia?, but it's not Dems. Ignore it. Tell friends, family &amp; neighbors to ignore it.

Talk is cheap. It carries no weight. There's no one left to convince to vote Blue. They need to be convinced to VOTE! EVERYONE needs to be responsible at least two people who don't normally vote, TO vote! Therein lies the victory. Til then, QUIET confidence. Let's do this!
I know that sounds crazy, but these people ARE crazy. I think the polls are meaningless. Just like last time. The maps suck. If I'm wrong, I will gladly eat my words. But til then we have to fight like hell. Millennials, Latinos, women &amp; Independents MUST physically vote!
We HAVE NOT won! I'm shocked to hear so many high profile Dems claiming victory! Are you nuts? We should be quietly confident at the most. If it all falls apart on Tues night, whatcha goin' say? Was nothing learned in '16? There're WAY TOO MANY uneducated white folks loving DT!
Many, many voters say they're voting for Reds because of the 'caravan'. And when 200-300 refugees show up at the border rather than 8,000, they'll say what?
I have a bad feeling. Something is going to happen before Tuesday. Something big. Am I just paranoid because of shellshock from '16?	I pray I'm wrong. I've never wanted to be wrong so badly in my life. #VoteThemOut
Millenniums: In this &amp; all mid-terms, every single vote counts, unlike Pres. elections. So please don't think your vote doesn't count. This is ALL about you &amp; your future. YOU will be casting the winning votes. No vote, no win. It's just that simple. Stand up, step out &amp; vote. https://t.co/KsdKBuigAN

Pundits are saying if not for gerrymandering, we'd be taking the Senate too. @BarackObama &amp; @EricHolder cleaned up the map in PA. They are working hard correct the district maps in all fifty states. Another example of Republican highjinx...and right before our eyes.
Is this the result of Russia interference? So the hacking is blamed on Dems &amp; we lose votes because of the perception of US cheating? https://t.co/3Rf5JdySU5
I'm quite tired of hearing how great the economy is. Sure, if you have stocks, if you're wealthy. Unemployment numbers seem great but wages are stagnant. Folks working 2 &amp; 3 jobs. Groceries going through the roof. Gas $3 a gallon. Utility bills go up. What's so great? #VoteBlue
I think it's a mistake for Dem leaders &amp; pundits to announce the Dems will win on Tues. The last thing we need is people not voting because they think it's in the bag. I'm not a pessimist but am gunshy from 2016. DO NOT become complacent. Pretend we're behind. We need every vote.
@SassyKadiK She talks about Susan sometimes especially if she goes on vacation.
@SassyKadiK Pretty sure. LOL. She's mentioned it a few times that I've heard.
@CindyAC_MN_Vote @MSNBC @CNN @ABC @CBS @nbc You're so right. It's frustrating to see every station devoting so much time  to his supporters and never, or rarely, showing Blue supporters. I get sick when I see and hear them. 35-40% of the population agrees w/ DT. I find that horrifying.
DT said he TRIES to tell the truth. Then says he HAS TO lie. Says he wouldn't have won in 2016 &amp; will lose on Nov 6 if doesn't continue his false attacks on the press, immigration, healthcare, taxes, etc. Lie at all costs. Win at all costs. I nearly fainted. He admits it. WTF?
A day or two ago, there was a headline running across the bottom of the screen saying the Saudi's s we're going to announce what happened to #Khashoggi. I never saw or heard another word. Forgotten? Swept under the carpet? Can anyone fill in the blanks for me?
@maddow @msnbc I love Rachel. She sliced &amp; diced DT &amp; the Reds last night w/out changing her even, cheery tone. She's a master of sarcasm without being nasty. She's brilliant. The lies, the dirty tricks &amp; the blatant bigotry is on parade throughout the right. Ignore and #VoteBlue
Get your kids, grandkids &amp; anyone under 29 to follow you. Speaking to millennials over the next 4 days could increase turnout. We need this demographic to show up. We preach to the choir here. Need a broader audience. I'm now being followed by 4 millennials. Expand that to 100's.
@msnbc @cnn @abc @cbs @nbc Airing every word DT says, dozens of times a day, only stokes his ego &amp; pollutes the airways. The lies, the hate &amp; the bigoted views need balance. Why so few clips of Obama, Biden &amp; Oprah? They convey hope. They have a message the other 65% of us need.
We're on the verge of victory. House, Governor's, Attny Generals. As Dems, we have a history of complacency. That cannot happen. Do not, for a second, believe we can win w/out you. We can't. Gerrymandering has narrowed our road to victory. Every single vote counts. #VoteThemOut
ATTN: 18-29 YR OLDS. We are poised to take the House. If we do, DT won't be able to pass legislation w/out Dem support. None. YOU are the key. YOU are the gatekeepers. If you've committed to vote, grab 3 friends &amp; make it a social outing. VOTE, then go for drinks or dinner.

The Republicans are desperate. They'r throwing everything they can think of at the wall to see what sticks. We can rip the rug right out from under them if we all do one small thing. Vote. Voting is the tool we have to invoke change. It's really all we have. Use it. #VoteThemOut
Mueller's office spoke w/ Steve Bannon for the second time. This time, about Roger Stone. I find it very hard to believe Bannon actually told the truth. Didn't think cooperation was even in his vocabulary.

For God's sake, VOTE! If the last week of terrorism hasn't moved you to commit to coming out on Nov 6th, do not utter a word when the Reds cream us. They're lying, cheating &amp; blaming everyone but themselves. We need EVERY vote. Please, commit...today...to vote! Bring friends.

Truly. The networks continue to cower when face to face with his lies &amp; inhuman comments. Step up. There's nothing he can do to you. You have the power. Please start using it.

Attempted assassinations of high ranking Dems. A murderous attack on a synagogue. Who cares. Anyone wanna to go to a rally tonight? Trump's invective will be on display. Don't wanna miss that.
We lament about DT, his vicious words &amp; abhorant deeds. We assign human characteristics to him &amp; wonder why it only gets worse. DT is a psychopath. Textbook definition. He's w/out conscience. He's w/out morals. His predilection for neo-nazi's &amp; autocrats will destroy this country
A free press is the building block of Democracy. They need to call out DT's insincere, mocking, divisive language. They need to call out all the lies. Instead, they are still dancing around him as if they're afraid or don't want to be rude. Step up. You're powerful. We need you.

These people are fleeing for their lives. The US is a nation of immigrants. It always has been. Asylum seekers are NOT breaking the law. Why on Earth would @realDonaldTrump send in the military? Ridiculous! These are peaceful people seeking refuge.
16,658 immigrants, all part of families, were arrested in September. These are human beings fleeing for their lives &amp; the lives of their children. They're asking for asylum. They're not asking for hand outs, just a life free of violence &amp; death. Imagine that.

Finally, reporters &amp; broadcasters are finally calling a lie, a lie. When they do, it becomes clear, just as we've always known, nearly every word out of this baby's mouth is a lie. Provable lies. And his supporters believe every word. Do you think they'll ever look back &amp; see it?
Bolton, from Moscow, said Russia interference in 2016 had no effect on election results. So he's a statistician now? That's impossible to calculate. Bolton says no worries about 2018, though never told Putin to stop. Neither he nor Trump say stop. How is that not treason?
@realDonaldTrump's reaction to the immigrants is ridiculous. Send the military? These people are peaceful. Walking thousands of miles to save their &amp; their children's lives. They want nothing more than to work &amp; take care of their family. They won't bankrupt us.
If the migrants are seeking asylum, they are NOT breaking the law. @realDonaldTrump is LYING again. These are people forced to flee for their lives. Most Honduran. Where the murder rate is 338 per MONTH in a country slightly larger than NYC.

@realDonaldTrump says if the Saudi's are guilty of the alleged crimes the punishment would 'have to be severe because it's very very bad'. Who wants to bet the Saudi's will find no evidence of MBS involvement during the investigation of themselves?

@boogaloo_22 @iambrig @CNN We can respect her heritage without respecting her.
So the Saudi"s have been lying for two weeks. Now the Saudi leaders are  'discussing a plan to admit #Khashoggi was killed in botched interrogation'. Discussing a plan. What is there to discuss? No planning necessary. You don't plan the truth, you plan a lie.
Just saw pictures of Mike Pompeo &amp; the Saudi Prince. Oh, they both look so happy. Smiling in every picture. Lots of hand shaking &amp; back slapping. Not a serious face between them. The murder of #khashoggi is apparently a regular riot.

@realDonaldTrump is just so needy. EVERYTHING has to be about him. If not, he's not interested. The ONLY reason Trump likes Kanye is 'cause Kanye said nice things about him &amp; he thinks he'll look good to black voters. If Kanye had or does speak against him, Trump will do a 180%.
In 2012, the Republicans outspent the Dems w/ black $$$ 8:1....8:1. That's $800,000 to $100,000. It's far worse now. Money's always tight. Commmit your allowance for the month or wait on the boots. Donate it to close races and 'must have' races. It should be but isn't different.

One in three women are sexually assaulted. @OrrinHatch brushed off survivors saying 'when you grow up'. Does that apply to the women in his life? There is, most certainly, one or more survivors in his family tree. What would he say to them? He's misguided &amp; out of touch. #VoteNo
When Congress is unable to accept a survivor's story as evidence &amp;  they don't allow the #FBI to talk to accused &amp; accuser, they are saying survivors don't matter &amp; don't bother telling your truth. The Congress! It's an affront to all women. #NovemberIsComing #VoteNo
RT @ProgBeliever Unfortunately, this op-ed is no apology, which is richly deserved. It's an explanation. Regardless of the conditions, he was unable to remain in control, at all. He's clearly partisan. That alone is disqualifying. #VoteBlue #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord https://t.co/AnJyISTK3k
@JohnCornyn say he made his decision to vote no while thinking of the women in his life. They must be so proud. He did everything but call her a liar. Who are these women who think #ChristineBlaseyFord is lying? Perhaps unable to tap into their own experiences. #VoteNo
Republicans wanted her to testify. She was more than credible. Now they say no corroboration. Other victims are just that. I'm wondering why they bothered. Appearances, that's why. No matter her testimony, they were never going to believe her. Its cruel, selfish &amp; repugnant.

There's no way #Kavanaugh would have gotten thru an #FBI interview w/out throwing himself under a bus &amp; they didn't want more information from #ChristineBlasleyFord. So, this is what a 'fulsome' investigation looks like? @JeffFlake? @JoeManchinWV @SenSusanCollins @lisamurkowski
@SenatorHeitkamp"s brother said she listened to #DrFord, said she sounded like so many women she's heard before, listened to #Kavanaugh's denials &amp; made her decision. In a RED state. He said it's the right thing &amp; thinks shell benefit from her decision. Others need to follow.
@SenSusanCollins @lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @JoeManchinWV PLEASE watch @AriMelber on MSNBC. It's a must see. It's the least you can do before tomorrow. #VoteNo #WhyIDidntReport
Again, @AriMelber Retired Justice Stevens says #Kavanaugh"s testimony alone should keep him off the court. I think he knows what he's talking about.
@AriMelber @NSNBC If you can catch the episode that aired tonight (maybe a replay later on?), Watch. Excellent. Worth your while.
@mayawiley on @MSNBC @AriMelber is said that A.B.A. gave #Kavanaugh the Gold Standard in '04. In '06 they downgraded him partly because he showed bias. Even the neural groups say no on the issue of credibility.
Just a reminder (can't find the article)...650 lawyers, law professors, and legal scholars signed a declaration of no confidence on #Kavanaugh. Can't believe that is so meaningless to so many Republicans.
#MarkJudge clearly lied to the #FBI, (there's no statute of limitations in Maryland). It would have been nice if the #FBI could have compared his testimony to that of #Kavanaugh"s. Shoot. They didn't  #+$_(/&amp;'ing talk to #Kavanaugh. Charming.#Fraud
Three people in a room. One was sexually by the other while the 3rd looked on. If you're the FBI and looking for the facts, who you talk too? Oddly they only talked to one of them..who lied. Why? Because @realDonaldTrump didn't allow it. And the truth is swept under the carpet.
I'm looking at a stage of old, white haired,men shouting 'Theres no coroberation!","You've humiliated this man enough". Dr Ford's credible testimony is EVIDENCE! Attempted rapes don't HAVE corroberation yet JURIES everyday convict people of rape with NO corroberation! #Resist

Let's say the whole situation was handled badly. Does that change #DrFords testimony? Change the allegations? No. Get over it. FULL FBI investigation. No limits. #realDonaldTrump told #KenDelanian he put NO restrictions on the FBI!  We'll see.
You are wrong sir. #SenJohnMcCain would NEVER have treated #DrFord the way #SenLindsayGraham and the others did. He would have motioned to nominate someone else! THAT'S the truth! To say anything else is a fabrication. https://t.co/XkQu5EIUxT
Frightening. Creepy. Dangerous. Disturbing. Nauseating. No wonder you like #Kavanaugh so much. You're both 15 year olds stuck in a mans body. #FullInvestigation https://t.co/s7MOv30WDl
Good catch, Ken. We've all been worried this will be a 'shell' investigation w/ the #FBI prevented from following leads. I guess we have it in writing. #NoLimits per #realDonaldTrump https://t.co/IL0iocPkce
#RevAlSharpton just said what I've been loudly thinking: Not sure if the #FBIInvestigation is a 'step up' or a 'set up'. I say its a 'set up' by #realDonaldTrump. He's too calm. Something's up. The investigation is severely limited. #FBI agents frustrated they can't follow leads.
I see how it goes. #JulieSwetnick doesn't get the benefit of an #FBI report because #realDonaldTrump hates #MichaelAvenatti. To hell with her, she's 'not credible' by association? #JusticeForJulie
@MichaelAvenatti I knew this was going to happen. #realDonaldTrump was too smug when he announced the #FBI investigation. I'm sure the #FBI is well aware of #JulieSwetnick would normally investigate her claim immediately. Anyone who thought he was being reasonable was wrong. Obstructionist!
He's limiting the scope! He's got his foot on the neck of justice. There are three 'credible' accusations. If you have not read #MichaelAvenatti 's Declaration, you should. Quite caustic. I smell #OBSTRUCTION ! #realDonaldTrump #VoteNo #Kavanaugh #WhyIDidntReport 2/2
The #obstruction has begun. Trump is not letting the #FBI question Julie Swetnick...the accuser who SAW #Kavanaugh participate in the vile, sexual, drinking activities. It's aleady begun! #realDonaldTrump is NOT allowing the #FBI to follow leads wherever they may go! 1/2
What happens when the #FBI hands over the information they collected to #realDonaldTrump and he does NOT hand it ALL over to the Judiciary Committee? How will we know?  I don't like it. Not one bit. I smell obstruction. #Kavanaugh #VoteNo #MeToo
Apparently #MarkJudge doesn't have to talk to the #FBI. #realDonaldTrump has to get a  subpoena. If he doesn't, then what? Obstruction? Will he allow Ramirez &amp; Swetneck to be interviewed? He determines the scope. Obstruction? My TV's gonna burn out before this is over. #AMJoy
Repub Senators who stand by #Kavanaugh : He swore to you he didn't do it. You say you KNOW him. You'll soon find out you never really know someone, present or past, unless you're behind closed doors w/ them. Look at Dahmer. #Kavanaugh lied. You were played. #MeToo #HearMyVoice
@sjcloobeck I don't understand 'perjury trap'. If you're telling the truth, how can there be a trap? If you're lying, I'd  imagine there are 'traps" everywhere. Truth rises to surface and liars are exposed. Simple. #realDonaldTrump #
@SenJeffMerkley Thank you #SenMerkley. Republicans tried hard not to listen. They had goal &amp; #DrFord was ruining it. Her story transcended time for millions of survivors. Some men still don't get it. We can't wait for you. There's no turning back.  Our voices WILL be heard. #HearMyVoice #MeToo
I'm still struggling with the fact that #Kavanaugh did not listen to #DrFord testify. If he had, perhaps her verbal description would have rang a few bells. How do you dispute an accusation when you haven't listened to the story? #Coward #VoteNo #MeToo
#DanielGoldman said it best. #Kavanaugh was passionate but there was no substance as it related to the question at hand. Indignation is no substitute for the truth. #VoteNo #MeToo
#SenTedCruz tried to put himself above the fray, but no one should forget his endless displays of partisanship. Sorry, Ted. You voted YES yesterday withOUT joining #SenJeffFlake in asking for the #FBI. Still a #realDonaldTrump drone. #VoteBetoORourke
@DonaldJTrumpJr 3) There are lists of women who say #Kavanaugh didn't assault them. I'm sure you could find even more women who'd agree. Irrelevant. The names of women he DID assault won't appear on those lists.
Just to set the record straight: 1) #realDonaldTrump said #DrFord was compelling. He did NOT say she was credible. Big difference. #MeToo #VoteNo #FBI https://t.co/Nxn5findxp
@MonicaCrowley @LouDobbs The little lies will sink him. #Kavanaugh has lied his way into a corner. Even if no smoking gun, perjury will bring him down. The truth reveals itself at the most inoppertune time. #MeToo #FBI
@MonicaCrowley @LouDobbs Theres clearly a pattern. The expanded B.I. will take on a life of it's own. Leads can't be ignored..one leads to another. Witnesses come forward. #Kavanaugh opened the door to all this by continuing to present a choir boy image that just isn't true. #Kavanaugh #MeToo 1/2
@MonicaCrowley @LouDobbs Yes, just like that. What happened w/ the Russia investigation WILL happen here. The scope will reveal the need for expansion because of the rampant string of leads leading to more leads, leading to add'l revelations. It's like mold. #Kavanaugh #MeToo #VoteNo
#FBI is already hot on the trail and coming to a witness near you! This thing is gonna blow sky high! No joke. It's over for #Kavanaugh. All the dirt is gonna hit the fan. Finally. Thank you #SenJeffFlake !!! #MeToo #VoteNo
Experts have been discussing #Kavanaugh 's temperant yesterday, to me, sounded like a 15yr old having a temper tantrum. 'We went to Timmy's house and lifted weights', 'I like beer, do you like beer, #Senator ? ' I wanted a hearing, I wanted a hearing, I wanted a hearing's. Geez.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DailyCaller No one for asked that. Just re-open the #FBI B.I. of the three women who came forward publicly.  How many times must this be explained to you? It's really very simple. FBI scary. Truth come out. No want conclusions. FBI ask questions. Senators decide. Simple. #realDonaldTrump
#SenBobCasey from the great state of #Pennsylvania votes NO to #Kavanaugh. #ThankYou Sen Casey! Trump may have won PA, but  he won't win this. #VoteNo #MeToo
#MarkJudge says he will answer any questions the #FBI has has for him. Will he tell the truth? He's in #Recovery. 10th Step and all that. I guess we'll see...if Trump requests the background check we reopened. This is like a #miniseries.
@Reuters Conscience won out today..at least for now. Let the #FBI do their thing and be done with it. I'm confident the truth will win out. #Kavanaugh will go down in flames.  #VoteNo
Trump says 'I want what's best for the country' but isn't considering a new candidate. Those two statements are contradictory. Both  can't be true. He could give two flying flips what any of us want. It's what HE wants. Period. So...one more lie. #LyingTrump #VoteNo #Kavanaugh
@SenFeinstein #SenJeffFlake came through! He will NOT vote Yes until the FBI investigates. Now it's up to the #realDonaldTrump !! What's HE going to do? If he doesn't TELL the FBI to investigate, it's just one more notch in his belt of obstructionism. He must do it! #DoNotObstruct
@Trmp4u If #SheldonWhitehouse didn't want the truth, he wouldn't ask for the #FBI. Anyone who is lying wouldn't want the #FBI to investigate. Seems Kavanaugh &amp; the Republicans are are the ONLY ones who DON'T want the FBI to investigation. Even the ABA says FBI. So do 70% of the country.
@ClamantisD I think thats an appropriate film clip! #Kavanaugh has looked just like that, dozens of times. At least you get it. Hes guilty as sin. The yearbook entries simply corroborate what #DrFord said. He lied time after time &amp; couldn't even admit extreme drinking. Everyone lies but him.
#ChuckGrassley says the #FBI couldn't find out anymore than they did.  Wow! We don't even need the #FBI!! We can just eliminate them since they're so incompantant because YOUR investigation was USELESS!
@SenFeinstein Ok, that's it. Who needs money or other support to make things right, here? Deja Vu. 27 years later and still the woman is not believed. What exactly don't you believe? NONE of you REALLY know #Kavanaugh. He repeatedly lied. Proveable lies. #VoteNo #SupoenaMarkJudge
You don't have be 100% certain of Dr Ford's account to #VoteNo. You just have to believe that it's possible. A #SupremeCourtJustice MUST be above reproach. He is NOT above reproach. #DrFord gains nothing making false claims. #Kavanaugh has MUCH to gain w/ false statements.
#Kavanaugh couldn't say how many beers are too many. Apparently he needs to look at a chart to answer that. Geez. So you pull out a pocket reference every time you drink? How responsible of you. Bullshit. #Kavanaugh can't remember how many beers are too many.
#DickDurbin was better than Perry Mason. 'Do you want the #FBI to investigate?' 'Uh, um, whatever the committee uh, um, I'm innocent'. 'Do you want the FBI to investigate?' 'Uh, um, I asked for a hearing, um, uh.,' Ship sunk. #SubpoenaMarkJudge #VoteNo
@DrChandraMittal 90% of what #Kavanaugh said was about the effect, listen carefully. Very very little else. Could not answer the Dems questions about his life 36 years ago. Thou dost protest too much. #FBI #MarkJudge #VoteNo
#CarrieSeverino has lost her mind. Again with the '#DrFord is confused. NO ONE forgets the person who assaulted them...sexually. I haven't. No woman has. Especially if the assaulter is known BEFORE the assault. No confusion. Never forgot. Indelible. Scorched. Imprinted. Forever.
Prosecutors across the country are mystified why an eye witness, #MarkJudge, has not been questioned by the #FBI. A Republican staffer isn't equal to a visit from the FBI. It's becoming clear a cover up is underway. #Graham and Co. can't chance the FBI uncovering more accusations
@RealDLHughley Thank you! I've been saying that for 10 days! Why no #MarkJudge? Because he knows the truth. Because they want #SCJ and not the truth.
@FoxNews #Kavanaugh was absolutely believable when he described what he and his family have been through. Too bad the rest of his testimony rang false. Bring in the #FBI
@qjurecic @chrislhayes #Kavanaugh didn't listen to Dr Ford testfy yesterday. It's very difficult to hear someone describe in great detail what you did to hurt them. If he had, I believe his testimony would have been quite different. No one...no one..can make that story up. Every word rang true.
@qjurecic @chrislhayes The process sucked. The media became a mob. Even if those things are true, that FACT remains Dr Ford was sexually assaulted. She is 100% certain it was #Kavanaugh. What else is there to say?
@MZHemingway @DonaldJTrumpJr None of that is true. #Kavanaugh is acting like a cornered animal. All the tears and outbursts were nothing more than a feeble attempt at indignation. Looked phony. He was out of control. Unstable. Thou dost protest too much. #VoteNo Bring in the #FBI.
@FoxNews @SenFeinstein Bottom line: Dr Ford answered every single question asked by Dems and Repub's. Kavanaugh refused to answer every question Democrats asked and Repub's grandstanded instead of asking questions. Who's hiding the truth? #VoteNo #KavanaughHearings
Even if everything #LindsayGraham said is true, it doesn't change the FACT that Dr Ford is CERTAIN about WHO held their hand over her mouth! Shame on you, Senator! #VoteNo #Kavanaugh #VoteDemocratic
...my memory of both incidents is like clips in a movie. Short, glaring images of what happened, how I felt, how I got away and how I managed to stuff it all down for decades..1st telling my husband last week. #WhyIDidntReport #VoteNo #kavanaugh #ChristineBlseyFord
I was sexually assaulted twice. I do not remember day, date, month or year...I was about 13  assault was in the summer...I was in my bathing suit. I vaguely remember the place of the 2nd assault but not the 1st. I do not remember what happened before or after the assault....1/2
OMFG....#RachelMitchell just questioned if Dr Ford was coached on taking a polygraph! She DID NOT! Yeah, this is all a big scam!  Give me a break! Dr Ford is honest as newborn baby.
Excellent point. He may explain it as 'horseplay', if he can muster a modicum of courage, and admit something happened. https://t.co/yo2wtP3JAI
@PoliticalShort @DonaldJTrumpJr So you have personal knowledge of Dr Ford's travel habits? You have no idea what idiosyncracies she's developed as a result of being attacked. What a silly statement.
#VoteNo It's 10:34 and Grassley is already lying...
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump #VoteNo Women, anyone for that matter, do NOT ask the FBI to investigate if theyre lying. That alone is telling.  Why doesn't Kavanaugh want his name cleared? Very suspicious.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump I fail to understand who, after yesterday's press conference, thinks Trump's great.  He's a lunatic. Rambling, lying, babbling, lying, incoherent, lying. He seemed either drugged or manic. Its  frightening.  He's weak, and that makes him dangerous. Re-elect him? Watch your mouth.
#realDonaldTrump  And the rant continues.  Looks and sounds like he's taken medication.  His mouth is dry.  He can't focus.  He's rambling.  Maybe manic? Something is clearly not right.
#realDonaldTrump has gone off his rocker!! Is anyone listening to him?  Has babbling and babbling.  Nonsensical.  It's actually quite frightening. I'm I'll.
@billmaher @MMFlint That's why this election is so important. Get rid of Republicans. They're out of touch, cruel, and in many ways and anti-American, pro-Crony.  #VoteDemacratic Bring the soul back to America.
#Kavanaugh handed over his calanders from 1981 forward. Who wants to bet the calenders come back to bite him in the ass? #KavanaughSinksHimself. #VoteNo
I wonder how long it will be before one of the women #Kavanaugh hired or one of his basketball players will come forward. It's ALL come out now.  Three and counting...
A 3rd accuser? I'm not even a little surprised.  #Kavanaugh did it once, was never punished and so continued to do it throughout his life.  He sees nothing wrong with it.  He also believes it's impossible for a man to rape his wife. So there ya go.
If #RachelMichell has spent 25 years prosecuting sexual offenders and representing survivors, I would guess #Kavanaugh is in big big trouble since the truth is on Ford's side.
The Fox interview reaffirmed my belief that #MrsKavanaugh knows EXACTLY what these women are talking about. Perhaps SHE should be put under oath. We could just add her to the growing list.  There's still 21 1/2 hours for the Republicans to come to their senses. #WithdrawKavanaugh
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe and the beat goes on.... #VoteNo
Trump just got done saying there are many things going on behind the scenes with he and Kim Jung UN that no one knows about.  Really.  Really?  And why are YOU, Mr Trump, the only one allowed to know what those 'things' are? Will you be sharing any time soon? #realDonaldTrump
@BettyBowers @MalcolmNance No matter what is said or done, most of the Republican Senators on the Jud Comm except Kennedy are too old to 'get it'. It's useless. Don't waste time trying. Solution: Vote them out!! Not just in 2018 but in every future election! They need to go!  #VoteNo
I imagine Trump will feel vindicated when the world starts referring to the US as the 'Trump Regime'.  It's coming.  Between creating a skeletal staff at the DOJ and foreign policies that are isolating us, we are in extreme danger. #votedemocratic
@SenFeinstein #voteno #kavanaugh Aren't the Republicans obstructing justice by not calling witnesses or having even a cursory investigation?  If not, why not?  If so, can't Dems do something?
@SenWarren #voteno #kavanaugh Memories fade, details sketchy, but no woman 'forgets" who sexually assaulted her. Its pushed down, out of mind... shame, guilt, ebarassment follows.  But if given oxygen, the memories become clear. INVESTIGATE now!  The truth will become clear.
#voteno #kavanaugh As survivor myself, I can assure you, no matter how drunk, a woman will never forget or misidentify a man/boy/guy who sexually assaults them. Doesn't happen.  Kavanaugh is a creep.  He was and still is.  Ask his wife.  She's a survivor too, I'd bet.
@morningmika STOP ASKING WHY NO FBI INVESTIGATION!  Are you dense!! They don't WANT the truth. #knowyourvalue but give the Republicans the benefit of the doubt? #voteno #kavanaugh
@morningmika #kavanaugh #vooteno I'm so angry with you, Mika! You actually asked Kasey why they won't do an FBI investigation. Geez, Mika.  They don't WANT the truth.  They want he said/she said.  You honestly don't know that????  Know Your Value...but only sometimes?
#kavanaugh  #voteno. The Republicans could have done TWO FBI investigations by now!  They don't want the truth!  #subpoenamarkjudge
@chucktodd IWasShocked by your interview with Seen Perdue!  You KNOW they should being calling witnesses if the Repub's want the truth!  He danced danced, and danced and you just curtsied!  Coward!
#subpoenamarkjudge. #grassley must subpoena Mark Judge or this kangaroo court will look worse in the history books than the #Anitahill farce.
#kavanaugh If the hearing is Thursday, there is time for an FBI investigation.  NOW what's the excuse? #cowards
#UN #ohnoTrump is chairing the UN Assembling meeting next week?  Will that be televised?  Is there any point in hoping he won't embarrass us?
#supoenamarkjudge This is a fraud. There is a victim, there is an accused, and there is a witness.  Supoena him!
@FoxNewsSunday @LindseyGrahamSC Everyone needs to be under oath.  Judge doesn't want to testify, subpoena him.  He opened the door. You've made no attempt to get the truth, Senator, and you know it.  You don't WANT these people under oath.  But Dr Ford does. Why is that?
#kananaugh  Kavanaugh wrote the deeply explicit questions asked of Clinton in the Lewinsky debacle. Now, while HE was being prepped at the WH this week, Kavanaugh got antsy answering explicit questions or refused to answer cause too personal. Hmmm.
RT @RepSwalwell: It’s NOT her fault. It’s NOT her fault. It’s NOT her fault. It’s NOT her fault. It’s NOT her fault. It’s NOT her fault. It…
@MalcolmNance Has Trump begun the process of eliminating the DOJ and replacing it with something that looks more like the KGB?  And is Rosenstein just the next victim of this plan, with Mueller  right behind him?  Trump gets all the protection he needs if he can pull it off.
@maddow Thought #2.  Perhaps the motive for the constant, never ending, bashing (and worse) of the DOJ by Trump is to, step by step, replace the DOJ with something that looks and acts more like a KGB.  He'd certainly have protection then.
@maddow Thought #1.   If you go back and look at Mrs Kavanaugh during the hearings, she avoids direct eye contact and displays a forced, painful looking smile.  I have a feeling Mrs Kavanaugh knows exactly what Professor Ford went through. The past has a way of repeating itself.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Everyone should go back and look at Mrs Kavanaugh during the Kavanaugh hearings.  She could not look anyone in the eye and her smile was absolutely forced.  I have the feeling Mrs Kavanaugh knows exactly what Professor Ford went through.
@realDonaldTrump Who's obstructing justice NOW?  You are sir, by not allowing an investigation before Dr Ford testifies.
@realDonaldTrump That's where you're wrong sir.  NO ONE wants it speedy.  In fact, NO ONE wants them released at all.
@SenatorCollins Shame on you Seen Collins!  Ford derserves a follow up investigation!  An impartial collector of facts! You know this.  You MUST, and your Reb colleagues must ask Trump to do a background investigation.  Why hasn't he? Sen Collins, he's afraid of what they find!
@kellysueb ...and she's intelligent, Ford knows that a repeat of 1991 is around the corner and is trying to level the playing field.  Who in there right mind is going to come before 12 angry Republicans including those who thinks she's confused..no woman gets 'confused' about sexual assault
@kellysueb You nailed.  I agree Ford needs to testify but we need a non-partisan investigation BEFORE you question Ford and Kavanaugh.  That's a no brainer.  Shame on you Joe and Mika....especially Mika.  Ford's delay in coming forward is completely normal for victims....1/2
...she finally asked, 'Who can stop him?'....Trump...from declassifying...emails, texts messages, etc...just some lil' ole' national security stuff...and making them public.  Clearly no one's minding the daycare.  SOMEONE has to stop this man!  It gets worse on a daily basis!
I never really liked Stephanie Ruhle...not that I ever gave her a chance but I've been watching her for about a week and very often she is the only one to ask the question no one else is asking and the one I'm yelling at the TV.....today,, after listening to 8 hrs of news....
@realDonaldTrump Really? Really?  Too late.  Everyone knows your a racist and a bigot.  You're under fire from all directions so now you're looking for a friend in Hispanics?  Does that include Mexicans? Puerto Ricans?  Anyone from Central or South America?  You're fooling no one.
@isnt_it_rich @xmegganrose @ElizabethPride4 @realDonaldTrump Even after all the horrific tweets by our fearful leader, this one takes the cake.  He's a fool.  He can't think past his nose.  These people died because of drinking unbottled water and health care issues.  Both could have been solved if the hospital ship had been used and......
@realDonaldTrump ....stop living in the past!  There's a hurricane on top of us right now!  Stop whining and do your job.  If it's too much for you I'm sure we can find someone who lives in the present, focuses on the job in hand and stop LYING.
@realDonaldTrump Of course people died in PR after the storm.  Most of the 3k died from lack of water and health care.  Water sitting at airports and a medical ship that was never used!  DUH.  Isn't there someone in the WH that can explain this to our fearful leader?.....
Do you ever stop lying?  Ever?  One word....would, wouldnt,....doesn't change the tenor of the entire conference.  You threw everyone but Putin under the bus.  Changing one word is not only a lie, it's just one more example of the hole you keep digging....deeper please.
@realDonaldTrump
.....thinks it's best to just eliminate that silly little position.  Who needs Cybersecurity?  One more brilliant idea by our low IQ, morality lacking, Putin chasing, lying President.  Sickening.
@realDonaldTrump Why on Earth would Trump not only fire our Cyber Security Coordinator, but the position was eliminated completely!  Our election was arracked in 2018.  Our Intel sources tell us the attack is on-going and threatening the 2018 election.  But Trump......
So I guess the 'fake news' now includes Fox too since they've all voiced their disgust as well. https://t.co/zl4t8zXpHE
@lisamurkowski Please vote no to the SCOTUS nomination unless a vow to uphold R v W.  If not, it may take a month, or year or two or five but Roe will be gone...bit by bit.  You know it, Sen Collins knows it.  Find the strength and courage to do the right thing. We need you.
@SenatorCollins If u vote for SCOTUS nomination, R v W will be lost..little by little til its gone.  You know that's the truth.  Please. Vote your heart.  Vote no.
@realDonaldTrump We weren't at war in 2016 either, so you've done nothing to prevent war N.K. In fact you just gave them your blessing to continue growing.  You have to go.
I see absolutely no way for anyone or any group to help those already depoted without their child(ren).  I see no scenario in which anyone with at the White House or Capitol will ever come up with even an inkling of how to fix that horrendous part of this problem.
@Morning_Joe 	The USShould use vaious mediums,,,,TV alerts, billboards, etc IN Mexico telling those folks who got debited without their child(ren) should return to the US and the US will reunite your family and take asylum applications where necessary.
Lie after lie and yet 42-45% of this country have clearly lost their minds and don't seem to understand WE HAVE A LIAR FOR A PRESIDENT.
@realDonaldTrump 	I'm so weary of spending my alone time during the morning listening to what lies Trump has told since I listened the previous morning.  I won't stop watching or listening because I'm interested and very concerned about our country.
@Morning_Joe 	What can someone like me do to join the ranks of those people fighting any one of the policy's Trump is implementing and fraying the fabric of our democracy.  It's very frustrating watching, hearing and reading about the undoing of our country and feel helpless.
@POTUS44 My heart, mind and spirit are still with you as I drag myself, day after day, through this terrifying, lie-filled, cruel, incompetent and autocracy driven time in our history.  I will go to your website and see what I can do.  With Love and Respect. S
