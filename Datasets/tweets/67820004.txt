Could it be that there it's not a question of good cops and bad cops, but of bad cops and worse cops? #SamDubose
If good cops are majority, then they have demonstrated a lack of concern over cop abuse, and outside intervention is needed... #SamDubose
IOW, if the bad cops are really the controlling majority in the PDs, outside intervention is needed... #SamDubose
OTOH, if bad cops outnumber good cops, the entire police system is due for reform... #SamDubose
If good cops far outnumber bad apples, why don't they band together to run the cowboys out of their ranks?... #SamDubose
We can break that argument down 2 ways... #SamDubose
The whole good cop myth is disintegrating. Arg is that vast majority of cops are good &amp; a few bad apples ruin everything... #SamDubose

I seem to remember seeing Bobby Flay on Chef du Jour. One of the few that could actually handle the format. B nice to see a "best of" retro.

Harvest Christian Fellowship (Greg Laurie) is about a mile away from us. They're right next to the airport, so think they'll be ok.
I'm back. Smoke plume plainly visible & directly upwind frm us. Fire in sort of bowl-like depression-Hope they'll be able 2 contain it there
