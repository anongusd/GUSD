@SenhorRaposa I think Bristol is more likely to vote for Trump in 2024 because Plymouth is more Republican but Plymouth County‚Äôs type of GOP is establishmently, while Bristol County is very WWC and populist. But I just don‚Äôt know if Trump winning BC is likely, if he didn‚Äôt win it in 2016

@OfficialClayyy @deedahnjr @EricPerless @davidagordon9 @BenScionti I think Iowa can be competitive potentially too; Dems won a majority of congressional votes and 3/4 of the congressional districts, and Vilsack is toying with running
@MNortonBaker @_BlueGeorgia_ @Yukongold1898 Missouri is more elastic so to speak. Indiana wouldn‚Äôt elect strong Dem candidates (Bayh and Donnelly for senate, a former state house speaker for governor), but MO just elected a Dem auditor and Kander was within 2 points of winning Mo-Senate last year.

I disagree- Dems need only to pick up two/three seats to get majority (depending on who wins pres/Vice pres, as two would tie senate), and could pick up ME, CO, IA, NC, AZ, and (to stretch) Ky (w/ Beshear or McGrath for Dems). GOP has 2 opportunities - AL and MI(a stretch) https://t.co/EAcEDEieRs

@_BlueGeorgia_ I agree with senate and house completely, but wouldn‚Äôt President be tossup or tilt D? Dems have good advantages in WI, MI, PA (Dems won or hold all state offices in these 3 states excluding US sen. seats) and they now hold more seats than GOP in house from IA&amp;AZ.

The states with the earliest results (7:00) are KY &amp; IN. Just from watching these two races you can get an understanding of the night- if Dems overperform in IN-9 &amp; outright win KY-6, it will be a good night for Dems. If they win KY-6 by +5 pts,  it will be a good night for gop
Probably @LucyWins2018, she got into politics not due to ambition but so that no one was senselessly murdered like her son. She‚Äôs so inspiring and her ads can easily bring someone to tears. https://t.co/WzBHvlEO4V
Sorry for the spam, but while not nationally well known, even compared to house candidates, don‚Äôt be surprised for Sutton (SD), Kelly (KS) or Edmondson (OK) to be the biggest upsetters of 2018. https://t.co/qwbxmdMkpA
If Democrats won a quarter of those, plus win at least half of the following: MN, WI, PA, OH, FL, GA (more traditional battlegrounds) it shows that Dems are far on the offense in regards to issues (gov. candidates aren‚Äôt as affected by nat.l environment)
The House gets all the focus during the midterms, but the Gubernatorial (Governor) elections are just as interesting and important, controlling education and redistricting and the likes. But they are suprisingly fluid- the big story could be Dem wins in SD, OK, KS, and maybe ID
@NateSilver538 GA-7; Democrats have a strong candidate in Bordeaux, and Hillary Clinton won it by 5 points. The district‚Äôs center, Gwinnett county, is chiefly suburban and is majority-minority. Still only one poll for the entire district this election season.
@Nate_Cohn what about a poll for NV-3?
Plus, Marsha is among the house‚Äôs most vocal opponents of net neutrality (sponsored rollback laws, no progress while chair of subcmte on comms) in a state where many rural residents only have 1 provider. She is #2 recipient of telecom. Coincidence? Or just ‚Äústrong leader?‚Äù
A strong leader wouldn‚Äôt cosponsor a bill that made it easier for pharmaceutical corporations to distribute opioids and at the same time weaken the DEA. In a state ravaged by the epidemic. https://t.co/UiCcDNf3DW
With McCaskill voting no, it is that much harder for Donelly, Manchin, Heitkamp, &amp; Tester to vote yes. Besides, Collins is facing low approval ratings, and Flake has reasons to embarrass Trump. If both vote no, which is possible if not probable, Kavanaugh goes down in flames. https://t.co/YoTZhjdgDN

If democrats win AZ and TN w/ NV then they can afford to lose either IN, MO or ND, creating a 50/50 senate split. The net increase of 1 seat would have kept Devos from getting getting confirmed, + sink several (8+devos) gop resolutions/nominations. https://t.co/TmCG3nj4Wn
@NateSilver538 do you think democrats have a chance to win the Oklahoma Gubernatoral Election, with presumptive nominee Stitt leading primary polling but trailing all general election polling to Edmundson? Could OKLAHOMA really be in play?
This poll should horrify Republicans, because Cruz is a fairly good campaigner, and much more popular in Texas than Trump, and O‚ÄôRourke is by no standards a moderate, though the 2020 Dem nominee could be. This race could be a canary in the coal mine... https://t.co/tuHSIiGvmB
