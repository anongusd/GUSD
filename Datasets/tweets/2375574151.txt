This is "a huge area of concern for us because they're being maintained by a non-nation state," Thomas says. "A surprising number of countries" have recently stepped up to "assume the burden" of taking on these fighters, he says.
Whoa, Gen. Tony Thomas just dramatically upped the current public understanding of how many ISIS fighters are currently held by the SDF: "It's actually closer to 1,000 than it is in the hundreds already in detention with more to come."

More Waldhauser on Chinese militarization of Africa: "The Chinese made a conscious decision to start there and it's not going to get smaller." (Djibouti is China's first overseas military base.)  Says Cape Verde and Senegal are other possible targets‚Äîgood location, stable govs.
Walhauser says that he is concerned about maritime access. "The Russians, the Emiratis, the Saudis are all interested in real estate on the African side," he notes. He also adds that the Chinese "own over 80 percent of [Djibouti's] overseas debt and this is certainly a concern."
.@SenAngusKing asks if China is "militarizing" Africa. Waldhauser says "At this point in time it‚Äôs too early to make that leap." Notes China has ~2K peacekeepers and 3K civilians on the continent "so they want to be able to protect their interests &amp; projects they're working on."

Two extremely interesting authorization questions from @timkaine: 		Kaine: Has ISIS west Africa or Boko Harem been designated as an associated force under '01 or '02 AUMF? 	Waldhauser: We don‚Äôt have offensive strike authority in Nigeria, Cameroon, etc. 1/2

https://t.co/ia6gBdABEM
üëá¬†https://t.co/hLgBDf2hcd
This is also interesting: Asked about SOF needs in Africa, Waldhauser says, "What we really need in AFRICOM are some predictable general purpose forces that can do things with regular armies on a somewhat episodic and yet predictable basis." Is this a pitch for an SFAB there?
Faller on SOF: "Our challenge is maintaining [engagement with partner forces across South America]. Our SOF forces are under pressure worldwide." (He notes that those needs to be "habitual relationships keyed off what partner needs."
It's worth noting how heavily Waldhauser and Faller emphasize the role that the State Department plays in Africa and South America. I'm not sure I have this quote exactly right, but Faller earlier said something about how the military needs to be "the small animal" to diplomacy.

Walhauser says that "Boko Harem is the issue in Cameroon," noting that the group is "extremely volatile" &amp; has killed over 20K people‚Äî"some estimates are higher than that." U.S. mission in that region is to train CT forces in northern Cameroon that deal with Boko Harem, he says.
Waldhauser on Cameroon: "The bottom line is they have been a good partnership with us counterterrorism-wise, but you can‚Äôt neglect that there are alleged atrocities. We continue to take our cues from State Dept. Level of engagement will continue but not get out ahead of State."
It gives Moscow not only influence, he says, but also access to valuable mineral extraction opportunities. https://t.co/iRdCsqKORN
Russia is seeking influence across Africa, AFRICOM's Gen. Waldhauser says. In the Central African Republic, he says that Wagner Group has ~175 trainers, some of whom are in President Putin's cabinet. He is "concerned that model might be looked at positively by other countries."
The numbers: https://t.co/mTlwgO88RU
Here are the numbers: As Feb. 4, AFRICOM assesses it has killed 116 al-Shabaab fighters in 2019 ‚Äî 103 in January alone. In Jan. 2018, AFRICOM reported only six were killed. https://t.co/30apgUBhV3
This is a remarkably frank assessment: Waldhauser says that the strikes are serving as a deterrent on al-Shabaab activity, but "it's an open question how much."
Walhauser on the dramatic increase of counterterror strikes on al-Shabaab in Somalia: "At the end of the day, these strikes are not going to defeat al-Shabaab, but they will provide the opportunity for the federal government and the Army to grow."
Waldhauser says he has not seen any "progress" in recovering any more of the schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Harem.
SOUTHCOM head Adm. Craig Faller calls the opioid epidemic "a national security crisis."
across the globe and across issues. we're talking about the opioid epidemic right after we talked about whether the UAE or Djibouti ran a particular Red Sea port better. https://t.co/nWXuASVo6f
https://t.co/PXmBdaCGrc
In fact, Waldhauser says, the Djiboutians have "done a better job and been more efficient than when the Emiratis ran the port." https://t.co/M2yNXWXaeT
He adds that "bottom line" if the U.S.'s access were to be restricted to the port, it would have "significant" impact on American activities in Africa. "That port is one of five entities in the overall Djibouti port and our access there is necessary and required."
"We have the word from president that we will always have access there and they have no intention of selling out to China," Waldhauser said. "Those are his words and his actions so far back that up, so I have no reason not to believe that." Here's what he said last year: https://t.co/3Q01YhcoLo
This is a big deal: Waldhauser says the Djiboutian president has given his "word" the U.S. will "always" have access to Doraleh Container Terminal, a Red Sea shipping port that Djibouti took back from the UAE last year. Senior leaders feared they would give the contract to China.

Inhofe: Of all the comms we have, AFRICOM and SOUTH COM are the most under-resourced. Agree?	Waldhauser: I do agree that we‚Äôre under-resourced.
‚ÄúThe Chinese work at the relationship and that‚Äôs something that we at AFRICOM try to combat by just being good partners," Waldhauser says, noting that 50 African heads of state recently traveled to Beijing (where Xi offered them $$ in grants and other assistance.)
(Inhofe was instrumental in establishing AFRICOM in 2008 as the newest regional combatant command which branched off from U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany.)
Chair Inhofe was a few minutes late and before he dives into his first question he says he was at the National Prayer Breakfast ‚Äî "and I had to choose Jesus over you." And now here we go, concerns about China in Africa in his first question.
Faller in his opening statement says that he is increasingly worried about Russian, Chinese and Iranian influence in the southern hemisphere.

Hey @mradamtaylor, thanks for the shout-out of my story on how Trump's recent public statements on Iraq may impact the future of U.S. forces stationed there! https://t.co/zGhFRKqAWh
Wow. Missed this yesterday. Add that to the PM's statement: "When it is said that the mission of these [U.S. forces] is to fight a neighboring country, like Iran, for example, we reject that notion. The constitution itself prevents us from such approaches." https://t.co/oCJCpLqT4I
@bpmckeon64 Of course‚Äîbut it depends on the chairman. In this case, I'm basing my "open question" assessment on Inhofe's own articulation of how he views his role as chair: https://t.co/RpYoQ0u1io
@NiallStanage yasssss Galileo forever
The president acknowledged that the Islamic State continues to pose a threat even though U.S.-led coalition forces have retaken 99 percent of its territory. https://t.co/2GGBIPqN12
@bpmckeon64 Generally I would agree with that statement, but I think to what extent that committee is going to exercise its political prerogative to challenge the president under Chairman Inhofe is an open question right now.
@bpmckeon64 Yes, the DoD is pretty careful about using ‚Äúperforming the duties‚Äù and not ‚Äúacting.‚Äù
@bpmckeon64 Ah, I see what you mean. 		In that case, the legal question becomes Constitutional, doesn't it?
@bpmckeon64 This was my reporting on it at the time, but if you've got information that contradicts it, I'd love to hear it/have it/know it! https://t.co/qGQ6yKZDLA
@bpmckeon64 And FWIW, a U.S. official told reporters at the time that Shanahan could serve in the post for ‚Äúan indefinite period at the discretion and direction of the president,‚Äù although the official acknowledged that the situation was ‚Äúnebulous.‚Äù
@bpmckeon64 Can you point me to that OGC opinion? My understanding of the argument is that FVRA doesn‚Äôt apply to the DOD because Congress specifically addressed succession in Goldwater-Nichols ‚Äîwhich includes no explicit time limit.
Also seeks to reassure allies and partners that the U.S. isn't abandoning the Middle East: "We will be working with you for many years to come,"Trump says. "I say that unfortunately, but that‚Äôs the way it goes."
"All they have left are remnants. But remnants can be very dangerous," Trump says. Repeats line from #SOTU last night that he looks forward to welcoming home troops in Syria.
Trump acknowledges ISIS cells can regenerate despite the destruction of the caliphate. "You'll always have people that will be around. But we'll search them out and you'll search them out and hopefully they won't be around very long," he says. Big shift from: "ISIS is defeated."

The Iraqi foreign minister is in town for the ministerial, and I would expect this to be a hot topic of conversation. (In fact, the official said one of the themes of the meeting today is confirming coalition ties with new Iraqi government.)
I wrote about the potential impact of Trump's comments and the December meeting on the U.S. presence there last night: https://t.co/hv430LdOzl
The official said that the U.S. is "perfectly justified" in wanting to keep an eye on Iran in Iraq because "places where they are intervening are not exactly examples of good governance." That's *not* how it's seen in Iraq, at all.
The official also said the administration was "surprised" by the uniformly negative reaction in Iraq to Trump's remark that he wanted to keep troops there to "watch" Iran, b/c he had said the same thing in Dec. during his visit. (FYI: This visit was seen in Iraq as a HUGE snub.)
"Al Tanf would be the last place that we would withdraw from," senior administration official says of controversial base on Syrian-Iraq border. "I think that‚Äôs something that has not been scheduled and would be conditions based."

Kaine: If the U.S. where to change its definition of the mission in Iraq to watching Iran, wouldn't it be important to get Iraq to agree? 	Votel: We are in Iraq at invitation of the government, so yes I agree.
Senior DOD officials have been pressed repeatedly since Trump announced the withdrawal on the timeline. Various reports have offered shifting and sometimes conflicting accounts. So this is significant. https://t.co/xYAlR2fUgc
Votel of the Syria withdrawal: "I am not under pressure to be out by a specific date and I have not had any specific demands put upon me." He says withdrawal is neither time-based nor conditions-based, CENTCOM is just executing Trump's orders in a deliberate way.
Votel: "As we move forward, the disposition of Al Tanf will certainly be something that we consider very, very carefully as we look at our overall withdrawal plans."
Votel says that CENTCOM still sees "routine traffic" from ISIS near Al Tanf, calling it "a very good operational location from that standpoint." But, he says, it has a "derivative value" from being on "a principle line of access and communication that Iran would like to exploit."
Votel says disposition of Al Tanf is "a key part of the ongoing planning that we have going [for withdrawal]" &amp; declines to detail publicly. But: "Our reason for being at Al Tanf is principally driven by our defeat ISIS mission. That is what has brought us there &amp; kept us there."

Blumenthal pressed Votel on whether U.S. special operators can do the job as well from Iraq as they can from Syria. Votel acknowledges "it's always best to be with your partner" but "we can achieve the objectives we're focused on" from a remote location.
Votel says bills for fuel, flight hours to KSA have been given to Saudi coalition and he expects them to be refunded. KSA has "given us every indication they intend to" reimburse the U.S. He says he hasn't been notified of any other instances where the U.S. hasn't been repaid.

Under questioning from Wicker, Votel is now defending Afghanistan government's involvement in the talks. Says that US is "very, very early in the process" of Khalilzad "attempting to create a framework." ...
Votel: "Khalilzad's efforts are done w knowledge of the gov of Afghanistan. They are aware of &amp; have supported our efforts to get this process started." Says ultimately discussion must be Afghan-Taliban. NB: there's been reports of concern in Ghani gov that it's being cut out.

Valid question. https://t.co/2eDQLMzuVu
On whether Trump will visit Africa: I expect that we'll be able to talk more about foreign travel in fairly short order, I've asked all the NSC regional directors to give me their recommendations for POTUS travel after Jan 1. I'd expect some announcements fairly soon.
(It's currently in Germany.) (Also, for what it's worth, I asked SASC chair Inhofe about this yesterday and he says he continues to have these conversations with African leaders, pushing for the relocation.) https://t.co/w61SKr0P1R
On whether the admin supports moving AFRICOM to the continent: "I think the Pentagon has been clear that it ought to be in the theater it‚Äôs responsible for... it‚Äôs not unlike where we put regional commands in other contexts, so I think the Pentagon has been right on that."
Bolton declines to say whether this strategy/plan will result in cuts or just a reworking of the foreign aid budget for Africa. He says the budget process is "bottom up" and because they are not quite done with a foreign assistance review "I literally cannot answer the question."
Bolton on 10% cut to AFRICOM forces: Military reallocating budgets worldwide to meet growing range of threats. That‚Äôs why I emphasized G5 in speech. We'd like to empower African countries to do more of their own security in coordination with one another rather deploy US forces.
RT @jmhattem: from what I can tell, Trump's (read: Bolton's) strategy for Africa seems to be a  10-years-too-late and entirely rhetorical/u‚Ä¶
(Worth noting in like graf 3 of this speech, Bolton dinged the Obama administration for not rolling out its Africa strategy until year 4.)
"Africa is incredibly important to the United States. If we didn't understand it before, the competition with China and Russia should highlight it for us," Bolton says, calling this "a turning point."
Bolton says he's not blaming the UN Secretary General, "I'm blaming the Security Council."
"All too often at the UN, establishing the peacekeeping force and deploying it is the end of creative thinking. The mandate is reviewed almost automatically," Bolton says, and the mission continues "ad infinitum."
"I have my views [on the UN], as you know." Yes, Ambassador Bolton, we know.
Also, if you're just dipping into this: https://t.co/TuMdXcVNg4
@OKnox cc @KatieBoWill plz
He warns that the U.S. and the West as a whole needs to "wake up" to China's "comprehensive intervention" in Africa.
"Prosper Africa" is not an aid program, it's based on trade and investment, Bolton says.
Bolton says the goal is independence for African nations. Of the U.S., he says: "We‚Äôre probably the least imperial great power in the history of the world."
https://t.co/IzqhxkFpaH
In keeping with Trump administration foreign relations approach in general, Bolton emphasizes bilateral mechanisms in Africa "to maintain maximum American control over every American dollar spent." (And, of course, plenty of UN skepticism in here).
Bolton: U.S. will also reevaluate its support for U.N. peacekeeping missions. We will only back effective and efficient operations, and we will seek to streamline, reconfigure, or terminate missions that are unable to meet their own mandate or facilitate lasting peace.
On brand: Bolton says in developing the strategy, admin "revisited foundational principles of the Marshall Plan," which he says "furthered American interests, bypassed the UN, and targeted key sectors of foreign economies rather than dissipating aid across hundreds of programs."
Bolton: Should Djibouti hand over control of the Doraleh Container Terminal to Chinese state-owned enterprises, "the balance of power in the Horn of Africa‚Äîa major artery of maritime trade between Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia‚Äîwould shift in favor of China."
the development of a new initiative called ‚ÄúProsper Africa" to "support U.S. investment across the continent, grow Africa‚Äôs middle class, and improve the overall business climate in the region."
Looking at the prepared text for this speech, it's clear the focus of this new strategy is economic. Calls for "encouraging African leaders to choose high-quality, transparent, inclusive and sustainable foreign investment projects, including those from the United States" and...
Bolton: "The United States will no longer provide indiscriminate assistance across the entire continent, without focus or prioritization. And, we will no longer support unproductive, unsuccessful, and unaccountable U.N. peacekeeping missions."
1. advancing US trade and commercial ties with nations across the region to the benefit of both the US and Africa. 	2. countering the threat from "Radical Islamic Terrorism" and violent conflict	3. ensuring that US taxpayer dollars for aid are used efficiently and effectively
There are three tenets to the new strategy, which shifts its focus to great powers like China and Russia first and counterterror second:

Hirono also asks both nominees whether they have every made unwanted sexual advances and whether they have entered into any kind of negotiated settlement related to that kind of conduct. (Both men answer no to both questions).
Hirono says the lack of U.S. ambassadors for Egypt and Pakistan "suggests administration hasn't taken all the steps it should to support diplomacy in the region."
McKenzie says that he believes that getting to a peace settlement in Yemen "require[s] that we remain in contact with both UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
Kaine pushes McKenzie on whether the U.S. military mission in Syria includes being a check on Tehran. McKenzie: "That may be possibly be a derived effect of our presence on the ground but that is not a mission we are undertaking."
Drink! Tim Kaine brings up 2001 AUMF.
Re: Afghanistan... https://t.co/9W0QQlbnPc
McKenzie says Afghan forces are doing the fighting, not Americans, "albeit imperfectly." Then there's the diplomatic effort, which he says has not been done before, "not in the manner we are now...talking directly to the Taliban." 		"Senator, I believe this is a new thing."
Peters pushes McKenzie on what's different about the U.S. approach in Afghanistan today vs. the past 17 years that makes him so bullish:
Sen. Peters asks McKenzie "how far" Afghan security forces are from being able to defend themselves without US assistance. McKenzie: "I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs going to take...I do know today it would be very difficult for them to survive without (US and coalition assistance)."
Multiple lawmakers are asking LTG Rich Clarke about how SOCOM should balance CT mission with the new framework of great power competition under Mattis' National Defense Strategy. Nobody has explicitly mentioned Africa, but this is obviously the #1 case study for this tension.

The standing rules for use of force and mission-specific rules for use of force for troops the border haven't changed, Mattis says. "The rules have. not. changed," Mattis emphasizes.
Have you expanded mission? Mattis: "I'm reviewing that now. If we add missions, we will brief you... as quickly as possible."		Says what has expanded is his authority, not mission. But DHS has to ask for stuff. "I now have the authority to do more, but [Nielsen] has to ask me."
Mattis, asked if he believed the CIA or Saudi Arabia on the Khashoggi murder: "I don't think that had been fully established by either of those."
Mattis on where Kelly falls in the chain of command: "He has the authority to do what the president tells him to do.‚Äù
Mattis: "Theres no violation of Posse Comitatus. There‚Äôs no violation here at all."
On detention: "I would put it in terms of minutes. If someone‚Äôs beating on a border patrolman and if we were in a position to have to have to do something about it we could stop them from beating on them and take them over and deliver them to a border patrolman."
Mattis to reporters: "We‚Äôll look at, what does DHS need‚ÄîI now have that authority. There has been no call for any lethal force from DHS. There is no armed element going in.

MATTIS on what 'backing up' CBP would look like if there's any clash with migrants: "Probably unarmed MPs with shields, batons. No firearms." But he emphasizes that he sees barbed wire is deterrent number one‚Äî"even cows are smart enough to walk through that stuff," he says.
MATTIS just now: "We are not doing law enforcement. We do not have arrest authority. There is no arrest authority under Posse Comitatus for the federal troops‚Äîthat can be done but it has to be done in accordance with the law. That has not been done nor has it been anticipated."

Jubeir says that the suspects in the Khashoggi murder will be held to account in Saudi Arabia‚Äîsuggesting they will not be extradited, as Turkey has requested.
Jubeir on Germany announcing it is suspending arms sales to the Kingdom: He calls the issue "not relevant" and "more symbolic than practical" because, he says, KSA "stopped purchasing arms from Germany several years ago."
In particular, Jubeir argues that Iran is "constrained" under Trump in a way that it was not under Obama.
Jubeir is now lavishing praise the Trump administration's Middle East strategy as "rational" and "realistic," while arguing that "we saw the Middle East unravel" under Obama.
üëá¬†https://t.co/XYwGkc0eVY
The kingdom's investigation is ongoing, he says, insisting that KSA has made it clear that it will hold those responsible for the killing accountable. Right now, he says, it's clear that a "mistake" was made and "authorities exceeded."
MANAMA‚ÄîSaudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Adel Jubeir chides "hysteria in the media" over Khashoggi murder: " I think people have assigned blame on Saudi Arabia with such certainty before the investigation is complete."

Familiar travel diet: I just popped two NoDoze and nuclear-grade heart-burn meds, on top of about 20 cups of Nescafe.
And that's a wrap on Mattis. Go to bed, D.C.
Mattis slips in a little burn of the Obama administration. On how the focus on great power competition has impacted US Mid East strategy: "We are going to continue to stay committed here. We didn‚Äôt pivot in this administration, to put it bluntly. We didn‚Äôt pivot away or towards."
https://t.co/iF6E1DBSCU
Already a little pushback on this. (Many close watchers of the region say this was a destabilizing move.) https://t.co/Y5jRaKSgfI
The move of the US embassy to Jerusalem "was in no way intended to slow the peace process," Mattis says. "It is intended to show the reality of what Jerusalem is. It is part and parcel of how we move forward with the Palestinian situation."
MANAMA‚ÄîSecDef Mattis says that US withdrawal from the INF "does not mean we are walking away from arms control." Withdrawal "actually strengthens the level of commitment because we do not dance round noncompliance issues and look the other way as if everything is fine," he says.
Mattis has not been asked about Khashoggi in the first round of questions he is taking from attendees. He's been asked about force posture given the INF withdrawal, the Jerusalem decision and North Korea negotiations in light of the JCPOA withdrawal.
Veering off his prepared remarks just a little, Mattis emphasizes *again*: "...to remain committed‚Äîand we are committed‚Äî...we are stronger when we work together for peace." https://t.co/Jcdla3blze
In his prepared remarks, Mattis does not announce any change in arms sales policy to Riyadh, a move some U.S. lawmakers have begun to clamor for. The U.S. is still evaluating ‚Äúthe situation," Mattis says.
On Khashoggi: Mattis condemns killing but talks around explicitly naming KSA‚Äîmuch less MBS. Tho he says State "will be taking additional measures," insists US ‚Äúshared security interests with our Arab and Israeli partners remain &amp; our respect for the Saudi people is undiminished."
@JoeUchill you're joking, but an extraordinary number of people I spoke to doing normal travel tasks‚Äîcalling my bank and Verizon, for example‚Äîhad no idea *what* "Bahrain" was, much less where.
This entire speech is peppered with references to the importance of allies and partners; and to U.S. commitments to the region. This speech is pure Mattis as Ally Re-assurer in Chief. Fears are still alive that the Trump America First strategy will loosen U.S. involvement abroad.
MANAMA‚ÄîSecDef Mattis obliquely denies claims U.S. has ceded influence to Moscow in the region, particularly in Syria: ‚ÄúToday, I make clear: Russia‚Äôs presence in the region cannot replace the long-standing, enduring, and transparent U.S. commitment to the Middle East."
Y'all awake in the U.S.? SecDef Mattis is speaking at the Manama Dialogue now. Even as he condemns the Khashoggi murder, he is not explicitly linking the killing to KSA leaders. In prepared remarks, he is emphasizes US security commitments in the region. https://t.co/a4AAty3OYO

Another hugely important unanswered question about the longterm strategy vis-a-vis Iran in Syria... if containment is the goal (although not the stated mission), how many troops would this require? Is the 2,000 American troops currently stationed in Syria sufficient? https://t.co/mIHIrPBrHc
Former Pentagon types have expressed alarm to me before about this kind of strategy in either Syria or Iraq. Some think it will provoke attacks on U.S. forces by the Iranians‚Äîgiven their proximity‚Äîthat will quickly spiral into actual armed conflict.
"A defense official said under the new plan the military would continue to talk about the mission in Syria as counter-ISIS, downplaying the fight against Iran, while the White House &amp; State Department would increase their focus by squeezing them economically and diplomatically."

Reed notes he's seen a "growing elasticity" in definitions of partner forces/collective self defense‚Äîacross admins. "Getting an AUMF today is extremely complicated. As a result you‚Äôve seen more &amp; more legal and policy interpretations over the years that have expanded operations."
I asked Reed if the Trump administration's expansive definition of collective self defense could be used as the legal authority for a counter-Iran military mission in Syria; he said he'll wait to see how the administration is defining 'partner force' to answer that.
Reed con't: "I haven‚Äôt heard anything yet about what‚Äôs the story‚Äîdo we engage or do we disengage?"
Reed 1/2: "At some point the regime will start moving towards the Middle Euphrates where our forces are. The administration hasn‚Äôt stated with clarity, what do we do when it becomes our forces in close contact with regime forces, perhaps supplanted by [Iranian proxy forces]?"
"We do not yet have a coherent longterm policy" in Syria, says SASC ranking Jack Reed. He seems to be asking the same Q I'm hearing from a lot of former Pentagon types and legal specialists in this area. If the U.S. isn't leaving Syria until Iran does, do we shoot at them? Reed:
Reed: "Providing them air defense systems [is] a little bit different than providing them offensive weapons which they‚Äôre using in the region in a way we not only can‚Äôt control but can produce dire consequences."
SASC top Dem Jack Reed suggests a more nuanced framework for the 'do we cut off arms sales to the Saudis over Khashoggi' debate: Are we talking about defensive or offensive? KSA is the target of Houthi missiles and "defending an ally from missile attacks is legitimate," he says.

He notes that the Doe case is working its way through the court system‚Äîbut this is a little misleading, since the US hasn‚Äôt charged him. Doe is challenging his own detention, and the two parties have been negotiating behind closed doors for months. (MONTHS!)
McGurk says that some countries already have taken back fighters (Macedonia is one public example), but declines to answer whether any of the others are European. The Doe case, he says, highlights the difficulty of the problem. https://t.co/igNT3tzIgR
SPE Brett McGurk on the 700 foreign fighters currently held by the SDF emphasizes the return of some of these guys ‚Äúwhere appropriate...home for prosecution.‚Äù (The U.S. has held an American suspected fighter in military detention in Iraq for over a year now without charging him.)
But Dunford says it‚Äôs ‚Äúpremature to speculate‚Äù on what impact the alleged Khashoggi murder could have on mil-to-mil relations with KSA. Says best to wait for Pompeo to return.

CENTCOM commander Gen. Votel just told reporters that he does not anticipate a war with Iran. Here's why we're even talking about that: https://t.co/Mlw3D56DUK

There are an impressive number of people in this room who have a copy of the Constitution in their pocket.
Hagel pushes back on Trump strategy on Iran: How do you think you're going to have more leverage against Iran by pulling Patriots out of the region while making "bullying speeches" against Iran, amidst jockeying with EU allies related to our withdrawal from JCPOA?

Hagel on the value of #NATO to the U.S.: "If we had not had those alliances, we would not have been able to project near the power that America has been able to project since WWII."
Okay, onto #NATO and Trump. Hagel says, "I don't think this president understands NATO. I don't think he understands that our post-WWII order has benefited the U.S. more than any other country on earth."
Me eating the breakfast sammies at @DefenseOne event this morning https://t.co/aGK7VpU1Bz
He talks about being in weekly caucus lunches, and a young senator would stand up and say, let's really go after the Democrats. And Hagel says John Warner or someone else of that ilk would stand up and say, well now, let's wait a minute. And that would put an end to it.
More on the impact of WWII vets in the Congress: "They anchored a civility and decency in the Senate. As you saw them pass from the scene, I think we became loose from our moorings."
Wow. What a poignant remark from Hagel: "Someone once asked me, what's changed in the Senate? It's so bitter &amp; partisan &amp; personal. I think the reason it wasn't [like that in 1996] was because of World War II veterans."
Hagel on what to do when you're serving in an administration that asks you to implement a policy you can't support: "I think it's very simple. When it's a deep enough conflict that you can't resolve the differences, then the honorable thing to do is not to just hang on."
Hagel on serving in an administration: "We all take an oath of office. It's not to a president, it's to a country." But, he says, "You won't agree with the policy all of the time, but in the end, you're expected to play that game and represent the president of the United States."

‚Äú[A]lthough the machinery for the effective operation of the Treaty has no doubt now been impaired by reason of diplomatic relations between the two countries having been broken off by the U.S...its provisions remain part of the corpus of law applicable between the U.S. &amp; Iran."
3. But obviously there's a big disconnect between the reality of U.S.-Iran relations and what the treaty presumes. Here's the court in that same 1980 decision:
2. Some of those cases were decided in favor of the US. In 1980 during the hostage crisis, US successfully argued Tehran violated the treaty by failing to protect U.S. diplos.
(1a. The treaty provides that "there shall be firm and enduring peace and sincere friendship between the United States of America and Iran.")
A few other points about this treaty and the court: 		1. It has been treated as valid by the ICJ in cases since the 1979 Iranian revolution, when the amicable relationship that the treaty assumes ended. https://t.co/Qin3EdvDnP

Pompeo responded to the recent selection of an Iraqi president (Salih) and PM designate (Abdul-Mahdi). "These are people that we know pretty well," he says. Emphasized previous convos with Salih about "building out an Iraqi gov that is an Iraqi gov... not controlled by [Iran]." https://t.co/DJ0VIq7xyq
On the attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Basra and Baghdad, Pompeo tells reporters that U.S. intelligence indicating that Iran is to blame is "solid." 		"We can see the hand of the Ayatollah and his henchman," Pompeo says.
Pompeo notes that he is "disappointed that the court failed to recognize that it lacks jurisdiction" related to U.S. sanctions. https://t.co/6DbI7ZefTx

@StevenJDuffield A goos conversation!
@StevenJDuffield (Or perhaps I should say the factual distinction I was "trying to draw but needed to include more detail to present effectively" in my original tweet. üôÇ)
@StevenJDuffield As a reporter, in general I'm wary of treating "cultural" links as factual cause &amp; effect w/o clear evidence or consensus. It's in theory/opinion world b/c of the Constitutional differences between the venues‚Äîwhich is the factual distinction I was concerned w/ in my 1st tweet.2/2
@StevenJDuffield I understand the arguments related to a "culture" of due process‚Äîbut you could make this argument every time Congress does any one of 100s of things they do that "buck their own processes" on a regular basis. (The example that comes to mind is selectively enforcing subpoenas.)1/2
UPDATED, STILL BREAKING: The 2019 shirtless Putin calendar is here, courtesy of @nohodge. https://t.co/tZREKG4hkY
Breaking, area reporter makes the usual typo with the word "shirtless" and must delete a tweet.
@StevenJDuffield Yes! But it's a totally different‚Äîand inherently political‚Äîbranch of government. So what I don't understand is how the Senate bucking its own self-enforced processes (if we presume that's what they're doing) would damage 'rule of law,' which is the suggestion of the argument?
@StevenJDuffield But the broad use of the term "due process" carries the suggestion that he's legally entitled to the common understanding of "due process"‚Äîthe full protections you would get in a court of law if you were at risk of being deprived of a fundamental right, like your liberty. 2/2
@StevenJDuffield Yes, I should have been more specific. My point is that, as a political body tasked with "advise and consent," the standard is basically discretionary. You can of course argue he's entitled to fairness. ...1/2

3/3 You can argue, if you like, that the Senate Judiciary Cmte should adhere to the standard @KimStrassel is advocating for here. But it's not accurate to assume that if they don't, we will be "losing our most basic protections." The Senate is not a court.
2/3 ...so whatever "due process" he is due is not automatically the same as the "due process" he would be due in a court of law. Courts argue all the time about what constitutes "due process" in various contexts.
1/3 This is a basic misunderstanding of "due process." You get due process only in the fullest sense when you may lose a fundamental right, like liberty. Kavanaugh isn't entitled to a SCOTUS seat &amp; he's not in a court of law that might deprive him of his lib or property unjustly. https://t.co/7BicbFQdqs

RT @DefenseBaron: JUST POSTED: US Official: We May Cut Support for Iraq If New Government Seats Pro-Iran Politicians  https://t.co/od6dBp63‚Ä¶
3/ Right now, I'm taking this with a grain of salt. There's obviously a keen interest in some wings of this administration to 'get tough' on Iran, but there's some practical concerns with this approach. (See #1 and 2. ) And I'm not hearing this threat from other parts of the USG.
2a/ But, of course, here is President Trump just yesterday at the UN: ‚ÄúMoving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends."
2/ When I floated this idea to @UticaRisk and other analysts inside and outside of the USG, the response was basically: Why would the U.S. give up what leverage it has in Iraq?
Okay, so a few things. 1/ This would be a huge escalation of our demands on Baghdad. An Iran-aligned group‚ÄîBadr‚Äîalready controls the Ministry of Interior, which is in charge of policing and border control in Iraq. And the U.S. is going to ask them to give that up?
NB: The official did not specify what kinds of assistance could be cut. The U.S. military trains and assists Iraqi security forces in order to prevent the reemergence of ISIS, plus the U.S. also provides some financial aid for things like reconstruction and counter-IED efforts.
SAO: ‚ÄúWe're going to closely watch who occupies positions of responsibility &amp; evaluate them closely &amp; those that hold strong &amp; enduring relationships w Iran, will make it extremely difficult for us to be able to continue level of support &amp; assistance we‚Äôre currently providing."
Then, a senior admin official told reporters something kind of üßêüßêüßê late last week: If Iran-aligned politicians wind up in any of the *ministerial* posts‚Äînot just the prime minister slot, which is highly unlikely‚Äî"it‚Äôs going to be difficult for us to continue to invest.‚Äù
So, I wrote a story about the Iraqi government formation process. The U.S. is trying to prevent Iran-aligned politicians from having too much influence, but it's not going so well. https://t.co/JfaQncTYlA
In a nutshell, this is how I am hearing Bolton's remark that 'we are not leaving Syria until Iran does' played by other parts of the administration‚Äîthat countering Iran isn't the reason for our presence, but it's a necessary by-product of the U.S. fight against ISIS. https://t.co/aBQv6bmFSe

RT @HayesBrown: Here's that moment where Trump got a laugh out of the #UNGA audience https://t.co/9WYuS3MxpW
Running theme throughout this speech defending President Trump's concept of "sovereignty" is its explicitly transactional treatment of American diplomacy. https://t.co/4cGR7ikYqk
Trump: "Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and frankly, are our friend."
Trump also *blasts* OPEC for "ripping off the rest of the world... and I don't like it." 		Again, explicitly linking security and trade. 		"We defend many of these nations for nothing," he says. "We are not going to put up with it, these horrible prices, much longer."
Trump is riffing a little more now that he's talking about trade, which his administration has often wielded as a national security tool. #UNGA
Trump: "As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority... America is governed by Americans. We reject the idea of globalism and embrace the doctrine of patriotism." #UNGA
Defending tariffs and trade policy, Trump strikes a defiant note: "We will no longer allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens."
@DefenseBaron Kevin! Just answer the man's question! https://t.co/ACECcSHjOB
Trump now making the case that the "for decades, the U.S. opened its economy with few conditions...yet other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets in return." Some, he says, "abused" U.S. openness to dump their products.
We've heard most of this on Iran before... The Iran deal was "a windfall" for Iran's leaders, Trump says, saying that the military budget grew nearly 40 percent and the funds were used to build nuclear capable missiles and finance terror.
I'm just gonna put this in this thread also, for the purposes of displaying self-awareness. https://t.co/B9jQdEmMhC
RT @maxjrosenthal: Quick everyone live tweet the same stuff
Trump urges Geneva in Syria process but reiterates "U.S. will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the Assad regime." (Critics have argued that by putting so much emphasis on chem, the Trump admin has given Assad carte blanche to use conventional weapons to the same end.)
Trump touts "highly productive" Singapore summit and "encouraging" progress since. "I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done. The sanctions will remain in place until denuclearization occurs."
Trump giving a paean to sovereignty, as expected. "The United States will not tell you how to live, or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return."
Trump gets laughs at UNGA with this line: "In less that two years my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country‚Äîso true." He paused and added good-naturedly, "Didn't expect that reaction but that's okay."

That's a resources question, but also a legal one: It's debatable whether international law allows non-state armed groups like SDF‚Äîwhich is not a sovereign government‚Äîto detain people in the first place. But international humanitarian *definitely* prohibits arbitrary detention.
The US has been trying for months to convince the various countries of origin for these detainees to take them back, with limited success. But even though the US has pumped a lot of money into shoring up security to hold these guys, SDF can't hold them indefinitely.
But based on conversations I've had with people familiar with some of these discussions over the last few months, the administration is aware that they will own all of the attendant problems and risks that would come with sending new detainees to Gitmo.
It's hard to know how serious this is. Obviously Gitmo was an option they were keeping open (see the State of the Union) and it's an idea that has some traction on the Hill (see Lindsey Graham).
NBC News, citing 5 US officials and 2 EU diplomats, reports Trump admin is weighing sending some high-value ISIS detainees to Gitmo, including the 2 Beatles. Less valuable detainees (SDF is holding 100s of these guys) would be transferred to Iraqi prisons. https://t.co/jRFi50zqnI

I don‚Äôt really have a complaint here, actually, I‚Äôm delighted that I neither hurled nor got a concussion, I just like, TRUTH IN ADVERTISING, people. /end
The catapult was definitely more intense than the surprisingly smooth trap landing (that was like two seconds or roller-coaster force acceleration). And we did miss the wire on the first try on the landing. BUT NO PART OF THIS WAS ANYTHING LIKE SLAMMING INTO A CONCRETE WALL.
Instead, some very professional pilots and sailors made sure I got on and off the carrier safely in two relatively uneventful fights during which my chief complaint was that my helmet was too tight.
Anyway, people, I am here to tell you: EITHER Y‚ÄôALL ARE ALL A BUNCH OF WEENIES OR I AM SUPERMAN. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO WILDLY OVERPREPARED FOR ANYTHING IN MY LIFE. I WAS BRACING FOR A BRUSH WITH DEATH! AN ADRENALINE RUSH TO TEST MY METTLE.
Basically, I was left to understand that my options were either a) barf or b) barf *and* get a concussion. (I should add, none of these people appeared to be trying to haze the new girl.)
The PAOs were like, ASK FOR A BAG IF YOU FEEL EVEN SLIGHTLY WOOZY. This is the description from Robert Kaplan‚Äôs book ‚ÄúHog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts,‚Äù about landing a Greyhound ON the Abe Lincoln: https://t.co/r33vfksOqN
Before I left, I tried to prepare myself for what this would be like. (They‚Äôre famously sort of rough). MULTIPLE people told me to take Dramamine. @MarcusReports convinced me bad weather would cause us to either crash or be trapped on the carrier for days.
We took a COD flight to get to the carrier, doing a trap landing and a catapult launch to go home. Here‚Äôs some video of the takeoff (I was on the next one). https://t.co/6L99uvPVuS
And now, for my number-one complaint from visiting the USS Abe Lincoln yesterday:
The message basically was: Pay no attention to Ghazni.
Mattis, like Nicholson last week, argues individual battles and other short term military ebbs and flows‚Äîeven ones as fiercely contested as this month‚Äôs assault on Ghazni‚Äîare less important markers of progress in Afghanistan than the Taliban‚Äôs apparent willingness to talk. https://t.co/mKUgYxpV0l

On USS Abe Lincoln Monday to see F-35 trials, reporters tried asking a group of naval aviators what McCain had meant to them. The PAO, who wanted to stay on topic, blocked us from asking the question. Listening to Graham speak just now, I'm regretful we didn't get their answer.
wait I thought bees were all dying?
Lindsey Graham, who is giving an extremely emotional tribute to his friend John McCain on the Senate floor right now, appears to be reading from a hand-written speech.
"What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun." https://t.co/ANqfvz4vYK
Mattis also smacked down the notion that there is ‚Äúany advantage‚Äù to privatizing the war in Afghanistan: ‚ÄúWhen Americans put their nation‚Äôs credibility on the line, privatizing it is probably not a good idea.‚Äù
Mattis on what the route of Afghan forces at Ghazni says about their competence: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you can use this example as emblematic.‚Äù He echoes Nicholson last week: says the Taliban failed in its military objectives.

One other dimension: Coats is talking prospectively about 2018. Mattis is talking about 2016.
It's hard to know what to make of this. Are we talking about nation-state actors? Non-Russians hired by the Russians? Or is this just a trickle-down of Trump's 300-pound-guy-in-his-basement theory?
Mattis was asked to clarify, but his answer isn't totally clear. https://t.co/s0zX5uSIuz
Here's a previous example of this, from DNI Dan Coats. https://t.co/XpDthfULWp
Here's what he said: "We all saw what happened in 2016 when the Russians and *possibly others*, but the Russians for certain tried to do both influence operations and actually get in and actually corrupt some of the election process."
Interesting. Mattis, in a gaggle a few hours ago, just became the latest U.S. official to suggest that there were other foreign actors beyond the Russians who sought to interfere in the 2016 election.

Anyway, one of the big takeaways from @jessicaschulb's super important piece is the incredible diplomatic &amp; logistical challenges associated with negotiating transfer of any of the remaining detainees. This requires administrative will‚Äîand Trump has closed the office responsible.
(Numbers are from this really excellent explainer from @charlie_savage: https://t.co/bjYY4ymnee)
An original six-agency task force evaluated all the detainees, recommending transferring 156. From 2013‚Äîwhen the PRB was born to periodically re-evaluate those not already earmarked for prosecution or release‚Äîuntil Trump took office, it looked at 63 &amp; recommended 37 for transfer.
For one thing, Trump wants to fill up Gitmo with 'bad dudes'; Senate Republicans pushed Trump to suspend the PRB last year; and maybe most critically, what's left are the thornier cases.

There is stuff they can't do without Congress (think services and support, like building facilities, which takes $). So officials plan to make a ‚Äúlegislative proposal for the authorities necessary to fully establish the Space Force" to go to Congress in the 2020 budget proposal.
This could have a huge impact on the Air Force, thanks to some potentially sweeping changes in how the Pentagon buys and develops new satellite technology. The report also calls for a new joint office‚Äîthe Space Development Agency‚Äîto oversee those efforts. https://t.co/EmWI9EYNbc
In addition to getting ahead of Congress, here's who else was out of the loop on the #SpaceForce proposal: https://t.co/d1Pt5RgK8S
The 2019 NDAA orders the Pentagon to create a space command under Strategic Command. Instead, the proposed four-star Space Command will oversee space forces from across military‚Äîsimilar to US Special Operations, which oversees special forces drawn from various service branches.
Per a senior defense official, the report was largely written by Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and by Stephen Kitay, deputy assistant defense secretary for space policy. It responds to a mandate in the 2018 NDAA.
Per @DefenseOne: According to a 14-page draft report set to go to Congress on Wednesday, the Pentagon will establish an eleventh unified combatant command‚ÄîU.S. Space Command‚Äîby the end of 2018.

Okay guys. Here it is. My last story for The Hill, which you will want to read if you‚Äôre curious about what happened with Lisa Page today.  https://t.co/SXEpf8DGws
The Dem side is wrapping up their questions now, so we're looking forward to getting to go home soon...
‚ÄúThe specific questions that Lisa Page answered that Peter Strzok did not heightened my concern that the processes at the FBI were contrived to fit the desired outcomes of people who were biased in favor of Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump,‚Äù said Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).
‚ÄúWe have learned a lot of new information. She has answered some questions that Peter Strzok was not willing or able to answer," said John Ratcliffe (R-Texas).
‚ÄúWe certainly learned additional things today, but I can tell you that the last thing anyone wants to be is falsely accused and her willingness to cooperate today speaks well of her,‚Äù said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).
Multiple Republicans have come out of the Page deposition describing her as cooperative and saying that she answered questions that Strzok would not. Here's some nuggets:

The GOP probe, he says, is focused on what the bureau did in a pair of elections during 2016‚ÄîRussia and Clinton email.
Ratcliffe (R-Texas) tells me GOP investigators will be looking to match up Page‚Äôs testimony with Strzok‚Äôs. He also claims that it‚Äôs ‚Äúno coincidence‚Äù that Page didn‚Äôt want to testify until today‚Äîsuggesting that she wanted to see his answers first.

And that‚Äôs all for now. They have gone into closed session to continue oral arguments. Stay tuned.
She also says that the government‚Äôs position that Doe was not abused while in SDF custody is ‚Äúfairly strong.‚Äù Seems like that claim isn‚Äôt getting a whole lot of traction.
Chutkan acknowledged concerns that the situation in Syria is ‚Äúfluid‚Äù and that what Hafetz described as a ‚Äúpocket‚Äù where USG wants to release Doe might not remain safe.
The ACLU argues that because Doe has no passport and Syria has no consular services, releasing him there would be stranding him in a war torn country with no way to get out. It‚Äôs a transfer, ACLU attorney Hafetz says, and Valentine, Hamdi and Doe all apply.
But government clearly wants this guy off its hands. DOJ lawyer Burnham: ‚ÄúI think the Defense Department has had enough of this.‚Äù
It also argues that releasing Doe in Iraq is not ‚Äú costless‚Äù‚Äîthere are diplomatic costs associated with that. It would involve working with the Iraqi government to negotiate terms and might put us ‚Äúback into the world of transfer‚Äù because they might want to take him into custody.
The government argued that releasing Doe in Syria is not a transfer because there is no custodial transfer on the back end, as there was with the proposition of sending him to KSA.
Chutkan throughout expressed discomfort with giving too narrow of a prescription. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really enthusiastic about making [an] assessment‚Äù about the safety of various options of places to drop Doe in Syria, she said at one point, literally rubbing her temples.
First things first: Chutkan said she expects to rule on the ACLU‚Äôs attempt to block that release within the next seven days. But that will almost certainly not be the end of this story. Chutkan: ‚ÄúI suspect strongly the DC Corcut will be weighing in regardless of how I rule.‚Äù
Okay, Doe v Mattis nerds. I gotcha on today‚Äôs hearing regarding the government‚Äôs bid to release Doe, a US-Saudi citizen suspected of fighting for ISIS, in Syria, against his will.
Standing in front of security at the courthouse and chugging my coffee before I go in for a Doe v Mattis hearing feels like an appropriate way to start my last day at The Hill.

Hearing has devolved into another argument over rules and procedure. Cicilline erupts, "Can you share with us the secret rules that you're making up as you go along?!"
Strzok says he rejects the characterization that he is "refusing" to answer questions.
Gowdy is back to first question of how many interviews Strzok did in the first week of Russia probe, after Strzok apparently consulted with FBI counsel.	 	Strzok: Do not recall, need to check with case officer. 	Gowdy: We waited all that time for that answer? 	Strzok: Yes sir.
Jordan calls it "unbelievable" that Strzok "won't tell me who they are." Strzok says that "there's nothing I would like more than to answer this question." Jordan is talking over his explanations and Dems are shouting that he should be allowed to answer. "Stop interrupting him!"
Jordan is questioning Strzok on messages he sent about the Steele dossier. Strzok says the FBI has authorized him to say he read the dossier as it came in in "parts and pieces" but that he can't answer Jordan's Q about people he names in the email‚ÄîSimpson and Corn.
Here we go. Jordan is up.

Goodlatte also says that releasing the transcript would allow future witnesses to read the questions before they're asked.
Nadler: "We agreed to nothing because we were not asked." (It's important to note Strzok is also calling for the transcript to be released."
Cicilline now says he "intends" to release the transcript if no one gives him a valid reason not to. Goodlatte says there was an agreement in the interview that it was private and confidential and would not be released. Nadler says the minority was not part of that agreement.
Ongoing argument over releasing the transcript from Strzok's closed-door interview. Goodlatte and Rs are saying no, Dems are saying yes. https://t.co/dzkc0ReWyz

Goodlatte cites a jury bias case from 2017‚ÄîPena-Rodriguez v Colorado, that found jury secrecy doesn't apply if racial bias taints deliberations‚Äîbut as Strzok (correctly) points out, that case didn't have anything to do with prosecutor or investigator bias. https://t.co/jI4KZSPtPh
Strzok: "I cannot speak to why Mueller chose to remove me but I can tell you those texts are not indicative of bias... [Mueller] mentioned existence of the texts and based on that he asked that I be returned to the FBI" because of the "appearance of potential bias."

Strzok just gave an impassioned, clear-spoken defense of the FBI. Democrats applauded and banged their fists on their desks.
https://t.co/unyBq7oXZ7
Here's the relevant text exchange Gowdy is hammering on, h/t @pwnallthethings https://t.co/PwvhtuMRck
"I do not have bias," Strzok said. He says his understanding of why he was kicked off of the Mueller probe is because of the perception that his texts would create. He and Gowdy are now talking over one another.
Gowdy is hammering Strzok on the "Hillary should win 100 million to 0" text. "You couldn't think of a single person who would vote for Trump?" Gowdy asks in an extended line of questioning about that text that it is difficult to use any other word for but "theatrical."
https://t.co/hy9rN1E6nk
Goodlatte insists Strzok is under subpoena while Strzok says he believes he is here voluntarily. Strzok says he won't answer Gowdy's question and Goodlatte says that while the hearing will continue, they will recess at the end of the day and the committee will consider contempt.
Goodlatte says that Strzok may consult with his personal attorney, but not with the FBI counsel. Democrats are pointing out that he's still an employee of the bureau.
Nadler moves to adjourn and gets a second. Goodlatte: "You're not recognized for that purpose." Someone asks, "Are we just going to make up rules as we go along?"
Democrats and Goodlatte are straight-up bickering as Strzok sits there quietly.
Here is Strzok's reasoning: "Based on [FBI counsel's instructions], I will not answer that question because it goes to matters related to the ongoing investigation."
Goodlatte threatens contempt proceedings. Nadler tries to make a point of order, which Goodlatte, stone-faced, says is "not valid" and "not well taken." To Strzok, he says: "You have not stated a valid legal basis for not responding to a question from a member of the House."
Goodlatte immediately steps in: "Mr. Strzok. You are under subpoena and are required to answer the question."
Well, it didn't take long for the fireworks to start. Strzok declines to answer a question from Gowdy about the number of interviews done in the first week of the Russia probe, on the instructions of the FBI general counsel.
Strzok on the federal Russia investigation: "This investigation is not a witch hunt. This investigation is not a hoax."

Gowdy in his opening statement is going through various texts, like "insurance policy" and "you can smell the Trump support," and saying, "Strzok thinks that isn't bias."
Ranking member Nadler says it is "beneath" the committee to suggest that Page's decision to defy the subpoena to be deposed this week means she has something to hide. "Can we not be decent to our witnesses, Mr. Chairman?"

Update, new way of pronouncing "Rosenstein" from Gutierrez: "Ross-en-steen." (Rosenstein has apparently said both "Rosen-STINE" and "Rosen-STEEN" are correct but his close family goes with "stine.")

@ReutersZengerle Support. cc the Horse Caucus.

My short wrap on Jordan v Rosenstein: There was finger-pointing, people emphatically snapping their mics off, Dems yelling, a normally mild-mannered DAG calling a member of Congress 'deeply wrong' + public laughter at a Rod zinger aimed straight at Jordan. https://t.co/DChk5KQiiq
Meanwhile, here's the whole Jordan exchange on subpoenaing "phones." https://t.co/AgAyq5olVf
The Meadows resolution passes, 226 to 183.
And after that *extremely* contentious exchange, they have just recessed to go to the floor to vote on the Meadows resolution.
More from Jordan-Rosenstein: https://t.co/F7KRCLOHIv
"There's no way to subpoena phone calls, Congressman," Rosenstein says to Jordan, who is pressing him on a press article. Loud laughter from Democrats.
Finally, a very frustrated Rosenstein to Jim Jordan: "Your use of this to attack me personally is just wrong."
Extremely combative exchange with Jordan, who starts off with "Why are you withholding information from Congress?" Rosenstein denies. Jordan repeatedly talks over an extremely tight-faced DAG‚Äîsparking attempts to intervene from Democrats.
https://t.co/xmL17zmIZl
Gowdy to FBI director Wray and DAG Rosenstein on the Mueller investigation, fiercely: "Whatever you got, finish it the hell up, because this country is being torn apart."
We have Benghazi Trey back today. v firey.
Also, something from DeSantis I failed to tweet in the moment: https://t.co/2k1svj35d2
Rosenstein says he doesn't anticipate the IG will find anything wrong in his approval of the Page FISA warrant application, which is currently under review by Horowitz. (Some GOPers believe he's withholding documents to protect himself on the FISA issue.) https://t.co/vnZI057ctN
Rosenstein says he "disputes [the] characterization" that the Carter Page FISA order authorized the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign. But largely declines to speak about FISA in public, earning more ire from Gaetz.
Gaetz is pressing Rosenstein on the timeline of the start of the investigation and on Bruce Our/Fusion GPS/FISA. At one point, Gaetz reclaims his time as Rosenstein is saying 'it's important for you to understand‚Äî' and Rosenstein reluctantly looks down, clearly annoyed.
Lofgren asks Rosenstein about the allegations that he "threatened" staff of the House Intelligence Committee. Smiling a little grimly, Rosenstein says, "People make all kinds of allegations. In my business we ask who‚Äôs the witness and how credible are they... The answer is no."
As has been astutely pointed out to me by a colleague, he's hammering on the Stefan Halper stuff while sitting five feet from Trey Gowdy, who has said the use of a confidential informant was appropriate.
DeSantis up first, asks Rosenstein about any Obama-era "spying" on the Trump campaign. Rosenstein declines to speak in open setting, but says "We are working with oversight committees to produce all relevant evidence to answer those questions."
'tyranny of the news cycle' is a turn-of-phrase I can really identify with https://t.co/lPMcmqFLYP
Wray says that FBI has "substantially complied with the majority" of the committee's demands.
A moment to plug: @Olivia_Beavers @mchalfant16 and I will be live-blogging this hearing with DAG Rod Rosenstein and FBI Chris Wray. You can follow along here: https://t.co/gH9y96G2HL
RR 2/2: "Our allegations are made under oath and supported by credible evidence, and we treat everyone with respect and deal with one another in good faith."
RR 1/2: "I have devoted almost 30 years to the service of my country. In my line of work, we keep an open mind and complete investigations before we allege wrongdoing by anyone.
Rosenstein is laying out the department's approach to document production. He says he understands there are still concerns about the "speed" of production, but "those concerns are mistaken."
We‚Äôre back and the witnesses have been sworn in. https://t.co/2QGkZD04GJ
Amen. https://t.co/ySk29Vb0w2
The vote on the actual resolution is expected in the second vote series, scheduled for around 11:30.
Aaaand with member opening statements done, they have just go recessed to vote on the rule for that very measure. (This is the Meadows resolution demanding document production. Conservatives see it as a final warning shot to DOJ before they initiate contempt proceedings.)
Nadler in his opening statement says that "today we meet so that the Majority can criticize the DAG to his face" then "take a break so we can go vote on... a measure that is clearly a pretext for a move against Mr. Rosenstein that the Majority already has planned."
Goodlatte: "We are not receiving and have not received potentially enlightening communications between prosecutors themselves, between prosecutors and DOJ management including former Attorney General Lynch, or even communications between DOJ officials and those with Obama WH."
Goodlatte says that he "recently learned" that DOJ determined "emails between prosecutors working the Clinton case" did not fall under a subpoena he issued requesting all documents provided to the Inspector General‚Äîsomething he calls "unacceptable."
Goodlatte says committee Republicans "still have complaints" about the rate of document production from the DOJ, "but the situation has improved considerably." Cites US Attn'y John Lausch, Chicago's top federal prosecutor, who Sessions tapped in April to oversee the production.

Okay, I'm starting a drinking game for this markup. Drink every time you hear: Felix Sater; CFIUS; Michael Cohen; Uranium One; Carter Page; Andrew Weissman; double points for Iran-Contra.
He says it is the "clear intent" of some member of the House to "sabotage this investigation."
Nadler: "The Department of Justice... should not comply with requests for documents that would interfere [with] or compromise a criminal investigation. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs at stake here."
I should have expected that this where this markup was going to go, but I did not, as evidenced by the fact that I packed insufficient snacks. https://t.co/iQ6qX2o4yZ
Louie Gohmert is now talking about CFIUS and Uranium One. And Andrew Weissman. And Mueller. And Jim Comey.

Here‚Äôs what happened in Day 2 of Horowitz testimony. My story:  https://t.co/BZuGL8nK1Z
Meadows tells reporters that the 302s he thinks were altered were in both the Russia and Clinton probes. Declines to say how he knows but he also says the texts suggest 302s were altered‚Äîbut that he has ‚Äúmore information‚Äù supporting that conclusion.
The hearing has wrapped up. Horowitz, Gowdy and Ratcliffe are chatting in a corner of the hearing room.
https://t.co/JnN3d2fmox
The hearing is wrapping up, seven hours after it began. Goodlatte says that his committee will continue to pursue the handling of the Clinton investigation until they are satisfied that the FBI has "cleaned house."
Meadows says there is "growing evidence" that 302s were edited. He also tossed out a couple of names for the three unnamed officials Horowitz has referred to the FBI's disciplinary unit for anti-Trump texts on government devices.
Horowitz to Johnson (R-La.):  https://t.co/nYhoyHhCYC
Johnson: ‚ÄúWould you agree that it stands to reason that a man in your position might be tempted to rationalize a report that political bias did not affect the Clinton investigation as somehow serving a greater good of not completely undermining the country‚Äôs faith in our FBI?‚Äù

Horowitz says the FBI does not want the other, unnamed officials criticized for their texts in the report to be named because they work on counterintelligence issues. But he says a final decision hasn't been made and he's working to get the committee that info.
We're back. Gosar has accused Democrats of "ranting and raving"‚Äîsomething Nadler made a bid to get Gowdy to ask him to apologize for. (Gosar clarified he was speaking about Dems "generally" for using their time to talk about immigration, not attacking an individual colleague.)

Horowitz says that it is his opinion that special counsel Bob Mueller is "a man of integrity."
Yesterday's Senate hearing was a referendum on whether the Mueller probe has been infected by bias. (IG says he didn't address it. Republicans say yes.) Today's is about whether the decision not to charge Hillary Clinton was the result of bias. (IG says no. Republicans say yes.)

Horowitz says he has read about Republican allegations that Rosenstein "threatened" House Intelligence Committee staff but that he doesn't know much about it. "As in all instances, I'm available to take information," he tells Jordan.
Jordan pushes Horowitz on the timing of his other investigations and Horowitz pushes back: "If we had released this report in January, you would not have most of these texts messages."

Horowitz says that they did not find any evidence of a "secret society" at the FBI, so that's where we're at with this.
I just got a robocall telling me I'm going to be taken into custody by the local police because "there is four serious legal charges against you so please call us so that we can discuss this case." Dun-dun-dun.
Gowdy says he will not be giving other members unlimited time‚Äîas the two chairs and ranking members have gotten‚Äîbecause "some people have Fourth of July plans."
Horowitz declines to give a timeline for his ongoing investigation into leaks. "We will follow the evidence where it leads and when it‚Äôs completed we will issue our report."

But, he says, still sticking with the report: "In our view, we didn‚Äôt find or see evidence that the prosecutors were impacted by that bias."
Horowitz is sticking with what he has already said in the report‚Äîcalling the Strzok/Page conduct "antithetical" to FBI values. "I can't imagine FBI agents suggesting that they might use their powers to investigate any candidate for any office."
Gowdy asking Horowitz some rhetorical questions, but it's mostly just getting the IG to confirm facts from the report. (Reporters remarking that Gowdy is correctly pronouncing "Strzok," in contrast to like, half the Senate panel yesterday.)
Gowdy laying out a timeline of Strzok-Page involvement in the Russia and Clinton investigations and pulling out texts to compare-and-contrast the way the two felt about both probes‚Äîto make the point that they had pre-judged both based on their bias against Trump.

I've been in this hearing room less than hour and I've already turned to the jerky.
Here's the full Goodlatte quote. I expect we will hear more about this today: ‚ÄúIt is critical for the public to also hear what was not included in the report due to the IG‚Äôs refusal to question whether a particular decision by the FBI &amp; DOJ was the most effective choice.‚Äù
Goodlatte says the public deserves to know what is *not* in the IG report, citing Horowitz's "refusal" to look at whether a given decision was the "most effective." This is technically true, although a rhetorical way of putting it. Here is Horowitz on this point: https://t.co/MYhEgqYmH1

Cummings appears to choke up as he pleads with Republicans to "stand up to President Trump" on family separation. And, just as quick as it started, it's over and we're on a split-screen to Judiciary chair Goodlatte (R-Va.), who says DOJ used a double-standard for Clinton.
"We are so much better than that! What country is that?" Cummings shouts as cameras click.
Cummings: "Are we really going to sit here, 70 members of the Congress of the United States and have a hearing that just repeats the Senate [hearing] yesterday on Hillary Clinton's emails..." when the Trump administration is undertaking what he calls "child internment camps."
Cummings: "I think it's crystal clear, the only answer Republicans will accept is that Hillary Clinton must be guilty. They will keep going on until they get that answer. Even if the facts will never support it and multiple independent reviews come to the opposite conclusion."
"All their howling about 'lock her up' was bogus. It was baseless. It was unsubstantiated," OGR ranking member Cummings (D-Md.) says in another fiery opening statement. "[Republicans] still want Hillary Clinton to be guilty. Even today."
From a tone and ferocity standpoint, this opening statement is like, if not quite Benghazi-level Gowdy, Benghazi-adjacent Gowdy.
Gowdy says the same group of FBI officials pre-judged both the Clinton and Russia investigations, calling it "textbook" bias. "We cannot have a justice decision that bases decisions on anything other than facts."
@SylvanLane @dhenry I have both jerky and water. Separately. Rest easy, friends.
Gowdy giving a fiery opening statement. He's railing against Jim Comey, talking about Comey saying "in his typically sanctimonious way" that the FBI doesn't care about politics. "Unfortunately," Gowdy says, "he was dead wrong."
That explains the babies. Nadler (D-N.Y.) speaks out against the separation of families and a few protesters‚Äîwith babies‚Äîstart chanting "families belong together." Gowdy recesses while Capitol Police escorts them out.
The baby is already bawling as Gowdy gavels in.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.): "Bottom line... I‚Äôm not buying that the Clinton email investigation was on the up-and-up." Cites Strzok as lead investigator "clearly did not want to see" Donald Trump become president.
"We followed normal processes. [The report] was not made weaker or softer in any regard," Horowitz says of Trump's claims that the report was being "made weaker." (Some House GOPers have also sent a letter asking for the IG's drafts, claiming that "people" were changing it.)
Wray: "My view is the FBI doesn‚Äôt make charging decisions.‚Äù
(I learned my lesson in the Comey hearing and deliberately sat outside of the view of cameras today, mainly because I knew I was going to eat beef jerky halfway through this hearing.)
local reporter responding to barry trotz resignation may be the best thing that has happened in this hearing so far https://t.co/6MEyW1JFV9
Horowitz "did not address the credibility of the special counsel‚Äôs investigation here," he says.
Asked by Durbin about Trump's response to the report‚Äîthat it exonerates him‚ÄîHorowitz says that the report "does not touch on the Russia investigation" other than looking at Strzok's decision to prioritize that probe over the newfound Clinton emails on the Weiner laptop.
Just to clarify: Horowitz won't confirm or deny whether Giuliani is part of this investigation. https://t.co/DFs84Nrk4R
Horowitz: "I have to say it surprised us that [Comey] was sending emails‚Äî[although] they were unclassified‚Äîbut nevertheless they were on his private email account."
https://t.co/vmJkarWlVB
Wray also delicately criticized Comey, saying that "there are a number of things I would probably have done differently."
N.B.: Wray has been clear about this before. Here's the quote from today: "I do not believe that special counsel Mueller is on a witch hunt.‚Äù
In response to questioning from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Wray says that he does not believe Mueller to be on a witch hunt.
Wray says that the bureau "use[s] confidential informants in all manner of investigations and it‚Äôs a very, very, very important tool in that mission."
Wray says the bureau has created a "dedicated leak investigation unit" and that "We won't hesitate to throw the book at people who violate our rules on this." (Wray rolled out a new media contacts policy in November.)
Hatch cites a "serious problem with the culture at FBI headquarters." He says Wray's public response "downplayed" the report. "If we can look at just one or two investigations and find this much bias, I can only imagine what else is out there."
Feinstein pushing Horowitz about what he has found about who may have leaked information to Giuliani just before Comey's "October surprise." Horowitz says he won't comment because the OIG's leak investigation is still ongoing.
Grassley asks Horowitz if his office is investigating Comey's memos including the questions raised about their levels of classification. Horowitz: "We received a referral on that from the FBI. We are handling that referral and we will issue a report when the matter is completed."
Wray, in summarizing bureau response to the report under way, says FBI has already referred conduct called out in the report to the Office of Professional Responsibility, the FBI's internal disciplinary unit.
Wray in his opening statement reiterates that the FBI accepts the IG's recommendations for the bureau.
https://t.co/bUMsuLHDcL
Wray and Horowitz have both been sworn in. Horowitz is giving his statement now.
In other words, the opening statements from both Grassley and Feinstein echoed the two sets of talking points that we have heard from both sides since this report was released last week. I called it Rorschach test on Thursday, and that appears to hold on Monday.
Feinstein says the IG found no evidence that political views impacted the outcome of the Clinton investigation. The lesson to be drawn from the report, she says, is the "danger of public discussion in ongoing investigations."
https://t.co/r3JsRidzXg
Horowitz con't: "But among the most important is the need to respect the institution‚Äôs hierarchy and structure, and to follow established policies, procedures, and norms even in the highest-profile and most challenging investigations."
Much of the IG's statement is drawn from the executive summary of the 500-page report released Friday. Per his prepared remarks, Horowitz will say: "There are many lessons to be learned from the Department‚Äôs and the FBI‚Äôs handling of the Midyear investigation."
Here is Grassley's full statement: https://t.co/yENSuCqIWK	And here is the IG's: https://t.co/pYK62jMNcs
Mueller, meanwhile, Grassley says, is using "bare-knuckle" tactics.
Grassley says that former AG Loretta Lynch should have appointed a special counsel after the tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton. Clinton, he says, got "kid glove" treatment.
that's a reference to this tweet: https://t.co/uAk4K5WmYM
McCabe, Comey, Lynch also invited to testify, chair Grassley says. He says McCabe lawyer cited Fifth Amendment and Comey lawyer says he was out of the country, "although I saw he was in Iowa over the weekend. According to his Twitter feed, he seems to be having a wonderful time.

Horowitz also cabins his findings about Strzok: He wasn‚Äôt the sole responsible party for any decision in Midyear. He wasn‚Äôt acting unilaterally. And Horowitz's team found no evidence that anyone else on the MY team "deliberately placed [the Weiner laptop] on the back burner.‚Äù
Investigators did not find any evidence that political bias or improper influence impacted any decisions made in the Clinton case prior to Comey's announcement that he was closing the case‚Äîincluding the decision not to recommend charges against Clinton.

Honestly, I really needed this video today. https://t.co/RGtEMKdzCO
@BobbyChesney My thought was, might it have an impact on what evidence they can use in court? (I‚Äôm thinking about your post that they seem to have enough to charge him with material support. How much of what‚Äôs in their filings is admissible?)
I am curious if that issue‚Äîthe question of his alleged abuse in SDF custody‚Äîis part of the reason the government hasn‚Äôt charged him.
FWIW, it looks like those medical records will be entered into the court record but I imagine it‚Äôs unlikely we as the public will get to see them?
One sticking point today: The question of whether Doe was abused while in SDF custody, as the ACLU alleges. James Burnham, the DOJ lawyer, was EMPHATIC that didn‚Äôt occur and says he can ‚Äúprove‚Äù the allegations he was beaten and shot at are untrue, citing medical records.
She acknowledged the safety concerns raised by the ACLU if the government releases Doe into Syria as a suspected ISIS fighter. But she also noted that he had gone there voluntarily originally. Doe doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúblank check‚Äù to pick where he‚Äôs released, she said.
As Chutkan noted to chuckles at the beginning of the hearing: ‚ÄúAs with everything in this case, we are in uncharted territory.‚Äù
In the meantime, the government will continue to hold Doe where he is, in Iraq.
John Doe updates from the hearing before Judge Chutkan this morning: The June 20 hearing will now be about Doe‚Äôs bid to block his forcible release into Syria‚Äînot the merits of his underlying habeas petition, which will be postponed while this latest issue is litigated.
