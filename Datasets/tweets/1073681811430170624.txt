@IlhanMN Let me stop you there...		I heard a new liberal buzzword from @AOC: “Tokenism”.		She said Republicans do that. Can you give me an example?		#hypocrat #SocialistPrivilege 🇮🇱
@daveweigel Let’s see if @CNN tries to get away with saying Wallace was a Republican when they break the story.
@IlhanMN Hey, don’t look at the #Republicans. Threats are against the law. 	#BackTheBlue 🚔 		Maybe the Mossad got tired of your smack talk.	#Israel 🇮🇱
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @GOP You and the other Democrats had better hurry up, Ted.		You’ve only got 20 months left to continue doing nothing but try to throw Trump out of the White House.		#snore #KeepSwinging
@true_pundit Why does a non-African American woman from Westchester County feel authorized to take inventory of black people?		#SocialistPrivilege @AOC #hypocrat
@CaptainMabel We weren’t going to go, but now all of us ”white men” will so that we can watch you throw tantrums, ruin the movie for everyone, and get cuffed and stuffed in a police car for harassment &amp; disorderly conduct while yelling we’re what’s wrong with the country.		See you on YouTube.
@StaceyPlaskett I saw a few “Democrats” walking and chewing gum like that on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City.		They appeared to have gotten lost on the way back from a lingerie show and they kept leaning in car windows asking for directions.
@RepJeffries @StaceyPlaskett Ha ha. Who brought the tough guy?
@DucadiSpalato @AOC @AOC telling us what offends African Americans is as effective as @SenWarren telling us what offends Native Americans.		We also wonder how a girl who grew up in Westchester County got so “street”, but that’s another thread.
@AOC That is patently untrue. No one is uninvited to the Republican party. We welcome everyone regardless of race, creed or preference.		All that is required of Republicans is love of country, the desire to keep it safe &amp; support for first responders who put their lives on the line.
@EdKrassen Well Ed, since you’re saying Donald Trump will win if Republicans “think” Bernie Sanders is a socialist...		we now officially think you Democrats are all socialists (AOC included) &amp; we’ll take the House majority too.		There, that was easy.		#SocialismTakesCapitalismCreates @GOP
“We hear that some of you are living idle lives, refusing to work and meddling in other people's business. We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their own living.” - 2 Thessalonians 3:11-12		 #SocialismIsEvil 👹
@NevadaJack2 We are going to give @AOC a nervous breakdown in less than a year.		It already looks like the cheese is sliding off her cracker.
@krassenstein Don’t lie.		You stayed on @FoxNews for about 6 minutes, then you flipped back to finish watching “Magic Mike” for the 38th time.
@maziehirono For those Republicans who wish to work on how they treat women, Rep. @keithellison and @LGJustinFairfax will be holding sensitivity training. #ItOnlyHurtsOnce #hypocrat #HowDareYou
@ABC A mosquito would also get the President’s attention, with similar results.
@IlhanMN One way out of the “crosshairs of Islamophobia” is for @IlhanMN to not stand up and request “restorative justice” instead of prison for ISIS recruits.		As for American misogyny, we’re not the ones who would whip the flesh off your back for cheating on your brother. #ShariaLaw
@derekmaltz_sr @flatwalk Well, it’s looks like we’re going to have to tell society’s fringe to not do this killer drug either, &amp; they’re not going to listen as usual, so we may as well save time and tell the Democrat politicians to cordon off parts of their city so junkies can consume it without hassle.
@KamalaHarris You’ve got a lot more sleeping your way to the top left to do if you want to be President, and nobody’s that interested in leftovers.
@secretstranger9 “Bollocks!” quoth the Queen;	“If I had them I’d be King.”
@krassenstein On that subject, we noticed Ralph Northam is still Governor of Virginia. #hypocrat		Quit wasting time. You only have 20 months left to bounce Trump out of office.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Mr. President would like to send Matthew Whitaker to receive Bill Palmer’s message personally.		At that time, Mr. Palmer is advised to have his finger on the button of his LifeAlert. https://t.co/FsDfvY3edw
@NationalistCody @BattleBornThom Rolling Stone is also the magazine that put a “Tiger Beat” style photo of the immigrant “refugee” who milked our resources to the fullest before he blew an 8 year old boy to pieces during the 2013 Boston Marathon. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder https://t.co/BlffRkyUNM
@ouchinagirl @CovfefeGun @HillaryClinton @politico @realDonaldTrump Whatever @AOC thinks she’s doing, we need to make sure other Democrats don’t stop her.		She scares off independent voters like a porcupine in a nudist colony. #TRUMP2020
@krassenstein If you moonbats are nice enough to Kim Jong-Un, he could help @AOC fix up her #GreenNewDeal.		After all, she’s basically a bartender, while he’s a seasoned professional commie.
@JerryDunleavy @DucadiSpalato Sometimes Democrats use guns that don’t fire when the trigger is pulled. They think it’s a loophole in the armed robbery charge. https://t.co/Ru2sFEq314
@krassenstein Imagine if POTUS had put on blackface and parodied POC like the Democrat Governor and Democrat Attorney General of Virginia both did. He’d never hear the end of it, not that he does now. #hypocrat
@TammyLuRobare @EdKrassen @AOC On the contrary, @AOC is GOP’s favorite moonbat.		She makes independent voters think the Democrats have lost it completely, and her #GreenNewDeal is so psychotic that Nancy Pelosi ignores it.		We encourage her to never stop talking. https://t.co/e3Q4UKugJD
@AOC “Like... *puff puff* put something in there saying you don’t have to work... if you don’t want to, heh heh *cough cough*...”
@DIVESPLASHSWIM1 @fireman5129 @Ilhan @AOC Brian Klaas has decent credentials.		However, he lives in London.		He was born here, but he may not know first hand the dire suffering and widespread famine Americans endure at the merciless hand of @realDonaldTrump.		Ha ha ha. You moonbats never cease to amuse.

The only inference I got about you was that you’re a comedian.		I made no other judgements about you except that you didn’t exactly vote for Trump.		Go ahead and call that a lie too.

And then you tell me I’m lying.		In order to make a judgement and call me a Nazi, you’d better have a good memory of exactly what was said.		All I see is you calling me nasty stuff from the jump.

@R_Zooth @LawOfTheWolf1 @IrishBitch9 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Therapy is for Democrats.		They need someone to talk to after being diagnosed with something that some Dr. Moonbat thought up like “snow makes me sad”. https://t.co/BIlD0BUOhe
@R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @LawOfTheWolf1 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Now say something nice about yourself.
@R_Zooth @Twitter @TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @NW_StayDet @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 @DrSkipPhD @IrishBitch9 @MrChuckD @LqLana Yeah, when your mouth is full, I don’t wanna know what’s in it. Probably why you got them blisters.
@R_Zooth @LawOfTheWolf1 @IrishBitch9 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport You’re still showing, and you were scheduled to stop talking to me over an hour ago.		Are you waiting until you say something snappy enough? Nobody’s got time for that.
@IrishBitch9 @LawOfTheWolf1 @R_Zooth @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Oh what, about how Nazis and Communists are both socialist creations? No contest. #FactsMatter 		The real deal is that Democrats offend me. It’s that simple, and you reminded me why. You moonbats called me names with almost every post while I forced myself to be nice for 2 days.
@SubdudeW @alicia45KAG @mitchellvii @Cherib1965 Preach.
@IrishBitch9 @LawOfTheWolf1 @R_Zooth @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport If that were so, it would be because there are 5 of you ganging up on me. Note the subjunctive.		I’m in very low gear. Don’t want to scare the snowflakes.
@R_Zooth @Twitter @TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @NW_StayDet @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 @DrSkipPhD @IrishBitch9 @MrChuckD @LqLana 99 to go, Gruesome.
@R_Zooth @LawOfTheWolf1 @IrishBitch9 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Dr. Skippy probably put those blisters on your lips. Now you got luggage, son.
@R_Zooth @Twitter @TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @NW_StayDet @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 @DrSkipPhD @IrishBitch9 @MrChuckD @LqLana You haven’t stopped following me around, Nancy. Do you promise to actually go or are you going to call me and hang up 100 times like an ugly ex?
@LqLana @R_Zooth @Twitter @TalibKweli @LeeBrown1273 @NW_StayDet @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 @DrSkipPhD @IrishBitch9 @MrChuckD Yeah, the Nazis still can’t figure out why we were shooting at them untill 1945.		Meanwhile, the “folks who flock” to your party typically aren’t satisfied with our level of racist output, so you have one of your terrible actors pay two Nigerians to do what you think we’d do.
@IrishBitch9 @LawOfTheWolf1 @R_Zooth @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport We’ve grown tired of the proletariat yet again.		We’ll go back to holding things together while you leftists burn down pharmacies and dress up like the opposite sex as usual.		Peace and bear markets,		@GOP
@IrishBitch9 @R_Zooth @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Ha ha. Even Moses is your junior.
@LawOfTheWolf1 @R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Nothing else. There’s no need to bother.
@AOC How much “value” did Kamala Harris create for Willie Brown?
@chuckwoolery Ask @senatemajldr how it feels to be really inconvenienced during lunch, @AOC. #hypocrat #LeftistHorde https://t.co/w3PfMeMIch
@R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @Scary_MsMary @TalibKweli @TwitterSupport Yes, and when they see the mouth on her and what she’s said to me, the response will be tantamount to the “f*** off” she just directed at me. 		Damn, son, you’re really trying to get my attention, but I don’t swing “liberal bro”. Try the bus stations.
@catturd2 @cactusflower81 You might get some competition from the humans who haven’t fully transitioned into rats, i.e. transrodents.
@CallidusDominus @GOP @CanisLupus1365 @KingAreys They didn’t lie. Hitler hijacked the Jew-hating socialist German Workers’ Party and just made a few adjustments after he killed off his only competition Gregor Strasser of the Stürmabteilung, who was already on his s-list because his newspaper was doing better than Goebbels’.

OK. Let’s switch it to “Christians kill, Muslims battle”. Did that unruffle your knickers? Good.		Yeah, Turkey is a good example. They attacked Russian ports in the Black Sea in 1914 right before they attempted to slaughter every living Armenian.

@TalibKweli You sold more hip-hop records than me. Gee, that’s gonna ruin my day.		Then again, you &amp; the other 5%ers think Brooklyn is a holy city &amp; that you know the truth of existence, so there’s no way you’re all kinds of bat dookie crazy, &amp; I should be concerned about what you think. 😆
@R_Zooth @TalibKweli Said the tool with 67 followers.		Later, little man.
@krassenstein What is Lieutenant Governor Fairfax going to get for his sexual assault?
@KinseyAttacks Yes, I know. They all did everything they could to aggravate me too and they doubled down when I played dumb and acted like I didn’t notice.
@DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 OK, um, “DanaWhitePower”? 		Yeah, you’re not a toolbox. Chuckle.		Later.
@MsMJJ4ever @Obnoxious_Mary @DrSkipPhD @R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Would you like to repeat it?
@iamjohnk @TalibKweli @KrangoJ I don’t do stuff that would arouse suspicion, so I have no need to be slick. I do what I’m supposed to do at work, I don’t break laws, I don’t try to get away with anything, so I’m not creeping around for any reason.
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ I’m not saying it doesn’t exist. I’m saying I don’t see it.		And what’s with this “fragile” stuff? Nothing anyone has said has bothered me in the least. I see the lame insults and memes as just a way to detract attention from the subject.
@Marslady @DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ Does that apply when management is completely integrated as well?
@TalibKweli @KrangoJ Ha ha. Sure.		Judging by your sardonic attitude, you probably would have said nasty stuff about me had I tagged someone else anyway, not that I didn’t know that.		Still trying to get under my skin, though? It’s just not working. Maybe you should try a diss track.
@Obnoxious_Mary @DrSkipPhD @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 OK, I’ll take the win. Have a great week.

@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ I have no way of knowing that. However, being white as well, you don’t either. Have you seen it personally? I’m in a white collar environment. Any overtures suggesting privilege is grounds for dismissal, and the place where I work is very integrated.
@R_Zooth @Obnoxious_Mary @road25thdan @DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Well, there no coffee for you. You bolted. So another win. Have a great week.

@Obnoxious_Mary @DrSkipPhD @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Oh, you were right. Thank you for pointing that out to me. So that’s been changed. Now back to what was wrong with my socialist argument.

Are you trying to sneak Skip out with you? We have an issue to address. I know he isn’t trying to slink away now, is he?
@Obnoxious_Mary @MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 It’s just another method of Skip dodging an argument to avoid a loss.

@DrSkipPhD @road25thdan @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That’s not working either, Skip.		Going to tell me what’s wrong with my saying Hitler hijacked the socialist DAP and made a unique creation of it? There, I crystallized it for you.
@road25thdan @DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I use Twitter for discussions like this. Ordinarily people and I exchange viewpoints. This isn’t usual, but I don’t mind. That’s Twitter’s only function to me.
@Obnoxious_Mary @DrSkipPhD @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I hate Nazis and Communists. You didn’t listen. That’s your right.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That’s right, because I tell the truth.
@MsMJJ4ever @road25thdan @DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Simple.		Skip steps in out of nowhere, says I don’t know what I’m talking about, I ask which part, he dodges, I ask him to defend his accusation, he starts joking with women hoping I’ll go away. Now he’s suddenly quiet.		Whenever you’re ready, Skip.
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ Who are the chief perpetrators of it?
@road25thdan @DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I’m still here, still got all my tweets.		Waiting for you ladies to stop protecting Skip. Let him go. He can handle himself.
@DrSkipPhD @road25thdan @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Go ahead and play, Skip. I’ll wait.
@DrSkipPhD @DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ What do you think is deleted, or are you just saying that to change the subject of what’s wrong about my tweets?
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ I can’t acknowledge what’s invisible to me.		I’m not POC. I don’t know the difference.		Perhaps you can explain it.
@DrSkipPhD @road25thdan @DanaWhitePower @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I’ve still got them all. Which ones are you missing?		You want to step up and defend your accusation or just play hopscotch with the girls, liberal “bro”?
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ I can’t correct others. It’s a free country. I can only do what’s right myself.
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ Because the general white population is tired of being lumped in with them, and then having white supremacy thrown in all of our faces. We don’t want special treatment based on skin color because it’s also insulting to suggest anyone needs such treatment.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That is exactly what happened. It’s posted and anyone can see it.		You attacked my statements saying I’m “obfuscating”, didn’t identify one instance of that, then tried to change the subject.		I’m not.		Defend yourself or take the L.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Well, then you stepped to me, talked smack, made no point, got challenged and chickened out in front of everyone.		Not a good look.
@DanaWhitePower @jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ Only the ones who are butthurt over losing the Civil War. No use for it.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 You haven’t done anything since you showed up but tell me I’m wrong, avoid explaining yourself, &amp; got catty and obviously irritated.		I’m still sitting here waiting for you to defend your accusations of my being wrong at all.		I’m not impressed.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 You’re ducking and dodging. I’m not going anywhere, fella.		Point out what’s wrong with what I said. Back yourself up if you can.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Why can’t you tell everyone what’s wrong with what I said instead of getting huffy and running around in circles?
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Fine, if you want an excuse to flee in panic, then you’re excused.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 “Don’t pin your ignorance on me, bro.”		Very scholarly of you.
@DrSkipPhD That was a question.		Caught you on a technicality, fastball.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That’s an observation. You seem that way, but you’re probably capable of better than what you’re showing me right now. Perhaps your prejudice prevents you from being able to debate maturely.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 What kind of man makes an accusation and can’t back it up at all?
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Ad hominem attacks are rejected, remember?		You don’t get away that easily. Point out what’s wrong, or you’ll be wrong.		For a doctor, you seem to be disproportionately short-sighted and immature.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 What’s disingenuous is diversionary tactics when you’re asked to defend an accusation.		What’s being obfuscated, once again?
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I used a small picture. It looked like a dreadlocked male when I looked at it. Very well, I’ll change it.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Because I either see grammatical or syntax errors or I just think of better way of saying the same thing.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 The short haired man is fending off a dreadlocked male Antifa protester who is trying to choke him.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 With all due respect, Doctor, anyone can step in randomly and say something is wrong about a statement with nothing but his own hubris to stand behind that accusation. Find something wrong with what I said, or you’ll be the one making a mistake.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 I’ve been explaining the same thing for two days, yet you accuse me of obfuscation. Defend your accusation. What exactly is not clear or intelligible?
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 But storming into a conversation and throwing insults are not rejected. I see. You have a strange rule book, fella.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Explain what is being “obfuscated”, if civil discourse isn’t too much to ask.
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Nobody has to be civil. It’s a free country. To not be civil is childish, but even getting a PhD can’t teach you class.		Physician, heal thyself.
@Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Then why bother asking in the first place, except just for an excuse to call people names?
@DrSkipPhD @Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That’s your opinion. I haven’t gone off half-cocked &amp; thrown epithets at anyone, Doctor. I’m explaining a point of view amidst a torrent of abuse. I don’t mind it, but it accomplishes nothing. Nothing is egotistical about that. Perhaps you’re just dismissing input with prejudice.
@Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 You can be civil, or you don’t get jack. You can also dial down your ego. You don’t know me and I don’t know you. You could be smarter than me or as stupid as a bag of rocks, but any fool can run up on someone and throw insults, and so far you’ve shown nothing intellectual.
@R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 By the way, I said before I’ll answer all questions.		When you respond multiple times to one of my tweets, the questions can get missed.		If you want to ask me something, doing so more than once can get questions lost.		If @MsMJJForever could repost her question, I’ll answer it.
@Obnoxious_Mary @R_Zooth @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 Hello again, self-described Scary Mary. Is this your “nice” account?		Socialist groupthink and inherent racism in the DAP made an easy target for Hitler. The resulting Nazi party was unique, but their origins are purely socialist.
@R_Zooth @Obnoxious_Mary @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 That’s the same article you referenced twice already. Notice Michael Ray didn’t say “no” directly.		Hitler took advantage of the inherent racist groupthink of the German socialists, dispatched his competition, and crafted a party unique unto itself, even with slight capitalism.

Shi’ites and Sunnis kill each other but are both Muslim.

That’s why “TF”. Grow up and learn something.

The groupthink nature of socialism enabled what happened to the German Workers’ Party. Nazis were a socialist group that specialized themselves. They opposed communists who were essentially the same.
@R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @CrypticCarnage @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @GOP Yes, it is interesting.		The division between Hitler and the Strasser brothers resulted from the success of their newspaper “Nationaler Sozialist” over the publications of Joseph Goebbels. The Strassers were heads of the SA and were Hitler’s last obstruction.		They were the same.
@R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @CrypticCarnage @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @GOP No. Hitler was also anti-capitalist. We fought Hitler and the beast he made out of Socialism, just like we’ve been fighting socialists ever since.		Why? Because the @GOP are capitalists.		Everybody who isn’t one hates on us and talks about how socialism is cool. 		Then Venezuela.
@pattonoswalt Comedians are the ultimate Democrats.		You ask them to resign for stuff like that, other Democrats tell everyone to get over their anger, and their career is still secure.		Just ask former MN Senator &amp; SNL alum @alfranken for his take on @GovernorVA Ralph Northam. #hypocrat @GOP
@AOC I guess “the mistake” saying you’d pay those unwilling to work, failed attempts at redistribution of income, and wanting everyone to wear uniforms like Mao Suits weren’t communist then, is that what you’re saying? #IfItQuacksLikeACommunist @GOP #TheMoreYouKnow #UsefulIdiots
@R_Zooth @IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @CrypticCarnage @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @GOP In 1919 Hitler joined the already established socialist German Workers’ Party previously mentioned. The transformation into the unique Nazi party was not effected until the Enabling Act of 1933. The socialist groupthink machine was ripe for commandeering under totalitarian rule.
@PostRoz @bethreinhard @alice_crites It’s 2019. It took this long to remember this happened?		On a side note, in 2013 the House passed the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act (H.R. 2655) that ensures plaintiffs cover the legal costs of frivolous lawsuits.		Nowadays, when Dems try to point the finger, crap sticks to it.
@RealSaavedra @Martinsays2 @AOC and her unwitting socialist minions want a #GreenNewDeal to be taken seriously, and this is what they’ve done to the Bronx River.		Let’s see if she can talk her constituency into getting off the couch, putting on those uniforms she likes and picking up their neighborhood. https://t.co/OXvjkd2vU4

@R_Zooth @Obnoxious_Mary @MsMJJ4ever @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @Hunter74075708 In 1918 Anton Drexler formed a branch of the “Free Workers’ Committee For A Good Peace” in Bremen which changed into the German Workers’ Party. Believing Jewish capitalists profiteered during WWI, they chose economic socialism benefiting only Aryans. They later became the Nazis.

@DanteEarthboy @TalibKweli @KrangoJ This whole discussion is about making bigoted statements about white people, so that means you also made a hair-trigger assessment of the situation.		The context is obvious. The Antifa guy has his hands around the guy’s neck. It’s mean to show the hypocrisy of the far left.
@R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ @TrashExplorer @DanaWhitePower @DrSkipPhD @LeeBrown1273 @urbansimian @MsMJJ4ever @Obnoxious_Mary @Hunter74075708 The deflection is so Democrat.

@DanteEarthboy @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Good of you to point out that picture.		It’s actually a guy fending off a male dreadlocked Antifa protester who’s trying to choke him.		Talk all the smack you want about white people then. You’re free to do that. We just won’t hear any complaints. We tried.

@djezreader @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Whatever. Hit the bricks, kid. Come back when you can competently explain yourself.
@PAYPERKULT @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Yeah, I dig. Everyone from a senator to a homeless person gets the same respect from me in public, which is the highest amount.		I want for no exceptional privilege to be shown to anyone since that’s the cause of all resent and anymosity. The same rules should apply for all.
@R_Zooth @TalibKweli @KrangoJ I’m going to attempt to untangle what you said.		Who wants to perpetuate the stereotypes on whom?		Then I’ll have an answer.
@KamalaHarris It’s far more genuine when another person reports that you did something like this as an earnest gesture without anyone needing to know.
@JeffreyGuterman @KamalaHarris Then you can join Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and the rest of the Neo-Democrats on their quest to defund, endanger and eventually hand over #Israel to the Palestinians, and we’ll see who’s the moron, boychik.

They were on their way back to Make Nigeria Great Again.
@jcyordenana He just called me ignorant. I’m not thin-skinned enough to consider that picking on me.
@Lisa_Temple @robin_ked @AOC That’ll teach her to mess with capitalism.
@realTrumpForce Why? She never has any.
@LqLana @Patriot7231 @road25thdan @TalibKweli @KrangoJ What do you really expect the answer to that to be?		My opinion? Hang him. That’s what was done to Saddam Hussein. Not only that, if possible, his military discharge should be downgraded by the DRB.		Are you thinking a Republican would say he should get a medal or something?
@ThomZFranklin @TalibKweli @KrangoJ No, I want to evaluate it.		My actual point is that I find the racist comment about white people and Wal-Mart to be offensive, but I support his right to tweet it.		But I sure as f*ck am going to give him sh*t for it, because I’m a white guy.		Simple, isn’t it?
@MatthewDIreland @TalibKweli @RealDrSkip @KrangoJ Everyone should be free as an individual to celebrate their religion, speak without incurring retribution, and live to their fullest.		The playing field should be level for all. X should not enjoy any privileges that Y cannot, and the inverse is applicable.		Do you agree?
@jcyordenana Is Talib Kweli picking on white people? I didn’t know. Why is he doing that, because they’re white?		By the way, the “mythically homogenous” Asians take the Harvard problem seriously. https://t.co/75Ya8rlS6u
@jcyordenana But I’m the one asking the question.		It’s your turn to answer.
@jcyordenana Let me reiterate then.		Asian POC don’t generally have trouble with the police, and overall they do so well that Harvard University is trying to overlook their applicants in favor of other POC, and they have an extreme language barrier. So who’s having the problem and why?
@jcyordenana @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Define “it”.
@jcyordenana One does not simply “troll for equality”, madam. To suggest that could occur is to mock the struggle for equality itself.
@JacksonLeeTX18 But it’s OK for your women staffers to be sexually assaulted and “gagged” from reporting it or risk being fired? #MeToo #NoGagRule⁠ #hypocrat https://t.co/rtF04m4uSm
@jcyordenana @TalibKweli @KrangoJ What POC? Asian POC don’t generally have trouble with the police, don’t fill jails, and overall they do so well that Harvard University is trying to overlook their applicants in favor of other POC, and they have an extreme language barrier. So who’s having the problem and why?
@jcyordenana Saying “also” is tantamount to admitting it.		I never need help, lady. I satirized your quick change from bravado to mayday status. The difference is evident.		You could block me like all the other moonbats if I’m too much for you to handle.
@krassenstein Bill Clinton set the precedent. Wait until your failed candidate’s husband finally gets reamed for participating in child abuse.		Who is Q again? He’s not real... is he?		Chuckle.		#ChickensComingHomeToRoost
@jcyordenana @TalibKweli @KrangoJ We want racial equality, not inequality, and that’s achievable only if we play by the same rules.		How is it constructive to make bigoted statements about an ethnic group while crusading for equal rights?
@jcyordenana You don’t want to wait for your moonbat cavalry to swoop in and help you? Then this retweet had no purpose. Answering separate question now.
@ThomZFranklin @TalibKweli @KrangoJ It makes plenty of sense if you’re not trying to pigeonhole the subject.

So Ginger State, that Jussie Smollett incident must have had you breaking everything in your apartment. How does it feel to snatch defeat from the jaws of MAGA victory? You were so close...
@TalibKweli @Patriot7231 @KrangoJ That’s a woman you’re speaking to, fella. Unlike Democrats, conservatives with the name “Missy” never had wedding tackle swinging in their boxers. Just an FYI.		She’s being very nice with a nice message, and that’s how you respond? Nice segue from the Jussie Smollett situation.
Snowflake Can’t Stand The Heat, Sends Hysterical Tweet Flare To Other Moonbats For Help Even Though Liberals Think They’re Schoolly With Their B.A.s In French History From Bard College https://t.co/U5LLY0cmjZ
@jcyordenana @TalibKweli @KrangoJ “hypocrisy is lost on the woman casting aspersions on white men who dare to question inequality”
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump To stop this egregious egregiousness, demand voter ID from everyone equally. That makes it fair for everyone and ends fraud.		Right, Chuck?

Is this Ginger State or Scary State?
@Cave_DweIIer @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Well, why don’t you ask the guy who was able to stop Asians from being extrajudicially murdered by cops? Whatever he did worked so well, it’s like they never had that problem.
@djezreader @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Is it, Aaron? Want to explain how there being two sets of different rules based on skin color is going to unite America? Throw some wisdom at us, kid. See if you can get 1 follower.
@jcyordenana @TalibKweli @KrangoJ “Oppressed”? Geez, I didn’t mean to trigger you, cat lady. I just wanted to know why there’s a different set of rules for another man because of his skin color. Does that “oppress” you? Park your broomstick and take a nap, Hilda.
@Patriot7231 @TalibKweli @KrangoJ There’s some actual wisdom for you, Mr. Kweli.
@TalibKweli Equality would be defined as the same set of rules applying to everybody.		What’s your definition of equality, so we can change the dictionary?		Don’t get huffy. I just figured I’d ask a rap mogul since you and comedians are the luminaries of the Democrats.
@TalibKweli @KrangoJ Turning a fan on that fog of semantics, what’s left is that black people can say anything they want about white people, but the inverse isn’t acceptable. That sure sounds like some type of privilege. What synonym would you like instead?
@stephphilip8 @sherrynron Next, ask Hippie Gandhi how much he gives to charity.
@Danj000 @TalibKweli @KrangoJ Yeah, I forgot to check my right to state a fact... I mean, my privilege.
@AOC You’re almost two months too late. We’ve already confirmed you’re several fries short of a Happy Meal.
@Yair_Rosenberg @AG_Conservative Yes, the anti-Semitic Socialists are getting uppity again. We’ll have to beat them back again like we did in WWII.
@TalibKweli @KrangoJ So if you’re black, do you have “black privilege”? You know, the kind that allows this character to say things about white people that he’d get on others for saying about black people?		You’re the ignorant one with a heaping side of double standard, fastball.
@jusbgun1 @_NotFakeNews_ Hey, thought I’d stop by to “peep”.		He should be executed. We’re not going to shift blame or mitigate anything like urban Democrats did for Jussie.		Now watch the Democrats ask for some of their “mass incarcerated” constituents to be set free to make room for this guy.
@jusbgun1 @michelechaves @Freeyourmindkid You forgot about “whatabout” Jazmine Barnes too. White people have to just suck it up and get over an innocent man getting death threats. Those wypipo complain too much.		Ain’t that right, Rudie?
@jusbgun1 @TalibKweli @FouroneP @KrangoJ So every white person that walks into Wal-Mart is a white supremacist and is poorly educated?		What color privilege allows you to make sweeping racist generalizations about white people? #hypocrat
@jusbgun1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Kid, you’re not American, no matter how much you want to be. We already have dissidents we call Democrats.		Meanwhile, just last weekend, a Mexican national tried to smuggle $13M of meth into Texas in a truck full of strawberries.		Our wall is our business. Mind your own.
@brithume @lish0531 Don’t worry. We’ve got his picture.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr This is Plan B after the Russian Collusion thing went down like Kamala Harris before a promotion.
@harikondabolu That same “very realistic fear” led LaPorsha Washington to blame the shooting of her daughter Jazmine Barnes in her presence by two black men in Texas on an unwitting white man, causing him to get death threats.		So much for your teachable moment, young Turk.
@jusbgun1 @GrecoISU @ColombianBoii11 @halftime_h_ @realDonaldTrump Now turn around and repeat that sentence to all the urban Democrats who are not working but still selling food stamps and flashing wads of their proceeds on Facebook. But what do you know about that? You’re not even American. https://t.co/y3FmoNSYCD

They were unable to participate in the reassignment of their land to white people after Democrat Grover Cleveland signed off on the act in 1889.		This is after Democrat Andrew Jackson pushed through the Indian Removal Act in 1830.		Right, Rudie?
@CallidusDominus @Ch4rlieT4ngo Pursuing a Master Degree in Medieval Studies precludes you from being able to call anyone else a “fool”.		Hurry up and make my latte.
@krassenstein Know what else? Word has it that Trump eats muffin tops and leaves the rest of the muffin for other people so they get muffin sads. That fiend.
@wdunlap @IceMule__Nation @KamalaHarris This is right on the heels of Jazmine Barnes’ mother LaPorsha Washington trying to blame the shooting of her daughter on an innocent man, even when the shooting happened with her present. #DiversityandInclusion

@TheDeepState6 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump You’re biased. All you know is nonsense.
@pajoephilly @TheDeepState6 @realDonaldTrump Derp State is our resident schizophrenic. He thinks he’s a spooky team of bad guys that will overthrow the President. He won’t tell you his political beliefs because he wants to keep you guessing about something that doesn’t deserve your interest. Save your aspirin &amp; ignore him.
@TheDeepState6 It’s hilarious that you retweet your own tweets.
@Comey Tell that to @JussieSmollett.
@AOC That’ll teach them about how the “meritocracy” perceives yellow journalism.		Next gripe, Bolshevista.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Ted Lieu:		@PoliticalShort still hasn’t gotten an answer to his question to you about paying Abid Awan on January 3, 2017 &amp; then calling on government employees to leak information.		Why did you collude with Pakistanis to have them sift through Congressional data?		#hypocrat
@AIIAmericanGirI @TwitchyTeam Cher, the moonbat’s moonbat, correctly calls out the hippie socialist’s nonsense. As you can see, even a broken clock is right twice a day.

@thomaskaine5 @HouseGOP @SenateGOP First off, you’re retweeting your own tweets, which means you’re an attention sponge.		Secondly, I’ll counter your ignorant statement with something equally ludicrous, but harder to disprove, just so you can see the futile petulance you show the world:		Democrats hate Jews.
@SwampFox214 @TheDemocrats @AOC @GOP The average American Nazi couldn’t find his arse if a bell was tied to it.		@GOP rejects them just as much as @IlhanMN should have rejected the approval of David Duke. https://t.co/hlg4Rman9C
@SwampFox214 @TheDemocrats @AOC AOC’s Green New Deal was full-blown Socialist enough to include a provision accommodating those who are “unwilling to work”. Since that went over like a lead balloon, the Left pretended it was a mistake. https://t.co/UYfMyt9R1m
@SwampFox214 @TheDemocrats @AOC Liberals are on the wrong side, period.		Socialism is like bacteria. There are good strains of E. Coli that assist with digestion and protecting the body. An excess of such bacteria is lethal.		The modern left is apparently ignorant of the dangers of full-blown socialism.
@SwampFox214 Dems went above and beyond the normal call to scare off independent voters with rape and blackface scandals and the completely infeasible and dysfunctional Green New Deal.		You did @GOP’s work for us. Thanks again.

No current political figures come to mind when you hear the word “socialism”?
@SwampFox214 @TheDemocrats @AOC Nazis were Socialists. @GOP has always opposed socialists, especially the ones who hate Israel.
@SwampFox214 @AOC @GOP doesn’t need nebulous explanations to rationalize our losing control of everything.		We’re too busy enjoying the upper hand.
@SwampFox214 No, we’re not replacing anything to suit your narrative. It doesn’t work that way.		Closer to the truth, JFK would be repulsed by today’s Democrats.

How much more do you need to be owned before you know you’re owned?		Then again, look whom I’m asking. I mop the floor with you while you keep asking if I’ve had enough.
@TheDeepState6 @KamalaHarris You fail all the time, Quickdraw. Just because you say you don’t doesn’t mean everyone who’s publicly watched me do it forgot. Zing #5 is in the other thread where I debunked your infirm notion about enemy combatants.		If you want to take over the world, know how it works first.
@TheDeepState6 @ABC Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950) ruled that the Constitution does not apply to enemy combatants. She moved to Syria and is not a U.S. citizen, and is an unlawful enemy combatant per the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 2004.		Thank you for the opportunity to embarrass you again.
@TheDeepState6 @ABC Why yes, I heard about the Geneva Convention when I was in high school. Maybe you dropped out that day. 		The woman in question would be identified as an unlawful enemy combatant, as she was/is part of ISIS, a non-state actor terrorist group. https://t.co/lNko0G5sOm
@TheDeepState6 @KamalaHarris Page not found.		But you are cordially invited to troll me as much as you want. I’ll just use you as a platform to speak out against those whom you support while making you look foolish in front of a larger audience, since everything you say is a fail. Whatever, it’s your circus.
@TheDeepState6 @ABC Of enemy combatants?		Why say stupid things?
@TheDeepState6 @KamalaHarris Does he? Did you take pictures of it with your Deep State MicroSpyCamera (TM)?		Even if you think others don’t care about an AG pothead who put potheads in jail &amp; prosecuted POC parents of truant kids, Harris was also called out as a fake by USF faculty. https://t.co/LrYZhGlzW0
@LionelMedia @TheFirstShy She has proven to be above the law so far, so why start prosecuting her now?
@pixelpreaching So what is it that you do for a living that allows you to exercise your obvious gift of eloquence?
@PalmerReport The fact you have to talk that much to defend Hillary Clinton is the first sign that you should be second guessing yourself right now.
@johniadarola Kamala Harris puts Willie Brown’s money where her mouth is.
@ABC She should be taken into custody and forced to tell everything she knows about ISIS recruitment in the United States, or we’ll send her right back to ISIS who will immolate her in a cage with gasoline for betraying the Caliphate. This is a gift horse. Let’s take advantage of it.
@abibascencio Even better than your getting arrested for harassment and assault will be the reaction to your explanation of why you were infringing on the First Amendment rights of citizens.
@Melanch10844904 @AnonymousAda Know who didn’t threaten Lee Daniels or Jussie Smollett over a gay storyline?		#MAGA folks. Why?		They don’t watch “Empire”, so they likely had never heard of Jussie before he accused them of attacking him.		OK. Who sent the letter?		Either Jussie or the gay-hating Hoteps.
@charliekirk11 @life_gr8 Bring back the pillory. I want to see moonbats get pelted with rotten fruit and eggs in the town square for doing stuff like this. No cruel and unusual punishment, the humiliation is rightly earned. #JussieSmollett and #JazmineBarnes’ mother are first.
@TheDeepState6 @KamalaHarris It was when she did it. She even bragged about it on a radio show.		You’re not doing Kamala any favors. I can keep this up for a while. The more you troll me, the worse she looks. It works for me, so continue.
@TheDeepState6 @KamalaHarris You’re saying people know that she was smoking pot after coming home from a day of putting away people for smoking pot? Who wouldn’t care?		Well, maybe those people might care that she prosecuted parents of truant kids, disproportionately targeting POC. https://t.co/wWXNd3mf1j
@KamalaHarris You got high while busting people for pot.		If enough people know that alone, your campaign is finished.

You made a grammar fail using “aught”, you ganged up on me with 2 other people defending LaPorsha Washington’s purposeful misidentification of her own daughter’s killer as a white man &amp; endangering him, &amp; the Nazis were proven socialist.
@NativeOjibwa @KamalaHarris That’s also a woman who used to put people in jail for smoking pot, then go home and get high.		She also prosecuted parents of kids who skipped school; POC kids were disproportionately affected. https://t.co/JT5s3AHeif That’s about as far from keeping it real as you can get.
@harikondabolu OK, what if Trump were Imam Hussein?		Ready to offend Muslims too, or are you only going after soft targets like Jews and Christians like the rest of the liberals because you’re afraid of what will happen?
@krassenstein Brian, the Republicans can’t stop winning. I think you jinx the Democrats.
@WWG_1WGA_ @alaughrun To moonbats, it’s not rape if you can abort the evidence right before birth.
@NathanLerner @DemWrite The way to avoid these pitfalls is to stay in school, keep out of trouble, pay your bills, and work hard. Once you do that, you’ll be financially stable, and you’ll see how the Republicans are able to enjoy this flourishing stock market.
@SquirrelTomatos I’m sorry I gave you the sads, gamer boi. Maybe you can go watch some manga and forget about the world for a while.
@SquirrelTomatos I can’t hate myself. I’m Republican. I don’t do self-loathing because I know the world isn’t going to coddle anyone. Besides, I’m a capitalist, and the stock market is doing great.
@SquirrelTomatos No, you’re the daft one. I personally believe in climate change, so that wasn’t “clear”, you just made a sweeping generalization typical of the left’s bigotry.		I believe in intelligent design and action responsible for the reaction that enabled the creation of life.
@SquirrelTomatos So by playing Halo 5 he learned everything he needed to pass the Pennsylvania Bar, after he dropped out of college? Is this what you’re suggesting?

@Heritage_Action @THETXEMBASSY Let’s just toss him over the border so he doesn’t have to break any walls to get into Mexico.
@SquirrelTomatos Weird.		I gladly know nothing about “gaming”. But there is a lot more stuff to know, like math, science, history and things that are useful. Nobody ever passed an LSAT playing Halo 5.
@Marie61418090 @TeedIsMe @EinsteinMaga Another extinct species of RINO.
@LisaMei62 @Bridget20917878 Every time a liberal cries, an angel gets wings.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Yeah, liberal hashtags are really scary.		Next time ISIS acts up, we’ll be sure to drop loads of #LiberalHashtags on them and wipe them out once and for all before @IlhanMN runs in to defend them.

@AOC FoxConn pulled a bait and switch that was typical of the unscrupulous practices of Chinese companies such as Huawei, whom Trump recently took to task. The experience made us more aware that the dignity of Chinese companies appears unsalvageable. Marxism &amp; capitalism don’t mix.

@the_real_Jef @dadamstowel @sprtnght @AOC That wasn’t trolling, Chromeo. That was a public service announcement to you moonbats.

@the_real_Jef @dadamstowel @sprtnght @AOC Ha ha ha. She’s used to mopping floors in a taqueria. That’s where you moonbats found her. She opens her mouth to switch feet.

@dadamstowel @sprtnght @AOC It’s no feat. Anyone with an education from a decent high school could make her look ridiculous.		Democrats seriously lowered the bar with her.

The #Democrats’ party has descended into a system that ethically excuses non-participation in workforce and anticipates running damage control for it.		The #GreenNewDeal is a soft revolution intended to subdue capitalism.		We’ve come too far to become a Third World country.		@GOP
@TheDemocrats, we know you oppose @GOP in every thing from economy to general mindset, but you’re necessary as much as a broken watch is right twice a day.		You seriously need to take down the #Socialism thing. As any country that’s overused it will tell you, it’s not a toy. @AOC
The last New Deal from @TheDemocrats was after FDR assumed full control of government except the Supreme Court in 1933. Critics called FDR’s “deal” fascist. Hitler was a fan of FDR’s socialist approach before we joined World War II. https://t.co/OoBhiojKiI @AOC #HistoryRepeat
@krassenstein On a side note, I have to ask, why would you Democrats bring up another heinous historical blemish on your party right after being busted in blackface &amp; pushing a sophomoric deal to pay lazy people? Who is your strategist &amp; how much are we paying him?		@GOP. All we do is win. 🇺🇸
@krassenstein I’m glad you brought up the “Trail of Tears”.		It was started by Democrat Andrew Jackson pushing through the Indian Removal Act in 1830. Fifteen years after that ethnic cleansing ended, Democrats followed by losing the Civil War &amp; creating the KKK to liquidate black Republicans.

She’s figured out Santa Claus isn’t real. She’d also be the type to say “I’m Native Anerican? I look more like Woodrow Wilson than Woodrow Wilson.” She proved her ambitious charade true by apologizing to the Texas Bar Association for identifying falsely.
@krassenstein You’re right. Going forward, all minors traveling 4,700 miles to cross the border must be accompanied by an adult, unlike 2014’s batch that came on the heels of our opiate problem. On that subject, have you asked @HillaryClinton yet about why she screwed over President Zelaya?
@PhillyAdmirer @AOC Democrats said the “same thing” about Lincoln.
@PhillyAdmirer @AOC Ha ha ha. @AOC is our favorite Democrat by a long shot. She practically works for us. Her “Green New Deal” is something a tween would scribble up in a clubhouse. May she never be silenced for a second. She is our best bet with independent voters, and that’s what wins elections.
@AOC No, the @GOP concludes that your function is to throw bizarre smokescreens to obstruct the fact that the Democratic party is collapsing from scandals that illuminate its hypocrisy for the world to see, although no one is fooled by this tactic but the Left. #DemopocalypseNow

I feel like starting a moonbat conspiracy theory.		So @AOC is actually a Cuban Communist mole for Putin who is trying to make the Democrats swing so far left that they overthrow capitalism, and then Trump will hand Vlad control of the United States and we’ll become the U.S.S.S.R.
@ChrisCuomo Every Democrat has a low bar for everything. @GOP exists to be your quality control so the United States doesn’t completely hit the skids.		So how’s your new socialism pet project going? Did you bolsheviks replace the New York skyline yet?		What do undecided voters think? Grin.

@AOC No one’s immune to the law. 21 Savage had the famous Democrat style mindset and thought our laws didn’t apply to him, as did Tekashi 6ix9ine, who’s a poster child for “keeping it real” gone wrong.		So why are Hondurans coming to U.S.? Ask @HillaryClinton about Manuel Zelaya.

@dbongino @TheFirstShy @AOC is not paid to think.

@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The visual of Brian yelling this in a Richard Simmons voice shaking his finger is very amusing.
@JLRy @DailyCaller @MaryVought The irony is that you have no idea exactly how much that statement applies to @TheDemocrats. Your party is crumbling while you go further into the Russian #rabbit hole. While you’re down there, say hi to @HillaryClinton. https://t.co/cDsdA9bYyc
@DailyCaller Well played.
@Ilhan @GOP welcomes legal immigrants, but a socialist who sneaked into America with a seedy marriage, condemns Israel more than Iran and defends ISIS supporters is not invited to spend the holidays. #facts #WhoIsElmi #SocialistsAtTheGate
@funder More like a snarky biddy who just figured out she won’t make it to the liquor store before it closes. #PelosiClap
@AOC The “we’re flying without a pilot” snark comes from the socialist toddler who climbed into the driver’s seat of the Democratic party while they ran into the store and left the engine running. #SOTU
@SenSanders We’re busy, pothead. Send your hippie drones into the woods to pick up beer cans and let us run the country. We’re doing a great job as if you haven’t noticed. @GOP #SOTU
@ReElectNydia @thecjpearson @AOC You new socialist moonbats are as scary as a toddler with a soiled diaper. @GOP laughs at your futile attempts to look like you know what you’re doing, and you switch feet every time you open your mouths. Your moronic policies are burying you, and independent voters will end you.
@IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib That face when you realize your Democratic party is imploding from its hypocrisy right after you got elected.
“What has been will be again,	    what has been done will be done again;	    there is nothing new under the sun.” - Ecclesiastes 1:9 https://t.co/WF6UCACOCg
The best way to illuminate the hypocrisy of the #DemoKKKcrats  is to use their own media to showcase their transgressions. Once again, the original “boyz in the hood since 1865” showcase their racial exploitation skills. https://t.co/S1wTfANCKd
@krassenstein Nothing gets past Swami Krassenstein. He can see thoughts before they happen.
“Confuse the speech of my enemies, O Lord! I see violence and riots in the city, surrounding it day and night, filling it with crime and trouble.” - Psalms 55:9-11		And then Democrats were removed from power, the Occupy movement was silenced, &amp; the cities let out sighs of relief.
@krassenstein He certainly speaks like a a Democrat. Would he like to attempt impeaching Trump like the rest of you? If so, have another participation trophy ready.
The biggest difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans are united, while Democrats are a huge group-think mob of dissenting opinions who eliminate individual thought by attrition until they solidify into a completely interdependent mass of self-importance.
@sallykohn @staceyabrams Snore.
@mitchellvii A much easier statement to defend and one that is applicable everywhere is that the Left is evil.		The word “sinister” comes from the Latin word for “left”, they slaughter children on the threshold of birth, they’re removing crosses from churches, &amp; prisons are full of Democrats.
@mitchellvii ...and then they grow up and vote Republican.
@AOC In turn, we’ll wait until the financially hapless socialists find out about the 10th Commandment.		Let’s punish the socialists by giving them what they want. Test their tax plan in New York City alone and watch it turn into Detroit in one year.		Democrat policies ruin cities.
@repealtheheel @AOC Another view is that would-be socialists don’t plan for the future of their progeny since they expect to always suckle the State’s teat.		Being dependent on big government to live, their envy of capitalist prudence often results in mass incarceration.		#PoorByChoice #LetThemEatMe
@AOC In 1847 Friedrich Engels stated Democratic Socialists agree with Communists regarding “limiting private property in such a way that it prepares the way for transformation into social property... by progressive taxation, limiting of... inheritance in favor of the State, etc.” @GOP
@chasbottom @LifeZette The power of @TheDemocrats’ rhetoric seems strong enough to supersede the dignity of African Americans that has accumulated since their emancipation by Republicans in 1863.		Back in the 70’s, POC’s unwavering fidelity to another infirm mindset precipitated the Jonestown Massacre.
@AOC The new brand of Democrats wants your money.		If they don’t get it, they’ll just release the old brand of Democrats from the overcrowded prisons who will burglarize and steal it from you.		The forefathers were intuitive enough to predict this, hence we have the Second Amendment.
@washingtonpost If @vademocrats feel that Gov. Northam’s inherent bias is an affront to the core values of the State of Virginia, &amp; they believe Lt. Gov. Fairfax’ claim Gov. Northam contributed to a smear campaign against him, a recall election is one way to restore the integrity of the office.
@TheDemocrats’ Party is unraveling in front of the world.		That’s what you get when you play with #socialism in the land of #capitalism.		It’s not like we haven’t fought every form of socialism for the past 78 years.		Maybe this time they’ll figure out a little goes a long way.
@10CowboyUp @amore_sacco To which we Christians say:		“If thine eye offend thee, then stop looking at another man’s johnson.”
@RashidaTlaib @GM GM should be the property of the State, thinks Rashida. This is a great segue into subtly suggesting that Capitalism should be overthrown amid the division of the political climate. The Soviets demonstrated that leftist politicians of a revolution are afforded considerable power.
@TalbertSwan @jusbgun1 Your blaming all white people for slavery, including those whose ancestors didn’t arrive until last century, categorically makes you a bigot.		You can go ahead and be righteous in your own head all you want. The dictionary doesn’t lie. #hypocrat
@TenNamesLater @AOC The Democrats don’t pay her to think. Once you realize that, she’s predictable.
@RepLeeZeldin @jdforward @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi @GOP’s got your back, Representative Zeldin. Don’t wrestle with pigs. You’ll never fix Democrats. They don’t see their hypocrisy. The independent voters are who matter and who should have our attention. Take heart. God is on our side. 🇮🇱🇺🇸
@yumcoconutmilk @jdforward No, leave the article. I want the independent voters to see you calling a Jewish man, @leezeldin, a Nazi supporter.		Nazis are Socialists. So are Communists. So is @IlhanMN. She condemns #Israel as much as Iran does, and she defended 2 Minnesota men who tried to join ISIS. @GOP
@TheDemocrats are self-destructing. Lt. Governor Fairfax says he is being “smeared” by Northam supporters with a sex scandal, Catholic clergy is against the wall &amp; liberal pro-choicers are against them, &amp; the left wants to eliminate God, which doesn’t sit well with Christians.
@IlhanMN No, you would-be Socialists need to		✅ get through high school without having babies &amp; dropping out	✅ stop giving up on education	✅ stay out of trouble	✅ work hard &amp; with integrity 		&amp; then you’ll be one of those successful people whom the Socialists envy &amp; badger for money.
@TeaBoots @Jenn198523 I’m surprised @donlemon didn’t remind Gladys that white men are the “biggest terror threat” in the country, because she was surrounded by thousands of them at the Superbowl. https://t.co/PobJHRgd8A		The Bloods, Crips, MS-13 &amp; Marathon Bombers were not included in Lemon’s survey.
@jeremycorbyn @AOC You’re not going to “take on” anything in our country.		You can stay in England &amp; mind your own bolshevik business while we address our Socialist infestation, or you can answer to millions of cheesed-off Republicans who’ve fought socialists over 78 years.		Got that, Lord Snooty?
@purepuppypower @smalltownandrew @haybailsdj @CBS Kaepernick can take both knees with you and you can show him a few tricks of the trade. He’s not getting any more salary from football.
Speaking of elephants in the room, it’s about time @TheDemocrats addressed @SpeakerPelosi’s evident alcohol problem. Stop letting her ring up huge bar tabs on planes. She’s too old to drink like a sorority pledge on a hazing dare. https://t.co/hHIP6GKTG2 via @YouTube
@popdemoc @AnaMariaArchil2 @AOC @RepAOC We already have enough Democrat women who aren’t “well-behaved”, and that’s why you’re complaining that prisons are overcrowded. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
@johnmsides @igorbobic @GOP is pro legal immigration &amp; welcomes those who become citizens using the proper channels. As your article stated, 81% support this.		Many immigrants choose to sneak across the southern border, and the reason this is a problem shouldn’t have to be explained to an adult.
@funder @realDonaldTrump What makes a “bum” a “bum” is the fact that he has to “bum” money from successful people, and that is the reason why #Democrats exist. @GOP
@QTAnon1 This is not news. Many other animals besides attention-mongering liberals also eat their young.
@AOC You now have accountability for your statements since you’re no longer a waitress.		Prove that GoFundMe money being raised by the people in question is being used to purchase insulin. If not, we will dismiss it as another of your fallacies.		We’ll wait.		@GOP
I’d like to request a favor of fellow patriots. When posting a meme or article to back up your argument, check the source’s accuracy. Don’t give Democrats an excuse to call you a liar. Their own policies will bury them. We care about independent voters. Help them see the light.
@krassenstein It’s good to see the Clinton Foundation putting some of that kickback from Russia’s UraniumOne purchases to good use. @GOP
Thank @AOC for bringing #Socialism to us. We were tired of having to go overseas to fight it for 78 years.		Nazi: National Socialist	Communist: Global Socialist	Democrat: American Socialist		“...Hear ye indeed, but understand not; see ye indeed, but perceive not.’” - Isaiah 6:9
@letloverulemj @AOC Math is hard, but urban public schools all over the country are even failing the other subjects too, so there’s a bigger problem. It has something to do with truancy, dropout rates, threatening teachers, needing metal detectors in high schools, &amp; teachers failing their own exams.
@AOC Taking a knee doesn’t stop crime. If it did, a lot more police officers would be alive. It’s more effective to help those who create work for the police to change themselves instead of blaming the police whom we pay to catch them. #BackTheBlue
@josh_sanders2 @Brenderm1 The Antifa are essentially far left socialists. Their appearance and behavior are almost indistinguishable from Anarcho-Syndicalists.		The Democrats created the KKK in 1865 expressly to eliminate the black @GOP.		What do all of them, &amp; Nazis, have in common? Socialism. #facts

@KamalaHarris If everyone of all races, genders, faiths and backgrounds who will be voting is asked for proper identification to vote, why is everyone else able to provide it except those of whom you are speaking?
@Patriot988 It’s a good thing that the left is bad at getting themselves together, because if they had socialists in office at the time of the Occupy movement, we might have had Marxist unrest starting in San Francisco and Seattle. Are we going to fight Communists on our home soil this time?

@TheDemocrats The @GOP is doing everything in their power to keep illegal immigrants out, while Democrats are encouraging them to form caravans and enter illegally.		Too bad there’s no way to make registered Democrats be solely responsible for paying for all of their future voters’ needs.

We Capitalists don’t worry about jobs being stolen. That’s your problem. Hey, maybe you leftists can start your own little commune and grow vegetables and play folk tunes and drop acid together like back in the day. Nowadays there’s GoFundMe, so you’ll be all set.
@CrypticCarnage @IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @GOP The fallacy is that the #Capitalist can afford his own food and doesn’t need to take any food from anyone. We roll in cheddar. The would-be Communists fight over our doggie bags.
@tombrokaw Yeah, you’re like the Dad in “Get Out”.  Everyone sees right through you.
@hematech “Oh my God, look at Becky’s carbon footprint. It’s so big.”
@KamalaHarris It looks like you’re not making any good impressions because your would-be constituents are on to your game. From what I see in these comments, the “Wakanda Salute” in your video probably backfired. You have zero shot at the Presidency. Face it.

@DeepStateExpose This is a great time to bring up “mass incarceration” and why the Democrats have a problem with their filling every prison to capacity. If you want to fix the infrastructure, let the imprisoned Democrats do it. That way, they really can say they “built that road”. Everybody wins.

@IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies As I’ve previously mentioned, democratic socialism does work in Nordic countries.

@IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies Right. My argument is that Democratic Socialism would not work in America.
@IrishBitch9 @Martinsays2 @Radical1122 @notheoryofvalue @LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies Certain things work in certain situations.

@AOC Translation: @AOC would like for workers to take charge of the means of production, resurrect the Occupy movement to assist with the by-whatever-means-necessary overthrow of Capitalism, &amp; become like China who aspire to be Capitalist but need to steal U.S. tech to do so. #genius

@lisastark351 I’m Republican. I am condemning that execrable diatribe. The writer of that filth is not an exemplar of @GOP’s intrinsic values; he is a counterexample of a gentleman. This makes me a target for backlash, but it’s worth the disavowal of his allegiance. My apologies on his behalf.

You’ve said nothing.
@fToRrEeEsSt1 @Martinsays2 @JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper No, obviously you’re going to explain what you think you know, or everyone can then conclude you’ve been bluffing this whole time and you actually don’t know your arse from a hole in the wall, which is most likely.
@fToRrEeEsSt1 @Martinsays2 @JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Look at you all fired up telling people they don’t know what they’re talking about. You’ve got some stones on you. We don’t want for the government to get any larger. We like the competition between companies. You want to take charge of the means of production? Buy enough stock.
@fToRrEeEsSt1 @JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Please, son. I just explained that there are elements of Democratic Socialism in society. You’re talking about a dramatic shift. We’re not doing it. The engines that sustain capitalism in U.S.A. are firmly rooted and completely eclipse your upstart party. Watch what happens.
@fToRrEeEsSt1 @JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper No, you’re not that much of an idiot. Obviously there are socialistic elements in society. The point is the removal of capitalism is not happening. That’s all. If you want Democratic Socialism, head to Europe.
@fToRrEeEsSt1 @JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Just to learn one thing? That’s what happens at a public school in any major city.		Both types of you fastballs want to overthrow capitalism. Not happening. Try France. They’d love you guys, and they don’t like Israel either.
@GlutenAF @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper It would require some turpitude to lie about charity. I’m curious why you thought of that.

@JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper It’s very simple. The new litter of Democrats think they could actually make socialism work in America, the nexus of the world markets, and it can’t.		Then you pontificate about “nuance” when you just told me to “put down the blunt”. Physician, heal thyself.

@GlutenAF @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Socialist “cultists” like you are the reason why Greece is a mess. You also forget all that separates Socialism from Communism is an overthrow of Capitalism. Good thing for everyone your timing is out of whack. Occupy fizzled out years before this socialism fad erupted.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper You have, most definitely. But the tactics employed by a massive number of those on the left are that nasty. A Colorado middle school teacher, of all people, doxxed the #CovingtonCatholic kids.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper No, the “you” is intended as a random person, perhaps for example the adult Black Hebrew Israelites calling a group of underage kids “faggots”, “crackers” and “incest babies” because they wore red hats. If they tried that on adults, they would have been rightfully pummeled.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Well, there’s always the left ready to screw up and make perpetual problems to keep the government busy.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper And you’re free to disagree, and I won’t try to doxx you even though I know you’re wrong. That’s the difference.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper There are extenuating circumstances. It’s a big world with a lot of possibilities. Then there are government scammers who collect benefits while selling drugs and pretending to be poor while flashing their money online and bragging about it.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper That’s why there are charities. I give to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. There are multitudes of vermin who ask for donated goods that they turn around and sell on Facebook, and food stamps are also sold in scams.
@Dagsharp @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Fascinating. Then use them and take a walk.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper 3A. Or the alternative is for the guy you called a “fascist p*ssy” to knock you out like you deserve, dispelling the notion that you moonbats have this invisible shield of impunity where you can behave like a punk to anyone and get away with it.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper 3. No you don’t. That’s where you’re wrong. You have the right to mind your own business and let people live, otherwise law enforcement will clarify the distinction for you by making you a compulsory guest if the state for harassment.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper 2. Show me some of these people, and prove their situation is none of their doing.

There is also the doctrine of “put on your big boy pants, try not to get arrested, and think and act responsibly”. Thank God there are people who do. If everyone completely lacked accountability, there’d be nobody to clean up the mess.
@Dagsharp @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Yeah. Well, when I go to get some shoes, it’s good to know that the store is still there and hasn’t been razed to the ground by a temper tantrum ironically trying to send a message about a better society.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Don’t get all huffy, mademoiselle.		Stock prices are driven by demand of the product in question.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper A better world is one where parents make responsible decisions to ensure their children don’t endure hardships, where the general populace has actual pride in their country and try to be law abiding citizens, and where people are free to express themselves without harassment.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Do you really want to corroborate my point?
@Dagsharp @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Here’s a source backing what I “made up”: https://t.co/3IxyBhTFh4		So who do you know for a “fact” voted for Trump? Did you see even one of them cast a ballot?		Told you. Next.

@Dagsharp @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper OK, everyone I see burning a pharmacy and smashing a store window is a leftist. Which one of us can prove what he’s saying?
@biguglyhat @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Let’s take away welfare, food stamps, etc. and see who makes the most noise.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper It’s parasitic in nature to expect everyone else to pay for your progeny. It’s a slap in the face to humanity for New York to legalize late-term abortions. Making a mistake is understandable. Carrying a child to the threshold of birth and killing it is ghoulish.
@cpk289 @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Socialism is a consolation prize for the willfully or unwillfully incompetent. Capitalists don’t win at the expense of others. If a stock makes unrealized gain, that money isn’t made off the poor. They’re not even in the equation.
@Radical1122 @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @LeftwardSwing @DNC Sure, son. Talk to us when you’re not on the losing end of the Senate, Supreme Court, Presidency and a futile hankering to usher socialism into the center of world capitalism.
@JGoku18 @Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper So you come back with a nebulous response. Way to go.
@Radical1122 @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @LeftwardSwing @DNC I’ll let you do that. The left eventually eats its own. I’m not interfering with nature.
@krassenstein He probably didn’t realize he was talking to a Marxist, who are the reason why he has a wall around his place, given the fact that you guys would sack the place at your first opportunity.
Now late term abortions in New York assail the motherly instinct into oblivion. https://t.co/cmiX1UWiuN
@Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper We’ll see who’s the smart one.
@RashidaTlaib’s sister Layla Elabed is on the “No-Fly” list and has been for years. Only about 10% of those in the Terrorist Screening Database are raised to that status.
@Squibbles @LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper It’s useless to project your leftist drug use on me because you have no argument.
@LeftwardSwing @Martinsays2 @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper Maybe the left needs to live responsibly and within their means, for example by not having more children than they can afford to raise without government assistance. Socialism and high tax brackets are vain methods to compensate for the left’s irresponsibility at others’ expense.
@LeftwardSwing One of my favorite events is when liberals retweet other liberals’ misread quotes, thereby illuminating their infirm reading comprehension for the world to see. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
@LeftwardSwing It would be funny, except I said “[Bernie] is a socialist who espouses the Nordic economic model”. Obviously you’re still smoking dank buds, “my dude”.
So @KamalaHarris stole her campaign slogan from a comic book. Thank you Democrats. @GOP https://t.co/XTVNS1KRrf
@Martinsays2 @LeftwardSwing @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @andersoncooper I also wanted to see if you’d run with the AOC2020 ball, since you’re getting behind a ditzy populist who doesn’t know how to implement the system she’s advocating.
@Martinsays2 @LeftwardSwing @Squibbles @AOC @GOP @carterforva @AOC has no plan. Everyone including @andersoncooper laughed at her 70% idea, so she said “OK, reparations for slavery”, acting like that includes “brown people”, while she can’t stop reminding everyone she is one. That’s redistribution of income, not socialism. She is clueless.
@LeftwardSwing @AOC @GOP That’s right.
@ShannonBream America is the seat of capitalism. A sandbox scenario where we could safely observe the effect of socialism on the stock market would end the idea. As Margaret Thatcher said, “[Socialist countries] always run out of other people’s money”- after theirs, of course. Ask Greece.
@LeftwardSwing @Squibbles @AOC Perfect. @GOP thanks you for your support. #AOC2020
@LeftwardSwing @AOC @GOP Ha ha ha. I’d vote for her if I could. She would be the demise of the Democratic party.
@LeftwardSwing @Squibbles Oh no. We love her. She’s perfect. Bet the house on @AOC for President. Ha ha ha.
@LeftwardSwing I heard that, and immediately dismissed it. @AOC could fall out of a boat and not hit water. She has no idea what she’s doing, and she is a @GOP favorite because she’s an endless source of fallacies and hyperbolic impractical ideas. I strongly encourage her to run for POTUS.
@LeftwardSwing @ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies Your hearing “multiple debunked talking points” in those two sentences proves pot is a mild hallucinogen. Regardless, it’s preposterous to think that a socialist who espouses a Nordic economic model could be President of the country that is the nexus of the world markets. #math

@KamalaHarris The alternative is to stop having more children than you can afford to raise and expecting everyone else to pay to raise them. #accountability
@KamalaHarris Tell that to San Francisco.
@AOC @RashidaTlaib @LindseyGrahamSC You failed to condemn Black Hebrew Israelites shouting “crackers”, “faggots” and “incest babies” at a bunch of white children, yet you keep reminding everyone you’re a “brown woman” whom people are trying to suppress. #hypocrat #socialist #YourAgendaIsShowing #CovingtonCatholic
@Martinsays2 @soledadobrien @GOP Voltaire as well as the Republicans approve this statement. #1A
@KamalaHarris That’s coming straight from the “progressive prosecutor” that allowed San Francisco to become a drug infested toilet. For that achievement, moonbats are propping her up to do the same to the rest of America as President.
@soledadobrien Let me put this in your language:		Just as women dressing a certain way doesn’t give anyone the right to harass or intimidate them, a bunch of children wearing red hats doesn’t give anyone the right to harass or intimidate them.		Your hypocrisy is clear. #CovingtonCatholic @GOP
@NorthNJDSA @DemSocialists @RashidaTlaib @AOC You’re not Communists yet. The Occupy movement failed to overthrow Capitalism.

@thehill Too late. That’s why we have screenshots, freshman. It’s better to just avoid saying stupid things like your 12-year-doomsday-prophet colleague.

@TheRightMelissa So the first thing everybody finds out about the Black Hebrew Israelites, since the average person had never heard of them, is that they like to pick on minors. Next time we’ll send an adult delegation and see if say anything. If so, the matter will be addressed summarily.

@IlhanMN I bet the minors probably had to ask an adult the definition of “incest babies” and “crackers”, but they probably understood “faggot”, and when the Black Hebrew Israelites spat on them, their opinion of the white boys was obvious. So they can pick on underage kids? @GOP
@ChrisCuomo Harris was born in Oakland, California. The “birther” thing is moot. The problem is that she is a typical Democrat enabler of criminals under the guise of a “progressive prosecutor”. What did she &amp; London Breed do to San Francisco that tourists have avoid human waste and needles?

@AOC As a shock to no one, you’re making it a race issue because the negative attention to the stupid things you say really bothers you, so you throw a race card hoping criticism will stop. Nobody accused you of cursing. You just don’t read well, which is not surprising.

@Kayii_ Now say something that really happened.
@TalbertSwan Oh, is that what all “wypipo” are doing? I didn’t get the memo. I’d better catch up with all the bigotry you’re accusing us of constantly so I don’t tarnish your negative image of “white people”. Thanks for the notice. #hypocrat #racism
@lesbiansicheng @ultziyang Representing “wypipo”, I don’t think about Chinese boy bands at any time ever, and since we white people obviously all think exactly the same, you’re lying.

The Democrats are suggesting that if the #CovingtonCatholic minors said anything wrong, they should be accountable. OK then, from now on, when a 16 year old son of a Democrat shoots and murders someone, he stays in jail permanently just like an adult.

Well, in order to do that, after we eliminate everyone who didn’t own slaves, you’d have to prove your family were slaves, and then finally, in order to get paid, you’d need to present the same ID you’d need to vote, but since you won’t do that, it’s not happening. So, never. https://t.co/asx6xFzU9g
@nachosarah If he has a difference of opinion, it doesn’t give someone the right to walk up and start verbally abusing him. I don’t yell at the actual communists who hang out near the local college because that’s not what a civil person does. Instead of making a scene, I do it on Twitter.

Can you imagine a kid calling his mom a “f**king b**ch” when you were younger and living to tell about it? That’s common now. Then again, Democrats just made “motherf**ker” a household word.

@ScottWFaya @RevoltPolitic @PaulSorrentino3 @ProgBlacksmith1 @People4Bernie @NoFascistLies @LeftwardSwing Yes, continue plugging for Bernie Sanders. He will be a black hole that sucks liberal votes into oblivion once again.

@SenSanders If other countries are doing everything so correctly, why do people risk their lives to go to America? Socialism here is nothing more than a temporary pet fad, perpetrated by a gaggle of grievously fiscally naive freshmen... and you.
I recommend a libel lawsuit against the liberal media outlet who saw red hats and immediately twisted the narrative. @GOP https://t.co/4Tf6lULPYs

@MollyJongFast @KevinMKruse @MrJonCryer @TomiLahren @iamcardib Yes, Cardi B’s degree from Shake Joint University makes her a heavy hitter in the political world, according to Democrats. @GOP
@TheRickWilson Yes, all that political acumen and polemic wit that Cardi B accumulated while dancing around a pole in clear heels makes her a Democrat force to be reckoned with, without question. @GOP
@TomiLahren No she wouldn’t. She has a delusion of wit and political acumen that’s typical of rap moguls like Kanye. You went to UNLV and got a degree in broadcast journalism while Cardi B danced around a pole in clear heels. No contest.

@thehill Nobody has to mess with “Bronx women”. If the pair of them are a paradigm, they clown themselves just fine. Nobody really takes @AOC seriously. She’s like the Democrats’ cute new puppy that pees on the rug and annoys the guests. Think I’m wrong? Wait and listen.

If the present anti-Semitism of the Democrats’ new litter of Socialists persists and gets more clamorous, Jews will have to choose between being Democrats and supporting Israel.
@MSNBC Roxanne Jones wrote a piece on @CNN complaining about too many white women being present, and that she wasn’t there to “take back her [privates]”. Sounds like someone didn’t check their privilege. You’re free to figure out who didn’t. https://t.co/XUBkDRJ3e6
@MahgdalenRose @Cernovich Meanwhile, Young Socialists are leading by example, making “motherf**ker” a household word, tweeting ominous warnings to the President, winning 4 Pinocchios from @washingtonpost for misstated facts about Pentagon spending, and wandering around trying to find @SenMajLdr’s office.
@NRO @kathrynlopez Smile back, said Marcus Aurelius.
@PalmerReport While Democrats were throwing back frozen drinks by a pool in Puerto Rico, @realDonaldTrump took China to task and they agreed to a $1 trillion plan to eliminate the trade deficit in six years. Anyway, go on about his lack of negotiation prowess, but spare the petulance. @GOP

Timing is everything. If this new litter of Socialists were around at the time Democrat-sanctioned Occupy was in the streets trying to overthrow capitalism, we might have had an October Revolution and this would have been a very different country by now. @GOP @Nasdaq @DowJones
@BreitbartNews She came in talking smack, saying “@realDonaldTrump has met his match”. She asked for it. The squeaky liberal gets the grease.
@freedom_moates So @TheDemocrats elected a Muslim from Somalia, home of the al-Qaeda network al-Shabbab, who asked Allah to “open their eyes to the evil doings of Israel”, is now threatening the President, and is going to harass Christian schools for not embracing homosexuality. @Ilhan, #ItsOn.
@chucktodd Chuck, your industry seriously jumped the shark. People are going to give liberal media grief, and to be completely honest, you guys begged for it. Take it like a man, not a non-toxic-masculine liberal. @GOP
And while ⁦@TheDemocrats⁩ were busy claiming the wall was “inhumane”, smugglers were busted with $22,000,000.00 worth of cocaine at the Mexican border. ⁦@CNN⁩ ⁦@FoxNews⁩ ⁦@GOP⁩ #BuildTheWall #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder  https://t.co/sYCzeQyNny
@BuzzFeed That’s dangerous. Take BuzzFeed for example. They posted a fake story about Trump online and didn’t give a “heck”, and now no one will ever take them seriously again, so they’ll write articles like this and “What Is Your Cat Trying To Tell You?”. #FakeNews @realDonaldTrump @GOP

Then you berate that apparently 32 year old man you’re speaking to who didn’t do it. Cool off.
@tictoc @Ilhan Yes. @GOP are their biggest fans. Thanks in advance for handing us 2020 by a landslide due to your incompetence, lack of self-awareness, ignorance of the way things work, and stumbling over your own points in interviews.
@soulbrotha215 @BrendaO50001332 @Ilhan What does showing an ID have to do with Jim Crow? The idea is that everyone gets asked for ID, just as people have to identify themselves to get WIC and government assistance. If everyone of every color is asked for ID, that’s not racist. Show ID like you do for everything else.
@christa_maiers @secupp @IlhanMN “Becoming” a bad look for Democrats? That’s like telling a guy he’s going to get wet after he fell overboard. No matter. Undecided voters will remember these Democrat antics and their partying in Puerto Rico while Trump took China to task and won the trade war in their absence.
@Independent Fascinating. I believe Trump might have a mole on his arse that the jaded media hasn’t exposed. Better jump on that if you want an exclusive.
@R3Thorns @ChrisMo37540912 Maybe @Gillette knows. They’re experts in the testosterone-challenged arena.
@mitchellvii Young Socialists: “Fine! As long as we take charge of the means of production, you can take your capitalist freedom and go invest it for all we care!”

@AmazingJasonF @PaineVer02 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Moonbats tend to sleep through History class. That’s why they repeat it.
@GOP @TWITMO_INMATE @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats are a political party whose constituents habitually have more kids than they can handle and expect all of us to pay to raise them, and who just put a fiscally dim immature Socialist former bartender in charge of a Finance committee.

@jeepsuzih2 Some day he’ll grow up and vote Republican, but first he needs to quit smoking pot and get a job. Hopefully the other juvenile Antifa window breakers will follow his example and get out of their parents’ house. Mom and Dad have dropped too much cash bailing the punks out by now.
@AOC @funder Mitch will be checking to make sure your parents signed your permission slips for the Senate field trip. Pizza and soda will follow.
@RashidaTlaib The issue is not that you’re a Muslim. The issue is that you are close with Abbas Hamideh who supports the terrorist group Hezbollah, and that you are anti-Israel. Let’s see how far you go in American politics with those traits. No doubt we will watch you closely. @GOP
@RealSaavedra Watch out, @donlemon, @ChrisCuomo is white, so according to you, he’s automatically a terror threat. Don’t sit too close to him. #hypocrat @GOP
@CillizzaCNN Because Democrats are stupid enough to put a fiscally challenged Socialist in charge of the House Financial Services Committee of a Capitalist country. Wait until she “runs a train” (q.v.) on that the way Barney Frank did to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. @GOP
@chrislhayes Democrats, in the meantime, will continue to legalize non-medical marijuana because pot is a mellower high. They’ll also make sure there are plenty of places to safely shoot up without being bothered, like San Francisco. Holler, @KamalaHarris. @GOP

Then again, it’s not like we give a dry dog turd what some CNN propaganda drone thinks. Leftists, if you want real news, follow @NPR.
@JMWoodSr @ZNEWSNET Only Democrats listen to the ramblings of ghetto rachets and comedians. That’s because they have so much in common.
@thehill @SenKamalaHarris San Francisco turned into an actual drug-ridden cesspool on Kamala’s watch. Her input regarding whether drugs come from an airport or over the border is useless since she was District Attorney of a city where people now have to step over junkies, their excrement and used needles.

@AnnCoulter After three deportations, derelicts like this should be considered “enemy combatants” and hanged. Then we’ll see who wants to wander in and corrupt our society.

@hrtablaze @USALoyalty1776 It’s part of #WestchestersMostWanted’s scheme to make her look like she’s “keeping it street” so she could fool Hispanic voters into putting her in office. #YoureARichGirlAndYouveGoneTooFar
@politico And if you don’t like it, don’t work there, and don’t be a liberal and apply there just to make an obnoxious point, like Sandra Fluke trying to make Jesuits pay for her contraception. Gentiles don’t force rabbis to eat cheeseburgers. Let people live according to their beliefs.

@washingtonpost The phrase “illegal alien” never died, since it’s categorically correct. If you’re here illegally, and you’re an alien, you’re an illegal alien. It was only “dead” to Democrats because they didn’t want to disenfranchise one of their most prominent voting blocs.

@MotherJones Your urban Democrat education is probably to blame for your lack of interest in reading. Regardless, you’ll predictably defend everything you didn’t read as usual. Maybe the liberal authors can draw up comic book versions of their drivel so it will be easier for you to digest.
@NYTMetro @AOC I think @AOC ought to get her fellow #Socialists together and continue to try to overthrow #capitalism so they can bring in #Communism like #Marx said. The U.S. defines capitalism and has fought wars against #Communism. #Democrats are unaware that their new pet is their demise.
What’s the over/under she’s not a Republican? #RacistGOP wants to know. @GOP #hypocrat https://t.co/WjcrQJASfY
@thehill And the charges will be addressed in exactly the same way as they were for @BillClinton. Any further questions?
@AOC Maybe it’s because you’re a Socialist and you already split all your cash with the other Socialists and came up light in the wallet. Is it sinking in yet? #capitalism
@TheDemocrats don’t even realize that #Socialists are going to dissolve their party. If Socialists succeed in overthrowing #capitalism, you will have Communism. The U.S. doesn’t want to become Venezuela, so there will be infighting on the left, and the Republicans will prevail.

@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is running the First World, and you’re drinking highballs at the computer and pretending you’re a news agency so you can dedicate your time to making up “zingers” about him. You therefore score much higher on the loser index. #fail
@MindUnguent @MSNBC @maddow @GOP @AOC Whatever, fastball. Just keep letting her make as much noise as possible. @AOC makes us look better by the second right in front of your faces to undecided voters. She’s like your cute new puppy that soils your #Democrat carpets and annoys the guests. @GOP are her biggest fans.
@krassenstienn @MSNBC @maddow @TheDemocrats’ outrage at that joke picture is interesting, seeing as you’re the deviants who came up with the nickname “teabaggers” for the Tea Party and who have turned “motherf**ker” into a #liberal household word. #hypocrat @GOP
@MindUnguent @MSNBC @maddow Hahaha. @GOP LOVES her. We would love if @AOC were to even run for President. She’d eventually have to debate Elizabeth Warren and bring up  her “cultural appropriation” of Native Americans. Then we’ll see who goes crazy. #TheLiberalAgendaOpposesItself

@AviMavet @LOLGOP Talk to us when you #Democrats have a majority in the Senate and Supreme Court as well as a sitting president. You should be thanking us. If not for @GOP this country would be a third world wasteland of flaming businesses and minimal police protection. @TheDemocrats are obsolete.
@AOC Well, you tend to say things that indicate you have no idea what you’re talking about, but your “overwhelming attention to race” game is great. You’re the ideal #Democrat.
@krassenstein #Democrat’s kid: “Mommy, what’s a ‘motherf**ker’?”	Suburban #liberal soccer mom: “Where’d you hear that?!”	DK: “Kyla’s two moms say it about Trump because they hate him. You don’t like him either...”	SLSM: “...”	DK: “Anyway, I have Miss Jones this year. She’s a motherf**ker”.
@AOC Not to distract attention from yet another race comparison, but 100 (stylized as 💯) is as much percent as there can be. #math
@krassenstein I see a #Hypocrat is suddenly drawing attention to the death penalty for treason. So then what does @BarackObama get for sucking up to Cuba?
@Lordstanley2016 @krassenstein Said the guy who can’t spell “overseas”.

That why so many of their kids end up in therapy diagnosed with recently created acronyms. Sit down, Waldo.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP 1. New account after quitting for a while, old account started 2009.	2. Your perception of “privilege” means nothing. The simple fact is that you project your racism on others.	3. I don’t keep “stats”. Is that supposed to impress people?	4. You can walk away any time you like.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP You can keep this up all you want. You’re flawlessly supporting my point in front of countless people, and it’s beneficial to make a counterexample of you since your sentiments are a paradigm of ignorance.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP I was expecting you to say that, seeing as racism appears to be a joke to you. Of course you can say what you want. I’m a proponent of people speaking their mind. You, however, just can’t realistically be taken seriously regarding racism since you participate in it yourself.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Care to explain that nebulous comment, or are you just going to continue floundering about without an argument?
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Even if I were wrong, you’re incapable of proving that I am. Want to tag in someone else to take over for you? You’re really not good at this. Regardless, due to your own hypocrisy, you’ve lost the “privilege” of calling out racism and being taken seriously. Realize that.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Hey, whatever, you can retire your argument. Just remember that you have no right to complain about racism when you participate in it yourself. Your input was disappointing at best. You don’t want change; racial tension is evidently good enough for you because you perpetuate it.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP You’re an insult to those who realize racism is an issue, and you’re keeping racism alive. Care to dig yourself further into your own hole, or just run away when you’re wrong? The choice is yours. I can point out how wrong you are for days.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Now the correct appraisal:	1. Black man makes sweeping statement about old white men	2. White man is rightly offended	3. Black man plays like he didn’t make a racist statement 	4. White man clearly points out the immature responses of black man	5. Black man flees under pretense
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP No, you’re acting like a toddler, making racist comments and pretending you didn’t, and then attempting to escape a discussion under pretense because I rightfully accuse you of acting like a little boy. You make a mockery of the work of MLK and Medgar Evers. Run away in shame.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Then you are partly to blame for racial tension. Anyone can see the cavalier attitude towards racism. It’s not an issue to you, it’s a joke. Since it’s a joke to you, there’s no reason to take anything you say on the subject seriously. That angers people who care about it.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP The fact is that you’re a fake. You ironically make a racist claim wrongfully accusing others of racism. Therefore, you forfeit the right to complain about racism, since you’re the problem. You keep it alive. You’re the one who’s responsible for negative sentiment. #racist
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Yeah, son. Your piddling “I didn’t say all white people” argument is something a little boy would say. You don’t get to make unwarranted racist accusations like Shaun King and then complain about being the target of racism.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP No, you’re racist because not only did you just made a racist comment with complete impunity, you’re discounting it and vainly trying to deflect and deny it in front of thousands of people. It’s not just us who see this. I believe you should apologize for your racist comment.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Hey, you’re the one who made a racist comment. Explain yourself. Why? I’m white and I feel insulted for good reason.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP As a matter of fact, you would show more integrity than Shaun King by apologizing for your unwarranted indictment of white men. Let’s see if you have enough character to do so.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Accept your racism. It’s part of your character. You’re not going to stop making bigoted comments against white people just because of this exchange. But at least have the stones to admit your bias.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Your ham-handed deflection isn’t working, son. It’s patently racist to say old white men suppress POC’s voices. Did Pete Seeger or Noam Chomsky do that? So there’s your first fallacy. Secondly, the Shaun King example is relevant since you just showed bias against white men too.
@TheDemocrats You kids aren’t making any headway. It’s time to end the game and #buildthewall. There’s a reason why Republicans still have the Senate, White House and Supreme Court. Your arguments are silly. There’s nothing inhumane or racist about protecting oneself against a known threat.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP So, any more smug responses, self-proclaimed “geezer”? Yeah, didn’t think so. Try and play nice, OK? @GOP
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Oh, and finally, let’s not jerk around - your peers would gladly annihilate anything that opposes their stances. Ask Chick-Fil-A how they were railroaded out of their Boston location &amp; the baker who conscientiously objected to baking a gay wedding cake and received death threats.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Hey, don’t feel bad. @shaunking did the same kind of thing recently and nearly got a white guy killed for blaming #JazmineBarnes’ murder on him because Shaun has an anti-white agenda. What you’re doing is a lot more passive and less volatile.
@5fifthsgeezer @AOC @GOP Yes, the #Democrats are turning upon and consuming their own supposed agenda of equality with accusations of suppression, by you, of a POC member by “white men”. You’re the backward thinking one, as is evidenced by your comment. You are actually the racist that stunts progress.
@JewhadiTM It’s no surprise that liberals are testosterone challenged. At least they haven’t destroyed football yet. Wait until we finally get sick of the PC overload and go back to giving them wedgies for being obnoxious.

The “white men wringing hands” to whom Mr.Roberts is referring are Ocasio-Cortez’ fellow Democrats. @AOC’s own party is trying to sedate her, and she’s “clapping back” against their suppressing her #Latina identity.

@GregJKrieg @shaunking Weaver was supposed to be making sure the “Bernie Bros” weren’t sexually harassing female workers, but when you get too many pothead misfits in one setting, they tend to take out their high school rejections on women no matter who’s in charge. #BernieSaysWomenDreamAboutRape #tcot

@krassenstein @AOC The interesting point is that Clifford Walker, in true #Democrat form, neglected to precede the word “immigrant” with the word “illegal”, which is the point. The flawed thinking of #Democrat extremists, like the KKK, is the reason why @GOP continues to thwart them successfully.

@thekylie_show @LOLGOP So state your point. Is your point that cops are racist? The world is watching. Don’t play.
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Yes, you preposterously imply that your police protection has an agenda to subvert minorities versus one that prescribes stopping those who infringe on the property or welfare of others.
@thehill @HillTVLive She seems to forget that #Democrats are chomping at the bit to create a collective nanny state where people are affronted and exiled for having a different opinion. Maybe that Armenian girl should read up on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. #gop #tcot
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP So, the fact that you are here in the first place implies that you are a #Democrat, assuming you’re not here to successfully shoot holes in every theory that he presents as am I.
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Well, firstly, the logically impaired fool who originated this post espouses the dubious mission statement that @GOP should be an object of ridicule, ostensibly forgetting he’s a #Democrat and believes his thought process, given @TheDemocrats’ deviation from efficiency, can work.
@KamalaHarris Neither should be there anything partisan about wanting accountability on the part of those who are seeking health care or benefits who are able-bodied and capable of working themselves, yet do not elect to do so. That is all we are saying. #gop #tcot
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Well, #Democrats are the progenitors of minority control. #Republicans put their lives on the line to thwart them in 1861. So, what is your point?
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Oh yes, and Ben Franklin created the first Fire Department in Philly 1736 because black people were cooking BBQ in public parks. Right? That could be defensible.
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP I mean, this is not a “#metoo” moment. You know you already intrinsically hate cops, right?
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP I’d like to see a record of that interaction, including notes of your response to being told that it’s difficult to apprehend someone of whom you can offer little description, while you are unaware of why you were targeted. Cops are humans like you. Help them help you.
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Oh, and if you want to go there, I’m sure you know the #Democrats created the KKK in 1865 with the implicit purpose of eliminating Black Republicans. What’s similar now? The leftists’ collective virulent response to being denied anything, e.g. the Occupy movement and Antifa. #gop
@thekylie_show @LOLGOP Well then, true believer, the next time you’re assaulted, robbed or have your property damaged, you can just stand there wondering what you’re going to do about it. Then you’ll call the police, and they’ll put themselves out of their way to assist you. #gop #tcot #cops #facts

You’re just around to clean up after us while you complain that we don’t hand over what innovation, education and good business choices created. You can still burn flags and destroy bank machines in your spare time as usual. #gop #tcot
@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists But am I mad? Of course not. You drones gave me a great holiday party idea. As a joke, I’ll have a guy make a fake M&amp;A proposal talking like Gucci Mane. “Yo, dap me up son, I’m finna make a IPO.” Hilarious. #gop #tcot
@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists Wrong again. Chuckle.	bastardize - corrupt or debase (something such as a language or art form), typically by adding new elements. “a strange, bastardized form of French" i.e. exactly what “black” English does. But you have no argument, so you throw race card #2 - white boy. 😀
@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists Wrong, mental midget. You fell for it. Nothing I said in my original post was racist. I stated that purposely bastardized English has no place in the corporate world since no company is going to allow someone who speaks such a way to negotiate business. Any idiot knows that. #gop
@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists I wouldn’t waste my pretty face on a bunch of socialist underachievers. I resumed Twitter on Sunday after 4 years because I missed reminding leftists that they are the root of all problems, especially European bolsheviks who slither into the US and whine about capitalism. #gop
@TheSun I don’t think “I’m going to force you to have gay sex for Allah” is going to go over well with the Ayatollah. He meant well, however in the most homosexual way possible. He’ll be thrown off a building by other Muslims if the video goes viral, and that irony amuses me enough. #gop
@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists Said the guy who makes insipid posts with his picture and location right next to them.	“Hey, I saw that clown from Twitter driving up 128 near Weymouth, MA texting and laughing to himself.” #gop #tcot
@ConvosWYPIPO Suit yourself. Walk away knowing we own your brain (ref. your setting up an account dedicated to us), you don’t know politics and are publicly proven wrong, and that interaction with you did nothing for my ego since you’re not even distantly a challenge for me. Run along, kid.
@KamalaHarris And the moral of this story is:	Study hard, stay in school, and you will get a bonus instead of just a layoff. #gop #tcot
@TheDemocrats Well, you #Democrats better tell Rep. Keith Ellison and Senator Archie Parnell about this development. Their woman-beating might confuse your message just a bit. #hypocrat #gop #tcot
@Independent At least the #Democrat didn’t beat the woman as usual. #gop #tcot
@ConvosWYPIPO I succumb to no delusions, unlike you, who is under the delusion that you know what a metaphor is. This is the “snowflake” definition, kid. https://t.co/2LYoARYyi5 Got any other obsessive #wypipo observations, since your account says we own real estate in your head? #gop #tcot
@ConvosWYPIPO Well, the fact you’re alive and well means your original comment was a lie, so, yeah, I deny what you’ve said. Also, you got it wrong, kid. Leftists are snowflakes. It has to do with your needing safe spaces to cry and hug when people are mean. Try using terms you understand.
@AbenaGyekye Wow, you sure showed us #wypipo that you take no mess and you’re definitely not petty. White people, get this girl a cupcake. She earned it.
@CouncilOfMan We #wypipo don’t let petty trivial things bother us, especially comments that paint us all with the same broad brush we get told not to use. No “woke points” for you, fellow white person.
@bokchoifresh @PhilibertLeslie @cnni Nothing’s lost on #wypipo. All we do is win.
@__theycallmetai @kiaraakiwii The funny part is that #wypipo would do better without you, but you’d be lost without us. Just isn’t fair, is it?
@teboho_mx Years of dealing with blapipo.
@drippindaya If #wypipo did “get the f*** out”, you’d last about six months on your own. #fact
@ConvosWYPIPO It’s amazing you’re still around to post fallacies. You’d think #wypipo would just go about their lives without going out of their way to find ways to always kill you as you said. You’re an inspiration to everyone else who suffers delusions of persecution. Congrats. #gop #tcot
@TheOnlyBaggio How would a high school dropout know who passed out in History class? #wypipo
@AMERICUHHHH We’ll start disagreeing with you as soon as you make sense.		Love, 		The #Wypipo

@myruss2003 @TalbertSwan Why are #wypipo mad? It couldn’t have anything to do with all “wypipo” being collectively blamed in this instance for the actions of one white trailer park punk or being called “wypipo”... Hmmm, what could it be?? #gop #tcot
@TheVokality @TheBeardedDre We “wypipo” say who cares if we’re wrong, we still own everything.
@BeingMessyy Oh, we’re so sorry to steal words from your language, Mrs. Africa. We know how much time you put into inventing it. We just wanted to show how much we appreciate what you’ve done with our language, tryna make it hip, knowhumsayin yo? #gop #tcot #wypipo
@NationGarza @ParkerMolloy In response, “Wypipo” are satisfied that no amount of virtue signaling is going to change that fact that “Nation Garza” is of the “wypipo” himself and will never accede to what he perceives to be the plateau of POC coolness. He could probably use a hug right now. #gop #tcot
@Ace_VenTURNUP You would be too if you had to deal with blapipo robbing, selling food stamps paid for out of your payroll, pimping, leaving dirty needles in playgrounds, shooting enough of each other to make the evening news interesting, and turning around and blaming you for everything.
@nairimbelike @nellypink_ But keep your food stamps. White people don’t need them because we have credit and tend to not have more children than we can afford.
@StowWreka Meanwhile, and to this day, Africa is still the poorest and most underdeveloped continent in the world, so obviously “blapipo” weren’t doing anything major with spices at the time. #wypipo #yt
@vyntage_lo Because black people are busy complaining about everything else and blaming “wypipo” for all of it.
@NatiaKenyatta Update: “Wypipo” ain’t scared of that type of “sh*t” either.

@CainnechPol @BlackSocialists Ken’s consensus is further proof that we don’t need verbally challenged people in the white collar world. That’s why Ken probably paints houses or delivers packages for a living. He doesn’t like a comment, and a grammar school response is the best he can do. #gop #tcot
@SocialistViews @tearfulclasswar National Socialism is Nazism.

@BlackSocialists Is this post tacitly seeking approval for using purposely broken English during multi-million dollar transactions? Maybe that’s why you don’t sit in the corporate big boy chairs. The consensus may be that if your English is terrible, your math must be heinous. #gop #tcot

@MSNBC Yeah, we’re lying. What we mean is that we don’t want them and their headaches. Tell them to go back where they came from before the U.S. has to stage coups of the three Murder Triangle countries and set up a Second Banana Republic in Central America. Think we won’t? #gop #tcot

@business China’s “transformation” is the net result of stealing intellectual property from the United States. It’s amusing to watch China aping the flagship of Capitalism while touting itself as a Communist country. Clearly, irony is as lost on them as is innovation. #gop #tcot
@AFP China has ridden USA’s coattails. No more tolerating their hacking &amp; stealing to compensate for their lack of innovation. Huawei learned the hard way not to mess with the United States. Behave yourselves China, before we do to you what you do to us, only successfully. #gop #tcot

@Lawrence Dear Lawrence O’Donnell,		Why do you, a self-proclaimed “European Socialist”, think that your opinion is useful to the country that is the seat of Capitalism, and why are you a “European Socialist” in light of the failure of the Nordic Economic model?		Sincerely,		Not A Socialist

@MailOnline There’s a gift horse for any actual thief with brains enough to follow them. They’d have a tough time explaining how things went missing right after they pretended to stage a heist. Sociam Darwinism in praxis.
@putnamca @SenFeinstein @MiraSorvino You try setting up a party for 7000 unannounced guests who refuse to identify themselves and let us know if everything goes right.		Democrats just say things.

@SenFeinstein It’s only going to get worse with every new caravan of 7,000 non-Americans coming across the border looking for healthcare too, among other things such as everything. At this rate, we’ll have to start selling off major corporations to give them all that they want. #gop #tcot

@SenateDems Would you kindly translate your comment into English so that the Republicans might be made aware that they need healthcare coverage as well? They tend to speak the native language of the country in question. #gop #tcot
@AndrewGillum If we all have to play by the same rules, then why does the left have to declare “voter suppression”? Why don’t the competent members of the Democratic party just help those who have trouble following the rules instead of concluding “it’s too hard”? #gop
