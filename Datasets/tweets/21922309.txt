@usa3000rustic @EaleyGregory @DetectiveJonesy @johncusack Pete is running for sure. I will definitely hear him out.

I have my first choice but I will hear out everyone.
@SenSanders still hasn't reached out to the black community.  Black women are the bedrock of the Democratic party and he hasn't tried to even talk to them.		He will not win their vote. He will not win the nomination bc of that		He isn't even a registered Democrat.
@thomaskaine5 He can do what he wants. He still hasn't reached out to the black community.  He will not win their vote. He will not win the nomination bc of that.  Black women are the bedrock of the Democratic party and he hasn't tried to even talk to them.

@TheRickWilson Fairfax should resign because he's a rapist over and accusation		he said northam shouldn't resign because black face is just distasteful not racist. He defended it for over an hour		Then he blocked me once I called him out. https://t.co/wWL8ybJpgo
@TheRickWilson I love idiots when they contradict themselves so much. https://t.co/YDvDzdAs9H
Currently blackface is you know....just  distasteful now https://t.co/l2bfkWGRJX
@OnTheCaseMan @WajahatAli And as I said you feel it's an acceptable trade for someone in blackface to be a leader of a state. And the fact that you call it distasteful instead of racist proves my point about you. 		ASK A BLACK PERSON IF BLACKFACE IS DISTASTEFUL
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax I said before by definition if a woman accuses you of rape and you did not do it you are a rapist in your own words
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax the fact that you've spent over an hour arguing why blackface shouldn't cause you to lose your job is a testament to you more than me trying to say that this woman should prove her case and if you did it he should be in jail
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax as I said if it can be proven and doesn't violate the sixth amendment he should not only resign but he should be in jail you on the other hand think it's okay for someone in blackface to be governor
@OnTheCaseMan Someone who's been accused of a crime with no facts or proven is the exact same thing as someone who admits to being a racist. Keep proving your side it's great
@OnTheCaseMan @WajahatAli So someone who admits to being a racist and someone who has been accused of something and hasn't been proven are the exact same.  Got it.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax Sure buddy you keep defending northam all you want for his black face
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax So by definition your ok with a "misogynistic rapist" being let governor in your own words.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax You said someone wearing it shouldn't lose their job.  Defending blackface is allowing someone who is a racist to keep their job when they admit to doing so.
https://t.co/oCLL99lgqQ
The definition of hypocrisy is saying the statement below, while calling for a white man wearing blackface to keep his job over an admission while calling for the firing of a black man over an accusation. https://t.co/xTbOdQfKEb
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax Here are your own tweets		One is you defending a white man for blackface that he should keep his job over an admission. 		The second is you saying a black man should be fired over an accusation 		You claim to defend the Constitution. For white people only it seems. https://t.co/7UYdU2B1p8
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax Yet here's you calling for his resignation. 		You're not very good at Twitter https://t.co/eiWhSR9qXs
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax He can keep his job if he wants to. It's his right.  My opinion is he isn't a leader for all of the state if he wears blackface.  He broke no law. He's a racist. You defend his wearing blackface.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson As I have said all day every day. Anyone should speak out if they were assaulted. And the accuser has the right to a fair hearing or trial to present the evidence. You are for judge jury &amp; executioner regardless of facts. You are also think blackface should keep their jobs
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax I'm literally using your own words against you
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax You contradict yourself on an hourly basis it's laughable
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax Your hypocrisy is very republican in value.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax I #believewomen and I'm all for #metoo but I also defend the Constitution and the 6th amendment to due process. it's @RalphNortham first amendmenx right.  I'm not saying he should or could be arrested. But he should resign because it's racist. I won't defend #BlackFace you do!
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax You literally contradicted your own stance on the Constitution. You want Fairfax out because and I quote you always #BelieveAllWomen no matter what is accused regardless of someone's 6th amendment right. Yet you defend the Constitution for a person to wear blackface. GOT IT
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Ok so if a woman comes forward saying you raped her then you are a rapist. Got it
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson @LGJustinFairfax https://t.co/pazKsL3zCq
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Here's you saying you stand with the Constitution almost one hour ago and also violating @LGJustinFairfax 6th Amendment rights in 1 hour.  You stand with the Constitution when it's a white leader in blackface but not when it's a black leader accused of a crime. https://t.co/HascinHEL2
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson So if a woman says you raped her and you did not we should believe her is what you're saying.  Am I correct?  Yes or no.  Answer this question.
@josh_weinberg It's almost child abuse to take a child to something like that and force them to listen to it
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Not at all. She should be believed and he should be in prison if the facts back up her accusations. 		Or should anyone who accuses anyone of a crime without any proof be believed always.  		So if you didn't rape a woman and she accuses you we should believe her first right?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Ok I don't hate women nor have I defended anyone who did something wrong to them.  I've said Fairfax should resign and be jailed if he raped her.  		You however think it's perfectly acceptable for a leader to be a racist and keep his job.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson I'm not the one supporting people who wear blackface.  And I'm not supporting Fairfax. I'm saying if it happened then he should be jailed
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Lol yah that's exactly what I said. Nice making up things.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Def not.  No one would ever accuse me.  So you think anyone ever accused of rape should lose their job. Regardless of what the facts say. Just based on opinion. Is that right.?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson She should be believed that it happened. And if she proves he did it he should resign.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Yes he should resign and be arrested if he did it.  I don't defend him if he did it.  		You however defend northam
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson She deserves to have he day in court to face her assailant and prove it happened.  The end
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson If it happened he should step down 100% 	He should also be arrested as well
@OnTheCaseMan @WajahatAli I can keep this up all day.  So let's.  I'll never stop attacking you for defending blackface. It says more about you than me
@OnTheCaseMan @WajahatAli Youre attacking a person saying move on if you did blackface.  I guess you didn't see your implied attack
@OnTheCaseMan @politico Yes one actor. Congrats. One black actor who was established was in a movie with a black face white person. Congrats. 		I'm still not defending blackface
@PrisonPlanet It's so obvious how terrified of a 29 year old Latina you are.  It's amazing
@OnTheCaseMan @WajahatAli I see you're still defending blackface.
@OnTheCaseMan Scapegoat?  Calling on a white people who wore black face to resign is scapegoating???  		I'm sure you don't know what a scapegoat is https://t.co/mP4SIv5phu
@OnTheCaseMan @politico Yes because black people in the 80s  had unlimited acting choices. 		What planet do you live on. 		You are the definition of white privilege.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson No it's good that you said that I'm just pointing out that it took you a long time to say it
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Took you what, 40 messages and me asking for you to say that to say it.  Nice
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Still haven't seen you say anywhere that blackface is racist and gross
@OnTheCaseMan @politico Apparently you haven't been a struggling actor ever lol
Keep defending a racist who wore blackface.  It's a good look for a white guy to say he shouldn't resign over blackface and he can effectively lead a state with black people. https://t.co/waCpKiry4Q
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Lol keep defending a racist who wore blackface. That's a good look for you.
@OnTheCaseMan @politico You know as an actor you are forced to do that.  Interview them and I'm sure they don't appreciate that film. Doesn't make it less racist.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Ok then continue. Call him what you want.  I still refuse to defend what northam &amp; the other guy did with blackface. Prove fairfax raped her and I'll say he should go to
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Oh well in that case trump is a rapist. Glad I can say that now.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson It was always unacceptable 2 people who are not racist. it was only acceptable to people who wanted to dress in black face or people who were okay with it. But still racist. 	It was never acceptable to black people. That's the difference
@OnTheCaseMan @politico It was never acceptable to black people.  That's the difference. It was never acceptable to people who find it racist. It was acceptable to white people who defend blackface in the 60s-80s. 		It was always racist
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Saying F that bitch and saying fuck this are not the same. As I said if there is a tape of it then it's gross and yes he should go.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson No, you calling him a rapist directly is defamation because he has not been convicted of it. You are not saying people are saying he raped someone you are literally calling him one. Learn the English language and the definition of law you claim to defend
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson I'm not saying people who don't agree with me a racist and saying people who defend people wearing blackface erases. Never once did you say what he did was horrifying and racist you've just been defending it from the beginning
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Calling someone a rapist if they didn't rape someone is defamation.  Calling someone a racist for wearing blackface when they ADMIT it is a fact.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson How do you prove he raped her. 		I'm saying if he did then not only should he resign he should go to jail. 		You're saying nah let a racist be governor. Blackface is alright with me.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Rape is someone who raped someone. How do you prove someone raped someone? 		Opinion ?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Correct it is not against the law but it is still racist and you are defending it		You are defending someone who admittedly wore blackface and should stay as governor. 		I am saying if Fairfax actually raped her and it can be proven then yes he should go to jail.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson I also love how you refuse to answer the question
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson So you are rejecting the definition of law got it
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson so by your definition if someone accused you of rape even if you didn't do it you're a rapist because they accused you
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson IF you rape someone.  Rape has a legal definition. Was he convicted of rape yes or no?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson I'm sorry was he convicted of rape?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson You're not a rapist until you're convicted of it. One accusation doesn't make someone a rapist. 		But defending someone who wore blackface does make you a racist
@revivevb @TheRickWilson 💯!  also I was never saying what you did was horrible I was just saying it's our privileges white people that we sometimes don't even think about what others go through. Keep doing a good job
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress An accusation is not a crime. yes there is nothing in the legal code that says you need to disclose those things but it also isn't democracy if you withhold things from Americans.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson They already are running the government. Trump should have never been elected in the first place because of the crap that he said and that was on tape. Fairfax is statement that he allegedly said was never on tape
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson He actually didn't say that he allegedly said F that bitch to which there is no video to prove that he did. It's someone claiming he said that multiple other people are saying he never said that.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson And also to clarify someone is cleaning Fairfax Eff that bitch.  he and his people and people there in the room say he never said that so unless someone finds a video proving he did it doesn't exist
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Are you saying misogyny is equal to racism? Historically in America it is.  Black people we lynched. Women were not lynched by men.  		What he said is bad. After he was accused by someone. Northam did it cause he wanted to.
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress how democracy works as people vote when they get all of the information not when things are publicly hidden from them on purpose you know like all of trumps crimes, racist statements, or past crimes you may have done.
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress Call it whatever you need to call it
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson As I have said over and over it's not a crime but it's extremely racist.  He should resign over that.  but hey if you wanted to defend the white guy who wears black face and is racist for it go right ahead there reflects more on you than anyting
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson How is calling someone a name and wearing blackface in the same realm. I never said anything close to that
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson Calling someone a bitch and wearing blackface ARE NOT THE SAME.
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson And if he wants to he can do so. That isn't racist. It's maybe mysoginistic. It's poor judgment. He should have his day in court to face the accusations. If he did it he should go to jail!
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress So if someone in public office was a plan member 35 years ago and never told the voters they should be allowed to be in office still?  Not saying  northam was but I'm making a point.
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress It's still racist stop excusing it! 	You are literally making excuses for a man who wore blackface and admitted it. Wow
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson And you still didn't answer my question was he convicted or accused?
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson No it is not and I never claimed it was but it should disqualify him for being in public service. He admitted to it that's racist. Fairfax has been accused but doesn't mean he did anything it's an accusation. Trump is accused by like what is it 18 women?
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress Having hate in your heart should disqualify you for public service. 		also anti-gay actions are not a crime in some states. You can fire someone for being gay legally you can tell people you don't want to serve them legally those are still anti-gay actions
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson I'm sorry was he convicted or accused?
@revivevb @TheRickWilson And that is white privilege. The fact that you never even thought it could be offensive.
@garydmclean @TheRickWilson Yes you were 6 &amp; 7. Not in your 20s huge difference
@OnTheCaseMan @GeoffRBennett @MeetThePress Well there are things people shouldn't have done because they were dumb or silly. There are things that caused pain to others. 		Then there is rape or racist or anti gay behavior that is inexcusable. Sorry
@OnTheCaseMan @TheRickWilson How is calling someone a bitch racist? Do enlighten me.  		Fairfax has said it was consensual. She says it was rape. The last time I checked there is a court or crimes like that.  If he did yes he should. 		Northam admitted to doing black face. 		Anyone defending it is racist

@kurtkuczynski @MoJames324 @heierup @CoryBooker @GOP It's not all about murder.  Assault is a serious crime.  That happens a lot more than murder and because of race gender and orientation it happens more than you obviously know
@kurtkuczynski @MoJames324 @heierup @CoryBooker @GOP Where as normal assault can beinimal. You have lived a privileged straight white male lifestyle.

@kurtkuczynski @MoJames324 @heierup @CoryBooker @GOP Then that would be a hate crime perpetrated by the gay person.

My prediction is by the end of all of this when history is written about the Trump administration, Nixon will no longer be the comparison for government corruption.  He will be lost to history because it is nothing compared to what will be uncovered. You can bet on that
The idea that a sitting president cannot be indicted is a direct assault to the Constitution. that the president is above the law &amp; not be able to indict him while in office for crimes, is laughable		By that definition he could murder someone on tv &amp; not be indictable.

It makes perfect and total sense why Trump never release his taxes. 		He never expected to win the presidency		He did not want to expose his businesses and family into potential money laundering and fraud		His taxes will prove the Russia has been funneling money to him for years

@GOP @PressSec Yes that's true. What is also true is American citizens commit more crime than undocumented immigrants.  		No "illegals" commit mass murder like all the shootings that occur on a weekly basis and kill 40k Americans a year.
@CBSNews @NBCNews @ABCPolitics @MSNBC @CNN 		@realDonaldTrump &amp; admin will do anything to get their wall.  Even if it means lying about terrorists and immigrants. 		DO NOT give them a place to push unchecked lies to the American people. 		Do not cover his speech tomorrow

@RichardGrenell @peterboykin I love how conservatives are fake outraging this as if they care about gays. Their policies and party platform suggest otherwise
@peterboykin Let's see. The religious freedom bills that would actually trump, pun intended state worker right protections and allow corps to fire gays for just being gay or trans.  There's that one.
@peterboykin @ScottPresler @Deadspin Yes. Gays can hate immigrants too.  White gays esp. The gay community is some of the most self hating racist filled community.

@travler76945 @ScottPresler @Deadspin Except that's bs. Conservatives made any sodomy laws to imprison gays about what they do sexually. They made it illegal to serve in the military and get married.  		Conservatives claim they don't care yet legislation says otherwise

@PolitiBunny @BossMan49601013 @truthandfiction @MuslimIQ Because we have more opportunities here in the United States than anywhere else.  Asulum is asylum if they want to apply they can. That's our laws.

If you had a choice you know which you would apply for.  No guarantee they get it but that is how you apply for asylum. At the border.

Almost 69 million people voted for Democrats in the midterms. Almost as much as voted for Trump in the 2016 election yet they lost the Senate.  		Democrats have to fix gerrymandering to win normally
Gerrymandering is a cancer on our democracy. In North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan the majority of votes went to the Democrats but the majority of the legislature seats went to Republicans.  It's cheating and it's garbage.

By trump ignoring the @CIA about the #KhashoggiMurder by Saudi Arabia imagine what happens when one of these countries he loves like Russia or North Korea or Saudi Arabia AGAIN attacks us &amp; chooses to believe it wouldn't happen.  		Trump is a threat to national security.
Trump has attacked the FBI, the vets, the navy seals and now the CIA because of Saudi Arabia murdering #Khashoggi 		He sides with dictators. 	He makes excuses for murderers. 	He calls mobsters good people. 		He is trying to destroy our democracy. It's in front of your faces.
@realDonaldTrump I can't wait til you are removed from office.  First you attack the FBI. Ad not the CIA. You are a vile racist mysoginist and I can't wait til youre gone and I hope I live long enough to see what the history books say about your catastrophic presidency.

71 people are dead.  More than 1000 people are MISSING in Northern California. 		This is climate change at it's worst. This was the worst fire in history for California. 		The final death toll is going to be shocking. 		We need to change as a country of death will continue.

@realDonaldTrump You just hate California because you lost by almost 4 MILLION VOTES, the most for any @GOP candidate in the history of America.  You also had the lowest GOP support in the history of California.
@realDonaldTrump People have died. You literally have no empathy. You are a sociopath. I will laugh when your children get indicted. I will cheer when you are finally indicted impeached resign or lose, whichever comes first. Your cult followers will not be able to do anything

@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump No people want to ban AR-15 and similar things to them by the way we once had an assault rifle ban on semi-automatic rifles for 10 years and guess what the murder rate by guns went down in those 10 years and went back up after the ban was removed
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump And where do you base that on. Do you have statistics showing that that is the case
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump I want a ban on high-capacity magazines. I want registration of all bullets.

@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump But the suicide rate is not from guns. Were you have guns you have a higher chance of death from gun that's a proven fact

@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Yes but in that same year there were 11348 people murdered by guns.
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump That's actually not true either.  The murder rate has been in steady decline over the last 20 years.  The more educated an area the less gun violence and murder occurs. It's a statistical fact.  The more guns the more guns violence. Death by gun is much higher in homes with guns
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Actually hate speech is banned under the first amendment. There are restrictions to the first amendment.
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Armed with that success, Colt ramped up production of a semiautomatic version of the M-16 that it sold to law enforcement and the public, marketed as the AR-15.		When Colt's patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models.
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump In 1963, the U.S. military selected Colt to manufacture the automatic rifle that soon became standard issue for U.S. troops in the Vietnam War. It was known as the M-16
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump That is 100% incorrect.  There is such a thing called Google. 		ArmaLite first developed the AR-15 in the late 1950s as a military rifle, but had limited success in selling it. In 1959 the company sold the design to Colt.
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump In 2015 60000 people were killed with guns.  If this was a disease something would be done.  If this was a terrorist attack we would be at war. Period.
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump That is just not true.  The main cause of gun murders in this country is not gang violence. Where are you getting this nonsense.  Approx 25000 people are murdered by guns.  45000 were suicide by gun.

@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP That's not addressing my point that I just made youre glossing over it
@ttaylorfitness @RepDeSantis I guess we'll just have to wait till 2020 to see who was right on that election too
@ttaylorfitness @RepDeSantis you can believe your polls I'll believe mine we'll see who's right during the exit polls that are actually taken by asking people when they vote
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP That's literally all I am personally asking for.  Is that infringing upon anyone's right to own a gun besides criminals or people who can't pass a background check
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP That's it.  Just background checks to governor gun shows and the loophole they have and the giant loophole of private sales. That's it.
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP Why have any laws at all then by that definition
@ttaylorfitness @RepDeSantis Are your definition Fox News is also mainstream media

@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP Know the laws on asking for the ones that feel in the loopholes that's all not additional feeling in the parts where the law doesn't cover

@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP We agree. I'm realistic I know we can't stop mass shootings for good but we have had 308 so far this year.  Reducing it by 50% would save tons of lives.  But the GOP is against all forms of background checks
The numbers coming out of Florida's exit polling or definitely suspicious. There is no way on Earth @RepDeSantis got 18% of black women, the most likely group to support Democrats.  There is something wrong in Florida, yet again. https://t.co/FejPN6gS1k

@DevilDawg123 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump The USA.
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump There is no flawed logic. The math behind it is sound and it will surpass previous years, it always does
Whoever works for @AndrewGillum who told him to concede should be fired.  Gillum should unconcede now that it is in recount territory https://t.co/TcAJ5p0FiJ
Question for all those who feelthere is nothing we can do to stop gun violence because criminals will always get guns and do harm.		Why do we have any laws if criminals will break them?
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump And no I don't worry about those things because I am not. I don't support the one that is Donald Trump the cult leader himself
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump doesn't matter if they're Gang Related or anti-jewish related or just some lunatic with a gun related they are mass shootings I never claimed what kind of mass shooting they were. I said mass shooting by definition that's what they are
@PkMstrChewb @CurdsandEh @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump You obviously have no clue how political Asylum Works in our country do you?
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump And plus don't you live in a country where they've already banned firearms? Or severely restricted them
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump I'm not attempting nothing I'm using your words that you said yourself
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP I just think there should be background checks on every single gun sale in this country whether public or private. If you can't pass a background check you shouldn't be able to own a gun is that complicated? Or are you for people not being able to pass background checks
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP not on every purchase there isn't. If you sold your gun to somebody else through a private sale you don't have to perform a background check you don't know who that person is.There are gun shows in this country in some states not all states that do not require ID to purchase guns
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP I don't sit and worry about another country invading my home or our own country. I don't sit there and think that the government's coming to get me these are not rational worries in America
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP That's not answering my question
https://t.co/ghum8BkPWq
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ghum8BkPWq
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump More than four people shot are considered a mass shooting by definition
Immigrants or caravans are not coming for your children or wives, mass shooter white males with guns are
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Really you're trying to say a reduction in mass shootings is a good thing if it doesn't reach the same level. This is pathetic
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP Then why has Congress blocked background check legislation the entire time it's brought up every single time
@JulesBrien27 @PkMstrChewb @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump white people have been told to be scared for years of minorities whether it's black or Latino or Muslim terrorists are coming to rape or kill them in the streets wear as actual statistics of that show it's not going to happen
@DevilDawg123 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Oh is that how it works. Then why do we give money to Israel. It's not our problem right or why are we in Afghanistan 17 years later.
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Oh ok so no increases. Math is hard
@Dad2two @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Explain how those do not condone violence
@Dad2two @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Get him out," he said of a protester. "Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court. Don't worry about it."
@Dad2two @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump "He's walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing," Trump said. "I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you
@Dad2two @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise," he said on Feb. 1, 2016.
@Dad2two @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump “any guy who can do a body slam, he is my type!”
@PkMstrChewb @Shinybronze @JulesBrien27 @gonzales_derik @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Oh yes because they banned guns and they don't have any mass shootings anymore same thing with Australia and Japan it's almost like banning guns stops mass shootings
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP You are one of the rare trump people you agree with common sense background checks most do not including the NRA
@PkMstrChewb @CurdsandEh @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Yes because they want asylum not to invade. Stop listening to Trump and Fox news. Any wonder he hasn't mentioned the caravan once since the election. They changed the name of the operation at the border to just border assistance now
@PkMstrChewb @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Where did I say that.  I said background checks on every purchase should be the law. Is there a problem with background checks?  Is stopping even a quarter or half the mass shootings a bad thing?
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump In 2016 there were 340 mass shootings Obama last year in office 	2017 345 mass shootings. 		In 2018 so far 311 days in we have had 307 mass shootings so far.  54 days to go. Odds 		So 3 years 1000 mass shootings.
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP I never said it was a privilege I agreed with you saying it is a right. I may not agree with everyone being able to own guns but it's still right in the Constitution
@american4Trump1 @KateBarnard11 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump I wonder why he stopped talking about the Caravan did he claimed Democrats want to just let in without having any checks whatsoever
@OneOfTheSmiths @american4Trump1 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP Right God forbid we have background checks on everybody who buys a gun. Or stop gun shows from being able to sell guns without IDs or background checks in some states
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP This isn't from the media it's from the Constitution and court rulings. Reading can be hard sometimes I get it
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP No you have the right to freedom of speech to not be infringed upon by the govt but at work you can't say anything you want. You can be legally fired for speech courts uphold that.  You can't scream fire in a movie theater. Hate speech. Limitations. Learn the Constitution
@JSantora3 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Just since Nov 1 we have had 6 mass shootings. 		Nov 1- Minneapolis 5 shot. 	Nov 1- Springfield 4 shot 	Nov 2 Tallahassee 8 shot 	Nov 2 long Beach CA 4 shot 	Nov 3 Watertown ny 5 shit 	Nov 7 thousand oaks 23 shot. 		18 dead, 31 shot. 		America.
@Radio_Attitude @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately trolls have no education in don't understand laws either
@american4Trump1 @OneOfTheSmiths @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump @RCMP unfortunately this guy is correct gun ownership is a right in America. However there are limitations to rights in the same way that you don't have the right to free speech under every circumstance you shouldn't have the right to guns under every circumstance
@KateBarnard11 @american4Trump1 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean like Fox News?		the media doesn't divide anything they report on the facts Trump lies every single day multiple times a day they just report on it and you don't like that neither does he
@realLogicBot @theonly1Avenger @JulesBrien27 @PatriotMama911 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump But most guns don't have extended magazines like this asshole did in Thousand Oaks.
@NativistBill @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump It's called math and murder rates per capita you can figure it out or maybe you can't but we can us has the highest rates regardless of population
@PkMstrChewb @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Illegal immigration into the US from Mexico is actually down. Learn some facts most of our illegal immigration actually comes in from overstay visas via Plains. Canada does have a drug problem from its Southern border Americans bringing drugs into their country
@KCL80 @gonzales_derik @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Actually mass shootings have increased under Trump versus under Obama
@shanekeel7 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Why's that?  Because he is for equality And cares about people vs white nationalism?
@JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump He's a wannabe dictator
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Nope. Never encouraged violence at all
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump "Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type!" 		Referring to a congressman who bodyslanmed a reporter
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump On July 2, 2017, Trump shared the doctored video, from a 2007 WWE skit in which he is seen taking down WWE owner Vince McMahon. In the version Trump shared, McMahon's face is blocked by the CNN logo.
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head],". "Like, 'Don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody, don’t hit their head.' I said, 'You can take the hand away, OK?'
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Get him out," he said of a protester. "Try not to hurt him. If you do, I'll defend you in court. Don't worry about it."		And these were just during the campaign season of 2016
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump At a Las Vegas rally later that month, he said security guards were too gentle with a protester. "He's walking out with big high-fives, smiling, laughing," Trump said. "I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you."
@jimmyepolito @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just knock the hell ... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise," he said on Feb. 1, 2016.
@BostonShorty71 @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump I would argue the Pittsburgh Massacre had something to do with Trump because of the anti-Semitism it's been flowing freely in this country since his election
@JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Trump is a total cult leader.
@e_double_d1990 @theonly1Avenger @JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Well he did want to be better than Obama at pretty much everything
@OverstreetJimmy @sunshine2cats @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump There have been 307 mass shootings already this year. We are not in the 307th days yet so that is more than one per day so far		https://t.co/Xe6chu2Do9
@JulesBrien27 @PatriotMama911 @theonly1Avenger @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump I don't like Trump either, at all even, but he's not the cause for the mass shootings.
@JulesBrien27 @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump funny how that works Canada England and Australia have strict gun laws and yet no mass shootings? I wonder if there's a correlation at all
@joanschulze @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump It's almost like those things don't do anything to anybody
@patriot_dc @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump So I have any laws at all if criminals are not going to follow them?
@Lucas84599343 @sunshine2cats @OverstreetJimmy @Couximag @realDonaldTrump So why have any laws if a criminal wants to do it they will do it.  Why have murder laws or rape laws
@JimFConley @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump But it has limitations. Just like the first amendment does. There are limitations to free speech. Should be to the 2nd one too
@Why45huh @Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump No. It's called statistics. You can look them up.  They don't happen there
The list keeps going https://t.co/zdufALpgXY
@Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Japan has no guns. England has no guns allowed either. Or extremely hard to get and they have criminals. But no mass shootings. I wonder why. Maybe healthcare maybe quality of life is better. No major corruption by leaders. Brazil has a major problem &amp; the gun ban isn't it
@Lucas84599343 @Couximag @realDonaldTrump Again. Canada and Japan have criminals. But they don't have mass shootings
