Come lava or high water, there's no excuse not to vote today! Absentee ballots were automatically mailed to voters affected by the lava on #BigIsland and the flood on #Kauai.
When voting for District 5 ‚Äî beware! The name of current Councilmember Jen Ruggles is listed on the primary ballot, but she is not seeking re-election. Ruggles dropped out of the race after the primary ballots were printed. Votes for her will not be counted.
#BigIsland Mayor Harry Kim‚Äôs seat is not up for grabs this election. But there are multiple candidates running for all but two of the Hawaii County Council seats up for election.
Four seats are open on Maui‚Äôs nine-member county council, with 3 candidates campaigning to represent the West Maui, Kahului, Makawao-Haiku-Paia and Molokai districts.
On #Maui, the battle for the mayor's seat has attracted 7 candidates. Mayor Alan Arakawa is term-limited and cannot seek another four years in office. He‚Äôs running for County Council instead.
7 candidates seek to replace Carvalho, who is campaigning for Lt Gov. On the Kauai County Council, the largest candidate field ever -- 24 candidates -- are running to fill seven seats.
Kauai County is ushering in an era of political change as Mayor Bernard Carvalho bumps up against term limits following a decade in the executive chair and a field of two dozen candidates vie for seats on the County Council.

USGS's Wendy Stovall: Methane explosions are generating blue flames that are rising through road cracks. If the methane gas gets trapped underground and is ignited, it can cause a very large explosion. Photo: USGS #kilauea @CivilBeat https://t.co/btmTr3COyc
USGS's Stovall: "We saw an explosion last night just after 10 p.m. that pushed up an ash plume to about 8,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level." More detection equipment en route to summit to better monitor activity.
Wendy Stovall of USGS: "Overnight and into the morning we're seeing a really long ling of low fountains occurring from these fissures." The highest fountains are about 200 ft.

It's not enough, some advocates say, for the state to have agencies focused on NH issues; NH need to govern their own affairs. @AJStream
A NH govt could also take over from the state the job of managing Hawaiian Home Lands and move ppl back onto the land. That's huge @AJStream
A gov't focused exclusively on NH issues could bolster efforts to relieve NH homelessness. @AJStream
Could give NH community equal footing as the state in resolving land disputes such as mismanagement issues on Mauna Kea. @AJStream
Good Q's: Would NH be better off w/ or w/o the US? Is total independence realistic? Could fed rec help return NH to their lands? @AJStream
Others are boycotting, saying the state shouldn't be involved in the process. Still, there are about 100K certified to participate @AJStream
Among some NH, the hope, excitement that election could be a game changer is palpable, esp. now that pathway to fed rec is open @AJStream

By the time fire officials arrived, the boys had pulled themselves out of the water.
The resident kept an eye on the boys and called 911 when he saw them fall in the pond.
A fire official said the teens, both boys, had been walking around the ice without skates despite thin ice warnings from an 89yo resident.
2 teens fell through thin ice into the brackish water pond on Willowmere Circle in OG. They've been transported to Stamford Hospital.

Police said the suspect is still at large and trains are back up and running.
Greenwich and Metro North PD shut down trains after getting reports that the suspect might have boarded one, police said.
Police said the suspect suggested he had a weapon, though no weapon was drawn, and the suspect escaped with an undetermined amount of cash.
Greenwich PD responded to a report of a robbery at People's Bank at Greenwich &amp; Railroad avenues about 4:40 p.m. today.

The worker, who would not give his name, said the suicide took place in victim's bedroom on the second floor of the family's home.
An Aftermath Services worker who was sterilizing the crime scene told the woman it was true.
The woman said her son learned of Bart's death on social media Monday. She said she didn't believe it, so she came to the house.
"He was my son's best friend," said a woman who visited the Palosz family's home. "He was just at my house for a sleepover this week."
Police said he died of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. The gun was family-owned and stored in a gun locker inside the home, police said.
The GHS student who took his own life after the first day if school has been identified as 15-year-old Bart Palosz, police said.
Greenwich Police said they are investigating am incident but would not elaborate nor confirm the GHS student's death.
Tesei: "I know the schools have invoked their crisis intervention team 2 provide support 2 students who were acquainted with this young man"
Tesei said the student was a sophomore &amp; people who knew him have said bullying might have played a role in his decision to take his life.
"It's just a really horrific tragedy and I'm deeply saddened to hear of it," Tesei said. "I extend my condolences to the family."
