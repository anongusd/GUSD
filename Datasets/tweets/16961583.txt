@twitdom1 @Target Haha! So true. The three month mark is magical 🙏
@SouthwestAir Don’t worry- I had a waterproof changing pad down 😜 Meant to bring the cute @SouthwestAir bunny you guys sent to take a photo on her first flight and totally forgot! Next time 😊
I refused to go on a babymoon because the idea of being at the beach pregnant sounded dreadful to me. As a result, this is the longest I’ve gone between beach vacays. SO happy to be back 😎 #ftlauderdale #ftlauderdalebeach #beach #vacation #southflorida #momlife @BOceanResort https://t.co/a4vqF3L271

Impromptu Mother’s Day photo shoot 😊 #ArabellaB #BabyBrooks #Chicago @jarmbro https://t.co/gckdqtR1QG
Shortly before these Mother’s Day photos were taken, I had a chat with Arabella similar to one Daddy Don had with me almost 34 years ago to the day. It went something like this: “This is a test. If you behave, you’re going to get to go to a lot of nice places.” @smithwollensky https://t.co/rvzxkP8Oot
Her first Mother’s Day as a GRANDMA!! Happy Mother’s Day Mama Joan 😘 #ArabellaB #BabyBrooks https://t.co/S7HHafT17W
Arabella is in awe of this beautiful blanket that arrived in the mail... BUT she doesn’t know who to thank for it. If it’s you, please reveal yourself 😊💕🌸 https://t.co/LuA88eXTji

Hey guys.. checking in before the @nbcchicago 10p news. New info in the Facebook hate crime that has sparked outrage across the country... https://t.co/7kzIWSSm20
@karentexan @the_michelle So true- a reminder that evil does exist.
@CompeteJess @nbcchicago @NBCNightlyNews Very thoughtful of you.
@seed30_Greek @august_west34 @nbcchicago I'm not sure what that means?
@august_west34 @seed30_Greek @nbcchicago Very likely true.
@august_west34 @seed30_Greek @nbcchicago Agreed
@JonDelano Very true JD! Hope you are well.
@KimberleeHicks3 Tune in tonight at 10 for the latest. @NatalieMNBC and I have team coverage
@VerucaAssault_ @Chicago_Police Good point.
@seed30_Greek @august_west34 @nbcchicago Google Jennifer Daugherty. She's a mentally challenged girl who was killed a few years ago in a similar kidnapping/torture scenario
@VerucaAssault_ @Chicago_Police Probably not the best word choice- but they were still gathering info last night. Did you see the CPD news conference today?
@seed30_Greek @august_west34 @nbcchicago Charges they filed today are acceptable though, yes?
@CompeteJess @nbcchicago @NBCNightlyNews There is a link to the Go Fund Me page for the victim on our website- https://t.co/aImdYKuFIk
@JL02048628 @ConcrndFthrPrep @BudaVision32 @seed30_Greek @KimberleeHicks3 @Chicago_Police Yep- they charged the suspects with hate crime today. Investigations take time
@CcDoubleU The consequences will be serious, no doubt
@ndonnelly01 Another great idea!
@ndonnelly01 Great idea. Unfortunately, I don't have any contact info. There is a link to the Go Fund Me page on our website at https://t.co/aImdYKuFIk
@VerucaAssault_ @ConcrndFthrPrep @BudaVision32 @seed30_Greek @KimberleeHicks3 @Chicago_Police Does that make it right? Better to trust the justice system and rally around the victim and his family.
@seed30_Greek @SPOOF_Tweet1 @nbcchicago Very good point. The language used last night definitely played down the horror this young man endured
@seed30_Greek @august_west34 @nbcchicago Police threw the book at them today- very serious charges
@seed30_Greek @LiteweightLemon @nbcchicago Update- they have now been charged with a hate crime
@chill2_bruh @ConcrndFthrPrep @BudaVision32 @seed30_Greek @KimberleeHicks3 @Chicago_Police How so?

@SPOOF_Tweet1 @nbcchicago The question is- how do we fix it?
@LiteweightLemon @nbcchicago I think they were downplaying the language-- not the crime. It's a sad situation all around. Thanks for weighing in!
@august_west34 @nbcchicago Thanks for weighing in Suzy! I agree, but we need to let the police do their job before jumping to conclusions
@the_michelle Yeah, it's a developing situation. Police are likely being cautious with words while they sort it out
@TheDragon74 They have a tough job

About to enter our 24th hour of travel home from Panama thanks to careless @united airlines https://t.co/LV18s81ldH
@united I do. I don't have her name because she hung up on me. Just DM'ed you the confirmation numbers. Possible to identify her that way?
@united no. We are booked for a flight in the AM. But the way a "supervisor" treated us today was inexcusable. Needs to be shared.
@united yep. My husband and I will also be filing a formal complaint against the supervisor who handled our reservation.
Stuck in Houston for the night because of an incompetent @united supervisor who somehow cancelled our reservation while issuing our tickets
Flying @united makes me never want to fly again.
