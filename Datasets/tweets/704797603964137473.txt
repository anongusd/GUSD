50% of everyone crossing that US border is carrying smuggling in some way.	Its coming in every way across that border, even getting flown to Canada and in. Our planes, boat trips.. In 2000, they used to "count" everyone apprehended, all sent back as criminal/crimes.
The future is so screwed up for most of us if we don't have the 20-30m illegals leave soon. If can stop constant leftists willing to undermine/harm us. Or the whole world along with us will be so much worse off.	So important to stop all the progressive messed up ways globally.
If we build wall/fencing that the experts say we need for securing it. So we can stop the masses of illegals, trafficking, criminals and false refuges from coming here. We still have legislators, MSM, judges, etc being seditious/ inserection to harm us in various ways... https://t.co/GPfp61zMiL

30+ million people that must be deported and those seditious/treasonous, not following constitution, giving sanctuary, undermining law and enforcement is beyond a crisis. Any more being added to that is a real crisis, catastrophe. Harmful to every American and their futures.
@realDonaldTrump #BuildTheWall 	What happens near our terrestrial border when you have these two very likely future scenarios as we had to do with military in history. It is the US military manning our border. We just added a civil layer on top of that. https://t.co/g5rg0mKWTU

Yep, we hate illegality, we hate crime, we hate sin, we hate harm things, we hate that which is inflicting and harming our society.		They try to turn it into something greater then that because it's there's problem and preoccupation, or your restricting them from being harmful.
Can you imagine if the court requires you to do things against your religion, against your first amendment moral views, of degrading or inhumane things to your body, mind, upbringing. Like get a abortion poor person. Or to eat pork.
