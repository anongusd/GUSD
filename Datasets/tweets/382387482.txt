@MarkDice Cleary a connection between big tech and CNN. Have the old white hair board members and shareholders lost control buy diversifying their company culture? I think so.Yet, revenue is all that matters in the Hamptons.
We cannot deny the fact that this world is a better more prosperous place because of Trump. He has created job security for thousands both directly and indirectly within the government and within big tech. He has created action in stagnation and energy in a dull society.
This country is built on business and business is booming. Booming because Trump is a master of business. He has generated wealth for all races and all political parties. He is the topic of conversation everywhere. That is masterful work. Credit and respect due. And thanks.
The move by Nike was target marketing. Keep in mind, shareholders and board members strategize to maximize profits. Nike simply used the popular political awareness of consumers to market its product and solidify its loyalist consumer base.

We can complain all day about censorship. Or, we can do something about it. Who has this road map, many on here I follow with much greater reach and knowledge of steps to take to make serious change in ridding censorship. Who has the master plan?
@RealMattCouch This all leading to one dead end road. A point of regulation that we have not yet received. That being a totally free and unsuppressed platform to exercise our freedom of speech and make known the information and will to destroy our freedom and create a socialist world.
