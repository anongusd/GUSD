@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 because my evidence is valid and truthful then discount me as biased You all could have saved babies
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 stinking parking lot underground always floods and takes few days to be safe.. You don't want truth
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 how many hungry babies have you fed in Hurricane Harvey? Put up or shut up. Dare:100  baby food packs
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 lying about one of the meekest, kindest, gentlest pastors I have documented, it's wrong and anti-Christ
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 This is a pastor who never put down My Hindu Brothers and Sisters, who prays and aids Muslims
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 And when EVERYTHING was taken for my faith in #JesusChrist the doors of #Lakewoodchurch were open 24hrs
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 this #meek #Pastor #JoelOsteen carries the highest vibration of the #Holy #Spirit of #Jesus #Christ
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 documenting miracles from the Holy Spirit across faith traditions
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 A quarter of a million cost for the right to raise my children as Christian, adoptees of denominations
@bluelighttv @Ronnie8008 @JimDiGriz2 I'm a Hindu scientist and doctor who had miracles from Jesus at my house, who lost everything for Jesus
@JimDiGriz2 I challenge Jim DiGriz to hand deliver 100 large packages of #baby #food to #Lakewoodchurch to show #action to #help #babies
@Ronnie8008 @bluelighttv @JimDiGriz2 the millions of lives saved, miracle healings, people with the joy of the living God living happy lives... say "projection"
@JPM_80 @JimDiGriz2 #liar #Lakewoodchurch doors always open live security. Parking garage always floods and is safety issue to dry out first. church stays open
@JPM_80 @JimDiGriz2 I caught you lying. On both counts. You have nerve to lie so boldly. The disrespectful Jesus photo exposes you too.#liar
