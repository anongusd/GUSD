@THEbitchiestgay OH MAN.  That made me so sad when I saw the movie.
@_AndrewFriedman Some shows and musicals are not as fully grounded in the period of time that they were written and produced in as Rent is.
For the record - Love the original cast. Love the songs. Didn't love how, in the movie,  sung dialogue became spoken dialogue or the lack of creativity w/ camera angles. Also, the magical realism that can be achieved w/ movies, that cannot be done with stage, was neglected. #rent https://t.co/B1cas9pFRx

So, today's episode of our reality show presidency ends on a "to be continued."  And by that i mean the government shutdown continues.

@sahilkapur I agree.  But once they decide to prosecute, their hands are tied when it comes to the kid situation.  All I'm saying is the focus should be on that decision to utilize the criminal system instead of the civil one which allows for more flexibility.
@sahilkapur But by deciding to criminally prosecute and throw adults in jail, that triggers the need to separate the kids.
Pls ask @DHSgov Secretary what exactly she would have Congress do?  Like what would her version of an immigration bill say?  Because I don't know how Congress changing the law would stop the administration from charging people with a crime of illegal entry into the US.
So the question is -- are the Trump administration's moves when it comes to undocumented immigrants actually a deterrent or are things so bad in some of these countries, that people will risk it anyway?

POTUS: ‚ÄúWe call on every nation including China &amp; Russia to fully implement UN Security Council resolutions‚Ä¶And sever all ties of trade &amp; technology.‚Äù (I talked to an expert who warned that cutting off Chinese oil to NK may cause them to sell their nuke tech to other countries.)

Which two of these three do I play today: TY Hilton, Martellus Bennett, James White?
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday Especially the idea of block grants.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday Well, there was a lot of time spent on the writing of the ACA and frankly, the ideas in this bill have been out there for a while too.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday Which, in theory, could bring insurance prices down for some. But make insurance out of reach for others.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday The bill doesn't repeal the pre-existing conditions guarantee in the ACA, but it creates room for states to figure out a way around it.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday It is to a certain extent, but it's a shared pain. You can't charge a 27-year old with asthma more than a 27-year-old who doesn't have it.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday for those with pre-existing conditions, that they are priced out of the market.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday So, the bill doesn't repeal the pre-existing condition guarantee, but it does allow the possibility of insurance being so expensive...
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday The bill says a state has to show how they would guarantee "affordable" &amp; "adequate" cvg for everyone. But no definition of what that is.
@Kelly2Teresa @FoxNewsSunday He said it cuz the bill gives states the flexibility to allow insurance companies to charge more for ppl w/ pre-existing conditions...
WH Director of Leg Affairs Marc Short on @FoxNewsSunday: The bill guarantees pre-existing conditions. 	Chris Wallace: No it doesn't.

OK. The written testimony needed to be pre-reading for ALL of the senators.  #ComeyTestimony

That answer came at 103624 folks. Those who need timecode, need that timecode. #ComeyTestimony

Might as well just flash Whitewater on the screen now.  "When you start turning over a rock..." #ComeyTestimony
Clears up one of my q's.  Comey believes POTUS was talking specifically about Flynn investigation, not Russia investigation as a whole.
