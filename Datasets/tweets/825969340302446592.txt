@WadyPhoto @realDonaldTrump Everything üçÑrump does makes me cringe. This is no exception. On the plus side, it looks like he's gained another 50 lbs, so in relation, his hands look even smaller.
@RWPUSA If üçÑrump were smart? Hahahahaha!	I realize getting his fat ass out of office would be easier if your scenario played out but I do relish the thought of him going to prison.
@realDonaldTrump Watched Draft Dodging Dump on twitter spewing lies almost as inaccurate as his bone spurs used to cower from Vietnam üçÑ
@Reinalyn407 I occasionally say "copy" in reply to a request at my civilian workplace. And I'm always 15 minutes early to every appointment.
@andylassner I still won't use his name. I prefer dump, orangutan, clown, dotard, perv, idiot, trash, liar, sociopath, moron, dementia-baby, butthole lips, coward, draft dodger, criminal, cheater, &amp; racist grandpa.
@amvetsupport Seeing this also offended the hell out of me too. Every time that this bloated orange draft dodging COWARD is saluted by military members makes my stomach turn.
@RepMaxineWaters You tell them, congresswoman!
@realDonaldTrump VAGINA NECK!!!  ENEMY TO ALL OF OUR EYES!!! https://t.co/BBJwowh3kt
@amvetsupport For a sociopath, he's not a very good actor. His expression when he dumped his coat to the military escort was the fake "I'm not intimidated" look that he arranges his butthole of a face whenever he's around actual leaders, domestic &amp; foreign.
@PhilipRucker He can't read.
@bubbagump324 Piece of shit is right. The military escort isn't a coat check valet. I usually can't stand looking at his fat ugly face but made myself today, to reaffirm his inability to look even remotely human.
