However, Mr. Shariatmadari is a crazy Republican and hope he is not your leader.I can't judge Pahlavi's knowledge and anti_regime activities but I think he is not a bad man.dude,do you care about our territorial integrity?
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 I agree. We should not make dictators. I think he is allied with other oppositions except Rajavi. I don't want to defend him. I understand your concern and worries as I am.
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 Also, if Pahlavi really do whatever he is saying today can be a good alternative for launching a democratic system in Iran. For me or territorial integrity and reality of our goals and true constitution are the most important issues.
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 In addition, a true council after changing the regime is a bit unrealistic idea at that disorganised situation. We should stop dreaming and be realistic. The members of that counsel could be allied and make another I. R. Just true constitution could save us.
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 I don't want to fight with you or accuse you. Please don't be aggressive. Now I know your idea about after changing regime and it's admirable. Don't focus on demolishing Pahlavi cause he can help us and is popular.
@makeyourselfno1 @eagle_eye92 I admire you. We need alliance and Republicans truly want freedom and brighter future of Iran. We should preserve our territorial integrity. I don't care about the system. Constitution is the most important issue. A true constitution will save us.
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 Iran is the nation of all people and I don't think Pahlavi ideas are the same of him. Anyway, what system do you prefer after changing the regime? Tell me do you care about our territorial integrity or not?
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 A true, comprehensive, democratic and Liberal constitution.
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 Thanks for your insulting! I'm not a fan of Pahlavi. Just asked to know your creed. No, you could be democracy supporter. I told you in my opinion maybe it would  be better to have a separated position to preserve our territorial integrity. Surly the most important issue is
@eagle_eye92 @makeyourselfno1 Are you a mujahed?! Tell us please about your political beliefs. I'm not a pahlavi fan but I think for Iran after changing regime it could be good to have a separated position which can preserve our territorial integrity. And a wise and professional politician could be good.

@Mirasbifarhangi Especially believers or religious people!
For buying a simple smartphone a simple worker in Iran have to work for 7 years and spend nothing! I'm not speaking about new Iphone wich is even hard to think!
@illusigram With a red right hand ;)
@Munchen1828 Wish all Iranian someday in futuree acquire knowledge of being atheist.
@AlBawabaEnglish Almost all Iranian hate her! look at this!  She has hijab!!! It's funny.
@Mirasbifarhangi It isn't proved yet. I think they are our cousins and we had common ancestors but never sex together. This theory is more Accepted.
Such a good government and amazing news https://t.co/ZxZOIeA3Gw
@Tyler_3xT Due to this religion and lack of knowledge our mind and society are corrupted and we can't distinguish what is true and what is false.
RT @saamrradrrad: یک دقیقه به این عکس نیگاه  و فکر کنید 		یک هفته با این جمعیت کف خیابون میشه به همه بدبختیها پایان داد #IraniansWantRegime…
@L_khov But your knowledge is a thousand times wider than mine.
@mrfariborzg1 @L_khov I consider finglish as a disrespect to the Persian language bro.
@L_khov My keyboard has Persian and you didn't understand my mean bro. I agree with you. Wish a good day for my old country. We deserve more... 	#IraniansWantRegimeChange
@L_khov They don't want to risk and issue a statement which if people do not obey is bad for their self-validation but it's wrong in my opinion.
@Azarirani1918 Take her to the doctor. Thank you for your kindness. Wish the best and health to you and your likeable mom
@ir_humanrights Unfortunately, no one cares about this little boy. Most of the religious people are stupid. They want happiness just for their own family and it's such a shame. We should love each other and it should be important for us how other people are living. Fuck regime as a real victim
@SecPompeo @StateDept We are suffering from our fucking regime 	#IranRegimeChange
@iranfarashgard Beautiful sentences will not make our country a good one.
@PEDIiISH Meet a psychologist as soon as possible. Or read books about being positive to understand how precious life and moment is. I was like you but I read books and it helped me a lot. And tell him how much you love him.
@pandapingpongba Iceland or Norway
@PesarNoah 23, atheist.
@Kayvan_Hosseini BBC is supporting regime why and how you think they are free medias?! I think people are important which know who is right and I'm one of people. You work for money and these words are for money too.
@rezahn56 You have a lack of knowledge. Just I beg you think a second if one of these illnesses were your mother. Then what you say about him? Please do not defend him. Doctors earn unfairly in compare with other jobs. For this reason some of them became rude.
@FIFAcom It makes me happy when I see a woman can be so successful like her. On the other hand, it makes me sad because in Iran a woman even cannot go to the stadium and watch a match. They have millions of limitations in their lives. 	#IraniansWantRegimeChange
@PEDIiISH Fuck him
@BBCBreaking Tell us about Iran ... 80 million hostages. 	#IraniansWantRegimeChange
@Shazzy2016 @SecPompeo @usembassyjkt We had the biggest empire in the world. We are suffering since Omar's attack on Iran. We weren't Muslim. We are proud of Cyrus the great who respected other religion when he was the king and had the power. We love all the countries and there are no religious differences.
@SecPompeo @usembassyjkt Iranian people are hostages and need worlds help. Thank you for listening to our voice. Iranian people want peace for all countries even Israel. Thanks for your support. We are proud of our history and we will back to the past. 	#IraniansWantRegimeChange
@SecPompeo @nikkihaley @USUN @POTUS We love you, man. Tell us about Iran more. You are the voice of 80 million people. Just I hope these concerns are pure without any lies or deceiving. We stick in this fucking situation and need your help to support us. Hope a peaceful world. 	#IraniansWantRegimeChange
@PanahGodneshin Fuck of guys. Each one of us is a universe and should not be ignored. They need medicines and he should be responsible because of his position in government.
@santiaaagoooo I unfollow you because of lack of knowledge and understanding our horrible problems.
@Mirasbifarhangi Wow great. Please also inform people about Nushijaan hill which is located between Hemdan and Malayer cities.
@SecPompeo @LittlePrAncess Thank you for your support. We never forget it. I hope your pure support will continue after changing regime to set up a good government.
@LuciferManDana @afiralmomenin It possible if people realize that love, humanity and peace are more important than their illusions or religion. We should respect each other and in today's situation, it's almost impossible.
@toos_tahmasebi @afiralmomenin Fuck
@Existentialer As a Bitaar 😁 cool
@alain_berset @Rouhani_ir #IraniansWantRegimeChange
@thevocaleurope Iranian people won't forget your fucking dirty policy against them just for fuel. Fuck you.

@realDonaldTrump I really admire you but these words show you are not trustworthy like all politics. Iranian people want to change the regime. We are 80 million hostages. Do not deal with them please. #IraniansWantRegimeChange

Such a terrible #earthquake. For a second we woke up and all the #people went to the alley. There was a moment of extreme #panic. How can I sleep now?! It's 02:34 AM. Waiting for the next probable ones.

I really liked the sympathy and responsibility of the #USA government for the #florencehurricane. Together people and a true government can defeat every hardship. You are the best Mr #Trump.
You can't imagine but in #Iran, all of these activities are banned. Our great #historical country's people today, doesn't have the least right of #FreedomOfSpeech. Even #women don't have the #right to choose what they wear! #Australia should try to not be like our #Government. https://t.co/wkABz85Qqq
@euronews_pe The police arrested people who are worried about the #environment! I think the police believes they should not care about it. How funny it is! It's not weird in #Iran but why in #Germany! #Earth is for all of us.
