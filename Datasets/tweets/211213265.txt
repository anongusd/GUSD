Final House Judiciary vote on HB1291 as amended to Prohibit Chokeholds: 11-0 unanimous!  On to the House floor.

The Colorado State Patrol witness states that HB1288 is concerning bc it would "change the way we do business."  Uh, yup. That's the point.
@HouseSalazar asks Morgan Co. Sheriff exactly how he determines "illegal alien" status, since he used that term in his testimony.
