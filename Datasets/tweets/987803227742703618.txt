@guardian Socialism should mean self-determination and freedom of self-expression. Saying that France has a secular society is like saying the US has a colorblind society. In ether case (and recent elections prove this) both of those false narratives have only normalized white supremacy.
@guardian And normalizing the dominant ideology within a society rather than aligning yourself with the marginalized’s struggle for cultural self-determination within your borders is what “defiles” the struggles for the working class in France, to allude to so-called socialist Julien Dray.
@guardian Any argument for secularism must relate to the state, rather than society and the public realm at large, lest it normalizes the dominant, oppressor culture and marginalizes the disenfranchised. This in turn fuels the bigotry behind white supremacists like Marine le Pen.
@guardian Regardless of her motivation/s, it is not the place for citizens of a country with a legacy of colonialism and imperialism in the Muslim world to again assault the right of a Muslim to their own self-determination. This time on an individual level regarding bodily autonomy.
@guardian I think that if anyone was actually a feminist they would recognize that it is up to women to decide how to portray themselves. Her use of a hijab may well serve as a symbol of empowerment for her!
The answer to the problems of the working poor is solidarity in the struggle against the billionaire class. Trying to survive off of their bread crumbs has ruined our country, forced our families to struggle to survive, and made our futures uncertain at best.
We are realizing how simple the solutions are to our economic suffering as we watch the wealthy (who are rich because so many of us are poor) trick the poor community of our country—and state—into believing that the answer to their struggles is white supremacy. It is not!!!
We have been raised in an economy built on worker insecurity. Many of us have watched our families struggle to survive for our entire lives. Now we are trying to go to colleges that we struggle to afford in order to have a hope of some sort of future better than our upbringing.
What the hell is happening to our country? This is the question that US millennials are coming of age asking themselves. #StudentsforaNewIdaho is a collective of students who already have a good idea of what’s happening to the US and who want to change it.

@business @BV Hard to have a substantive election when the two main political leaders have been prevented from running due to a corrupt legislature. Want to write an article about that instead of attacking pro democracy protesters as “shouting factions”? https://t.co/voQBpAs0pv
@business @BV How has “tame the bureaucracy, attract investors” ever worked out for everyday Latin Americans? I think Brazil needs more democracy and less imperialism! What universe are you from @bloomberg? Or would your owner be one of those vampiric investors?

@business @BV Don’t forget that the US imperialists and Brazilian elitists have ruined Brazilian democracy to undermine these working class achievements!!! https://t.co/3mX3AWW4fX

@TheEconomist What’s wrong with being a critic of the status quo? Isn’t that something Journalism should be about? @TheEconomist, how much $$$ would you make off covering the next war?
