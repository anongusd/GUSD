@RobertW196 An extreme environment, other states may be present such as Plasma and neutron stars
@RobertW196 Hello my brother I'm waiting
@RobertW196 There are are solid liquid or gas and   can you name the other one my brother
@RobertW196 You are correct, however,  they are divided into three main groups solid liquid and gas
@RobertW196 They are states of mattet divided into three main groups solid liquid and gas
@RobertW196 Give or take got 25 elements but they are divided into three main groups solid liquid and gas
@RobertW196 You don't truly have an understanding of what you are reading, all you have is your plane of evolution and only your understanding of evolution
@RobertW196 There are three elements known to man solid liquid and gas
@RobertW196 God is the creator of biologic genetic mathematic and scientific they don't lied nor can they be misinterpret
@RobertW196 If you've been taught all your life that heaven is in the sky and hell is in the ground that's all you know
@RobertW196 And what have you been using if it's not interpretation
@RobertW196 A person it surely wouldn't have spirit
@RobertW196 According to who
@RobertW196 Yo allegations against me is only your opinion
@RobertW196 Bible scriptures also say that it would put the law of God in their minds and in their hearts and they should be his peoples
@RobertW196 Behold a Pale Horse, the Pale Horse is not a horse and itself it is a peoples
@RobertW196 You see I believe the Devil is a people's and not a spirit
@RobertW196 Once again the one who interpret the Bible to you misinterpret the words
@RobertW196 The one who interpret the Bible to you that's the misinterpretation
@RobertW196 Biological mathematic and scientifically impossible for the whole world to flood up to the highest mountains it's not enough water on earth for that
@RobertW196 I think that's a matter of interpretation
@RobertW196 Could Jesus Christ been speaking of the end in a region at that time and the entire world now
@RobertW196 This not a yes or no response, you see Noah Ark was 300 cubits in length and 50 cubits width (450x75x45 foot) there no way you can put all of the land animals in something that small.
@RobertW196 No
@RobertW196 Jesus Christ never lied brother, the one who was entrusted to interpret the Bible misinterpret the Bible.  That what I believe.
@RobertW196 This sure answer your question https://t.co/nB7jCMJ5pM

@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf No matter where you put pale skin people, they going to look pale
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Egypt have a light skin people today but it wasn't always that way
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Let let me use America for an instant, you take a look of America you would think that it has always been pale skin control but it hasn't and wasn't
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Pale skin is a recessive gene  and can only produce pale skin,
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf White history is right about 6000 years bro.,  give or take
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Light skin but not pale
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf No way
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf There is no  no evidence that say white people was here over 6000 years ago
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Correct
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf You see when you dealing with facts that is proof, what I say is biologic mathmatics genetics and scientific proof
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Yes Black people is the original people of the planet earth and  possesses a dominant and recessive gene
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf Because the Bible has been misinterpreted by man
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf I like to say the original people
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf No that's not it, I used biologic, genetic, scientific facts
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf You have dominant genes and recessive genes and white people's possessed only recessive gene meaning that they came from the dominant genes of people's of color so when the Bible say in the Old Testament let us make men they talking about white people's
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf I believe the Old Testament has been misinterpreted, I also believe that Moses took white people's up into the caucus mountain regions of Europe

@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf You keep throwing a lot of issues into one, and one has nothing to do with the other,
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf First of all the history of the Bible is only 6000 years, so you lost me with the millions of years
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf I don't believe there was actual a fruit, I believe the fruit mention in the Old Testament is speaking of the mind and thought of men/women.  Once again a matter of interpretation
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf I like the GOD likeness in my tweet lol, kmsl, brother don't take it personal.
@RobertW196 @CNN @zbyronwolf 🗣👂You say the Old Testament in the Bible is wrong, for the sake of argument could it be that it's a matter of misinterpretation of the Old Testament, you claim is wrong, you see I believe in biological, mathematics and scientific facts, these three are the laws of GOD.

@HM64444420 @Aidan79619319 @CNN @POTUS Obviously it takes a fool to think a fact is a fool
@MylesBoch @CNN Majority of white America is mad about the condition of the country and this is why they are acting out I'm not saying killing orstealing I'm saying they are not happy with the condition of America right now
@EnterTheNeuron @CNN Wrong answer, people are   peepers are angry and mad black brown white yellow and once you are mad you have a tendency to act out of your emotions that's not race-baiting that's facts

Mr.  President, Paul Manafort received due process and equal protection of the laws under the U. S. Constitution and Federal Statutes, he brought this on himself, it's not Political Motivated or Witch Hunt,  it's self inflicted. https://t.co/M9yBLFKIyl
The 14th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution and Federal Statutes guarantees every U.S. citizen the right to due process and equal protection of the laws, no one is above the law, citizens, executive, judicial, or legislative, all investigation into wrong doings must be done.
According to our 14th amendment, guaranteed a fair and impartial investigation and decision maker, no one is above the law, Federal Statues implementation of FBI and US attorney's Authority. https://t.co/ud8PcOJnMf

🗣Whatever happens to due process and equal protection of the law here in America, Democrats and Republicans and their supporters are at war with each other and the Country is in the middle, emotions clouds your perception to the true reality of what is, 'Country first'.

President Trump has received due process in this investigation, if you asked anyone ever investigated by the FBI, they didn't get the same fair and impartial decision maker as President Trump has received, I think the FBI are fair and impartial, and help keep this Country safe. https://t.co/EsGpCuWwVZ

@realDonaldTrump We have problems here in America that need fixing: jobs, roads, crime, housing, police abuse (a few, not all), prison reform, jobs for re-entry prisoners,  our national debt, health care, so I am with your America first.
@realDonaldTrump American first Mr.  Trump, keep your word and your head up.
@spike9usa9 @PressSec @WhiteHouse @POTUS I judge not anymore, we all are great American black, brown, white, etc.
@HeatherGillard5 @realDonaldTrump Look you don't have to like or love Trump, he is the president of this Country, I'm not of any party affiliation.  I just don't deal in emotions and feelings in this time of trouble.
@ChristophKent @realDonaldTrump You right, when you dealing with emotions and feelings it clouds your perception to the true reality of what is, I support the office of the presidency.

@WILDsgtDOOM @Epilogue_0 @CNN The Bible is a book based on allegorical and  symbolic meanings with past and future meaning.

According to the United States Constitution each branch of government has the authority to overturn or undo something that is unconstitutional.
In America we have three branches of government.	This is where the term checks and balance coming into affect.	The Courts, Executive Branch or Legislators  don't have absolute power.	The founding fathers of America had to be guided by God and making this decision.
First and foremost I'm not blaming anyone, but white people's in America are the one with the power and control.	 White people in America has the money, voting power and voice to bring about change,  thus white peoples are the rulers of this world at this time.	Granted by God.
For surely we all have turned our self from being upright to him who originated the heavens and the Earth.
It's time that we American must preach togetherness instead of self, everything now it's about oneself and not as us as a whole
We Americans must be tolerance, understanding, courteous, humble,  supportive, of our President, for all of us with understanding truly know God will not change the condition of a people until they change them self
@realDonaldTrump @g7 American first,  let reform our re-entry of prisoners to our community policies,  here in Mississippi and America they can't get jobs, Let's help make them and assets to the community instead of a liability
America first per president Trump, let get these former prisoners a job,  and help them becoming access to their Community instead of a liability.
Let talk prison reform for all of the prisoners who been released from prison, and can't find a job here in the great State of Mississippi and America.
