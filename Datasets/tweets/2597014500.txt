@HealthRanger I guess males being in contact with women makes you a woman. Whereas females can come in contact with men and not become them because of course males are not contagious.
@GovMikeHuckabee I'm confused. So there is a difference between boys and girls scouting education and they shouldn't be learning skills outside those boundaries? Or they both learn the same skills but need to be isolated from each other to do it?
@ThePerfectFoods LOL every time women enter a male only space, men freak out and claim the sky is falling. Snowflakes. Ya'll melt as soon anything makes you uncomfortable.
Every time women enter a space previously prohibited, society comes closer to brink of collapse apparently ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ #BoyScouts
What you guys are really saying is that the whole organization is ruined and is worth less because girls are a part of it... Shame on ya'll. #boyscouts #feminismisforeveryone
And all this" #boyscouts are dead" nonsense? I guess my sons camping trips are all ruined and they won't be able to earn their badges because girls are part of the organization... üò≠üò≠üò≠
The only hurtful part of this deal is that so many women as well as men think that somehow little girls are harmful or distracting to boys. SMH #boyscouts
The way I see it #GirlScouts and #BoyScouts are like Nike and Adidas. They have their own history, leadership and branding. Now girls can choose what brand they want to rock...
So from what I understand people feel that boys can not learn to become young men with girls around?üßê Are these the same boys who are confused about #consent as young adults?ü§î #boyscouts

@NiceDeb if they are so concerned with the Voting process...
@NiceDeb how come States that have voter ID laws don't have a concentrated effort to make getting an ID that much easier?
@NiceDeb if there is a fee for ID &amp; ID's r req 2 vote- is that a poll tax? What about time, $$$, transportation &amp; documents 4 an ID?
@NiceDeb @JoeyFnAdams more people taking part in the political process and exciting elections r awesome üòä have a great day
@NiceDeb right on but since then the closure of DMV &amp; polling places in minority areas have been prevalent. As well as hiking ID fees...
@JoeyFnAdams @NiceDeb lol u won't change her mind but other people can see the convo. That's the goal I guess
@NiceDeb @JoeyFnAdams Aww have some compassion. Google the people who introduced bills like this in the last 40 years &amp; their comments...
@NiceDeb @JoeyFnAdams that's why they had to change the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had to be changed to get this going.
@NiceDeb @JoeyFnAdams also these voter suppression tactics r not new. There is a whole history there.
@NiceDeb @JoeyFnAdams I didnt make it up. The writers of these laws said it themselves...

@NiceDeb Do u really believe that hundreds of thousands of the poor, elderly, and students etc... r committing voter fraud?
@NiceDeb so we make laws we KNOW hurts hundreds of thousands of people based on imaginary crimes?
üòí @HillaryClinton u r better than this. Anyone can watch @BernieSanders interview and see that this is a lie.
