Manafort, who is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7, was convicted by a federal jury in August of five counts of false tax returns, one count of failing to declare a foreign bank account, and two counts of bank fraud.
The lawyers argue that Manafort is a first-time offender, that he acknowledges that ‚Äúhe received a fair trial before this court, he accepts the jury‚Äôs verdict, and is truly remorseful for his conduct.‚Äù
In a sentencing memo filed in federal court, Manafort's attorneys said federal guidelines that call for 19.5 to 24 years in prison would result in punishment they argue is ‚Äúdisproportionate‚Äù to their client‚Äôs offenses. The lawyers requested a sentence ‚Äúsubstantially below‚Äù that.

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most illegal drugs imported to the U.S. from Mexico are smuggled through legal ports of entry ‚Äî not through parts of the border that would be covered by a wall. https://t.co/JehNexDhKj
Trump claimed that the wall would be paid for, indirectly, by Mexico thanks to a new trade deal he has renegotiated to replace NAFTA. 		But that deal hasn't been ratified by Congress, and there's no evidence it would pay for costs of a wall. https://t.co/w11MTjmW8d

The men are unlikely to be extradited and face trial in the U.S., but the charges are part of an ongoing strategy by the government to detail alleged cyber-crimes to demonstrate how much information the U.S. has about them, and to curtail more cyber-attacks via deterrence.
The charges detail alleged cyber-attacks that targeted intellectual property, confidential business and technological information and other data at more than 45 companies in at least a dozen U.S. states and within U.S. government agencies.
The men are charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.
The two men, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, are part of a ‚Äúhacking group‚Äù known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, according to the charges, working for a company called Huaying Haitai and in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security.

As a government shutdown looms, President Trump is set to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.		Trump has previously made "deals" with the two Democrats ‚Äî deals that have ultimately failed to materialize. https://t.co/eJfYorEuMs
McConnell said the vote could come as early as this week, but also warned that he was prepared to schedule Senate votes during the week between the Christmas holiday and New Year‚Äôs Day to complete business scheduled for the lame duck session.
It‚Äôs unclear whether the changes pushed by conservatives made to the bipartisan deal the president endorsed last month will cause some Democrats to reconsider backing the legislation.
McConnell, who has been reluctant to hold a vote until supporters proved they had the support to pass it, noted the shift was ‚Äúat the request of the President and following improvements to the legislation that have been secured by several members.‚Äù
NEW: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate will vote on criminal justice reform, a top priority of President Trump‚Äôs, before the end of the year.

Authorities said Flynn cooperated early and was ‚Äúparticularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight‚Äù regarding the special counsel mandate.		His work with the government included 19 interviews with Mueller's team or other DOJ lawyers.
‚ÄúSeveral senior members of the transition team publicly repeated false information conveyed to them by the defendant about communications between him and the Russian ambassador regarding the sanctions,‚Äù the court document says.
Flynn offered ‚Äúfirsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials‚Äù on two matters: a U.N. resolution on Israeli settlements and the Obama administration‚Äôs sanctions on Russia for election interference.
Authorities say some of Flynn‚Äôs help may not have yet borne fruit but they want the judge to sentence him as planned on Dec 18.
Prosecutors say Flynn helped with ‚Äúseveral ongoing investigations‚Äù including a redacted criminal investigation and the probe into whether the Trump campaign had any connection to Russia‚Äôs attack on the 2016 presidential election.
#BREAKING: Donald Trump‚Äôs former national security adviser Michael Flynn provided ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù aid to special counsel Robert Mueller and that merits a judge‚Äôs consideration at Flynn‚Äôs sentencing this month, prosecutors said in court papers late Tuesday.
