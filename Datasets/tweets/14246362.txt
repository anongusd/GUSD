@drunkenmadman I don't believe you have citation that all IVF discards babies
@drunkenmadman I call them babies
@drunkenmadman If you are stating that all IVF kills unborn babies then yes, I'll need you to cite that.

@tynanbryant @drunkenmadman @cameronreilly @HappySinger Guys, thanks for the conversation. Unfortunately my day is starting unlike yours.
@cameronreilly @tynanbryant @HappySinger @drunkenmadman In either case I think it takes more faith to be an atheist than it does a Christian
@cameronreilly @tynanbryant @HappySinger @drunkenmadman Here's the definition of agnostic: http://budurl.com/fajf
@cameronreilly nope, I believe there is one God
@tynanbryant then you are agnostic: http://budurl.com/fajf
@cameronreilly I'm glad at  least one of you was willing to answer yes or no
@drunkenmadman very good. Then you are an atheist and my feeling is that it takes more faith to believe in the non-existence of a god.
@barrysaunders that sounds more like an agnostic. Do you even know what you are?
@barrysaunders that sounds more like an agnostic
@HappySinger @tynanbryant @cameronreilly @drunkenmadman @barrysaunders Come on atheists, do you believe in the existence of a god? yes or no
@barrysaunders Ok, answer this question with a yes or a no. Do you believe in the existence of a god? Yes or No
@tynanbryant happy to be of service to you today and I wish you a great fall day downunder.
@cameronreilly Take it up with Princeton man, I'm just an irrational believer in a risen Savior.
@HappySinger @drunkenmadman @barrysaunders I'll hold to the princeton definition that atheism is the belief that there is no god.
@barrysaunders @cameronreilly @HappySinger  I guess we shall all have to agree to disagree and favor the definition that best suits us.
That belief that there is no god requires faith. Faith that the atheist is right and everyone else is wrong.
Unless one is rewriting the definition of atheism it is defined as belief in no god: http://budurl.com/u2vb
From my perspective it takes a lot of faith to hold to the "absence of faith"
From the atheist's standpoint a person who relies on faith in God is irrational.
@barrysaunders To some people holding to an absence of faith requires faith.
@HappySinger Everyone has faith. The atheist has faith that there is no God. Another has faith that one returns as another living being. etc
@HappySinger Actually, the radical Islamists fly planes into buildings because they doubt where they'll end up otherwise. Doubt rules them.
@Grantanother That was a good article... http://budurl.com/vf4w Paper or Podcast
I wish that when I was viewing a chapter on http://versetogo.com on my iPhone that I could just swipe the screen to goto the next chapter.

@cameyg Thank you so much. Can't tell you how much it meant to know people were praying for us.
@TomPerrault Yes it is. I'm looking forward to it and am glad that ChrisRegal is getting to go to. Should be a great learning exp. for him.
I finally feel like I'm back in the land of the living today. Just need to wrap some things up before I leave on my trip tomorrow morning.
Preparing my lesson for sunday school tomorrow then I can relax... been a busy day of running around.
Heading home to finish recuperating. Thanks to everyone for their well-wishes and prayers.

Back to the office today to finish up some work before I leave for the ocue2009 conference next week. Oldest son still flu free. Thank God

I like the idea @jasonmoffatt came up with to grow followers. http://twittertreasure.com/
Some interesting 2009 predictions for social media. How do you use social media different than you did 2 years ago? http://budurl.com/ntxh
@joecase I would really get into that. I think it would be cool to tweet about key statements as well as see what others thought were good.
@joecase What would you think of people twittering about the sermon while sitting in the pew?
Happy Monday morning everyone. The groundhog saw his shadow so we have only 6 more weeks of winter left.
Enjoyed abeautiful day outside w/kids.
@denyseduhaime What is your favorite free app? Which free app do you use most often and why?
Had a blast tonight at the Church's "Coffee House". Accompanied my wife while she sang the lullaby she wrote.

@Bodhi1 I'm guessing the gitmo residents would be begging not to be sent to that ranch. Hmmm... maybe not such a bad idea after all.
@reland1 Eat bacon as I'm sure we'll continue to have a congress that provides plenty of pork.

@arielwaldman hang in there!
@reland1 hmmmm... but do you think that would be a viable solution for a major political race?
@chrisbrogan I'm with you there buddy. I would much rather someone send me something in an email.
@AJaneChambers That's too bad. Everyone is having to make tough choices.
@pvonwedel I feel sorry for the churches that went into debt to build bigger and are now stuck with lower gift giving.
@reland1 What will you fill that little hole in your heart with if you did that?
@michaelkelley Very cool! I shall be sure to let him know when I see him.
@mexiabill Look forward to getting to know you through tweets. Have a fab weekend!
@SarahRobinson Count me in as a bacon fan
@chunkyrican I wonder if recording yourself might help and then sing along and try to improve.
For this #followfriday on twitter I'd like to recommend @loswhit. Great guy and an some awesome blog insights.
@MissIve professional chops eh... so how does that work? You eat for a living?
@ricksanchezcnn I'm angry that with the economy being so bad the execs thought to give themselves a bonus. I'm glad prez called them out.
@reland1 I have to agree, I think it will matter very little who the repubs stick at the top.
Church leadres, what cuts have you had to make in your ministry as a result of the poor economy?
@jgboghos micro popcorn is awesome. Especially the extra butter stuff. Course your calary intake skyrockets just smelling the bag.

@Jubilee888 Which ministry do you have on oneplace?
@upchurch80 TweetDeck has a great way of allowing you to group people and then displays those grouped tweets in varous columns on the page.
@pkitano Yeah, I tried friendfeed for a very short while but have mostly just let it sit idle. I may pick it back up again in a few months.
@Jubilee888 Hang in there, I know it's been rough.
@1080group Thanks for the suggesting me!

@Mauricio_TN Give him time. Jesus started with 12 dudes most of whom were fishermen. I'm sure the Pope will catch up to Obama.
It is wonderful to be in the office again doing what I love to do... Social Networking. But first... gotta dig out. Happy Tuesday everyone
So glad to be back home again

@NatalieGrant Sadly, once they started offering prayers I started to tune out.
@relth will we truly see the Whitehouse be a leader in the era of responsibility? I'm not so sure...

@apotheos I've adopted the meaning that #d stands for a thumbs up. Conversely #p is a thumbs down.
Some1 asked whats the point of the #d and #p. I think it might be a good way to find positive tweets by doing a tag search for #d. thoughts?
@JoJoTabares Thanks! Can you give me a thumbs up? I'm testing something... this is a thumbs up -&gt; #d

@AmishSteve if Obama didn't want Hillary to run against him the last thing he should do is give her a position with lots of spotlight
@AmishSteve Excuse me while I put on my diaper of truth... who needs depends. Come on Christians lose the stupid Christianese.
"We need to gird up our loins with this truth that there will be... persecution..." I hate Christianese. That statement sounds so stupid.
