@GOP @realDonaldTrump Reigns don’t belong with this idiot and everybody knows it. The last person that should be passing legislation relevant to international relations between a potential communist dictator nuclear power and the US is your beloved authoritarian dictator celebrity in chief.
@Maggiek68350885 @GOP Is that some kind thinly veiled threat? If you can’t make sense out of what was tweeted it’s really your problem, not mine. Their fascist legislation will result in feudalism and give birth to a globalist dictatorship like the boomers planned.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump What he’s shilling is textbook fascism people. He’s labeling social regulation of capitalism that provides safety nets for the working class as socialism when the FOTM is that legislation does nothing to change the fundamental entity of a market economy.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Here’s the thing: the world doesn’t know it. We all know you’re shilling lies to continue deceiving the hidden demographic you’ve coddled with the propaganda for decades who perceive the left to bear the fascist traits that really define the globalist alt-right.
@CPAC @GOP @realDonaldTrump The rest of the world hates him and they hate us for electing him just saying. We all know you’re full of it, just drop it already before you get away with burning the leftists we all know you’ve been mining data on.
@GOP Slashing safety nets for the working class, allocating funds to the wealthy elite &amp; handing reigns to Wall Street crooks are all things your party has done with catastrophic consequences resulting in the “crumbling economy” of 2008 from which we are still recovering.
@GOP George W’s in stone fork overs, his Medicare &amp; the two never Enders resulted in the last recession that Mnuchin got away with his foreclosure exploiting. Fascist policies have done this country no favors, are all a means to legislate fuedalism &amp; give birth to a globalist caste.

It’s true people for every bandwagon shill we keep from hopping on, for every attempt to frame the left that we call out and for every blue vote we get the progressive agenda becomes that much stronger, that much more potent and that much more powerful.
On top of all of that bagging and tagging those that stand against their fascism the MOMENT their feet get planted is their goal, the product of their globalist religious persecutive agenda and the manifestation of their true intentions should we remain apathetic &amp; ignorant. @GOP

Don’t get it twisted people, the end result of their agenda is the legislation of irreversible fuedalism for the working class where only those born into wealth will have certain unalienable rights. The product of decades of bandwagon fascism will be globalist dictatorship. @GOP
It is THE most pathetic bullshit ever shilled by any party in the history of American society. Their full intention is giving birth to a ballers only “fuck the poor” society where generations of disadvatanaged demographics have no choice other than being their guinea pig. @GOP

@Tom11271845 @DineshDSouza @yaf So now you’re blaming high rent on socialized utilities.

@Tom11271845 @DineshDSouza @yaf ROTM is they are gearing up for another plow under.

In a fascist country there’s authoritarian rule where people that oppose dictators are forcibly oppressed which is what Donald’s doing. Unregulated capitalism enables monopolies.

It’s just a testament to the power of propaganda, religious indoctrination and their ability to manifest fear and corruption within any society and human being.
Why is the fact we’re duped into a situation where we have to match blows? Because real, honest actual people not religious heretics share the wealth and nice things. It’s entirely rooted in selfish greed, the reason why we’re dealing with what we are right now.
They’ll ride it out of the clouds and into the sand every time they get reigns forked over. All about the RHRNIG. While it’s true if we want something nice like humanity having a future that we have to play dirty now, this wasn’t the case to begin with. They’re the culprits.
It started with the 2 never Enders, the vice whoring it out and ended with the foreclosure crisis people: they’re the ones who started playing dirty. They rationalize it by saying “...oh, if you want something nice like humanity having a future you better match blows.” Bullshit.
That’s the reason why ousting is the move to make people: if we don’t get rid of the fascist seats they will only ever go for more plow-unders and screw anyone that stands against their agenda any way they can. All to a means to the most pathetic &amp; spineless coddled end.
They say ignorance is bliss when it really ain’t. The midterm turn out after the first plow under was only 40%; the milennial death wheel they’ll go right back to unveiling in 3 weeks has been cranking for a long ass time &amp; they don’t have any interest in dropping it.

Corporations are people too even when they really ain’t Brahs.
And that ladies and gentlemen is the threat that corporate America &amp; unregulated capitalism poses to the working class when they let the bandwagoners infiltrate and pull every ladder they can behind them to hang libs up to dry and camp that swamp.
Reasonable suspicions and anonymous information suggests the possibility and likelihood they had it out to kill the guy. If anybody was gonna be held accountable it should have been them.
Then you fall back on the “you wanna act and talk that way there’s gonna be consequences” bullshit. Dude puts the cons to shame up front, dead and center and behind scenes too. They had it out to plow the guy under only God knows what they were really planning.
What else would you expect besides cunning after the dude gets blindsided by the mafia and spends two weeks of his holidays including Xmas day in the ward? Sleight was guaranteed but they back up the fascist wagon. It’s both typical &amp; predictable there’s nothing special about it.
Say I’m the bad guy it was really the bandwagon swine just sayin’. Either way they’ll go down in history as the scum they really are.
FOTM is the people playing goody two shoes up front, dead &amp; center couldn’t be shoveling a deal behind scenes that was any more pathetic and they got away with it. Just another brick in the wall of the middle class they’re exploiting to build the sweatshop wall 10 feet tall.
Dude got set up like a bowling pin by a bunch of bandwagoners that had it out to nail him. In the grand scheme he is walking away with nothing &amp; without something he fought tooth and nail for. All of it contributes to the status quo and completely screwing over the middle man.
How would you react to being drilled by the mafia and supposed “partners” getting away with seeing you fail? These dbags completely got away with what they pulled and dude’s walking away empty handed. He didn’t do anything wrong; you balance landfills on moral fiber it’ll fail.

@seanhannity Dude doesn’t deserve the luxury of secret service after all he’s done to destroy this country. She has all the right to stick it to this dbag and you assholes as hard as TF she can. There’s nothing okay about the Conservative agenda.
Were being fucking conned people the deep state rigged everything behind scenes they could. It’s even in the water we drink &amp; the food we eat. They’ll do anything to keep you from prying open your third eye and make you realize.
Calling out every attempt to frame the left, keeping em from hopping on and drilling these idiots with the cold hard facts is our only chance. Problem is they refuse to acknowledge logic and reason. The people behind this will do anything to keep your third eye from prying.
FOTM is if we don’t reverse that death wheel, get it cranking in the other direction and take them down to pound they’ll get away with burning the left the same they did the Jews in Germany.
Being American meant you embraced and celebrated diversity and strived to be open minded regarding difference in belief, both spiritually and politically. This whole “burn the Dems” agenda is gonna be the death of us swear on my life.
Either the boomers bought it cuz they were THAT gullible or they whored out knowing what they were really up to. Those who did sell out pulled every ladder across the board they could to pocket the wealth and fork it over to their pathetic coddled heirs. Read: unAmerican.
There’s a reason why people speak so lowly regarding the baby boomers. Those dbags got their fancy pieces on pennies, turned around and screwed everyone. The exact same crooks behind WW2 flew right over and peddled the exact same fascism under the trickle down guise.
@JacobAWohl Those are all mouthbreathing idiots dummies. You would have to be beyond dumb to want to be under the command of this scumbag. Amateur hour is over pal you’re nothing more than a Nazi shill in denial.
Don’t get it twisted; their full intention is keeping them down and sending them to pound if they won’t take the bullet for the war those assholes planned on throwing us into half a century ago. If we don’t opt into being their guinea pig we’re forced to be sitting ducks.
The saturated job market, the inflated housing and absurd tuition are all intended to erase social mobility, rob the middle class economy &amp; fork it over to the already wealthy. AKA the people who are 99% of the time born into inherited wealth.
Ever since Don got in they’ve been gearing up for lights out people. The in stone fork overs &amp; the gargantuan military spending are all a means to sink the economy, pit the country against the wall &amp; hound every leftist they can across the board. @GOP @SenateGOP
The reality of the matter is they hatched the plan half a century ago &amp; rigged every social infrastructure they could against the milennials to take them down to pound. Ever since the plow under they’ve mounted technology to sink cons on the entire generation. @GOP

Making mistakes is part of being a human being.
The real issue that needs to be addressed is what really happened behind the scenes &amp; the discriminatory acts they were intentionally carrying out to hang the dude out to dry: he did nothing wrong to merit the behavior that was cruel and undeserving.
The dirt they’re aiming to use to hang Brah up to dry is irrelevant. They were trying to take him down. Sure some of those dirty little secrets are out of line but 99.999% of the time dudes towing those lines straight, clean AF, hard knock schooling the newbs &amp; pwning the rubes.

The real issue that needs to be addressed is the right winged state media. Their dictatorship of what is and isn’t PC narrative and the leftist framing creates the commodity of their agenda that they are aiming to exploit as a means to hang leftists out to dry. @SenateGOP @GOP
@SteveDaines @SenateGOP They’re being exploited during the Republican filibustering of the fed you know. You need to quit conning the country and playing victim to “liberal obstructionism” of the fed; there’s nothing PC about it.
@GOP @GOPLeader This leftist framing is gonna be final nail in the coffin of your party. There is no more being civil with you; Mitch filibustered the bill that was forked over to the Senate. You’ll never drop it and it’s childish.
@GOP Let’s be serious: there’s nothing PC about the constant leftist framing. You are peddling absolute scum onto your own country and playing victim to the byproduct &amp; being outsmarted. That’s the nail in the amateur coffin right there.
If they were really trying to con my shtick burying it in a means that only I could dig it out might be what it takes to smack these dbags TF down across the board. You gotta own those hang ups and wear them like armor. Dudes only saving the world &amp; smacking down con armies. 🤗🤗

The wall will do nothing to mitigate the immigrant crisis because the vast majority of illegals fly right over &amp; overstay their visas. The shutdown &amp; the wall is intended to plow us all.
@SenBillCassidy @SenateGOP Irrelevant. The wall will do nothing to resolve the immigration crisis because all they ever do is fly right over and stay put. The real issues that need to be mitigated are the rigged electoral college and the Republican filibustering of the fed.

If it’s not suing a porn star after bribing her or refusing to show tax returns after whoring the country out to dictators then what is PC these days. The only thing the right gives a fuck about is blindsiding liberals that don’t stand a chance and that is it. @realDonaldTrump
The reality of the matter is this: Don is a con artist. He spent his entire career scamming global society &amp; robbing it blind. He is not a civilized candidate nor is he qualified to have the global reigns and be in charge of the world’s only democratic superpower.
@Malangas The criminals affiliated are a by product of the imperialists the Republican Party has been whoring our country out to ever since Raegan &amp; trickle down. It’s all a byproduct of Globalist fascism.
The people aiming to con the milennials belong nowhere near the reigns of the American justice system. Don peddles that he’s draining the swamp: the American people need to wake up and realize the cesspool that needs to be tapped is the Republican Party and the lies they shill.

Nah brah. We’ll turn blind eyes, fall deaf ears and let the Nazi shills infiltrate the largest global entertainment conglomerate there is so they can spin the most fucked up globalist propaganda death wheel known to man &amp; patent technology into the 14th century dark ages. @Sony
Conversation dude had with the cartels Kemp’s in cahoots with was placing the million dollar bid, chopping me up and “feliz navidad” done deal. If you truly gave a fuck about your own country the story would’ve been out the same day. @MSNBC @BrianKempGA @GOP
You idiots need to publicize this fucking story.
@MSNBC
We need impeachment and we need it now. For every day those fascist seats refuse to pry fingers off of their thrones, our society will forever remain this fucked up and scary. @realDonaldTrump
But it fell on deaf ears because of the big green money fascist machine propaganda death wheel that will never stop spinning and allows them to do whatever the fuck they want behind the scenes. @realDonaldTrump
He came fully equipped with pizza boxes, an inflatable mattress and everything he needed to chop me up into tiny little pieces, flush the evidence down the drain and burn the whole thing down. @realDonaldTrump
Come on Don. Two can play fair at this game. Just a little push by now would be great. @realDonaldTrump 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
@realDonaldTrump It truly is pathetic how you assholes will never stop framing the left. He planted a con on me with the help of the GOP people.  When the smackdown got laid on the wagon rolling through he melted up a propaganda storm. Bagging em and tagging em is their true intention.

It’s say it’s beyond end game high and dark templar stashes at this point. The battle has been won but now the real pound for pound war has begun. If we don’t nip these dbags they’ll get away with what they’re trying to pull.
@Tdubaz @DineshDSouza Grow a brain pal: Conservatism is entirely responsible for the hole the countries in. The George W 2 never Enders and the Wall Street in stone fork overs set the stage for the foreclosure crisis then the 6 years of filibuster all in a means to stage their coup.
@realDonaldTrump Real crook that needs to be ousted is you Don. Absolute scum the right wing is peddling onto the country these days. You keep shilling the prop and see where it gets you.
Good news fam. I just found scumbag grifter kingpin numero uno. @DineshDSouza
@DineshDSouza @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Typical leftist frame. You assholes stand for nothing and absolute refuse to compromise for the sake of your own country. It’s all a means for you scumbags to pocket all the wealth. You got no room to be waving fingers, you must be high or something.

I mean they almost got away with what they were trying to pull. That’s the real issue that needs to be addressed here, not the inevitable sleight, liberal cunning and hang ups. Those were all intended to ride his slate and snake his deal.
The reality of the matter is this: Brah shoving righteous rented out max dome space of a clique of bandwagoners and they decided to play dirty. It’s cool we can play pound for pound and Brah’s got the refs on his side regardless of the dirt you have on him. Dudes innocent AF.

One more time: hanging good guy out to dry is all a means for the real crooks pulling strings to pocket all the wealth.
Patriotic citizens need to be recognized for their worth. What the bandwagoners are manifesting and what their true intention is gonna bring is not okay and is gonna suck BIGTIME. If we don’t empower the downtrodden and quit pawning the flame off on them, we all lose in the end.
Those goddam nasa nerf molehills. Swear on my life. These days people are shilling for a day where the 0.0001% dotted t &amp; crossed i hang ups are all they need to ride your slate &amp; turning blind eyes to the other 99.9999% landfills of righteous shoved by the real team players.
Part of bringing an end to suffering and all the wrong things in life is bringing the darkest and most betrothed secrets and metaphorical skeletons in the closet to light.
If they didn’t like community collegiate scholaBrah cleaning his act before they sure as hell won’t like universal scholaBrah making the U turn full and complete &amp; now there’s nothing left to hide under the covers of the bed Brah made.
Otherwise they would go right back to it and you know what they say about shitting where you eat. It hasn’t been an easy hill to climb. Asking them to drop it for good secures Brah’s seat. Which I mean it never should have been in question to begin with and in comparison.

Because they need to know what they tried to pull was heinous and wrong AF. It grants the unbeknownst Brah moral high round and drives his worth astronomically because that’s his true intention. Regardless Brah remains innocent and it provides his safety in the grand scheme.

FOTM is the real worthless are the bandwagon shills, anybody backing them and enabling most heinous landfills, cesspools and black hole’s worth of highest crimes of treason and genocidal conspiracies.
You shills say Brahs worthless maybe it's you conformists that need to check yourselves before that pathetic MO drives you down like it has ’Murica world Puhlease. Fuck yeah! you know what to do from here.
I mean the hen hound ape killer almost got away with whatever the fuck we all know they were aiming to plant so in not just the grand scheme but every other little scheme too Brahs chair remains 99.9999% warranted.
Nothing wrong with being a Japanese adulterous.
Ultimate team player smoking a front that's still warranted by civil legislation that's inevitably gonna be a thing of the past in no time if they keep on backing the bandwagon.
Obvious answer is yes you should because nobody made the people gunning for brah jones his troll. Dude runs fractions of an inch cheating death tightest lines and he might be on his number nine.
I might be pimpin out but I ain't smackin em nor am I shaking the little ones. Check could, should and would have cashed over a month ago since this convenient little blindside happened if everyone was towin em straight and running right lines.
Nothing wrong with Brah coming out. Definition of being committed to honesty, doing the right thing &amp; guiding others to do the same in the face of failure &amp; the army of bandwagon shills insufferable about the good guy hang ups but turning blind eyes to straight up genocide.
It's just funny how people getting dragged into 14th century feudalism pawn it off on the leftist in the face of self proclaimed centrists that are really just alt right adjacent con artist grifters.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump The reason this is playing out in the long run for you assholes is on behalf the fascism you've been shoving down this country's throat for the past three decades. In less than another one America will be a filthy rich, fuck the poor 14th century dark age caste on your behalf.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Your agenda has compromised that "national security". There is nothing safe about POTUS' cozying up to dictators, whoring the country out and being in bed with propaganda death wheels. Ya'll are spineless.
@GOP @SteveScalise Isolationist policies are doing this country no favors. You're dead wrong and have been for decades. Under your watch we will only see further abuse of constitutional rights: don't forget, the first clause in the second amendment declares our militia to be "well regulated".
@RNCLatinos @realDonaldTrump ya'll are that daft. The globalist fascists the right is backing have done nothing to warrant the respect of the people they have driven to our borders and are jonesing on screwing into the penitentiaries. Do you dbags ever get tired of lying for a living?
@realDonaldTrump The wall is the absolute last thing we need to secure our country. You are correct in only one regard: we need to vet and investigate the people we let through our borders. You are only addressing the symptoms and ignoring the root cause of our problems.
straight up you owe it to the vampires sucking the life blood out of our society- it isn't their fault their brains got fed with the religious persecutive agenda. It can take generations to make that light shine inside: making that happen is the real gift that keeps on giving.
Regardless of how bad the Cons suck at everything regarding civilized life &amp; contributing to Democratic society, it is true you gotta treat your enemy like the neighbor they really are- even if they wanna ditch the aisle and build the penitentiary wall ten feet tall.
At the end of the day reaching across the aisle regardless is the only set of tools we have left. If our priors were naive enough to let the globalists snag reigns &amp; hand em over like they have, we have to be as hellbent lucrative &amp; applaud every sleight regarding fatty fingers.

Seriously though fam Paternalism is the dead weight ball and chain we don’t fuckin need. Baby boomers turned around and screwed everyone that didn’t agree with the “fuck you me first” Agenda so fuck how they react to the nonPCchalant. Civil disobedience is alpha royal hand.

FOTM is people that sell out get away with breaking every rule in the book and always opt into most miniscule microscope fractions of an inch hang ups on the good guys. Society will never stop pawning it off and it needs to be directed toward them.

@SpeakerRyan @GreggHarper People this is all a front they’re exploiting to distract us from what they’re aiming to do in a means to plow us all under before we knew what hit us. They’re shilling legislation to make it seem like they care about those whom they have disenfranchised.

That million dollar bid probably exponentiated and got forked over. That would be the entire reason why they’re trying to rob the grave and legislate the patents they have. Alright brahs you wanna play fine. We’ll match blows the next half a fucking century.
Brah red hands Don? Ah brah were gonna launch most insane fucked up sensationalist MSM propaganda death wheel in the history of Democracy to plow him &amp; the rest the world under. Fuckin love my shtick it’s that fucking big. You crooks compensating were always such incompetents.
Technological Soros on fucking crack dudes banking the fattest in the red on a fucking peg leg cards maxed stack. The cherry on top of the “this is how much your own country hates your fucking generation” sundae. Cannot BELIEVE this is the move you dbags have opted into.
It’s been delayed! Meaning if you drop it every red handed liberal wook smearing penny is gonna fly into his wallet before that scumbag deal floats and carries the momentum the real crooks pulling strings obviously want to use as a means to plow him under.
But what if? That liberal wook dogs you fuckin scumbags raw and mops your face with floor like he did Don &amp; the GOP.
James Gunn. The micro shtick in denial and what happens when the dregs of the gene pool pop one out they shouldn’t have.
James Gunn. Aka the sensationalist con artist scumbag who couldn’t make the cut after he wound up and lay down the sleight to clean his and instead opts into selling the fuck out and plowing a liberal wook under.
Don got his ass chewed apart, dogged raw and face taken to floor just sayin. That fool got suckered on a shtick that was in and out for a couple years &amp; got sealed within a couple weeks, single handed &amp; with odds stacked 99.99999% against.
Fuckin scumbag. Elevators &amp; escalators up and down over somebody that didn’t stand doing all the nitty gritty to get everybody else that couldn’t either up on their own 2. Who is paying this dbag the filthy cut of that fat stack he didn’t earn.
@Brightburn: @JamesGunn’s New MSM Corporate Conglomerate Liberal Wook Smearing Big Screen Big Green Machine He’s Probably Been Planning For Half a Decade Since This Bullshit Started Because Society Hasn’t Been Genius Enough to Criminalize Televised Propaganda.
It would not be hard to dish the cut dude earned nipping the deal they had planned to get away with plowing us all off the bat &amp; in the bud.
Admit it you dbags are hanging him dry because your only intention is to bank off his melts before you dog him, throw him under, ride elevators up &amp; over &amp; escalators down.
Dudes spinning most pro tit wookfest record by skin of his teeth laying slate after slate all goddam day. god fuckin knows who’s really banking on it, how much and the fuck you cherry on top of the “this is how fucking much your own country hates your generation sundae” is this.
Brah just looks so good banking off of smearing wooks and whoring their ideas out to a mega media conglomerate. The fuck. Brahs doing you fuckin assholes all kinda of bend over backwards favors and you opt into elevators &amp; escalators.
Brahs got SO much skin in the game along comes this fucking scumbag and evidently Nazi not even in disguise corporation gunning on escalators. Two galaxy the fuck ever movies and this is the scum he’s peddling. The fuck.
If it doesn’t float Brah will find a way to regardless fam nobody else can float deal like Brah can.
It’s not the infBrahdown. That’s the sticking to your guns it’s the HiveBrahdown anybody that’s gunning on pulling the strings they’ve snagged is going to be met with most fierce stake laying matched with sleight in history of the universe.
FOTM is if they’ve got shelves any cat that tries to snake it is gonna get put to shame by the real players backing the slate I’m laying with the sleight &amp; blows to match.
One Way is fuckin mine &amp; the entire eastern hemisphere knows it. Pulling amateur snake hour is not gonna float in the eyes of the hundred thousand Jedi lightsabers I’ve got behind me.
Obvious that KoBrahmas new brahject has been spoon fed by some pro titties.
FOTM is if koBrahma thinks he can whore it, if the Gunn that’s obviously just the microstick in denial can frame it, and the corporate dbags infesting Sony think they can get away with completely dogging me raw and snaking the master shtick they have another thing coming.
Skin of my teeth swear on my fuckin life with every big wig dbag gunning to bank quick, ride elevators up and escalators down. Why have billionaires when you can have shamanistic underwater basket weaving dolphins. Obviously have it out to snake mine and no other agenda.
If that’s the kangfirmed truth which considering the fact all signs lead to it those dbags are gonna get their fuckin faces mopped with floor just sayin. If brah gets the GOP to bite their tongue some scumbag banking on painting me out best prepare get drilled into ground.
@SquidInc_YT Irrelevant. Why is Sony patenting animation technology and why is James Gunn trying to bank on framing me? Here’s why: dudes career is on the ropes so now they’re gunning to bank on a deal I’ve been peddling behind scenes. If Sony patents Spidey they’ll sever ties with Disney.

Just sayin dude takes flubb and turns it into 12 months of righteous. FOTM is they’re hanging him up looking to ride that and if it happens once likelihood only increases. Utmost light and relevance brought to stake he is laying which is that check should have cashed off the bat.
With brah those flubbs that actually save the world are the segue into the next big terr FOTM.
You’re insufferable about minuscule hang ups meanwhile most people turn a blind eye to utmost heinous. Those hang ups are guaranteed if you’re forced to smoke and mirror your way thru meanwhile the rest of the world is busy looking to hound your inevitable sleight.

Cool fam now I made it and utmost stake being laid we can go back to pawning it off and roasting. Nothing sustainable about it and sleight is guaranteed just saying. Anybody in on real deal needs to acknowledge the greater good and value being brought to others.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends There is nothing secure about you backing up the most corrupt propaganda death wheel in the history of Democracy. Those jerks’ only intention is taking the word down and tracking the planet into a global dictatorship where people born into wealth remain wealthy.

@realDonaldTrump Way to pawn it off on the Dems again Donnie. You’re a scumbag. Your entire life was having it forked over and exemplifying the definition of everything wrong with the boomer entitlement whose sole agenda was forking it over to fascist crooks &amp; burning the world down.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump It’s true people the people that own the right winged MSMs sole agenda is plowing the whole world under. they’ve been busy drilling humanity for the past 3 decades since trickle down and framing anybody that stands in their way. How can you idiots continue to buy their lies.
Just saying people in this world with the real crooks pulling strings they want the wrong things to happen. If they have climate change and those countries infrastructure comes crumbling they’ll NEVER get up on their own 2 &amp; they’ll always be able to take advantage of innocence.

The thing is they won’t drop it regardless of how many times you bend over backwards or reach across the aisle. They take kindness and moral fiber and use it like expendable tissue paper. Most crooked party backing the most unsustainable agenda in the history of democracy.
The reason why the right won’t lift a finger is cuz they want to pocket the wealth and birth a ballers only society that discriminates poor people. It is completely rooted in childish traits on behalf religious heirs that skipped out on teaching them selflessness &amp; patriotism.

@realDonaldTrump Hillary won the DNC fair and square. After 6 years of the most corrupt filibustering on behalf the right the Clinton foundation provided the platform &amp; gave her administrative reigns. She won the primary fair and square.

People if they keep buying the right wing prop and place that coup here’s what gonna happen. Future generations of Americans won’t be able to trust or access any social infrastructure if they don’t have $$. That includes POs, PDs, schools, highways, hospitals and courts of law.
@realDonaldTrump Don, I’m gonna give you a piece of advice. Pawning the guilt off on everybody else is not a good indication. The only reason you’ve gotten away doing it this long is since you’re shticking it where nobody else wants to. That’s the sad reality you’re in denial of. You’re that bad.

Word is that lieutenant PO botched the write up!
The fact of the matter is: with the gargantuan money pit military, the in stone fork overs, the wealth gap, the rigged safety nets and the drilling of advocates the MOMENT feet plant there is going to be sleight of hand. Pointing fingers without addressing the cause is wrong.
People the reason why the civil advocates are this outspoken is cuz of how effin crazy the right wingers are and how fast they take down anybody that stands against their fascism on technological crack. This is where we’re at, it’s this bad people, it’s not ok and it’s scary AF.
These days they give it up for the people taking the planet down then act like the ones calling them out for blowing smoke, jonesin apocalypse and catching the same crooks behind scenes trying to taking the millennials down red handed are the bad guys. How messed up the US is.

Just sayin fam drilling people the moment feet plant and hanging advocates of civil liberty up over sleight meanwhile whoring it out behind the scenes is the indoctrination definition of fascism. Aka the grand scheme thing enabling all the wrong things.

Reality of the matter is: there is nothing okay about the right wing dictating what is and isn’t PC as long as they continue to pawn the flame off on the left like they do. It’s smoke and mirror bigotry utilized to exploit the constitution according to their MO. @realDonaldTrump

@3Catholic5Me @realDonaldTrump Real question should be is why are you asking that question. Dude the right could get away with anything due to the fact they run circles around our constitution and it’s not okay.
The live brah. 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑

Dudes banking the fattest stack running most entrepreneurial globalized hospitality industry &amp; does not know a goddam thing about enriching the lives that make his possible. Dudes got all the tools to enrich instead abuses. Reigns don’t belong end of story.
Come on fam that fool got suckered easy and face taken to floor on behalf of somebody with negative income in the red and in the eyes of all the pathetic excuses that MO makes possible. FOTM is teamwork makes the dream work if I can anybody can not that hard.
@realDonaldTrump it’s okay if you pull strings whenever YOU want. How about everybody else that gives a damn about innocent people? https://t.co/eGNJf3fWyk
Strapped down muhbrah. Sunkist and sudabrah. @realDonaldTrump
Funny thing is how with millennials its 99.9999% righteous but that .00001% dotted t is all they need to get away with apocalypse. Meanwhile on their end its 99.99999% spineless landfills cesspools blackholes all looking to ride that milenial one inch. Typical. @realDonaldTrump
Same old shit. Keep him down send him to pound even though he just got us screwing EVERYONE over red handed. Not in anybody's interests besides them people. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Attrocious as in planting a con and placing a million dollar bid on a millennial, getting red handed, acting like it didn't happen and pawning it off on the lib like you dbags always do?
@realDonaldTrump let's make a trade. I get reigns you get to feel what it's like to be treated poorly for having morals.
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑give it to me please.
Have no idea why you idiots are leaving me high and dry right next to the spaceship warden zig heil guy. Tomorrow ain’t just another day it was fractions of an inch tightest lines y’all need to dig your heads and fuckin recognize.
In real democratic societies when political reps get caught trying to kill younger generations they get locked up and the ones really protecting innocent and trimming the herd get rewarded just sayin.
Dear America I got em and I need MONEY
Just saying y’all our society is that fucked up he could get away with killing innocent and everyone would cheer. Somebody catches him red handed with the horses head in bed and it’s like inhale exhale.
Not just a brah I’m an onprobrah.
Love the fact how that dbag keeps tweeting after attempted murder and I get to sleep RIGHT NEXT to the surprise Russian.
Brah LOVE my new toy.
@realDonaldTrump You are SO fucked up.
@weird_weeaboo @jarrodlusk @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS this is how far the boldface fascist agenda has taken this country. You guys would wonder why somebody starting out from scratch would spread the word that the crook taking the planet down overnight planted a con with kemp and bribed him a mil to chop him into tiny little pieces.
@jarrodlusk @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Dude got nipped red handed slipping a con on me. Textbook con that doubled down on a million dollar bounty in a sublet I provided I overheard.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Joy would be you dropping it and taking those bootraps I’m pulling moral responsibility you preach. He’s still here Don. We all know what you tried to pull.
@realDonaldTrump the cons still here don. Cards maxed. 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Come on Don. Us millennials are tired of being taken down. 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑 @realDonaldTrump
Just saying people this administration is the DEFINITION of fascist. They JUST tried doin it. Proofs in the righteous (not the pathetic spineless amateur) pudding. There is no reason these crooks should be sitting in those chairs another day. @realDonaldTrump
@mjkeenan did NOT forget the pen.
@mjkeenan @angstlos8 ^^^^
The one thing the wagon that’s packing needs to realize is this: they trick you into think hanging good guy out to dry is in your best interest when it really ain’t and all a means for the real crooks pawning it off on everybody else to pocket all the wealth.
They call it being innocent and exercising rights. Utilizing both of those ain’t a crime and usually those with most say always fall back on rationale that insinuates more about them. Buckets gallons landfills of the sh*t everybody else is sick of that we don’t need.
Just saying: what do you gain out of destroying the lives of people who want to improve their society?
Proof right there. The “big stick” is compensation for the suck bad.
‘Nother day bein brahMerican. Bein brah.
@realDonaldTrump Come on Don we all know reasons why you’re melting up a storm right now. With you cats it’s all about having your way and that’s it. Unamerican.
And the wagon rolls right on through. Predictable.
@realDonaldTrump people the truth about the trump administration and his GOP cronies is this: anybody that stands against their fascist agenda gets blindsided before they stand a chance. None of this crap happens under blue POTUS and majority.
Party begins when you double brah down.
@GOP @cindyhydesmith @kayleighmcenany You only really can take EVERYTHING for granted with how far you crooks sunk this.
@NRAFamily @NRAblog Talk about BOLDFACE lies. Gun legislation does nothing to protect society said no one with an ounce of rational intelligence ever. How hard do you dbags even have to try to pawn it off on these poor &amp; innocent people who don’t know better. https://t.co/z93SapKhXt
@Olua_AO @Slate I mean the GOP only hung up millions and tossed them into indentured servitude so that whole hanging up the other 60 million against them ain’t really out the question bro. Gro a brain pal they’re gunning to sling the left in the torture chambers before they burn em.
@realDonaldTrump Every red vote is a fascist Unamerican vote against America y’all. Don’t get it twisted this crook is robbin you blind. It’s in their name they’re con artists they don’t have to try.
Saddle up fam we’re goin vault huntin’.
@Olua_AO @Slate Zero tolerance for fascism destroying my country, robbing my people and taking the planet down with it overnight.
@Olua_AO @Slate It’s true pal. You’re bein conned it’s in their name y’all inbreds are THAT dumb they don’t have to try.
@realDonaldTrump The swamp is you dbags. Y’all are terrible people and don’t belong with reigns you’re abusing to gridlock everything and camp that swamp.
@Olua_AO @Slate There’s a reason they pawn you suckers into it- y’all are that dumb. Their only intention is to get you to do the nitty gritty for them before you throw you under and trim that fat too.
@realDonaldTrump It wouldn’t be a “witch hunt” if you weren’t jonesin on hanging the left up to dry and playing victim to it Donnie.
Stone cold CRIMINALS. 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪

@Olua_AO @Slate It’s called first amendment rights. We know you just wanna keep the second so you can hippies blind and hang em dry. Y’all turd chompers on the right are the real crooks on this deal just saying you need to drop that “big stick” that really ain’t.
