@brooksbayne Abortion is barbarian. But then so is the row upon row of unwanted infants around the world. There must be a better way.

@DrRus  "well over half the world’s population living better lives because of George Bush " Oh, I would venture that is a stretch.
Good morning new, improved nation. Can you feel it?
@newmediajim Keep warm!
Got my invite but so glad I stayed home! Will watch from the comfort of my living room. Crowds make me claustrophobic. Happy Inauguration!
@TrafficGen  Media is an ingrained part of our society, as so is viral media that can take on a more objective view. It all plays a part.
@TrafficGen Re: Many believe Obama to be the savior of our economy. Maybe not a savior of our economy but of our optimism.
@ValerieStevens Hey, he might be a lot of fun!
@ValerieStevens Ha! I don't know if that was a good move! You may have @devil following you next!
@jeffpulver You, as well, Jeff! A very promising day for a promising future.
@ValerieStevens Did you decide to follow @god yesterday?
@openzine Re: "Anyone that knows me..." Anyone WHO knows me!  We still need to follow our grammar rules in blog-land:) I am SOOO annoying!
@OutsideMyBrain Thank you for the link.
@RosePena It's a one of those times when people want to share. Social media has just extended our "family."
@davewiner  Michele needs to lose the skirt today! I was feeling for her during the concert!
@MarkClayson How sad. Depression is not a factor when you are doing what you really want with your life.
@ggw_bach  Optimism is a glorious thing, isn't it?
@imajes Oh, yikes!
@imajes If it's any consolation, I've lost $50,000 in the last few months with conservative investments and I HAVE been paying attention!
@ev Ha! Well, now if you get lonely in line, you can call yourself:)
@imajes You haven't been paying attention!!! You JUST NOTICED?
@RosePena Inspiring.
@Scobleizer George Lucas, bah!
@MarkClayson Re:http://tinyurl.com/6wk36l  Ha! I see a new application for my talent. Who wouldn't want a vase shaped like their profile!
@supbro Put the twitter down and get your butt to school! (So speaketh a MOM!)
@weirdchina So how is that different from them sending their cheap knock offs over here? I guess they can't knock off Apple:)
@newmediajim Are you psyched or stressed? Exciting day in the life of a camera guy!
@atuarre Glad you're feeling better. This would be a lousy day to feel bad!
@boom8088 Hey, you can speak, I can type. It's nice to have a place in this world:)
@TerraScene I'd like to believe that shift is taking place every day, little by little.
@BlisfulyDomestc My teenagers even became involved in the Obama campaign. On their own! They are celebrating their part in history today.
@boom8088 Ha! If only toastmasters could teach us to type:) Thanks for the link!
@TerraScene People like @glendawh should fill us with hope as well. There are heroes among us. All we have to do it look hard enough.
@John_Taylor Still true today. If only we could get some savvy business people involved in public service & run the country like a business.
@ev Fascinating times to be so central to the pulse of the nation, huh? What a successful phenom twitter has been!
@SashaKane But that would have been BEFORE the decision to offer Hillary the position, so I doubt that it would matter at this point.
@SashaKane Jill should know....
@boom8088 Misspelled your link: http://www.toastmasters.org  You are welcome:)
@Positive_Thinkr SO true. But after the hoopla, the hard work begins. We are all in this together but what a great time this will be.
@vipvirtualsols Read that yesterday. Some people still aren't savvy about conducting themselves properly in the cyber world. That was a duh!
@lonniehodge Ha! You need a good pair of ear plugs.
I am not the only one up at this ungodly hour? Don't you people SLEEP???
@contentions "History Will Vindicate George W. Bush" That, indeed, is quite contentious!
@SashaKane Thank you for posting that link. I hadn't seen it yet.

@eddiebreen AMAZING photos! My 16 yr old son helped me appreciate the beauty in decay. And urban art (graffiti) Some incredible talent.
@ValerieStevens Best job? Definitely mine!
@OutsideMyBrain Yes, I agree.
@davewiner I didn't even realize Pete was still alive. Amazing moment. Amazing time.
@TheOnion Amazing. Off to a running (progressive) start.
@OutsideMyBrain Did! Thanks!
@OutsideMyBrain There used to be a radio station that played nothing but positive approach broadcasting. Zig was on there a lot. Neat guy.
@SpiritCoach Yup! I wish I had known it would be so much fun. I would've just fast-forwarded!
I, personally, think tomorrow should be a holiday as well. Just as momentous as what today stands for, we are entering a new era.
@eddiebreen That's why you keep the cat OUT of the bedroom!
@SpiritCoach Happy bday, Stephanie. This decade is a wonderful one. And I used to think when you turned 50, your life was over.
Good morning...isn't this a holiday? Why is everyone else up so early?
@Scobleizer The face of journalism has changed so drastically. I often wonder if the "new" journalism isn't MORE objective.
@SideHustleCoach Creativity is still "business" when it's something you make your livelihood at. Artists and biz don't always mesh well.
@RosePena That's part of what should have been spelled out BEFORE they got the money...oh well, hindsight....
@danamo Well they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...or something like that:)
@SideHustleCoach  What DID happen to them? I miss music with a message.
@ITSinsider A very progressive geek! Let's see those tech stocks make a turnaround! Timothy and I need retirement $$$!

@PeterSantilli Done. I'm embarr2000.
@kristn And he would be wrong, wouldn't he?
@PeterSantilli Someone sent me the funniest attachment re:70's fashion. I would love to share it but it's a pdf file.
@Armano Interesting question. I am losing my hearing (genetic thing) and I am actually enjoying the silence! Would not want to lose sight.
@wilddogstudio You should have called. I would have put you to work packing:) Fun, fun!
@wilddogstudio You didn't come visit me:(
@SashaKane I used to think twitter was a total waste of time, but it is amazing how many thoughtful, wise people are here.
@MarkHeartofBiz Beautiful little boys. Ah, the journey of parenthood is now before you. There is no greater joy-- or more frustrating!
@CCSeed Re: where is Blowing Rock? Great Smoky Mountains, NC. Wonderful area.
@sethsimonds In it's sincerity, the first implies all the rest.
@TheSCICoach Original "To Kill a Mockingbird."
@CareNews In retrospect, I question anything that came out of the current administration's "certainty" -- very thought provoking video.
@dsearls As a girl who grew up in the Midwest and now lives in S FL, I am still awed by the quiet hush of a new snowfall.
@jowyang He's positioning himself for his next source of income, no doubt.
@RosePena  As an artist, I embrace the idea that there can be this highly sensitive trait that is the caretaker of beauty and wisdom.
@MarkHeartofBiz Are you back home w/ babies?
@ValerieStevens People have scheduled robotic tweets?  I am SOOO clueless!
@ValerieStevens re: Grab life by the balls and RUN!!!!!! Is that suggesting "life" is a male? Sounds painful!
@RosePena  She deals with it as a normal character trait...just not one embraced by our fast track society.
@ValerieStevens Only 10 iPods??? Is that all they have left from their liquidation?
@ValerieStevens Ha! I thought that "Guess What?" was a test. Just a little bit of social science in tweetdom!
@RosePena Also interesting is Elaine Aron's concept of the HSP "highly sensitive person" -- shyness isn't exactly negative.
@CCSeed Very thoughtful blog post on "Tuesday" btw. We are living in truly exciting times. Our generation is so lucky for all we have seen.
@CCSeed Andrew Wyeth died? I have always been fascinated with his art.
@davewiner Uh, they've suggested Britney Spears for me to follow? Where do they glean their information?
@newmediajim These are fascinating times we're living in and you are RIGHT THERE! Knock on recycled wood!
@TerraScene Better to have one piece of the whole right-minded than none, huh?
@brooksbayne Interesting article on Google. Despite the hype surrounding the company, they still hire humans w/flaws & insecurities. HUMANS!
@TerraScene You are very welcome. The biggest way to teach change in the world is by example. LIVE your truth. Others will follow in time.
@atuarre  And where is this "cash" coming from?
@Dana_Willhoit I agree the recipient gets the good deal, however, the giver needs to explore the intent. Just my humble opinion.
@Dana_Willhoit I don't think it is bad,but I do think intent is important. If giving to charity is all self-serving, I think it is negative.
@brooksbayne  Firing an intoxicated employee is "micro-managing" -- lovely!
@gregorylent  I do believe that. Control is merely an illusion.
@gregorylent You are correct. No one knows what will work. We have no historic perspective on a time of crisis like this one.
Worth a RT. This is chilling. @TheOnionThis Short Story About A School Shooting Is Actually Pretty Good http://twurl.nl/kffi77

@AmishPhoneBook Michael's parents just came in from MN. They are so thankful to be here in FL. Times like this I am glad I live here.
@wbaustin Would love to find programs like that in So FL!
@emoltzen Will pass this on to web designer bf. We were just talking about MS last night.
@PeterSantilli  Wish I could hear it. Teenagers grabbed my speakers.
@DesignPepper I am grateful for my accountability partner who makes me list my grateful items every day and keeps me humble.
@emoltzen But isn't that typical of Microsoft's modus operandi?
@lonniehodge What a wonderful idea! We could learn some things from the Chinese in many ways.
@Rex7 Re: Hidden bubble: "How you find expertise is a big problem," All they have to do is consult Twitter -- full of social media "experts"
@Dana_Willhoit  Isn't that just a new way to market karma?
@PinkOliveFamily Significant other makes a decent living w/affiliate marketing which amazes me.
@DanTanner DOW down, mortgage rates and treasuries in the dumpster and corporate bonds are UP! What a weird economy!
Taking your teenager to the bus stop in cold weather is a great opportunity to impart wisdom. You have a captive audience stuck in the car.
@shermradio Re: Intelligence is the new cool. I have been trying to convince my teenagers of this:)
@atuarre Ran into some people who worked for MTV who said they would NEVER let their kids watch it if they had kids.
@atuarre Our children live in a very strange world colored by things we weren't exposed to.
@karalennox Kara! How wonderful.
@ruby I think hiding behind the online "face" makes people more likely to do and say things they normally would not.
@atuarre He's still sorting it out. Too many conflicting stories abound.
@ruby Teen girls are the worst and I am sure my daughter wasn't totally innocent.
@ruby My daughter was threatened by a group of girls at school today due to MySpace.. Asst. Principal sent her home - felt she wasn't safe.
Had a friend ask me today what I attributed my peacefulness to. And I really didn't know. It kind of snuck up on me...or its Alzheimer's.
@CoffeeCupNews I JUST learned the difference between latte and cappucino...from McDonalds. Sad, huh?
@judyrey However, I still believe there is a place for it in local news which doesn't have the online/television exposure.
@judyrey Seth's blog makes some interesting points. I gave up on the hard copy newspaper a long time ago. It just seemed to lag in relevance
@JenniferBridge Yes, they certainly do still make Pop Rocks! Such delightful little explosions in your mouth.
@mattrendo UGH!
@RobertBerryhill So what is your next adventure, Robert?
5:47 am. I used to be able to do this with ease but these early mornings are getting more and more difficult!
@Wakingbearstudo Oh, you are SO sweet. Yes! That would be lovely!
@dougjumper I think it is more of a PR move to get people motivated and out of the emotionanl slump. My two nickels for the day (inflation).
@dougjumper I am not so sure his economic stimulus package will work, either. But he needs to show to the public that he is doing something.
@wilddogstudio @dorana Darn, I missed it! Well, that will be my fifteen minutes of "fame" lol!
@dorana Oh, there was someone exceptional on Etsy and now I can't find her. If I come across her, I will let you know.
@HildyGottlieb Oh, Hildy, loved your blog post! I am proud to be a "Pollyanna."
Picking up the offspring at the bus!
@dougjumper Is that the way they teach you to spell at Ol' Miss? lol! White flag. We'll have to watch how this plays out, won't we?
@dougjumper Yes, you are right, long term. But what do we do short term? (I guess we're still debating....)
@newmediajim Thanks Jim, but I would probably have a meltdown after one day! But what a fun day that would be!
@dougjumper btw, are we still debating? Just checking:)
@dougjumper Ah, Douglas, this is a different world than Ronnie was contending with. Hollywood endings aren't as easy to come by these days.

@zoransa Thank you for the kind comment.

@zoransa What a wise little girl she is!
@dorana No, I don't. Why?
@1god I SOOO miss that...NOT! Of course, I have teenagers. Wanna trade?
I beseech you, no more follows by another "social media guru" -- how many of you are out there?
@guykawasaki lol, you may be robotic, but you come up with very thought-provoking material.
@dorana The more, the merrier. I am getting absolutely no work done now anyway. My wheel is buried in the garage under a bunch of stuff.
@Scobleizer But then again, maybe I fall into the "useless" category!
@Scobleizer Great observations! I originally likened Twitter to being in a room where everyone was talking at once and no one was listening.
@AmoreVivo  A tent CITY, on the beach! Better than a condo.
@BreakingNewsOn It's about time!
@AmoreVivo @dorana Gonna be crowded in that tent!

@guykawasaki No they must have that wrong. My daughter is 17!

@dougjumper I also worked for the RTC in early 90's. This is totally different. Greed on wall st. fueled this fire. BUT how to turn around?
@dougjumper I was in the industry when Fannie was the cream of the crop buyer. So I invested in FNMA bonds-duh! Gov't is at fault.
@dougjumper Oh I know it was a web of greed. Lenders could sell more paper because of dereg, the market was buying as fast as they could.
@seerysm I live in Jupiter, right down the street. Welcome. Isn't it pretty out there?
@Pleasureellis I think it is fundamental to the buddhist concept that life is struggle.

@gregorylent "We need not explain that he is awake and relate a dream of the roe" Dream of the fish eggs??? lol.
@dougjumper Happily I am not in that situation but know many who are. Our meltdown was due to corp. greed and who pays for it in the end?
@dougjumper Let's say you are the guy who can't feed his family & can't wait until the economy recovers on its own. What would YOU suggest?
@dougjumper I agree about the spending. After all, we don't have it to spend. But then we are all so selfish, we want it to be fixed NOW.
@gregorylent Yes I suspected it was machine generated. Lovely string of words, nonetheless.
@bethgwaz The story about the man who wanted his donated kidney back from his ex-wife is TOO funny!

@quiltlover03 I moved our satellite once so the kids would quit watching TV...then couldn't get it back in position! TV is so overrated:)
@TheSCICoach Sometimes lending makes the recipient feel part of the process and keeps his dignity intact, ie. "Give a man a fish...."

Make a difference this year: http://www.kiva.org/, http://onceuponaschool.org/ Let's stop focusing on our own problems.
@macroaxis Interesting piece. Citigroup's slow actions might actually represent great thought and due diligence. Wow, go figure.
@neoblog I was just thinking the same thing! Crave the peace and quiet of the early morning, however, so it's all good.
@CareNews Why couldn't nerds be cool when I was in high school!
@dougjumper I think my point was it that Obama actually LISTENS to those who know more than he does. Quite a departure from status quo.
@dougjumper Very true, however, as an investor, I know this is NOT a "simple" recession. I agree that the handouts need to be stopped.
And while I'm at it, I will do some promotion. http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com. There, I think I've annoyed enough people today!
Speaking of doing something for someone else, this doesn't require your money, only your time. http://www.onceuponaschool.org/
Think your life sucks? Do something for someone else. http://www.kiva.org/  How about that for economic stimulus?
@dougjumper Easy for us to sit back and speculate. We aren't in the hot seat.
@dougjumper I hear you. No one has the right answer. These are not normal times & there is no good solution.
@ClipBlast When did that happen. I must be living under a rock.
@dougjumper Poor Obama inherited quite the mess. He's damned no matter which way he turns. I still have respect and honor his judgment.

@newmediajim Yup, I did. Have a great day. Audio guys are only brave operating in that "pack mentality"
@dorana Will have to send some to you. 3 car garage with shelves galore and lots of sunlight = one AWESOME studio! Looks out onto preserve.
@dorana @Bijouxbead Life is definitely interesting, though not very creative right now. Looking forward to things settling down.

@ginabad Ha! I am such a non-techie. I thought YOU were sick! Duh!
@dorana Good morning my dear friend. Hope all is well.
@newmediajim Are you feeling neglected, Jim?
@ginabad Yikes! What is sagipsul virus?
@ginabad There is a good side. I bought a house on an acre on a golf course with pool for $450,000! So it's all good:)
@AmoreVivo Thanks, sweetie! Can't do any work until I get set up in the new house. My wheel is buried under junk in the garage!
It is an incredible buy! $479,000. Last appraisal was $735,000. Market is abysmal but it's a great time to buy  if you can get financing.

Good morning lovely tweets.Things are slow in the shop so I'm going to bore you with a promotion...Sorry! http://madhatterspotttery.etsy.com
@AmishPhoneBook Awe! What a cutie!
I think Gupta is a brilliant choice. Who else has had as much exposure to all areas of the medical world bringing us newsworthy information?
Just received the most incredible raku buddha in the mail by http://thebuddhabuilder.etsy.com. This will be my third buddha!
@Carignan "Thinking about how much my wife and children mean to me" That makes me SMILE!!!
@ruby Dr. Gupta is not just a pretty boy but a neurosurgeon who is up to the minute on cutting edge technology due to his gig at CNN.
@JesseNewhart  Too bad. I liked Live Journal's format. Much more professional than the MySpace and Facebook format.
@kcclifford What an awesome talent!  Everyone needs to listen to KC's music:  http://www.kcclifford.com  I wish you truckloads of success!
@AmoreVivo As you can see, I am having a hard time following her wise advice..ok..I am GONE!
@AmoreVivo I am SO lucky, aren't I???
@WalterBurns I love your question "Is Twitter consuming your life?" I wonder if all these people are wasting their employer's time? Hmmm.
@MyBizzieLizzie Ha! So did I! Real estate paralegal BC (before children). Paid the bills but sucked out the creative marrow! UGH!
T@S_Elliott So true on #8 on your list. I found many things that opened my eyes. Safety before privacy for our teens.
My accountability partner (love you, Deb!) is limiting my e-time to 2 sessions of 30 min. so must go and get some work done.
@FloradoraInc Hello my lovely friend! How are you?
@MyBizzieLizzie Well there is a matter of the old one that is the problem! No one can get financing in this economic environment.
@norakaren My holiday was lovely! 3 states in 2 weeks. I now appreciate being warm after CO, MN and NC! How was yours?
I just bought a new house.  I think....
@goldmindgroup  Have a friend who is over in Dubai working as a contract engineer right now. Amazing place and ripe for motivated people.
@CCSeed Don't we all wish we had that wisdom in high school?
Ready Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Interesting take on how opportunity has as much to do with success as good hard work.
If you love knowledge like I do, check out TED, http://www.ted.com/index.php/. Incredible site!
@0boy Great article. Unfortunately, no one stands to make a huge profit from us being a healthy planet yet. When that day comes....
Since I am a writer, I can't seem to be able to say much of consequence within 140 characters and make it worthy of notice!
@maramingsalamat Interesting article. I do in fact wonder if ANYBODY really cares if I am picking my toenails....
@latishasimmons lol, wow, I know that was so random!  Sorry!
@latishasimmons All I know is it's good for UTI's.
@scrapperkare You are welcome! Looks like a great site!
Time to get back to promoting!  http://www.madhatterspottery.etsy.com
New year...gotta start working! UGH!
Saw the move Doubt last night. Very thought provoking. Had seen the play but liked the movie better...go figure! Meryl Streep shines.
@kellywanlass Thanks, Kelly, but we are trying not to rent a car.  Silly, huh?
@shaunstweets Don't bet on it!
@TmChickenPants Thanks, that one is on our list.
@wilddogstudio  Ha! The tooth fairy, I presume!
@shaunstweets Switching settings on my kiln is about as technical as I get.  Twitter is already above my artsy-fartsy head!
@norakaren Hi nora!
@shaunking  We should do great things with no strings attached.
@shaunstweets Very cool. Thank you! Now as a non-techie, I need to figure it out!
Anyone know a great B&B in San Francisco?  Websites are awful.
@MelissaLund Rosetta Stone is awesome.  Of course you need to practice and that is what I have a hard time doing!
@kellyh99  And I thought Twitter was a total waste of time! Blessings, Candice
@wilddogstudio Thanks!!!
As a twitter newbie, how do I search for people that I think I would be interested in following, that have the same interests?
Everyone else is asleep. Savoring the quiet. Wish I could hold on to it for a good long time but teens and quiet don't mix.
@lorilyn Quietly festive - the best kind.  I like your vision board idea.
@agru thank you for your filtering suggestion. I will try it! Have a very Happy New Year!
@lorilyn I agree!  Happy New Year to all.
@FluidDruid23 Kinda like our world in general, huh?
Haven't figured this Twitter thing out. Feel like I'm in a room where everyone is talking at once and no one is listening. Too much noise.
Good morning.  The last glimmers of 2008...what will you do differently in 2009?
@liubinskas And to you as well!!!
@cc_chapman  Contagious???
@traderadvice Just got Motley Fool income advisor.  McCormick, Johnson & Johnson advised for solid dividend paying stocks. I'm buying.
@zaibatsu Too bad Detroit's too cold!

@ScottMonty It could help Ford's executives parallel park next time they "drive" to DC:)
@ScottMonty Doesn't Ford have bigger problems than whether it's customers can properly parallel park? R&D didn't have better things to do?
@DocRob  Hmmm...and what are these things made of?  Same ol' plastic?
@lizstrauss Hi Liz, purchased your ebook, now how do I access it?
@davewiner So very sad.
Looking for people who want to use social media to become socially responsible.
@shaunking What a shame we can't separate the individuals from the politics.
@Bijouxbead Hi girlie! What's up for your new year???
@MaryannReid Thank you Maryann. Still trying to maneuver this site. In search of intelligence and heart.
But to feel productive, I will hawk my 20% off sale. If you've been putting off buying, now is the time!  http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com.
Very hard to get back in the swing of things...ugh...work...I think I can stretch this lollygagging for a few more days!
Holiday traffic was hell.  What usually takes 10 1/2 hrs. took over 14.  Feeling like I have a hangover and I don't even drink!
Went shopping yesterday and was dismayed by the amount of "junk" in the stores.  I think I have been spoiled by Etsy and buying handmade.
Post holiday sale, tweets. http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com
Just finished "The Biology of Belief" by Bruce Lipton.  Interesting read at this time of year.
Does anyone else see the moral irony of our economy which is based on overt materialism while thousands are without jobs?  Just musing.
Met Steve West of Cross Trade International yesterday.  Very cool mission.  See their site.   http://www.crosstrade.org/
Said it before....gonna keep saying it.  See "Seven Pounds" then become an organ donor.  The greatest gift you may give this holiday.
@projectVISUAL Hmmm...how did we become such a bureaucracy?
Leaving my cabin in the mountains tomorrow...headed back to FL!  Have I mentioned I HATE FLORIDA???
So...back to promoting my 20% off sale!  http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com.
Back from the outlet stores.  Sadly disappointed.  Can you believe that I didn't buy anything but a rain jacket?  Ho-hum!
Everyone have an awesome day!  I am going to do some post-holiday bargain hunting!
@AmoreVivo  Busy is good! Christmas hugs to you!
@FloradoraInc It was great.  Feel better!
@FloradoraInc  Hi, sweetie!  How was your Christmas?
@danpatterson  Maybe Ted Stevens and Sarah Palen could do the talk show circuit "Good Morning, Alaska."
@OldSayingGame "...call the fire department!"  Hey, those Madagascans aren't dummies!
@emilychang What a lovely sentiment.  I wish the same for you!
@AmoreVivo It was awesome!  How about you?
@PurpleTriangle Hi, my friend!  Nice to see you here.  Hope all is well:)
Anyone interested in the integration between science and spirituality may want to read The Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton.
@thocon  EWWWW....lol!
Happy Boxing Day, all!
Post holiday sale:  http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com!!!  In the meantime, continuing my holiday vacation in the beautiful mountains!
@laughingsquid Someone needs to notify Hallmark.  There's missing out on a great opportunity.
@RizzoTees I don't think so. Go to Amtrak website. I've checked on them before and had little luck.
Got up to the mountains last night and found our main furnace is out. Our subcontractor will get out "sometime today."  Fa la la!
Speaking of business:  Last call before Christmas:) http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com
@Carignan  YAY for Christmas tamales!  Ole!
@CCSeed In the arts world, social and business intermingle naturally.  We just call it "support."  Interesting blog.
Using these last few hours to pack up orders.  Anyone else?  Tonight I am GONE!  http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com
@JasonFinch  Fa-la-la!  Have FUN!
@jenscloset  My son said "Don't worry Mom, I'm not going anywhere."  Yikes!  I don't want him living with me when he's 30!
Just had our "faux Christmas" -- crying like a baby 'cause my teens grew up so quickly! They were still excited about their stockings!
@MostFavorite Hard to ride a bike through the snow:)
Wanted to bump this info up for my friend, ULTRentrepreneur, Darlene: Bijouxbead featured on CBC Newsworld December 27 12:30pm & 5:30pm EST
@AmoreVivo  - how are you???  Keep warm, sweetie.  Hugs!
@Bijouxbead my kids are teens and I want THEM to make the cookies now but they don't:(  I guess that's better for the waistline!
@Bijouxbead - Happy cookie baking!  Hugs!  Yay on the TV spot. You are amazing!
At the risk of repeating myself, everyone MUST go see "7 Pounds."  You will leave profoundly moved in the deepest way.
Last Christmas candle left!  On SALE http://tinyurl.com/4q5bqn
Getting ready to head up to mountains for the holiday.  Will be shipping priority til noon tomorrow. http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com
@laughingsquid  Those Santas are a hoot!
Sounds wonderful, CCSeed.  Enjoy the warmth!
Yay, Amanda!  Have a great time at home with the family.  Merry Christmas!!!
Went to see "Seven Pounds" last night.  SEE it, tell your friends.  Then donate your organs.  It could be the greatest gift you ever give.
Thank you to everyone who has supported my shop throughout the year and made it such a fantistically fun endeavor!
I never liked Florida but after spending the last two weeks in Minneapolis and Denver, someone slap me if I ever complain again!
Still need a Christmas gift? I am sending priority through Sunday noon, free giftwrapping: http://madhatterspottery.etsy.com.
Off to pick up the car at the dealership.  She's got new shoes and had a bath.  She's one step ahead of me today:)
