@hugorifkind I think you mean: "The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun." The King James Version. That modern translation is a travesty.
I do enough reading without having to scroll through #280characters. Thanks a lot, Twitter. On the other hand, I look forward to seeing how Donald Trump responds to the new medium. Like when the Beatles started recording with an 8-track. More thoughts.  See, it's too bloody much.

@RosieDuffield1 Labour taking Canterbury was one of the best results of the night, and something I never thought I'd see. Congratulations!

Theresa May's speech outside Number 10: "Election? What election?"
@JamesCleverly Again, patronising.
It's actually the Tories taking us back to the 1970s, with snap elections which backfire and chronic instability.
Kensington in London, once referred to the bluest seat in the country, looks set to turn red.
Jeremy Corbyn achieved the largest increase in the share of the vote by a Labour leader since Clement Attlee in 1945.
In 1997 Labour got 13,518,167 votes. The total for last night with only Kensington to declare is 12,858,644. We can win next time!
RT @theresa_may: If I lose just six seats I will lose this election and Jeremy Corbyn will be sitting down to negotiate with Europe: https:…
I need to take a nap now, but I feel like things are just getting started.
Labour came quite close to winning Watford. Something to work for in the next election.
A hung parliament is now a fact.
Quite keen to go to bed, but I am desperate to know the final arithmetic. I wonder what they're drinking in YouGov headquarters?
@GuardianAnushka I rather enjoy being described as a "problem".
It's worth remembering what this means for the Brexit process. We now have no party with an overall majority able to negotiate a deal.
We on the left must do some serious work to build on this result. I don't want it to go to waste.
I'm not sure how much consolation the Tories will get from Amber Rudd keeping her seat. But I'm still a little disappointed for Labour.
@C4Ciaran What a snowflake.
@BBCPropaganda Really? How do you explain Canterbury then?
I'm hearing the Battle of Hastings result is imminent.
Anna Soubry, who kept her seat, being absolutely scathing about the Tory campaign. Clearly doesn't want Theresa to continue.
Alex Salmond loses his seat. The rumours were true.
I'm going to try and stay up for Hastings and Rye. Just a goal I'm setting myself...
Labour hold Luton South comfortaby. Well done to Gavin Skuker.
You can't call a snap election, lose ministers, and then carry on as before. May has to go.
So Theresa, what's the naughtiest thing you've ever done?
@JosieLong The best result of the night so far.
Labour win Canterbury, a Conservative seat since it was created in 1918. The students weren't bluffing.
Theresa May, the worst Prime Minister since...David Cameron?
If Labour wins Canterbury, then YouGov might not be so stupid after all....that would be seismic.
I'm pleased that the Lib Dems have taken Bath; a wonderful city which deserves much better than the Tories.
Labour gain Ipswich from the Conservatives. Fantastic news.
Tories are still calling me and my generation stupid. Maybe you should listen to our concerns instead, you might learn something.
Goodbye Nick Clegg, thanks for all of the memories (and the debt).
The Conservatives hold Stevenage, a bellwether seat, but Labour a strong second.
John Nicolson loses his seat. This looks to be a terrible night for the SNP.
Justine Greening, on BBC News, blaming her result on the stupidity of young people. No wonder she lost so many votes.
@stephenpollard Maybe you need to get out more.
Angus Robertson loses his seat. Many Scots clearly didn't like the idea of a second idependence referendum.
Well done to Mandi Tattershal for increasing Labour's share of the vote in Hemel Hempstead from 23.8% to 36.9%!
Labour take Battersea from the Conservatives, but George Obsorne already knew that.
"We are witnessing the end of two-party politics", says noone now.
Justine Greening's majority in Putney was cut from 10,000 to just 1,000. Labour are on the march in London.
Labour takes Vale of Clwyd from the Conservatives in Wales.
@LPerrins Yep.
Anna Soubry and Nick Clegg both supposed to be losing their seats to Labour. That would be quite a result.
Labour take Rutherglen and Hamilton West from the SNP.
Both of the two main parties are putting on votes; could it be that not that many seats change hands?
Variations on a Theme by Exit Poll.
The Conservatives apparently feeling quite glum about Amber Rudd's seat in Hastings and Rye, but could such as result really be possible?
The pollsters still can't agree on anything, this could be a long night.
Increased Labour majority in the first result in Newcastle Central.
I urge caution about this exit poll, but it would have to be spectacularly wrong for May to be able to claim this election as a success.
RT @Hemellabour: Get yourself down to the Marlowes and meet #mandi4hemel https://t.co/PWNBLY36fj
RT @Hemellabour: Mandi's latest video. The Tories in Hemel aren't listening. You can change that on Thursday. https://t.co/C991D07xaB
RT @Hemellabour: The NHS has looked after Hemel. Now it's time for us to look after the NHS. Please share local NHS campaigner Betty Harris…
