@MEaglen @bergerrichard This would preserve the original intent of those executive authorities while preventing this specific misuse of defense investments. Congress is an equal branch and should act to protect the military and preserve the power of the purse.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard The solution? The Senate GOP can lead the way by drafting and passing bipartisan legislation that does not challenge the emergency declaration itself, but rather fences off the military construction account.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard Fifth, the president just pitted two top Republican priorities squarely against one another. By pitting the wall against the military, Trump undermines his own case for rebuilding the military and allows Democrats to impugn the seriousness of the military readiness crisis.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard Fourth, this drastically lowers the threshold for declaring an “emergency” to solve any problem the president can’t solve in bipartisan negotiations with Congress. Democrats will surely seize upon this expansion of executive authority in the future.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard Third, the emergency declaration places Senate Republicans in an impossible position. Speaker Pelosi will push a resolution of disapproval through the House and vulnerable 2020 Rs will be stuck voting between supporting the wall, the military, and the idea of limited government.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard Second, numerous lawsuits will tie up this money, leaving the wall unbuilt in the meantime. While we all wait for the long legal process to play out, thousands of troops will remain stranded at the border instead of carrying out their training missions elsewhere.
@MEaglen @bergerrichard First, every military construction and family housing project with dollars diverted to the wall will stop immediately. Just yesterday, lawmakers heard from military families as they testified for hours about the disgusting state of family housing at bases across the country.

@ZackCooper "I think that’s the argument, and if you believe that, then actually what you’re competing over are the alignment decisions of regional states rather than the underlying power of China itself."
@ZackCooper "...and therefore you don’t have to do these urgent moves to slow down the Chinese economy...[you can] push back only where the Chinese are trying to undermine the system. You can push back in a very pointed way, but without trying to forcefully slow Chinese growth."
@ZackCooper "...and if you look at the United States and its allies in Asia, we’re incredibly strong. And if you add to this calculus our allies around the rest of the world, we’re in a far better position than people give us credit for..."
@ZackCooper "I would call it collective balancing, and its logic is fairly simple. China is a strong country and it’s been growing pretty fast for the last 30 years. But, the United States is still a pretty big economy..."
@ZackCooper What would the alternative look like?
@ZackCooper "My view is that if we try and contain China that way we will run into two problems: one is that our allies and partners are going to push back on Washington pretty hard...the second is that within Washington I’m not sure there’s a bipartisan consensus on that kind of policy."
@ZackCooper "The problem with this is that it sounds a lot like a containment strategy. But the big difference here is that the Soviet Union wasn’t so economically intertwined...today you have China, which is the number one trading partner of almost every country in Asia."
@ZackCooper "[It] is certainly not my view, but there is a group in the administration that thinks that this is just not a China that’s going to take on the kinds of reforms we would need to see so we have to protect ourselves and detangle the two economies to the extent that we can."
@ZackCooper "But, at the end of the day, a lot of the regulatory structures in China aren’t going to change overnight. As a result, it is hard for me to imagine the kind of reciprocity that people want to see occurring."
