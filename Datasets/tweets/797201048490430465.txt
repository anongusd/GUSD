The political miscalculation by Senate Minority Leader Schumer was despicable and a reckless way to govern. Had the Democrats put their self-serving agendas aside, this unnecessary shutdown could have been completely avoided.
This unnecessary shutdown shines a light on Democrats’ stunning hypocrisies, as all of the initiatives in the CR have been supported by the Democrats for years.
#SchumerShutdown has ended. Sen. Schumer’s ill-conceived attempt to leverage vital funding for active duty military personnel, needy children, seniors and flood victims to protect illegal immigrants failed miserably with the renewal of the CR passed today in the House and Senate.

With smaller staffs &amp; less resources than large financial institutions, local institutions are unable to bear the regulatory burden that my bill would roll back. These regulations have driven local institutions out of the mortgage lending market, hurting our local communities.
The Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act will alleviate harmful burdens that drive our small community institutions out of the mortgage lending market. It will also roll back regulations that have doubled the cost of servicing loans for low-income borrowers.

Nearly all regulatory agencies operate under a multi-member board or bipartisan commissions to ensure checks and balances are in place. The CFPB does not. This is a new opportunity to ensure that the CFPB is subject to rules that all other federal agencies comply with.
The D.C. Court of Appeals declared the CFPB's  structure unconstitutional, as the unelected director “enjoys more unilateral authority than any other officer in any of the three branches of government of the U.S. Government, other than the President.” https://t.co/kvZ33oynIu
The CFPB is tasked with the important mission of safeguarding consumers, but the unconstitutionally structured agency has been riddled with rampant abuses of power, unaccountable spending and a severe lack of oversight. 	https://t.co/jBh4GBkoog

The SALT compromise reached in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permits individuals to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes.  In #NY22, 99 percent of itemizers deduct less than  $10,000 in property taxes. This provision will cover nearly all property  owners. https://t.co/FQiVEh5suU
The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct preserves the SALT deduction for property taxes up to $10,000. In #NY22,  99% of itemizers deduct less than $10,000 in property taxes. This provision will cover nearly all property owners.
I advocated so strongly for the SALT deduction because it shields NYers from the oppressive burden Albany places on taxpayers. Albany politicians have ZERO respect for the taxpayers. Governor Cuomo and Assembly liberals continue to increase our bloated budget while hiking taxes.
H.R. 1 reduces the number of brackets and lowers tax rates in each, except for the rate on the highest income earners, which remains unchanged. All Americans deserve to keep more of what they earn and this bill will put more money in back in the paychecks of hardworking NYers.
While H.R. 1 is not perfect in its current form and there are changes I will continue to advocate for, especially on the SALT front, I strongly believe that passing this bill is a critical step forward to ensure our tax codes reflects the values of fairness and hard work. #NY22
Our current tax code is broken. It’s riddled with loopholes and kickbacks that penalize success and hurt hardworking taxpayers. Reforming our tax code will create a healthy economy and put more money back in the wallets of hardworking families.

Throughout negotiations, I'll continue to fight alongside NY colleagues to ensure this vitally important relief mechanism is in final bill
Until NY completely overhauls its tax code, removing this provision will strip primarily middle &amp; low-income NYers of only real tax relief.
Eliminating federal deduction for state &amp; local taxes will unfairly burden over 3 mil hardworking taxpayers in NY who claim the deduction.
Taxpayers and small business owners need a level playing field. Creating a fairer, simpler tax code will help ensure this is the case.

Sherrill’s supply chain extends throughout the country, touching nearly 100 companies in more than five states.
It will create new opportunities for domestic manufacturers to compete in a rebounding industry.
This amendment would benefit a range of US companies that feed into Sherrill’s supply chain, including American steel companies.
3/3 DOD retains the ability to waive sourcing requirement if, for any reason, domestic flatware could not be procured at market prices.
2/3 so long as doing so does not raise the costs of business or unnecessarily burden government operations.
