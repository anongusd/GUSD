California has 53 House seats and 2 Senators in 2019... 		- GOP only has 7 federal elected officials 	- GOP holds no state wide offices 	- GOP only holds 39/120 State House/Senate seats	- GOP lost LA County Sheriff office for first time since 1880
many US Attorneys have political careers beyond this office... serving in Congress as Governors and appointed as judges to federal benches by.... PRESIDENTS seeking to administer a political agenda through the courts
That is not to say these are not honest, patriots doing good work on behalf of the public, they absolutely are all of those things... but they do so within the apparatus of the political operations to which they serve under
US Attorney's are extension of the AG and DOJ to which to the administration they serve under... with maybe the exception of Southern District of NY which seems an entity unto itself
probably not but this is small potatoes honestly... we should all dispense with the notion that US Attorneys are not political operators https://t.co/6ydlUFJEue
