@KayaJones Legislation determining one cannot remove fetus cells sets precedence of cells being protected life. Cancer will then also be protected. #Science is a fickle bitch. Also, millions of cancer operations &amp; surgeries are arguably pro abortion precedence. 	#Kavanotgonnabeanyhelp

@TWVlive @KyleKashuv @chrisburnwash That is not at all accurate. There was no assumption or preconceived notion. I visited your profile and your stance was crystal clear.

@PandActivist @demonicalien666 @jAaronA @LumpyLouish @ActifyCHAT @RepMaxineWaters It's not policy enforced segregation, but her words are the encouragement of seperation of specific groups from accommodations and services. I don't know for sure but it could even go against the civil Rights act.
@PandActivist @demonicalien666 @jAaronA @LumpyLouish @ActifyCHAT @RepMaxineWaters Mostly Trump, But also RepMaxineWaters. I just don't think doing what you're protesting against is the best way to beat what your protesting. The group being the trump administration and the segregation being denying them accommodation and service.
@demonicalien666 @jAaronA @LumpyLouish @PandActivist @ActifyCHAT @RepMaxineWaters I didn't say don't protest. By all means do so. Just don't call segregation protesting. To many civil rights activists fought far to long and hard for that history to be repeated against any group of people. Even the ones WE dislike.
@demonicalien666 @jAaronA @LumpyLouish @PandActivist @ActifyCHAT @RepMaxineWaters Dont conflate yourself with them. ♥️ It's not about what you or any specific people are, it's about open accomodations and market equality.

@IamAnuNaik The left is to fired up to quit! And the way I see it is that if we don't show appreciation in victory the other side will say we're perpetually biased. I don't want to give them a single advantage.

@ComposMentisish @thecjpearson Interesting perspective. I will think on your points, and I hope you will do the same with mine. ☺️
@ComposMentisish @thecjpearson When you use it as a weapon to discriminate, that through action is saying it is right. But nobody can say the bible as whole is right, so one small bit of something which is unacceptable in entirety shouldn't be used as a weapon. Anyone can find words in it to justify anything.
@HadItWitYou @JohnESparks1 @thecjpearson Condemning me for generalizing one group on a tweet that generalized one group.
@ComposMentisish @thecjpearson So it's okay to condemn so much of the Bible, then weaponize other verses? It's assinine to say that all those other verses are irrelevant but marriage as defined by the bible matters. Own all of it or acknowledge that everything in that book isn't right.
@madamB5 @thecjpearson I'm confused as to what you're talking about. That is not what I was referring to.
@Slumpbuster4 @Katiemadonna1 @thecjpearson Let's get one thing straight. I'm not his majesty Donald trump.
@JimmyJaabroni @thecjpearson @KyleKashuv On issues of equality for all sure thing. On firearms, nah, not my battle. I see good arguments on both sides
@JohnESparks1 @thecjpearson Nahhhh, although CJ is not always factually accurate it is great to see youth politically engaged. Old people rely on attack politics, young activists can have a conversation without insulting each other.
@ComposMentisish @thecjpearson Remember when the Bible was justification for 	slavery	women submitting to their husbands	Cannibalism	Eating the flesh of one's offspring Countless massacres		But #LGBT people... Can't be having that.... 💔 Let's just Jim crow it up against them and condemn the other bible stuff.
@thecjpearson And I hope he sees my point, because if he does care about the injustices of the past he should be the champion for ensuring that that history doesn't repeat itself against a different group of people. Because today, that is likely depending on which Republicans you support.
@thecjpearson But you wouldn't debate me, because you'd get crushed.
@thecjpearson To use past racism, which can easily be found in both parties, as justification for supporting a party that is enacting Jim crow like laws against a different group of people today, is childish and morally reprehensible.
@thecjpearson CJ if you actually cared about equality you wouldn't support GOPs whom are anti equality. Trump supporting the baker is a perfect example. Go ahead, be the same as the oppressors that you label democrats as. You're actions will hurt millions of people.

@landlineben Trump also said he was pro #LGBT, which we haven't seen proof of. But that aside, you can support trump, and not vote for extemist Republicans during midterms. Vote for a third party candidate to say this is not what conservatives believe.
@Audial__ He said some ignorant shit	To try to be relevant. But he wack, so women won't Mack. because they know oppression, so they choose guys with a real message a blessing is what gay people are, even the pope knows that's why he's reaching for the stars. https://t.co/RKh4GVt7kD

@RDevole Leviticus 26:29	Deuteronomy 28:53-57	Samuel 15:3	Psalm 137	Ephesians 5:22	Peter 2:18		Will you say thes scripture references are wrong but condemning gay marriage isn't? Because using some Bible verses as a political weapon, while condemning others, is itself an injustice.

@JohnSmi19009663 GOP: uses democrats past racism-which can easily be found in both parties-as a political weapon to try to manipulate black voters into voting for the oppressors of the next generation of oppressed people.
@RDevole Im straight and support #equalityforall. In the past people used religion to justify slavery, Jim Crow, and countless other injustices. Bible talks about cannibalism, killing babies, &amp; more. So saying those words R wrong &amp; not saying gay marriage is ok is selective &amp; hipocritical
@RDevole Sure, here is one of many modern day Jim Crow laws proposed by Republicans. https://t.co/qTHfF7KCMP
@RDevole You have it wrong, it's blame the GOP for trying to recreate the segregation laws which caused black people so much pain. (Against #LGBT, single mothers, people who have pre-marital sex) And their attempts to get them to vote for people who support modern day jim crow laws
@Xehnas I don't give people permission to vote. I simply talk about black history, which is American history, and compare past injustices to what Republicans want to make legal today.
@IXFLAVORS Duh, proud independent Libtard, with some pre-trump conservative views. But it is true. Why would they enable the very treatment which has caused so much pain for black Americans onto others? That's counterintuitive.
@Fishrocks1 @Twitter You think I'm wrong? Voice your opinion.
@HopieChangey I know... 😿
If they truly cared about the values people like MLK fought for, they would not enable the GOP, whom wants to treat single mothers, people who have pre-marital sex, and #LGBT the same. It's quiet possible we will see, "NO LGBT" or "NO SINGLE MOTHERS" signs very soon.
It's utterly mind boggling that Republicans convince black people to vote for segregationists whom want to enact Jim crow laws against #LGBT. All by saying if you vote Democrat your on some metaphorical plantation. It's easy to see that the master in this narrative is the GOP. 🙄

@CindyProUSA @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump Maybe if you read it you'd see that it shows one of two outcomes, either you're a bot, or you share the same propaganda that IRA, propaganda, etc. accounts share. Saying not to be rude is a polite way of saying maybe you just need to check your sources.
@ananavarro Do you think that the GOP is now so alt-right, that a large portion of Republicans—like yourself—actually have more in common with the democrats?
@CindyProUSA @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump Are you a bot? OR more likely do you just like propaganda? I'm not trying to be rude, I just used an unbiased external app to check if your account displays patterns consistent with IRA, propaganda, and other (R) and (D) bots. So perhaps start checking your sources. https://t.co/m7ZMc6tVDW
@randy_tull @Sandrae38972624 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump @GOP Theodore Roosevelt holds that it is unpatriotic, servile, and morally treasonable to proclaim that there must be no criticism of the President.

@randy_tull @Sandrae38972624 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump @GOP So let me get this straight, I come to oppressed women's defense and I'm the shit guy... I'm proud someone who would be triggered by such noble acts would think I'm a shit guy. 😉 https://t.co/hz2TE0XYIs
@thesonx @LisaMarieBoothe @PressSec Lisa is right, Sara handled it very well. However Nick, you need to get the facts straight. The GOP struck first with constant injustices to brown people, gay people, poor people, and more. So its liberals who are "swinging back." in a much more graceful way than conservatives do
@terieraftery @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump @GOPChairwoman So opposing the @GOPChairwoman for not working to find a decent candidate is wrong? She could have spent just a little effort to find a reasonable conservative candidate. Her inaction gave a Nazi a platform. If that makes me an imbecile then so be it.
RT @TheTaylorRichey: @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump Not nearly as low as Trump endorsing Roy Moore.
@lucyhusum222 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump It takes less than a second for a high powered computing machine to compare all the known accounts of the IRA (Internet Research Agency, propaganda accounts, etc. to every tweet you've posted or shared) then conclusively prove that your account has the same patterns.
@lucyhusum222 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump I shared the results of an unbiased external application. It flags democrat and GOP propaganda sharers &amp; bots. I said you were either a bot, or your account has patterns of sharing propaganda. I didn't call you anything, I pointed to 2 outcomes, one of which is factually accurate
@foghat74 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump Okay foghat. 🤣 https://t.co/GsqweMd4t3
@Sandrae38972624 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump It's horrible. There are thousands of cases of mothers who are single mothers because of some piece of shit guy. The system already goes after the fathers with child support, etc. so this is truly another example of the @GOP trying to hold women hostage to their beliefs.
@foghat74 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump  https://t.co/wl22UTeMHD
@RussEllis33 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump It was the context. I did however think @ingrahamAngle's apology was genuine. I didn't think she deserved to lose her job or get boycotted. Everyone makes mistakes, but very few people own them. So although I don't think her saying low-blow is compelling, I do respect her.
@Realdonaldtrump resorts to impeachment baiting @GOP voters. The democrats will only impeach Trump if there is a lawful reason to impeach him. https://t.co/6TtCG653Cb
@lucyhusum222 @IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump Either you're a bot, or you have a pattern of sharing propaganda. It's okay if you're not a bot, millions of GOPers got duped in 2016. So don't feel bad. Just please in the future, check your sources. https://t.co/swtYs1f7Pj

Candidate Trump said, “Deals like this destroy democracy.” referring to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner &amp; Comcast-NBC mergers.		Now as president his administration will likely stand by as Sprint and T-Mobile merge. He promised to drain the swamp but he's actually making it bigger.
The people who are mad about Michelle Wolf's roast of Sarah Huckabee Sanders are the same people who attack others daily. They're the same people who cheer when Trump comes up with horrible names for democrats, races, and reporters.		We see you for what you are, hypocrites. #WHCD

A great cure for election meddling, would be unblock-able auditor accounts. Said auditors using #AI &amp; #MachineLearning to spot then auto-notify when people share propaganda. Additionally that system could have a public facing scoring system that shows ones information accuracy.
@RoKhanna Hey @RoKhanna, while we're talking tech.... Propaganda bots often switch usernames. This makes tracking them much more difficult. It's time for lawmakers to create legislation requiring public facing unchangeable "IP" comparable addresses linked to every social media account.
@PatLoep @MayorLevine @FLGovScott @SenBillNelson @marcorubio @tweeter @jack @lsarsour @JoyAnnReid @HillaryClinton @NancyPelosi @SenSanders You retweet other accounts that are known to spread propaganda.

BTW if you want proof the tracker is unbiased, it tracks democrat bots as well!

@dorianbanks @SethAbramson Tweeting in sequences is very intelligent. You ended up seeing the last tweet in the sequence, and the rest!
@SethAbramson 12/17/15: Putin praises Trump as "absolute leader of the pres. race." In response, Trump says "great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond."		Then @ time you're looking @ its "Clintons Russia"	https://t.co/CvH1sQNxyp …
@SethAbramson @Sethabramson maybe look into Giuliani @ that time. 10/25/16 he said. “I call them surprises in the way we’re going to campaign, to get our message out there – maybe in a little bit of a different way. You’ll see and I think it’ll be enormously effective. https://t.co/wbrnoltLdt

@Joshnewcomb4 @iMaGiNeprints @KyleKashuv @davidhogg That's not because they can't speak freely, they can, there are just consequences.

@papapolitics @SenMikeLee Same, extremism = bad. And I know I seemed like an ass but I just want people to see that patronizing all muslims for the behavior of a few is counterintutive. Especially on a day that is meant to show the best of their culture. I'm a huge supporter of Freedom of any/no religion.
@papapolitics @SenMikeLee No argument for your valid point. But I do wonder how far we'd have to go back to find examples of similar discrimination in the USA. (Not as extreme but still sad behavior.) But anyways, if women, blacks, etc. can bring about change here, I believe their culture can too.
@papapolitics I'd like to see a source for those stats. But interesting argument.
@papapolitics GOP @SenMikeLee is an extremist because he advocated 4 legislation that allows people to legally discriminate against people they deem immoral. Christians tend to be political extremists rather than violent. But i can source violent examples if u want. https://t.co/6jAlVswEZb https://t.co/xfG2Xi9fR8
@papapolitics You have 16 grandchildren. That event was in your lifetime! Christianity has undergone a reformation that I think is amazing. But just like what's left of the extremist Christian ideology shouldn't define modern Christians, the radical muslims shouldn't define 1.6 billion people.
@papapolitics Or you just missed the point, there are extremists in every religion and those few extremists shouldn't be what defines the religion. But you're wrong because around 2 decades ago Christians extremists played a role in killing 500,000-1 million people. https://t.co/1B2eQG3vzi
@shimon_kach @clubodaddy @AmyMek I don't doubt that the information in that video was a part of it, but I used a scholarly source.
@clubodaddy @shimon_kach @AmyMek Source was the Chrisitan Bilingual University of Congo.
@shimon_kach @clubodaddy @AmyMek Did you read the article? Opposing religions were fighting for democratic reform and separation of church and state. The churches then found a way to re-assert Christian politicians. Then after killings Churches didn't condemn the genocide and pointed out people to be killed.
@shimon_kach @clubodaddy @AmyMek Just over 2 decades ago there were Christians that assisted in the massacre of 500,000-1million people. An initiative started decades earlier by injecting Christianity into Rwandan society. Point taken but if Christianity can change, so can Islam. https://t.co/1B2eQG3vzi https://t.co/2nEprMzJEN
@clubodaddy @AmyMek The bible is still a crutch for discrimination just like the Quran. I've never read the Quran but both faiths use miniscule amounts of the entire books to justify injustices.
@MCL1381Bones @AmyMek I've never read it. So not a few lines literally. My point was small percentages of things in the entire book. Just like Christians use a few lines which say "Marriage is between a man and woman" to discriminate against LGBT. Both are extremely miniscule percentages of the books.
@nonye_Solomon @WhiddenJason @AmyMek I get that, but like Christians have undergone reformation over the last 50 yrs, so have a majority of Muslims. My tweet summarize my opinion on political discrimination but you could parallel it to everyday people of faith being the issue when beliefs cause their discrimination. https://t.co/1RxNurS3ky
@lyan118 I don't believe in the condemning of Christians for the behavior of a very small percentage of Christians just like I don't believe in the condemning of Muslims for the actions of an extremely small percentage of Muslims. Every religion has its extremists, that was my point.

@TamirHitman @AmyMek According to the UN, 247,000 Syrians were displaced to the border area between December 15, 2017 and January 15, 2018. $ to relocate a ME refugee to US 4 1st 5 yrs is $64,370. 247k x 64370 = est.16 bil $. That could buy a lot of permanent infrastructure &amp; long-term security.
@TamirHitman @AmyMek Maybe Saudi Arabia's approach was a good approach. Perhaps global aid and creating military protected "safe zones" in said regions would help the people/and thwart future radical growth. + If women/LGBT Muslims leave, the terrorists can't birth another generation of extremists.
@TamirHitman @AmyMek The world should unite behind Muslim countries which are fighting for Islamic reformation. They're the people that are fighting for change, it's abhorrent and counterintuitive to broadly label even those change hungry people the same as the ones they're bravely fighting against.
@g_money1216 @WhiddenJason @AmyMek Lol no worries! My typo was funny as well! 😂🤣😝😜 Btw may not seem like it, but I'm a huge supporter of freedom of religion, or no religion.

@WhiddenJason @AmyMek ****Not attacking them for a very small percentage of bad actors
@g_money1216 @WhiddenJason @AmyMek If a faith that killed millions of people can have a massive reformation, so can another. Great points!
@TamirHitman @AmyMek Fair point for specific countries. But a lot of Muslim countries are against terrorism. Example of 5 of the wealthiest Muslim nations rejecting Syrian Refugees because of terrorism. So a few nations terrorism is an excuse to condemn 1.6 billion people? https://t.co/gaiYwYJ0xX
@TamirHitman @AmyMek So if Christians are barely past committing injustices &amp; Christianity is a little more moderate, why don't people think Islam can overcome committing such injustices? Especially since a lot of Islam dominated countries aren't even to the point where we were post-Christian-change.

@WhiddenJason @AmyMek Most of Islam doesn't refuse to move on. That's like saying christians should be punished because a small group still terrorizes #LGBT, unmarried mothers, etc? No. People should be encouraging those who've moved on, not patronizing them for a few bad and re-radicalizing them.
@TamirHitman @AmyMek Here is a rather unbiased article that did a great job of laying out the facts. Its not confirmed or denyed if he did it because of his christian beliefs, but he certainly has a long history of participating in christian activities. https://t.co/JtTwBfYFhg
#Data experts: If you value #EqualityForAll, do a study of hashtag #MuslimWomensDay. It is all the proof one needs to show that bountifully there are christian extremists in the United States. (There are also a lot of great christians and my intent is not to single anyone out.)
@AmyMek Reminder: Freedom of religion only applies if to christian. 	Reminder: A few islam believers used a few lines in the Quoran for terrorism. Coincidentially millions of christians use a few lines in the bible to TERRORIZE #LGBT and as their excuse to massacre people for centuries.

A republican starts the "Repeal the Second Amendment Trend." Liberals then defend the second amendment by saying it doesn't need to be repealed to bring about change. Even after liberals defend the #2A GOP constituents spin to infinity and say liberals trended it. #FakeNews

Over a 7 year period, there were 507 false report convictions by police officers. Trump's death penalty for opioids will no doubt result in the execution of innocent people. 127 police officer profit-motivated crimes in FL 2005-2013 		Search Database: https://t.co/fx8pBtj4CL https://t.co/9N1j49KbUq
Police officers are arrested about 1,100 times a year. Around half of 13,623 charges from 2005 through 2012 were incidents of violence. I speculate that Trumps death penalty for opiates will result in the death of innocents at the hands of dirty cops.

@BNBuzz_Ebooks @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems Telecommunications NN has been an issue since the 70s. Their hone lines used vocoders to code speech transmissions. The code was then sent over cables.

@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM Gov. wouldn't be the provider of internet, they should just own the infrastructure said companies use to deliver services. ISP internet plans already have data caps. That means its the users, not internet companies, who are determining the amount of BW used.
@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM It was just a case I built up to sue ISPs for future code blocking post NN.
@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM It should have always been government infrastructure, Paid for by US taxpayers. In today's society internet is as critical as the roads our cars drive on. ISPs are well off and can pivot elsewhere. Generations of innovation depend on those cables, generations can buy them out!
@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM Bits sent from consumer technology to third-party intermediaries translated to English are used time and time again as evidence. I challenge anyone to find one case where intermediary bits haven't been treated as speech. There are so many prosecutions on bits. + Bernstein Vs. DOJ
@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM The internet is a free market. The users of the internet should be regulated by governments, not companies. So yes, Comcast should have little if any say. It should be an end to end open data pipeline.
@QDecoder @comcast @GOP @IBM I definitely see your logic. The abuses, however, did continue. Here is another thread I wrote about my argument for "Code is Speech." It also talks a little bit about an incident between Google and Verizon. https://t.co/fO2UqnON7y

@Brien_Lundin @DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC If more regulation has prevented abuses why would less regulation be better? I don't know enough about the healthcare issue to have a position. I've also enjoyed the conversation and hearing your opposing perspectives.
@DonMiguel33 @Brien_Lundin @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC I'm not anti-competition.

@Brien_Lundin @DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC I love free markets but we're talking a free market that is a foundational part of another free market. It needs regulation. History shows us that the layer one free market will filter/block/throttle layer 2 free market.
@DonMiguel33 @Brien_Lundin @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC There are arguments on both sides. Presenting them all is the best way to find sound middle ground.

@DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC Personally, I think what thwarts small ISP growth is the large barrier to entry, needed technical intelligence to understand the business, and the vast pool of engineers needed. Not regulation. The regulation is for protection for consumers, start-ups, and big business.
@StrictlyNooz @DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC I made my "choice" to be publicly indexed. Everyone has a choice. NN lets us choose.

@DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC @google has reason to support #NetNeutrality  		Verizon blocked Google emerging technology.		All so they could promote their technology instead. 		#BigBusiness Needs #OneMoreVote too!
@DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC The FTC is a potential alternative. But there is much doubt about whether or not they will be able to bring lawsuits against ISPs. There is no point in having a regulator who can't do anything about abuses.
@Ornery_Opinions @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems https://t.co/TJ0Zabc3yJ #NetNeutrality  has been an issue for decades. Please don't make this a partisan issue. GOP is huge on national security, do you not find it uncomfortable that ISPs have historically hacked Americans?
@DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems @FCC As an expert, you know that technical loopholes take long periods of time to uncover. FCC already has experience and knows ISPs prerogative. If someone new comes in it may take years to grasp the scope of the issues. Untested overseer of historically malicious ISPS is a bad idea.
@DonMiguel33 @JoeTalkShow @SenateDems As history goes on the @FCC has gotten better at stopping them. It was a deeply technical topic that the ISPs lied to cover up. I believe if the FCC is going to be involved in Blockchain/crypto regulation, they should also be involved in ISP regulation.

@HalenIV @comcast @GOP Comcast is one of several ISPs who have a history of covertly hacking their customers.

@JoeTalkShow @SenateDems Wrote a 16 tweet thread on the technical process an ISP used to hack their own customers already. I'm woke. Is national security a big issue for you? Is it uncomfortable for you to know that US companies hack US people? Or is this just a stupid left issue? https://t.co/TIxhrrvfQG
@SoupOcean @SenateDems You're right, they don't drip it in one word at a time. They just do a quick TCP reset attack and altogether end the packet sequence - especially when it helps them thwart competitor growth or monopolize customers - but no big deal.
@JoeTalkShow @SenateDems Oh yea well, you're lying by calling them a liar! 😝 "big-regulation left" this and that, but reality is  #NetNeutrality has been an issue for decades. I'm a stupid millennial and even I know that. 🤣😂🤪https://t.co/TJ0Zabc3yJ #OneMoreVote is about protection for everyone.

@Limbaugh2016 I just started researching it recently because there is evidence that suggests that CU makes a case for companies against ISPs code blocking without #NetNeutrality. After deep diving, I'll either stick with #SaveCitizensUnited or not. I need to finish my research before deciding.

@Limbaugh2016 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @KeithOlbermann @GOP Regardless on the celebrities etc. censoring question I asked CU still protects company source code. Companies can prove in court that code is speech. Here's an example of how a citizen did it to protect his code. It should also apply to companies with CU. https://t.co/oug2xQY5n1
@Limbaugh2016 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton @KeithOlbermann @GOP The issues he addressed are very concerning. I do however think the argument is blaming all of citizens united for just the money trail. Don't kill all of citizens united - just kill the money trail aspect. Code, Celebrities, and small businesses should be protected by CU.
@Limbaugh2016 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton Why should celebrities who operate online as entities not be able to have free speech? Maybe we're both right in different aspects. I think in court code will hold up as speech so companies deserve free speech regarding code - so long as it's not malicious. Repeal and replace?

@douglaskarr @CNN @verizon @Google @Apple @BarackObama In this space, no regulation is the absolute worst for opportunity seekers. Innovators need #NetNeutrality. Emerging projects #UX can be mitigated by ISPs.  Historically companies did not let start-ups and competitors succeed when they could legally suppress or block them.
@douglaskarr @CNN @verizon @Google @Apple @BarackObama Has Congress signed into law the existence of every other formal language? what even determines a formal language? If its amount of people who use it then computer languages might just Klout all human languages. If its users then Latin is dead and still a language. Code is speech
@douglaskarr @CNN @verizon @Google @Apple @BarackObama It's easy to find long-term evidence of court consensus of bits being translated into English/etc. then treated as speech. Bits, again and again, are translated into languages, then used in court. They're often used as speech but also used in image/video form as evidence.
@douglaskarr @CNN @verizon @Google @Apple @BarackObama It happened in 2011. In that example, Verizon decided what third-party code consumers were allowed to run on independently owned tech. Citizens United in 07 established company free speech &amp; Bernstein v. DOJ established code is speech. Blocking rightful code is unconstitutional.
@dreamlinkedlife @Apple @CNN @verge @Google Perhaps if the Flash community had the opportunity they would have evolved with the tech trends.

In blocking the google pay wallet in 2011 @Verizon blocked @google's code. My evidence shows court consensus of codes and digitized evidence being treated as speech. 0s and 1s make up bytes and everything online. Code is speech. The tech world needs #NetNeutrality for protection. https://t.co/QqM6AnGFHW
The cases I presented as evidence are from 2012. If there are cases prior to 2007 Citizens United -- which also show consensus of digitized third party intermediary bits being translated into English as evidence -- then @Verizon infringed on @google's 1st amendemnt rights. https://t.co/VoQwayW5Iu
@Verizon blocked @Google wallet because of supposed specs not matching up. No #NetNeutrality in 2011 made them think they could decide what software our paid for tech was allowed to use. We need neutrality to stop monopolization and device hijacking. https://t.co/ssexnmbZ4P
#NetNeutrality Evidence 5: @cnn wrote that @Verizon blocked @google wallet so they could share their wallet instead. It also shares how @Apple blocked tech innovation pre @BarackObama NN era -- proving that if companies have that leverage they'll use it. https://t.co/hmhLbyNi8T https://t.co/vUxpoB7E3R
Since code is speech. Corporations who also have free speech because of Citizens United in 2007, can also freely speak bits. Websites are made of speech. Here is where it gets interesting. Pre #NetNeutrality era I found proof companies blocked others speech. Lets dig in
#BattleForTheNet Evidence case 4: Stein v. Dowling: @USMC sergeant Stein's #technology digitized his speech and sent it to @facebook for his profile. Those bits were then translated into English which were used as evidence in court. #Code is speech. 📢https://t.co/hP32YKiMgw

#SaveNetNeutrality Evidence case 2: Homeland Security v. Twitter: @DHSgov seized data that was digitized and sent to intermediary @Twitter. Twitter sued its an ongoing investigation. Regardless, It appears consumer's translated bits were treated as speech? https://t.co/V52Sybejhr
#NetNeutrality Evidence case 1: Bradley v. State: @Facebook evidence used to ID assailants and other witnesses. Its compelling because translated bits were used to ID people. It proves third party intermediary bits translated into media are used by courts. https://t.co/HFxgJkobcR
0s and 1s commonly create speech that courts use -- that means precedence is set. #Code is speech -- they're languages made of bits! Point being, ISPs shouldn't be allowed to deny computer speech from being seen by others. #NetNeutrality		Evidence in thread: https://t.co/oB9eJiQaIG

@1791L @netflix @YouTube @verizon @Google @Apple Why is it justifiable that @Verizon dictated who controlled our purchased technology? If the phone is leased its justifiable. However, most people independently own their cell phones. Therefore they have no right to dictate what internal processes we use. We need #NetNeutrality
@1791L @netflix @YouTube @verizon @Google @Apple It does suck that we hand it over to unelected officials. But Congress which we do elect oversees the @FCC. A robust system of checks and balances are in place. #NetNeutrality protects consumers and innovators. No regulation is a legal weapon for big business against start-ups.
@1791L @netflix @YouTube Here's an example that talks about how @Verizon blocks @google wallet so it can share its horribly named ISIS wallet instead. It also talks about how @Apple blocked tech innovation pre Obama NN Era. https://t.co/hmhLbyNi8T
Tweets are made of 0s and 1s. My words are translated to them then infrastructure sends them around &amp; translates again. Every human should have an open data pipeline to consume and speak computer or people languages. What 0s and 1s represent is often used in court. #NetNeutrality
@1791L @netflix @YouTube ISPs daily brag about how many times they've sped up #internet and #data to sell and compete. The underlying issue is the business advantages they get for not having #NetNeutrality It allows ISPs to legally monopolize niches, thwart competitors growth, and halt innovation.
@ScoobydaDog All he talks about is data. This is about business. The repeal of #netneutrality gives a legal advantage for massive corporations to cheat competitors of growth, and stop innovators from even starting. It's something that historically ISPs have used to monopolize niches.
@1791L ISPs have a pre-determined amount of data alloted to each consumer. If it was really about @netflix and @youtube they would just lower the amount of data in a plan or raise prices. Repeal created a legal advantage that ISPs historically used for monopolization. #NetNeutrality
@selwyncoy Search #NetNeutrality and find new people who share your beliefs. The fight is not even close to being over.
@ScoobydaDog I think if a republican created it he's be a supporter but he has perpetual #obamabias
@ScoobydaDog Clearly biased Obama hater. Slanders America's passionate youth. Is falsely stating information. He clearly doesn't understand it. If you're understanding is worse than his you guys both need to read up on the tech side of it. #NetNeutrality Please tag him in a reply.
@ScoobydaDog That's okay. It's great that you're politically engaged. I am very curious though since you understand it well, Why do you support #netneutrality repeal???????
@iamjackdunne Size of data is irrelevant. ISPs could just sell internet by the GB or have smaller packages. We need an open data faucet regardless of total used. Inflating monopolies competitive advantage that they've historically used to thwart competitors is what's wrong. #netneutrality
@SophieSays @TheDemCoalition
Allowing ISPs to create different internet packages is not a bad idea. What is bad is that a lack of #netneutrality creates an ecosystem that will breed #internet monopolies. It gives companies legal rights to manipulate users internet experience and thwart other business' growth
@iamjackdunne All data is equal because at the root its just 0s and 1s. How are providers to classify data and packets without destroying tech innovation? You'd need a team of tens of thousands of tech conscious auditors just to check what type of "data" websites classify as. #NetNeutrality
@iamjackdunne ISPs argument is that they can help more people get access. If that was actually the case they could just create smaller bandwidth packages with #NetNeutrality for people who use less data. It's the unfair advantage annulling lets companies legally take advantage of that is wrong
@mike_litherland @tedcruz You shouldn't make #NetNeutrality a partisan issue because a lot of @GOP are against it. It's offputting and damaging to your own efforts. Some less savvy GOP supporter will see it and because you made it us vs them they'll oppose it.
@iamjackdunne What's stopping it from growing with it? They can easily create smaller packages to curb barrier of entry for the poorer with #NetNeutrality in place. They don't need it. It's the protections Americans get that matter, not the innovation it hasn't thwarted for the opposition.
@iamjackdunne Video, queries, animation/image manipulation. There are infinite interoperable things that use a lot of bandwidth. They're cornerstone elements for most online businesses. That's why bandwidth is impossible to classify and regulate. It will crush innovation. #NetNeutrality
@iamjackdunne It also ensures that no companies can legally stack the deck for their company's companies. They have a past of internet manipulation. It's unfair to small journalists, web developers, businesses who will then have less people to show and impossible competition. #NetNeutrality
@iamjackdunne If that is your argument at the root its a war on video. The solution is simple. All they had to do was have smaller data cap plans. That protects other websites whom manipulate images, videos, animations, etc. by ensuring that their sites always function. So save #NetNeutrality
@iamjackdunne If ISPs already have a data cap for each customer pre-FCC #NetNeutrality vote that nearly nobody ever hit, then why does it matter. Its really about charging the people who are closer to the max data cap more. It's profits over people. It will kill youth innovation.
#NetNeutrality not in USA @Twitter trending shows just how big it really is. It's so relevant and large that its being treated like a @potus in US trends. When something is constantly trending and talked about its almost unnecessary to list because it's relevant without support.
Code is speech. 📢 It's text we write. ✍️ It should be protected by the 1st Amendment. Allowing ISPs to mitigate or block our ability to use our rightful speech that coincidentially does things should be unconstitutional. 🚫 #NetNeutrality needs to be fixed,🔨 NOT annulled. ❌

The saddest part for me about all of this, and it's painful for me to say this, is that this is the new norm at the FCC. A norm where the majority ignores the will of the people. -@MClyburnFCC 👇👇👇
2/3 of households in America have no other choice as to where they're going to get their internet. To go out and claim that this is somehow consumer protection is a fraudulent representation. -Tom Wheeler (Former FCC Chairman) #NetNeutrality
The internet service providers asked #AjitPai to make it so states couldn't create their own laws after he abolished #NetNeutrality Shortly after he actually did it. That level of #corruption is unprecedented. Call congress and urge them to sue the FCC.	https://t.co/XkMAAjDhmf
Economic growth, fighting unemployment, and technological innovation are all things that will suffer with the abolition of #netneutrality
There is credible evidence to suggest the abolition of #netneutrality in any country, the United States or otherwise, can and will most likely result in that country falling behind in terms of its competitiveness on the world stage. 🌎
@EdB2630 @AGSchneiderman @FCC Congress has direct supervision over the FCC. They can reverse the decision. Call your elected officials every single day. Don't let your voice go unheard. Find your elected officials phone numbers via: https://t.co/mL0QgoB3DR

@CStrait2 @AGPamBondi @FLGovScott
@Omi_082 In 1990 the Internet had existed for only 7 yrs; just 3 million people had access to it worldwide. Comparing the two is like comparing a caveman to an astronaut. I'm highly educated on computer science/information systems. In 1990s there was no need for Neutrality. Now there is.
It's a violation of our first amendment rights to allow a few companies to govern what we can view online. Our websites/profile load speeds could legally be slowed down AKA "censored" for any reason. That is oppressing our free speech. It's unconstitutional. #ReverseNetNeutrality
If you believe elite companies are politically biased then you should urge your lawmakers to reverse #NetNeutralty. Providers can now legally slow down load speeds of candidate's websites/profiles who don't support their agendas. #corruption

@ca5f4e73c9674ac @johnlimdimas I only recently started keeping track of Ethereum. Do you know if the other ETH derived projects in any way contribute to ETH's price? If thats a factor then maybe ETH &gt; ETC but if not then either one is amazing. 🔥

@KingDemic #Ethereurm is way better than #Bitcoin. Someday the markets will get over the gateway drug like "Bitcoin" boom and realize that there are other way better blockchains. In my opinion Ethereum has a high probability of growing bigger than bitcoin. #notadvice #ImnotaCFP

@Connect_CEO It could. They could get paid for accepting gold. Your into stocks? It has outperformed almost every major stock including dow
@Connect_CEO K-Exchanges are merchants that accept karatbars gold for product and service. Instead of paying like CC's. You get overrides
@Connect_CEO Maintaining value is free cash in this economy. Because savers are losers and so are most investors.
@Connect_CEO It's always been able to purchase about the same amount of thing regardless of the amount of currency it takes to acquire gold.
@Connect_CEO Dollars Purchasing power. 2013 - 5 cents 2015 - 2 cents 2016 - 1 cent. Gold doesn't really fluctuate. currency does.
@Connect_CEO Hedge acquired value vs investing. A hedge is sorta like a stop or a put it just prevents legal confiscation through inflation.
@Connect_CEO Let's say you had 200k in 1970. Somehow u turned it into a million. You broke even in purchasing power 500% inflation #hedge

@nicholashill My idea is to create a culture of people who are engaged in a new movement of money to periodically move currency #backtoUS
@nicholashill We will teach individuals how to hedge against inflation by holding hard assets. In my opinion the product is inevitably rise
@nicholashill Quantitative easing  worldwide people question currency, us as influencers and leaders leverage control of technology.
@nicholashill YOU GROWING will build and create growth for others. That's just how it works.But Only if  YOU believe and continue thejourney
@nicholashill  The government doesn't know what to do? Maybe if all the smart people get together we can come up with something?
@nicholashill Most things are currently not working and countries all over the world are pissed because of poor economic policies.
@nicholashill  Marketing with a 9 trillion dollar annual market creates a moment for the people worldwide and can shift currency tocountries
@nicholashill  We would create supply and demand on a global scale because people follow leaders. which could create rise in the markets
@nicholashill  Infrastructure can handle perpetual growth, 3 years they spent to build. Launched debt free in 72 countries in 2011 since120+
