@realDonaldTrump Well then..By your own words. Since The word gets out anyway . We don't need her. Besides she never answers the actual questions. Just tries spins it with more rhetoric.
@nytimes Just taking a guess... Kavanaugh was the first to sign on to this?.
One giant leap backwards for mankind!.
@Evan_Rosenfeld Sickening.
@realDonaldTrump Hire another poll hacker have you?
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Maga RIGHT LMAO!
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr There is no information on the Wall. He has not even presented a draft of what he will accept. He can't even decide if it's a Concrete wall 30 ft high. Or steel slat divers. Or another form of fencing. Don't need inside knowledge to figure that out. It's quite simple actually.
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr What comparison.  there's not even a  draft of this wall,fence, barrier  compare it to anything around the world. It's  unrealistic.
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr there's a long history to Israel and of the lands  surrounding it &amp; Who have claims in and to it.
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Berlin was an example of how not to do things
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr BTW This is The United States of America. Not Israel.
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Foolishness
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr Stopped those bombs well. Stop. We have barriers &amp; walls &amp; fencing. We have ports of entry. We need actual functioning infrastructure and staff and technology. There is No drafts, no blue prints, nothing on paper. No break down. 5.7 billion for an unrealistic idea
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump More lies coming out of the WH.
@realDonaldTrump Thanks for the heads up. I now know not to turn on the TV. Waste of time listening to you spew false information. And make a complete ass out of yourself!
@Praha62 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr China's wall didn't stop the Mongolians, and the Berlin Wall didn't stop defectors, one is a tourist trap the other was torn down...get real. Walls don't actually work. Certainly not stopping the tunnels, planes,boats,and over staying Visa's..

Eminent domain, ecological, geological, financial. And Mexico isn't won't pay for it. Did you know  tunnels go under walls, planes go over , cars go around
@jllgraham @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr No that's your logic. Screw mom save the baby. Screw the raped girl. Force her to give birth.
@jllgraham @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr What you want a medal for being born?. I have raised my own with out financial assistance. Big whoop. I also have adopted family members . My mother also fostered many children and teens.

@Lillianlm2 @VP @HowieCarrShow @POTUS What is the voted upon  House Bills to open the government at now.. 8?. How many has the Senate brought to the floor.? that would be 0. None . Not one, ziltch,zip, nada.
@Blizzingston @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you trying to bring in Beirut?.
@VP @HowieCarrShow @POTUS At this time the president has shutdown the government .also forcing people to work for no pay . No idea of when or if they will receive pay.   Do you really expect people should continue to be volunteers in your hostage situation?.
@thetriune1 @BreitbartNews @DonaldJTrumpJr it's been years of silence from the GOP on that subject. Those murders just don't fit into their political talking points ideals.

@realDonaldTrump Oh they're talking to  constituents  and  others.  While you're spewing out Twitter rants. And  Holding American taxpayers  hostage. Hiding in thier  house.
@realDonaldTrump You know what else would end the shutdown. @senatemajldr would take a vote on the bills sent by the house to open the government  and if  @realDonaldTrump would shut the hell up. And stop his tantrums. We have no patience left  for these hissy fits of @realDonaldTrump s.
@realDonaldTrump The damage done to our country from a badly broken president-, Deceit Crime and so much that is bad-is far greater than a a shutdown, which the Dems can easily easily fix as soon as they came back to Washington  with new articles of impeachment. Fixed it

@realDonaldTrump Yes, you're correct they could end all of this. One way is to pursue  your impeachment . Before you can do more harm than you already have done. It's going to take decades to straighten this Mess out
@realDonaldTrump Put out your"Plan".. what's that?. You don't actually have a plan?.
@realDonaldTrump You don't even have the beginning of a  draft plan.  Let's see you're researched and engineered blueprints for this wall. What is the Dimensions, materials, continued cost. Mapping, surveyed ? Eminent domain &amp; property releases?
@realDonaldTrump We have a Massive fraud  who is the cause of  multiplenational security concerns and creating a  national disaster &amp;  Crisis sitting in the White House .
@DeLoachJW @nytimes How would you know what Mueller is and isn't investigating. What he has passed or not on to other agencies for inquiry.besides the guilty pleas and indictments. Mueller hasn't even posted or released any findings. The Mueller probe also just received another 6 months to continue.
@nytimes @realDonaldTrump was bought and paid for by Russia a long long time ago. Russia found it's mark in Donald trump and Family.
@realDonaldTrump We don't negotiate with terrorists or Russian assets! . And Since you are holding hostages and being a Russian asset  under Russian control.under FBI investigation.  It would be against our laws.

@USDOL @BLS_gov NH min wage is $7.25 per hour.(gallon of milk in some places). People already work multiple jobs. Companies pay on lower scale &amp; don't hire FT-w/bene's (high labor for low pay=more profit.). then add in the Qualifications &amp; Higher Education costs to move up/keep up. or get in.
