@DrewMeseck It would be nice!
Call the governor, call your legislator, call your local Board of Elections. Every New Yorker deserves the right to cast their vote regardless of their location or circumstance. We need to have our voices heard.
Today, I checked my mailbox one last time. The Brooklyn Board of Elections had finally sent me something: an absentee ballot REQUEST form.
A number of other New Yorkers at my university will also not be voting in this upcoming primary election. They didn't receive their absentee ballots either.
I called the Brooklyn Board of Elections. I was told that I didn’t understand how the process worked -- I do. I was told that I didn’t complete the process correctly -- I did.
allowed to vote. 		I did not receive an absentee ballot. I could not vote in the mayoral election. I spent hours convincing my friends that their voices and their votes matter. Yet, mine did not.
This was not surprising. Last year, after interning with the League of Women Voters of NYC, a voting and civic engagement organization, I requested an absentee ballot three months early. This would have been my first election after I had turned 18 and was, therefore, legally
anyone who could help me. Swamped with nothing but answering machines and a complex web of transfers, I had yet to find an answer. I, a politically active New Yorker, will not be voting in the upcoming primary election.
After weeks of daily trips to the mailbox, I started to get worried.		I called the Brooklyn Board of Elections, the NYC Board of Elections, the NY Department of State, Senator Chuck Schumer’s Office, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s Office, among others, hoping to get a hold of
I am not voting in tomorrow’s primary election in New York. Here’s why:		I attend college in Washington, D.C., therefore I must vote via absentee ballot. I sent in my absentee ballot request weeks ago. The request was mailed to the Brooklyn Board of Elections.
