In raising revenue, tribes need authority to raise tax revenue free from state taxation to create  business and job incentives. #SOIN2015
dollars we spend on edu saves dollars in the generations to come. Stats show edu destroys poverty and drug and alcohol abuse. #SOIN2015
Enact legislation that supports Native language programs so education for our children is rooted in our history and culture. #SOIN2015

"Alaska’s new Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott not only embodies his Tlingit culture – but also that Native issues aren’t partisan issues"
Whether Keystone or energy, health, edu, privacy rights or immigration, too often policymakers fail to understand tribal perspectives
To sustain our progress, and build on it, we must rid ourselves of the old ways of thinking about our relationship. #SOIN2015
This isn’t a partisan issue,or political correctness. We’re not trying to make news or make noise. We’re trying to make progress. #SOIN2015
Since 1944, we stand for rights of Natives in every corner of our society, whether under the bright lights of the NFL or in SD voting booths
... mascots for a football business that doesn’t have a fraction of the resilience, pride, or strength of character of any tribal nation.
It’s long past time that Washingtonians begin to see their fellow Native citizens through the eyes of respect and not as mascots of a team
Ndns are honored as soldiers, teachers, students and first responders, CEOs, community leaders. There is no honor in the name of that team.

11th snag: Why do 2004 #s matter at all? Word is a slur and hurtful. Why is that ok w/ anyone? http://t.co/ilU7v1Whd8 @auwcl #NotYourMascot
10th snag: If we must do a poll, let's at least conduct a scientifically sound poll http://t.co/ilU7v1Whd8 @auwcl #ProudToBe #NotYourMascot
9th snag: Even if poll is right (it isn’t), why is it ok to offend 9% of any group? http://t.co/ilU7v1Whd8 @auwcl #ProudToBe #NotYourMascot
8th poll snag: Boring polls using iffy grammar should be regarded with suspicion. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #ProudToBe #NotYourMascot
7th snag: 2004- 0.04% of Native people asked. 2014- thousands have spoken out against the name. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #NotYourMascot
6th snag: Even if valid, social views change. See: polling on interracial marriage,1958-68. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #NotYourMascot
5th snag: Grammar matters.“...do you find that name offensive or doesn’t it bother you?” What? http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #NotYourMascot
4th snag: 2004 poll done via landlines when 53% of Native Americans didn’t have a landline. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #NotYourMascot
3rd snag: Self-IDing -Those IDing as Irish aren’t polled to speak for people born in Ireland. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #NotYourMascot
2nd poll snag: One poorly worded question doesn’t begin to address scope of issue. http://t.co/zww4xu9KxT @auwcl #ProudToBe #NotYourMascot
