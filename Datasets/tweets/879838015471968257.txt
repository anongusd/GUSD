Twitter is a narcissists haven	Every single one of us looking for validation from internet strangers because the ppl we know in the real world have no respect for us, I wonder why
@sirensaysnope control over ones life, well their digital life at least, as no one seems to actually have control of their real lives, as much as they like to believe they do, which probably explains why they spend so much time on twitter.  I know the feeling
@sirensaysnope looking for random strangers to tell you that you aren't fat, ugly, stupid or worthless.  Do you feel any of those words accurately describe you?	I'm curious because I see many ppl like you who like to talk about the ppl they block.  maybe it's because it gives a false sense of
@sirensaysnope or those who say things that bother you, that they will get blocked if they don't agree with you or say something that bothers you.  But I could be wrong.  	I know you can tweet what ever you want, but your looking for some kind of validation, every tweeter is.  Maybe your just
@sirensaysnope to tweet this, you wanted to, as it holds no significance to anyone but you	I've always been curious why ppl feel the need to boast about things like this.  There is clearly a response your looking for.  I would have to presume this is a warning to ppl who don't agree with you
@sirensaysnope Did you believe they were wrong or did you block them because you didn't like that they were vocal about their opinions or a little bit both?	why not just go about your day and not have to make a spectacle about it?  I say make a spectacle because I know you know you didn't need

what scares me most about humans.  How far are they willing to go to prove that they aren't as afraid as they really are?		I believe they are willing to send themselves to oblivion  just to prove a point that they know is wrong, just so they don't have to admit it out loud.  I
Pay a mortgage?  are you offended by ppl who do not?  Do you love looking at your bank account?  do you hate looking at your bank account?		humans are for the most part are quite predictable and will go to scary lengths just to prove that they are not afraid of change.  That's
because that would involve relinquishing control of their lives.  but here's the funny part, they never had control of their lives to begin with.  Have a job?  Have a spouse/partner?  Children?  do you believe that you need paper money to survive?  Do you pay bills?  Pay taxes?
that think like me because I don't like how ever other human thinks. They don't realize it, but they all think the same way.  They just use different words to say the exact same things.  They all say, "I'm afraid and I don't know what to do"		but they can't use those exact words
afraid of what other humans will think of them.  You can tell this by how often they repeat the falling words, "I don't care what ppl think", or some variant there of. 		I care what ppl think.  Because I'm trying to find other ppl that think like me.  I'm trying to find other ppl

@frmikeschmitz Why does that resonate?	Ignatius seems to be saying that titles are 2ndary, which I would argue that they are all together meaningless, but your tweet seems to be glorifying the titles you bestow on your self	do u believe you were not a "son of god" before being called christian?

@ReginaA1981 @thomaskaine5 Thats what I thought	We are talking black vs black, Latino vs latino, Asian vs asian, white vs white, right? 	Cause I see a lot of same race racism and it confuses me, especially the anti-white whites.  You would think the whites would love each other on both sides but there are

because everything happens, I'm just still trying to figure out what it is.

trying to talk to me"üòÜ .  Turns out that when you ask the universe questions, it will give you the answers.  Sometimes in subtle ways, and others it is like a hammer to the side of the face		Looking back I can laugh at all of the crazy experiences that occurred for me over the

life led to this moment.  and even further, every decision of every person I've ever encountered, and the decisions of those who came before me, has led to the same thing.  		But what would be the reason behind all of that?  Just so I could write a fb post that may or may not get

@detective26AD I like long titles, I think Its a great way to make a mark on the reader, and stand out more then shorter titles	One of my favorite books, by Phillip k dick, has the longest title I can think of, "Dr Bloodmoney, Or How We Got On After The Bomb"
Mental disorders are not really mental disorders
ppl all the time, like I am, it is difficult to get the crazy off of you.  They act of getting sane is actually really simple, maintaining it though is the really hard part.  and if you are sane please let me know, I really need to find one other sane person before I go bonkers
Someone who thinks like me.  Just like you think your sane.  Unless you don't think your sane, and if that's the case I  can help because I learned how to stop being crazy, even though I may appear that way from time to time.  but in my defense, when you are surrounded by crazy
else, but since I'm the only person  capable of admitting I had a problem behaving like I should have it further leads me to conclude that your all coo coo birds.  	That's not a bad thing per se, but I really hope to find a sane person eventually.  what's do I mean by sane?
perception is the reality of those who are perceiving it then why would I believe otherwise if I'm perceiving things the way that I do?  There would be no other reason for me to believe im wrong unless i was still not right in the head, but if I was I would still be like everyone
also have to assume that the Ppl I interact with think the same way that I did.  Not the exact same way, but similar enough that I notice.  and if they act in a similar way then what I did, isn't it safe to assume they feel the same way that I did about myself and my life? If
exterior and interior influences that caused me to behave the way that I did, or rather, not behave in the manner that I should have.		and if that's the case I think it's safe to assume that if I perceive aspects of my old behavior patterns in everyone I interact with then I
know that everything happens for a reason.  But that's my opinion, again based on my experience. I can prove that opinion though because I know that every cause has an effect and every effect has a cause.  And what would be causing ppl to be behaving like me?  The same or similar
I was hiding from my problems by not admitting that I had them.  But that's just me based on my personal experience in my life.  Is it a coincidence that most everyone I interact with behave exactly like I did?  I suppose  it could be but I don't believe in coincidences because i
why hold on?  Because I was afraid of change and instead of admitting that it was going to happen whether I liked it or not, I distracted myself		With what?  Lots of sfuff.  Tv, work, video games, booze, drugs, books, anything that made me not think anything involving real ppl.
I look at it like this, I used to be like everyone of the Ppl I know that I think are crazy, but looking back when I was like them now I can say that I had some serious fucking issues.  I hated my life, I hated my family, I hated everything I fought so hard to hold on to.  Then
consider a crazy person.   		But think of it like this, I'm only seen crazy to ppl of a certain perspective.  Ironically though, from my perspective I think most other, if not all other, ppl are crazy.  crazy to you may not be crazy to me and crazy to me may not be crazy to you.

@coleyworld but that's because the dog was sick and was suffering terribly.  I didn't cut the dogs throat and I didn't record myself doing it and if I did I wouldnt post it online.  It also didn't make me happy that I had to do it, but everything happens for a reason whether we understand it
@coleyworld don't have to say we are afraid	 so is it that you fear that your dog's throat could be cut or are you afraid to watch it because you might like it or just afraid to watch something die or maybe afraid of the person willing to kill something like that?		I had to kill a dog once,
@coleyworld Maybe the dog deserved it	Karma isn't just for ppl	Maybe in a past life that dog was a person who abused dogs	But that was very smart to set boundaries like you did		Heres just my quickly philosophy on hate.  We hate what we are afraid of and only say we hate something so we

@girlband777 there were so many misunderstandings piled on top of each other that when I was finally able to speak from my heart it was too late. 	But, you would be surprised how being vulnerable can also be misunderstood.  	It's almost like your damned if you do damned if you dont.	But if
@girlband777 a lot of it also has to do with an inability to be vulnerable. Thats what ultimately killed my marriage.  But it was hard.  I never learned how to be open with my emotions so when I finally needed to I couldn't or it came out the wrong way.  It came out like an attack.	In the end

I believe that to be above good and evil one must first recognize that they are the same thing.  To recognize that good, in the eyes of the evil doer, is evil, while the evil doer sees himself as good, and vice versa	what's good for you may be evil to someone else and what's good

ever going to be the "right" ppl they will figure out on their own when they want to be.  Or they wont.  	so you need to ask yourself this, how long is it worth waiting for someone who might not be the right person, because maybe your wrong about them.  I mean, you could be
that you are talking to exactly who you needed to talk to so that you could better understand who you don't want to talk to.	and who don't you want to talk to?  Ppl who don't appear to listen.  Make sense?	so say what you know you need to say and move on.  If the "wrong" ppl are
With all of that in mind, maybe it's not that no one is listening, maybe your not giving the right ppl the right amount of time to respond.  and if they don't respond, perhaps you were in fact telling the wrong ppl, but if everything happens for a reason it's safe to presume
to do because they didn't plan on that.  	so maybe they only appear to not be listening because they haven't had the time to process what you said and by the time they do, they lose the courage to say what they think you want to hear instead of telling you what you need to hear.
to say?  Maybe they wanted you to say the opposite of what you did.  Why would they want that?  Because that's what they planned for.  Why?  Because ppl think they can see the future and when you give them the opposite of what they want, aka "what they need", they don't know what
wouldn't they know how to respond?  Because they never heard someone say those things or maybe because they never expected someone to say exactly what you said.  	Or maybe they were just hoping you would have said what they wanted.  and if that's the case, what did they want you
experiences are not the same as yours were.	so it's safe to presume that no one else thinks like you.	so why do ppl not listen to you?  Maybe they don't know how to respond because they never expected anyone, you included, to say what you said and don't know how to respond.  why
for a reason then it's safe to presume that they needed to hear what you said.  But why?  Why would they need to hear what you said?	Because no one else is saying what you are.  But why is no one else saying what you are?  Because they never walked in your shoes so their
If no one is listening to you, maybe your talking to the wrong ppl, or maybe your saying the wrong words.  	So, what would be wrong with what your saying? That's a big question.  What is it that you said that's not getting the response you were expecting?  If everything happens

This is hard for a lot of ppl to admit	No one wants to think thay they are not happy with where they let their life go	It's ok though, your not the only one	I wasn't happy, I made a change	It's just a matter of asking yourself, how long until enough is enough,	üëásmart stuff https://t.co/vS5iZE7wYM

@Numerologynow I agree that most ppl don't understand knowledge		 "The more you know, the more you know you don't know" - Aristotle
@MindTendencies2 ourselves that is also shitty
@MindTendencies2 everything happens for a reason so if someone makes us feel shitty there is something shitty about ourselves that that person is bringing to the surface for us to see and releasethe	yes, someone who makes you feel shitty may be shitty, but we need to ask what it is about
@AppleFourU @MindTendencies2 You've been doing this for a while?
@GodfreyHarrison @CatholicPat I do, but I wasn't talking about Jesus specifically

@Carlosjesuslara Said perfectly
@Soulcsmcblue You are absolutley correct but I'm talking g about more then one at a time,as I believe that one can learn to be it
@tiakolbert @MindTendencies2 get there.  How do you know how you want to get there?  By allowing yourself to think about what you don't want.  My philosophy is this, how can you know exactly what you want, if you don't know what you don't?  But like I said, that's my philosophy, it's not for everyone
@tiakolbert @MindTendencies2 see if you were paying attention  e enough to ask, or it was just a coincidence, but I don't believe in coincidence because everything happens for a reason. 	does that make sense though.  We all have a destiny, but how we get there is up to us, as long as we now how we want to
@tiakolbert @MindTendencies2 reason, well a few reasons, but one in particular was so that someone paying attention would ask the question you asked so I could eirher say that I rushed my original response and forgot that point or that the universe wanted me to forget for the specific reason of testing to
@tiakolbert @MindTendencies2 for a reason.  Think of it like the endgame of existence, but only the end until the next new begining.  a constant looping customizable cycle of existence that is unique to the individual experiencing it.	so by that logic, from my perspective, it would appear I forgot that for a
@tiakolbert @MindTendencies2 I'm glad you asked, just as glad that I forgot that point	Thats where free will comes into play.  Think of your intention as your free will while the divine timing of the universe playing the role of destiny.  But what is destiny?  It's one of the reasons that everything happens

@MindSovereignty reason behind the reason why everything happens for a reason.
@MindSovereignty Everything happens for a reason	If would suggest a deeper understanding of the hermetic principles of you are already familiar.  Everyone's journey is unique, but a solid foundation in hermeticism makes understanding the why's much easier. Think of the hermetic principles as the
@MindSovereignty Memory is frequency, frequency is vibration, vibration is energy, energy doesn't die, but it does come in waves of intensity and balance.  	You have exactly what you need exactly when you need it.  If you don't remember something at a particular moment it's for a reason
For instance alot of ppl with the Christ title.  Th at would be something.  I wonder if they would all know it if only some did.  I wonder if they would be friends.
I come from a more gnostic approach of the concept of christ.  The title not the man.	But what if the man with the title had Twitter?	But if Christ had Twitter so would the antichrist, as i believe one man's Christ is another antichrist, but there's always a 3rd option somewhere
@Carlosjesuslara but that's my personal philosophy
@Carlosjesuslara the first place and they will never mean nothing because you don't want them to mean nothing.  but I don't believe in the concept of nothing, at least from a stand point that something can't come from nothing as nothing is the antithesis of existence and so nothing can't exist.
@Carlosjesuslara there,letting go I mean, and recently, my son and my wife and entire old life.	I always remind myself though that everything happens for a reason, even the Ppl we meet and interact with, as well as the feelings we feel for each other.	figure out the reason you were together in
@Carlosjesuslara that's a powerful and uplifting feeling to achieve.  But I do not believe it is possible for something to not exist if it has in the past. Energy never dies, it may weaken  but it never goes away for ever, or at least I can't prove is doesnt, but I could be wring	But I've been
@MindTendencies2 But ppl get addicted to the idea of someone loving them as a form of control over them.  Not many ppl are strong enough or willing to admit their addiction to that control.  I was one of those ppl for a long time.  It is a difficult trail to face
@Voronushka262 @CatholicPat @am_parra all things in the material realm are temporary, but that doesn't mean the spiritual contract is as easily broken, if it can be at all.  I have a few theories regarding that I am trying to prove
@CatholicPat to perform that ceremony.  But that's my opinion based on my understanding of the bible.  I don't practice Christianity as a religion but I very much like talking about it
@CatholicPat From what I have studied I interpreted marriage in the bible as a union of the masculine and feminine aspects of consciousness, in conjunction with the concept of Christ consciousness.  and I'm that respect I would consider it to the vocation in that is the vocation of scripture
@chuucoIato @MindTendencies2 But that's my opinion based on my own experiences with my own awakening.  Not everyone agrees with me
@chuucoIato @MindTendencies2 It means that you must accept that your timing is always going to be perfect.  Every failure is just as divinely timed as your successes to teach you to just know it will work better then how you can imagine, as long as you let it.  Too not get caught up in concepts like rushing
@Goddess_ov_Soul @MindTendencies2 Think of it as trying to rush something you need to achieve for conscious growth.  For instance forgiving someone, but you forgive the wrong one.	I consider that a shortcut because you can't forgive any one until you forgive your self first, and until you can do that, stagnation
@MindTendencies2 very interesting to observe, think about and interact with.  It's like having a backstage pass to the zoo
@MindTendencies2 accurate to say everything happens for multiple reasons, even the divine.  I think most ppl have a hard time taking all that in at times.  It's a very big concept to grasp when you try to wrap your mind around it and be consciously aware of it all the time.  But it makes life
@MindTendencies2 when you need it to teach you the lesson you need to learn to learn to better appreciate what you want when you finally get it, like all the other lessons we face.  I look at it almost like the reason everything happens for a reason, well one of them.  I suppose it's more
@MindTendencies2 Everything happens for a reasons, even stagnation.  There was a reason the hypothetical shortcut had to happen the way it did.  It was to teach a lesson in patience, but why?  To teach the individual that you don't get what you want when you want it, you get what you need exactly
@TheBourbonBomb_ @patnspankme Well I know everything happens for a reasons, so if you could prove me other wise that would definitely fuck me up
@Mrgoldenrod @patnspankme Do you talk like that because you don't have anyone of higher intellect to talk to or is ass slap talk a gimmick?

@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden hood.  I believe I can contribute a lot to the Christian faith, in an unconventional way, but that's because I was never one to conform, but not conforming doesn't not mean that I have nothing to learn.  I only made my communion as a child and wasn't involved in any religion
@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden best friends was a priest who got me acquainted with st Thomas aquinas and Albertus magnus.  I was very incredibly impressed with their open mindedness to accept as much as they did, especially Magnus's practice of alchemy	for a time I fought the idea of taking the path to priest
@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden for what I've been working on.  	I would really like to get some help finding some friends.  I am stuck in a very peculiar life situation.

@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden with learning to forgive. forgiving yourself for everything you ever did and haven't yet done.  to understand that everything happens for a reason.  what reason?  to figure out the reason. to wake up to who you are.  Each of us.  But I feel like my words are all the proof I need
@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden most ppl, because it involves forgiving yourself.  But if you know how to "see",  you can also translate it into other ideas, ways of thinking and and ways of living.  It's the holy grail, the cheat code to creating what ever life HE is inspiring you to have.  and it all starts
@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden Christianity and judaism to prove the existence of the concept of Christ consciousness, and that the new testament is the instruction manual to unlocking it, if you know how to see it, but it's a very easy thing to teach to an open mind because it involves unfamiliar concepts to
@jcbf19 @DrJoshMadden I personally don't care to use labels for myself but I've done some independent research on quite a few of the esoteric traditions.

@DrJoshMadden church wants us to conform. who in the church decided they interpret Christ better then christ?		and who's Christ the teacher?  All of us, if we know how to see and hear the clues that will lead us down the path.	Everything happens for a reason, there's a reason he wants us to
@DrJoshMadden spiritually find his way down the right path, unless that doesnt contradict the faith, but I'm not familiar with too many churches teaching that Christ was a teacher not a god.  and maybe that's the problem, because Christ the teacher wasnt teaching anyone to conform but the
@DrJoshMadden Why can't it just be that if a interpretation makes sense, it's true	Everyone is going to interpret it different, why must we all conform?	For instance I don't interpret Christ healing the cripple to mean he literally made a broken man walk.  I believe he taught a man who is lost
@taylorburrowes made sense
@taylorburrowes thing happens for a reason, I think say that a lot too,but it's for a reason, including the things I think and say.  and as I've been trying to remind myself, there's always a reason for the reason, which I think relates back to what you are saying in less words lol	I think that

@taylorburrowes aspect of ourselves	My philosophy is this, we are here to fail, learn from our mistakes, and grow.  wash rinse repeat, until we reach what ever goal we are striving		for fun,  and this may stray from the point of relationships but it's relative, let's say that in a past life,
@taylorburrowes to a certain way of thinking, but I look at it a little bit like how we imagine the concept of karma.  There is a lesson that we are failing to learn and integrate into ourselves.  and until we learn the lesson we get trapped in that loop.  	But you can apply that logic to any

@FrGoyo I interpret this to mean that you are asking forgiveness from and forgiving yourself	Because I agree with you 100%
@YessicaArevalo8 @FrGoyo It's not about them forgiving you	It's about asking yourself for forgiveness from yourself	If everything happens for a reason, there's a reason for what you did, not just the conscious one	The reason behind the reason, if you will	what did you need to learn to become better

@ImprintedENERGY it's a lot easier to train a hand full of monkeys to juggle bananas then a barrel o monkeys lol		As for the abortions, just because it's easy to kill babies doesn't mean it's ok.  I also believe in karma, so if you are kill babies for a bad reason, you are in trouble.  But if
@ImprintedENERGY respond the way I see in my head.  I can see a few different ways.  I can definitely see someone trying to challenge my knowledge on the number 7 again or someone saying I'm pro abortion, but I'm also in favor of nuclear war for the betterment of humanity.  My thought is this,
@ImprintedENERGY lots of reasons for a single event, and numerology can definitively prove that, especially on a 7 day. and don't forget, there's an infinite amount of reasons for one event. For instance, there's a few reasons I'm responding.  what's one reason?  I don't think your going to
@ImprintedENERGY an effect and every effect has a cause.  Everything happens for a reason.  you believe in the spiritual realm, so I believe it's safe to assume you believe in divine reason as well, or as I like to call it, the reason that everything happens for a reason.		But like I said, theres

@michaeldecon @AOC about her, I can figure out what ppl don't like about her.  then I can clone a better version of her, not her physically.  Think of it like reprogramming her best professional characteristics into another person.  But we need a man too.  who's your favorite man politician?  why
@michaeldecon @AOC But I was interested in what your answers to what my other questions were.  I asked for a reason.  I wanted to know what you thought.  I don't follow politics.  If I know what you like about her then I'll know what characteristics ppl like about her.  If I know what ppl like
@michaeldecon @AOC y would u think that?	do you think i was implying that about you?	I sensed you were going to	and ppl try to tell me I can't read minds lol.	Although, I was testing to see what you were going to respond to, my actual questions or the childish comment	Unfortunately I was right
@iwannabejessica @occupied_stall I don't think most men know how to	But I don't think women like vulnerability as much as they claim,but that's based from my experience	and if they do, it has to be a tailored form of vulnerability that they specifically want, not just any vulnerability, but that they don't say
@ImprintedENERGY @Simpatiko That's something a fraud would say
@ImprintedENERGY you clarify why those 4 beliefs are wrong for those of us at home that aren't as knowledgeable as you?  Or should we just assume you aren't lying to hide the fact that you are a closet fraud?
@ImprintedENERGY To me, a clear sign a numerologist is a fraud is when they call others frauds	Is there a particular fraud your trying to call out?  Or just that any numerologist that holds those very specific 4 beliefs is a fraud in your eyes and there for since Gary believes it, it is so?		Can

@lmwortho @RiderofWolves But I also talk to a lot of fuckheads, and you are correct, they deserve it too
@lmwortho @RiderofWolves so did I until I realized the reason I was calling ppl fuckhead was because I was judging them for behaving in a fuck head that was similar to my own.  and so calling them fuckhead was easier then saying it to myself, the one who deserved it	Now Im the only fuckhead I worry about

@LittleOleQui @Party_TypeChic how to find Christ is different for everyone, but here's one way not too, passive aggressively complian about Jesus's race	What color should Jesus be?  Why?  Is the problem that he's white and not black? Or that he's not another race?  asian? What race do you think he should be?
@LittleOleQui @Party_TypeChic It's supposed to be Jesus christ	But by your tone im presuming the fact that he's white is your issue	Look at it like this, no one named Jesus existed at the time some claim Jesus lived.  There was though a man called christ, but Christ is in everyone, if they know how to find it

@Maryamhasnaa a liar.  But I also recognize that all truths are half lies from a certain perspective so I can't holding against anyone because I've done the same thing
@Maryamhasnaa to all of our past and present lives.  We have been around liars for so long that it's actually embedded into our normal functioning behavior. Don't believe me?  How many ppl do you know that don't lie in someway shape or form?  My philosophy is simple, if you lie once, you are
@Maryamhasnaa trying not to be.  Why?  My theory is they love suffering.  Why?  suffering receives pitty and pitty is someone else's energy directed at your suffering.  Perhaps they feel that if they don't suffer they won't get the attention they want	But why lie?  Because we have been lied
@Maryamhasnaa basis.	When someone needs to tell me they don't like something, I take it as a sign that they actually love it but are too ashamed to admit it to them selves and those around them. they don't want to appear weak, not realizing that they are putting out exactly what they are
@Maryamhasnaa If everything happens for a reason what would be the reason someone focuses energy on something that they claim they dont like?	Could they be lying?  of course. Why assume they are lying though?  We lie to ourselves all day everyday, so of course we lie to others on a regular

@GentDominant @citygirlinky which is subjective to how each individuals wants for where and how they want to be living their own lives
@GentDominant @citygirlinky Sounds like someone who wants to control the thoughts of another individual	Are you looking for a mental slave?	I don't believe we get to possess anyone elses mind	But who am I to judge, I'm trying to brainwash the entire world so that I can live in a place I want to be living,
@girlband777 @AOC My personal opinion based off of my exp attempting to infiltrate the Catholic church is that you just need 1 person who knows the right words to say to make ppl listen. This is the tricky part though, because most ppl are liars,	But imagine a politician who tells the truth
@southerndivine I've thought this recently	Depends how much effort the other person puts out	My time and attention, like everyone elses, must be earned	But if I found a person that deserves my time as much as I deserved theirs, I would presume that they would want to work with me on social media
@RickRoss completely different from yours.	As for patience, I've yet to meet a human being that can actually understand the full concept of that word, but that's just based on my own experiences.  But who am I to say?  I fail my tests of patience more often then I can count
@RickRoss your "right" and your world isn't my world.	Great change to me is the death of the current societal structure and rebirth of a new order, one that is not as nice.  Nice coming from the Latin word nescius which means ignorant.	But again, my definition of great things are
@RickRoss I can relate, but I don't believe you fully grasp the extent of this statement	What do you consider "great things"?  I presume material wealth, but I could be wrong.	I consider a great thing as being something that changes the world in the right direction, but my "right" isn't
@girlband777 @AOC How many options do you have?
@AudreyKitching I say that because I see the fear in ppl around me, and I see their fears of me as well.  Perhaps their my own fears that I want to believe other fear of me, but I believe that everything happens for a reason	And I believe if they fear an aspect of my truth, there's a good reason
@AudreyKitching But if you fully embody your truth, does that not make you one with truth and at the same time feared by those who fear the truth?
@13astard speak also helps alot.  when you do that, you'll know exactly what to do next.  But that's based on my experience.
@13astard have the choice, it falls on us for not doing anything.	You want it to go away forever?  Allow your self to feel it.  let your mind take you where it's trying to and don't fight it.  It takes time and practice, but first you need a good cry.  Someone to actually listen and not
@13astard Their the same thing, by not allowing yourself to feel you suppress that emotion and it gets bottled up and it grows and festers deep down	But there's never not something you can do about it, you can fix it anytime you want, most of the time we choose not to.  But because we do

@rubirosajunior Better question	Have you ever looked in a mirror as realized that your not as attractive behind the mask?
@rubirosajunior Looking at pictures of your self is a good starting point, but the person you are in the mirror is the one with all the answers, but that's based off of my experience doing the same thing as you.
@rubirosajunior I believe I am pretty good at teaching this as it's what I do every day. With practice you can read anyone, including children.  and with enough practice, you won't even need to physically meet the person.  It's quite possible to read someone just by reading something they wrote
@Everythingissl1 @MindTendencies2 for you but may not be true to me and it's a lie to someone else.	any questions?	I don't know if I responded to what you were saying the way you wanted.  I may have misinterpreted something.
@Everythingissl1 @MindTendencies2 perceived them to do?	and if you can't relate like that, try what I do and ask questions.  Perhaps there's actually a good reason that they are judging, well a good reason from their perception, but perception is reality of those who are perceiving it.  Your perception is true
@Everythingissl1 @MindTendencies2 trying to think like this	Put yourself in their situation, which I would presume could be similar to your own at one point in your life or another.  How would you behave if you were them?  Would you do what you perceived them to do?  Have you done something similar to what you
@Everythingissl1 @MindTendencies2 In a sense, yes, it's all your perception as I believe there we are all the same could in different monkey suits, but I don't think that's what you meant.	why do you need to change your perception?  Do you find your self judging others often? 	If that's the case, I suggest this
@MindTendencies2 But I believe you know that those that we perceive as judging us are only judging themselves, just as we are judging ourselves by judging others for judging us, but I could be wrong.
@retrievethysoul I agree with this statement t 100% but there are boundaries that need to be set up.	But I think we're working on that right now

@taylorburrowes which reminds me of a very valuable lesson that obi wan taught luke in return of the Jedi right after Yoda became one with the force.  that all truths are half lies and all lies are half truths.  Whats true for me may not be true for you but there is a lesson to be learned for

@taylorburrowes At least that's the impression I got as they didn't want to talk to me after I made it clear I was not looking for sex.  But I also have a theory that women want sex more then men, while men just play the part to make women happy.  Just a theory though.
@taylorburrowes I notice that you didn't put anything about friends.  That is something I've been wondering about, men and women in a platonic relationship, but then again this is a society that is focused on sex and money	the few lady friends I've recently had were only looking for sex anyway

to others,but I believe that because I don't see anyone else really doing things the way that I do, or they aren't very good at it at least,but that's my opinion, good is subjective.  and I can say that the "good" stuff the universe tells me would be considered "bad" to everyone
that what's good for nature is good for mankind, and in a sense I would agree, but what I think is good for mankind and nature probably isn't the same as what everyone else is thinking.		But I think that's because I believe that the universe speaks to me differently then it does
called to do, just like everyone else.  Is that wrong?  Or are ppl under the preconceived notions that the universe only makes what they perceive to be "good" guys and gals?  however good is subjective.  		But I also believe that most monkeys, no offense inner, have this idea
embrace our calling and the universe called me to be what ppl perceive as a "dick".  But is a perceived "dick" the same as an actual "dick"?		 To some, that's for sure.  I get attacked and harassed all the time because of my perceived behavior, but I'm only doing what I've been

@taylorburrowes anything I put my mind to, including being my honest self in front of women, which is a major fear of mine.  But i make myself do what I'm afraid of to conquer the fear of doing a thing. 		I spend a lot of time on Twitter because I don't interact with many ppl outside my room,
@taylorburrowes traditions including qabala, hermeticism, gnosticism, with a focus on the study of occult symbolism, paganism, astrology, tarot and a sprinkle of gnosticism and assortment of other theologies, that have given me the inner strength to find the courage to tackle any fear and do

@taylorburrowes You personally I mean
@taylorburrowes What kind of things do you like to talk about
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen Not any creepier then lying to a girl about star wars	You claim to be able to recite the movie but failed at the one attempt you tried which was right before making that claim	I'd say your creep factor is a little bit ahead of me		I hope you learn to forgive yourself
@chickgonebad @ScarletMagdalen Poor auto correct	I'm using an amazon fire, all too broke
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen the universe told me to tell you to go back to the beginning of that conversation read it, you won't have to say it, but your forgiven
@ScarletMagdalen Have you never heard of inter racial racism?	and are you implying that only men can call other me  sexist, or are you like me and realize those guys are just phonies?
@ScarletMagdalen Are you a POC?	why would you assume a white woman can think for a POC	POC call other POC racist against POC all the time	Unless you think the POC who think that way are liars	Are you somehow trying to say that whites are the only race incapable of being racist against themselves?
@ScarletMagdalen @hfrank6048 That's impressive
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen I'm gonna need a little more then the word of a grill that may possibly be stalking me
@ScarletMagdalen @hfrank6048 You got a vid on that it should we just take your word?
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen I though so
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen Are you making a joke about rape?
@ScarletMagdalen @hfrank6048 and now your assuming my gender to others, which is rather insincere	and though I saw it as a challenge, you accepted it and continue to accept it.  and now have gotten other ppl involved	I think we make a good team
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen I do not believe that really happened	But that's just my opinion		I could be wrong but in don't remember obi wan saying that exact line.  Unless you were just making it up and putting quotes on it
@ScarletMagdalen @hfrank6048 I don't know what that means
@hfrank6048 @ScarletMagdalen and you is not you
@ScarletMagdalen "Yes Yes" what?	Your a stalker?	I do not eat paste, I have a feeling that is another thing we have in common.  	But I did have some pretzels and a sandwich
@pribyl_lukas @EsotericExposal aren't really in charge of their lives in regards to any scope of perspective.  	It's not as if wedding known how to fix things, we choose not to.  Like all aspects of real life, nothing lasts for ever
@pribyl_lukas @EsotericExposal Your only talking about humanities selfish love for itself	Nature, god/the universe isn't very forgiving for those that don't get their heads out of their proverbial asses and learn the lesson it's been trying to reach you.  	But that's just my opinion, mankind forgot that they
@ScarletMagdalen sure I got a few others already, it's a long story
@ScarletMagdalen I told you you were racist against white ppl, but your also a sexist	I never said that I was a white dude.Your not a good mind reader, I thought I said that	Unless your stalking me	Are you stalking me?	You don't have to	I'm dont judge	plus Stalker sounds alot more fun	Im pretty
u hate  the person u r in the light so much that u keep them buried in the dark. Why?	Afraid of being judged?	Afraid of the mayhem your going to cause?	Or just love feeling the way you do	I didn't like it so I stopped.  I'm just curious why I don't think anyone else actually has?
@ScarletMagdalen childish on both our parts	would you like to stop?	Yes = stop	any word more than or other than "yes", case sensitive =keep going	No response = stop		Deal?		and I believe your scenarios impressed because you never had this much fun
@ScarletMagdalen I'll take that as a no	Or your just not bright	But it's Funny because I feel the same way about you.		I always say that everything happens for a reason, but what would be the reason you won't go away and why I feel compelled to respond for only as long as you do back.	It's very
@vyqvy read ppls minds  or im a good guesser or im the only person who is the opposite of insane, it's a really long story
@vyqvy a friend of mine to help me finish up this current one.  Plus I have to Go back and change all the names, I think.  I'm not sure if it's slander if it's true from my perspective.  I know the ppl I know don't ever consciously admit to the things in my head but I've learned how to
@vyqvy Thats the theory though.	But in hand wrote everything 	I'm the middle of transcribing the first in but laptop screen got busted during one of my panic attacks, so I gotta take a break till I can get it fixed. Which is good because i have a lot to write about write now.But I have
@vyqvy very difficult, you have to dig into your nightmares.  The real ones and the sleep ones.  	The experiment is to see if it works on regular humans so they don't have to go through what I did to get the same results.  Results should vary based on the imagination of the reader.
@vyqvy genuine love for another being.  BEcause I believe that when you let go of all pain by not bottling it in any more.  By writing down.  when you do you, you start to realize how much the line begins to blur between what you see in your head and what you see in your life.  It's
@vyqvy part, sit back and be who they all want you to be.  Not the bad one.  	I would best describe it as taking advantage of ppls hatred of you, the ones that have been bringing your own all your life, by giving them Everything they deserve.  Your ear and your heart.  Not pity, but
@vyqvy pretty interesting even if ppl think I'm lying.  and if they have the courage to do what Ive done, it will teach them how to live forever.  and only it involves doing is forgiving all the ppl that hurt you, forgiving yourself for allowing them you, and then, and this is the hard
@vyqvy some days they seem like they are standing behind me and others it seems like they are demons.	It's basically a documentary of every psychosis I've gone thru over the past 8 months with no medication, only using the techniques taught by the ancient occultists. 	It's actually
@vyqvy the disection of my brain will change the world or just trying to make me crazy on purpose so I'm like them again or they are trying to use some behind sophisticated form of reverse physiology	I can't tell because they all lie to each other and they all lie to me, I think.
@vyqvy thinking that it's hanging from a cliff.  	My goal is that it saves the world or burns it to the ground. Metaphorically their the same thing but the world can be interpreted in multiple ways as well.	I think the ppl in My life either thinking I'm crazy and get me committed and
@vyqvy failures and victories .  It keeps growing though 	I'm on 7.25 books at about 45000 words each.  	I've been taking a break to write an almost side by side to prove what I've been writing about.  Not that's an exact match but it's actually working out even better despite others
@vyqvy I've been doing it for 8 months.  I can tell you that my life will never be the same.  But I've been writing about my journey from my perspective.  Whether it's ever released or not or edited or not isn't relevent, but it's like my own personal bible that reminds me of all my
@ScarletMagdalen Do emojis count as words?  Just want to be sure
@ScarletMagdalen I don't like tv and this is my typical entertainment, like most ppl on here. I presume we have that in common to, as your trying to use the act of watching tv as an insult, unless that was a general question.  Text doesn't show intent well.
@ScarletMagdalen It do you just want the last word?	I can comply with that
@ScarletMagdalen Does that mean your going to stop	I feel like this is one of those, "you hang up", "no you hang up first" things.	On the bright side I think your enjoying it at this point
@ScarletMagdalen keep coming back.  You want my attention for some reason.	I'm not complaining, this is a better time then I've had in a couple days.		OH, your just lonely	No worries, so am I	We got that in common too
@ScarletMagdalen pissing you off which I presume was about me, which I saw while scrolling thru last night	You seem more obsessed them me, if you want my opinion.  so I guess I'm obsessed to see how far your going to take this before you stop responding	.  	I even suggested you block me and you
@ScarletMagdalen Im no more obsessed then you appear to be	I'm only responding to your responses to a comment I left on a completely different thread made by someone else.  	I even poofed and you responded again to get me to notice.	You even made a post about some Nazi sympathizer that was
@catenergy22 @DCnumerology Ok, I thought so	Thanks
@ScarletMagdalen I can't think of any other good reason, unless you have that your white
@ScarletMagdalen Your racist against white ppl
@ScarletMagdalen At least we have not being very bright in common.  That's a start
@EsotericExposal That's one perspective
See?  	so think what you want
then you would call me a liar, and i don't lie, except that time I told you I didn't care what ppl think, which I don't, I only cared enough to tell you so you don't think I'm as weak as everyone else because I'm not, even though I complain about the same things as everyone else.
and I'm not because unlike those who constantly worry about what others think I dont.  Why? because I said it...like everyone else does....But I mean it unlike everyone else because everyone else are liars.  Unlike me.  Well, your not a liar either, cause if I called you a liar
because I'm already hurting, but too proud to tell you otherwise because you couldn't possibly understand what it's like to be me, unless you were me, and i am a unique snowflake that isn't like anyone else.  But everyone else cares what other ppl think.  That's why they are weak
me that isn't true?  Manipulating you to think how I want you to think.  Because as long as I can make you believe I dont care then you won't have the courage to try and hurt me because you'll think that I don't care enough to get hurt, but the only reason I even told you was
ask me why I don't care so I can insist and contradict myself over and over so that I can instill into your think head that I really dont, when in my reality I do.	But if I do care and at the same time tell you i dont, isn't that me shifting your reality to think something about
I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks	But I care enough about what you think to make sure you know that I don't care.  so I guess you could say that I care that you know I don't care.	Or maybe I do care	Maybe I care too much and maybe I just want you to think I dont care so you
@ScarletMagdalen I assure you I cannot
@ScarletMagdalen I believe your wrong and a terrible mind reader.  I think you like to make baseless assumptions because your hiding from something in yourself.	I'd even go so far as to say that I believe you are the actual racist and trying to project the hate you have for yourself onto others.
@ScarletMagdalen poof myself, I used my last one poofing you	Or you can block me.
@ScarletMagdalen it in your heart to forgive him.  do you not believe in forgiving ppl?	you may have been so brainwashed by society that you might actually believe your right but I think your doing it to legitimize something in yourself.	But I could be wrong, I don't think so though	I do not
@ScarletMagdalen can you?	You want me to leave you alone but you are trying to get my attention with this comment. why?	Do you not really want me to leave you alone?  If that's the case your going to have to tell me why you will never accept that this man could change and why you can never find
@ScarletMagdalen thought blackface was racist in the 80s your either not paying attention to what I said or need some clarity	You want to hate this guy and never forgive him because he put black makeup on his face.	You don't even know why he did it.  You think you do, but you can't read minds,
@ScarletMagdalen I don't know what sealioned means,but you used twice already.  Either your assuming I know what it means or you want me or someone else to be impressed your using it or you just learned it and getting the most out of it	If you think i was questioning whether ppl in general
I'll 2nd this, but I also believe that when you are thinking of someone, they are thinking of you as well	But that's my opinion based on my own experiences https://t.co/MHkBjo2sRD
@rubirosajunior and i will believe what you have to say as long as I can't disprove it 	But the only truth I know is what Ive experienced.  anything else is a belief and I believe that a belief is nothing more then just another opinion	But all of that is just my opinion
@rubirosajunior I look at truth like this	Every truth is a half lie and every lie is a half truth, that includes my own truths as well	Whats true for me may not be true to you and what's true for you may not be true for me.	I may not believe what you believe, but I believe that you believe it,
@ScarletMagdalen I didn't think we were arguing	But your wish is my command	Poof
Very much this https://t.co/xjvjY7KHu1
@ScarletMagdalen did your parents teach you as a child?  Specifically blackface?	I'm not interested in him anymore	I'm more curious about why blackface is so unforgivable to you.	I get the sense there's something really bottled up deep in you that's making you feel this way	Do you mind sharing?
@_wavyiz Why?	I hope you live
@MatthewPHX4 @Numerologynow @ImprintedENERGY Thank you
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO all alone.  Like someone watching you
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO believe me, they watch your every move, waiting for one moment of weakness to sneak inside your head and drive you mad with fear.  Be careful around mirrors too.  If you get that tingly feeling up the back of your neck it might be too late, I'm sure you felt it before when your
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO be careful of the names that you throw around of demons and gods and devils.  Just because you dont believe in them doesn't mean  they don't believe in you and are looking at you right this second		Standing right beside, invisible, but you can feel them.  Like goosebumps		and
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO in the universe you will have to bang your head against a hard wall for every time you misuse that word or claim to know more then fuck all about any religion.  and maybe you should pick up a copy of the satanic bible, your closer to a Satanist then you probably realize lol		and
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO like a big kid or go sit in the corner	Ppl like you are the problem with ppl.  Instead of telling CoS who they are, try asking instead, your probably be surprise how much you don't know		Moloch? I'm so tired of you ppl acting like you know anything at all.	If there is any justice
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO under control, because your all to lazy to do the work or ask the questio .  How hard is it for you to look into the shit your babbling about?  You come from a fairy tale land where you have to work and pay bills and be a "normal" person, you want to play with the big kids, act
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO You q ppl are no different then any other cult or religion you want to condemn	someone tells you something and you think your am expert	The CoS is a bunch of kindergarteners compared to the ppl you think that you know about	But that's the problem with ppl	and This is why your all
@MatthewPHX4 @Numerologynow But I still don't know what he does
@ScarletMagdalen maybe.	But my presumptions can come off like assumptions, which in a way they are.  I don't know you or what your like, but I've seen this behavior many times over.  am I right in anything?  No one ever says, I think they think it's an attack
@ScarletMagdalen member from when you were younger was overtly racist and it rubbed off a little bit, but in your later years realized the folly of that way of thinking and are making up for it by allowing yourself to be, in my opinion, overly outraged.	Or maybe you lost a friend to overt racism,
@ScarletMagdalen ppl who have done something similar to ourselves.  You have a secret your hiding.  Maybe not against a black person but you made a racial remark or had a thought about someone in your past and This Is your way of making up for it.	You didn't kill anyone did you?	Or maybe a family
@ScarletMagdalen I could be wrong but it's as if you want to outraged at this guy	why in your eyes is he beyond forgiveness?  Because he dressed as black face?  so what? 	Is it because you are worried that you will get slammed if you take a similar approach to me? 	But we usually find outrage for
@caidozcherry Nope I don't normally tag ppl	But the point I was making I thought was quite clear	 "Kid friendly" porn is a much better alternative the meat grinder madness that's out there now a days
@ChurchofSatan @liberatedno @RealCandaceO Too day is the first time I can admit that I'm glad I'm following you
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO The goat your refering to is baphomet not satan.  the image of Baphomet is an alchemical metaphor hijacked by CoS because it looks cool
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO Moloch is not Satan	As an atheist I would suggest doing some studying in theology and not just taking the word of anons who have done even less homework
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO If you are not a Jesus expert them how can you say the devil worshippers in the Vatican are not his ppl.		Christians worship exactly who they tell you they are, even the those in the vatican.  They just interpret it differently then intended
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO Well yes troops too	By supporting the troops you support everyone being killed including the troops.	Sheesh, that took some effort to word correctly
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO The killing of children, not troops
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO and don't feel bad for the kids. karma doesn't have an age limit
@liberatedno @ChurchofSatan @RealCandaceO I can't believe I'm doing this	Thelema isnt isn't satanism	It's sounds more like you are projecting your deepest fears and ignorance on CoS	As a q patriot do you support the troops?	If so you support the killing of troops	If not ignore that last question
@DCnumerology Are there other days that total 7 asides from the ones mentioned	It's are you including the month and year as well I'm the calculation?
@morethanMI5 @AndeeCurt It is, until we learn that the person we called a piece of shit, for arguments sake, only acted like a shit because it was our own piece of shit behavior that inspired them to act in their own piece of shit manner to counter balance out own.	Well that's what I learned at least
@Numerologynow "I think I mean..."	 "got any before...."
@Numerologynow Like what?	what exactly is it that ppl get from your courses?	I think I'm mean end game wise.  	Good any before and after reviews?	side by side comparisons of what your providing?	what do you teach ppl to do within the matrix, I suppose
@caidozcherry why?	Do I tag you often?
@sitvisvobis @caidozcherry rose bud stuff		Trust me, kids could probably benefit from this greatly
@sitvisvobis @caidozcherry some sick stuff out there.		I saw a man pull an octopus out of a girl in one, then slapped her with it.	and I wont even get started on tentacle open	Or one with the guy getting a personal massager thrust in and out of his front hole, if you get me		I refuse to even look at that
@sitvisvobis @caidozcherry Well look at it this way, would you rather your kid/s watch a filtered down "kid friendly" porn that you now about or some drug addled twenty something trying to swallow a giantüêì , or 2, while getting a fist or 2 rammed of up her keester?		do you even watch porn?		Theres
@offbeatoliv @4SLars Maybe that's the point	In my opinion he said it because he doesn't think you have the courage to do it, otherwise you wouldn't need him, as originally out it.	I'd make a bet with you he shits his pants if you did	But I think many therapists are snakes, so I'm biased
@Medytacyjnie @MindTendencies2 I suppose is a good way to put it
@Medytacyjnie @MindTendencies2 I was having this issue before.	I know what your saying and I am with you, but what I mean is that the words just come.  It's not that I'm not conscious of them, I see them in my head but they just come to me and out my mouth.  Always pertinent to the situation.  Perfectly times
@rubirosajunior if that wasn't a possibility though, I suppose anyone but you, being that you are excluded from this scenario
@rubirosajunior Me	But if I wasn't already me that is.  and the new me that wasnt this me wasnt trying to do the exact same thing that this me was doing, but then again I'm sure current me and the other me would both be following each other.  	I bet wed probably be besties
@SayItValencia @MindTendencies2 to this exact moment.  and all of those past moments were there to train us for this one, and the next one and so on. Until....something happens, not sure what, but I presume it's something cool üòé
@SayItValencia @MindTendencies2 exactly where we need to be to get one step closer to the path we need to be on. we never get more then what the universe thinks we can handle, but whether we pass the challenge of not falls on us, but we cant often say that we weren't prepared as ever moment in our past has led
@SayItValencia @MindTendencies2 absolutely	I think of it a little different though, or rather maybe I explain it a little different is a better choice of words. we are doing/saying/thinking exactly what we need to be doing/saying/thinking at the exact moment we are supposed to be doing/saying/thinking it to get
@MindTendencies2 think we're saying something similar.  Your words are a little different from mine, so I want to make sure I'm interpreting correctly
@MindTendencies2 Moment between moments = now?	I find that sometimes my words come out without me thinking.  I typically attribute it to the universe giving the exact words I need to say/text for the person I'm talking to to hear at the exact moment that they need to hear those specific words		I
@Medytacyjnie I think it will	Thanks
@ScarletMagdalen yrs, probably enough to make him regret that decision.		Especially today, why hold it over his head.  His own demons are going to be doing a number on him for the rest of his life because of this		Unless he learns How to forgive himself for making a mistake
@ScarletMagdalen myself		I'm not the same person I was in 1984 or 1999 or 2018 and I'm confident saying that I'm not the same person in was this morning.  My point is, we all change, whether it's perceived by other ppl or not is another story.  I would say this guy has seen a lot in the last 35
@ScarletMagdalen I agree, there were ppl back then that thought it was wrong. Maybe he didn't for some reason that we will never actually know	I've done lots of things in the past, even the recent past that ppl can judge me on.  and all of those things I accepted blame for, because I forgive
RT @Numerologynow: Only RT 		If the Knowledge I shared 	Changed your Life 		#GG33
@Medytacyjnie when you say gaps between words are you talking the words I used?		I mean, are you saying that what I said makes partial sense?
@Numerologynow Out a that I haven't interacted with someone with this much ego before.	I use the word ego in regards to the egoic and intuitive minds of occult philosophies, not you having a big head.  Thats abundantly clear.  But I don't judge.  I do too
@Numerologynow I only ask becuz I just started following u yesterday.  R u always like this?
@Numerologynow I get the sense that these little tweets about the greatness of your knowledge is to get my attention or boost your own ego.  But that could be my own ego too, but I'm working on reading energy of tweets	Long story
@Ichiikuu @Numerologynow How has his knowledge changed your life?
@Juvenal416 @Numerologynow How has it changed your life?
This https://t.co/FgStSaxyxX
A flick to your nose could be comparable to a bowling ball to my foot if you have never experienced either.  if you get my meaning	But that's just my perspective, it's ok if you don't agree with me
said, "for arguments sake".  Is it ok for a future partner to judge you for that behavior?		Racism and sex are 2 different things I know, but I'm talking about the act of being judged for I ones past, when one did not commit an actual crime.  Not a comparison of the acts.
did when we were younger?  Are you ok with ppl today judging you for your past?		Lets say for arguments sake that you were promiscuous when you were younger, what ever your concept of promiscuous may be, i don't personally like using that word to describe anyone, but like I
involved with the year book and the photo at the time was a racist and maybe he was too.  But ppl change and when ppl change so do their points of view.  Perhaps at the time he thought a different way then what he does today.  		Should you or I be condemned for something we
this photo?  Probably because he didn't think the world would see it, that's for sure.  But the fact he was ok with it being out into a college year book would mean that not only he but the school didn't think it was wrong.  		But why? could be for a few reasons.  Everyone
sometimes I make mistakes, like all other humans.  But I learn and grow from my mistakes so I don't make them a 2nd time, at least I try, that is. that's me and my opinion, but it is not my opinion that everything happens for a reason.		so what could be the reason he took
assume you may not be either, in regards to socialist and cultural norms of that time, in that section of the country.		ppl don't normally do what they as perceive as wrong without a good reason.  Otherwise they don't do it.  I only do what I perceive as good, well I try.
I don't think your a mind reader, or at least I'd say you need some work if you were But in 1984 I was 4, but i don't believe america was as culturally sensitive as it is today.		That being said, where did this take place?  I'm not familiar with the area and I think it's safe to https://t.co/IgWvmaUY2d
@Medytacyjnie I guess what ppl would call law of attraction.  But my way works for me.  It wasn't something just 1person  taught me.  It took many many ppl and many many experiments to learn how to control it a little better
@Medytacyjnie This is a little hard to explain in depth, but think of it like karma.	Fix old karma, learn the lesson and integrate to change the world around you to become what you want it to be
@Medytacyjnie It's not even a practice anymore.  It's become my way of life.  I quit my job back in July and over that time learned how to live with out money and continue my work
@Medytacyjnie also believe that everything is also a test with a lesson to learn
@Medytacyjnie It's a little hard to explain in a few paragraphs.		This of it like this.  I allow myself to face all the fears, anxieties, insert favorite negative emotion, so that I can allow that emotion to take my mind where it wants, as like I said, everything happens for a reason, but I
@Medytacyjnie want to say.  I'm real life it's about split second thinking and learning to stay quiet and listen 		It's a long story.  I hope that makes semse, with as few typos as possible	But these are my tactics, they arent for everyone	I do a lot of, I suppose you'd call it shadow work.
@Medytacyjnie ppl, and the ones I do in real life don't know how to release their ego baggage until they blow up, the best source of negativity is social media.  This way if/when those in my real life do explode I do not go ballistic on them.  		Twitter  gives you time to think about what you
@Medytacyjnie the scope of that statement.		am I at peace?  I practice a form of spiritual expansion in which I take in as much "negative energy" as I can do that I can teach myself to "transmute" and learn the lesson to better overcome it in the future.  But being that I don't talk to many
@Medytacyjnie understand why he blocked me.  I really hoped we could worked out our differences, but I believe 1 or both of us are not ready for that yet.  I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir when I say everything happens for a reason.  I think a lot of ppl don't have an easy time accepting
@Medytacyjnie the ego are the ultimate test.		I appreciate the questions by the way, I find it rare that ppl do that unfortunately		Right now I am feeling calm and collected.  I learned the lesson, I needed to learn.  That I need to start following my own advice better		am I understanding, I
@Medytacyjnie outside world either.  		But I also enjoy these Twitter interactions as a sort of practice.  Not so much as I'm planning on having the same conversations as much as learning to control myself when my ego is challenged, on and off line 		Because like you, I believe challenges to
@Medytacyjnie abilities.  I see challenges to the ego as the universe telling us that we have something to learn from those Or that that challenge us.		But I feel it almost as a calling to challenge the egos of everyone I meet, online and in real life.  I don't have many friends I'm the
@Medytacyjnie Exactly, not many ppl realize that when they talk about frequency, high or low, it all comes down to perspective either way		I feel silly admitting this but I find that Twitter is great practice in terms of allowing my own ego to be challenged and handle it to the best of my
@Numerologynow Why?	You concerned you'll have nothing to teach me	You'd be surprised how much I don't know	But Im sure you'd probably also be just as surprised at what I do		I don't think your a fraud, you got a lot of monkeys trying hump your leg, I'm actually impressed and slightly intrigued
how you did		 "Better" is subjective by the way, I know you did what you thought was right before your followers started to see the person behind the facade
and then block the person for letting you know they know your talking about them		I was hoping we could of been friends	Oh well		I suppose the lesson for me is that not everyone has the courage to face the mirror.  I hope I can when my times up, or at least handle it better then
universes lesson to you, try putting a disclaimer at the end of your tweets that it's not ok for ppl to have opposing views then yours to comment back.  		You will save yourself the trouble of lowering your self to a frequency that inspires you to post passive aggressive tweets
@KNeferhetep 	I cannot answer the question when you block me after posting it	But I did not think i implied that I was on it to begin with.  	But I think what upset you is that you don't like not having your ego stroked, like all the other phonies on twitter		 But here is the https://t.co/NMPRn6F3dT
@Numerologynow Lotto for knowledge		You must be very good at what you do		What is that you actually do though?  I am envisioning sport gambling with astrology and numerology.  Close?  Or do I pay 3k for the opportunity to find out?
RT @Maryamhasnaa: Trying to get people who are not experiencing what you are going through, to understand it, is like trying to explain col‚Ä¶
@Maryamhasnaa That is exactly it
@soledadobrien @ScarletMagdalen I can't say for sure because I wasn't there but 1984 was 34 yrs ago.  I would have to presume, as most who were adults at the time, that 1984 culture was far different from 2019.	and just to play devils advocate, I got a hunch this is a Halloween party, but again, I wasn't there
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep I don't think, and I'm sure we will both agree, we ever stop	I embrace all my missteps in life and I wear them as badge of honor.  I look at it like this, with out learning from my mistakes I wouldn't be who am I today.
@beast_anti @Lemik_merope I agree with "Many problems"
@MindTendencies2 But Sometimes what we perceive as an insult is the universe speaking through someone else to remind us of our own thought patterns that need to be adjusted	Everything happens for a reason, even perceived insults
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep concept in question more fully.  Tweets have a tendency to force us to condense a mile wide thought into the back seat into the backseat of a car, if you get my meaning
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep to look past the meaning of the word, so to speak		I see them, mistskes, as opportunities to learn from, grow from, and take with us to never make that mistake again.		trying to see from his perspective, I would go back to the person that inspired this post and discuss the
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep I actually love what you said but I don't think you meant it the way I see it, but I could be wrong.		Yes he's human	Yes humans make mistakes	and yes you have to look past mistakes		But I don't see mistakes as mistakes, I try to not even use that word of I don't have to.  I try
@beast_anti @Lemik_merope Yes to this	During the q days everyone said "trust the plan"	Eventually I came to see that the only plan I needed to trust was my own
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep think I know.		You'd be surprised what you can learn from those we perceive as having a lower frequency.  and realistically, high/low frequencies are really matter of perspective.	I think you would really enjoy the kyballion, if you haven't read it yet
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep misunderstanding, but that requires us to also accept that our own perspectives may be wrong or may need some refinement.  I always say the 4 magic words that can squash any ego are "I could be wrong".  I always try acknowledge with myself that I could be wrong about everything I
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep But is cursing ppl out for disagreeing, I forget his exact quote, really for the higher good?	Wouldn't a higher frequency person attempt to understand the perspective of the person that they perceive of having a lower frequency?		Like I was saying, it could just be a
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep only truth I know is what I've experienced.
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep same time. and if you want to really make a statement you could say the glass and it'a contents don't even exist		I look at it like this, I may not believe what you believe but I believe that you believe it. I will do my best to believe what you say that I cant disprove but the
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep true forwards and backwards. What's true for me may not be true to you		For instance, 99degrees is hotter then 98 degrees and colder then 100 degrees.  It just depends on the perspective you choose to take.  Or even, you could say that the glass is half empty and half full at the
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep I didn't think he was like most ppl.  Most ppl ignore me because they think I'm attacking	But truth, even his, is subjective to the individual	It's like the principle of polarity says, every truth is a half lie and every lie is a half truth.  That statement is true because it's
@PARRISH8809 @KNeferhetep of the making of this piece
@PARRISH8809 @KNeferhetep Wise man once say, "you gotta clean your room before you save the world"	I love that saying, forgot who said it though	There are no coincidences, everything happens for a reason, at least that's my perspective.		I forget his Twitter handle but the artist posted a very cool video
@KNeferhetep What is "it" then?	Perhaps it's just a simple case of a misunderstanding
@_wavyiz @KNeferhetep I won't speak for anyone, but in my experience ppl usually get mad because they aren't heard the way they want to be heard.  Most ppl just want to be praised for their thoughts, they typically don't like those thoughts to be challenged	I used to be like that so I can relate
@Numerologynow @Rezn8_the_Great though		one of those things I learned was that truth doesn't need to be defended.  	either way that's just my opinion from my personal experience
@Numerologynow @Rezn8_the_Great Even neo has to learn from morpheus.  But that is a very bold claim		I come from the school of thought that if you have to say something then it might not be as true as we want it to be, but that's just my opinion		But unlike you i had to learn a lot of what I know from others
@taylorburrowes @Numerologynow I couldn't let you show me up with that handstand lol	so I got a monkey to juggle some bananas	Unfortunately the bananas were harmed during filming https://t.co/avS8524zZP
@KNeferhetep I hope you don't think I'm picking on you.  I'm not trying to hurt you but I like to make observations.  Your be surprised the interesting ppl you meet doing that
@KNeferhetep You can ask me anything you like 	I have no idea who or what you are.  I'm just making an observation based on what I feel from reading your tweet, but like I said, I could be wrong.  Was I right?	Sometimes my presumptions come off as assumptions, but that's why I say sumthing
@KNeferhetep Maybe I'm wrong but I translate this as , "I don't like when ppl don't think like me. and the only way I know how to express that is through passive aggressive tweets rather then having a open minded conversation".  But again, that's just my interpretation 	I could be wrong
@KNeferhetep I used to use hourly reminders on my phone	It really helped with breaking old thought patterns
@Alyssa_Milano @ScarletMagdalen are when your a grown up you will more then likely still believe bananas are bad for you
@Alyssa_Milano @ScarletMagdalen know why they think the way they do until you take a walk in their shoes.  Maybe they have a good reason for thinking that way.  Perhaps they only think the way they do because that's how they've been trained.		if your brought up being told all bananas are bad for you, chances
@Alyssa_Milano @ScarletMagdalen I believe judging ppl for the way they think is worse then judging ppl for the way they look	But that's just my opinion	Judging looks is one thing but thinking we are better then someone just because they don't have the same thoughts as us is way uglier, in my opinion		You don't
RT @MindTendencies2: Sometimes you think you have a problem with someone		But in reality		This person inadvertently triggered your negativi‚Ä¶
@taylorburrowes @Numerologynow Far out	My own handstand skills have been on a steep decline over the years but I think you just inspired me to get back on it
@Numerologynow @taylorburrowes head when I think of a battle of wits	But I don't like participate in little games like that.  It usually ends bad for me.
@Numerologynow @taylorburrowes them just how weak they believe them selves to be. Revenge of the nerds comes to mind.  more revenge of the nerds 2 Then 1 though, but that's just how I see it.  You might hav e something completely different  in your head		But that's just the little scenario that plays in my
@Numerologynow @taylorburrowes until 1 person gets tired out first  and will throw cheap insults and childish attacks at the one who they perceive as knowing more then them as a way to distract others from seeing their bruised egos, not realizing that by doing so they are showing those who were once behind
@Numerologynow @taylorburrowes sign?	I could see how you would mean either or but I can also see you leaving it up to my interpretation, I suppose it doesn't actually matter either way		What do you consider a battle of wits?  I get a mental image of 2 ppl doing and saying stuff back and forth to each other
@Numerologynow @taylorburrowes Funny you say that, I am a monkey, 1980 	But also a Leo sun, Scorpio moon  and cap rising, in case your wondering, it's ok if your not.  Not sure on vedic though, I'm not terribly familiar with all of it		But are you implying a literal monkey would outwit me or another monkey
@taylorburrowes @Numerologynow Interesting about the difficulty of standing vs walking, I wouldn't of thought that.  But, if we're going for aesthetics, I gotta go with handwalking. It always makes me think of the kid in the wheel chair in Friday the 13th pt3,	I get the impression your a handstander?
@rubirosajunior Not gonna lie, there is a interesting sensation in my head
@Rezn8_the_Great Easily injured?	Like mr glass?
@AJA_Cortes @rubirosajunior we are right but not all the time		do you have any examples of these arrogant types?  I'm curious if I fall into that category because I hate small talk, but my definition of small talk may be different from yours
@AJA_Cortes @rubirosajunior the wrong things.  No need to call them names because you bore them. maybe, you bore them because you have nothing of substance to offer.		sometimes when we point the finger at others, we are projecting into them who we believe we would be if we were in their shoes.  Sometimes
@AJA_Cortes @rubirosajunior experiences	But substance to me could be boring to you. that doesn't make you arrogant just not interested in the crap I'm spewing.  Thats ok too.		If your talking and no one is listening, maybe it's not them thats the problem, maybe your just talking to the wrong ppl or saying
@AJA_Cortes @rubirosajunior Is it possible that you think they are arrogant pseudo intellectuals because you can't keep up with their way of thinking?  Nothing wrong with that at all.	some ppl are thinkers and want to discuss thing of substance.  Most others are not, but that's my opinion based on my own
@taylorburrowes @Numerologynow Handstands are definitely impressive 	Walking handstands though, that's really impressive		But I think a monkey juggling bananas would destroy all the competition.  But I'm biased to monkeys, juggling and bananas
@FlaminHotPeen @rubirosajunior Amazing
@scott_wyman @Bravewriting been a hypocrite ever in your life?	I would have a very difficult time believing anyone who would say no
@scott_wyman @Bravewriting because those pointing it out are too scared themselves to be willing to change their way of thinking because that would mean they would have to admit that they COULD be wrong, and most egos do not like to accept that.		But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong		You've never
@scott_wyman @Bravewriting Tomorrow I stop dressing as black face because I'm putting someone else's needs in front of my needs		I would say that ALL ppl are guilty of hypocrisy, very few own it though which I don't understsnd. I see it as growth		I wonder if hypocrisy is typically portrayed as a negative
@scott_wyman @Bravewriting Hypocrisy isn't a bad thing.  I look at it like learning from your mistakes and changing your preconceived notions of what you thought were correct for a new set of thought patterns.	For instance:	Yesterday I loved dressing as black face	Today I learned it can hurt ppls feelings
@Bravewriting Maybe their not pretending	Maybe they don't realize it, because maybe they don't know.	Not everyone knows the same thing as you	I would go so far as to say the ppl trying to start civil war 2 are the ones in the suits playing you all against each other, but that's just my opinion
@NPC534513147878 @LibertyGeek83 @allidoisowen @peterboykin Well I'm his defense the thread is about ALL democrats being scumbags 	Thangs like saying all whites are racist	At least this fellow said only 9 out of 10 republicans are.	At least he didn't say all
@allidoisowen No	just like how not every1 who thinks like you is a scumbag, but I think ur just trying 2 get ppl worked up by asking a silly question like that	But I could be wrong, also sounds like you could be venting because you had a bad exp recently, just doing in a passive aggresive way
@underchilde Waking up
@obianuju @Dani_MB Evil is subjective.	can You elaborate on the chaos that ensued	What is abortion extremism?	What do you mean by doom?	Really always?  You got any proof?
@beast_anti I do not	The universe is getting pretty pissed off about it to
@Rezn8_the_Great so your learning how to see the signs and symbols the universe/matrix is leaving that point you towards where ever it is your going?  Is that what your saying?	How is Gary's numerology helping in that regard?	so you would say it was worth the 3000$?
@Numerologynow Whats the most impressive thing youve seen so far?I	I didn't see anything in the comments worth a 2nd look	what do lol usually do to impress you?	Headstands?  Juggling?  Jokes?	Not getting what your asking	It Sounds like your trying to get some monkeys to juggle bananas for you
@Rezn8_the_Great @DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan We can agree on that
@Rezn8_the_Great @DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan It provides enough clues but you didn't figure it out?	Sounds like you needed more clues		Those gravitating to what answer?	The question about multitasking?  That's all I wanted to know lol
@tamexis @KNeferhetep I would agree	I can't say that I've met a single person not taken by it	At least none that are convincing
@tamexis @KNeferhetep I don't known what you consider satanic	@ChurchofSatan? Those guys are larpers	Is there a specific ritual your thinking, because I'm not familiar any.  I read the satanic bible, well tried...	But either way that's your perspective, a Satanist would consider theoreticians good
@rubirosajunior Not right now
@Rezn8_the_Great @DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan so you figured it out too?
@rubirosajunior This is something I've been trying to work up to	I think I have about 15, my goal is 24, but it's not easy, I'm a food junky
@rubirosajunior Water or you go cold turkey on everything?
@tamexis @KNeferhetep I dig what your saying though
@tamexis @KNeferhetep I agree &amp; disagree.  I believe part of the current experience, as u so aptly out it, is to be part of a high jacked experience	Just like the matrix	But I c evil\good as subjective to the individuals perspective of what they define as good or evil	Good for me could be bad for you
@rubirosajunior My bad	How long	Not thinking
@tamexis @KNeferhetep I don't blame anyone for anything.  But I believe in karma and reincarnation and that everything, not some things, happen for a reason.  In my opinion child "victims" are getting a comeuppance from a past life, or is that too dark for you?
@Maryamhasnaa @ccshanti22 I know, I was only bring up misinterpretations of a healthy exchange.  I've interacted with quite a few ppl who take me as attacking rather then inquisitive.  Could be my aproach, which I admit can come off as abrasive to some but i leave that misinterpretation
@mindvirus_ Interesting, my father died in May 8	Granted it was 2015, but the day sticks out
@mindvirus_ Well more then just luck
@mindvirus_ Gotcha	Gonna have to look into the injury thing, I was under the impression 7 was associated with luck
@KNeferhetep Though wouldn't consider it murder as much as preservation, but I'm splitting hairs on the definition of murder. When I think of murder I think of maliciously taking the life of another person	But agsin, I'm splitting hairs
@KNeferhetep if they can manage that, I agree
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Homework on what?	I'm no closer to an answer to my first question then I was this morning
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Why though, because I questioned gary?	It's almost 12 hrs later, and still not a single one of you can explain why numerology proves multitasking is a valid technique.	I know Gary isn't the only person to figure this out, or maybe he is.	Thanks fore keeping me occupied today tho
@ccshanti22 @Maryamhasnaa right, from our own perspectives. I think some ppl forget that our own truths are truth to us but opinion to outsiders.  But that's my opinion
@ccshanti22 @Maryamhasnaa that abbreviated words and phrases.  ppl using different lingo and inflection then some are used to, I love a good exchange but more often then not it turns into, like you said, A battle of who's right and who is wrong.  		I try to go into every exchange assuming we are both
@ccshanti22 @Maryamhasnaa I agree, but I also think Its possible to misinterpret a genuine question or attempted exchange into an attack or challenge.	I see that happen quite a bit, especially online, but I also attribute that to text being a shifty form of communication		We got our selves into a society
@MayoSaladd @GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow You don't think it makes more sense to ask the person who made the claim?	Why?
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow share for free		I know you didn't ask for fun facts but it's a better answer then most would give
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow free, cause they don't really know how to use it right and it's not typically worth free.  BUt that's just my opinion based on my experience	I haven't had to worry about money for the past3.5 months.  But that's because I learned how to live a free life with what I know.  and I
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow unless you agree with everything they say, I encourage you to take another look at how I conduct myself.  I thought what I said was quite reasonable.  could		and be weary of ppl who put their wisdom behind a pay wall, theres usually a reason ppl are afraid to give their work for
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow with a lot of closet mystics to and learned a neat tricks from them.  	I needed to take a break from studying to take care of some family things but I'm trying to get as much info as I can.  I like being the best but everyone I meet who claim to know things don't like to talk
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow where you take in the timing of Christianity's roots in conjunction with a good foundation of masonic, alchemical,occult symbolism.  you also have zues, horus, ra, krishna, etc, also representatives of the sun		so ya, I know a couple things about the power of 7.  I used to hang
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow like astrotheology, which is one of the inspirations for the religious control systems put into place because of the empirorer Constantine and the council of nicea,but I wasn't there so I can't claim to know that for sure but based on my studies that's the most logical scenario
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow week, Or day of the sun is the Christian Sabbath because the character or avatar, depending on how want want to view him, christ  is representative of the actual Sun as the sun is godin quite a few mystic traditions , when you translate them properly in correlation to something
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow you noticed that jackpot on some scratchies and slot machines is 777	Black jack = 21 = 7+7+7.  I'm sure one of the gentlemen of gg33 can expand of the number 21 better then me		Saturn the 7th planet is represented by the titan chronos, father of zeus.		Sunday the 7th day of the
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow ancient astrology, 7 notes in music, god creates the earth in 7 days, etc	speaking of god, I don't recall the exact reason, I'm sure someone could remind me, but 777 is known as gods number, and 77 is, I believe, a or the perfect number.  		Now if your the gambling type im sure
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow traditions.  I don't recall all the reasons why but 7 would be like the super multitasker of the numbers, in my opinion.  But it's sacred nature is because of how often it appears in nature. 7 colors of the rainbiw, 7 chakras, 7 days of the week named after the first 7 planets of
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow could take it apart and find some aspects that could work with their current knowledge, or not, doesn't bother me		But to your question, I am familiar with 7 energy but it may be a little different from gary.  7 is considered a sacred number with the mystics and religious
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow about his knowledge but he said he didn't have a teacher.  Neither did I but I had to study few other ppls work before I could compare a few different perspectives and come with my own conclusions. But I don't mind sharing mine, not saying their gospel, but I'm sure someone else
@GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow I'm very familiar with 7 as a matter of fact, but probably a little different from these guys, that's why I'm curious about where their getting their info	I come from more a hermetic/qabalists/alchemists school of numerology, but I'm still learning so I'm curious how Gary came
@rubirosajunior Thinking do you typically fast for
@Maryamhasnaa But what if they are trying to share something you may not know.  Just because someone doesn't agree doesn't mean their trying to suck you dry.  Maybe also they are just trying to find flaws in their own logic to improve upon by getting a deeper understanding of yours
RT @InfiniteWaters: One of the truest signs of maturity is the ability to disagree with someone while still remaining respectful.
@DCnumerology What's considered a major world events	Are you implying something will happen tomorrow specifically?
@KNeferhetep Why?  why not just tell me I'm wrong?  I could be but you aren't showing me otherwise	and just because we doing agree on victim mentality doesn't mean we can't find common ground.
@ogsloe_ @KNeferhetep am I wrong though?	if a bully bullies you your entire life, who's fault is it?	The bully or you for allowing yourself to be bullied?
@Numerologynow @GabrieleAlyssa @Adrian_inez_ a logical person would come to what conclusion?  That the sky is blue because someone else said so?  Or that they would need to find out for themselves?	It's not a matter of you needing my money as much as deserving it	But who am I to say
@KNeferhetep you asked a question I answered truthfully	You don't like my response?  why?  Because it's not the same as yours?	Or are you a victim too?
@GabrieleAlyssa @Numerologynow @Adrian_inez_ do u typically take any1 word 4 face value?	I'm curious why I have to prove myself to Gary.  He's the one selling a service, shouldn't I try to be an informed buyer and question what he's putting out there?	Just becuz sum1 tells me the sky is blue doesnt mean Im not going 2 check
@GabrieleAlyssa @Numerologynow @Adrian_inez_ and you again, I don't believe in coincidence	why should I know hes busy?	Your right no one is obligated to tell me anything, but I got quite a few trying to telling me things, just nothing I asked
@mindvirus_ @Numerologynow Thanks	Maybe I'll check it out
@mindvirus_ Why not add the rest of the date?	2/1/2019 = 6	I know there's multiple schools of numerology, what makes one more accurate then another?	I never heard of 7 being associated with injuries, that's interesting.
@KNeferhetep @GabrieleAlyssa Right	But we were intelligent enough to see those forces for what they are.  I can't blame the controllers for doing what they themselves are programmed to do, they dont know any better, like the majority of the 99% who prefer to be cattle
@GabrieleAlyssa @KNeferhetep No, you are interpreting that I am acting that way.  	Your right though, most are ignorant and deserve everything happening to them	Luckily there are those like us who are not and know it's only going to get worse for the cattleand	which is why we are better suited to survive
@KNeferhetep I do	Stand up for yourself or take it deep	There are no victims
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Work and dedication? You should try asking questions to numerologists that don't like answering questions about numerology	I'm need a nap after this lol
@Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan and what is he doing different t from every other numerologist?  What makes him the best?  Because of 20yrs?  Or just cause he says things he can't seem to back up I should just accept his word as gospel?
@Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan I asked how numerology proves multitasking is effective	I don't care if Gary did this for 20yrs or 20 minutes	He made a claim that I asked for clarity on	I don't him personally and don't know what he knows, are you saying I should take his word and not question him?
@DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow @Rezn8_the_Great @UnknownJetsFan why do you feel that was well said, it actually sounded condescending
@Numerologynow @DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @UnknownJetsFan Not to say that this hasn't been an enlightening experience	But you do have me convinced of the fact that there are in fact  numerologists that are indeed frauds
@Numerologynow @DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @UnknownJetsFan I'd say I've already proven im worth your time considering how long you and I have been at this 	but being that I have learned nothing except that it's difficult to get you to answer, what I presumed would be, simple questions, I'm questioning whether your actually worth my time
@SenBillCassidy @Jburgh4 What sounds do aborted babies make?
@KNeferhetep But if the 99% sit around allowing the 1% to ruin it for them, isn't that fault fall on those allowing it to happen?	and if not why?  My only guess would be that it's easier to cry victim then take blame for being lazy.
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Why?	what does any of that have to do with anything I've asked	All of my questions seemed pretty straight forward	No need to over complicate anything.  plus I'm sure I'm not the only person who is wondering
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan if you really want to help I would suggest researching the copious amounts of questions I left strewn about this thread.  Having to backtrack to find them all would be a waste of MY time at this point.  But I appreciate the offer.	Thank you
@KNeferhetep But if enough believe the devil is a god, who makes the final determination of who is right?  the true God?  Which one is that?  The one with more followers? Or the one you personally believe in?	and if it's your own personal, would the devil God worshipers get the same respect?
RT @Numerology2019: The best way to escape from a problem is to solve it.
@DavidEmerson33 @Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Doesnt research involve asking questions?	what questions do you feel were a waste of anyone's time to answer? Mayb I asked the wrong way	Or should I just take Gary's word for what ever he says	shouldnt all things in the matrix be questioned?  Or just somethings?
@Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan The ones you originally responded to	Or maybe even a better explanation as to why numerology proves the validity of multitasking, which is what began this exchange
RT @DeAndresCalm: Yeah sex is cool, but have you ever had someone understand your mind.
@HearClearUS What makes them revolutionary?	I have to presume they don't actually emit a light show
@DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow You are correct, research takes a lot of work	But I'm just asking some simple questions that are not actually getting answered which is leading me to ask more questions which aren't being answered
I find it incredibly difficult to find ppl capable of answering questions about their own expertise, why?		I'm starting to question how many ppl really know about the stuff they claim to know about
@Rezn8_the_Great @Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan You just told me the same thing he did with different words	But that didn't answer my actual questions
@MurcBlu @DCnumerology Great question	I'd even expand further and ask if the distance from said door plays a role in what ever bad fortune is being alluded to	does the door have to be in the same room?  Same building?	so many questions
@Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow Because if you didn't assume I know what your talking about and explain what you mean I wouldnt have to ask so many questions I		did you not think of that before trying to question my intent with gifs?		It's maybe you were being sarcastic about the scholarship
Lesson for the day	If one calls themselves a numerologist, chances are that are a fraud	A numerologist taught me that	Every insightful
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan Your saying that date all the numerology came to you out of the blue?  No books?  no tuortials?  No YouTube videos? You knew and just expanded it?
@Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow a scholarship from where?	Gg33 university?	It's Gary?
@Numerologynow @Adrian_inez_ Well I've influenced you to continue talking to me for close to an hour and you still haven't actually explained how numerology proves that multitasking works		so if/when I reach 20k should I dm you immediately or is there a little slack, say 19,511, just to use a random number?
@mindvirus_ That doesn't actually explain anything, and that dude sounds more condescending then informative	I'm sure I'll find one numerology who can answer this	Thank you though
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan You predicted the injury 2012 and when did it come to pass? Days weeks months years?	Are you implying you are pretty good at sports betting?	That's a good insight on knowledge though.  Can't trust stupid ppl to use it for the right reasons, like sports predictions
@UnknownJetsFan @Numerologynow 7 seems to be the busiest number out of all the rest, so I'll put my money there
@UnknownJetsFan @Numerologynow Maybe it's 777, God's number		7 is quite the muktitasker	7 days of the week	7 luminaries	7colors of the rainbow	7 notes in music	7 chakras		777 is also the jackpot number on your scratches and slot machines		Blackjack = 21 = 7 + 7 + 7		711 chains also giving your 7th coffee free
@UnknownJetsFan @Numerologynow Peace wouldn't go with law/order.  Theres no number for chaos?	why do the numbers mean those specific things though? who is determining this?  If Gary never had a teacher is he the one making the rules?
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan All of your numerology knowledge just came to you one day?  You are the master?	I find that a little hard to believe	why would u get insulted?  Are you implying I insulted you on purpose?	I'm my experience, ppl typically get insulted when being called out on something true.
@UnknownJetsFan @Numerologynow Given his own logic of most neurologists being frauds, why is he not a fraud?  Because he said so?  	I could say I'm the worlds best ballerina, but that means nothing if I don't walk the walk.
@UnknownJetsFan @Numerologynow Are you implying he came up with the only method of determining how numerology is related to multitasking?	How many unique methods is he holding on to that no other numerologist thought of?	and he learned from some where, how do we know he isn't copying someone else's work?
@DavidEmerson33 @Numerologynow That's fantastic, happy birthday	If you've been studying so long why don't you have your own group?	what do you mean "corrected the imperfections...I. The knowledge." ?		Are you saying they helped regime the knowledge you already had?
@Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow How is 7 energy significant to this?
@Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow learn?  How does gg33 knowledge show this? and how does multitasking help fulfil energy, and what does that actually mean?
@Adrian_inez_ @Numerologynow why would I not be entitled to my own opinion?  But I'm entitled to someone else's as long as it appears to be informed?	why is no one entitled to be ignorant?  Or you implying that ppl should be forced to learn something they don't want to?  and if so, who determines what they
@mindvirus_ What makes it a 7 day?	and why is it best to learn things on 7 days?	I don't think your implying that 7 days are the only days to gain new knowledge, or are you?	Is there more knowledge available on 7 days then non or is that it's easier to gain?
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan intellect could understand.  But your not even trying.		Plus your comment on most numerologists being frauds has me a little suspect as to your own validity.I hope to see otherwise one day
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan I'm starting to think that you don't actually know either, but that's based off the fact that there is still no explanation as to why numerology matters to multitasking skills.		Unless it's that complex of an answer that it can not be simplified into words that those of lesser
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan hoarding knowledge, but that's a tactic of the elite
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan understood your work better they would get better and not be frauds.  and perhaps they can improve on some of your ideas. Unless you think you already have all the answers.  and what work is it you do that's different?  Or do I need to read the book to find out?  Unless your just
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan 1. Are you implying that I should trust a numerologist who just called most neurologists frauds that he isn't a fraud?	2. I'll take your word for it but I personally haven't seen anything that impressive, but that's just my opinion based off of a few tweets	3.  Maybe if they
@Numerologynow I'm going to need a little more convincing then that
@numerology07 I cannot wait, these are some of my favorite subjects	Especially karma, is like to see some who actually has a perspective on it other then, good things happen to good ppl and bad things happen to bad ppl
@DavidEmerson33 how do you know there'll help?	How do you know their legit?
@DCnumerology What does that mean?	Hiding from what?  death?  Justice? what special about this group that gives them the power of the elite?  and what is gg33 hiding from?  Death? Justice?	Nothing against you personally but my Bullshit meter is red lining right now
@Numerologynow @JheneAiko @AikoSign What is it?
@mindvirus_ Why?
@DCnumerology What gg33 and why is it the only real source of numerology?
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan thanks for the hashtag but that wasn't an answer to any question I asked or did it better explain the answer to the original question, and the posts I see on that tag are just more numerology ppl saying things and not explaining why.	It's is that against the rules of numerology?
@DCnumerology and why are they snakes?
@DCnumerology Why?	I noticing a trend of numerology ppl just saying things without proper explanation, why?
@Numerologynow @UnknownJetsFan That question deserves a better answer then this	What does all in the numbers mean?	what do you mean ppl of a certain energy?	Is "very good at multitasking" a separate thought or part of the first sentence?	Not everyone understands that ppl come in different frequencies
@LifeMathMoney Perhaps not for you, but just because you can't do something doesn't mean others can not
@Numerologynow disagree that the "idiots opinion doesn't matter".  I believe all opinions matter, but I also believe it's the true idiots that think otherwise.  But that's just my opinion, you may disagree
@Numerologynow understandable way to anyone familiar or not with your brand of numerology		I'm actually quite interested as I am familiar with some numerology, notice a lot of number guys like to say things without explaining.  I don't believe your one of them though. 		But I will have to
@Numerologynow as familiar with numerology as you		do you mind explaining how numerology proves him/her wrong?  I would say common sense alone proves him/her wrong, but that's just my personal opinion. But you are making a bold claim that you should be able to explain in a way that's easily
@Numerologynow actually perform well at multitasking.  Yes there are others who are capable, some more then others, like in all things.		Myself for example, I'm not completely comfortable with my numerology skills but I get the feeling that most ppl are not as familiar as me and I know I'm not
@Numerologynow In my experience, I have found those who call someone else wrong without a proper explanation don't actually know what their talking about and may actually be the ignorant one of the dispute.		I would agree with the other guy because most ppl are too bogged down mentally to

@JeremyMcLellan @FatherSciarappa Christ?  a man?  A mortal being capable of sin?  I think a better question would have been if priests should be allowed in church.  Even Christ said to call no man father for there is only one father.		But in regards to your original question, of course children should be

@tweetmommybop There are too many to list as I believe it's the insanity of every person I follow that teaches me how to NOT be like them.	But that's just my opinion	Just because I think your all nuts doesn't mean you are in your own perspective of realities, only mine	Just like I may appear

@Alyssa_Milano person claiming the right to take away your rights	But who have them that right?  The person willing to have their rights taken away. Smh	Humans really are stupid animals
@Alyssa_Milano What I find more concerning then bigotry is why humans believe they have a right to anything	Too have a right implies that it is something that can be taken away by who ever grants that right	and if you believe someone can take something from someone else, your just as bad as the
@orchidslantern Same	I envision a techno-mystical future one day	Final fantasy comes to mind lol	Magitek
@orchidslantern 100%	I believe ever person is waking up to some form of spirituality or another.  But we get so stuck up on the drama and stresses of everyday like that we ignore the call, or maybe not ignore, but confuse it for something it's not, like calling it a mental disorder
@orchidslantern but I'm biased lol
@orchidslantern they don't want to let go of.  But that's the fun, at least I think, of all of it.  Throwing out old ideas new ones or figuring out a way to marry the old with the new to come up with something completely unique	I think The world needs more thinkers.  Especially overthinkers,
@orchidslantern I don't think I have heard it	I'll have to check it out.  I like getting other ppls perspectives.  Especially when they think of things I haven't tried it thought of on my own.  	I believe too many ppl are scared of other ppls ideas, for fear of it conflicting with something
@orchidslantern believer that these philosophies/sciences are going to make their way back into the mainstream sooner then later, in some form or another	Well at least used in a less oppressive manner
@orchidslantern codified for me the notion that everything happens for a reason.	Reading it was one thing.  Learning to see the principles in the world was an experience like no other.	Makes you feel like a Jedi sometimes lol	But that's something is like to see taught in schools one day	I'm a
@orchidslantern Every time I think of the kyballion I get tingles	You can probably relate, but book gave names and structure to thoughts and concepts I contemplated before even knowing hermetic was a word lol	But like it's said in the intro, you didn't find this book by chance	That book really
@orchidslantern at it like this, thelema just is.  I see it as something that's always been there, Crowley just have it a name
@orchidslantern Exactly that, subjective spirituality	and constantly evolving with the practicioner comsciousness	I joined a fb group just to see what others thought and it was mostly Crowley worshippers and, in my opinion, cheap rip offs who use the law as a mantra, not a philosophy	but I look
@orchidslantern dip your toes into hermetics?  Now that's something else. I'd even call it my specialty
@orchidslantern general concepts of what it means to me as a whole and how I use it in my life.  I'll shoot you a link if your interested.  I can talk about mysticism ALL day.  Well, most days I do lol		I'll presume you dabble in the other fun stuff too, astrology, cards, magic, etc	Did you ever
@orchidslantern doesn't mean I think their doing it wrong.		That's the inherent beauty of it that I think some "me too'ers" miss.  You can practice how ever the fuck you want.  I actually just did a video for a friend on my philosophy on "do as thou wilt". It's a little long, 2hrs, but it's my
@orchidslantern occultists today.	Like Crowley, levi, blavatsky, heindel, etc. Innovators.	what can I say, some kids wanna grow up and work regular jobs, I wanted to be a full time mystic.	But what I was saying about thelemites.  and don't get me wrong.  just because I don't agree with some
@orchidslantern I spent the last year dedicated to understanding as much of as the occult and esoteric traditions as I can.	I, at a time, was attempting to follow down a similar path to Crowleys.  Not so much as a disciple but more of a contemporary.  		My opinion is that there aren't any great
@orchidslantern Interesting	I have a very deep respect for many of Crowley's philosophies	He is a very big influence on my own studies into mysticism	I've talked to some thelemites that, I felt, didn't understand it as it was intended, but that's just me and my own understanding of crowleys mind
@SadityyyB meet one who actually works properly.  Use them up for what you need and toss them away.
@SadityyyB But consider who your asking the question  to. The idiots who your "giving it up" to, who's own insecurities are driving you to ask that question .		But I suggest, who gives a fuck what they think.  Men are just toys who need someone to control them to even work, and I've yet to
@SadityyyB why is everything about sex? 	Do ppl ever actually connect on an intellectual level?	I got this theory women are more sexed up then they think men are.	Or maybe it's just weak men that make women feel like they have to be that way		But your question.	If it's right, it's right

@lurenathalie @norfshore_ Sometimes what we consider hateful is actually something that we need to hear about ourselves	I'll ask you this,if it wasn't at least partially true why would you let it get to you	Ppl say shit at me all the time, their all correct though, from their perspectives that it	But that

@iamcardib What kind of disgusting things are they telling you	I've been talking to quite a few about putting kids in woodchippers	I didn't think it was the worst idea, kids can be jerks, but so can adults	But I think it's a lot more then just the president fucking this country  up

@JackBatt_ @rubirosajunior that feeling, well I get a sense that's what you think		But think like this.  You are now doing the same thing to someone	now you can't hold it against anyone for doing it to you		But your not hopeless	Sounds like you need a break to get your shit together		Do you feel you aren't
@JackBatt_ @rubirosajunior You want your cake and to eat it too	I dig that,I'm the same way	You said he loves you	But do you love him?

@Coinbagger1 @taylorburrowes But I believe it's because we are trained that way from birth.	We just copy the behavior that we observe. And that goes for those before us and before them and all the way back to a time when every person on the plan acted the opposite of what they do now
@AJA_Cortes @taylorburrowes But all that talk is my own opinion that I learned from my own life experiences.  No one gets to tell me I'm wrong about that.  But if love your insight I how yours is different.  You might be able to reach me something I don't know.	Cheers
@AJA_Cortes @taylorburrowes But you have to realize they both play the opposite game from one another	And most of the time neither one realized it.  But that's due to societal brainwashing.  I'm sure we can all agree that that fucked EVERYONE up
@AJA_Cortes @taylorburrowes You have to on constant watch of the other though.  They trick you with mind games.  subtle clues and hints to confuse you. But if your carefully you can learn to do it right back and beat them at their own game and restore balance.	That goes for me. and women both
@AJA_Cortes @taylorburrowes Their both manipukaters , just different kinds	Each one plays off the weaknesses of the other	Think of it like this, but in a much broader spectrum.	One plays the dom, one plays the sub	Once in a while the roles reverse and things go downhill

I'll make it happen. I don't use money because it's part of a system that I will not partake in unless I have to and right now I am in a position in my life where I do not need to	so here's your homework assignment	It's up to you, I don't give a shit because I
Write it on my own.  The more the merrier.  I have lots of ideas and I like the idea of a few ppl writing their unique version the same story, kind of like paganism, if that makes sense	And that goes to everyone	Where do you want to go in life?
I think this falls under the 1st ammendment.  and most ppl are just going to think I'm a loon.  That's why I'm not really concerned about saying what I'm saying.	Oh and any of my writer friends out there, wanna be famous?  I have a really awesome story but I don't have time to
I don't have the connections but I know ALL the things to say and how to act.  I'm more of an idea guy.	So if anyone wants to set the world on fire but me up.  I have lots of free time.  Unless I get arrested for treason, which is also possible.  But then again

But right now I'm trying to figure out how to infiltrate the system.  I was thinking about going real sneaky and becoming a priest, long story but trust I am confident enough that I believe I could do it, and work my way up the good chain.  Or if I had a priest friend to work

So why do I want to bring it all down?  Because I see just how fucked up we all are.  and we all are fucked up because no a single one of our governments are for us	Look at your life.  Is that what you want to do?  Are you as happy as you want to be?  Are you doing what
All ideas are welcome.  I believe I am intelligent enough to at least come close to pulling this off.	But again, I'm just putting t he intent out there so you can't say I didn't say anything.  Kind of how they do to us, but I'm being literal
As of this moment I am making it publicly known, this way no one can say I didn't warn you, but I am devoting my life to overthrowing the United States government and every other failed system around the world.	I don't know how I'm going to accomplish this get so any and

@AJSaun15 @L0ts0fF @Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Well it depends on a few factors	How much you value human.

@ed2000000000000 @Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Thangs an interesting approach	A little extreme for my taste but I also believe I can see inside ppls minds, so who am I to say what's right or wrong

@girlband777 I think you'll get a kick out of my tagged post
@girlband777 I am completely unfamiliar at this time with xianity.	I personally practice a modge podge of esoteric traditions that I formulated into my own.	I'm not afraid to be challenged or be wrong. I can't be right if I don't fuck up,is my philosophy.	I believe that we all have power
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes @jordanbpeterson But this also plays into my own theories on how karma works.  But that's a story for another time
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes @jordanbpeterson I have a theory that we are all "gifted"	It just developes differently in everyone	But I do believe it involves releasing emotional bonds
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes @jordanbpeterson There's actually a few explanations.  Depends on which is your favorite
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes @jordanbpeterson We can't tAlk when you want.  I specialize in suppressed trauma.  But it's not easy	I taught myself by dealing with myself
@girlband777 Great, I meant treat
@girlband777 I don't hold it against him at all	He has a name, I don't	I can come off as pretentious or twatty at times, though I don't mean it	But he and many others taught me how to not great  ppl who also have been different minds

@Maryamhasnaa How do we summon those destined for us?	And if it's by divine nature how would we miss it or mistake it if it's meant to happen?
@SayItValencia Or rather, what you think I meant
@SayItValencia I take that back you didn't say I was rude.  You called my approach unpleasent.  and I say the same for you interpretation of what I meant
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes Can look at any tweet, I meant
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes Meaning and context are detrimental in my opinion	You and I can any tweet and get 2 completely different meanings, but the person who tweeted it will be pissed at us for not reading it how they intended	and God forbid you ask someone to clarify their meaning	Holy fuck
@SayItValencia But if we are going to point fingers, id say the 2 tweets you deleted were ruder then what I wrote
@SayItValencia Why?	I didn't think I was being rude	I was sharing what your post made me think	I'm sorry if it wasn't the usually agreeable response your used to but I don't think enuf ppl question in the things their told.	I didn't say you were wrong, I was just trying to get on ur level
@girlband777 I actually started taking 1 online becuz I wanted to give you an answer since u may have been 1 of the smarter persons I've talked to in days, long story.	But I remember why I don't like the test b4	The questions and/or answers don't relate to me enough to give a proper response
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes No one is translating it properly and we all end up fighting, like monkeys throwing shit at each other
@girlband777 @taylorburrowes and similar to something you said earlier, we are all talking about 8 billion different languages trying to say the same thing to each other.
@girlband777 @DCnumerology I have a hunch you and me are closer to solving this riddle then anyone else at this point	I'm encouraged that we had similar thoughts though
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Put young hitler I meant
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Oh I didn't know that about the hashtag	Guess that answers that	so I'll ask again, you outraged because you think he really wants to wood chip kids or you mad it was maga kids	Are mad when I say, we should of out going hitler in a wood chipper? Or young staling?  Or young mao?
@girlband777 @DCnumerology That's what I was presuming, I hate not asking the question though	I think too many ppl are in the habit of taking other ppls word without checking to see if the person talking knows what their saying
@taylorburrowes Are these actual things ppl say to each other?	why is it never about an intellectual connection or something deeper then sex with ppl	It sounds like the monkey cages at (insert name of favorite zoo) out there.	and I know at least one of them laughed because I used the word insert
@DCnumerology What's the difference?
@i_like_hats @joncoopertweets @End_TheFederalR I don't care what Mitch McConnell wants	I'm not him	and I don't care if these ppl get real jobs or if they ever get paid again	But you can't complain when you have options and be taken seriously	Does that make sense?

@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey You don't need to explain anything, all im asking is if you know he's talking about the kids you are as he does not specify	Or are you just assuming because it says magakids?		I understand what you think you know, which is why I'm asking why you think you k now
@DCnumerology Is there a time limit on that claim or are you saying any time in the future after Feb 5	because I expect a debate on a new form of government some time after Feb 5 as well.  Don't know when though 	Or you just making a joke that I'm Over thinking

@d_nurnberg @Malamaca1599 @Disney @Jack_Morrissey y do u think that?		Punishment isn't abuse, even if it's a wood chipper.  I just hope there's a good reason for using it		If not, oh well, there's always more kids		Whats more logical to you	That he wants to put kids in a wood chipper or he said it to miss ppl off?
@d_nurnberg I think the first is probably the best as the other stuff doesnt  seem to be working very well	Especially the voting	But I don't participate in politics because I can see through it.  I'm more of an idea guy
@Adolph_Bernanke @Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey If you are referring to me, then you should prolly re-read my reply, slower and cafefully, because I'm not talking about little cowboys and indians.
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Would you be mad if he was talking about kid hitler?	but i'm not outraged, I'm asking a few questions that are being mistaken as outrage because text doesn't express intent properly
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey I don't know what kids your talking about.	The kids with the indians?	I don't follow any fake news that's used to incite ppl	How do you known the kids he's talking about are the same?	He doesn't specify	Perhaps he's talking about other maga kids that did do something wrong
sometimes I think some ppl say things to confuse more easily influenced ppl into liking something they don't understand	But I could be wrong

@DCnumerology Why?	did you skip 2007 on purpose?	Is there a significance that there's 12 yrs in betwixt each year up to 2019  which equals 12, which we  an reduce to 3	3 is the number of creation	Meaning this is a year of creation		But there's a pattern too	1947=3	1959=6	1971=9	83=3	96=6	07=9

@AnOpenSecret I got a feeling there are those out there that wouldnt mind if he was talking about kid hitler, or kid Stalin, or kid Trump or kid obama
@AnOpenSecret Considering that there are those who have sex with children producing films, why not.	It's not like we are running out of kids	and I'm sure there's going to be a few monsters in the future that some folks are going to wish were put into a wood chipper as kids when their older
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Also, does calling him out by name give you a sense of satisfaction or a feeling of dominance of something else?	could you describe it please?
@Malamaca1599 @d_nurnberg @Disney @Jack_Morrissey Are you really outraged or you just mad he said maga		and maybe the kids he's talking about really did do something to deserve getting put into a wood chipper for	He wasn't clear what magakids he was talking about, maybe these were bad ones	Or is that not possible?
@fireox9 @DCnumerology That sounds more like over compensating for a lack of self love, but that's just my opinion	when do you take a break for yourself or better yet give them a break from you?	Unless do you not think there should be breaks?	Breaks to recharge I mean 	and if not why?

@MindTendencies2 it's ironic because to dislike anyone, we're just projecting our dislike of ourselves onto them but since they like themselves it means that our toxic behavior towards them isn't working &amp; a being reflected back at us causing a sort of feedback loop 	am I close to what ur saying?

@ScarletMagdalen Me too.	I think I know which ones you meant though, but I think anyone who reads this discussion will too lol
@ScarletMagdalen I don't believe it's all religion	But I definitely believe it's all 100% brainwashing
@DCnumerology why do you think that
@ScarletMagdalen Im presuming virgin guilt is a theory that not all women prescribe to then, I didn't think so	I believe some women, and some men to,believe that they feel it though		But I don't believe it's anything more then an excuse for something else	4 What?	Could be 4 a lot of things
ppl confuse		And I'm more interested in understanding how this guilt is over come.  It could help
they do not express, even if they are the ones to engage.		I don't have time or motivation to explain it all as it is just a theory and every woman seems to want something different, or so I think.  But I believe that thinking believing and knowing are all different things that
I ask because I have a working theory that it's actually woman who are more inclined to have sex on the brain then men.  But I'm only basing that on my own experiences, which I've seen that they, woman, lose interest if you don't give them the exact attention they want, which
I've never heard of this, but that's probably because I'm a man.  How does one over come that guilt, as it was a choose, in, I would presume, most cases.  What do they typically feel guilty for, a poor experience, inadequate partner/setting, not waiting, something else entirely? https://t.co/95bO1qbeED
@SayItValencia As if your almost encouraging ppl to shut out others	But that's just my interpretation, I have to presume I'm not the only one reading it that way,but I could be wrong
@SayItValencia And maybe it's not even learning as much as expanding on our own ways of thinking	I'm sure we all have something that someone else can use in some way.	Roughly 8 billion unique perspectives	That's a lot to learn		and maybe I'm taking you the wrong way but "if you can" sounds...
@SayItValencia what do you mean, If you can?	don't you think there's always something to learn from others?	I believe Everything happens for a reason, even the ppl we interact w/	I'm not saying throw away your believes for any1 but shouldn't we be learning from other ppls experiences as well?
@taylorburrowes What if the unhealthy person in question is just misunderstood	Wouldn't trying to understand them make more sense then to walk away?	I would imagine understanding them would be a benefit, you never know how many more ppl like that you'll encounter in life	Isn't best to b prepared
@DCnumerology Do you have suggestions for the ppl afraid to take the first step?	Cool truth is good but I don't think most ppl understand how to overcome the fear.  maybe I'm wrong, but I believe that if they did they wouldnt need to be told
@taylorburrowes But who determines who's healthier then who?	someone w/ a degree?	If most of those ppl were as good as they think, there wouldnt be as many unhealthy ppl, but that's my opinion	Or any1 that doesnt like any1 else's behavior, which 9/10 is the same behavior they themselves exhibit
@rubirosajunior But that's just my opinion
@rubirosajunior Maybe you should use this exchange as a lesson of some sort	Because for some one as much a champion as you, resorting to blah blah blah because you won't admit a mistake isn't going to make the pussies and dumbies respect you as the champion I believe you believe you are
@taylorburrowes You don't think we should challenge everything?  Not only what others tell us but also ourselves?		It almost sounds like your saying that no1 has anything to learn from anyone else in what we think we know		I come from the school that the more we think we know, the less we know
@rubirosajunior I know I did but you said I didnt, that's why I wanted to correct you	I care about the wording, I'm not concerned with anyone else	but your words didn't matter, I was just concerned that you tried corrected me by rewording what I said	Unless you didn't realize you did that.
@Maryamhasnaa I just noticed mindos name	Go of that question answered at least
@Maryamhasnaa Is this an official graph?	Who made it, and how are they sure it's exact?	some of it makes sense but I question anything I haven't experienced personally	Are they sure there's only 12, could there be less?  Could there be more?	It just seems too precise in my opinion
@rubirosajunior Does the art of the champion involve voluntarily facing the fear not having a source of income for an extended period of time and relying on your wits alone to conquer it?	That seems like a really scary one that I can't imagine most ppl, if any, have the courage to face
@rubirosajunior You just corrected me saying the same thing I did, just with different words		But I said what I said because you said, "A pussy is he who is not courageous and acts despite being afraid".		Acting in spite of some thing is the same acting despite something are the same thing
@FraserWyllie_ @rubirosajunior It looked like she was confident enuf to know that she wasn't risking her life.  At least to me she seemed pretty sure of her skills.
@Flyguy2stackz @ndza23 Any one in particular?	Or are you speaking for all of them in general or just the "good" ones or just the "bad" ones.  There are a lot of them in all types of sizes and shapes and no shapes
@rubirosajunior You don't consider acting despite of fear as courageous?	How else do you over come fear?	I make myself do the thing I'm afraid of until I'm not afraid anymore	Each time I fail I learn,the more I learn the less afraid I get	Whats your tactic?	Im curious if you have an easier way
@orfray That's a rare insight I never heard outside my own head	Or at least not enough remember hearing
@rubirosajunior Why do you not consider yourself weak?
@rubirosajunior U dont fear any kind of failure?	Ever?	About anything?	I believe everyone is afraid of sumthing, including you and me	But I also believe that fear can be over come	Again that goes back to not belittling others who haven't learned how to do that on their own yet	But that's me
@robbystarbuck @taylorburrowes Maybe it's time to think about expanding the borders	Uncivilized times typically call for uncivilized measures, or no?
@robbystarbuck @taylorburrowes Perhaps it's time to consider that the central American governments may be the problem	Maybe it's time to consider alternative ways of changing their minds	Diplomacy doesn't seem to work	There's gotta be other ideas other then walk or no wall.
@taylorburrowes Unfortunately I have agree as most ppl are going to be afraid of admitting they have an std or are afraid others will think they have an std and potentially spoil their chances at some kind of love	I find that far 2 many ppl have an issue w/ being honest, especially w/ themselves
I don't know about you but I felt fucking amazing tonight after a major release that coincided with the peak of the eclipse, but it made me feel super smart once I got all the heavy stuff out.	I hope I'm right and I hope I'm not the only one	That was amazing
@rubirosajunior And what do you consider a pussy?	I would imagine most ppl who use an alarm clock are folks with 9-5s or in school to some capacity.	Unless you are calling them pussies	Then I would agree with you, but I don't call them names.  I believe they just don't know any better right now
@rubirosajunior What do you consider alive?	Do you often feel the need to be up at 6:12am or was that an arbitrary example?	Do you choose the second as well or That 2 precise?	I ask be cause I consider myself both alive and in tune &amp; I wake up when my body is ready,	But I work when I want
@mtnsbymelody Exactly	I'm trying to figure out if there's a way of changing that without having to compromise for the other person.  Inspiring them to change their minds by ignoring them until they behave		I think of it like putting them in the corner.  and I don't even require a sorry lol

which causes them to shy away.  		But I'm glad you posted this because I never actually thought about this category of ppl and how many ppl I know who could be suffering from this mentality.  I cant imagine a way of approaching this without upsetting the other person, but you
after and sometimes that's doesn't even work.  and sometimes I can't even get them to open up about something as a hobby.  I presume it's to either get over the fact that they believe something that they made up in their head about me or there's something they are ashamed of
trade secrets in psychology?		Learning to reprogram my self to have to courage to not fear talking to anyone was one thing.  but I can't seem to get anyone else to open up about anything unless they know I use tarot cards or read dreams, but then they get freaked shortly there
ask because every person I interact with resents someone for something and I can only imagine how many blame the other person in this this situation. I imagine that happens alot.		 I'm curious what you get their thinking to change to. Unless that's a trade secret?  Are there
ppl to be honest about.  What is the end result of their sessions like?  I would imagine it involves forgiving themselves for being careless and honestly not resenting the other person, if they actually resent the other person at all.  do they often resent than other person? I
position in the first place?  I've seen first hand How deep emotions can go, so I'm curious How far you take it with ppl.		How do you get them to open up in the first place?  and I think thats a general question.  Because that seems like one of the harder things to inspire
took me 7 months of full time self exploration to figure that out.  But what more does it involve then then saying that to ppl.  I have to presume there's a ton of suppress emotions that are involved in this.  Do you dig into the underlying issues that put them in such a
this, and I know it's not the same as their situations but it's similar in that I am the way I am because of a choice that I made and there's nothing I can do about it But learn from it and move on, everything happens for a reason.  I know that's easier said then done.  It
my point, it must be a terribly difficult subject for ppl to cope with.  Especially with the petty and selfish things ppl chose to complain on a daily basis.  I can imagine it feels very lonely at times.  I can relate to the "lonely at times part".  		But, I look at it like
themselves.  I can't imagine that to be a good feeling.		I asked someone once if they had any but they were not happy with me afterwards.  In my defense, I thought I had valid reason to be concerned.  It was actually a funny story, well I think it is anyway.  But I digress		m
insane.  Every single one.		But I never actually thought about this being one of their issues.  I'm not implying everyone I know has an std, but I've been trying to figure out why Every one is so miserable all the time.  I never thought about how ppl with stds thought about
demons(long storg), and I think all of them thought/think in one way or another that I'm just trying to have sex with them or  I think sometimes they want me to be.  I don't think it's normal I think that way, but I'm not shy with my thoughts on ppl.  I think they are all
Now that you mention this and considering how our society is utterly consumed by sex in all aspects of the word, all around the world, I realize that i never actually thought about this.		I've dealt with ppl with depression, anxiety, addiction, family/relationship issues, https://t.co/1MGdN0S5Fx

@PhoenixLoisell2 @jordanbpeterson I come from the school of thought that criticism, especially what we consider negative, has the potential to be the best source of growth	I believe it's difficult to be better if we don't know what we are doing wrong	My opinion is that our biggest "critics" are our best teachers

yourself to fuck up from time to time.  How else are you supposed to learn to not make the same mistake twice?  Or 3 times.  Or how ever many times you found yourself in the loop your stuck in.		I am Derek's ego and I like to act like I know you better then you do.  Probably
afterwards.  I personally believe that it's the ppl who bring out our worst who teach us how to be our best.  But unfortunately some ppl progress faster then others.  so take advantage of that and embrace your flaws.  You can't catch up to everyone else if you don't allow
Bad behavior, mind you, that we are very quick to point out in those around us.		Next time you think someone is attacking you, think for a moment or 2 that maybe, that "toxic" person is actually looking out for you.  And if you really want to over come some shit, thank them
society we call them toxic.  		Maybe, just maybe,we call them toxic because we don't want to hear the bad things about our selves that we are hiding from.  The bad things that make us toxic to them.  Our own bad habits that cause the ppl around us to emulate our own bad behavior.
right, why are you mad at them?  They didn't do it to you, they are just pointing out something that they know isn't you.  Can you actually blame some one for caring about you enough to risk your wrath to tell you what they think might be holding you back?  I believe in today's
that ppl point out about you that get you mad?  Ask yourself why it gets you mad. Is it because their wrong?  I don't believe that.  If they are wrong then there's nothing to be mad at, just a simple misunderstanding. 		Or, are you mad because they are right?  But if their
But i had to let myself be afraid in front of ppl I didn't know to build the courage to be afraid in front of the ppl I did know.  		So what flaws do you have? You can't say you don't know or don't have any.  Here's an easy way to figure some out.  What are some of the things
from the fear of being vulnerable with ppl.  Which stemmed from some mommy or daddy issues.  But acknowledging that I was afraid was just the first step in conquering that fear.  I needed to face it.  I needed to show ppl that I knew, a side of me that I never did before.
rest of Derek's flaws that he doesnt feel like typing out. 		I don't think ppl acknowledge their flaws enough.  		In my opinion our flaws are like a mental/emotional road map of finding who you really are.  I, for instance, always had communication problems, which stemmed
Derek's shyness.  I am Derek's rage.  I am Derek's addictions .  I am Derek's selfishness.  I am Derek's codependent behavior.  I am Derek's narcissism.  I am Derek's suicidal thoughts.  I am Derek's apathy.  I am Derek's sociopathic behavior.  I am Derek's jealousy.  I am the
I am Derek's impulsivity.  I am Derek's lack patience.  I am Derek's need to be noticed.  I am Derek's mania.  I am Derek's depression.  I am Derek's anxiety.  I am Derek's need for instant gratification.  I am Derek's frustration.  I am Derek's lack of self confidence.  I am

@jeepthing96 Them I think you'll get a kick out of this...the word nice comes from the Latin word nescius, which means ignorant
@MindSovereignty Did all of that even make sense, I don't know if I expressed that properly
@MindSovereignty and say things I was once afraid of doing.  Granted that my story, I don't imagine you'll say the same thing, I'm just curious if you are able to relate to learning aspect.
@MindSovereignty Not being open.  It took me a few months to learn how to fully get over the fear of being vulnerable to someone to the levels needed for me to be confident that I'm ready to try a relationship again.  A few months and several panic attacks.  Forcing myself to do and...
@MindSovereignty I was able to admit to myself that she was only doing what I was doing to her.  and I was only doing because I was afraid to be vulnerable enough to share my emotions when I felt them.  Not just with her eitger, I bottled everything up and took my aggregation out on her by...
@MindSovereignty I feel that	Your a rare breed	I'm curious if your method is similar to mine	I found that forgiveness comes with a lesson to be learned.  For instance, my last relationship ended because of no real communication, if the emotion all kind.  I blamed her for a time until...

@obscuree_ I'll try but my knowledge is my opinion based on my personal experience up to this moment, and it's not popular, but I like a challenge	If you can learn all the lessons that the universe has thrown at you and use that strength to truly let go of, at honestly admit...
@MindSovereignty In my experience, if you can learn to forgive yourself you don't need to forgive anyone else	It just is, if you get me	But that's my experience
@Stubtastic @LivPsy If you allow the emotions to run their course without suppressing them, they will go away on their own.	But you have to allow your mind to take to places that you don't want to go	It's not easy, but fully doable	But again, that's based on my experience with myself
@NVitalogy @LivPsy Always do a good job of explaining things like this
@NVitalogy @LivPsy Sense.  Suicidal thoughts are common in the early stages	But, how many ppl have never thought about that at least once in their lives.  Most, I believe are just afraid to admit they have.	So If I explain that in an understandable way.	It's a big concept and text doesnt...
@NVitalogy @LivPsy What ever label we put on it	I liken all "mental disorders" as phases of our conscious evolutions	 but my mind has been to places not many ppl like to mess with.  But once the process starts it doesn't stop until you clear out all emotional baggage.  It is NOT easy in any...
@NVitalogy @LivPsy Fear that is being triggered.	I hope that made sense 	But again, this is based off of my own studies of allowing myself to face all of my fears when they surface	I say fear because, in my opinion, it's the fear of the resurfacing emotion that we call depression or anxiety or...
@NVitalogy @LivPsy Make you aware of a past trauma.  And in doing so, teaching you to learn to avoid a similar trauma by objectively looking at the original situation that made you suppress the emotion in the first place.	But I'm order to do so, you have to let yourself experience the...
@NVitalogy @LivPsy It's a weird concept for sure	The best way I can think to explain it is to allow the depression to run it's course rather then trying to suppress the emotion attached to it	Imagine for a moment that depression is a defense mechanism of the subconscious mind that's trying to...

@Maryamhasnaa Def not easy	and it takes a lot of patience
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 Again your dead on	I attribute it to ppls inability to detach from their ego minds and accepting their way isn't the only way, in a respectful manner of course, if at all
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 I'm only certain because of where I've been &amp; what I know, which is based on my experience &amp; perspective	8 billion ppl = 8 billion perspectives	8 billion perspectives = 8 billion realities	I like being able 2 take a peak into other realities from time 2 time	Theres lots 2 learn
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 Your right again	but I don't look at it as arguing, I look at it like sharing opinions with ppl I normally wouldn't	I find ppl with differing opinions more interesting then ppl that agree with everything I say	I learn more that way
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 Be wise = because
@Wisethedome But truth comes from experience	My truth isn't your truth and yours isn't mine	There's a saying that every truth is a half lie and every lie is a half truth	Which side you end up hearing is based on perspective and perspective is only the reality of those who are perceiving it
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 again your correct	It's a fact to me be wise what I know	I only say what I know	I'm sure we'll agree that just because it's a true to me doesn't mean it's true for you	This is a good lesson in perspective for both of us
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 Correct	and just because it isn't yours doesn't mean I'm wrong	It just means you haven't learned that lesson, yet	But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 You are 100% correct	But I believe in my opinion
@poeticglory @A2DaK306 Yes, that and he did something to deserve it and didn't do anything to prevent it

@jeepthing96 @xirtempest i definitley hope you watch that video and read that book i linked.  simulation theory has its foundation based in the hermtic principles.  the concept is alot older then most ppl would be willing to admit
@jeepthing96 @xirtempest this is a pretty good primer if your interested, its about an hour, but its more then enough to whet your palet without commiting to reading the book with no back ground one what the hermetic principles are	you got a brain that i think will get them	https://t.co/WVl8Pt8e1J
@jeepthing96 @xirtempest alchemy is just one name for it	its a little hard ot explain, but make believe for a moment, that all religions, esoteric traditions and philosophies were saying the exact same thing, just using different language	its a little bit of an abstract idea
@jeepthing96 @xirtempest not saying thats your wildest desire, but i think you get what i mean.	but you existance is only limited to your dreams.  but, nothing is for free.  you gotta work for every little thing you want. think of it like the ultimate virtual reality simulation
@jeepthing96 @xirtempest and thats the beauty of it.  your not wrong and neither am i.	and neither is anyone else	existance is exactly what you believe it is	you want ot believe life is about getting a good job, making a shit ton of money and paying off your bills until your ready to retire..so be it...

@jeepthing96 @xirtempest i dont want to say followers but i think thats the best way to explain it.  but my interpretation of a follower in this instance is someone who thinks for themself, instead of like a religion where you would think what i tell you.  that make sense?	i can try again if you need

no tom.  but thats all i lied about.  this story though isnt real.  at least i dont think it is, it will prove if i can actualy read mind thought eventually.  it could all be in my head, but thats the cool part about what i do, its to get the weird fucked up stuff in my head out
shit to get off his chest and i tell other ppl so they get inspired to get shit off their chest.  its like therapy, but better, because it actually works.   he and i share fucked up stories all the time in an attempt to help each other get over our issues		ok i lied.  there is
anything at all.  it might not.  but if it does, i would really appreciate it.  its part of a project im working on.    dont feel obligated.  someone will eventually lol		im going to call my friend tom for right now.  tom isnt looking for advice or for pitty.  tom tells me this
.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	ok the pussies are gone.  i have one request.  you dont have to play if your not comfortable but you made it this far.  if you could do me a solid and just let me know if you felt something.  could be some feeling you had suppressed, or if it made you feel
help you unsuppress something thats buried in you.  i dont need to know.  i didnt even like hearing this shit.  	i dont know what what or if this is going to trigger an emotion in your or not, so if you dont want to fuck around then stop reading now	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.
able to relate too much.  there were some things i had a hard time thinking about when i was hearing this so im curious if anyone else has ever had to feel this way or something similar.  and im curious if by reading this you are going to think of something difficult as well to
warning you because somes times our experiments have interesting results.  and this one, i think is going to be a doosy.  it wasnt easy for me to even get this out of him and he usually doesnt give a fuck.		but he has an issue i tried helping him with. it wasnt easy not being
i know thats how i was, and i remember when i did, i acted like most of the ppl i know.		a friend of mine told me a story.  he said i could tell it if i didnt say his name.  but we like to do thought experiments on each other and sometimes we like to do them on strangers.  im
im very curious about this.  i dont think ppl talk about it at all. im wondering why.  	i feel like by talking about it, im not going to hold on to it.  i have a theory that all of our bad feelings come from us not saying the things that we feel and keeping them bottled up.
@ChurchofSatan maybe its just me	if you put as much faith into nothing as someone else puts into a religion, whats the difference?  a sign that says, "I DONT BELIEVE" is the same as holding a sign that says, "I BELIEVE".  both signs are just looking for attention, but thats just my opinion
@ChurchofSatan its my real feeling that its insane to accept someones feeling as wisdom
very smart https://t.co/WezHwqfNxk
@dogma_vat @taylorburrowes and dont be fooled, materialism is just as much a religion as anything else.  its just that the god that is being worshipped takes the form of a piece of paper with a number on it
@dogma_vat @taylorburrowes well i think thats pretty self evident as sprituality and religion both, typically, take the stance that, and i agree, more stuff = less happy and more happy = less stuff	ppl forgot that money is a tool, not a way of life
@MindSovereignty it was an interesting experience
@MindSovereignty im sorry, it was 1 month.
@MindSovereignty i did for 2 months, but i was also hanging alone in the woods alot during that time so i could clear my head.  it worked wonders

@realDonaldTrump when the law makers are the ones writing the laws for their own compensation i think theres a problem
@ReverieHippie being kind and being nice are 2 different things, at least in my opinion.	the word nice comes from the latin word nescius which means ignorant.
@DanielorRico @DCnumerology thanks for the explanation.  i that makes sense
@taylorburrowes but thats just my opinion
@taylorburrowes and i think thats a major challenge for many ppl	too much focus on STUFF and $$, not enough focus on self care and being truly happy with ourselves.  but we still live in a culture that believes it needs money to survive, which isnt wrong, but its not right either, it a choice
@Ladydadda1 @ChurchofSatan exactly.  he said it himself, "I speak in parable"	theres clearly much cherry picking of wuts literal &amp; whats	im curious if they would consider this one literal too, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword"
@norfshore_ @__ggab i thought so, just wanted to make sure	i believe the journey is both fixed and mutable at the same time	like free will and destiny had a baby	that we all have a path to follow but the universe allows us to customize the experience with the choices that we get to decide to make
@taylorburrowes i love that question, "whats stopping you"	most popular answer ive heard is money	but if you ask ppl to take money out of the equation, for argument sake, the answer is usually procrastination, of some sort.	but procrastination, i believe, comes from being afraid to fail
@norfshore_ @__ggab in what way do you mean journey?  spiritual?

this is a partial lie	not all of those "in the occult", which it isnt a group by the way, summon beings.	but i would say from my experience that there ALOT more ppl in the general public doing the same, and more frequently, without even realizing it. https://t.co/0DjuZIPGRR

@Ladydadda1 @ChurchofSatan whats really weird is that ppl take mythology literally	now, if looked at from a metaphorical or analogical stand point, it tells a completely different story.  but thats the problem with religionists, they dont know how to use the right side of their brain to see stuff
@mtnsbymelody doesnt exist anymore.  Most of Dicks books, if your not familiar, typically share the shame theme of the protagonist waking up to a world that isnt what they went to bed to.   Paranoia, schizophrenia, being really big themes in every book.  every book is a mind fuck
@mtnsbymelody im in the middle Cry My Tears, The Police Man said by Phillip K Dick, my most favoritist writer of all time	im only a little way through, but its about a celebrity tv personality that wakes up one day in a strange bed in a strange town and the person who he thought he was...
@EllaIsYourQueen @LSHager this may be a cliche way of putting it, but are you familiar with the movie the matrix?
@MindSovereignty i wont make the same mistake again, if they come back or with the ppl that replace them.  and im cool with that because i know im going to enjoy myself eitherway, and those temporarily gone,  i will still think of and feel for those ppl of the past, w/o grudges
@MindSovereignty isnt popular with friends and family.  that being, taking time for myself.  3 months with no contact.  i had alot of layers i need to peel away lol.	but i recognize, i did it, so i cant be mad at those i lost along the way, but i learned enough about myself that...
@MindSovereignty and speaking of being wrong, i think i could of worded my first couple comments better	getting away from ppl, being alone.  thats what allowed me to find the time and strength do deal with my own issues	it was near impossible with every day stress	unfortuantely doing that...
@MindSovereignty it took work though, i had to conquer MANY fears in myself to be able to even admit the words, i could be wrong.  but i believe, if you can honestly say those words, you can do anything.  except fly.  i dont know if that works yet.
@MindSovereignty im sure ull agree to an extent, but i dont limit myself to a single belief.  i have a multitude	i test them &amp; move on.  either they work the way i want or i adjust or a let it go and move on to the next one	some call it being a hypocrite, i call it being able to admit i was wrong
@MindSovereignty i agree with that state whole 150% though my comments may not reflect that	whether they realize it or not, being divine	everything happens for a reason, even the "negative" ppl.  who arent even negative, they are that way for a reason, to teach us something about ourselves.
@DCnumerology the complete thought of where im going with this is still brewing in my head, but i wanted to get an opinion on the cyclical nature of the idea
@DCnumerology u may b able to anser a question for me or maybe confirm a concept ive been visualizing regarding numerology	very basic, but i dont know any numerologists	1 = 10, i know it reduces	what i picture in my mind is like a clock almost, numbered 1-9	reaching 10 would be going back to 1
RT @AudreyKitching: There is a lot of clarity starting to pour in. These divine downloads are brining us so much new knowledge and informat‚Ä¶
@MindSovereignty they find the courage in themselves to do the same thing.  and if not, oh well.  everyone is temporary.  everyone is replacable.  we cant hold on to the past forever.  instead, again in my opinion, embrace change.  embrace flushing the shit out of your life on a regular basis
@MindSovereignty is anyone else inspiring you to be the best you can be for you or do they inspire you to be the best you for them?	my experience was living in a world were everyone was a victim, including me.  i didnt want to be anymore.  my success will be reflected by the ppl i cared for when
@MindSovereignty thats one way to look at it.  i believe the best way to love everyone is to love yourself.  no one else is going to take care of you the way that you are.  and no one else will be there for you as much as you are.  and chances are, when you need them, their busy w/ something else
@MindSovereignty granted, if they want to come along for the ride, awesome.  but if not, get the fuck out of the way and let me be me.  but thats a scary concept for most ppl, i believe at least.  it was scary for me, so i know its scary.  but i did it, unfortunately on my own, but i did it
@MindSovereignty perhaps this is implied, but i think all we need is self love.  to love ourselves enough to get out of what ever situation we are in that makes us feel unloved, because, and i mean this in all sincerity, fuck everyone else.  even our family.  even our friends and even our kids
@XXXistentiall if you want to try a unconventional procress that doesnt involve a doctor or drugs let me know.	im comletely unlicensed and everything i do is based off of mysticism	but it worked like a fucking charm for me	its just not easy to do	and you can do it all by yourself
@XXXistentiall your not alone	i can relate to everything you said, even the YT channel, which i laughed when i saw that.	i look at it ike this.  the ppl in my life, the real fucking crazies, cant relate to me.  tehy want to be koo koo birds.  i dont	im weird but i own it
@4bidden444 its not a lifestyle for the meek, i can assure you that.  not saying your meek.  but its scary as fuck	i walked away from my house, family and job to see how far this shit goes	universe hasnt let me down yet.	but thats just my experience.  i say never follow my lead lol

@__ggab i think that everyone that comes into our lives are soul mates.  ppl come together, they learn some stuff and move on.  but the lessons to be learned are more then just some subject.  its more of a emotional/spiritual lesson that needs to be learned	but thats just my opinion
all of your worst nightmares are real.  and they are all hiding under the bed waiting for you to go to sleep at night so they can scare the shit out of you.
@4bidden444 just not so much with money
@4bidden444 there are ways of living with out a job and money.  i do it.  i havent had income in 3 months.  its about really figureing out what you want and what you need and determining if you really need the things you think you do.  its scary AF, but if you trust the universe, it pays

@taylorburrowes @SayItValencia i feel compelled to admit that i hadnt taken the time to watch the video yet, i was voicing an observation on the use of the word narcissist as a generalization that i had thought about a few weeks back. but i am glad you responded because i absolutley agree with what your saying
@ScarletMagdalen i def cannot claim to understand the rationale behind that way of thinking.	ppl say weird stuff sometimes
@ScarletMagdalen well i think our quite rational	next time some one tries to push your buttons, tag me in before you get heated.  i have a unique way of inspiring ppl to see that theirs isnt the only way to think üòâ	i have alot of free time
@ScarletMagdalen youd be surprised how quicly ppl lose their motivation to troll when you tell them their right.  it like a little short circuit to their brains lol
@ScarletMagdalen well thats a completely different story	but wise man once say, best way to win an argument with a fool is to agree with him
@SayItValencia @taylorburrowes this is just an observation i made.  by pointing out that someone is a narcissist arent we projecting on to them our own narcissistic behaviors?	i mention that because i have to presume that a narcissist doesnt see themselves as a narcissist.  just a thought
@ScarletMagdalen look at it this way.  at least the randos are trying to actively participate in the exchange of ideas with others, as mundane as they appear	at least to me it seems more productive then most of the useless crap that ppl distract themselves with ever day	but thats just my opinion
@electricfire89 no problem.  where did i lose you?  sometimes i tend to explain things in a way that makes sense to me but not others
@abductionsandco but i also recognize that those projecting onto us have something to change in themselves as well. when ppl critique me i try to remember the saying, dont throw the baby out with the bath water	though most of it is negative opinion, there may be a pearl of wisdom in the shit
@abductionsandco i believe everything happens for a reason	even the way ppl treat us	i try to look at it like this sometimes, but i could be wrong	maybe ppl pointing out our flaws is a way of the universe telling us that theres something we need to fix in ourselves.  but again, thats my opinion
@realbasedamy @thebestcloser arent they the police?	im just playing devils advocate because its a very short video, but do you not think that that is something that would happen in the US under similar circumstances?
@TeaBoots are they accomplishing anything though?	i havent been following this	are they looking to reform the entire system?  or just the financials?
@patten_life is this their actual check list?	or did you formulate it yourself based on opinions?	i understand you probably have a good reason for thinking this way but some ppl reading it may not be capable of discerning your sarcasm.  text doesnt isnt good at showing intent all the time
100%	üëáüëáüëá https://t.co/McZbpOK1Iq
@astrobebs everything happens for reason.  thats pretty cool story though
@electricfire89 i agree w/ you to an extent	but i believe we need more ppl coming up with solutions to change the way we think as a whole	which i also believe is difficult because i think for the most part we are conditioned to think that there are only 2 solutions to any issue	but thats just me
@GRYFFINDORMUG do you feel pressured?  i agree that societal norms dont do a very good job at guiding our youths, but societies flaws are what make the virtues of ppl like your self shine.
@Kica333 try out this trick, if you havent already.  think back on whats gone wrong so far.  figure out what you can learn from those negative experiences to better arm yourself to avoid them when they happen again	but thats my opinion, its not for everyone	i think you got this though
@rubirosajunior @DCnumerology for a reason.  everything, including the things ppl say to us and what we say to them	your break down of conscious planning out an exchange in real time is impressive to see someone formulate so articulately and spot on, based off of my own experiences.  glad i saw this post
@rubirosajunior @DCnumerology i enjoyed it very much thank you.  i woke up yesterday with a phrase in my mind.  its one that ive been practicing from studying the esoteric, but it summed itself up very nicely in my unconsicous mind	"think in terms of metaphor and analogy"	i like to say everything happens...
@DCnumerology im not a ball sport fan, but i like your analogy	spot on
@trey_wing6 and you thought you had mental issues lol.	cuz i would bet that went over a few ppls heads lol
@rubirosajunior @DCnumerology and if you can objectively look at what they said, you may even be able to learn a little bit about your self, but thats my opinion based off of my experiences
@trey_wing6 see what i did there lol
@Pinkomomma @MuhammadSmiry why?  because you didnt like one of my opinions?  i think it would of been rude if i laughed.  pointing out the obvious is not mean, in my opinion.  i call it thinking critically and not accepting someones perspective based skewed version of an anecdote as gospel
@EllaIsYourQueen conversing with interesting ppl with similar and even better ideas then we had.

@RonMexi96342349 if they did that, then the ppl wouldnt have anything to argue about.  but i agree with you
RT @SilverStarSiri: @toksikshok Yes :) contradiction is Unity. What you have said is of grave importance		Some become too prideful in their‚Ä¶
@SilverStarSiri i thought that, but unfortunately for those ppl, they dont get to have interesting conversations like this
@trey_wing6 that was something i was wondering too lol
@MuhammadSmiry did anyone ask the sniper why he shot your friend	perhaps there was a good reason.	i believe that everything happens for a reason.  perhaps your friend had it coming.  again not a popular opinion but im not a fan of anecdotes
@steph93065 is anyone really ever a victim though?	every "negative" experience is something to learn and grow from	sadly some ppl dont realize that and get stuck in a "bad" situation, but i thats their own faults.  thats my opinion at least, i could be wrong
@MiseryIsGreen and shes a genius if she only associates with other ppl with boundaries.  but i think thats self evident, you seem smart
@realDonaldTrump perhaps a constitutional republic isnt going to cut it anymore.  but thats just my opinion.  i woke up and i see things a little different then some ppl sometimes.  and sometimes the least popular opinion is the best one, unless someone has a better one?
@NewdAstro again, just my personal technique.  its not for everyone.  and who knows, maybe, after getting it out, you might find a good reason why you should wait to reach out to him.  good luck
@NewdAstro thats the point, your arent going to see him for a minute.  do you want to hold all of that emotion in or do you want to get it out of you.  and remember, the first draft may not be the right thing to say to him.  but at least if you have it out, you can edit to down to wut is
@RonMexi96342349 and in my opinion a border is nothing but a concept made up by a monkey to declare ownership on something that is not any ones to own.	but ppl like control other ppl and the way they think and act, just like giving ppl opinion as fact
@RonMexi96342349 well it matters if you are claiming this batch came form the border and it did not	thats not being fake news	and do you have actual proof of where 95% is coming from or is it hear say based off of what someone told you by fake news?	there is a difference, and i think u know that
@NewdAstro but thats how i roll.  its not for everyone.  if you do try it though, i would be interested in hearing how it worked for you	the trick behind it is to get the emotions that are bottled up in you, out.  if that makes sense
@NewdAstro first, never apologize, you owe no one nothing	ive been in this spot	heres my advice.  get a piece of paper or word processor.  write him a letter.  get out everything you want to say.  EVERYTHING.  after your done, reread it and decide if thats what you really want to tell him
if ai is slowly displacing ppls jobs, and will continue to do so over the years, wouldnt it be a good idea for ppl to start learning skills that machines cant do?	but thats just my opinion.  some ppl think i think too much
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump but doesnt that require more then one branch of the government to come up with a mutually benefitial solution?  alot of you ppl seem to think that your constituents want to hear you point fingers then say things that are semi intelligent and constructive to the problem at hand
@DeplorableTrump perhaps government reformation should be the next topic of discussion	but that would involve ppl thinking rather then pointing fingers
@UppityWilliamP but look at it this way, at least he didnt fall into a pool of hungry piranha	instead he may only have a slight concussion with a sprinkling of brain trauma	it could always be worse
@SilverStarSiri i may be interpreting what your saying the wrong way.	i found, 4 myself, that contradiction was my greatest asset	to be able to admit that i was wrong and learn from that experience and readjust my truths based on the new data.  but again, thats just my opinion
@Numerology2019 but, playing devils advocate, being with those that bring out the stress should be teaching us how to better handle and conquer our stresses.  but theres more then one way of skinning a cat.  my methods arent for everyone and they dont always work, but i think thats the point
@PyramidRealm 100%	but i also believe that if ppl were fully comfortable with their truths they wouldnt be against admitting the 4 magic words...i love these words	I COULD BE WRONG	i believe those words will change the world one day
@RonMexi96342349 did the particular strain of fentanyl come from over the border?
@gkd34in i would take that a step further to say that energy is the only form, but energy, in my opinion, comes in all shapes, sizes and densities.  but thats just my opinion.  i could be wrong

@taylorburrowes what i do, is make myself face those buried fears	but i do it in a variety of ways	i write, i record myself talking about it, or just get comfy and let the emotions take me to see what it is i need to see to learn and move on.  but again, this is just my exper.	evry1 is different
@taylorburrowes what do you suggest for those who dig deep?	in my personal experience, digging is the easy part.  facing that we actually have something to learn from the experience and need to move on though is where i think ppl get stuck.  but thats just my opinion

@rickygervais but you also cant take away the free speech of those who want to suppress others free speech either or you end up just like them.  which i dont believe you are, but there are ppl out there that think that way.  im sure youve seen it before

@tiakolbert 	would you believe if i said that i was just think about you a few hours ago?  i was even indirectly talking about to someone on twitter lol.  funny how that works
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty ü§£
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty if your afraid of homework, then yes, home work will haunt you until you get over it.  did i just give you a homework assignment a week or 2 ago?  funny how that works isnt it
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty bothered doing this was do start a business so i did have to work a shitty job for a shitty boss so i could be cool with my family instead of being a jerk off to everyone.  but i just kept pissing ppl off and getting new ideas.  so my plans expanded alot form where they were
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty i cants prove that yet, i need ot talk to a couple ppl i used to work with on some of this stuff ive been doing.  should be interesting to see how things go.  who knows.  maybe well all be rich before the year is over.  that would be cool right?  cause the only reason i even...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty thats why i always say to write if you can.  it helps get the shitty thoughts out of your head and help you over come the fear on your own.  but thats based off of my personal experience.  not many ppl follow through on for like i did.  well, i can prove that, i need to ask...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty my ego flairs, but again, im better then other ppl at controling it.  unfortunately through text the words come off as being a dick sometimes.  well more then if you were talking to someone in person.  text does carry intent properly when you rush at it
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty well, most ppl.  your going to tell who i piss off because they will respond with how i am wrong or they will get defensive.  and thats not just for this thread.  you can see it everywhere. but its a normal fear based response.  it a challenge to the ego.	again natural...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty and talk them down to a cool level then getting pissed off.  but that takes a lot of ego control, which is another aspect of this.  it teaches you to retrain the ego and have full control of it.  or so is the theory.  i believe i can do it better then anyone else...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty exactly, plus, if no one ever takes the time to read the books and prove me wrong, they cant ever challenge a single thing i say without some really solid proof.  thats why i dont bother argue unless i have no one to talk to lol.  its easier to piss someone off and...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty but different strokes for different folks.  liek i said, good, bad, cool, its all subjective to teh individual.  you can take it as far as you want or not.  but, again, i dont know if this is a voluntary experience yet.  i dont think it is but will find out what day
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty does that make sense.  the episodes are usually a sign that you are going to be tested on the thing that you just had the shakes over.  you can take that how ever you think i mean it, because your probably right.  im not asking anyone to believe.  thats not my problem...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty its literally based on what you want to believe.  do you want to believe you dont deserve the things you want?  thats ok, its up to you.  your allowed ot believe wht you want.  but to get what you want you have to work for it.  the more you want, the greater the fear you face...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty but once you teach yourself to get over it and forgive yoursel shit gets cool.  cool is subjective to the individual.  cool for me may not be cool for you and vice versa	a friend of mine put it best once, "i may not believe what you believe, but i believe that you believe"...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty when i say everythign happens for a reason i mean it every time.  real life is crazy as fuck.  way fucking crazier then ppl think.  but its a cool crazy.  its not as scary as ppl think.  you gotta be afraid for a little bit and admit to yourself that, yes, you fucked up one time
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty exactly, which is why i need ppl to help me dumb it down.  i got half of first one typed out, not a lot, about 20000 words.  i had to hand write them all, just in case.  long story.  and i fucking hate typing
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty but i like to say everythign that comes to my mind because you never know whats going to be useful to someone who may be reading it, if someoen ever reads it.  does that make sense?
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty but i dont know if this is a voluntary experience.  you ahve to fully accept that everythign happens for a reason to understand that.  again, that may be hard for some ppl to expect, thats why i say if it happens again.  i know i could be wrong about everything i say...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty learn the new concepts.  the new concpets teach how to beat teh never level of fears and challenges.  to get you to do the things you are afraid to do to achieve your goals by teaching you how to not want to do the bad stuff.  remember, bad is subject to the individual..
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty i over exagerating about the burning at the state lol.  i think.  thats really the only thing i get paranoid about anymore, but its not as crazy as it sounds when you over think it.  but tahts the point.  to recognize that your worst fears are possible.  thats why you need to..
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty google the cartoon sometime.  something tells me its gonna blow your mind lol.  the live action sucks ass.
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty why i want ppl to tear the book.  i want ppl to try to prove me wrong.  because i might be.  and it would be a huge help to know what i need to fix.  and thats because im not afraid to be mocked or ridiculed.  thats why i force myself to over come fear.  cause im weird AF lol
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty 100 ppl studying them in varying degrees, including myself.  all which is fully documented but i need i need to get permission to translate some data to make sense.  my believe, and i recognize, this could just be my ego, but i think its going to change the world...but thats...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty i know i have.  the 3 of us arent the only ones reading this.  most ppl are too afraid to talk about thsi stuff so they make believe to ignore it.  you can tell because they strt acting funny.  you see their egos flair a little bit and they get defensive.  i worked with over..
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty a fear.  but if im right about a fraction of the things i talk about its going to make something cool happen.  the level of cool depends on how much of what i wrote makes sense to ppl.  if it does oh well.  i got other shit im working too.  i spend my time wisely
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty which reminds me, i need a volunteer or 2 or 3 or 100 to read them to make sure they make sense.  its hard to edit, when your the only person who has an opinion on it.  so when i say read it, i need ppl to tear into it and tell me whats wrong with it.  hows that for overcoming...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty unique to the individual.  well thats my theory.  but i have pretty solid evidence that many of my theories are correct.  and i have alot.  i fit alot of works on 700 pages
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty exactly.  it scares you with literal fears to teach you better concepts of getting over those fears. that maybe a little bit of an abstract concept, but thats what i mean. the point of the episodes, as i call them, is to literally make you smarter.  but in a way thats totally...
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty those are the tame ones.  remember when i told you i wrote those books?  i had to burn one for a reason.  its a long story.  thats why i burnt it.  there was no way to explain it in a way that keep me from getting burned at the stake.  i took it to an extreme not many ppl have
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty ü§£	you ever watch the tick?  i think im gonna start calling you aurther lololol
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty you gonna be around tomorrow?  i got a shit ton a questions that could really help me out. its your time, so you let me know when you can be free.  doesnt have to be tomorrow either, im patient af.  and you are allowed to say no
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty lol dont worry i was just fucking with you
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 i didnt know how to explain it properly for a while and i was scaring the fuck out of ppl lol.  long story.  but again, you ever need me and youll know when if you ever do.  never hesitate.  believe me when i say ive been there.  be good adn please keep me updated either way
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 ive been working by myself for 7 months without a job trying to figure out how to help ppl get thru the hard parts so they dont ahve to do the really hard stuff on their own, if they choose not to.  i dont force what i do.  thats why i try to be open about it...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 this may sound weird.  but the key to overcoming them is a very simple concept.  its like a game.  look at that thing that its trying to scare you with.  the game is to figure out why it scares you so that you can make it stop scaring you forever....
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 until you start to get the chills and shakes and your muscles fight you while your mind is trying to drive you insane.  its because your insane and your mind is trying to fix itself by for you to feel the negative emotion its trying to show you.  theres a system to it though...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 to try to distract your self with stuff.  phones, games, tv, ppl, work, bills.  your brain washing to be afraid to say fuck it adn let go of the shit holding you back from doing what you want in life.  its scary, but it usualy starts small and get bigger and bigger...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 the further you take it.  but take that how you will.  but it actually stops sucking at one point if you just listen to what its showing you.  if a natural defense mechanism that is forcing you to over come your fears.	thats why your scared alot.  thats why you constantly want...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 everyone differently.  you ever wonder why everyone you know acts like they have a mental disorder?  ever wonder if you had one?  do you have one?  i know i talk weird sometimes, but tahts because i went further then most ppl are comfortable going. it only gets harder the...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 but all my knowledge of this is my own experience.  like i said i never met anyone willing to admit it was happening to them as well.  i thought most ppl were just afraid to talk about it besides me.  theres some, but they only talk to certain ppl.  its happening to...
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 no i didnt think you did, i was making a joke with trey.  no offense meant.  believe, i know exactly what your going thru.  and i meant it when i said that if it comes back and you cant deal with it, let me know.  i cant prove it any way other then words right now
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty before when? today?
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 later man.  good luck.	later gator
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty well you talk to me.  what you do think?  am i crazy?
@trey_wing6 @MindSovereignty this is happening to you too?
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 like i said in another comment, ive been studying this for a while.  i have a couple questions but first i need to know when it passes.  again, like i said, youll know when it does.  take care.  oh and one more tip.  dont be afraid to feel scared.
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 let me know when you cant	be good	and heres a pro tip for the next round.  write down whats going on in your head.  everything you can.  youll know when it finally passes.  let me know when that happens if you dont mind.  im the only person i know who openly goes thru this
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 ive been working on studying it for the last 7 months.  yes i learned how to over come it.  but its not always easy.  sometimes it sucks.  but like i said, if you try to suppress it, it only comes on harder
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 theres a couple things happening at once
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 but your going to have to trust that i know more about this then you do right now.  deal?  all i ask in return is you help me get more ppl to take me serious.  easy peasy, livin greasy
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 im going to have you explain everything going on in your head.  even the stuff you dont want to talk about	you dont have to, its up to you.  but i think i should be able to at least get you to a point youll be able to take care of your self  for a little while	if you want
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 ok.  im not telling you that this is what you have to do, but im about to go to bed.  if you wnt me to stay up and walk you through this, dm me.  im going to grab a cig real quick.  but im going to ask you to do shit that you may not be comfortable with.
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 did you have a consciousness expanding experience recently?  possibly psychedelic?  pot counts.  or possibly some other euphoric experience not involving?
@MindSovereignty @trey_wing6 i go thru this on a regular basis	how long did it last?	if there is an emotion going through your head b4, during, and/or after, dont try to suppress it, it will come back stronger	but dont take my word for it.  let me know when/if it happens again and ill help you out if i can

@jordanbpeterson but again, thats my experience.  i spend my days forcing myself to conquer the fears that once held me back.  most of which stem from innate fears from the past.  by facing those fears/challenges they became less scary each time until it just became part of me.

@4bidden444 @MrAstrotheology to something very specific gong on in your life.  as you read the words youll probably notice yourself getting distracted with images.  explore what your mind is showing.  its a neat trick someone taught me some time ago
@4bidden444 @MrAstrotheology next time you ahve a chance, try this thought experiment.  open the bible to any of jesus's parables, as he said himself, "i speak in parable (metaphor)".  anyway, open to any one of his stories and read it.  but dont look at it literally, think about how it directly relates...
@4bidden444 @MrAstrotheology https://t.co/4bcBLeFLr9		but do i believe yehsua existed?  i havent seen anyone thing to prove he did not.  but i also look at the new testament being grossly misinterpreted.  i approach it from a metaphorical standpoint, in terms of the law of analogy/correspondences
@4bidden444 @MrAstrotheology it basically, in a nutshell, explains the story of christ, amongst other savior deities through the cycles of the zodiac.  and i'll assume you may be a reader, but here is a book i have been putting off reading for some time	"the worlds 16 crucified saviors"
@4bidden444 i believe that there was a spiritual teacher that embodied the notion of christ.  but i also believe that the person we perceive as christ is one of many.  have you ever looked into astrotheology?  @MrAstrotheology has some amazing videos on YT on the subject.

@obscuree_ im going to disagree here, to an extent	only for the fact that even after we stop talking to ppl, we still have our own issues that we need to get out of our system. it when we continue to dwell is when it becomes a problem.  but it sounds like you got a dweller
@align_manifest figure out on my own that this thing i am so scared of will only happen if i let it happen.  that ultimately its my choice to let it come or do what i can to create the outcome that i desire.  i hope that makes sense
@align_manifest i have found, again just in my experience, and im really just assuming now that we are talking about the same thing, i have a major revelation afterwards.  what do i mean by that?  that after i experience the fear, for lack of a better term, i rationalize it enough to...
@align_manifest from what ive experienced, its can be debilitating.  cold chills, the shakes, headache.  sometimes the "after shocks" can last a day or so after.  my tactic is to embrace it fully and just go were ever it takes me.  the pain, emotional and physical and really suck, but...
@align_manifest i think i know what your saying.  does it almost feel like a burst of emotion, fear, sadness, anger.  i get those from time to time.  when i due i focus on it and let it show me what it wants.  ive had episodes like that that last a few minutes, a few hours and a few days
@4bidden444 im come from the alchmist/gnostic/kaballistic stance that jesus/yeshua has 0 power at all.  that christ, the essence of it, is in each of us individually and speaks to us all individually

@right558 @EsotericExposal but do you believe that that negative engergy be transformed into something else?  for instance, that it may start in a place of negativity and through acknowledgement be transmuted into something positive?
@4bidden444 reminds me of einsteins definition of insanity
@4bidden444 i agree.  most ppl have a tendency 2 do the same thing everyday expecting different results, almost like their waitting on sum outside force 2 bring them the change that they are looking for, not always thinking that they need to be the catalyst of their own change
@mtnsbymelody weird, i wanted to RT this but i can.  but either way.  Yes.  one of the smartest things ive read today

@right558 @EsotericExposal i absolutley believe that	the science of frequency/vibraintion, in my opinion havent even been fully realized, as far as i can c	i also believe that vibrational influence can b done on the individual level as well	imagine if i didnt agitate u from the get go?	wud we b talking now
@JayLaGrant and thats the beauty of communication.  turns out you and me were talking more of the same language then either of us realized.  thats why i hate text.  leaves to much room for too many assumptions.  but look at it this away, would we have spoken any other way?
@JayLaGrant i didnt get that impression from the post, but thats my interpretation	thats also assuming the child wants to open up to the parents though.  not all do.  some like their space.	but im sure we can agree that its even important to support them if they dont like to talk to us
@_PhillyChimp_ @MikeCoats1965 @EsotericExposal thats why i was asking .  i dont consider being familiar with the bible knowing it cover to cover.
@_PhillyChimp_ @MikeCoats1965 @EsotericExposal go on please, because i dont recall those parts of the bible.  or at least cite them for others	im unfamiliary with the third temple. were is that stated?	wounded how? and healed how?	im not sure what the "etc" meant.  could give passage verses?
@ssryan6466 @EsotericExposal if the AC is real, i would say its someone that most ppl will ever know	well i dont think that they will ever know for certain, at least not until its too late	and by that point it wont matter to anyone not following him, you dig?
@LowTaxChloe it sounds like they think the voters are stupid.  are they wrong though?	should stupid voters be in control?	stupid voters were never in control to begin with.	they are only led to believe they are, because they were stupid.  but that goes for every country with voters
@_PhillyChimp_ @MikeCoats1965 @EsotericExposal i am familiar with the bible, what signs are you talking about?  theres quite a few mentioned in the bible.		  any particular scripture your talking about?  theres quite a few mentioned

@Chillaghan @EsotericExposal look at it like this.  if the AC is real, he would be coming to bring down the churce and its teachings for a reason.  because their shit.  i look at it like this.  one mans christ is another mans anti christ
@MikeCoats1965 @EsotericExposal you never will unless he comes out and says it, which will probably never happen because, as they say, if you gotta say it to get attention, its probably not true
@_PhillyChimp_ @MikeCoats1965 @EsotericExposal or maybe he already knows your waiting for that response and isnt going to do it just because everyone is expecting him too.  and if you claim to know what hes thinking  wouldnt that make you potentially the antichrist?
@VolkersBram @EsotericExposal chances are you wont even notice.  i wouldnt imagine its going to be on every tv screen.  it will more then likely be someone moving behind the scenes that you may or may never even interact with.  or maybe you did already and didnt even know.  that would be weird

@right558 @EsotericExposal you dont think they can wireless control your mind through frequency already? it doesnt take too much effort.  as for the implants and neural lace, do you have any good info on those?  i like to learn.
@right558 @EsotericExposal unless they already got you under their control	but how would you even know?	but i know what your probably thinking, "im too advanced to be under their control just yet"	i used to think that too	i think we both got something to learn
@CiriusPants @cerebralsymphoy is that something i should be familiar with, the supidist movement?	this is a movement?	being stupid?	it seems to confirmed to be be more of a way of life for most ppl	i think the movement ended a long time ago and its getting time to clean up the mess
@right558 @EsotericExposal how can you resist if you dont control your own mind?  simple.  you dont	but i think thats the point	if you were capable of controling your own mind you would and if not, you will get what is coming to you	i dont believe the universe/karma feels bad for lazy ppl
@cerebralsymphoy considering your handle, i would assume you would realize this person is speaking is using a metaphor before calling it "STUPIDIST".  and im not one to call ppl out on their grammer, its far beneath me, but i dont like the way you handled yourself w/ this	its spelt stupidest.
@JayLaGrant but i dont think you can make anyone learn anything, all you can do is guide	there has to be room for the childs own trial and error so they can test their own theories &amp; come up w/ their own conclusions on how to conduct themselves	but i agree in that parental guidance is vital
what about segregating ppl based on their zodiac?  im sure theres a few ppl out there that will agree with that one.  dont ppl hate geminis?  the taurus genocide might be a bit much, but thats my dream, no one elses
what if you wanted to wipe out a group of ppl based on their zodiac sign?  i dont think that would be catagorized under zenophobia.  is there a name for that?  but i was thinking that if i ever gain power that im going to call for the genocide of all Turians
@buzzman888 2nd chance to clean their mess
@buzzman888 no need for a wall	US invade mexico and theres no need for a wall	mexico doesnt seem to be on the verge of fixing itself, so maybe be leave it under US military control unless the old regime wants a 2nd chance to their mess
@align_manifest "Your spot on man..."	3:33a, which is odd because i dont thik its displaying the right time
@align_manifest and vice versa.  but i think its unique to the learner to figure it out.  but thats where i believe the law of analogy/correspondences comes into play heavily.  when looked at like a metaphor its actually pretty easy to see how everything relates to something else
@align_manifest and that is probably why i enjoy sharing thoughts with ppl the most.  i come from the school that everyone has something to teach and/or inspire.  but that goes back to everythign happening for a reason.  i believe that everyone we interact with is there to teach us something...
@align_manifest im big on numberology, im not an expert but i know some stuff.  did you notice the time you posted that reply?  i pay attention to that stuff, i think everything happens for a  reason.  but either way you helped inspire the thought.
@obscuree_ but thats me
@obscuree_ not always	its could also be choosing to take what we learned from the past to make it better then what it was, if we learned everything we were supposed to.  and others its moving on to figure out the lessons we havent learned yet.	i dont look at it in terms of right &amp; wrong
@xirtempest &amp; dont forget all that cool shit i told u about 7 wen we first started talking	777 is the jackpot	21 is black jack	21 = 7 + 7 + 7	i forget if i mentioned that 777 in the esoteric traditions is known as the perfect number, as well as the number of god, i consider god consiousness
@xirtempest from a literal stand point yes.  but i also look at things metaphorically  and relate the things ppl say to, exactly that, my own experiences.  but i again, everythign happens for a reason, if you hadnt tweeted this exact tweet, would i have experienced that same inspiration?
@xirtempest inspired me to realize that i may be right.  i hope everyone else you inspire shows you how.  i feel its the obligation of the person being inspired to at least show some gratitude for the inspiration.  i think this is the 2nd time this week with you.  your killing it
@xirtempest come up with.  but i can only prove so much.  some theories stay as theories, until i can make a better one or someone can come along and inspire me to think other wise.  you just inspired the shit out of me, but not because you made me think other wise, but in a way...cont

@align_manifest writing worked for a time.  but one i got the past out, video seemed better suited for putting what i learned to the test.  i move move around alot when i talk and i like to watch my face and body language.  i like to own my "weird" behavior as much as possible.  it helps
@align_manifest truth	i think though alot of ppl have a hard time being vulnerable because of the past.  i think youd agree with that.  you said something on the podcast that i thought was genius.  record yourself.  anyway you can.  video, words. images.  what ever releases those past blocks
@xirtempest did you know that?
@xirtempest im very curious where you are going with this	what you said brings to my mind the word apocalypse.  its my belief ppl miss define the word as the end of the physical world	it comes from the greek word apokaluptein, which means to uncover or to reveal that which is hidden.

@align_manifest its all i do.  i cant work a regular job because dont want to waste thinking/learning time.  some ppl think its weird, but i think its weird that they arent doing the same thing lol.
RT @obscuree_: are you healed or just distracted?
@align_manifest i forgot, i relate a emotional relationship to creation because i look at it from the stand point of the hermetic axiom, as above so below, aka the law of analogy.  in hermetics, all things are an analogy for somethign else.  i dont think most ppl fully appreciate that concept
@align_manifest what you meant, then i guess, i took the long road to say, i agree lol
@align_manifest of attraction and desire are skewed as well. think of it like their "negative" accentuates our "positive" and vice versa. i dont know if your familiar with astrology and the meaning behind the concept of elements and their effects on the personality.  unless thats exactly...cont

@align_manifest ive wondered this, but i look at it from an esoteric stand point.  in the eso tradtions creation comes from the joining of the maculine forces &amp; Feminine.  perfect opposites.  to the point that while the one attracts, the other retracts away from. which made me wonder...cont

@AlricJess @Saints43_ @EsotericExposal of course, but thats the point. if one person sees so much in it, why doesnt anyone else?  perhaps there is more to it then ppl think.  not saying everything in said book would be 100%, but at least some one thought it was more than the boring symbol a parody society thinks it is
holes.  from the dark and scary recesses of your mind.  let them come.  and when they do shine some your own light on those shadows.  realize your more then who you think you are.  your the one with the power, no one else and never let anyone make you think that.
reconcile the your own past, your going to be doomed to repeat it over and over.  look deep into yourself.  look at the things that still haunt you, but this time dont back down to them.  dont hide or scurry away like usual.  stand up and let them come out of their dark little
to figure the whys and the hows, and maybe even the whos, but does it matter?  does it really matter?  the past is done.  and i can confidently say that as in less then an hour the world of 2018 will be over and just another memory of the past.  look forward.  if you cant
no, but who is?  no one.  	stop blaming others, because you may not realize it, but they dont blame you either, well, not in their head.  your not the only one looking at yourself right now.  i know your probably frustrated and i know your probably pulling some hair out trying
a wise person is going to take a look in the mirror first.  as much as we want to point the finger at them, you need to let it go and look at you first.  put your ego to the side for a minute and long deep look into that the reflection.  is this person guilt free?  sinless?
Just walk away and let yourself be filled with your own love and light.  i know its hard to do.  i know its painful.  but you are the one thats going to have find the courage and strength within you and really look back on this situation.  whos to blame?  whos right?  whos wrong?
they didnt really deserve?  and for that matter, could we say the same about you?  either way there is a lot of negativity here.  something very dark, very grimey.  but you need to let this go.  just WALK AWAY!  its over.  theres nothing to salvage right now, only more misery.
up a lot of space in your mind.  possibly someone you think betrayed you.  but did they really?  or perhaps you did something to them as well?  every story has at least 2 victimes when all is said and done, but are either of you really victims?  did you do anything to them that
holding onto and probably its holding on to you as well.  something your having a hard time letting go of.  better be careful though because this things really has a hold on you and you them.  this doesnt look like something healthy for either of you.  and it definitely is taking

@FatherSciarappa a priest friend of mine once said when talking about the meeting of St. Dominic and St Francis, "the road to sainthood is a team effort".
@Saints43_ @EsotericExposal and i was just doing a little digging.	the GW was based off of the statue of zeus at olympia that was made by the sculptor Phidias
@Saints43_ @EsotericExposal good	&amp; technically, that image of baphomet is a symbolic image 4 expanding human consciousness.  it wasnt intended to represent satan	the upward pentacle reps. spiritual enlightenment	unlike the downward pent. which puts the material existance over the spiritual, ie satanism
Abracadabra - I create as I speak
this statue is older then the drawing of baphomet which was drawn by eliphas levi in or around 1856	the GW statue was commisioned in the late 1700's	fear not https://t.co/QvtzQLAADe
@Saints43_ @EsotericExposal the GW statue is about 30 years older then that depiction of baphomet.
@xirtempest hopefully that makes sense.  i had some wine....
@xirtempest but i believe that you believe it
@xirtempest so to speak.  8 billion ppl with 8 billion perspectives, is 8 billion gods.  but when a majority of individuals believe the same thing, that collective energy is giving power to what it is they believe.  but like a friend said to once.  i may not believe what you believe...
@xirtempest absolutely, if a majority of ppl worship extra sharp chedder as god, extra sharp is god, so i also believe that god is a reflection of the human collective. but i also believe that god is a reflection of the individual as well.  like most things i believe god is a perspective,...

everything i mentioned above. like i said there are multiple meanings to every concept and idea. it gets really fun once you can see how they work together.
existance. but thats a story for another time. theres just as many interpretations of these concepts as there are ppl living in the world.		hope that made some kind of sense. seems silly for me to be studying all this stuff and not share it. and, there is so much more to
others believe that we repeat our own lives over and over again until we get everything right. others still believe that we can also repeat our lives mistakes and triumphs multiple times within this one life, until we gain what we need to transcend into higher planes of
the constance revolution of the 4 concepts of birth, life, death, and rebirth. over and over throughout eternity. because without death there can be no life and no birth without rebirth. some traditions, such as hinduism, classify the idea of rebirth in the form of reincarnation.
rebirth. but heres where it gets really cool. what happens when you spin a square fast enough? it has the appearance of a circle. which brings up to the final aspect of the philosophers stone's symbolism.		the circle represents the unending, cyclical, circle, nature of existance.
formulated over the course of a year from deeply studying a multitude of religions, philosophies and mystic traditions. but i digress, i think my ego needed to pop out for a second lol.	but each point also represents the 4 elements of existance itself, birth; life; death; and
with the square. the points of the square itself represent, again, the 4 letters of the tetragrammaton. i just want to make a quick side note and mention that all of these things have multiple meanings and interpretations, just so happens that mine is my favorite as it was
conjuction with each other. that may sound a little complex but they dont teach this stuff in school anymore so you may need ot use your imagination a little bit.		so thats the triangle. what about the square and the circle. in essence they represent the same thing. ill start
likes to have stuff and be in control of as much as it can. alchemy was used to teach its initiates, students, to overcome their own human nature and allow themselves to relinquish control over to the intuitive, subconscious mind. allowing both the ego and intuition to work in
minds to create what is known in some circles as Unity or Christ consciousness. it represents the highest level of spiritual enlightenment that one can achieve on the physical plane of existance. what that means is that one is no longer controlled by their ego mind, the one that
and circle, which in itself holds more meaning then i really have the time to put down right now. but heres a basic break down.		the 3 points of the triangle represent the "holy trinity", the father, the mother and the son. they represent the union of the egoic and intuitive
that the tetragrammaton is further explained with an understanding of the symbology of the philosophers stone, a mythical artifact said to hold the power to transform pure lead into gold and grant the user eternal life, and happens to be my banner image of the triangle, square
mystical existance of human beings; the spirit; the soul; the astral and the physical, which are represented in the 4 worlds of the Kabalistic tree of life, which is a discussion for another time as it gets way more complex then what i just said.		even more interesting though is
of the zodiac; taurus; leo; scorpio and aquarius, which each in turn represent the 4 elements; fire; water; air and earth, which are represented in the 4 suits of the minor arcana of the tarot; wands; cups; swords and pentacles, which in turn all represent the 4 qualties of the
but, while reading i was reminded of the correlation of the tarot and kabalistic tree of life in conjunction with the tetragrammaton that i always found quite interesting and decided to share.		you see, the 4 letters of the tetragrammaton are also represented by the 4 fixed signs
mind and even others still, its all of those things at the same time. an understanding of the Hermetic principle of correspondences, or law of analogy, "as above so below, as within so without", is rather helpful to fully grasp the immensity of the previously mentioned concepts.
the name of God from the bible. but in the occulted traditions, Jehovah isnt just a being who had a son who died for your sins, no. in some traditions it is a being, in others it is the creative essence from where the entire cosmos was created, in others its the mind behind your
is discussed. for those unfamiliar, the tetragrammaton is the "secret name of god". it is represented in the hebrew alphabet by 4 letters, Yod He Vau He, or the english letters IHVH. in english it translate to Jehovah, which im sure more then one of you may be familiar with as
i was just reading a book, Introduction to the Study of the Tarot, by Paul Foster Case, which reminded me another great book on the tarot that i read earlier this year, Tarot of the Bohemians, by Papus. In both books the term, which i was at a time unfamiliar with, tetragrammaton

summer.  we did alot of cool shit together and i helped them get through some weird shit.  some ppl like to treat me like im a little loopy, but i have seen some shit that would give most ppl nightmares for life.  heres to hoping i get that picking back up again soon.  cuz
blocks.  some of the deeper fear based emotions are harder to get through for some but thats why you take it slow.  like i used to tell my clients, when i had them, its all about the baby steps.	but my first job was working for this family, who i worked with a few times over the
down with some, preferable with a little pot and some spirits (booze) and talking about whats troubling them, and hopefully letting out a couple tears.  this is something i still practice everyday on myself.  in the spirital community, some refer to this as releasing emotional
if your mad, you think of something that pisses you off.  those are demons.  well think of it like this.  demons are what we woudl consider the lower vibrations of thought, while angels are the higher vibrations of thought.  	so exorcizing a demon is nothign more then sitting
we have a general idea of how ppl act when they feel a certain way.  but heres the real mind fuck for you.  those emotions exist whether you feel them at this moment or not.  they live inside of you and they think about you.  thats why when your sad, you think of someting sad or
like this.  every emotion that you and i feel are basically frequencies that our brain taps into, which allow us to feel.  i think this can be easily explained like this.  think of angry ppl.  they typically all act the same, in general.  think of happy ppl.  think of ppl in love
blaire or some other shitty exorcist movie out there.  ive never seen one that dramatic before, but its not that crazy.  Demons possession is actually quite easy to understand if you look at demons from a different perspective then how they are typically portrayed.	think of it
witchcraft, also known as La Vecchia Religione, The Old Religion.  She was a pretty cool chick that specialized in candle magic.  i think she had the hots for me lol, but thats a story for another time.	but, i would presume that when i said exorcist you had visions of linda
some ppl think this is weird, but for a little while over the summer i worked as an exorcist, yup.  pretty cool right?  i even had a partner who was a witch.  not one of those dorky ones that buys the wica books at B&amp;N, but a 5th Stregheria witch.  Stregheria is very old italian

so next time you see baphoment, you can giggle to yourself because of all the "satanists", who have no idea what it even means.	oh and check the arms, notice the words "Solve" and "Coagula".	its a alchemical term, "Solve et Coagula", which roughly means to take apart and ..
the CoS coopted, represents those who follow the materialistic, egoic, path.  one who places the material realm above that of the spiritual realm.  do you want to call that satanic?  go ahead.  its all the same stuff.  we all fight over a million names describing the same thing..

@Tiffany_M_Roa i think it has everything to do with it.  if 100 ppl are all in agreeance that they hate you, you dont consider that group think?	whether you did something to them intentionally or not.	best analogy i can think of for group think is bridge jumping.  feel free to insert your own
@Tiffany_M_Roa yes	"...never tried or could not achieve it on their own"
@Tiffany_M_Roa not necessarily.  why do they hate you and why do you hate them?  it could be a misunderstanding on their part or yours.  chances are its on both sides.  but you never know.  thats alot of different perspectives
@Tiffany_M_Roa im group think is not always good thing.  if everyone was jumping off a bridge, what would you do?  	id probably find out why they were jumping before making a decision
@Tiffany_M_Roa but who gets to decide who is right and who is wrong?	a problem to you could be a solution to me and vice versa if neither of us are willing to accept the flaws in our own logic and learn from what the other has to say.  its all about taking control away from the ego
@TwinFlameGirl @AudreyKitching and i think thats a really important concept that many ppl lose the sight of or completely ignore.  we cant ever grow until we accept that we are not ever victims.  everything happens for a reason, but its up to us to figure out the individual reasons for ourselves

happy medium between work and recreation, but only if you actually enjoyed the work you do but its a slippery slope because at what point do you stop the work to fully embrace the recreation.  because its only a matter of time before your recreational life is able to help support

Happy or Stuff?  but i guess thats not fair, ill break it down a little further and then let you decide.  the less stuff you have, the happier you are. the more stuff you have, the more you have to work.  and i dont believe anyones job makes them happy, well not everyoen, im

wouldnt do it, well not without good reason, but its gotta be a really good reason.  if it was a decision of life and death, it would take me a little bit to think about what i would want to do.  but other then that, life is not meant to be wasted doing shit that you dont like.

not sure if this one makes sense but fuck it		an existance of recreation.  it sounds lovely right?  i think so.  but i think the word recreation has a bad conotation to it to those who work for a living.  i think that living a life of recreation gets mischaracterized as a life

@geet_selfish it is amazing.  and it clears your mind like nothign else
take in what you were told.  but i think im wrapping this up now, im in the middle of another conversation.
shutting the fuck up for once and actually listen to what the other person has to say, you would probably be surprised at the pearls of wisdom that you can get out of the even the, seemingly, most mundane of conversations.  its pretty interesting if you can calm your ego down to
to so many ppl on a daily basis.  alot are useless conversations that i really wish i didnt bother myself with, but even the useless ones leave an imprint and have a lesson to learn, and its not to not listen.  its different for everyone.  next time your talking to someone, try
you?  i have no fucking clue and i dont know if it really matters.  i think i would probably prefer not to at this point.  you see, the problem with knowing too many ppl is that they all live in your head and never shut the fuck up.  but i tink i bring that on myself by talking
way.  at least im not like everyone else posting stupid videos and memes.  at least this is somethign different.  are you even there still?  good for you if you are.  ill see how much longer i can keep this going, i feel like its my duty to write you a short novel.  and who are
though.  im not sure why.  probably because i dont usually get a chance to talk as much as i want and its probably for the best for the ppl i will talk to taht i get all of this crap out of my head while i can because i can talk for hours.  leo, cant help it.  and look at it this
standards its quite possible i may be but thats a really LONG story and is going to take alot more then a silly free writing experiment.   which reminds me of a really cool story.		im not going to tell it though.  i dont think i have feel like it.  im much rather enjoying this
it sounds because i realize that if i wasnt "shitty" then i wouldnt have learned not to be "shitty" or rather, i learned why i dont like being "shitty" and choose not to be "shitty" anymore.  now does that mean im a saint now?  no.  well, not yet, but technically by christian
but encouraging at the same time because once you embrace it as a fact you realize that all teh horrible things taht ppl may do or say to you dont really mean as much as you thought.  i spend most of my days reflecting on how fucked up of a person i was, its not as depressing as
least taht are going to give you a thumbs up and push you.  its a sad fact, but shit happens.  everythign happens for a reason and maybe your really not supposed to be around the ppl that you surroundign yourself with.  but maybe you already knew that too. 	its a shitty feeling
that the point of changing is because we dont want to be shitty ppl anymore and it has nothing to do with them.  but what are you going to do.  at least take solice in the fact that no matter how much those around you call you crazy or look at you funny, its the ppl you know the
down are only doing it because they know that they dont have the strength/courage to do it themselves and ultimately dont want to see you become something more then them because if you do, then you show them just how shitty of a person they are.  but what they fail to realize is
like when you want to better yourself, and the fucked part is that most of the ppl that will try their best to bring you down are the ones that closest to you, but im sure you already realized that.  but whats important to understand is taht those ppl that are trying to bring you
was like the old me that wanted to make a change in their lives but is so fucking afraid of doing it because of what other ppl will think and how they will respect your decisions.  well, i can tell you from first hand experience that when you change, ppl hate you.  ppl do not
anything to anyone this time but that doesnt actually bother me.  or maybe im wrong.  maybe your sitting there reading this wondering where its ultimately going, and i can promise yiou that i dont know if its going anywhere good but maybe theres someone else whos reading this who
the me today could kick the ass out of the me that found that piece back in july.  but tahts neither here nor there.  	so now it looks like i ran out of things to say.  i am curious how long i can keep this train of thought going.  i dont think this is actually going to mean
for the first time in ever i was exactly where i wanted to be.  it was a neat feeling.  	but then i thought about how the me at the time, 9 months after writing that piece, how i could of totally kicked the ass out of the me that originally wrote it.  writing this now i see how
on what i wrote which was basically about wanting to make a change in my life for the betterment of myself and all of my family but you could see the despair that i was in at the time.  when i reread that i laughed because i knew that that person was dead, the old me.  and that
random page and had this weird urge to start reading it.  	im not going to bore you with the details because it wont mean anythign to anyone but me but like i said, i forgot i even wrote the thing.  but i hadnt thought particular time since it had happened so when i looked back
all of my adventures but one night in particular i was doing a tarot reading for someone over the summer and was out of notebooks.  i grabbed a seemingly random one, i dont believe anything is random.  as i was flipping through looking for a clean page i found some this seemingly
particular time in my life as compared to where i was 9 months later it overwhelmed me a bit.  and how i even found it all those months later was even cooler, or so i thought.  i write alot, and have stacks of notebooks that are just filled with random thoughts and details of
forethought put into it, just start writing what ever words come out as they come to your mind.  	the last time i tried this without a purpose i wrote something that 9 months later brought a tear to my eye.  not that it was overly profound, but to see how low i was at that
so lets see where this goes.  i have nothing to write about and im curious what this is going to turn into.  think of it as an experiment i guess.  well technically this is a writing exercise called free writing where you just write what ever comes to your mind.  no editing or
@AudreyKitching ive been here many many times over the last few months.  even wrote a note.  i was saved by a miracle that still boggles my mind.  but i have been feeling this one quite a bit recently.  its a terrible feeling that actually resurfaced last night for a little bit.

@medicus44 @realDonaldTrump but slower isnt what he said and not the reason i commented	he said the only way to stop	i said thats not true
@medicus44 @realDonaldTrump because unless 100% of all "drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements" are coming from one access point that a wall would block then it will still get in	perhaps it will slow it, but that depends on where a majority of these things are getting in
@medicus44 @realDonaldTrump a wall isnt going to stop any of that
@medicus44 @realDonaldTrump human trafficking is just a fancy term for illegal immigration, which is a fancy term for wanting to move to a different country	legalize it and no one is being trafficked anymore no?	mind you i didnt say kidnapping and neither did trump
@medicus44 @realDonaldTrump of course it would	look at the legalization of marijuana	theres little to no black market 4 pot were its not illegal &amp; if there is its so insignificant that no 1 even acknowledges it.	granted there are laws at the federal level, but my idea of ending the gov isnt popular yet
@realDonaldTrump incorrect.  there is another way and way more cost effective and can be fixed in a split second	total decriminalization of all of the above mentioned "crimes".	something that is not illegal cannot be considered a crime.
@ResilientNis how does that make them poor conversationalists?	if everyone is fighting over who gets to talk about what they like, then whats the point?	maybe its not that ppl are poor conversationalists, maybe its that ppl are poor listeners

@fireox9 should they only talk about what you want to talk about?
@tmagasays i come from the school of thought that there needs to be balance.  you cant have freedom without oppression and vice versa	and at what point is the patriot now the oppressor?  or do you think that that cant happen?
@tmagasays just so i understand what you mean, oppression is not ok unless one is oppressing an oppressor?  the needs of the many over the needs of the few?	realisticly you dont know why the tyrant is a tyrant.  have you ever thought maybe theres a reason why they do what they do?
@PyramidRealm i dig that completely	but wut are you gonna do?	most ppl dont like to hear that their prescribed way of thinking may be wrong.	its like the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water	but even still, those who choose not to believe still may have valid pts of their own
@ThelIluminatii great advice	now... https://t.co/cjuQUDuIeU
@tmagasays do you not think that maga 100% truthful?	&amp; wut do you consider tyranny?  do those tyrants not deserve equal rights to practice their beliefs like "patriots"?	or do only patriots get equal rights?  who defines a patriot?  is it possible that the tyrants know something you dont.
@PyramidRealm oh, i read that post completely differently	but yes i agree with you on the origins of the term.  	but then again, evidence is one thing, hard facts is another.  without being there in person to see something happen, no one really knows anything.  but i feel what your saying.

@AudreyKitching i hope so, half of my days are filled with paranoid delusions, well i dont know if their delusions because they actually make sense from both perspectives, but i guess at that point its just a matter of take the best of both and making a third thats more calming...
sometimes i wonder if im as loony as some ppl think or if they are as koo koo as i think.  maybe a mix of the 2.
@LivPsy i come from the other school of thought	let them deal with on their own	that what i did	no medication and no doctors.  you really want help, stop being a baby and face your fears.  no one really feels sorry for you	you are a burden on them because your afraid to stop taking pills
RT @AudreyKitching: Today was the last day of my life on this earth that I will ever allow myself to be emotionally abused.
@AudreyKitching so does that mean the ppl are getting replaced?	for instance if one had a estranged wife and child that avoids them?	im not going to lie though, my life has been much better w/o them these past couple months.  thats not a popular answer but, truth isnt always popular.
@xirtempest sounds like your day went exactly the same way mine did lol	but look at it this way.  theres alwasy something better right around the corner
@End_TheFederalR being locked in a small room for a little bit can make you realize how simple your daily life problems really are.  	i dont think id go that far with it, but different strokes for different folks
@obscuree_ try to look at it from their perspective though	whats good to you could be bad to me and whats good for me could be bad for you	think of it like a thermometer.  theres not real distinction between hot and cold	101 degrees is colder then 102

@mtnsbymelody @themoontarot like you said, so worth the releases	ive had a quite a few bad ones that left me in bed for a few days but the insights that come out of it are so wonderful	its funny how letting yourself really experience the fears in your head can actually do for you

@LivPsy right at this moment as a matter of fact

@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan you could just say that you dont have a good reason for thinking the way you do other then that someone told you to think that way	you still havent actually explained why you think eating little mice is fucked up

@Tiffany_M_Roa gotcha	i think i do recall reading in the book that there was going to be another book
@gothforbid yes and how do you think it should be specifically addressed
@Tiffany_M_Roa is there a signal when someone is in direct contact?	im just trying to understand, hence the 20 questions	for instance, is there a particular spokesperson?
@Tiffany_M_Roa is there a heirarchy?

@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan i didnt insult anyone	i made conclusions based of available facts
@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan 1.what facts were presented for you to make your assumptions?	2.thats good	3.its good, but remember what you think isnt what you know, and ppl dont aleays care what you think	4.why do you think you can judge anyone
@JohnTrumpFanKJV why?	do you not think other ppl are allowed to think differently then you?	maybe they know something you dont
this right here https://t.co/wh8JCS6lyq
@LivPsy but if you wait to long, your decision might make itself	then who do you blame?  cause now your still a pessimist, but now your lonely too.	and thats why you need choices, otherwise that misery is never comign out of your dna
@LivPsy if you do in fact believe in fate that is.  then its just up to you.  bite the bullet and take one for the team or do what everyone else does and wait.  but then you have to think about your approach.  keep it reserved or guns blazing or wait for them.
@LivPsy or you can use your baggage on their baggage as a distraction	hmmm	interesting concept if your following me.	because though yours is lighter, it might be enough to clear you some room to wiggle in and work what ever magic you can.  unless you are ok leaving it to fate
@LivPsy so then your problem turns into, how to get rid of the baggage thats between you.  i supose you decide who has the least and jump ship or clear all your shit out first and when your good, then grab the rest of the crew.	or say fuck it and walk away and start a new cycle
@LivPsy i believe its more like genetic muscle memory	think of it like genetic karma	you just need 2 parents that can figure that out their own shit first then find a way to make it work together for the kids	actually pretty simple	but some ppl got too much baggage in the way
@HarveyStaub1 but how does this effect me or you personally?
@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan or do you do it because you know	something tells me you dont know as much as you may like to tell yourself	but i dont know you, what do i know	keep up with the assuming though.  im going to guess that it fits your personality perfectly	do you get that alot?
@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan do you always make so many assumptions?	i cant imagine what that must be like, to always assume you know what someone thinks.  does that get you far in life?	does it make you feel powerful to tell someone what they think?	do you really believe you can read ppls minds too?

@mtnsbymelody @themoontarot mind sharing your thought?  i like getting other perspectives.  it helps expand on my own
@Party_TypeChic and if their not asking they shoudl be find, but when i loss cant hold on and reach out, it turns out im right.  but taht could also becuz they know im goign to do that and are just waiting to take advantage, which is also possible	so i think i solved my own problem...let go
@Party_TypeChic which makes me wonder why i feel i need to control anyone in the first place.  probably becuz based off of my interactions with them, i dont think they are capable.  maybe im right but if their not, then they should just ask me, not the other way around.
@Party_TypeChic im trying to figure out if theres a bigger lesson that needs to be learned that i keep missing.  probably that alot of what i think they are all thinking is in my head and i need to just let it go cause its probably not as bad as i think it is just becuz im not in control of them
@Party_TypeChic im in the middle of a hot flash of anger lol	coming to grips with letting go	its really annoying and aggrevating	makes me want to fucking yell at alot of ppl and make them cry, but i remind myself that they are just scared and dont know what else to do.	its like a loop in my head
be surprised how forgiving how ppl are even when you think their crazy and irrational
next time you see them and wait for them to make the offer again? 	what if they didnt? not because of any fault of yours but just because they couldnt.	would you feel regret? would you even care? would you have preferred the crank to have never said anything to begin with?	youd
miracle or yourself?	and if it was yourself, would you go back to the someone and apologize for thinking their a crank and ask for another chance? or would you never speak to them again because you thought they would never make the same offer again? or would you wait till the
fit, not what you think they want in return, but how you see fit	would you tell them?	or would you think their a crank and walk away?	how would it make you feel if you walked away and someone else got it instead? would that make you mad?	at who?	the someone who promised the
if someone walked up to you today and said that they could make a xmas miracle happen for you, anything you want. but it was under one condition. you have to tell them exactly what it is, full disclosure.	and in return you have to do a favor to the person in what ever way you see
@AudreyKitching letting go is the really hard part	letting go means you have to admit that you are worthy of it and it will come back 	but it also means acknowledging the 4 magic words, "I COULD BE WRONG"	but on the bright side, if you are wrong, at least you know something better will so up
@len41 do you not understand what im saying?	i can try to reword it so it makes more sense if you dont get my point.	but yes when still alive	and before this turns into something childish, no i dont eat that and wouldnt, but i understand that some ppl do and i dont judge them for it

@lbell424 @EsotericExposal i agree very much on that but we cant force anyone to listen	but your right, we all have something to share that could help someone, it just falls on others to listen if they feel so inclined
@realDonaldTrump just becuz their truth isnt your truth doesnt mean its not truth to someone		sometimes our ego gets the better of us because others dont think the same way that we do,but that doesnt mean we get to put other ppl down because of it
@xirtempest i think thats the point, they cant understand cuz they have their own crazy	look at it like this, perhaps trying to get ppl to understand is the wrong approach, perhaps its about teaching ppl what you learned from your crazy so they dont make the same mistakes
@lbell424 @EsotericExposal the problem starts when you start to tell others to think the same way	but i dont think ou would do that, but i dont know you so i could be wrong
@miss_haribo414 @angie_karan thats a valid opinion but maybe the ppl preparing/eating it know something you dont
@thempiricalkid @5151mpk @angie_karan its fucked up by ur standards, but those are you standards	do you think you should be in control of what other ppl eat?	maybe you dont like live meat but who are you to judge others that do	wut i see is that you dont think other ppl should eat live meat because you had 1 bad exp
@angie_karan well realistically its seen as graphic because we are not used to seeing baby mice as food like that	most ppl arent fully aware of what the rest of the world eats so of course some dishes are going to be seen as graphic

@lIIuminatii everythign happens for a reason, its up to us to figure out why or continue to repeat it until we do
@Timburgh i always have to remind myself, anger and fear are there for a reason.  to teach us to stop being mad and afraid, its just a matter of figuring out why we need to	im getting pretty good at it
@Party_TypeChic i think its the perfect metaphor for the awakening process.  i just finished it for the first time a few weeks back.  i didnt even realize it was collecting dust in my brothers room next to me
@Party_TypeChic have you ever read the alchemist by paulo coelho?	if not, i highly suggest it	i got a feeling your going to relate to the story like i did.	an understanding of alchemy is not necessary lol
@Timburgh also look at it like this.  if everything happens for a reason, why would someone want to trigger you.  well better asked, why would the universe want you to be triggered?	what lesson does it want you to learn, and its not to avoid the situation lol	that takes some digging though
@Party_TypeChic exactly	i look at it like this, everythign happens for a reason.  everything we encounter in life, now and in the past, happens because theres a lesson that we need to learn and in learning those lessons we find who we are individually.  such an amazing time to be alive
@themoontarot theres so much more i want to say about this because it really is my life and i dont think there are enough ppl talking about this as a serious issue taht could help alot of ppl
@themoontarot but i found a direct correlation between the mystatic traditions i studied and mental health	it looks more like the mental issues we are dealing with on a day to day are all part of the awakening process	our higher selves are trying to show us the emotions that we need ot release
@themoontarot excellent topic	ive actually devoted my entire life for the last several months studying just that.  i could write alot about this and maybe ill put a thread together detailing some of what ive been doing but i got started by studying hermeticism, alchemy, kaballah, tarot, etc
@Party_TypeChic i really do feel for those ppl stuck in the system still.  but i think theres going to be alot more ppl follwoing this trend sooner then later
@Party_TypeChic exactly	i felt it in my stomach for a few months before i quit.  its just got stronger and stronger until just the thought of going there was making me angry, coupled with life things that were happening i said fuck it.  i was only planning on taking the summer off lol
@Party_TypeChic i feel you on that	ive been writing/journaling my experience since june.  6 books later, its funny to look back on those old entries and see the progress that ive made.  but taht feeling of being a new person never gets old
@Party_TypeChic the past year for me has been most incredible.  i actually quit my job in july to focus solely on understanding this process.  its been most excellent experience	im feeling that with the numbers and i just posted this a couple minutes ago, but mine are 1138

@Timburgh i think i dbl typed a sentence, but mentally prepare before getting into the situation i meant.	its a little complicated of a concept but think of it like envisioning the future in your head so you know how to not experience it in life	that make more sense?
@Timburgh the real trick, and what i practice as much as possible, to live out those angry &amp; hate filled moments in my head	 let myself get pissed an angry in my head	you can typically tell what someone will try to piss you off with, the key to be prepared and react how they wouldnt expect
@AudreyKitching 1138 &amp; 138 has been hunting me for over 30 years, movies, music, time	i have noticed that i typicall get some of my best downloads with a half hour range of 1138a/p	but a friend pointed out over the summer and im embarrassed i didnt catch it myself but 3+8=11

@DownNOutNow @ThelIluminatii forgetting the past, is a hard one	it involves a few easy steps	u just gotta really admit that you are the cause of all the "bad" things that ever happened in your life	and the other is figuring what the lesson was for you to learn from that experience

@ToriNicksWho but try to remember, everything happens for a reason.  just need to ask your self why ppl would be doing that to you.  maybe they are trying to trigger a negative response	but then you need to ask, why would they want to do that to begin with	but i like to overthink
@MindSovereignty everything happens for a reason and everything has a lesson to be learned
RT @orchidslantern: Doing things you know you'll hate just to be 'out of your comfort zone'. Is that growth or madness?
@orchidslantern everything happens for a reason, usually for growth, but growth can easily be confused with madness.	but once the feeling of madness goes away youll feel like a million bucks.  the key is to not afraid to be afraid.  good luck
@AudreyKitching do anyone else get tremors?	sometimes my whole body, sometimes my head or hands.  its usually accompanied by a very intense flow of energy up and down my limbs, which is cool, but the shakes that come first do not feel good at all.  been stuck in bed since 12/12
i saw cool and smart things sometimes, but i still do love fart jokes
@someonewhoisme2 @xirtempest depends on your definition of reality.	i like to believe that perception is reality to those who are perceiving it.	at the time we're dreaming you could say that the dream is our particular perception of reality for that moment, is that what you mean?
ppl change, not always into what we want, sometimes they turn into something better.  its just a matter of us wanting to accept that or not.  either way, its ok, as there are no wrong choices just lessons to be learned.
would even recognize us as human anymore even if they saw us.  preconceived notions of what we once were and what we know other ppl are capable of holds us back.  we arent as bad as we think, and believe it or not, neither are the other ppl that we have a hard time trusting.
help us.  that someone could actually care enough about us to want to see if we are ok.	but sometimes we also forget that others dont change as drastically as we do sometimes.  sometimes, we become so far above what we once were taht we arent even sure if those from the past
if that questoin gets you angry at yourself or the other person, chances are, that you could be, and thats ok.  because being wrong doesnt mean what most ppl think it means.  its about trust, plain and simple.  its about trusting that another human being could actually want to
important question your really need to ask your self, i feel its teh most important question of all, could i be wrong?  thats a hard thing to admit for most ppl.  not even, "i am wrong", but "could i be".  the concept alone is enough to drive someone insane for a little bit.  but
other then to hurt us.  but are we sure they want to hurt us or are we just trying to make ourselves believe that because we've never not been hurt by this person in the past, so why would they not want to hurt us again?  why would we make that up?  we should know right?  but an
overnight and to the ppl stuck in these cycles of self denial these changes in others can seem impossible.  it puts our brains into over drive trying to figure out if its even possible for someone to be able to change and if it is in fact possible, what do they want from us
are you the same person that you were 7 months ago?  are you the same person you were 4 months ago?  are you the same person that you were last week?  are you the same person you were before your nap?  why are we not trying to improve on ourselves everyday?  change can come
us off guard for a moment, but then we quickly remind ourselves that that person is bad and just wants to hurt us again.  you could be right but you could be wrong.  what woudl make you think that?  i beleive a very simple concept, ppl change.  	look at your self for instance.
could not have anything of benefit for us as the only memories that we have of them are when they were trying to hurt us.  it can be scary and it can be confusing to see behavior coming from someone who we are not used to seeing this particular behavior coming from.  it can throw
patterns we get caught in are nothing more then self limiting beliefs, as i mention earlier, that we are not good enough for the things that we want, or appear to want us, because of what ever reasons we come up with in our head.  or we convince ourself that a certain person
if extreme enough, can be overwhelming to the other person.  keep in mind that the other person is also stuck in the same self imposed cycle of not believing in themselvs, or maybe they are not, and its just mix signals back and forth, a series of simple misunderstandings.  these
didnt think we were good enough and we scared it off through our own self destructive, and sometimes self improving, behavior.  you see, it is not easy for those around us to accept a change in us over night.	it is something that has to be taken in slowly over time as the change,
thinking the same thing about us, all the while neither one realizes that they are both doing the same thing to each other in an attempt to out victimize the other.	but whats even more interesting is typically the response afterwards.  even after we lose what we want because we
given situation.  it may appear to us that the other person or people involved are working against us and doing everything in their power to bring us down to their level.  but what we also fail to realize is that most of the time, if not all the time, the other person is
you be wrong?  are you sure that you arent the one to blame?	again, a common concept arises.  self blame.  we, through out our lives, seem to have this bad habit of thinking that we are not good enough for the things that we want.  we start to question our own self worth in a
conclusions of why things are the way that they are.  you can play this exercise with almost any aspect of your life.  close your eyes and think about something that you think is holding you back.  why do you think that?  what evidence do you have to support that claim?  could
us too?  what would be the benefit?  is it worth it?  is it worth it to the other person?  should we, ourself, just leave the other person alone?  is the other person worth it?  am i worth it to them?	these are just a few of the questions that arise when coming to these
that they are ignoring us, but why is it that they would be ignoring us in the first place?  perhaps we, ourself, did something to cause that person to be reluctant in wanting to talk to us.  why could that be?  how can we, ourself, fix this?  can we?  does the other person want
emotional triggers that hold us back every day.  you see, finding the root of the cause is just the first step	next it is required to figure out why we, ourselves, are wrong about that belief.	for example, yes it may appear that every time we try to talk to the person we want to,
i try to understand exactly what that means in every event and thought and obstacle in my life.  why did this happen this way, why didnt it, etc.  for the most part, with a little bit of digging in to the subconscious, it is quite a simple task to dig up the root causes of the

@sarahkorpan @jordanbpeterson i dont disagree w u either	but i dont believe anyone is happy, everyones either in the system or acting like their fighting the system, its like this with everything	ppl just need 2 really start prioritizing what they want more.  happy or money or struggle for both
@tamexis @EsotericExposal but, everythign happens for a reason as they say.  so i cant hold it against them
@tamexis @EsotericExposal unfortunately fear has a huge grib on most ppl	they are all afraid that their wrong about what their afraid of, because then theyll have to realize that they were equally the problem	but thats social, personal, governmental	ppl have no idea how really fucked they all are lol
@Timburgh the whole process of figuring it out is about beating it	very slowly, and most of the time you dont even realize that yoiur doing it.  its pretty fucking crazy when you break down all the whys and why nots of things.  theres a measurable science to it as well.  its to prove tho
@tamexis @EsotericExposal i dont theres many ppl that could mentally handle how deep and far back this actually goes.  but you cant say they werent warned.  theyve been throwing it in everyones face since the dawn of time lolol	its actually quite fascinating to see how utterly blind ppl are to everything

@wallibear56 @jordanbpeterson @allahpundit i believe the point is so that others can learn from her mistakes.  not everyone is going to do the same thing so there might be a pearl of wisdom in what she did wrong to further ones own convictions and beliefs, but that depends how much one want to read into it
@IronLion04 @jordanbpeterson it depends on the extent to which you are pursuing money.  and how much you value money over happiness and what your willing to compromise in either direction.  but what is too much happy and whats not enough stuff
@austinruse @jordanbpeterson or, focus on being happy before you have kids so that you can meet someone else thats happy then have happy kids, if thats what one desires.
@sarahkorpan @jordanbpeterson you dont have to shape your life after it, but you can learn from her mistakes.  life is all about learning, even if its just learning a different way of avoiding something we already plan on avoiding	different perspectives can hold grains of wisdom if we take the time to look
@mgpaul44 @vaibhavwadhvani @jordanbpeterson why hope for a better tomorrow?	why not make a better tomorrow.  its not easy for some ppl to grasp because tomorrow isnt a literal tomorrow.  your going to have to have a bunch of shitty tomorrows to get to the one you want, thats the really the only thing one has to accept
@xirtempest 	i just saw this pop up in my feed	thought i RT just in case you were intrigued by what i said about him https://t.co/Q3TAXLjXuS
no borders no boundries.  but taht depends on how big you want to dream	if you ever want to discuss the book further, i would love to.  its my lifes passion to understand it fully
ends, it only changes form, the alchemist discovers the elixer of eturnal life and that symbol takes on a whole new meaning.  because, like morpheus said.  no one can show you the matrix, you ahve to see it for yourself.  and if you can handle what you see, theres no limits,
something, but fret not, because without death there can be no life and so we return back to 1.	so we have a square.  how do you turn a square into a circle?  you spin it	what do you ahve now?  an endless cycle of creation, for ever and ever.  	and when we realize that life never
1 duplicates itself and creates a mirror/negative making the concept of duality, or 2.  the union of the 2 creates.  creation or life is represented by 3.  but without life there can be no death.  and without life there can be no creation.  4 is completion.  it represents then of
in turn represent the tetragramaton, the 4 lettered holy name of god in hebrew, yod he va he.  those 4 letters also represent teh 4 phases of existance, birth, life, death, rebirth.  the father, the mother, the son and the daughter	a little numerology helps too, 1=unity.
triangle is the union of the masculine and feminine consciousness to create the unity/christ consciousness.  but in order to achieve that union one must learn the art of squaring the circle.  the 4 points of the square represent the 4 elements, fire, water, air, and earth, which
it didnt.  and if you can understand vibration, polarity and rythyme and gender to a degree.  those 4 work in unison, well they all do, but gender, polarity and rhythme need to be understood together.  	and again i went off on a tangent	teh symbol and its meaning to me	the
said everythign happens for a reason, even the thigns we say.  i dont like to edit myself because you never know whats going to mean something to someone if you dont know what vibration frequency they are on, understanding the principle of vibration will help that make sense if
theres alot more i have to learn and prove.  but if you every have any help understanding a complex concept i might be able to reword it in a more recognizable way thats easier to understand.  and if anyting i said up there is overly complex i can try to reword it, but like i
anologies and metaphors for something else going on in your life.  get used to seeing with the creative side of your mind.  the book will help with that.  so can i.  i spent the last year of my life devoted to fully understanding what that book has to say.  i dont know everything
lesson of the philosphers stone is that sometimes you can only save yourself, thats not to be taken literally, well it can depending on the situation but more importantly it should be taken figuratively.  	start looking at things in that way, not literal, look at things as
functioning in the world around you and life takes on a new twist after that, but its not something you can tell ppl at first, they wont understand.  they think youve gone nuts.  they will attack and blame you.  but always remember, they dont know what you know.  besides the main
theres more to it as i think i only covered 3 or 4 of the principles, but when you can not even understand them, but just know them, which takes time and actual experience.  when i say experience what i mean is, the more you understand them, the more you start to see them
consciousness is also yours and mine.  so its quite probable to say, if all of that made sense, that when i said to you the book finds you for a reason, i guess i found you for a reason.  neat how that works right?  thats the philosophers stone.  well thats a fragment of it.
consciousness, which is in all of us, had some type of hand into what is transpiring in the world.  but as the principle of correspondance states, as above so below, which is tied into the law of analogy, which might actaully make as above so below make more sense, that ALL
this question seems to be perfectly timed.  like the principle of causality states, every cause has an effect and every effect has a cause, basically, everythign happens for a reason.  and if everything is consciousness as the principle of mentalism states, then that all
little technical, so if something doesnt make sense let me know and will try to reword it.  but there is alot of things going on in those 3 shapes, and again, this is my interpretatin based off of my studies and research.  i gave up my life to fully understand taht symbol.  so
little basic understanding of the hebrew alphabet, not actually knowing to speak and write it, but the concept behind it really helps.  knowing some of the letters can help too, im no expert i know about 10 letters.	but i drift off sometimes.  back to the symbol.  i may get a
from my interpretation of it, to fully undestrand it, a knowledge of the hermetic principles and the esoteric traditions, alchemy, magic, kabalah, tarot (not the fortune telling kind.  theres some really good books on the esoteric nature of the cards i can recommend) even a
yes im very familiar withi the symbol.  it is the philosophers stone.  im not sure your familiarity with it, i would presume that if your reading the kyballion then you have at least heard of it.  its a symbol of the alchemical process of transmuting lead to gold, if you arent.

@telliproclaims @Musing_Stranger @jordanbpeterson if u ever unblock me	i didnt say there werent bills either.  but again, perception is reality.  every1 lives in an alternate reality from every1 else	8 bill ppl with 8 bill perspectives making roughly 8 bill alternate realities.  i will enjoy mind just as much as you enjoy yours
@telliproclaims @Musing_Stranger @jordanbpeterson "...if paying bills makes you happy thats your perspective"
@telliproclaims @Musing_Stranger @jordanbpeterson Absolutely u can do that or a million billion other things.	But, like I said, it all depends on your own personal concept of what it means 2 be happy.	My happy isn't yours &amp; vice versa	Perception is reality to those who are perceiving it, if paying bills makes your perspective
@telliproclaims @Musing_Stranger @jordanbpeterson I wasn't talking about bills	What's more important to you	Happiness or money	Would you rather be unhappy or have stuff?	Would you rather be unhappy and have more stuff or would you rather be happy with nothing 	Just depends on your own concept of what happiness is
@HelpingToMAGA @Musing_Stranger @jordanbpeterson Then the gay perspective should be similar to mine.  Too much emphasis on trying to prove yourself to others rather then proving something to yourself	That goes for boys and girls
@Musing_Stranger @HelpingToMAGA @jordanbpeterson Your 100% correct	Now we should be asking why we're not	And when we figure that out, we need to figure out to fix it	Too bad there's not more ppl who think this way.	Your an incredibly intelligent person because more ppl should be able to admit that

you are allowed to have your cake and eat it to.  it just requires a little patience.  keep cool.  you can make it just a little bit longer because theres alot riding on you.  alot more then you know it.	dont be like orpheus.  he failed to learn a very valuable lesson...
unfortunately orpheus didnt see it that way.  he threw away his life to weep in the woods until he was murdered and dissected by a pack of angry water nymphs.  silly man.	he was such a coward to accept that he made the best choice of his life, but he failed to realize one thing..
dragged away lost forever.  his one chance stolen away, not by anyone elses fault but his own.  but was it.  perhaps orpheus's intuition knew that this girl was no good.  perhaps that urge to turn was the gods doing him a favor because she would of made him give up his talent...
it wasnt a short trip and orpheus was growing restless and the further along they went, the further away her footsteps sounded.  	as he came to the mouth of the cave he lost control of himself and he turned around.  all he saw when he was finished was his wife being...
that he gave Orpheus one chance to bring her back.  He told Orpheus that he had to walk all the way back to the upper realm on foot with his wife behind him.  But, if he turned our to check on her, even once, she would be taken away from him for ever.  	he agreed
he desperately pleads with the lord of the underworld, hades, to give him back his love.  Hades asked what Orpheus had to give in return.  Orpheus had nothing but his lyre, so he play for Hades, and his wife Persphone, his most beautiful tune.  Hade was so moved by this song...
are you familiar with the story of orpheus?	at a time, he was the greatest musician of all.  his music was legendary through out the land.	one day, because he was a coward, he missed his wedding.  consumed by fear.  his fear cost his wife her life.	broken by his weakness...

@LuminousFlux12 What do you know about them?	And do you know or do you just think you know because someone said it and in reality you only believe 2nd hand info
@EsotericExposal Not necessarily evil
Can you feel them in your head?	Clawing at your mind, waiting for your will to crack just a little bit.  Just enough to sink their claws deeper and drag you back to the hell that you just escaped		maybe it's all in your head, maybe those demons are actually angels, but maybe not

@th31nitiate there is no wrong way to apply it. remember, the principle of causation.  everything happens 4 a reason, even the book finding you	if you werent ready, you wouldnt have it	and heres how i applied it	look @ the world around u, and look at how all 7 are working together everywhere
@th31nitiate if you have any issues with the content, i may be able to help explain.  	do you know what that symbol is in the center?
you didnt kill any of my friends in the process of being mad at me.  and forgiveness is the hardest lesson to learn.	so what do you want?  you want to live or you want to exist?  makes no difference to me. because, you see, your just 1 in 8 billion, just like me.
sometimes we dont see what we did until its too late, but is it ever too late?  really?  i suppose death would make it too late, but even then, is it?  theres always other ppl.  same soul different face, i say.  but i could be wrong.  that happens from time to time.  i just hope
hold grudges.  you do and say things that make ppl mad so that you can get a reaction.  you may not realize it but we all do.  because youre afraid.  afraid that someone might not be as bad as you think so you do things that you later regret because it turns out, you were wrong.
really did learn anything on my quest which was just one big test.  a search to find a thing that i can do that would make me happy so i didnt have to rely on others.  a thing that i can take it back to my friends and family and say, "hey, wanna be happy with me or no"?  but you
like money and ppl like girlfriends and wives and children and friends, but them, like you, like me, were doing the exact same thing i was, being bored.  so i stopped relying on otheres to make me happy.  i went on a quest.  a quest that was ultimately a test, a test to see if i
if its sitting in a little gray room with one but your own thoughts and word processor.  that you can be happy, because your not and your just too afraid to admit it too yourself.	there was a time i wasnt happy either.  i relied on others and things to make me happy.  things
the boredom that you cant even imagine that life could be any other way and your too afraid to say that you could be wrong, but thats how things go.	so no im not bored. im doing exactly what i need to do to show you that life doesnt have to be boring.  that you can enjoy it, even
the same, i know because i was just like them.  Bored.  your bored with your lives because your not doing what you want to be doing, so you feel, bored, or you think you do.  are you really bored?  and what do you want to be doing?  you dont even know because your so focused on
barely keep up with what it tells me and i dont even have a job other then doing what im doing.  figuring out who i am so that i can help you stop being such a tight ass about your life.  but thats how ppl are.  ive met many ppl over the past half year and every person has been
that the universe fucks with us with.  a middle finger of sorts, just to say "sorry, but your not ready yet.  but keep up the good work, cause it might work at some point, maybe, if your a good boy or girl".	but who am i to say what the universe is trying to tell you.  i can
someone is willing to read my words and want to talk to me but as i said before, the universe does not give you what you want when you want it.  no, it never does.  maybe a tease.  perhaps a taste, but thats its.  makes me wonder if wants are anything more then littel fantasies
you would rather be doing instead of being bored.  because as we can see, im not bored at all.  i was just not doing the thing that was giving me satisfaction, and what is that?  this.   talking.  but i cant talk because i have no one to talk to so i have to write and hope that
dont get what we want when we want it.  sorry but the universe is a bit of a jerk like that sometimes.  so rather then rush myself out into the cold, i sit in my little tomb and write, because maybe, thats what i was supposed to be doing the whole time.  	now, i am curious what
about being bored.  and what things going on inside my mind when im bored, but am i really bored, or am i just not doing the thing that i want to be doing?  quite the question there right?  or no?  	so what do i want to be doing.  walking around in the lovely sunshine, but we
i feel bored by. why?  im bored because im tired of sitting in this room.  what would you rather be doing?  walking around out side in the sun and beautiful weather.  but it is cold and inspiring me to stay inside and write this instead.  and what am i writing about?  im writing

@itsholybible i believe christ saves	same but different	same ideas but different philosophies
@AwareFrequency @SwampysGhost what does it sound like to you?	because i see an alchemical philosophy	those are coded too, a combonation of literal and subliminal.  it takes some practice to use both at the same time	it should be different everyone
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex theres a reason for sure. i have a few theories that arent exactly ready for public consumption, if they ever are.	but its for a reason, if even a little bit is right, as very important reason that is goign to be very hard for some ppl to understand	but thats just me
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex you may not have understood it because i cant word it right	but you answered it perfectly
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex well that depends too, my outlook on society woudl probably differ from yours	but yes, puitting full faith in one philosophy or theology isnt cutting it anymore
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex very true	perception is reality to those percieving it and every truth is a half lie and every lie is a half truth
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex of course, but a issue i came across many times is that there are quite a few ppl that will refuse to even hear another perspective	i try to preface that my thoughts are my own, but like i said earlier, dropping the ego &amp; being able to listen to wht others have to say can be hard
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex i think i worded that wrong	i think its better to ask if you actively try to pay attention to the effects of the 7 principles in action in the world around you?	another book if you have not read, the kyballion.	its a fantastic break down of the philosophy behind hermeticism
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex if i can find it, as its buried, i put together a big thread back around march that has a ton of books and videos.  if i can find it ill tag you in a RT
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex will do	thanks	i enjoyed the chat, feel free to hit me up anytime again
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex exactly	nothing is more enticing to keep learning then finding a new piece of information that replaces or enhances an old belief/paradigm	the trick though is being able to calm the ego enough to accept what i call the 4 magic words...I COULD BE WRONG
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex then your much more well versed then many of the ppl i worked with during my q research	to you put much stock into it?
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex im not too familiar with it as, like i said, i cut myself off to most of the political circus, but ive always been highly suspect to most protests and gathers	i look at them as nothing more then distractions
@redtexsin @BrianMonzon everythign happens for a reason.  we never get what we want when we want it, its always right when we need it.	im sure that insight was for something very important
@laurabusse it feels lik it a beating sometimes lol
@RenovaAlejandro @mindmixradio @c0achrex the masons are an interesting group once you get into their deeper teachings, the rosicrucians and golden dawn(not the new dawn) also have alot of interesting research to look into	i also highly suggest the works of eliphas levi
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex ive never heard of them, ill check them out	hall was a mason and expert in the esoteric sciences	if you find the time, secret teachings of all ages is a fantastic read that will keep you busy for a while
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex your absolutley right	i got mixed up with the anons last october/nov and spent about 10-15 every day digging and digging until around may when i broke off on my own.  the deeper you dig the weirder things get, but there is a bottom to the rabbit hole
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex i believe that there is also a 3rd player that most ppl overlook	are you familiar with hermes tresmegistus and the hermetic principles?
@johnnypeeps it could quite possibly be	i had a dream last night of a scenario that could be leading to somewhere specific that i may be heading	dreams are interesting like that.	they say alot with out saying too much
@wild_stallion_3 i think at the very least, it will be interesting to watch
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex well i can tell yoiu from my research that the ancient traditions play a much bigger role in the happening of the world then ppl could imagine.	have you ever read anything from manly p hall?	in my opinion, ppl need ot become much better acquainted with esoterism
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex i think something like that is going to take a very long time before the general public find out	i actually believe the they will probably will know little of anythign that happens.  but thats just my own thought.  i dont think their minds could handle the shock
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex youd probably be really insteresting in the things ive done.  i was a q digging with the anons since the beginning, but i was coming up with different conclusions and i had to take a step back, ppl didnt like my ideas of the occult and esoteric aspects of what q was talking about
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex exactly. i live by a strict code, i never force any1 to try what i do	whats good for me isnt good for you and vice versa.	i take my work to the extreme, but i do it for a reason.  i ahvent heard of anyone else doing what im do with exploring my issues.  im a special case lol
@RenovaAlejandro @mindmixradio @c0achrex are you familiar with edward bernays, nephew of sigmund frued and father of public relations.  i think you would find him interesting	also if you havent check out the book mass control by jim keith
@wild_stallion_3 that actually makes sense as there will need ot be some semblance of order and the secrets they are holding are more then the average person can comprehend without breaking their minds	theres alot more going on then anyone nows, but i got a hunch you know htat too
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex most ppl have no idea how subliminal.  and thats not just television, but books and music	ever watch/read/listen to something and it evokes a specific memory or feeling?	i study the subliminal effects of as many aspects of life.  symbolism, color, language, its all part of it
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex well, thats part of some of the work i do	the effects of letting go	i dont want to get to mystical as it doesnt make much sense to ppl but its been my experience that we dont exactly need everything that we are told that we do, as long as one learns to not be afraid to lack
@wild_stallion_3 but that will be a tricky task, unless someone who didnt prescribe to the churches doctrine were able to find themselves in a position of power	and im sure it would be easier for 1 covert person then an army of guns and bombs	something tells me they wont be too willing otherwise
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex its hypnotic.  i still catch myself getting drawn into the allure of the moving pictures.  i try 2 keep myself closed off	i spend most of my days just digging into my head trying to rewire my old programming, its a lonely life but emotional control is a skill that highly lacking
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex dead on.  but everyday life thats perpetuated by the system is keeping everyone bogged down with meaningless stuff, bills, work, xmas, but at the same it all comes down to one thing..MONEY	money not being used as a tool but as a way of life	$ is a hell of a drug
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex i know its not easy to just cut out of the world and work on yourself.  it took me 7 months of seclusion.  not many ppl can do that or have the courage to just walk away from everything to heal up their minds.  and that i feel is the big thing
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex i think the problem with that is that until ppl fully embrace themselves as individuals the corruption will never end	everyone is too busy right now on being right that they are missing the imortant part	you cant heal the world until you clean your own house, that goes for every1
@redtexsin @BrianMonzon considering we are our own worst enemie, how better to fight it then alone	no one else can tell you why you do the things you do that made your life the way it is	and placing blame on an entity or outside source for our woes is just a way to keep the attention off of ourselves
@mindmixradio @RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex from my experience most ppl have becum too reliant on someone else telling them what to do, in all aspects of their lives.  they gotten lazy &amp; complacent waiting for someone to fix their problems	ive had alot of ppl tell me their goals and dreams, but even more so i hear excuses
the message of the stars by max heindel	a deeper look at the esoteric nature of astrology as taught by the rosicrucian order.  i started reading it last night, great read especially for those familiar with astrotheology and esoterism in general		https://t.co/DbOJ6pVqv6
@RenovaAlejandro @c0achrex @mindmixradio i think its more of an issue when ppl accept they have leaders instead of public servents	perhaps the leaders arent the problem
@EsotericExposal but it should be noted that the ancients didnt relate information in literal terms like we do.  their works spoke to the deeper core of those observing using symbolism and allegory.	is there credence to this?  maybe	but this is comparing apples to hamburgers
@AnOpenSecret why continually call her out?	does it make you feel better?	you dont know her perspective, asides from a few posts.	sometimes from the higher ground its best to not bring focus on that which bothers us	unless of course your just looking for attention
take time for yourself, any that you can.  look inside yourself and see what it is that bothers you.  dont be afraid to examine it.  dont be afraid to ask yourself the question, why.  be your own explorer, becuz once you can master that, no one can ever hold you down again
in my experience, the best way to beat a negative emotion out of you is the write it out.	due to the amount of time ive been at this, my emotional blocks are quite intense and can be debilitating most of the time as i devoted my life to learning how to conquer fear
@johnnypeeps dreams try to tell how us things from our lives.	not always literally, sometimes we have to look a little deeper at what it means in relation to the physical world around us	does this relate to something going on in your life right now in someway?
@sanitycafe does it though?	how much time have you spent with them to make that determination?	we are always quick to judge others we really know nothing about.	mob mentality and group think based off of assumptions and hearsay are a dangerous precedent to set
@SwampysGhost sounds pretty literal to me.  this is a tactic that i practice on my own.  fighting the urge to shift yourself to make an uncomfortable situation a little more bearable and make it easier to handle the next time your in a similar situation	what do you think it means?
is someone fighting to hold their place in your mind?	dont suppress it, let your mind show you what its trying to, no matter how scary it seems.  cry, get mad, get sad, get nuts.  it isnt easy and will make you feel things u dont want to feel	but you have to or youll never let go
@AudreyKitching this is a tough one, i feel like im missing a lesson i need to learn, either that or im not allowing myself to recognize it for fear of losing this thing		but its consuming my days and my dreams.  what ever it is its putting up a good fight to keep me attached		i got this though
@wild_stallion_3 I no what your saying but I also get the impression that you also know you live in a world of deceit, probably also knowing the church lies to its flock.	Maybe that fear of the anti christ is becuz they are afraid that he is going to topple their system of control down
@wild_stallion_3 One mans anti christ is and other mans Christ 	Don't be so quick to judge and call ppl names, especially when you don't even know them.	Could turn out to b a really nice person who doesnt consider themselves bad at all &amp; is just misunderstood because ppl keep call them antichrist

@Lucy_Ritardo I think your on to something	Everything happens for a reason
@Lucy_Ritardo I like talking to ppl, but ppl don't like talking to "weird" ppl too much in the real world
@Lucy_Ritardo I agree completely	Most of my days are spent musing over my personal existence	Then I write, what I believe are interesting things for ppl to contemplate during their seemingly mundane day	When I'm bored I look for tweets to provoke a conversation	Sum times it works	Sum times no
@Lucy_Ritardo well not right now.  i was bored.  but now i found someone to talk to so it worked lol
@Lucy_Ritardo like what?
@Lucy_Ritardo why?
@Lucy_Ritardo where just not expecting anyone to respond?	im just trying to understand the motive.  i like to understand why ppl think the way they do sometimes.  your post caught my eye
@Lucy_Ritardo just bored	then why post it?
@Lucy_Ritardo &amp; for that matter, if u didnt want anyone to reply the way that i did, why not explain the story better and if you werent looking for replies then why post it for ppl to potentially reply?  unless you were just looking for someone to agree with you arbitrarily	that would be weird
@Lucy_Ritardo i dont understand how you mean contradictory.	i dont recall judging you, i did though, say maybe.  if you wish to percieve that as a judgment i cant stop you	why was it unflattering?  maybe you just misjudged it and it wasnt supposed to be flattering in the first place
@Lucy_Ritardo weird for you could be flattering for someone else	dont be so quick to judge someones behavior if you dont actually know why they are that way to begin with	maybe your the one thats weird
@SwampysGhost why not focus on fixing interpersonal relationships this holiday season instead of gov't corruption.  and ppl really dont know anything about freedom, even the ones that think they do.	do you use money?  do you pay taxes?  do you go to work?  do you pay bills?	your not free

@stefanofait @Jordan_Sather_ Because he retweeted an unsubstantial story?	Is there an actual record of him saying those things or is it hearsay?	And why is it that hearsay is such a popular for of communication anyway?	As a former anon researcher, I could never reconcile the power of hearsay

@orchidslantern i would imagine its essential	theres always going to be bad reviews no matter what, just there will be good	itheres something to learn from all, even the trolls lol	ppl have a bad connotation for what they think is bad, cuz even trolls are trolls cuz you got something they dont
@AudreyKitching im glad you just said that.  because this new visions. its almost as if, the dark side of it is inconsequential because of all the work that was done over the past few months.  that even if this particular path crumbles there are so many others with limitless potential	very cool
RT @AudreyKitching: Endings and new beginnings are both intertwined. Embrace them both, for one can not exist without the other.
@AudreyKitching I have a few paths it's showing me but that's just more clearing.	I've been having great inspirations for the bast 16-17 hours which is usually a sign That i am about to have a potentially very releasy type of night.	Wish me luck, I feel something big brewing
@EllaIsYourQueen Me too	The challenges seem more positively charged.  Almost like the challenge is to find the most creative way of solving it	The fear of failure is gone, I mean cuz even the failure is just as welcome	Does that make sense?
I hope last nights new moon is inspiring you like it is me
@AudreyKitching As a matter of fact I think I was just inspired to make a miracle happen
@pneawf @ArshiMisha @cherryaddison Well that's part of it but i also think that your afraid I'm right	Afraid that your not smart enough to comprehend	Maybe your right, maybe your not	But by your ignorant response, I'd say you got some real scary shit ur hiding from in your head	Who hurt you more, mommy or daddy?
@cherryaddison @ArshiMisha Reread the questions	Then explain wut u dont understand about the question.	A full explanation would take a long time.  And I dont think you have the patience or stamina for the story, but I could be wrong.		do you believe everything happens for a reason?
@pneawf @ArshiMisha @cherryaddison I take it you don't believe in karma or that everything happens for a reason, or only when it's convenient?

@mcmamas6 @EsotericExposal Exactly	Can't appreciate the sweet without the sour
@mcmamas6 @EsotericExposal Different strokes for different folks üòÇ
@KhonshuMaatHeru @EsotericExposal fully embrace it, what did you feel once you got past the fear?	Next, imagine the complete opposite thing happening.  Imagine...it working out in your favor for once	Something this is the scarier then seeing the dark 4 ppl	Fear is the beat teacher	It teaches not 2 b afraid
@KhonshuMaatHeru @EsotericExposal Here's something to practice	Think of sumthing u fear, nothing major, always start small at first.	Close your eyes and really dig into that fear.  Figure out why your afraid &amp; what's the worse thing to happen.	Then allow yourself to experience the worst in your mind	2b continued
@mcmamas6 @EsotericExposal Those capable of traversing the dark r capable of having better control then those who fear embracing it.		We have less stress in our lives because we are aware that though capable of "evil", which is subjective, we choose the light becuz it's more satisfying
@KhonshuMaatHeru @EsotericExposal You are absolutely correct	But you also gain control of it so that it never manifests, well, I take that back.  It will only manifest if you want it too	When you stop fearing the dark, it becomes a powerful tool

@laurabusse that sounds fun cause i can talk about it this shit for hours upon hours. hopefully one day our paths cross.	because if there is one thing i love more then anything else, its to hear myself talk lol	well that and learning from other insights
@laurabusse not familiar with her, just pulled up some vids, ill check them out
@laurabusse now i should also note that patience is a key here.  i have gotten myself into very cool situations thats ive had to walk away from because i tried to rush things.  thats where the universe gives me a kick in teh nuts to being hasty
@laurabusse know that im not afraid of teh worst.  that i can handle it	usually it throws me a bone :)	i dont always get exactly what i want, but i usually get the opportunity to get what i want, as long as i put the work into it of course, but thats where conquering the fear helps
@laurabusse i have a diff view on the law of attraction.  i find that i dont get what i want, i typically get what i dont want, or at the very least what i need.  avg folk who have no belief get what they fear because they are afraid to face that fear.  	i face teh fear and let the universe
@laurabusse but it can get extremely scary, becuase...once you over think it, the universe throws some shit in your face to see if you can really handle it.  and if it not, at least learn the lesson thats keeps being missed which is causing u to think the way u are
@laurabusse tahts why i write alot	get all the bad shit out of my head on paper or on screen	once its out, its out	sometimes big stuff lingers, but it gets easier every time until its all out	and there tears, LOTS of tears	think i dehydrated my self a few times this past week lol
@laurabusse basically	overthinking, at least 4 me, allows me 2 literally experiens the negative emotion that i want to avoid, b it dropping a bowling ball on my foot or losing someone	my experience, feel the bad in your head so you dont in life and if you do, your prepared for the worst
let ppl tell you the worst about yourself	embrace it	you might actually learn something, cuz dayum...you got problems
@laurabusse it can be rough some days.  but on the bright side of it, ive been doing it for so long that my brain automatically assesses ever situation a hundred million ways from sunday before i even get myself into said situation lol	over thinking is a gift when you can control it
@laurabusse funny you say "someone you love dying".  thats what i was just facing.  not in reality but in my head.  not anything serious.  but a paranoid delusion.  	i hate those, but i have gotten in teh habit of letting them pass naturally.  the emotion, not the person lol
@obscuree_ but if you know their going to drain you, can you beat them at their own game by not feeding it	once you let ppl drain themselves, its much easier to fill them back up at your own volition.  show them your light when they are down.  probably be surprised by what they give back
@laurabusse that sounds scary AF	but i was talking more emotionally scary lol	i knew i shoudl of been more specific lol
@EllaIsYourQueen i also find writing helps.  i write everything, probably too much.  enough that i would probably get put in jail or the loony bin.	but i find that if i dont get every ounce of the nasty stuff out, it lingers.  and the longer it lingers the harder it is to get out
@EllaIsYourQueen oh boy me too	ive been stuck on this one things for over a week.  good thing i found a comfy seat to sit in.	but, heres how i roll.  i always get stuck on the bad, but usually always after facing the worst in my head, its a sign that im going to see the opposite in the real world

@DeAndresCalm we never get what we want when we want it.  we get what we need in order to teach us just how valuable what want really is

@johnnypeeps @xirtempest thanks for sharing	ive been there before many times for most of my life.	ppl always trying to bring me down 2 their level, they still do.  but now i dont fall for their games and they fall flat on their faces.	best defense when some1 tells u how bad you are..."your right i am"
@johnnypeeps @xirtempest ppl try to bring us down by projecting their own faults onto us as a way to make themselves feel better	look at it this way, there is a reason they are trying to put u down	u got something they wish they had, figure out wut	think about that next time someone tries fucking with u
@johnnypeeps @xirtempest i have the same problem some times.  	wanna try?
@NamXSV @EsotericExposal i believe the physical body experiences emotions that originate from the neural peptides that are produced in the brain, but i also believe that the energetic body does not require what we consider a brain to experience the same effect	meat suits are temporary

@EsotericExposal interesting	but, crowley wasnt a satanist.	i feel like satanist is a term the uninitiated called anything that isnt christian	well i suppose from that logic, anything to a christian would be satanic if it does not support the teachings of the bible.  	if only they knew....
@xirtempest üòÄ	you really make my day sometimes.	i think it also has alot to do with one holding on to too much past baggage to be able to open their minds enough to be able to accept that another persons version of reality isnt always the same as what one has been told to believe
@johnnypeeps @xirtempest why was it stuck?  if you dont mind me asking	everything happens for a reason &lt;--an under appreciated term	sometimes it sticks with us to help bring to the surface our own similar situations or perhaps is something from our own past that we have not reconciled with ourselves
@LivPsy we are all liars in one form or another	all truths are half lies and all lies half truths
@NamXSV @EsotericExposal perhaps theory was the wrong word, perspective	evidence you have collect and studied or evidence someone else told you?	too many times we think we r experts on things that we had no hand in creating	too much believing 2nd hand info rather then going out and looking for ourselves

we cant change the past so why continue to live in it?  is it that comforting to your?  to dwell on the pain of yesterday while avoiding the splendor what you tomorrow could bring if only you make it happen.  ppl come ppl go. nothing we can do.  smile at them while you can

before you stop calling a coincidence.	there is no such thing.  your thinking of a specific one right now arent you?  thats good, your not the only one.
what you needed to see right now.  there are no coincidences.  heres a tip from me to you.  start keeping notes on all the "coincidences" that happen through out your day.  	at the end of the week review your list then ask yourself this, how many times does it have to happen...
karma never gives you anything more or less then exactly what you deserve.	this goes for every living soul on this planet.  never regret and never feel bad	everything happened exactly how it was supposed to.  that will make sense sooner then you think, or maybe this was exact...

dont be afraid to be called selfish.  thats a word ppl use against us to make us feel bad for wanting to make our lives better then what they are.  	hate your job, hate your family, hate your friends, but dont forget they all were put into your life to motivate you to keep moving
everything is temporary, even relationships.  we only have the things we have at this moment to get us ready for what we want to make into our tomorrows.  dont waste your life being miserable trying to make other ppl happy, when chances are they arent happy anyway
i made the decision to never be like everyone else ever again.  did i suffer losses along the way?  fuck yes.  i havent spoke to the ppl i was called family in month.  im unemployed and i have been with out a source of income for 2 months.  but what did i learn through it all?
what is it your avoiding?  something your ashamed of?  drugs?  sex? hate? money?  your past?  	just remember, your past is your past to teach how to be, or not to be, for the future.  no one can do the things that you can, unless you are limiting yourself to be like everyone else
am i good enough for you?  am i good enough for them?  i dont know and i dont care bcuz the only opinion that matters is mine and when it comes to the subject of me, its not an opinion.	the only time we have opinions of ourselves is when its semething we dont want to face
there is only 1 wrong answer.  can you guess what that is?  	you are more today then you were yesterday and tomorrow your going to be more then what you are today.
there are no accidents, there is no such thing as chance.  everything happens for a reason and everything has a purpose.  you never did anything that you werent suppose to do that you needed to do to learn a very valuable lesson about yourself.  what did you learn?
throughout my life i have made, what i used to consider, mistake after mistake.  it wasnt until recently that i realized that i never once made a single one.  that without the experiences that i have had, both good and bad, i wouldnt be exactly who i am right now
are you afraid to be mad?  are you afraid to say no?  are you afraid to let go and really lose your shit?  why?	dont want to hurt anyones feelings or are you afraid that you could be wrong?  chances are you are but thats not a bad thing, as long as you can admit it

@laurabusse @AudreyKitching I didn't think you were.  Sometimes my thoughts are bigger then the words that convey them.
One day I'd like to see magic taught as the science it is
@laurabusse @AudreyKitching Is all I'm saying
@laurabusse @AudreyKitching But by reason, we do not do anything that we aren't suppose to doing exactly when we are doing it	The phrase "everything happens for a reason" isn't just applicable when it's convenient	Can't fight that which guides us, hence waking up to our divine destined nature
@DoreenArney4 @AudreyKitching You put your self out there and get what you get, that's the life of a healer	You don't get to complain as I'm sure there was a reason why.  Something you did to them or rather something you don't want to admit that you did, maybe I'm wrong but Your not a victim, don't act like 1
@mchooyah @Jburgh4 @AramRoston Why?
Do not keep calm	Be irrational, you earned it	Let it out like you want to	What are you afraid of https://t.co/btSI7IN9CL
@themoontarot Unfortunately so
@DoreenArney4 @AudreyKitching Why, so you feel good about yourself?	No one owes you anything
@AudreyKitching But if all things happen for a reason and the divine acts through us 2 heal others, aren't we just doing what we are supposed to be doing exactly when we are supposed to do it?	So if it's self care we need, we will do it when we r supposed, not when another person says to, or no?
Everyone does and any who says differently is a liar		Isn't that why we are all on social media after all, becuz we have no one to connect in our manifest world	so we retreat 2 this virtual cess pool everyday 2 C who we can impress w/ useless opinions		The universe is not happy https://t.co/RyEEPSBIoH

@End_TheFederalR @fardog Why do you not account for the fear of failure that inevitably arises?	Not every passes that test		In those cases one typically retreats inwardly and avoids that  new idea for fear of successive failures		Would you agree then it only reflects an unfinished truth?

Fear is the greatest teacher of all.  More then hate or love.  Because until you lose all hope, you will never see the light of day	Not to mention you feel like a bad mother fucker after wards		Don't be afraid to be afraid
What your spiritual coach/advisor/consultant/whatever should telling you is to get pissed, get sad, get mad and glad and everything in betwixt, but most importantly, let yourself be scared.  	Frightened as if your sanity was being sucked out of your head by a big fat leech
@lIIuminatii Says you
Not getting what you want in life?	Maybe it's becuz you want what you want for the wrong reasons	Ask your self why you really want that thing.	Maybe, just maybe, you don't deserve it yet	Have you  actually learned why you keep losing it yet?	Take a look in the mirror and ask them
@cobrainfo1 But I could be wrong	That's just based off of my experience
@cobrainfo1 I was under the impression the law of attraction doesn't give what we want, it gives what we need, until of course we can learn why we aren't ready for what it is we truly want
