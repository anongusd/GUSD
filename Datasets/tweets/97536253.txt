@InsuranceEleph1 @MCins_ The consumer does have the choice to buy, use, and give that device access to their trusted network.  Just because a device has a smart label doesn't mean it's safe.  I am personally a proponent that any techonolgy using my data should be regulated or at least registered.
@InsuranceEleph1 @MCins_ People want all the convenience that technology brings but rarely want to take responsibility when they don't safeguard their in data.  What's next are we ask the government to warehouse and regulate all data to further stifle innovation?
