4/ This is a vicious lie. These kids are about to be eaten alive by a system that barely cares for American kids in it.		I repeat, The Unites States government is SNATCHING BABIES FROM PARENTS AT THE BORDER.		The slippery slope slips further.
3/ The foster care system in this country is generally an abomination, wrought with abuse and neglect. This administration claims these immigrant children are essentially heading to a version of ‚Äòsummer camp‚Äô.
2/ Parents are being given no assurances or methods for finding their children once they are processed in immigration court. It is likely parents will be deported back to their home countries without their children.		@realDonaldTrump 	@SenCoryGardner

@DevinNunes @WashTimes CYA Devin. You‚Äôre toast.
@RepMattGaetz You are so going to prison you sycophantic weasel.
@SenateMajLdr Do your job and legislate a solution to stop this madness.
@LindseyGrahamSC @CBSNews Your friend John McCain must be so ashamed of your baffling flip from honorable man holding the line against this traitorous Russian/tRUmp alliance to sycophant. Shame on you Senator Graham.
@realDonaldTrump Your FBI vetted Porter. Is this not due process Donnie? Shut up Donnie... https://t.co/x5WFzWujCk

@realDonaldTrump The report states ‚ÄòInternational‚Äô terrorism. Insanely misleading and opportunistic. Surprise, surpise! Who would think you‚Äôd mislead and misrepresent facts.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Payback is a bitch Donnie.
@KenDilanianNBC Oh, Wolff is my hero.
@Jim_Jordan What does Putin have on you, Jim?
@realDonaldTrump Schweet! Glad you‚Äôre in...now resign and America will indeed be great again!
@SethAbramson Yay!
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are so fucked little Donnie boy. So delicious watching all you narcissists tear each other apart. See you in the history books listed under ‚ÄòTraitors‚Äô. üòÇü§£
@realDonaldTrump Such respect for the people of the United States as they take back their corrupt government from a narcissistic man child.

@LindseyGrahamSC Do you your ousting in 2018?
@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/QfkHlfZ4iW
@Amy_Siskind Perhaps even more likely that he knows Russian Oligarch money flooded the entire GOP in 2016 and he knew about that. Ryan is complicit in it all.

@realDonaldTrump It was an incorrect date you drama queen...
@realDonaldTrump Ha! That is all. Just a simple plain old HA! What a joke you are.
@InvestigateRU @mkraju @CNN How convenient. She‚Äôs was, is, the intentional firewall between tRUmp‚Äôs people and Twitler himself.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Kind of fun watching you squirm Donnie. Miska Flynn has flipped. You‚Äôre finished. You know it. Your Republican ‚Äòallies‚Äô are just kissing your ass to get something passed before Mueller comes for you. Thankfully you‚Äôre used to wearing orange! Full body orange in your future!
@JaydaBF @realDonaldTrump You are a sick and disgusting human being. Have you no moral compass? You are the president of the United States for Christ‚Äôs sake!
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC OWNED. Get out you corrupt AF pawn.
@realDonaldTrump And to think, currently a Republican candidate for the senate has been found out to be a pedophile who was banned from malls, and you, the President of The United States, has remained silent. Transparently partisan AF you opportunistic predator.
@realDonaldTrump #traitor
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre finished. American justice is coming for you and your cronies. #resign
@SpeakerRyan Stop being a money grubbing politician in the pocket of billionaire interests and who is willing to overlook an unstable man with nuke codes
@RexTilllerson Are you fucking kidding me! You are the top dinplomat for the United States of America, and you are tweeting this nonesense?
@RexTilllerson You're our head diplomat around the world? Tweeting this type of garbage? Shameful.
@realDonaldTrump 2 weeks later?! Disgraceful.
@ericgarland Ha!!!
@marcorubio What are you going to do about it? Will you actually stand up to this monster in action? Or just quite vague bible verses?

RUMOR: Rumor has it tRUmp ordered tonight's fight at The White House, and Mexico is paying for it.
@Khanoisseur Jebus...these amoral lying sacks.
@Pol_Advisor @washingtonpost You're a bigoted opportunistic pig.
@realDonaldTrump Her name was Heather Heyer. She was murdered as a result of the hateful rhetoric you have spewed for the last many years. You're a disgrace.
@RogerJStoneJr @politico Yes

#PresdientOfTheConfederacy
I'm sure it's because he's a history buff and not appeasing his fringe white nationalist base who terrorized Americans on American soil.
tRUmp making an exception to his 'I only like winners' rule defending these monuments to honor confederacy who were clearly the losers.
@marcorubio  https://t.co/hWpW7MiLnn
@SpeakerRyan  https://t.co/MJMlVB28rl
@SpeakerRyan You have zero moral authority. You won't until you and your fellow Republicans censure this man and begin the process of removing him.
@FLOTUS @MichaelCohen212 You should share this sentiment with your husband, who's heart appears to be filled with hate, as evidenced by his communication.
@PressSec @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Curious what your legal exposure will ultimately be as the iceberg that is Mueller sinks the Trumptanic. I'm betting you'll lawyer up in Aug
@VP The Trumptanic is going down, and you're about to drown with it. Don't get your hopes up to be #46. You know what you've done.
