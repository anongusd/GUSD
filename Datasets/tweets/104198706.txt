I have devoted my life to caring for children and any insinuation otherwise is shameful and disgusting.
I don’t think firearms are needed in churches. Let’s have a conversation on gun safety.
There’s no question there’s frustration out there. My wife and I were out there on Monday visiting with teachers. I’m a good listener, we want to make sure they have our support.
If we’re going to be able to recruit and retain talented teachers, we’re going to have to pay them. We took the lead on a teacher pay raise and I’m glad the House agrees.
I support @MarkWarner’s legislation to ensure this never happens again. Most people live paycheck to paycheck. We cannot do this again.
Obviously states want to help those impacted but I would want to reinforce to Congress and the president: do not use federal workers as pawns again.
These were TSA agents, members of our Coast Guard—you want to talk about impact, they were keeping us safe without receiving their paychecks.
We have about 130,000 federal employees who live in Virginia, about 64,000 of whom were impacted by this federal shutdown. It’s a shame they were used as pawns in this disagreement. No excuse, for no good reason.
Anything we can do to alleviate congestion, we’re moving in that direction. This is $1 billion of transportation investments announced yesterday to make more progress.
I have a good working relationship with Governor Hogan and we all agree there’s a need for a remedy.
Our goal is to move goods and people as efficiently and effectively as we can, and the four transportation projects we announced yesterday will help us do that.

We’re not going to agree on everything, but if we look for what we have in common, we’ll do better work for the people of Virginia. I look forward to working with all of you to find our common ground. #SOTC
I believe strongly that we often find what we’re looking for. If we come here looking for gridlock and partisan battles, we will likely find those. But if we look for what unites us, what gives us the best opportunity to get things done, we will find that. #SOTC
Virginia can be the 38th and final state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment this year—it’s time we do so. #VAratifyERA #SOTC
In this day and age, that means ensuring the elimination of unnecessary and prohibitive barriers to voting. I’m proposing we finally allow no-excuse absentee voting. #SOTC
The story of Virginia is rooted in the simultaneous pursuit of both liberty and enslavement. As we approach the anniversary of the first representative General Assembly in the New World, we have a responsibility to confront this truth. #SOTC
It’s clear that we need to conform our tax code to the federal code, because Virginians deserve a simplified process. After that, I’m open to a discussion about how we respond to these tax changes in a fair way. #SOTC
This credit already exists in our law, and it benefits middle-class workers: teachers, law enforcement officers, veterans, folks working at restaurants and department stores, and small businesses. Republicans and Democrats alike have supported this credit, because it works. #SOTC
In Virginia, we can work together to restore balance and fairness on the state level. I’ve put a proposal on the table to respond to the federal tax changes by making our existing Earned Income Tax Credit refundable. #SOTC
Our tax code should work for everyone—not just the highest earners. That's only fair. But Washington is actually making these disparities worse. #SOTC
We can continue our progress on criminal justice reform by ending the practice of suspending driver’s licenses over failure to pay court costs and fees, and by ending the suspension of licenses for non-driving offenses. #SOTC
Moving forward on this front will have the same significance as our work together to increase the felony larceny threshold: one mistake won’t define Virginians for the rest of their lives. #SOTC
Making simple possession of marijuana a civil penalty will ease overcrowding in our jails and prisons, and free up our law enforcement and court resources for offenses that are a true threat to public safety. #SOTC
Tonight we have some good news from our criminal justice system to announce—for the third year in a row, our prison recidivism rate is the lowest in the country. #SOTC
My budget makes historic investments in the protection of our environment. These proposals will lead to cleaner water and air for all Virginians, and they will also position us to create the next generation of energy jobs in solar, wind, and other emerging technologies. #SOTC
If we want to ensure that every Virginian has the same shot at economic opportunity, we need to position ourselves to respond to the growing reality of climate change. #SOTC
We all know that current resources are not adequate to the task of making #I81 a better, safer road. I’m happy to say that we’re working across the aisle, with legislators from both parties whose districts include #I81, to make this happen. #SOTC
If we are able to agree that we need to act when we have a problem with highway safety and preventable deaths, then surely we can agree to work together to keep more Virginians alive by improving gun safety. #SOTC
If we want every Virginian to have a chance at a healthy, safe, successful life then we need to have a conversation about responsible gun ownership. #SOTC
We still have work to do to make sure everyone has access to health care. That means all health care, including reproductive care. I’m proposing that we put into the Code of Virginia that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health care decisions. #SOTC
Last year, we lost 1,227 Virginians to opioid overdose. We lost 1,534 Virginians to overdoses from all drugs. It is my belief that an overdose death is a preventable one, and I want to do everything I can as governor and as a doctor to bring awareness to this epidemic. #SOTC
No longer will these Virginians have to worry about whether they can afford to see a doctor, or get worrisome symptoms checked out. No longer will they fear that one illness will drive them to bankruptcy. #SOTC
Kara wasn’t the only one who knew what this care would mean. On the first day of enrollment, @CoverVA had a flood of 6,000 calls. To date, 200,000+ Virginia adults have already enrolled in our expanded Medicaid program. Their coverage began at the start of 2019. #SOTC
We joined together to expand Medicaid coverage for people like Kara Murdock, uninsured since she was dropped from her parents’ insurance at age 26. On Halloween night, Kara camped out so she could be first in line to apply for coverage under the new eligibility rules. #SOTC
Until we come together to ensure universal broadband access, we're keeping opportunity out of reach for entire communities in Virginia. Weeks ago I shared an ambitious budget proposal to speed up our progress and achieve universal broadband access within the next few years. #SOTC
Expensive tuition and high student debt can close the door to opportunity for too many people. My budget would offer more tuition assistance, and requires our institutions to create tuition predictability plans. #SOTC
We have a world-class education system—but we need to make long-term investments to ensure we remain competitive in a 21st century economy. That's why I'm eager to work with you to give our teachers the largest single-year pay raise in 15 years. #SOTC
I want to thank @FirstLadyVA for leading a new version of the Children’s Cabinet that is placing an unprecedented focus on early childhood development. Thanks to their work, Virginia was awarded a $10 million federal grant to improve our statewide early education system. #SOTC
With this @Microsoft news, @Amazon’s decision to select Virginia for a new corporate headquarters, and @MicronTech expansion, it’s clear that our efforts to bring new jobs and investments to our Commonwealth are paying off. #SOTC
Tonight, I’m proud to announce that @Microsoft will expand its data center campus in Mecklenburg County, creating more than 100 new jobs. This is a huge win for rural Virginia and we should all be proud. #SOTC
Our administration has made it a priority to ensure that every region of Virginia is part of our economic success. This year, I’ve made nearly 100 visits to rural parts of Virginia to announce more than $1.25 billion in new capital expenditures. #SOTC
Since I took office, we’ve announced more than 41,000 new jobs, with more than $8 billion in new capital investment. #SOTC
I’m here tonight to tell you that the state of the Commonwealth is strong, and we are poised to make it even stronger. #SOTC
The successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually—but because we worked together. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive. #SOTC
We created a parental leave plan for state employees, providing parents an important opportunity to be with their new children. And we have built on our economic momentum and announced many new jobs and investments in every single corner of our Commonwealth. #SOTC
We agreed to boost pay for our educators and retool our workforce development efforts. We worked together to make government more efficient through regulatory reform, and to be a better steward of taxpayers’ dollars. #SOTC
We broke down decades of gridlock on criminal justice reform by finally raising the felony larceny threshold. We led the Washington region in securing a dedicated source of revenue for @wmata for the first time in the system’s history. #SOTC
We passed an historic budget that means 400,000 more Virginians will be able to see a doctor when they are sick. We strengthened our Commonwealth’s finances by shoring up our reserves and preserving our valuable Triple-A bond rating. #SOTC
I want to acknowledge a moment of history we are sharing together. This is the first time in the 400-year history of the VA General Assembly that a woman has led a legislative caucus. Congratulations to Leader @EFillerCorn on this historic achievement! #SOTC
In our first year working together, we have achieved major accomplishments that fulfilled our mandate to improve Virginians’ lives. Tonight, I’ll outline my plans to keep the Commonwealth moving forward. #SOTC

Something I’ve been an advocate for is nonpartisan redistricting, to do everything we can to take the politics out of redistricting. I urge everyone to talk to their legislators about how they feel on this issue.
I’ve put a proposal on the table to make the earned income tax credit fully refundable and let Virginians keep more of their paychecks.
There have been federal tax changes and it’s usually straightforward that we pass legislation conforming to those changes. That’s a separate conversation from tax reform.
And lastly, we’re adding funding to the Literary Fund, which provides low-interest loans to our schools for school construction.
There is power in every child and we want to make sure our children have access to a world-class education. We’re also adding $70 million to our at-risk add on and per pupil allocation, which is flexible funding available to our schools.
We balance our budget each year and because of how our economy is doing this year, I think we have an opportunity to invest responsibly.
Yesterday we announced over $250 million will be infused into our education system, starting with our teachers. They were given a 3% raise this year. I’m adding another 2%. If successful, that will be the single largest one-year pay raise for our teachers in 15 years.
We’re going to have storms, whether they are snow storms or hurricanes. When we declare states of emergency, it’s for a reason. Our first responders do such a good job for us and we need to help them by heeding safety warnings.
I think you will see serious discussions during this upcoming session on transportation and paying for these projects. We need to make sure people can get from point A to point B.
We had a couple of @VSPPIO troopers get hit as they were out responding this weekend and that’s exactly why we ask folks to heed our warnings about getting out on the road during these conditions.
We stayed and monitored snow through the weekend and I’m proud of our state agencies @VaDOT, @VSPPIO, and @VDEM. Like after any event like this, we’ll review our response.

We are committed to being the most veteran-friendly state in the country. We just opened another veterans center at the Pentagon to ensure that we're reaching out and taking care of their needs.
I believe in climate change. I can promise you that the sea level is rising. We have a resiliency officer, we've opened up charging systems and are moving towards electric buses. We're looking at considerable investments in conservation. We can move a lot forward working together
I would hope the redistricting issue gets resolved in an expeditious manner. That's what the people deserve.
We haven't seen a lot of progress prior to now, but I hope this new Congress will change that.
We saw back in 2017 when we ran statewide that there was a lot of enthusiasm, excitement, and people were looking for a change. We saw that energy continue in 2018. I think the people spoke.

I hope they will find a way to remedy things without shutting down the government. We've been down this road before and it's not in our best interest.
We've had an overwhelming response when it comes to the enrollment we're seeing for Medicaid expansion. Since we opened in November, over 100,000 Virginians have enrolled.
I'm most proud of people from both sides of the aisle coming together to do what's right for Virginia. As a physician, it's been wonderful to see Medicaid expansion through. We've still got a lot to do, I've got 3 years left, and there's still a lot of progress to make.
We said from the start that whether it was Maryland or Washington or Virginia, a win for one was going to be a win for all of us.
We started this process with securing the dedicated source of revenue for Metro, which is vitally important to our economy. Whether it's Amazon or anybody else, our transportation infrastructure in Northern Virginia was something we were going to have to work on either way.
Virginia has a lot to offer, we're a diverse state. I think @Amazon wanted an area where they could be part of the community and feel at home.
Doubling the tech-talent pipeline was certainly a critical component. I stress all the time that with some urgency, we have really tried to diversify our economy. This investment will help schools across the Commonwealth, including community colleges.
Three very important components of our partnership proposal and areas that we needed to focus on whether or not @Amazon selected Virginia. 		https://t.co/5Xnc6qMKda
I think we came up a with a package that was innovative and focused. I'm so proud of our economic development teams and @VACommTrade for all of their hard work on this.
On @amazon: It was a really exciting day for Virginia. For Virginia to come out on top as number one, that's something for us to be really proud of.

There has been really great regional cooperation with Maryland and DC on attracting Amazon, with all of us agreeing if it came to any one of us that it’d be a win for the region.
My take is that people are looking for leaders who are there for the right reasons. I think that’s what we saw a week ago.
When I talk to people, I hear most often that they want a good job. That’s what I’m focused on as Governor.
I think Amazon was interested in our ability to train the workforce, transportation, and the chance be a real part of the community.
One of the things that may not be in the headlines is the investments in higher education across the entire Commonwealth.
No region in Virginia should be dependent on one industry and this is a great opportunity to diversify on our economy. To bring in a company like Amazon that can bring 25,000 new jobs is an opportunity.
The majority of our commitments are investments in education and transportation infrastructure. It’s a great, innovative package that I think is in the best interest of Virginia.
This has been a team effort from both sides of the aisle. This is 25,000 new jobs coming into the Commonwealth that will bring a tremendous amount of revenue into Virginia.
I think yesterday’s @Amazon announcement displayed Virginia at its best.

We are strongly encouraging Metro and the folks who run it to provide a good service, a safe service and to make it affordable.
Our unemployment rate in Virginia 2.9%, but that's not the case in every part of Virginia. There's no way in 2018 a business can grow or start without access to broadband. Our goal is in 10 years, everyone will have access but I'm not a patient person &amp; I want it to happen sooner
There's been a lot of preparation and I think we will be proud as expansion gets rolled out.
I would encourage everyone to visit https://t.co/Qxa83yIDnW and there are phone numbers available for those who have questions about whether they're newly eligible.
We're excited! Tomorrow, November 1st, people can begin enrollment through Medicaid expansion to start coverage on January 1st. You can visit https://t.co/Qxa83yIDnW for more information on eligibility and how to sign up.
We have put the best package we can on the table, and I think we're in a good position.
I think a lot of us are awaiting Amazon's decision. I have been impressed by the partnership with Governor Hogan and Mayor Bowser, who have been great to work with as we think about what a selection would mean for our region.
I think we have to go out and listen to what's on voters' minds. And what I hear are several things. People want a job they can support themselves and their families with. They want a world-class education for their children. They want access to affordable, quality healthcare.
I have heard so many people over the last year say, "I've always known it's important to vote, but now I'm taking it a step farther. I'm getting out there and knocking on doors and making phone calls."
I would ask people to look at what's going on in Virginia right now. Our unemployment rate is at 2.9%, the lowest it's been in 10 years. We're ranked as the 4th top state for business. Democrats know how to govern and we have a good track record of doing that.
We have to say enough is enough and make some changes. We need leaders who will sit at the table, put the politics aside, and take action.
We have to address gun violence in this country. We should be able to go into our houses of worship without fear.
Our diversity makes us stronger--we should embrace that. The rhetoric, the fear mongering, that's what not what we need right now.
At the vigil at Adas Israel two nights ago, I made it crystal clear that we are not going to condone hatred in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
On #Pittsburgh: We need to ask ourselves as a society where the hatred is coming from. I take care of a lot of babies as a pediatrician, and you see the love and hope in their eyes. As leaders, we need to take a different approach.

RT @VDEM: Virginians should prepare for tropical force winds, heavy rainfall, inland flooding and coastal flooding in Southeastern Virginia…
One of the things I saw in 2017 was that there was a tremendous amount of energy for not just voting, but also for volunteering. I think we’ll see that again this year. Great number of women running for office across Virginia and the country—it’s exciting.
There are a lot of people who text and drive at the same time. It’s dangerous. Everybody should have their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel.
We’re doing a lot of upgrades on 95 and there are discussions about what we can do to improve 81. It’s very very busy and at times, very dangerous as well.
The message here has to be the process. The redistricting process has to be fair for Virginians.
People should be picking their representatives, rather than elected officials choosing their voters.
I think this is a time that voters need to watch what’s going on with redistricting and I hope folks will support a nonpartisan redistricting plan.
My top priority in Virginia is making sure that every Virginian has a job they can support themselves and their families with. Virginia is ranked as the #4 state in the country in which to do business but I want Virginia to get back to #1.
I want survivors of sexual assault to know that they have support in Virginia, including access to a 24-hour domestic violence and sexual assault hotline.
I look at the additions to the Supreme Court and I worry about some of the decisions that will be made on women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, and other issues I care about.
I have a great relationship with our folks on Finance and Appropriations. We’re one of 29 states that have earned income tax credit, but it’s not refundable in Virginia. That’s a conversation that I want to have with our money leaders.
There are a lot of opportunities to invest wisely in Virginia’s future but the bottom line is that the Commonwealth is in a very good position financially.
We passed a historic budget, we expanded Medicaid, we’ve done good work on criminal justice reform together. It’s good to sit down at the table, put politics aside as best we can, and do what’s in the best interest of Virginians.
What I have tried to do is bring civility to governing as my administration stated this past year. I’ve worked with people on both sides of the aisle and we got some great things done this year.
These are tough decisions but we work with our localities, our department of emergency management, and with FEMA to come to the best conclusion to keep people safe.
We always hope for the best and prepare for the worst. To date we’ve spent about $44 million in preparation for Hurricane Florence. And we’re fortunate to have the president declare a state of emergency, which means about 75% of the costs will be reimbursed to the state.
These are powerful storms and certainly our thoughts are with Florida. We’ve sent some resources down there in order to help, including search and rescue teams.

I don’t see patients anymore but as a physician I have been traveling around to lecture our medical students about their role in combatting the opioid crisis.
We were able to expand healthcare to provide up to 400,000 working Virginians through the legislature this year, which we’re proud of. I would encourage folks to visit https://t.co/PWSm2mn01V to see if they’re newly eligible and give them information about enrollment.
At the end of the day we need a map that is fair and constitutional. The bottom line is that time is of the essence and the sooner do this the better.
The courts have the General Assembly the opportunity to right this wrong in June. I didn’t see a whole lot happening so I called a special session.
Women will have a tremendous influence on elections this year. We have a number of female candidates this year that will be successful.
Governor McAuliffe and I are good friends. He’s traveling around the country to help candidates across the country in the midterms. I can’t speak to his plans after but he did a great job as governor.
We want to encourage our students who are of voting age to register to vote. We have a registration challenge going in our high schools announced yesterday as part of #NationalVoterRegistrationDay
Voting is something we take seriously and it’s what makes our democracy strong. Our registration website was down for about an hour on technical issues, but we worked quickly to resolve. We’re investing resources wisely to make sure that our systems are working well.
Mayor Bowser, Governor Hogan, and I have met recently in front of Greater Washington area business leaders recently. We all agree that workforce development is critical to attracting businesses and on the importance of funding Metro. We are working together for the region.
I grew up on Virginia’s Eastern Shore—I have seen what these storms can do. When people don’t heed these evacuation orders they put themselves at risk but we should also think about the first responders who put themselves on the line.
One of the things I think we can do is look at renewable energy and to reduce our carbon footprint. I’m proud of my administration’s focus on renewables.
This is the first year we’ve used the tiered evacuation system. Virginians can go to https://t.co/euzv6uT25X to make sure they know what zone they are in.
We’ll take a look at our preparations by doing an after action review and see what worked and what we can adjust.
Our neighbors in the Carolinas were hit very hard. To date we’ve spent about $44 million and we’ll submit expenses to FEMA for reimbursement.
#HurricaneFlorence was a serious storm. We prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. I’m proud of our state personnel and first responders and the coordination we had with the federal government.

We have a lot of people at the table in a bipartisan way to figure out how we can make our schools safer.
In June the federal court deemed 11 House of Delegates districts unconstitutional. The Democratic minority put a remedy plan on the table. Thus far we haven’t seen any map from the majority.
Every vote counts. When people go to the polls on Election Day, that’s what makes our democracy strong. I’ve reviewed the JLARC report and we have a new commissioner over elections. We’re making changes and I want to assure Virginians.
When these storms approach, we do a lot of preparation. When the president signed a declaration that offered up federal resources that means resources that will help pay for a lot of the things we’re doing to prepare.

I want to emphasize that we want to keep Virginians safe.
I’ve ordered a mandatory evacuation of Zone A, a low lying area of our coast. People need to go inland and to higher land.
#HurricaneFlorence is a big storm that everyone should take seriously. I declared a state of emergency so we could begin setting up state resources. Yesterday the president signed an emergency declaration offering up federal resources.

Last year we lost 1,227 Virginians to opioid overdose. As a physician and governor, I take that very seriously. In fact I’ve just completed 3 of 5 lectures I’ll be making to our medical students about treating a cute and chronic pain.
We’re certainly paying attention to actions the state can take on #NetNeutrality.
Ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment is the right thing to do. We’ll keep trying in Virginia.
We have an opportunity to make the earned income tax credit refundable for Virginians AND make investments in our long-term success on education, workforce development, and access to broadband.
Because of the changes at the federal level in the tax code, there is revenue that will come into the Commonwealth—about half a billion dollars. Those federal changes are cutting short folks who make less than $50k a year.
There’s an urgency to this. We need to get moving.
Democrats will put a constitutional, fair map on the table on August 30. To be at a starting place we need to put constitutional maps on the table and Republicans should do that as well.
This is a great opportunity for Virginia voters to redraw these districts the court has found unconstitutional. I’ve called a special session because we need to move this process forward and complete this.
A tremendous amount of preparation went into the anniversary weekend and I’m proud of everyone involved.
We sent a clear message that these white supremacists are not welcome in the Commonwealth.
Last month, I assured Virginians that we do not condone the events in Charlottesville a year ago. I’m proud of our law enforcement and think they did a tremendous job keeping Virginians safe.

We’re doing everything we can to let folks who are dealing with opioid addiction know that we are here to help. I’m traveling around the commonwealth lecturing at our medical schools about what we can do as physicians to tackle this challenge.
Our economy is doing really well. Our unemployment rate is 3.2%, the lowest it’s been in ten years. We just got named the fourth top state in the country in which to do business.
On our economy in general, I’m going to be biased and say the important work on the economy happens at the state level.
There are a record number of some running for governor’s races and seats in Congress this year. That’s been interesting to watch.
Let me tell you where the rubber meets the road with our teachers: we’re paying our teachers here about $9200 less than the national average. We’ve given our teachers a raise this year but we need to do more to attract and retain talent.
What I hear every day that if we can train the workforce, businesses here in the Commonwealth will grow and we’ll attract more businesses to Virginia.
Education is a top priority of mine and my administration. Let’s jump out of the box and think about how we prepare our students for 21st century jobs.
If something happens in DC, it can easily affect northern Virginia. We’re prepared in Charlottesville, we’re prepared in northern Virginia.
We want to support the First Amendment and the right to do that peacefully. Should that not be peaceful, we’ll be prepared.
We feel well prepared to respond should anything take place. There has been coordination and collaboration among our local and state law enforcement agencies.
On the upcoming anniversary of the events in Charlottesville last year: we don’t condone hatred and bigotry in the Commonwealth. We learned a lot and have made a lot of modifications.

We need to continue to have conversations about how we can make our schools, our movie theaters, all of these different venues safe and guns have to be part of this discussion. #AskThe
On #NationalSchoolWalkout: One of the things that I am encouraged by, I was out there with the students that marched on Friday. I was also at the Washington march and talked to students from Parkland, their families, their doctors – and this energy is not going away. #AskThe

There are 32 states that have expanded coverage and not one of them has reversed. I talk to governors all over the country who say they are glad they expanded Medicaid. #AskThe
On Medicaid: Let’s not leave resources on the table. Let’s bring them back to Virginia and use them for folks that need these (disability) waivers. #AskThe
Veterans mainly just want healthcare, they want their own system. I think what we need to do rather than discussing privatizing the VA is to talk about how we make it stronger. #AskThe
I am very concerned about the health of the VA system in Virginia. We need to make sure that our veterans and our families have access to the care they need and deserve. #AskThe
There’s a finite amount of resources that we have for transportation. Route 1 and Route 28 projects were lined up, ready to go, and now that funding may be jeopardized. #AskThe
These were proposals that were passed back in 2013. And the occupancy tax is paid for by people who are visiting and don’t even live in this area. That’s a good way to pay for #Metro and it’s shortsighted this happened the way it did. #AskThe
It was straightforward, it was overwhelming the people that said don’t take away money from the transportation authority. #AskThe
On #Metro funding: It’s not the last word. We’re very proud in Virginia that we took the lead with a dedicated source of revenue for Metro. #AskThe
Seth is my assistant and he's 24 today. What a gentleman that he would come to work on his birthday. #AskThe

We’re going to have a budget. Virginia has never been in a position where we go past June 30th...Time is of the essence because of our AAA bond rating. #AskThe
We have the numbers, we know what we need to do and we need to put the excuses aside and get a budget that’s good for Virginians. #AskThe
On Medicaid expansion: As you said we have a couple of Senate Republicans who are willing to work with us. I would encourage the Senate to get back to Richmond and get us a budget that works. #AskThe
The most important bill didn’t get done and that’s the budget. It’s time to stop the excuses and get back to Richmond and get us a budget that’s structurally sound and expands healthcare for up to 400k Virginians. #AskThe

On Medicaid expansion: I can’t predict the future, but if the money is on the table we’re going to have to take it. That’s my business perspective. #AskTheGovernor
On Speaker Ryan's retirement: "I regret that policy is being made the way it is in Washington over Twitter. As someone who’s served as a state senator and lieutenant governor, I know policy making is a team sport." #AskTheGovernor
When we’re offering political solutions for problems that don’t exist, that’s not a good way of making policy. To reiterate, I want to do everything we can to keep our schools and communities safe. #AskTheGovernor
There are consequences to limited resources. When we have the opportunity to bring back resources to Virginia, that means the chance to give our law enforcement raises. #AskTheGovernor
The way to keep our communities safe is to support our local law enforcement. #AskTheGovernor
It’s important to get a budget that’s structurally sound, one that we can rely on in the years to come. And if we aren’t able to do that and we lose our AAA bond rating that’s going to mean a loss for the Commonwealth of Virginia. #AskTheGovernor
I gave a lot, they gave a lot. That’s the way we get things done in Virginia. We compromise. #AskTheGovernor
All you have to do is look at the contrast between the House budget and the Senate budget and you’ll see what that means. It’s a difference of $400 million. #AskTheGovernor
We are sending our tax money up to Washington each year to support the Affordable Care Act and all we’re trying to do is bring that money back to Virginia. #AskTheGovernor

On tax revenue legislation: Arlington leadership should deal with these golf courses and I have asked them to do just that #AskThe
I've tried to emphasize to the House and the Senate the importance of individuals having access to healthcare and I think they appreciate that. I'm confident we'll have a budget in the near future that works for Virginia #AskThe
We were in a very good place at the end of the session. The House stepped up to the plate and we had very good negotiations. We just need to convince the Senate to get on board with our plan #AskThe
I'm ready and willing to work with both the House and Senate and get back to where we were and perhaps take it even farther to get a budget that works for all of Virginia #AskThe
It is the same budget with one exception -- what I wanted to make clear was that any revenue that came into the state would go into our rainy day fund so we could shore that up and preserve our AAA bond rating #AskThe
I remind people all the time, any business that says it's a good idea to give their competitors over $5 million a day -- as a neurologist, I'd say you ought to have your head examined. #AskThe
It's important that we complete a budget as soon as we can to preserve our AAA bond rating. I'll continue to work with legislators from both sides of the aisle to get it done. #AskThe
The most important bill, which is the budget bill, is what we didn't get accomplished and I'm disappointed. The House did great work, courageous work, by including Medicaid expansion in their budget #AskThe
We have an opportunity to bring resources back to Commonwealth by expanding Medicaid #AskThe
With urgency we really need to open up the pipeline of training for 21st-century jobs. #AskThe
I encourage folks to continue to be vocal, to continue this energy, &amp; to reach out to legislators to demand they do something to make sure we don't have any more of these tragedies #AskThe
We want to ensure we're doing everything we can to make our schools safe. #AskThe
I was here on Saturday for the #MarchForOurLives. I met that morning with students and families from #Parkland. I would invite anyone who doesn't believe in responsible gun ownership to talk to them and get a feel for what they're going through #AskThe

There are a number of projects that need to be built here in Northern Virginia and I'm sensitive to that. I'm confident we can come up with a plan to fund Metro and take some of the pressure off the transportation authority.

I am encouraged by the General Assembly's progress crafting a budget that reflects our priorities, particularly on expanding health coverage. I will work with our conferees to ensure that the final product works for all Virginians, no matter who you are or where you live.
By funding projects like these, we are working to ensure that more Virginians in need have safe and affordable housing options. https://t.co/aAfD2CQ6PY https://t.co/9n8kfqGzGT
I've practiced medicine for over 25 years taking care of children and their families. I look at politics as a different way to help these children and families on another level. #AskThe
I am very tough on crime. The abolishment of parole has worked well in Virginia. and I do not have any plans to change that.
I will always stand up for Virginia when I need to. #AskThe
If there are areas that @realDonaldTrump and I agree on I am happy to work with him on those but if there are areas that I do not agree with I will make that known as well.
We had a horrific tragedy in Charlottesville last summer. I said at that time that we need to have conversations about putting these monuments in context. Let's find creative ways to tell all sides of Virginia's history.
At the end of the day we need to have comprehensive #ImmigrationReform and that starts up in Washington.
There are a lot of things I've been able to work with folks from both parties on this legislative session. At the end of the day we all want to do what is best for Virginia. #AskThe
I heard a lot from folks on the campaign trail including access to quality and affordable heath care, safe communities, quality education, economic opportunities, and inclusivity
I need people from both sides of the aisle to come to the table to work together to come up with a solution to keep Virginians safe. @1140WRVA
There should be a method to make sure that dangerous people do not have access to firearms.
I grew up hunting and fishing and I have always been taught to respect guns. But there has been a proliferation of guns on our streets and we need commonsense solutions. #AskThe
I want to make Virginia safe for everyone so we can go out and enjoy all that our Commonwealth has to offer.
#GunControl has been a difficult discussion. Let's find something that we can agree on. Promote responsible gun ownership, ban bump stocks and universal background checks.
It is a tremendous honor to be in this office and I look forward to what we will be able to accomplish over the next four years.
Excited to be on @1140WRVA this morning for “Ask the Governor” https://t.co/VzS5uo56sa
Obamacare is the law of the land and we need to make sure we look at the best options for our state. And one of these is Medicaid expansion. We need to bring these resources back to Virginia #AskThe

We cannot have other countries meddling in our elections. We watched this very closely in our 2017 state level elections. This is unacceptable and we need to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. @WTOP #AskThe
Health care is a right and Virginians should not have to choose between putting food on the table or going to a health care provider
Families should not be one health bill away from financial demise. Let's put away the excuses and do what is best for the families of Virginia #Medicaid #AskThe
I had a productive conversation at the White House with @realDonaldTrump about the importance of the @PortofVirginia and the military presence in Virginia
There are many different ways to take a comprehensive approach to #guncontrol and we are looking at the best options to keep Virginians safe. #AskThe
I'm very sensitive to transportation issues. We are monitoring the tolling situation on I-66 and we are working to make the roads more efficient for everyone
We're doing a lot in Virginia with innovation and workforce training. We're in a great position to attract more businesses here
Virginia is a great place to live, work and raise a family in and we hope @amazon will see that. @WTOP
An efficient working #metro is vitally important to our economy as well as Maryland and DC.
My cabinet is the first in Virginia history that is a majority women and they have been doing great work so far
The first #AskThe Governor is off to a great start @WTOP https://t.co/tDvSBTAoif
We still have a lot of work to do with mental health. We want to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We need to look at gun control comprehensively. #AskThe
Our politicians and policymakers need to listen to the people. It's time for us to take action.
People continue to be killed every day from gun violence. We do not need these weapons of war on our streets. Let's find something we can agree on and see what we can do to make our society safer. @WTOP
The fact that we have people on both sides of the aisle talking about expanding Medicaid is very important right. We've made progress but we need to discuss other important issues including gun control #AskThe
We want to continue to promote economic activity across Virginia, we want all children to have access to quality education and most importantly we want everyone to have access to quality and affordable healthcare
Virginians are looking for leadership and for people from both sides of the aisle to do what's best for Virginia

“They are counting on us to work together to solve these problems and make Virginia work better for everyone, no matter who they are or where they live.	 	And I firmly believe we are up to that task.”
“They are counting on us to deal with each other with civility and understanding, ready to acknowledge that we all came here with the goal of helping the people we serve.”
“They are counting on us to use every dollar they send us wisely, to the greatest possible benefit to our economy and their lives.	 	They are counting on us to fight for every person, even those who may not have the loudest voices here in Richmond.”
“Virginians are counting on us to answer big challenges with big solutions, even if that requires us to put the common good ahead of our own partisan instincts.”
“Our counterparts in Washington D.C. remind us daily of how easy it is to allow good-faith ideological disagreements to devolve into partisan warfare that drowns out the needs of the people.	 	In Virginia, we’re better than that.”
“These proposals are solutions to problems that stand between us and the future our fellow Virginians deserve.”
“During the campaign I was encouraged to see leaders in the other party agree to close a loophole in our ethics laws that allows public officials to spend campaign money for personal use.	 	This step will assure Virginians that we are here to serve their interests, not our own.”
“I have proposed a Borrower’s Bill of rights to protect Virginians from predatory student lenders, as well as a state ombudsman to connect Virginians with resources and information to help them pay their loans as soon as possible.”
“This year we should make the dream of a college education more attainable by tackling the difficult issue of rising student debt.”
“We should also work together to join the rest of the nation and raise the threshold for felony larceny...		There is no excuse for the criminal act of theft, but a teenager who steals one used iPhone or a pair of boots should not have her entire life defined by that one mistake.”
“My team and I will continue that policy over the next four years so that men and women who make mistakes and serve their time can reenter society as full partners in our democracy, not second-class citizens.”
“On the first day of this session, Governor McAuliffe spoke to you about the importance of second chances in our criminal justice system.		I was proud to stand beside him as he made history by restoring more civil rights to former offenders than any governor in American history.”
“We can invest the significant revenues Clean Energy Virginia will generate to create clean energy jobs in rural communities, help families lower their electrical bills, and solidify our position as a global leader in renewable energy.”
“I will also support a bill this session that will allow us to take full advantage of this process by joining a coalition of states called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.”
“The Clean Energy Virginia initiative is an incredible opportunity to create the next generation of energy jobs and lead the fight against climate change -- and my administration will implement it fully.”
“Last year, Governor McAuliffe signed an Executive Directive to begin the process of capping carbon emissions from Virginia’s electric utilities and use the power of the market to foster growth and innovation in the clean energy sector.”
“As a native of the Eastern Shore, a scientist, and a resident of Hampton Roads, I can tell you personally that, no matter what politicians in Washington say, climate change is real.	 	Sea levels are rising.	 	It affects us every day.”
“Let’s reverse that troubling trend by passing no-excuse absentee voting, so more people can have a say in their future without jumping through unnecessary hoops.”
“Unfortunately, Virginia law imposes many onerous and unnecessary restrictions on voting that discourage participation for many people.”
“Voting is the most fundamental action a citizen can take in a democracy.	 	Choosing leaders and holding them accountable is how citizens shape the future for all of us.”
“As we begin our work, let’s ensure that all Virginians can realize their potential, no matter who they are, where they live, or whom they love.”
“This Commonwealth is home to people from every corner of the globe, every faith tradition, every political perspective and every income level.	 	We are also home to people who too often face discrimination or unnecessary obstacles to equality.”
“Building a better Virginia for everyone means embracing and leveraging the incredible diversity of the people who live here.”
“We must act together this year to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.”
“As long as the people who sent us all here continue to cry out for solutions to the epidemic of gun violence, we will fight on this ground.”
“As long as schools, churches, offices and concert venues are exposed to horrific, preventable violence, we will fight on this ground.”
“As long as Virginians’ lives are at risk because there are too many guns in the hands of people who would use them to harm others, we will fight on this ground.”
“This issue is not a new one for the General Assembly – but this is a new General Assembly.	 	There are many actions we should take over our time together to save lives by reducing gun violence.”
“This year, let’s work together to repeal limitations on a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and please help me expand access to Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives	 	We should also work together this year to address the public health crisis of gun violence.”
“Quality and affordable women’s health care is a constitutional right and an economic imperative – it is also a personal decision.”
“As we work to expand health coverage, we should also make it easier for Virginia women to access reproductive health care, and oppose any effort to make it harder.”
“Expanding Medicaid is the best way for us to make life better for Virginians and truly open a new era of policymaking in the Commonwealth of Virginia.	 	Let’s get it done this year.”
“Bipartisanship has been the watchword of the first few days of this session, and for that I am thankful.	 	We all recognize the extraordinary changes that voters made to this Assembly in November.	 	They expect us to deliver on the mandate they sent.”
“These men and women are not living the lives they deserve.	 	They are not making their fullest contribution to their communities or our economy.	 	But they can be.”
“Every single Virginian you meet is someone’s son or daughter, and many tell tales of the daily agony they experience dealing with preventable health challenges.”
“Every year, I visit the Remote Area Medical Clinic in Wise County to help thousands of people get check-ups and treatment that they usually cannot access because they don’t have health insurance.”
“Medicaid expansion is an opportunity to bring our tax dollars home and transform the lives of nearly 400,000 people who lack coverage today...		...As a physician, I believe that expanding Medicaid is a matter of basic economic justice.”
“I am committed to working with the men and women of the General Assembly to expand Medicaid this year.”
“We are in the midst of a revolution with respect to how we research, prevent and treat a range of conditions that have historically cost too many people their productivity or even their lives.	 	I want VA to lead that revolution and to reap the economic benefits it will bring.”
“Education is a key predictor of a person’s prospects for lifetime success.	 	And so is health care.”
“Finally, as we build an education system that prepares every child to succeed, we should make sure schools have the resources to educate students with special needs or learning disabilities.”
“The introduced budget includes more than $500 million in new funding for school divisions across VA...which will help these schools empower at-risk students to keep pace with their peers across VA, so that every child can enter the workforce ready to succeed on day one.”
“As we work to attract the best educators and staff on the planet, we should also recognize that a child’s prospects for lifetime success are far too often determined by the school they attend.”
“Quality teachers are critical to educational success. So are school support staff...		These men and women play an essential role in the education of our young people and we should make sure every school can hire the best.”
“We should also work together now and in the years to come to make Virginia a leader in teacher pay -- so that the best and brightest come to our schools and stay for their entire careers.”
“Virginia is home to some of the best schools on Earth – and we should strive every day to make them better.	 	But we are also home to schools that struggle.	 	One of the most urgent reasons that some schools are falling behind is a nationwide shortage of qualified educators.”
“Building a better Virginia for every family starts with offering every single child a world-class education, no matter who they are or where they live.”
“If we work together, we can build on our advantages in workforce development and make sure every Virginian can get the training she needs to build a successful career right at home.”
“I hope you will accept the proposal in the introduced budget to increase funding for the New Virginia Economy Workforce Credential Grant Program...		Since its inception, this program has helped Virginians attain 4,595 industry credentials. More than 90% have gotten a job.”
“The centerpiece of that agenda is a plan to pay tuition and fees for any Virginian who pursues a credential in a high-demand field, if they commit to at least one year of public service.”
“We are also beginning the work to implement a proposal I made during the campaign called G3, which is short for Get Skilled, Get a Job, and Give Back.”
“If we are going to make Virginia work better for everyone, strengthening our workforce development system and expanding access to registered apprenticeships are key.”
“I am committed to working with you to create more opportunities for Virginia workers to get a good job that empowers them to provide for their families and lead productive lives.”
“Tonight, I will lay out an agenda designed to reinforce the things that are working, and to fix the things that aren’t.	 	If we take these steps, we will answer the charge our voters gave us to make VA work better for everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from.”
“For many people, this is the best place on earth to live and work.	 	But while so many Virginians share in the opportunity and prosperity of a thriving state, those benefits have eluded too many of our neighbors for too long.”
“Those of you who know me, know the Eastern Shore shaped who I am.		It’s a quiet place. A place of humility.		It’s a place where they teach the old lessons, the ones about loving our neighbor as ourselves.		And it’s a place that reminds us of Virginia’s contradictions.”
“In an era of social media and cable news, in a building filled with advocates, partisans and pundits, staying on the right path can be difficult.”
“That is a simple statement.	 	But far too often, public servants with the best of intentions find themselves pushed and pulled by forces that do not align with that goal.”
“I believe Virginians select their leaders for one reason: to make this Commonwealth work better for them and their families, no matter who they are or where they live.”
“Finally, I would like to share my best wishes for Speaker Bill Howell and his family. He served this Commonwealth with distinction for nearly 30 years and I know we are all praying for his speedy recovery.”
“I would like to thank Terry and Dorothy McAuliffe for their tremendous service to this great Commonwealth.	 	It was an honor to serve with them over the past four years and Virginia is better off for their leadership.”
“We could not be here tonight were it not for the bravery and sacrifice of men and women who wear uniforms of every sort to keep our communities, our Commonwealth and our country safe.”
“This management team can be an example to our friends in the corporate world.		When people say, ‘we can’t find enough women, or enough diverse candidates for leadership roles,’ I say—you’re not looking hard enough.”
“This cabinet is led by women. And like this new General Assembly, it is also one of the most diverse in our history.”
“One of the most important duties of the men and women of my cabinet is to oversee the work of 110,000 of the most talented and dedicated public servants anywhere in the world.	 	Please join me in thanking our state employees for the outstanding work they do for all of us.”
“Next, I am pleased to be joined by a diverse group of talented and dedicated men and women who will serve as my cabinet and closest advisors in the years to come.	 	Thank you for your commitment to serving this Commonwealth.”
“I want to recognize Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring.	 	It was an honor to campaign with you both and I look forward to the great things we will get done together over the next four years.”
“First, please join me in welcoming the love of my life and the First Lady of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Pam Northam and our daughter Aubrey...		Pam, I cannot wait to see what you accomplish for the people of Virginia as First Lady.”
“And to my fellow Virginians, thank you for the extraordinary honor of serving as the 73rd Governor of this great Commonwealth.”
“Speaker Cox, Senator Newman, Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, Justices of the Supreme Court, ladies and gentlemen of the General Assembly, thank you for inviting me to speak with you this evening.”

The inauguration of Governor Ralph Northam continues with the inaugural parade featuring 26 groups from across the Commonwealth https://t.co/WgN5gFYh4r
“Let us lead with humility and optimism, telling the truth, learning from history and removing every obstacle to progress for all Virginians.		Let us rely on the compass we all carry to show us the way ahead.”
“If we work together today, tomorrow will be better for all of the Virginians who have placed their trust in us to fight for them every day.		This country is once again looking to Virginia to lead the way.”
“I am committed as your Governor to fight every day for the hope that tomorrow will be better – for all of us, not just some of us.		Because it can be.”
“The guiding principle of this administration will be simple: we will work together to make our Commonwealth work better for all Virginians, no matter who they are or where they’re from.”
“The path to progress is marked by honest give and take among people who truly want to make life better for those around them.”
“Doctors are taught that we have a responsibility to do everything we can to make them better.”
“As Governor, I will approach these challenges with the same skills I learned as a doctor.		Over the years I have taken care of thousands of children. Never once have they or their families asked me if I am a Democrat or a Republican, nor have I asked them.”
“The solutions to these problems are not easy. But we do know what they are.		The way ahead starts with access to quality health care and public education for every Virginian, no matter whom they are or where they live.”
“In far too many places in Virginia, your zip code determines not just how well you will do, but how long you will live.”
“We have to acknowledge that the incredible economic progress we have made in Virginia has been uneven.”
“I am ready to work with you to make Virginia safer by passing smart reforms that keep guns away from people who shouldn’t have them.”
“If we are going to build a healthier Virginia for everyone, we must address the public health crisis of gun violence.”
“We should also resolve together today to refrain from any effort to curtail a woman’s constitutional right to make her own decisions about her health.”
“We’re going in the wrong direction on healthcare in Virginia and America.		More people need coverage, not less.		It is past time for us to step forward together and expand Medicaid to nearly 400,000 Virginians who need access to care.”
“We are bigger than this. We all have a moral compass deep in our hearts.	And it’s time to summon it again,	because we have a lot of work to do.”
“Those words have stuck with me all these years because they’re so clear.		They have become a kind of moral compass for me.		They always call me back home safely.	 	Virginia and this country need that more than ever these days.”
“My dad’s advice stayed with me when I reached the Virginia Military Institute and was given a different kind of compass, in the simple words of the VMI honor code:		‘A Cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.’”
“If things get dark or foggy, if you can’t find your way—keep your eye on the compass.		It’ll always bring you home safely.		He was right about that compass.”
“I remember standing with my father as I prepared to embark, and like all good Dads, he knew I was nervous even before I did.		He said, Ralph, remember—when you get out there, you can always trust your compass.”
“When I was just old enough to take to the water myself, my dad helped me build a rowboat and launch it, with strict instructions: stay close to home.”
“Watching the things my parents did, for our family and for our community, taught me a lot growing up.		But the greatest lesson I learned came from watching how they did those things. Their humble and steady service to the people around them taught me what strength looks like.”
“The McAuliffe administration has been about putting the needs of the people you serve first.		Those values defined my upbringing from the earliest days I can remember.”
“Our history is complex in Virginia.		It includes good things, and bad.		But no other place on earth can claim it.		This unique heritage endows us with a responsibility to shape the future—to leave this place better than we found it.		That’s the Virginia way.”
“If you ask the men and women who serve why they stepped forward, the answer is often the same:		I volunteered.		Because it was my duty.		Virginians understand that.	 	Because our Commonwealth was founded on public service.		But the way ahead hasn’t always been smooth.”
“Today we carry out the peaceful transition of power. Americans invented this ritual. It dates to our earliest days as a country. It makes us American. And at this hour, more than 1.3 million Americans protect this right.”
At noon today this account will switch from Governor Terry McAuliffe to Ralph Northam when he is inaugurated as the 73rd Governor of Virginia. For updates on Terry McAuliffe please follow @TerryMcAuliffe

"Strong growth in payroll withholding and corporate income tax collections helped create a $136.6 million surplus"
"In light of our hard work together, it's fitting I announce today that financial &amp; economic results for FY 2017 all point to success"

These costs are real -- and they'll impact our most vulnerable Virginians. While ACA isn't perfect, the repeal plan would be disastrous. 4/4

My biggest budget concern is about a potential 2nd round of sequestration in October. The 1st time, Virginia lost $9.8 billion.

On budget: We're 95% there. Glad that K-12 is protected against cuts, more $ for mental health, &amp; better pay for law enforcement, teachers.

Gov on int'l trade: there are ramifications to putting walls up with respect to trade. Maj. of customers live outside U.S. #WetheStates
Gov: Building a $20B wall - while at the same time freezing federal hiring - is not an immigration policy. #WetheStates
We're here-in the spirit of friendship &amp; common purpose-to ensure policymakers hear our voices before deciding on impt issues #WeTheStates
ACA repeal could cost VA &gt;$300M over the next two years, not including the impacts for the nearly 400k Virginians losing care. #WetheStates
Despite rhetoric, I'm confident maj. of Govs agree repealing ACA w/o adequate replacement will have consequences in our states #WetheStates
Gov: We can work together to defend our critical infrastructure &amp; data against cyberattacks that cost the U.S. $300M each year. #WetheStates
Every Governor has roads, bridges, tunnels, &amp; airports that could be repaired or replaced--creating jobs &amp; economic opportunity #WetheStates
