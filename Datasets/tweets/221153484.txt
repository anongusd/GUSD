Robert Mickens, whose 15 year old daughter was killed by MS-13, said she's now missed 2 birthdays and graduation this year. ‚ÄúUs as parents should not have to bury their child...To murder another student, a fellow classmate you see every day, you are not an ordinary human.‚Äù

Haspel says the CIA is out of the interrogation business, and notes military and FBI have expertise in interrogation practices. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt conduct interrogations,‚Äù Haspel says.  ‚ÄúThere are other US government entities that are suited to holding detainees and that isn‚Äôt CIA.‚Äù
Haspel repeats that CIA believed the interrogation techniques were legal at the time and officers were carrying out orders during a sensitive time post 9/11
Sen. Susan Collins asked Haspel: What would you do if Trump asked you to water board again?	‚ÄúI do not believe the president would ask me to do that," Haspel said.
@marcorubio said Haspel represents the best of public service and the CIA and expressed frustration with a "smear" campaign against her. "If someone like you cannot be confirmed ... then who can."
Haspel says she "absolutely" supported destroying tapes if done so within the confines of the law b/c of risk to CIA officers on tapes if leaked. There were 92 tapes of one detainee interrogated by CIA, she said.
Sen. Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Haspel's three decades of undercover work: The CIA selectively declassified only small pieces of info to bolster Haspel's nomination, while keeping damaging information under wraps. "This is probably the most difficult hearing I have ever sat in."
Haspel to Warner: ‚ÄúMy moral compass is strong. I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral, even if it was technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it,‚Äù Haspel said.
Under questioning from Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) on whether she thinks torture is wrong, Haspel said she supports the ‚Äústricter moral standard‚Äù for interrogation techniques and she would never put CIA officers in a position to violate the law.
Hapsel said she prepared a cable for her boss Jose A. Rodriguez, Jr., former director of the National Clandestine Service, about destroying the tapes at his direction. ‚ÄúHe and he alone made the decision to destroy the tapes,‚Äù Haspel said. ‚ÄúI did not appear on the tapes."
Haspel on 9/11 "I reported for duty the morning of 9/11. I knew in my gut when I saw the video of the first plane hitting the Tower in Manhattan that it was Bin Ladin. I got up from my desk..walked over to the Counterterrorism Ctr &amp; volunteered to help. I didn‚Äôt leave for 3 yrs"
Haspel intro: Speaking publicly "is a new experience for me as I spent over 30 years under cover and in the shadows. I don‚Äôt have any social media accounts, but otherwise I think you will find me to be a typical middle class	American, one with a strong sense of right and wrong.."
Sen. @MarkWarner on Haspel: ‚ÄúMany people ‚Äì and I include myself in that number ‚Äì have questions about the message the Senate would be sending by confirming someone for this position who served as a supervisor in the Counter Terrorism Center" during time of waterboarding.
At Gina Haspel, chairman Richard Burr says those who have problems with CIA interrogation techniques post 9/11 should address to concerns to former presidents, not to Haspel.

"To suggest more government is the answer is not a good starting point," --Rep. Mark Meadows, leader of the @freedomcaucus on gun control measures.
Rep. Mark Meadows compared Tele-promter and what @realDonaldTrump actually said to #cpac crowd. "That was not scripted. 90 percent of that was just from his heart."
He mentions briefly in passing at end of speech and ends with crowd pleasing line: "I will never let you down."
This #cpac Trump speech was billed by White House as major announcement about North Korean sanctions ... @realDonaldTrump seems to have other plans.
