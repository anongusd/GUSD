NMMA and its members fear this short-sighted decision by the government will both upset the common alloy alumin"um sheet supply chain and hamstring the economic impact of industries like ours that depend on common alloy aluminum sheet as a primary material.
These boats, their engines and components, which generate $3 billion in retail sales for the U.S. economy, are made and sold by an estimated 22,000 Americans, whose jobs are now in jeopardy.
The ruling is expected to significantly drive up the costs of aluminum used to manufacture more than 111,000 boats such as pontoons and fishing boats, which make up 43 percent of new powerboat sales.
Statement from NMMA President Thom Dammrich: "Today‚Äôs determination by the ITC unfairly harms the U.S. recreational boating industry, which supports 650,000 American workers.

RT @ACCFmedia: Consumer choice and safety key concerns for @therealnmma at today's EPA RFS hearing. #rfsbroken
We stand willing to work with the agency to present a more effective misfueling strategy.
Clearly, more work needs to be done to educate the consumer but we have yet to see the EPA address this issue,
Even more troubling, 60 percent of Americans assume that any gas that is sold at a gas station must be safe for all engines.
2016 Harris Poll which found that only 31 percent of Americans understand that higher blends of ethanol can be harmful to small engines
Finally, we have concerns over the EPA‚Äôs misfueling mitigation plan. EPA efforts to date have failed to educate and protect the consumer
We call upon the EPA to protect our consumers by lowering the 2017 RVOs below the blendwall.
In fact, it endangers them by pushing past the blendwall. Roughly one billion gallons of E15 and E85 will be needed next year
And the EPA concurs, expressly prohibiting the use of these fuels in marine engines. Yet, the proposal does nothing to protect our consumers
DOE study of E15‚Äôs effects on marine engines proved high ethanol blends can lead to big issues for marine engines, including engine failure.
But our concern with the proposal goes beyond consumer choice, it is truly an issue of safety.
Despite EPA‚Äôs assumptions, many of our consumers seek out ethanol free options. According to @BoatUS , 90 percent of boaters prefer E0
The 2017 proposal threatens our products and our consumers.  Marine engines can only operate on, and thus demand access to, E10 and E0 fuel
@mlewan3 testifying on behalf of NMMA this morning, "Our industry consumes about 1.5 billion gallons of fuel each year"

@CaptRobSailor Check out our latest statistical abstract for a comprehensive look at data for the industry http://t.co/gRVBVKXHg7
@CaptRobSailor You said it! We agree. A strong economy leads to a strong housing market - and boating industry growth!
New home sales and new boat sales are linked! http://t.co/FaRE55Mnx3
What happens in DC directly affects our industry. We need a healthy economy, job growth and a strong housing market to continue our growth!
95% of powerboats sold in the US are built in the US. We are a uniquely American industry!
95% of all boats in use are less than 26 feet long and 78% of boaters have a household income of less than 100k http://t.co/PHPGWHmQdb
Outdoor recreation itself is growing. Fishing is up 11% and boating is up 26% in the last 5 years!
Boating is growing! 88 million Americans went boating in 2013
1 of each of those 5 dollars is spent on recreational boating and fishing
Consumers spend 646 BILLION each year on outdoor recreation. That's big business!
