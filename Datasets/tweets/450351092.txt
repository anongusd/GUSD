@JackieAlspaugh @hollydaze88 @TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow Your tax return for 2018 was about $1200. Less than it was last year. That‚Äôs your increase. 		Plus Ca.

@JackieAlspaugh @hollydaze88 @TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow The actual increase came during the year, just about everyone saw an increase when tax bill passed. 		Let‚Äôs assume you saw an increase of $50. Every 2 weeks In your check during 2018. That‚Äôs 100. A month X 12 = $1200.

@rhkmiller @ellievan65 @awelab1956 This President really exposed the mid western fake,phony Evangelicals. You cannot be a Trump supporter clansmen and be religious at the same time
@kino5336 @ellievan65 What came first the FAKE name or the kid? He really is very creative wouldn‚Äôt you say so? #JohnBarron

What kind of Democracy is this? https://t.co/IPSTj9nSXZ
@GiGicmka Question now is ...what will you do about it?
@PalmerReport @Sir_Bradford Trump‚Äôs reactions to the Russia investigation itself clearly shows a fearful man. His fears are revealed in his angry tweets, his pathetic off the wall defensive tweets. The #TrumpRussiaConnection is real.
This is ridiculous. What‚Äôs the point of voting? Fricking power hungry politicians don‚Äôt know when to let go and go home. https://t.co/lxhFZ9NHEw
@HeatherSetzler @thehill And so this is why he is pushing so hard for a 25Billion dollar wall. Campaign promises gone wild.

@stucam7771 @realDonaldTrump 	Just let Donald know yourself. He believes he is doing fabulous. Those around him are protecting him. He is not governing, he is consumed by an investigation where he claims his innocence while everyone around him goes down. Sad.

@dcopaken Your story resonates with many women and men too. People‚Äôs reactions reflect their personal experiences instead of objective perceptions. Let‚Äôs listen to people instead of jumping to judgment with a blindfold on.

This president is illiterate. He is incapable of forming complete sentences let alone completing a thought. Is it only me who thinks he makes no sense? 	#realDonaldTrump #cnn
@nytimes It's totally unacceptable for the FBI to delay action for this long and allow Nassar to continue practicing.	Everyone who ignored what was going on shares the blame. @nauseatingNassar

@MaddowBlog I know because I called all my friends and they said, "Donald" you are totally vindicated, so now I'm telling Rod and Andy to back down b/c Americans know the truth
@MaddowBlog @adallos This whole collusion thing is a Hoax and everyone says it is a a nothing McDonalds burger with a nothing fish sandwich to see here. "Trump" (that's Me) says it's a shame a very big, big shame that this is going on in America.

@AC360 The right to vote for the candidate of your choice without retribution is sacred, it is nobody's business. Social media has put this out in the open.
@FoxNews @larryelder This is exactly why CNN is my choice for news.
@FoxNews Wow we caught one before he settled in an American City near you and started a new life of rape and murder @lookatyourneighbors, @whomeworry?
@FoxNews @TomFitton Making it sound like this is a first, please just stop it.
@FoxNews But he was not fired was he?
@FoxNews @SebGorka If you think this is only about Trump and never anyone else than you are more of a fool than I thought.@paranoiainTrumpcamp
@realDonaldTrump Good. Now try investing some time in Melania.
@FoxNews Hey this was put to bed a long time ago. People moved on so should you @foxnews
@FoxNews @brookefoxnews It's not new but revised game..."Can you top this?" 	Hillary is Donald's scapegoat because he loves to attack women. Notice she is ignoring his obvious obsession. Hillary won the popular vote and Trump is losing his mind over that.
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Did you notice killers are already here maybe that wall will keep us contained.
@FoxNews @SashaFB To each his own. It's not about what you put on your body but what comes out of your heart and soul. Sanders/pearls, Cher/beads. Sanders looks uncomfortable in her body. Cher pours out her heart and soul. So many choices!
@FoxNews I think secure borders are necessary but let's face it a wall is just symbolic.
@ananavarro Have we found anyone who hasn't disappointed us at sometime in someway? No one is perfect , just look in the mirror. How can we judge anyone?

@ScottSBarry @FoxNews @POTUS Mirror mirror on the wall.. Whose the blondest of them all?
@FoxNews You are number one in reporting 'fake news' and some pretty wild 'conspiracy theory's' 	SH is looking for a position at WH b/c he loves Fake News he's the next Bannon. Sad.

@CoryBooker Dreamers are the biggest losers here with all politicians to blame. News Media focuses on Political blames game.
News media and Politicians are too busy playing the blame game because each side is concerned about their careers, the people that really lose are the Dreamers.@realdonaldtrump
@CNNTonight @donlemon Standing with arms clenched tightly close to your body displays just how insecure and afraid you are because your true colors are surfacing. You do not wear politics well. Resign before you embarrass your family anymore.
@WhiteHouse Make good on your campaign promise to 'drain the swamp', RESIGN before you are embarrassed by impeachment. This would be the best swamp cleaning ever.
@Reuters People's lives and lively hoods lie in limbo, it's disgusting how we as a government have such little regard for human beings who are waiting for a bunch of baboons to vote on their future. Disgusting!
@CoryBooker Can't teach that old dog new tricks.
@POTUS 2018. 2020. You didn't deliver. You are done.	You made the swamp stink.
@senorrinhatch Blame the other party. That's not very adult-like.	Just do your job.
@RepMarkMeadows Just do YOUR job. Stop blaming. You're a grown man.
@WhiteHouse You mean for 'his base on the right'...they love that he acts like one of them. We see who you really are now. The Biggest chameleon.
@SenateMajLdr The Blame Game doesn't work for adults. Makes all you Representatives look like playground bullies. Just do your job...it's for the people...remember us?
@NancyPelosi Do the right thing!
The Great President Of the United States, Donald J Trump sat by and watched the Government shut down while his fund raiser looks forward to his re-election. Stay focused on today.
@realDonaldTrump Then fix it DT. All talk, big harasser, great Divider of people. You were elected to lead ALL the people, didn't anyone explain that to you?
@realDonaldTrump Neither party is in favor of ILLEGAL immigration.	Oh Great Negotiator work your skills without the immaturity you normally display and Make this a Great Country.
@FoxNews @RepHensarling The Blame Game Show. Starring immature Politicians. Live Now on a station near you.	Grow up
@FoxNews @JesseBWatters @WattersWorld Or 'The Trump Tragedy'... More like it
@FoxNews @dbongino @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Every politician who utters the words, 'it's their fault', should be fired. Just do your jobs.
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr I expect you to act like adults.	Everyone of you should lose your job.	You all look like a bunch of blabbering idiots.
@CNN Clearly those nice folks out in Iowa have had the potatoes pulled over their eyes.
@VP @POTUS Get your Boss, the Greatest Negotiator that probably ever live, (people are saying that), to do what the people elected him to do. Lead. Negotiate. End this shut down now.
@SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And closing down the government! We've elected a bunch of whining immature fools acting like they've been called to the principal's office blaming the other. WTH disgusted with all of them.
@FoxNews @POTUS Agreed, the economy is booming. Who do we thank?
@Jilly379 @FoxNews @KellyannePolls @foxandfriends Shut Down. You called it. You might just get it DT, and it is a reflection on you. What happened to 'only I can fix it' attitude? Oh, just blame the Dems for everything that's wrong.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @foxandfriends I think you are sorely mistaken, republican's are in charge and your boss says, " only I can fix it". Bite me.
@washingtonpost Must've felt foolish but then this is Donald Trump, who constantly refers to himself as Donald Trump,	Pushes his own 'fake news', at least the news media will correct mistakes, DT cannot admit a blatant falsehood. Sad.
@SKYRIDER4538 @FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Oh and did I mention he is a 'stable genius?' On the spectrum no doubt.
@sdv92 @Arl926 @FoxNews @POTUS Yes...you
@FoxNews @POTUS Like the Doctor from NY Hospital said on @cnn, he may be mentally fit, he's just plain and simple a jerk.
@realDonaldTrump Admit it. You overstepped when campaigning, you were playing the crowd and they reacted, now it's @realdonaldtrump. Drama personified.
@CNN Acceptable when Trump displays dramatics but not for Booker? This is a serious matter and he reacted as he should have, to bad some are shaking this off as a Trumpism.
@CNN Trump is in excellent health! Cognitive test was 30/30! So now how do we explain his erratic behavior? How do we explain the total lack of cohesive rhetoric?

@WhiteHouse Fix it ! Instead of pumping yourself up already.
@BillClinton People who are uniformed should not form off the cuff accusations.
@CNN Do it Donald. Show them you are in tip top mental health.
@CNN Documentary on how all immigrants to the US were considered trash. Italians, Polish, Irish, etc. all faced discrimination, show their struggles and then far far they've come.
@JohnKasich I understand the Republican Party is suffering from Dt's comments as he represents some percentage of people who have racist ideals and those Republican's who are silent right now are giving him credence. Those who stand up represent the rest of us
@smerconish @CNN @cnni Trump back when he wanted O as VP was a democrat. He has changed like the chameleon he is , he agrees with the last person he spoke to.
@CNN Someone needs to tell DT the Presidency is not about him , it's about the people of The United States.
My account payment is not showing? You can't assist me b/c your system is maintained by idiots.
@realDonaldTrump If MLK were alive today he would not be happy with the hatred you've spewed to a select group of deplorables. Remember Hillary won the popular vote fair and square! You just hate it...someone more popular than you...You Lost Popular Vote! Repeat that.
@realDonaldTrump We are capable of helping 'everyone" DT remember we Are number 1. Don't make excuses for your crude remarks and odd behaviors.
