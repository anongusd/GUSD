@SBdogo @cchukudebelu Not exactly correct.The European powers met between 1884-85 at Berlin (today known as the Berlin/Congo/West African Conference) and divided the entire continent amongst themselves.The Versailles	Conference on the other hand was to determine the fate of Germany after WWI.
@elnathan_john "The more things change, the more they stay the same" - Jean-Baptiste	Alphonse Karr.Very apt quote at this time.
@cchukudebelu Well imagine if Hitler had defeated the UK (and Russia and the US had remained neutral,thank Jupiter this wasn't the case),I think World War 2 would have been fought over the fate of Africa because of the sheer abundance of mineral resources on the continent.

@Omojuwa When the FG transfers majority shares (globally assumed to be at least 51%) in exchange for cash,it doesn't matter whether the shares were "sold" or "privatised" or what ever's the choice of words.Govt. has ceded ownership.Well by 2040 many current buyers will be  carbon neutral.
@Omojuwa Personalities (to quote you) were behind the decision to sell state owned assets in 2005 which like I mentioned earlier (AMCON also reached that conclusion) has been a mixed bag.I have just expressed my opinion that the idea to sell the NNPC is ill-advised.
@Omojuwa Comprehensive and if needed ruthless reforms of the NNPC's operations are the answer and not an outright sale. Given previous antecedents around privatisation when @atiku was left in charge I don't trust him to successfully initiate and complete a transparent process.
@Omojuwa income generated by Statoil,the state-owned oil firm which has extensive operations in Nigeria FYI.	The corporate culture of the country in which a nationally owned firm operates determines to a large degree how that firm does business as well.
