@AnnCoulter your whining is deafening!  Go cry in the corner, silently, and stomp your feet because you sound like a little kid not getting her way.
There's NO national emergency.  Period. It's made up by trump and his cronies. https://t.co/DqNU7kIUCB
@Emmablu1974 @TheRickWilson BTW...loved Chrissy Snow!  Used to watch as a kid.  lol
@Emmablu1974 @TheRickWilson for trump being so dumb, he's dangerous for our country. It's also the people around him that should have never been inside the WH.  Miller in particular.
@samstein sure!  He's over 300 lbs and he's probably 6'2 or 6'1. Everyone around trump lies...every last one of them.
@AnnCoulter Trump may care what you think but millions upon million don't give a crap what you think, write or say.  I will pray for your soul, but that won't help.
more hypocrisy https://t.co/luPBJ6x2wx
@TheRickWilson It's an abuse of power!
@TheRickWilson With a national emergency he could increase his powers.  That scares me!  As it should scare every person in our country.

@brokenheartswwl What a cool restaurant!  Is? that? a seal?  lol 	My hubby is a commercial fisherman in Alaska and so all his friends are in the business.  The other night we had a knock on our door and a friend brought over a few Dungeness crabs that he had just caught. Lucky!
@brokenheartswwl YUMMY!!  love love love seafood!  ;)
@brokenheartswwl cute!  lol ty
@chipcoffey Enjoying your photos!  Thank you for sharing! ;)
@BryanWinsAgain Done and followed.  Have a great day!
@brokenheartswwl When bones are involved it's a whole different type of pain.  So good to have a supportive hubby because that's required!  lol  Keep doing passive movement with it and that will help a lot. Rest and get well.  ;)
@VP @IlhanMN Oh really?  A disgrace you say. Well let me be clear, You're anti-LGBTQ beliefs are a DISGRACE. Trump is a racist anti-anyone of any color than white.  That's a disgrace so you both need to resign.
@BravoTV @TeddiMellencamp @doritkemsley1 Teddi should be happy Doritos isn't following her...I would be.
@Realitytea I live West coast time so I've not watched it yet. but very excited!
@brokenheartswwl Sounds quite painful but I hope you recover quickly.
@brokenheartswwl If you don't mind me asking, what's wrong with your shoulder?  I've had surgery on one and need the other done too, but I've put off surgery for the last 10 years.  Glad you don't need it as it's kinda hard to recover, but doable.
@tribelaw @h0n3y_73 This wouldn't shock me in the least. Anything trump says or does is the exact opposite of reality.  He was pro choice before deciding to run a republican.
sure trump's not making money while president nor his family.  smh in disgust https://t.co/rsxIEw5VXS
Everything that trump said last night was one lie after another! From his new hair color, which was dyed along with eyebrows, to how many were in attendance.  He said 10,000 but the venue only holds 6500.  If he lies about the tiniest little thing just think about the BIG ones. https://t.co/EiBXNbeGpF
@brokenheartswwl This blind faith following of his is exactly like a  cult and that's the only way to explain.  That is very scary for our country.
@brokenheartswwl I couldn't agree more.
@GreenInkRadio followed!  Have a great day!
@BillyTolley So hot!!!
@adishsoup @brokenheartswwl I said the same thing b4 I read your reply BUT you said much more eloquently than I did.  lol
@brokenheartswwl Kushner's father hired a prostitute, set up his brother-in-law to have a fling, filmed it then sent to the video to his own SISTER.  How sleezy is that?The BIL was working with feds against Kushner's father.  Very sordid!
@Sonya75211500 @EBraeden I don't know where you got that info bc that isn't what they are doing. I think you need to do a little more research bc the deregulating mining will affect the people of Alaska especially the indigenous people that don't live in big city &amp; the fishing industry.
@brokenheartswwl Do you like his hair and eyebrow dye job?  They say he wants to look younger and slimmer.  lmao  Nothing will help him!!
@funder @TheDemCoalition Much much bigger!

@mattgaetz you're a big fat liar and you know you are but spreading fear is fun for you. Having background checks and unless we're in combat, there isn't a need for anyone to possess assault weapons.  No one is even talking about taking everyone's guns.  those are the facts. period.
