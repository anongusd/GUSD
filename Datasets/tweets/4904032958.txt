@realDonaldTrump While I agree that babies shouldn‚Äôt be killed.  You continue to make up false reports to rouse up your base who believes in your lies.  BTW this is the same thing Satan the Devil does!
It‚Äôs God's job to judge and it is ours to love and hope, especially for those that we claim to have loved. There's nothing more harmful than a fake friend!

Sometimes you just have to let a situation go. Trying to prove a point can be harmful.
Sometimes you block your own blessings by telling everyone your business.

I never understood why people get mad when you ask for them to pay back the money you loaned to them. You didn't ask for a donation, you asked for a loan, a big difference!
