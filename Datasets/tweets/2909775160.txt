@marklevinshow https://t.co/Zb0cJD1hTc this handsome young man made more sense in this hour segment than I’ve heard from the younger crowd in a long long time.  I will absolutely help spread and support his sight! #WalkAway
@tedlieu @POTUS Muller and his team were given unlimited scope and spend millions of tax payer dollars and found nothing. All of the Democrats wanting to spend millions more need to be impeached from office. We need Imigration laws fixed, the murdering of babies fixed. What are you doing! Stupid
@JuddLegum Does there not actually have to be a crime before there is a investigation?  I just don’t understand this at all you would think that Muller all 16 of the Atty’s and others working for him with unlimited scope and the Millions of tax payer money would have came up with a crime

@SpeakerPelosi #show me the Facts Nancy!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy are you really typing this? Are you still spewing divisiveness in the country shame on you.  Nancy you are not the President I know you want to be just like Hilary but your not. A little respect for our President should be shown by you!
@iamemmakate @teparker804 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Do you not know that they did the last two years parts of the wall have been built some as of right now as we both type renovations on miles and barbed wire placed in placed.  This is a yearly budget, but I guess you already knew that! Right?
@RepJerryNadler What did Obama and Hilary and Rice know about Benghazi and when did they know it!
@iamemmakate @teparker804 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It’s not his (President) Trumps Wall it’s America’s Wall. The United States of America
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Y’all will just let the people down again when in 3 weeks you still don’t give the funding. You are lieing to your Democratic base you know you are not going to fund the Wall or work with the President. You both are happy today and many others but what are you really going to do?
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Why is it that Schumer has to accompany the speaker every single time she speaks?  Just wondering if her mouth though sideways most of the time even works without him by her side?

@WhiteHouse You know as well as I do my vote will never be counted. If they are Stealing my vote and forcing me to vote Provisional they are probably Stealing the Absentee Ballads as well. Please help Mr. President	Thank You for Listening!	Best Regards,Mary Ann Hendrick	WWG1WGA
@WhiteHouse go to the poll on Tuesday and would have to Provisional Vote. My Vote was stolen!  I see you working so hard to make Make America Great Again now I can’t even do my part! I’m so mad and sad about this whole thing.
@WhiteHouse that she had calls about the same letter the day before from other people. The clerk could see where I voted in June. He then said the bell wasn’t checked in the computer. He couldn’t tell me why.  He said there was nothing I could do about it but
@WhiteHouse I voted for you of course. The next morning I called the Randalph Co. Court House. To the person that answered the phone I explained about the letter. Before she transferred my call to the voter clerk she told me I wasn’t the only one
@WhiteHouse This letter stated that I was listed on the INACTIVE list as of Oct. 9th and went on to give me ways to take care of it.  All of which were too late by this point in time. I voted in the Special Election in June 2018 and in the Presidential Election in 2016 Republican
@WhiteHouse Dear Mr. President,	I am sending this letter to make you aware that my VOTE has been stolen from me. I live in Randalph Co. Alabama. I received a letter on November the 1st. from Southern Poverty Law Center. (Democrat related)
