CA Gov @GavinNewsom's first State of the State -- a 44-minute address -- was interrrupted numerous times by standing ovations. He ends on a signature line -- promising that in California, "the best is yet to come."
Bold new idea from @GavinNewsom:  Will study how CA consumers can get a "Data Dividend" to "share in the wealth that is created from their data,'' espec since tech firms "make billions collecting, curating and monetizing our personal data.."

Some grumbling in the room when Gov. @GavinNewsom namechecks communities that haven't stepped up on housing construction, like "Wheatland, Huntington Park and Montebello" -- but says "I'm not going to preside over neglect and denial any longer."
"If we want a California for all, we have to build housing for all,'' says @GavinNewsom, in another line that gets a standing ovation. Says "local govts that do what's right" and build their share will get a hand -- and "there's got to be accountability" for those that don't.
==@GavinNewsom's announcement on Alzheimer's gets standing ovation from audience -- it's an issue that goes right to the Baby Boomers. He notes senior population will double in state in next decades, and it's a medical issue that overwhelming affects women. #SOTS2019--
On Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, Newsom -- noting ‚Äúthe Golden State is getting grayer‚Äù - announced launch of Alzheimer‚Äôs Prevention &amp; Preparedness Task Force,‚Äô‚Äô headed by Maria Shriver, w ‚Äúmost renowned scientists and thinkers together to develop first-of-its-kind research in this area.‚Äù
"The answer to the White House: No more division, no more xenophobita and no more nativism. We suffered enough from that in the 90's with Props. 187 and 227,'' says @GavinNewsom to another standing ovation. #SOTS2019
Newsom says CA must fight ‚Äúfear mongering‚Äù from the White House, and ‚Äúmust stand up for those maligned, marginalized, and scapegoated,‚Äô‚Äô and for CA values. Cites #LGBT rights as an example. https://t.co/H483yPNEp6
Standing ovation and cheers at State of the State address when @GavinNewsom says "the border "emergency" is an manufactured crisis -- and CA will not be part of this political theater."

CA @GavinNewsom says he's disgusted by Trump Administration move to ban transgender troops, whom he says serve the country w honor: "Just to demean a group of folks for purely political purposes..it's disgraceful..they're yet again being scapegoated."
CA @GavinNewsom said he waited for law enforcement to collect data, and "they convinced me some good work was being done,'' which resulted in decision to keep 100 troops on the border. Said he hasn't talked to @realDonaldTrump, but has talked to @DHSgov director on his decision.
"We haven't seen any accountability on previous appropriations,'' and now @POTUS asking for an additonal $5.7 billion for the Wall, while jobs there have gone unfilled, says @GavinNewsom. "We've been sucked into this vortex of the absurd..and I want to get out of it."
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to acknowlege there‚Äôs legitimate concerns, but I‚Äôm not going to play into the hype &amp; the politics,'' says @GavinNewsom. "It's comedy..the whole thing is ridiculous." To Trump: "How 'bout you start by spending some of the money you appropriated last year?"
More from @GavinNewsom press conference: Troops at the border to used for cargo searches at port of entry, to deter transnational threats inc terrorism/drug trafficking, and elsewhere in state to target illegal cannabis grows by cartels which do "incredible environmental damage."
CA's @GavinNewsom says Trump's action "is actually hurting our readiness" and that National Guard troops are better used preparing for the next wildfire season w regard to supression,  fighting drug trafficking, guns and cartel action in CA.
CA @GavinNewsom of Trump's order: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to add 3,750 troops to the border, why do you need the National Guard? The whole thing is ludicrious..how many hundreds of millions of $$ are being wasted?" It's "pure politics..The theater of the absurd -- &amp; CA has had enough."
CA Gov @GavinNewsom on his move to change the deployment of National guard at the Border "to more appropriate venues and more appropriate purposes...the crisis on the border is a manufactured crisis -- and we are not interested in participating in this political theater."

"Married, female, college educated voters abandoned the GOP in extraordinary numbers'' in recent years, says ex-GOP political strategist @DanSchnur at @BerkeleyIGS. In 2020, "I would argue that a female candidate..starts w a built-in advantage, given that shift and motivation."
In CA, Dems are in "a challenging time,'' w danger of overstepping now that they have 3/4 majorities in both Houses."I wouldn't wish that on any Pro Tem or Speaker,'' says former @CAGOP Assembly leader @KristinOlsenCA
Problem for Democratic party is that there are "two Democratic parties -- one concerned about @KamalaHarris on criminal justice issues,'' the other concerned about her mention of "the elimination of private insurance,'' says @DanSchnur at @BerkeleyIGS.
CA wins when there are two viable parties, "and the jury is still out as to whether it's a new movement, or rebuilding the @CAGOP" from "a very different place" where it's been in the last two decades that will provide that, says @KristinOlsenCA at @BerkeleyIGS.
Former CA Assembly GOP leader @KristinOlsenCA tells @BerkeleyIGS "@CAGOP is dead today.. it's time to look at another path." Includes rallying around issues and common values, or to "rebuild the party from the ground up...if the party can outlast Donald Trump's presidency."
