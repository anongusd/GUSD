Party before Country...		When are the people in government going to  put country first &amp; party second?
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican Should add unless your life is put in danger by continuing to carry. Really not fair to demand she risk her own life...
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican I think a woman should be able to choose up until her 12 week. My reasoning for that is what I said earlier. The chances of miscarriage are much higher in the first 12 weeks &amp; drops drastically after that point. It's not completely formed yet, etc
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican Well that's the reason why I don't support it either. The difference is life or not, it's not viable up until a certain point &amp; could just as easily be miscarried. For the record, I'm completely against late-term abortion. If you've waited until it's viable,  just have it.
@jason_tyger @pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican Oh, thank you
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican I think abortion is 1 of the most volatile topics imaginable. The 2 opposing sides are most likely never going to agree. While Christian's believe live starts at one point non Christians believe differently &amp; forcing one's beliefs into another is wrong. So where does it leave us?
@jason_tyger @pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican Well, some, many, maybe even most are doing more telling &amp; demanding than educating. I can support you trying to educate, as I was doing similar with my first comment.
@jason_tyger @pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican No I'm not defensive at all. I was just giving another side of things. Therefore not only am I not beaten... I'm not a hee
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican Woman what's right for her. My religion &amp; beliefs are not necessarily someone else's &amp; I respect that. Abortion isn't as easy a choice as some people seem to think it is &amp; it's really not our business in the long run
@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican No, my baby was sucking her thumb in utero at 16 weeks. She most likely wouldn't have survived on her own but for me she was very much alive. Me, personally,  I dont think I could ever have an abortion. But that's my personal choice. But I dont have the right to tell another...

@pwc002 @Awkwardgirl102 @jason_tyger @Fuegoroa @MoonlitMystery @bIazingxmexican If the baby is born the day before it's due, it's still considered full term and can live on own... BUT if its born around 8 to 12 weeks it won't survive. A woman should have a right to decide up until THAT point. It's during the same time frame that miscarriages happen most...
