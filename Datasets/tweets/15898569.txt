@tonyschwartz Oh please. McCain's temper was treated as his badge of honor. Hillary was called a bitch and unlikeable
@wandaloskot @Thalia_Nyx @tonyschwartz She wasn't behaving. She asked someone to wash the implement she used. Was she being bitchy? Or was someone wanting her to look bitchy? Whoever you are, roles for women in the workplace are filled with ruts men don't have to navigate. Get real
@Thalia_Nyx @tonyschwartz Yes and no. Men can be worse because they are, well, men. There aren't consequences. Women definitely struggle with their "role" in the workplace, walking that line between being in charge and not coming off as either bitch, or emotional idiot.

@kvpeckwriter @maziehirono You have to ask? Men are their penises.
@kvpeckwriter @maziehirono There will be no one left to run both male and female.
@kvpeckwriter @maziehirono Vote women into positions  of power and we won't have male dominated Senate committees like the one that ramrodded Kavanaugh through.
@kvpeckwriter @maziehirono I don't dispute the stats. I don't dispute what women are up against. I'm saying vigilante justice isn't the answer. There has to be a proper, fair, legal process. We don't get to kill someone who killed our loved one for good reason.
