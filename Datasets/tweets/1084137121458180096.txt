@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Final note. I agree we need a more secure border, but a wall and using a government shutdown as an action to force the hand of people to build the wall... is where I have a problem. I do thank you for the discussion but... IRL is numer 1. https://t.co/cUm2YAiXVX
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Hope you have a good night/day
@tom_raker @CNN That too
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Nah... I have this thing call real life. I'm tired of arguing.. you're boring doing the same thing over and over again.
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Whatever... keep telling yourself that.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN I have no cause...
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Didnt say technology wouldn't work... I said a wall wouldn't work
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Dude...contracts come and go all the time. Just because we have a contract... doesn't mean we have some new capability. Have they deployed the equipment and reduced illegal immigration?
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN But I do accept facts and look at things from multiple perspectives. I just get snippy when people put personal attacks in arguments rather than diacussing what is at hand because they are inexperienced in argumentation. ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN I'm stubborn
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Who's us... do you have multiple personalities?
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN You said I dont know how engineers work
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN To make money
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Hahaha... my intelligence has been attacked since I was a kid... nothing new. ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN An attack would mean you hurt me... no damage here ^_^
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN You just demanded me to tell you... uhh... okay :/
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Nope... just talking because I have nothing better to do.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Not a super genius... ^_^ thank you though
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Uhh yeah... if you want to build something that will withstand environmental factors and still be functional. :/
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN And you'll need software to decode the data that the sensors pick up into a pretty little picture so someone can determine 8f a tunnel is there or not.	:/
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Engineers will take data from satellites and geology readings... also take into account all the EM disturbances. I know radar systems... ^_^. Also...they will have to raise the noise floor to ensure that backscatter or background noise doesnt generate false returns.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Your assumptions are wrong... you might need to go see a doc about that
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN You kind of need a geologist as well... engineers are fickle creatures. You havent asked me about my knowledge of the subject and assume I dont know... wow... just keep digging
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Troll
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN What's with the attacks on my intelligence... they wont work. I know what engineers are... stupid question... I guess you havent read my responses well enough.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Ots because you act like a twat demanding me to be your puppet... that's why... gtfo
@corps_us @SenDuckworth It will just make things worse. Building the wall is giving up... people won't give up on their values and what they believe. Pity for the 800k unemployed isnt getting congress in motion.... so this is what happens when people dont talk and just do things without thinking.
RT @funder: Can you do me a favor? Can you retweet this? It’s video I found of Trump saying he:		1. Plans to build Trump Tower Moscow	2. Is…
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Here's the thing... they have been using tunnels... in addition... (since we like to steer the conversation awkwardly)... North Korea built tons of tunnels to get under the DMZ... we dont know where they all are... how about here... can find them either?		 https://t.co/LChQYQfxQh
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN I'm good with statistics and calculus... so yeah... I understand percentages and finite mathematics... so again you assume wrong. ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN I'm actually a USAF combat veteran... and from the deep south. ^_^ tell me again how i'm a leftist.
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Talking about the ground sensing technology post you made... keep up
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Hahaha yet i'm not a leftist... labels are for unintelligent people that lack discussions skills to talk to another human. You rely on labels to put judgement before you have evidence.
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN You assume i'm unintelligent... it's quite the opposite. I chose what I say very well with CPTSD. I've been through hell... ...and I took notes ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Also... our geological makeup of rocks and earth at the southern border are different than those in Israel. So.... there is that.
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN If it did work... we would still have east and west Germany.
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN 80% doesnt mean crap. I dont have to prove anything to you. Like I said... a wall wont work.
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Wow... way to assume. Cool... ground sensing technology has limitations.... like any radar system.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN No
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN You do realize your observations could be deceived by your own mind... check your perception. ^_^
@WhoCare_75 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN My bad ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Whatever... are you gonna discuss or just keep pointing out your random observations?
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Also... it was also "removed" because it didnt work ... hence walls wont work
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN You mean after the USSR fell... yeah... I think that is why the wall failed... not our policies. Our policies put pressure on USSR to tear it down. ^_^	...	You really like to distract.
@TheTimmyCat @ladyoutlander72 @CNN https://t.co/0k6kP4yN95
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN What happened in 2008 that caused congress to flip out... oh yeah President Obama... yeah didnt we have issues of getting stuff done then too... something about a birth certificate. Maybe that's why they couldn't work on it?
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN The government takes bids for walls and selectable the lowest price.... yeah prototypes are cool until they are put to use and then fail because someone forgot to factor something in. I'm quite intelligent. ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Personal attack because you cant argue... cool... you're one of those.
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Cool numbers... numbers can lie. They factor of human behavior or free will is not taken into factor. Just because something is 80% effective... doesnt make it good. Look at texas hold'em and how that works out for some.
@ladyoutlander72 @TheTimmyCat @CNN Trump is an idiot. Okay... you can borrow under a wall. They made tunnels to go under the border that pop up on the other side of the border... you can always go under a wall or fence.
@cliffad89828911 @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Wow... your rush to judgment because you assume is why "you're" part of the problem. ;)
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN It was removed because it "failed" to keep west and east Germany separate. ^_^
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN It's a complex problem... one solution will not remedy the situation either. I can talk to my reps till i'm blue in the face... they are the ones that take action that affects people... not me. So direct your anger elsewhere. https://t.co/PWR4SfQzPF
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN What kind of wall do you propose that would keep people from crossing the border? Do you understand advanced construction methods and how to mitigate wall breaching ways? Where are you going to get the money to pay for it... that's another crap storm. :/
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN A wall is like any obstacle... it can be overcome. If not... then why is it used as an example as an obstacle in your way to overcome? If we can put people on the moon and fly stuff to mars...  I think we can use technology to figure this out... not a physical wall. :/
@ladyoutlander72 @CNN Humans have used walls throughout history to protect... they have failed in some way (example: Berlin Wall).	...	Also if I had a solution... we wouldn't be in this mess. So putting that on me for the argument is asinine @ladyoutlander72

@TheTimmyCat @jackivinson @ladyoutlander72 @CNN True...should've clarified.. [cough] we need to look at the weird decision to build some wall to fix the problem.

@ladyoutlander72 @CNN I was associating that a wall or fence will not keep anyone out. https://t.co/QtD93BqIil
@jackivinson @TheTimmyCat @ladyoutlander72 @CNN It's like this. The options you have to secure your door are vast (deadbolt, video camera, magnet locks, etc.) and a border wall, that will cost a lot of $$ to build, is our only option? That's why I hate the door lock argument. We need look at the border problem again. https://t.co/UDRhk5OvZw
@jackivinson @TheTimmyCat @ladyoutlander72 @CNN Locking your door to keep intruders out versus building a $5 billion dollar wall are two different things. We have better ways at dealing with border issues than building a wall. I hate that argument because it is odd... like those mobile1 commercials comparing stuff.
@TheTimmyCat @ladyoutlander72 @CNN I'm a little crazy... but who isn't ^_^
