What message does the Democratic party send or stand for? Unfair trade keeping US down, unemployment for all, more spending, drag down military, close down coal, bring in undocumented people to strain our resources, increase food stamps, stop rule of law, forget borders, etc

With the track record the Dems have, coupled with the fact that Trump is listed as the common denominator, maybe they orchestrated the whole bomb thing to make our President look bad, as the divider n chief???
Jeff Zucker, President of CNN should be ashamed of himself thinking that he is in charge of a news network. Key word, news. Its more like a live Enquirer. Opinions and haters who won't admit they are.
Why is there such surprise when the press secretary singled out CNN for being the dividers they are?
We need to get news to be news and not speculation or opinions. Report for example on all these bombs today and dont speculate it was done because of Trump.
How can anyone say Trump is the one encouraging the bombs. What about the get in your face, dont rest, kick them rhetoric from the Dems.
With the length Dems would go, like Russian Conspiracy, maybe they are the ones behind all these bombs planted everywhere.
