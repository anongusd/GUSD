then No Labels made rules saying "Problem Solver" candidates couldn't say "endorsed," but they could say "approved," "certified," or "recognized" -- all the synonyms of "endorsed," but definitely not "endorsed"

@sethdmichaels @MattGertz criminally early lunch as a pretext for additional lunch is a loophole I had not considered
@MattGertz @sethdmichaels I bring my lunch	 	1) thrifty	2) smart (strong brain)	3) no sun/people exposure	4) pairs eating (good) with minimum of physical movement (great)
@sethdmichaels look pal, I am strongly pro-lunch, but to engage in lunching so far ahead of the good, respectable noon hour is a mockery of the lunch values I cherish
most days around 11:15 or so it dawns on me that several workstations around me have been vacated and I briefly ponder where my coworkers have disappeared to before realizing with a disgusted shudder that these degenerate and self-indulgent monsters have gone to lunch
