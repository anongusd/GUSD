We saw a preview of how opponents of expanding vets access to care will try to inject their anti-choice agenda into the legislative process.
The bad news? This bill is unnecessarily costly b/c some vets groups &amp; elected officials decided to make this moment about political games.
The good news? Veterans who are able to successfully use the Choice Program won’t have to worry about lapses in their care.

@SecShulkin We'll remember who stood up for vets at this critical moment &amp; we will not hesitate to hold elected officials accountable for their actions.
@SecShulkin We'll continue working to establish a program that allows every vet who uses the VA to access care outside of VA at their own discretion.
@SecShulkin In upcoming months, it's critical that Congress pass reforms to the VA system which let veterans get the care they need, when they need it.
@SecShulkin By engaging in this behavior, those lawmakers &amp; organizations threatened the ability of millions of vets to retain access to critical care.
@SecShulkin Throughout this process some orgs were spreading misinformation about proposals to fix the funding shortfall &amp; weren't acting in good faith.
At the outset, @SecShulkin simply should have been granted the authority to shift existing VA funds into the Veteran Choice Program.
Some leases may very well be needed, but authorizing them now could lead to wasted resources that could otherwise be used to serve veterans.
However, coupling choice funding w: new leases for medical centers is a mistake w/o a more thorough review of the VA’s capital asset needs.
It’s encouraging the measure includes budget offsets &amp; changes in the hiring procedures for the VA, which are cumbersome &amp; bureaucratic.
If this new deal holds, vets who have been able to use the Choice Program won’t see lapses in care -- but this solution is far from perfect.
The Choice Program isn’t perfect, but for now, it’s better than leaving vets w/ no way to seek care outside of VA. https://t.co/SiquRthxFR
