@CaseyPHudson @TobyReeseTRP @Braves As i keep telling folks got to get more power at 3rd base camargo can not and will not provide enough power at 3rd base
@CaseyPHudson @Braves Great move for 1 yr Austin Riley is braves 3rd basemen of the future not camargo camargo slots better as a super utility player or as a shortstop not enough power to be a every day 3rd basemen
@JohnMahanrtr @AaronCatt2 @Artsentu @Braves Camargo is best suited as a super utility player nothing wrong with that that's just his strong point most likely
@bmcd1998 @Braves The ATL lineup was in desperate need of right handed power or just more power in general this is a very good calculated risk at 1 yr he is just there to keep the position warm for Austin Riley's arrival in Atlanta and helps the braves win now and not mortgage the future

And viscaino as closer he has truly great stuff but scares the hell out of me every time he pitches
I really like camargo he is a really good defensive 3rd basemen or shortstop and i am sure he could play anywhere but catcher in a pinch but thats his problem he is a super utility player not a every day 3rd basemen not enough power
Da#$%/ the braves need a real legit closer and a legit 3rd base men preferably a right handed power bat at 3rd base but a true front line closer we need in atlanta ASAP

#assadmustgo this is one of the very few times i do not fully agree with trump i agree with strikeing syria but i truly think we should at a bare minimum totally destroy assad's air force if not just go ahead and kill assad he should not be allowed to stay in power
I belive the usa has a obligation to remove the Assad regime from power if for no other reson than to help keep rusia in check as much as possible

Currently reading Israel: Hamas Wants Palestinians Killed in Gaza http://t.co/y6bt307fpg
Hamas and all other terrorist in gaza must be destroyed and Iran must be delt with to they supply Hamas with rockets and arms ect ect
Hamas is to blame for this war with Israel as they are every time they start it by shooting rockets at Israel Israel must retaliate
why does the world condem Israel for defending it's self it has every right to self defence as any nation does
Israel is not violateing international law hamas is by putting there rockets among civilians to dramatically raise civilian death ect
it is time for a Christian upriseing in the USA best way to do it is at the polls in November mid terms lets take America back vote GOP
I swear the USA has the biggest PILE OF SHIT  for a president in history it makes me want to puke every time I see him he must hate America
may god be with ISRAEL as it defends it's self from attacks by Hamas I hope Israel totally destroys Hamas ect ect
@netanyahu from a American that loves Israel and its people I pray GOD be with you and the IDF as Israel defends its self against hamas
Israel should totally destroy hamas and gaza kill as many palistinians as possible no questions asked it is time they should pay

GA voters do your state a favor please vote for Nathan Deal for governor keep your state moveing forward
@TwoSportman how long are the braves higher ups going to put up with this team no sence in them playing this way something has gotta be done
do you want to help fix America just vote GOP in 2014 an 2016 you will be so glad you did I promise you will thank your self
would americans really be dumb enough to vote for Hillary after putting up with Obama for 8yrs I pray they are smarter than that
@progtimwa no Hillary can not win being her self and she knows it she has not enough people will trust her to protect the usa
@dl34l thanks for the favorite on Condi rice I take it you like her
just say no to any democrat look where they got us right know
@progtimwa @dl34l your a idiot on this one total IDIOT
@progtimwa what good has a dem potus done in recent memory none totally freekin none
@progtimwa powell would be a good vp with jeb bush
this braves team is to damn talented to play like this just sickening
Obama this must be what 8yrs of jimmy carter would have been like
@progtimwa much better than Hillary and what we have now how about Collin powell almost for got him
@progtimwa there was at least 1 CONDI RICE SHE WAS GREAT
dems need to let Hillary go no more Clintons they goofed it up the first time
@progtimwa she was and did a terrible job look at Bengazie ect ect
also kill as many Islamic millitants as possible help Israel wipe out gaza and Hamas do the world and middle east a big favor
lets take out Syria iran clean up Iraq quick try to stop ww3 before it gets started good
@politico @politicoroger @HillaryClinton Hillary could not be secretary of state how in the hell could she be the potus
Obama and most dem's hate the usa look at what there doing to us just look at the ACA it terrible trying to turn us into Europe
AMERICA AND THE WORLD NEEDS THE GOP IN 2014 AND 2016 TO KEEP BOTH SAFE AND SECURE DO WHAT IS RIGHT VOTE GOP EVERY 1 WILL BE GLAD YOU DID
tweet to Jeb Bush to run for potus in 2016 he is what America really needs
just vote GOP in 2014 mid terms you will be so glad you did I promise you wont regret it
who in the state of ga really wants a carter running the state again look how the last 1 screwed it up look what he done as potus
@Dan_Gray_ @EmfingerSScout that and a idiot in the white house Obama care ect ect
Obama can't or will not get a us marine out of a Mexican jail Jason carter supports this guy that's not the guy Georgia needs as governor
we need to keep GA moving forward please vote NATHAN DEAL for Governor in GA you will be glad you did
Jason carter wants to use GA tax dollars to promote Obama care in GA do we need a Governor in GA like that I think not
the USA needs leaders like former British pm Tony Blair Israel pm Netanyahu and George W Bush Obama is killing this great nation
ww3 must be fought the USA mite as well get the upper hand and attack Iraq and iran and sirea first
the usa is going to have to go back to Iraq will have to attack iran to solve the problem they will attack Israel looks like ww3 to me

Jason Heyward is so talented he should hit 300 hit 30 plus HR drive in 100+RBI and score around 100 runs every yr he is just that talented
damn Atlanta Braves have got to find a clutch hitter or 2 that can get hotter longer than a gm or 2 I am about to get sick of there bullshit
@BikinInMaine 1 sure fire way to tell when Obama is lying as soon as he opens his mouth you know he is lying it is really simple
@TwoSportman the braves have to much dang talent to be playing this way this long changes of some kind must be made soon real freakin soon

@FilmCriticOne no payroll no property taxes ect people would have more to spend it would work at 15 to 20% or so ps I aint no damn sucker
@AmyMek @guntrust I agree 110%
@FilmCriticOne all I am saying is all taxes should be a sales tax no taxes on any thing else there would be no loopholes for the rich
sitting here listening to George Strait got to say he is the best singer god ever put on this earth
best way to fix our tax system a fair tax every thing based on a sales tax every 1 has to pay taxes they will be no loop holes
I swear javy lopez looks like he could still play
affordable care act must be done away with we can not afford to turn into France ECT
@Candi585 @BarackObama they would have died waiting to get done in Canada just not a good system in any case
