@jothobrotho @Super_K_man85 @LadyLecondoliak Obama dressed nice, was neat as a pin, but needed a TelePrompTer when speaking to school kids.  He doubled the debt &amp; more UStroops killed on his watch than Bush‚Äôs.  Iran deal took a billion in CASH &amp; release of 5 terrorists.  He was a terrible Pres (but good dad).
@LadyLecondoliak What are you smoking?  Eloquent isn‚Äôt what the US needs.  Jobs, a better economy, free trade, better schools, fewer illegals, are a few we DO need for a start.  Trump is often a 3rd grade bully but he is delivering on his promises.  That great for the USA.
@MikeNel42961792 You are kidding, right?  I live in blue state - 25% of our population are on welfare, poor public schools, high crime - run by corrupt Democrats and unions.  Did I mention our public employees union is grossly underfunded?  We do have great weather &amp; food.

@jcs2 @sallykohn @AnaMariaArchil2 Dr. Ford has my sympathy.  She was a sad witness.  She talked like a small girl in baby talk, couldn‚Äôt remember dates, places, etc.  I believe Democrats exploited her obvious issues.  None of her alleged witnesses confirm her story.  Political theater at its worst.

There is an irony - a blight on humankind was Hitler‚Äôs assassinations of Jews.  Today we have Jews (Feinstein &amp; Schumer, et. al.), assassinating Brett Kavanaugh - because he is conservative.  This is equally evil.
@Deplorable_JJ_ @brithume @awstar11 Payback for Garland?  Remember their Clarence Thomas witch hunt?  This is their standard operating procedure.  Republicans - they overwhelmingly voted for Ginsberg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  One side plays fair, the Democrats shoot to kill.
@JedediahBila @RonanFarrow Lowest standards?  Absolutely NO standards.
@Aikens_Josh This is the worst of human behavior as demonstrated by Avanetti.  The Bar Assocation allows pulling this crap out of thin air?  Lawyers have no standards of behavior if this is okay.
@WayneDupreeShow Call Democrats out for their dirty despicable behavior.  They do not have ONE honorable Senator who smells a rat. I feel dirty just thinking about the policy of personal destruction being waged by Democrats.  Vote Red!
Notice that not ONE Democrat Senator has called foul on this 35 year old, made up stench of a witch hunt.  Not ONE with a shred on honor or integrity. Democrats are evil (and sadly, I was one).
