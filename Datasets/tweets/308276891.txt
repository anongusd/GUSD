@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump As a woman how can you stand with a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, islamophobic bigot. Or did you forget about the billy bush tape. Trump stole the election from Hillary with the help of James Comey and Russia and Wikileaks. You need to have  common sense.
@realDonaldTrump You need to Resign you lying bastard. The only person that is lying is you because you are an idiot.
@SenMarkey Senator Markey you know what is dangerous is the fact that you are denying the existence of God. Science was created by God. Denying to defend Israel is also wrong. You are trying to play God. Also denying the existence of God is also dangerous.
@LeaderHoyer 90% of Americans support where do you keep getting your lies
@DNC You know what I find interesting is that y’all want to ban guns but yet y’all condone murder of unborn kids
@PaulPesachGray @MSignorile Enough with the homophobic rhetoric @PaulPesachGray
@realDonaldTrump Once again you are proving why you are a the racist bigot. She was born in the United States and has every legal right to return to this country.
@realDonaldTrump This is unconstitutional
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson No sir what you did is a presidential overreach
@realDonaldTrump you are a very disrespectful person I don’t see how the American people elected you because you do nothing but lie
@realDonaldTrump there isn’t a national emergency on the border are you really that big of an idiot. You are going to cause the the next President to declare a national emergency on guns.
@AOC how do you know that the world is going to end in 12 years are you God. I don’t think so. Stop trying to be God.
@realDonaldTrump just like all your other lies you only had 6500 and Beto had 15,000 and you had to lie about the fact that Beto had less than you to please your base. @loridwade
@realDonaldTrump you need to stop inciting violence and racism.

@Jim_Jordan Jim you just like the rest of the gop are racist bigots. If the Central American countries had an economic growth and wages that were on pace with the rest of the world. We would not have an immigration problem
@realDonaldTrump There should be a post order for being president.
@AnnCoulter Please stop trashing Bush 41
@POTUS please stop being selfish and greedy
@SpeakerPelosi Stop being childish and do your job and stop blocking the president just because you don’t like him
@AOC i support you but for you to say that the world is going to end in 12 years is not accurate. You don’t know that because the only person that does is God.
@realDonaldTrump hey Donald you have more important issues to worry about than tweeting and watching tv. If you want to watch tv resign and go back to New York
