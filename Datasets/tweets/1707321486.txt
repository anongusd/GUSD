@shawncook01 @Morning_Joe Throughout my book tour, I will be wearing a pin depicting Mercury — the Messenger — to deliver my warning about #Fascism.
@jrosenquist65 Don’t worry. I’ll be in Chicago later this spring, when it hopefully will no longer resemble Antarctica.
RT @Morning_Joe: Coming up this morning: @madeleine https://t.co/JKVJ0292DS
So the right response to intolerance is not more intolerance or self-righteousness; it is to bring together people across the political spectrum who want to make democracy more effective. That is what I argue for in #FascismAWarning.
Flawed though our institutions may be, we need to remember that they are the best that four thousand years of civilization have produced and cannot be cast aside without opening the door to something far worse. We can never take our democracy for granted.
That’s because fascist attitudes take hold when there are no social anchors and when the perception grows that everybody lies, steals and cares only about him- or herself. That is when the yearning is felt for a strong hand to protect against the evil “other.”
We are all familiar with the mantra: “see something, say something.” In #FascismAWarning, I propose an added exhortation – do something. And the first thing we must do is push back harder against the debilitating disease of cynicism.
And whereas in the past America always stood on the side of democratic institutions and values, the Trump administration has been fully engaged in kicking America’s allies, the independent press, federal prosecutors, immigrant families, and the notion that facts matter.
In Europe and elsewhere, extreme nationalist movements continue to scale the ramparts – shifting the terms of debate, moving into legislatures, and grabbing for themselves a thicker slice of power.
In Brazil, voters fed up with corruption, crime, and recession turned to an openly misogynistic right-wing candidate who promises quick solutions based, in part, on a full-scale retreat from environmental stewardship.
Since #FascismAWarning first appeared, heads of government with an autocratic bent have won reelection in Russia, Hungary, Egypt, Venezuela, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Cambodia.
When the book was first published last year, I hoped that the fears expressed in its pages would quickly prove exaggerated. Alas, that has not been the case.
Tomorrow, I kick off a 10 city paperback tour for #FascismAWarning. Follow me here for updates as I talk about threats to democracy around the world, including here in America. https://t.co/dG17OPTuJG
@BookshopSC Thanks for having me. I can’t wait to be in Santa Cruz. See you all soon!
I am excited to see so many new members of Congress arrive in Washington to begin the hard work of renewing our democracy, and I am thrilled they will led by @NancyPelosi. She is a true champion of American values and is the battle-tested leader we need.
As we look ahead to 2019, I reflect on those who we lost this year. As Sec Gen of the U.N., Kofi Annan led with diplomatic prowess and his legacy will continue to remind us that we can work together to find global solutions for global problems. https://t.co/AuparC60g3
This week’s events show once again that, were the president to take my course on national security decision-making, he would flunk. Iran, Russia, Assad &amp; ISIS are celebrating; Secretary Mattis is resigning; and our mission is not yet accomplished. Trump earns an F for failure.
Truth is fascism’s most potent enemy. Guardians of truth are democracy’s greatest friends. Proud to see @Time honor courageous journalists, including my friend and @NDI Democracy award winner @mariaressa. #TimePersonOfTheYear https://t.co/Br0JN5Bddz

70 years ago on Armistice Day my family and I arrived in America. We were greeted not by barbed wire but by the Statue of Liberty. We were given the chance to live in freedom and in return became grateful patriotic citizens. That is the America I know and want back. https://t.co/85PxLjD2Um

Mussolini compared accumulating power to plucking a chicken one feather at a time, go slowly and no one notices. Trump wants to change the Constitution by Executive order. That's a sledgehammer, not a feather - we should all take notice.
”Truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred.”		Czechoslovakia, the country of my birth, came into being 100 years ago today. These words were attributed to one of its greatest leaders, my friend Václav Havel.		#CZentennial
As we mourn and pray for the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting victims, we remember that when politicians spread diabolical conspiracy theories and stir up hatred of others, they are ripping the scab off a wound that killed six million people and has never fully healed.

I am proud to call John McCain a friend and partner in the fight for human rights and democratic values around the world. May God bless him and his family as they continue this journey.
50 years ago, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia to put an end to the Prague Spring. The Soviets succeeded in the short term, but in the long run they failed because the democratic spirit cannot truly be defeated. May this anniversary always remind us of that timeless lesson

The White House cannot let another day pass without unequivocally rejecting Russia’s absurd request to interrogate @McFaul and other officials. Merely entertaining this idea betrays our diplomats, undermines our interests, and hands Putin yet another propaganda victory.
Nelson Mandela taught us that the power of forgiveness is greater than that of hate, and differences of race &amp; nationality matter less than our shared humanity.

It is hard to imagine anything more damaging to our security than attacking #NATO while appeasing Russia. That’s why I joined 15 former foreign ministers in urging President Trump to stand with our allies this week and to show resolve with President Putin. https://t.co/cBg0CCJQD8
On #WorldRefugeeDay, @theIRC warns us that America is leaving behind the world’s most vulnerable people, including the 50 percent of refugees who are children. #StandWithRefugees https://t.co/Iplwr07lUY
To be clear, immigrants, legal or not, are people who want to improve their lives. To refer to them as animals or insects is to foster hate. What’s happening in Washington and on our border is sad, wrong, and unamerican.

PS – The pin I’m wearing today depicts Mercury, the Roman god of messages. More than any other book I’ve written, #Fascism has an urgent message for the reader about the need to defend democratic principles. I hope it is heeded. 	6/6
I know what the stakes are, and I’m determined to use my voice to warn against the dangers to freedom that we see. In the face of #Fascism or Fascist tendencies, silence isn’t a responsible option.	5/6
This book is personal. As a child, I fled the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. After the war, Communists drove my family into exile. Later, as UN Ambassador and Secretary of State, I confronted dictators. Since then, I’ve stayed involved in the fight for democracy. 4/6
To counter #Fascism, U.S. leadership is needed, but foreign autocrats today often justify their repression by pointing to the American president's own words. That is a disgrace. For democracy to survive, it must be defended. If lies are to stop, they must be exposed. 3/6
We should all be alarmed by the assault on democratic values that is dividing Americans at home and that has gathered strength in countries abroad (among them Russia, Hungary, Turkey, Venezuela, and the Philippines). 2/6
My new book, Fascism: A Warning, is available for pre-order now and will be released on April 10.	 	I wrote this call to action because history has taught us that, when #Fascism looms, we have a duty to stand up and speak out. https://t.co/LagiJLbZWK	1/6 https://t.co/7FgtK3ipIG

.@CARE I was so honored to speak at #CNC16. CARE truly embodies America’s values &amp; America’s spirit - your work is absolutely vital.
The so-called #TrumpDoctrine is simply bellicose rhetoric strung together with contradictory statements. Bluster is no strategy, Mr. Trump.
Trump’s proposals to ban Muslims and deport immigrants would undermine America’s greatest strengths: diversity and tolerance.
Trump's newest slogan is "America First," recalling the self-defeating isolationism of the 1930s.
Trump’s views on torture are completely out of sync with recommendations by military leaders and America’s values.
Trump praises Western values, then questions why we should support democracy in other countries.
Trump’s understanding of trade policy is simplistic at best, and would have disastrous effects on our economy.
Trump preaches unpredictability as a policy, then asks us to trust him with the nuclear codes.
Trump speaks about regaining the trust of our allies, but then threatens to pull out of NATO.
Trump demonstrates no real understanding of complex international issues and has no serious proposals for how to address them.
So I thought I'd respond using his favorite method of communication and tackle some of the #TrumpDoctrine's biggest flaws head on.
Today, @realDonaldTrump tried out a foreign policy speech - something I have experience with.
