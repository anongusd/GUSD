Security of American workers and security of American citizens holds priority. A well run legal immigration system can accomplish both of these goals, but there cannot be an immigration law w/o the distinction of illegal v legal. A ‚Äúgood‚Äù system would deter illegal immigration.
To uphold the integrity of the legal immigration system, American citizens must have confidence the government has a handle on illegal immigration. 		Republicans have been willing to address #DACA, but without enforcement corrections, we‚Äôll be in the same mess 5 years later.

@WaltEagles24 Think about who profits from the Hezbollah money laundering scheme--Russia, Iran, Syria, Venezuela. Syria and Venezuela are in shambles, Russia continues to take a more aggressive posture and Iran murders young American service men and women in Iraq.
"All of these paths eventually converged on Hezbollah."		Where is the media on this?!
"Meanwhile, in Iraq, the U.S. military was probing the role of Iran in outfitting Shiite militias with high-tech improvised explosive devices known as Explosively Formed Penetrators, or EFPs, that had already killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers....."
"He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons."
"Fayad, who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles, was ultimately sent to Beirut...."
"...But for the nearly two years Fayad was in custody, top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it."		UNBELIEVABLE
"Lebanese arms dealer Ali Fayad, a suspected top Hezbollah operative whom agents believed reported to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a key supplier of weapons to Syria and Iraq, was arrested in Prague in the spring of 2014....."

1950: Chosin Reservoir 		1st Marine Division was outnumbered 8-to-1 by Chinese army. Weather cut off air support. Snow and wind battered the @USMC w/ temps at -40F. 		Yet, the ‚ÄúChosin Few‚Äù destroyed 10 Chinese infantry divisions and fought their way back to join US forces.

FACTS According to JCT: Those making btwn $20K &amp; $30K see a 13.6% fed tax cut. Those making $50K to $75K, a 7.9% cut. Those making $100K to $200K, a 6.1% cut. Those making $500K to $1M, a 4.3% cut. Those making over a million see a 6.7% cut in taxes. #TaxReform raises ALL BOATS

ISIS war is difficult war to fight. At war w/radical Islamic ideology. They use radicalized people, Americans or those seeking entry.
"If you see something, say something."  As example, San Bernardino attack could've been stopped, but neighbors feared PC backlash.
Now not time to throw doors open w/ISIS trying to get in. Major flaws on border, visas, refugee program. Can't screen who we're letting in.
Strongly oppose continuing refugee program right now - esp. Syrian refugees to PA per Gov. Wolf. Must fix screenings before proceeding.
HBurg ISIS arrest proves they prey on those who are radicalized, whether they are already here or aspiring to come here.
