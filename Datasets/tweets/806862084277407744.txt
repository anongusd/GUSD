@arneduncan @jmpalmieri Thank you, @arneduncan, for all you do to help Chicago’s youth.
@mgc617 @CNNSotu @RickSantorum Exactly!
Looking at your comments, many point to past reaction by NRA when smart technology has been explored.  Gun industry helps fund NRA. We should not let either off the hook.
On @CNNSotu @RickSantorum criticized Marches &amp; said, “How about kids instead of looking to someone else to solve their problems do something about maybe take CPR classes or trying to deal with situations where there is a violent shooter...”. 	Shameful!
If you can unlock a smart phone with a finger print, why don’t gun manufacturers make smart guns?   Another way to keep guns out of the wrong hands. The Obama Administration challenged them to develop the technology.  Why have they not done so?
“There is no reason for the gun industry to have special protections that are unavailable to other businesses that sell products that pose far less risk of harm.”	Congress should repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act now. https://t.co/eNMegqSCDq
