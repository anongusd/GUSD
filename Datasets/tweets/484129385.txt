And no, I have no plans to purchase or read Obamabomb.

Were Iranian proxies behind the attacks, as the admin alleges? Or, did Bolton get an itchy trigger finger and seize on a chaotic situation to push for war? Mattis isn‚Äôt there any more to squash bad ideas - which means Congress should get to the bottom of this, and soon.
As Bolton pushed for war options, the U.S. laid the blame for the attacks on Iran with some odd phrasing - stating ‚ÄúIran did not act to stop these attacks by its proxies in Iraq, which it has supported with funding, training, and weapons.‚Äù
The Basra attack follows days of raucous protests that led to the torching of the Iranian consulate in Basra. https://t.co/nWt4Ep4B8J

But that hasn't stopped Trump's team from trotting out dire warnings, exaggerations and falsehoods nearly every week to ratchet up tensions. As repetitive and nonsensical as many of the claims are, we unfortunately know what this kind of drumbeat can lead to.
Thanks in part to the deal Trump withdrew from, we know Iran isn't on the cusp of a nuclear weapon or any system that could lend credence to the Trump administration's drumbeat of warnings about the supposed Iranian menace.
This is straight out of the Iraq War playbook - then, the George W. Bush admin was warning the smoking gun of Iraq's WMD program could be a "mushroom cloud."
The Trump admin is trying to create the impression that war with Iran is inevitable if the U.S. fails to take preventive action. Here are 3 quotes in the last 5 days warning about the growing risk of a "regional conflict," from Pompeo &amp; Hook: https://t.co/nT0pGkW0Vk https://t.co/lOBXhNOi3P

I don't think anybody has figured out what happened in Iraq that provoked the strong warning from the admin. Which groups were involved? How tightly were they linked to Iran? Why were the rockets launched? We just have the administration's word &amp; sketchy formula - Shia=Iran
This nuance is lost by the administration's new position - any aggressive actions by Shia militias will be attributed to Iran regardless of whether Iran had a hand or not, increasing the risks of a conflict with a nation of 80 million that could have been otherwise avoided.
There are, of course, many distinctions between Shia militias in the Middle East and Iran's level of influence and control. For example, the Houthis may listen to Iran but might not do what Iran advises - see Sanaa in 2014: https://t.co/TQK65DpdF2
Brian Hook: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make a distinction between the Iranian government and these Iranian Shia militias that are around the Middle East and the President spoke on that very clearly recently after the attacks on our properties in Baghdad and Basra.‚Äù
The JCPOA provided routine diplomatic opportunities to press Iran directly on issues of concern, including Americans unjustly imprisoned in Iran. Now we are presumably limited to twitter rants: https://t.co/Ivz1kDBQTk

Despite Pompeo recently urging us to let the JCPOA go, Brian Hook is spending a lot of time re-litigating it, poorly. JCPOA was not between two parties.
The talking point of ‚Äúwhat if the Houthi missiles were aimed at Dulles‚Äù is profoundly stupid. As Trump would say, we are surrounded by ‚Äúbig water‚Äù which the missiles would fall into.
Brian Hook, speaking at Hudson, notes JCPOA didn‚Äôt diminish pace of Iranian missile testing. Nor did it increase. But the big win from JCPOA is ensuring Iran can‚Äôt get fissile material and put a nuclear warhead into its missiles. That‚Äôs what Trump is jeopardizing.
FDD, meanwhile, is dedicated to channeling Trump's instinct to negotiate in the wrong direction. Chances of a Khamenei-Trump meeting have always been nil, Pompeo-Rouhani is just odd. Though I imagine any feasible channel (Pompeo-Zarif) has been sabotaged. https://t.co/qKWohZP4aC

Brian Hook saying "that's why we enjoy the kind of solidarity that we do with the Iranian people and the diaspora" while banning and sanctioning the Iranian people takes some cojones.
Contra Hook, JCPOA was premised on verifying Iran's implementation of its nuclear obligations. That has been successful, while losing nothing on the nonnuclear front.
This invective against Iran from Brian Hook would be more effective if he also condemned allies for repression and corruption, including Saudi Arabia where a women's rights activist is facing execution and where elites were tortured in a Ritz Carlton.
Haley @ FDD: "Iran was going to be able to start nuclear testing after 10 years. Well we're already 4 years into it."		Another example of Iran hawks distorting the facts. If she was referring to weapons testing, which is the clearest reading of her language, she lied.

We both agree that we don‚Äôt want to see Iran burn down to the ground. However, I and many others believe the Iranian people are best positioned to bring about sustainable change, and that Trump, Bolton &amp; Pompeo are more likely to be arsonists than saviors.
Most of the ‚Äúthink tank/policy hive‚Äù or DC bubble is in fact devoted to a pressure campaign against Iran regardless of whether Iran changes its behavior or not. You joined that crowd ‚Äì you didn‚Äôt leave the majority in DC.
There are a few other substantive points I‚Äôd critique. For example, your argument that the regime is influential in DC? Give me a break ‚Äì regime officials aren‚Äôt allowed to step foot in DC without permission!
First, you sidestepped my main contention ‚Äì that you‚Äôre attacking ideas you used to agree with as a narrative of ‚Äúregime advocates.‚Äù Given that you used to hold the same views and in no way were or are an advocate for the regime, I find your attacks extremely disingenuous.
I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate a bit on your change of heart, @AlirezaNader (https://t.co/BfEPJQTdyd), which I assume was in response to my thread here (https://t.co/gO9zZ8EeC3). However, I still have a few concerns.
RT @JohnGhazvinian: @AlirezaNader, it would be informative to hear your response to this very thoughtful critique https://t.co/xQqL6QPyLN
I assume you‚Äôve had a change of heart for one reason or another, but it would likely be wise to have a bit of humility moving forward on a tough and humbling issue like how to approach Iran.
Now, you argue that reform is dead and Iranians need U.S. support now more than ever ‚Äì and are attacking individuals who associate more with your old views than your new.
Go back to March ‚Äô17 and you argued that U.S. pursuit of regime change is likely to face steep challenges that it may not be able to overcome. https://t.co/Be89i8IZkH https://t.co/dbjbyTsxxF

Already looking forward to the next Trump official giving a big overhyped speech on Iran. Is it John Bolton‚Äôs turn?
@lrozen He also wrote off all elements of regime as radical ideological revolutionaries - so we shouldn't hold our breath as all the problems inevitably get worse.
Pompeo's Iran speech was predictably hollow - there's no plan in place other than to hurt Iran and the people who live there and hope a new regime comes out of the chaos. All posturing, zero substance.
The plan and the policy is to ban all Iranians because the President is a racist and promised a Muslim ban. The waiver has been demonstrated as a fraud - very few are getting through.
@DanielLarison Right of passage for every Trump nat sec official to give an overhyped Iran speech.
Pompeo: we support the Iranian people so hard we won't allow them to get visas to escape our crushing sanctions and the oppression of the regime.
Sec. Pompeo is setting out a case for refusing to negotiate with any elements of Iran's political elite, thereby rendering his 12 demands of Iran impossible to achieve short of regime change.
Good to raise cases of Namazis, Wang and others unjustly imprisoned in Iran, but little indication they are engaging in serious dialogue to get them freed.
Calling out corruption of Iranian regime officials is worthwhile, but snapping back sanctions will hurt ordinary Iranians not the corrupt officials. IRGC expanded its economic reach amid crushing sanctions.

Trump reneged on a deal endorsed by the U.N. Security Council and plans to sanction NATO allies, risking Iranian proliferation and war with Iran in the process. Instead of being worried about that, GOP is still spinning on Obama and sanctions relief. Ridiculous.
The JCPOA itself obligates the parties to ensure Iran has access in areas of trade, finance and more. If there were impediments to relief, US and others were obligated to work in good faith to overcome them. Zero risk to allowing dollar conversion in US, except politically.
The constant securitization of sanctions relief in DC is a ridiculous impediment to any lessening of tensions. Iran did something we like by curtailing its nuclear program and deserved relief.
A more accurate frame: the Obama admin contemplated a step to make sanctions relief work better in line with US JCPOA commitments, then backed down due to domestic pressure. https://t.co/CHYpe2NgZ3

Kaine asks if regime change should be an acceptable policy goal. #Pompeo claims he didn't mean changing regime by force, but by democracy promotion. A likely story.
It is easier to rail against the Obama nuke deal than articulate a viable alternative, as #Pompeo demonstrated again today.
Given that Menendez is a hawk on Iran &amp; the JCPOA, Pompeo should be able to instill some confidence in him that there is a plan in place, but that isn't the case.

Pompeo/Corker clarify that if Trump follows through and withdraws, Pompeo will work to strike a better deal. Good luck with that.
Corker: my sense is that if Europeans do not come along with framework by May 12, he will withdraw. Pompeo: President has made that very clear...
How can #Pompeo not imagine a hypothetical that is approaching on his first month on the job?
Cardin: Trump wants to see changes to JCPOA. Europe has said directly we cannot modify the agmt, &amp; Iran is in compliance. If POTUS determines you cannot modify the JCPOA, what is your view on whether we should withdraw? #Pompeo: can't answer that ?, want to fix deal.
#Pompeo in prepared testimony says he will work to fix the Iran nuclear deal, but Trump's demands were designed to be rejected &amp; Pompeo would only have til May 12 to work a miracle. Will he recommend Trump extend waivers May 12 &amp; beyond?
Menendez: didn't support Iran nuclear deal, however don't support withdrawal absent plan for what can replace it. Will you be voice of reason, or empower Trump's worst instincts? #Pompeo
Key distinction drawn by Menendez - former work on covert ops and intel as CIA Director will (or should) be over, will instead be formulating policy. Hence, #Pompeo's policymaking history is more important.

If the U.S. wants to 'fix' the JCPOA, it could start by reassuring the international community that it is committed to implement the deal in full while clearly explaining to foreign businesses what is and is not permitted under existing sanctions.
Not only has Trump reversed that, he has actively discouraged foreign nations from transacting with Iran while constantly holding the fate of the JCPOA in doubt. The effect is win-win deals vital to the JCPOA, like the sale of civilian aircraft, don't get finalized.
Previously, the Obama admin went around to banks to explain what is and is not permissible under the JCPOA in line w/ commitment to ensure Iran's access in areas of finance, trade etc.

Add to that Trump's pugnacious demands, his refusal to negotiate with Iran and his lack of credibility on the international stage, and there's little reason to believe that he'll be successful in bullying others to comply.
On ballistic missiles, the JCPOA eliminates the primary threat by blocking Iran's ability to obtain fissile material. So killing the deal makes no sense. And, Iran views them as conventional capabilities and some of the P5 agrees with them.
On sunsets, threatening to kill the deal in its entirety in 4 months because some restrictions expire in 8-13 years makes little sense, it is negotiating from a position of weakness.
Trump's Iran deal demands are unneeded, unrealistic and unattainable.

Continuing or escalating support for the Saudi campaign won't reverse that trend - but it will worsen the unconscionable humanitarian crisis that the Trump admin and Saudis want to ignore.
If Haley's allegations are true, US support for the Saudi bombing campaign &amp; blockade has only resulted in increasing Iran-Houthi ties and Houthi threat to Saudi security.

Iran can't "sprint toward a rapid nuclear weapons breakout." JCPOA bars them in perpetuity and subjects them to intrusive inspections.

The original INARA bill included a certification on terror, which was stripped out as it was rightly seen as a poison pill
Many in GOP want little part of a straight vote on the JCPOA, but expanding certifications outside the deal is likely to kill it later

Mr. Albright, you think Congress has ability to unilaterally alter terms of an int'l agmt? Don't have to answer: the answer's of course not.
Cicilline: what could Congress do unilaterally to an int'l agreement to 'fix' the deal? DA: same way it created INARA, can fix deal
Sullivan: in last 2 years, US hasn't gone to IAEA to ask them to inspect specific military site. Haley generally had convo on how to do it
Zeldin, who thinks Obama is the real racist, claims IAEA is barred from military sites (they haven't had a reason to request access)
Keating: what happened in 1996 w/ ISA? Sullivan: Europeans passed protective measures...ISA was never effectively enforced against Europe
Sullivan: as some have suggested, if POTUS unilaterally rewrites the terms of JCPOA, that's a sure way to collapse the deal over time.
Gen. Wald had to leave the HFAC hearing...addition by subtraction.
Ted Poe is harping on Iran wanting to destroy the US. Not their position, don't have capability.

Sullivan argues Haley visit to Vienna &amp; reports that Trump is going to use military inspections as reason to pull out of deal is damaging
Rep. Meeks: Gen. Wald, your speculation without facts is very dangerous. Good to see pushback on that crazy 99% certainty line.
Gen. Wald 99% certain Iran is cheating on the deal at military sites w/ 0 evidence. IAEA, military brass, allies all see Iran compliance
Rep. Smith rattling off statements by Iran's leaders against allowing military inspections...but Iran then allowed inspection of Parchin
IRL: has Iran granted access to military sites? DA: not since Implementation Day. BUT, IAEA hasn't asked b/c they don't suspect violations
Jake Sullivan makes this point, which should appeal to GOP &amp; deal opponents, here: https://t.co/p6mZAOWzOL

If that's the case, buckle up, because it will make Afghanistan and Iraq look like a cakewalk by comparison.
It seems they are still intent on kicking the nuclear hornet's nest in DPRK &amp; sparking new nuclear crisis with Iran, perhaps at same time.
Yet, Trump has threatened complete destruction of DPRK &amp; now urged Iranian people to overthrow government at 1st UNGA speech.
Am reminded of quote from contact close to admin - they wanted to fix Iran and North Korea in year 1. Completely delusional.
It's often hard to make sense of Trump's intentions on foreign policy, with this speech I think it's safe to assume the worst #UNGA
Trump's #UNGA speech: Respect sovereignty. Put your nation first. Except for North Korea and Iran, destroy those evil guys.
Iran's people: what Iran's government fears the most, and also what Trump admin fears to let into the United States #UNGA
If Trump wanted to reach out to the Iranian people, he can start with ending Muslim ban and supporting JCPOA they favor #UNGA
If Trump wanted to alert everybody to how he is unhinged and a danger to world peace, he's certainly made a good start w/ speech thus far.
I see we are back to axis of evil rhetoric with Iran and North Korea. Didn't work out too well for the last administration that used it.

5 Lies Nikki Haley Just Told About The Iran Deal: https://t.co/lvCvsVB2BX my latest via @HuffPost
@FarKashani Agreed - lower cost, at least, to have Congress share the blame.
@FarKashani Congress can then annul the deal for Trump by snapping back sanctions under expedited procedure (i.e., no filibuster). I expect they will.
@FarKashani I think that is the likely outcome, but withholding certification to Congress can be done w/o ruling Iran is in breach of deal.
Safe to assume Haley sees her efforts on Iran as part of a case for her to replace Tillerson, who told Trump what he didn't want to hear.
Lastly - Haley's speech strongly catered to Trump's instinct not to certify, counter to many "adults" in room on Trump's nat sec team.
Not mentioned by Haley: no filibuster under INARA. Withholding certification gives deal opponents one more golden opportunity to kill deal.
Notion that Congress didn't have ability to weigh in on JCPOA totally false. Months of raucous debate - most do not want to revisit.
Haley says there are HUNDREDS of undeclared sites with suspicious activity! IAEA does not agree, or they would have requested access!
The notion the world is concerned about returning to status quo ante after JCPOA should be a WARNING SIGN, not an argument against JCPOA!
Haley compares to DPRK, sidestepping fact W. Bush blew up Agreed Framework to enable DPRK proliferation. Same risk w/ Trump &amp; Iran.
Further, assertions that Iran has violated deal, with citation of heavy water, is wholly false. IAEA confirmed compliance last week.
Plenty of deceptive arguments deployed, including assertions that JCPOA was meant to address non-nuclear behavior on its own. It wasn't.
If anyone had any doubt, Haley signaled that the Trump will withhold certification of JCPOA in October - enabling Congress to kill deal.
Haley appears entirely unaware that every agreement, including with Iran, is based on quid pro quo.
Haley cited Iran's exceeding of heavy water guidelines as violation. No hard cap, nor is heavy water key to Iran's nuclear program.
Haley says we were promised an end to Iran's nuclear program, 24/7 anytime/anywhere inspections &amp; no sunset. By whom?

@AliR_Ahmadi1 Some people obviously just want to smear the JCPOA, but others genuinely appear not to know the first thing about it for no good reason.
Yet, Trump admin so blatant in desires to kill the deal that they may be blamed for the JCPOA's collapse even if Iran backs out.
If long-term benefit of the JCPOA is nil, Iran is more likely to be the one to exit the agreement.
That's why so many JCPOA opponents are taking steps to put benefit of deal in doubt: new sanctions/push to cancel Boeing deal/decertify.
Hence, Iran has a strong incentive to stay in the JCPOA - if the U.S. doesn't step in and undercut benefit of sanctions relief.
Those saying Iran has reaped most JCPOA benefits up front are mistaken. Normalization of econ activity more important than unfrozen funds.

Further, US killing JCPOA and upping sanctions would create huge rally around the flag effects, making such a course even less feasible.
Hence, despite Trump's preferences, after JCPOA US would face real risk of crisis over nuclear program &amp; another costly war.
Even if US exerts substantial pressure after JCPOA, Iran could likely weaponize its nuclear program (1+ year) before regime faces collapse.
W/ 70% participation in last election and general approval of Rouhani, no indication Iran is eager for another revolution.
If US blows up JCPOA, there will be far less pressure on Iran than prior to JCPOA. Not enough to get a better deal, let alone topple govt.
Many reasons regime change, via sanctions or otherwise, is incoherent &amp; dangerous strategy with Iran.

Returning to pressure track w/ goal of zero enrichment would sabotage JCPOA, undermine future options and pave way to war/Iranian nuke.
But, if Trump admin undermines Iran's relief, the survival of the JCPOA will be in doubt &amp; there will be no trust for future arrangement.
For example, an understanding might be feasible wherein Iran imports enriched uranium in place of some enrichment capacity.
AP &amp; Iran's commitment never to seek/obtain nuclear weapons do not end. But any push to limit future enrichment would have to be creative.
Re: zero enrichment, the JCPOA imposes unprecedented restrictions for a period before Iran is treated like any other state under the NPT.

Hawks on each side will capitalize on deteriorating relations to push for more aggressive steps, increasing risk of war. It is lose-lose.
The end result will be no negotiations, Iran doubling down on all areas of concern as it sees increasing hostility from US, SA &amp; region.
How do you expect to negotiate on sensitive issues if you blame Iran for a terror attack and then levy terror sanctions on them?
It will undercut Rouhani soon after he floated lifting all non-nuclear sanctions (terror/missiles) during the campaign.
Proceeding w/ sanctions vote after Tehran attack sheds any pretext that this bill is to change Iran's behavior - it is solely punishment.
