Kavanaugh appealing to Trump by taking a play out of his playbook - blame politics and the media for the situation.
Seems convenient that Trump would schedule Rod Rosenstein meeting for Thursday. His firing would draw attention away from Kavanaugh hearing.
@stranahan Legality is relevant to those who want to protect what is hidden in his tax returns. In the spirit of transparency that Jr. claims to behold, citizens have a right to understand the extent of this President's financial entanglements
