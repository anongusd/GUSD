@charliekirk11 It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt Obama or trump. It was South Korea....Why do Americans believe that the US president is single handedly responsible for absolutely everything that happens in the world?
@charliekirk11 Because you can‚Äôt force your personal religion on other people‚Äôs children; no matter how much you want to
@Trippn21 @Corpse_Grind_ No, they don‚Äôt want a total ban...and I just told you 38 states would have to agree to it. Do you think 38 states would?
@Trippn21 @Corpse_Grind_ Yes, I think they will stop at less than a full ban....And even if they wanted a full ban, it would take 38 states to agree to repeal the 2nd amendment, which would never happen
@Corpse_Grind_ If u are a law abiding citizen then no one is coming to take your gun. Its about heighting gun laws so criminals have a harder time getting guns. And lets me clear, if the US military came to your house, don‚Äôt pretend like you would be able to hold them off just b/c u have a gun
@jonfavs Trump supports are not Americans üòë
@CollinRugg That‚Äôs some low quality bait
@DebraBeevers You think we should take away all cell phones??...and how is that a good analogy anyway? The goal isn‚Äôt to take away all guns, it‚Äôs to increase background checks, make certain high powered rifles illegal, and raise the age to buy guns to 21
@TalkingHands123 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Terrible analogy. The US is not a privately owned house
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Ya, it‚Äôs called North Korea
@SenateMajLdr The American people are the government. They own it...at least they are supposed to
@ShaneSexton07 @SenSanders No, you are not in danger of being shot for not paying your taxes like you would be in an armed robbery....and you aren‚Äôt being forced to do anything. You don‚Äôt have to live in this country you know. You don‚Äôt like the tax laws? Then leave
@ShaneSexton07 @SenSanders No, your anagolgy assumes people are in danger of being executed for not paying taxes. You will NOT be excexuted for refusal to pay taxes like a victim in a robbery might get killed for not handing over their wallet
@ShaneSexton07 @SenSanders Probably, but he does not put that gun to your head and shoot you if you don‚Äôt write a check, which is what you are saying happens to everyone who doesn‚Äôt pay taxes
@ShaneSexton07 @SenSanders The gun point analogy is flawed. You don‚Äôt get held at gun point for not paying taxes. Plus, I‚Äôm not not asking 1 individual to pay for everyone else‚Äôs homes. I‚Äôm asking EVERYONE in society contribute to a social safety net that EVERYONE can acces s if they unfortunately need it
@lizardq28875918 @SenSanders Hypocrisy on what?
@lizardq28875918 @SenSanders No, your solution makes 0 sense. Why should Bernie be overly generous to 1 family and let all the others die off VS making sure all familes caring for children have the bare minimum so they can then focus on becoming self-sufficient
@lizardq28875918 @SenSanders How does that help the other families?
@ShaneSexton07 @SenSanders And no one wants it to be a charity. Paying for things through taxes is not charity, you still have to pay for them. It‚Äôs way cheaper that way though, which is why it‚Äôs done for the necessities in life...Then you have more money to spend on luxuries in the free market
@lizardq28875918 @SenSanders You want him to uproot thousands of families and put them all in his house?
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo You want millions and millions of parents to drop out of the workforce and stay home to tutor their kids full-time?? Ridiculous! Income, employment, consumption &amp; investment would plummet dramatically. It would lead to a depression
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo Parents are tax payers as well. Many are paying more in taxes than you ....and parents would have to hire a full-time teacher to help young children navigate the online course. They would have to pay the teacher‚Äôs full salary. Absurdly expensive. Society couldn‚Äôt function
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo Crime is ABSOLUTELY linked to low education. Are you serious??? Not 100% of all crime ever, but alot of it, absolutely!!...And stop acting like a 7 year old kid can sit at home, alone, pay attention and navigate through an online course by themselves all day. That‚Äôs ridiculous.
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo Which brings us back to what I said B4. Privative costs will never be low enough 4 everyone to afford. Workforce will dramatically shrink, consumption &amp; investment will take a hug hit. Economy takes a big dive, and your money loses value. Plus, more crime since fewer R educated
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo You are making no sense. Do parents to have hire a private teacher while they are gone at work?...A 7 year old child will not be able to focus on and navigate though an 8 hour online course. Online courses (that‚Äôs arent 8hrs) many be good for adults, but  not for 7 year old kids
@ChrisCuuomo @gallan500 @NYGovCuomo You think kids should be on the computer 8 hours a day? That‚Äôs ridiculous &amp; unhealthy. You don‚Äôt think they should be learning social skills? Who watches the kids and makes sure they studying  while the parents are at work? What about kids with special needs?
@ChrisCuuomo @NYGovCuomo No, that‚Äôs not the issue. Education would be way too expensive in general if we only had private versions. Then parents would spend all their money on education bills instead of consuming on Main Street or investing in stocks
@ChrisCuuomo @NYGovCuomo No, that‚Äôs not a way it could work. Without public schools, tons of kids won‚Äôt have access to education which means they won‚Äôt grow up to participate in the work force. Which means the economy deteriorates and your precious money loses its value.
@ChrisCuuomo @NYGovCuomo Do you have a scholarly source for your 90% claim or are you inventing that statistic?
@ChrisCuuomo @NYGovCuomo Good idea. Who needs public schools anyway? Kids? Hahaha!

@FoxNewsResearch That‚Äôs great! And to think, all it took to pay for it was eliminate thousands of public sector jobs....I‚Äôm sick of social workers, teachers and firefighters; more Wells Fargo!!!!!
@TrumpJew America, remember this next time you go out and vote: 		Almost ALL Republicans voted to eliminate jobs for ordinary social workers, police officers, teachers, transit workers, firefighters, prison guards and construction workers.  		Happy Holidays America
@realamericadrew @SenWarren @GOP @realDonaldTrump And an increase in their expenses
@nick_hancock14 Do you want 0% taxes?
@JoshNbluegrass you accuse Dems of political calculation when they don‚Äôt kick out Franken and you also accuse them of political calculation when they do kick him out. Damned if they do, damned if they don‚Äôt...a political calculation  on your part
@JoshNbluegrass It won‚Äôt, but it should
@JoshNbluegrass U need due process to convict someone in criminal court, not to have them resign from public office. U don‚Äôt have the right to be an elected official.The allegations  against Franken and Moore are creditable enough to call 4 their resignation,but not necessarily their conviction
@JoshNbluegrass allegations are not meaningless.... Don‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking that the only two options about allegations are that they are either 1) completely meaningless or 2) 100% proof of guilt . There is a whole spectrum in-between that depends on the allegations themselves
@JurassicWorld A trailer for the trailer...
@GraceEnahoro @Kelsotaternutz @CraigRozniecki I‚Äôm not saying he should go to jail, I‚Äôm saying he should drop out of the senate race. There is a different amount of evidence required for the two. The several women coming forward with no holes or inconsistencies in their stories is enough evidence for him to drop out
@Kelsotaternutz @GraceEnahoro @CraigRozniecki That is not enough evidence to convict Roy Moore and send him to prison, but it is enough for him to step out of the senate race
@Kelsotaternutz @GraceEnahoro @CraigRozniecki witness account is evidence....If allocations are fabricated then journalists, investigators and police officers will be able to poke holes in the story. There have been no poked holes or inconsistencies in the statements by theses SEVERAL women, which makes them credible
@GraceEnahoro @Kelsotaternutz @CraigRozniecki You completely dodged my question.
@ScottPresler So your message to women who have been sexually assaulted is that they should never come forward unless they have the whole thing on video tape...do you also require that perpetrator state their name, address &amp; confession of guilt at the beginning of the tape?
@GraceEnahoro @CraigRozniecki The women coming forward with consistent stories is the proof. What evidence are you waiting for?
@upwardcajun Progressives hinder progress?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt see how refusing to compromise an inch and steam rolling over the minority party is an ‚Äúantidote‚Äù to the gridlock and disfunction in Congress either
@MitchLeeD763 That‚Äôs some low quality bait
@AFausnett @MoFrostingPleez The KKK is also considered a Right-wing organization...even though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to group the average republican with them
@AFausnett @MoFrostingPleez U are saying that republicans stood for equality in the 60‚Äôs? But now they hate Black Lives Matter, want gay marriage illegal in some states, want muslims banned from the county and don‚Äôt want transgender people serving in the military. The party sure did a 180 on social equality
@AFausnett @MoFrostingPleez Before the 70‚Äôs, the Republican party stood for higher taxes &amp; bigger government...Why?... B/C the parties DID switch. The party on right-side of the political spectrum has had many names over the years, but it has always represented the past and resistance to social change

@bernieharwood where you a single mom? We're paying off medical bill? We're caring for elderly parents? Had a disability?
@nease @SenSanders the increase in public spending will minimize inflation
@bernieharwood it's not unattainable for everyone, but it is for many. Don't assume all people have the same resources &amp; support in life
@bernieharwood college is financially unattainable for many and leaves others in debt. Free tuition is equal opportunity for all
@bernieharwood tuition free education doesn't mean a free degree?? You still have to qualify for college and then earn your diploma
