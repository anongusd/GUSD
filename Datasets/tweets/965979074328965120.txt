@escaped_ferret I don't even like video games. I've studied philosophy at the undergrad and grad levels, which doesn't even approach what I've read for fun, and find Epicurus does more for knowledge in 8 pages than Aquinas does in 800. I don't think this fellow has a point worth responding to.

@pwcdanica @DavidIRamadan Nitpick much? She's making a valid point, made a minor semantic error, and promptly corrected it.

There's no judgment throne before which we will all stand, no fallback option to make right the things we get wrong. 		If we want justice, we have to fight for it. If we want healing, we have to work toward it. If we want a better world, there's no one but is to build it.

@SteveWasHereb4 @SkepticNikki Answers in Genesis has talking points on this. "The Oort Cloud has never been observed. Old universe astronomers invented its existence to explain the fact that comets haven't all burned up."
@SkepticNikki It's not even evolution. It's denying the existence of a bunch of comets that became the issue.
@SkepticNikki My dad asked me if I'm an "Oort Cloud believer," and I knew saying yes would damage our relationship. It doesn't get much more laughable than that.
@ThatMandyNicole I agree with this. I also think human free will can't coexist with the laws of physics, but that's neither here nor there.

@aslipperyslope2 So it sort of comes down to the distinction that you can have independent objective truth if you leave the thing sitting on a table, but it becomes more nuanced when you pick it up to use or even discuss it. So both, I guess?
@aslipperyslope2 I do think there is reality beyond our constructs, both in things we can be tentatively certain of, and in the infinitude of possible knowledge we have yet to imagine. But as soon as we give words to the concepts, we bring them into the web of our societies.
@aslipperyslope2 I was just curious where you fell on that spectrum of views.
@aslipperyslope2 Oh gotcha. People have also made the case that science is only meaningful insofar as we understand it, and we understand it according to social constructs. It's an interesting discussion that pushes familiar boundaries of what we "know." :)
@aslipperyslope2 And I would really rather be educated than fight anyone ftr.
@aslipperyslope2 Such as the conservation of energy.
@aslipperyslope2 I'm open to that, just curious how it applies to things that seem to be true independently of any social context or interpretation.

@krassenstein Choosing a non-member is technically possible, but pushing for it assumes there's no Democrat in Congress who can do an equal or better job to Biden. He's also a guy of comparable age to Pelosi, so I really don't see why it shouldn't fall to her.

@pneumajustice It's a way for people with no "conversion testimony" to experience the same sort of ecstatic rededication at regular intervals, all while having to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal Himself because the words themselves have no emotional impact but what you bring by reading.
@pneumajustice It's such a powerful mechanism to secure and maintain loyalty. 1) you're supposed to read it every day, 2) you inevitably get bored and distracted because almost all of it is boring to read, 3) you feel guilty because you don't find it exciting all the time 4) Rededicate yourself

@ThatMandyNicole I was terrified before telling them that they'd disown me. But they didn't have to. They made me want to cut off all ties.
@ThatMandyNicole So I've gone back and forth between being frank and declining to answer. They worked about equally well. Until I found out that on their last visit they took my mother in law aside and apologized for letting me marry their daughter. So my relationship with them is over.
@ThatMandyNicole Avoiding subjects would almost be preferable. My family will ask about the most personal and controversial issues point blank and then complain about anxiety keeping them up all night because I answered "incorrectly" or declined to answer.

@hobbsisme When I first made my 180, I got really frustrated as I tried to redirect my theology study time into cosmology and quantum mechanics and finally realized I wasn't obligated to know or understand it all. It was a weird feeling letting go.
@ThatMandyNicole When I object to theism intellectually, they say I'm overthinking. When I tell my story, they say I'm bitter. I gave up trying to convince them of anything.
It's interesting how science is up for debate. The most interesting parts are the ones still being debated, but you only get to participate if you come to grips with the parts that aren't.
@curlytopnola @thehill His entire argument was that people who didn't like it should go somewhere else, so...
@hobbsisme The Supreme Court said In God We Trust on the money flies because it's "ceremonial deism," that's legal as long as it's not being used as a way to push any religion in particular. That's the basis, though I'm not aware of it having been settled in the school context.

@Lorisadventure @scerloth But seriously, the stupidest stuff is existentially important to my old life friends and family. Eventually I stopped caring.
@Lorisadventure @scerloth I make a point of googling anything I learned growing up whenever I think of it. It's less embarrassing than saying something crazy in front of people.

@TenaciousMandy Last time my parents visited, we went for a hike, and I stepped over the boundary to get a better view off the overlook. My dad said "I hope your wife is already pregnant so we get something out of all this if you fall to your death."

@Harold_Camping @JeanMorena4 I think it can be a bridge, even speaking as an active secular humanist who escaped fundamentalism. Some people prefer a more positive version of the faith, some leave it entirely. I'm not about to disparage the fact that people are moving on either way.
Progressives, let's try not to scare away questioning conservatives right now. People are switching sides, and that takes time. Give them room to share some of our goals, and we can use their help.

@C_Stroop There's a branch of creationism that's made a talking point of denying the Oort Cloud exists. The existence of a cloud of chunks of ice beyond the orbit of Pluto is a point of tension in my family.
@C_Stroop Today my dad asked if I'm an Oort Cloud believer, and I had an adrenaline rush because I knew saying yes was a big deal in our relationship. I don't think it gets more #Exvangelical than that.

@hemantmehta Think of Gen Z, already the least religious in human history, and take in the fact that this is the only Christianity they've ever known: afraid to go to school because of gun violence only to have their elder relatives lecture them about the Second Amendment.

@ThatDeborahGirl @Captain_X_Gogo @DaShanneStokes @nasty_woman2 Did that used to be the law?
@Captain_X_Gogo @DaShanneStokes @nasty_woman2 It already can. It's called impeachment.
@DaShanneStokes The simplest adjustment would be to require the administrative agencies to submit proposed regulations to the Senate for ratification. It would not make it impossible to govern, but it would limit the president from making policy unilaterally.

@C_Stroop You're killing my optimism, Smalls.
@JRehling @slightlylit The problem with pressing this comparison is that I know people who have actually started living by all of these instead of abandoning the first one. Maybe, just maybe, it's the Bible that's making otherwise good people more bigoted than they would otherwise be.
@C_Stroop Not to minimize the effect you're describing, but ironic to notice how they both blame each other for losing the culture war.
@C_Stroop Either that or they double down harder to make sure their kids don't encounter any contrary views in media, education, or even extended family. Then blame (marginally) adaptive evangelicals for not keeping their kids from leaving the faith.
@TenaciousMandy It's unfalsifiable, but it gives you a framework to explain things if you make excuses for it. It's also functionally identical to God not existing at all.
@TenaciousMandy But in II Sunday School 3:16 they said God always answers prayer, just sometimes he says no and sometimes he says wait.
Can we agree, as a society, whether we're going to spell the name Stephen with a ph or a v? I'm fine with either, but uniformity would save a lot of trouble.
@JRehling @JudasByNight Glad they covered "don't mix fabrics" right away but saved "don't own people" for future generations to figure out.
@JudasByNight How do you feel about the Pirate Party?
@JoyParadeBlog Even if she is an advocate for egality in leadership, she has to know how far most churches are from that to begin with.
@JoyParadeBlog Even with the most generous interpretation of the original post, there is so much toxic about saying any form of abuse or hell, even objections, can only be addressed by going to the internal, almost exclusively male leadership.
@alexandraerin Wait, most people don't do that?
Is it possible to have negative credibility? Because I think I know some people whose assertion actually makes something less likely to be true.
It's pretty safe to say POTUS has destroyed Andrew Scheer's prospects more than Trudeau ever could alone. 		Standing down Trump has Canada rallying.
@RLStollar Either that or the churches will be empty in our lifetimes.
@carlygelsinger He didn't even sacrifice him, he just told his slaves, employees, sex slaves, etc. he was "willing" and that they should hold such unquestioning obedience as an ideal.
@storyheadjillmc @C_Stroop If only to the sure fire part.
@asway93 The presidency would be a good stepping stone for her true potential, like an internship.
@asway93 She's such an inspiration to all of us.
@LaraTWhite @TransEthics Of which century?
@thistallawkgirl Probably thinks the White House burned in 1812 though.
Take a shot when someone on the #MAGA blogosphere blames Obama for not stopping the Canadians from burning the White House in the War of 1812.
@C_Stroop I just read the whole thread and fully agree with you. Some people find they can do more in religion by avoiding politics and vice versa, but unfortunately the contents of Evangelical Christianity are incompatible with a hard separation. Their muddling of those is not my problem.
@C_Stroop I can vote for that.
@C_Stroop Define what happens exactly if we decide yes.
@synredae @Soapbox_Atheist I was taught growing up that the speed of light changes, and it took a week and a half into an undergraduate astrophysics class to realize it wasn't ignorance, at least on the part of some of the authors. It was propaganda.
@synredae @Soapbox_Atheist Have you seen some of the creationist responses to this, though? Saying light can speed up or slow down as needed to cross the universe in less time, "general relativity" meaning time slows down to give the light time to travel, all sorts of great stuff.
@synredae @Soapbox_Atheist Entire supernovas and galactic formations fabricated in light that most humans in history never noticed, for the sole purpose of deceiving educated humans for the final few centuries before the Second Advent.
@CFD_Steve Oh, that sounds worse. Eventually I dated my wife, as much as it panicked my family. My father in law would have laughed his butt off if I asked for his permission to court her.
@C_Stroop I'll check out the online one for sure. I want to study his life and political work more if you have any recommendations.
@C_Stroop That's some deeply fascinating stuff. I've been looking for a semi-affordable English translation of Ostrogorski's treatise on comparative partisan ideology if you know where to find used ones.
Whatever the short term holds, when I think about the long term, I think about how more women are running for office this cycle than any other in human history. Not all of them will win, but the world will never be the same.		 #WomenRule
@MarkRomaDesigns @C_Stroop That's a real over the hill moment. Wow.
@asway93 I tried to convince my little brothers growing up that the carpet grows, and so you have to mow it with the vacuum cleaner. Unfortunately that was about the age they stopped believing those things I told them.
@C_Stroop What time period do you specialize in?
@CFD_Steve So much pain with this one. Is it worse that it happened twice before I lost faith in courtship?
@ICT_Pinup @micahjmurray Yes, yes it was.
@AtheistRepublic Or you could have a relationship with her if you get over yourself a little.
@paulogia0 Just go vintage and call it George.
@AtheistRepublic My family...
@C_Stroop What about the part where you finally come out and they recruit the entire church to pray and fast for you? Isn't that the best?
@tedcruz Gotta love those States' rights...
@EGBridges Haven't you heard? It's persecution if you ask them not to tell you what to do.
@curlytopnola After resigning, he was assumed to be ripe for prosecution until the pardon saw prosecutors go after his staff instead.
@curlytopnola He was actually about to be impeached and convinced by Congress. The country has come close to removing a president three times, but only ever seen two acquittals and one resignation.
@stucam7771 @WxJAK I'm a legitimate former conservative who would love nothing better than to teach people how to reach them, but I know how rare it is. Just find the people on your side and get them plugged in.
@curlytopnola Remember Ford's pardon of Nixon for "any crimes he may have committed between" x and y dates.
@Soapbox_Atheist @JudasByNight Worst of all when they were used to power and just barely began to lose it.
@chrislhayes It sounds like we need to focus on some Congressional seats, then.
@andreacasso @RLStollar I just love how they didn't calculate for the kids who aren't going to end up sharing that faith into adulthood.
@HomeschoolAnon Yeah, I was taught all of that, right down to the purpose of my existence being to breed an army of conservatives for Jesus.
@andreacasso @RLStollar We were the Joshua Generation, called to save America from Satan and the left.
@andreacasso @RLStollar That's chillingly familiar.
Your friendly reminder that there's an actual, self-proclaimed #NAZI running for U.S. Congress as the GOP nominee, which adds context to the Administration's stated agenda to empower the German far right.
@HomeschoolAnon No Magic Treehouse because magic is Satanic.
@h8cloz It's almost like the holier than thou attitude has partisan motivations...
I really, really don't care about scandals that happened twenty years ago. That's for history teachers to discuss, not news anchors. The current President thinks he is accountable to no law whatsoever, and that is where we need to focus.
@biolojical @Anderson_Caat_ It does seem to change quickly when you put it that way.
@ubiquitous817 The difference between these is that one would substantively destroy the United States' trust with the world and the world's institutions.
@juliawb I'm a civilian too lol, but it's not that complicated. He's going to need things that light his base on fire that don't require Congress. He could do this the moment impeachment proceedings begin just to rally his base.
I'm going public with my hitherto private prediction:		Trump is going to announce his intent to withdraw from the United Nations at some point before leaving office.		I hope I'm wrong, and I have been before, but I'm a former conservative operative who understands Trump's base.
@fawfulfan @debilu2 There is also a strong chance we will see the administration push the limits of raw executive power even further, given that they have nothing to lose with Congress.
@SteveSchmidtSES @Hannah3219 If we had gone that route, the Queen would have dismissed Prime Minister Trump within three months.
@KEBrightbill That sucks, but isn't it incredible how their zeal to refute each other undoes each of them.
@KEBrightbill I remember studying the Bible and feeling jealous of all those people my age who heard one side of it and embraced it unapologetically while all I could think about was the other side's proof texts.
@KEBrightbill I'm convinced that uncertainty was the first subtle crack in the dam of my worldview. Not being able to use the Bible to settle on Calvinism or dispensationalism led me to atheism, full stop.
@KEBrightbill Wow. My church growing up was very dispensational. Everyone I knew in homeschooling was calvinistic. I spent hundreds of hours in studying and memorizing the bible trying to understand theology and never could reach an airtight conclusion about who was right.
@TXDemocrat @johnegibson She moved to Virginia, got elected RNC chair, and just finished second at the R district convention. I know her fairly well, actually. She's legit crazy.
@krassenstein @Makeitstop99 That's what a subpoena is for, sweetheart.
@KEBrightbill Man, here's where not growing up Calvinist saved me from a lot of that stuff.
@krassenstein It may be symbolic in practice.
@TXDemocrat @johnegibson She just ran for Congress in my district and lost the nomination, actually.
@KEBrightbill I appreciate his honesty. He doesn't try to hide the slavery aspect. He comes right out and says it's biblical.
@KEBrightbill Oooh that's fun. We read a few of Wilkins' books and that trainwreck of a civil war debate for homeschooling, but I assumed he was less mainstream than that.
@KEBrightbill Wait, did Wilson have a connection with Steve Wilkins?
@Atheism_Tweets @LilithLiberated Not at the time, honestly. I was also homeschooled, so church was 90% of my social life.
@omarslopezarce @AtheistRepublic Interesting. Can you tell me more? I try to follow comparative domestic politics, but I'm not familiar with this guy.
@hobbsisme You misspelled never read the Shack and were convinced it was heretical and evidence of the degradation of the church.
@krassenstein My first question is what state employees were going to Oklahoma.
@neiltyson What would a transport ship loaded with semi-truck trailers be?
@C_Stroop @elizabethjdias Considering the God he worships, it's sort of true by definition.
@StTheosaurusRex @C_Stroop There's no hyperbole. I was point blank taught almost all of the things I read following the #christianaltfacts, and taught that people in "the world" are inherently being indoctrinated by virtue of not being taught them.
@ProfBeau @C_Stroop Interesting. When I think about it, most of my middle and early high school was like you're describing. I took the initiative on my education around that time and read the thought leaders that people in my community respected. Rushdoony was central, if behind the scenes.

@quinnscicluna Didn't you hear, humanity peaked in 1450 B.C.
@AMandolin1 The sad thing about @riledScientist's point is that I never connected those dots until I was out of the church and learned that the ancient Hebrew faith wasn't originally monotheistic.
@mwestramke It's not a debate on Christian ethics until someone shouts Hitler was an atheist.
@FlexibleDreams My Sunday teacher told us about the missing rib thing and said boys each have one rib missing "to use to make the girls." I wondered what girl out there was made from mine.
@coffeemomrepeat @allicat1214 @C_Stroop I remember watching Bedknobs and Broomsticks as a family so we could discuss all the satanic messages and sort of immunize ourselves to them.

@badmilennial @1950s1960sTVFan I love the part of the flood narrative where kangaroos get to Australia without leaving any fossils, which they explained as "fossils stopped being made after the flood." So I asked why the bison have so many fossils tracing the path to North America.
@micahjmurray I distinctly remember this one.
@hisehisebaby94 @hankgreen You forgot House, M.D. basically two shows need to exist.
@brchastain What were some Class B examples?
@ProfBeau @C_Stroop Van Til and Rushdoony were cornerstones of my secondary education. As I reached high school, my parents started regretted that they had emphasized a classical perspective so much, saying they would ignore Greek and Latin sources in favor of Hebrew if they could do it again.
@C_Stroop @ProfBeau And eventually "apologetics research" turned seamlessly into honest inquiry. Learning "the other side" led to every doubt I had about my own.
@C_Stroop @ProfBeau One of the biggest contributors to my early doubts was people telling me it was too dangerous to study other worldviews, such as Catholicism or evolution. I pushed back, studied other worldviews to learn how to defend Christianity better...
@C_Stroop Why is knowledge worth gaining, how do different facts relate to each other, how do you know what you know? Presuppositionalism and biblical inerrancy are the foundation to answering every conceivable question within a self-contained alternative framework.
@C_Stroop Honestly I don't know where to start. #ChristianAltFacts in education are probably most pernicious when they pertain to the way information is presented. Any one incorrect fact can be corrected, but it's the deeper things that shape you...
@hankgreen My wife loves that show and I'll never understand why.

@1950s1960sTVFan Have you tried Episcopalian?
@1950s1960sTVFan I would expect you to be at home in a UU community and probably be able to find other people who share those beliefs there. The interesting bit about UU's is that they don't have a creed. They're a community for the liberal subsets of all faiths and of no faith at all to meet.
@1950s1960sTVFan I've been there. It takes time to make that transition, and I know I took mine. I've been active in the Unitarian Universalist church if you want to check them out at some point. Good luck.
@1950s1960sTVFan I'm curious then, if you don't mind my asking, where are you working for change? Have you found a denomination or organization that gives you an outlet?

@TXDemocrat Interesting. There's an application of this that functions like a requirement to store weapons unloaded. I could go for that.

@pwcdanica @JohnofUs4Prez I love comparative municipal government! Best of luck getting there!
@JohnofUs4Prez @pwcdanica HoD races are up in odd numbered years, so she will be in her second term in 2020. That leaves her free to run for whatever else she wants on an even numbered year. And yes, hence the quotes around boring.
@JohnofUs4Prez @pwcdanica I was, but partly as hyperpole. She's not running for HoD in 2020, but the point is we need more public servants focusing on the "boring" issues that affect our daily lives.
@pwcdanica God yes. If nobody else does this, please run on it yourself.

I know Stoic is in my bio, but damn. I've been reexploring the Epicurean greats, and there is so much to love. 		Lucretius takes me to new places. Epicurus' letter to Herodotus does more for knowledge in eight pages than Aquinas could in eight hundred.		I'm moved.

From a former conservative operative, the #GunControl issue is changing more than it has in our lifetimes. It's time for change if you make this issue keep moving.

@TricyrtisHirta @C_Stroop I responded via direct message if anyone else wants to ask me.
@BLSFG14 @C_Stroop @thedailybeast @jaymichaelson @DrJamesCDobson @FocusOnTheFamiy Less any point I can look at than the gradual growing of doubts, countless hours researching comparative ideas and finally deciding I couldn't keep my views a secret anymore when Trump won the nomination in '16.
@C_Stroop The day after I finished my last conservative contract for work, I contacted the Southern Poverty Law Center to explain a few details they weren't even aware of.

@BLSFG14 @C_Stroop @thedailybeast @jaymichaelson @DrJamesCDobson @FocusOnTheFamiy Activism uses basically the same skills regardless of which side you use them for.
@BLSFG14 @C_Stroop @thedailybeast @jaymichaelson @DrJamesCDobson @FocusOnTheFamiy We went to conferences every year, usually in Oregon or Washington near where I grew up. We travelled for a few when the big name speakers were there: Ham, Philips, Baucham, Swanson...
@BLSFG14 @C_Stroop @thedailybeast @jaymichaelson @DrJamesCDobson @FocusOnTheFamiy My gender conferred a degree of privilege within the community. The higher ed I received was largely to equip me to be a conservative activist. Worked out... interestingly.

Has anyone who's not already beyond help ever been convinced by the "Democrats were racist in the 1850's" argument? Has any historically literate person been stumped by that?
@C_Stroop @thedailybeast @jaymichaelson The thing is, guys like James Dobson recruit families to homeschool with relatively reactionary arguments, but once you're in that world, it's guys like Rushdoony who actually influence the kids' worldviews.

@HashtagCMartin @krassenstein He has sheeple nationwide.  He runs out of money when he is irrelevant. He raises money when he crusades because that's what his donor list wants.
@krassenstein @Mallieyork Unfortunately we would have to wait four years for that, because he missed the deadline. By that point, there will be an incumbent (likely Republican) lined up for term two. Less payoff in that case.
Remember last time a House #chaplain stood down the Speaker? Me neither, @SpeakerRyan.

Just stop waving historically stupid ideas about states' rights and heritage on this #ConfederateMemorialDay. If you romanticize a murderous cause dedicated in its own founders' words to inequality and perpetuated by treason, you are ignorant, evil, or both.

"The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to African slavery as it exists, the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution." #confederatehistorymonth
@AP_Politics Here is a sign that the party in power lacks the ability to govern and must instead act like a perpetual opposition party. What about the policies you've already passed? What about policies you've yet to pass? Can you run on a positive message to maintain your own majority?

I've never loved @MittRomney, but he is quickly becoming the leader of the antiadministration GOP. It takes the House and two thirds of the Senate to remove a president. If that is going to happen, Romney is the most likely candidate to whip the R votes. https://t.co/fxC0mI7gGj
@RedTRaccoon Not defending this guy, but we have to be realistic. Utah will elect a republican to the Senate. Period. Romney stands to become the anti-Trump republican leader. Removing a president from office requires two thirds of the Senate, which requires bipartisan support.
@JPM_80 You could say no thank you?
I'm glad to hear #NASA has a new leader to fill the gap. My choice would be someone with stem experience, *cough @neiltyson cough* but I will watch @JimBridenstine with critical interest and expect him to honor one of America's best institutions.

the strikes with him after they've spent the past year butting heads with #Trump . If you want to criticize the United States' policy in Syria, then criticize it, but be careful reading other stories into it.
Nobody opposes #POTUS more than I do, but I have to pause when some people may be overselling their case. If you think the strikes in #Syria were intended to distract from the #Mueller investigation, my question is how the #Trump convinced #TheresaMay and #Macron to coordinate
