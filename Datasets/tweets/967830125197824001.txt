@realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk @JudicialWatch @TomFitton This is why fixing the justice department needs to be done now! #cjreform The Justice Department has victimized millions of families for years. @potus a rich, powerful, and intelligent man is going through all of this, how can anyone survive the wrong doings of the system.

To put it plain and simple the BOP has approximately 20,000 inmates housed in minimum security prisons. Which means they are either out custody or community custody. It cost approximately $38,000 per year to house them. That means it cost $760,000,000 	Per year! WOW!

@shonhopwood If they even have a seat after next election. But why wait till then when it can be done now?
@shonhopwood @PrisonFed I totally agree with you, they could have and should have. However lets not limit congressional action to these things that administration can do. I am not oppose to congressional action however it does not go far enough. FAMM = FAMILIES AGAINST MANDATORY MINUMUMS. #STAYFOCUSED
@shonhopwood @PrisonFed I am not sure how the mid terms will look. I am just saying that we have to look at both alternatives when weighing the situation. I feel they should combine both bills, and then we can go from there.
@shonhopwood Or  the same which is why we should not settle for the #firststepact
@shonhopwood @PrisonFed Besides the key things many supporters of the #firststepact bring up can be fixed by the DOJ, or better yet BOP administration. This is common decency. 500 miles, unshackling of pregnant women, the correct good time, extra commissary and phone. These do not need congress.
@shonhopwood @PrisonFed Sentencing reform needs to be added to this bill. The bills need to be combined takong the best from both bills. I on the other hand think if it is not passed now it wont pass for a few more decades.
@PrisonFed @shonhopwood So this is what we are going to call reform? That does not fix the problem. You have to have front and backend changes to see true reform. Let's not settle for crumbs cause this might be the only food we will get for a very, very long time.
@Scaramucci @MichaelAvenatti @StephenAtHome I tried to with @jeffsessions however he is busy blocking sentencing reform.
@shonhopwood Great point. However there are numerous other issues their discretion can be removed from. 	Also if this was to pass when would the secomd step act pass? What will it include? Who is working on that legislation?
@shonhopwood You are absolutely correct. However that is not the law as Congress wrote it. BOP made their own interpertation, resulting in inmates receiving 47 days. This point only amplifies why the first step act and allowing the bop the discretion to implement things is an utter failure.
Injustice is not a gender, race or geographical issue. It is a humanity issue. We as a people need to demand more than the #firststepact proposes.
Everytime someone wants to say how great the #firststepact is they mention the unshackling of pregnant women, keeping inmates within 500 driving miles of their family (geesh), or inmates finally getting their 54 opposed to 47 days of good time which is already the law.,
@RightOnCrime @BernardKerik Add some sentencing reform language into the bill ie. The #SRCA2017 and the bill may be just that a first step. Until then it is not much for reform either.

The BOP underutilizes the furlough program, and does not allow inmates to work in community for pay only for free. This is ridiculous. The first step act rewards inmates with more commissary spending and more phone time. Both of those options take money from the inmate.

There needs to be a clear cut reward  system for those incarcerated. Not left to the interpertation of wardens, directors, and others personal beliefs. Any bill lacking this fundamental must have will surely fail.
Why aren't furloughs utilized in the #FirstStepAct ? To often wardens reject prisoners ability to re-intergrate into society. Furloughs should be optimized in this bill, as well as release to community supervision.
@AmesCG However the halfway houses are being closed, and are not capable at this time to even accomodate those that are currently elgible. So how is this first step act suppose to correct that?
