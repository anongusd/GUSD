In other words, this is nothing more than a political sham. The right vote is ‘no.’ #NC07

The @realDonaldTrump's action today is a very good first step to help stop Iran’s nuclear weapons program from advancing further. #irandeal #POTUS
Iran is the #1 state sponsor of terrorism providing direct aid to regional proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas &amp; the Taliban — all for the ultimate purpose of destroying Israel &amp; America.  The #irandeal ultimately would have guaranteed Iran a nuclear bomb capable of reaching the US
President Trump is right to pull out of the Iran deal and to re-impose sanctions.  The agreement has proved to be horribly flawed, just as many of us have warned since day one.  #irandeal

For more on how #NC07 citizens have benefited from #taxreform, please click here --&gt; https://t.co/1opXcTxxhi #taxreform #taxday
Thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, #NC07 families will be able to keep more of their money as a result of the doubling of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000.  #taxreform #taxday
Nearly doubling the standard deduction will allow individuals &amp; married couples to keep more of their hard-earned money.  #NC07 example --&gt; Michael from Ocean Isle Beach who shared with my office that he’s now able to “afford the new car I was so badly needing.” #taxreform
Since the enactment of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, more than 4 million Americans are seeing pay raises and benefits.  #NC07 example --&gt; Atlantic Packaging, headquartered in ILM, which has given its employees a $1,000 bonus #taxreform #taxday
In honor of #TaxDay, I want to share some of the benefits of #taxreform 1. Relief to main street job creators.  2.  Nearly doubling the standard deduction.  3.  Expanding the child tax credit.  4  Repealing the unfair individual mandate
This time next year, Americans will file their taxes under a fairer, simpler tax system that will improve the standard of living for Americans, strengthen our economy and bring jobs back. #TaxDay #taxreform
The #SyriaStrike sends a clear message to our enemies who engage in this despicable behavior.  I know every citizen joins me in saying a special thanks to all the brave men and women who serve our country and make it the greatest force mankind has ever known.
Russia and Iran are equally responsible for they are, if nothing else, financing Assad and keeping his regime propped up.  I'm pleased to see @realDonaldTrump respond and lead our country and Allies in significantly degrading Assad’s chemical weapon capabilities.  #Syria

Senate Republicans have 51 members, and it takes 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass a Continuing Resolution to reopen the federal government.  Senate Dems should join Senate GOP to do what is right for our men and women in uniform — end the #SchumerShutdown. RT if you agree.
The #schumershutdown means nearly 100,000 national guardsmen will be sent home from training.  It means that Pilot Training and other training programs will be cancelled harming our readiness and putting operations in severe jeopardy.
Our country faces the greatest foreign threats since World War II.  The #SchumerShutdown means our troops are not paid and veterans cannot receive the benefits they are rightfully due.
