@teena_turnup Second of all, racism infects BOTH parties. It infects whites, blacks, Asians, and Latinos (and everyone in between).
@teena_turnup No, I'm not arguing that either. First of all, they could've been wrong and not lies.
@teena_turnup The civil rights movement wasn't divided up in such a binary fashion.
@teena_turnup No, blacks seeking civil rights always stood alongside each other. We sided with whoever advanced justice.
@teena_turnup We were DEAD in 08, until 2010. We conducted our own POST MORTEM in 2012, only to come to life again in 2014.

@teena_turnup I explained that in my answer. He stood against the GOP to support a racist Democrat position. Keep in mind, his reasoning was

@teena_turnup of Democrats to vote against the Civil Rights Act of 64 (?). That made the GOP's standard bearer appear to be in leagues with
@teena_turnup legislation than did Democrats. Time and time again, that was the case. Where Goldwater lost blacks was in joining a gaggle
@teena_turnup ...Proof of this is in the Congressional voting records on civil rights legislation. More Republicans ascended to civil rights
@teena_turnup They most certainly did. But there was no open appeal for Southerners on civil rights grounds...

@teena_turnup Trump HAS no principle. Trump doesn't care about the @GOP, nor does he care about conservatism. That places him at stark odds
@teena_turnup way for the Reagan landslides and the conservative resurgence. Trump is not like Goldwater in this sense at all.
@teena_turnup In a lot of ways, too, he was a test case--a weather vane to find a floor of conservative political support. This paved the

@teena_turnup We don't know that, because that's not true.
@teena_turnup ...a movement, then who else is with him in this movement? Clearly, this is a personality thing.
@teena_turnup The question to pose to Trumpsters is: Is D.T. the leader of a movement or is he just a big personality? If he's pt of...
@teena_turnup History can answer that now: what are Trump's principles? We know AuH2O's. What has Trump contributed to conservatism?
@teena_turnup I say that to say: there will be no Trump political party. This is just a bad, bad, trip.
@teena_turnup It'll be like waking up hungover, naked in bed, alongside farm animals &amp; a stranger in a clown suit. @GOP is drunk right now.
