4) Justices serving for a long time on the Court is nothing new. John Marshall served for 34 years. Joseph Story: 33 years. The infamous Roger Taney: 28 years. The list goes on. (7/8)
3) ‚ÄúSome legal scholars argue that the framers never intended Supreme Court justices to serve for a lifetime.‚Äù I think Article III, Section 1 and Federalist 78 make clear that the Framers did intend justices to serve for a lifetime. (6/8)
In other words, it's really difficult to figure out a smooth transition from life-tenured judges to term-limited judges, and the rationale for 18-year term limits falls apart when justices don‚Äôt uniformly finish their terms. (5/8)
‚ÄúTwo problems concerning implementation of our proposal merit special discussion: the application of our proposal to the current Justices or to the sitting President, and the treatment of vacancies that arise midterm due to the death or early resignation of a Justice.‚Äù (4/8)
2) The 18-year term limit plan also has several design flaws. As Professors Calabresi and Lindgren acknowledge in their excellent article (which the Hill cites), (3/8)
1) The article claims that term limits ‚Äúwould have avoided what ultimately happened to D.C. Circuit Court Chief Judge Merrick Garland.‚Äù Not so. The 18-year term limit plan does nothing to prevent the Senate from indefinitely delaying a vote on a Supreme Court nominee.  (2/8)
