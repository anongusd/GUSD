Google search data also confirms what FBI background check data has found: Interest in guns tends to increase around the holidays, especially Thanksgiving/Black Friday and Christmas. (5/7) https://t.co/sVoNbpPxz5
The correlation between Google searches for popular guns and the number of FBI background check was true at the state level, too. States with more search activity had more background checks, per capita. (4/7) https://t.co/JFGGSwwx4F
We found that Google search interest in popular guns was strongly correlated with the number of background checks processed by the FBI. As search interest went up, so did background check activity. (3/7) https://t.co/IjLqEkcoN4
We compiled a list of 416 popular gun makes and models. Then we analyzed US Google searches for those guns dating back to 2012. We focused on specific gun types, rather than generic search terms like “guns,” to capture interest in firearms as a potential consumer product. (2/7)

Moving forward, Trump has two big structural advantages in getting his judges confirmed: a Senate controlled by his own party and a simple majority threshold (rather than the past 60-vote threshold). This is the end of the thread.
Presidents have generally become less successful in getting their judges confirmed by the Senate. JFK’s success rate was 99%; Obama’s was 83%. (It’s too early to tell how Trump will do on this score.) https://t.co/8oikIMhASM https://t.co/BQ6tFM1lZM
It's taking the Senate longer to confirm federal judges, too. Per CRS, 64% of Obama’s “uncontroversial” circuit court nominees waited more than 200 days. Only 5% of Reagan’s “uncontroversial” circuit court nominees waited that long. https://t.co/Hi69BiWUkG https://t.co/005yK5iHHO
Trump’s 29 confirmed judges to date — counting three who were confirmed this week — have faced an average of nearly 23 “no” votes on the Senate floor, a far higher average than any other president’s. https://t.co/8oikIMhASM https://t.co/B1e9Wt1CbB
It used to be exceedingly rare for a president’s judicial picks to face Senate opposition. Just one of JFK’s judges had *any* votes cast against him on the Senate floor. That was Thurgood Marshall, and the year was 1962. https://t.co/sj0UE1THxE
