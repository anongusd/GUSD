Like a good neighbor, @StateFarm is there smoking on our public sidewalks in Dallas..please be kind  and keep our air clean.
@StateFarm Please quit smoking on our neighborhood sidewalks in Dallas!!!
@StateFarm How can you ban State Farm smokers on SF land and make them smoke on public sidewalks? I Have SF insurance & I will bail soon,
@StateFarm  Did SF Dallas say they would quit smoking on the public sidewalks? This is really not cool to the neighbors that walk and run.
@StateFarm thank you very much for addressing this.  The walkers and runners will appreciate the clean air when they are on the sidewalks.
@statefarm SF in Dallas has probably a 20 acre campus...they should make an outside area with tables for the smokers on the SF land.
@statefarm since you have a no smoke policy..smokers then all walk off campus to public areas in a residential area. Neighbors don't like it
@statefarm your Dallas employees smoke on the public sidewalks/ you must have a no smoke policy on the SF campus. It's not good for SF image
