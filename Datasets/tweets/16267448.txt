@rogerwright533 @Sumergirl84 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA Hi @rogerwright533 sorry it took so long to respond! I have been on 33 day campaign tour around California. Important role of Lt. Governor is sitting on the board of @UofCalifornia so I think the fact that @ColeHarrisCA &amp; @Dave4LA flunked out of college makes them unqualified.
@DTrumplican @sibuegoesbyebye @BayAreaGOP @LydiaOrtega4CA @realDonaldTrump @JoinTravisAllen @Dave4LA I was at the debate but not allowed to speak. The media allowed 4 Democrats but only 1 Republican to speak. I think they picked @LydiaOrtega4CA for ethnic diversity. Lydia is not a Republican. She registered Republican in Nov 2017.

Don‚Äôt throw your vote away on @Dave4LA , Vote @DavidFennell for Lt Governor!
@savvyconsumer7 @marietweetss I think one problem @Dave4LA has is the Lieutenant Governor sits on the board of the @UofCalifornia and Mr. Hernandez dropped out of college. Also Dave runs and loses every year. Please vote @DavidFennell for Lieutenant Governor! I won‚Äôt let you down!

@sfberniecrats @BayArea4Bernie @ORContraCosta @JeffersonianAll @GayleforCA @DSA_SF @DSAEastBay @OurRevolutionLB @JeffBleichCA @EleniForCA @latimes @SFGate Again, so far my experience with Obamacare is costs went up service went down. I know a lot of good doctors who dropped out of the profession because they were losing money. So we are going to have to respectfully agree to disagree.
@BayArea4Bernie @ORContraCosta @JeffersonianAll @GayleforCA @DSA_SF @DSAEastBay @OurRevolutionLB @JeffBleichCA @EleniForCA @latimes @SFGate @sfberniecrats Why?
@ORContraCosta @BayArea4Bernie @JeffersonianAll @GayleforCA @DSA_SF @DSAEastBay @OurRevolutionLB @JeffBleichCA @EleniForCA @latimes @SFGate @sfberniecrats 4) I am for peace.

@ORContraCosta @BayArea4Bernie @JeffersonianAll @GayleforCA @DSA_SF @DSAEastBay @OurRevolutionLB @JeffBleichCA @EleniForCA @latimes @SFGate @sfberniecrats 3) I believe the best way to create livable wage is to cut government red tape that makes it harder to innovate &amp; create new jobs. If you set minimum wage too high employers will buy automation that replaces workers.
@ORContraCosta @BayArea4Bernie @JeffersonianAll @GayleforCA @DSA_SF @DSAEastBay @OurRevolutionLB @JeffBleichCA @EleniForCA @latimes @SFGate @sfberniecrats I support public schools and went to a public high school. I am against government waste like Janet Napolitano‚Äôs hidden UC slush fund.

@Patriotmom2one @lisak0623 @R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA You lost me. Explain.
@lisak0623 @R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen The other Lt. Governor candidates seem to be sheep that just follow my lead a week later. So now that I endorsed @TheRealJohnHCox I expect my opponents @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA &amp; @LydiaOrtega4CA will follow. So what is your 2nd criteria in deciding Lt. Gov? #MAGA
@ShawnRobb3 Hi @ShawnRobb3 ! Thanks for the message. Who do you plan to vote for Lt. Gov?
@jesuspsr @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Hi @jesuspsr ! Welcome to the conversation! So, who are you voting for Lt. Governor? Please check out your voter guide and consider @DavidFennell ! Thanks! #MAGA
@Mar_MarTweet @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @Dave4LA do you want to man up and admit you have no 4 year college degree? I don‚Äôt think @BerkeleyCRs  or @caldems want a Republican Lt. Governor that mislead voters about dropping out of college to get a @UofCalifornia board position that governs @UCBerkeley. Just tell truth!
@Mar_MarTweet @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Hi Mariana! Don‚Äôt vote  @Dave4LA . He is misleading voters. CA Lt. Governor sits on board of @UofCalifornia . He implied he had a college degree to get CRA endorsement. I tried to set up a debate at his college. I learned he lied about his degree. He has no degree. He is a fraud.
@ArthurCSchaper @KonRoditis @JoinTravisAllen @MarkMeuser @StevePoizner @RealErinCruz @drwright4congr1 @RealOmarNavarro @frank_scotto Who are you voting fo CA Lt. Governor? Check out the candidate statements in your CA Voter Guide and consider voting @DavidFennell #MAGA

@R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @CAGOP @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA @BaileyForAG I always try to answer voter questions directly and honestly. I endorse &amp; I am voting for @TheRealJohnHCox and encourage everyone to do the same.
@R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @CAGOP @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA No. I have received no money from or any benefit from @TheRealJohnHCox . Also only campaign I contributed to is @BaileyForAG . I announced I was endorsing @TheRealJohnHCox because ‚ÄúWho are you voting for Governor?‚Äù was a question voters asked.
@R3Thorns @jpatton05 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Ok, keep me posted. Thanks! Dave
@R3Thorns @youlosenordys @Eliza_4_God @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen But who are voting for Lt. Gov?
@R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen @CAGOP @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA Awesome! Feel free to copy me. I have no idea where my opponents @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA stand on the Governor race. They refuse to do debates or interviews. I have been campaigning all over the state meeting voters. All @ColeHarrisCA does is annoying robocalls.
@jpatton05 @R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Who are you voting for Lt. Gov?
@youlosenordys @Eliza_4_God @R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Ok, but who are you voting for Lt. Gov? Please check out my statement in your voter guide and consider voting @DavidFennell .
@R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Other @CAGOP  Lt. candidates @ColeHarrisCA , @Dave4LA &amp; @LydiaOrtega4CA don‚Äôt have guts to tell you who they are voting for Governor. Even if you disagree with @DavidFennell for voting @TheRealJohnHCox you must agree I am the only candidate who lets voters know his vote. #MAGA
@julieagannon @R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Most people still haven‚Äôt voted. A lot will happen in next 2 weeks. Keep an eye on @DavidFennell
@Eliza_4_God @satanISALOSER @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen I moved to California when I was I year old and lived in California 4+ decades.  So for a real Californian who will fix Sacramento please vote @DavidFennell  #MAGA
@jpatton05 @rogerwright533 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Ok, but who are thinking of voting for CA Lt. Gov?
@R3Thorns @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Hi @R3Thorns just curious who are you planning to vote for Lt. Gov? I think I change your mind.
@PhilPQuincannon @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen I will have my team look into this important issue.
@PhilPQuincannon @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen So, I‚Äôm going to put you down as undecided. I hope I can earn your vote!
@Sumergirl84 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Well, checkout my voter guide statement. The CA Voter guide should have arrived in your mail recently. I think you will see @DavidFennell is the right Republican for CA Lt. Governor job. Thanks for taking time to chat! Got to run to my next campaign event. God Bless California!
@Sumergirl84 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen I agree! Let‚Äôs send Republicans to Sacramento &amp; fix California. #MAGA
@Sumergirl84 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen Thanks for the fair &amp; open minded response. I moved to California when I was 1 year old and have lived her for 4+ decades. Check out the Statewide Voter guide and look at the CA Lt. Governor statements. I think you will vote @DavidFennell . Let me know if you have any questions!
@Mitchboard99 @TheRealJohnHCox @JoinTravisAllen I am asking you to vote for @TheRealJohnHCox not @GavinNewsom

@OUNatChamps Thanks for the text. But, I am running for Lt. Governor of California &amp; you live in Oklahoma City (my aunt, uncle &amp; cousins live in your city).

When he announced his run my friends told me Trump reminded them of me. If Trump can use phrases like ‚ÄúLittle Rocket Man‚Äù and get North Korea to deal, why can‚Äôt I use my similar style to become Lt. Gov &amp; Make California Great Again?

Latest project is a vinyl record pressing operation. I want to do it in Oakland but I made a dozen recent trips to Reno &amp; have considered Nevada because of California taxes.

Governor should be cutting waste &amp; fraud.  We already have funds that should be going to infrastructure &amp; roads. Other states do so much more for a lot less. We just need new leadership.  I am for repealing the gas tax.

It is best fixed by getting a Republicans Governor to appoint better judges. It should be noted that statistics show more people are representing themselves in court &amp; more are winning without a lawyer. But there should equal protection under law

A friend of mine had extremely bad postpartum depression. She became a different person. There was a period of time where she should not have a firearm. But, after treatment she is now well. So had her 2a been restricted when ill a process should exist to get 2a back.

Gov I would focus on removing government waste &amp; fraud.  Much of the money we send to Sacramento for infrastructure goes to a bloated bureaucracy instead of roads. I believe if you cut waste &amp; fraud you will save money. I am against new taxes such as gas tax.

@Shastina_Eloff @ColeHarrisCA Look at @ColeHarrisCA Instagram account. All of his friends are liberals &amp; he talks about getting along &amp; uniting with Democrats. Does that sound Republican to you? When you send me to Sacramento I am going to hold the liberal politicians feet to the fire exposing their fraud.
@Shastina_Eloff Will do! We just shot a video that lays it all out. Being edited now. But, a fact you can confirm on your own is to open the voter guide you got in the mail. I have been a Republican 31 years since I was 18. You can see @ColeHarrisCA just registered Republican a few months ago.

Why @ColeHarrisCA ? He is a RINO who is against the border wall. If you pull his files you see he only recently registered Republican &amp; refuses to meet GOP groups. His Instagram posts &amp; friends are all liberal. Don‚Äôt be fooled. Consider voting @DavidFennell
@BennDoverr4me Voting for @ColeHarrisCA is a bad idea as he is a RINO against Trump‚Äôs border wall. Instead please consider voting @DavidFennell ! Let me know if you have any questions! Hope I can earn your vote! #MAGA
@CindyBurlison Hi @CindyBurlison ! If Trump supporter, I encourage you to instead vote @DavidFennell ! My opponent @ColeHarrisCA is a RINO who has stated he did not support Trump‚Äôs border wall. I campaigned for Trump at Iowa Caucuses &amp; support border wall. Hope I can earn your vote! #MAGA
@jmints1775 @ColeHarrisCA @jmints1775 you stated you are a Republican. Aren‚Äôt you offended that @ColeHarrisCA just sits at his computer &amp; refuses to meet with GOP groups. Don‚Äôt you think he should meet voters? Wouldn‚Äôt you agree Cole should agree to a debate or drop out of Lt. Gov race? What is he hiding?
@jmints1775 @ColeHarrisCA Action is more important than speech. Republicans don‚Äôt trust  @ColeHarrisCA because his actions are the opposite of a GOP candidate. He is refusing to debate or meet/take questions from GOP groups. His Instagram posts sound Democrat. He only recently registered GOP. He is a RINO
@jmints1775 @ColeHarrisCA I am curious @jmints1775 if your personal GOP check list is similar or different. Look forward to hearing your voter perspective!
@jmints1775 @ColeHarrisCA Hi @jmints1775 my own checklist would include 1) Secure the border 2) Oppose Sanctuary cities 3)Support Trump 4)Oppose taxes &amp; big gov 5)Defend religious freedom 6)Follow the U.S. Constitution including 2nd Amendment. Hope I answered your question! Feel free to ask more!  #MAGA

@VentureInvestor @ColeHarrisCA Real deal Cole Harris? LOL! Don‚Äôt be silly @VentureInvestor . Cole Harris is sitting at home playing Candy Crush while I am on campaign trail meeting farmers, truck drivers, businessmen... all over CA. RINO Cole should drop out the race so he can play with his video games. #MAGA
@ColeHarrisCA Hi Cole! I will take all 300 of your signed stickers. Could I have the one that says ‚ÄúCole Harris is a wus who is afraid to debate @DavidFennell ‚Äú Cole, I am speaking to rooms of 300 people &amp; taking their questions in person. A signed sticker? Are targeting 4 year old voters?LOL
@ColeHarrisCA @J_GallagherAD3 @CAGOP Been hitting medical marijuana a bit too hard? This May 11 tweet says you are looking forward to attending @CAGOP convention this weekend. @CAGOP convention ended May 6. Looking forward to a convention that ended 5 days earlier? Either put down the bong or get out of the race.

@ColeHarrisCA Yes, Cole only 3 weeks until election. Are you just going to spend 20 days sitting in your underwear doing social media or are you going to put on a tie &amp; go on the CA Campaign Trail. Why are you afraid to debate me? Stopping being such a little wimp! Your embarrassing the @CAGOP
@ColeHarrisCA Hi Jon Fleischmann! I noticed that at your @FlashReport site that you declared @ColeHarrisCA "FlashReport Winner Of The CAGOP Convention Award." You have been duped. Cole is lying about his background. Want to know the real Cole Harris? Send me a message. #DropOutRINOColeHarris
@ColeHarrisCA Cole, just curious. What does all the #JOINTHERESISTANCE responses below stand for? I searched for it on Twitter. Seems like a political movement in Manila. Is that where you got your $2M? Are you running for Lt. Governor of California or the Philippines?#DropOutRINOColeHarris
@ColeHarrisCA HI @Larkin8Larkin !  Don't be fooled by Cole Harris. I pulled his Secretary of State file &amp; he just registered Republican. RINO! He is refusing to do debates or attend any GOP events where he has to take questions. Consider voting @DavidFennell ! I hope I can earn your vote!
@ColeHarrisCA Office? Don't you mean your parents basement? Look dude you are embarrassing yourself. Nobody with half a brain is going to vote for a guy sitting around in his underwear hiding behind Facebook &amp; Instagram. Go to GOP event &amp; take real questions or drop out. #DropOutRINOColeHarris
@ColeHarrisCA I noticed you already posted about this meeting April 19. I guess you had to repost because you have done nothing since that date. I didn't attend because I was on campaign trail talking to GOP groups. Something you are too scared to do. You are a fraud. #DropOutRINOColeHarris
@ColeHarrisCA Your kidding me. Solving homeless problem with another sock give away? You are not a Republican. You refuse to debate @DavidFennell , you refuse to do interviews, you refuse to talk to Republicans. Start acting like a GOP candidate or get out of the race! #DropOutRINOColeHarris

@RedlandsTParty @JoinTravisAllen @MarkMeuser @PatriotNotPol @Kotyuk4Assembly @SeanFlynnCA @KimberlinBrown @BaileyForAG @AjaforCongress @JayObernolte @senatordutton What is the process to apply to be added to the @RedlandsTParty voter guide? I campaigned for Trump in the Iowa &amp; Nevada Caucuses &amp; believe I can bring a Trump style win to Primary. Currently on a 30day campaign tour across California. Do you have any events I could attend? #MAGA
@RedlandsTParty @JoinTravisAllen @MarkMeuser @PatriotNotPol @Kotyuk4Assembly @SeanFlynnCA @KimberlinBrown @BaileyForAG @AjaforCongress @JayObernolte @senatordutton Hi @RedlandsTParty ! Great to attend your Governor Debate.  Any chance you could hold a Lt. Governor debate before primary. Trying to get my opponents @ColeHarrisCA @LydiaOrtega4CA @Dave4LA to either debate or get out of race. I seem to be only Lt. Gov candidate on campaign trail
@Godwillprovide @JoinTravisAllen @AllenVolunteers @CAGOP @RPSDC @sheratonsd Also @Godwillprovide look in California Voter Guide you received in the mail. You will only see 2 GOP candidates with voter guide statements @DavidFennell &amp; @LydiaOrtega4CA . Lydia is a RINO who only registered GOP in Nov 2017. I have been registered Republican 31 years. #MAGA
@Godwillprovide @JoinTravisAllen @AllenVolunteers @CAGOP @RPSDC @sheratonsd Hi @Godwillprovide ! Sorry it took so long to respond. I am on a 30day campaign tour barnstorming across California. I campaigned for Trump in the Iowa Caucuses &amp; believe I can bring a MAGA win to CA. People are frustrated &amp; Democrat opposition is weak. Hope I can earn your vote!
@MelodyDeckert @DTrumplican @9975Ts @jsgrippen @CaliConsrvative @BaileyForAG @RealErinCruz @Bradley4Senate @MarkMeuser @DavidFennel @AntonioSabatoJr @RealOmarNavarro @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I think we can bring a surprise Trump style win to California in June Primary. I am currently on a 30 day campaign tour across California and people are fed up &amp; Democrat opposition is inexperienced, fractured &amp; weak! #MAGA
@jsgrippen Hi @jsgrippen ! Thanks for message! I just finished spending days touring the Mexico border from the Pacific Ocean to Calexico to the Arizona Colorado River border. Met great border agents &amp; also witnessed people crossing through holes in the fence. I support Trump‚Äôs Wall.  #MAGA
@alohalalaluluhu @jensen4law Hi alohaj!  I hope you would consider removing @Dave4LA and adding @DavidFennell . I have met David Hernandez several times &amp; we share the same views and he is a really nice guy. But he is 20 years old than me &amp; he runs &amp; loses badly every year. I can win!   We need to win! #MAGA
@ColeHarrisCA @DTrumplican @jensen4law @LydiaOrtega4CA @realDonaldTrump So @ColeHarrisCA it has been 4 days since I responded your lol @DavidFennell lol comment by challenging you to a debate. After that challenge I have only heard crickets. Cole, I think you are a fraud. Be a man and debate or get out of the race. #MAGA
@alohalalaluluhu @Redbaylie Also @Dave4LA is a nice grandfatherly kind of guy we share same views. But he runs and loses every year. I am 20 years younger &amp; he cannot relate to younger voters &amp; does not seem to have the energy to go on the campaign trail &amp; did not bother to put a statement in voter guide.
@alohalalaluluhu @Redbaylie I am for the border wall &amp; campaigned for Trump at Iowa &amp; Nevada caucuses. Cole Harris is a RINO who refuses to debate, give interviews or campaign. I am currently on a 30 day campaign tour barnstorming across CA doing 3+ news interviews a day. Hope I can earn you vote! #MAGA
@cc_candycane Also @cc_candycane you are right the @SacPressClub debate was fake news. I attended &amp; asked to participate but I was told only @LydiaOrtega4CA was allowed to speak. Lydia is a RINO who only registered GOP in Nov 2017. I guess @SacPressClub can‚Äôt handle real Republicans. #MAGA
@cc_candycane Yes, I agree! So @ColeHarrisCA @Dave4LA @LydiaOrtega4CA when do you do a GOP debate? Let‚Äôs do 2. One North. One South. I suggest we hold it at one of  our CA alma maters. My degrees are from @SantaClaraUniv &amp; @usfca . Does anyone know where my opponents degrees are from?
@Cal4Trump @DTrumplican @KCnLA @JoinTravisAllen @GavinNewsom @BaileyForAG @ColeHarrisCA @drwright4congr1 @Dave4LA @MarkMeuser @RealErinCruz Hi @Cal4Trump sorry about delayed response. I am spending the last 30 days before the election barnstorming across California doing 3+ interviews a day. Yes, SoCal GOP knows @Dave4LA he runs &amp; loses every year. We share the same views but I am 20 years younger and can win! #MAGA
@CapitolChris @EleniForCA @GayleforCA @dredhernandez @ColeHarrisCA @gharabiklou @JeffBleichCA We don‚Äôt always agree @CapitolChris but I agree with you on this tweet. From what I read @EleniForCA would be nothing without her $500M developer dad giving campaign donations. Apparently a $500k donation from your dad buys you an Ambassador position in Hungary. #MAGA
@ColeHarrisCA @joegarofoli So @joegarofoli I see you liked the tweet from @ColeHarrisCA .  You are with the San Francisco Chronicle right? When are you going to print your story about your chat with @ColeHarrisCA . I think he is a fraud who is hiding something.
@CapitolChris @ColeHarrisCA @joegarofoli Hi @CapitolChris ! Colorful language as usual. My simple point was I am spending 30 days on campaign trail doing interviews at newspapers across California.  Why isn‚Äôt @ColeHarrisCA campaigning, why no debate, why no American interviews? Nobody knows who @ColeHarrisCA really is.
@ColeHarrisCA @joegarofoli Actually Cole it does matter. Our President was elected with a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù campaign. No real Republican would pander to overseas Chinese or Korean media but not meet &amp; take questions from Californians. @joegarofoli when are you printing the @ColeHarrisCA interview?
@Hauwertsr @LydiaOrtega4CA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hi @Hauwertsr !  Thanks for the questions! 1) I unequivocally support the 2nd Amendment 2) Huge Trump supporter! I campaigned for him at Iowa &amp; Nevada Caucuses. Met Trump at @JohnDukeWayne 's birthplace. 3) Just finished a border tour. Support WALL. My opponents are RINOs. #MAGA
@ColeHarrisCA @CAGOP Don't be ridiculous. I was sitting right in front of you. Yes @ColeHarrisCA I saw you read a speech that clearly someone else wrote. You are a swell RINO puppet for crony RINO donors. But, you took no questions. CA Republicans deserves better. When do you want to debate? #MAGA
@ColeHarrisCA @ColeHarrisCA is there a reason you are only giving interviews &amp; speeches to overseas Asian news outlets &amp; not with California journalists? Are you running for be Lt. Governor of California or Korea?
@ColeHarrisCA @DTrumplican @jensen4law @LydiaOrtega4CA @realDonaldTrump Hi @ColeHarrisCA welcome to the Lt. Governor race. I am currently campaigning in Blythe, CA. When &amp; where do you want to do our first Lt. Governor debate?
@DTrumplican @jensen4law @LydiaOrtega4CA @realDonaldTrump Hi Jensen! Hope I can earn your vote! I am a lifelong Republican &amp; Eagle Scout who supports the border wall. I spent 2 weeks campaigning for Trump at Iowa Caucuses and first met future President at John Wayne‚Äôs birthplace. @ColeHarrisCA  &amp; @LydiaOrtega4CA are RINOs #MAGA üá∫üá∏
