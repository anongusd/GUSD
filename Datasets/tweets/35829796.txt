We‚Äôve also passed laws to support our Coast Guard and maritime transportation system, improve pipeline safety, and make communities better prepared to withstand disasters.
Additionally, we signed into law legislation to invest in our airports and aviation system. With these several laws alone, we‚Äôve invested over $380 billion in our infrastructure.
When it comes to #infrastructure, Congress has a good track record.  In recent years, we passed a major long-term transportation bill to improve roads, bridges, rails, &amp; public transit; multiple bills to enhance US ports &amp; inland waterways.
