Reflection Monday: The last 2 weeks have been rough on @RazorbackFB fans. However, life could be a lot worse. You could have lost everything including life in a hurricane (NC/SC),or in a Typhoon(Japan),or lost a life too soon (Parkers Chapel HS). #itsjustagame #iwasmadtoo #WPS
@scottclayton13 @TheSSCollins In spirit!
@curleywolf40 @MandyMeador Oh, the 2019 kids are difference makers. You hope they see where they can make the changes. I’m sure some will fall off, but I think the coaches can keep the majority. Or I hope they can. Just need about 5 OL!
@curleywolf40 @MandyMeador It’s the 80/20 rule though.20% bark loudly at the right time and it seems worse than it really is.The culture of losing is a real thing,&amp;the roster needs an undertaking of depth,speed and talent. I hope these 2019 kids truly are in it to play early &amp; have the relationship locked.

@ItsMikeHill @Giants @OBJ_3 I agree. I love the guy, and think he is in an elite group with Brown &amp; Jones at WR. I also know that the NFL is a business. So 3 2nd RD picks is A LOT in this deep draft. You also have a team like Buffalo that have 2 1st &amp; 2 2nd picks and need a #1 WR. He &amp; McCoy could be nice.

@ChrisKane007 probably the biggest issue on Def is the on-ball switch when a screen comes. These combo frwds are not Coty Clark. They cannot move laterally, quickly enough to keep up w/guards,&amp; don’t have fast enough hands to make the drive difficult. It is a blow by every time.
@sully7777 Won’t win many games with Trey leads the way at half.
@sully7777 Bc we have our post players shooting long jump shots. Macon and Barford are not getting themselves free.
@ChrisKane007 No one on this team outside of Macon, Barford, Beard, Jones, and (maybe) Hall should take a shot outside of 5ft.

@Dedsports How does Hall disappear on the bench in the 2nd half? That blows my mind. He was a huge key to the 1st half.
@Dedsports It is what our guards do. Shoot contested long jumpers instead of dumping it to Gafford.
Where is Hall in the 2nd half? Out coaching himself tonight.
@Dedsports This has been a common theme along with no offensive help from the bench over the last 3 Ls.
Have to get more than 6 points from the bench if they plan on winning. Jones and Bailey have to start scoring.
@RedZone921 When you start 3 undersized 2Gs, and a combo F at the 4 you are going to have major issues with teams with a true PG and length. Plus the drop off from Gafford at the 5 is a lot more glaring than most thought it would be. When he leaves the floor, you can feel the shift.

@djhurst6317 Got air balls flying and dumb fouls on the other end to add salt to the this open wound...I have an idea...put Gafford in and run a play for him...🤔
@TylerDavis93 They haven’t given it to Gafford 1 time yet. This is crazy.
MA needs to start coaching and stop letting these long contested jumpers fly around. Gafford hasn’t touched the ball in an offensive set 1 time yet! Plus we look out of position all over the place on defense.
@ChrisKane007 One thing is fore sure. Every team in the country is saying all offseason...”If UCF can do it...” Lots of hope being thrown around! If nothing else, it was fun to watch for a sports fan on the outside looking in!
@ChrisKane007 It’s the best troll I’ve ever seen. Just not sure you are going to catch the same lightening in a bottle next season. That is what sucks about the situation. This team &amp; coaches, yes...next year..🤷🏻‍♂️

@HallyBeezy @ASTATEfaninDC I agree. I support both. Yes, one more than the other, but have supported the Razorbacks for almost 30 years. I honestly knew nothing about AState until I went to visit my Sr year of HS. I also picked AState over the UofA for a reason for my academic choice.
@HallyBeezy @ASTATEfaninDC @Shadid13 He is pretty smart. I wish he would start college already and save us some money! Maybe I could retire early!

@barnhill_jerrod @RJHawk That is exactly my argument or case I made for “what should have happened”. Line them up and clock starts on the whistle.  No subs or change in formation.
@barnhill_jerrod @RJHawk Still a 15 yrd Flag is huge in that spot. No matter the time. In HS ball it seems like yardage is more important than time due to the inconsistency of clock operations.
@RJHawk They didn’t “have to” penalize them. They can make judgement calls. Tough spot for any ref to be in. Just think it could have been handled better. That is easy to say from the outside looking in though.
@RJHawk You can’t have the teams lineup and start the clock on the whistle? Not giving teams time to substitute.Just pointing out the players did nothing to deserve any penalty. At some point the refs have to make call that doesn’t hurt either side in this case.
@RJHawk They didn’t have to penalize the kids for an adults mistake and ignorance. Remove the fan, and let the kids decide it. It would have been different if it was a player or coach. They cannot control the crowd. That is on security!

@cridings1 @Gragg80 When you are fighting uphill every year vs A&amp;M, Bama, AU, UGA, LSU, Tenn &amp; FL when it comes to recruiting and national pub, yeah why not? We can be better, Bobby P and Nutt proved it possible.
@cridings1 @Gragg80 I didn’t complain we overpaid CBB. He was paid what the market said he was worth. He just didn’t get the Ws needed to stay. He checked ALL other boxes though.
@cridings1 @Gragg80 Ok, to pay Norvell or Morris $2.5-3max and get less exposure and worse recruiting ability.
@cridings1 @Gragg80 Honestly outside of a handful of coaches you aren’t going to get a “great” coach at Arkansas. We are an average team in a top P5 conf. We need to hire someone that has a great offense and can catch lightening in a bottle every 4th-5th season. All other seasons land between 6-8 Ws
@cridings1 @Gragg80 He has an offense that works. He is a solid recruiter. He has a family history with the Hogs. He is hilarious on twitter and press conferences. He has a passion to beat Bama! These are all solid reasons in my book...😆
@cridings1 @Gragg80 Sometimes coaches need time to figure it out. I think he did that at Bama. I could make the same “he did nothing” argument for a lot of really great coaches following the first stop or 2 of that coaches career.

@643Kid @ClayTravis Can’t get down with a Miami team that lost to Pitt. Sorry, but that is worse than the Cuse L by Clemson. Especially considering the time of year.
@ClayTravis If everything is chalk...Wisky, Clemson, OU, UGA/UA winner? ...only way Bama gets in is with a L by Wisky, Clemson, or OU?
@DanWolken How you came up with that conclusion is beyond my intelligence I guess.  I am simply saying that if you have a resume of 1-L teams that L should be one of the main factors in who is in. Correct?
@DanWolken Clemson lost to an avg at best Cuse team, OU lost at home to a good ISU, and Bama lost on the road at #6 AU (that already thumped UGA then #1). 🤔...seems like an easy side-by-side!

@curleywolf40 I agree on liking him &amp; the type of clean program he runs.The hires are what is killing him. A lot of assistant to the Assistants on staff.
@curleywolf40 Also, this an interim coach with the backup QB, and a team under investigation. No excuses for us playing with backups.
@curleywolf40 I am with you. This is a time to swallow pride and step away for the betterment of the program. The staff is not cutting it on any level.

@_Nick5000 he has a nice game. Old school 90s Pg IMO. No matter, 2016 is Monk or bust with a Mitchell/Davis icing on the cake class!
@_Nick5000 so just undersized at 6'7? Face up 4s translate in MA's offense. I like the game of Fisher from Memphis too. Jason Kidd like.

@_Nick5000 both of course. Seriously we are in bad shape at the guard spot. Love Kikko but he is playing key minutes and is a walk-on.

@_Nick5000 also the "team" plays better when BJ &amp; MP are on the court at different times. One main guy &amp; all others get in the flow quicker
@_Nick5000 the 3 forward lineup made the difference. I have been screaming for this all year. We will be Ben deeper for it next season.

@_Nick5000 Pat Bev for scoring, Beck for leadership on the court and toughness, or Day for a 6'9 guy that can fill it up #buckets
@_Nick5000 I agree on most of all you say sir. I still would like to see a stretch wing and a true PG.
@_Nick5000 even the 2004 UAB team had crazy length. 13 guys 6'4 or taller. And two solid PGs Finley and Squeaky Johnson
@_Nick5000 2009 Mizzu Bowers, Carroll, Ramsey, Lyons, &amp; Lawrence (bigs), Denmon, Taylor, Tiller, and MA Jr
@_Nick5000 Mizzu 2010 Bowers &amp; Ramsey (bigs), English &amp; Denmon (wings), Dixon (pg)
@_Nick5000 Mizzu last year had Ratliffe &amp; Bowers(bigs), English &amp; Brown(wings),&amp; Pressey, Dixon, and Denmon as PG/SG. That is all 3 sir!
@_Nick5000 I want to dance not just make the show! Bobby &amp; Moses are a start, but we need a knockdown 3pt shooter &amp; and true pg!
@_Nick5000 we will win with length, 3pt shooting, and pg play. That is how this system wins. Look at MA &amp; NR past good teams. They have that
@_Nick5000 @dan_storrs they all have top 10 coaches too! And have 5star Blue Chips year in and out. Don't get that part twisted.
@_Nick5000 @dan_storrs '94 we had 4 key wings over 6'4 &amp; 5 key bigs 6'7 or taller. That was almost 20yrs ago. Kids are BIGGER now. No excuse
@_Nick5000 @dan_storrs btw if Ole Miss can do it, why can't we? Much better facilities. A faster style of play, fast def.
@_Nick5000 @dan_storrs it's not too much. Just stop recruiting 6'2 Combo Guards.Get a true point and 2 shooters that are of normal D1 Height

@elliot_jacobs @rregsmith btw if ND loses to USC, we could and prob would see Bama/UGA vs FL/FSU winner in the NC game!
@RealSkipBayless go to bed skip. A&amp;M couldn't beat FL or LSU.

Would Coach Shaw leave Stanford for $4-5M to come to AR? It's not pretty but he wins games with 3TEs, a hard nosed QB, and a Stud RB! #HOGS
Wow, are the #Pac12 Refs about to pull a SEC job on Stanford? #swallowthewhistle
