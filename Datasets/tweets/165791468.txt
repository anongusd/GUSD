The #Secure2100 act pays for all benefit increases while restoring Social Security to long-range balance. This ensures every penny of promised Social Security benefits can be paid in full and on time through the 21st century and beyond, just as they always have been paid. (6/6)
The #Secure2100 Act increases benefits for all current and future beneficiaries; raises the minimum benefit, and switches to a more accurate cost of living adjustment, the CPI-E, so that Social Security’s modest benefits do not erode over time. (5/6) https://t.co/ujzprTrLIN

Trump has proposed policies that would cut immigration in half. If he gets his way, Social Security would lose $2.4 trillion over the next 75 years. 		If we go the opposite route and double immigration, Social Security would gain around $5 trillion.
Because immigrants are younger on average, they will be paying into Social Security for decades to come. That makes protecting and expanding benefits far more affordable.

#9: The Trump administration announced plans to get rid of a rule that allowed nursing home residents and their families the right to take those facilities to court for alleged neglect, abuse or sexual assault. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR
#8:  Trump issued an executive order politicizing the  Administrative Law Judges who determine eligibility for Social Security disability benefits. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR
#7: The Trump administration floated a proposal to eliminate the payroll tax, which would have served as a Trojan horse to undermine Social Security. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR
#6: Nearly every House Republican voted for a so-called “Balanced Budget Amendment,” which would have made it unconstitutional for Social Security to use its own $2.9 trillion trust fund to pay promised benefits. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR
5. Republicans passed a massive tax giveaway to billionaires and corporations, which they are now using as an excuse to demand cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR

#3: "Trumpcare" would have taken health care away from tens of millions of Americans, destroyed Medicaid, and created a Medicare time bomb. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR
#2: Trump nominated Tom "We will not rest until we make certain that government-run health care is ended” Price to be his Health Secretary. https://t.co/cqIlJQyRNR

Myth #5: Social Security has grown much larger than the founders intended.		The truth: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the system's other founders had a bold, expansive vision of Social Security - including guaranteed health care for all. https://t.co/F3bKyfCCl3
Myth #4: Social Security is out of date and no longer works for the 21st century.		The truth: Just as in the 1930s, people today are dependent on wages to purchase the necessities of life. Social Security’s time-tested wage insurance is more important than ever. https://t.co/F3bKyfCCl3
Myth #3: Social Security was intended to be simply part of a “three-legged stool" of retirement income.		The truth: The founders of Social Security intended for benefits to ultimately be expanded to provide a full retirement income. It's time to realize their vision. https://t.co/F3bKyfCCl3
Myth #2: Social Security is a safety net, or "welfare."		The truth: Social Security is insurance that we have earned. https://t.co/F3bKyfCCl3
Myth #1: Social Security is unaffordable.		The truth: Whether to expand or cut Social Security is a question of values, not affordability. At the end of the 21st century, Social Security will only slightly over 1% more of GDP than it spends today. https://t.co/F3bKyfCCl3
