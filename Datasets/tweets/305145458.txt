We believe that the Senate will say yes to fairness, yes to competitiveness and yes to protecting and creating American jobs by modernizing the sugar program.
...taxpayer watchdog organizations, responsible government advocates, think tanks and other organizations still believe American small businesses deserve a fair sugar policy that works for everyone in the supply chain – from farm to the retail shelf.
We are committed to continuing this fight. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle and a broad-based group of small, family-owned businesses and manufacturers, retailers, food and beverage companies, trade associations, environmental advocates,...
We thank Representative Foxx for her leadership on this issue, as well as the many champions of modernization who spoke up on the floor today, including Representatives Kind, Goodlatte, Blumenauer, Speier, Sanford and Perry.
The vote also does not reflect the groundswell of support among Republicans and Democrats who believe in the need to reform the program for the benefit of the American people and U.S. businesses.
This vote does not reflect the thousands of small businesses, newspaper editorial boards and taxpayer watchdog, consumer protection and environmental groups that have called on Congress to modernize the sugar program.
Unfortunately, the vote count on the Foxx amendment reflects politics as usual in Washington – from backroom deals to bitter partisanship on major pieces of legislation.
Our statement on this evening’s vote: It is disappointing that some members of Congress fell for the misinformation, scare tactics and highly charged, exaggerated rhetoric floated by the handful of sugar mega-processors that benefit from the complicated and messy sugar program.
What does an economist say about the #FairSugarPolicy amendment to the #2018FarmBill? Find out here: https://t.co/Avs2j7ZEfF
@RepVirginiaFoxx "the current sugar program is a job killer" #2018FarmBill #FairSugarProgram
@RepSpeier on why we need #FairSugarPolicy: to "create fairness for more than 600,000 manufacturing workers across the country"
@RepScottPerry on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in the #2018FarmBill: this is an "anti-free market scheme that imposes a massive hidden tax on consumers and businesses."
FACT: The existing sugar program is the outlier in commodity crop programs. Every other program has gone through reform. Why we need #FairSugarPolicy.
@repblumenauer on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in the #2018FarmBill:  "the sugar program forces manufacturers to pay far more than they need [for sugar]"
FACT: The sugar program doesn't cost us "zero" it costs us billions in hidden taxes and hundreds of millions in bailouts for mega processors. #FairSugarPolicy #2018FarmBill
@RepGoodlatte on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in the #2018FarmBill: "The sugar program represents a hidden tax."
FACT: ONLY 13 mega sugar processors benefit from the sugar program - while everyone else pays $4 billion in higher prices. #FairSugarPolicy #2018FarmBill
@RepHensarling on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in #2018FarmBill: the existing sugar program "would make a Soviet commissar blush."
FACT: The Foxx-Davis amendment does not lift the restrictions on imports. Rather, it lifts burdensome government restrictions on how much sugar can be grown right here in the United State. #FairSugarReform #2018FarmBill
@RepRonKind on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in the #2018FarmBill: "It has distorted the market price for too long. According to one estimate it has drive up consumer prices by $4 billion a year."
@virginiafoxx on why we need #FairSugarPolicy in the #2018FarmBill. "It is decidedly bad policy."
