@meredithllee Americans realizing the magnitude and lengths gone to to retain control and power over them, will revolt in unprecedented ways. These coming events could lead us all to a revolution that might just break our country into pieces.

@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff William I respect your right to view and feel these things we discuss however you see fit. I don‚Äôt pretend to fully understand you and your beliefs. I hope you at least do the same in return and don‚Äôt see me or others like me as any less human than you see you and yours.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I don‚Äôt own a phone. This iPad is the only thing I use to access information I‚Äôm curious about.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I literally haven‚Äôt watched any TV in five years.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Migrant farmers work on visas, they aren‚Äôt illegals. I know there are a vast amount of them, god bless em. My problem is with the illegals.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I‚Äôm not a racist and I hate having to say that. I took exception with you thinking I don‚Äôt respect laws. My views towards illegals stem from my respect for the law. I know laws are the glue that keeps civilization civil. I hope you can at least understand this.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Yes, I remember most everything you referenced. I also remember each and every time is was in reference to an illegal.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I think there is a distinction that isn‚Äôt made when talking about immigration. Illegals are not immigrants in my view. That‚Äôs just how I feel. I know others feel different.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Well William I‚Äôm not the guy who will defend every Trump statement or action as I explained before. I do encourage you to look into these thing you take offense with for yourself and not take the MSM at their word and not having agendas.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I know what you‚Äôre referencing. He certainly did not single out your brother in law. It was a reference to illegals. I‚Äôm second generation myself.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I think any disagreement you and I may have may stem from the unknowns. None of us know who is telling us the truth. We pick a news story, a sound bite etc.. and cling to it with abandoned. As an absolute.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff That‚Äôs not a fair assumption. In fact, it is not even logical to me. We are all unique in our own ways. That‚Äôs a good thing, and to lump everyone together under one stereotype is not fair to anyone.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff It‚Äôs the it has always been. No one person 100% agrees with politicians. You, at least I, pick one who best represents your interests, and play the percentage.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Just returning the gesture. I‚Äôm 47, white, married, Deep South.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff If this helps, I have my personal views and beliefs. Some of them are similar to Trump‚Äôs. More so than to Hillary. That being the case, it has been in my interest to support him. It‚Äôs a logical action to take. It doesn‚Äôt mean I 100% agree blindly with him.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Well, shit William you and I are exactly the same.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Would it be safe to say that neither one of us can really assume anything about the other? Certainly not by one aspect or action plucked from a lifetime of experiences. Or, to say no one person is defined by a single action or belief.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff How old are you William? Just so I don‚Äôt assume anything during this conversation.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Right, but you were in the middle of explaining to me why I am lawless and criminal....
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff You will, they all do. Maybe your different who knows?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff So, he cheated? He won under criminal pretenses,and I as a supporter of Trump, am also prone to criminal thoughts, behaviors etc... Am I keeping up?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Side note here. 		At what point do you block me?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Would you say his ineptness helped him win an election for the highest democraticly elected office in the world? Or something else?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff So, you assume I support Trump. I do. You feel Trump disregards law ergo, I also have no regard for laws. Correct?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I knew you could do it. We had bets. I won. Thanks.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff You obviously are threatened by something you, warranted or not, detect from me. However, I have no idea what that is, nor does it concern me. Try projecting your insecurities on something else. Trump seems to suffice many liberals.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff You may be inserting your insecurities into my statements. I have no idea what you consider, from what I‚Äôve said, that implies I have no regard for laws.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Do you have a problem with being direct? What are you talking about?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Who said I hate the laws? Where is that implied? What the hell are you talking about?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Maybe you should run for office. Sounds like you have all the answers.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff You done?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Can you feed yourself mister? How bout shelter? Can you build you and yours a place to live? Do you have the skills it takes to survive? I ask, because you may need em sooner than you think. I‚Äôd get busy learning if I were you. Your priorities may be askew.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff That‚Äôs about what I would expect from you. Good day.
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff Does that clear things up for you?
@teamikoiko @ScottLanghoff I‚Äôm not saying either is better. What I‚Äôm sarcastically trying to point out is Maher passes judgement on people he doesn‚Äôt know or understand. People he considers beneath his enlightened cockbreath ass.

@anirvan I don‚Äôt agree with hanging on to traditions and cultures from other countries. It‚Äôs those very things that keep Americans divided. If you have one foot here and the other somewhere else, you aren‚Äôt embracing the USA. We all are unique. At the same time, we are all the same.
@anirvan I don‚Äôt know how other immigrant families grew up. I was never encouraged to learn German. Probably because it had only been 25 years since WW2. My grandma and great grandma spoke German to each other, but never to the kids. I never felt hyphenated.
@chadmom2 @anirvan What I assume you don‚Äôt understand or don‚Äôt want to understand, is illegal immigrants are criminals from day one. We are a nation of laws. We agree to follow these laws and be civil. This doesn‚Äôt work if your first day here you commit a crime and it goes unpunished.

@V_of_Europe The Vatican is insignificant. It‚Äôs practices have become even more evil. I‚Äôm not against Christians or the religion, morals and values are virtuous. The pope however, is but another puppet master with an evil agenda. Christianity can survive this only if it replaces the Vatican.
@MorganStanley Teach your children to barter and trade. Circumvent the Federal Reserve fiat currency. It has no true value.
@AmyMek There is but one outcome sadly. Many, many people will die. 		There will be a power grab at the end of this. This will clearly identify those behind this well planned extermination. Hope Trump is still in office when it happens. Putin will be an ally in the end.
@AmyMek Europeans are rendered powerless to curtail the theft of their country and culture. 	 This is not accidental. Obama and his actions in Syria displaced millions. Opened the gates to the north. Unchecked migration. 	 Europeans have a tipping point. It‚Äôs in sight....
@AmyMek This truly shows the insanity plaguing Europe. EU is the number one, well established enemy of the people. This is not disputable. 	 Forced immigration of a culture that wants to kill their host. EU forces citizens to accept it. Paralyzed by the leaders and leftist propaganda...
@AmyMek Want to know how it ends?	Current conditions breed Hitler type leader, elected or not. This leader takes muslim extreme behavior and gives it back ten fold. Elites grin, all going to plan. 	 After dispensing immigrants, this leader goes after Elites. 		Elites get their just due.

@HaggertyTaupier @RedState You can‚Äôt fault the school. They followed the law. You can‚Äôt fault the AG. He was enforcing state law. The child and parents did not follow Texas state law.
@HaggertyTaupier @RedState This is/was Texas law to participate in the pledge. So should the school not follow Texas law? Should the AG not have pursued the very thing he is subscribed to do?
@HaggertyTaupier @RedState The AG would not have been involved if the child and parents followed the same rules as the rest of the students. Regardless of the law. Her freedom of speech was not hindered, ironically it was her lack of it. 	So, according to you, every student who ever recited it has a case?
