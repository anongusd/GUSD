The ‚Äúmalpractice‚Äù isn‚Äôt GOP‚Äôs campaign strategy. It‚Äôs their governing style.		Imagine if they had a serious healthcare plan or gave more tax cuts to middle class.

Tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods might seem abstract to many Americans. 		So try this. Look around your house (especially in the closet) and think about everything made in China. Now add 10% or 25% to the price. What would you call that?		That‚Äôs right: a tax increase.

@luvingocnj Yes, they are definitely lies.
For most Americans, the economy isn‚Äôt GDP data. It‚Äôs living paycheck to paycheck and coping with rising costs. When GOP touts tax cuts, it just reminds people how the windfalls went to the rich.
