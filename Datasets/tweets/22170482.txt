"Nothing in this bill touches abortion. This is about protecting a baby that has already been born alive." @SenSasse
"Let's pass this. Let's protect living children." @SenatorLankford #BornAliveAct #BornAlive
"The plain text of this bill couldn't be more clear. This bill is about what happens when an abortion is botched and there is a live baby on the table, ten fingers, ten toes, pink skinned." @SenatorLankford
Once the baby is born alive (from a botched abortion) it is no longer a "women's choice" issue. #BornAliveAct #BornAlive

@JRoseRN @ShannonOMac @NRLC exists to try to protect the lives of the unborn child.  Our very existence is to help women make an informed decision.  There are two people involved in every abortion...one woman, one unborn child. #ProLife

@ShannonOMac Ticked off much Shannon?  Abortion is not health care.  In true health care, you don't kill a patient.  The baby, as you should know if you are an MD, is a separate person living inside the womb for a very brief time.  Shame on you.

So, Senator Feinstein multiples the Guttmacher estimates by factors of 667 to 6,000.
This is a gross fabrication: Guttmacher, connected to #PlannedParenthood, has said: "The death toll had declined...to just over 300 by 1950...By 1965, the number of deaths due to illegal abortion had fallen to just under 200" (Rachel Benson Gold, Guttmacher Policy Review, 2003)
In questioning #JudgeKavanaugh, @SenFeinstein made an incredible claim: "In the 1950s and '60s, the two decades before Roe [v . Wade], deaths from illegal abortions in this country ran between 200,000 and 1.2 million. That's according to the Guttmacher Institute."
