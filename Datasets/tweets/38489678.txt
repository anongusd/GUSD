Based on current information, high-flow oxygen therapy should not be considered a preferred therapy for immunosuppressed patients with AHRF, and additional studies including assessment of other technologies to avoid invasive ventilation are clearly needed https://t.co/A8zQXgqaBj https://t.co/oNwpmWIL3f
Among patients receiving mechanical ventilation in ICUs w moderate to high ABX resistance prevalence, use of CHX mouthwash, SOD, or SDD was not associated w reductions in ICU-acquired bloodstream infections caused by MDRGNB vs standard care https://t.co/nFtJPeL4v2 #VisualAbstract https://t.co/wFhkLC3b9f
The principle behind SDD is that by reducing the numbers of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the gut, many ICU-acquired infections can be prevented. Initial trials showed a reduction in infections but failed to demonstrate an effect on mortality. https://t.co/mw242YKhtv https://t.co/PFqIWN8dqf
