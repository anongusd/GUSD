@equalityfl If candidates had a ‚ÄúD‚Äù or ‚ÄúR‚Äù next to their names, then low info voters might have a chance. But local Dems love this fucked up system because It gives them cover. And most of them fucking worship cops.		Our Dem Mayor just endorsed a GOP horror in a non-partisan council race.
@equalityfl So our choice in a very Democratic city will be between 2 Republicans. This is a non-partisan race, so orgs like @equalityfl can safely endorse a Republican like the racist cop Jane Castor who is still defending her stop and frisk policy.		https://t.co/opohnUm0lk
@equalityfl We‚Äôre prolly gonna end up w a runoff between the billionaire fool and the racist cop who happens to be gay. I blame mainstream orgs like @equalityfl for reflexively endorsing a very flawed candidate whose racist policies did real harm to powerless people.
Very mad at @equalityfl for endorsing one of the 2 Republicans running in Tampa‚Äôs non-partisan race for mayor. This is stupid. Endorsing a racist cop is not a good long term strategy even if the racist cop happens to be gay. Sucking up to fascists never works.

@FedEx And, of course, @FedEx treats its drivers like shit, classifying them as independent contractors and making them buy and maintain their own FedEx trucks.		Only use FedEx when you have no other choice. Support union workers by using @UPS and @USPS.
Anyway, this is how @FedEx treats you when you make a complaint. I‚Äôm not surprised that a FedEx manager called a member of my household a liar and threatened to withhold services. That‚Äôs how they roll.
This fucking @FedEx manager accused me of fraud and theft - he assured me that his driver was delivering packages to my house and that I was receiving them and reporting them missing. He had the cops with him to‚Ä¶ fucking arrest me? Intimidate me?
Nothing helped. Packages would always go to the wrong house a couple miles away. After about a solid month of this bullshit, I called to complain about another missing package, and about 20 minutes later @FedEx local manager showed up at my door. With the fucking cops.
I was running a small business on tight deadlines. I needed those packages when they were supposed to arrive. I started complaining. I kept complaining. I finally figured out what was happening and I told @FedEx what their mistake was.
A house on the Avenue shared my house number, and one day @FedEx decided to start delivering every single one of my packages to this other house. The packages tracked as ‚ÄúDelivered‚Äù but would not actually show up at MY house until 2-3 days later.
True @FedEx story: 		Back when I ran a small computer shop building LANS and PCs and such I was getting TONS of packages delivered. I ran my business from my house and I lived on a Street with the same name as a nearby Avenue.
@FedExHelp Talk to ‚ÄúAustin‚Äù in your office. He‚Äôs got the info from @qotfw100. 		I will make sure that the merchants who I regularly do business with who only ship FedEX know why I am no longer shopping with them.
RT @bfnewsunion: We are:		‚ö™Ô∏è¬†single		‚ö™Ô∏è taken		üîò organizing BuzzFeed News to secure protections for ourselves
@FedExHelp You‚Äôve got the boss‚Äô phone number. Call him and tell him that my packages better keep coming to my house. I don‚Äôt respond well to threats, and we did nothing wrong. Done with you now. You‚Äôve already stolen too much of my time. Your manager‚Äôs phone is 813 505-9919.

JF - @FedEx driver secretly hid a package in my backyard where it sat unnoticed for a week out in the weather and we complained and some FedEx boss stalked by the house unannounced and left his number - 813 505-9919 - and when my GF called him back to discuss the situation...
