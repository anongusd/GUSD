@brentmcmurray I'm citing the PDF that the NYT published. And I may have been unclear: I never claimed the dossier is bogus, just that it was among 40 pieces of evidence in the FISA applications. In it, it is made clear this was a research document prepared by one candidate to hurt a rival.

@Ar_Chroi Apologies. It looks like FISA warrants on Mr. Page go back to 2013. https://t.co/YMgfisiKbA
@Ar_Chroi 1.) That we know of.	2.) A lack of indictment is not the same as being cleared.	3.) So far, you are correct. This can change. After all, as Marco Rubio put it "there was a lot of reasons unrelated to the dossier for why they wanted to look at Carter Page."
@Ar_Chroi Well, there were 40 pieces of evidence, and the FISA warrants date back to 2014, well before there was a Trump campaign.
@Ar_Chroi You think Carter Page is out of the woods? I'm curious your argument there.
@Ar_Chroi I guess the application's disclosure that a rival hired a research firm in the middle of a campaign to look into connections to Russia will never be clear enough. Law enforcement typically does not identify persons or organizations not under investigation.

@Barred10 One hurdle is the current Republican-controlled House, where Trump's proposal does not have the votes. (The other, of course, is the Senate, where 60 votes are needed.) A D-controlled House, however, could write a spending plan that can clear the Senate. Then it's up to Prez.

@DrewHampshire From Gorbachev's perspective, the Soviet system had to change for the Russian people to have a shot — a goal that he views as shared by the United States. As Taubman (2017) notes: "It is more the fault of the raw material he worked with than his own real shortcomings..."it failed
@DrewHampshire But this isn't how Gorbachev sees it. The last chapter of William Taubman's biography is instructive in tracking Gorbachev's attitudes after 1992 on what happened, a perceived shift (if not betrayal from the West) and his shifting rhetoric on Putin. His domestic audience matters.
For more why Gorbachev's views on the Cold War's end, see biographer William Taubman's "Gorbachev" (2017): "In Gorbachev's view, neither side had 'won' the cold war, which damaged both sides and which both sides cooperated to end." (p685) https://t.co/IMEiqHFhoS

"People don't like to talk about that," President Trump says of similarities between his border policies and those of President Obama. One reason no one talks about it? That claim of similarity is not backed up by fact. https://t.co/DnuTGXb3H4
"I was very tough," President Trump says of his talk with GM. "You'd better get in there soon." He says "you're going to see something else there" "in the not so distant future." There is no evidence GM plans to do this.

Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio reax to GM closing the Lordstown plant, eliminating more than 1,600 jobs (on top of the 3,000+ over the last two years): "GM has turned its back on us when we need them the most."
INBOX: Dr. Kelli Ward announces she will seek the chairmanship of the Arizona Republican Party.
Sen. Portman reax to GM closing its Lordstown plant: "For decades, workers in the Mahoning Valley have made a commitment to GM, and today GM let Northeast Ohio down.”
Another Black Monday for the Mahoning Valley. In 1977, Youngstown Sheet and Tube set in motion the collapse of the steel industry there. Today, GM announced it was stopping production there in March of next year, all but guaranteeing the end of an auto industry in my hometown.

If the current administrative structure of the House remains the same (and it likely won’t), there will be 127 roles in the GOP minority that need filled. As of Monday afternoon, a projected 198 Republicans would form the GOP caucus next year. Little room for deadwood.

The President says he will keep "Middle Easterners" from crossing into the United States as part of the caravan. Those traveling with the caravan say they have found no evidence of such infiltration.
President Trump, asked about claims lacking proof that "Middle Easterners" are in the caravan, tells reporters he's very good at reading crowds and that they under-reported his crowd size last night in Texas.
@CullyHamner There is no vote scheduled. (Or a bill written, for that matter.) Congress is not coming back before Election Day.

President Trump says he is leaving it up to Congress — "in conjunction with me" — to determine US response to allegations facing Saudi leaders.
President Trump again says a 10% middle-class tax reduction — which he says will cost government nothing — will be done by "resolution" "this week." 1.) Tax cuts have never paid for themselves. 2.) Congress is not here to take up his call. 3.) A "resolution" alone cannot do this.

"You're going to find Middle Eastern." — President Trump, asserting without evidence that the caravan approaching the US includes individuals from the Middle East
President Trump just told reporters that he will lower middle-class taxes by 10% before the election. This is not possible. Congress is gone and will not be coming back before Election Day.

And as much as some Democrats want to make this election all about the base, there are signs it won't be enough. The centrist Third Way projects just 27% of the projected electorate in battleground Senate races was expected to be reliable Democrats. https://t.co/ifFMDFtzrl
As much as we talk about compelling candidates like @Ocasio2018, it's worth noting she's exceptional and not the norm. A Brookings study found 139 "Establishment" Democrats won their primaries to progressives’ 101. This matters in the Midwest. A lot. https://t.co/ifFMDFtzrl

President Trump says he looks forward to swearing-in Justice Kavanaugh, who is already on the bench and took the oath this weekend. Tonight will be a ceremonial photo-op.

President Trump says "bump stocks are gone," in effect. "It's almost gone," he follows up.

"Essentially, I have done that. ... We don't want to go on a witch hunt." —President Trump, asked if the FBI has free hand to investigate claims of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh, and then seems to limit that.
"You don't understand what I'm saying. You do understand. You just don't want to report it that way." —President Trump, to a reporter who is asking for clarity whether the White House has placed limits on the FBI's follow-up investigation re allegations about Kavanaugh.
"What his wife is going through, what his beautiful wife is going through, is indescribable." —President Trump on Kavanaugh's anguish
"What he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible." —President Trump, answering questions about Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court and facing allegations of sexual assault
"OK. Let's go." President Trump, now allowing questions about Judge Kavanaugh.
President Trump, instead of answering his fourth question about the FBI and his SCOTUS nominee, talks about a border wall, ICE and MS-13 — which, to be clear, have nothing to do with the trade agreement he demands to speak about.
"Don't do that." President Trump, asked a fourth time about Judge Kavanaugh, this time by @kaitlancollins. He takes away her microphone.

"Hopefully, he will be confirmed quickly." — President Donald Trump, responding to SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh at an unrelated trade-deal signing with the South Korean leader
@DummarJon You realize you know about the Ellison allegations because the press covered them, right?
@DummarJon The Justice Department and a federal judge disagree with your claim that Michael Cohen's guilty plea involved no crimes. Judges generally don't allow one to plead guilty to non-crimes.
@DummarJon You're talking Congressional hearings (political). I'm talking criminal. These are two different courts — one of public opinion, one of law. See: Kavanaugh, Brett.
@DummarJon A FLOTUS doesn't have to answer for POTUS politics. She is, however, the best defender of a POTUS character. Check out Mrs. Obama, Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Reagan... It's the Presidency's best weapon to humanize and defend the occupant of the Oval Office.
@DummarJon You mean this coverage? https://t.co/LWHqC20VSx
@DummarJon Yeah... If only there were an IG report on the IRS... https://t.co/JSAyWYOqIX
@DummarJon Perhaps your frustration should be aimed at the people who have made it difficult for Mrs. Trump to tell her story — namely, those who behaved in ways that make all of us curious how Mrs. Trump has processed events happening around her.
@DummarJon Were there reasons to ask Mrs. Obama about guilty pleas entered in relation to payoffs to alleged mistresses?
@codypd Assuming @gabrielsherman is accurate, this was part of a press strategy deployed to drive headlines away from a SCOTUS nominee facing a second allegation of improper conduct. https://t.co/i7a7jg0e2K Don't blame the press for reporting what senior officials are telling the press.
@DummarJon Do you really think there is a single news organization on the planet that wouldn't jump at the change to interview Mrs. Trump?

@CrazyOtto78 Crimes that cost money to investigate are still crimes.
@LegalImmigran12 @LeeHernly No, the deal allows him to plead to certain offenses. This is not a complete list. The FBI is keeping other charges hanging over him to keep cooperation coming.
@LeeHernly @LegalImmigran12 That's just not true. GP joins the campaign in early March. He meets the professor, who only becomes interested after being told GP is a Trump adviser.

@sureshkaran Here are the latest https://t.co/LjIB9hqWhX
@BraderGatorNYC But if Team Obama was trying to derail the Trump campaign, they did a very poor job, you must say. I mean, re-opening the Clinton investigation as early vote was underway definitely didn't do her any favors, right?
@D5280Lanny @WilderDanni @johnmjoyce A reminder that Bill Clinton's impeachment process began with an unsuccessful land deal from the 1970s.
@NanbumHall Except that pesky plea deal by his own lawyer... https://t.co/e22exltkJE
@sureshkaran so about collusion... https://t.co/qZOGz13VKq
@codypd And President Clinton was impeached in the House but not convicted in the Senate. Voters elected the jurors in that case. As now, there is a belief that DOJ can't indict a President, but can refer matters to the Presidency's co-equal branch of government.
@BraderGatorNYC @MZHemingway The dossier wasn't solely the product of a research document that, it must be noted, began with GOP funding https://t.co/R04RqXPHp2
@BraderGatorNYC Do we know it's not? Seriously, we only ever hear from the Mueller team when they indict people.
@WilderDanni @D5280Lanny @johnmjoyce And I hope, someday, we do find out the truth. That's how this is supposed to work. It's the only way we keep faith in democracy.
@WilderDanni @NYCTspts @LibertyLover56 I'd note that it took four years of audits to figure out what, exactly, was incorrect in the Obama FEC report. And it was a record at the time.
@WilderDanni @NYCTspts @LibertyLover56 So 1.) he wasn't on the campaign 2.) he pleaded guilt to campaign finance violations 3.) he is on tape discussion this with Trump and 4.) he has nothing to do with Trump campaign? Got it.

@WilderDanni @NYCTspts @LibertyLover56 This is not true. Please see  https://t.co/rz7ATbdVzq
My TL tells me it's not a crime if it's a "process" crime, and unless the word "collusion" appears in an indictment, conviction or plea, it doesn't count, either. Credit where it's due: President Trump is shaping public "understanding" in ways not seen since early Law &amp; Order.

@codypd This speaks to the broader problem with covering the Trump Administration — people who are offered as authoritative and official sources are often undercut a short time later by the President.

Asked about Obama's comments about threats to democracy, Schlapp says Trump stands for the national anthem
"They're pushing forward a very socialist, liberal agenda." —WH adviser Schlapp responding to Obama speech
On Fox News, senior adviser Mercedes Schlapp is touting consumer confidence numbers as a rebuttal to what Barack Obama just said. "Show up for one of President Trump's rallies and see where the real energy is at."
Per WH pool, President Trump suggests the NYT made up the entire op-ed. "Maybe the Times did it. Look, the Times uses phony sources all the time." (There is no evidence whatsoever that this is the case.)
Per White House pool: "I’m highly educated and always did well ... no matter what I did. Whether I was in show business, I was in show business, I had The Apprentice, one of the top shows on television. ... Then I tried politics and I started off as President." —President Trump

"It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years." —Barack Obama
"Ordinary people fought and marched and mobilized and built and, yes, voted to make history." —Barack Obama

If I'm hearing this correctly, Donald Trump didn't even pay alleged mistresses with his own money. He asked lawyer Michael Cohen to invoice it to the Trump Organization.
Prosecutors suggest the Trump Organization faces prosecution for illegal campaign finance contributions.
Per prosecutors, Cohen admitted to charges that he submitted invoices to the Trump Organization for "services rendered" — when in fact they were unlawful campaign contributions to bury allegations of affairs

@JanetMafGalea @Animastjw And an Arkansas land deal wound up talking about another President's sex life — in a case prepared by a current SCOTUS nominee https://t.co/l64j6lVZ6m This whole thing was entirely predictable.
@JanetMafGalea @Animastjw Pretty sure these people's lives are being ruined by people (potentially) breaking the law.
WE HAVE A RUNNING PRODUCER ON THE SATELLITE FEED!
Per pool, the President has boarded Air Force One without speaking to reporters as there is a ton of news of the day.
@JanetMafGalea @Animastjw News is news.
@JanetMafGalea Because the President's fixer entering a plea on campaign finance charges is unrelated to the President how?
Jury reaches agreement on 8/18 charges against Manafort; Cohen is in court to enter a plea deal on, among other things, campaign finance violations; and the President is en route Andrews, onward to West Virginia for a campaign rally.
@JanetMafGalea Who was Michael Cohen's other client needing campaign finance work?

@claudester @vonbremzen If you want authentic Soviet food, The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food has been reissued with an English translation. It captures that era nicely.
@claudester @vonbremzen It's actually a beautifully written social history. Yes, there are recipes at the end (the Salat Olivier is especially good), but it's largely a history of 20th Century Russia as told through one incredible family.

Kelli Ward is also grinding it out. One night, she and I went to a Denny's restaurant to meet with Tea Party activists. The AC was on the fritz. The thermostat on the wall? 94 degrees. Dr. Ward didn't blink an eye. https://t.co/AiF3v3wrJ5
When Kelli Ward and I spoke last week at her campaign HQ, she was not the candidate from 2016. “I’ve heard people say, ‘You’re a different candidate than you were two years ago.’ Well, if I weren’t, then I shouldn’t be here running for this office." https://t.co/AiF3v3wrJ5
The Kelli Ward of 2016 is not the Ward of 2018.  “She’s cleaned up her act,” says Francine Romesburg, who leads the Grassroots Tea Party Activists of Arizona and considers Ward a friend. This is why — ever so slightly — she's becoming less scary to DC https://t.co/AiF3v3wrJ5

@steviedeadlocks Same pattern as Russia in 2016, per company.
In context, the President is threatening a government shutdown at the same hour as Facebook is acknowledging Russians are back at it, meddling in US elections — much as they did in 2016 when Trump won. Remember, the President is super insecure about his election’s validity.

Setting aside the non-binding spending goal is by 2024 (not 2025), the President also seems to have not read this thoughtful piece from a former NATO Ambassador, @RNicholasBurns https://t.co/bAx5nuzNTf https://t.co/QIG0GBMVKP
The New York Times Editorial Board has a very fair explainer on what the President is getting wrong about trade and tariffs https://t.co/NQQ1wvPUTN https://t.co/QIG0GBvkmf
Meanwhile, the President also thinks he doubled NATO nations' "bills" (they're not bills) to 4% of GDP — well above what the United States pays. The NATO proposal is likely to find support on par with returning to immigration talks that have proven impossible so far. https://t.co/kuv2Cxo2S7
From Europe, the President is urging Congress to return to the politically fraught topic of immigration — as lawmakers have a SCOTUS nominee to consider, a spending bill to pass and a potential Democratic wave growing for November. https://t.co/kuv2Cxo2S7
