@whatzaname I am hardly ever offended by debate unless it resorts to name calling. Not something I have seen you engage in. I enjoyed it.
@whatzaname Unfortunately for you that would favor the GOP, the most dedicated voters are older than average and white which is the GOP base
@whatzaname It discourages interest in voting and reduces participation when a winner can't be determined quickly.

@whatzaname We tried IRO here in Pierce County WA. It didn't work well and we went back.
@whatzaname Condorcet's paradox shows why IRO is not a good method for determining actual voter support. You would like many of his ideas.

@whatzaname Condorcet's ideas seem much like yours, his contribution led to the French Revolution, although he opposed much of the excesses.

@whatzaname I think what you are hoping for has been tried. There were many many variants in 19th century communes.
@whatzaname The problem comes when those who are currently wealthy use government to prevent the next group from becoming wealthy.
@whatzaname I don't have a problem with wealthy being wealthy, it seems to create a growing dynamic society.
@whatzaname You might want to read Bakunin an others, the communes were a little more complex than the name would imply.
@whatzaname Are you familiar with Bakunin the 19th century anarchist? You would seem to agree with him. None of the communes worked tho.
@whatzaname One reason for abandoning Articles of Confederation and adopting the Constitution was to limit peoples' power to take property
@whatzaname In the US the share of wealth controlled by the wealthy changes little, how and when they declare income varies with Gov Policy.
@whatzaname Read "Corruption and Reform: Lessons from America's Economic History" by Edward L. Glaeser
@whatzaname During the 19th century getting a corporate charter was limited, only those with money to buy gov officials were incorporated.

@whatzaname Low or no corporate taxes encourages multinationals to HQ in the USA where there highest paid execs will reside and pay taxes.
@whatzaname What would be your solution that has worked in practice to limit large corporations ability to use government to write the rules
@whatzaname The response to the the gilded age was the biggest corps teamed with Gov, wrote rules that eliminated their smaller competition
@whatzaname Low corporate taxes & limited government increases corporate profits while limiting their using government to our detriment.
@whatzaname When Corps team up with government we have a problem, absent that the more corp profits the better for our economy and country.
@whatzaname The rich always have a disproportionate influence in government so how does further empowering government reduce that?
@whatzaname What do corpopration do with profits: invest, create jobs, pay employees/shareholders who pay taxes. Why tax the corporation?
@JustABrick I don't buy 600 NPR stations shut, even if true radio frequencies are a valuable commodity, someone will use them & the workers.
@bamagirl0117 Thank you for following me 1st.  Thank your Dad and Husband for serving and protecting our great country.
@JustABrick NPR and all of their popular programs will continue because people or advertisers will support it, Where is the 9,000 job loss?
@SSBohio Shouldn't. Unfortunately twitter is too limited to thoroughly discuss the extent of enumerated powers.
@SSBohio Jefferson whose view of the Constitution was the most limited launched an offensive war against the Barbary Pirates.
@SSBohio Eisenhower Justified the Interstate Highway system as a military necessity. Beyond that congress should fund local bridges.
@SSBohio By funding the war congress has implicitly given the support to a declaration of war.
@JustABrick If Rush didn't have an audience among the troops he wouldn't and shouldn't be on.
@JustABrick Defunding NPR might eliminate a few stations that lack enough audience. If people care enough they can find private money
@SSBohio @PBS @NPR Regulated yes but funded hardly.
@SSBohio The Constitution does not specify the form a declaration must take, providing the funding is an implicit approval of the Iraq War.
@JustABrick You can argue in congress whether Rush should be on Army Airwaves but troop moral is a legitimate part of maintaining an army.
@SSBohio How would funding of NPR possibly be part of congress's power to regulate Interstate Commerce? War is a power explicitly granted.
@JustABrick According to NPR their target audience is highly educated, white, liberal http://jr.ly/cvkk A minority who can pay themselves.
@SSBohio I like the Smithsonian but again it is not a proper role for a federal government of enumerated powers.
@SSBohio @NPR @PBS Partially but even if they had a conservative bias the government should not be funding it.
@SSBohio What do you mean by it is not the principle?
@JustABrick Federal funding makes up a small percent of NPR's budget, the  rich liberal's who listen can pay the difference themselves.
@JustABrick It is not the amount, it is the principle. The purpose of government isn't to make others pay for your entertainment. Defund NPR

@writer2go The rich always have disproportianate influence in government, the more powerful the government the more the rich benefit.
@davidfrum  Many rich people may vote Republican but the really rich, the top 2%, vote Democrat.  http://tinyurl.com/4cjjhu
@jennisahottie Clinton with the medias active support managed to blame the Republicans for his vetoing a spending bill and the shutdown.
@joethepatriotic Courts including Scalia have  recognized the Presidents power to ignore unconstitutional laws. Freytag v. Commissioner
@joethepatriotic There is nothing in the Constitution giving the Courts authority to decide for the President what is Constitutional.
@joethepatriotic When the President takes an oath to uphold the Constitution the President should do only what the Supreme Court decides?
@ThirdWayTweet I believe it was Mussolini who first talked about "the Third Way," are you fans or followers of Mussolini?
