@Slate All pedophiles should be shot upon conviction.
@allahpundit Or maybe it’s cause they are constitutionalists by heart and practice, or something dumb like that

@TheRickWilson Stop judging their cuck sucking festival man. It’s not nice 😂
@realDailyWire @michaeljknowles Its stuck fam, Trump is cooked
@NoahCRothman This is why a lot of us left
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist @mchooyah It’s the main thing they say on their propaganda videos. But I hope there is no war, just know we are ready to step in. Have a great day
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist @mchooyah Al qaeda and the rest of the terrorist groups have killed thousands of innocents who weren’t combatants cause they’ll get 40 virgin goats or something. We minimize collateral damage and prosecute war crimes. Pakistan is a country run by criminals
@BradThor That would require the ability to actually delegate, organize, and make deals tho
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist @mchooyah Again it would take us twenty minutes to drone the fuck out of some goat rapist terrorists, we don’t even need boots on the ground.
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist @mchooyah We’d be glad to show you what happens when we don’t hold back, unlike Muslim militaries, we actually care about collateral damage.
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist We have the best military in the world lol. It would take us maybe 2 hours to defeat Pakistan. Goats aren’t good snipers lmao cc: @mchooyah
@nytimes Hamas paid them to RUSH the border. What the fuck are the Israeli soldiers supposed to do when IEDs are thrown at them???
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist Nah, Pakistan harbors terrorists. Full stop. They just better hope we don’t send our amazing warriors there from the US.
@jxtfadi @TheEconomist It’s theirs. Always has been, always will be, no matter how many terrorists Pakistan sends to hurt civilians. Plus we found Osama in Pakistan where they hid him for years.
@TheEconomist Maybe tell Pakistan to stop funding and harboring terrorism and no one would care about them.
@NoahCRothman BUT JUDGES AND A THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CUT!! 😑
Remember, Pakistan has long been an incredibly unstable country with few human rights and loads of terrorists. I mean that’s where we found Osama Bin Laden. The govt of Pakistan should be held accountable for a lot of things. #IndiaPakistan

@Tchapel98 @julie_kelly2 @federalistmemes Nah we would have ended up with the same result. Socialism is a fraudulent system. People wouldn’t have made Bernie president
@bob_emotional @julie_kelly2 @federalistmemes You are right cause the GOP is just the same as the dems. Both parties create massive debt for their pet projects
@Tchapel98 @julie_kelly2 @federalistmemes Yeah Hillary should be in jail, Trump shouldn’t be president, these things aren’t mutually exclusive

@federalistmemes @BigDadSteve @julie_kelly2 Trump killed the GOP. And no you didn’t. Democracy was invented in Greece. Of course I’m thankful for people like GW and Lincoln, but not people like Seb fucking Gorka or idiots like Tammy
@federalistmemes @BigDadSteve @julie_kelly2 Also abortion isn’t a real libertarian ideal cause we believe the only thing governments should protect are life and liberty.
@federalistmemes @BigDadSteve @julie_kelly2 Actually I would tell you to go to a different baker. Yeah the world is already globalized as fuck except for dumb rednecks who will die off on their own anyway
@federalistmemes @BigDadSteve @julie_kelly2 No, I’m a libertarian. I want the smallest government possible. Leave people alone and let them flourish. Want a gun? Buy one. Want to send your kids to private school? Do it. No more nation building bullshit.
@BigDadSteve @julie_kelly2 @federalistmemes Lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo. The national debt is higher than ever, we are in trade wars that are killing the steel and manufacturing industries.

@socialism_liker @SenSanders Right...and I can deduct the depreciation of the machine on my taxes, why would I want to hire  a bunch of low skill workers who will inevitably have issues with attendance, work ethic etc.
Anyone who is constitutionally qualified should be allowed to run https://t.co/tpXfH4mbjq
@socialism_liker @SenSanders It wouldn't have been as prevalent 20 years ago because technology wasn't at that stage, it is now. I went to the National Restaurant Association show, there was a machine that made burgers to order in 30 seconds. The machine is a couple grand, it makes sense if wages are higher
@socialism_liker @SenSanders Never said automation isn’t happening now lol, just how much faster it would be with a higher minimum wage (by almost double)
@socialism_liker @SenSanders Depends on the industry. You can’t “stop” automation, you can only delay it at best. We should be focused on retraining our workforce, not worrying about increasing wages. Wages would naturally be higher if tied to the market and not arbitrarily set by lawmakers.
@socialism_liker @SenSanders Economic equilibrium for labor supply vs demand
@SenSanders This is a good way to ensure that all the low skill jobs will become automated

@brown_tony1 @WSJ Boys being aggressive isn’t the same as “toxic masculinity.” Being a bad person (sexual assault era etc) is not a masculine trait.
@brown_tony1 @WSJ Cause parents stopped caring about their kids and decided corporate success is more important than having a strong family.
@brown_tony1 @WSJ Stop giving kids iPads and make em go outside. Watch the aggression fall after junior’s been building tree houses all day.
@WSJ Or because of thousands of years of evolution and adaptation have a major impact on how genders act and we need to find ways to harness that aggression into something positive. But no, "toxic masculinity"
