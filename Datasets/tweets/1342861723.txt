We will meet President Obama’s goal of approving 20,000 MW of renewable #energy on public lands by 2020. #conservation
There are more special places that need protection, and more stories that should be told. #conservation
We owe it to future generations to act. As he has already demonstrated, Pres. Obama is ready &amp; willing to step up where Congress falls short
Congress also needs to fulfill the promise made to the American people through the Land and Water #Conservation Fund.
It’s a budget that supports our parks, forests, refuges, rivers &amp; #conservation lands &amp;, as a result, strengthens our economy.
As a start, Congress should get back to regular order and pass the President’s budget. #conservation
And that’s why he has used his authority time and time again to protect some of the places that Americans love most.  #conservation
That’s why he’s taking comprehensive action to cut carbon pollution and to slow the effects of #climate change. #Conservation
We have a moral obligation to the next generation to leave our land, water, and wildlife better than we found it. #conservation
I know where President Obama stands. #conservation
Or like the dozens of states/local communities that pass strong measures to fund open spaces &amp; build new parks. #conservation
Congress since 2010, hasn’t acted to protect a single new acre of public land as a national park or a wilderness area. #conservation
Will it be the legacy of short-sighted funding and partisan gridlock that we are witnessing in Congress?  #conservation
It’s important to think about what #conservation legacy we will leave for the next 50 years, for the next 100 years.
The shutdown clarified what’s at stake. It reminded us that our parks, wildlife refuges &amp; public lands are uniquely American. #conservation
The shutdown had a huge economic impact on the local businesses &amp; gateway communities that rely on public lands. #conservation
