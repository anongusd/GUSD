My opinion on Claire Mccaskill voting no on Judge Kavanaugh. 		Claire needs some republican votes in order for her to win re-election. Voting no on the nomination will only hurt her. Democrats are going to vote for her regardless of if she votes yes or no...... (continued)

@PoliceOne ......    your not there, but I can say for certain I would have tried everything in my power to stop someone from taking incident lives. Even if it meant I would not come home to my family. That’s why I signed up to be a police officer.
@PoliceOne As a deputy in Florida this really hits close to home. I knew when I joined the police academy that I was going to run toward danger not away. I just don’t understand why someone would sign up to be a police officer and not do their job. It’s easy to criticize someone even though
@GayRepublicSwag I think all republicans need to come together. If Mitt Romney wins we must united.
