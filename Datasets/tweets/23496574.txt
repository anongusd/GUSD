Panelists: Regs will need to resolve friction btwn munis &amp; telcos on blding smart city infrastr or using existing telco infrastr. #CICPS
Renshall: On futurproofing:  Since utilities are used to planning for 20 years ahead, a lot of planning is based around fiber. #CICPS
Madden: There are services going out today that we may categorize under broader term of smart cities. #CICPS
Renshall: Market may not come up w/solutions in timely manner.  Makes biz case more difficult &amp; the delivery of smart city more uncertain.
Renshall: The budget. The cost of implementation even if its only a part, is expensive. #CICPS
Wiebe: Why hasn’t this concept or application of smart cities evolved more quickly? #CICPS
Wade: On smart city: its about improving quality of life. #CICPS
David Wade, Executive Vice President and COO, Chattanooga EPB on last panel.  #CICPS
Renshall: On smart cities: Key is understanding on a local level what you want smart. No single definition. #CICPS
Dygert: on smart city: - 1) mobilized city workforce, 2) mobilize &amp; bring online citizen services 3) connect everything. #CICPS
Jeff Dygert, Executive Director, Public Policy, AT&amp;T Services on last panel. #CICPS
Renshall: Impt 2 have clear vision 2 embark on smart city – what is it about &amp; what it will deliver. Also need to have comm strategy. #CICPS

Quinn: Dynamic exchange of multiple devices, w/new mix of apps based on utilities. (SMUD &amp;GRE may have difft ones). #CICPS
Zafuto: I don’t think we’re at smart grid 1.0 – I think we’re beyond that, and its difficult to measure it in those terms. #CICPS
Quinn: Keeps me up @ night that we may pull plug on 1.0 b4 we see benefits. Hope we get 2 articulate &amp; prove it 2 people (regs, consumers).
Quinn: We have to get better at describing and proving out the value of 1.0 before we get to 2.0. #CICPS
Doug McGinnis,SNC: If this is smart grid 1.0, what does smart grid 2.0 look like? #CICPS
Quinn: We should be able to be flexible and cater to both and other types of customer’s needs. #CICPS
Quinn: We have some customers who just want to keep their bills low and just want things to stay the same. #CICPS
Quinn: We need 2 evolve our thinking -- there are early adopters who want PV on their roof &amp; our traditional system will not be enuf. #CICPS
Quinn: We as utilities have had to serve whom we’ve been told to serve. Not the same for carriers who have classes of customers.  #CICPS
Jones: Challenge: metering is an all or nothing kind of proposition. You can't just put it where you need it and not anywhere else. #CICPS
Quinn: Our challenge is 2 make a grid that’s robust &amp; responsive (minmize events) &amp; then have capability 2 view down 2 the endpoints. #CICPS
Michael Quinn, Vice President &amp; Chief Technology Officer, Oncor Electric Delivery is on 3rd Panel. #CICPS
Shoutout to @opower. SMUD's Paul Lau on 3rd party partnerships &amp; the importance of evaluating ROI, gives example of work with Opower #cicps

Shin:  Lots of wind farms coming on to our grid in Hawaii. Started a program for medium scale integration.  #CICPS
Shin: Utilities will end up having to catch up with them if they aren’t already building on new technologies! #CICPS
Shin: The ones building from ground (PVs, wind farms) they are building new and latest technology. #CICPS
Nichols: Push for a different depreciation – it’s a different kind of investment. #CICPS
Nichols: Advice to utility stakeholders investing in integration, SG – don’t just accept standard utility life. #CICPS
Nichols: At utilities, it’s a 15 year cycle. It’s a very dynamic space.  #CICPS
Nichols: Plus, in IT whatever mistakes you made in version 1 in terms of availability or security, you can rectify that in upgrades. #CICPS
Nichols: In IT, you think you can field a large new system &amp; in 3-5 years it will be replaced by a new system.  #CICPS
Shin:  We do require that consumers using renewables put in SCADA,&amp; have a comm system that our utility can interact with &amp; monitor. #CICPS
Shin: Utilities treated telecom as orphan child, just a small little department in a big company that focused on electricity. #CICPS
Shin:  For that, for us, you need a strong telecom infrastructure. #CICPS
Shin:  All of our customers seem to hear a lot about Smart Grid &amp; they know it will help integrate renewables.  #CICPS
Debbie Shin, Director of Telecommunications Planning, Hawaiian Electric Company on 2nd Panel #CICPS
Nichols: This is a career-defining challenge given that there are so many difficult trade-offs between cost, security &amp; capacity. #CICPS
Nichols: Given lack of real standards, including lack of dedicated spectrum it’s a hard &amp; difficult thing to do. #CICPS
Nichols: That’s big scary #. Need 2 think abt stability of current 2 keep voltage on grid. Regs are pretty frightening frm energy POV #CICPS
Nichols: Sempra has to plan energy needs for 20M people. Renewables are a gigantic part – approaching 30% at utility. #CICPS
Jeff Nichols, Dir. Info Security &amp; Info Mgt, Sempra Energy Util on 2nd panel: Challenge of Integrating Distributed Energy Resources #CICPS

Joe Rigby Chairman, President &amp; CEO Pepco Holdings: We have trained a whole new group of energy advisors &amp; we need to step our game on it.
Joe Rigby Chairman, President &amp; CEO Pepco Holdings -- What does a modern utility look like? Need to have a different mindset. #CICPS
FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn: If you're pro-active abt informing public abt what you’re discussing, you'll have more enhanced buy-in.
FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn: There are fewer interactions &amp; disruptions btwn people we serve when there is enhanced dialogue.  #CICPS
Clyburn: Sharing of spectrum &amp; infrastructure provides tremendous opptys for utilities. Given limited resource we have of spectrum.  #CICPS
FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn: ‘sharing’ is the word of the day. Efficiency is the other one. #CICPS
Ray Baum, House E&amp;C: Right now, federal government has the largest holder of spectrum. #CICPS
Ray Baum, House E&amp;C. Internet is dependent on the electric grid &amp; thus we need to deal with cybersecurity issues.  #CICPS

3) Finally,its all about consumers.Need to engage and talk to them but the pressures of reality means they cant always have an option. #sgps
2) Challenges include clarity from federal govts on standards, accountability. But utilities need to work with regulators. #sgps
That's a wrap! Summary of the final session - 1) The smart grid community is on the right path by involving all the stakeholders #sgps
Industry associations at the table include @ctia, @NARUC @gridwise, @appanews, @Edison_Electric , @UStelecom, @EPRINews , NRECA, AAB #sgps
Final session at #SGPS now -industry associations that supported the event discuss the key take aways from the sessions to use for SG #sgps
3) Needs to be a balance between privacy and innovation. Need to create baseline for security and leverage the data being collected. #sgps
2) Majority panelists agreed data privacy is where states act the quickest and where they should be making mandates. #sgps
Summary of #SGPS Data Privacy Panel - 1) Need to have consumers engage and buy in and be aware of what data is being used and how.
Need to de-sensationalize what data is being collected by meters, and need collaborative consumer education effort #sgps
Robin Lunt,NARUC-Challenge;when utilities tell consumers abt changes in data collection, are penalised for spike in callcenter calls #sgps
Data management systems need to be uniform,otherwise its costly & inefficient for utilities operating in multi-state service territory #sgps
Mark Carpenter, Oncor - all data is not equal, and some customers would appreciate their utility knowing when lights are out. #sgps
Lillie Coney-privacy groups warned abt threats like identity theft when fin. instts went digital.Utilities need to talk abt this now. #sgps
Panel debates if laws on use of customer data needs to be managed by states or if federal law is needed. Dont existing laws cover it? #sgps
Happening Now at #SGPS - panelists debate how the data from smart meters and devices need to be managed.
Khosla - DHS not regulators, utilities should come to us freely, we have $$ & its our responsibility to work with crit. assets owners #sgps
#SGPS Day 2 Lunch Speaker DHS' Amit Khosla (Dpty Dir Control Systems Security Program)says DHS wants to help utilities address & fix threats
4) Utilities struggle with reporting to multiple agencies & rules that have varied interpretations on cyber requirements.Need clarity #sgps
3) Each & every utility cannot have someone with a security clearance. Still need to share & use information released to secure fix. #sgps
2) Needs to be a change in culture of information sharing between govt-to-utility, utility-to-utility, and utility-to-regulator. #sgps
Summary of Cybersecurity Overload session - 1) Smart Grid Cybersecurity is a process, not a project. Needs constant work and info. #sgps
Roxey & McClanahan- Utilities cant afford to prepare against nation-state cyber attacks.Govt(DOE) needs to provide $$ and research. #sgps
Tim Roxey, NERC -Fear tht SG is being done wrong & installed meter base will go away in next 10 yrs because they'll be found insecure. #sgps
Robert McClanahan, AK Electric Coop- Constant stream of orgs, agencies that want to be the lead-DOE,FERC,NERC,NIST,state regulators #sgps
Onto session titled 'Cybersecurity Overload: Meeting Challenges of Implementation and Communication' #sgps
4)Utilities concerned tht they,not software devlpers,are held liable for faulty software.Smaller utilities need tools to test vendors. #sgps
3) Utilities are spending more time and working on security. These are complex systems, and there are cost vs. risk issues. #sgps
2) Some states, like CA, where SG deployment's ready for roll-out wont wait for fed cyberstandards development & will create their own #sgps
#SGPS Cybersecurity Requirements Panel Summary 1) Compliance is NOT security. It is the first, expected step though.
RT @PatrickCMiller: "Why are software companies allowed to sell vulnerable software without any liability?" Lynn Ellyn #SGPS
Ellyn - Security needs to look @ architectures&wht is appropriate for wht level of risk-convenience is NOT a good argument for CI. #sgps
RT @ErichGunther: Chris Villareal from CPUC at #SGPS reports they will be proactive developing cyber metrics and standards before nation ...
Ellyn -Cant patch everything on same day- thts very unrealistic idea, the consequence is lot of outages. thr are 2nd 3rd order effects #sgps
Ellyn-Dont tamper w/ something tht works unless doing smthng better. analog device–doesnt fail&doesnt present opprtnites for hackers. #sgps
How should utilities/policy makers address legacy systems/devices tht havent been patched in years & tht they dont even know exists. #sgps
RT @PatrickCMiller: "Utilities have no interest in reporting cyersecurity issues to the PUC." Chris Villarreal #SGPS &lt; they want metr ...
Chris Villareal, CA PUC - PUC wants metrics on utility cybersecurity; going to start technical working group to create metrics #sgps
Lynne Ellen, CIO of DTE - Compliance is imp- whats needed is anticipating, detecting and reacting to what is emerging in real time #sgps.
Annabelle Lee, EPRI - compliance is NOT equal to security, but it is the baseline. Got to start with compliance before you move fwd. #sgps
#SGPS Day 2 of cybersecurity and the smart grid is off with a session on cybersecurity requirements: does compliance = security? #sgps
#SGPS will back tomorrow morning for packed agenda covering #cybersecurity and data #privacy. Lunch keynote by DHS' Amit Khosla.
Thank you @RustyWill , @anchari , @RuralTelComment and @NARUC for your tweets on #sgps. Thank you @wirelesscott and @TomAyers for your RTs!
RT @msbrumfield: RT @cpettus: The Smart Grid: Will Utilities Build Or Lease? :: Communications Technology http://www.cable360.net/ct/458 ...
George Bjelovuk, AEP - Interoperability is critical where consumers will be expected to engage with the smart grid. #sgps
Historically, standards have always moved slowly, but then even industry moved slowly. Not the case now - @ErichGunther speaking at #sgps
Will industry use standards voluntarily? And if there is voluntary adoption, then why do we need regulators involved at all? #sgps
Final panel of #SGPS Day 1 to address smart grid interoperability standards. NIST's George Arnold provides overview of process thus far.
3) Consumer engagement &education is key. No need to create hype or create false expectations. Use factual evidence & create dialogue. #sgps
2) It is against utility industry interest to offer opt-out choice. Sets bad precendent; customers need to accept service upgrades. #sgps
Building Consumer Acceptance Panel at #SGPS - 1)SG Pilots tht engage all stakeholders work. Challenge is repeating tht success in deployment
Rob Wihilite, GridWise - having customers opt out sets a dangerous precedent for the industry which needs to be addressed, what next? #sgps
Rick Morgan, DC PSC & Lisa Wood - studies show that percentage wise, low-income households see similar benefits from crit. peak rebate #sgps
Should consumers get smart-meter opt-out options? What about low-income communities that will not reap any benefits from new meters? #sgps
Betty Ann Kane, DC Public Service Commission Chair- dont hype smart grid/smart meters if you cant manage expectations, handle backlash #sgps
