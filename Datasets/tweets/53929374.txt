If you're following along with the #HowDareYou tweetstorm today, here's how you can take action now. We just put 49 of these anti-choice Republicans "On Notice." You can help us hold them accountable and replace them with pro-choice Democratic women: https://t.co/M6XvrkpcG9 https://t.co/D5QDLvBdD3
The incumbents we've put "On Notice" have been loyally supporting and advancing policies that would repeal access to affordable health care, restrict our reproductive rights, and harm families. So we're recruiting and working with candidates in these flippable districts. https://t.co/k63KfkOQCw

I've always said that the bravest thing you can do in a democracy is put your name on the ballot. No matter what happens tonight, I'm so proud of all of our women who have been a part of this historic wave. Best of luck to you all!

I'm going to be on @hardball soon to talk about all the exciting races we can win tomorrow! Take a moment to watch while texting out the vote!
A cute story for you today: @liuba4congress's four-year-old daughter Mila will run straight up to the podium before her mom's campaign events begin! “She’s learned that mommies run for office.” Mila, we're going to have you running for office in no time! https://t.co/NnLkrX4znw

This is, frankly, incredible. How can Josh Hawley turn over his office to his consultants and now say he wants to be a leader for Missouri? Is he going to turn over his Senate office to consultants? At least their commute will be shorter. https://t.co/t1pnnWGB7n
I'm proud of how our women have shifted expectations and pushed boundaries so they can be more authentically themselves on the campaign trail. That's real progress that will make it easier for even more women to run for office in the future. https://t.co/Wfu59hsV7q

I am devastated by what has happened in Pittsburgh today. Americans should be free to worship without fear, and the rising hate and bigotry in this country should alarm us all. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and the entire Tree of Life Congregation today.
Martha McSally is taking a page from Donald Trump's playbook and is just blatantly lying now. It's going to really shock her to find out that health care access really, really matters to Arizona voters. https://t.co/Qpxf4kUmsX

Thank you @rachelepstein_ for featuring @emilyslist's work alongside all of these fabulous organizations! My team and I have been working hard to elect a historic number of women this year — bring on Election Day! https://t.co/7nIFPvlDEI
Martha McSally says that she wants to protect health care access for people with pre-existing conditions, but when she actually had the opportunity to do so, she voted TO REPEAL the ACA, which actually protects people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/FpfyHEmFyC
I know that saying "Trump lied" is about as obvious as saying "water is wet" but seriously, this is one lie that we can't let him get away with. The only ones actively working to undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions are the GOP. https://t.co/mkKGvA0ixC
Women are only 20% of Congress. That's why @emilyslist has been laser-focused on recruiting, training, and electing women. And we can elect a historic number this November! https://t.co/EV9DCwWfRI
The choice in this election is all too clear. Georgia's future is too important to put in the hands of a discriminatory and dishonest cheat like Kemp. https://t.co/2hcOlvotIF
This Las Vegas Sun endorsement for @RosenforNevada nails it — if we want to overcome the Donald Trump-fueled polarization, we need to elect senators like Jacky who will stand up to him. https://t.co/tD31gVhiBJ

This is what I've seen over and over again. Women voters and candidates are energized like never before. And only a fraction of the 42k+ women who've told us they want to run have launched their campaigns so far. This change is here for the long haul. https://t.co/Sl5fvCLYwS

You have to read the stories our women are sharing on #WhyIRun today. Too many of us have alarming stories about trying to access affordable health care — but our candidates are going to fight to make sure we all have access to the care we need.
This blatant attempt to disenfranchise voters shows how desperate Kemp is — and how unfit for office he is. We need to give @StaceyAbrams as much support as we can. https://t.co/tGvWM6g1Nn
One of the most incredible things I've seen this cycle is how many young girls are fired up and taking action to make their voices heard, like these incredible girls from @hyagv. I can't wait to see what the young girls of the next generation will do! #DayOfTheGirl https://t.co/TYHQcq0DZm

Each victory builds on the one before it. Small ones build up to bigger ones. And the more power we take back, the more progress we can make. So we all have to dig deeper and do more than we’ve ever done before. But we can win. I hope you'll join us: https://t.co/2u9lmJwI3X
Winning is the only way we make progress, and we make progress with every win. Remember Virginia last year! We picked up 15 seats — 11 were our pro-choice Dem women. And even though we fell just one seat short of breaking the Republican majority, Medicaid expansion passed anyway!
(Oh, and we have 42,000 women who have told us they want to run for office. That is unprecedented. That's the kind of energy that will earn us wins for generations to come.)
To do that, we have to take the energy we’ve built — with women voters, volunteers, and a record number of endorsed women on the ballot — and WIN on November 6th.
Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination and confirmation were a national disgrace. Now it’s up to us to do everything we can to fight back and hold those who voted to confirm him accountable.

If you want to protect access to health care, help @emilyslist elect pro-choice Democratic women who will fight for it like @RashidaTlaib, @IlhanMN, and @JahanaHayesCT! https://t.co/GSAj29SYgB
I'm so excited by @AngieCraigMN. She's an exceptional candidate who has been a champion for Minnesota families. And she can take down one of the most disgraceful, hateful members of Congress. Congrats to her on advancing through her primary, now let's help her win in November!
No matter which way it happens, it ends with Trump and Kavanaugh restricting or ending safe, legal access to abortion, and with thousands of women's lives and health at risk. https://t.co/P7lfUqu8zE
@emilyslist Most importantly, we will not stop working to elect women of color to office, whose voices are desperately needed in our government at all times.
@emilyslist We stand in solidarity with communities of color in fighting back against those who coddle neo-Nazis and white supremacists and write their racist beliefs into government policies.
Like the thousands of peaceful protesters who stood up to bigotry this weekend, we at @emilyslist refuse to back down and accept a society in which people of color are under constant threat of violence.
San Francisco, come join us! https://t.co/oxcNpwTfUp

It was so good to see you, @SCJ4PA! We were proud to endorse you — and I know you're going to do great things. https://t.co/nz6AE6RL5b

It is the Senate's responsibility to fully vet nominees to the Supreme Court, and the public must be able to hold them accountable for doing so. Brett Kavanaugh's papers must be made available. https://t.co/Nbwq3HieMO

We've got 100 days left until November 6th, 2018. How do you want to feel on November 7th? We need to leave it all out on the field. Follow these steps and help us elect a historic wave of pro-choice Democratic women! https://t.co/0tbftu39ir
Look at this amazing #ProChoice group! Thanks for joining us today! https://t.co/ABHGYHyved
So many of @emilyslist's candidates have a similar story. They watched Republicans attack the Affordable Care Act and decided to fight back by running for office. Republicans are going to face consequences for attacking health care this November. https://t.co/FAxqP6a4QV
Wow. Read this thread. Every new revelation manages to be worse. Rep. Jason Lewis's excuses for his behavior and his comments are weak, and his refusal to acknowledge how offensive his behavior is shows how totally unfit he is to serve in Congress. https://t.co/6uFfad2uM6
Thank you to everyone who came out to join us at Cocktails for Change tonight! We're going to take back the House and the Senate, and we're going to do it with pro-choice Democratic women. Our future depends on it. #ElectWomen https://t.co/fEb5B23wTk
A historic number of women are running for office, but they're just the beginning. If we want to make history this November, we need women to come out and vote for @emilyslist-endorsed candidates! https://t.co/oI6VaPXXoq
There has never been a majority-women state legislature in our country's history. But Nevada can change that this November! That's why we have to work harder than ever to elect a wave of pro-choice Democratic women. https://t.co/kX6P4KiU35
It was so great to see my friend @CecileRichards today. Thanks for firing up the @emilyslist team and getting us pumped up for the fight ahead of us! https://t.co/5FdwrQu3O0
Congratulations to both @LucyWins2018 and @Carolyn4GA7 on winning their primaries today! These are both very exciting races in districts that we CAN flip — and we can't wait to send both of these women to Congress this November!
Congrats to @iliza on your @netflix special premiere today! Though I'm not particularly looking forward to reliving the early 2000's. 😂
Health insurance premiums are going to go up again in 2019, and you can blame Republican sabotage of the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/PWocpw29a7
@emilyslist And at a time when GOP-controlled state legislatures are passing some of the worst anti-choice legislation we’ve seen in years and #RoevWade is at stake at SCOTUS, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Families deserve to have pro-choice Democratic women at the table fighting for them.
This is a monster of a thread, but it's a must-read. The @emilyslist team has done great work to recruit a truly monumental number of women to run in state legislative races. This sea change isn't just happening in Congress, it's happening in statehouses across the country. https://t.co/kAQavP9ydP

Absolutely despicable. And yet, totally unsurprising that Donald Trump would endorse Kemp. https://t.co/kUpJdNsFuJ
The Senate needs to do their due diligence, and that means they need time to review Judge Kavanaugh's records. https://t.co/8FMJYxA2Xj

If you had any doubt left, let this clear that up for you. Donald Trump promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who would overturn #RoevWade, and I believe that's exactly what Brett Kavanaugh would do. https://t.co/lYgCJOXfHT

#RoevWade. Access to birth control. It's all at stake. https://t.co/9pWn9P4yq9
Brett Kavanaugh was handpicked by right-wing groups for his views on abortion rights. But let's be clear — ANY nominee who supports overturning #RoevWade or placing even more restrictions on women's access to #ReproHealthCare is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court; full stop. https://t.co/qZtGb5yj88
It is imperative that we protect access to safe and legal abortion because it is about protecting womens' lives.	https://t.co/qZwFVfsIKw

Thanks @KasieDC — I had a great time joining you tonight! Always love a conversation that can range from the news of the day to the Lakers. (LeBron's so good, he's practically the Serena Williams of men's basketball!)

@emilyslist I may have some fear, but I am motivated by hope. I am motivated by the energy I see every day at @emilyslist and on the ground everywhere I go. We are not passive bystanders, we are warriors leading the way. We can do this. We will do this. We must win.
@emilyslist And most of all, be kind to one another. This fight will be hard. So we must have each other's backs and we must be each other's shoulders. We will have bad days, but we will have good days too. Take care of yourself and your friends — we need everybody ready for this fight.

@emilyslist .@emilyslist has a very big map — including governors' races and state legislative races that are going to be even more important under a new Supreme Court. The key to stopping these bad laws from getting to the Supreme Court is to not have them passed in the first place.
I'm so proud of what my team at @emilyslist and our community have done this cycle. However, we must dig deeper now. We have to think every day now about what we can do to elect pro-choice Democratic women.
Trump has promised to criminalize abortion and punish women — and most of the Senate GOP is ready to fulfill that promise.
We cannot allow them to take us back to the time of our mothers and grandmothers on abortion access or birth control. This will be hard. Our hope is to take back the majority in the House and Senate to protect our nation immediately from Trump and the GOP.
Extreme right-wing Republicans have been masterminding the takeover of our courts for decades. When we told you the future of our Supreme Court was on the line in 2016, we weren't kidding. See the damage that's been done these past two weeks.
Even under the current administration, the past few weeks have been especially hard. We are all hurting. Your fear, which I join in with you, is real.
RT @emilyslist: Our own @Schriock1 is going to be on @TheBeatWithAri soon to talk about SCOTUS and the impact on #ReproRights — tune in.
Elections have consequences. The GOP will use this opportunity to nominate an anti-choice justice to the Supreme Court who will repeal Roe v.

36,000 women have reached out to tell us they want to run for office. Imagine how much higher that number could be next cycle!
But I've said it before and I'll say it again, this isn't a wave — this is a sea change. Did you notice our previous record was set the cycle AFTER the Year of the Woman? When women succeed, they inspire others to step forward and run for office.
You can't talk about a blue wave in 2018 without talking about the wave of women who are going to win back seats up and down the ballot across the country.
And that's just at the federal and gubernatorial level. On the state and local level, the good news continues! EMILY's List is working with 1,200 pro-choice Democratic women running for state and local seats.
Of these 70 women, 34 can flip red House seats and two can flip red Senate seats. That's enough pro-choice Democratic women to take back both houses of Congress. And seven can flip governor's seats from red to blue, taking back critical power in the states.
This is incredible — and we've got even more great endorsements on the way! 		Let's put these numbers in context. Because this is just one part of huge wave. Because something WONDERFUL is happening right now. https://t.co/Mq6Iywxarr

Tonight, Republicans cheered as Donald Trump celebrated the anti-woman, anti-choice agenda they peddled during his first year in office. But next year, that room will look very different. GOP approval levels are falling, incumbents are fleeing, and we will elect a wave of women.

.@CecileRichards has been an ally, a friend, and a true fighter for women and families. She has stood firm against a wave of GOP attacks, and fought so that "women's issues" would never be a sidelined issue. I wish her all the best and can't wait to see what she does next. https://t.co/VGgYZoSV38

@emilyslist Congratulations to all of the pro-choice Democratic women taking the oath today, especially the 13 women we endorsed and were proud to work with. Because of their passion and tenacity, Virginia will serve as a shining example as we look to make even more gains this year.
@emilyslist First, a record-breaking number of women stepped up to run, then voters cast their ballots for these leaders to become their champions. And in doing so, voters propelled these women to flip 11 of the 15 seats that went from red to blue on Election Day last year.
@emilyslist While 28% of the VA House of Delegates is not nearly a high enough percentage of women, this is how true change begins.
At @emilyslist, we know that Virginia will be the first of many states to elect a record-breaking number of women this cycle.

We stand with you &amp; look forward to the wave of women who will be elected next year &amp; for many years to come.

@emilyslist .@emilyslist is focused on electing pro-choice Democratic women because we know that those women will work to improve the lives of their constituents and women across the country.
@emilyslist While there are no winners in a situation like this, we are glad that Democrats are standing together to protect our values and we hope that Governor Dayton will appoint one of Minnesota’s many well-qualified Democratic women to fill this seat.
After far too many years of having no real voice in a system that failed them, women are increasingly joining together to speak out loudly and clearly against harassment, assault, and policies that have made these issues hard to report, and @emilyslist stands with them.

The GOP doesn't. And if they continue to advance an agenda that hurts women, they will have trouble recruiting &amp; electing women candidates.

We will mobilize each of those women to​ vote to​ replace Trump and any congressperson who refuses to stand up for women's health care.
Any attempt to roll back this protection is an attack on the 62 percent of women who are using contraceptives at this moment.
But we shouldn't have to explain this to Donald Trump and his GOP allies. Women should have access to the health care they need. Period.
Women use birth control for a whole host of reasons including:	✔️ Controlling ovarian cysts	✔️ Anemia	✔️ Preventing unwanted pregnancy. https://t.co/LbTTYowppi

Trump's priorities are clear from the promises he’s kept &amp; those he’s ignored. And he's not on the side of women &amp; families. #Trump100Days
He also reinstated the global gag rule, and made it worse than ever before. #Trump100Days https://t.co/nDv5uQ2Jz2
.@EPA @PPFA He appointed an anti-choice judge to the Supreme Court. #Trump100Days https://t.co/RsyPbN77M3
.@EPA He signed a bill allowing states to defund @PPFA. #Trump100Days https://t.co/GwCoNnOV6J
.@EPA So what promises did Donald Trump choose to keep? #Trump100Days
Trump promised clean air and water. His budget slashes @EPA funding to enforce those regulations. #Trump100Days https://t.co/GjbhJnlzPx
Trump promised to unlock the "technologies of tomorrow." Then he proposed slashing funding for biomedical research. https://t.co/xqA9eUOcd6
Trump promised to fix our infrastructure. His budget cuts the Department of Transportation's funding. #Trump100Days https://t.co/HHNu5dH4D0
And a #NewMomTax that could make women pay $17,060 more for even a complications-free pregnancy. #Trump100Days https://t.co/VTa5PIxRra
A health care plan that would increase costs catastrophically for the most vulnerable Americans. #Trump100Days https://t.co/qndKL7hZ9s
And waivers allowing states to avoid covering essential health benefits and pre-existing conditions. #Trump100Days https://t.co/ZVi9XCWQXz
A health care plan that would leave 24 million uninsured. #Trump100Days https://t.co/UyIhbanxYo
Trump promised "insurance for everybody" that would be "far less expensive.” What did we actually get? #Trump100Days

But Gorsuch will be no more than a rubber stamp for Trump's agenda. And McConnell had to change the rules to force him through.

4. #TrumpCare will cut funding for maternity care, birth control, &amp; Planned Parenthood. Basically, it's a disaster for women's health care.
3. Thanks to #Trumpcare, millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions won't be able to get affordable coverage.
2. #TrumpCare will cost more money, yet still provide fewer benefits. Millions will lose their coverage altogether.
Here's what you need to know about #TrumpCare:		1. #TrumpCare will cut taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the poor and sick.
This plan is dangerous, cruel, and WILL harm women and families. And @emilyslist women will fight this every step of the way.
It also aims to dismantle even private insurance coverage for abortions. So much for providing choice and options! https://t.co/UilQuAPbv6
This bill defunds @PPFA, which will keep thousands from accessing crucial health care. https://t.co/slVvStuM9L
And if that wasn't enough, the GOP took extra steps to attack women's health care access and coverage.

When someone shows you who they are, over and over again, we should believe them. This is the real Donald Trump.
And Trump's cruel, divisive rhetoric brings hate into our households, our children’s classrooms, and our communities.
A Trump presidency would send a message to millions of young women and girls that being held to a different standard is the status quo.
Donald Trump’s defining characteristic is bigotry. Paranoia and prejudice are the twin cores of his campaign, and of Trump.

.@HillaryClinton isn’t just talk. She’s told us what she'll do &amp; how she'll do it. And we know she’ll do it, because she’s shown us she can.
Anyone can talk a big game about what they would do if they were president. Not everyone can tell us how they would do any of it.
Not when it comes to making our progressive values a reality — or to breaking down barriers for everyone.
No one else in this race has the depth of experience she has. Not when it comes to domestic policy. Not when it comes to foreign policy.
Let’s set one thing straight. @HillaryClinton is, objectively, one of the most qualified people ever to run for president.

But they still face social, political, and cultural barriers that keep them from running for office.
African American women have a powerful tradition of making their voices heard at the ballot box

.@emilyslist is proud to have elected every Democratic African American Congresswoman currently serving. But there is still more work to do.
...African American women leaders have been champions for progress.
From Ida B. Wells and Shirley Chisolm, to the 19 Democratic African American women currently serving in Congress...

That’s why @emilyslist works to elect Dem women who stand with women like Lilly Ledbetter, leading the fight for them to have a fair shot.
Democratic women leaders know when women are paid less than their male colleagues for doing the same work, it hurts families and our economy
because he believes all hardworking women deserve fair pay – which is why women across party lines helped pass it.
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the very first bill President Obama signed into law
While Republicans continue to ignore the facts, the wage gap still persists and it’s the number one workplace issue for women.
Signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was a turning point in the fight to end gender discrimination in pay–but the fight is far from over
Thank you for your unwavering commitment to women’s health, @cecilerichards. Must read: http://t.co/defECYf6DF
RT @emilyslist: Programming Note: Our @etchaStech will be on @hardball on MSNBC tonight at 7:30pm ET talking about #Roe42. Tune in!
We will not forget that Republicans advanced this radical anti-woman agenda and failed to fight for policies to give families a fair shot.
Though the next election seems far away, women are watching.
It is clear Republicans' priority for this country is severely restricting women’s ability to access healthcare and control their own lives.
But today, House Republicans replaced that abortion ban bill with another that would ban federal funding for abortions.
Last night, when no one was watching, the GOP got scared their extreme abortion ban might isolate women voters &amp;cancelled today's vote on it
And it’s more important than ever that women vote, women run, and women lead.
Women’s access to healthcare is under attack in Congress and in statehouses from coast to coast.
Today–and every day–the @emilyslist community is grateful for the Dem women who stand up for our rights and lead our country into the future
But today the anti-woman agenda of the GOP majorities threatens these gains with relentless attempts to turn back the clock on our rights.
I grew up in a world after Roe, knowing that my sisters across the country and I could determine our own futures.
American women have made enormous steps toward equality in the 42 years following the Supreme Court’s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.
Make no mistake, the GOP will still vote on their anti-woman agenda tomorrow, and we will hold them accountable.
The GOP's extremism has caught up with them. Their dangerous abortion ban bill has gone too far. Women are watching. http://t.co/vVsV8kZZ2K

Debbie Wasserman-Schultz on Why the Democrats Need (and Deserve) Your Vote in November http://t.co/G8ad5nuPmC ^ @zerlinamaxwell
Georgia women and families are looking for solutions and Perdue proved he doesn't have them. #gasendebate
Perdue dodged the question on min wage, ignoring the economic realities of women who account for 70% of GA's min wage earners. #gasendebate
Perdue showed he has no answers for GA women and no answers on why his record of outsourcing jobs is something to be 'proud' of #gasendebate
2/3 of WV min wage earners are women. Tonight’s #wvsenatedebate showed @NatalieforWV is the only one will fight for women and their families
While Capito tried to blur her record on raising the minimum wage, she’s repeatedly voted against hardworking WV families #wvsenatedebate
Tonight’s #wvsenatedebate showed voters that Capito is invested in her political future for herself and big banks, not for WV families.

And come November, women voters will not forget that Republicans had an opportunity to stand with them and instead stood in their way.
Economic opportunity for women is a top issue for voters in 2014.
Ending gender discrimination in pay would improve the lives of working families from coast to coast.
But they chose to show their true priorities again by clinging to their extreme agenda at the expense of the millions of women and families.
Today Senate Republicans had an opportunity to vote for equal pay legislation and affect real change for hardworking women.
