@coolandbalanc A teacher teaches your children his values that conflict with yours.  Good or bad?
@coolandbalanc value changes and is a human judgment aiming for truth. It is not truth. Truth does not change.
@coolandbalanc What is fairly balanced is an interpretation done by people.  Do you want a Natzi teach your children about the true rule of life?
@coolandbalanc Example-Teacher hates a particular country and acts to destroy it.  But because of rules is required to teach it's greatness.  Good or bad?
@coolandbalanc Many disagree. Point-a teacher teaches by your rules of "life", but acts according to contradicting religious definition. Good or bad?
@ekaovta Yes, full time writing teaching tools ,  full time promoting/teaching your writing via https://t.co/hut56vrpr8.
@coolandbalanc Teacher teaching faith in a religious school by rules, but the teacher does not practice life dictated by that faith. Good or bad?
