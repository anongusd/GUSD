@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC Thanks to @RepRyanCostello, @AmyAHarder, and all of the panel experts for a great discussion! https://t.co/cVbT5Je337
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC David Blee: "Let's not forget R&amp;D and infrastructure. We have to remain the go-to country for any space we're in." Adds that we have an advanced test reactor that's 60 years old, and some companies have to go to other countries like Russia for experimentation with materials.
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC Shannon Angielski: "Finding ways to convert CO2 into other products."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC Christopher Guith: "Storage. It's needed across all generation types," and in some cases, "we're still using technology that's 60, 70 years old."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC .@AmyAHarder's next question to the panel: "What‚Äôs an area just getting off the ground where we have a chance to dominate?"		@vsiv's response: Technology that converts sunlight into fuels, as well as digital technologies.
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC .@AmyAHarder: "How many miles ahead is China in the clean energy race?"	@vsiv: ‚ÄúI reject the metaphor, because we don‚Äôt know where the finish line is.‚Äù https://t.co/Dfksvq46zQ
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber @US_NIC David Blee, on nuclear energy and nonproliferation concerns:		"The best way for nonproliferation to be strengthened is to have American companies in the global markets ... with their safety cultures."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber David Blee of @US_NIC: "The way we win isn't by trying to mirror Chinese policy; it's by out-innovating."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv @USChamber Shannon Angielski: "We have a real opportunity to get economic value from CO2 at broad scale that the Chinese don‚Äôt have, because of their geology and ability to access oil."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv Christopher Guith of the @USChamber Global Energy Institute adds: "China‚Äôs strategy about dominating the global export market is much different than its strategy on how it gets and provides its own energy."
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv "We tend to have much more siloed energy-sector policies" in the U.S. and see competing policies that can stifle innovation, as opposed to one core comprehensive strategy like China. - Shannon Angielski of the Carbon Utilization Research Council
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder @vsiv .@vsiv: The U.S. needs an innovation-focused grant strategy, and also needs to pursue rational trade policies that protect U.S. industries and generate new innovative advances.
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder What's making China win the clean energy race? @vsiv says that the U.S. isn't playing to its core competency: innovation.
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder .@RepRyanCostello adds, however, that no one is doing a better job of developing the next generation of clean energy technology than the American entrepreneur.
@RepRyanCostello @AmyAHarder .@RepRyanCostello: When it comes to creating/deploying clean energy technology, "the data suggests that China is cleaning our clock." Their investment in clean energy tech was $300 billion in 2016 alone.
