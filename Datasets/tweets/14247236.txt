I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life.
against the attacks by Mr. Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well.
I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family
I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear: As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable.
I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family ‚Äì and unleash his TV-lawyer to do the same.
As Exhibit 8 shows, I have provided the Committee with copies of Tweets that Mr. Trump posted, attacking me and my family ‚Äì only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family.
Mr. Trump called me a ‚Äúrat‚Äù for choosing to tell the truth ‚Äì much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government.
And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer ‚Äì trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel.
I am going to prison &amp; have shattered the safety &amp; security I tried so hard to provide for my family. My testimony certainly does not diminish the pain I caused my family &amp; friends‚Äìnothing can do that. And I have never asked for‚Äînor would I accept‚Äîa pardon from President Trump.
For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your ‚Äúfixer,‚Äù Mr. Trump.
To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most.
To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress.
Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made.
So I concluded Don Jr was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad‚Äôs desk that day‚Äîand Mr Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr was talking about when he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good‚Äîlet me know‚Äù
of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone ‚Äì and certainly not without checking with his father.	I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump‚Äôs knowledge and approval.
‚ÄúThe meeting is all set.‚Äù I remember Mr. Trump saying, ‚ÄúOk good...let me know.‚Äù	What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment
Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father‚Äôs desk ‚Äì which in itself was unusual. People didn‚Äôt just walk behind Mr. Trump‚Äôs desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying:
with the subject line, ‚ÄúDirt on Hillary Clinton.‚Äù Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened.
Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr. and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting
Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions.
He finished the conversation with the following comment. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm stupid, I wasn‚Äôt going to Vietnam.‚Äù	I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now. And yet, I continued to work for him.
Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment.
During the campaign, Mr Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and POW, Sen John McCain to be ‚Äúa hero‚Äù because he likes people who weren‚Äôt captured. At the same time, Mr Trump tasked me to handle negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft.
he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving ‚Äúsomeone like him‚Äù that much money back.
The sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite. When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees‚Äô salaries in half ‚Äì including mine
The irony wasn‚Äôt lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see in Exhibit 7, Mr. Trump declared ‚ÄúLet him show his records‚Äù after calling President Obama ‚Äúa terrible student.‚Äù
As I mentioned, I‚Äôm giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump‚Äôs direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump‚Äôs grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission. These are Exhibit 6.
When I say conman, I‚Äôm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores.
Don‚Äôt worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed- Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter.
So picture this scene ‚Äì in February 2017, one month into his presidency, I‚Äôm visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. It‚Äôs truly awe-inspiring, he‚Äôs showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect of...
The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY.
This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year ‚Äì while he was President.
account on August 1, 2017 ‚Äì when he was President of the United States ‚Äì pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me ‚Äì the word used by Mr. Trump‚Äôs TV lawyer -- for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf.
I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.	As Ex 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank
I did that, too ‚Äì without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public.
Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign.
I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms Clifford‚Äôs attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony.
Mr. Trump is a conman.		He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly ‚Äì and she did not deserve that.
When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it.	And yet, I continued to work for him.
And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming.
The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony.
Mr. Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon.
As I noted, I‚Äôm giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony.
I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony.
These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony. It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.
Mr. Trump is a cheat.	As previously stated, I‚Äôm giving the Committee today three years of President Trump‚Äôs financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes.
While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way.	And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.	And yet I continued to work for him.
He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúshithole.‚Äù This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States.
Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt that be great.‚Äù	Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries ‚Äúshitholes.‚Äù	In private, he is even worse.
Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign.
As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails.	In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump‚Äôs office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone.
But in the mix, lying for Mr Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it either.	A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr Trump knew about the release of the hacked DNC emails ahead of time. The answer is yes.
I knew early on in my work for Mr. Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous.
Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ‚Äúgreatest infomercial in political history.‚Äù He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign ‚Äì for him ‚Äì was always a marketing opportunity.
Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation ‚Äì only to market himself and to build his wealth and power.
and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings. Over time, I saw his true character revealed.	Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good,
I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job. Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life. At first, I worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions.
When I first met Mr. Trump, he was a successful entrepreneur, a real estate giant, and an icon. Being around Mr. Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself -- that you were somehow changing the world.
I got to know him very well, working very closely with him for more than 10 years, as his Executive Vice President and Special Counsel and then personal attorney when he became President.
For that reason, I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people.		Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr. Trump.
It is even more painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong.
Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1.		For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump.		It is painful to admit that I was motivated by ambition at times.
I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children‚Äôs friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own.
That is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need. Mom and Dad...I am sorry that I let you down.	As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help.
My father survived the Holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others. He was helped by many who put themselves in harm‚Äôs way to do what they knew was right.
To my Laura, my Sami, and my Jake, there is nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do to protect you. I have always tried to live a life of loyalty, friendship, generosity, and compassion ‚Äì qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood.
and a father to an incredible daughter and son. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would love her, cherish her, and protect her. As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, ‚Äúyou my wife, and you my children, are the air that I breathe.‚Äù
Over the past two years, I have been smeared as ‚Äúa rat‚Äù by the President of the United States. The truth is much different, and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself.		My name is Michael Dean Cohen. 	I am a blessed husband of 24 years
So I lied about it too‚Äìcuz Mr Trump made clear to me, through personal statements to me that we both knew were false &amp; through his lies to the country, he wanted me to lie. And he made it clear to me cuz his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress.
He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.
You need to know that Mr. Trump‚Äôs personal lawyers reviewed &amp; edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.		To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.
And then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.		There were at least a half-dozen times between the IA Caucus Jan 2016 &amp; end of June when he would ask me ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going in Russia?‚Äù Referring to Moscow Tower project.
Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That‚Äôs not how he operates.		In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there‚Äôs no business in Russia
I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false ‚Äì our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.
Before going further, I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole.		The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today, I‚Äôm here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump.
I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better.
Copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump‚Äôs direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.
A copy of an article with Mr Trump‚Äôs handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself‚Äìhe arranged for bidder ahead of time then reimbursed bidder from account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs
Copies of financial statements for 2011 ‚Äì 2013 that he gave to such institutions as Deutsche Bank;
A copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account ‚Äì after he became president - to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign;
I will explain each in a few moments.	I am providing the Committee today with several documents. These include:
I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is.		He is a racist.		He is a conman.		He is a cheat.		He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails.
I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty ‚Äì of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump‚Äôs illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.
and actually win. I regret the day I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way. I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York.
and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful. Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance
and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable
and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding. I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee‚Äôs questions truthfully
Here is Michael Cohen‚Äôs opening statement in full: Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats
NYT: Mr. Cohen also plans to say that as a candidate, Mr. Trump directed him to write letters to his high school, college and other entities threatening them not to release transcripts of his standardized test scores. 4/
‚ÄúStone told Trump he had just gotten off the phone with Assange and that Assange told Stone within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt that be great.‚Äô‚Äù 3/
‚ÄúIn July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump‚Äôs office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,‚Äù Michael Cohen will say tomorrow. 2/
‚ÄúAs I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails,‚Äù Michael Cohen will say tomorrow.
NYT: Tomorrow Michael Cohen plans to call Trump a ‚Äúconman‚Äù and a ‚Äúcheat‚Äù who knew a longtime adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks ‚Äî and who implicitly instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about a Trump Tower project in Moscow that was underway during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Putin threatened the US today.		Trump‚Äôs response?		Nothing.		Putin‚Äôs puppet said nothing about Russia threatening the US. Trump‚Äôs too busy obstructing justice, colluding with Russia, attacking the DoJ, FBI and the press. Biggest traitor ever. It‚Äôs time to #ImpeachTrump.
Trey Gowdy took bribes from an anti-Hillary group while investigating her. When he first got caught, he returned the money. Then he got the money via a different route. So, no, he shouldn‚Äôt be trusted. He‚Äôs a pathological liar. He‚Äôs as bad as the rest of them. Maybe worse.

Trump wants to distract from his abuse of power, so he accused Dems of abusing power. He wants to distract from a SNL episode, so he called for a probe in to the show. He wants to combat his bad press, so he painted the press as if they‚Äôre our enemy. This is what dictators do.
Trump‚Äôs pathetically tweeted five times this morning. Calling press ‚Äúthe enemy of the people,‚Äù plus ‚Äúrigged &amp; corrupt.‚Äù Said SNL should be investigated. Lied about his abysmal polling. Accused Dems of ‚Äúabuse‚Äù of power, to cover up the fact he‚Äôs abusing power. Sociopath-in-chief.

BREAKING: The House Judiciary Committee just voted to authorize a subpoena of Matt Whitaker, in case he refuses to answer any Trump-related questions tomorrow. All Republicans voted against it, because they know Whitaker‚Äôs testimony could implicate Trump in numerous crimes.

The DoJ is now investigating the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Which means Trump‚Äôs Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta is basically under investigation, as he was a lawyer involved with the case. Add it to the list of Trump-related corruption.
BREAKING: GOP operative Paul Erickson has been arrested for wire fraud &amp; money laundering. The indictment details 22 years of fraudulent behavior. Erickson had direct contact with Trump‚Äôs campaign. He‚Äôs the boyfriend of Russian spy Maria Butina. More Trump-related corruption.

He‚Äôs full of catch phrases and petty anger, and will be the greatest threat to America, until he leaves office. https://t.co/8OkyxIYXOP
Trump on Kim Jong Un: ‚ÄúI like him. I get along with him great. We have a fantastic chemistry. We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can't even believe it.‚Äù Gross. Trump only gets along with the worst people.
Trump on using US military force in Venezuela: ‚Äúit's something that's on the- it's an option.‚Äù
Trump rambles more on Mueller‚Äôs probe: ‚ÄúSo far this thing's been a total witch hunt. And it doesn't implicate me in any way. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing. Doesn't implicate me in any way but I think it's a disgrace.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs the disgrace.
Trump replies to if Mueller report should be public: ‚ÄúThat's up to the AG. I don't know. It depends. I have no idea what it's going to say.‚Äù Trump would only want it public if the report said four words: Donald Trump is innocent. Otherwise, he will try to bury Mueller‚Äôs report.
Then Trump lies acting like the Mueller Report exists and it already exonerates him: ‚ÄúEven the Mueller report said it had nothing to do with the campaign.‚Äù
Trump then goes on to tell one of the biggest lies in the entire interview: ‚ÄúRemember this. Remember this. There's been no president that has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.‚Äù That is a lie. Trump is the weakest president ever on Russia. By far. No close 2nd. Period.
Trump on Stone: ‚ÄúStone didn't work on the campaign (lie) except way way at the beginning long before we're talking about.‚Äù (Trump lies, then admits Stone worked on campaign) More:‚ÄúI don't know if you know this or not-Roger wasn't on my campaign except way at the beginning‚Äù (liar)
Trump: ‚Äúhad nothing to do with what they're talking about or there were people that got caught telling a fib or telling a lie. I think it's a terrible thing that's happened to this country because this investigation is a witch hunt. It's a terrible witch hunt &amp; it's a disgrace‚Äùü•¥
Brennan pushes back on Trump Calling Russia probe a hoax: ‚Äú34 people have been charged here. Seven guilty pleas.‚Äù Trump replies: ‚ÄúExcuse me. Ok, you ready? Ok, you ready? Of the 34 people, many of them were bloggers from Moscow or they were people that had nothing to do with me.‚Äù
Brennan moves on: ‚ÄúWhat surprised you about some of the questions that Robert Mueller asked you?‚Äù Trump replies by lying three times: ‚ÄúWell, look the Russia thing is a hoax. I have been tougher on Russia than any president, maybe ever. But than any president.‚Äù (3 lies in a row)
Trump: ‚ÄúThe African-Americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country.‚Äú (sounds racist as hell to me)
Trump on NFL: ‚Äúyou can't be kneeling for the national anthem. You have to respect our flag and our country.‚Äù (He still doesn‚Äôt get it. He never will.)
Trump on Mattis: ‚ÄúI wasn't happy with his service. I told him give me a letter.‚Äù Brennan replies: ‚ÄúHe resigned.‚Äù Trump replies: ‚ÄúHe resigned because I asked him to resign. He resigned because I was very nice to him ... I was not happy with the job he was doing in Afghanistan.‚Äù
Here is what is one of the most frightening quotes from Trump. When asked about have an acting AG, acting defense sec, acting chief of staff, acting interior secretary, Trump says: ‚ÄúIt's OK. It's easier to make moves when they're acting.‚Äù (consolidating power like a dictator)
Trump on trusting US intelligence officials: ‚ÄúI have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree.‚Äú
When asked if he will trust intel he receives from US officials, Trump replied with: ‚ÄúI am going to trust the intelligence that I'm putting there, but I will say this: my intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100%.‚Äù
Trump then says he‚Äôs keeping troops in Iraq. Brennan replies with: ‚ÄúYou're keeping troops in Iraq because you want to be able to strike in Iran?‚Äù Trump replies by saying: ‚ÄúNo, because I want to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is be able to watch.‚Äù
Then CBS journalist Margaret Brennan made this statement: ‚ÄúYou also campaigned saying that President Obama made a big mistake by telegraphing his military moves. You're telegraphing your retreat.‚Äù Trump replied by saying: ‚ÄúI'm not telegraphing anything. No, no, no.‚Äù
Trump on Senate condemning withdrawing from Syria &amp; Afghanistan: ‚ÄúI ran against 17 Republicans. This was a big part of what I was saying, and I won very easily.‚Äù
Trump on coming back to Afghanistan if he pulls troops out &amp; there is a resurgence of groups like Al-Qaeda: ‚ÄùWe have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly &amp; I'm not leaving.‚Äù (He contradicts himself in the same sentence. Such skill.)
Trump on Afghanistan: ‚Äúwe're negotiating with the Taliban." He was then asked ‚ÄúCan you trust the Taliban?‚Äù (Trump deflected, didn‚Äôt answer) Then was asked if troops pull out couldn‚Äôt we ‚Äúsee a resurgence of groups like Al-Qaeda?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll come back if we have to,‚Äù he replied.
Trump on Speaker Pelosi continued: ‚Äúyou have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi.‚Äù (huge lie) Trump on percentage of ISIS defeated: ‚ÄúWe're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100.‚Äù (another lie, he clearly made up this ‚Äústatistic.‚Äù)
Trump on Speaker Pelosi continued: ‚ÄúShe knows that we need border security.‚Äù (true statement) ‚Äúshe wants open borders.‚Äù (lie) ‚ÄúShe doesn't mind human trafficking.‚Äù (huge lie) ‚Äúshe's costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars.‚Äù (lie)
‚Äúthe only way you have a strong border is you need a physical barrier.‚Äù (lie) ‚ÄúYou need a wall.‚Äù (lie) Trump on Speaker Pelosi: ‚ÄúI think that she was very rigid.‚Äù (offensive) ‚ÄúI think she is very bad for our country.‚Äù (wrong) ‚ÄúShe knows that you need a barrier.‚Äù (wrong)
I took out quotes from Trump‚Äôs rambling Super Bowl interview &amp; posted in tweet string below, my notes in parentheses: ‚ÄúIt's national emergency‚Äù (lie) ‚Äúthere have been plenty national emergencies called.‚Äù (lie) ‚ÄúThis really is an invasion of our country.‚Äù (lie)
BREAKING: Trump made it clear in his #SuperBowl interview he‚Äôs willing to shut down the government again in a few weeks. The last Trump shutdown cost the US &gt; $11 billion. And hurt almost every American. Many are still hurting, and will be for months. No. More. Shutdowns. Ever.

Since Trump used his Super Bowl interview to lie about Speaker Pelosi, @CBS needs to allow the Speaker to have equal airtime to respond. Period.
The NRA's cover up of Russian ties just crumbled and the receipts prove it. Of course the gun nuts wanted closer ties with Putin through his spy Maria Butina. Click below to read more:		https://t.co/D77j0SlBSL

Speaker Pelosi is calling out @realDonaldTrump. Speaker recently asked "what does Putin have on Donald politically, personally or financially?" Also asked why Trump continued "to discuss pulling the U.S. out of NATO?" And asked why does he still try to "undermine" Mueller? Bravo.
Speaker Pelosi says "Roger Stone's indictment makes clear there was a deliberate, coordinated effort by top Trump campaign officials to subvert the will of the American people during the 2016 election." Then asks what Putin has on Trump. This is why Speaker Pelosi is our Speaker.

Let‚Äôs look at this clearly. Democrats passed GOP bills to open up the government. Trump saw it as an opportunity to leverage millions of Americans for wall money, so he refuses to open the government. Mitch follows his lead. This is completely 100% on them. They own this. Period.
Even if Democrats gave Trump him wall money, he wouldn‚Äôt open the government. That‚Äôs proof he wants it to remain closed. He loves the distraction, and is enough of a sociopath to get off on hurting millions of Americans. He‚Äôs a sick and twisted criminal. A pathetic traitor.
.@realDonaldTrump-It‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt intend to make any deal. You WANT the government to remain closed. You WANT to hurt America. You don‚Äôt care about the American people. Only about yourself. Get off you lazy keister and open up the government, traitor. #EndTheShutdown

Trump is denying paychecks for millions of Americans. He isn‚Äôt letting Americans get paid for their jobs. This shutdown exists because of Trump. And it rests on him and Mitch, and him and Mitch alone, to open it back up. It‚Äôs 100%, completely on them, to #EndTheShutdown. Period.
.@realDonaldTrump-If you‚Äôre not reopening the government, no one wants to hear from you. Stop holding millions of Americans hostage. Stop trying to leverage millions of Americans for your racist political ploys. We are happy to negotiate once you #EndTheShutdown. Not before.

Don Jr is a co-conspirator.
