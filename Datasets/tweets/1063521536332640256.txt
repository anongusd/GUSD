Muscle-cardio is where you train the mind to treat the muscles like a respiratory system.  Less injury, less recovery, no drugs.  Pushups are one basic part of successful implementation.  No need for crazy ab workout to garner a six pack.  :)

@sfchronicle Let's keep everyone impacted by the fire, smoke and their loved ones in our thoughts and prayers.

@nytimes @CNN @washingtonpost 		Standard form denial of claim for wrongful death.  I, along with his family, want closure and time to heal.  His wife is alive and 98 yrs old.  We will be seeking legal representation and perhaps class action status.		#johnchochafiles https://t.co/wZuWkwqGdT
