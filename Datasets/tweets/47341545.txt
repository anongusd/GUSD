@ningrim It's all abt how effectively you communicate reality to your district. If you run from it--like much of GOP--then you get hammered.
@ningrim I disagree. People are recognizing truth about sequester b/c some of us in Congress are willing to speak out.
In last 2 yrs, Congress &amp; Pres borrowed $2T+, increased spending, suspended debt ceiling &amp; blasted sequester--a tiny cut to spending growth.
During #sequester, spending goes up--a lot. Politicians freak out b/c spending goes up a little bit less than they want.
@robertcostaNRO #MI03 has no problem understanding sequester &amp; why it's not "devastating" or even a cut. Just tell constits truth; not hard.

RT @Judgenap: Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth. -Einstein
@Calanon24 Your image describing Ron Paul's foreign policy in colorful terms is pretty enlightening. Also, you cite Rep. Allen West.
@Calanon24 Yes. You've made them pretty clear. ;) I do appreciate the debate, though. You seem like a good guy.
@Calanon24 I agree. Hope debate has been helpful to others. Your views on foreign policy/terrorism may be coloring your interpretation.
@Calanon24 And I refer you back to my Note, which shows why that blog is wrong: http://t.co/MhY1Mjgp.
@Calanon24 Expansion is through "covered persons" under 1021. Sen. Feinstein's amendment to 1021 to "not extend to citizens" was DEFEATED.
@Calanon24 The "does not extend to citizens" language modifies ONLY 1022. Sen. Feinstein tried to add to 1021 but amendment was defeated.
@Calanon24 Here's the bill: http://t.co/qc3pu2cb. Read it. He's reading from section 1022, not 1021.
@Calanon24 He is reading from section 1022. That's the wrong section. Please read my Note: http://t.co/MhY1Mjgp. Keep an open mind. Thanks.
@Calanon24 He's discussing section 1022. As I explain in my Facebook Note, the problematic section is 1021. No protection for citizens.
@Calanon24 I'm also talking about 2012 NDAA. I'm referencing my Note so you can see my full argument. Which section of 2012 NDAA?
@Calanon24 And which section are you referring to?
@Calanon24 I again submit this: http://t.co/MhY1Mjgp. Sen. Feinstein's amendment to prevent indefinite detention of citizens FAILED.
@Calanon24 Which section are you referring to? And which NDAA? 2013 or 2012?
@Calanon24 #NDAA simply says it doesn't affect existing law OR AUTHORITIES w/r/t citizens. It says that while simultaneously expanding AUMF.
@Calanon24 #NDAA indefinite detention is about being ACCUSED of "supporting" "associated forces" of Al Qaeda--includes American citizens.
@Calanon24 Yes. I've read it before. The piece conflates the executive's claimed "authority" with "law." Rep. West makes the same mistake.
Would love to have your help on my campaign. Please e-mail volunteers@justinamash.com. Thanks! #JA4C
@Calanon24 Have you read this? http://t.co/MhY1Mjgp. Those who want to detain Americans are spinning #NDAA. I won't let them get away w/it.
@Calanon24 I'm sorry. You're just wrong. "Covered persons" is not limited by citizenship. And the 1st &amp; only federal court to rule agrees.
@Calanon24 @thomasmassieky @tedcruz Have you read Afghanistan AUMF? #NDAA vastly EXPANDS "covered persons" but CLAIMS to "affirm" AUMF.
@Calanon24 @thomasmassieky @tedcruz I suggest you spend some more time learning about it. #NDAA CHANGES law to violate due process in U.S.

@helensharvest @thomasmassieky @tedcruz Love Gohmert &amp; Landry, but their amend't does NOT protect anyone, not even citizens. #poorlydrafted
