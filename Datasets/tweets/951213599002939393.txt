The movement to reform SARS should be supported by all people of goodwill. Thanks to @segalink who is spearheading this with a lot of sacrifice.
It was hamatan and we were detained for three days before we were granted bail at N5000 each. Till today, the incident remain indelible in my memory. SARS needs reform. U can't just arrest a citizen &amp; assume he is guilty. Torture should not be used during interrogation @segalink
...played the game. I don't even know how it is played. But I admitted playing it because the torture was too much and unbearable. I was afraid I could die. And when I confessed what I didn't do, the guy stopped! @segalink
SARS interrogation is usually by fire by force. You will say what you did not do just to escape beating. The man that interrogated me was mean! He used folded iron to knock my hands and legs until I confessed to playing snooker and gambling, even though I have never @segalink
I was arrested too. I received several blinding slaps even before we arrived the station. We were bundled into a small cell that already had several inmates in it. We were denied access to our phones and none of were allowed to contact our relatives. @segalink
But before anyone could say Jack Robinson, everybody at sight was bundled into the waiting van. A particular man was shaving in saloon and he was arrested too, with his hair half-finished. Those at the snooker board took to their hills. The unlucky ones were nabbed.	@segalink
So I told the bike man to take me back. On our way, I saw my friend playing snooker by the roadside so we stopped. I alighted from the bike. I had hardly paid the fare when a SARS hilux van pulled over. I was still standing by the road trying to pay the bike man.	@segalink
I did not get to share my own SARS story, but I guess it's not too late. 	Sometimes in 2011, around Dec 17 or there about, I had an bitter encounter with SARS in Benue state. I boarded a bike from my place to see a friend. I got to my friend's place and met his absence	@segalink
