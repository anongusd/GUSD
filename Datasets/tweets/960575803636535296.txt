@dbongino haha!  oh, dang!    but... but...  oh!    thanks!    haha!

@VVulti yeah!  haha- he was a  funny kid!  he really made the show, if ya asked me!  but he grew up to be kind of , well, kind of a 'tough customer', that's putting it mildly!  i never even saw more than maybe one or two episodes of his 'reality show', -and a boxing match or two, haha
@M2Madness that makes me think of the tubes! 1982, the completion backwards principle- remember the song? 'let's make some noise' - right on~
if this makes you laugh, then it's good luck for you!  if you don't laugh, that's a good sign!  careful what you wish for! , she made the best album , it's debatable which track is the best, - but this one is solid!   https://t.co/yqXXtk2Jhw
@rsqk9s @wearewhatsdope gingers rule!  only in recent years, have i known it tho!  haha!
@Susieque817 haha- i heard that interview- and you'll see comments i made there, probably, if it's on you tube- the way i saw it, douglas was being kind, and more than friendly to jason, the ingrate, - it still looks rather foolish to me, how he had a closed mind from the first minute!

@Susieque817 maybe!  several other people have said that same thing to me, but they've never really been able to explain why they think that-  they seem like decent people to me, - but as for the 5g thing, i don't think they're playin'!  i mean, i hope we're safe and sound- what a world!
@KilllerBee777 yeah, aggression isn't cool!  defending yourself, or someone else, ain't 'committing aggression' - right?

@IvotedT well, 'we', indeed, as a country, definitely are slightly 'over a barrel' that way, -not cool, either!
@jessevanloozen @BarackObama i have to admit, back'n the 'day', i guess it was the late '90's, when i first heard marilyn manson, immediately it made me laugh, especially the 'cops and queers' thing, ah-hahaha!  just the irony of it, the irreverence- i like all kinds of stuff musically!
@jessevanloozen @BarackObama what a world!  there's a guy, on you tube, calls himself 'whatworld d' - don't know anything about him, but , a cool name...yeah, most people got *nuthin'* to say, - i wouldn't wanna be like that!   haha!  so you like a lotta noisy, industrial stuff huh?

@madamalu68 there's only two kinds of people, - those who  love xtc and then the other kind of people, haha!
@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact they all seem to have some sense of humor or irony that i get, from their words and tracks , and there's so many great artists and songs, more than i could recall probably, but none greater than xtc and the boys! when will he get the boys back together! haha!
@madamalu68 yeah, it was 1979, and what a year!  i was 13, 14 yrs old, but musically, what a year!  i can't believe i never heard a single xtc song until ten whole years later! i have since then made up for it, i suppose, by wearing out  many tapes and cd's, haha
@madamalu68 one of my alltime favorite tracks!  that drummer, that beat!  joe is another monster, i would love to meet, -or perhaps not, haha
@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact these guys can never know the real impact they made , with even the most frivolous or silly tracks they thought they were layin' down..  it would be impossible to fully grok!   i can't say enough about them, -and colin, he's a genius as well!
@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact i was always too easily distracted, and my energy wasted!  i hope some of it did somethin' for someone, but they'd have to have been there, haha, yes it's funny, but i don't know why, i see no irony in that..

@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact the hounds of winter was frickin' awesome, no doubt about that...and not a whole lot since then!  but what the hey, i'm old, and i've still got so far to go, the best i can hope for is to make one good musical joke

@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact what's really tricky is to set a record to stone, to be criticised forevermore!  how do they do it, how do they know when to stop tweaking it or adding stuff??
@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact yeah, there's different things to turn on or off...like musically is one thing, and like, romantically, i'll never understand, haha
@madamalu68 @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans @bellfact ..and complimented him for being one of the first who apparently knew it!

@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump yeah!  i mean, either it's important or it isn't- and it's far too late already, isn't it?
@DineshDSouza you've got a point there!   just what is it that can be done? , i mean the polarisation continues!   it looks like a heck of a year already! any predictions?
@xtcfans thanks, sir!  that's great!  happy new year and here we go~

@xtcfans where's all the fans, -one thing i always thought was, if there's any band as great as the fixx, it's only xtc and the boys, haha, thanks , xtc!
@xtcfans you're better than all the other guitar gods, dear gud!
@xtcfans the skylarking instrumentals are flippin' awesome!   don't know why i hadn't heard it! them voices sure hide a lotta nuance, and y'know, little cool things captured on that tyrant's tapes, haha--you know who i mean!  haha!
@TomiLahren phoebe was never the smart one!  haha!
https://t.co/ko78iiY6dX  for all my would-be friends out there, haha
@CjnycCj xtc has the best fans , i always knew that, just seldom met any! if ever!  i converted me brother, took like 20 years, but it's done!  haha!
@CjnycCj andy told me , when i asked, '' where did that awesome bass part come from, that colin did on 'mayor' '', that he had wrote it for colin and colin  pretty much followed the demo!   i was like, dang!
@CjnycCj i was like 24, when i first heard the mayor of simpleton and i was sure these guys were the best!  and i'll be 54 in june, so that's twenty-some years for sure! never did i forget xtc in my alltime favorite running list! it's taken all these years and i still find new old songs!
@CjnycCj @xtcfans indeed! if i'd've thought, back in the early '90's, i'd ever get thru to the man who sailed around his soul, i'd've started thinkin' of good questions , or somethin'!  hey sir! dream a little tune for ollie and me!  haha! and chris!  bless ya all!
@eddievanhalen HEY , CAN YA  TELL DAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER INSTALLMENT OF 'THE ROTH SHOW' , DID YOU EVER LISTEN TO HIS YOU TUBE SHOW? IT'S FAB!   ROCK ON, SIRS!
THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER ONE LIKE THAT ONE.....HAHA! https://t.co/yOTn16hvuF

@DineshDSouza woohoo!  excellent, man! thanks for the link!
https://t.co/lXWp2zTH6j     what's up with that!
@gestumpo @lesliegooch1 @xtcfans thanks--see i knew that!  haha!
@DineshDSouza don't misunderestimate the power of jealousy, indeed!
@lesliegooch1 @gestumpo @xtcfans i agree!  what's 'ws' ? , --remind me !
@xtcfans it's true, christmas is right 'round the bend, hint-hint!
@gestumpo @xtcfans wrapped in grey might be the greatest, the whole album is the greatest right up til quite awhile after that, come to think of it!
@gestumpo @xtcfans ho-opo-nopono!  what an interview, i wish i had heard this at the time, of course then who knows what sort of temporal distortion would've then occurred!  haha!  i was so right to say, these guys were the best, even then, when i hadn't heard half their stuff up til then!
@gestumpo @xtcfans this was my 27th birthday, never heard this!  a delayed birthday surprise!  awesome!  i was into xtc, big-league, even then, tho i had no idea how extensive their body of work already  was at the time!  - bravo!
@xtcfans oops!   sorry, i delayed again!  there's necessarily quite a delay regarding you and ourselves here in michigan, sir! i bet you've got some interesting memories of michigan, maybe detroit, lansing, or ann arbor or somethin' huh?
@xtcfans @DharmaDumbass it's so much more than just frets and notes- and you know it!
@xtcfans FIRST IT WAS STILL TAPES, IT WAS STILL THE EARLY '90'S...HAHA..RAG AND BONE BUFFET IS SOOO GREAT!  I WANNA GO BACK IN TIME! IN A WAY, THAT MUSIC CAPTURED AND HOLDS SOME OF THAT 'MAGIC' OF ALL THOSE HOURS THRU THAT MUSIC PLAYED - MANY MAN-YEARS, INESTIMABLE REALLY
@xtcfans I BOUGHT ALL THE CD'S I COULD FIND!  IF YOU GOT A PENNY FOR EACH ONE, I WOULD BE SURPRISED!  WHAT YOU GET IS A LOTTA THIS SORT OF THING, HAHA!  BUT I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH, SIR, ABOUT HOW YOUR WORK HAS IMPROVED THE WORLD ,IN SUBTLE BUT UNDENIABLE WAYS!
https://t.co/xso2F15dsk  the frickin' RICK- in 1990!
@xtcfans https://t.co/rFL5z5CUBh
@xtcfans the rick!  he gives lessons, and he's a bad mah-faulka!  https://t.co/psA1ZyjVu8
@BooMusicInc @xtcfans yeah prince was way better--no comparison, man!
@xtcfans yes he's good, i'm not disputing that!     but it's a big world, bigger than anyone seems to appreciate!
@xtcfans you obviously haven't seen and heard 'the rick'!
@xtcfans planet?  haha!  that's a good one, man!
@shytigercp @cmdocker @AnnCoulter @FreeWhiteMale joy is daft!  uy!
@cmdocker @AnnCoulter @FreeWhiteMale she's daft!
@AnnCoulter haha!  hey now!  ''oh behave!''
@xtcfans @tubeway @elllaguru2 wow, are you the one who did the cool iron maiden album covers?  haha!
@xtcfans @tubeway @elllaguru2 the guitar on 'blame the weather' , is so great!  i flippin' love that one, man!	  i bet that was so fun to get done...
@xtcfans @tubeway @elllaguru2 talented lad, you are, partridge!
@faceitfriends @dbongino i hope so!  but it's gettin' late!  isn't it???
https://t.co/wFcpKw73Vv   someone, get the app, and then tell me where i fall onto the 'philosophy map'!
@xtcfans indeed!  if you'd  never did another thing after that, you'd be no lesser a giant in the industry!
@xtcfans nice of you, sir!  but why give away all your secret codes!  enough already!  haha!
@xtcfans the 'grass' video looked fun...did them nice suits get grass stains, i bet?
@xtcfans yeah it's rather like asking, which particular color was used on this or that- or 'what sort of a paintbrush do you prefer?'  -- sorry, it would be funny to get so much of such  attention--i hate to be a pest! those songs have quite a life of their own! they still talk!
@xtcfans that's awesome!  i was just sayin'!
@xtcfans 'wrapped in grey' might be the best--i keep changing my mind!  i'll never forget the bittersweet feeling i had when i heard that the first few times...heavy!
@xtcfans chalkhills and children is just the awesomest--how could that ever be beat--that must've been a drag!  if you had any idea how frickin' great it was,  and it keeps gettin' better!  how does it do that!
@xtcfans 'blame the weather' is so bittersweet, isn't it!  i bet that was tough at times, seeing how awesome colin is,   -but you always seemed to be lifted up by it, -i wonder if you know how great you guys were or are, y'know, bein' so close to the center of the universe'n'all!
@Lerxst_Alex @xtcfans i mean i only 'discovered' xtc in 1989 thanks to mtv! so i guess it wasn't 20 years, haha, it was about 1976 when 2112 was the tape i'd play before school ,i was like 11....ok so that's 13 years i knew rush music before xtc happened for me
@Lerxst_Alex @xtcfans or maybe just keep talkin' to those of us he deems worthy!  that would be far superior in my view!   i think i talked to the real garth brooks, possibly once, but no way is this the real alex lifeson!  i wouldn't know what to say except i was a rush fanatic 20 yrs before xtc!
@Lerxst_Alex @xtcfans that isn't the real alex lifeson!  frickoff, ricky!  the real alex lifeson met the trailer park boys and actually worked with them!  yes-yes?
@lesliegooch1 @Lerxst_Alex @xtcfans how come i only saw one part of 2, i think only 'part 2'!  i'll look again!
@xtcfans @murraymeikle ...writing songs, i meant...i guess silence might help, or other times make things harder!
@xtcfans @murraymeikle you gotta meet sean if you ain't! julian is awesome too- songs might be easy to you, but to most mortals, a complete mystery! i'm sure sean is a huge xtc fan, i would be shocked if he were not!
@xtcfans what a cool-lookin' rickenbacker guitar huh!  y'don't see many of those, i mean i never saw one in real life!  i never saw *jack* til there was you tube and you!
@xtcfans haha--the hidden eyebrows is so cool, and funny!   the voice bit ain't bad either, wow!   i love mimicking too, but it's embarrassing, man!
@xtcfans i would love to jam with you, but would be embarrassed to play you anything but 'sedativeboy', recorded in 2000 by just me and me brother!
@xtcfans i meant, different recordings of ten feet tall...love it, love it, love it!  colin's so great, it's not like you need him, but, damn, he's a fine player and singer, just like you, and dave!  and the drummer is no slouch either- whether it's terry, prairie or whoever!  superb, man
@xtcfans ten feet tall has one solo that sounds really funny, and another one, very smooth and slick, almost too damn good!  that always made me wonder, who was doin' what, and when!
@xtcfans i watcched that a few times, i can't believe i never caught the bit about 'ollie'!  d'oh!
@xtcfans have you made a song called 'ernie' yet!  do it! do it! do it! do it!
@xtcfans sorry, man, i can learn it by ear- the ones i mentioned, angry young men and ten ft. tall, just the first 2 that popped into mind!
@xtcfans yes! watching/listening is like infinitely easier than counting frets and strings, haha!
@gestumpo @xtcfans best christmas song ever!  thanks for thanks for christmas!  it's nearer!
@xtcfans angry young men and ten feet tall, both colin songs, huh, did colin ever do any of that fancy guitar stuff, i always wondered if it was either you or dave, never thought it might be colin, but how would i know! love them in any case--i learn easier by ear or by watching it played
@anassau @xtcfans love that one too, it's one o'me favorites--my hundred or so alltime favorites!
@IanCapstick3 @xtcfans that one should be easy!  but nuthin' is easy as it might sound, if andy did it, i bet!  but i swear i hear an 'a', an 'e', and maybe some other chords, haha
@xtcfans dang!  sorry, did you do 'angry young men' yet--and i haven't even begun to attempt that one yet, haha-- that solo is so jazzy!  but wow, i just love that one- also 'ten feet tall', i always wondered, were these you or dave, , it don't matter, dave's great but he's no better !
@krassenstein he was neither the president, nor even a candidate, so unless you cvan find a real crime, just keep diggin'!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans oh, the culture!  i love it!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans yeah i just looked it up!   i've never seen one!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans haha- yeah
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans what the heck's a milk bar!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans the words just sound like gibberish, i can't discern the words!  must find the lyrics, it's that way for many songs and artists, for me, my hearing is also fracked, which doesn't help!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans can't make any sense of the verses! the chorus, i like!    haha!	 great video!
@a_gossweiler @xtcfans yeah...for decades, i've been telling people to listen to as much xtc as they can possibly find!   i guess it's like so many songs, an acquired taste--i'll try it again!  thanks!
@davidveitch @xtcfans you mean the 'walking on the moon' chord?  that one's different tho, right?
@xtcfans never liked that one!  one of the few songs i still just don't see the appeal of!  forgive me!  i probly just need more time!  haha  'respectable street', i immediately loved!  strange!
@xtcfans i bet dave tried to get you to make it into a real chord, or would only play the notes that sounded right!  just guessing!
@xtcfans hhaha!  i tried it, i see how it ain't so hard, it just sounds too wrong, man! i would lose the two hi strings, and that's a dissonant-enough sound, close enough!
@xtcfans whatever!  i don't know why anyone would bother with such a chord, chord fragments sound much better in any case!
@xtcfans very funny!  nobody would ever play that so-called chord!
@xtcfans no way! you don't play the 7th fret on the second string!
@xtcfans the drum tracks are flippin' pimp-ass-tight!  dang!  and that red stratocaster--oops the song cutoff!
@xtcfans https://t.co/PZK9kMgRZm that kid was flippin' good!  you gotta admit it!  he played all tracks!
@ShamanTbay hey medicine man! facebook is crap!  but then, so is frickin' twitter! frackett!  right?	   i wanna be rich!  i don't  wanna work-in-a-ditch!  https://t.co/PZK9kMgRZm

@xtcfans HEY SIR!   CAN YOU MAKE A VIDEO FROM THAT SHED, AND SHRED A LITTLE FOR ME, SIR!   THAT WOULD BE SO FLIPPIN' AWESOME...NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR THE LADIES-YEAH!  THAT'S IT!

@xtcfans you're not old, you're just ..well-seasoned!   haha-- i don't know how much more 'seasoning' i can stand, my own self!  taste is most of it i suppose!  haha!    do me a favor and don't get the band back together - that would be too good, fun,  and lucrative~ anyone can do that!

@xtcfans hey andy!  i just told someone how i believe in the power of rock-a-billy!	  plus i wanted to say 'thanks for thanks for christmas' !  serious!  so like, is there a story behind that song? it's so ambitious, it's so grand!
@xtcfans is that a  slightly melted gun--good show!    how are ya, sir!   yeah, it's a strange world, and a world gone strange, i can't stop listening to andy summers and so many of you english settlers, haha-- the golden age of wireless was good, wasn't it?  that guy is good!

@xtcfans i wish i could go back to 1982- hey you met thomas dolby, that guy is frickin' good, right?  i suppose for you, he's more just annoying, being one of your peers, well none are as peerless as you and mccartney, on the bass or any other track!  how's that ear, better i hope!
@xtcfans wow, i don't know if i ever heard any demo of the 'mayor of simpleton', - but i'm in backwoods, michigan, where not much gets thru to!
@xtcfans can't stop listening to you guys, and shawn lane!  i'm sure you know of that prodigy!  at best, i could sit in on the drums!
@xtcfans awesome, man!  i have a white one...it looks like a generic, copy of a precision bass, i guess? it's a little stiff, but that's why i prefer an electric guitar~!
https://t.co/SsRUyOvqGR  i wonder who would not love this brilliant piece of music!
@xtcfans oops, i'll have to read it, haha
@xtcfans hey andy- can't wait to listen to this!  the mayor of simpleton's got one of the coolest bass tracks ever-- what kind of a bass do you play, i mean when you play one?

@xtcfans and bruce cockburn, i mean, the world would be so inexplicably empty  or way different , to me, had i never had a tape of some of his stuff , once again...generously made for me by uncle jim when i was like 15!  uncle jim is old, born in the fifties!  haha!  [hey uncle jim]
@xtcfans and cameron hawkins, great bass /singer/keyboard song guy...  and saga!  those guys are awesome, i just know it!
@xtcfans but does not al dimeola frickin' take the cake, one way or another? i mean, damn!  since i'm 16 and i heard 'land of the midnight sun', i was like, dang!  and he only gets better -- kinda like you, mister ex-t.c.!
@xtcfans had i never heard the fm 'black noise' album, wow, how different would it all be, perhaps immensely, that drummer was somethin' else, nevemind the synths and the mandolin , violins, thos songs, wow and 'surveillance' is a flippin' masterpiece of epic proportions, o my gud!
@xtcfans sorry--forgot to ask about garth brooks--is he as cool as it seems, i mean he seems way cooler than he looks, to me, for some reason, haha! cool in the sense of, bein', i don't know, just articulate in one way or another, haha- not sure if it was the real chris gaines, of course!
@xtcfans sorry, did i mention frank marino, i listened to an interview with him, and that was cool as heck!  that guy frickin' *is* superhuman! just like shawn lane, you, sean 'the rick' rickman, and so many others, ok, i mean in the artistic sense
@xtcfans like all you giants, i just wonder where you get that stuff~!
@xtcfans the mandela effect comes to mind... remember martin deller?  he could've drummed for you, i would like to think i woulda recognised it!  wow is that cat the bomb--since like 1978 that i know of!
@xtcfans hey andy!  i bet andy summers is a huge fan of you and , y'know, xtc and the boys,haha!  frickin' 'world gone strange' is the coolest thing i've ever heard since 'chalkhills and children' -- don't you love andy summers' songs, some of 'em?  i sure as heck do!

@jbeez310 @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump it's real easy...people are afraid, and understandably so!  they need a lotta reassurance and that's still not a crime-   of course neither is insulting the frickin' president, i guess, nowadays, i personally would never dare! and how many ever spoke to baracko that way here?
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump just because he looks white, doesn't mean that's not an awfully racist insult!  but the president is a tough guy, and he probably laughed at that, see, he's a funny guy, and more people are appreciating that, thanks to twitter!
@realDonaldTrump if he's more compassionate and sensible, that's what counts! in that case, i have to say 'more power to him' hey what happened with 'yavanatti'?  (haha!)
@er_car @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump indeed!  to me, it's not about turning people away, but demanding respect! and appreciation for our generosity and hospitality and all, nothing personal, it's rather universal, right?
@GarrickRespress @Aydin_N1981 @KentSalsby @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump good points! nothing against them, or, y'know, communism and tyranny and all that, but we can do better! hopefully!
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump [help cover the cost], - is what i meant to say, it's nothing personal! he didn't say they would be cruelly and arbitrarily turned away!
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump didn't you hear what he said? i mean, to me it means, if we have to take their people, then they can help pay for i , at the very least!  since when have we not welcomed people all day and all night, nonstop, right?
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump seriously?  i could understand if you were talking to , oh i don't know, i don't wanna name names but, the frickin' Donald?  seriously?  y'know, he's a very forgiving guy, but i hate to see people take advantage of that!   hey, free speech is alright with me too,and good for you!
@realDonaldTrump aw, dang, sir,  i guess maybe that's fair, if we have to take their people, they can at least help pay for it--right on, sir, - say, i like the way you think!

@xtcfans @DonnaARees 'all things must pass' was great, but the best song is track 1 !  a more awesome song, would have to be on an xtc cd!  haha!
@xtcfans ever miss the benzos?  and there are legitimate uses of these increasingly illicit , benign substances...yeah, anything you do for a decade, stopping real suddenly's a bold move! i know, it wasn't volunt'ry! you're tough! you're awesome!

@xtcfans @Iamthebassman that makes me think of essence and personality- the inherent, and the acquired, right? who knows the difference - there's also  such things as real personality, and there's clearly the false personality, easy to see in one's mates, haha
https://t.co/cT8zbhV7P7   this guy got my attention even twenty years ago or more--and it was no harder to believe then than now- isn't it ironic!  but what does it really mean?  right?
@TimWThornton @xtcfans here in michigan, nobody messes with ted nugent, how ironic is that!  haha!
@xtcfans @TimWThornton take video!  yes!    hey i've got it, you had to write 'melt the guns' because you'd gathered your senses!
@xtcfans @leefer3 official-schmicial!  yeah, that's only after yer gone- and i don't wanna see it!
@xtcfans @mrpeavley i would hate that too, i mean fame, but no i wouldn't, i would use it for things no one's ever thought of!  like not very many people could get the attention of anyone who's anyone, for almost any reason, and i don't mean in a bad way! the power at yer fingertips is even bigger!
@IanCapstick3 @xtcfans @DJSteve8 oh i know!  i flippin' love that song and it's sad and it's heavier than almost anything black sabbath ever could do!
@xtcfans @DJSteve8 because a melted gun cain't hurt no one!
@xtcfans @DJSteve8 i know, it's quite the issue, of freedom and all that, controversial and debatable!
@xtcfans @DJSteve8 what  do y'mean?  what a classic!  '' ..and nevermore desire them!''	  y'gotta get 'em all, and then that would be fab!
@DJSteve8 @xtcfans that's right, steve! no 'date abate it'! any real fans are way too cool for that crap!
@xtcfans again, sorry! i cannot resist this twitter thingy, i know it must be annoying- but you're a good man, charlie brown, haha- forgive me!  feel better and then stay that way!
@xtcfans @leefer3 dang, man, i've had ear troubles since i was four!  sorry, man!  healing feeling-tones go out to you straightaway, all you'll feel is hopefully nuthin'~
@xtcfans eee-ooh!  hahaha!!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman it used to be so fun to record, i mean multi-tracking,  with the 4-track cassette player i had for a few years..all this modern stuff, all the advances but for me, it's almost  impossible, i guess that's what engineers are for! what's the easiest recording program or software?
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman access is everything!  but if i can play somethin' enough times, then it theoretically could not be forgot...usually, never get that far, haha- but that's life, it's a song, and it's progressive as frack!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman yes i have learnt that now a few times, haha!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman it's like 'who's that? -oh, of course, it's 'megadeth and the boys' 	 my old drumset had 'roy and the boys' printed on the front of the bass drum, the year was 1978!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman haha!  i miss them too, sir!  but you are and  always were xtc, it may as well have been called 'xtc and the boys', which i always jokingly called megadeth- like who names their kid megadeth, right?  (haha)
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman awesome! but,  i love *every* drum track and drummer who ever appeared on any xtc song!  they were perfect for those particular songs, as far as i can tell, -i'm actually a better drummer than anything else, but drums are so loud and bulky, y'know?
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman dang, man!  yeah, okay, i mean literally any other song would be easier!  i mean dang, sir!  	 if you say so!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman i'm only 53 now, so the best is yet to come, i feel it!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman i was gonna ask, did you meet prairie prince, after the album was done, and how freakin' great a drummer is he-- i was already a fan of the tubes even starting in 1982, in high school..i wish i'd known about xtc then! 1981 to 1990 was so good!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman ..just kidding, what i mean is xtc needs him, or else it might as well be called the partridge family or any other name, right?  and dave, dave is great, and he fit in well, i bet you all  learnt a lot from each other musically, no?
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman awesome! yes he is!  there's a guy on you tube, eleven yrs ago, did a great video playin' the bass part to that song, and it still knocks me out- yes i could do it, i'd rather do somethin' of my own -so you do need him, i knew it!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman yeah, sure! that's why anybody who's anybody, has guitar techs--haha! no, obviously, you're right, but it ain't that simple! like whichever guitar it is, i got a few, there's these  problems, usually a corroded bridge, or on an acoustic, it's just very stubborn, haha!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman yes...i'm not a real bass player, but if i got thru that one i would proudly call myself an accomplished bass player! it's just such a busy part, unlike anything i can recall- mccartney's bass parts were always so cool too weren't they? sorry, this is too cool-you are too cool!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman wow! and what about al dimeola! my brother and i met him once in about 1990 and he was so nice and polite as he walked away from us, talking and i was so embarrassed, haha, i couldn't really speak-  hey if anyone needs a guitar tech, it's me!  i mean i still can't set intonation~
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman by the way, 'spiral' is flippin' fantastic, that's you on the bass huh? i have a bass, i love playin' along to whatever's on,, the bass part is normally learn-able, but i'll never get thru 'simpleton' , haha--
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman pat metheny is still growing on me too, even after all these years...did you ever meet him, i would guess he'd be a huge fan of xtc!  no, i  can't play like him, but i love the sounds he uses , and he's just so unlike anyone else
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman i gotta do more demos me own self!  i got nuthin' but a lotta ideas that come and go, and because they never get captured, they might not return for years, if ever!  not that i can say i learnt much except a lotta words, and the idea of fearlessness from you guys- rock on!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman wow, seriously? that's incredible, maybe you don't need colin after all, haha!   sorry for sounding so clueless!  i remember that was the first thing i ever heard of you guys, in 1989 and i was like, 'dang!'
@Iamthebassman @xtcfans dang, adam, it's not like he went anywhere- heck, i still hope for more great songs whether they can do it in the same room, or not, haha!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman where did colin get the bass part for the mayor of simpleton? i mean wow! it still confounds me, how and why he chose the particular notes he did, so damn perfectly and gracefully !  dang- honestly!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman another authentic psychedelic album is now overdue, sir!  just sayin'!  by the way, thanks for the stuff you were able to get done- you make it look easy!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman awesome guitar sound on 'ordinary people, ( i'd've made it slightly louder) great vocals, colin always was a fine vocalist--i gotta go hear what he's done recently, i heard an interview about him and t.c. was it?  every drummer you ever used was also the best!
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman 'say it' is flippin' beautiful, it's sooo colin!  it's therefore, sooo xtc!	  the 'ordinary people', i gotta listen to again!  and i'll come back and give you my impression...i was just listening to 'all of a sudden' - wow that ('settlement') album was just so awesome too-all are
@xtcfans @Iamthebassman thanks for bein' such a damn fine andy, the best andy i ever spoke to in many decades, i have, or had,  a friend , from school days, named adolph, but everyone called him andy, i guess he didn't like his name for a long time, haha, i can't imagine why!

@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump good question- and i don't think we really know- like how do you know?
https://t.co/pQJeko2Md9   wow....
by the way, shawn is playing all tracks, including drum-sounds with a keyboard! 	    this is a masterpiece!  	 https://t.co/aZkvb4V0ht
@xtcfans haha-  i mean if i could make instruments or like, anything, that would have been nice!  i can't even make a listenable song so far--haha!
@xtcfans how ahd where did colin get that bass part for 'simpleton', it's frickin' incredible, i'm still confounded by it, and shall never be able to call myself a bass player because of it!
@xtcfans sorry, it just knocks me out that i got to speak with you, man, it's even cooler than when my brother and i met al dimeola in about 1989,he walked away from us but was polite, haha- i had never heard of xtc until 'the mayor of simpleton' was on mtv, and i was immediately a fan!
@xtcfans wow, that ollie guy was frickin' outta sight! the drummer's not too bad, i guess, the bass reminds me of noel redding a little bit....  yeah, i sometimes wish for my own thing or instrument, so that no comparisons can rightly be made-comparisons are discriminat'ry by definition!
@xtcfans i like a warm, fat guitar sound...yes, to be able to cut thru the noise, in a song, would help, but i just love this old spider amp someone gave me, i just wish it had a bit stronger of an echo-effect, -finally i can try the u-2 stuff i always loved!
@xtcfans it confounds me where a song comes from, or how one can isolate it, from all the constant noise and, y'know, yeah, noise that we're immersed in....it's a mad skill, and i bet  a good singing voice would make all the difference- and the ability to ignore noise
@xtcfans well i bet sean would love to meet you! i can't imagine he would not be a yuge fan of you and the boys, like most anyone with an i.q. above room , or tropical temperature, haha
@xtcfans yeah...i remember when i thought jimmy page was a prodigy, and he was, but y'know what i mean, there's more categories than are recognised! you worked with julian, wow!
@xtcfans ollie yet? you mean the patto/? yes, i heard the two songs you mentioned- how cool is that! and i was seven yrs old in 1972, but i knew who dennis dunaway was, by like 1973, haha
@xtcfans 'focus 2', the song,  stands on its own, like where did they get this from- it's like right outta the fourth/fifth dimension, man
@xtcfans to me, it can hardly get any better than 'mermaid smiled' or 'pleasant valley sunday' , what is it about a song, do you ever wonder if it's finally been exhausted, and the best anyone can do now, is hardly original?..but then there's xtc!
@xtcfans air raid shelter...1971...wow!  the 'moving waves' album by focus, is a favorite since i was like eight years old, in 1973, haha, and yet i never even heard of Patto!  i wonder who and what else i've been unaware of--haha
@xtcfans WOW, HE PLAYS LIKE JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, BUT MORE MELODIC--HAHA
@xtcfans wow that's old-school, RESPECT!
@xtcfans pretty jazzy! i'm listening....  who are they, where are they from?  that sounds like a guy,or a gal,  i could either be a drummer for, or maybe a bass player for, haha, i love drumming and love playin' bass, but it starts and ends with the guitar for me
@xtcfans yesterday was sean- and john lennon's birthday- and i didn't forget..	  isn't sean the greatest?  have you heard his first couple albums?  flippin' incredible!  julian is also great- i don't think we thought we'd ever get this old!
@xtcfans lookin' that up--thank you, sir! with a capital 's'!
@xtcfans but to me, frank marino shreds the blues harder, more gracefully and the toughest, all while singing and bein' the frontman, he's frickin' super-human, did you ever meet frank marino? is he a great guy , i bet he is
@xtcfans even in 1978, i remember a guy told me about rory gallagher, and it was only recently that i watched and listened to a couple things on you tube- isn't you tube the greatest??  it should be easy to beat, seeing how crappy they are to their users, their creators and the audience..
@xtcfans jamie west-oram is one of my favorites- how does he, and several others, make the stratocaster sound, all their own, yet it's obviously the stratocaster sound.. my peavey 'strat', it's more fendery than a fender with the single coil pickups-three of 'em..it needs repair too
@xtcfans but alex lifeson, and so many other players, make the whammy not only desirable, but frickin' (unless yer buckethead), it's a handicap not to have one!  not fair!  justice will be done, and it will be far too late, haha
@xtcfans how did i know you'd say that-- because it was obvious! you're just too sensible!  that's great..yes, a les paul really can't be beat, in the hands of al dimeola, or even a jimmy page!    that rory gallagher, sure enough, like you said, is frickin' perhaps the greatest! irish too
https://t.co/NPk5ZBI8od
@xtcfans haha--pat with a capital 't', for 'tops' i suppose...i mean a capital 'p', the frickin' maestro!  and then there's al dimeola....these guys are just too damn good!  shawn lane was something else entirely! had all their ability, and more! you know the 'powers of ten' album, yeah?
@xtcfans sorry--i have been watching/listening to a lot of pat metheny, wow, that guy is frickin' cosmic in his frickin' abilities...makes me wanna just be a drummer, or better yet a critic- but next to pat, with a capital t, no one can literally compete! i know, it's not a competition.,
@xtcfans some of the best songs, i bet, come directly or indirectly from the profound frustration, that only a lady, or a guitar can 'gift' us with, god bless them!
@xtcfans i want an old-fashioned one, y'know, vibrato-bar thingy, - like jimi played, or a bigsby, like george would've had, it cannot be worse than some of these 'modern' marvels, good for nuthin' but hangin' on the wall ,haha
@xtcfans aren't 'floyd roses' frustrating, the two i have had, never did what they were supposed to do...actually first it was a kahler, then a floyd rose, then another floyd rose..apparently when dropped and knocked around, they're not real durable...intonation is a real itch-bay!  haha
@xtcfans not instruments--instrumentals!  sometimes with vocal bits--haha! thanks, yeah, i need one guy who can make a damn guitar playable!
@xtcfans have you heard sean 'the rick' rickman , that kid is awesome, he was the drummer for shawn lane, the prodigy guitar guy you must have heard--yeah that was 'the rick' on some of the live shawn lane performances on you tube- mind-blowing! well the rick still sings and writes songs
@xtcfans EXCELLENT! it must be so satisfying, to be known as one of the greatest songwriters of all time-if not *the greatest*, as the guy from the crash test dummies rightly said, decades ago!   i never even wanted to attempt that fine art, i do like making drum bits,and instrumentals
https://t.co/hkt1B2PEa7  THIS BAND WERE THE BEATLES OF HEAVY METAL! EVEN IN LIKE 1976!
@xtcfans i keep listening to 'once upon a long ago', and i'm sorry, none of paul's work since then has anything like the magic that that one has!   but the latest one is not bad, i must say, the egypt station, heard it once now...i shouldabeen a critic!
@xtcfans hey andy! i still can't believe it's you!  to me, it's in poor taste to ridicule anything to do with xtc, i see fans of xtc being a better sort of people, - not the same thing as beatles fans [who's anyone and everyone,-even the  georges bush jr. and senior], haha-

@xtcfans FORGIVE ME, MAN!  BUT THIS IS A FANS PLACE TO TALK,RIGHT?  AND THANK YOU AND WOW, EVEN POSSIBLY  GET TO HEAR FROM YOU-- HOW FLIPPIN' COOL IS THAT!
@xtcfans OOPS, I MEANT ON THE RAG AND BONE BUFFET, WHERE THERE'S THE COOLEST VERSIONS OF THAT AND SOME OTHER SONGS...REMEMBER?  MIGHT BE THE SAME DRUMMER AS THE OTHER ONE WITH THE STRAIGHT BACKBEAT...RIGHT?
@xtcfans QUEEN WANTS A CASTLE!
@xtcfans '...bopo-bo-bo-bo down in the cockpit...''       ........haha!  i still have to laugh everytime i hear it!  that drum track--who was that??
@xtcfans man...  i had to listen to 'gallows pole', after you said, y'know, you've gotta enjoy what you do, even if you're a hangman, haha...   i always called xtc the modern beatles, - no pressure, - how's colin these days, he's got terry drummin'! you know you wanna ring 'em up!  do it!
@xtcfans i thought it was supposed to be the new age...  i guess 'in this new dark age, we're all light' -  right on, man! melt the guns , 	  say, was that your solo in 'angry young men', or was it dave?  you guys are both great- thanks for all that, and i wish you'd got paid better, sir!
@xtcfans i don't think it would be possible to get a boring interview of you, sir!  -i've never heard one yet, i hope you'll do it again  soon!   for the fans i know are out there!

@realDonaldTrmpu the same punishment?  maybe!  definitely they should face some punishment, -if, like you say it's proved but what's proven anyway?  i can't prove the earth isn't flat today and neither can anyone so there's somethin' to think about!   plus the moon landings are a joke!
@dbongino good point! it's like, i hope they don't think we don't see what they're doing!  obviously they think we're stupid, and that they're a lot more clever than they really are
@xtcfans -forgive me!  an actor or pantomimist huh- see, i thought it was like an old-world mortician or something like that...anyway, i don't have to tell people here, to get the mummer cd, even better than old cassette tapes now-- anyone not knowin' that one, get it 'n' you'll be glad!
@xtcfans haha-- for years, i never knew what was a 'mummer', i reckon i never thought about it,~ to me, it was just my favorite tape for years and still probably is!  i literally would wonder, but don't recall looking the word up-- maybe i thought it was a 'nonsuch word'-- i don't know!

@xtcfans @ElGoodo63 @FineFarraFellow me too!  i mean i remember the magazines, i was like eight, nine, ten  in like 1973,74,and '75  when they were the best, weren't they? - i wonder if dennis dunaway was also a fan of 'mad'-- i don't see why he wouldn't've been!
@xtcfans no way!  you're really andy??  that's amazing!  like, i spoke to a few different garth brooks', but never did i really think it was him, - he would surely have better things to do than speak to me- so this cannot be you, - right?
@ElGoodo63 @xtcfans is there anything cooler than an sg?  apparently, frank zappa, frank marino, and robbie krieger thought not!  i want one of them prs things like al dimeola and carlos santana were seen playing the last couple decades, right?  they look nice and user-friendly--

@xtcfans i always looked up to you guys, xtc, it always felt like you were having such fun recording, i'm always wanting to do it, and 'rag and bone buffet' was my favorite tape for years and years, i always thought it was 'down in the carpet', haha and the mermaid-just wow! what a tape!
@ElGoodo63 @xtcfans that dave is one classy city-slicker, idn't he!  does he always play a 'rick'?

i think it's sad how the mainstream news is allowed to lie to the people, so that half of them, or more, actually believe a bunch of lies- while they call trump a tyrant, there's some irony for ya!  if he would just be a tyrant for a couple days, he could greatly improve our gvt

there's a new aristocracy...the top ten percent...how many of us fall into the bottom 90 tho, right?  we who have twitter, are the privileged!  but it's a big subject, worth thinkin' about and debating- to me  https://t.co/4akpVtVoV9
even if it means nothing, that's highly significant tho- think about it! https://t.co/Az79JoZfpm
@JohnCoo38695683 @drmistercody @marklevinshow @benshapiro haha!
@ThatChristyChic @marklevinshow @Acosta @CNN haha!  i love that!
@realDonaldTrump forgive me - i wonder if anyone really will see this anyway- many times i have heard that the 'bikers' are a great bunch of people, and i'm inclined to believe it, they have a 'code of ethics' , of sorts, better than the 'political class' and others seem to 'employ'!
@realDonaldTrump ..what's being called 'trump derangement syndrome' is actually a manifestation of cognitive dissonance, and from network to network, or person-to person, there's profound differences and so it makes for a lotta confusion..we can agree to disagree- we should, in so many cases,no?
@realDonaldTrump DON'T -oops- don't you sometimes wish we could edit our posts here, i hate the 'permanent typo', especially in anything of my own! but i don't own anything i've said, i merely act like a critic, it's my gift to the world, if you will
@realDonaldTrump HEY SIR!  DON'T MIND THE BLUE MEANIES! THEY'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE THEY WERE SO WRONG AND THEY STILL DON'T WANNA ADMIT IT- IT'S COGNITIVE DISSONANCE, NOT REALLY PERSONAL!
@marklevinshow hey sir(s)!	 frack macosta in any case!  why would you even consider doing such a thing- having him on-unless it were to publicly ridicule him- y'don't need him on the show to do that! i thought you were a writer!  use some imagination!  haha!
@PafuncioBear @WeAreOne_Q oh, you mean 'q'?  i think nuthin' could be further from the truth! i think every post, or nearly every post, is chock-full of meaning(s) !
everyone always seems to have their mind made up , no matter what the issue, are there no skeptics, no genuine seekers left ?
@PafuncioBear @WeAreOne_Q no! there's so many levels of meaning, it's staggering!
@graves_lynna @30ingoal @Jim_Jordan yup...some people have no idea, the difference between friend and foe-it's regrettable!
@Jim_Jordan sorry, jim, most americans don't understand anything, and they literally don't even know who their friends are, half of them!  oh, the irony!
@Jim_Jordan dang...there was a time when it was out of the question, i wouldn't even consider listening to rush limbaugh- y'know what i mean?  but that was a very long time ago, y'know what, i'll try and listen! i may have more to say later! thanks, jim!
well??  what's the latest?  is this thing *on*, by the way...?
dang, sorry to all you folks in disaster areas- what the heck kinda twilight zone are we in--forgive me, here in michigan we're a little isolated, it's been warm but , can't complain!  anyway, godspeed, help will be there-  hold the line!
@realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo end the witch hunt!  have they no decency??
@WeAreOne_Q how long have we got?
@PafuncioBear @WeAreOne_Q you have it!  you have more than you flippin' know!
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump @MariaBartiromo you said it,- whoever ya are, q!    lee stranahan should look a little closer- right?
not that it matters, but i thought trump always had the biggest crowds, including in washington,d.c. on day one, there, i wanna see all the 'security footage', have we ever gotten an accurate count in any case?
@realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger ..and what's the deal with new sanctions on russia, the lady couldn't even articulate what the goal of all this nonsense is - almost as if they wanna start more conflict! i know you would not want that!  right?
@realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger Dang, it, sir,  this thing called 'trump derangement syndrome' is like a real thing...might it have anything to do with all the pollution? , -i slightly think so... our minds are so polluted with so many distortions!
@TraceyWitt64 @2021_free @realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger Say!  that's a good idea, why not put the news on the internet where it can be updated and corrected, in a much more efficient and timely manner! good shew!
@Jim_Jordan @jack frickin' frackers, man, that is not cool  and i guess , what, they think we're a-stoopid?!     ~ and i guess in too dang many cases, as lebron might say, uh, we is!
@DineshDSouza I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE INDEPENDENTS!  TOO MANY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE, ONE FROM ANOTHER!  WE DESERVE FAR BETTER!
@2021_free @realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger TRUMP IS RIGHT! THEY'VE MADE FOOLS OF US FOR LONG ENOUGH- SORRY, CHARLIE!  NO MORE!  (HAHA!)
@2021_free @realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger HEY, IF THEY'RE LIARS, WE DON'T NEED THEIR SNAKE OIL ANYWAY!  WE HAVE THE INTERNET , WHICH IS THE CLOSEST THING TO A 'FREE PRESS' THERE WILL EVER BE- WE NEED TO KEEP THE INTERNET FREE AND OPEN, -TO DEMONSTRATE HOW A FREE COUNTRY'S SUPPOSED TO WORK!
@realDonaldTrump @GrahamLedger THAT'S RIGHT, THE FAKE INVESTIGATION(S) OF HILLARY AND CO. , NOW HAVE TO BE RE- DONE PROPERLY AND SO MUCH MORE!  STRANGE TIMES WE'RE IN!  DANG!
ARRRRIVA!  AY AY AY AYAYAYAYAYYYY!
https://t.co/nYBW6rEVJ6  YOU'RE A BLUEBIRD, YOU'RE A BLUEBIRD, YOU'RE A BLUEBIRD,  YEAH, YEAH , YEAH...
what a song!  i dedicate it to all the people tryin' to get into the country--i wish them wellness and prosperity, wherever they end up!  like i wish for everyone!  AARIVA!
matter of fact, neither is 'lawrence o'donnell' , that other crazy person on whatever channels they're found on!
rosie o'donnell is no relation to me!  and i want people to know that!  haha!
https://t.co/ZmPretMsGW
@DineshDSouza yup!  obama's  guilty of so many crimes! one of them is appointing hillary to any position in gvt.!
https://t.co/W4rjPlChWc
@De_Naga_ @vbspurs because look how they behave! that's just how they are!  (hhahaa)	  racism is bad- but not really, not unless it's from the whites!  it's impossible for any but whitey to be racist- because 'institutional' and 'professors' !  get a education!
@JimKuther @Jim_Jordan frickinay!  we need it done yesterday!
frickinay!  now's your chance, perps, to runaway to some foreign land, far, far away! https://t.co/nUKtSq0BQ1
@taraloveheart @earthascends @IsaacKappy @jack dang!  i don't wanna believe it! y'know what i mean?  i'm listening, i'm listening...
@taraloveheart @Corey_Feldman oh wow, well i guess that's not surprising, given what isaac said, but was that after he'd been blocked, or before, and maybe i didn't even hear anything yet!
@taraloveheart @Corey_Feldman hey, what's that, is that corey's tweet you're showing there, what are you sayin'?
@Corey_Feldman hey corey!  so how's the band, y'know i was thinkin', nuthin' against young girls, but they might not be the best candidates for a world-tour, i mean, the chances of an all-girl group being the best possible group, seem slim, but you just keep rockin'!
@Corey_Feldman hey corey!  isaac kappy's not a bad guy, is he?   i think you should straighten out some people who seem confused!
@IsaacKappy @jack indeed, good question, why would it be controversial,- unless there's people against peace and love!   like who's against peace and love?    that's about as politically incorrect as it gets!
@earthascends @taraloveheart @IsaacKappy @jack dang...i can imagine how it might be really 'complicated' for corey...  if i were him, i honestly don't know what i'd do- well, maybe i'd go public and talk to isaac, yeah, that's what i'd like to see!
@PatriotTrumps @taraloveheart @IsaacKappy @jack i hear people disparaging isaac, and i can understand why, but until there's real evidence, you can't just believe the detractors! c'mon!  ok, what have you got, nobody wants to be wrong, right?  until proved otherwise, isaac's one of the good guys!  that's what i'm sayin'!
@nata5jaa @IsaacKappy @jack dang!  i don't wanna believe that!   nobody's perfect, but they can still do the right thing!
@IsaacKappy @jack i wonder how corey is and what he's been up to lately!
@IsaacKappy @jack hey!   have you ever met corey feldman, and what do you know about him?
@DineshDSouza not to change the subject, but trump needs to be talkin' more about obama and hillary's criminality,- sorry, dinesh, no offense!  haha!
@OfficialSting @DiRealShaggy that's not shaggy, is it? from the 'insane clown posse'??  good stuff!  haha!
@tferriss @copelandmusic dang...  well it sounds like quite a history...   sounds like we were all extremely lucky, more so than we ever knew!  we're all lucky that miles, ian and all the others and you were even born!   the world would look and sound a lot different ,had it gone another way, no doubt!
@copelandmusic hey sir!   what's gonnabe loud, what's gonnabe loud--ok, i'll go look/listen!
@MurrmanMurray @FoxNews @Scaramucci @JudgeJeanine WELL, NOW, IT'S TRUE, THE CRIMINALS JUST HATE TRUMP!
@Navigat95831770 BUT IT'S THOSE SINGLE-COIL PICKUPS THAT ARE THE FENDER SOUND, AT LEAST A VERY BIG PART OF IT!    NO GUITAR SOUNDS BETTER CLEAN, WITHOUT EFFECTS, THAN A  STOCK STRATOCASTER!  YEAH, THE OTHER KIND SOUND ALRIGHT, AND MOSTLY IT'S WHO'S PLAYING, THAT DETERMINES THE SOUND ...
@Navigat95831770 LOVE THAT GUITAR!  MAN, I WANT A REAL STRATOCASTER, WITH THE WHAMMY BAR....MAYBE SOMEDAY...
@Navigat95831770 I HAVE A PEAVEY GUITAR, LOOKS SIMILAR TO A STRATOCASTER-AND I SWEAR, IT SOUNDS MORE FENDRY THAN EVEN A FENDER DOES!  IT'S FRIKIN' AWESOME!  EXCEPT, IT'S MISSING SOME LITTLE PIECES OF THE ADJUSTABLE BRIDGE AND INTONATION IS ALWAYS A DAMN PROBLEM!
https://t.co/OZTWj8ANfZ
@LionelNation @realDonaldTrump hey nation!  get to the point!  and don't you 'tweet', bro?
@Deirdre10025Rad @AnnCoulter I BETCHA HE WRITES A BOOK , ASSUMING HE SURVIVES THIS FIASCO!  HAHA! ~~~ARE YA KIDDING? HE'S A GENIUS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER, THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S DEBATABLE
@AnnCoulter i should say, AN enemy of the people, not THE enemy! even if some of the people working for an  enemy don't know it, they're still 'working for the enemy' , it's not really debatable
@DineshDSouza by definition, i'd call any enemy of the truth, definitely an enemy of the people- especially hostile organisations like cnn, msdnc, etc.
@AnnCoulter oh, the irony!  right?  the haters gotta hate!  trump bends over backwards for a country full of ingrates, and what does he get for it, more hate , he should write books like you, ann, if he survives his current gig!  few people are more misunderstood than you and trump- if any!
@AnnCoulter we know that cnn is the enemy of the people, just as sure as they're the enemy of trump!  this is probably true of all the 'networks' , i'd like to see any exceptions , i doubt whether they even exist!
@DebbieVaritek @PressSec you mean he conspired  like hillary and obama did?  no, actually he didn't
@SherrieBabee @PressSec it's the hate!  the hate causes derangement in the 'resistance' to law and order!
@PressSec oh i know!  some people would just  rather be haters than lovers, i guess!
@MCJeffry @DanteUSAInferno and you might be a trump supporter yourself, if you were against criminals!  haha!
@ConanOBrien (..i was just tryin' to ask him about the song 'nobody knows', specifically, what was he lookin' at...)  he's another finny guy, hihihihih! --carry on, sir! and give our regards to all the rock royalty!
@ConanOBrien great one, man!  hey, forgive me, i'm new to this new-fangled technology, and what a cool privilege just to be able to say hello and i always loved yer shows and jokes- finny guys like us, get spread waay too thin!  have you spoke with sir paul? i bet he talks to you, right?
@ConanOBrien conan o'frickin' brien! no frickin' way!  is this thing really on?     you're really tall, wow,!  hey you were awesome, i really miss the '90's--dang!  i trust the best is yet to come, i suggest it hurry up!
@BarackObama very funny!   in any case  i'm sure you won't mind answering , in open-session, a few questions for trey gowdy and the others, right-right?  here's to fairness, right-right?
this kid is now older than his old man was- but he'll always be our boy! https://t.co/cwqwJIqB0w
@andreslvngstone @seanonolennon love this!  please make more !  anyone can play gigs, no one cares!  it's the  material what counts!  yer the goose that lays the golden eggs- be gentle with yourself!  and no ciggies!  haha!
@seanonolennon @Newsweek @yokoono you're a lucky kid, man!  baby, you're a rich man too!  	  'into the sun' is one of my alltime favorite cd's for over 20 years- hey keep makin' recordings, concerts are fun but the real magic is the recording- so i hope you take plenty of time for that!  rock on, young sean!
@SaraCarterDC no doubt!  this is unacceptable!
@garthbrooks @NotreDame hey gaines!  lose the country act!  get real, chris!  dang!
well, now, what we need is a viable third party, that represents, y'know, the other sixty four percent of us all!  we can debate all day long, but how long do y'think we've got...can you imagine how it would be today if she'd won?
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump @AlanDersh @hogangidley45 @RonDeSantisFL @RealCandaceO @dbongino @ChristopherHahn @FoxNews BONGINO?  I'M IN!
@Jim_Jordan @SenSchumer yes!   AND SOMEONE SHOULD REMIND HIM THAT TRUMP IS THE GREATEST JOBS-PRESIDENT THAT GOD EVER CREATED!
@barandaz2018 @SecPompeo YEAH, BUT LET US ALSO NEVER FORGET THE *USS LIBERTY* !
@SecPompeo I HOPE THAT MEANS, NO MORE WARS FOR IZ-RUL!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, SIR!
@RepMarkMeadows you said it, sir!  now just what's the problem?  can we get some action on this- for instance, we wanna see way more public hearings with the witnesses under oath!  that makes for some great tv! let's hear from the gentleman from kentucky!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump you said it, sarah!  someday, they're gonna have to apologise, big-league and bigly!  haha!
@Jim_Jordan you said it jordie!  you're gonnabe the man and i hope you'll do the right thing, -and that isn't necessarily the easy thing, i know  you know!  good luck, sir!
@therealroseanne @moworldwide here's a good one:  ''yes, praying for up, and yours, haha! ''
@therealroseanne @moworldwide why, what'd they say?  anyone attackin' you has sadly missed the point of anything serious in this world and it's almost laughable- we should laugh more- you're the comedian, don't ever stop!
@therealroseanne hey, too bad about the racist tweet, or , i mean the way they called you a racist when nuthin' could be further from the truth!  hannity never had a better guest!  good show!
@PaulMcCartney @cavernliverpool aw wow, man!   remember when you recorded 'nobody knows'?  can y'tell me what it was , you was lookin' at!  ...remember y'said, 'anyone who can, gottabe a craaazy cat'
@therealroseanne oh i know, right?  it's like, hypocrite much, y'wanna ask these people!
@therealroseanne well, now, i think we need a third party, called the trump-o- crats!
@Jim_Jordan you said it, congressman!
@Kathy_C_ @NBCNightlyNews @jolingkent word.
@NBCNightlyNews @jolingkent frack that, that's not cool, y'know what?  frack them!
@Jim_Jordan YEAH--WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY, MAN!	  oops, i wasn't yelling, sir!  just sayin'!
@mrspence88 @Veteran4Trump DANG, SPENCE!  YES, FORCE IS JUSTIFIED, BUT NOT MUCH FORCE WOULD'VE BEEN REQUIRED , JUST TO SLAP THAT LITTLE URCHIN- (oops, was that a boy or a girl?)-DOWN AGAIN -hAHAHA!
@UnkwnParanormal @trueparapodcast hey!  ...y'know if they can fake whole moon missions, and programs, surely a tricycle's a piece of cake!   y'see what'm'say'n?
@RhinoluvsUSA @MailOnline dang!
this was just too funny! https://t.co/IUzH2sYAIB
@mrspence88 @Veteran4Trump haha!  no ya don't!
@Veteran4Trump @richard23704 haha--that wasn't me!  i would never behave so inappropriately!
@FoxNews @RepGoodlatte respectfully, i have to say BULLCRAP!  WHY?  BECAUSE 'EXTREME CARELESSNESS' **IS** GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND THAT'S THAT!
it *is* ! https://t.co/XCrwimIzUD
@FoxNews @SaraCarterDC @RepGoodlatte THIS IS A BIG DEAL, LIB-TERDS!  TELL ME IT ISN'T!   hohoho~
@therealroseanne GOOD FOR YOU- THEY DIDN'T DESERVE TO HAVE YOUR SHOW ANYWAYS!	 NOW YOU CAN BE INDEPENDENT, MEDIA-WISE,  THE SKY'S THE LIMIT!	 oops i wasn't *yelling*
WHEE-HEE! https://t.co/5s0p6OjroR
@richard23704 HEY--I LIKE THAT!
@therealroseanne yeah, only for like fifty-some years already--WHEE-HEE!
@DineshDSouza good idea!            haha!     are you making another movie?  love the speeches and 'q and a' after the speeches/lectures!
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump indeed, i see so many offenses and violations, and so little accountability!  these things must be accounted for and made right!  they keep piling up and that doesn't help!  we need the right kind of help and fast!
@DineshDSouza you mean the e.u. going bankrupt?  how is that possible? surely they've got banks on their side or whatever, ,no?  i have no idea-it's all a mystery to me!
@davidxbishop @therealroseanne WHO  are YOU, by the way? i thought i had the fewest followers--haha, i guess i was wrong!
@MagniFieri @therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @vj44 @HillaryClinton @SenJohnMcCain @JohnBrennan ahahahaaa!
@davidxbishop @therealroseanne oops--sorry about that!  'the view' and too many people got NO SENSE OF HUMOR, isn't it funny?
@therealroseanne HEY! EXCELLENT! GREAT TO SEE YA HERE- TWITTER'S NEW TO ME- RIGHT ON!
@JudgeJeanine @seanhannity @FoxNews can't wait, your honor!  did whoopi apologise yet? she surely should!
⚡️ “go!”		https://t.co/dvir5jM7vM
by the way, what's a 'moment', right?
@Tpagayz @bigplaincircle @RandPaul hey, frack that!   judge jeanine is the best!     and yer freakin' un-american if y'don't like her!
what's the latest?  lee stranahan's probably right, by the way and i think you should pay attention to him!
@RandPaul @TuckerCarlson the real truth is that those servers were never examined because too many important people would be implicated- it must either be in custody or destroyed by now, but what if russia had a lotta that missing  intel and shared it- the perps would freak out!
@cpejtj @TheodoreIsaac5 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump o'bamma  represents betrayal and corruption!  we don't need anymore of that sorta thing, thank you very much!
@realDonaldTrump yes!  where is hillary and what have they done with her?  she used to be a sensible person- supposedly!
@AnnCoulter you can say that again, ann!  what the heck could he possibly have been thinking, in so many cases, the exact wrong people were selected!  i wonder if we'll ever get any explanation of that!
@PaulMcCartney hey! is that you, sir? i was wondering about that song 'nobody knows'- can you tell me what it was you were lookin' at? was it a banana peel maybe? maybe a bhong? how about a clue! is it really you??  thanks, sir!
@stranahan hey lee! i listened to that long 'debate' you did with young dustin- that was so very kind of you and he need not have taken anything personally- someday he'll appreciate it and it's guys like him who could most benefit from your school of journalism!
@seanrickman2 sticks matter- but only if you're not 'the rick' i guess!  haha!
@DavidLeeRoth c'mon,dave!  when are you gonna do another 'roth show' or put one up on you tube- you tube is still where it's at, man!  i've been telling people to listen to your radio show, it's the best- s'c'mon,sir!  remember, the last one was called 'survival' --maybe part 2?  thanks, sir!
@Jim_Jordan clearly they're not to be trusted when they should already be under investigation at the very least, based on their own rules and they darn well know it! the least they could do is act a little less arrogant!  they could be forgiven for a lot if they'd come clean!  thanks, sir!
@DineshDSouza you said it, sir!  this is an honor to actually speak to you!  how d'y'think hillary and obama like ya now!  haha!  you are loved more than any of your peers- (assuming you have any!) - can't wait to see more movies from you!  love your speeches and you tubes! more, please,sir!
@WhiteHouse @IvankaTrump if you have to drink a soft drink, just don't drink the DIET soft drinks!
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @IvankaTrump by the way, don't drink that garbage- haven't you heard about how bad aspartame is--and 'rummy's  role in pushing that known poison into our food supply? aspartame is bad and no one should ever be exposed to it,-let alone drink it!
don't fall for the trump-hate program, nor the russia-hating program! it's vicious lies from people who hate you-the people! think for yourselves! you should be insulted to be told what to think!
@babylon_slim @SAndion @realDonaldTrump no way, sir! i know that's what the fake news would have you believe- and it's time to make them tell the truth or be shut down!  you couldn't be more wrong!  listen to jim jordan., devin nunes, rand paul and a few others who aren't fooled by the klintonistas!
@realDonaldTrump all the 'ice protestors' camped out in the street, defecating in the streets make us all look bad!  don't tolerate any more of that, sir!
@realDonaldTrump guys, listen! trump is trying to prevent unnecessary wars, while all his haters seem to want war with russia or at the very least, to treat russia as an enemy, lest they fill trump in (and his lawyers) on all the crimes of the previous administrations- in my opinion!
@realDonaldTrump so much fake news! it's almost comical, if it weren't so tragic - if you think about it! you should be alarmed by the flared-up hatred and hysteria, whipped up by the fake news- shame on them all!   take care out there and stop and think!
thanks to the coffee growers, you wouldn't believe what we pay for your coffee!
https://t.co/Nn7rk1Z0En  oops this is new! did it go thru?
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch definitely!	   'course trump's an excellent negotiator!  how many minutes til wapner...?
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch fitton's right! it's nothing personal, but it is a matter of national security!
@yakobdart @HCDotNet @RealAlexJones exactly, it's like, are they flippin' *serious*, omg, right?
@HCDotNet that's anti-american, man!  better stand up for freedom, not this micro-management crap!
lookin' for like, all the people, where would i find people here, - anyone?  i'm new here, can y'tell?
@HCDotNet haha!  aren't you worried about justice coming after ya?  i would flee to somewhere like dubai, - honestly, you'd be happier there, - do yourself a favor! you're worth it!
that's right, you've found my official twitter-tweeter thingy!  so do me a favor, spread it around, people need to know i'm here!  thanks!
how can a 'swamp', which by definition is on the lowest ground around, ever be drained?  y'know??
@realDonaldTrump action has been 'deferred' long enough, don't you think?  there are more pressing issues in any case!
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump GREAT INTERVIEW!  have you heard that president nixon stashed a time capsule in the white house, meant to be unearthed by now?  ask around! people listen to you-- thank you, judge!
@realDonaldTrump Twitter is okay! yes you should tweet MORE!  -say: did you hear about president nixon's time capsule yet, rumored to have been hidden in the white house?  --we're gonna need to see that asap!  thank you, sir, and godspeed!
@realDonaldTrump SIR!   i have a theory that if you would become an independent, instead of  republican, you'd instantly become much more respectable, sir- no offense, and i hope you don't mind my sayin' so!   isn't it  time for the two-party monopoly to be defeated? they're INGRATES!
@realDonaldTrump Sir!   please say hello to the friendly aliens and tell them we really like gold coins, *hint-hint* !
@kyleRok @RandPaul good point! all that money's coming back to us one way or another, by gosh, and we'll live like kings! but we need better farms, namely, greenhouses to avoid the chemtrail pollution from above!
@realDonaldTrump peace!
WAIT! IS THIS THING ON?
