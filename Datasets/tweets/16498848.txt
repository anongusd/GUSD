@smmrpm No and I don't go around bashing others opinions so good way to show your intelligence
@Cyclistlaw I disagree. We are for now in the USA all free to have our own opinions. I do not comment on others posts just stating my vote.
@Cyclistlaw What makes you think I must be a guy? I'm not so that was quit narrow minded of you &amp; rude. You don't have to agree but respect!
Officially voting for Trump 	So tired of her double standards, her pay to play, and as Patriots we should truly be terrified of her
