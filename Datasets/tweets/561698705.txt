@tyler_casper Traditional medicine has made huge strides. There is also a place for homeopathic treatments too but when it comes to the serious stuff, don’t end up like Susanne sommers. Cut out the cancer. Don’t f@#k around. I just found out yesterday my husband has rectal cancer. Out ASAP!

Biden creeps kids out for a reason. AOC is too young thank God, Kamala is too far left. What worries me is the candidate that comes out of nowhere. If you were Nancy, wouldn’t you support someone who has a chance of winning? Michelle is going to announce and we’re not ready.

@tyler_casper I was taught to say nothing. My instinct is to say, “that’s nice,” and sometimes, I just walk away.
@Baby___Del @BibleBeltDarlin It’s time to give in. This fight was lost four moves ago. The president accepted fault for shut down, he shut it down, he was forced to accept a lesser deal to end the shut down and must make this deal. He can continue to fight another day. All other options are messy and futile.
@Caliicoder3 @zeusFanHouse I agree w you about her hypocrisy. You are spot on and should call her out but could you leave vernacular like  “pot head” out of it? We socially responsible consumers don’t call beer drinkers lush buckets. I think it’s time. Pot deserves some respect.

@dbongino @CmmbMaggy And be brave. Google abortion and look. Look at these terminated babies! Look, look, look. See w your own eyes and ask yourself, “if I don’t speak out against this, am I damned?” I’m a retired OR nurse. Look before you decide. Just look, I beg you.
Let’s give the fetus a choice. A voice. Instead of abortion deliver the child. If it cries, it wants life. It chooses life and no one can stifle this cry for life. We must honor the fetus’ choice.  Deliver babies instead of aborting. Let’s give the fetus a voice, literally.

Who does the fetus belong to, itself or its mother? Does the mother’s desire to terminate supersede the baby’s desire to live? If the mother would let the fetus have its 1st breath it should recognize its independence. If it cries It wants out. It wants life. It must live.

@Airbornex82nd @PattyWheeler12 @POTUS I was banned for calling the person offering oral sex for violence against Covington child a sl*t. I was rather ruthless in my comment. Fair play one good turn and all that. I believe they ban based on public outrage. We can all report tweets. The most complaints gets the ban.
@zur_rob @MeanestKatGirl Straight from my priest. When the Temple was destroyed for the third time Jews splintered into those who believed Jesus was the Messiah and those who did not. This is why we r referred to as Judeo Christians. This is why Jews r our people too. Neither of us has our roots in Islam
@KokeReport @SilasHodgson Because Muslims insist on it. Our Christ preached passivity. We are obeying. When asked how do we live in such an evil world Christ clearly says we must be cunning as the snake but innocent as the dove. (Sermon On The Mount). We must fight bk w/o fighting dirty, I’m thinking.

Call Nancy. Be polite. Identify as an independent (the swing voters) and ask her to provide all ready agreed to money for a barrier and settle this. I reminded her that plenty of proof she had once agreed to $. That it looks like pure spite. I presented myself as reasonable.
I just called Nancy. I politely told her I was an Independent and was so disappointed in the shut down. To please give the president money her party has already agreed to and end this shut down. We r the swing vote after all, right? We need lots of independents to call her.

@Kevin_Shipp @robinBland11 Yes, but please don’t call him Mafia like. If the govt ran w the efficiency of la cosanostra, we’d have had our wall before the 20th century, the middle class would be protected as valued earners, and our word is our bond. Just saying.

Good morning patriots! I woke to news on WRAL here in NC. Guess what they were reporting? The go fund me page. If the news has reached my little hamlet in NC you can bet your sweet butts Washington is listening! I’m so proud of you, Brian!! I’m so proud of us! Keep it going!
@pahubb43 My 2 granddaughters got iPhone 10X for Christmas. It’s insane. I bought jade the game Twister and Katey a sm WiFi speaker. Some hair bobs and a little candy and I called it a day. It’s not possible to compete w an iPhone so I did what I could.
Patriots! I know how Trump can get all republicans to vote w him. RBGinsberg is sick, right? He should threaten (behind closed doors) to put a flaming liberal on the SC if they don’t vote w him! Genius, right?

@MeanestGirlKat I can’t lie. I’m 59 and I wish I were young again, sometimes. But, it’s your turn. I had my glory days and boy were they glorious. I grew up on Long Island and went to school w Jerry Seinfeld and Brian Setzer at Massapequa High. Springsteen got it right. Glory Days.

@DaveedWoW @scorestopshelf @4AmericanKat @cajunchick25 @senatemajldr Now now, Dave. This effort will not go unnoticed. It’s about supporting our president. It’s about sending a message, which is not pathetic. I’m catching a lot of slack for supporting this but Christ himself said he will help us only after we do all we can do for ourselves.
@SeasideSue1 I disagree. The message is as old as politics itself. Money talks and BS walks. Every vet that fights for us puts their life on the line for around 2,000$ a month. Surely they can do the math. Are their lives worth more? Of course but they fight bc it was never about the money.
@sbaxter777 @scorestopshelf @4AmericanKat @cajunchick25 @senatemajldr I know this. It’s a message. It’s a start. It’s better than doing nothing. I’m asking people to give the cost of one lousy cappuccino! I’m a glass half full lady.

@Brenderm1 @gator4kb18 @mrcoyleteach Even doctors are middle class unless they’re born into money. I hate to say it but a million dollars, on the social hierarchy, isn’t that much. If you don’t own property we are considered lower class. The beauty of America is even being low class is still richer than so many.

Doing the dishes last night I was thinking about the president canceling his meeting w Putin. I think he met w Putin in the past not so much to meet him but to allow Putin to look in his eyes and see our president may be gracious but he is also lethal! What is Putin thinking now?
