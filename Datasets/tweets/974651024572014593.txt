@Astartiel I found that I truly loved all of this, and have made many more friends, and have an extra set of income. I'm not entirely cured of my issues or woes, but I am certainly a lot happier.
@Astartiel I started gardening and learning botany, and things have significantly improved on a lot of fronts, making self-care much easier to come by. I make botanical medicines and have my own shop, and a set up at a farmers market that got me out around people more often
@Astartiel I felt this way myself. Became suicidal at one point. For one, I felt like time was moving too quickly, and every year passed me by. Though, I learned that remaking yourself with a new passion helps with this.

@alidose @angelor2000 @cvpayne I was more disagreeing with your narrow minded view on the purpose of these services
@angelor2000 @alidose @cvpayne Now I don't need it at all anymore. It certainly was a great help during a time in my life when I needed it
@angelor2000 @alidose @cvpayne Who the hell mentioned Latinos? I was referencing myself. Rice and beans and Ramen are cheap and can be bought in bulk to keep from starving, but with the help I've received from SNAP, I was able to take more hours and do better quality work eating better quality meat and veggies
@alidose @cvpayne While working several jobs, when faced with a choice between the cheapest bulk foods like rice and beans and having access to healthier and more diverse options, the ideological taste of food is irrelevant
@cvpayne I was able to build my way up to doing this very thing with the help from SNAP, sir. It would've been a lot harder without it, with the start I got in the world. Don't be so black and white about this issue. Every service is exploited and misused, but it is also used legitimately

@GregShugar The press is still talking about Elizabeth Warren. They've learned nothing from 2016
@Liberty13Texas Even if that were true, no one will ever vote for your party in any way that doesn't hurt a party that will actually be elected, so your effort is not only fruitless, but a nuisance
