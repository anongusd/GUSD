As you can see once again, Trump believes he is only suppose to be President for places where he got more votes. He ignores everywhere else, even places where he got a decent amt of votes.

@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Ok. I just hope that you and others who feel the same way will support him wholeheartedly if he's the nom. I hope his supporters do the same if it's not him. I hope nobody takes their toys and goes home like some in 2016. We need to support &amp; be united behind the nom. Have a gn.
@MyInnerID @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Yeah...boo! Let's keep fighting, it worked so well last time! 🙄
@AlcadeCade @Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal There's no way to prove that. Your comments are not helpful. Go away.
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Agree or disagree, it's possible he believes he's the best candidate to remove Trump. I'm not for telling anyone they should not run, which is why I would say the same thing I'm saying to you now if one of his die hards suggested HRC not run because she's too divisive.
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal more years of Trump. People need to look at the bigger picture. Telling someone and their supporters they're garbage for a year and a half then expecting them to just forget it all is foolish. We have to stop the bs now or history will repeat itself.
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal every candidate, and especially the supporters of the candidates that finish 2nd and 3rd. It goes the other way as well. The Dem nominee will need his supporters as well to ensure a victory. Trashing each other constantly only deepens the divide and will ultimately give us 4
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal I think he can take heat and he'll be a formidable contender for the nom. However, it's people like me that are pissed that people are continuing the 2016 bs still, especially with what we've seen happen the last couple years. If he gets the nom, he needs the supporters of
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Ok, but he caucuses with Dems and literally almost every issue he agrees with Dems on. He's basically a Democrat in all but name. This is such a ridiculous argument. At least he's smart enough to know that running as an independent would give us another Trump term.
@ernestine_12 @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Whether getting that advice or not getting that advice helps or hurts him in the end? It's going to fall squarely on his shoulders either way. So, like I was saying, this is a non-issue for the rest of us.
@ernestine_12 @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Nobody has to get any advice from the people who came before them. That's each person's own decision to make. Also, imo, I feel like if he had said the opposite, the same people would be trashing him for wanting her advice. It's really a non-issue that's been turned into an issue
@Philos_Sofia @MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal His policy stances are nearly 100% identical to the rest of the Dem field, so he's running for the Dem nomination. So yes, yes it is infighting. Are you suggesting it would be a better idea if he ran as an independent candidate vs Trump &amp; whoever we would then nominate?

@MrDane1982 @GayEqualGlobal Maybe we could stop the infighting and stop dividing people every potential general election candidate would need to win? Just some thoughts for everyone continuing the stupid infighting.
Bernie will need HRC/other Dem candidates supporters to win the general. The other Dem candidates will need Bernie supporters to win the general. This isn't hard to figure out folks. Keep your eyes on the prize: defeating Trump.
But, by all means folks, continue to fight. I mean, what's the worse that could happen? 🙄		I will support whoever the nominee is and will do so enthusiastically. Get your heads out of your asses and just stop the stupidity.
If you're using #BernieSoBlack to trash Bernie and his supporters, you're part of the problem. 	If you're using #BernieInChicago to trash other Dems and their supporters, you're part of the problem. 	Doing what each side is doing right now will ensure we have Trump 4 more years.

@CapehartJ @MichelleBernard In the end, getting a portion of what we want with a non-racist/non-traitorous Dem President is better than getting nothing done for another four years with a racist Russian puppet squatting in the WH.
@CapehartJ @MichelleBernard This is what I've been saying. The top goal should be to defeat Trump. If defeating him is not your top goal, then we most assuredly will have another four years of his or Pence's greatness. I'm curious as to how that would get us to M4A, GND, or $15 an hr min wage?

@mmpadellan vindicated and he'll say he was right all along, that it was a witch hunt, etc, and he will jazz up his racist base enough to squeak out another EC win in 2020. If it's just "he committed obstruction of justice a lot", Repubs aren't going to budge at all, Dems will be too afraid
@mmpadellan they aren't going to act. This in spite of the fact he's already implicated in two felonies in the SDNY and has done various other impeachable things. Even if it's damning on obstruction, but not collusion, my concern is that they won't act and Trump &amp; Co will say they are
@mmpadellan won't be clear and Judiciary Dems will balk at starting impeachment hearings if it's just a bunch of stuff that's already public. They've put all of their hopes on it being damning enough. And if it's just "hey, he obstructed justice but we're not sure about collusion", then
@mmpadellan I said something similar earlier today and stated as much in the past. Given that certain people haven't been indicted and the idea that it's going to be done this soon, j suspect it's going to be a dud. It will give us some more detail of what we already know, but collusion

We don't need some fairy tale candidate to come along and inspire us and be our savior. We need a Democratic President, minor flaws and all. All of these Dem candidates have minor flaws or things people can nitpick. Let's get over that now.
Dems need to remember this in 2020, regardless of who the nominee is: You. Can't. Always. Get. What. You. Want. Don't sit this one out. Don't trash other Dems because they don't favor 100% of what you want RIGHT NOW. Don't trash others because of their approach.#KlobucharTownHall

I'm as liberal as they come, but there is room in Democratic Party for a pragmatic approach to many of the issues we face. Senator Klobuchar's stances are practical, reasonable, and can be done rather quickly. Will that be enough to win this primary? Eh, idk. 	#KlobucharTownHall

@coto43 @cnnbrk He's literally taking money that could help American citizens to try and address something that's not an emergency. Never thought I'd see the day when Republicans no longer cared about the Constitution...oh wait...that's everyday (except for the 2A of course).
@DrJoeStudMD @DickyCunningham @cnnbrk Considering that his own administration has put out statistics that show there is no emergency...yeah, his case is f'd either way.
@BigBenBlacklock @cnnbrk Or they've paid attention to the stats by Trump's own administration and see that there's not an actual emergency? Also, I'm sure Cali and NM are very familiar with what's happening at the border.

@Msbmoran @SherrodBrown @kentstatedems At least something good came out of that tragedy.

@Msbmoran @SherrodBrown I'm going based off what's he's said and other basic knowledge of the candidates and this process. I'm not a spokesperson or anything, but this seems like this is very much what's he's doing right now. I suspect others who didn't consider running until recently may do the same.
