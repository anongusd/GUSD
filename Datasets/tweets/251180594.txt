@jsherber Thanks! It's a way to get around a VERY stupid supreme court decision. I hope all's well.
3 step Plan would be effective ethics &amp; election reform and not cost taxpayers a dime. #nysethicsreform #policydiscussionontwitterishard
3 step plan will limit ability of power 2 coalesce around any 1 pol which will prevent opportunity for corruption &amp; Mk for competitive races
Cmpgn spnding caps would level playing field &amp; make pols be more creative in getting message out; can't just inundate us w/ tv-mail-roboclls
To resolve 1st amndt issues let pols opt into campgn caps: strict 1 term limit, BUT if you agree to spending Cap, term limits don't apply
But shouldn't have to subsidize pols to get level playing field. NYS should have Spending limits in campaigns. To  Mk sure 1st ament issues
3. Limit campgn spndng: few comptitve races b/c pols have huge war chests &amp; challengers don't; NYC leveled playing field w/ public fncing;
3. Limit campaign spending most people cant raise huge money needed 4 campaign;&amp; pols need relationships w/ special interests to raise big $
When pols in 1 office that long it allows for creation/coalescing of  institutional power &amp; too familiar relationships w/ special interests
2. 1 term limit. Big problem is that pols treat leg like a fiefdom, &amp; stay for decades.  Return to your plow Cinncinatus. Fresh ideas R good
1. Make leg a full time job; they already make more than average NYer; Median household income in NYS is 58K, legislators make at least 79K.
An Ethics plan for NY	1. Make leg a full time job/no outside income 	2. 1Term limit	3. No term limits if u opt in to campgn Spending limits
