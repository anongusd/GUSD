@RepRickAllen Allen asks about accountability.		Nowicki @USGAO says federal government hopes to learn to what extent PBIS is being used in schools with respect to restraint and seclusion. 		She says it's important to remember that the federal data are numbers, not a full story.
.@RepRickAllen wonders if this issue of dealing with restraint and seclusion is primarily a training and certification issue. 		I'd think that special education teachers would be trained and certified in this, he says.
Sometimes, kids engage in certain behaviors simply to get attention, or to escape attention, Sugai notes.
@DonnaShalala George Sugai notes that while positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) is an important framework when considering the issues related to restraint and seclusion, using PBIS is not an intervention itself either.
@DonnaShalala "It‚Äôs barbaric to confine students alone in locked rooms, or to use abusive methods to restrain little children," @DonnaShalala says. "Treating school kids in this way should not be tolerated in this country, period."
.@DonnaShalala highlights the death of Andrew McClain in 1998, after two care workers sat on the 11-year-old's chest after a disagreement. 		You can read about the case here: https://t.co/rRynN7MzsY

@USGAO However, restraint and seclusion disproportionately impacts students with disabilities, Nowicki notes; 12% of students in schools have disabilities, yet those students account for 75% of students who are restrained, and nearly 60% of students who are secluded.
"Nationally, the use of restraint and seclusion is very rare," Jacqueline Nowicki @USGAO tells the subcommittee, noting that only 0.1 percent of students are restrained or secluded according to the most recent federal data.
Renee Smith is talking about how the impact restraint and seclusion had on her son Dillon; she says his awareness that other kids knew what was happening to him added to his trauma: "He no longer trusted any of the adults in that school." https://t.co/RuyNzsltjy
George Sugai says that while restraint and seclusion may be appropriate in a small number of cases to prevent imminent harm, it should not be used as punishment, it does not help students develop relationships, and it is not therapeutic.
Send us all your jokes about how the subcommittee hearing we're watching on restraint and seclusion in schools is the big deal on Capitol Hill today.

@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes .@RepJahanaHayes says that if so many people on both sides of the aisle are so insistent that they respect teachers, then why is education not looked at as an investment?
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes .@RepJahanaHayes says that throughout much of the hearing there's been a mistaken dichotomy. 		"We are thinking that it‚Äôs one or the other: Pay teachers or improve facilities. I want both," Hayes says.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes What happens to a child who doesn't have a parent who knows how to advocate for that child? @RepJahanaHayes asks. 		Isn't it our job as legislators and educators to advocate for those who don't have a voice? she also asks.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes .@RepJahanaHayes asks that even with a huge boost to school choice: What would happen to the other 45 million who would remain in struggling public schools? 		How does a student in Waterbury, Conn., not get left behind that kind of system, she asks.
@EdLaborCmte .@RepJahanaHayes is back for another round of questioning. She says that as an educator, she's written so many things down during ongoing testimony, but will rein herself in.		Hayes stresses that things like IDEA for special education are laws, not regulations.
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten @BobbyScott @RepJoeMorelle GOP Rep. Wright says it's "upside-down" when teachers do not make up the majority of the school workforce. 		"There's no accountability here," Wright says.
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten @BobbyScott .@RepJoeMorelle says "there is a special place in heaven" for middle school teachers.		So, middle school teachers: You have a friend in Congress.
@EdLaborCmte .@rweingarten gives a shout-out to @BobbyScott and others who wrote the Every Student Succeeds Act back in 2015.		Might seem like a long time ago to some!

@EdLaborCmte @RepSusanWild Wild presses Scafidi on whether he includes people like guidance counselors and school bus drivers in his calculations of non-teacher staff levels.		He says yes.		Wild then asks if he thinks those people are not essential to schools. He says he does not. think that.
@EdLaborCmte .@RepSusanWild notes wryly that she was a very active parent in her kids' schools ... until her kids "banned" her from their schools. 		How many parents have had that experience?
@EdLaborCmte .@KYComer says there needs to be a reconsideration of which people in public education earn the high salaries.
@EdLaborCmte "It seems like states aren't great at making their own tests," Scafidi says.
@EdLaborCmte Ben Scafidi urges humility when thinking about low-performing schools and how to help them.		He says we don't know a great deal about how to turn around those schools; uses that as an argument for government restraint in education.
@EdLaborCmte .@lucymcbath asks Guildford County schools how the underfunding of schools impacts the local economy.		The superintendent says it ultimately leads to persistent underachievement over several generations.
This is the photo that Rep. Jayapal held up at the House hearing that we referred to a few minutes ago. https://t.co/SaPiJUoB7k
@EdLaborCmte .@RepJayapal highlights a school without heat where students ended up holding their feet over a hot plate.		"These are our public schools. These are not shelters," Jayapal says.
@EdLaborCmte @RepGrothman Grothman also says the discussion of teacher pay has failed to take into account other financial benefits for educators. 		And he criticizes those in the education system who he says discourage the involvement of parents.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes @JahanaHayes @Kilili_Sablan .@RepGrothman has no patience for the Democratic witness calling for more federal money.		"It scares me when I hear people in education ‚Ä¶ who are apparently coming up here ‚Ä¶ and (asking) the completely broke federal government for more money," Grothman says.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes @JahanaHayes .@Kilili_Sablan, the delegate in charge of the House subcommittee on elementary and secondary education, says Congress will be holding hearings on both Title I and IDEA (special education law).
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes @JahanaHayes Scafidi argues a well-designed school choice program would promote integration and help many children escape struggling schools. 		Hayes notes she sent her children to a Title I school. "That was not by choice," she says, and "exporting the high-performers out" would not work.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes @JahanaHayes .@RepJahanaHayes is grilling Ben Scafidi. She asks him if Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, Title XI, and special education law are regulations; he says yes.		She asks him if skirting or ignoring those would improve integration or promote better schools.
@EdLaborCmte @RepJahanaHayes "If you think this is just about salaries, that's not how it works," @JahanaHayes says, referring to teacher walkouts and strikes.
@EdLaborCmte .@RepJahanaHayes tells Anna King of National PTA: Please don't ever apologize for being a passionate advocate for children.
@EdLaborCmte "We need to have a more market-driven education system," Scafidi says.		But right now, he says, we have a "monopsonistic" system.
@EdLaborCmte Foxx asks Scafidi what the "magical" number is for an increase in school sending that will lead to a dramatic improvement in student performance. 		"There is no magic number in the current system," Scafidi says.
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten @RepRaulGrijalva @RepVirginiaFoxx Ben Scafidi says there's a "13-layer cake" because there are 13 levels of government/bureaucracy that influence what goes on in his kids' public school classroom. 		"What it‚Äôs led to is an increase in all other staff," Scafidi says, moreso than salary boosts for teachers."
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten @RepRaulGrijalva .@RepVirginiaFoxx says that she couldn't become a teacher due to financial constraints, then laughs and says that instead she's ended up with "a wasted life here."
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten In response to a question from .@RepRaulGrijalva, @rweingarten criticizes charter schools that she says take money from traditional public schools.		"Charters have to operate within a public school system," Weingarten says. "They cannot siphon off money that other children need."
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten "We need help from others too," @rweingarten. 		She says communities are trying to step up with more money, but it's not enough. 		"We know that property taxation only exacerbates inequality," she says. "We need Congress to help too."
@EdLaborCmte @rweingarten "Teachers across the country tell me all the time about having to clean up mouse droppings in the morning" and whiteboards rendered useless by a lack of electricity, @rweingarten says. 		Stresses that teachers are paying for help out of their own pockets, but it's not enough.
@EdLaborCmte .@rweingarten starts off by highlighting mold-ridden schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Philadelphia schools.		"Of course, many schools that have mold are not closed," Weingarten says.
@EdLaborCmte If taxpayers keep giving more money to public schools, "Literally decades of history has taught us that there will be significant increase in employment in all other staff, stagnant teacher salaries, and stagnant outcomes for American students," Scafidi says.
@NationalPTA Scafidi, the GOP witness @EdLaborCmte today, says administrative costs grew at the expense of higher teacher salaries, etc.		"The majority of public school employees in the United States were not teachers" in 2016, he says, citing staffing "surge" since 1950.
@NationalPTA Now for an opposing view:		Since 1992, public school spending per student has increased by 37 percent in real dollars, says witness Benjamin Scafidi, higher than the increase in public school students. 		At the same time real teacher salaries declined by about 1 percentage point.
Anna King @NationalPTA says Congress must raise spending caps in order to provide more funding for schools under ESSA, the main special education law, and more.		"Our schools should be equally resourced," King says.
@BobbyScott @RepKendraHorn The superintendent of Guildford County, North Carolina schools, Sharon Contreras, notes that her district has 469 mobile classrooms, more than half of which are 20 years old.		"Our crumbling school infrastructure requires national leadership and federal funding," Contreras says.
@BobbyScott .@RepKendraHorn highlights how many teachers have to take second jobs and the Oklahoma teacher walkouts last year.		Here's what Oklahoma teachers face this year after a tumultuous period: https://t.co/mXaoyrTBHY
@RepVirginiaFoxx @SenatorTimScott @CoryBooker Foxx stresses the need to share new ideas at the hearing. 		@BobbyScott responds by thanking Foxx for highlighting Democrats' consistency in pushing for more federal education funding. That gets a grin from Foxx.
@RepVirginiaFoxx The best ideas for improving local schools come from their communities, Foxx says. 		Community development can include things like creating Opportunity Zones, he says, where the poverty rates exceed 30 percent. This is a big issue for @SenatorTimScott and @CoryBooker.
@RepVirginiaFoxx "Democrats have not had a new idea in decades" when it comes to teacher pay and school infrastructure, Foxx says; they always push for more control from Washington. 		"The less politicians can control and leverage, the better," she says.
Ranking member @RepVirginiaFoxx begins her opening statement by declaring that teachers deserve good pay for their work. 		However, she stresses that most states have recently *increased* public school spending, but have not spent a lot of that money on teachers.
@BobbyScott Not surprisingly, Scott hit on a lot of key Democratic priorities for/views on education: 		Funding for poor kids, special ed.	Better-paid teachers	Inequitable spending
@BobbyScott Scott highlights the roughly $100 billion school infrastructure bill he and other Democrats introduced about a week ago. You can learn about the bill here: https://t.co/AQi5IgOmuf
@BobbyScott Scott says the increasing reliance of schools on local property taxes has exacerbated inequalities. He highlights the lack of heating in Baltimore schools and lead contamination in Flint, Mich. schools' water.
Former Denver schools chief @SenatorBennet is thinking about running for president. He has a long record on K-12, including support for "salary comparability", merit pay &amp; rural education. https://t.co/BX3ypdxdDt
@BobbyScott On another issue, Scott says the failure of many states to fund infrastructure improvements has left many buildings crumbling.		Cites a figure of $197 billion to bring school facilities up to where they should be.
.@BobbyScott highlights what he says is the ongoing underfunding of federal special education obligations, among other major funding issues.

So it's fair to question whether Warren still supports what she proposed more than 15 years ago.		Then again, if she's changed her views, some might question how, or why, her views on public school vouchers changed.		Take your pick. https://t.co/7XKmWEDENb
When we reached out to Warren's campaign, we were told, "Senator Warren does not support private school vouchers and never has."		That response didn't address what she wrote back in 2003. 		However, more context: Warren hasn't pushed this issue, or school choice, as a senator.
Elizabeth Warren is no fan of Betsy DeVos. Yet when it comes to public school choice, she wrote back in 2003 that in order to break the link between rich neighborhoods and good schools, "A well-designed voucher program would fit the bill neatly." https://t.co/7XKmWEDENb

Last year, Trump barely mentioned education. The last time education got so little attention in a #SOTU was in 1989. Cardi B, Kylian Mbappe, and Simone Biles hadn't been born yet. 		Shocking, right? https://t.co/KeahWvGKXw https://t.co/UGEwnXqenT

In response to the long list of oversight priorities Scott outlined, Foxx says, "We'd better pack a bag and stay here awhile."
Sablan, the new chairman of the House subcommittee on early childhood, elementary and secondary education, cannot vote on legislation on the full House floor. 		(Clarification from earlier: Sablan is a delegate from Northern Mariana Islands to the House.)
Among other things @BobbyScott plans to do "aggressive oversight" on:	- School safety and DeVos' "interest" in arming school staff	- Rebuilding schools in Puerto Rico and USVI, among others	- #ESSA implementation
The new chair of the early childhood, elementary, and secondary education subcommittee is Rep. Gregorio Sablan, Democrat of the Northern Mariana Islands. 		New chair of civil rights and human services subcommittee is Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, Democrat of Oregon.
Foxx clarifies that she does not like the word "training" in the context of education.		"You train dogs. You educate people," Foxx says. She stresses the need to bring greater recognition to people who don't have baccalaureate degrees.
We meant to say "big school choice fan" below. Walker's communications director has assured us he is a fan of both school and school choice. https://t.co/OO6zLxH0bW

Foxx again registers her objection to the replacement of "Workforce" with "Labor" in the committee name.
Scott notes that the committee's rules have been changed to officially reflect its new name, Education and Labor.		... Look, as long as they keep "Education" in the name, we're good with it.
"This is the best committee in the House," Foxx says.
Foxx runs through the new committee members on the GOP side, says they've all "done their homework." 		Dusty Johnson of South Dakota and Van Taylor of Texas are mentioned; Mark Walker, a big school fan, is also a new member.
Foxx says she hopes the committee asks "the right questions for the right reasons" when it comes to oversight.		Oversight of Betsy DeVos is going to be a big deal this Congress. https://t.co/J7Ylx5iMPP
.@virginiafoxx, the ranking member, congratulates Scott on taking over as chairman. 		Foxx says she has a very positive working relationship with Scott, and points to several bipartisan successes in the last Congress they worked on, like the CTE and juvenile-justice laws.

@BenjaminBHerold Indeed, Andrew's level of humor and discourse often matches that of a 12-year-old. 		(And not one of those 12-year-olds who's in graduate school and played flawless Tchaikovsky at age 3.)
@NPRCoryTurner Meanwhile, I look forward to reviewing my Twitter thread on this hearing and finding all the inexplicable misspellings, as well as the weird decisions about spacing and paragraph breaks.
@NPRCoryTurner Well, more than two Republicans asked questions. 		Maybe they heard you had just tuned in and fled the dais, Cory.
@SenAlexander Alexander also thanks the audience for attending. 		The audience featured quite a few @MomsDemand activists upset about the idea of #ESSA money paying for guns in schools. 		That's a wrap. Go get some lunch or splash around in a puddle or hunt in vain for the sun, or something.
@SenAlexander Alexander thanks the panelists for the good discussion. 		It's like a University of Tennessee football game with 100,000 people in the stands knowing exactly what the next play should be, he says. 		I count two college football references in this hearing. Below average? #ESSA

@SenAlexander Alexander said a key compromise of #ESSA in 2015 was keeping the 17 federally mandated tests, but let states decide what to do with them. 		"We heard a lot about overtesting," Alexander says, asking states and Jeffries what other factors states are using to judge schools.
@PattyMurray .@SenAlexander notes that on the issue of the 1-percent cap for alternative tests that the waivers are permitted in the law. 		He says he's been told that preliminary conversations around these waivers typically haven't been made public.
.@PattyMurray now zeroing in on the 23 waivers Betsy DeVos has granted to states regarding the 1-percent cap on alternative tests in their #ESSA plans. Says it's inexplicable the documents related to these waivers haven't been made public.
@shavarjeffries .@shavarjeffries tells @timkaine about an incident in which a student who was kicked out of school was murdered on the way home.		"We need Congress to demand data to make sure that schools and states are doing the right thing," Jeffries says. #ESSA
@NDE_Commish .@shavarjeffries says students of color continued to be disciplined at rates disproportionate to their white peers, such as for wearing the wrong belt. 		Jeffries highlights trauma-informed and restorative-justice practices. Says last resort should be to send a child home. #ESSA
.@NDE_Commish says he's been dismayed to see students kicked out of their classrooms simply for crushing a water bottle. #ESSA
@SenBobCasey For what it's worth, not one lawmaker, state chief, or advocate has said today that arming educators is a good idea.		Several states do allow schools to arm educators under certain circumstances. #ESSA
@SenBobCasey Delaware's Susan Bunting says while the state takes a variety of approaches to improving school safety, arming educators is not one of them. #ESSA
.@SenBobCasey is the latest Democrat in this hearing to highlight the idea that arming educators is a bad idea. #ESSA
@SenDougJones @MomsDemand .@SenDougJones calls arming teachers "The dumbest idea that I think I've ever heard in the educational field." #ESSA
Here's another committee newbie (relatively speaking) @SenDougJones. He thanks the @MomsDemand activists in the audience, wonders if he wandered into a University of Alabama pep rally. (Roll tide.) #ESSA
@SenTinaSmith By 2022, South Carolina has a goal of implementing telepsychiatry in schools, state chief Molly Spearman says.		Right now, about half the state's schools have mental health counselors, she says.
@SenatorHassan @shavarjeffries Hassan's son Ben, the child she references in this anecdote, has cerebral palsy. He is non-verbal but functions well in other ways, Hassan notes.
Committee newbie @SenTinaSmith says teachers tell her how important students' mental health is to their work. 		"So many kids are struggling with difficult family situations, with trauma, historic trauma often," Smith says. #ESSA
@SenatorHassan @shavarjeffries Hassan says people got the idea her son was smart because when other students gave the teacher the wrong answer, he would laugh.		There is (you guessed it) laughter in the room.		She's using the anecdote to press for getting students in different subgroups what hey need. #ESSA
.@SenatorHassan asks @shavarjeffries if Betsy DeVos should require states to amend their plans to make sure they comply with #ESSA.		Jeffries says yes, and adds: She *must* do that.
@SenWarren Since @SenWarren brought up Puerto Rico, here's our coverage of the island's school system over the past year: https://t.co/N1oORyLcr5 https://t.co/RPvFCdCWt2
@SenWarren .@SenWarren notes that Congress has held zero hearings on the impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico's health and education systems. 		Warren says she's just asked Alexander for just such a hearing, along with other senators, on Puerto Rico, USVI, and elsewhere.
@SenWarren @MomsDemand .@SenWarren notes the drop in student enrollment and other impacts of the storm. She asks @shavarjeffries if Congress should hold hearings on Puerto Rico's schools. Jeffries says yes.		.@BobbyScott recently asked for such a hearing. https://t.co/rGrizOT8dp
@SenWarren @MomsDemand "When disasters hit, they don't affect only the communities that are directly hit by the eye of the storm," @SenWarren says. 		But she goes on to note that Puerto Rico closed more than 250 schools over the summer.
@SenWarren @MomsDemand .@SenWarren is asking about Hurricane Maria's displacement of students from Puerto Rico. 		Between Delaware and South Carolina, about 150 students relocated from the island to those two states.
"Allowing schools to put scarce federal dollars to put guns in classrooms is dangerous and dumb," @SenWarren says.		Warren thanks the @MomsDemand activists in the audience. She says they're a reminder that we don't work for the NRA.
@DanGordonDC Time is an artificially constructed flat circle, Dan.
@ChrisMurphyCT Murphy and Delaware's Bunting have a back-and-forth about school interventions. Bunting says her approach is to pilot interventions in appropriate districts and develop them, so that they're not just broad and hasty experiments. #ESSA
@ChrisMurphyCT .@ChrisMurphyCT is stressing how important the #ESSA language about "evidence-based interventions" is for school improvement.		This language is ‚Äúmaking sure you‚Äôre not just repainting the walls‚Äù and calling it school improvement, he says.
.@ChrisMurphyCT asks the panel if anyone is aware of any data showing that arming teachers makes schools safer.		No one says yes. #ESSA
.@ChrisMurphyCT says contra Alexander, Title IV language in #ESSA mentions "weapons-free schools." That makes it clear those funds were not intended to go to arm teachers, he says. 		Murphy says he wishes DeVos or her rep to answer questions about how she's handling this.
@SenBennetCO State chiefs give a variety of responses to question from Bennet about addressing equity, from state takeover of schools to virtual schooling and getting high-quality teachers into needy school communities. #ESSA
.@SenBennetCO asks the panel if anyone supports using federal money to arm teachers.		No one says yes; instead the focus is elsewhere, state chiefs say. Bunting notes her state's union opposes the idea. #ESSA
@PattyMurray @SenAlexander Alexander then moves to the issue of using #ESSA money to buy guns to arm teachers: "I am not a fan of arming teachers," he says, but indicates that the issue is ultimately up to states, according to the law.
@PattyMurray @shavarjeffries .@SenAlexander responds to Murray's contention that Betsy DeVos is approving state #ESSA plans that violate the law. 		He says after meeting with DeVos, attorneys, and others,	"I believe that she is exactly following the law in those cases."
@PattyMurray @shavarjeffries .@shavarjeffries stresses that using #ESSA to pay for guns in schools not only flouts the law, but deprives students of funds for things like music and art.		"It would contradict the equity mandates in ESSA," Jeffries tells @PattyMurray.
@PattyMurray @shavarjeffries Murray asks Jeffries about using #ESSA money for guns.		"Diverting money to send teachers to gun ranges really is preposterous," Jeffries says, when they could be teaching 5th graders fractions instead.
.@PattyMurray asks @shavarjeffries how #ESSA plans that flout the law on subgroup accountability + school improvement impacts students.		SJ: "That failure fundamentally defeats the core purpose of ESSA. ... States simply cannot close achievement gaps they don‚Äôt even know exist."
@Molly_Spearman @SenatorTimScott "ESSA has allowed us to make work a cool thing again," Spearman said, and allowed focus of schools not to be just on sending students straight to college. #ESSA
@Molly_Spearman In response to a question from @SenatorTimScott, Molly Spearman says: Education cannot solve the problems in these distressed communities alone. 		But it can be an important piece when it comes to building relationships with local businesses and jobs, she stresses. #ESSA
@Molly_Spearman South Carolina's Spearman says the state plan's focuses on CTE programs, military path for students, and rural schools.		"Without the flexibility of ESSA, these triumphs that we know are going to happen could not be," @Molly_Spearman says. #ESSA
.@Molly_Spearman says the message from her school communities was clear: No Child Left Behind was not working for them any more, and South Carolina students were not prepared for many jobs in the state. #ESSA
.@shavarjeffries praises D.C.'s #ESSA plan but says, "Other state plans clearly violate the statute."
.@shavarjeffries says despite "yawning achievement gaps" between student groups at one New Jersey high school, Montclair High School, the #ESSA accountability system let the school off the hook.
Not everything is hunky-dory with #ESSA, Bunting tells the committee. The state's attempt to integrate science and social studies into the academic achievement indicators for school accountability was shot down by Betsy DeVos, she notes. 		(Hunky-dory? Hunky-dorey? Hunky-dorie?)
"No longer is a single office in the department responsible for school improvement," Delaware's Bunting tells the committee. She said this allows school improvement to be better tailored to individual schools. #ESSA
Delaware schools chief Susan Bunting says #ESSA has "harnessed the energy in state and local communities" to craft a strong plan.
@NDE_Commish ‚ÄúESSA has allowed us to better align federal programs ‚Ä¶ that would not have been allowed under No Child Left Behind without significant waivers from that law," @NDE_Commish tells the Senate education committee. #ESSA
@PattyMurray .@NDE_Commish tells the committee that under #ESSA, the federal government is now a "strong partner" in helping the states' schools achieve their goals, such as cutting the share of non-proficient students by half over 10 years and addressing "historic gaps" between students.
@philissa https://t.co/rKqpDuqsdM
@PattyMurray Murray notes that the 1 percent cap on share of students with severe cognitive disabilities taking alternative assessments is extremely important; says DeVos has not been transparent about waivers from this requirement in #ESSA.
@PattyMurray "Our federal education law should not be focused solely on making states‚Äô lives easier," @PattyMurray says in her opening statement at the #ESSA hearing.
Moving to criticisms of DeVos' #ESSA plan approvals @PattyMurray says DeVos has approved plans that don't follow that law so that, "A school make look like it is succeeding, even if all the African-American students or students with disabilities, for example, are falling behind."
Murray says Congress could and should work together to stop DeVos from letting #ESSA money from going to pay for guns in schools. 		She also points out that in 20 months, neither DeVos nor any of her staffers have testified before the Senate education committee.
.@PattyMurray starts off by blasting Betsy DeVos for allowing federal Title IV money to pay for guns in schools. "We need fewer firearms in schools, not more," Murray says. #ESSA
@SenAlexander Alexander highlights what he says is innovation in state plans, like South Carolina's decision to use Title I money for dual-credit and advanced coursework. #ESSA
@SenAlexander .@SenAlexander notes that 49 states plus D.C. plus Puerto Rico have had their #ESSA plans approved. The state without approval from Betsy DeVos? Florida, one of her favorite states when it comes to education policy.
.@SenAlexander kicks things off. 	"You can expect vigorous back and forth" between the senators, he tells the audience, noting that it is a large audience. Starts off by highlighting a Tenn. teachers' letter praising the flexibility #ESSA provides schools.

Lawmakers Strike Deal on Education Spending, Omit Ban on Money for Guns https://t.co/00tRZOOxqD
Congress has reached a deal on education spending. Next step: Lawmakers passing it and Trump signing it. https://t.co/CSr1woyZfU
The House and Senate still each need to pass the agreement, which includes spending for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Defense, in addition to Education. 		(So often people say "Labor-HHS" and leave out the 'Education" when talking about this bill, but bwahaha not us!)
In the summary provided by congressional leaders, there is no mention of funding for the Trump administration's school choice initiatives.		Also no mention of any funding to implement Trump's proposed merger of Education and Labor.		If they're left out, it's not a surprise.
More details of the deal:	-Charter school grants get  $440 million, a $40 million increase.	-Impact Aid gets $1.4 billion, a $32 million increase.	-Career, Technical, and Adult Education gets $1.9 billion, a $95 million increase.	-Maximum Pell Grant goes up $100 to $6,195.
More on the Education Department spending deal:	-Total $ is $71.5 billion, a $581 million increase	-Title IV Pt. A, the grants at the heart of the "arming teachers" fight, gets $1.17 billion, a $70 million increase	-Special education gets $12.4 billion, a $87 million increase
The education spending deal reached in Congress today includes a $299 million increase spread across four prominent programs: Title I for disadvantaged students, special education, Title IV Part A (the program at the center of the arming-teachers fight), and Impact Aid.

House Democrats recently asked Betsy DeVos, Alex Azar, and other cabinet secretaries about the services being provided to these children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border: https://t.co/At5vQnJ1iw
@rosadelauro "The Trump administration has no claim check for these children. And it is by design," @rosadelauro says, adding that some children on their border may never see their parents again.
@rosadelauro "What is the most horrific thing you can do to people to deter people from coming to the United States? It is: You take their children away from them," @rosadelauro tells the House committee.
@BetsyDeVosED "The bill does nothing to address the crisis on the border," @rosadelauro says of the House bill. She says it is "government-sanctioned child abuse" and calls the Trump administration's approach cruel.

Tom Cole running over some education highlights in the spending bill:	1) CTE spending is up by $115 million	2) After-school spending is flat.	3) $100 million increase for flexible block grant for districts (Title IV)	4) Special education spending gets a $50 million boost.

Ivanka Trump recently went to Capitol Hill to push for a career and technical education bill, so she's especially happy about today's vote. https://t.co/CjQnPatwXO
.@timkaine: "Perkins is one of the great education bills" because the money isn't just dumped into predetermined silos. #CTE
.@SenToddYoung just used the phrase "jot and tittle" about a predictive-analytics bill. So that's a highlight of the day.
Important and substantive news flash: Ivanka Trump has left the Senate education committee.
First mention of arming teachers is an hour and half into meeting. "What happens if that person doesn't get to the shooter" says Ohio law enforcement officer.
Senate education committee reports the #CTE reauthorization bill favorably to the full Senate unanimously.
.@SenBobCasey cites the reasonable reporting requirements of data, the requirements for disaggregated data by subgroups, and focus on specialized programs of study that promote equity in the #CTE legislation: "This bill will help students, programs, and industries" nationwide.
RT @MelLeonor_: Second roundtable is starting. Here's a list of participants from today's roundtables: https://t.co/gw3eG0b241
Sen. Enzi notes that the Perkins #CTE law was last reauthorized in 2006.
@PattyMurray Sen. Mike Enzi, one of the authors of the Senate career and technical education bill: "It‚Äôs one that really has a lot of potential to really solve a lot of problems for this country." Says too many districts don't take federal #CTE money because of how burdensome it can be.
"We couldn‚Äôt just pass the bill for the sake of passing a bill. We needed to get this right," @PattyMurray says of the #CTE bill. Thanks Sens. Casey and Enzi for their work.
And as @emrwilkins just noted, @IvankaTrump is in the front row for this Senate education committee hearing that will consider the career and technical education bill.
@SenAlexander @SenBobCasey @SenatorEnzi "I‚Äôm glad that we‚Äôre moving forward in a bipartisan way," Alexander says. He also notes that he's pleased to be on the same page as the Trump administration on the #CTE bill.
@SenAlexander Alexander praises @SenBobCasey and @SenatorEnzi for their work on the #CTE bill; notes that the legislation would mean states need no longer ask the education secretary "Mother may I?" on key CTE decisions. ("Mother may I" is another favorite phrase of Alexander's, we think.)
.@SenAlexander on #CTE reauthorization, notes that Tennessee spent about 10x as much on CTE as it got from the feds for CTE: "This is a partnership with states, and states are really the senior partner."
The Senate education committee is holding a 2:30 hearing on a bill reauthorizing the federal career and technical education law. The Trump administration likes the legislation. So what's in it? https://t.co/J9jigjN8Pa
KY's interim chief says that school resource officers can form relationships with students that adults can't. He sees SROs as a big possible solution to the school shooting problem. Two sites of recent deadly shootings - Stoneman Douglas &amp; Santa Fe H.S. - had SROs.
.@GovMattBevin appears to tell @realDonaldTrump safety commission that government might want to consider an age limit for the purchase of cell phones. He does not suggest a similar age limit for the purchase of guns.
.@GovMattBevin tells the commission that doctors are prescribing psychotropic drugs for children and that's a reason that school shootings are happening.

"Why are we eliminating programs that try to make our schools safer?" @rosadelauro	asks. "Why are we not funding research into gun violence? Children are dying."
DeLauro criticizes the spending bill for cutting out two school safety programs: Project AWARE at SAMHSA, and School Safety National Activities at the U.S. Department of Education.
@rosadelauro DeLauro is blasting the Trump administration's policy of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents when they cross the border illegally, says this will inflict "lifelong scars on children."
.@rosadelauro, the committee's top Democrat, questions why the Labor-HHS-Education bill overall is not getting additional resources despite the recent budget deal and freed-up cash.
Tom Cole also notes the $100 million for Title IV Part A, the big block grant for districts. "These funds can be used flexibly by school districts across the country," Cole says, for school safety and more.
The bill's $115 million increase for career and technical education, Tom Cole says, is "in response to member interest" in helping students find alternatives to four-year college degrees. #CTE
State grants for special education are getting a $50 million boost. Rep. Tom Cole says: "Hopefully this will help school districts ease the burden of providing specialized education services."

House Spending Bill Would Give Small Boost to Education, Reject Cuts by DeVos https://t.co/EG3l3jxmHp
One note on the spending bill that doesn't deal directly with the @usedgov budget: The House Labor-HHS-Ed bill would eliminate funding for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, consistent with Trump's budget request.
And overall, the federal Department of Education @usedgov is getting $71 billion, a small (or "small" in federal terms) increase of $43 million in the spending bill.
Once again, lawmakers appear to be rejecting the @BetsyDeVosED proposal to cut federal after-school (21st Century Community Learning Centers) funds: This House appropriations bill flat-funds the program at about $1.2 billion.
And Title IV Part A, the big block grant that schools can use for everything from school safety to ed-tech, gets a $100 million boost up to $1.2 billion. More on that grant: https://t.co/swIaU9ba6J
Federal special education funding appears to be getting a small boost of about $55 million in the bill, up to a little more than $13.4 billion.
A few takeaways from the bill: The office for civil rights would be flat-funded at $117 million. @BetsyDeVosED has sought cuts to that office.
The House education appropriations bill for @usedgov is here: https://t.co/oysvNxLN2m

@EdWorkforce It's critical for authorizers to also do their part; the accountability needs to be to the closest level of the student, Foxx says.
@EdWorkforce On charters, Foxx notes that there have been concerns raised due to "lax oversight of the schools." Much of the discussions, she says, boils down to accountability.
@EdWorkforce Polis says charters in his home state are worried about DACA. Nina Rees: We stand with charter school students and teachers who benefit from DACA, and Congress must deal with this issue.
@Ninacharters "Not all school choice is equal," @RepJaredPolis, who's had a lot of involvement in charter schools over the years, tells @EdWorkforce.
.@Ninacharters: We shouldn't entirely get rid of online charters because they're the only option for some students, but at the same time, "Their achievement hasn‚Äôt kept par with where we want to be as a community."
.@GOPHELP &amp; @HELPCmteDems will consider a bill to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act next week, plus the nomination of Scott Stump to serve as asst. sec. for CTE.
Jonathan Clark says he's not here to bash charter schools, but that accountability for those schools is key.
.@Ninacharters says she hopes school leaders visit Indiana to see how the charter sector there operates.
Clark's anti-charter message to @EdWorkforce is clear: Charters make a lot of promises, but they've broken the promises they've made to him and his children, and leave behind severe problems when they close.
Jonathan Clark notes that charters that closed down have left behind vacant buildings in his Brightmoor neighborhood of Detroit: "That‚Äôs a serious safety issue. An abandoned building is a haven for crime and blight."
@EdWorkforce @ProfMartyWest .@Ninacharters says there are ways to address the facilities challenges charters face, but notes that in her view, ultimately, "This is a state and local issue, and we think it should be dealt with at the state level, primarily."
@EdWorkforce .@ProfMartyWest pushes back on what he says is the common refrain that charter school performance overall is "mixed." Says the performance of the sector is improving over time, compared to the "stagnation" of traditional public schools.
"Michigan‚Äôs charter sector has allowed schools to promise things and not deliver them," Clark tells @EdWorkforce.
Parent Jonathan Clark, who said he's had negative experiences with Detroit charters: "I would not wish Michigan charter policies on the nation."
White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley says @IvankaTrump will meet with senators on Capitol Hill this week to push them to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Carer and Technical Education Act. The House passed a Perkins reauthorization bill last year. https://t.co/Vqx2tcbryi
Accountability is a central value of charter schools, Rees says, but charters can also cut through bureaucratic obstacles to learning.
@Ninacharters Nina Rees rebuts argument from Bobby Scott when she says charters are more likely to enroll students from diverse backgrounds.
.@Ninacharters starts off by saying: "Charter schools are public schools." Says they provide a variety of learning models.
@BobbyScott @AriannaProthero .@BobbyScott links growth of charters to increase in school segregation, says number of charter schools that are segregated has increased :Choice devoid of protections to improve diversity will exacerbate segregation."
@BobbyScott @AriannaProthero Scott says more must be done to clean up the charter school sector "before we increase funding and promote the expansion of public school choice at the expense of increasing federal investment in core programs like Title I."
@BobbyScott @AriannaProthero Scott says, "Michigan used charters to dismantle and undermine the public system."
.@BobbyScott revives the debate over the performance of Michigan and Detroit's charter school sector; he says their record is a ‚Äústain on the record of public school choice.‚Äù Background via @AriannaProthero: https://t.co/BMxmV7j2YO
@virginiafoxx .@BobbyScott gives the fish-eye to Foxx's opening statement and the composition of those testifying, saying that the hearing's title suggests charters are nothing but good.
@virginiafoxx Foxx says that she spoke at the commencement at Millenium charter school in her home district, and saw the school's success firsthand. Says charters can inspire "a lifelong love of learning."
"Charter schools also face rigorous accountability," says @virginiafoxx.
Foxx notes that #ESSA made changes to the federal charter school program.
@EdWorkforce @BetsyDeVosED And we're off. @virginiafoxx is presiding over this hearing on charter schools @EdWorkforce. Says the hearing will focus on the "invaluable roles these institutions play in the lives of millions of students."

@RepDeSaulnier .@RepDeSaulnier asks: If those state bans on public $ going to private schools are bigoted, isn't also bigoted when an Indiana private school discriminates against LGBTQ students? #DeVosHearing
@RepDeSaulnier DeVos: "I believe that it continues to be a real impediment to familes‚Äô ability to improve education as they desire for their children." #DeVosHear
@BetsyDeVosED @virginiafoxx @CongressmanRaja .@RepDeSaulnier asks @BetsyDeVosED about her comments that state prohibitions on public funds going to private schools are "bigoted." More: https://t.co/5vmJjJnW0P
@BetsyDeVosED @virginiafoxx Now @CongressmanRaja is asking DeVos to define "conflict of interest" in the context of one of her political appointees. Democrats have been keen to ask DeVos to define things in this hearing. #DeVosHearing
And ... we're back. Or at least @BetsyDeVosED and @virginiafoxx are back. Several of us education reporters never left.
@RepJimBanks Banks says the amount of Impact Aid $ that would be used for his school choice program would be "miniscule" and that his colleagues misunderstand it. By contrast, @NAFISschools says the amount of money could be up to $450 million. #DeVosHearing
.@Lily_NEA jokes that she got into teaching for the money at Democrats' press conference touting more money for K12. https://t.co/bD9t0IGvat
@RepJimBanks Banks asks: My own bill aside, does the Trump team support creating education savings accounts for military families? DeVos: Yes. #DeVosHearing
@RepJimBanks DeVos: I think using education savings accounts to further choice for our military families is a great idea. "The disruption for their children over the course of that career can be very painful." Says in some cases, "It can be good" but we should be more sensitive. #DeVosHearing
.@RepJimBanks asks DeVos to define the difference between vouchers and education savings accounts. (Banks wants to turn a portion of Impact Aid $ into ESAs.) DeVos: the funding for them is handled differently. #DeVosHearing
Blunt Rochester says she's hoping to hear a vision and a plan from DeVos on racial disparities in special education. #DeVosHearing
Blunt Rochester: What are you doing to close the racial gaps in students with disabilities? DeVos: It's key to treat students as individuals and ensure they get access to the appropriate educational opportunities. #DeVosHearing
@RepJimBanks Blunt Rochester: Is the segregation of special education students a civil rights issue, and what can the department do on this issue? DeVos: I'm committed to supporting the law as Congress has written it. #DeVosHearing
As we noted earlier, the Trump administration has stated that it does not support the @RepJimBanks bill for converting a portion of Impact Aid $ into education savings accounts.
Rep. Blunt Rochester asks DeVos if she supports the Banks bill for Impact Aid-school choice. DeVos: I support more choice for military families. #DeVosHearing
This is the Democrats' plan for K12. Bottom line: More money and more support for teachers. https://t.co/zhttS5Ij9J
Now that @BetsyDeVosED has had her say, the Democrats are unveiling their plan on education. Spoiler: More $ for k12. https://t.co/rRhVlSB3KG
Florida's recent NAEP results show that school choice and the state's approach to education can work for struggling students, DeVos says. (MisNAEPery alert? No sarcasm, seriously asking) #DeVosHearing
DeVos is now talking positively about school choice in Florida. #DeVosHearing
Right on cue, @BobbyScott returns to how one can truly measure achievement gaps if subgroup performance isn't a part of school ratings. DeVos responds: Overall school ratings weren't a requirement in #ESSA, says there is a "conflation" of two issues by Scott.
Democrats have focused quite a bit on higher education issues, but have hit the hot-button K-12 issues like civil rights and #ESSA. Choice has been perhaps less of a focus than in past hearings with DeVos. #DeVosHearing
A new member of the committee, @RepJimBanks, has proposed using a portion of Impact Aid to create a new school choice program. But the Trump administration has said it *does not* support this proposal. #DeVosHearing
DeVos also says that the Trump administration is committed to funding Impact Aid. (The Trump administration has tried to cut the program, which helps districts where the tax base is impacted by federal activities, such as military bases.) #DeVosHearing
@EliseStefanik DeVos: "We have to think more broadly about how we ensure the needs of those families and give military-connected families more choices in their children‚Äôs education." #DeVosHearing
@EliseStefanik Stefanik notes she represents Fort Drum, and military families there rely on Impact Aid. Asks DeVos about its importance.
@EliseStefanik DeVos: We often think of choice as more added infrastructure. "We know that there is probably a very capable and highly qualified instructor who could teach the course to that student remotely," DeVos says. Offers the idea of a co-located "sub charter school." #DeVosHearing
.@EliseStefanik asks DeVos  about improving educational opportunities in a large, rural district like she represents: What are your ideas about rural innovation in education and more access to things like AP courses? #DeVosHearing
More: DeVos did not offer a definition of a "great teacher." #DeVosHearing
More context for the @BetsyDeVosED comments about teacher pay and the walkouts: DeVos seemed to indicate that "great teachers" deserve better compensation, but did not seem to imply that all teachers or teachers in general should be better paid. #DeVosHearing
RT @ByMoriah: Nice use of emojis, @usedgov Social Media Staffer. https://t.co/h4nvfaGpEP
Context for that last bit in the #DeVosHearing: Some have linked the PROMISE discipline policy in Broward County Schools with the shooting in Parkland, Florida; others have said the link is not at all clear.
RT @rklein90: Betsy DeVos on school discipline: "We know the data shows disparities, but the broader issue is what is ultimately right for‚Ä¶
Lewis: Do the 2014 Obama discipline guidance and discipline issues also pertain to school safety? DeVos: "Indeed it does." #DeVosHearing
DeVos says she and her team are looking at the issue closely: "It is not tolerable if a student of one color is disciplined more harshly than a student of another color for the same infraction." #DeVosHearing
Rep. Jason Lewis says teachers must be granted discretion on discipline issues. Raises 2014 discipline guidance: are decisions on this best left to educators? DeVos: We need to ensure that students are treated justly and fairly. #DeVosHearing
@RepBonamici @BetsyDeVosED Bonamici follows up on Polis question, asks if her office is investigating an incident in which LGBT Oregon students were forced to read a Bible. DeVos says if the incident comes to her office's attention, it will investigate. #DeVosHearing
