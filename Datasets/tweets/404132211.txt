Last week, I joined @RepPeterDeFazio to introduce legislation to ensure stable and predictable funding for @FAANews employees &amp; protect U.S. aviation industry from future govt shutdowns.
The partial government shutdown unnecessarily hurt American families and jeopardized the safety of the largest, busiest and most complex airspace system in the world. To use a metaphor, the lights must stay on at runways across the United States. #AviationAtRisk
Shutdown impacts on @FAANews: #AviationAtRisk	❌ Delayed implementation of safety mandates from FAA reauthorization bill	❌ Inspectors unable to approve new aircraft &amp; aviation products 	❌Halted work to streamline certification process	❌Hurt airport infrastructure projects
U.S. aviation is the gold standard of flight because of these skilled individuals. Their work ensures the safety of the traveling public and efficiency of the U.S. airspace. #AviationAtRisk
Impacts of the shutdown on aviation workforce: #AviationAtRisk	➡️Mental &amp; physical stress over next paycheck	➡️Aerospace companies feared they would need to suspend production	➡️Dipping into children’s college savings to get by
The purpose of today’s Aviation Subcommittee hearing is two-fold: create a public record of shutdown impacts on aviation/aerospace and to ensure FAA has resources and funding stability needed to preserve safety of nation’s aviation system. #AviationAtRisk

I hope the president outlines a well-thought out #infrastructure plan, maintaining federal investment in infrastructure projects to sustain and build on Washington state’s economic growth and put more folks to work.
I hope the president outlines a #trade agenda that supports local jobs and the economic stability of the U.S.
I hope the president talks about the need for increased #infrastructure investments and advanced technology at ports of entry, new technology to detect unauthorized crossings and more immigration judges and customs personnel, not the need for a wall on the Southern border.

Not mentioned in the president's speech: the 800,000 Americans working without pay or not working at all.
Instead of wasting taxpayer money on an unnecessary wall the president must reopen the government, put people back to work and give federal workers and federal contractors the back pay to which they are entitled.
Fact: There can be border security without a wall.
Fact: The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) does not include any language that Mexico will pay for the border wall.
Fact: The Drug Enforcement Agency found that most of the drugs smuggled into the U.S. through the southern border pass undetected through legal ports of entry. A wall would not stop these drugs from coming across the border.
Fact: The situation at the border is a crisis of the president’s making. The administration’s actions speak louder than words.
From claims of terrorists pouring over the southern border to claims about who will pay for the wall, many of the statements the administration has made about immigration are simply false. Follow along as I fact check the president’s immigration claims https://t.co/ajLXr4SKHJ
Whatever the president says tonight during his address about the southern border, the focus should be on the need to reopen the government, put people back to work and give federal workers and federal contractors the back pay to which they are entitled
Why fact check the president tonight? The @washingtonpost Fact Checker has documented 7,645 false or misleading claims since he took office; 1,130 of those claims were about immigration. Re-open government now, put people back to work and ensure back pay.

Far too often high-speed derailments, collisions and other hazardous rail incursions are deemed preventable. Communications and signaling safety mechanisms, like positive train control (#PTC) could save lives and lessen the likelihood of these tragedies

Since inception, WA has received over $675M in #LWCF funds to protect places like @EbeysLandingNHR, Chuckanut Bay &amp; Wild Sky Wilderness. These open spaces are important to WA conservation &amp; economy. Congress must permanently reauthorize &amp; fully fund LWCF https://t.co/ahykJS67bD

Passenger drones have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and the demands on local #infrastructure by carrying commuters through the air, at low altitudes. @TransportDems
US drivers spend, on average, 40+ hours each year in traffic during peak hours. Congestion costs drivers more than $300B per year, wasted hours, lost productivity, harms air quality &amp; enviro. @EverettCity in WA02 was rated top city for traffic congestion last year. @TransportDems

Instead of further harming local communities and environment by rolling back #CleanPowerPlan, the focus should be on investing in natural gas, wind and solar. Investing in these energy sources creates thousands of jobs in WA. The administration shouldn’t put these jobs at risk.

With an increasing number of spaceports and launches on the horizon, we must ensure that our airspace remains safe.
While we have heard these regulations are 25 years old and in desperate need or a re-write, there are concerns about the aggressive time frame.
During today’s commercial space hearing I will ask the panel about the administration’s directive to the FAA to overhaul its launch license and re-entry regulations in an aggressive one-year time frame.
The promise of commercial space is endless. But safety must remain the number one priority. More than 2.5 million passengers fly through U.S. airspace each day.
According to @WAStateCommerce, more than three dozen space-related companies are part of Washington’s space cluster, including such well-known companies as @blueorigin, @SpaceX, @SpaceflightInc @Boeing and others.
The U.S. commercial space industry represents almost half of the $345 billion global space economy. The growth supports more than 200k aerospace jobs in US. 136k of the folks in this industry call Washington state home.

Claim: “The Democrats have failed to come to the table, failed to help this president close these loopholes and fix this problem.” Fact: This administration has made the choice to implement a “zero tolerance” policy.
Claim: “We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period." Fact: Data from the Department of Homeland Security paints a different picture.
Claim: "If you don’t want your child separated, then don’t bring them across the border illegally." Fact: The U.S. government has an obligation to allow asylum seekers to come in at official ports of entry.
Claim: The administration has said, people who want to claim asylum should seek it the “right way.” Fact: There is more than one way to come to the United States and claim asylum.
From claims stating there is a “right way” to seek asylum to claims parents broke the law by seeking asylum, many of the statements the administration has made about family separation are simply false. Here are some of the facts about asylum  https://t.co/xvWEGCxyW1
I have called on Homeland Security Approps to reject blanket policy of separating families @ border. Must restore funds for community-based alternatives, like Family Case Management Program. FCMP had 99% compliance w/immigration reqs like court hearings &amp; immigration appointments
Many parents arrive at the border with their children to seek asylum. Separating children from their mothers and fathers is cruel and unacceptable. This policy is clearly not working.  https://t.co/wO9f5ZRjA9

In Whatcom County, the Northwest Regional Drug Task Force has worked effectively with the Skagit unit to take down organized and dangerous criminal enterprises w/gang and drug involvement. Without these funds, they will need to downsize. Affects officer and community safety.
The Skagit County Interlocal Drug Unit coordinates the county wide effort to combat drug suppliers. Lack of Byrne JAG funds will diminish capacity to combat organized crime in the county.
The Snohomish County Drug &amp; Gang Task Force expected to use these funds to identify drug overdose “hot spots” which assist in investigations of drug networks. Snohomish County has 2nd highest rate of overdose deaths in WA. Operating at a diminished capacity is not the solution.
I have called on the Department of Justice to distribute Byrne JAG funds so local law enforcement across the Second District can continue working to fight the #OpioidEpidemic.

Kicking off day two of my listening tour in #Everett. I’m hosting a social safety net roundtable with leaders in Snohomish County to discuss the impact Trump’s budget proposal and the Fiscal Year 18 appropriations could have on their services.

@POTUS 8/ @POTUS’ decisions, but the ball is now in Congress’ court. It's time for @PattyMurray &amp; @SenAlexander's bipartisan ACA marketplace fix.
@POTUS 7/ Sabotage US health care, for no other reason than to score political points on behalf of a 7 yr disinformation campaign against the #ACA.
@POTUS 6/ It means @POTUS, backed by Congressional Republicans, has taken a nightmarishly cynical &amp; dangerous approach on healthcare:
@POTUS 5/ These actions will ultimately drive up the cost of your health care. What does all this mean?
@POTUS 4/ Second: last night, Trump decided to stop paying the #CSR subsidies that enrollees rely on to keep premiums low.
@POTUS 3/ This will likely result in a sicker, older pool of people in the exchanges and force insurers to drive up marketplace premiums.
@POTUS 2/ First: on Weds. Trump signed an EO aimed at siphoning younger, healthier folks out of #ACA exchanges into low-quality plans.

2/ and what impact laws in host nations have on DoD’s authority to employ these defenses. #NY18NDAA
1/ My amendment would commission a report to help DoD understand technologies and tactics available to protect U.S. forces from #UAS
But the legal authorities to use these tactics will vary greatly depending on where U.S. forces are stationed #NY18NDAA
US installations &amp; forces are under threat from increasingly available UAS—&amp; our counter-UAS tactics need to address that threat. #NY18NDAA
My amendment would boost #ImpactAid funding in order to provide school districts with the resources they need to serve military students.
#ImpactAid program assists school districts w/large #s of military students, like the Oak Harbor School District in my district. #NY18NDAA.
But they also face challenges—frequent moves, the stress of a parent on deployment—that schools may not have resources to address. #NY18NDAA
Servicemembers' daughters &amp; sons are pillars of their communities—often following in their parents’ footsteps w/military careers. #NY18NDAA.
Narrowly-tailored and easy to implement – this amendment would help ensure justice for survivors of child abuse. #NY18NDAA
This amendment would close a loophole which currently shields military retirement pay from being paid to victims of child abuse. #NY18NDAA
Proud to introduce an amendment, authored by @RepDelBene, to increase accountability for child abusers. #NY18NDAA
What this Committee doesn’t need is another study to help us decide that #icebreakers are a #nationalsecurity requirement. #FY18NDAA
The U.S. can't protect its waters in the Arctic unless we can access those waters—and that requires #icebreakers. #FY18NDAA
Just bc DoD hasn’t made #icebreakers a requirement—this Committee has a history of defining defense requirements. #FY18NDAA
I want to thank @RepGaramendi &amp; @Rep_Hunter for being committed to #icebreaker issues. #FY18NDAA
2/ These issues have migrated to the Growler aircraft which are based at @NASWhidbeyIslan, and affect the growler community. #FY18NDAA
