There are Americans with heritage from every corner of the globe, drawn to this country by their love of freedom and their desire for a better life. #ToImmigrantsWithLove
Immigrants have been coming to this country for centuries, driven by the promise of a better life and the love of freedom. #ToImmigrantsWithLove
Many waters cannot quench love, rivers cannot drown it. Neither a wall nor @ICEgov can stop the love immigrant parents have for their children. #ToImmigrantsWithLove
I came to the U.S. as a child with my family, and today, it is the honor of my life to serve my community here in Congress. And I want to tell every immigrant in this country today: you are welcome here &amp; you are a valued part of our country. #ToImmigrantsWithLove https://t.co/ZasuT5jUuj
The love felt by parents trying to cross the border with their children is the same love my parents felt for me when my family immigrated from the Dominican Republic. Their families should have the same opportunities that I was given here in America. #ToImmigrantsWithLove

#Trump has endangered our children‚Äôs clean air &amp; clean water, while rolling back protections for seniors, servicemembers, veterans and working families while giving #BigPharma and big corporations a free pass to surge families‚Äô costs. #SOTU

America‚Äôs workers should never be used as political pawns. Yet, far from learning this lesson, #Trump is already threatening to shut down the government again and subject workers and the American people to even more pain and uncertainty. #SOTU
For 35 days, #Trump held hundreds of thousands of workers‚Äô paychecks &amp; countless families‚Äô financial security, health &amp; well-being hostage ‚Äì forcing workers to miss their bills and communities to lose access to critical services for their health and safety. #SOTU

Trump‚Äôs immoral, expensive &amp; ineffective border wall faces bipartisan opposition from Democrats &amp; many Republicans. There‚Äôs no excuse for letting it lead to another #TrumpShutdown! https://t.co/Z5ziIbu1pT
Why is so hard for @realDonaldTrump to accept Americans won‚Äôt support his border wall? We‚Äôve been clear on this for over a year. He needs to accept the facts, move on, and let Congress reopen the government. #NoBorderWall #TrumpShutdown
Today, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the #TrumpAdministration to restart an #AsylumBan. Like so many of the anti-immigrant policies this administration has put forth, Trump's ban should permanently be stopped by our Courts.  https://t.co/TMATBew1B8 via @usatoday

An employer can‚Äôt discriminate against someone because they:	Are pregnant, have been pregnant, or could become pregnant 	Have had an abortion or are considering having an abortion	Have a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth	All of the above	#PDA40 #PWFA

Including a citizenship question in the #2020Census only serves to suppress participation &amp; will result in inaccurate data that does not reflect the makeup of our nation. #everyonecounts #ProtectCensus https://t.co/xHjivV9hir
An accurate #2020census is critical to our nation. And the political decision by the Trump Administration to add an untested &amp; damaging question about citizenship to the #2020Census at the 11th hour will suppress participation. https://t.co/7vRayYxxoN

Forced family separation is happening in many places.  Once separated, parents are sent to ICE detention centers &amp; children are sent to shelters designated for unaccompanied children. Parents are often unable to find their children and vice versa. https://t.co/xt9sbLphEj https://t.co/fXmTcUamjk

Separating children from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal, in fact, it is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case.#FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/79x2RNjT4W

In observance of #Ramadan and every day, we must renew our commitment to understanding and compassion for all brethren within our community ‚Äì regardless of faith or belief system ‚Äì and demand decency and humanity in our treatment of everyone.
#Ramadan brings a familiar tiding to Muslims domestic and abroad, and is a time of joyous celebration, peace, and unity in our efforts to end hate and bigotry. #Ramadan2018 #RamadanKareem
While the start of the Holy Month of #Ramadan is not static, each year Muslims throughout #NY13 and across the world enter into a compact with their communities and recommit themselves to spiritual renewal and introspection.

In 2060: more than 1/4 of the US will be #tech savvy Hispanics. And they‚Äôll represent more than $1 trillion in buying power. We‚Äôve got to work to ensure that they‚Äôre better represented in companies and c-suites too. #DIVERSITYinTECH https://t.co/tJfEACG23D

The fight to protect Americans from #GunViolence doesn‚Äôt stop at the door to leave school. For too many Americans, gun violence is a daily tragedy. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/RDwJtZcsIM
There is only one common thread across the gun violence epidemic in America ‚Äì guns. Attempting to address this problem without addressing ‚Äì or even acknowledging ‚Äì that fact is missing the point. #NeverAgain https://t.co/VYt1n8omAK
How much longer will @SpeakerRyan refuse to take action to #EndGunViolence? #Enough #NeverAgain
No one fix will #EndGunViolence, but we have a good idea of where to start:	-Pass the bipartisan Thompson-King bill to expand background checks	-Pass the Background Check Completion Act, which will require background to be *completed* before a gun sale can be finalized
Americans want action to #EndGunViolence. In fact, 97% of gun owners want to see Congress require background checks for all gun buyers. When will @HouseGOP let us act? #NeverAgain
Republicans‚Äô self-professed love for President Reagan is hard to square with their rejection of his common-sense approach to guns. #CommonSense #GunReform https://t.co/tjrPaJ9ZZ5

Yet, the #Starbucks incident, alongside mass incarceration and police brutality, shares a common thread with that of Jim Crow, one of the darkest periods of America‚Äôs history that continues to rear its ugliness as our nation struggles to move forward.
The recent event in #Philadelphia, told us this isn‚Äôt a #Starbucks issue, but an American one ‚Äì and an issue that our nation has failed to resolve. We are grateful that Rashon Nelson &amp; Donte Robinson lived to tell of their experience. https://t.co/TF1A9FzYr3
If Trump‚Äôs changes to the ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù rule are enacted, parents will be forced to choose between citizenship &amp; their child‚Äôs health, putting food on the table, or making ends meet. This is a betrayal of our values &amp; immigrant roots. https://t.co/Vmx3n2wTCb
Trump wants to keep families apart by expanding the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù to include programs related to health, well-being, &amp; education of immigrants. This only serves to segregate immigrant communities &amp; perpetuate poverty. https://t.co/cOBa53cAxR
Expanding the definition of ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù to discriminate &amp; hurt immigrant families runs counter to American ideals. Immigrants built this country. The DHS under Trump is blind to this truth that was self-evident to the founders of this nation. https://t.co/41m2rSvAc0
