@rkasturi Yes completely agree. No reckless/insane Musharraf types this time.
Having said that perfectly fine with both sides fighting virtual wars to placate public anger rather than actually killing people and risking horrible escalation. Same thing happened last time with "surgical strikes" that India said it carried out and Pakistan denied happening.

People should continue to be highly critical of elites who have proven to be serial failures or morally compromised. At the same time, in my opinion, there should be degree of understanding and compromise with people who are able to grow and take their responsibilities seriously.
@UnlearningEcon @mehdirhasan Yeah it’s hilarious. I suspect it’s because they’ve been praised as brilliant their whole lives and never had to confront the trauma of hearing what the public actually thinks of them (those that have committed serial failures).
@WendyPetrin Yes agreed
@bintabuahmed_ Yes it is good
At the same time lots of very smart and responsible people have also had a chance to get a hearing, many of whom have the benefit of not being saddled with the arrogance that may come from being undeservedly lauded by elite institutions their whole lives.
This does not by default mean that the public as a whole is better. But  it has become undeniable that many people in prestigious elite positions are extremely mediocre and in some cases even genuine maniacs and charlatans.
One of the consequences of social media has been to bring elites into closer proximity with the public, whereas they would have once been mostly remote and inaccessible. This proximity has revealed many of them to be not very smart, morally vacuous or otherwise deeply flawed.

@BLKGirlFound I didn’t even know you were there!
If something is wrong in your home, you are going to say it because you belong in that place and are not a guest. If you pay your labor in taxes to build a place you expect it to reflect your values to some degree, including the debates over its foreign policy.
@zaron5551 I’m planning to review it for the Intercept soon
If you pay a lifetime of your labor and taxes into a place, and maybe your parents and grandparents did too, that’s your home. Your Real Home™ is not some undisturbed village on another continent; the narrative of those who think minorities are guests &amp; should behave as such.
This also extends to the former British Empire. If you're South Asian and live in a Commonwealth country for instance, you've lived under the influence British institutions for something like ten generations. No one is an alien and under globalization everyone has to accept this.
Also, if the major trauma of modern France is the period of the Vichy Regime— it is worth noting that most of the Free French Army were African or Arab. The descendants of those who fought the Nazis to liberate France are less French than those who worked with them? Seems off.
One thing that struck me in reporting this piece is how long Africans and Arabs and have been governed by France. Most have lived under French governance for generations, stretching back to history of Algeria and Mali. They are not guests to tiptoe around. https://t.co/DUSnNYfIYU

The irony of bot armies created by governments to influence discourse is that instead of speaking from authority and expecting people to listen they’re actually trying to spread their message by impersonating the public itself. The base of legitimacy and authority has moved.
@faysalitani Yes agreed also there’s no guarantee that the reenfranchised public is wiser than the people they’re attacking
Speaking as a pleb I would also note that oftentimes the public is also wrong and behaves irrationally. Social media is also obviously great for promoting people’s basest instincts and spreading conspiracies/misinformation. Also a posture of permanent protest can be nihilistic.
@Maq_one @IbnKhayyam I didn’t say social media itself was egalitarian, I said it levels elite-public relationships. It’s obviously great for racist mobs too.
In the past powerful people have invested a lot in controlling public information about themselves. This is the only way we have pristine images of pre-modern political leaders and intellectuals. Much harder today to hide serious personal and professional flaws from the public.

@kamel_altamimi There’s a good and a bad side
@IbnKhayyam Both those people’s also use social media very effectively, as Palestinians especially did during the last war. Better to have NYT coverage with no feedback?
Ultimately the pretense behind being awarded prestigious jobs in newspapers and academia is that the people holding these roles are somehow esteemed by the public. When it becomes clear the public considers many people in these roles to be laughingstocks it is unsustainable.
Social media is lethal for the reputation of elites. There’s no previous generation where establishment foreign policy thinkers or billionaire barons would have their prestige reduced by getting “ratio’d” or having professional failures rubbed in their faces. Very egalitarian.

When confronted with a morally outrageous criminal the natural human instinct is to disregard convoluted procedure and just send that person to the gallows, dungeon or exile. The point of the law is to suppress instinct and punish people legally to the benefit of long-term good.

Not trying them legally would reinforce the narrative of these people that they were never subject to the law and were thus never really considered citizens of the places that they were from, with the legal responsibilities that citizenship entails.
Seems obvious that Western ISIS members in captivity should be repatriated to face criminal charges in their home countries. We give legal due process to serial killers and rapists all the time, the whole point of having a justice system is to deal with people who transgress it.

@Discipulus_6 Occams Razor to mesuggests that she’s not anti-Semitic. People are drawing conclusions from tropes which are not obvious to everyone.
Ultimately the point is regardless of what you want to say, Never Tweet, unless your name happens to be Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
@ShafikFM Yeah that’s exactly it, this is not the medium. I’m sure if she issues vetted press releases there’d be no room for ambiguity. No ones even talking about the core issue now it’s all about allegations of anti Semitism.
Which is why it should be done carefully and effectively, not haphazardly on social media especially when lots of people were already planning to come for you no matter what you said even if messaging was unambiguous.
I’m glad there are people willing to talk about how Palestinians are unfairly treated in the U.S. Congress, which has probably been one of the most anti-Palestinian institutions in the world. I know lots of Jewish Americans are also unhappy with status quo &amp; want issues broached.
It’s also interesting that within a few months Omar went from telling questioners at an event that BDS is “not helpful” to being the public face of BDS. Kind of suggests that positions are being taken ad hoc in response to public prompting instead of being the result of planning.
The last issue of all anyone should be doing this for is Israel-Palestine which is an obvious minefield and should be approached with the greatest precision and forethought, especially if you’re a major elected official.
Unless you’re brilliant online like AOC or even Trump (yes) it’s not good to freelance public statements on social media. It doesn’t help any cause you’re discussing and there’s plenty of rope with which to hang yourself. Kind of amazed Ilhan Omar’s staffers don’t manage this.

@Wonko_the_sane_ @AliTahmizian Yes exactly I don't think that many people thinking wisely or seriously about the issue would agree that it's good. But most people do not think so wisely and the general public on any issue is certainly geared towards responding to splashy or symbolic gestures.
@Wonko_the_sane_ @AliTahmizian The point you mentioned regarding the peace process would represent a thoughtful, strategic conception of what is good for Israel in the long term. But it would not match instant-gratification use of FP issues as tool for domestic politics that this admin and its backers embrace.
@Wonko_the_sane_ @AliTahmizian They've done some things like moving the embassy to Jerusalem and cutting UNRWA funding that were attention-grabbing and may have reaped some political rewards. The long-term trends that they're setting seem less wise or thoughtful.
@ShafikFM If they were going to serve that stereotypical flavorless chicken breast or salmon with a few decorative vegetables I'd take the burger.
@Wonko_the_sane_ @AliTahmizian I guess it is rhetorically pro-Israel, which is what matters for the Evangelical base that he's signaling towards. Whether it is actually good for Israel in reality is another question.

Also unique in this case how quickly help arrived, which isn’t the norm. The Syrian woman in Malaysia wore a hijab &amp; wasn’t fleeing something exciting like her barbaric culture; just a boring thing like a war. People like that also deserve things to be moved around to help them.
@Kifah212 She’s also extremely young, she could be making a huge mistake or acting on impulse. Its entirely possible, but it is separate from the structural issue I am talking about. It will continue to cause problems for Saudi Arabia if contradictions are not resolved.
@Kifah212 The thing is it’s not about her. As long as antiquated laws exist anyone who says that they were abused will have plausible grounds for saying that the government is complicit in it. I know that she is from a privileged background.
I’m glad in this case someone was helped who needed help, but I don’t think there’s room to morally posture. It gives impression that the only people who matter are from rich backgrounds that can afford hotels or flights, or who by being helped can be used to look down on Arabs.
She was from Homs, three years ago she had left Syria &amp; this is where she ended up. I’ve met many such people, including many women, in camps or living homeless or nearly homeless. In response “civilized” countries compete to show their public who can be more hostile to refugees.
This case also reminded me of something however. A few years ago I was in Malaysia traveling for work and I met a young Syrian woman who was literally living in a small park in Kuala Lumpur with her young daughter. She had nowhere to go, she was just living there.
Young women will definitely run away from such a situation. When they do they will blame their country, their culture, Islam, and whatever else it was they had been suppressed in the name of. The contradiction of a modernizing society and paternalism can’t be maintained.
Genuinely hope this case is a wake up call to some Saudi leaders. There’s no way that educated women in a modernizing society are going to put up with the existence of paternalistic “guardianship laws”. If not ended there will be many more cases like this: https://t.co/DcfGwURkiP

@THE_47th @shawncarrie How do you define fair
@CybereVitas Yes it is terrible. We shouldn’t accept them dying like that.
It’s even more baffling because there is in aggregate far more wealth in the United States. Can only conclude that wealthy people are not paying their share and that lots of money is being wasted on wars.
As a non-rich person I pay basically the same taxes living in the United States that I did living in Canada. In return there is no medical care, poor infrastructure, high cost of schooling. I don’t get it or how Americans accept this as normal.
@THE_47th In the United States there is a huge problem with crumbling infrastructure, no funding for medical care or social services. It is getting worse since rich people’s taxes were dropped from the rates they were from the 1930s to 1980s. Taxes are normal way to address.
@THE_47th No that’s living in a society. Ordinary middle class people are paying 40% right now.
@THE_47th It’s not like people are slaving away working for their 40 millionth dollar of the year, most of that income is bonuses and financial deals by a small class of people.
@THE_47th It’s not 70% of their income it’s 70% on top of what they’ve already made after 10 million https://t.co/Mr5Z6Lmcly

@RashaAlAqeedi I mean, yes a lot of things are off. I was only responding to your original point though. There is not a necessary contradiction between praising the good things about a place and criticizing the bad things, that’s healthy.
@RashaAlAqeedi I didn’t say you were personally right-wing, let alone clueless. Its just that sentiment you described about not criticizing ones own country is an extremely right-wing one that is not recognizable to most Americans, even if it might be(?) commonplace in Iraq.
@RashaAlAqeedi *projecting
@RashaAlAqeedi I don’t think America is much like Iraq to be honest. I would hesitate protecting the politics of either place upon the other.
@RashaAlAqeedi Sure, but this is an extremely right-wing nationalist perspective that a majority of Americans don’t even share. They’re mostly OK with criticizing their own country.
@RashaAlAqeedi I don’t know but I disagree with your point that you have to accept things as a totality and not think critically about their components. America (and other places) is not a monolith.
@RashaAlAqeedi I see. The thing is that you can celebrate the good things about a place and also criticize the bad. Just because you like democracy doesn’t mean that you also have to say imperialism is good, especially since many Americans themselves disagree with government policies.

@ShafikFM The amazing thing about the book is that the name Donald Trump isn’t mentioned even once. Too embarrassing to be associated.
@ShafikFM IMO maybe the most despicable part of the book is at the end, where after making a solid case that immigrants are harbingers of rape and jihad, he laments that “some extremists over there” are calling them rape-fugees.
@ShafikFM Honestly the relentless case he makes for the horribleness of Muslims right down to the last page makes anything other than genocide/ethnic cleansing seem like a non sequitur. The whole book is emotional priming.

Maybe things will become relatively worse in his absence but it shows how terrible things had already become that someone like this was considered the last great hope for moderation. The guy had an ugly record and was also glad to sign up for the Trump agenda in the first place.
Have to say Mattis seemed to deliberately cultivate an image of being a bloodthirsty psychopath, right down to his nickname. He was also implicated in at least one incident (the Mukaradeeb Wedding Massacre) that would be considered a war crime if he’d been part of a losing army.

@JeremyMcLellan In general being willing to color outside of other people's lines is a good trait to cultivate, very liberating as you said.
@JeremyMcLellan I actually dislike this quote because it suggests that it was primarily just some marginal greaseballs who were opposed to the war (probably by default too). Outside of US/UK all the liberal centrists were against it. Even Obama was against it!

Its clear now that world attention is decisively shifting to stories related to great power conflicts with China and Russia, as well as domestic elite corruption, technology etc. There will still be jihadist attacks sometimes as well as troubles in MENA but world is moving on.
For a few years jihadism was the biggest story in the world, building off previous attention caused by 9/11 and then sustained through the occupation of Iraq. Finally when public was tired of the subject there was a final explosion of interest triggered by the Arab Spring &amp; ISIS.
Important piece. I'd also argue that one way or another international attention on the phenomenon of jihadism has peaked and is going to continue deteriorating as time goes on. Becoming an unremarkable negative externality of international system, like cartels, mafias etc. https://t.co/3KkwEUuIiK
