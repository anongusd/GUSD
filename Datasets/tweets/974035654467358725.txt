@Ocasio2018 “Stem climate change.” Our planet has undergone change for its entire existence as do people, it is not right to try and “stop” the planet from changing. Change means growth, it’s not always pleasant, but it can’t be stopped, it shouldn’t be stopped.
@Psalm23vs4_6 @LouisFarrakhan You can’t prove an opinion...it’s no different than proving someone is racist. Please stop listening to this anti-Semite and go back to school to get an education.
@LouisFarrakhan Which is why we will continuously fight and denounce you for your anti-semitism. Where ever you go we will be there.
@allinwithchris @jonfavs @neal_katyal How many times before has that sentence been uttered by fellow liberals?
@GeraldoRivera @ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump It’s not “free.” Let’s just get a few billionaire or tv show hosts chip in a few dollars and that’ll solve the problem. Let’s not take tax dollars from Americans outside of the top .1%.
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju What are you talking about? Look I respect that you’re trying but you’re incoherent. There’s no beginning, middle or end to whatever you’re tying to say. Have a nice night.
@LouisFarrakhan Then why do you keep opening your mouth? 😂
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju I care so far as trying to figure out what you’re saying. I don’t care that you disagree so long as you can support your argument with facts. However, you haven’t done so, you’ve simply made your opinions known.
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju I don’t care what your positions are actually. This is a democracy. We aren’t all supposed to agree. We aren’t brown shirts or Nazis, well some Americans sure are. I find your positions incoherent, inconsistent and contradictory to other positions you hold.
@keithellison It’s the Jews fault right? That’s what your leader Farrakhan told you right?
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju You’re not making much sense. You seem to keep changing your positions. Have a nice day.
@malik1955 @LouisFarrakhan You keep coming back and ignore everything he says and then ask me to reference his anti-semitism which you don’t believe is. I get that you’re manipulated and not well educated and I choose to ignore you because you’re hopeless.
@NoIodineGoiter @IlhanMN https://t.co/WhqOij12Bi	It’s sad to see that you’ve been lied too and deceived so much. And the wealthy pay far more than their “fair share.”
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju So it’s republicans who have stopped numerous trump efforts. And if you don’t believe that then you must believe everything is getting passed, which isn’t true.
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju Right most are kin lock step with him at various times over various issues. However, Rand Paul, Lisa Collins, Murkowski, Flake, Corker, Ryan, McConnell, and so many others have publicly disagreed with him and contradicted him and didn’t support his plans.
@IlhanMN Hahaha hope to terrorists, change to the lives of Jews, and work to find new ways to tax the wealthy who already pay over 80% of this country’s taxes.
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju Well if you think no republicans are stopping him and the house and senate are held by the republicans who do you think has been stopping him? And if it hasn’t been a Republican then you must admit that everything he wants is getting accomplished so long as it requires majority.
This the opinion you get from someone who doesn’t understand the subject but knows how cnn and msnbc spews democrat propaganda. https://t.co/02eQM4QPaR
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju There have been countless efforts where the Republicans have vocally disagreed and elected members have acted, McCain, Flake, Corker has opposed him, Graham, private Republican citizens as well. I’m glad you think Trump is winning everything but he isn’t.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenMikeLee @SenSanders Move forward WITH A DEBATE, oh my god, it’s so monumental to see congress agree to debate, even though that’s there job. Will the democrats be honest about anything Jesus. Witnessing the dumbing down of America has been so painful.
@RandPaul And in other words we are going to allow Iran to take over another country that it destroyed. As hundreds of thousands of not million innocent Muslims were and are being murdered our congress is pulling out. WWIII here we come! Apathy is death.
@SenSanders Let’s just let Iran destroy Yenen like it did syria. Democrats supporting another massacre of hundreds of thousands if not millions of innocent civilians. Awesome!!
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju Yea, the democrat party requires strict obedience to the leadership. They look bad for sure but I don’t find this healthy. No one was even allowed to challenge her seriously, or no one had The courage.
@rebekahkfreitas @mkraju Oh yea I get that part. I’m just surprised by her comments. She should have been supported unanimously. Pretty sure it’s better to have her than someone even more far left.
@Noelle_808 @SenSanders Really the terrorists of the USA? Tell me more about the militaries of countries that come to the aid of the murdered? Iran? France? Russia? China? Great Britain? Cuba? Venezuela? Haha
@mkraju Lol really? Because it sounds like she’s pretty short of ALL the democrats elected to the house.
@DavidWright_CNN Oh please run! I’m not sure who I want to see Trump destroy more, there are just so many democrats that he should end with a 2020 victory.
@cenkuygur @HuffPostPol Start a new party.
@SenSanders Because then you can just allow Iran to take over Yemen as they took over Syria and parts of Iraq. What a surprise. Democrats support terrorists.
@LouisFarrakhan Just an anti-Semite who lies to people who want to be lied to
@TopRopeTravis Clown. Fool. Democrat.
@SenSanders It was President Obama who FUNDED the Iranian support of Houthi rebels responsible for killing and staving millions of Yemenis. Their blood is on your hands.

@chefghubb21 @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Please stop quoting the CHRISTIAN Bible. It’s not the word of God. Christianity is a divergence and bastardization of Judaism and ignores the main tenant of the Torah which is that there is only 1 God and only God should be praised.
@Ocasio2018 “Jails children,” such an outrageous and naive comment. But that shouldn’t surprise anyone. You weren’t elected for your intelligence, you were elected because you make ridiculous promises to people that know nothing about economics or the world.
@Ocasio2018 Shows how little her husband knows...it’s sad but true that the average American citizen does not understand the tax code. It’s complicated but this belief that Wall Street isn’t taxed is ridiculous.

@malik1955 @LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan I can’t tell if you’re making a joke right now or just being dense...
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan That Farrakhan is an anti-Semite. That the quote from the Bible that you posted is inconsistent with God’s words and teachings. That the Nation of Islam has bastardized Islam in America. That the true word of god is the Torah.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan No. I’m a Jewish person who has been a victim of anti-semitism and the rhetoric that spews out of Farrakhan mouth. “Sent from the devil” is something a religious person would say. Clearly you’re confused, however, maybe God sent me to you so you could learn and be taught truth.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan We are all juggling real life. You’ve tweeted outrageous things...like how you’re not a Christian or Muslim and yet you defend the Bible and cite to it.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Do you think talking vaguely helps prove your point? What you say doesn’t make sense. And where did I talk about you being “African?”
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Why? Are you a fascist Nazi who doesn’t like that people disagree with you andcsnn you out for your lies?
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan The truth is that you and your religion hasn’t followed God’s word since it’s inception. There is only one chosen people- the Jews, who have accepted the word of God. Christianity and Islam have bastardized it and God told us this would happen.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan You’re religious beliefs originate from my religion! God has told us that Jews will suffer and will also be under Gods protection.

@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Mortified by the lies that Jews who study Torah and practice Judaism are “fake Jews,” and Christians and Muslims who follow Jesus and Muhammad and not the Torah claim to be the real Jews? I’d usually block someone like you but you entertain me.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Oh you’re an idiot...I didn’t realize that’s your heritage. Yes part of my family has lived in Russia, Lithuania, Israel, and Germany. But your Russian comment is hands down the saddest indictment on your idiocy. I can’t believe you actually made that buffoonery of a comment.
@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Yes I can prove my JEWISH heritage over 400 years. Can you? Lol. You’re clearly jealous of the Jewish people.

@LoveParis__ @PlayaJay35 @malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Yes you’re quoting the CHRISTIAN bible. Great job...another book that does not teach God’s word. You members of the Nation of Islam really don’t get it do you? I love how jealous you are of me and my people being chosen by God, and we chose him, but you’re getting out of hand.

@danprice @DanielBShapiro It’s not giving Trump a pass, by comment merely reflects the hypocrite like and hyperbolic response of democrats to Trump while they either supported or denied the acts of Obama, which were far worse.

@danprice @DanielBShapiro No they’re not both the same at all. What obama did was far worse. They don’t even compare. Obama provided a known enemy who is responsible for funding terrorism world wide, which has been used to target our ally Israel, $150 bill and overlooked all their human rights crimes.
@danprice @DanielBShapiro Khashoggi isn’t American...
@TheChelseaFlash It causes people to lose their lives doesn’t it? Also Iran is a 3rd party that would love to see others suffer as long as it hurts KSA and Iran’s enemies. They don’t care about the Yemeni lives anymore than KSA does, but they like the chaos.
@Torgrude45 @KarimOfTheKrop @ESPNFC That’s fine In fact I’m glad that you contribute to help Palestinian children. I have no problem with Palestinian children. I have a problem with Hamas and Abbas and the corrupt governments that don’t take care of their people but put them in harms way.
@Ouadie13 @reginaldjordan1 @ESPNFC Yes they didn’t allow many in. It’s a very small country and kicked out illegal immigrants. Not all but a substantial amount.
@Torgrude45 @KarimOfTheKrop @ESPNFC Thank you for admitting that.
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC Tell me about the history of the Palestinians pre 67. What is their nation? Borders? When did they ever govern the land. Can’t believe I gave you so much credit. Instead you’re a moron.
@Torgrude45 @KarimOfTheKrop @ESPNFC Couldn’t tell if you were being sarcastic. Certainly appeared like you were blaming Israel. Context and nuance and sarcasm get lost on twitter.
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC What abu mazzen and sinwar, and haniyeh have done is unacceptable. They steal from the Palestinian people and tell them to sacrifice themselves to kill Jews. Israel could destroy Gaza and West Bank in a night.
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC Were you making your comment about me? Do you think I don’t know where israel is on a map?
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC I’m a conservative who despises Fox News as much as I despise cnn and msnbc. All of which are political tools of the respective parties. The analysis by those networks are superficial and influenced by advertisers. Anyone who gets their info from cable news is not worth my time.
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC Felt like you were attacking me...was I wrong? If so I apologize.
@KarimOfTheKrop @Torgrude45 @ESPNFC And I do agree most Americans are too dumb and don’t care about the issues of other people’s in other nations because they are spoiled and coddled. Then again, you live in Redmond so you’re clearly surrounded with the far left.

@SimaTsuki @SenSanders And his retraction is erroneous to my argument. The point is he made that comment, which was outrageous. Anyone who is serious about the conflict would never have made such an outlandish statement. He can’t speak on foreign policy issues.

@NormEisen No, your outrageous language because you’re a partisan is what is unacceptable. These outrageous comparisons are propaganda to convince stupid people that hating Trump/Republicans is acceptable, it’s not.
@malik1955 @PlayaJay35 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan That’s an interesting perspective. I have never heard a Muslim tell me that interpretation of the Quran.
@NormEisen This is such outrageous rhetoric. The mere comparisons indicate how little you know on orban, Erdogan and putin. Your comments are incendiary and people actually take you seriously and don’t even know what vague point you’re trying to make. Give 1 example.
@KirstenPowers Does agreeing with stupid people also make you stupid?
@malik1955 @PlayaJay35 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Lol Islam wasn’t created until 600 AD. The Quran recognizes Jewish and Christian prophets. The Jewish Torah does not reference any Muslims or Christians because Judaism preceded both by over 3500 and 4000 years ago.

@jonvantan @PeacedeResist86 @gtconway3d @BarackObama Just read up on the history of panics and crashes in america and the world and you will quickly find out that economic cycles typically happen every 10 years with slight deviations of course where the cycle is slightly smaller or longer. My comment is apolitical.

@BobGonnit @NormEisen Poorly written. That 2nd and 3rd paragraph, the entire article is pure opinion, and ignores what is fundamental to Judaism that has been lost in the majority of American Jewry.
@JRubinBlogger @NormEisen You’re probably as much a Jew as you are a conservative these days.
@NormEisen You are the type of person who is bad for the Jews.
@NormEisen Yes they are! There’s a reason why Trump is supported by the majority of Orthodox Jews. It’s the reform “jews” who tend to vote democrat and give Jews a bad name.
@PeacedeResist86 @gtconway3d @BarackObama Interest rates held at historically low near 0 for 8 years, an economy that had been decimated prior, it’s not difficult to understand why growth lasted so long and continues to do so, also economic cycles happen every 10 years or so, 2007 marked the beginning of a new cycle.

@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Islam is only 1400 years old, Judaism is over 5700. Islam adopted Jewish teachings as your own and changed them slightly. You hold our prophets in high regard, we don’t follow the Quran. However the Torah figures prominently in Islam.
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan You keep trying Malik, I love getting into arguments with you members of the Nation of Islam. I pity you because you’ve been so deceived by the honey potion Farrakhan pours in your ears. You find solace in an evil man who smiles and speaks nicely and you ignore the anti-semitism.
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Lol Benjamin Friedman? Please stop. You’ve already embarrassed yourself enough. And taking an individual man’s statement as truth to fit your narrative is a bad look for you. Do you honestly “think” in this manner?
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan It’s not truth. What you wrote is an opinion. If it was truth it would be probable with some sort of testing. Since you don’t know the difference between opinion and facts I’m going to end this conversation. There are many schools here of which to obtain an education.
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Yes, there are some, a very small minority that disagree. Tell me, if there are a small minority of blacks who disagree with your views on Farrakhan does that make them right and you wrong?
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Yes Malik, every comment an individual utters that is not a fact is considered “in the view” of the orator. Saying “in my view” was unnecessary and I’m glad you talented from substance, which demeans your argument and your ability to argue.
@malik1955 @MuhammadsSon @SherrySwain @LouisFarrakhan How about Abraham Lincoln and the white men who passed the 13th amendment? Or Lyndon B Johnson? Or Mary white ovington? Moorefield storey?
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan Farrakhan is nothing more than a smooth talking individual who’s also anti-Semitic. In my view, he’s a little Hitler without the power and far less charisma. He dupes, deceives, lies to, and manipulated his followers into believing in a world that doesn’t exist.
@malik1955 @mar_loves_islam @LouisFarrakhan How do you know that Allah intended him to be as you claim? Farrakhan makes the Nation of Islam and all of its followers look like, even though most probably are, anti-semites. He embarrasses the Nation of Islam in the eyes of the world.
@QalaFurqan Tell me about the rights that are granted to white people but not blacks? Are they able to gain employment? Yes. Can they go to private or public school? Yes. College? Yes. Are they taxed extra because they are black? No. Your ignorance does not allying with reality.
@QalaFurqan When do second class citizens GET ELECTED to PRESIDENT? Or have also been Presidential nominees- Ben Carson, Herman Cain? Or are so wildly celebrated- Tiger woods, Oprah, jay-z,  Michael Jordan, Simone Biles, Lebron James, Denzel Washington, Chris Rock, etc.

@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad Actually it’s the lone wolf attackers from the West Bank that stab innocent Israelis while they’re praying, shopping, etc. and these attackers kill old people and women.
@Lance63 @benabyad No one is innocent I committing crimes. Every country in existence has committed crimes. Wanna talk about what the English did to the Irish and Scottish? Give back the falklands. Or what did GB do to India? Lol
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad When did “Palestinians” ever controll the land known as Israel? Before 47 the British controlled it, and for 400 years before WWI it was controlled by the Ottomans. And before that Muslim conquerors took it from the Christians, who took it from the Romans, who took from the JEWS!
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad Funny how israel has been under direct threat of violence since it’s or inception and we’ve defeated the Muslim invaders every time you attack us. We are still here.
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad And no, israel is the Jewish homeland. Has been for over 3500 years, even if we’ve been expelled numerous times.
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad Hahahahaha you have no idea what you are talking about. The world’s preeminent intelligence agency is the Mossad along with CIA, and MI6 and GRU.
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad No, you know how to kill innocents instead of being diplomatic. Why is it that the fattest Muslims in the world live in Gaza and the West Bank? Or experience the highest quality of living?
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad And let’s not forget all the innocent Israelis killed by your terrorist brethren. By your logic we have a right to defend ourselves, which we do, and will continue to do. We have intelligence and military superiority. You can’t compete.
@SamMuGhal33 @kay41981 @benabyad Hahahaha you will never get israel, always and forever the nation state of Israel, the Jewish homeland. We could destroy you in a day, but we are good people and won’t kill you unless you attack us, and even then we won’t destroy because we’ll only target terrorists.
@kay41981 @benabyad Lol if you really base it on dead and not who is being targeted- Israeli civilians versus Hamas terrorists than yea your point of view would be right, but your determination on the issue is faulty logic.
@kay41981 @benabyad If you think Hamas and Islamic jihad are innocents you should try living in southern Israel.
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad The only way you would not take Israel’s side on this is if you’re an anti-Semite. Pure and simple. So fuck off terrorist loving Nazi.
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad Haha no what’s sad is your anti-semitism and lack of knowledge about the conflicts and acts of the “Palestinians.”
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad You didn’t read what I wrote- tell me if times where the IDF TARGETED civilians. Civilians dying because the terrorists put them in danger is not the same as IDF targeting them. That’s what Hamas does, they target civilians.
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad Tell me a single time where Israel TARGETS CIVILIANS.
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad And I didn’t know terrorists were civilians- amazing how we target launching pads and terrorists and they fire rockets indiscriminately.
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad Even if 1 is killed and the entire southern part of the country is threatens with indiscriminate rocket fire, that’s still terrorism! If I burn your house down but you and your family survive are you saying I’m not a terrorist? 😂
@B_The_Gambler @benabyad Hahahaha you’re calling me an idiot and telling me how israel which acts with restraint even though it could wipe Gaza out in a day is the terrorists.

@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Another immaterial comment because you can’t handle substance? Ok I’ll call you a melon head instead lol but you and I both know you’re a guy. And it’s not bold, and it’s funny you say this since you called me a girl earlier 😂😂
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Haha I’m not surprised you’d say such a stupid comment. You’re not interested in learning you just think you’re right. Guess what kid, you have no clue what you’re talking about.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Oh someone’s angry 😡 😭😭 haha little boy doesn’t know how little he knows and can’t handle being challenged on his bull shit. Take the L chump. No shame it admitting you’re wrong and don’t know what you’re talking about.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN You don’t seem to realize how little you know I’m the subject that you keep tangenting to non subject matter. Just admit that you’re wrong, LEARN this lesson, then learn up on the material you want to argue with me here.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Are you really this stupid? Just drop out of school now if you think you need to work weekends all the time. You’re going to struggle mightily you really should just take the L and give up on this conversation.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Tell me if you would do nothing if I had manipulated people to attack you with knives and drives their cars into you as you went to get the mail.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN What atrocities do they commit? Tell me if you would defend your house if I sent people to shoot at it, send balloons with Molotov’s connected to them into your backyard, send fake guest suicide bombers into your home and murdered your family and friends.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Lol could have fooled you? Hahaha I’m sure lots of things fool you. You’re ignorance on the issues is apparent. I entertain your conversation because every assertion you make I can respond to and prove you wrong, oh and teach you. I’d bill you but this lesson is on the house.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN To even think I haven’t thought and discuss and researched this issue for years is an indictment on your false sense of superiority on the subject matter at issue here.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Lol you’re so arrogant and naive and it’s hilarious. You don’t want the answer because you don’t like it. When you become a lawyer like me perhaps you’ll change your “thinking.” Probably went to a better law school than you too.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN And this is such a naive comment. Tell me how you think every modern day country became as it is today? The history of every country in the world that exists today conquered a prior people. ECERY country, except Israel conquered who? No one. British beat the ottomans.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Hahaha what country existed? What is a Palestinian pre 67?
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN If you’re a law student go take an international law course offered at school. You should know about the UN if you want to be a lawyer and care about the conflict. I don’t get paid to teach bud.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Hahaha “stolen land!!” Tell me about the history of the Palestinian people before 1967. Tell me about it’s leaders, it’s control of the land, it’s seat of government, etc. oh and maybe some written evidence or archaeological evidence that supports such a claim.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Hypnotized how? Are you aware that Israel has more UN condemnations against it than Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, China, Venezuela, Cuba, Saudis Arabia combined? No one can argue that Israel commits more human rights abuses than those nations combined.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN What is Palestine? Did you know Israel provides electricity to Gaza and West Bank? The governments of Gaza and West Bank are terrorists and corrupt and don’t take care of their people?
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Thank you. Ilhan is an idiot and anti-Semitic. Israel is the Jewish state, everyone knows this. Just because it is a pluralistic society that doesn’t mean it’s not Jewish. Europe and South America are Christian states, ME are Muslim states, India, China, Japan are Far East relgns
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Then you’re ignorant about the demonization of jews and the common anti-Semitic trope said about Jews all around the world. Or the treatment of Israel at the UN, and the common anti-semitism embraces there.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN https://t.co/gtZ3pWM1IH	Saying “Israel” has hypnotized the world, a common anti-Semitic trope that Jews control the world, is anti-Semitic.
@JLGLawStudent @IlhanMN Yep. I guess I was hopeful the democrats would reject anti-semitism. I was wrong.

@QalaFurqan Lol tell me about a more peaceful period in world history...
@QalaFurqan You mean the Christian bible written over 300 years after his death? Or maybe 70? I don’t even remember because it’s so irrelevant. Jesus is not important to Judaism. He was simply a Jew.
@QalaFurqan Lol Farrakhan is going to die and the world is going to go on just fine without him. You’re delusional and should seek mental help.
@QalaFurqan Actually he was killed by the Romans and his story was written 300 years later! Oh bless your heart. Jesus was not unique and just another disruptive individual and he was placed in a cross like thousands of others before him and after him. Lol
@QalaFurqan Lol Netanyahu has expanded Israeli influence and importance to the world. We constantly provide aid and resources and always deploy IDF forces to help with rescue efforts worldwide. We even have relations with Muslim nation’s.

@QalaFurqan If Jesus was so smart and powerful how could he not stop his own death? And you read “JOHN chapter 8” whatever that is that’s not from the Torah that’s from the Christian bible.
@QalaFurqan Jesus was a single rabbi. He was not a Jewish leader of the Temple. He also claimed to be the son of god that’s blasphemy.
@QalaFurqan Hahahaha what are you talking about? You’re now a Jew or Jewish. You are a Muslim. You don’t read from the Torah, you were not bar mitzvahed, your mind has been poisoned and demented by LF who is selling you some hilariously outlandish fabrications.
@PFA809 @IAFFNewsDesk Someone doesn’t like to be blamed for not doing their job...your job is to fight fires.
@QalaFurqan No, Elijah Muhammad lied to you and made up Jewish history. You are not Jewish, you are a Muslim. You are not part of God’s chosen people. You descend from people who do not study Torah.
@QalaFurqan No you’re not lol. You’re not Jewish! You’re a Muslim and you’re probably a Muslim because one of your ancestors was conquered by true Muslims. You’re a child of ishmael, I am a son of Abraham, Isaac and Joseph.
@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan That Jews are Satan, that Jews run the world, that the Jews are not the chosen people, etc.
@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan That’s actually not true. There isn’t even a true “Palestinian” people. There is no Palestinian history prior to 67 unless you’re referring to the Roman and British uses of “palestina” and “Palestine” as in the land of the Jewish people.

@QalaFurqan The only book that matters is the Jewish bible and Torah. The word of god. There’s a reason why both Christianity and Islam try to claim the Jewish holy city of Jerusalem, and it’s because you envy the chosen people of god.

@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan Jews were there before Muslims conquered it and we still exist and will exist. The Torah speaks about how your religion will be angry and outnumber us but with god on our side god will continue to protect the Jewish people.
@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan Cultures, such as the Romans, Greeks and Persians all recognize and speak of the Jewish people in Jerusalem. Muslims are a far younger religion only 1400 years old. We acknowledge Muslim conquest of Jerusalem and that still does not gloss over the fact that Jerusalem is Jewish.
@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan Except what Farrakhan preaches is not the truth. There is no documented, archaeological, evidence of Muslim possession of the land. Now did muslims build al-aqsa? Yes. And they did so after they conquered Jerusalem. And there is ample evidence of Jewish ownership of Jerusalem.

@Tc2ewra @LouisFarrakhan Anti-Semite is a term used around the world to describe because who are discriminatory towards Jews. Louis Farrakhan is an anti-Semite and has made up his own definition of Semite and sold it to his congregation, but what he says are lies.
@QalaFurqan And no Muslims have no right to the land that is Israel, the land has never been promised to you, it was promised to us Jews, your ancestors, if you’re not a forced convert, conquered it from us, and after many years god has returned it to us.
@QalaFurqan And God has established the children of Israel in their our homeland. That’s why we’ve returned to our land. God has worked his power through the human beings on this land. We will never give up the land god has determined to be our homeland. Even if expelled we will returnn
@pmschocolate @MZHemingway @PhilipRucker @mlcalderone Yes he attacked these 3 black women, only this morning he attacked a white woman, and on Wednesday he attacked 2 white men. You think he attacked these black women because they’re black and not because they’re reporters who are being disrespectful just like the others?
@MZHemingway @PhilipRucker @mlcalderone Apparently even though he attacks everyone, they like to write the narrative that he’s racist by discussing that he only attacks 3 black women. These people are partisan hacks who deceive their audience.

@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch They say that, but when they were in power they never lmworked to lower higher education costs and student loan debt exploded. It’s the 2nd highest cause for personal debt after credit card debt.
@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch I’m a lawyer, student loan debt is insane. I owe over $160k, even though I received 25% scholarship and went to a tier 2 school
@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch Well higher education has already been politicized. It benefits democrats because the democrats are happy to see students pay exorbitant debts so long as they get the professor block to vote democrat and push liberal ideology. It’s a corruption of the system.

@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch I agree. Unfortunately higher education benefits democrats. Academia is overwhelmingly liberal and the professors salaries are increasing and the ability to fire them is becoming more difficult. And students are paying more.

@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch I agree, I’m a trump supporter and believe we shouldn’t remove protections for pre conditions. They should be covered but they should be required to pay more because they have more problems and require more care.
@UnCleverGirl24 @RepTedDeutch And yes we need both, but first and foremost we need mental health to be the focus. That has been the underlying problem. Normal people don’t kill others. And the shooters have used rifles, handguns and shotguns.

@darryn_briggs @NormEisen Trumps company along with numerous other housing/rental companies were part of a wide net cast investigation and not all trump properties were found to discriminate against blacks, only 1 or a few from what I read.

@darryn_briggs @NormEisen It’s from last week. I’ve seen far too many of my Orthodox Jewish brethren being harassed by blacks, not white supremacists and I never would have the audacity to say all blacks are racist. But it angers me greatly. And yes Jews and blacks have a complex relationship.

@jimsciutto Where is the story on Russian collusion?
@daveweigel Minnesota certainly didn’t elect its 1st anti-Semitic AG though did it...lol. Followed of Farrakhan are awful people and should not be tolerated.
@fordm I’m sure he was won of hundreds of thousands that operated that there was no there there.
@Yamiche Just because some see it as so doesn’t make it true...obama and the black democrat caucus emboldened anti-Semitic behavior by imtheir relations with Farrakhan, I doubt you’d say obama was an anti-Semite...
@daveweigel It was less than half of what obama lost in 2010 and the republicans increased their senate majority, did obama also do that in 2010? NOPE
@redsteeze And the Russian collusion narrative, and the family separation, and the Helsinki conference, and meeting with KJU, and stormy Daniels, etc.
@JeffMerkley It’s not absolute. You don’t get to act like an ass because you’re a member of the press.
RT @davidharsanyi: 105 Articles Cover Ilhan Omar's Win. Zero Cover Her Anti Semitism, Finance Investigations, or Perjury Evidence. https://…
@joelockhart @FoxNews But the Russia collusion story...and stormy Daniels...lol
@rafaelshimunov @PressSec I’m sure this guy isn’t a democrat...lol
@NormEisen @Acosta Hahaha of course that’s your narrative to protect a resistance journalist all because he doesn’t agree with the politics. Such scum.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta You don’t like the truth? You’re not a lawyer I don’t understand why you’re offended.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Actually it does, but you’re a layman who’s acting as if you understand the profession and the law. I’m not going to argue with you and you don’t seem to respect my authority on the subject, probably because you don’t like what I say. Take it easy.
@NormEisen No it’s not lol. It was only 6 months ago you guys were hoping for 70 flips. Why do you lie?
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta I’m not a criminal defense lawyer or prosecutor however, I clerked for a criminal division district court judge. It’s ok to concede that I know more. It’s not a competition. You weren’t trained to learn this stuff. We are required to learn the civil torts for battery and criminal
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Probably because you aren’t trained as a lawyer.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta I’m an attorney...
@craigaroo @wheresmydogma @mmachado__ @AshaRangappa_ Haha Jesus you’re dramatic and detached from reality.
@mmachado__ @AshaRangappa_ You’re a 1L son, don’t worry, by the end of the year after you take con law you’ll realize you shouldn’t be worried. I recommend also taking civics online to learn about separation of powers.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta You don’t need contact to have an “assault,” contact is required for a battery...it’s 1 of 3 elements required for a battery to be present. Acosta committed a battery against the girl, highly unlikely that he’d be found to have assaulted her, which would req her to be in fear.
@cjwerleman Sounds like the Muslims have really pissed off the Hindu mob, of course I’m sure you ignore the menacing acts of Muslims towards non Muslims around the world. It amazes me how many current conflicts involve Muslims around the world- I think it’s at least 23...
@melissakchan @mkraju @Acosta Hahahahaha the fact that you even make this comparison is bad for your credibility.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Not true at all. My opinion is a mere observation. Though you are correct that if I was to litigate this case as a prosecutor against Acosta I would have the burden. And the burden would be easy to meet. It’s pretty cut and dry from the video that he made contact w/her person.
@kwelkernbc @Acosta @whca The people don’t. He’s a fool and he’s taking you all down with him
@mkraju So sad. Hope she’s all right. At some point she’ll realize it’s better to retire
@LouisFarrakhan You’re a dog. The lowest of the low. An anti-Semite, just a fat pile of cow dung.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Look we disagree, you’re entitled to your opinion, which I think is incorrect and I’m entitled to mine, which you think is incorrect. I’d love to argue this in court against you and see who wins but we don’t so take it easy.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta His arm was already in motion to come down and form a defensive posture prior to her reaching for the mic? Hmmmm yea well you’re entitled to your opinion. I see it differently.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Haha ok I’ll agree.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Cory Booker and Kamala Harris are the  Marco Rubio and ted Cruz of the democrats.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin I agree. The old people are out of touch and the young people are still too green and want the presidency too fast
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Haha
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin To me it was all a charade by the democrats. It’s consistent with Schumer saying they wouldn’t confirm him 5 seconds after he was nominated. He’s pretty awful at politics because he tries to fire up the base and didn’t realize how weak dem senate position is/was.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Eh, I typically am, I’m a former dem that doesn’t have patience for today’s democrats, hard not to be an ass hole behind an anonymous username. Anyways politics is bad because of tech and social media and stupid people lol
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin You really can’t investigate a 35 year old claim of sexual battery...what evidence do you think can be collected? We already heard the accusers statement. And she provided no corroborating info. The state today wouldn’t prosecute such a weak case.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Yes we can agree there. Both sides talk from both sides of their mouth. We pretty much suck when it comes to politics. Especially outsiders like you and me and the 300+ million Americans who lack influence outside of 1 vote and a social media account lol
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Also in America we don’t demand the innocent to prove their innocence, we demand the government to prove the alleged s guilt.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Lol Biden addressed the fbi investigations in the 80s too with Clarence Thomas, the fbi doesn’t provide conclusions, not to mention the alleged kav incident happened over 35 years ago.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Before garland was Bork, and the woman that George w Bush nominated. The truth seems to be that you know only contemporary SC history. I could talk about SC history for a while as far back as frankfurter and the Fed scorpion court.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin How about this, does the republicans not confirming garland mean the democrats are free to act as outrageously as they have? All the kavanugh stuff was made up smears. This guy has a sterling reputation until the democrat charade
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Factual
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Well it would be nice to see the democrats stand up against illegal immigration like they did up until Trumps election but you know...things change
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Of course not, the republicans acted on the democrat threat made by Biden in the 90s.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Their votes were only 9 and less years ago...the only thing that has changed is a true lack of respect by democrats for the office, they have completely ignored the traditional norms and customs of their roles. I expected opposition but not this hatred.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Gorsuch was confirmed 54-45, kagan 63-37, sotomayor- 68-31
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Also look at cabinet appointees. When obama came in he had far more already confirmed with help of republicans, trump was not treated with the same respect.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin We need people who are willing to cross the line more often, there are far too many that vote with their party over 93% of the time. For instance many republicans supported kagan, rgb, sotomayor...kav and gorsuch didn’t get similar treatment.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Notice also how she never physically touched him, she went for the mic. He made contact with her by the volitional move of his arm which made contact with her.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Wrong. She’s not the aggressor. Her job is to facilitate the transportation of the mic, Trump dictates who can and can’t ask him questions, he told Acosta to sit down, Acosta didn’t listen she was instructed to grab the mic and bring it to the next person asking a q.
@SeanPalermo @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Key word being “almost” most members of a party vote with their own party over 88% of the time.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @Sen_JoeManchin Honestly need more congressmen like manchin, he’s essentially the democrat version of McCain, which the democrats hate lol
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Heavily evidence dependent*
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta It could be depending on the location and situation. The law does not provide for specific instance, they are heavily dependent. It’s the same thing if a bouncer at a bar outs his hands on an unruly patron, the bouncer wouldn’t be charged with a battery.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta He even pulls the mic away from her...that shows intent that he was trying to prevent her from grabbing it.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta Yes it did. Watch it. You don’t see his arm coming down, interfering with her arm, and his open hand landing on her arm?
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta You’re right. Part of his open hand landed on her arm. He moved his arm in a volitional movement downward and to block her from grabbing the mic, which was her job. What he did would constitute battery, especially as an invitee, as her conduct was expected.
@TheWrongQuest @PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta You don’t have to make a “move” towards someone. He intentionally grabbed her arm, even for a second, and made physical contact with her.
@PhilipinDC @jaketapper @Acosta https://t.co/p4DaSdWjAL	It’s ok that you missed this but now you can admit it. What happened at the 7 second mark? Thanks. I know you’ll do the right thing.
@AC360 @VanJones68 What in the actual fuck is he talking about?!  The president was ELECTED by the people! He can’t start a coup...holy fuck- people on cable news and those who watch it must be either our nation’s dumbest or our nation’s most invidious and deceitful individuals.
@AC360 @carlbernstein Lol what? The president has the expressed power to appoint and fire his cabinet...come on, get this clown off the air. The people elected trump. You guys are still not getting it- stop the lies.
@JoeNBC But Russia! 😂 take a seat joe
@jeffmason1 @Acosta @Reuters Really you want to see the video of him reaching out and putting his hands on her? Love how you used screenshots lol
@peterbakernyt Obama lost 63 seats, Trump 28, you don’t see the difference? Lol
@PCordellaEsq @MSNBC Ok counselor let’s play ball, on what ground can Acosta and the press pool bring a claim under? You trying to replace avenatti on the networks? Lol
@Zachary_Scotty @MSNBC Hahahahahaha I’d say this is the dumbest tweet I’ll read from this post but I’m sure I’ll see less intelligent comments tonight. Thanks for the laugh!
@williamlegate @PressSec That’s not battery you goon! No one would find her conduct offensive. It was wholly appropriate. Stop pretending to be an attorney lol
@williamlegate @PressSec 2 years of the trump administration and the press is still provided access and reporting every minute. Please return to reality.
@williamlegate @PressSec Lol we all saw it. He’s a clown and you’re a sheep for falling for his crap.
@Acosta We all saw the video, stop lying Jim, you look like an ass.
@peterbakernyt What “coverage?” Acosta doesn’t cover anything, he’s trying to become the news not report on it. When you stand with him you only hurt true journalism.
@KamalaHarris Where is your evidence of voter suppression?
@Acosta Hahahahaha loser
@jonfavs @brhodes Wait! But that Russian collusion! It’s so...farcical.
@brhodes Yea let’s talk about that Russian collusion, oh wait the media stopped talking about that how many months ago?
RT @robbystarbuck: A Leftist Antifa mob is currently outside of @TuckerCarlson’s home shouting "racist scumbag leave town" and "we know whe…
@MaxBoot No conservatives take you seriously...you’re just a grifter.
@EricHolder What law was broken? You gonna remain the only AG to ever take the 5th.
@ChrisCuomo The republicans gained in the senate and there was no blue wave so how do you figure? Oh wait you’re a partisan nevermind.
@ABC Ilhan Omar: “kill the Jews.” I’ll never be part of that democrat party.
@JeffFlake Dumbest move he made. If he refuses himself he should have been investigated. If he believed he had improper contacts he still needs to be investigated. That being said he did a great job on all things not related to Russia.
@cardhodess @NormEisen @Acosta He wasn’t asking questions, he was acting like a goon trying to increase his celebrity. The guy isn’t intelligent enough to ask serious questions, he even thinks immigration policy is supposed to mirror a poem at the feet of the Statue of Liberty...
@NormEisen @Acosta He continues to embarrass himself and the media. The media is not supposed to resist anyone but instead report the news. They continuously ruin journalistic integrity and soil the work of quality journalists in America. Cnn and Jim Acosta give journalism a bad name.
@benshapiro Certainly it’s not racism...
@epidural @chrislhayes Awww your butt hurt lol
@epidural @chrislhayes No I don’t watch cable tv news, they’re all partisan hacks lol. But keep watching cnn or msnbc. I’ll be busy reading Bloomberg, financial times, der Speigel, wsj, and numerous other publications over your head.
@KenDilanianNBC So strange to see democrats not care about the opinions of the minority...you guys have really jumped the shark
@epidural @chrislhayes I bet you also think Farrakhan is a trump supporter 😂
@epidural @chrislhayes Thinking what? The truth? Read up on the guy and not from cable tv news. The guy hates trump because he was too good to Israel
@MillenPolitics Lol another stupid opinion, trumps president, republicans gained in the senate...
@SenJeffMerkley What blue wave? Lol
@chrislhayes The Nazi HATED Trump! He was a left wing Nazi, no one should forget that.
@NormEisen Not really since both California senate candidates were democrat...and California is the most populous stay by far.
RT @ReaganBattalion: Video from 3 days ago in New York City, Orthodox Jewish teen attacked for walking on the street while Jewish. 		There…
@PodSaveAmerica Yea I voted in favor of the passage of this amendment after contemplating my thoughts on the subject.
@NormEisen Norm definitely hits the blunt and pops a xan on election days.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol you know nothing about the Israeli-USA relationship, except for the fact that the USA provides Israel with the most foreign aid, to BUY American goods, which Israel upgrades and provides to the USA back for free
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Hahahaha you’re so misinformed. Anything you donated to LF, be it time or money, you should sue him to have returned.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Just because you didn’t ask for doesn’t mean it’s not true. Look, I get it, you don’t live in reality. It’s fine but you’re wrong. That’s all
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Hahahaha now you’re telling me to steal land, from which I do not derive, so you can steal my land, from which you don’t arrive. Tell me- does LF tell you to also rape and murder? Hahaha
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol Jews preceded Muslims in the Middle East and you claim we are from the Eurasian steppes oh you are a sad dim witted little man.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol what?
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Fooling myself how? That there is archaeological evidence, architectural evidence, written evidence to support Jewish claim to the land and yet you can’t provide that for your own fake narrative? 🤔🤨😏🤓
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol what land was stolen from black men?? Are you talking about European and Muslim colonization of Africa? Yes, the Muslims should return the entire Sahal region to non Arab blacks I totally agree.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Is that your mom? 😂😂😂😂
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan You can’t “give back” land that belongs to you. Seriously you’re a fool. Stop embarrassing yourself. And these pictures😂😂 how old are you?
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol you’re a follower of Farrakhan and don’t even know the history of Muslims...you’re the only one indoctrinated. Silly pictures don’t win you arguments, only facts do.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan I’ll never be ashamed of my people protecti themselves from invaders who wish to kill innocent Jews. Once those people stop indoctrinating and sacrificing their children to kill Jews they could have enjoyable lives, with good jobs and dignity. Stop supporting terrorists.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Clearly you don’t know what apartheid means lol
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol you look funnier than you sound. Stay off the meth.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan The “caucus” mountains, please stop you’re embarrassing yourself, LF and the Nation of Islam. Jews come from the land of Israel, Muslims can’t trace their heritage to a single location because you’re conquerors.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Haha now I’m a bot? Oh god you’re holepless and you’re right, you’re not in my level. You’ve proven this through your lack of knowledge about your own religion and the history of Israel. Keep defending LF, you’re not the first follower of LF to have his mind melted by me.
@jpodhoretz Over 70
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan I’m clearly more educated than you and more knowledgeable about your own history but I bet LF told you to type what you wrote. Stop being deceived by the loser Farrakhan. Your following a dark oath of which there is no escape.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Do you consider Jews to be white? My people have been attacked by white supremacists and Europeans as much as we’ve been attacked by Muslims. It’s ok, everyone who’s not a follower of LF knows that LF and his sheeple are racists. Consistent with your history.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Look, I get it, you’re not an intellect. You’re a manipulated and broken man who sought out LF, I respect that you sought out help, but you’ve been lured by an anti-Semite, an evil man, who degraded all non Muslims. He’s a liar and your the sap who believes him.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan If you’re basing it on skin color you’re a racist and don’t know the history of the Jewish people who have been expelled from our land numerous times and always manage to return you’re not Semitic, you’re Muslim. You don’t come from Israel.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan As for your claims of apartheid, the majority of Israel is JEWISH! Apartheid is when the minority rules the majority, which is what would happen if Muslims took over and occupied land that didn’t belong to them. You are so misguided because Lf prays on weak minded fools like you.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Where’s your evidence? Even al-aqsa mosque was built where our Jewish temple stood and they didn’t even destroy all of our immaculate temple walls. You have no claim. The Muslims are conquerors and occupiers in that land, they aren’t native sons or daughters of Israel.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Haha you are so deceived! Jews built Jerusalem! The land has only thrived when we were in our homeland. There is an abundance of architectural and archaeological evidence to support Jewish claim to the land. We’ve been recognized by numerous ancient nations as living there.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan You don’t even know Muslim history! Saladin was the last great Muslim leader to unite the Muslims! He conquered Jerusalem from the Christian crusaders and welcomed the Jewish people back into our capital and homeland. And Jews and Muslims lived as friends.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Haha I pity you for how manipulated and deceived you’ve been. I assume you came to Farrakhan a broken man, and now you’ve been misled to which there is no way of coming back. All you need to do is turn away from Farrakhan and become a man of god.
@ParkerMolloy @jaketapper Because he stands with and has been praised with leaders of the women’s march. You disgusting POS. Stop supporting anti-semites!
@ParkerMolloy @jaketapper He is lefty politics! Are you fucking joking? He only stands with members of the democrat black caucus and obama and Maxine Waters. Stupid people like yourself are going to destroy this country and encourage anti-semitism because you lack moral clarity.
RT @jaketapper: Louis Farrakhan Leads ‘Death to America’ Slogan in Iran (+Video) - Tasnim News Agency https://t.co/NXuoJURWvl
@MSNBC Lol, what are people voting for if they’re voting democrat? The only message I’ve heard for 2 years is to resist trump haha
@ChrisCuomo The funny thing is how they don’t deny who they support where as you and your coworkers are obvious democrats and claim you’re not partisan. I doubt you’d respond to me but it’s still fun to call you out.
@LouisFarrakhan Tell that to Barack Obama, a BLACK man who became the most powerful man in the world...you disgusting dog.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan The land of Israel is the Jewish homeland and whether we are expelled or not does not change the fact that god promised that land to the Jews as part of his covenant with us and ours with him. We  are grateful for his laws and his protection.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Lol honestly this tweet sums up Islamic existence. You haven’t had a good leader since Saladin. Your religion has massacred all non Muslim religions all over the world, Jews, Christians, yazidis, Baha’i, Buddhists, you even have the Sunni/Shi’a divide.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @david04mu @LouisFarrakhan You’re not a lion, lol. You’re a human being, and a Muslim. It’s ok that you’re not chosen. You’re not a true follower of his teachings.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan I’m not assuming anything, Farrakhan is a Muslim, if you’re calling him your leader you’re Muslim too. Additionally the name “Malcom” holds significance for “Malcom x” you don’t need to hide it, it’s obvious to most you’re Muslim.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan You’re not ancient! You’re actually the youngest of the monotheistic religions. Islam began in 617 AD roughly, Judaism is over 5700 years old.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Oh no please keep telling me this make believe you’ve been taught. I like learning about the lies spread by Farrakhan, and how easily manipulated you and his followers are.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Yes I do do as god commands, not everything, but that’s why I atone on Yom Kippur, as god commands. I am not perfect and commit sin and god forgives me for god is just and fair.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Yes the Jewish people have been expelled from our land numerous times. By the Romans, the Christians, the Muslims, the Persians, the Ottomans, etc. you’re literally discussing the story of the Jews.
@johniadarola @JoyAnnReid @ezraklein There is no such thing as a “popular vote” in the house or senate. Please stop spreading this message! This is insane. This is beyond just stupidity, this is so outlandish, so beyond intelligent thought, so beyond reality, my head exploded, it hurts reading this nonsense.
@JoyAnnReid @ezraklein This is quite literally the scariest thing ever! Anyone who believe that there is a “popular vote” for house and senate should be forced to attend a US civics class. Nothing terrifies me more than the thought that there are Americans who believe this is a thing. Please stop.
@JoyAnnReid @ezraklein There is no “popular vote” for house and senate. Holy fuck. Is this a serious comment?!?! This comment is literally the dumbest fuckig tweet ever!
@ZekeJMiller @maddow Probably because they are not stumping in their capacity as Fox News hosts but rather as private individuals...
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Yes it does matter! God chose the land of Israel for his people, the Jewish people who promised the lord they would follow his word and observe his commandments and pray as he instructed. You don’t do as go commanded. You don’t get to ignore god’s word.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan You really don’t get it, you’re a Muslim! No one claims the Muslims to be the people of God, your religion adopted and mutilated Jewish practices. You’re a member of an off shoot religion, which does not follow the word of god but instead the word of a man...
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Cool. I don’t watch Fox News so what’s the point? Sean hannity is a talk show host he’s not news, the same way Cooper, Maddow, lemon, cuomo, etc are not news.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Any gains after November 8, 2016 are attributed to Trump. And the market grew over 2000 points between Election Day and Inauguration Day, since then the market has gained an additional 5000 points.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Oh and even in 2018 the market grew! Not as good as 2017 but still showed growth. October was rough, as is usual historically.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood You trust cnn right? 😉
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood https://t.co/qqFYCU6KGj	Funny how you ignored 2017, Trumps 1st year, which just happened to grow 25%. And that’s because the investors and corps trusted Trunps economic policies and so investors were more willing to invest...
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood If you want to talk about the tv topics I’m not going to discuss with you, tv “news” is for fools.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Ok, so you’re talking about something that is bright and shiny and irrelevant and stressing its importance...instead of focusing on the real substantive issues that have helped everyday Americans grow their personal wealth and secure their employment...
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Wanna talk about dumping? Or acts at the WTO? How about the increase of production in American steel and aluminum that is providing for small rural communities?
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN So farmers are getting hurt, in which trump has provided handouts to them to offset losses, a Democrat principal, and the majority of the economy is benefiting...nice. Thanks for arguing only a very small segment of the argument...
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood The 2nd graph  even depicts much sharper growth under Trumps 1st year than any year under Obama...
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Anecdotal evidence does not depict the whole picture...come on please be serious.
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Perhaps you’re not realizing leverage and that the Chinese economy is suffering whereas the USA has the world’s strongest economy...
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Are you claiming the stock market is an indicator of the economy? Most gains in the market have been buoyed by big tech, 6 companies! Please stop.
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN He’s been president for less than 2 years and 2018 is GUARANTEED to exceed 3% or have you not been paying attention?
@CuomoPrimeTime @TomPerez Which is why I’m 2016 they voted in Trump. A referendum on Obama’s failed presidency, it like he doesn’t realize how stupid he sounds.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood And do you not realize that more jobs were available during Obama’s last 21 month than there were Trumps first 21? Lol come on just stop.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan You don’t pray in Jerusalem, the holiest of holy places. You don’t observe the Saturday sabbath, you don’t follow the Jewish rituals. You are a Muslim, you are not chosen by god. You never made covenant with god.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Hahahahaha you think the Muslims are the descendants of the Jewish patriarchs? Oh wow Farrakhan has really poured a honey potion down your ear. You don’t even adhere to what the lord commands, you strayed as your ancestors strayed. You aren’t Jewish, you were not chosen.
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Do you want to talk about the real indicators of economic strength? Like gross domestic product, consumer confidence, small business confidence, wage growth? Obama is the ONLY president in American history to serve 8 years and never achieve over 3% growth for a given year.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood So you’re saying it’s completely irrelevant- thanks for wasting my time.
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Exactly, what’s the point about talking about manafort a conviction? What’s its relevancy lol
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Lol because you always go off the deepe end when you try to engage with me. But please let’s talk about manafort first. What was he charged with and what’s the nexus between him, Russia and collusion. It’s hard to take you seriously since you “ran for president” lol
@MSNBC @JoyAnnReid Those donuts are really going to lay the energy bill...😂
@Limbaugh2016 @JohnJHarwood Do you want to talk details or not? What was Paul Manafort charged with? Tell me what the nexus is between Russia and Trump collusion? I know you don’t like facts but try not to make it too easy for me.
@Limbaugh2016 @ryanstruyk @CNN Lol are you being serious or just trolling?
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan If you’re a Muslim you praise the Jewish prophets, You derive your religion from the Jewish religion, not vice versa. Brush up on history amigo.
@MalcolmGarvey65 @LouisFarrakhan Hahahahahaha you are as numerous as the sand on the beach and the stars in the sky, but god never chose the children of Esau to be his chosen people, it was the children of Jacob who he made this covenant with, who he blessed as holy.
@ryanstruyk @CNN And Obama had tied for 2nd worst before Trump 😂😂 and yet you bow down to your god king.
@JohnJHarwood “Indicted” means nothing. Indicted is the equivalent to innocent until proven guilty. Sadly 99.9% of Americans don’t go to law school and are manipulated by an manipulative left wing media.

@peterbakernyt This is superficial analysis...there were more unemployed during Obama’s last 21 months than Trumps first 21 months. The fact that the numbers are so close indicates that more job openings exist, which means there’s been more job creation.

@SenatorCollins Great job! You made the right decision. Uncorroborated allegations should never be allowed to destroy any single person.
@SenJeffMerkley There weren’t any “corroborating” witnesses. Clearly you don’t even know what that word means.
@ChrisCuomo Yes lol. How did you graduate from law school and not know that an accuser has to prove her allegations, then again you’re treating Kavanaugh like a criminal so your lack of legal knowledge is apparent.

@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Try and stay on subject honey, we are talking about rural communities, which are predominantly the majority of America and urban, which are your major metropolises. Don’t tangent to the definition of “cities” because it’s irrelevant.
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Wow it’s so sad how little you know about where our agricultural goods come from. Some blue states provide these goods, but the overwhelming majority of wheat, steer, chicken, soybeans, and other produce comes from the red Midwest states. Don’t bring your knife to a gun fight 😂
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Lol none of that comes from cities! Are you serious?? Do you know what farming is? Bless your heart.
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Hahahahaha those red states provide you with manufacturing for your goods, farm the food you eat, don’t even get me started. There are more services provided in inner cities than anywhere else! I highlighted your profession because of the idiocy of your comment regarding “proof.”
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Doesn’t make what I said anything less true. But you can think so as a way to distract yourself from the reality that you are supporting some pretty terrible people. You have to live with the consequences of your decisions. Maybe you just like handouts and don’t like working hard
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju Well I now understand why you’re an “actress” with a comment like that. You can’t “prove” how someone thinks, you can only be told by the thinker that that’s what they think, and even that isn’t proof. Just because you don’t like what someone says doesn’t make that person wrong.
@BlancaCamachoNY @mkraju They don’t say the Nazis, since I know that’s what you’ve heard from liberal news. Some have tho. The majority think the democrats are far worse, especially as they’ve pushed an anti-Israel agenda since 08.

@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog I can’t say that everyone terrorist organization funded by foreign governments are for self defense, in fact I’d say quite the opposite, and the USA, Russia, China, GB, France, etc. all fund terrorism against repressive regimes. But Iran sponsors the largest followed by KSA.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Iran needs to return to a secular Iran, one that doesn’t wish to attack people that aren’t Shi’a Muslims. Brilliant people, terrible Islamist government trending in the direct of Saudi Arabia. And stop funding terrorism and stop funding Hamas and hezbollah.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Iran is not truly democratic. Khameni hand picks who is going to be the president aka lap dog.

@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Iran on the other hand is repressing the amazing Persian people. Everyday secular women are being verbally assaulted and worse, they are investing to destroy Israel. They support terrorism all over which has killed and harmed millions of Muslims.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Yes I’m aware that Saudi Arabia and the Sunnis are equally bad, or rather their history is. And yes all 9/11 was committed by KSA, but KSA is evolving with BS he’s younger and is allowing SA to become more secular. The Sunni/Shi’a divide is responsible for thousands deaths/year.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog The USA has dropped over 18,000 rockets in Syria to beat back ISIS. I’d hardly attribute Assad’s forces to beating back ISIS. They may skirmish and ISIS is obviously terrible and archaically barbaric but Assad needs to go.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog From my understanding Iran sponsors the Houthi rebels who led a coup and overthrew the prior government. That has led to the murder of 300,000 and the suffering of millions more. I also hold Iran accountable for propping up the Houthis.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog No we don’t just sit by idly as 500,000 civilians are murdered and 7 million forced to flee. Assad should have been stopped and removed far earlier. He massacred his people. Hold elections. Now everyone Assad killed hates him anyways. There’s no chance of peace in Syria w/Assad.
@Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Yes Israel obviously forced Assad and the Syrian military to fire missiles from helicopters, drop chemical weapons, and deploy soldiers all across the country to kill 500,000+ civilians 🤔 oh and obama released $150 billions in assets of the pre 79 Iranian government.
@hajix @Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog And what does Assad do- kill innocent people in the name of power? 500,000 dead and over 7 million fled. That’s not ISIS.

@Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog The backed rebels who opposed Assad because of his tyrannical rule. Assad is a murderer and has decimated the country and some people need to defend and stop him. You cannot seriously support Assad. Nor claim that all those murdered and forced to flee are sponsored by Israel.
@Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog Israel hasn’t expanded its borders since 68 and even returned the Sinai to Egypt in exchange for PEACE. Iran is the aggressor not israel. Iran even funds Hamas to fire rockets into Israel. When was the last time an Israeli rocket landed in Iran?
@Amirm_Abbasi @eu_eeas @FedericaMog “Defend?” You mean to tell me Assad requires defenses from the over 500,000 civilians he’s killed? Or the 7 million+ he’s forced to flee from their homes to other Arab nations as well as Europe?
@eu_eeas @FedericaMog This makes a lot of sense, the EU is collapsing and needs as much help with non EU nations, so it overlooks the aggression of Iran in the region and thousands of human rights abuses, in exchange for trade dollars. The human capital is insignificant to the EU.

@Sunshine11334 @BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan Are you next going to tell me that slavery was created by white people? Or that colonization is only a phenomenon exclusive to the white race?
@Sunshine11334 @BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan If you think this is all about colonization you ignore the history of the African continent, the lack of resources, the lack of water, its geological position on our planet, the sparseness of population, corruption, and a myriad of other factors.
@Sunshine11334 @BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan No I didn’t. Holy shit what is wrong with you’re thinking? I swear you must be a racist. I made a very simple observation that the African continent has suffered for thousands of years and the USA is the worlds lone super power.
@Sunshine11334 @BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan Where did I even address race in my posts? There’s something wrong with your brain sunshine.
@Sunshine11334 @BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan This has nothing to do with race, just look at the history of the African continent and the history of the USA.

@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Can you explain to me why you pray to Jesus but don’t walk in his footsteps? Honest question. You do admit and accept he was Jewish right?
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan What does that even mean? Christianity has been at war since it’s inception. Warred with Islam between 600-1200 AD, has splintered and warred within itself between 1400-1800s, and warred again with Islam and the Far East for the last 300 years.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Ok well can you explain why you pray to a man who was a JEWISH rabbi? Shouldn’t you be walking in the footsteps of Jesus and be Jewish instead?
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan You’re not really making any points. Most of your tweets have been vague and broad. I’m being polite engaging with you.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Oh you’re Christian, no I don’t follow the false prophet Jesus.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan What do you mean “real” victor? It seems obtuse to think that God Really “cares” about humans anymore than god cares about animals or any other living beings in the universe.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan And what about when a nation is at war and achieves victory? Is that nation in disfavor?
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan I’m confused, are you talking about violent war or “war” which has many battlefields?
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Well my initial post was war takes different forms. If you were talking about violent war then that was only one part of my tweet. War is not just conducted through violence and murder.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan We can talk about civil strife in which case every nation has some form of war going on.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Countries not at war: Canada (though in a trade war), Scandinavian nation’s (though experiencing conflicts with new migrants- Sweden), Australia not at war, Mongolia sure not at war, but also poor so perhaps a war with quality of life, etc.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Ok- I’d say the entire African continent, the entire Middle East and numerous countries in Asia are experiencing wars at the moment. India is at war within its society, America is obviously in wars.
@andylassner #triggered 😂
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan No not currently. But every nation of people that is alive today or in existence has gone through wars. Which was my point.
@Aboriginalman1 @hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan You’ve relinquished all ability to speak on the subject of war after that comment. Please never respond to me ever again because your (lack of) intelligence is simply incompatible with serious conversation.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan It has been a while since the great Khans conquered Asia and parts of Western Europe.
@RealSaavedra No it won’t. She just opposes everything Trump. CNN should just have a cut out of her looking angry and save themselves the money of paying her. Everyone knows what’s she’s going to say.
@truth_vs_lies07 @LouisFarrakhan He was killed by members of the Nation of Islam.
@BambeniZikode @LouisFarrakhan Sounds like a weird comment when people who live in the USA have been benefitting immensely and living better lives for arguably the last 80 years and the entire continent of Africa is mired in civil wars, corruption, famines, and lack of resources.
@hanjangho76 @LouisFarrakhan Can you name me a few nations that aren’t at war? Be they actual wars of murder and violence, economic, or civil strife from within.
@LouisFarrakhan Does God continue to punish black Americans for their sins? I’m wondering when you think God punishes people and when you do not...people that follow you are unfortunately punished by God with weak minds.

@DanielBShapiro @SenBillNelson @NelsonForSenate Rick Scott, he has a much better record as governor than Bill Nelson as a senator. Bill Nelson is also incoherent and his policies do not benefit Florida.
@jonfavs Anyone can create a poll...but let’s talk about the university of Michigan study that estimated 5000 deaths that was cited by many democrats and members of the left wing media only 6 months ago.
@WalshFreedom Am I pleased? No. But your characterization that he “starts a fight” is wrong. And you know that.
@FreestyleWild @NormEisen Reality exists in each individual’s mind. We all live in our own realities.
@GirlNYC @NormEisen You sound like someone who doesn’t believe in democracy
@QwasziHermann @NormEisen Has there been a better President for the State of Israel? Shana tova to you too
@NormEisen The Talmud also says that when you take a life it’s like killing the entire world...
@Heminator It won’t be because she’s a democrat/left and the left wing media protects democrats.
@TheAtlantic @TaylorLorenz These are the country’s real snowflakes. Doing things that make us uncomfortable builds character
@HowardSumka @Ibishblog @jstreetdotorg @jstreetu Do you speak up when the PA funds individuals to ram their cars into Israeli citizens? Or when Iran breaks international law funding Hamas and their rockets into Israeli civilian positions? If you don’t your opinion is a nullity.
@AG_Conservative The only reason why the GOP seems to have a legitimate shot of reaching 60 senators is because of Trumps leadership. I hate his rhetoric but the results are his doing.

@SenFeinstein As are taxes and the ACA
@cjwerleman I remember how Muslims built their mosques on top of the most holy Jewish land where the Beit Hamigdash stood. Do you?
@SenSanders ESTIMATES! The last estimate you cited was the university of Michigan study that ESTIMATED 5000 deaths! Since you’re moving on to a lower number should we wait till you cite the next study that ESTIMATES 1000 deaths?
@DanRather With this sort of (low) intelligence it begs to ask how you don’t have a show to host.
@jimsciutto OMG! We don’t have unanimity in the Republican Party, Trump must be a disaster...what’s the point of your tweet Jim?
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman And yet you force women to wear the veil, perform “honor killings” against women, force women to be married off at young ages, allow for the rape of women, female genital mutilation, deny equal rights to women and minorities, etc. you’re in denial about your faith.
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman Actually the USA is very considered with how Muslims are being treated terribly in China. And it’s obvious that Islamic count rests treat non Muslims very terribly and oppress such people.
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman Are you trying to argue semantics? Maybe what Islam considers “oppression” is oppression and you simply don’t recognize it as oppression.
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman Not hating, speaking the truth. I’ve watched countless videos that secular Muslims have shown me that contradict your assertions.
@cjwerleman Why don’t you also blame those who have attacked the USA? And those who have attacked innocents?
@ChrisCuomo What specific bad decisions are you referring to?
@HillaryClinton What about those we lost 6 years ago? #Benghazi
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman I’ve done my research and spoken to many Muslims who uphold the faith and told me of the plight of women and mistreatment of minorities. They do not share your opinions.
@asadalikhan2000 @whyrakib @cjwerleman You say “rapists SHOULD be executed” but they’re not. Instead the woman is punished and the man is not. And you say “women are allowed to leave” perhaps you don’t understand the great inequality and sexism of this comment and practice. The patriarchy is deveststing to women.
@whyrakib @cjwerleman So stoning women who are raped while their rapists get off free is “good?” How about killing sisters for leaving the family home? How about denying rights to gays and minorities? How about treating foreign workers like slaves as they do in Qatar? It’s great if you’re a Muslim man
@brianklaas And no one would consider the time up to and prior to the tax reform as a period of strong growth! No serious economist would ever say that 2.1% growth is STRONG.

@AdamB_ @brianklaas These people remind me very much of Antifa. Then again Antifa and white supremacist seem quite similar in their approach to different opinion.
@AdamB_ @brianklaas If you’re comparing what they said to each other, which again isn’t remotely similar, you’re playing a lot of mental gymnastics. There is no inference that can be drawn connecting the two. In my opinion, they sound more like the left- “we are the people.”
@AdamB_ @brianklaas How can you be so sure that your perspective is correct and mine is wrong? Seems like you’re doing a lot of interpretation and yet he mentioned Donald Trump, unnecessarily. There’s no need to draw that connection. As you said “inference” that’s subject to interpretation.
@renato_mariotti @axios We need transparency.
@AdamB_ @brianklaas You really need to compare the influx of immigrants, most notably male refugees who have struggled to assimilate into German culture and responsible for massive criminal waves known as the New Years Frankfurt assaults, and smaller population size to that of the USA.
@AdamB_ @brianklaas Yes that much was obvious. But to compare a National Socialist aka a Nazi from Germany to a white supremacist from the USA when the politics and state of the countries is so vastly different is an erroneous comparison and superficial intelligence at best.
@AdamB_ @brianklaas “To Donald Trump”... pretty sure this is what we call explicit. Otherwise there is absolutely 0 relevancy.
@brianklaas Trump isn’t the Chancellor of Germany, how are you not blaming this on Angela Merkel? The actual Chancellor of Germany. You can’t really be so dense to blame Trump for what happens in Germany! Which is governed by who the left calls the “leader of the free world.”

@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC I’m not asking anything, the use of the N word is clearly not common knowledge. Nor is where Syria is on a map. You’re not the first person who wishes to remain naive but that’s your problem. Lay off the anger.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Haha all right this conversation is going nowhere since you simply can’t stay on subject.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC What “spelling” are you referring to now? Lol. Please tell me what spelling has to do with anything. And stop deflecting again lol.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Hardly passive or aggressive. You certainly are aggressive and extremely defensive and intellectually ignorant. That’s ok
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC The N word derives from the Latin term for negro which is means “black.” Its use as an adjective like noun to refer to a color of people to derogatory term evolved over time and use. Obviously it doesn’t mean the same to blacks as Indians because of its frequency.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC What “words” are you talking about? You’re not making any sense. I’m about to mute you because you’re incoherent.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC No you’re actually not answering. You’re responding by moving to a different issue. It’s ok. Many people that don’t know what they’re talking about argue as you have.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Clearly you don’t understand that I never said “you said ‘most’ white people.” I was emphasizing that it isn’t white people empowering its use, it’s prominent in the black community. Commonly used in music and daily conversations.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Do you continuously respond by not actually answering?
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Out of respect I’m speaking with you politely. I’m not going to point out your ignorance on the issue as you seem quite insular.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Because you hear black people saying it frequently. And it is personal to the black community. White people dont speak like that. If black people don’t care about it why would whites?
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC I’m trying to be polite even though you seem very intolerant and ignorant. I don’t need to troll or stoop to your level. https://t.co/NrpWXymCqW
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC White people did say it and it’s far less common today to the point that it’s a social taboo. It’s condemned immediately.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC The onus is on all people, white people who don’t say it and object to it, black people, and white people who do say it. We are all part of the same community man.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC When you say “plenty” how many are you referring to? What “shit-white” minority? I’m so lost, who or what makes up the “shit white?”
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Yes there is. Look it up. Commonly the word “Tree N*****” was used when white settlers were moving west and trading in the northeast. The word “sand n*****” was used when white people started interacting with Arabs. See Lawrence of Arabia.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC I never said that’s the N word...we both know what it is. What are you talking about? And those 2 other associations are only obscure because there were far less interaction between white people and Indians and blacks. That much is obvious.
@Platipotter @JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Most white people do not use the N word, but it does empower the minority. It’s also at the s if it’s use instead of its majority. It was commonly used up until the 70s, then it was controversial, now it’s pretty much excluded. You’ll never hear a white person say it publicly.
@PardesSeleh So if a girl keeps asking me to go to dinner you’re saying she’s interested?
@MSNBC @CoryBooker 485,000 documents = 10%? That’s a lie! Let’s also add that BKs 485,000 is more than the last 5 justices had combined.
@AG_Conservative The court has been made illegitimate apparently 37 times by the lack of confirmations for prior judges...😒
@BuckSexton I don’t know if the ref was right to penalize her but her reaction was ridiculous. To waste that much time and cry on the court? You see bad calls all the time and players complain all the time and some get in trouble and others don’t. Making this about sexism is wrong.
@omriceren The end of the human race is nigh
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Good to have a rather civil conversation, funny how they start out unruly but if both patient and actually interested in listening we can have dialogue. Gives me hope.
@jaketapper @WalshFreedom @BenSasse The mere desire for things to stay the same is rather foolish even though he’s arguably my favorite Republican.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Ok, well from what my black friends have taught me by explaining the expression it’s far worse than merely “sell out” given its historical implications. Also Jews have never called each other “kike.” Can we at least agree that the terms are unnecesssry and derogatory?
@MSNBC @chrislhayes @shireen818 Why did the USA fund the war in Yemen by supplying billions to Iran? 🤓🤔
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC By the way, the original use of the N word was not specifically used to apply only to black people but instead was used to refer to all non whites. That’s why Indians were referred to as “tree Ns” and Arabs “sand Ns” obviously all terrible and inappropriate.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Maybe it’s not racist among blacks, but if a white person used those words you’d certainly say it’s racist right?
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Let’s not forget that Muhammad and Islam treats the Jewish capital-Jerusalem as holy because every religion recognizes its importance and it’s holiness. No other city in the world is recognized by so many religions as holy.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Haha thanks for proving my point about you being an anti-Semite corrupted by Farrakhan. As Muslims continuously kill more Muslims than any other group has you completely ignore such realities.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC This is Twitter, let’s stop pretending that you tweet concisely or poignantly. I think all topics are best discussed from multiple perspectives. How you debate a topic within your community is different from how outsiders speak about what we observe.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Did you find that in the Bible? Lol Jesus is not mentioned in the Talmud or any Jewish scripture. He’s a nobody.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Tell me where the Talmud allows that? Lol. Clearly you don’t know the Jewish lineage. Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac had 12 boys including Jacob, those are the 3 fathers of Judaism. Isaac has 12 boys who became the 12 tribes of Israel. And that was far before 1948 lol
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC I agree. They have a right to their opinion but it perpetuates racism with derogatory language. If black people would stop using such language racist white people wouldnt be empowered to use it either. The black community has normalized this language and I think it hurts them.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan You’re repeating a deeply anti-Semitic book lol. Jesus was a JEWISH rabbi! Not a Christian. Every follower of Christianity has betrayed Jesus by believing in false gods. By the way, Islam and Judaism have more in common with each other than Christianity.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Shall we talk about all the Muslims killing each other during Ramadan? How about the wars in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, where Muslims are killing Muslims. Sunni vs Shia.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Lol I pity your ignorance but the world does need people like yourself to do tasks that others will not. But if you give up the hate and lies Farrakhan has imposed upon you you may still redeem yourself.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Haha what you say is completely incorrect. Judah was not the first Jew lol. Abraham was. This is not in dispute. Judah was one of the 12 sons of Isaac and one of the 12 tribes of Israel. Just read the Jewish bible and stop listening to the liar Louis Farrakhan.
@RealSaavedra Lol. He’s an idiot.
@KamalaHarris Ask the drivers if they want to adhere to the restrictions. I worked in the industry. They’re desperate for money and handcuffed by the regulations.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC For you, someone who understandably sees color in all things, I can understand how you wouldn’t want me, an outsider, to enter the fray, but for me, who doesn’t see it the same, does not just ignore Elie’s clearly extreme and derogatory language.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC “No need for anyone else to decide to take a stance on that matter.” Ok so then Americans shouldn’t take a stance on conflicts between non-Americans? Your apathy is really upsetting. And your opinions/restrictions on 1st Amendment rights are equally upsetting.
@genebsperling @serenawilliams Lol this was sexism? #everyonesavictim
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC And clearly elie felt empowered by calling Kanye a House N and an Uncle Tom, then again a few of my black friends referred to Obama as an Uncle Tom, I can’t imagine your stand for that.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC That’s such an ignorant comment. Should I not care about black people because I’m not black? I’ve seen how cops in Chicago have treated my Nigerian friends and I won’t stand for it. Elie is clearly hurting his community with his derogatory words and his intolerance.
@JD_Mccarroll @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC You give it a name and that name is then used to perpetuate racism, we don’t call fellow Jews “kikes.” Lol if you can’t see the difference than you have a severe brain deficiency. You empower people to use racist words by using them yourself.
@JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC Anyone who takes that fool seriously is of low intellect. The guy called Kanye West and “Uncle Tom” and “house N*****” He perpetuates racism by using such derogatory terms and shows his intolerance for different opinion. https://t.co/UcbjzRUo09

It’s ok you’re not the first person who has been deceived by Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam, and you won’t be the last. But us jews built your cell phones we are tracking you and recording all your conversations 😂
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Abraham was the first Jew! You don’t know what you’re talking about lol.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Nope, God too. God has promised the Jews the land and the other religions recognize this. You believe in lies. Try to steer from the path.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan God has tested the Jews. There is no doubt. But the land is not stolen. There has never been a Palestinian state the way you speak of. Before israel there was the British and before them 400 years of the ottomans.
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Haha stop listening to Farrakhan, Jews have lived in what is today israel for years. We have been expelled numerous times by numerous other cultures but we have the oldest claim to the land and everyone recognizes the Jewish history and connection to the land. Even Salahudin
@Aboriginalman1 @LouisFarrakhan Israel has been in existence way before 48 lol just not as the state of israel
@QalaFurqan You really don’t know the history of Israel 😂
@steve_vladeck I was wrong then. I appreciate your consistency.
@mattyglesias It’s amazing how unaware you guys are. Get out of your thought bubbles. Embrace diversity don’t run away from it.

@joesph_clifford Funny, I think you come across as the idiot, given your arguments that only apply the most extreme of examples. I never said that she can’t be racist. I said it’s difficult to imagine her being a white supremacist, and accepted by white supremacists given her heritage.
@joesph_clifford Of course not...again, stop seeing the world in superlatives. You claim she’s a white supremacist because she had her hands in a certain way. If that’s the extent of your evidence you’re an idiot.

@northeast_mama @StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin Oh great! Now it’s the Jewish conspiracy again, we run the world right? 😂 Well it’s been 75 years since the Holocaust so I’m not surprised that it’s coming back around. Thank you for adding yourself to the anecdotal evidence of LEFTISTS and DEMOCRATS who are anti-semites. https://t.co/uFiNDAy3g5
@joesph_clifford @StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin Of course they can be racist! What kind of question is that? Clearly you must believe that white supremacists aren’t racist towards Jews or Mexicans since you asked that question. Which begs me to ask- what is a white supremacist? 😂

@ALLCAPSTWEETX @NathanHRubin Tell me something as well, if Congress has decided (both parties have done this) to expand the powers of the executive, who’s to blame? Also it’s plainly obvious that you don’t understand how each branch checks a different one. You’d learn this in Con Law, at an elementary level.
@ALLCAPSTWEETX @NathanHRubin I guess you’re not aware how FDR stacked a liberal bench over his 13 years in office, I recommend that you read Scorpions by Feldman. Also Kavanaugh’s confirmation will be the first time in 40+ years that the conservatives hold sway on the bench. You really need to do your HW.

He knows he shows his lack of knowledge about the Holocaust with his comparisons. And you can say what you want. I won’t fuck off you POS 😘
@StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin I already won. Your moronic reasoning and illogical arguments gave it away from the beginning. People with even half a brain laugh at you.
@StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin Yes, and your mind believes what it wants to believe. Funny how #factsmatter was really just a slogan for you dingos on the left. She’s MEXICAN and JEWISH, tell me something, do you consider Mexicans or Jews to be white supremacists?
@StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin https://t.co/V42Co5Xjbn	Looks like your eyes didn’t see this...🙄
@NathanHRubin It’s ridiculous that you claim some small account like my own is pushing a narrative as if I was being paid. I bet the real reality is that people find your group and pay you to write certain things. Take off your kippah, don’t wear tfillin, don’t observe, you’re unworthy
@NathanHRubin I will always work to combat REAL anti-semitism whereas you will try to claim fake anti-semtisim to advance some tribalistic political goal. It’s obvious from your account how little you know.
@NathanHRubin Please! I’m Jewish and you embarrass our people everyday with your lies! Jews like you are the same Jews who sold out my family during the holocaust! You have besmirched and belittle the tragedy of our people by likening Trump to Hitler and USA to Nazi Germany.
@StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin She’s a JEWISH MEXICAN AMERICAN. You think the Jewish or Mexican parts of her would be disqualifying? And now you say she looks nervous? I don’t see anything you see, then again I don’t believe in conspiracies like you do.
@NathanHRubin https://t.co/P2DdmhPzqn
@StableGeniusRN @NathanHRubin I have watched it. She COULD be signaling “OK” a common hand gesture to someone on the dais, or, and more likely she subconsciously placed her hand in that position to stretch her fingers. But you keep believing some conspiracy theory absent evidence, probably not your 1st.
@NathanHRubin If you think the USA is an authoritarian state than you don’t know what “authoritarian” means. Courts are STILL independent of POTUS influence- see Manafort trial, Mueller investigation. Congress STILL holds votes on legislation. All levels of gov have own autonomy.

@fred_guttenberg You openly have opposed Kavanaugh, posted it on twitter that you will work to prevent him from being confirmed and pull a stunt like this. You had my sympathies when your daughter was murdered but this is new territory and your actions are despicable.
@fred_guttenberg Can’t stop trying to make a big deal about it can you? What you did was highly inappropriate, self-serving, and now you claim he intentionally disrespected you and had you removed by security...you may have suffered a tragedy but you’re a nobody. Now you’re a political pawn.

@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 Haha “whataboutism” the new phrase of the left when they don’t like the conversation. Those were all different forms of immigration policies, based on excluding a whole nation and putting a people in concentration camps. Seriously read some books lol
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 Hahahahaha you really don’t know what you’re talking about. If France was winning why did USA land at Normandy? Why did the USA and Russia close in on Paris? Why did the USA close in in Berlin? You’re a moron!! 😂😂😂
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 Lol you really want to talk about the EU? Europe is DYING!! Their economy is not revolutionary, it’s not on the cuttin edge, it’s manufacturing and service. You’re out of your element Donny.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm What citizens are being separated from their families? Also the illegal immigrants being separated from the children they bring along with them only occurs when there is no documentation of a familial relationship. I guess you don’t care about human trafficking- you’re so naive.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm Lol where is your evidence? Please tell me what he’s been charged with. 😂😂 try not being so angry and emotional and instead rely on logic and facts.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm Oh yea? What is his high crime and why is the entire country operating that he hasn’t? He’s still President and no proceedings have begun against him. You realize how easy you make this? You sound like a moron.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm But it doesn’t matter about right and wrong. Especially when it’s not connected to the justice system. It’s a political tool. Just find me evidence of Trump being a traitor...I know you’ll be searching forever lol.

@theblaze I wasn’t going to watch it but now that this is what it’s all about I can’t wait to start!
@renato_mariotti Where is the comparison?
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm Don’t even tell me “as a Jew.” There are no concentration camps in America. My people were stripped of all earthly possessions separated from their families in their own country, and shipped to other countries on long marches or cattle cars before being murdered!
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX Europe benefited from us saving them and us funding the rebuild with the Marshall plan. The EU has stagnant economic growth, 35 hour work week and 41 vacation days. They don’t contribute to the world as you think they’ve rested on their laurels for too long.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX And if you want to talk about Europe let us recognize that Europe was conquered by Germany in WW2. The USA and Russia RESCUED it, the Vichy French GAVE up and GB was decimated as was most of Europe. And that was 80 years ago!
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX Also go look at how FDR treated the Japanese, or denied Jews entry to USA fleeing Europe during WW2. Or Teddy R and his treatment towards the Chinese. Or maybe how America treated the Irish, Germans and polish in the 1850s, this is nothing like Nazi germany.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX Obviously Hitler didn’t start out as a murderous dictator, he calmly rose through the ranks the of National SOCIALIST Party. Have you heard of Kristalnacht? Or making Jews wear yellow stars? Where is that happening in the USA? It’s not, we aren’t even remotely close.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX Actually it does exonerate him! If anything his words would merely be evidence to be weighed by a jury. There’s no actions to support any such claim that he has influenced law enforcement. Mere words do not suffice.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm Impeachment is for high crimes and misdeamanirs- and both of those actually are CRIMES.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm Impeachment can be done so long as a single party has the right numbers! Anyone who would use a power to deny the American electorate their dutifully elected President is not fit to serve as a congressman if motivated by solely by politics.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm Please find me that party slogan for the Nazi party. Just one publication from Germany. You’re a moron who has shown he knows nothing about German history or World War 2.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm Illegal immigrants have NO RIGHT to enter or be in the USA. Enforcing our laws does not make him Hitler who put Jews in ghettos then sent them to concentration and death camps to die! My people were exterminated for religious beliefs, not even right to compare them! Moron.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm As a Jew it saddens me how wrong you are about what Hitler did and what annoys me is how Hitler’s targeting and murdering of 120 of my family members is being likened to our current President who is preventing illegal immigrants from entering whereas Hitler killed German citizens
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm You’ve moved the discussion to something it’s not about. He hasn’t made any such direction to commit some crime. This mere statement doesn’t rise anywhere near any crime. In fact he is opining, the mere rousing of impeachable offenses in relation to this tweet is nonsensical.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm This has nothing to do with logic and everything with knowing the law, lay people, such as yourself don’t seem to understand that, or obviously, the law.
@jeneration_XX @Windhorse_1 @joshtpm Well perhaps it’s just you because let’s be real, you have Hitler under a Trump mask. Shows how little you know about Hitler or how quickly and moronically you compare the two by comparing Trump to someone who MURDERED over 11 million people and started WW2.
@Windhorse_1 @jeneration_XX @joshtpm No words CANNOT be crimes on their own. You need an INTENT to bring about some sort of crime, knowingly (conspiracy) or unknowingly, as well as an act in furtherance of the act. Seems like you don’t understand 1st Amendment Freedom of Speech rights.
@jeneration_XX @joshtpm You’re not a lawyer are you- I bet you don’t understand the first thing about the law.
@JohnBrennan America is best when it’s citizens are happy, successful and thriving. Been about 10 years since the last time that was happening.
@joshtpm What he says is not a crime, now if there were some sort of actions then that’s a different story but we don’t live in 1984 where the thought police can do as it please to us.

@historBilia @AndrewGillum Hasn’t he been doing that all week? This isn’t the first time he’s being asked about it. He made his statements already now it’s time to move on to substance
@historBilia @AndrewGillum Even if this guy was an anti-immigrant proponent, who in his government capacity hired militants to kill hundreds if not thousands of Chinese workers? Ok I can respect that since he did many other great things for the nation. Just wanted to be sure.
@historBilia @AndrewGillum I’m sure has endured far worse than to pay heed to robocalls. It’s always those who are close to us whose words hurt the most. His office green lighted the question pre production is my point.
@historBilia @AndrewGillum By the way, your banner with Teddy Roosevelt is highly ironic given that he continued the Chinese exclusion Act, hired the Knights of Labor to kill Chinese, and betrayed Korea and the Chinese by assisting the Japanese in their military pursuits.
@Susan_Hennessey How about all the faux outrage from Democrats about McCain? Never watched a more disingenuous group of people.
@leighcavalierca @AndrewGillum So this interview where he is clearly talking about race and calling DeSantis a racist is considered by you as “talking about the issues?” Seems like all you focus on is the race card given your hashtag...
@historBilia @AndrewGillum His office told CNN which questions he’d answer, all networks do this. His office, if they really cared about the issues, and not talk about race, should have said that they would not address this question. Strictly used to paint DeSantis as a racist, ignore substance.
@ThomasGBarber1 @AndrewGillum Please, only dogs hear dog whistles. He said “monkey this up” the same way Obama said “democrats and republicans” were monkeying up politics in 08. Furthermore, DeSantis was talking about the voters, not Gillum. Learn to listen.
@historBilia @AndrewGillum Yes, and are you so naive to think that he wasn’t told beforehand the type of questions he’d be asked?
@AndrewGillum So then why are you talking about race and not the issues? Looks like you swallowed your foot.
@JonahNRO Why do you generalize about Trump supporters like that? I’m one and certainly don’t call for the government to regulate social media, or social media to censor freedom of speech. I think you’ve been listening to a few amplified voices that don’t represent the majority.

@bethanyshondark He was treated unfairly and smeared by the democrats at every turn BUT he did lie to the people about Iraq and WMDs and embedded us in wars we didn’t need to fight.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman Good lick and good day! Wish you the best going forward, it was nice to converse with you civilly and politely.
@johnkruzel Depends on what you write really. If you lie, intend to deceive, or write things that are speculation and opinion and pass it off as fact you are in fact an enemy of the people. You’re a propagandist. The service of your father and grandfather are irrelevant. Both good men though
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman Our current system is a disaster, and when we decide to take an industry that represents 1/6th of GDP we are essentially handing that industry over to the government. That’s far too much control for my liking.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman The pooling of people help the sick people involved. Whereas the healthy end up spending more money on services that don’t benefit them.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman Obvious facts, but forcing someone to buy insurance, in my mind violates fundamental freedoms. They’re essentially taxes except not progressive taxes.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman Yes but more of the costs are covered by the injured party. ER visits unfortunately cause insurance to go up.
@StephenMilIer At least so far as the ACA vote was concerned, not sure about the rest of his life though.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman What happens if they can’t afford college tuition because they’ve been paying for medical treatment they don’t need, or a death occurs and they can’t pay funeral expenses, or if they are fired and can’t pay their mortgage or for food. We all have problems, life isn’t perfect.
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman I’m not an insurer but would probably be “fair” would be based on a complex mathematical assessment based on cost of treatment, ability to pay, quality of treatment, etc. do you think it’s fair to healthy people to pay for the afflictions of your family and neglect their own?
@waverlypgw @paulkrugman I’m very sorry to hear that and while my view may seem insensitive consider that, the medical devices are manufactured, the doctors pay for schools, the drug companies have to experiment with no guarantee of success, plus there is liability, this is a complex industry.
@paulkrugman That makes no economic sense! People who have preconditions obviously require more care than someone who does not. Insurers should not be allowed to deny coverage, except in rare circumstances, and the preconditioned insured should pay hire premiums.
@paulkrugman Can you remind me the congressional vote that codified this poem, at the feet of the Statue of Liberty, into law? I’ll wait.

@DevonBroeske @NathanHRubin If you want to turn a compliment it to some racist term go right ahead, I’m going to continue to feel pride when I am told I’m articulate. And I will continue to praise well spoken individuals and tell them they are articulate, regardless of color, no matter what.
@DevonBroeske Lol get out of here! You don’t just get to take some word, interpret it your own way, and corrupt its meaning! I’m a white man and I have been told that I am articulate, and articulate my argument. You mean to tell me they were insulting my because I was black? FFS, GTFOH w/ BS
@NathanHRubin Everyone breaks the law, stop cherry picking comments in order to divide this country. Just like the argument now that “articulate” is racist, is someone calls you “articulate” say thank you, it’s a compliment regardless of race.
@AG_Conservative I don’t know, the eulogies were pretty petty themselves. Everyone took a pot shot at Trump, pretty cringeworthy because it seemed like they all colluded on the same message.

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib Lol what he says is not in dispute! Your words are harmful to the plight of the Palestinian citizens! The corrupt governments run by Abbas and Hamas enrich their leaders to the detriment of the people! And paying people to kill Jews instead of spend on social safety nets is too!
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib Hahahahahaha
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib And look up this man who is the son of a hamas agent, his story is authentic! It’s not in dispute. You don’t have to like it but then again I don’t like terrorists or their supporters and apologists (like you) either. Go back to taking pictures, don’t want to hurt your brain.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib You post YouTube videos because you don’t know the facts yourself! You’re not a learned person-obviously. You cite to peoples who’s opinions aren’t respected. I posted articles from all over and have done enough research to where I don’t need to cite. Look up what I wrote- truth!
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib Lol I replied with far more than wikipedia and over 10 news articles. Are you purposefully ignoring that?and yes people are deciding as they have in the past. Why don’t you just concede these facts? Let’s not forget our son of Hamas who spoke at the UNHRC...
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib Lol we are on polar opposite sides of this debate. One of us uses facts (me) and the other person doesn’t even know the history of the people he defends...there is ample evidence that what I say is fact and what you’ve provided is not mainstream yet alone seriously accepted.

@ESPNFC No
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC @RandaHabib No one denies that Palestinians have been killed, anymore than does anyone deny that Hamas is a terrorist organization or that Abbas and the PA are terrorist financiers or terrorists themselves.

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Oh and by the way, before the ayatollahs stole and corrupted Iran, israel and Iran has very good if not great relations. Let’s not forget Iran is persian not Arab. Different people. Islam conquered Persia, just like it did Egyptian culture, it won’t conquer Israel, ever again.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Is this like you being unable to mention a single Palestinian leader before 67? Lol
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC What? You’re not making sense. It’s fairly obvious given Jewish history that not everyone loves Jews, then again many people can claim the same. Still Jews survive and thrive.

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC They will, so long as politics are involved, and behind the scenes they will continue to increase cooperation, as they have been lately, with the Jewish state of Israel. India, Japan, China, KSA, other Arab nations will continue to grow closer to Israel
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Because of anti-semitism and Arab oil money. Don’t you know anything? By the way what’s your address so I can send you my bill 😂😂😂😂

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Yes let’s talk about the Muslims in the Knesset, the gay pride parades in Tel Aviv, the Baha’i temple, the Christian pilgrims who flock to Israel, let’s talk about th Druze, what else lol

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC I cited to him to prove the point how I can cite 1 person out of many and make your same argument.

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC It’s really sad that you support terrorism and the murder of innocents and don’t see that the Palestinians are a made up people and took of more powerful Arabs.

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC I’m not trying to win, I already won! Israel has won! The Jewish people have won! 😂😂😂😂start admitting the facts, start acknowledging the truth. Just tell me if a single Palestinian leader before Arafat lol
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Oh so now you support killing 30 JEWS?! You are a sick fuck. Thanks for admitting that this massacre did occur! That your “people” are anything but benevolent. Should we talk about all the Jews killed by Muhammad at Medina?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Oh Sweden? And how many nations recognize Israel? Everyone but the Arab/Muslim nation’s? Lol oh and now Bin Salman of KSA has been working with Israel! Just admit it- there is no Palestine! It’s a made up people with no history, no state and no evidence of their existence.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Ah still can’t even admit facts, it says how the Palestinians honored the terrorist who killed 30 children! Talk about the benevolent Muslims 😂😂😂😂

@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Yes the Jewish people were expelled by Arabs between 1100 and 1800, many were forced to FLEE to Europe! You are proving my point lol. Salahudin WELCOMED JEWS BACK after he retook Jerusalem- why do you think he WELCOMED THEM BACK?! Because it’s our homeland 😂🤣🤣
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Tell me more about the Palestinian people lol. You’re angry and a moron haha I just wish you’d admit it but that’s perhaps why you are slow, you simply can’t admit the facts! 😂😂😂🤣
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Now you’re talking about race? Hahaha clearly you don’t know how many time Jews were kicked out of our homeland! Just because we were expelled and occupied we never gave up and never will. Israel is the preeminent power in the Middle East and we did it in under 80 years 🤣🤣🤣
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC You can’t type out the name of a single Palestinian leader prior to Arafat? You can’t even tell me the coinage? You can’t tell me the history at all! Because you know deep down what you believe is a lie! I pity you because you are incapable 😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Convert semites? Tell me why there are 14 million Jews in the world and we don’t seek out converts or force people to convert with a sword to the throat? Lol you’re a barbarian! A savage! You know this and yet you can’t admit it. Are you touched? Slow?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Hahahahaha you don’t know!! 😂😂😂😂😂you can’t even cite to one shrewd of evidence! You know this and yet you still believe this. Guess what- Santa clause, the Easter bunny, and the monster under your bed aren’t real either 😉🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Seriously, who came before Arafat? What connects the “Palestinians” to each other? What and where was the Palestinian seat of government? Where is the archaeological evidence of their existence? Why was Palestina the name for the Jewish homeland between 200BC and 400 AD?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Anti-jew really...don’t lie about it, you called me a kike. That’s a Jewish slur, and it speaks more about you than me. But tell me about the Palestinian Lol. Tell me about the Palestinian history, when did whatever they are control the land known as Israel?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol still deflecting are you? Can’t even cite to one person! Can’t cite to the form of government! Can’t even tell me the coinage. Before israel was recognized again it was controlled by the Brits, before that and for 400 years the ottomans, and Jews paid taxes to them.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Haha and 100% stupid then. Everyone knows when someone says you’re an “anti-Semite” we are referring to “anti-jew.” The Semitic people are a group from the Fertile Crescent. But we have nation states now...then again photographers aren’t known for their brains, I expect too much
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC I love how angry I have made you, it continues to show that what I say is true and you’re just an angry little boy who is upset that the false narrative you believe is a lie! 😂😂😂😂😂
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Why don’t you tell it to me? Lol come in buddy...I bet you can make it up...tell me if a single Palestinian leader before Arafat, tell me about the government they controlled, who did they trade with? What was the currency? What archaeological evidence supports this? 😂😂😂😂😂
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Who came before Arafat? What were the borders of the “Palestinian state?” Where is the archaeological evidence? What was your form of government? What is the story of your people? Lol. You morons make this too easy!
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Oh I’m a “kike?” Well at least we know you’re an anti-Semite lol. Nice way to mask it, it’s like your digital hijab just came off lol.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol “the myth of Israel?” 😂😂😂tell me why Salahudin welcomed the Jews BACK into Jerusalem after he expelled the crusaders in the 900s? You really don’t know anything about this conflict yet alone amazing Arab leaders!
@Enigma0021 @ThinkersRave @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC His head must hurt...😂
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC What land was taken from you? Lol. The Palestinians are a fake people! They were created in 67. Palestinian is an English name, and it referred to the Jewish homeland. You have no history, leaders, coinage, government that preceded 67! 😂
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol it’s far from an apartheid state. Clearly you don’t know what an apartheid is. Minorities have rights in Israel, they serve in the Knesset, the government, the military, the Supreme Court/legal system, own businesses, have jobs, etc.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC If someone said they were going to kill you would you give them a gun?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Perhaps because they have called for the destruction of Israel? Israel could destroy Iran in under a day and that would benefit the Iranian people from Khameni and his terrorist loving scum. He is an oppressor to his own people. And the Persian people were a great people.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC History already has decided! Look at the feee pluralistic society of Israel, tolerant of many, and then compare it to the Arab nations whose people suffer terrible conditions due to oppressive dictators.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Until you start loving life and you denounce these terrorists who sacrifice women and children and lay people to commit suicide you will always be on the wrong side of history!
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC BecUse you can’t! That’s the reality. Just admit you don’t like facts and the truth. That by every measure the people you support are terrorists, that the Arab nations and groups you speak of are weak and the people suffer while the corrupt government enriches its leaders
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC By the way checked out your IG you take some cool pics but you couldn’t be more wrong and your support for terrorism encourages the deaths of Muslim women and children as pawns of said terrorists.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC How many times has israel defeated the Arab nation armies that surround it? Oh yea 6...at least. You need to just admit the facts bucko
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Hahahaha kicked Israel’s ass? That’s why their leaders hide underground? Why they store their arms in civilian populations? Because their scared little pussycats that’s why haha. Israel knows restraint and love of life, your terrorist brethren sacrifice women and children.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Hahaha Israel is a threat? Tell me how israel invaded Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt in 1948...oh wait it was the other way around. Let’s also compare the size of israel to the rest of the Middle East. Also tell me what land israel “occupies.” What country?
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol nasrallah calls israel weak and can’t even show his face in public! He’s afraid if he does he’d get assassinated because hezbollah lacks the training and technology of Israel!
@WalshFreedom We live in a world where everyone in politics and the media is lying to us. What is the truth when everyone believes something differently? We make our own truth because it’s impossible to authenticate everything ourselves. And for the most part it seems to be working out.
@CuomoPrimeTime @MichaelAvenatti @ChrisCuomo Lol fat chance. No judge is going to rule that that is more important than governing. And the ego of avenatti is so big I definitely expect him to throw his hat in the ring for President lol
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Hahahahahaha this couldn’t be further from the truth! The population in Gaza and West Bank is growing! What a twit
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC I want to know what you think of Abbas or Haniyeh, or Sinwar, if you even know who they are...it’ll be very telling about your knowledge
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC When will Muslims pay reparations to all the Jews and Christians and other minorities it’s kicked out of their lands? When are the Muslims going to stop causing conflicts in Africa and SE Asia? They colonized Indonesia!!
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC If you stand on the side of someone who honors terrorists and murderers, responsible for killing innocent civilians and targeting athletes than you are as evil as the murderers themselves and simply lack the courage to commit the acts.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol the IDF is the most powerful military in the Middle East, with the best trained soldiers, the most advanced technology, and every Israeli citizen over 18 is trained. The Middle East could be destroyed by Israel in 2 weeks if it wishes.
@ThinkersRave @Enigma0021 @SUP3RNAT1JRAL @LuckyHeronSay @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol Israel has the best trained military in the Middle East, every citizen over 18 is trained, has the most advanced technologies, and could destroy the entire Middle East in under 2 weeks.

@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC The settlements being built are in less than 2% of the West Bank. There is so much land that is goin to waste and we have made the land successful and beautiful and provide more good will and benefits to the rest of the world. The Pals are also a people with a history since 1967
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC If you understood that our land has been, at least historically before we were kicked out and occupied, encompassing all land west of the Jordan than you’d understand. But also the Palestinians arent building on the disputed land. Instead they pay for terrorism to kill Jews.
@BigKevi @HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Yes, it is very humane. Tell me how many militaries warm enemy combatants and civilian populations of impending conflict?
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Israel hasn’t killed or maimed thousands of Palestinian protestors. They have defended against Palestinians trying to break through a border fence and have captured Israelis. We don’t want blood shed! We want peace and we want relations and security for our children.
@MrAAH02 @freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Hahahaha really?! Tell me why the Bible and the Quran both talk about Jerusalem and the land of the Jews? Which means Jews lived there before 300 AD and 617 AD. You’re an ignoramus who needs to read books. If you think hews come from Europe you’re an idiot.
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Appropriate force means what? Equal force?
@MrAAH02 @freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Exactly- you have the flag of a nation that has never existed. That just so happens to want to take the land of Israel as its own state. Unless of course you’re against Hamas, Islamic jihad, the PA, etc. you support terrorism against Jews and Israel.
@MrAAH02 @freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC The flags and the fact that you said “they lie.” Lol. Got anymore brain busters?
@MrAAH02 @freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Alright terrorist lover. Next time Israel pulls a Munich murder against Palestinians sports delegation we can talk.
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC I don’t agree that Israel is using excessive force given that we could destroy Hamas and the P.A. in a single night. We could be killing far more civilians but we call their phones, send pamphlets warn them in advance. I cant imagine you’d let someone shoot at your kids freely.
@freddiemeade @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Chelsea fan but I’m a yank ;) though I’ve been told i espouse views between ukip and the Tories lol. I think that’s a blend of Farage and the conservatives.
@thehill This headline is so inflammatory and inaccurate. This is why certain members of the media are enemies of the people!
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Thank you for finally making a serious statement. I’ve heard this excessive argument before and calls for adequate and equal force...Israel does as much as possible to limit the civilian deaths. We want relations with our neighbors and Hamas and P.A. are terrible to the citizens

@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC No I’m defending a nation from the terrorist acts of Hamas, Islamic jihad, and the PLO who have paid people to murder innocent Jewish civilians. You truly are an evil person. And those “protestors” were members of Hamas, hamas even admitted to this. Stop ignoring the facts.

@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Yea I’ve read it you fool. It codifies what we already know.
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC You mean the law that doesn’t restrict the rights of anyone but simply declares that Israel is the nation of the Jews
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Because their leaders refuse to hold them! Hamas refuses to hold elections! Abbas refuses to hold elections! Those aren’t democracies they’re dictators. And just look at the leaders lavish lifestyles.
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Yes for the most part. Unfortunately Orthodox Judaism controls a lot and it treats all non Orthodox Jews differently from Orthodox Jews.
@freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Lol you’re a clown. You don’t say a single fact and call me out for not citing evidence.
@freddyzx @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC No what I’m saying is factual, if you don’t like the truth that’s your problem. But I’ll be here to make sure people know the truth
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Also calling is an apartheid state is ridiculous. We have Arabs in our parliament, owning businesses, minorities in parliament, in business, in the military, in government, on the Supreme Court. Piss off with Corbyn you idiot
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC You just called Hamas and Abbas democratically elected and yet acknowledge that they haven’t held an election in 11 years and still blame Israel and the Jews. You’re an anti-Semite or a dunce. Which is it?
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC You’re joking right? Neither Hamas in Gaza, nor Abbas in the West Bank have held elections in over 11 years!
@HugwithaH @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC If you knew anything about the conflict and his actions supporting and commemorating current Hamas and former black September terrorists you wouldn’t say that
@SonnySosa5 @jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC Just read all the articles that have come out where he’s been supporting Hamas terrorists the last 7 years
@jeremycorbyn @ClaptonCFC And you’re a bigger supporter of killing Jews...piss off.
@jimsciutto You still have a job?! Lol. What did the last “study” say? 5000 deaths. I’m guessing #lannydavis was your source again 😂
@13diesel13 @realOsamaHT @cjwerleman Haha you just sound like someone who doesn’t know what they’re talking about and wanted to deflect from the brutal oppression and violence Muslims do onto others. The Shi’a/Sunni struggle has killed more Muslims and is currently responsible for more deaths and conflict.
@13diesel13 @realOsamaHT @cjwerleman Please do! Please share this video of Bibi thanking ISIS for their services. I can’t wait for you to look even more idiotic than you do already. Israel is going to be a natural gas exporter working with nations like Greece and Cyprus to export all around the Mediterranean.
@theIMEU Hahahaha this is a sick joke! The Palestinian women are victims of Palestinian men who have deprived so many of equal rights. This story is consistent to how Muslim women are treated throughout the Middle East you help to stifle women’s rights! You disgust me
@13diesel13 @realOsamaHT @cjwerleman You want to talk about oil versus the murder of innocents? Oh jeez are you demented. Let’s talk oil and natural gas anyways tho since you can’t follow a conversation. How much natural gas has israel found in the levant? How many trillions? Oh I think it’s something like 30 trill
@SkywalkerXX5 @cjwerleman Even if you say God didn’t give it to the Jews, the Jewish people took it from the canaanites and remain to this day a living people. Property law 101, the Jewish people were there first and still have legal claim to the land.

@cjwerleman Lol also great editing out the Palestinians throwing rocks at the soldiers
@cjwerleman Except everything you wrote was a lie. Its been the Jewish homeland for 3500 years and Jews have lived there for years and centuries they simply didn’t have the ability to control the land because they were invaded and occupied by Romans, Christians, Persians, Turks, Muslims, etc

@AG_Conservative McCain comes from a dying breed of moderates/centrists. It’ll be some time before we see such a return. Between Obama and Trump we have entered a new era of politics.
@Cernovich Same thing they’re doing to Bush.
@thehill Just a symbolic move to force trump to take a position. Unnecesssry do Trump shouldnjust sign on
@DanielBShapiro Do you feel that the Palestinians have received special treatment in regards to the definition of a “refugee?” I’m not aware of any other group of people who have such treatment.
@crk_flyer40 @AG_Conservative That’s why Trump was elected, he fought back. Republicans don’t seem to realize that fighting back, as the dems do consistently, energized the voters and displays a vigor and zeal that the Republican Party lacks. Only Trump fights like a democrat.
@AG_Conservative They used the same tactics against Trump, calling him a racist, that they had against Romney, McCain and Bush. When they restore to the same tactics against every republican it diminishes their argument.

@DanielBShapiro It seems rather disingenuous and similar to the echo chambers that Ben Rhodes spoke of in 2015 to sell the Iran deal when you link to a thread that cites to you. Still, I appreciate your efforts in supporting our people in Israel and serving our people in America. Thank you.

@TenneyNow @jstreetdotorg @realDonaldTrump What you don’t like the facts?
@TenneyNow @jstreetdotorg @realDonaldTrump Well it’s obvious you don’t know what you’re talking about. Cheering on the side of murderers and terrorists makes you a horrible person.
@TenneyNow @jstreetdotorg @realDonaldTrump If you don’t know what it has to do with anything you probably shouldn’t be talking about this subject
Talk about an embarrassment to the legal profession! Embarrasses us all for the manner in which he treats people who disagrees with his views. Absolutely disgusting abhorrent comments to call @kanyewest an “Uncle Tom” and “House negro.” Then he blocks me 😂 https://t.co/X7PrfP3QMa
@TenneyNow @jstreetdotorg @realDonaldTrump Oh and I’ve held these views far before Trump. Go and rewatch black September, the 1st and 2nd intifadas, lone wolf attacks of the last 7 years, read the Hamas charter, Abbas is a terrorist financier.
@TenneyNow @jstreetdotorg @realDonaldTrump What kind of person cheers for people killing innocent civilians? Stop siding with terrorism. I’m very well educated on these issues I have nothing to take back. I wonder when you’ll start standing up for freedom and life and not glorifying murderers and calling them the victims.

@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Lol ok then you’re an idiot, which I thought before hand since you’ve proven you think on a superficial level and I’m done having this conversation.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Really? Perhaps you’ve ignored his attacks on Cohen, sessions, McCain, JEFF flake, merkel, Trudeau, Clinton, Warren, Cruz, Christie, strozk, Page, comey, McCabe, May, macron, etc. they’re all white.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Do you need me to show you antifa and black lives matter violence against people they don’t agree with? And stop generalizing.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill I proudly support Trump. I’m pretty sure not a single one of my black friends would ever call me a racist.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Right I can tell you’re led by emotion, I tend to be led by my brain. Such as applying the law equally. Trump calls many people idiots, regardless of sex and color, or political party, that doesn’t make him a racist.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Of course they can protest! And of course that welcomes criticism! Kneeling during the anthem, seriously?? Talk about spoiled and ungrateful. Go to nearly any country in the world and your life won’t be good there as it is in the USA.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Attacking LeBron was stupid, but stop making out that LeBron is so innocent. He’s attacked trump numerous times. Trump should rise above it but he has a 1st Amendment right just like LBJ. And don lemon is an idiot though. Calling someone dumb isn’t racist.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Exactly! 1 person! By one psychopath! There were hundreds of not thousands of people there and you are now generalizing about a whole group of people! Stop what you’re doing it’s intellectually dishonest!
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill You don’t know why these people support trump, maybe it’s because he puts Americans first and not non Americans. Are some of his supporters racists? Absolutely. Just like some supporters of the left are racist and anti-Semitic.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Yes there were fine people on both sides. Not all people resorted to violence, not all people were kkk and white supremacists. You’ve been led to believe that due to fake news and edited content by left wing media.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill He’s even come out in support of players protesting just not during the national anthem. Talk about naive, spoiled, ungrateful people. Tell me another country were you get laid millions to play a game and your fans only make thousands.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill It’s a fact that he said some Mexicans are rapists and murderers, he never said all. There’s nothing racist about attacking LeBron James. There’s absolutely nothing racist about attacking kneeling MILLIONAIRES who protest during the national anthem.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill But let’s not absolve antifa and black lives matters from the violence they wreaked in these people they disagreed with. Both sides were violent and I didn’t see democrats condemning violence from the left. We have freedom of speech and opinion, you can’t be violent though.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill No he said there were very fine people on both sides and there were bad people on both sides. I don’t imagine someone who hasn’t lived in the south to understand that the confederate flag doesn’t represent simply slavery. Also what happened there was hijacked by Kkk
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill You’re being naive. I would say democrats don’t fact check, there’s a reason why they live in echo chambers. Even Ben Rhodes has said how stupid journalists were during the obama admin because they don’t research they just accepted what the WH said and published it.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill And to be honest, my friends that grew up on farms in midwestern Kansas, or Nebraska, or Iowa don’t seem to have anything bad to say about black people because for the most part their communities have few if any, living around them.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Ok well those are your experiences. I have the same experiences interacting with my democrat friends, even the ones with college educations. Even neighbors have asked me what my black friends were doing at my apartment, and that was in Chicago.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Ok well thanks for proving my point. I don’t find trump to be racist, in fact and unfortunately many of my friends from liberal bastions have used the n word and avoid black people. I’ve even heard people in Seattle attack Jews for being Jewish.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Of course I’ve watched hannity, rarely though. Sure he’s full of shit, the same way Don lemon, Rachel maddow, cuomo, Burnett, tucker, ingraham, cooper, O’Donnell, Hayes are full of shit. These people are all purposefully misleading their audiences and represent a partisan view.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill I went to school in Kansas and that couldn’t be further from the truth. Especially given internet access. These people may not live right next door to others but they’re able to receive higher educations regardless. Many choose not to to help on their family farms.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill You know who makes claims that other people are racist right off the bat? Stupid people. Because they don’t know nor are capable about arguing substance.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill You have this belief that people from rural communities are hillbillies and thus stupid. This is flat out incorrect. They have different interests and values perhaps. Not to mention the MSM says these people are motivated by racial animus. It’s disgusting smears.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill No that’s what left wing media tells you. And left wing media tells you you can’t trust Fox News or Brett Barr or drudge. It tells you don’t pay attention to the economic numbers, don’t pay attention to the increased pay check size, don’t pay attention to removal of regulations.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill What do you consider higher education? I don’t understand how they have access if they can’t afford it.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Trust me, most Americans are uninformed, and as I’ve stated, 70% lack college educations, you can look that up on your own if you’re willing to research. Do you think poor urban citizens are educated? You’re not applying the same standard.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Let’s be honest, a prostitute doesn’t need an education to be a prostitute.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Regardless of whatever party you’re in, there is a strong likelihood that you aren’t educated, 7/10 people lack college educations.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Prostitute*
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill See that’s what angers me- why do you call them uneducated? You’re a prostitution, you don’t live in a rural community, you’re uneducated. And let’s talk turkey, only 30% if USA citizens have a college education, so 70% of our voting electorate is “uneducated.”
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Well it’s pretty basic that most gun owners live in rural communities, at least legal gun owners. Also 80% of American counties went to trump, especially the rural ones.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill I’m all for legalizing your profession. But our discussions started with trump impeachment and what Americans would do in response to said impeachment.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Repeat clients that have trouble seducing women or maintaining healthy relationships. Look I appreciate everything you do for those men, they need your help, but your forte is clearly prostitution, I don’t see how your qualified as to how you know about Americans and their views.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill So the majority of your clientele is comprised of men whose wives are suffering from diseases that has led them to lose interest in sex?
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill Maybe you are just not understanding that, to your Johns, you’re just an object.
@LadyJacklyn @FatDrunkBastard @thumbolt65 @BillTzamaras @thehill You clearly don’t understand men lol especially desperate men who can’t get laid or aren’t in relationships. Then again I don’t have to pay for it since I have open communication and share with my partners.

The federal rules are also voluminous. Point is that unless you understand the legal system, you most likely you don’t understand.

@CassieSays_1 @LadyJacklyn @BillTzamaras @thehill Lol you think that 65% of the country is anti-trump? I’ll say 35-40% is pro trump, 35-40% is anti-trump and the rest are independents. And I’d be happy to see how it plays out. I wouldn’t hope for impeachment if I were you. Anger is a great motivator.
@TJtoho1 @BillTzamaras @thehill What minority are you speaking of? Trump won the electoral college overwhelmingly and the popular vote has never been used to elect the President. But I agree criminal justice isn’t about polls or public opinion, which makes the discussions by the journalists irrelevant.

@thaetan @jaynordlinger You consider yourself a constitutionalist, so I ask, are you a conservative?
@thaetan @jaynordlinger I’m not excusing his behavior just being a realist. HRC lies about her 33,000 emails right? Obama lied about  Benghazi, bush lied about WMDs in Iraq, Bill lied about Lewisnky, HW lies about not raising taxes, Reagan Iran-contra, Carter Iran, Nixon Watergate,  yes I skipped Ford.
@thaetan @jaynordlinger Do you think someone can analyze whether another person made a “good faith” effort with certainty? Intent is extremely difficult to prove, is it based on spending money? Having conversations? The analysis from 538 seems like gobbly gook rather than statistical analysis.
@thaetan @jaynordlinger You didn’t read this article did you? It says that most politicians “try” to keep their promises or make a “good faith” effort to keep their promises. That’s what this analysis concerns, not whether or not they ACTUALLY KEEP their promises.
@JackPosobiec Is Michael Cohen Q?
@rbprattjr @Nymexwti @AC360 @MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh So inept the country’s economy just had its highest growth for a quarter in 4 years? Or so inept that we are in pace for our first year in 10 where we will exceed 3% growth? Ok bro
@jaynordlinger Perhaps it’s because all politicians and all news corps lie, you know what all humans lie. So why should we care that Trump lies instead of operating under the belief that what he says might not be true and we should research the issues ourselves. Self reliance!!!

@l_ecume @seanmdav Don’t get me wrong though, I think my problem is with the stupidity of most people. Only 30% of Americans have a 4 year degree and only 9% have been to graduate school.
@l_ecume @seanmdav Like what? From what I’ve read most of it has not been proven true and Christopher Steele in his court appearances in England has admitted such. Even going so far as to say it’s speculative based on raw intelligence. It was also never meant to go public.
@l_ecume @seanmdav Yes I’d agree here. I think Trunps not an ideologue but rather a pragmatist.
@l_ecume @seanmdav Trudeau is woefully unqualified and only sits as PM because of his father. I’ve watched Trudeau speak in parliament and Andrew Shear and other tear him apart. He can’t argue or speak on a basic level.
@l_ecume @seanmdav I think he speaks at the average level of intelligence of an American citizen. I think he keeps it simple although definitely not coherent. May I recommend watching Nancy Pelosi speak...and I respect your opinion but I think you and I can agree that Trudeau is a clown.
@l_ecume @seanmdav The dossier is fake evidence. But that’s an interesting perspective on your part. If they knocked on your door with a warrant for your arrest would you go along with it or call a lawyer and claim innocence?
@benshapiro It’s a witch hunt as it relates to Russian collusion. Where are those charges? A witch hunt led to how many hundreds or thousands of women being burned or killed and yet how many were proven to be witches? Just because the women were killed doesn’t make them witches. Come on Ben

@l_ecume @seanmdav White like snow? Was this a reference to a movie?
@l_ecume @seanmdav His statements are immaterial because they’re not made under oath. Especially given that he’s in politics there is an understanding that politicians aren’t honest.
@l_ecume @seanmdav You’re not a lawyer are you? I’ve worked with/for judges (in court), graduated from law school, both parents are lawyers and have sat through 7 full trials and spent 3+ years working for firms.
@l_ecume @seanmdav No it didn’t. Please read Steele’s testimony in English courts. Please read Glenn simpsons testimony. This was a political hit job paid for by HRC and the DNC and denied by them for months.

@mattyglesias @jonfavs Thanks for spreading more FAKE NEWS! Please cite a single conservative who has said that we should remove illegal immigrants for traffic violations. Love it when the media attacks Trump for not providing evidence in support and the media does the exact same.

@MarkWarner Exactly! Cohen and Manafort have committed crimes, they should rightfully go to jail. Cohen will also be disbarred. But can you explain how this implicates Russia  and collusion, conspiracy or treason?

@Dee_Marketing @DavidAFrench Yea strange how omarosa claimed to have all these recordings and all the ones she’s provided to the news have been nothing burgers.
@Dee_Marketing @DavidAFrench I don’t, and I don’t understand the relevance. I expect when he uses gov equipment it’s secure. I doubt it’s secure when he’s not using gov equipment. Just exactly like HRC.
@Dee_Marketing @DavidAFrench Gladly. Trump is likely guilty of a federal election crime, which hardly rises to the level of impeachment. HRC our national security at risk, she was protected by a partisan fbi/DOJ And should never have been the dem candidate. Oh and I supported her over BO in 2008
@Dee_Marketing @DavidAFrench I don’t think, I know. We’ve been told through numerous publications, through fbi and DOJ investigations, through Wikileaks, etc. funny how both omarosa and Cohen had no credibility till they opposed or worked against trump lol

If it’s so “logical” why is it that none of the trump campaign staff who were present were charged and why hasn’t the media been able to tell us what was discussed? Your arguments are infantile.
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Maybe you take the word of the media, who according to Ben Rhodes are idiot 27 year olds who wrote what he told them to during the Obama administration...
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Ok but you’d take the word of obama who lied about the cause of Benghazi? Or HRC who lied for months about hiring Fusion GPS? Or Brennan and Clapper who perjured themselves? 🤔
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Hello!!! Look at #2!! Jesus stop trolling and get up to speed.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin What’s that have to do with pragmatism?
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Again none of what you said is evidence lol. 1) the subject matter of the meeting has been disputed by those present. There is no facts to support that claim.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin I don’t understand that comment, pragmatism has nothing to do with the initial response to Rubin’s post.
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin https://t.co/UjbzZVrLXt https://t.co/WeJbJJmWnM
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Rubin’s post emphasized lying, so I referenced 3 prominent members of the last administration who have been caught lying and democrats didn’t show equal outrage. Try to keep up.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin I respect that. I’m about pragmatism rather than idealism. Actions &gt; words
@LiberalBurke @NathanHRubin You don’t want to learn? You prefer to remain ignorant...oh bless your heart. Just look up how clapper and Brennan both denied spying on and collecting metadata on USA citizens only to contradict those assertions a mere few years later. For shame!

@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Hahahaha do you say “what about” every time you don’t like discussing the truth about your party? Is whataboutism all about deflecting from serious conversation that you know paints your party in a bad light?
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin More common ground! I’m also not a fan of JT. Feel like the over 35 crowd isn’t but the more impressionable younglings have been seduced by his good looks lol
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin Didn’t realize you were Canadian. Are you québécois? I have Canadian citizenship, fam is from Montreal. Fan of Trudeau?
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin I wonder if a former Presidents family or a political party’s intended nominee for President has ever been charged. I don’t think she should have been charged for poor security but last time an American ambassador was killed while serving was Carter and now Obama.
@seapara29 @NathanHRubin Would love to. Let’s start with AG Eric Holder taking the 5th for Operation Fast &amp; Furious. Next we can discuss the Obama admin lying about the cause of Benghazi and blaming it on a YouTube video. Perhaps for dessert we can discuss the targeting of conservative charities.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin Then again only HRC is a politician.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin Glad we can find common ground.
@JackPosobiec This is insane. Then again CNN did terrible stuff concerning parkland.
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin I’m sure a Democrat AG would fire the President’s political appointees...😂and we all know they perjured themselves all you need to do is watch the committee open sessions and see how they lied about spying on Americans and collecting American metadata, and they admitted it later
@l_ecume @NathanHRubin Tell me, what medicine does one take when discussing the truth? Did Big Brother tell you what to say?
@NathanHRubin Haha oh you make me laugh. I love how you in the left have created this new term “whataboutism” any time someone challenges you about people who are or have worked for democrats. Where they private citizens when they were running for president, heading the CIA, or DNI?

@CrappyMovies @RepLeeZeldin @andrewcuomo If you compare it to now I agree with you, but that’s not only true of the USA but true of all nations. But if you compare the USA relative to other nations at that time, we have been a great nation for very long. We didn’t destroy Asia like japan, or colonize the world like GB.

@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump How do you ignore this? It’s clear evidence and proof of a common recurring theme among democrats to paint republicans as racists. Your inability to argue makes my job really easy. Though discussing the truth with you is quite frustrating.
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump You wrote that you guys only hated Bush, a lie, also not a proper response to how I said, and have proved with sources, that you also called McCain and Romney racists. Are you insulted? Probably emanates from your 1st response where you told me to STFU...stop being a snowflake
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump The date is in the hyperlink- 8/1/2008...get with the program
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump I’m guessing you didn’t watch the video or read the bottom of the article...otherwise you wouldn’t have posted it.

@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump It’s hilarious how you say such comments without realizing the weak position of your own party. You guys also hated Romney, McCain, Bush like you hate Trump, the problem for you now is not only that he won where Mitt and Mc lost but he’s earning support from minorities.
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Additionally the current democrat party is facing a civil war between far left “progressives” and establishment democrats. Progressives believe the DNC cheated Bernie, and yet you have more senate democrats in red states up for re-election than vice versa.
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump You realize that since 2010 Democrat policies have destroyed the democrat party and led to its weakest position in 96 years? You don’t control the WH, Senste, House, 30 Governors are Republicans, and republicans control the majority of state legislatures.

@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Have you ever heard of dumping And zeroing? These tariffs are necessary because past administration didn’t focus on trade imbalance. Tariffs on our exports prevent those exports from being purchased to protect those nations own industries!
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump No it’s not are you joking?? Obama’s last 5 Qs has GDP growth of 1.6% under Trump it’s been 2.6-2.9%. Inflation will rise because we have a strong economy, it didn’t rise under Obama’s they were held low!
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump The GDP of this country grew at 1.9-2.1% under Ibama! He didn’t have a single year exceeding 3% growth! Are you fucking serious??removing regulations cuts down on fees and time for construction. Under ibama inflation was held at 0% to assist with an artificial economy! Go read!
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Why don’t we talk about how Trump was trying to make peace with North Korea and applaud him for efforts instead of attack them and say they’re doomed for failure. Oh and let’s not forget the loved the Iran deal that got us NOTHING!!

@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Why don’t we talk about how global markets all exceeded expectations and all 13 main industries grew in 2017? How about protecting American interests?
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Morons like you,who are really fascists, and believe some conspiracy theory absent any evidence, are intolerant of others like me. How about the media focusing 3 months on stormy? Or ignoring antifa violence? Or ignoring violence by Palestinians against Israels.
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump How about the fact that it’s easier to gain employment, that he lowered my taxes? How about that he’s opposed unfair trade practices? How about that he’s brought back manufacturing and coal jobs? How about leading from the front? How about serving as a voice and fighting for Rs?
@wuwu_wally @brianklaas @realDonaldTrump How about the press calling trump a liar and focusing on issues for people of the lowest intelligence? How about the press not talking about the achievements of removing regulations? 2nd biggest business confidence, high consumer confidence, removes ACA that lowered insurance, /1

@Skrrrrt_Cobain @IrishAlexTattoo @ESPNFC Same. I bet if we discussed further you’d find out ya trump supporters aren’t the racist, sexist or uneducated people that the news tells you about. Also I used to live up in Chicago, hard to be a democrat when you see how poorly that city treats blacks and other minorities.
@Skrrrrt_Cobain @IrishAlexTattoo @ESPNFC We will have to see, Klopp is a fantastic manager so who knows. Can’t argue how impressive it was getting to the CL final.
@Skrrrrt_Cobain @IrishAlexTattoo @ESPNFC Perhaps, but if you want to challenge City you’re going to need a powerful midfielder and there really isn’t another MF like Naby on Liverpool. And yes they definitely need a better LB but with that front line the kop can score with the best of them.
@Skrrrrt_Cobain @IrishAlexTattoo @ESPNFC Keita provides Liverpool with a dimension they clearly lacked last year. This team is the only true competitor against City for the title this year, unless they lose VVD, Mane or Salah for a decent amount of time.
@Skrrrrt_Cobain @ESPNFC I can agree with this statement. Liverpool would likely still win without Keita whereas Everton would not, but Liverpool were dominant. Also Keita had the solid hockey assist and helped set up some great opportunities, controlled the midfield and the flow was better.
@IrishAlexTattoo @Skrrrrt_Cobain @ESPNFC His goals were good, this isn’t a knock, Keita was simply an orchestrator in both sides of the ball. It wasn’t like I think Keita provided a vastly superior performance. Just thought he was more impressive.

@brianstelter Why don’t you call them ANTIFA! Or left wing domestic terrorists attacking media and cops, calling cops the KKK and want to destroy the USA?

@Robert_Clark7 @PelicansSuperBo @JasonLieser No, I respect their right to protest, in fact I encourage it, even if I think it’s misguided, however I don’t accept that these players need to protest during the national anthem.

@jpwilson117 @Robert_Clark7 @PelicansSuperBo @JasonLieser Only based on how he’s responded to me, not his individual tweet in which we didn’t discuss. But different but I see the irony/hypocrisy of my comments through your lense
@johncrossmirror How lacazette sits on the bench is beyond me. The fact that Auba and Lacazette don’t play together is ridiculous. Auba would be great from the left.

@Robert_Clark7 @PelicansSuperBo @JasonLieser Great, glad we live in a democracy where we don’t have to agree. Glad we don’t live in the world where your king. You don’t have to agree with me, even if it makes me think you’re naive about the world.
@PelicansSuperBo @Robert_Clark7 @JasonLieser You’re trolling me right? Because clearly what you’re saying isn’t educated and strictly speculation in your part. Explain to me why these players can’t protest at a more appropriate time than during the national anthem? Literally I support the protest any time besides then.
@Robert_Clark7 @PelicansSuperBo @JasonLieser Oh I’m far more informed than you think I am, and definitely far more informed than you. It’s actually hilarious that through 4 tweets you think I’m not informed.
@PelicansSuperBo @Robert_Clark7 @JasonLieser No you’re clearly not informed. You must not realize how good people have it living in America compared to every other country in the world.

@thehill A journalist asking candidates running for American office about their support for terrorists and anti-Semitism is considered a “far right activist?”
@Robert_Clark7 @JasonLieser I’m guessing you’re being sarcastic.
@WarmGlassOfSTHU @JasonLieser People like you seem ungrateful and naive.
@JasonLieser Very disappointed in the Dolphins ownership in allowing players to protest during the national anthem. So long as they stand I don’t care if their helmet is on or they raise a fist but not standing is beyond disrespectful.

@GreatKatzby03 @clamence @politicalelle @RealSaavedra @benshapiro What is the “original tweet” that you are referring to? This issue, for conservatives, has been only about her characterization of the calling Ben Shapiro’s tweet as a form of “catcalling.” No one cares that she didn’t/doesn’t debate him.
@GreatKatzby03 @clamence @politicalelle @RealSaavedra @benshapiro I think you’re missing the point, people are attacking her for her calling Ben Shapiro’s comments/demand/request/tweet “catcalling,” which it wasn’t. She played the misogyny card when this Shapiro’s acts were not misogynist at all.
@GreatKatzby03 @clamence @politicalelle @RealSaavedra @benshapiro 1) there was no obligation to debate. 2) she calls Ben Shapiro’s acts “catcalling,” which they aren’t. And catcalling is equated with misogyny, sexism and disrespect, she played this card because she wanted to distract from her lack of substantive knowledge.
