@joaquinlife @evanlweber @collinrees @senatemajldr The fines activists pay are forfiet the ability to contest the charge and close out the case. Bail is what you pay to conditonally be released. Bail is what creates massive inequality.

@JamiahAdams I guess for me is that it takes away from the wins of turning dc into a bail free jurisdiction. They dont have to pay the fine to be released. They are release regardless.
@JamiahAdams I believe bail free is less than ten year old and not in the federal system. But DC local is release or remand til trial. Activists pay fines to avoid dealing with courts. Need orgs to be accurate.

@jesseeohh1 we went to Ft. Benning together I believe!
The Very Serious People in DC need to the have the courage to demand Abrams be fired, and that career folks not Trumpies guide our work on VZ. The people of VZ need a real ally not folks tainted by war crimes who are itching for more conflict.
Read about Ft. Benning and the annual protest weekend there during the 90‚Äôs and the 00‚Äôs. Read about Saint Oscar Romero. Read about the nuns.
Yall need to read about the School of the Americas. You need to read the names of the humans murdered in Latin America. You need to understand our role in enabling catastrophe after catastrophe. And ask- why is a man like Abrams back?
Many of the organizers in the 35-45 age cohort became involved in justice work via the work to close of the School of the Americas. And to see Eliott Abrams lauded and put back in power is a counter point to the idea of the Moral Arc of the Universe bending to justice.
El Mazote. This needs to be asked about Eliott Abrams as he drops into Colombia. And anyone in foreign policy elite needs to be asked why do they respect a man like him.

Good to know @CoryBooker is on for debt free college. Let‚Äôs get him on for tuition free college, too!!! #jerseypride https://t.co/zR0hdVBchk
@jeffgiertz I did not know that!! And ive asked!!! Now let‚Äôs get him on tuition free college:) thank you!
Free college will be a key factor for most Dem primary voters. Folks can‚Äôt save for their kids college.  Worried about grand kids. Paying back loans. Get with the future, or get used to not winning.
Well, I am definitely not for @amyklobuchar.  Good thing we have real progressives running like @JulianCastro @KamalaHarris @ewarren who will work for versions of free college. (At least with Kamala it‚Äôs arguing over details, not committment!) I hope @CoryBooker joins the team! https://t.co/m5XR1s1QWp

Y‚Äôall: Sure back in 2012‚Äìit was maybe okay to limit student debt talk to interest rates. But 7 years later, if you are focused on refi, you are missing the pain of student debt. Hire cutting edge advocates. Fire folks who refuse to truly listen to the pain of this crisis.

@CalCourtKy @HoarseWisperer I am!! My anger was Katha showing up and pushing college down the priority list.

Both women who were harmed by Fairfax deserve privacy and their normal lives. The best for this to happen is for @LGJustinFairfax to resign and ask through their lawyers how to make amends.
The only reason we had to make the Kavanaugh moment was because he refuses to quit and the Republicans refused to take sexual assault as a disqualifer for being on SCOTUS.
So Im seeing folks who don‚Äôt do work with survivors of sexual assault saying we need to make the Fairfax moment like the Kavanaugh moment. I couldn‚Äôt disagree more.
What did Fairfax‚Äôs fundraisers do in 2016 when the rape allegation was made? Did they share with @vademocrats? Did they share with Fairfax? Did Fairfax tell anyone?

@jennpozner @SenSanders @staceyabrams Super frustrating that folks are likely sharing the false hill tweet in DM group. Bernie is speaking to his own social channels after Stacey speaks and after sharing her speech. The Hill presented this very differently than what it is.

@NelStamp Its not at the same time. Its after she speaks. . Folks who hate Bernie are pushing that lie. https://t.co/9KV3CKxFhW
@Zac_Petkanas He will. But folks assume the worst. Because this is the age we live in.
I hope all electeds do a live after Stacey‚Äôs response. It‚Äôs how we win. Everyone should echo her message, drive engagement, inspire their teams to fight.  We have to win. There is no other choice.
But honestly, it‚Äôs literally just about fighting Trump. And everyone at everyone moment should be building to fight Trump.
Some folks who just hate Bernie are gonna hate. I get that. And other folks might not know this is an annual strategy to continue engagement to fighting Trump. Totally get that.
It‚Äôs the literal job of electeds to lead and meet people where they are. Folks are online and follow electeds on social platforms. Talking to them creates more engagement. More engagement means more folks fighting Trump.
My question as an organizer‚Äîis why aren‚Äôt all the electeds after @staceyabrams gives an amazing speech aren‚Äôt engaging the people who follow them on social? Folks are acting like doing a fb live is some fancy or bold. It‚Äôs actually quite basic.
@Zac_Petkanas It‚Äôs not undercutting. It‚Äôs engaging 2M people who are listening to get them fighting Trump more. Why isn‚Äôt every Dem elected using their digital power to stop Trump at key moments?

@DougHenwood Smart idea
@KZambon @ParkerMolloy It was in her speech. She used debt free.
From there, we need a national convo on youth housing in general because on campus for students or in community for youth workers‚Äîthere is an affordability crisis.
Pell Grants and other means tested aid should then be used for housing or living expenses.
Other orgs/think tanks started to push ‚Äúdebt free college‚Äù as opposed to free college. Thankfully, tuition free college has become the best version. Because tuition+fees should be free for all as FIRST DOLLAR.
Hi All. Im the one who pushed the debt free frame into the debate around higher ed back in 2012. Idea was to create a path out of for current folks with student loan debt. Intent wasn‚Äôt about cobbling together means tested programs for future students.
@DMansini It doesnt tho. As one the people who pushed the debt free frame in 2012 as a means to deal with student debt holders, the idea was never to just tweak affordability around means tests.
@ParkerMolloy @7im it‚Äôs not a stretch. It‚Äôs the difference between a universal free public college or a weird means tested approach focused just on loans not cost. Im disappointed to see the rhetorical shift.

@johnbrougher Hmu on email!!! We are friends IRL!!! Im just cranky about folks who mean for sake of being mean.
@MGalvanPHL You are just being mean. So if you want to actually talk lets get a coffee.
Are folks really used to organizing being based in fakeness and not wrestling with conflict and values? I think this could be part of the huge division.
@MGalvanPHL You must have been in terrible coalitions that are based on bullshit and not in coalitions that wrestle with all the things. Im sorry for your experiences.
@MGalvanPHL Thats why you build a multi racial coaliton
@MGalvanPHL You get that it‚Äôs economics that enables a lot of systematic racism. They are twined together. So really you are the one who will never tackle systematic racism. Just be honest.
@MGalvanPHL You are reading it into it find the hate you want. Just admit that you are okay if people from all back grounds never truly get justice.
@MGalvanPHL There was no derison. What part of building a mult racial coalition is derison? https://t.co/3EjTZhhDik
