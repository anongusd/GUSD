"The irony wasn‚Äôt lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly	criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades."
Cohen just now testifying: "When I say conman, I‚Äôm talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores."
"As you are again no doubt aware, this notice applies to any and all of The College Board's employees, agents, third parties, vendors and any other person or entity acting for or on its behalf."
"If in the event any of his records are released or otherwise disclosed without his prior written consent, we will hold your institution liable to the fullest extent of the law including damages and criminality."
You can find Exhibit 6 here, and see that Cohen argues the release of Trump's SAT scores would be a violation of #FERPA: https://t.co/4J5pRcXF9x
Here's more: "As I mentioned, I‚Äôm giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump‚Äôs direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump‚Äôs grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission." https://t.co/91ObdhHYNC

‚òùüèº That‚Äôs a quote in my story from @AryAmerikaner. I couldn‚Äôt put ‚Äú‚Äù around it bc Twitter. But it‚Äôs the heart of the issue here.
What we should be recognizing is that school systems have been set up ‚Äì in many cases very intentionally ‚Äì to repress students, families and communities of color. And if today they're not intentionally doing that, they are certainly continuing to do that by under-resourcing them.
But inequities don't only occur based on poverty. The report shows how income is a bad proxy for race. Despite attempts to distribute K-12 funding more equitably based on income, massive funding disparities still exist when examining the racial makeup of those receiving it.
Ed funding inequities have historically been debated, challenged and litigated through the lens of income status and class ‚Äì meaning that policymakers have long sought to channel funds toward poorer areas with less regard to racial demographics in those neighborhoods.
That‚Äôs the top finding in the new @EdBuild report that‚Äôs going to spark A LOT of debate: https://t.co/xfdvWe4haO

Booker in 2016 speaking to @SchoolChoiceNow: ‚ÄúThis fight is so critical and so essential to who we say we are as a country." Booker 8 months later voting against DeVos as ed sec: ‚Äú[she] has been silent on the issues that are so critical to this country being who we say we are."
So the question is whether Booker can be ‚Äúboth and,‚Äù as many of his supporters describe him ‚Äî can he embrace the school choice ed agenda that he credits with his swift ascent to national politics and connect with the thousands of teachers who‚Äôve walked picket lines lately.
Booker remains unapologetic for and proud of the Newark experiment. Aside from DeVos, the problem it presents for him is that this election is set against a backdrop of educator unrest in which teachers are striking against many of the ed reforms Booker has embraced.
And that‚Äôs exactly what Booker faced in 2006 when he was elected mayor of Newark, a city where the school system had been failing kids for generations. The answer for Booker was to lean in on the early mentoring he received from @SchoolChoiceNow.
The conflict stands between how to give poor students of color trapped in failing schools a better education ‚Äì the answer to which over the last decade has been to try to give them choices other than traditional public school ‚Äì and how to protect their civil rights.
The education philosophy of Booker is a complex one and highlights many of the most complicated and pressing K-12 debates of the moment, chief among them, the tension ignited inside the school choice movement by the Trump administration and DeVos.
Can Cory Booker outrun his intimate ties to DeVos and school choice in his 2020 presidential election bid? Does he even want to? https://t.co/yP0VJTB6zX

Notably, the new charter school would be allowed to operate independently of the school district, just as charter schools do.
Under the agreement, the city would reconfigure its school boundaries, creating a neighborhood zone specifically for the new charter school. Enrollment would not be through a lottery. Only students who live in the newly drawn zone would be allowed to enroll.
In what looks to be the first of its kind anywhere in the country, a brokered agreement between MA ed commissioner, mayor of New Bedford and a charter school would allow the school to open a new campus so long as it enrolls students like a traditional neighborhood school.
Notably, 98 percent of the union's members voted to authorize the strike, which can only end if they vote to ratify the tentative agreement. Plans are for them to do so by the end of the day today.
The deal includes 6 percent salary increase, enough funding to reduce classes and hire support staff, like nurses, school counselors and librarians. The agreement would also boost support for special education and address concerns with standardized testing and charter schools.
The two sides had been sparring over issues including pay, class size, testing and charter schools. Union officials had demanded a 6.5 percent raise plus one year of retroactive pay.
City and school officials in LA reached a tentative labor agreement with union reps to bring to a close a six-day strike in which tens of thousands of teachers walked the picket line in the country's second-largest school district. https://t.co/DHtg4Ui9l7

Lots of questions to consider...
But without a similar proxy school officials are going to have a tough time trying to their count validated. And moreover, what happens when we can't compare how poor students in one state or city are doing compared to another because they all use different counts?
The original purpose of using FRPL as a proxy for poverty was so that schools didn't have to waste time and $ doing this legwork. Sure, it was never 100 percent accurate. As one person told me, principals had to pound the pavement to ensure all students who qualified enrolled.
Many students there have multiple names, spelled in a variety of ways. School admins don't know what spelling parents use on forms for govt benefit programs. That means staff are having to enter all possible variations of students' names to ensure it registers in the system.
One example I'd like to share: A K-8 school that serves lots of ELL students, where about 80 percent of students were considered poor based on FRPL, but now using direct certification that count has dropped to about 60 percent. School officials there are having a rough go.
Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond to this story and share the complexities and struggles at your specific schools. I heard from school administrators around the country, all of whom are trying to navigate this new reality.

Lockdowns save lives during real attacks, but even when there is no gunman stalking the hallways, the procedures can inflict immense psychological damage on children convinced that they‚Äôre in danger. And the number of kids who have experienced these ordeals is extraordinary.
School shootings remain rare, even after 2018, a year of historic carnage on K-12 campuses. What‚Äôs not rare are lockdowns, which have become a hallmark of American education and a byproduct of this country‚Äôs inability to curb its gun violence epidemic.
The number of students affected eclipsed the populations of Maine, Rhode Island, Delaware and Vermont combined. But the total figure is likely much higher because many school districts ‚Äî including in Detroit and Chicago ‚Äî do not track them and hundreds never make the news
More than 4.1 million students endured at least one lockdown in the 2017-18 school year, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis by WaPo that included a review of 20,000 news stories and data from school districts in 31 of the country‚Äôs largest cities. https://t.co/OtiyRWAC20

In many ways, admissions officers and college counselors say, it‚Äôs not so different than the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, in which priests quietly moved from parish to parish.
Most colleges and universities state in their qualifications for admission that a student seeking to transfer in must be in ‚Äúgood standing‚Äù with their current or former school. But good standing could mean any number of things, and students can always skirt the issue.
When it comes to a school‚Äôs responsibility for a student who has been expelled or received a disciplinary violation and is looking to transfer to a different school, it becomes even more difficult.
Some colleges and universities ask prospective students to disclose disciplinary violations only after they‚Äôve already been accepted.
But some colleges don‚Äôt consider disciplinary actions at all. Depending on the high school, especially those with large graduating classes, a college counselor may not even know that a disciplinary action was issued, especially if it‚Äôs an incident that occurred outside of school.
As it stands, the Common Application, which is used by more than 700 colleges and universities to consider prospective students, requires applicants to check a box if they‚Äôve been suspended, expelled or disciplined.

RT @pdkintl: The public has pretty clear ideas about what would make schools safer for students: for starters, mental health screening. See‚Ä¶
And then there‚Äôs the largely unregulated process for providing important disciplinary information on the back end about students seeking to transfer. (See recent case of UT Dallass accepting former Baylor student w/o knowing he was under investigation for alleged rape.)
At issue is a complicated patchwork of state-specific, high school-specific and college-specific policies surrounding what types of disciplinary actions are so severe that they warrant notifying admissions officers.

6. Increasing funding for mental health initiatives and hire more therapists so that students regularly have access to them*
5. Beefing up security by installing, for example, better perimeter fencing and stronger glass windows
4. Increasing funding to hire more school resource officers and building better relationships with local law enforcement*
3. Passing "extreme-risk protection orders," which allow law enforcement to temporarily take away a weapon from an individual deemed dangerous to himself or others and also prevents those individuals from temporarily purchasing a weapon
2. Arming ‚Äúwell-trained‚Äù school personnel, especially in rural areas

One caveat, student test scores tend to drop:  Based on one researcher's model of how large-scale job loss impacts test scores, when GM's 1,600-worker Lordstown, Ohio, plant closes, the share of students who score proficient on  state exam will decrease by 2.5 percentage points.
However, community-wide job loss also triggers some positive behaviors: research shows that students don't get self-destructive, drug use goes down, risky sexual behavior goes down, and students are more likely to take college prep classes.
Communities impacted by the announced layoffs need to prepare for a mental health crisis among their young people, including increases in anxiety, depression and even suicide, experts say.
"In some ways, the closures are different than a hurricane, but in some ways they aren't. It comes in and hits a community. It affects everyone and it effects your understanding of what you can count on for the future, as well as being an immediate strain on resources."

So far, DeVos has not commented on the incident in Baraboo and has not signaled whether she‚Äôll task OCR to investigate.
When it comes to federal action, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights could offer technical assistance to the school to navigate appropriate next steps, open a directed investigation or a compliance review to proactively investigate the situation.
Baraboo school officials and authorities are investigating, and the community is holding meeting and listening sessions to address the issue. But changing culture is hard, education experts say, and often requires a wholesale restart.
In fact, the photo surfaced just a day before the FBI released new data showing that hate crimes in K-12 schools and colleges increased by 25 percent in 2017.
The uptick in racist, anti-Semitic and hate-related incidents among young people is a narrative that has both alarmed civil rights advocates and one that's repeated with such frequency that it's also lulled some into complacency.

@esanzi I don't know enough to answer those questions. Sorry. More than anything I was struck by the dichotomy in the comments sections between the students' reaction on others.
Really, what I'm getting at is this: Is this a story I should write? And because I can't decide whether this is a story, I'll let you make the call for me:
And in doing so perhaps worsening the fiscal landscape in poorer school districts that can‚Äôt afford to increase K12 spending?
Of course, local school districts have every right to spend more on education if they want to, thus one of the main pillars of education inequality. But, are local districts who spend more letting states off the hook for their job?
So now I have a lot of questions: Some wealthy districts are pouring more into their K12 systems. Ok, so is this tipping the scale of state v local K12 spending?
At first I thought, Is this just happening in mostly wealthy, Blue states? But it's not. By my count, it's happening in Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Nebraska (see above). I imagine there may be instances of this in almost every state.
Boy was I wrong. There are some school districts, take Nebraska, for example, where local funding accounts for upward of 90% of a school budget.
So I've been poking around on a tangential issue here: School districts where local dollars account for a larger share of the K12 budget than state dollars. I was always under the impression that it was split pretty evenly, with states funding slightly more, 47% v 45%. https://t.co/s0n4pJUY2E

@esanzi It seems to be last spring, before prom. I haven't personally corroborated that. That's what AP and others are reporting. Apparently, it's the class of 2019.
Finally, I'll be really interested to see how school leaders tackle this. On its face it's so blatantly wrong, disturbing, etc. But the discipline and healing that go along with this is such a gray area. Some districts rise to occasion an others slink away from it.
One superintendent's take: ‚ÄúOur policy is very specific as to if there is off-campus activity that has a direct nexus back to school or has an in impact on the educational day, then we have every right to step in an investigate an issue and apply consequences if appropriate.‚Äù
Among other things, school officials are obligated to take into consideration constitutional rights, federal law, state law, myriad state and federal regulations, as well as local policy.

I should add, in case anyone is wondering, I do enjoy a good green bean casserole. And of course, I'm sure Dorkas' recipe doesn't taste anything like wet cigarettes. This was clearly as case of ingredients gone bad.
So godspeed to you, GBC inventor. Thank you for one really great belly laugh and a lasting memory.
5/ Maybe you had be there, but it was funny for two reasons: (1) They did sorta taste like wet cigarettes, even though I've never actually tried one of those. And (2) the person who made them was obviously at the party, and as it turned out, sitting directly across from her.
4/ One year, after we had all helped ourselves to too much beaujolais, one of our friends took a bite of green bean casserole and, clearly disgusted, she exclaimed rather loudly, "These taste like wet cigarettes!"
3/ The rules were simple: Bring a side dish or dessert, a bottle of wine (or two or three) and a good toast of gratefulness to share with everyone around the table.
2/ Before my husband was my husband and we had two very small children, we used to host a rather riotous Friendsgiving for our ragtag group of friends, some of whom would travel from as far away California to attend.

Read the story for more!
It spent $9.7 million total on education expenses during fiscal 2018. But to meet the average education spending per pupil in public schools, which is $11,762, according to the U.S. Census, Southwest Key would have had to spend $63.5 million‚Äînearly seven times what it spent.
One example: Southwest Key Programs has raked in more than $1.2 billion since 2015. It runs 26 shelters across Arizona, California and Texas that provide care for about 5,400 children.
The broad picture painted by conversations with a handful of these shelters is that they genuinely have the children's best interest at heart. But there exists an astonishing lack of accountability over how dollars are being spent and whether children receive a good education.
The shelters themselves range in size, with some serving thousands of children at one facility and others operating as mom and pop-type facilities that handle a dozen or so children at a time and might specialize in providing therapy for those suffering from traumatic experiences
The organizations receiving federal contracts to run shelters include everything from faith-based charitable organizations, like Catholic Charities, to organizations that specialize in detainment centers and prisons, like the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Detention Home.
But it's unclear what that education looks like, who is providing it, how much it costs, whether there are proper supports in place for children with disabilities and those working through traumatic experiences, and who, if anyone, is overseeing it all.
Federal regulations state that children in the care of HHS must receive six hours of instruction every weekday, making education the single biggest part of their daily lives.
What I found is that the government is awarding billions in contracts to organizations responsible for educating thousands of detained migrant children under a complicated patchwork of procedures and policies that are subject to limited oversight and even less transparency.
I‚Äôm grateful to those who did share their stories because it helps us all understand better how the U.S. is caring for these vulnerable children.
Most of those organizations told me that they‚Äôd been directed by HHS not to answer any questions related to the care of unaccompanied migrant children. But HHS also wouldn‚Äôt answer questions and declined my request for an interview with anyone.
I called the 38 organizations awarded the most money in federal contracts to provide shelter and care to young migrants through the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program to see how they‚Äôre providing education to children there. This is what I found: https://t.co/orkaAZFXi9

We have to acknowledge there are fewer and fewer traditional higher ed students today," she says, adding that students of today will likely have a dozen or more jobs in their lifetime.
DeVos says high schools much do more to introduce students to the wide variety of careers that exist and embrace apprenticeship models and other programs that help students graduate high school with career or tech certificates. #RISE2018
DeVos on higher ed: "The whole question of what is higher ed is a relevant one today. For too long we have sent the subtle or not so subtle message that the only way to succeed as a result is to go to a 4 year university."
DeVos repeats comparison of U.S. standings in the Olympics to its standing in the world on math: We just came in fourth in the winter Olympics and I hear people outraged out this. I don't hear people being outraged about the fact that we're 40th in math.
DeVos: FL "demonstrated that not only students at the top end of the performance scale but also those at the bottom of the performance scale improved. I would argue it‚Äôs bc they really have been very intentional about these student centered reforms and they‚Äôve stuck with them."
"This is a model for other states to look at and emulate."
DeVos touts Florida's academic gains. FL was the only state in NAEP to post significant increases in math and reading scores. DeVos highlights the various ed reforms they've implemented since the late 90s. #RISE2018
DeVos on academic gains and per-pupil spending: "Scores continuing to muddle along, unremarkable as was stated in many different places this week. This is not something we are going to spend our way out of and its not something we‚Äôre going to regulate our way out of."
DeVos: The hardest challenge is trying to help people understand how much we need to change. We know that the forces of the status quo don‚Äôt want to do that. We know that the way we‚Äôve done things simply isn‚Äôt working for too many students. We need to see things done differently.

It's no wonder then, that so many in the ed space are worried about what the results could mean for their state's standing and the trajectory of education policy across the country, despite education researchers' best attempts to caution against making causal claims.
Results also come at a time when ed reform initiatives of the last decade are slowing down, in part because so much of it was tied to the previous administration and also bc ESSA hands so much authority back to states and local schools districts to set their own agendas.
NAEP scores are coming tomorrow and this year the jockeying began as early ever, prompted by anxiety over the fact that this year's results reflect the first time the tests were administered to students digitally, via a tablet.
The results can have a big impact on whether states and school districts and those who set education policy from afar in Washington, D.C. stay the course or embrace a new education philosophy: https://t.co/jCXQBk6f8R #NAEP #naep2018

So who is attracted to a job where the failure rate soars above that of even incremental success? Turns out, a shrinking number of people. Big-city superintendent positions, which used to draw anywhere from 50 to 100 applicants, are now lucky to receive 10 to 20.
The number of openings isn't out of the normal range, but the high-profile nature of them is striking: three of the top 10 biggest school districts in the country, and two, Washington and Newark, where the politics of education reform efforts often make national headlines.
About a dozen cities are jockeying to woo an ever-shrinking pool of qualified candidates for a demanding job that requires one part managerial skills, one part political savvy and one part education-policy acumen for a tenure that, on average, lasts barely more than three years.
The annual school superintendent hunting season is open: https://t.co/7Irnb8nhzC

Follow-up on this from @repmarkpocan: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think any school that wouldn‚Äôt let the secretary of education in shouldn‚Äôt get a single penny of money if federal dollars are involved, if they wouldn‚Äôt let you into their schools?"
@nhannahjones @EricaLG But to your point, clearly, the latter hasn't occurred. Or if it has and we don't know about it, it hasn't changed her tune.
@nhannahjones @EricaLG After that happened, there were two main responses by leaders in those schools: Those who rejected her wholesale, and those who said, My god, she has no idea what we do and we need to get her in these schools to change that.
@nhannahjones @EricaLG True, and we saw that with her very first school visit in D.C., where she was physically blocked from entering the school. (She eventually got in through a different door.)
DeVos says first school safety commission hearing will be held next two weeks. The commission is comprised of four cabinet secretaries: ED, HHS, Justice, Homeland Security. "We will be inviting and having forums with a wide variety of experts across the country."
I'm curious whether DeVos is saying here that she doesn't visit low-performing schools because her requests to visit have been turned down, or whether she just feels unwelcome in those schools. Both answers would be interesting.
DeVos says she thinks it would probably be wise her her to begin visiting low-performing schools. "The question is, would they let me in," she says.

"While the Trump administration‚Äôs proposal provides coverage on several fronts, it leaves a gaping hole in addressing civilian access to weapons of war and offers solutions that could put more children in harm‚Äôs way."
They also note: "Ironically, the proposed funding surge to 'harden' schools coincides with the president‚Äôs proposed elimination of student wellness services under Title IV of the Every Student Succeeds Act."
"Putting more guns in our classrooms in the hands of anyone other than trained law enforcement officials and school resource officers will leave our schools more susceptible to accidents and violence rather than safer from it."
School principals @NASSP react to Trump's school safety plans: "Their proposal to arm teachers and other school personnel is entirely misguided and dangerous."

"Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won‚Äôt pass muster around kitchen tables.
Other plans look as though they were just written to get good grades from D.C. interest groups. Still other plans seem like they were written only for one purpose: compliance. Let me be clear: just because a plan complies with the law doesn‚Äôt mean it does what‚Äôs best for students
"This law gives you that chance. The trouble is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt see much evidence that you‚Äôve yet seized it. ... Some have said that they didn‚Äôt write their plans ‚Äúto win an ESSA competition.‚Äù
"We won‚Äôt weaponize waivers to compel you to adopt this administration‚Äôs politics. If we wanted to dictate from D.C., I‚Äôd claim the mantle of our nation‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice chief‚Äù and reject plans because they don‚Äôt give parents more quality choices. But I haven‚Äôt done that. And I won‚Äôt."
"For too long, many of you have operated ‚Äì and in many cases, been forced to operate -- as if your work was only accountable to folks in my office. As if all that mattered in education was a sign-off from Washington. "
"I have refrained from expressing my opinion, thus far, out of respect for the process. But since we‚Äôre all in this room together now, I couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity to share some candid thoughts. Around my house, we call it ‚Äútough love.‚Äù

"These teachers love their students and the students love their teachers in many cases. And these teachers are talented w weaponry and gun. I would rather have someone who loves their students" armed than a security guard standing outside.
"I'm not talking about teachers. i don't want a person who's never handled a gun, who doesn't know what a gun looks like to be armed. but out of your teaching population you have ... gun adept people. They teach."
On arming school staff: There are "people that are adept at weaponry and guns. They teach. I don't want to have 100 guards standing w rifles all over the school. we do a conceal carry permit. and this would be a major deterrent bc these people are major cowards."
Trump at #CPAC18: "It's time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers. we don't want them in our schools. when we declare our schools to be gun-free zones it just puts our students in far more danger."

Supporters say the effort is nothing more than a long-overdue return of local control, but opponents warn it could propel the resegregation of schools.
The process sets up what could result as soon as this summer in NC becoming the 31st state to allow school district secessions ‚Äì a mechanism by which some wealthy, white communities have been quietly peeling away from socio-economically and racially diverse school districts.

Security issues have been a concern for DeVos, but FWIW, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has one of the most open and transparent public schedules in the entire Trump administration.
Of note: There's no guidance, regs or laws requiring secretaries to publicly post schedules. Each agency goes about doing so in a different way, some providing extensive info abt each day's events, including who the secretary is meeting w/ and where the meeting will take place.
"It's hard in today's age to say you're unaware that this is something that people want to know," says @SarcasmSean . "To not be posting it, or to be posting it with very little information, does seem to be almost a conscious decision to withhold information."

Some background: Last year, a judge ruled that Gardendale could partially secede, despite finding that "race was a motivating factor." The ruling garnered national attention because of a standing desegregation order the county has been under since 1965.
