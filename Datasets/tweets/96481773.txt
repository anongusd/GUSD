@HistoryofWrest 7.5. Worst Rooster/Honky or Anvil/Brawler. Best was probably the tag match. There's a Powers of Pain/Rockers matchup on one of the old Coliseum Videos that's just a great example of a big power team versus a smaller high flying team. Good stuff.
@HistoryofWrest 6.5. Best match obviously Shawn/Bret, which pretty much carries the card. Martel/Santana probably pretty good as well. Worst probably Crush/Kato.

@HistoryofWrest I stand corrected, that's not the Glamour Girls. And that's the worst match.
@HistoryofWrest Yikes. If I'm reading that correctly, that's a 1 rating right there. Worst match is a 3-way tie with Patera, Rose and the Glamour Girls. Not sure who Nick de Carlo is, but I'm assuming Heenan bumped like hell for him so that's probably the most interesting (best?) match.

@BoKnowsNews @AndyRichter Good response. She's not playing and I'm all for it.
@HistoryofWrest 7.5. 		Best: DeBiase &amp; Prefect vs Piper &amp; Tornado. Worst: Saba Simba/Bravo. 		Great card considering no Hogan, Savage, or Warrior. Must have been the B show. When was this? Late '90 early '91?

@kevinh07 Where are you from?
@kevinh07 Do you like dogs?
@kevinh07 What's your favorite childhood memory?
@kevinh07 It seems to me you have a lot of talking points and trigger phrases. Instead of just dismissing you as a pretty obvious troll, I'd like to try to get to know you. What's your favorite food?
@kevinh07 Not sure what any of that has to do with what we're talking about. I'm talking about a specific  event in a person's life changing their views on something. You're taking about vague generalizations.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Did you get your license and training in response to a life event?
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Seriuosly, I'm having trouble following  your thought process here.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla I'm honestly flummoxed as to what that has to do with the baseball shooting.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla How so? Did a Muslim murder you?
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Interesting that you would ask that seemingly completely unrelated question. I'm wondering what that has to do with politicians changing or not changing their position on gun rights/control.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Have you ever had a major life event? Did it change your way of thinking about things?
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Sometimes people change their outlook on things after major life events. Sometimes they don't. They may become more galvanized in their opinions or they may see things from a different point of view.
@davidhldunn @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Ok. And? How does that have anything to do with how the people who were actually shot at (republican politicians)approach their job ?
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla It was an observation on human behavior.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla My point was my point. I am surprised the politicians affected did not outwardly change their approach to gun violence in our country. Sometimes people say exactly what they mean with no hidden messages.
@kevinh07 @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Oh guns are shooting themselves now? I thought the old mantra was guns don't shoot people. 	Properly trained and designated people saved them. Using guns that they were properly trained and designated to use. After serious background checks.
@dave_onion @byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Left? Right? Center? I don't care. Regardless of the orientation of the man's wings, I guess I just figured there would be a little more discussion from the affected politicians about keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of "nutjobs."
@byrdinator @StevenTDennis @KateNocera @LissandraVilla Still baffles me that this was not a turning point in the way our elected officials approach guns in this country. Sometimes I have to double check that it actually happened. No one ever seems to even talk about it.

Shit. Did Balor get Joe with that chainsaw?
@demolition4hof Maybe a Team Canada reunion since EY is available too. Bring Petey Williams for that cruiserweight tourney.
@demolition4hof No argument there. Lots of tough spots tonight. Not fair for Aries to debut like that either.
@demolition4hof I find it believable that Asuka could beat half the men on the main roster.
@demolition4hof I love Bayley. Everyone loves Bayley, but that's Asuka.
@demolition4hof Bayley got a legitimate old school babyface reaction when she was in that Asukalock. Don't see that much anymore.

@demolition4hof Or Dalton Castle and Asuka?
@demolition4hof Also went to ECW where he threatened to give everyone The Clap.
@demolition4hof Scotty Riggs. Indeed in the flock after Raven "blinded" him by drop toeholding him onto a chair.
@demolition4hof Plus they both had dropkicks that were ON POINT.
@demolition4hof Actually, I always thought Riggs was pretty good. Plus Buff had a lot of potential.
@demolition4hof Or American Males/Blue Bloods, right?
@knowsknothing I know better and I expect better from myself. You deserve better from me. Again, I apologize.

Now that I think about it, it could have been Sick Boy.
And he said he got Perfect to sign a dollar bill for him. But he didn't know who Saturn was, so I had to figure it out for him.
Or that time my friend said he met Curt Hennig and Saturn at a gas station in Mankato before That Nitro in 97.

@mjgeiger128 Creative didn't think his idea for temporary tattoos would sell as well as the replica masks.
@mjgeiger128 He went back under the mask because of the facial tattoos he used to cover up the scars from the surgery.
@mjgeiger128 The reason he didn't debut in WWE until 2002 is because Vince demanded he have them removed. He needed time to heal.
@HEELZiggler Favorite member of the Natural Born Thrillers? #AskTheHeel

@demolition4hof She should have dropped the old perv right there.
@demolition4hof As it should. Becky's the best active wrestler in the world today.

@knowsknothing Thanks for reminding me of yet another reason I am so glad I don't live in Iowa.
@jenipear @Russostrib And December.
@jenipear You want me to get him?
@AshleyRobertsTV Read that as Presidential instead of Prudential and thought the election just got that much more interesting.
Option is still there to keep Reigns strong by having him beat New Day 3-on-1 to regain title and headline WM vs Lesnar.
Much debate could be had as to whether the Freebird (LayCool?) Rule applies to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.
Predictable finishes have long been the major knock against the Rumble. A surpise would help rekindle interest in this cornerstone event.
Reigns can't beat everyone from the No. 1 position.
New Day is hottest act in the company.
Rumble is always Kofi's time to shine.
Been doing some thinking. Come to the conclusion that the only result that would make sense is for @TrueKofi to win the 2016 Royal Rumble.

@TheQueenHEEL Kevin Kelly and King Corino shouted OOOOOHHHH! a lot. And WOOOOOAAAHH! Oh, and SUUUPERKIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!
This is a good ppv, but my feed is jumping around so much I feel like I  missed half the match. #ASE7 #RingofHonor

If Wade Barrett doesn't leave #EliminationChamber with the Intercontinental Championship...someone else will have won this match.
@jerwild9 As they've done sooooo many times before and will continue to do. (See also Zach Ryder, Cesaro, even Fandango)
@jerwild9 I thought you were going to say YJ Stinger. I was going to ask for a picture.
@jerwild9 Around that time. Also hated that he beat Jeircho and Christian in a triple threat.
@jerwild9 I remember being so sick of him back in '05/'06, but he has really grown on me.
If people still hate John Cena after what he's done since Wrestlemania, they probably ought to reevaluate their lives. #EliminationChamber
@Jackstandsup nice
It's like the old saying goes, "There's a thin line between a piledriver and a powerbomb." #EliminationChamber
I love what they're doing with Cena lately, but the AA is slowly becoming as credible a finisher as the Figure Four. #EliminationChamber

Everything about the "Pop News" segment on Good Morning America is making me feel like an angry old man. And I'm OK with that.
@jenipear Thanks for not demanding I mute it again now that Lawler is on.
@knowsknothing Sometimes the little things stand out most. That's why I like Regal so much. He always made sure to do the little things.
Now watching RVD and Al Snow on mute thanks to "The Most Admired Man In Wrestling" and his wonderful whistle. #WWENetwork #HardcoreHeaven97
Watching Bam Bam Bigelow destroy Spike Dudley from #HardcoreHeaven1997 on #WWENetwork. Both of these guys were so good at what they did.
@jenipear Hard at work as always. :-)
@mjgeiger128 Just seems like a lot of focus on a guy who was really only there for the one program.
I wonder if they were planning on doing more stuff with that Piper impersonator. #KingoftheRing1994
@mjgeiger128 I will say, both Piper and Lawler look to be in the best shape I have ever seen them for this match. #KingoftheRing1994
Not sure the entrances of the Lawler/Piper match was the best place for Gorilla to stress this is the NEW WWF generation. #KingoftheRing1994
I like the buildup to the Piper/Lawler match, it was unique. I've heard the match is not good, but I'll go in with an open mind.
Back to #KingoftheRing1994 and it has gotten to the point where Gorilla and Macho are just ignoring poor Art Donovan. #awkward

@jenipear WE GO PAAAAAAAAARK!
Uhoh. "PARK TIME!" Guess that means I'll have to finish this later.
@knowsknothing He seemed like he legitimately enjoyed the business. Not sure about him as a Horseman, but otherwise I kind of liked him.
@knowsknothing His asking who Shawn Michaels is tells me he put zero effort into prep. Sometimes celebrity involvement doesn't really work.
I didn't think it would close the show, but I'm surprised the title match is so early. #KingoftheRing1994
I had the same style lamp that Gorilla is using on my nightstand as a kid. I would think they could light the arena a little better.
@knowsknothing At least they were smart enough to never put Rob Bartlett on a PPV.
@knowsknothing yup. He's also very concerned about how much they're getting hurt. I don't think anyone smartened him up to how things work.
If I were to make a top 10 list of the best guys to never hold the WWWFE world title, 4 or 5 would be in this tournament. #KingoftheRing1994
If I were i charge of WWE for a year, bringing the King of the Ring back would be one of my top priorities.

@knowsknothing I've never seen this, but from what I've heard, that's most of the event.

@Matt_Striker_ Awesome!  But how did you fit every Malenko match on one tape? I don't think I've ever seen a bad one.
@LaVelleNeal ugh
@justinjelinek @AndyCarlsonShow Mitch Berger?
@knowsknothing @jenipear I think they show it like three times a weekend in this market. Now, 1 am Monday and randomly Sunday mornings.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Here I was all set to go to sleep, but ROH is on and I haven't seen it since we got rid of cable/dvr.
@knowsknothing @jenipear I did give myself a stinger attempting a corkscrew plancha into bed once, so let's just say we're both bright.
@knowsknothing @jenipear That would not have been my top choice for attempting at home at school or anywhere as they say.
@knowsknothing @jenipear i believe so. She really did great dealing with so much crap.
@jenipear @knowsknothing I'll have to try it on you tomorrow. At home. They don't have that warning anymore, do they?
@knowsknothing @jenipear Why is it so hard to put that hold on properly?
@knowsknothing @jenipear Back to the action here, that may be one of the worst Sharp Shooters I've ever seen.
@jenipear @knowsknothing Not if it means Heyman's "in control." #paulheymanguy
@jenipear @knowsknothing Vince always says UFC isn't competition. Because he funds it? #conspiracytheorywithjesseventura
@knowsknothing @jenipear I'm thinking Lesnar/Punk vs HHH/Cena for control of the company at WM32.
@jenipear @knowsknothing It's all a work people.
@jenipear @knowsknothing NFL run, that is.
@jenipear @knowsknothing I see no reason this can't be as successful as Brock's run.
@jenipear @knowsknothing Too hurt to wrestle though, right?
@knowsknothing @jenipear No, Christian already had his match.
@jenipear @knowsknothing I suppose rivalries are typically not quite so one-sided.
@knowsknothing @jenipear ...yes...
@jenipear @knowsknothing Is Big Show John Cena's greatest rival/most frequent opponent? #JudgementDay2009 #WM20
@jenipear @knowsknothing Another thing I really dislike is the de-devistationization of the Big Show's chokeslam over the years.
@jenipear @knowsknothing Fear.
@knowsknothing @jenipear About Flair or Santino?
@knowsknothing @jenipear Hey, you wannna stop foreshadowing? Some of us haven't seen this before.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Meanwhile face Batista is getting booed. This doesn't bode well for his big comeback in five years. #bluetista
@knowsknothing @jenipear I love all of his stuff with Savage.
http://t.co/NBJ9FUYAlz @knowsknothing @jenipear Well, it was more angular when it was the Lion Tamer, if that's what you're thinking of.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Batista/Orton? Time to go get a snack. #JudgementDay2009 #WWENetwork #sammich
@knowsknothing @jenipear I feel like we've disused this before, but: Least effective finisher: Walls of Jericho or Flair's figure four?
@knowsknothing @jenipear It was in the buildup to Bash at the Beach 96. I have never been able to find footage of the interview.
@jenipear @knowsknothing I think he had one half of an original knee and most of his original left ankle.
If you would have told me while watching Souled Out 98 that Mysterio and Jericho would be where they were in 09, I would have believed you.
It's hard to believe the undercard on an "unimportant" ppv was so strong just five years ago. #JudgementDay2009 #WWENetwork
@knowsknothing @jenipear Do you remember the one where he talked about finding DDP's Lord of the Ring ring in the bathroom?
@knowsknothing @jenipear I'm guessing not, based on this unofficial episode of Miz TV.
What an annoying hat. I enjoy Heel Miz, but this is a bit much. #WWENetwork #JudgementDay2009 #reallyawsome
@knowsknothing @jenipear Ok that makes much more sense.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Well that too

@jenipear @knowsknothing Two matches in and no Lawler or Cole? I think I like this PPV already. #JudgementDay2009 #mattstriker #goodoldjr
@jenipear @knowsknothing Have they ever had a MITB winner look strong? Any winning streaks?
@jenipear @knowsknothing Punk, as Mr. Money In The Bank,  lost clean to Umaga in Chicago. Why would he have ever been frustrated?
@jenipear @knowsknothing I don't know. I think he has a history with Bryan, too though.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Think it's too late for Joe to get a run in WWE?
@knowsknothing @jenipear Well we know Survivor Series was number 999, so we can probably work backwards from there.
My favorite thing about Umaga was how Regal would always call him "Umaynga." #WWENetwork #JudgementDay2009 #3minutes #itsclobberintime

@knowsknothing I just don't get why Cena would need muscle or someone to get heat for him.
@knowsknothing We could watch some random ppv together and make dumb comments about it. Also, I really am curious about that pairing.
@knowsknothing I think we started that one n but never got around to finishing it. You have three hours to kill at some point this weekend?
Something's been bothering me: Why was Bull Buchanan put with John Cena anyway? Muscle? Heat? #WWENetwork #Bsquared #yoyoyo #truthcommision

Regal at the top of his game here as usual. Quick distraction of the ref allows for low blow. Didn't end this match though. #WCWUncensored96

Interesting way to end that match. Konnan stayed face by trying to raise Eddie's hand. Guerrero stayed strong by losing via low blow.

@1500ESPN_Reusse No, I think I've seen that one. Turns out donor was acutally serial kicker. Biggest problem is they were both left-handed.

First Nitro l remember watching was Flair dropping the belt to Giant. He was booked like a monster during that run (until the end).
I wonder how much more Big Show could have gotten over if he had been protected a little more. #WWENetwork #SurvivorSeries09
As usual, Big Show made to look like an idiot. Why not pin Jericho and then beat Taker down after the match? #WWENetwork #SurvivorSeries09
I'm not sure why the referee didn't count when all three men were down. A draw was on the table here right? #SurvivorSeries09 #WWENetwork

Farming is a very demanding profession that benefits all of us. It should be honored and celebrated. YAY FARMERS!

Alex Rodriguez probably really likes to play baseball.
I bet most people who work on Wallstreet just want to make a better life for themselves and their families.

If I had to guess, I would say Barack Obama probably gives a lot of thought to what's best for the country before he makes decisions.
I bet Justin Bieber does a lot of charity work.

The further removed from Vickie Guerrero we get, the more I appreciate her. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
Boy, that grown man is really upset that Batista lost. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
Boy that grown woman is really excited to have touched Edge. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
Nice of WWE to show a Knockouts title match as Mickie James defends against Winter. #WWENetwork #NOC2008 #idratherbeaknockoutthanadiva
@mjgeiger128 I'd mention Zack Ryder, but I'm not 100% sure he's still with the company. #WWENETWORK #NOC2008
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Why is Kofi Kingston not a major player in WWE right now?  #NOC2008 #WWENetwork #BOOMBOOMBOOM
@WeTalkWrestling Without knowing the match, I'm going to go ahead and guess that he did not end up going to the pay windah. #ifyouwheel
@mjgeiger128 See also: Kingston, Kofi. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
@knowsknothing He was actually my favorite wrestler, so it was really hard for me to quit watching his stuff cold turkey.
So...Cody lost the tag belts to...Cody? OK. #NOC2008 #WWENetwork #priceless
Once again surprising longevity rears its head: Cody Rhodes was in the company back in 2008. Hard to think of him as a veteran. #NOC2008
@knowsknothing That was a big moment for sure. For me it was the debut of the Nexus that made me start watching regularly again.
@knowsknothing I find it helpful in rationalizing how I can appreciate someone's craft without celebrating the individual.
@knowsknothing I find myself thinking about that a lot with the current Adrian Peterson issues. Obviously, not the same thing, but...
@knowsknothing Yeah, even I was able to come to my senses and stay away for a while after that, but eventually they always drag me back in.
@mjgeiger128 That was 17 years ago. Ugh. I suddenly feel very old.
Kane debuted at first PPV I ever watched live. I remember thinking "There's no way this gimmick lasts more than 6 months." #NOC2008
Speaking of surprisingly long careers: ECW title match featuring Mark Henry, Big Show and Kane. #NOC2008 #WWENetwork #WWECW
Ahhhhh.... Mike Adamle.... that certainly happened....#NOC2008 #WWENetwork
Ahhhh, McMahon's Millions...that certainly happened...#WWENetwork #NOC2008
@knowsknothing You mean KENNY!!! Wonder what ever happened to NICKY!!!
Even though he now evokes audible revulsion from @jenipear, I like Matt Hardy. He knows how to sell an "injury." #WWENetwork #NOC2008
@knowsknothing What's a Bam Neeley?
When's the last time the bodyguard gimmick has worked out for someone long term? #WWENetwork #NOC2008 #Dieselpower
I don't remember much from this time in WWE, specifically, who is that accompanying Chavo Jr.? #WWENetwork  #NOC2008 #oooooChavoooo
Even when the rosters were split, I never liked having two tag team titles. Never seems to be enough credible teams. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
No fan of how the wrestling indusrty in general treats little people. With that in mind, Hornswoggle has had an amazing career. #WWENetwork
First pleasant surprise: commentary team of JR and Mick Foley! This should be interesting. #NOC2008 #WWENetwork #WWEHOF
Haven't done this for a while, so here we go: stream-tweeting the first Night of Champions PPV from 2008. #WWENetwork #NOC2008
Hey, y'all! Commence the jiggling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@jenipear @PurpleForTheWin Under giant piles of money.
@jenipear Logical callers on a radio sports chat show? I find that very hard to believe.
@jenipear sounds good to me.
@jenipear What a great time to cancel or cable. Make sure we don't accidentally watch.
@jenipear yeah, I'm sure he'll be just fine, but I'm probably not going to watch
@jenipear meh
@jenipear he didn't cover "Old Hippie" did he?
@jenipear pretty sure those are your only two options for county songs these days
@jenipear Is it about a girl in tight jeans drinking in a truck with loud music? Or is it about a woman getting revenge on some guy?
Oh man. I missed a preseason safety? 2004 Matt is so disappointed. Stoopid Simpsons marathon.
Who let the Ice Monster on the football field and what does it have against Matt Asiata?
Hey, @PurpleForTheWin, I haven't been paying much attention. You ever hear of this Patterson kid?
SOCK PUPPETS!  #EverySimpsonsEver http://t.co/Em4H7X1tCd
Remember that episode of The Simpsons where Bart suffered from W.F.S. (Wandering Face Syndrome)? #EverySimpsonsEver http://t.co/pCEG5kZ4Rq
Put some zowsers in your trousers!
@knowsknothing no wait....a train, yeah that's it.
@knowsknothing and there's a picture of a bee.
@jenipear I don't know. I've heard GK shows can get pretty rowdy.
Lesnar is dominating this match so much, I forgot Heyman was at ringside. #SummerSlam
A German announce table? I guess that explains all the suplexes.#SummerSlam
Lesnar's ear is so cauliflowered it looks like he has a hearing aid.
@mjgeiger128 Not that I was a huge fan before that
Watched SummerSlam 2003 earlier. Pre-Angle/Lesnar video package showed Brock destroying Zach Gowen. Made me legit dislike the guy.
Brock Lesnar might be the best heel in wrestling history. It takes a lot for me to genuinely dislike a bad guy in wrestling, but he's got it
...I mean Nikki turning, Rollins winning, Rusev crushing the hopes and dreams of the USA, whatever the hell that Totinos thing was. Just sad
When...I mean...if Brock conquers Cena tonight, this is going to go down as one of the least feel-good #SummerSlams of all time...
And @jenipear just predicted a heel turn that I didn't see coming. I think we need to take a wrestling break.
I have to admit, this is turning out much better than I expected. #SummerSlam #stephvsbrie
Bray Wyatt is obviously coming into this match thinking he knows the recipe for success.  #SummerSlam #whyishewearinganapron
I feel like this match would have meant a lot more if Wyatt had won last month. #SummerSlam
Lumberjacks giving Seth Rollins the reverse Muhammad Hassan treatment. #crowdsurfing #SummerSlam #RoyalRumble2005
This must be one of those falls count anywhere lumberjack matches I've heard so much about. #SummerSlam
What was Ambrose even doing up there? Don't nobody want to see a Dean Ambrose moonsault. #SummerSlam #Lumberjacks
@knowsknothing I always thought Firebreaker anything was the dumbest name in wrestling history
@knowsknothing  #Neverforget
More like #Bootin #SummerSlam #USAUSAUSA
...Koloff, Koloff, Volkoff, Zhukov, Kozlov and Repoman.#SummerSlam #Pootin
Next pay per view Swagger/Rusev lumberjack match feat. Hacksaw, Slaughter, Patriot, Pittman, Ranger Ross, Cobra, Kirchner...#SummerSlam

@ChrisWarcraft I love you man, but I would have thought that insulting someone because of their beliefs was beneath you.
@jenipear @justinjelinek @PurpleForTheWin Are you suggesting you know of some NFL preseason-related porn?
RT @AntiJokeCat: I've got 99 problems and one of them is that I count my problems instead of solving them.
Wait. They tried to relaunch Glacier? And the announcers were burying it immediately? How did this company not make it another year? #WCW
Ooooooo. Shane Douglas!!!! Maybe this won't be such a bad show after all. #WCWMayhem2000
There sure were a lot of random ladies in WCW at this time. Were they all former Nitro Girls? #WCWMayhem2000 #WWENetwork
@mjgeiger128 Also, I just remembered the awful WCW Backstage Assault game for N64.
@mjgeiger128 I think that's what Singapore Canes were made out of, snap bracelets.
Crowbar/Reno/Vito hardcore title match. ... ... um ... Did you know that the snap bracelet was invented by a Wisconsin school teacher? #WCW
What the hell is a Mancow? And how is it related to Manbearpig? #mute
@jenipear  Just suggested that Shannon Moore was the original founding member of the Beautiful People?
@knowsknothing @jenipear including the spot where Kimona Wanalaya was somehow able to take on...I mean take out 6 guys?
I'm not a huge fan of Mark Madden and Stevie Ray on commentary. Still have a soft spot for Tony Schiavonne though. #WCWMayhem2000
@knowsknothing @jenipear Technically I think they'd be 2 count at this point.
The amount of talent floundering in the dying days of WCW coupled with the awful booking is so similar to today's TNA, it's scary.
Aaand here come Shannon Moore and Sugar Shane Helms for the first smile of the show from @jenipear.
I had no idea Mean Gene was still around at this point. #WWENetwork #WCWMayhem2000
Just started Mayhem 2000 on #WWENetwork. I have no idea what's going on in this Sanders/Kee-Wee match. Or should I say "Kwee-Wee?" #WCW
@jenipear Double check the year on that and get back to me.
I love the graphics (when they remember to show them)! #Starrcade83
@PurpleForTheWin Agreed. Though I might argue that bleeped out noncursing is the funniest of all.
@knowsknothing Did you ever subscribe to Classics On Demand? They showed Mid-Atlantic episodes from around this time.
@knowsknothing Did you have a much knowledge on the buildup to these matches? It seems like a lot of tag team matches just thrown together
I don't think Dick Slater gets enough credit for the lengthy career he had. #Starrcade83
@knowsknothing You just watched this a couple weeks ago, right? Did you end up getting the subscription?
@knowsknothing So Jack and Jerry were heels? I thought they were like Steamboat, always the good guys.
@mjgeiger128 Well that was much shorter and less bloody than I was expecting.
@mjgeiger128 I have very limited exposure to both of these guys, and I'm starting to think that may be a good thing. #scars
Abdullah the Butcher vs Carlos Colon? And I thought there was an unnecessary amount of blood at the end of the Sullivan match. #Starrcade83
Wait. Who were faces at #Starrcade83 ? Race and Valentine were in the same locker room with the Briscos.
Kevin Sullivan was such a good heel. I wonder how much further he could have gone if he were a foot or two taller.
Why doesn't WWE give the masked tag team thing another try? It seems like it's been long enough they could probably recycle that one.
Why did they spell it Starrcade, with two "R's"? #wwenetwork
Was Rufus R. Jones just Dusty Rhodes in disguise?
Was one of the Assassins the same guy who managed Pretty Wonderful in the early 90s?
Watching Starrcade 83 on #wwenetwork. Couple of thoughts on opening match...
@DJDanielson Except, I guess, for later on in the song where he's described as, "the man called Sting." That's pretty accurate as well.
@NoContextAds Now hold on, I've seen this full ad. It's for a great product originally called the Portabowl and it makes some good points.
@DJDanielson How could anyone not like it? "He does this. He does that." Never been a more apt description of the man.
@LaVelleNeal What was the reaction like for Redmond at Target Field? There was a commercial on when he came out.
I really want to like the Miz. Or hate the Miz. Or feel anything other than confused indifference towards the Miz.
For that matter when was the last one-on-one world championship match at a WWE ppv? #WWEBattleground
When was the last ppv title match that did not include Randy Orton? #wweraw #overexposed
Why do they still have two belts? #wweraw #WWEWorldHeavyweightChampion #toomuchhardware
OK. I know there was hesitancy before, but I think it's time for the Twins to pursue that Correia for Bautista trade.
@JPSpells17 I know, I know. If you really want to be annoyed, look at a list of three or more things in the paper and count the comas.
@JPSpells17 @Russostrib I  guess what I'm trying to say in response to your original tweet was, yes, he most likely has a JOURNALISM degree.
@JPSpells17 Like I said, it's one of those things about print journalism that drives people crazy.
@JPSpells17 @Russostrib Try substituting the city or state instead of the team. "Vancouver was playing dirty."
@JPSpells17 @Russostrib It's one of those weird AP style things that infuriates English sticklers that try to cross over to journalism.
@JPSpells17 @Russostrib The Wild is being referred to as the organization, a single entity.
@knowsknothing @jenipear Ahhh, excellent choice, sir. May I recommend something in a nice Spring Stampede 1994?
@knowsknothing @jenipear Looks like noon on Monday. Which is probably noon Eastern.
@mjgeiger128 The main event must be even worse than I expect it to be, because that Wright/HHH match was solid, too.
When did HHH drop the spinwheel kick from his repertoire? #WWENetwork
Alex Wright just leapfrogged the referee. Now I knew who Mysterio patterned his career after. #WWENetwork #Starrcade94
Alex Wright knows the guy that owns this place! #WWENetwork #Starrcade94 #obscureishfamilyguyreference
@knowsknothing @jenipear yup
I've heard nothing but bad things about this pay per view, but that Vader/Duggan match was awesome. #WWENetwork #Starrcade94
@jenipear  Oh, it's damn real.  http://t.co/YJWMBu2Ush
@jenipear @knowsknothing Tomorrow's viewing: Capital Combat 1990.
Nice to see @OfficialHacksaw with a belt. #Starrcade94 #WWENetwork #Hoooooo
Pretty sure the pose Hogan used holding the PWI Wrestler of the Year award is the same one he used to shill Hogan-O's at Pastamania at MOA.

Well that was an odd end to the Edge/Batista match at Judgement Day 07. Oddly excited for the main event. #CenaKhali #noreally #WWENetwork
I like the referee interaction before the @EdgeRatedR/@DaveBautista match. Referees used to be so much more important. #WWENetwork
What do I miss most about seeing Edge in WWE? The man had some darn good entrance themes. #WWENetwork

@DJDanielson If you have the network, and enjoy awkward exchanges on commentary, check it out. I feel bad for Bobby every time I watch it.
@DJDanielson Ever listen to Schiavonne and Heenan toward the end of the Brain's WCW run (Souled Out 2000)? Tony seems legitimately annoyed.
@mjgeiger128 Oh yeah, the Outsiders/Bischoff interview. Legendary. #WWENetwork
@mjgeiger128 Wait, I think Luger/Giant is still to come.
Main event, NFL vs WCW. I remember not liking this match, but it's actually pretty fun for what it is. #WWENetwork
@mjgeiger128 Also, Sting's tights remind me of multicolored marshmallows.
Both of these guys are awesome in this match, but Regal is on fire. Personality-wise I don't think I've ever seen a better performance.
Sting/@RealKingRegal right now. I've been meaning to rewatch this match for a while. #WWENetwork
Great American Bash 1996 was a great night for the Four Horsemen, probably the last great night as a collective unit. #WWENetwork
Sullivan/Benoit right now on #WWENetwork. Having not been exposed to ECW when I first saw this, it was unlike anything I had ever seen.
1996 Great a American Bash streaming right now on @WWENetwork. One of my favorite WCW ppvs. Yet another Malenko/Mysterio classic right now.
@WWEKidman Just surprised I hadn't heard of them. Sometimes	 I feel like I've seen all of the interesting wrestling stuff there is to see.
@WWEKidman I've often wondered what Fred Goldberg was like.

@WWECreative_ish @WWEDanielBryan You would rather an interview segment than a match on a pay per view?

@mjgeiger128 oops. Not what I meant, but I'm just going to leave that there for posteriority.
Why don't they just put all the titles in Kofi? #MITB
It's not that I'm cheering against Dolph in this match, it's just that I don't want him to win. #MITB #koficanfly
Someone tell Rollins to calm down. #MITB
God bless Damian Sandow. I wonder what size lemon costume he wears. #MITB
@PurpleForTheWin I know the awesome sauce bags from KwikTrip are cheap and it's super convenient to get your a.s. there, but, trust me.
@PurpleForTheWin @katienolan What you want is a nice bottle, or failing that, a jar for your awesome sauce.
@PurpleForTheWin @katienolan Don't know who that is, but in my experience, bags are not ideally functional as awesome sauce containers.

@Matt_Striker_ I'm willing to bet your cats would have a better record in scaffold matches than their namesakes.
@PMac21 And to think the Twins could have kept him if they had just been willing to make him the closer.
@DJDanielson @MeatSauce1 Another example of one of the many reasons I am sometimes ashamed of my time as a journalist.
@jenipear We'll have to shop for some Wild underthings for you.
@jenipear Huh. Kind of figured you'd be used to that by now.
@jenipear Irregardless, this is America and we have freedom of speech, so it's really not you're place too tell people what they can say.
Gee, for fans that haven't seen playoff baseball in 20 years, theses Pirates fans are pretty cocky/annoying.
Raw is officially on hold.  Time to watch some "real" sports.  Go Rangers.
https://t.co/QQXtdY8i0s Give this a listen and I dare you not to get funky like a monkey.
So HHH can't keep track of numbers over four?
Condescendingly or not, I see even Stephanie couldn't help but rock out to Dusty's music.
If I could be serious for a minute, I hope El Torito gets over. Hornswoggle aside, pro wrestling has not been good to little people.
https://t.co/028ee3Zvhx So which one of Los Matsdores is Chevy Chase? Obviously El Torito is Martin Short.
Ole'?
Renee Young is good at what she does. Hopefully they keep her in her current role and don't try to put her in the ring.
Even heel Orton gets Mauer squeals.
I hope CM Punk's hair grows out quickly.  Right now he's got a little too much of a Buff Bagwell thing going on. http://t.co/ZxuJcscKzm
I really like the old school aspects of Big E Langston's move set. #bigsplash #abdominalstretch
Also, my phone really wants to auto correct his name to Bread Maddox.
Brad Maddox is confusing to look at.
Just started raw, time to "live" tweet.
@DJDanielson @ringofhonor #catlikereflexes
@DJDanielson @ringofhonor Glad you survived. I thought Steen and Jacobs landed right on top of you.
Another battle royal pic.  #becomingaBobbyFishmark http://t.co/geWlyyIUiF

@RobotOwl  Look, if you can't fully appreciate Linda Perry, there's no need for nervous laughter. It just means this guy is better than you.
The bad news: the squirrels are out to get me. http://t.co/nuiVNKojxb
The good news: the squealing my breaks were making will not cost me hundreds of dollars to fix.
@RobotOwl @jenipear Babies are expensive.
Well that's never happened to me. I just had twitter deja vu.
@mjgeiger128 To be fair, St. Louis' Brock Peterson and Randy Choate never actually played a regular season game for the Twins.
Of the 14 teams still in post-season contention, the only team without a former Twin is the Yankees.
I'm not sure about "greatest," but Iron Mike Sharpe sure seemed like Canada's loudest athlete.
@mjgeiger128 Ok. Finally stopped smiling. At least about that.
You know what phrase I haven't heard in a while? "Horse hockey."
Hmmm... did not know that "offices" is an acceptable substitute for "works." As in, "Mary offices at the West Adleburry site."
@jenipear Yes, but did they have anything else on? Could just have been a flasher with a sense of style.
Also, I'm really enjoying the @ringofhonor title tournament if for no other reason, it has given me another chance to see London &amp; Kendrick.
I realize I'm late to the party, but every time I see Kevin Steen in action I am more impressed.
Twitter exclusive. At the X. http://t.co/a6key7ymgo
Still more of a baseball guy, but music selection at the X beats the pants off of music selection at Target Field.
@jenipear Yes, this time I was talking about Arnold, not his lesser known, but equally flavorless Inuit cousin Arnokd.
3) I've never gotten the appeal of Arnokd Skaaland. Likely the most bland manager I've ever seen.
2) Fans in 1979 were a lot more easily  entertained than today's fans.
1) Bob Backlund was STRONG. Like Antonio Cesaro-strong.
Currently enjoying Bob Backlund vs Bobby Duncum from 1979 on Classics On Demand. Three thoughts to follow:
@JakeFiedler @Brandon_Warne What you're describing is public relations, not journalism.
@JakeFiedler @Brandon_Warne @TwinsPrez A beat writer accepting money from the organization they cover would be a huge conflict of interest.
@jenipear the smiles sure are nice though
@jenipear Then why are they packaged in rectangles, otherwise known as the prefect grocery bag base?
@jenipear Sunday. Sunday! SUNDAY!
Just saw the video for Funplex by the B-52's for the first time.  I'll let you know when I finally stop smiling.
@justinjelinek @RobotOwl Also, how exactly does the scoring work, re: grunting? More points for loudest or most sexually suggestive?
@justinjelinek @RobotOwl @MarcusMichalik yes, but what's the net for?
@mjgeiger128 Found it!
Just heard lady say that she's never going to a woman  doctor again because they're just "too dingy." Wow.
@RobotOwl Remember? He was the one that was always  crossdressing to try to get out of the Navy. Klingon, I think was his character.
@RobotOwl No no no. You've got it all wrong. Chuck Woolery was never on that show.  He was on Love Boat. Love BOAT.
@RobotOwl Wait a minute.  Alan Thicke? The host of Love Connection?  Pervy? Maybe a little creepy, sure, but Pervy?
@RobotOwl No. No I do not.
Random Wrestling Thing of the Day Pt. 1: Macho Man and the Kliq dominate softball game before SummerSlam 94 http://t.co/FcwQHh8vKX via @wwe
@RobotOwl congratulations. You have now seen more of a wrestling-based program than I have. I hope you're happy.
Random Wrestling Thing of the Day: Good old-fashioned heel heat. http://t.co/z05un0wKzM
Sometimes I forget just how little people who have never worked retail know about working retail.
@CMPunk Irrelevant question. The ranking goes 1) Adam West. 2) Everybody else.
@mjgeiger128 Probably why I wasn't too upset when I "accidentally" left him in the backyard and he was run over with the lawn mower.
@mjgeiger128 Also, this is the reason I never liked Hillbilly Jim. I always felt like his eyes were following me.
Random Wrestling Thing of the Day: Memories of playing with these go way back before I can remember being a fan. http://t.co/7OfBT1Poyn
@jenipear @justinjelinek Is this the weird eye thing you were talking about? http://t.co/skMLmq0QCD
@jenipear Come at me entertainment!
@jenipear tonight is this weekend, right?
@jenipear anti - favorite.  #jealous
@JoeyStyles @TrueKofi @HEELZiggler @DarrenYoungWWE @TitusONeilWWE @ZackRyder Zack...Ryder? Sounds familiar. Didn't he used to be on TV?
Chips, cheese, salsa, chocolate and Mountain Dew:	A hero's breakfast. 	A winner stew.
@jenipear Ok.  Should I take this as unpaid or use up the pto?
@justinjelinek  Congratulations.  Now if you could only get that coffee mug with your name right on it.
@SOTSOHockey Hmmmm...Coach Marshall looks funny in your new picture.
@jenipear I want a cookie.
@mjgeiger128 never mind,  we have a Tommy Young sighting.
So,  did the NWA employ any referees NOT named Teddy Long in 1989?
In  preparation for @CMPunk vs @HeymanHustle  on #RAW  tomorrow, watching Chi-Town Rumble '89. (bonus: @Jimcornette &amp; Bobby Eaton!)
Nice Ring Of Honor 6-man tag main event, too. #DaveyRichardsmark
Enjoying the AWF portion of my weekend: Ariya Davari vs. Craven Knyte, not too shabby.
@RobotOwl @justinjelinek on a pile of...woooood?
Thanks cbs sports ap for your wonderful popup ad that scared the crap out of me and made me look like even more of a spaz than normal!
@RangerBlake @Ken_Rosenthal Wait, so Rios + $ for PTBNL OR $? What's the point of trading a guy and cash for cash?
@justinjelinek @RobotOwl I don't know,  I always found his humor rather wooden.
@RobotOwl  Meanwhile, Sagat gets pleasure out of watching videos of folks getting hit in the nuts.
@RobotOwl That's insanity! Stamos is the guy your ugly husband turns into when you eat the right yogurt.
@mjgeiger128 @mjgeiger 14 AND a half, if you count it CORRECTLY. Hahahas lol lol lol. #inthe

@dbremer_pxp Mr. Bremer, Dave Gassner was from Hortonville, Wisconsin. He went to highschool with a former co-worker.
Correction: I am now being told it's murgatroyd. I guess that clears everything up.
Just curious, what the hell does "heavens to mergatroyd" even mean?
One word to describe today: nincompoopery.
@JohnCena I figured you had just visited Scott Steiner's plastic surgeon. #tennisballsinhisbiceps
Not sure, but I think the person next to me was just laughing about a couple of kids getting strangled by a python. Odd...
@jenipear #ifbaseballwerewrestling ?
@Honda my kid is a month old. Unless your vehicles come with optional boobs I doubt he cares.
Irrelevant now but I think Joe was out at first there.
I can not believe Joe Mauer only has one career walk off hit.
@Honda unless you're giving one away, I kind of doubt it.
@jenipear 6: _______ 7: profit
Abba Zaba, you my only friend.
@RobotOwl Not looking to buy right now, but could I interest you in a swap for a half-eaten, all-stale bag of Chex Mix?
@jaysonst I suppose it's too much to ask for the PTBNL to be Nick Punto.
Pretty sure I dozed off at the urinal there for a little bit.  #parentingiseasy #workibgmanproblems #weeeeeeeee
When it's all said and done, I'm pretty sure the thing I'll remember most about Pedro Florimon is him looking very mad at himself.
@RobotOwl what about "It's Only Make Believe?" Now that's a good piece of song right there.
@foxsearchlight no, I don't. Why do you keep asking me?
@RobotOwl so wait, do you actually enjoy his music?
@PMac21 and wouldn't Crisp be a welcome addition for the Twins? It's all about team needs. For what teams would Morneau be an improvement?
Oh come on, fortune cookie! What the hell? http://t.co/ytgy3Oo8dx
@jenipear @justinjelinek but, as always, eventually that's where my mind ends up.
@jenipear @justinjelinek admittedly, skanks are not the first thing I think of while looking at my son.
@justinjelinek and when I say body spray, I believe I mean deodorant.
@justinjelinek skanks than my body spray and/or hair products.
The only two things I care about when car shopping: how does it look driving around completely deserted cities and will it attract more
@justinjelinek I would much rather have a cool steering wheel for the summer. Either way, that's not the thing that's selling me a car.
@justinjelinek not if you've got enough common sense to dress appropriately and wear gloves.
I am not sure why an optional heated steering wheel is the feature a luxury car company would brag about in an ad run during July.
@Acura_Insider Sweet! Now nothing can stop me from either fumbling through my large purse for meth or watching small porn while driving!
@Indians @glen_perkins It's amazing how so many people on Twitter have obviously never made a stupid mistake before. What a couple of jerks.
Hey, ostriches, fuck you.
@jenipear dragons=not real. SPACE DRAGONS=not certain, but probably real.
@jenipear well, obviously
@jenipear @SOTSOHockey who isn't?
@jenipear Please tell me the boy is sleeping at least.
Think about it. http://t.co/Sw8hGeAPFi
@jenipear Completly unrelated to the matter at hand, but yes.
Sometimes I get jealous of rabbits.
@jenipear You forgot #dozingdaddy
@Manda12702 Just a head's up. I think your account has been hacked. I've gotten 3 direct message spams from you in the past 2 days.
If the Twins can't beat the Yankees tonight, with this lineup, I don't know what to think.
What is this Spring Training? This is easily the most obscure regular season Yankees lineup I have ever seen.

@PMac21 I seem to remember Mr. Durbin being something of a big (Real) Deal.
Good morning! http://t.co/NYzYPNJY33
Well hello Dr. Guns! What an unexpected surprise.
@thelizparade It's got the black hole. As in, it is an irresistible force sucking in all of the money from my wallet.
Good news: me and my car did not start the gas station on fire. Bad news: I think my car is very sick.
@jenipear You don't have to take that from him. Start setting boundaries now. Put your swollen foot down.
@foxsearchlight This tweet gave me old man headache, I have very little clue as to what you're trying to tellsell me. #huh?wha?huh?
@jenipear YOrsLbntssO? (You Only ruin someone's Life by naming them something stupid Once?)
@jenipear Just hang in there a little longer. I don't think we have anything going on on Tuesday...
@jenipear How about this one: the weird thing is, his house is in Crystal.
@SOTSOHockey @jenipear I guess this is a case of an inside joke better left to a PM. But I'm just a tweeter who plays by his own rules.
@jenipear Probably not appropriate here, but where the hell is Robbinsdale?
rudeness for the sake of revenge is no better than rudeness born out of ignorance. No better at all.

@HouseMajPAC Stop spamming Twitterers. #lunchytimetwits
Parking lot frisbee? Now I wish I worked across the street.
@Oikos I liked yougurts. It was tasting all the good to mouthes. Chewy?! Then I was the panick. Now always be refridgerate. Cool cool water.
Guess complaining about how my yogurt smelled like sourcream convinced twitter that I need a  bombardment of yogurt-based spam advertweets.
@jenipear plus, who am I to argue with a bear?
@jenipear there are many hours in a day
"@TC_00: It's  National VCR day...Celebrate those who still have a VCR!"  I must watch old wrestling tapes. The bear has commanded it.
@RobotOwl @justinjelinek So, I don't get it. Is the heart-head alien allergic to cats and that's why it's mad they abducted the kitty?
@jenipear it just might be appropriate  for the mother of a newborn to treat herself to a NIN concert while dad watches baby at home...
@jenipear Yeah, that's more or less what the other folks in the breakroom said.
@jenipear so I should not have been a wuss and thrown it out...or screamed and cried frantically  when some of it touched my hand.
Hey greek yogurt fans, I'm kind of new to this. Is it supposed to smell like sour cream?
Well that was a nice PSA about trick-or-treating by the Hot Rod at the end of that episode of Prime Time.
Did you know that other than noogies and headbutts, the main offense maneuver of the Bushwhackers was licks?
Did you know that a peanut is neither a pea nor an onion?
You know what this Hercules/Bravo match needs? More bear-hugs.
Wait a minute! I just remembered! Cake is delicious!
Main Event on this edition of Prime Time Wrestling? Hercules vs. Dino Bravo. This should be...exciting?
Puig: 1 AB-1 Hit. And now a Nick Punto sighting! Go Dodgers?
Paul Heyman may have surpassed Bobby Heenan as my favorite non-wrestler wrestling personality of all time.
If there ever was a way to get me out of this "wrestling phase," a divas reality show just might be the ticket.
I don't remember what Cody looks like without the mustache and I'm not sure I want to.
I don't dislike Sheamus as a character. I DO dislike the idea of Sheamus as a face.
Shield + Team Hell No and whoever they decide to stick them with this week: the new Smackdown Six?
And now something to get stuck in @jenipear's head: http://t.co/T3Z5SoQLLg
One of my biggest baseball pet peeves is that this song is never played past the first two bits.http://t.co/al3R2toCMK
I think the real story would be if something somewhere didn't draw racist comments online.
Star Tribune headline: "Cheerios commercial draws racist comments online." This is news? Pretty sure that's just how the internet works.
Three in a row for the Twins? I guess even a blind squirrel finds a streak every now and then. GO TWINS!
Pretty sure a CM Punk chant just broke out at the Hawks/Wings game. Nice
@justinjelinek You mean Johnny Johnson? Are you kidding me? The guy is pure evil.
I kind of feel like anyone who descibes themselves as an "Arby's fan" should probably reevaluate their life.
Thanks to Classics on Demand, enjoying RVD vs Jerry Lynn. One of those pairings I could watch all day.
I wonder what the world record is for longest amount of time spent walking without stopping to rest.
"Even the questions?!" You say! Yes! Of Course!
Check out any Marvel Comic Book before 1975 and you'll see that ever sentence had an exclamation mark at the end of it! Sometimes more!!!
Damn it, Denise! It's a good idea because I say it is! If you were half the paleontologist you claim to be, you would see that!
Yes, you are better than them. No, you don't have to make sure they know.
@jenipear @RobotOwl Mysterious ways and all that.
@nebbs85 Smell ya later. Hang in there.
@nebbs85 Saturdays 10:30 AM. It's obviously geared toward children, which means it's often (as JR would say) often goofier than a pet coon.
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl You think she would like to know the story behind the plumber?
@nebbs85 And why I consider Bryan far and away the most entertaining guy they have right now.
@nebbs85 As I get older, I find more enjoyment in the ridiculous nature of it all. That's why I think Slam is the best show on right now.
@nebbs85 Have you seen his DVD yet? If not, feel free to borrow it any time.
@nebbs85 The sad thing is that most of those old part-timers were in matches with each other and not used (except Jericho) to put guys over.
@nebbs85 It's a circular problem: He can't build the guys because they're not ready and they're not ready because he hasn't built them.
@nebbs85 Too true. Take WM for example, Brock, Taker, HHH, Jericho and Rock. All part-timers.
@nebbs85 I could watch Daniel Bryan all day. Kingston is awesome. Cesaro, Ziggler, Barrett, Cody, Sandow and the Shield are all solid.
@nebbs85 And I'm probably way too much of an optimist here, but there are so many younger guys who could be great if given a chance.
@nebbs85 Rose-colored glasses. I agree, the Rocks, Austins, Angles, Jerichos, Takers, Flairs, Guerreros, and the like were top notch.
You know something, Dollar Store Fancy Crackers? You're alright. You're alright.
Oh man, the wrestling episode of South Park was just on and I missed it.
@JoeyStyles @WWE @Tout Yes, but is it #trending yet?
@nebbs85 Agreed. Impressive physical feat coupled with an unexpected result = memorable moment for sure.
Since the end of RAW will have to wait until tomorrow, I think I'll tape-tweet something else after the Twins game. ? is On Demand or DVD?
@nebbs85 Speaking of ring collapses, when I first really started getting into it, Big Show was WCW champ. That chokeslam was impressive.
Well that's the end of my RAW tweets for tonight. I may pick it up tomorrow. As for now, GO TWINS!
@nebbs85 Exactly. Oh, there's another one: the superplex. Rarely used as a finisher these days, though.
I very much enjoy the amount of dedication 3MB have put into their current roles.
@nebbs85 Yes, I've seen No Holds Barred as well.
@nebbs85 Here's one from former ROH champion Kevin Steen that looks unsafe. http://t.co/OgtnEzmEst
12 Rounds...2? Really? This was needed? So does this mean I can keep dreaming about a Chaperone sequel?
Randy Orton is in a movie? I can't tell you how super psyched I am abou...zzzzzzzzzzzzz
@nebbs85 I always liked the Vader bomb too. And then there's this bit of ridiculousness: http://t.co/6bDB4CTEyp
@mjgeiger128 I'm being told that given today's events, I might want to reconsider my choice of words regarding Aaron's big day.
@nebbs85 I realized after I asked you that I don't know if I have one. I guess I always liked Savage's elbow drop. Lita's moonsault was cool
As usual, I am enjoying RAW. However, I am starting to think I should turn it back to FSN and see the rest of Aaron Hicks' coming out party.
@jenipear A 12-footer at that!
@nebbs85 I saw that. It's not bad for what it is. Out of curiosity, what is your favorite finisher?
I have to say, I have never seen a strap match that I enjoyed. I don't see Mark Henry's involvement changing that.
@jenipear Not before I post this, just because I know you likes it. http://t.co/syQiai5QcE
Kofi Kingston won a match? The US champion won a match? Weird things happening tonight. Weird things.
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 Or the stupidest thing I've ever seen in wrestling? http://t.co/mhANgMcUMR
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 Or the previously mentioned thrilling game of musical chairs? http://t.co/V84FTQdESu

Nice pick and roll by BJC. I really enjoy the Prime Time Players. Probably more than I should.
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 What about a semi-truck pull? http://t.co/3qcHaXfkU1
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 I've been there before.
Wait just a minute! She wasn't hurt at all! I'm beginning to wonder if any of this is real.
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 May have to fast forward though. Already hearing grumblings from the other side of the couch.
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 Fair warning: I am about an hour and a half behind.
Seriously, though, that may be the greatest wrestling gear I've ever seen. #Fandangosoutfit
Randy Savage thinks you should tone it down. #Fandangosoutfit
Brutus Beefcake would be embarrased to be seen in that. #fandangosoutfit
Rico would think that's a bit much. #Fandangosoutfit

@nebbs85 You're like the Undertaker of Twitter, you only show up around Wrestlemania.
@nebbs85 Oh sure, the one night I'm not watching wrestling and you come out of Twitter hibernation.
@justinjelinek That still makes me pretty mad.
So you're telling me that for the low low price of $30, I earn the right to spend $80? Where do I sign?!
@jenipear @thelizparade Do not bring an airhorn.
@dbremer_pxp  Since you guys seemed a little confused, here's some info on Doug Bernier: http://t.co/RAmP7blL95
I don't care that it actually really isn't, Norm MacDonald's "Dirty Work" is one of the best movies of all time.
@jenipear CARWASH! DIG IT!
@jenipear If I'm not supposed to guzzle it, then why do they make it taste like that thing when you stand up to fast and get dizzy?
@jenipear Sorry, I got distracted. I meant to say "peanut."
@jenipear Well, I guess that's why some people don't like the words on the guy that said they have to draw Penelope. Dig Davis trapper. Zip!
@jenipear Also, don't look over my shoulder while I'm tweeting at you. That's an invasion of privacy.
@jenipear Candy? A pony? Closure on the anecdote? Elephant stampede protection? A free-pass on this month's bear tax? Mustard?
@jenipear I'm not saying read the whole thing. I am saying that the part pertaining to JD Durbin may shed some light on the situation.
@jenipear You really should read my blog http://t.co/vPpFDhoi29. But not my other blog http://t.co/2H8fc582Un, that one sucks.
JD Durbin! warming up for the Red Sox! JD DURBIN! He's the Real Deal, in case you hadn't heard.
THE REAL DEAL!
Well that was just a great pitch by the same Sam Deduno who pitched for the Twins last year.
@jenipear I'll grab YOUR remote.
Unfortunately, it looks like the Sam Deduno that showed up for DR today is indeed the same Sam Deduno who pitched for the Twins last year.
All air horn-related annoyances aside, it is nice to see so many DR fans in the stands.
As someone who hates air horns, I get the feeling this WBC match-up is going to be borderline unwatchable.
Good job Italy. Here's hoping for an Italy/Netherlands 2017 WBC finals. In the meantime, I guess I'll just have to cheer for my country.
Boo.
J.C. Romero? Dennys Reyes? Dan Serafini? Are there any washed-up former Twins pitchers not in WBC? Anyone seen Juan Rincon?
Punto walk called a strikeout. Bad balls and strikes calls against Italy pitchers. Italy is getting shafted. I smell a fix.
@justinjelinek @jenipear Let's just say I have somewhere to go on Monday. And Tuesday. And hopefully Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and repeat.
2-run double by Drew "the Masher" Butera! Not only is Colabello looking to take Morneau's 1B job, but it looks like Drew is gunning for DH.
Something about the way Vasgersian keeps calling all of these minor leaguers "property" bothers me.
And that's the end of the day for former Twin Dan Serafini. Rough outing for Serafini as Team Morneau pulls to within 2. Italy 6, Canada 4.
Obviously not intentional and luckily just a glancing blow, but still not something I want to see again.
Not cool. Justin Moreneau just got brushed with a pitch. In the head.
@mjgeiger128 Perhaps even better, The Detroit Hot-n-Readies?
The Seattle Entertainment Systems? The Los Angeles Mickey's of Anaheim? The Toronto Communicators? The Detroit Pizza Pizzas?
MLB Network keeps showing Tony La Russa, and every time they do so, he is either on his phone or tablet. Does he even want to be there?
Makes me wonder what U.S. sports teams would be called if named after their parent corporation.
Ham Fighters are named after their parent corporation, Nippon Meat Packers, commonly known as Nippon Ham.
Current Team Canada pitcher, Dustin Molleken, is a member of the Nippon Ham Fighters of the Japan-based Pacific League.
Why Nick Punto is so frustrating. First two at bats, productive, working the count, making things happen. 3rd AB: pop up the first pitch.
Tough at bat by the other Twins first baseman in today's game as Justin, what's-his-name singles up the middle.
Hopefully Colabello makes the Twins as a bench player this year, he's already got an awesome nickname: "Mike."
Three-run home run by Twins "prospect" Chris Colabello! Or as MLB Network graphic department calls him, Mike Colabello! 5-1 Italy!
I'm now stuck on this graphic telling me there is a Spanish-born player on team Spain. I can find two coaches, but no players.
I think Jim Kaat might be a bigger Nick Punto fan than I am.
Now Kaat is telling us how Punto sort of kind of pretended to bunt allowed Anthony Granato to steal second.
According to the graphic, there is only one Team Spain player born in Spain. Not having much luck tracking down exactly who that is.
Team Italy has 8 Italian born players and then there's Spain.
Interesting MLBNetwork graphic: Players on WBC teams born in that country: 7 teams w/28 (everyone); 2 each w/26, 25 and 24; Mexico has 19...
And we're tied at 1, thanks to, as Vasgersian says, "Phillies' PROPERTY, Pete Orr."
Close play at first after a bad throw by Cale Iorg pulls Morneau off the base. Alex Liddi rounded the bag and almost didn't make it back.
And Punto scores. It's all about the hustle.
And Jim Kaat just said, and I quote, "I call Nick Punto, Pete Rose lite."....huh?
Actually I think the umpire is working pitch count there, even Punto thought that was strike three.
Nick Punto, working the count like a pro.
So team Italy has only two Italian-born starters. Interesting.
@jenipear And gluttony. Don't forget the gluttony.
Left-handed-heavy lineup for Canada. Can Italy keep the momentum going?
It's nice to see MLB Network bring out the play-by-play A-Team (Vasgersian and Kaat) for Italy vs Canada. WBCmania running wild!
Hold everything. Drew Butera just tied the game with a 2-run home run. DREW BUTERA! Go Italy!
Second takeaway from Dutch WBC performance so far: Isn't it about time somebody gave Loek Van Mil a chance at the major league level?
Biggest takeaway from the Dutch WBC performance so far: 29 is a little old, but Leon Boyd would make an interesting addition to Rock Cats.
Congratulations to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. WBC Round 2, here they come!
Former Twins prospects Van Mil vs De San Miguel: High tension with 2 out in the 9th.
Stuff I could only learn on a Monday:1 Hacksaw Jim Duggan was on the Harry &amp; the Hendersons TV show. 2 They made that movie into a TV show.
@RobotOwl Snuffy's cravings, eh? So should we expect a couple of dinner visitors on Wednesday?
@justinjelinek Excuse me for a minute. If you need me I'll be watching  about 500 Nick Punto videos. #notastalker
@jenipear MattMan, away!
@jenipear If only some hero with a heart of gold and complete disregard for his own safety would brave this blizzard and bring it to you.
@mjgeiger128 Oh man, I'm late to the Simpsons quote party again, aren't I?
@jenipear So, what's the story with that pickle? You planning on bringing it home tomorrow?
"Well, there's Jerry, the Cowboy. And that big dipper looking thing? That's Allen...the Cowboy."
@RobotOwl Are you talking about the pink-cheeked and robust children again?
Hopefully the sideplates indicate that this is just a temporary vanity belt until Punk beats Rocky and Cena at Mania. Hopefully.
Just when I was about to get mad at the Rock for making me like him again, I actually got a look at the new design. We are not amused.
@jenipear Also, not sure what kind of trap they were trying to catch me in by asking six different ways whether or not everyone else is lazy
@jenipear I guess I'm kind of worried in that case, because I'm not sure what the "correct" answers for some of them are.
Also, bare in mind that the position I was applying for was not that of philosopher.
And somehow the answers to these questions are supposed to tell a potential employer whether or not I am qualified to supervise people?
And finally: 324.       Unless everyone recognizes his duty to society, civilization is doomed.
334.       You often wonder about why human life exists and what its future is.
You would like to have enough money or power in order to impress people who think they are better than you are.
The surest way to a peaceful world is to improve people's morals.
Society puts too much control on the individual.
You like to make up exciting plots with yourself as a character.
When things go wrong, it upsets you very little.

@justinjelinek I found Prince.
Going to be very disappointed if I open this up and there's no car-shaped bed inside. http://t.co/h2w2tKiS
That is cheap. Smart, but cheap.
I guess when you are a receiver, a face-mask is actually just a well-placed stiff-arm.
Aw, that's sweet, someone was nice enough to give that Gangnam-style jackass an extension on his 15 minutes of fame.
We get it Kia, you can afford sound effects for your commercials.
So, if Bud Selig were in charge of the NFL, they would just call this a tie, right?
If they come back from commercial and Sabu isn't there, I'm done watching.
@jenipear @SOTSOHockey @knowsknothing If Wrestling 101 were a class, I might reconsider my current view of college as a worthless money-pit.
Congratulations to Eddie Guardado on his upcoming enshrinement in the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame! Does Ft. Myers need a bullpen coach?
The number of hipsters in attendance at RAW tonight is astounding.
Bob Backlund in the WWE Hall of Fame? About damn time.
No, I'm sorry Microsoft Word, you're right. I meant to type "mufti-line," not "multi-line." How stupid of me.
@jenipear Now you're getting it!
Good news: "The PTA Disbands" is one probably one of the 25 or 50 best episodes of the Simpsons EVER!
Well, it's official. I have finally outgrown the Rock.

Aces &amp; Eights: Not sure why this is an option. I am actually enjoying this angle quite a bit.
Also, upon even closer examination: These are loafers.
Upon closer examination: stupid and unfunny. This fits classic definition of WC and probably should have gotten my vote. It did not.
Natalya: Took place during height of my WWE-related Twitter-frenzy, yet I thankfully don't remember any of it. Quickly, to the YouTubes!
Claire Lynch: The little I remember about this was too stupid for me to pay attention to let alone remember. 2012 was a bad year for Styles.
AJ: Long, aimless, long, convoluted, long. Definite crap here. Since it's technically still going on, I don't feel right voting for it.

@jenipear As always, but especially given your current state, I appreciated that you joined me for the PPV-quality experience that it was.

Headline on http://t.co/DuTt7Xj5: "NHL Once Had Tradition of Playing on Christmas." Probably should have stopped after "Playing."
It will take more than belly fire to be the next Baryshnikov.
@jenipear @RobotOwl Jesse wasn't buying it. Maybe a little TOO skeptical...hmmmm....
@RobotOwl @jenipear First half was pretty neat though, Jesse, his son and Oliver Stone's kid setting out to debunk a lizard conspiracy.
@RobotOwl @jenipear The second half of the show wasn't worth watching, it's just Jesse bullying the guy he's interviewing.
@RobotOwl @jenipear Main thing you missed was Jesse, surprisingly enough, acting like an ass.
@RobotOwl @jenipear Wednesdays at 9 on TruTV. There's a replay tonight at 1 am and one at 9 am on Saturday.

@jenipear @RobotOwl It came down to the environment. I just felt the Greens were a little more likely to actually do something about it.
@jenipear @RobotOwl Oops, was that supposed to be a secret? Didn't I tell you I was going to get in trouble for wearing my green shirt?
http://t.co/TBkUXBrb Hey Twins, do the names Morales, Tiffee, Rodriguez and Ford ring any bells? Why not give them another shot?
@RobotOwl Me too, that's one of the main reasons I voted for Stein.
@jenipear Maybe that would be a good way for her to reach across the aisle?
@jenipear Isn't it customary to take the last name of your opponent? I thought that was kind of like eating their heart for courage.
@jenipear Ooops. Got me on that one:-)
@RobotOwl I agree completely that it wasn't the ONLY reason, but I do feel that fear is a big motivator.
3) How long until we can just call her Senator Thompson?
1) Congratulations to first openly gay Senator, Tammy Thompson. 2) Why has it taken this long?
Question about the fiscal cliff: How can a country that's already in a recession go into a recession?
Dow down almost 300 points? WHY, OH WHY DID WE RE-ELECT OBAMA????
@RobotOwl So do you think that, if presented as a viable candidate, Jill Stein wouldn't have landed more Obama voters?
I guess all those typical fear-based, fact-free commercials really worked (as usual). Yay politics!
Gary Johnson basically said anyone who voted for Obama or Romney did so mainly because they were afraid of the other. Makes sense to me.
Gary Johnson on CNN right now. SURE, now that the election is over, they acknowledge his existence.
http://t.co/qgbqwBYC Looking back on some of the "highlights" of this election.
Also a tight race between "Radical" Rick Nolan and "What An Ass" Chip Cravaak.
Tight race for "Big Spending" Jim Graves and "I'm Here (at least at the end of my commercials)" Michele Bachmann.
Oh man...It's just now dawning on me that @CraigyFerg isn't going to be on tonight. Slightly less of a great day for America.
CBS also verifying widely held belief that Obama had the dancing Asian woman vote sewn up.
CBS with a great shot of the back of Scott Pelley's head there.
@justinjelinek As a former journalist, I think it's OK for me to say this: What's a newspaper?
@justinjelinek It still irks me. Instant gratification is not always necessary. Those votes will still be there tomorrow (most likely).
@justinjelinek Guess who's moving to Colorado!
Ohio is a great example of why I get frustrated that networks call states with 7% of the votes counted. Patience people, patience.
Sooo many sad republicans on NBC right now. :-(
Those two bespectacled ladies that Fox keeps showing dancing at the Obama rally sure do like the American flag.
Did you know that Obama won by going very small and very negative. Unlike if Romney had won, as big and positive as he went.
@justinjelinek @RobotOwl Well maybe they try, but they certainly don't appeal to me.
@justinjelinek @RobotOwl As someone who has been accused of being both white and a man, gotta say: the GOP certainly doesn't pander to me.
@PMac21 FEED ROMNEY MORE votes?
@justinjelinek Seems to me most Republicans are just closet Libertarians anyway, at least the ones they throw on TV.
@justinjelinek Maybe the Republicans should check out the Libertarian party?
Wait, Romney camp doesn't think Ohio is done? Only 900 vote difference with 74% reporting. It ain't over til it's over?
"Republicans don't do as well when they nominate someone moderate" also when they nominate someone terribly ill-equipped to be president.
Way to go suburban housewives?
Now what I'm really interested in: How did Johnson and Stein do? Oh yeah, a couple of pretty important amendments, too.
Somebody check on the folks at Fox News, I'm worried about them.
@justinjelinek Maybe a little too "right" if you know what I'm talking about.
Oh, by the way, I think stuff might still be happening in other parts of the world. Maybe.
Breaking news on Fox a half hour ago: someone somewhere fainted while in line to vote. See: that's why we need 24-hour news channels.
Eric Cantor is on CNN right now. Never seen a man talk so much with his teeth. He's got nice teeth.
If only President Obama hadn't personally fired me.
This is why I shouldn't be allowed to be unemployed on election day.
Hmm...According to CNN, both the Democrats and the Republicans think they can win the election. Interesting...
Nice that he took time out of his schedule, which I assume at this point is dedicated 100% to the cleanup effort. To talk to Fox about this.
I agree with former Mayor Giuliani. President Obama should have personally had the Sandy mess cleaned up by now. It's been over a week!
Just under five hours before the first polls close. That means just under three hours before news networks "officially" declare a winner.
I can't thank the Republicans enough for not nominating Ron Paul. I would have actually had to consider voting for someone non-third party.
Ron Paul on CNN right now. Doesn't see this election as very important at all. Predicts regardless of results it will be business as usual.
Fox News is worried that Obama blaming Bush for the shape that he left the country in is not good for America.
Surprisingly enough, she thinks the president puts too much blame on his predecessor.
Things you miss when your wife is allergic to Fox News: Liz Cheney is a Fox News contributor.
Also, a great example of why I love/hate to read internet comments. People can be so deliciously frustrating.
Nice piece calling out one of the many types of "journalism" that makes me glad to be out of the game.

@RobotOwl LSP is soooo annoying. Plus she's super creepy, thinking everybody always wants to touch her lumps and stuff. ARGH!
About to Google Mike Max to see how old he is. Based on comparison to the company he's keeping tonight, I'm going to guess about 25.
Based on the amount of time he's spent looking directly at the camera, there's no question that Mr. Reusse realizes it is.
Watching "Sports Show." Enjoying it. Wondering if Mr. Hartman realizes it is a TV show.
"Odumbler" offends me because it is lazy and stupid, not because it is mean-spirited. Rant over.
Do you see him as a communist threat? Why not ObaMao? Is he too soft on an issue for you? Try OBambi. Paranoid? How about ObeyMe?
Why not the classic Nobama? Or the Simpsons-inspired D'Ohbama? Just Google "Nicknames for Obama" plenty of better choices.
Unless it's supposed to be said with a  weird Boston accent, you know, like "Odumblah." That kind of works, I guess. If you're stupid.
What bothers me is that there are so many derisive Obama nicknames that actually kind of work. It just shows a lack of creativity.
http://t.co/MBP3Yrnm	This is the story that somehow motivated the original comment. Unless I'm misinterpreting. Confusing.
Post that piqued my curiosity: "Both are kicking odumbler motors worthless ass, so odumbler had to find something to cut their sales..."
I mean, I understand calling people names in an effort to discredit them, but "Odumbler?" That doesn't even work.
I'm probably really late to the party on this one, but after reading a comment, have to ask: do some people really call Obama "Odumbler?"
I can't believe @NHL and @NHLPA are forcing me to consider watching the NBA tonight. Stop this madness NOW! Get back to work.
Interesting addition to the previous related note, 75% of 0 = 0.
In a related note, I am now at least 75% more likely to check out NBC's Munsters reboot tomorrow.
A surprise Eddie Izzard appearance on @CraigyFerg? Yeah, that'll cheer a fella up.
An hour on the phone to get two channels that I don't even want for free for six months and then I have the chore of canceling. Go Comcast!
Either that or I got hung up on...
Oh man, I must be on super secret hold this time, there's no commercials.
And now I'm on hold for the seventh time, talking to the second person. I don't even watch HBO or Showtime!
Kind of funny how less than one full month of a $99 bundle can become almost $450.
The time I've spent on the phone with Comcast has now surpassed the 45 minute mark.
Think it's too late to find a spot for Ozzie on the Twins' staff?
Victory shower for Giants. Yay?
Am I glad Kurt Cobain is dead? Of course not. Am I glad Nirvana only had 3 studio albums while the Foo Fighters have 7? Of course I am.
Is it just me or has there been an excessive amount of slow motion Pablo Sandoval shots tonight in St. Louis?
@jenipear I'm not afraid to get my uniform dirty.
@jenipear Well one thing's for sure, if given the opportunity, I would get after it.
@jenipear Some order fulfillment, some office replenishment, some mail room, even looked like there was a little bit of janitorial in there.
@jenipear From the description they gave me the position is basically a utility man type role.
Turns out I might be suitable for data entry: 11088 keystrokes/hour (36 words/minute). According to the test that was "EXCELLENT."
Just took my first "official" typing test since probably junior high. 75 wpm. (69 when adjusted for errors.) Yay me?
RT @1500ESPN_Reusse: ... People who post on newspaper Websites are miserable pricks.
OK, I noticed OAK's Reddick using Flight of the Valkyries earlier this year, but STL's Matt Holliday's walk-up is Big Show's music? Odd.
@jenipear ...rub the lotion on the skin?
@jenipear You would know.
@jenipear What do you have against plants?
@jenipear I would like to thank you for that tweet, by the way.
@jenipear With all due respect.
@jenipear Please refer to my pants-related blog post before suggesting such nonsensical ass-hattery.
Second piece of shocking library-related news: I'm not sure what this means, but it turns out I actually like Amy Grant quite a bit.
Shocking library-related news of the day: Garbage has a newish (released sometime in 2012 anyway) CD. First track verdict: Not too shabby.
Got my ears on some new to me music by Steve Winwood, the Eels, Sonic Youth, Amy Grant, Yes and They Might Be Giants.
One of the best things about moving to a new city? A new library.
@jenipear You knew what you were getting into when you decided to be the "lawyer" of the family.
@CMPunk And there's a picture of a train!
#idontbelieveinreincarnationbut Was I some @-hole New Yorker in a past life and now I'm being punished by hating the Yankee's success?
Starting to think some team is going to vastly over-pay for Raul Ibanez this off-season.
Even then, it's kinda shaky.
Said it before and I'll say it again: You're never safe against the Yankees unless you have at least a 10-run lead with two out in the 9th.
@Shredderpunto Is it bad that I read that sarcastically? "Who do you THINK will win?" yankees, btw.
It's kind of sad that such a "magical" postseason is actually making me dislike baseball. #soreloser
Has there ever been a postseason with such consistently bad play by so many closers? Awful. Just awful. #anotherblownsave
#*@$(&amp;% YANKEES! #*@$  #*@$  #*@$ #*@$ #*@$ #*@$ #*@$ #*@$ #*@$ #*@$
Don't remember much from my days covering college hockey, but getting win with only 10 saves seems like a pretty easy day to me. #gophers
Apparently you can't even # a #. Odd.
Why are there no results for ## ?
Not only does Avisail Garcia look just like Miguel Cabrera, he plays RF the same way that I imagine Cabrera would. #homerunsdefensed
Also, with that play, Garcia took over Tigers' all-time postseason HRD lead. Bad day for Craig Monroe's records. #newstats
The HRD is much more of a situational-specific play than your basic boring old home run-robbing catch.
Garcia went up like a defensive back on a hail mary pass and swatted the ball to the ground. New MLB stat: Home Runs Defensed.
I think Avisail Garcia just turned a Yankee home run into a double. Didn't make the catch, but still saved a run.
Did I hear that right? Delmon Young is the all-time postseason home run leader for the Tigers? In only his second season with the club?
You can't spell "Nationals shut down Strasburg" without I told u so. #nottheonlyreasontheylost
Games like tonight make me even more unhappy with "Mr." Bettman. DAMN YOU NHL, come back and save me from this MLB post-season nightmare!
Amazing post-season come from behind victories are not nearly as fun when the team you want to win looses every one of them.
Best I can possibly hope for is Giants/Tigers. Even in that scenario, either Delmon Young or Jose Mijares is getting a ring.
I suppose there is an outside chance DET can pull off an upset and we get a rematch of the legendary 2006 series. Yawn.
Worse yet, NYY/SF means countless, "remember when the Giants were in New York" stories. Yuck.
NYY/STL means constant talk about the two most "successful" MLB franchises of all time battling for yet another title.
One thing's for sure, I'm not looking forward to either a NYY/SF or NYY/STL series.
Go Giants?
I have NOT been a fan of this MLB post-season. Is it too much to ask for one of the teams I wanted to advance to advance? Boo.
OK, I guess the three hours worth of sleep might be an excuse. Should probably stick to politics and the spaceshuttle, though. #CNN
Kind of funny watching somebody who seems to know nothing about baseball tell me that Justin Verlander struck out 11 times last night. #CNN
Totally Werth it!
RT @the_ironsheik: fuck the Gary Bettman he deserve to eat dead dog for fucking up the nhl player
I just happen to enjoy wacky cartoons about magic dogs and candy people and kids with weird hats.
For those of you worrying, no a 12-year-old girl did not just take over my Twitter account.
Oh my glob! Adventure Time is trending.
Really nice middle-infield play by both Reds and Giants. Fun game.
#thelongesttwitterhashtagtrendthingeeeveriswhattisisseemskindoflongiknowbutreallywhenyouthinkaboutititsnoteventhefullyallotted140characters
I'm still not completely sure how hash-tag/trends work, but shouldn't the hash-tag at least be fewer than the allotted 140 characters?
Not sure what this sound is that the Reds keep playing. It's like the start of Macho Man's music but it never gets there. Frustrating.
@jenipear I guess what I'm saying is, I dislike this guy, but not for the reason the paper wants me to.
@jenipear My problem is that the headline and quote make him out to be some sleazeball predator, not the ignorant paranoid he seems to be.
@jenipear As if a married person could never rape their spouse? Again, I'm not saying the guy is right.
@jenipear The father also seems to think that marriage is some type of rape-accusation shield?
@jenipear Sadly, yes. I think that was his point. His father was telling him to be careful/paranoid about who he sleeps with.
@jenipear The quote was a stupid way to cap a father's cautionary, paranoid tale about premarital sex, not a celebration of rape.
@jenipear I just think that in this instance the line that is being focused on is making us miss the point of what he was saying.
@jenipear Not sure I understand what you're saying. I don't like the comment either. I'm just not a fan of election-season "reporting."
@jenipear Dumb comment from a person w/poor judgement. It's being pushed as news now, almost a year later, because it's election season.
@jenipear Yes really. How is possible to make that statement worse? It's a horrible thing to say.
@jenipear How did he make it worse?
@jenipear As a former journalist, I'm concerned w/ what I consider a sensationalistic story seemingly designed mainly to create controversy.
@jenipear Can't I be upset with both?
@jenipear We both agree this guy's an idiot. I'm just not a fan of this type of journalism.
@jenipear I will agree that anyone stupid enough to say this to a reporter while in office is not someone I would trust making decisions.
@jenipear I'm not sure what legislation he is making based on this, all I read is the one story you linked to.
@jenipear For the man's father, sadly, yes. He came from a different time. Take the content of the story and remove the offensive words.
@jenipear Obviously the statement alone is reprehensible. Idiot should have more sense than to repeat something like that in an interview.
@jenipear Also, remember the source. He's quoting his father. People from that generation are naturally not going to be as PC as we are.
@jenipear From what I read, it's a stupid, offensive phrase describing an unlikely scenario.
@jenipear After reading the story, it sounds more like a case of election season "Gotcha!" journalism than an example of an evil lawmaker.
Wondering if re-tweeting the Iron Sheik is advisable.
That is all. Thank you.

@jenipear The really sad thing is that song would be at least tolerable without the auto-tune. But with it, it literally makes me cringe.
I had forgotten exactly why I had such an aversion to Faith Hill, then that song was kind enough to remind me.
@jenipear Yesterday I was re-exposed to the monstrosity that Faith Hill released in 1999 "The Way You Love Me."
@jenipear MLBNetwork just used some awful example from a band I'd never heard of that I've mercifully already forgot for the Nats/Cards.
@jenipear This is the second time in 24 hours my ears have been unexpectedly assaulted with it.
In a related note, 1998 sure did produce some horrible music.
So that feeling I get when I hear auto-tune, is that what people felt in the 80s with synthesizers?
Something I learned today: I am not a fan of the phrase "hugely entertaining." Not sure why, just find it kind of wickedly uninspired.
@1500ESPN_Reusse Just saw this myself. You seem to be a WWE Classics on Demand subscriber. Mackey must be a really bad influence.
I hope Greg Biffle stops by the studio and makes him do the Charleston.
And now it's NASCAR Now hosted by...THE COACH!!!!!!! Wait...what?
They're not being very nice to the KHLers either. Is it common practice for ESPN announcers to mock the game they are covering?
Oh I see, Ovechkin is playing. Never mind. I get it now.
It's almost like ESPN doesn't like the NHL.
Plus in the 10 minutes I've been watching, all the announcers are doing is putting the NHL down and complaining about the lockout.
Why is KHL hockey on ESPN2? They can't be bothered to show the NHL, but now that there's a lockout they rub it in and cave to the Russians?
@jenipear By which he apparently actually meant "13-year-old" niece.
@jenipear @thelizparade Oh sure, but I think I forgot. At least they are the oldest.
@jenipear You're asking the wrong guy. I don't even know how old she is. That year does sound close though.
@jenipear Well at least I've got that to be thankful for. I didn't want to think I was getting that senile already.
My second thought was a direct quote from @thelizparade regarding my most recent birthday: "Oooooooooooooooold."
My first thought upon receiving the request: "Isn't 9 a little young for Facebook?"
Time to turn the internal censors on on Facebook, just got a friend request from my 13-year-old niece.
@WWEArmstrong Solid 8. Sheamus/Barrett was nice. Punk/McMahon a pleasant surprise. Epico/Primo not completely squashed. JBL is always fun.
Yeah! GO O's!

Gary Spivey...of the Psychic Companions Network? What are you doing here?
While scanning through friends' Facebook posts today, Gary Spivey came up. Proving nothing is immune from wrestling: http://t.co/gdHkgd0R
This game isn't over yet. Aaron Altherr with a solo shot and the lead is down to 7.
So these Canadians that are out there embarrassing the Germans aren't even necessarily going to be on the team they field in the actual WBC?
@jenipear No, just focusing on my internet presence. Also enjoying my last do nothing day for a week. Also my knee hurts a bit. Also bored.
@jenipear HUSTLE
@jenipear Yeah, but with Toby on the team at least you know they're going to get after it.
Check it out.	http://t.co/UKmj2qNp
Perhaps the most interesting thing about Bobby Korecky: the integral part he played in the origin story of Shredder Punto.
Good to see Korecky getting another chance. Not one of my 30 most forgettable Twins, but he was on the short list: http://t.co/qb5zv8mN
Seriously, this is kind of sad. 7-0 after former pitcher Adam Loewen just rocked the first German out of the bullpen for a three-run homer.
Tosoni grounds out. I guess that's one thing Germany has going for them.
4-0. Why does Canada have to qualify anyway?
Hmm...Canada up 2-0 already? Still...GO GERMANY!
Announcers were just kind enough to inform me that Canada's starting pitcher Andrew Albers is also in the Twins system. Still, GO GERMANY!
Really interesting WBC qualifier today. Canada, featuring Rene Tosoni vs. Germany featuring Max Kepler and Toby Gardenhire! Go Germany!
@jenipear Sign me up.
I wonder how much of the cost of Apple products goes to paying for "news" stories about the newest Apple products.
@thelizparade Yes, but I wonder how much it weighs. Do you think you could give me an estimate without picking it up?
Watching Christmas Vacation. Thinking "This is an old movie." Realizing it came out same year as Simpsons debut. Confronting own mortality.
Do hockey players think all of the worlds problems can be solved by growing a beard?
@JoeyStyles @JohnCena @wwe So this leaves an opening for Juan Cena to make his triumphant return next Monday, yes?
@jenipear Oh no. Please tell me you're just clearing your throat and you're not getting sick again.
Thinking about starting a Breathe cover band.
I knew they remade King Kong. I didn't know Jack Black was in it. I'm more than a little upset that Jack Black was not cast as Kong himself.
@JerryLawler @WWE @JCLayfield Don't worry about missing a few shows, King, just get healthy. JBL will do great, he always does.
A) When did the Sox sign Dan Johnson? B) Why haven't the Twins given him a chance yet?
@1500ESPN_Reusse I believe the answer to that question is two-fold: 1) Drew Butera. 2) Nick Punto.
I thought Frank Thomas retired years ago, turns out he just changed his name to Dayan. Do they call him "The Little Hurt?" They should.
@justinjelinek O...M...F...G SO JEALOUS!
@jenipear only the cute ones
@justinjelinek If you're going to be betting hypothetical betting units, might as well switch to raw and watch a hypothetical sport.
@jenipear Thats funny, I watch the voice for christina, too.
@jenipear Hopefully that helped.
@jenipear NO! DON'T DO IT!
@jenipear DO IT DO IT DO IT
Only Bill Clinton could not only get away with, but get cheered for publicly hitting on the president's wife.
LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWW!!!!!
@jenipear You best not be gettin near no pigs.
Thank you Mighty Mighty Bosstones for once again proving that I can't hear more than 30 seconds of you without feeling good.
@jenipear So, what I'm gathering based solely on your Twitter activity today is that yes, yes you did have coffee this morning.
@jenipear Still wanna go?
Not sure how I feel about these feelings, but I'm actually kind of enjoying Ron Coomer's time in the booth.
@jenipear I've been waiting for the storm all day. It's been lightly raining here for about an hour now. Kind of disappointed.
Of course, I did feel a little bit better once I actually clicked on the thing and the first five posts were complaining about it.
Who is this Much person? Can I follow them? I'm sure I would love to get their take on the important issues of the day. #ThingsISayToMuch
Another reason the grammar stickler in me feels dirty every time I use Twitter. This is the top US trend? #ThingsISayToMuch
The man is passionate about baseball...and easily excitable.
Popped into the kitchen just in time to hear Dick Bremer excitedly screaming. Not sure whether I missed a great play or a routine grounder.
Just checked in on the Cubs-Brewers game on WGN and, yup, Carlos Gomez is still Carlos Gomez.
Bartolo Colon: Once again proving that if something seems to good to be true, it probably is.
Now we just need to convince someone to give Terry Tiffee another chance.
Somehow I missed the Neshek to Oakland news. Glad he's back in the majors, looks like he'd been putting up some good numbers in AAA.
A triple play AND a Neshek sighting? It's times like these I'm almost happy to be unemployed.
Watching Twins game, pretty sure Josh Reddick's walk-up music is Daniel Bryan's entrance theme.
Hey comedy central, do you not want me to watch your programming? Pick a schedule and stick with it. Grrrrrr
@justinjelinek In the bedroom?
@Buster_ESPN Still won't stop everyone. Somebody will always think they're special, the rules don't apply to them or they won't get caught.
http://t.co/yqAhx841 Some of the best advice I've ever received.
@justinjelinek then my work here is done.
@jenipear BALLS
@justinjelinek @CNN Who is Paul Ryan?
This just in: NICK PUNTO HAS CLEARED WAIVERS!
@justinjelinek Bazinga?
@RobotOwl After putting an hour into applying for a job that I'm not even that interested in, that question pushed me over the edge.
"What was the reason when the outcome of a project or task with which you were involved did not meet your expectations?"-Huh?
I don't think Bert is a fan of Nishi's baseball skill set.
Granted, I feel much worse for Duensing, but still...
At this point, I just feel bad for Nishi.
Cleveland uses the Mario coin noise when they score a run, I think the Indians are telling me to turn back to the Olympics.
Wood chippers are loud.
Wait a minute, it's legal for MLB games to start before noon? Darn time zones, now I missed Cleveland's only offense for the day.
Is it racist to be amused that one of the Italian volleyball players is named Luigi? If so, as with most things in life, I blame Nintendo.
@jenipear Hey, it's the Olympics. Everybody experiments a little bit, right?
@jenipear I miss Jennie Finch making fools look foolish on This Week in Baseball.
Not sure who I think is more likely to get gold here, but I gotta think smart money is either on Duralast or esurance.
Ok, that time it was at least 90 seconds worth of game.
NBC Sports Network just came back to France/Spain basketball for like two seconds and then jumped right back to a commercial mid sentence.
I've been trying not to join the multitudes complaining about Olympics coverage, but...
@justinjelinek @MarcusMichalik See, this is where being unemployed comes in really handy. My days are free to check out water polo and such.
@AaronGleeman I am so glad I'm not the only one that does that.
@realMickFoley Don't forget the best power walk in the business.
@AaronGleeman Yeah, but still...BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
@realMickFoley @WWE No tie-dye, please.
http://t.co/GEuQHJJQ Is this a sign to go home and have lunch or to explore further?
Well that answers that question. http://t.co/hwCuRtIk
The good news is I'm not lost. The bad news is I have no idea where I am. http://t.co/QjNWHGmg
@howardfinkel Wow! What an excellent PG celebrity to affiliate yourselves with!
@jenipear I think what you're trying to say is: The Twins MIGHT be willing to part with their ACE for the right package of top prospects.
@jenipear WTF? Why would you say that about me?
To reiterate: HAMMER TIME!
HAMMER TIME!
0-0 after 2? We got ourselves a hockey game.
@jenipear YES! YES! YES! #D-BRY
Dick Bremer does NOT approve of "pimping" after an at bat.
Addendum: I am computering left-handed. THAT is all. Thank you.
I'm in Duluth. That is all.
@justinjelinek You're a good call.
"There's something wrong with what my Malibu Stacy says."
Is Daniel Bryan the best heel going today? YES! YES! YES! #RAW
RT @SouhanStrib: I offer this with no comment: Nick Punto is batting sixth for the Red Sox today. Sixth. 6th. As in, after the fifth spo ...
@RobotOwl I didn't think so before, but this has always been a pretty reputable news source: http://t.co/0WXg0woG. Thought you should know.
Today everyone wears 42. Mo Rivera is greatest closer of all time, still a little odd for MLB to honor an active player in such a manner.
Good job, new Nicky.
When I predicted in January that the Wild would end up between 7th and 11th, I was not referring to draft position.
Yankees 3rd base coach is to blame for that out. Why would you send Swisher there?
How did not know Carrot Top was a member of the 3 Stooges?
Don't be a bully. You know, like by making fun of someone because of a family member's dependency problems. Way to stay on point, WWE.
Can't quite figure out what Jericho is doing to himself, but he looks like he's lost an almost unhealthy amount of weight.
@nebbs85 And here I thought both the T and the A were referring to Trish.
CHOO CHOO! Make way for the ATrain!
SA-fricking-BU? IN ONALASKA! Oh no, poor Jen.
Oh, wait, I am. And that's the problem.
I'm not familiar with the type of thing I'm seeing.
Will all due respect to his actual son; if WWE were considering a Mr. Perfect II gimmick, I would strongly suggest Dolph Ziggler.
@jenipear @nebbs85 I agree on the capsule. Especially after Cena asked how he looked. But I disagree about it being stupid.
Potatoes?
"Here's some money. Go see a Star War."
Astrosmania runnin' wild!
E5 for Cuddy's first Colorado PA? We'll take it.
Rookie phenom Powerful Paul Goldschmidt!
Tim Lincecum's hair causes me to have strange feelings.
Chrispy Young with the first home run I've seen this season. Go DBags! I mean, Backs.
Darn you free Extra Innings preview. You're making me seriously reconsider being a responsible adult.
Todd Helton: my favorite non-Twin not named Nick Punto.
And two batters in, DBacks fans have become acquainted with both Kubes' lack of range and his excellent arm. Enjoy that Arizona.
Have fun in the desert Kubes. Enjoy your World Series.
Good luck in Colorado, Cuddy! Beat those Stros.
Jose Valverde, you are a character.
With that hair and that uniform, is it any wonder I keep having to remind myself that Prince Fielder is not Dmitri Young?
Can't believe I've missed first 5 innings of Nats/Cubs. Why would you hide this game Extra Innings? WHY?
And the first blown call of the season goes to Phil Cuzzi. Pastronicky already getting all the calls.
Jhonny socring teh frist rnu fro teh 2102 Tgiers. Ncie jbo!
Congratulations Pastronicky. I told you not all pitchers were Johan-esque.
Finally a run! Some nice pitching from everybody on Opening Day Day.
Five strong innings for Johan. Very nice to see.
89 errors since 2006, most among MLB 2B in that time? Thanks again, SNY, for proving my "Uggla is Beastly in the Field" theory. DH by 2016?
Erik Bedard holding the Phillies scoreless through two. Good sign for Pittsburgh.
Welcome to the bigs Tyler Pastronicky. The good news is you don't have to face Johan Santana every day.
Best part about free opening week Extra Innings preview? That it is bundled with a free Center Ice preview.
Can Hunter Pence provide the anchor an aging and ailing Phillies lineup will need to remain the dominant team in the NL?
Prepare yourself America, the 2012 Pittsburgh Pirates are HERE!
So which David Wright will the Mets get this year? Elite or excuse?
Only 2B in history to begin career with 6 20+ HR seasons? Thanks, SNY, for confirmation of my "Dan Uggla is a Beast" theory.
Not sure, but Papi's not looking quite as Big to me this year. Did I miss the Best Shape of His Life story on him?
The Wiggle has returned.
Welcome back Johan!
WTF, Boston? Not starting Punto on opening day? Remember that when trying to figure out why you finished behind the Jays this year.
First pitch to Austin Jackson, smoked into center for a single: AL Central race is over before it even started.
Happy 50th Mets!
@jenipear And I think the Twins should be playing today. But that's just my opinion.
@nebbs85 You leave the Great Khali alone.
Can't pinpoint the exact moment I became a Cena mark, but apparently I'm officially there. Could be worse: could have me cheering for Orton.
Yet another nostalgia act that I will find myself cheering against in his war with John Cena.
It's Minnesota Vikings defensive lineman Brock Lesnar!
@nebbs85 Bingo
I don't understand what kind of person it takes to boo Cena.
@nebbs85 I'm not sure what it is about her, but at least three times in the past three days I have seen her and asked, "Who is that?"
Much like vanilla ice cream, Eve makes me both bored and sick to my stomach.
I'm confused, was that Abraham Washington? And if so, where was Tony Atlas?
@mjgeiger128 @nebbs85 But also had such a short match?
@mjgeiger128 @nebbs85 But I guess it wouldn't be Wrestlmania without something for the hardcore fans to complain about.
@nebbs85 I think it was just a really unsatisfying pay off to what could have been a really good program. A waste of two true talents.
@nebbs85 No doubt about that. Whole thing was handled poorly. When's the last time a Rumble winner not only opened Mania?
@nebbs85 To be fair, I'm not sure how a win like that is supposed to get him over with the fans. One might even argue it was a cheap win.
Sheamus is champion? NO! NO! NO!
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 @jenipear I can still cheer for Jack Swagger though, right?
So, Tony Atlas and Chris Masters had a baby and named him David Otunga's entrance?
YES! YES! YES!
@jenipear @thelizparade I feel the same way about Batman and Robin.
Come on MLB Network. Don't give me a news update about the 6th inning of a game I'm watching during the 4th inning. #spoileralert
I find it interesting that D-Bry is the heel in a feud with Sheamus, despite giving up aprox. 3 feet and 200 pounds to the Great White.
Just a tad upset about missing what I assume was another awesome Cena promo. Wild better hold on to this one...
@jenipear @thelizparade And cellphone cameras. I want to see Blair Witch-style footage of your ascent into madness.
@jenipear Not that I agree with the bill. Sometimes  you just have to live with the bad decisions you make in life.
@nebbs85 @jenipear Does he wash himself with a rag on a stick?
Only logical conclusion I could come to: this editorial planted to discredit supporters of the bill mentioned within. http://t.co/JdTuTfx2
@nebbs85 The skeptic in me is finding it pretty difficult to believe that such a match would actually come to fruition at this juncture.
Can anyone tell me what "brand" anyone is on anymore? This brand split was stupid and confusing already five years ago.
Once again, the main event starts off RAW. Good luck topping that, Rock.
That's right, "two faced-rappers walk away with four shiners."
So, you think you're untouchable?
Somebody call animal control, apparently we've got members of the dog pound watching the Wolves game next door.
Wait, so if Teddy wins, Kane gets to assault Aksana? Huh? Say wuh?
@jenipear @RobotOwl And yes, by the rest, I mean "The Professor" Mike Tenay and Mariann(a Komlo).
@jenipear @RobotOwl Undertaker...Papa Shango...Boogeyman...Kevin (the Vampire) Thorn...Gangrel...Vampiro...and the rest...
@RobotOwl @jenipear Professional wrestling has a long and storied history with its supernatural characters:
@RobotOwl @jenipear Ghost wrestlers?
He's been wearing it for a month now, but I still have no idea what Ziggler's shirt says.
I wonder if this is the first non-elimination chamber steel cage match for Santino.
@jenipear At least you won't be watching wrestling in bed.
Elvis Costello on Colbert tonight. So much for going to bed early!
@RobotOwl We're OWL exterminators.
@PatNeshek Willie Eyre?
@jenipear @nebbs85 What does Ted DiBiase have to do with anything?
@nebbs85 @jenipear Almost feel bad for Rock. Too long away from live entertainment. Needs to get back into the game full-time to get better.
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl Looks like business is about to pick up, here comes Kane.
"We didn't stop fighting until the fighting was done!"-yeah, sure the Rock's still got it. Sure he does. Whatever you say.
@nebbs85 What do you weigh? Is it possible to double as a barbell?
@nebbs85 Yuk. You could come over and watch a classic Mania earlier that night. Or there's always the 2 hours of sleep option.
@nebbs85 Because they hate you and don't want your money.
First time I ever saw D-Bry in the ring: Feb. 23, 2010 episode of NXT. His first opponent: Jericho. http://t.co/PZUpkQAt
@nebbs85 April 1.
Whenever I see Jason Marquis, I'm a little dissapointed that he isn't Ryan Dempster.
@nebbs85 @jenipear @mjgeiger128 Y'all feel like hanging out tonight?
BASEBALL!!!!!!
The Price is wrong bitch!
@RobotOwl @jenipear @nebbs85 Feel free to make it up to me by bringing your hubby over on Sundays for some old school wrestling.
@RobotOwl @jenipear @nebbs85 I guess you're right. You owe me big time,
@nebbs85 You most certainly do not owe us for pizza.
@nebbs85 That's what I'd been thinking all night. Card does look great, but then I remember paying for the Rumble.
The Rock=All sizzle-no steak.
Can't remember the last time I was tempted to order a ppv to see someone get their butt "kicked."
Never been so happy to not be able to see John Cena.
ROCKY SUCKS!
Stupid Rock, forcing the rightful last segment of RAW to the first segment. Confusing.
@justinjelinek @jenipear Upsetting news. Even more upsetting, based on J's setup, was that this news had nothing at all to do with pigs.
@nebbs85 even cody looked like he landed on his arm funny
@nebbs85 saw the elimination while watching the tape. Looked pretty nasty, surprised he was the only one hurt
@jenipear I would prefer Guy Incognito
@nebbs85 Let me know if you  are JUST LOOKING for a "manager".
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl Thanks for a great time guys. The show was awesome! Sheamus is going down at Mania.
@nebbs85 sweet
@nebbs85 BRYAN!
@nebbs85 so many choices. cole, laurinitis, vickie, eve...
@nebbs85 I dont think so. I think sd is live tomorrow
@jenipear @SOTSOHockey @mjgeiger128 keep waiting...
@nebbs85 Cant wait. Are we getting together before the show?
@jenipear @RobotOwl And Lou Diamond Phillips. And Keifer Sutherland.
@RobotOwl @jenipear OK, maybe during his brief cameo in Young Guns II.
@jenipear @RobotOwl You lost me on that one.
@jenipear Mine either.
@PatNeshek 619?
@PatNeshek 202?
@PatNeshek Is it the Gwinnett Braves?
@PatNeshek Richmond Flying Squirrels?
@nebbs85 So you say everyone wins?
Why did no one tell me there was a new Ghost Rider movie?
@nebbs85 Good news is it probably won't actually happen.
@nebbs85 @jenipear @RobotOwl So, let's hear your Rumble picks.
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl @jenipear And I say forget you guys and your point system. I demand a playoff!
@nebbs85 @jenipear I already hate myself for asking this, but: Like Donkey Kong?
Regal just quoted Grand Master Flash! Classic.
REGAL! Now we're going to be entertained!
@nebbs85 @jenipear Not only Smackdown #1 Announcer, Funaki, but fellow announcer Mike Chioda as well?
Wait a minute, Truth's glasses don't even have lenses in them! I guess wrestling just might be fake after all.
@nebbs85 @jenipear Here's an interesting list of wellness policy violators. http://t.co/T9Zylnb7
@nebbs85 @jenipear Why can't you guys just RISE ABOVE your obvious jealousy-fueled HATE of John Cena and admit that he is all natural?
@jenipear @nebbs85 Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton beg to differ.
@nebbs85 http://t.co/o5McbajQ Random Marcy Playground song. Tell me THAT doesn't sound the same.
@nebbs85 I guess so. You wanna hear something weirdly similar: Mick Foley's theme: http://t.co/TAvK1P3v.
@nebbs85 @jenipear @RobotOwl @justinjelinek Ass Mode.
@nebbs85 I'm gonna say it's just you. That's probably because I had a firmly established opinion of Punk's song before he started using it.
There you go, hellfire AND brimstone for you. Enjoy.
@nebbs85 @jenipear Jericho's top 10 of all time when you factor in the total package for sure.
@nebbs85 @jenipear Great Highlight Reel. Now go away again.
@jenipear @nebbs85 Did Lawler just say "Shoot one off in Cole's mouth?" That is decidedly NOT PG.
@jenipear The blind squirrel theory?
I know this can't be the truth, but that felt like the most definitive win on the season so far for the Wild. Good job.
@nebbs85 More than Michael Cole?!
@justinjelinek Thanks again for letting us be a part of that. It was neat seeing you on the ice at the X.
@RobotOwl @jenipear @nebbs85 But obviously the Jews weren't in the desert for 40 years. This was just their way to explain alien abduction.
@justinjelinek You have the chance to watch my debut as a sports videographer yet?
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 Is the cat breathing? Audibly?
Heatley is still on the team? I thought they traded him two months ago.
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 I agree, 5 hours is nowhere near enough. If you would like to borrow some tapes or DVDs, I can hook you up.
@nebbs85 @jenipear @RobotOwl So when are we going to get togeter and have our joint Simpsons/Wrestling/ghost crack viewing marathon?
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl So you weren't "doin' it," but YOU had YOUR fun. I think we are starting to understand.
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 Come on, if it weren't for Niall's Twitter account, I would never have even heard of you.
@justinjelinek @Angelbear82711 I'm sure she was going to say "Holy Shepherd, thank you for these wondrous events." God bless hockey.
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl Somebody needs to stop acting like such an adult and lower their comedic standards.
They're BAAAAAAAAAAAACK
@Angelbear82711 Clutterbuck SMASH...I mean SCORE
@nebbs85 @RobotOwl "Our bedroom smells like meat"--One of the more popular brand names of "old man candy."
@jenipear A Wild goal and Ott gets Powed? I'm pretty sure you're already considering this a moral victory, regardless of final score.
@nebbs85 Yes, yes. The important question is, how well do you know Finlay?
@RobotOwl @jenipear In the name of good taste...must...resist...urge to make...inappropriate...comment on use of phrase: "old man candy."
@RobotOwl Have you tried digging at it with tweezers like a splinter? Or gnawing at it like a splinter? Or freezing it like gum in hair?
@nebbs85 Growing as a Jimmy Hart-style manager, for sure. Which is good, we need more of them. Not half the wrestler D-Bry is, though.
Truly one of the best periods I've seen the Wild play in weeks.
Congratulations to the Wild for ALMOST making it through one period without trailing.
@justinjelinek	Remember when Nick at Nite used to be cool? Me-TV does. Do you get this channel? http://t.co/jJxTZkHq
@nebbs85 That's true. He's more of a mascot.
@nebbs85 As long as the other "real" people around you don't mind it you should be safe. For now. Physically. I think.
@nebbs85 ALL THE TIME! I don't mind though, cause it's usually just me talking to myself about myself. I find me to be very self-centered.
@nebbs85 If I can be serious for a minute; I agree with you completely. Great in-ring skills. Mic skills-serviceable at best.
@nebbs85 Good point. I'm thinking they probably think pretty highly of him, too.
@justinjelinek @jenipear I don't see how that's relevant.
@nebbs85 What's that you say? Daniel Bryan is as good as it gets? I agree. Well spoken, sir.
@justinjelinek @jenipear Strong words from a man who couldn't even bother to say "hi" to me when he was here earlier.
@nebbs85 I guess you're entitled to your opinion, as long as you can admit that he is the absolute best wrestler in the world ever.
@jenipear Not sure why you didn't want to watch the Betty White tribute, but this kiss up to Cullen is OK. Where are your priorities?
@nebbs85 So, you admit he's the best available option?
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 The fact that you can't enjoy another culture's commercials makes me question your commitment to this marriage.
@nebbs85 Thank you for putting it out there. Now you just go ahead and shove it right back where it belongs.
I know it's wrong that I want to see Kane destroy this woman, but I don't care.
@jenipear @RobotOwl Getting back down was sometimes a problem. Sometimes I had to get him down. He couldn't always get down on his own.
@jenipear @RobotOwl Ziggy used to climb the big tree in the back yard all the time without his front claws.
Y2J's 2nd "interview" back already better than 1st thanks to fully-functioning light-up jacket.
@RobotOwl @jenipear So you're saying he's built up an immunity?
So WWE Hall is inducting the 4 Horsemen as a unit? Does this mean Sting is in the HoF? Paul Roma? Pillman? Luger? Malenko?...Benoit???
@nebbs85 @jenipear Austin Aries. He went to Winona State University for a couple of years, so that was the local angle.
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 Well, I thought I saw Hulk Hogan on a roller coaster once.
Wait, he's a Flash Funk knock off and the best finishing move they can come up with is a cross-body block?
FINALLY! The return of the Funkets!
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 "Go along with" roughly translates to:  Cheers for Sheamus, laughs at Santino Marella and ogles John Morrison.
@RobotOwl @nebbs85 Methinks she doth protest too much.
@nebbs85 I believe that he is.
@nebbs85 @jenipear @RobotOwl It truly is the world's greatest form of entertainment not involving mongooses.
All right, kids, pay attention. It's time for your weekly wrestling lesson, courtesy of Professor Bryan.
Coincidentally, I consider the WWE Hall to be immeasurably more legitimate than that joke in Canton.
Congratulations to Edge on being inducted into a Hall of Fame that I consider only slightly less credible than the one in Cooperstown.
@nebbs85 @jenipear l call the big one bitey.
What's the matter Chris? Lion got your tongue?
Jericho knows this isn't a house show, right?
And with that, it is officially official, wrestling is officially fun again.
@jenipear I hear they have a world-renowned Department of Redundancy Department.
A...d...v...e...n...t...u...r...e...T...i...WHAT THE HELL IS THIS SHIT?!?
I may need to cut back on my Futurama consumption. Every time announcers mention Claude Giroux, I can't help but think of Nixon's head.
Dinner with carl sagan and cheech marin, wonderful!
Well that was the most fun I've had watching RAW in a long time. If only Michael Cole hadn't been involved.
Zach Ryder sounds like Chris Kanyon.
Look in the ring, Internet: YOU WIN.
@nebbs85 It's pretty low budget, but worth checking out next time you have a free saturday night
@nebbs85 It's on right now if you get the CW (ch. 8 for us).
@nebbs85 What about ROH, have you given them a chance at all?
Hello. His name is Al Montoya. You scored on his father. Prepare to be shut out for the first period.
Hockey-yup. HolyGrail for commercial flipping-yup. New 6-pack-yup. Stored PT allowing earlyout from work-yup. What a way to start a weekend!
@jenipear Can't believe you're missing NHL debut of Jarod Palmer.
@jenipear @nebbs85 Well obviously, wrestling hasn't been the same since the good old days (1996-2006).
@jenipear @nebbs85 Come on Jen, don't be ashamed to admit you're a fan. Be proud of who you are.
I wonder what we'll be thinking of Hellickson, Kimbrel and company in 2016. My guess is Verlander will still be out-pitching them all.
And, unlike other flash-in-the-pan winners (2002-04, I'm looking at you), your 2006 ROYs are still providing superstar-level production.
NL runner-ups: Ryan Zimmerman, Uggla, Josh Johnson, Cain, Ethier, Fielder, Russel Martin, Anibal Sanchez and Willingham!
How good was 2006 rookie class? Following elegibles did not win ROY: Paplebon, Liriano, Jered Weaver, Markakis, Kinsler. And that's just AL!
@nebbs85 Unfortunately, to me, it seems like they've only gotten worse. Before Hogan got involved, I watched it a lot more than I do now.
@jenipear @nebbs85 Hopefully he skips that mess and goes straight to ROH, where I think his style would work very well. He's fun to watch.
@nebbs85 Yeah, a lot of the guys are really talented. It's just reminds me too much of the dying days of WCW. No structure, no logic.
@jenipear @thelizparade Well now I don't feel so bad for saying Alicia Fox is purty.
@nebbs85 Yes to the first and I really want to be, but am not to the second. I have tried, but been dissappointed almost every time
@Angelbear82711 But...but...you were an egg! I guess if you must present yourself in human form, then yes, this is an excellent choice.
Congrats to J.C. Romero on supposedly impending deal with Cardinals. Hard to believe he's only 35.
By the way: Nick Punto hit .278 last year. Yastrzemski? Not one single hit.
Trip? Slash? Interference? Take your pick refs!
Wild fans rightfully tripping over lack of call.
Staubitz takedown of Carcillo: That's 5 points in the Brawl for All tournament.
Did you know: 18.2% of all San Diego Padres home runs hit since 2009 can be directly attributed to right-hander Kyle Blanks.
Did you know: Despite not being drafted until 42nd round, Kyle Blanks has provided Padres at least 120 PA in each of the last 3 seasons.
@jenipear Thanks, just trying to get the facts out there. Can't argue with the truth.
Yastrzemski only good enough to play for 1 MLB team in his career. Nick Punto's talents utilized by 4(, appreciated and coveted by 30).
World Series rings: Nick Punto: 1/Carl Yastrzemski: 0. That's what you call a championship pedigree.
Carl Yastrzemski played respectable 5 different positions during 22 year career. Punto has played 6 in 10 years. Versatility edge to Punto.
Need a reason Red Sox should un-retire #8 for Punto? Try this on: Yastrzemski's career fielding percentage at 3B--.897. Punto's--.974.
6'5" right-handed pitcher Rick Vanden Hurk posted a 0.79 WHIP in 15.2 innings of rookie ball in 2006 before being promoted to high-a ball.
Did you know: Netherlandeer Rick Vanden Hurk represented the Nerherlands in the last World Baseball Classic.
Fun hockey word: moorings
Never understood the idea of sportsmanship as it relates to hockey fights.
@Angelbear82711 you're an egg!
More motivational bald man: mike yeo or sgt slaughter?
Nickleback on WWE? Faceoff on intermission report? Bring on the 80s @ 8! Thecooltv rocks!
Hot jetshers crowd acting like they haven't had a team to cheer for the last decade or so
@jenipear intervention time: you agreed with michael cole
My least favotite part of hockey: constant reminders of the nonexistence of twin cities tim horton's
Boy, will everyone be upset once commercials magically transform hockey to wwe
Hockey...twitter...wild...tweeting...jetshers...assmode
@nebbs85 @jenipear But...but...but...HE'S BIG!
@jenipear @RobotOwl @nebbs85 @justinjelinek Oh yes, Justin deserves nothing but the best wrasslin' related twits.
@nebbs85 @jenipear Really? No love for Showkishi?
@nebbs85 @jenipear @wyshynski I think you're vastly underrating a certain giant by the name of Big Show with that comment.
I know, I'm going to wait until 9 PM to start playing my guitar! I'll be the most popular jerk in the whole apartment complex!
Word life! This is basic thuganomics.
@JoeyStyles @Zack @WWEDanielBryan @HeelZiggler Certainly. 4 future world champions. The question is with what company?
@jenipear tru dat playa tru dat
Trend trend trend trend trend
@jenipear Also, we would not have been communicating with each other via Instant Messenger while sitting 10 feet away from each other.
@jenipear And loving it!
HHH out w/sledgehammer to cut promo on Kevin Nash! Lita! Booker T! Mick Foley! I knew if felt kind of 2003ish when I woke up this morning.
I find it kind of odd that they have had 2 awards with names so closely associated w/Joey Styles, but can't be bothered to use him on-air.
@justinjelinek @Angelbear82711 @RobotOwl @jenipear @nebbs85 Too bad for you, even the Muppets will be on wrestling tomorrow.
I guess so.
Is it too much to ask for a 3-on-1 beat down here?
LITA! LITA! LITA!
Here's wishing Casey McGehee and the Pirates the best. Hopefully a fresh start works out for both player and organization.
I assume I am wrong in assuming the Best of the King of the Ring DVD means they are bringing the tournament (or even better, the PPV) back?
So wait, you have have Road Dogg and John Cena on hand, you have a rap battle and you use Michael Cole and...JR?
2011 Craig Counsell teammate: LaTroy HAWKins.	1995 Craig Counsell teammate: JayHAWK Owens.	Coincidence?	Probably.
WWE: If you don't have the balls to say the word "shit," stop using that phrase!
Sign I am old: Today's video games piss me off. They just look way too good.
Big Show and Henry with another example of Jim Cornette's famous Cyclical Wrestling Theory in action.
...or Disco Inferno...
Or the Dudleys.
Or the Sandman.
Attention WWE: It's segments like this that make me wish New Jack were around.
@jenipear Excited is one way to put it.
In 2009, Craig Counsell had a .766 OPS!
@jenipear I guess, but that lion better be proficient in the art of slapstick and pratfalls if it ever hopes to compete with Farley.
Did you know: Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin native MLBer Craig Counsell is from Wisconsin.
That's it! I finally figured it out! Chris Farley was funny because he was fat! Maybe Dane Cook should eat Carlos Mencia...
Mijares non-tendered? As bad as 2011 went, can't ignore what he brought to the table in his first 3 major league campaigns. Good luck Jose.
You know what I like about Guy Fieri? His hair. It's always on point.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Joe Webb simply does not know how to win football games.
Would it have killed one of Webb's teammates to help him tuck that shoulder pad back in? Where's the teamwork? Support your QB!
Also, the e-mail attached to the account would be helpful.
If anyone happens to remember my MySpace password, please send it to me. I seem to have forgotten.
Did you know: In 2006, Ryan Sweeney was the 6th youngest player in MLB. Of the 10 youngest players that year, 5 played for the Mariners.
Did you know: Ryan Sweeney has appeared in at least 15 major league games every season since 2006!
The Oakland A's outfield: All Sweeney all the time:	http://t.co/gRgr7GGr
Angels sign Pujols and Wilson? Rangers pick up Nathan? My AL West pick: Oakland all the way.
I've been saying it all along, maybe now some people will start to listen: Webb=Winner.
@jenipear And which of you is which in this situation?
@brooke1968 @toriihunter48 Sure he is, just without the power, average, experience, leadership, consistency, personality and charisma.
@SethTweets @DannyValencia19 Wait for the post game presser, Danny'll find himself under Gardies' bus as usual.
Truly Awesome.
Truth and Miz, however, have the potential to be the most entertaining team since Edge and Christian.
Over/under for Kingston/Bourne title reign? 7 weeks.
This just in...Ben Revere is Torii Hunter.
Oh sweet, another random pairing of guys who have nothing else to do and no established history as a team winning the tag titles. Yay.
@jenipear Who's going to want to face that battery? At least the three games either one isn't suspended or "retired" would be interesting.
@jenipear He's just the kind of distraction we need. Like I've said before, you get him and bring AJ back and...boom...instant intimidation.
@jenipear Ouch
Cubs owner says Zambrano‚Äôs days as a Cub likely¬†over http://t.co/UGqRGrU via @HardballTalk Twins' biggest off-season acquisition?
@jenipear Or you have just the right amount. Either way, I think the couch is plenty comfortable, thank you.
@jenipear You don't have enough facial fuzz.
@justinjelinek Either way, go Pirates!
@justinjelinek Either way, that second game's not starting until at least 8 and as a cranky old person in training, the thought scares me.
@justinjelinek Don't get too excited, I'm sure it's just a phase.
Looking at the MLB schedule for the day and wondering why they would start game 1 of a doubleheader at 5:05PM. Seems a little late to me.
@jenipear Come on now, be honest. Maybe just a little bit of a crackhead in there somewhere?
CAP!
Attention remaining Superbowl commercials: the gauntlet has been thrown. Gonna be hard to beat driving monkeys.
We want moore Mewelde.
While watching Ghost Hunters (instead of Game 4) I can't help but wonder, "Wasn't Kofi Kingston supposed to contribute in some way?"
Can I at least pretend?
That means the Twins' season and subsequent annual 1st round exit didn't actually happen, right?
Realized I haven't tweeted anything of substance since spring training.
@justinjelinek Yes, that's the gist of what I said.
@jenipear Looks like you went to bed just a little too early.
...no emails. :-(
Und also e-mails
Checking ze tweets
Good night J!
The bad: Twins drop spring training opener 2-1 to Red Sox. The good: Slowey 2 IP, 1 hit, 2 K/Neshek 1 IP, 1K. Looking good guys.
Went for a ride in the car. Super fun:-)
Good morning world. And hello spring training baseball! Phillies at spring training home of Yankees tonight on MLB Network, 6PM. Be there.
@justinjelinek  Prove it!
If a cow ever got the chance, he‚Äôd eat you and everyone you care about!--Random Simpson's Quote of the Day!
Just came to the realization that Ghost Hunters isn't quite as interesting when you are only half paying attention.
Just added a picture to my profile. Ain't it loverly?
Happy birthday Tone-Loc! Here's hoping your special day is filled with things to chomp on!
I'd like to send a special shout-out to all my lovely followers. So here goes: AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! HEY JEN!!!!!!
Hey, check it out: my first tweet!
