@TheNorthEstate @SRuhle @realDonaldTrump He’s making the case that men in the military are obviously rapists given the slightest opportunity. He’s bragged about grabbing pussies and barging in on teenagers dressing. And now he’s mocking a victim that was 15 when she was attacked. And all this is from HIS OWN WORDS.

Enjoying doing NOTHING after working 2 weeks straight. Now, who's gonna clean this place up? *crickets*
@CocteauBoy @CocteauBoy Ugh, the kiddo LOVES wife swap (sorry @hehe45). I just want to YELL at those people most eps!
@CocteauBoy No Terminator, no BSG - what are we watching tonight??
12th work day in a row = me staring at Twitter and pretending to work....
@DougBenson Who are you, Golditweet?
@aplusk Trying to unfollow @cnnbrk, get an error every time
@hehe45 That is the definition of Twitter, people's random thoughts
@hehe45 Were you trying to say smart-alec-iness?? "smarticalness" :)
@hehe45 Guess we scared him off
@hehe45 Yes that is what happens!
@CocteauBoy Skip to the Alist, Maggie G is the "A-List Girl" (like the Golden Globes girl - teen daughter of a star)
@MikeyPod I don't get the Liza thing, I have to admit. But, I'm not a gay man so no card to revoke.
@MikeyPod Hand it over! Troy was supposed to be my Kathy Date, where is he?? :P
@MikeyPod Are you watching Idol over new Kathy Griffin?
@CocteauBoy Was that Hedda Lettuce that went by for a second on the Alist red carpet??
@CocteauBoy Yoo hoo! Are you on Bravo yet?
Coffee = heaven
@CocteauBoy re Val B, I worked with her, I have stories. Ain't pretty. Have not seen Idol yet, too tired tonight.
Wow!! http://digg.com/d1oVwl
@MikeyPod :)
@CocteauBoy So what did u think of Adam this week? Back pain again? I still like him! Can't believe Simon gave him a standing O.
@CocteauBoy WTH??  Really?
@aplusk that must be a heavenly aroma :P
@SandyMcIlree I can't see how that would have ANYTHING to do with her leaving school. I'd have told your mom what you did!  Maybe you should
@SandyMcIlree Wow.Thought you made her look bad @ school, it just makes you look bad. Not something I'd hate you for now since you regret it
My tweets make me look like an idiot.  Must be the Idol-watching monkey in my closet, better hide the laptop tonight while I read Hemingway.
@KristenBode @HotStewart Kristen, did you give Stewart your number???
@tmcilree After I did the diabetes 3 hr test, I went to Taco Cabana and ordered one of everything. Then I almost passed out :)
@sandymcilree Everyone did something in the past they think is horrible now unless they are delusional! (and I'm dying to know what you did)
@cocteauboy My kid says at least u didn't pick Jeff!! I say you get Morgan and Lester, I get Chuck and Cake.Perfect.
@CocteauBoy The 2 eps with Cake had me laughing at myself as I like both the nerdy types and the hot warrior dudes, tossup 4 Chuck or Cake
@CocteauBoy He'd the hot British secret agent man!
@CocteauBoy Speaking of swooning, have you seen Jonathan Cake? Just saw him on a recent ep of Chuck
@CocteauBoy But how do you really feel? :P  At least he is entertaining! Wait until you get to Kris! And how much does Paula &lt;3 Adam? LMAO
@CocteauBoy U watching Idol? I'm watching Kris, you gonna swoon like you never swooned b4 baby!!
@autumnbouk I did! I thought maybe they just didn't have enough for everyone, and wanted them all to look the same, ha ha ha.
Who shot the sheriff? I don't know, but Megan just murdered Bob Marley (I'm a bit behind tonight)
@CocteauBoy Yeah, waht was up with the Race tonight??? Wish the elephant would have taken a dump on one, they were in position...

@CocteauBoy We did lights, TV, computer out here. It was fun, board games by candelight
@plaintruthiness I think that's the bottle I had last weekend....
@CocteauBoy You watch Terminator too?  I think we are TV twins separated at birth
Spiders on drugs http://tinyurl.com/yc5sas
@KristenBode I have not watched the end yet, need to get off the computer and go finish it!!  Matt and Michael were in the B3 when I stopped
@CocteauBoy Re real time Idol: ITA!! Was just in the apt gym exercising and was hating the real time version!!
Got this from a FB friend: There's only 10 kinds of people in the world: those that understand binary and those that don't.
@danecook And communion on Friday?
@plaintruthiness @CocteauBoy  It looks like it should be on the Teletubbies (or maybe that was just Troy's delivery...)
@CocteauBoy @plaintruthiness  And her HAIR in the part where she was showing them how to freak walk!!!
@SandyMcIlree I've gotten some very interesting comments on that pic! People seem to love it or hate!
@CocteauBoy Yeah, WTH is that!!  I &lt;3 the Bubble tweet, made me laugh out loud
@CocteauBoy @plaintruthiness  Where was Tyson? He was the best part of the show (I watched it last year).
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness Ahhh you've sucked me into Supermodel, had forgotten about this season
Bwaa haa haaa at Simon drawing a mustache on Paula
@sandymcilree You're just figuring this out?? OK, I'll follow Alex until he pisses me off, that happens about once a week &lt;3
@cocteauboy @plaintruthines Uh Kara, that was 7 words
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness I think Smokey is swooning over Adam too....hmmmmmmm
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness Yeah, she did OK, prolly safe after Michael, Scott and Megan's performances!!
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness I'm getting farther behind, daughter is telling me jokes she found on the internet!
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness I agree w/Randy...trainwreck!!
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness Almost caught up, Megan's starting. Why does Paula have coloring books????
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness I think Smokey is swooning too....
@cocteauboy @plaintruthiness Why is Matt dressed like a grad student?
@CocteauBoy @plaintruthiness Just getting it going here, does that mean Kris is first?
@CocteauBoy @plaintruthiness  Are we having another snarky tweet party tonight?
@KristenBode Here too, I've gotten drenched twice, was never so glad to pull into my garage!
@cocteauboy Are you Idoling tonight?
@KristenBode I'm here! :)
@cocteauboy http://twitpic.com/2e2vv - OK, wtf exactly is this supposed to be, besides WRONG!!!
OK, do you NOT put the tag in to update fb, or what.  Testing 1...2...3
Testing my selective fb update from Twitter....so I can be just like Troy! #fb
Nice lunch on the deck at La Feria, perfect perfect weather today in Austin!
@CocteauBoy Yah, they won't let it drop! Just like Stargate.  Not that I'm complaining, got my geek card a long time ago!!
@CocteauBoy I laughed, I cried, I geeked to the max. Now I just want to hear the soundtrack music again, somewhere I have BSG ringtones....
@CocteauBoy  Sadly, was on a laptop.  Need something smaller! Plus it's my work laptop, so too much like staring at what I stare at all day!
@CocteauBoy Still on BSG, no Dollhouse yet, keep pausing to play online. You think I'd get sick of the damn puter. Gotta get an iPhone.
RT LMAO  @CocteauBoy @Plattitude You are only person I've ever seen use "Dollhouse" and "Excellent" in the same sentence. lol
Finally going home!! Looking forward to last BSG ep tonight, so say we all!!!!
@margaretcho You're here in Austin??  Damn. Not braving SXSW this year.
Ugh. Still at work at 6PM on Friday. Need a cocktail!!
@CocteauBoy Peeing pix turned off the marketers?  LOL, have to try it. Maybe put something ABOUT peeing in profile would work too? :)
@plaintruthiness @CocteauBoy Overall, my fav episdoe of AI this season! Maybe it was all the snarky tweets during?
@plaintruthiness I think so!  No proof tho, lol.
RT @diablocody I want Megan Corkrey to take it all. She's like an alternate-reality Reese Witherspoon who goes to Burning Man.
@diablocody I'm a few time zones ahead, Idol is really fun tonight
@CocteauBoy OK, a white coat with the collar up? Really?!! Love his voice though
@CocteauBoy Not there yet, just saw Scott.  Boy would I love to see how Paula and Simon talk to each other with no cameras around....
RT @god: A sign of the Apocalypse! - http://is.gd/nMRC
@plaintruthiness @CocteauBoy OK, milk would have come out my nose on that one, if I was drinking milk.  And don't forget Norman Gentle!
@CocteauBoy And Ryan has to rub it in!!!!!  What a hypocrite.
@CocteauBoy OK, heading back to the TV!
@CocteauBoy And I think Paula needs a pantie change every time he performs, bwaaa haaa haaa
I work on computers, I play on computers, now I'm coveting an iPhone...do I really need to be that connected all the freakin time? :P
@CocteauBoy I've had my DVR paused for a while, came up to tweet after I saw Adam n got trapped at the puter.
RT LMAO @CocteauBoy: @marthawaters just starting 2watch.  I'm sure I'll still not like Adam. ChipNDale Forced-Hairdo Twinks don't amuse me.
@CocteauBoy ITA!!!  How adorable is he??
@CocteauBoy Are you hating on Adam again tonight? I still like him, weirdest version of Ring of Fire ever, but I liked it!
@SandyMcIlree LOL! There's always some things just off about Paula....
@BrentSpiner That's because we like you! We really like you! ;&gt;
@aplusk  Explain please! Usually it takes me a while to get past the humiliation to some deeper lesson....
@KristenBode  Yeah, what happened to warm weather? I was not prepared this morning! Should have  watched the news instead of twitter  feed.
@guerrin Wow! Send that kid right on to Project Runway.
@FakeDemetri Where does Captain Obvious fit in there??
@TheBusyBrain I think it depends. Audio of David Sedaris reading his own stuff is better for ex. Mostly I think I agree with your wife! ;)
@CocteauBoy Kris is adorable! I like Adam, love child of Freddie Mercury and Sebastian Bach. Paula is so incoherant I have to FF her bits...
@cakewrecks  What color flower has she got in her hair on this one?? She's my favorite CH host!
@SandyMcIlree Trying to think of a caption. Meanwhile, have you seen the "Turtle Rape Shoe" video? http://tinyurl.com/c4lwuf via @FilmDrunk
@CocteauBoy I don't remember that being a category at my school, did they add it just for you? Smooches!
@KristenBode I've heard him a few times, but I'm a JB & Sandy fan!
@CocteauBoy  I wondered if that was the prom! Please explain the outfit :P !!  Very cute pic.
@HotStewart sounds like a Hot mess!
@CocteauBoy Love your "application"!!
@justenveriato Those of us exhausted from the  "Spring Forward" hate you! Hawaii stays the same time, yeah?
@rainnwilson Are they still doing Jean from Fashion Bug? Work firewall blocks the Onion :(
@dougbenson Found your shoe: RT @filmdrunk MUST WATCH VIDEO: "Turtle Rape Shoe". http://is.gd/my9Z
@FilmDrunk LMFAO, and I don't even have the sound on. What DOES a turtle raping a shoe sound like????
@mrskutcher Did you just feel twitter lean? Thats cuz of all the eyes rollin' at @beasme....
Hate Daylight Savings, except in the fall when I get my freakin' hour back. Have an early meeting in the morning too. Grrrrr.
@TheBusyBrain Uh, yeah. Bad idea. Unless you love telemarketers....

Just watched Amazing Race, and was sadly not surprised that most racers had never heard of Chekhov (and I don't mean the one from Star Trek)
@iamdiddy  We feel ya!
Apparently that's $1.13 American. Damn!
Just found 100 Jamaican dollars from the 80's. Is that worth anything??  Wish I'd found something else from Jamaica....

Pace yourselves tweeple, the night is young.

So far, anticipating lunch is the high point of my day. Not as pathetic as it sounds, it involves Chuy's creamy jalapeno dressing.
@BrentSpiner Nope. It's an oxymoron. So why do I watch them?
@FilmDrunk MS v SO: Please tell me it's direct to DVD? Or VHS, even better.
@CocteauBoy Going to watch it on dvr now - I was afraid to look at twitter first in case someone spilled beans! Please not Tatiana....

@CocteauBoy Oh man! I'm shivering for you. I guess I'd be huddling by the stove (don't stick your head in).
Really feeling the pressure to be constantly clever in 140 char or less now that I'm on both facebook and twitter.
