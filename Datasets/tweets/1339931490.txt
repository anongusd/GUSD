Gunslinger teachers induced by bonus pay, won‚Äôt stop mass murders in our schools. Common sense gun laws will!
Trump‚Äôs ludicrous idea of paying bonuses to gun-toting teachers does nothing to fix the problem of gun violence in America. It just plays to the NRA‚Äôs unending chant for more and more guns.
The NRA‚Äôs panic-stricken screams for more guns cannot stop a sea of young people demanding common sense gun laws to protect our children. The future is here.
#ParklandStudentsSpeak is spreading across the country, and is so inspiring. We cannot continue allowing gun violence to devastate America. Elected officials must be accountable for their actions to stop future school schootings https://t.co/EpcyBmngrK

Thank you to all who joined my #SolutionsOnly panel. When we come to the table, focused on solutions and not rhetoric, we can make progress.
#SolutionsOnly Idea 6: Prevention &amp; education work best in the community. More resources are needed for community-centered care &amp; workers.
#SolutionsOnly Idea 5: Make sure that no one loses care, because of ACA repeal or unaffordable premiums.
#SolutionsOnly Idea 4: Protect Medicaid expansion and the ability for young people, under 26, to remain on their parents' insurance.
#SolutionsOnly Idea 3: Pass Medicare for All (I'm a proud co-sponsor of this bill!)
#SolutionsOnly Idea 2:  Maintain protections for people living with pre-existing conditions like #HIV, diabetes or being a cancer survivor.
#SolutionsOnly Idea 1: Promote tele-health and tele-medicine to reduce costs and bring services to underserved, esp. rural, communities.
We are wrapping up my #SolutionsOnly field inquiry on healthcare. I'm asking the panelists for one idea - will tweet them out shortly.
Great point from a panelist: 'research needs to do more than sit on a shelf. It needs to be integrated into the system.' #SolutionsOnly
