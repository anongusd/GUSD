@ashweeey @Education4Libs Everyone starts as an embryo. At about 8 weeks they are a fetus. Everyone. Please do some research. Watch a partial birth abortion. ( on social media. I can't watch it ) I know you have a heart. I imagine you will have some tears and change your mind.
@ashweeey @Education4Libs Absolutely. This was something we agreed on early in our marriage. At about 6 weeks you can hear a heartbeat with ultra sound. It is very hard for me to believe if someone does the research about a pregnancy that they would choose abortion. Adoption please
@ashweeey Yes you are living in another universe.
@ashweeey All lives matter. You really are the perfect example of a democrat. I googled deaths in US by gunshot 318 per day. It is estimated in US 3000 abortions per day in 2017.

@shanec66 @WVTM13 You are right. The devil walks to and fro. Standing in the path to God. Blinding us to see the truth. Many are called but few are chosen. Everyone has their own path to God through Jesus Christ. My prayers is we all live with Him in eternity.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 There are so many issues. Googled Church of the Highlands. I have learned from you that I don't want the bells and whistles. I just want to do His will. I opened my bible and put my finger on the verse "Be still &amp; know I am God". I wish His best for you.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Sure I will. I'm just trying to find out the truth. I hope what my friend told me is not the truth. If I have offended you I'm sorry. I thought you would have some answers.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Not spreading lies. I told you someone that attended that church told me. I hope all of this is false.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Do you go to the Church of the Highlands
@shanec66 @WVTM13 I hope all this is wrong. I can say I have attended a service at Church of the Highlands. I always take my bible to church. Where I was sitting I could not see a bible. After service the announcer said if you want to do the Lords Supper it is to my right.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Taxes are paid with tithes from people that give every Sunday. And if they can't attend on Sundays because of work they can go on line watch service and tithe on line. And a 92 year old lady was turned away from church because she couldn't pay tithes.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 I will call public records tomorrow. What I was told, I have not verified, by someone that did attend Church of the Highlands for 5 years. That the deeds to everything that is "Highlands" was in Chris Hodges name.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 No it's Chris Hodges. Date of birth June 21, 1964. Church of the Highlands 4700 Highlands Way Birmingham Al 35210. Let his son Michael go from employment at his church. You know the "I want pastor" not what Jesus wants.
@Education4Libs There are a lot of adults that act the same as these kids.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 I refuse to treat my brothers and sisters in Christ different because of their skin color.
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Look up Chris Hodges. Paid property taxes. Now the pastor is Gods instruction through Jesus is both Jew and gentile. We are supposed to be one. One God one Jesus one Holy Spirit one Body. Not black and white.  One. One nation under God.
@WVTM13 God is head of His church. God is not concerned with color of your skin. When you give your life to Jesus your body is His temple. He doesn't care if you don't have a leg or arm, deafness or illness. He wants you to be Christ like. That comes from your heart
@shanec66 @WVTM13 Please research who is paying the taxes and owns everything with the church of the Highlands with all the contributions given weekly.
