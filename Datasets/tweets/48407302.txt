Infowars's vastly different valence now is less the result of Infowars itself changing (though it has) than of its context changing. If you're Facebook, how do you deal with that in a remotely consistent manner? 4/4
@SilvermanJacob Tooootally.
When did that change? 9/11? Sandy Hook? 2016? It's a microcosm of the broader current dilemma, which is that a ton of the forces now upending US politics/society/security emerged from the pop cultural fabric, and it really is hard to say where one ended and the other began. 3/

(I was never good enough to get hired by an alt-weekly but I damn sure tried.)
Both things that seem as sadly anachronistic in the post-local world as the alt-weeklies themselves.
Alt-weeklies were a bridge between the civic-mindedness of the local hardcore scene and the civic-mindedness of investigative reporting--
I think a lot of hacks (me included) were suckered into this career in part because as teens we devoured local alt weekly music listings.
A great eulogy for the alt-weekly that hits a point that many such eulogies don't: https://t.co/Pdcp5neZJS https://t.co/gCUYBWObGc
