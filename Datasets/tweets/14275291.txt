Los intentos desesperados d #Maduro p frenar la hiperinflaci√≥n s√≥lo deterioran a√∫n m√°s la crisis econ√≥mica q √©l mismo ha creado. La #democracia debe regresar a #Venezuela para q el pueblo pueda poner fin a destructivas pr√°cticas socialistas y llevar al pa√≠s a la prosperidad.
#Maduro‚Äôs desperate attempts to curb hyperinflation only further deteriorate the Venezuelan economic crisis of his own creation. #Democracy must return to #Venezuela so the people can stop #Maduro‚Äôs destructive socialist policies + bring the country to prosperity.
Decisi√≥n d #ElSalvador d romper lazos c #Taiwan es otro paso triste en la peligrosa campa√±a d China para aislar a Taipei. No podemos permitir q Beijing siga intimidando a nuestro aliado. Naciones democr√°ticas deben unirse y evitar q influencia maligna d China se extienda a√∫n m√°s.

#GlobalMagnitsky ha servido p responsabilizar a oficiales corruptos d r√©gimen d #Ortega. Pero podemos hacer m√°s. Mi #NicaAct lucha contra la corrupci√≥n al negar a #Ortega y compinches acceso a pr√©stamos internacionales q podr√≠an utilizarse p lavado d dinero y actividades il√≠citas
#GlobalMagnitsky designations have been instrumental in holding accountable corrupt #Ortega regime officials. But more can be done. My #NicaAct fights corruption by denying #Ortega + cronies access to int‚Äôl loans that can be used for money laundering + other illicit activities.
Reporta @jangelmoya que el r√©gimen de @RaulCastroR y #DiazCanel est√° golpeando presos pol√≠ticos y encausando l√≠deres pro-#democracia. Esto demuestra de nuevo que el r√©gimen tir√°nico solo quiere reprimir al pueblo #cubano #RevolucionEsRepresion
Desde antes d acaparar el poder en 2007, Ortega ha tomado medidas t√°cticas p debilitar instituciones democr√°ticas en #Nicaragua. Pero el pueblo dice NO m√°s. Mi #NicaAct fortalece estado d derecho y promueve democracia, sistema judicial imparcial y consejo electoral independiente
Since before taking power in 2007, #Ortega has taken systematic steps to weaken democratic institutions in #Nicaragua. But the people have spoken and said no more. My #NicaAct strengthens the rule of law, promotes democracy + an independent judicial system + electoral council

As @UNWatch details, @mbachelet's nomination for @UNHumanRights chief is another sad example of why the @UN desperately needs reform.
