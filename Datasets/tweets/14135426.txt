You‚Äôre right. https://t.co/x4uGxFeFhd
Two-fifths (40 percent) of African Americans and one-third (34 percent) of Latinos would get a raise if the federal minimum wage were increased to $15
A $15 minimum wage would begin to reverse decades of growing pay inequality between the lowest-paid workers and the middle class. The stagnant minimum wage accounts for 48% of the increase in inequality between women at the middle and bottom of the wage distribution since 1979.
Gradually raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would lift pay for 41 million workers‚Äînearly 30 percent of the U.S. workforce.
Since the @fightfor15 was launched by striking fast-food workers in 2012, states representing approximately 21 percent of the U.S. workforce‚ÄîCA, Mass, NY, and the DC‚Äîhave approved raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour. @USProgressives
The federal minimum wage is just $7.25 and has not increased since 2009. The Raise the Wage Act of 2019 would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. @USProgressives

If voting didn't matter, Republicans wouldn't be working so hard to take it away from millions of people. There's a lot on the line today -- go out and exercise your democratic right to shape our society for the better.
This is the most important midterm election of our lives because civil rights for millions of Americans, including the right to vote, are on the line. If you can vote, go vote, because there are people out there who desperately need you to fight for them. https://t.co/Dv5FiAYC55
People got arrested, got beaten and in some cases were killed in the struggle to ensure that basic rights like the right to vote applied to everyone. That torch has been passed to us, and it is our duty to defend the progress they so bravely fought for. https://t.co/d9ZNACbQlZ
The bigotry and hate we see coming from this White House is not just in rhetoric. It's being implemented in policies that strip civil rights from millions of Americans. 		It is no exaggeration to say that justice and equal rights for all are on the ballot this Election Day. https://t.co/mNpzYLuw0M
The American people have not forgotten, and won't be fooled.

If the minimum wage merely kept up with inflation since 1968, it would be close to $12/hr today. It's still at $7.25. The average CEO then made 20x more than their workers; now they make 300x more. MLK battled against poverty and inequality in his time; that struggle is not over. https://t.co/hdVd9Ypo9n
Dr. King called us to this movement when he said, "Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world." With each chant and strike, we speed up that day when justice will roll down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.
We march, chant, strike &amp; struggle because we know, as he did, that we cannot have true freedom until no student goes to school hungry, until workers can thrive on the wages they earn, and until no family of color fears their child will be killed in their own backyard by police.
But I have never been more hopeful that we will soon realize Dr. King‚Äôs vision. Every day we see it in the Black Lives Matter movement, in the Dreamers fighting to have their humanity recognized, with students marching for gun safety, and with teachers striking for a fair wage.
In many ways, the vision he called for‚Äîof a society without discrimination and hatred, where all workers are treated with dignity, where democracy is safeguarded from concentrated wealth, and where war is waged on poverty, not other nations‚Äîcan still feel very far away today.
Throughout his life, he endured hostility, arrest and smears, not just because he dared to challenge the injustices of that era, but because he challenged us to rethink what justice looks like.
Dr. King deeply understood, in a way that few did in his time or have since, that in order to have economic justice, we must have racial justice, and that the two struggles cannot be separated.  #MLK50
Conditions for Memphis sanitation workers in 1968 were so bad they went on strike demanding their humanity be recognized: "I AM A MAN." MLK joined them in what would end up as his last campaign.

Sherwin Williams, Conagra and NL Industries lost a landmark lawsuit in 2014 filed by Santa Clara, Alameda, San Mateo and other counties and cities over health risks associated with lead paint. An appeals court later found the companies liable for an estimated $700 million
‚ÄúHealthy Homes &amp; Schools Act‚Äù is a $6m lie. If approved by CA voters, lead paint, banned for consumer uses in 1978 and causes brain damage and other physical problems in children and pregnant women, would no longer a public nuisance under CA law; companies not liable for cleanup.
DISGUSTING. Lead Paint Manufacturers are trying to saddle taxpayers with cost of cleaning up pollution. 3 large paint companies are sponsoring a $2 billion statewide ballot measure to clean up lead paint contamination that courts have ruled is the manufacturers‚Äô responsibility.

West Virginia is unfortunately a right-to-work state now. In 2016, the blow to West Virginia labor unions wasn't limited to the right-to-work bill. Republicans also overrode a veto of a bill to repeal the state's prevailing wage law too. These teachers are heroic. https://t.co/FkRlKwvPby
