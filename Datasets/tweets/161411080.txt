I will keep fighting for commonsense solutions to keep our communities safe and prevent tragedies caused by gun violence while strengthening mental health services in this country.
The majority of people with mental illness do not engage in violence against others, and most violence is caused by factors other than mental illness. It is important to remember these individuals are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators.
We must keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have access to them, such as domestic abusers and those with violent histories, and it is critical we do this without stigmatizing those with mental illness.
This bipartisan bill would require background checks for all gun purchases, with some reasonable exceptions, and is one of many long overdue steps forward to begin to address this epidemic, which claims over 36,000 lives every year on average.

Yesterday we honored police, fire, and military personnel from 13 San Gabriel Valley cities. These individuals are heroes among us, whose bravery and commitment to protecting our communities and nation know no equal. https://t.co/oqkKLUvRRR
These tragedies will remain a scourge in our nation until we pass meaningful solutions to prevent them. We must turn our grief into action and finally work together to stop gun violence.
Wounds inflicted by gun violence are not just physical but psychological. Counseling &amp; mental health services must be made available to all survivors, first responders, and all in need. If you or someone you know needs help, call SAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline: 1-800-985-5990
We pray for the recovery of those injured and send our deepest sympathies to all of the families, colleges, and communities impacted. Thank you to all of the first responders for their brave actions in the face of peril.
I am immensely saddened by last night’s tragic shooting in neighboring Ventura County which took at least twelve lives and shattered countless others. We mourn the young people and the heroic Sergeant who were killed; innocent victims lost to gun violence. https://t.co/M6tSISXKBb

We call on the President to immediately end his administration’s zero tolerance policy, which has led to the prolonged detention of families, to decriminalize the asylum process, and to provide care, not harm, to asylum seekers or refugees.
Like family separation, family detention is traumatic and harmful to child development. Jails holding families will not abide by child welfare standards, depriving kids of mental health services and medical care. You cannot trade one form of child abuse for another.
Separating children from their parents is inhumane, but locking families up together is not the solution to the crisis which President Trump created. https://t.co/qjZGSvVXGZ
