I enjoyed my conversation today with @AaronBrilbeck9 after the press conference. I look forward to continuing to work with you.
Q. Do you think Speaker McCall could have gotten the other 5 votes for the grand bargain?	A. I don't know. He had a lot of his own members who didn't vote for it.
Q. Can you speak to 640?	A. There have been many individuals who have said we should reduce it back. There's a reason why other states don't have a 75% threshold.
Q. Do you think legislators will change their vote on plan A+?	A. I've had a few call me.
Q. McCall said your veto double dipped into the roads and bridges plan to get the gas tax to pass.	A. Am I trying to get them back to solve problem? Absolutely.
We can't afford to continue having a full year of arguments next year. We can't suffer another year of the state's image of being unstable.
Q. Have you talked to the Speaker and Pro Tem?	A. Yes. I spoke with both of them Friday night. The Speaker was on his way out of the country so I left him a voicemail. He called me back later that night.
Q. There are a lot of school districts that are vehemently opposed to this. Is this a path forward?	A. My goal is to get more money to the classroom for the teachers. There have been some schools that have consolidation on their own to save money.
Q.Do you anticipate any colleges closing b/c of this effort?	A. We're behind the curve on sharing university resources. The task force is looking at that now. If they recommend certain colleges come under a bigger umbrella- certainly I would consider that.
I am asking the legislature to give more power to the Office of the Governor for future governors.
We owe it to our people to not give up the fight.
Third EO- deals with state agency swag items. A similar bill failed to pass out of the legislature that is why I am siding this EO.
Consolidation and looking for efficiencies in Higher Ed will go a long way and help us be wiser with resources.
Taxpayer dollars should go toward a teacher pay raise, not administrative costs.
Most important component of successful educational outcomes is quality teachers.
Last Friday the job was not finished.
We need to deal with our current budget shortfall and our nearly $600M budget shortfall looming next year.
Legislators have the ability, by law,  to ask for audits.
Update on state agency audits: since I took office I have issued 22 requests for state agency audits.
The third Executive Order deals with state agency swag items that are unnecessary to fulfill an agency's mission.
We have well over 500 school districts across the state of OK. This is an issue we need to address.
A few actions I've taken to bring more focus to efficiencies and administrative costs.
I will give you a date next week for when our next Special Session will begin.
We must put our support are on a path for success.
I've visited with every living Governor and I appreciate their support.
Many are saying that they are working outside of this building- business leaders, civic leaders to help solve our budget problems. Most have expressed support for the A+ plan.
Our state needs to get on a predictable and sustainable path forward.
My office has been overwhelmed by the comments and public support to say thank you and let's quit kicking the can down the road. We can do better as Oklahomans.

What an amazing voice + what an incredible champion she has been. -@holly_harris speaking of Gov. Fallin's dedication to #cjremform.
We know that children with a parent that is incarcerated are 5x more likely to enter the corrections system. We must break this cycle.
If we don't address these issues we will see an increase in our prison populations + it will cost the state $2B.#WomenUnshackled #cjreform
We passed a measure requiring all offenders to receive a risk + needs assessment + develop and individual case plan upon release.
Ok has been working on solutions to reduce the incarceration rate.We are #2 in the nation for incarceration of men + women.#WomenUnshackled
I signed an order "banning the box" that indicates that a person has served time in prison. #WomenUnshackled #banthebox #cjreform
One of the things we see from people who are coming out of the prison systems is trouble entering the workforce. Finding a job is difficult.
Only 3.2% of Mental Health Court program participants end up going to prison.   #WomenUnshackled
People who go through drug courts have a lower rate of going into prisons. -GMF #WomenUnshackled
The systematic risk assessment has been successful in putting people in community based services to keep them from entering into corrections
Women in Recovery is a remarkable program that pays women offenders for success. A unique public-private partnership. #WomenUnshackled
We want to restore their hope and their self-worth. -GMF #WomenUnshackled
A lot the reports have I read say there is a multi-generational cycle of incarceration. We're trying to break that cycle. #WomenUnshackled
We want to people in programs that we know work, not programs we hope will work. -GMF #WomenUnshackled
Systems of Care provide services to people in corrections to take of the needs of women in our criminal justice system.#WomenUnshackled
We are prioritizing treatment for women in prison who are pregnant; who have children. #WomenUnshackled
69% of women in prison in OK have a had an actively managed mental health issue. Compared with 44% of men. -GMF #WomenUnshackled
Vast majority of women (80%) who go into OK prisons are there because of non-violent offenses. -GMF #WomenUnshackled
The gap has continued to widen, since 2012 the rate of female incarceration has increased 30%. -GMF
We need to make sure our state's most precious resource is protected: our families. #WomenUnshackled @USJusticeAction
We need to be investing in programs that are successful. #WomenUnshackled https://t.co/2yt7j3G0oL

Gov. Fallin ends #OKSOTS: "let's roll up our sleeves and get to work"
I believe Oklahoma has a bright future ahead of us, but we cant afford business as usual. We can work together to tackle these challenges
My budget redirects $300 million in revolving funds to general revenue to support priorities like education, health, and public safety
We also need to look at agency revolving funds. We have $1.7 billion in revolving funds, $900 million is unencumbered @OKSOTS
We've worked with Pew Charitable Trusts to develop objective measurements that evaluate effectiveness of tax credits/incentives #OKSOTS
We need to examine tax credits, keep those that work, phase out those that don't #OKsots
We have over 160 measurable goals for state govt on http://t.co/FKvC5mQSLW. We'll be the first state to link spending and specific goals
To help improve budgeting process, OMES has introduced new system of "performance informed budgeting" #OKSOTS
Our current budget system directs billions of dollars away from General Revenue, decreasing ability of legislature to control spending
Oklahoma has significant budgetary challenges - not because of poor economy -- but because of the growth of "off the top" spending
We need to pursue commonsense solutions: prescription drug monitoring program; smoke free schools, and ban texting while driving @OKSOTS
Third issue we need to address is poor health: OK leads nation in prescription drug abuse; seventh worst for obesity
We need to lock up violent criminals while pursuing smart on crime policies that help non-violent offenders w/drug and mental health issues
Another issue we need to focus on is crime/over-incarceration: one in 11 Oklahomans spend time in prison #OKSOTS

I am launching Oklahoma Works -a new program to better integrate private sector and education community to address workforce/education needs
We need more Oklahomans educated beyond high school -- both to provide educated workers for businesses and to get workers good jobs
