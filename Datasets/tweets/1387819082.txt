@amyklobachar Lastly--Maybe overreaching in giving her the benefit of the doubt on this but: being a female prosecutor/an effective &amp; abnormally popular dealmaker with a biting, powerful wit came at the cost of being likable. She should atone for cruelty but not ambition.
@amyklobachar And when I say funny, I mean that she has a refined sense of comic timing that has been extremely effective in moving bipartisan policy forward, leaving her opposition genuinely uncertain as to how to fight back. That's just pretty cool.
unsure if this is an insensitive take: I like @amyklobachar -- she's disarmingly funny and IMO made the right calculation that midwestern pragmatism was missing from the 2020 field. I've also had terrible bosses &amp; believe we should vet her record. Im stuck?

Lastly, I really came to admire Jess in the end. She went through a learning experience that can't really be concealed with editing and I'm genuinely excited to see where she goes next. #end @masterchefau
It's not my place to assume anything about someone else's identity but I was so excited when Khanhn started to excel...he is so honest &amp; comfortable in his own skin and it was so gratifying to see queerness represented in my favourite show.
and the other contestants betrayed some pretty obvious signals that he was basically unbeatable. I love Sashi but some of the key moments of "tension" this season make a lot more sense now. He struggled w/ desserts for like, two episodes, if even.
since I can't sleep and never felt like I had a proper #MasterChefAU post-mortem--some thoughts: In hindsight, it now seems pretty obvious that it was a production decision to portray Sashi as anything other than the frontrunner. He clearly won everything super early
Anyway...I'm grateful that twitter exists right now. I kinda want to scream into the vacuum of space and wish I had a pause button but at least I have somewhere to just say the truth of the matter. Oof. Wishing love and safety to all. Gnight.
That's probably true and I know I have a responsibility to not let it go undocumented. I just don't feel like I have the tools to process how this feels and I'm having a hard time reconciling how I thought I would respond vs. how I actually did. I froze. Again.

I can‚Äôt get over how her framing Obama‚Äôs "other-ism" was mostly about the risk of deviating from ncherished norms and the strength of our institutions in favor of lovey-dovey social justice. I assume we all remember her line about Obama ‚Äòwanting to read terrorists their rights"
There are innumerable references to integrity, faith in our system and country before party. When she arrives at the issue of Russia‚Äôs aggression towards Europe over energy/gasoline she *parlays* it into a pitch for clean energy. SHE MENTIONED WINDMILLS &amp; THERE WAS APPLAUSE.
She mentions rights for the disabled within the first 15 minutes and highlights it as a differentiator from the democratic opposition. Her preamble to this point was generic but she managed to garner a standing ovation on ableism and advocacy for disability rights

And omg Charlotte Gray? My favorite thing to watch when I‚Äôm sick. Structurally incoherent and sort of problematic in it‚Äôs conception of the halocaust but Cate plays the most fun WWII superhero that I‚Äôd prefer not to look up on Wikipedia
Last one to round thesis: You should rewatch the Talented Mr. Ripley and consider how pivotal Cate and Philip S.Hoffman are to making it work. Also IMO &amp; to reference the inspiration for all of this she gave the most memorable performance of the yr in Thor.
Remember The Gift? Mostly memorable for Katie Holmes as a murdered nymphomaniac but Blanchett again turns a pedestrian screenplay into something universal and tragic. In a movie about a psychic who foresees her neighbors' deaths.
If you have the opportunity or free time, watch her 2002 film "heaven" with Giovanni Ribisi. a simple but outlandish story about how people fall into domestic terrorism that she elevates with arresting warmth and grace. never seen anything like it.
Her career fascinates me bc she is best known (and most rewarded) for what I consider to be her most mediocre roles (Rewatching Aviator is almost painful) but her range and timing are truly remarkable, especially in her early 00's indie phase.
Thread: my favorite non-politics podcasts are debating if this year's oscar winners are deserving and I'm strangely indifferent. I'm also rewatching #Thor ragnarok right now and am reminded that Cate Blanchett has been the best actor in hollywood for years.
