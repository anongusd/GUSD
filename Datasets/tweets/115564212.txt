Why he says he thinks so many people hate him: 	“Look, I’ve done focus groups out the wazoo. ‘How could he do business with the Republicans?’ Seven years I stood next to them and praised them. If you’re a purist Democrat, you can’t rationalize that I worked with Republicans.”
On why Biden appeals to him: 	“He’s experienced, he is relatable, he knows how to get things done, he wants to get things done, he’s not blowing smoke, he’s not a blue-sky puffer. He’s not, ‘Health care for all, Social Security for all! Everything for all!’”
On Democrats appealiing to voters: 	“The Republicans do it negatively. ‘They did nothing for you.' ... If you believe in the positive, then you ought to fill that void with the positive. No, the Democratic Party hasn’t done enough."
On what he's seen looking across the table at Trump: 	"He’s scared.”	Scared of what?	“All these investigations. All these people, what do they know? Led the life he led, played life the way he played it. Now the closest people to him are talking. That’s frightening."
On the 2020 Democratic field: 	“I know how to do what everybody’s talking about doing. They’re all talking about how to fly an airplane. None of them have flown. And that’s a big difference when you get in the seat and you buckle the seat belt."
“The ‘professional left’ to me is the greatest scam in history. What does it mean, ‘professional left’? Basically, a sham set of groups that are fronts for labor unions,” Cuomo said. “They were all with Cynthia Nixon, the professional left.”
Some selections from Andrew Cuomo from our conversations:	He demurred several times when I asked if he'd like to be president. Finally sad, Biden is going to run. But what if Biden doesn't? 	“Call me back."	https://t.co/DH5YLZk1qu

Obama certainly didn’t always do this - no press conferences with the kings of Saudi Arabia, for example - and it wasn’t because he liked doing press conferences ). But previous US presidents &amp; staffs would fight for access overseas because they knew US sets these standards.
There was a larger strategy when Obama would do this in authoritarian countries - China, Ethiopia etc - less about giving US reporters more fodder, more about making the leaders uncomfortable, and showing the people of those countries that leaders can be asked questions.
In Havana in 2016, Obama aides goaded Raul Castro into a press conference, where Obama made point of forcing him to answer reporters’ questions.		In Hanoi today, Trump followed Kim’s lead in not having reporters ask questions at all, punishes those who tried anyway.

"Gotcha stories," "fake news," "oppo dump" - all used by politicians and others who seek to undermine the credibility of journalism, either for their own political ends or for the sake of snarking online. The question that matters is: is it true?
Opposition research is real. Campaigns and PACs and others invest in it, and sometimes succeed in getting that turned into stories reporters produce. But reporters who actually report, rather than sit around and tweet, usually get bigger &amp; worse stories as a result of...reporting
If you are a journalist who thinks every negative story is the result of someone delivering opposition research, all you’re doing is proving you’re a very bad journalist

Cory Booker's campaign just put out this article as a press release: https://t.co/ERVHWMf5U7
The Northam quote on why he didn't put very much shoe polish on his face when he did the Michael Jackson blackface assumes that other people in the room might have done blackface themselves:	"I don't know if anybody's ever tried that, but you cannot get shoe polish off."
Tom Perez puts out a statement telling Northam to quit toward the end of the press conference of Northam saying he won't: "it is clear that Ralph Northam has lost their trust and his ability to govern."
Beyond the question of racism - Northam's defense amounts to saying that faced with a crisis, he moved so quickly to respond that he didn't carefully study the issue at hand and put out a statement that he now says was false.
Northam keeps referring to his friend Seth, who is black, as he says he settled the question of the blackface he put on to dress up like Michael Jackson with an apology
@lizzieohreally https://t.co/Op5RCfLGwp
over the last 20 hours, Northam has said: 	-he's in the photo	-he's not in the photo	-he has "no recollection" of being in the photo

Of those, only Wilder &amp; Patrick were elected governor. Paterson became governor after Spitzer resigned in disgrace himself (the prostitution scandal), and pulled out of a campaign for a full term in 2010 one week after launching it, as his administration crumbled under scandal.
The morning after almost every other prospective 2020 Democrat weighed in, Sanders calls for Northam to quit: https://t.co/4iYBvlCTh3
Where this fits in America's story: if Fairfax does become governor, he will become only the *4th* African-American governor in the history of the country. Previous: Wilder in VA, Patrick in MA, and Paterson in NY (not counting one from Reconstruction in LA).
in December, @FairfaxJustin convened the first-ever meeting of the Democratic Lt Govs Association. They met over a few days in a hotel in Alexandria, VA. One theme discussed: there's now a history making 5 black LGs. Another: that many in the room would likely be future govs.

There was also the infamous incident of Fairfax being yanked from some fliers, which was ascribed to an issue of a split union endorsement. More here: https://t.co/CQitNOGh96
This doesn’t mean Northam wouldn’t appear with black people. It means his campaign made a strategic decision, like his keeping a distance from Fairfax through the fall, that it would be unhelpful w/Virginia voters for him to seem too closely associated w/these black leaders.

One of the prayers offered up: “Let this nation see that something good comes out of Newark, New Jersey." A few minutes later, Booker's reverend anointed him with oil. Here's what it looked like: https://t.co/18xs91u5Ji https://t.co/PgDff7Kg6t
“What is real strength? Is it bombast, is it swagger, braggadociousness, is it strut? No, I think strength is seen in vulnerability," Booker told me. "I trust &amp; have faith in America&amp;if that’s not what folks want right now, so be it. But I feel this sense of liberation tonight.”

"Imagine a Washington that listened not to mayors, but to America, that listened to the local citizens that make this country so ambitious..."
Another line that could easily fit for a Garcetti 2020 announcement speech: "it's time to demand that Washington follow our lead,instead of the other way around. It's time that our nation is led from the bottom up, rather than the top down. It's time to flip Washington its head."
"I've never loved this country more than I do right now, but I hate what its political system has become," Garcetti says.
“America right now is crying out for leadership, leadership I know exists in this room," Garcetti says in speech to mayors, then repeats a favorite campaigning line: "there are two Americas--Washington and the rest of us."
Garcetti, speaking at the US Conference of Mayors, starts by talking about his quiet role getting the sides to talk to each other in the LA teachers' strike (which ended yesterday), despite no formal power over it:	"I did what mayors do: you see a problem, you jump in, solve it."

After the speech, I asked @hickforco if we’re going to hear that “the opposite of woe [corrected] is giddy-up” line in an announcement speech. He laughed, said, “I don’t know.” Asked which was he was leaning on the decision, he said, “probably more towards running.”

Buttigieg is an Obama-world favorite. Asked about Obama’s private advice, Buttigieg demurs, though says: “my generation is lucky to have an ex-president who’s decided to focus on the next generation of leaders.”
@jmartNYT Consolation prize for @keithellison was getting elected Minnesota AG, but he came in a close second, whereas Buttigieg dropped out of the DNC race just before voting started, with little support.		But also the 2016 GOP nomination was a consolation prize for flagging TV ratings.
I asked Buttigieg about those who think his long shot run is about positioning for VP, Cabinet, a future run back home in Indiana. His response: “you don’t run for any office, but certainly this office, without a plan for what you’d do, but also a path to how you get there.”
Of the candidates running so far, Buttigieg says, “I’m the only one living a middle class lifestyle in a middle class neighborhood in middle America.”
The Democrats *can* put what they stand for on a bumper sticker, Buttigieg says: “Freedom. Democracy. Security.” 	But only if they talk about the unique ways those have been challenged in the Trump era, and how those challenges resonate in people’s daily lives.

Bloomberg &amp; Biden, both with records that include potential problems for black voters, appeared at the Sharpton breakfast in DC this AM. 	Bloomberg’s pitch: seeing his full record as one addressing historic inequality	Biden’s: detailing the larger legacy of inequality through now

"What the hell are we arguing about a $15 minimum wage for? Why is it even a question?" Biden says
from voting to health care to car insurance rates to outright racism, Biden is spending his time at the National Action Network this morning talking at length about endemic racism in America, reading off prepared stats
Biden compares voter ID laws to the poll tax, talks about suppression in Florida in Georgia in 2018. 	"These guys never give up. We knew that. They never will give up. It’s like cutting grass. You let it go for a while, it looks ugly," he says.
"One thing we know for certain, we learn it over and over and over again through history, from the Holocaust to the Civil Rights movement: silence is complicity," Biden says
Biden: "We’ve learned in the last few years, it doesn’t take much to awaken hate, to bring that part of society out from under the rocks."
Sharpton recalls how he started his career traveling with James Brown, and now he's introducing Joe Biden: "My journey has brought me from the godfather of soul to the godfather of polls."

https://t.co/AxeHpQ2eSc https://t.co/14dDMF9af9
Warren's speech is finished, taking pre-screened questions from students. #1: What's w/Putin &amp; Ukranian boats? "He’s just trying to figure out how far we can push him, ad what will the president do in response.The president of the US is being tested right now, and he is failing"
Warren finishes her foreign policy speech by invoking Mitch McConnell's in-kind contribution to her brand: "The challenge we face may be our most profound since the end of WWII. ... None of this will be easy – but we persist."
Warren: "The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to this President and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy—not without a fight."
"If free societies like ours slide toward corruption and autocracy, they risk becoming democracies in name only," Warren says.
Warren: "Both China and Russia invest heavily in their militaries and other tools of national power. Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image. And if we cannot make our government work for all Americans, China and Russia will almost certainly succeed."
Warren: "Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety and security, and we must not tolerate it in the United States of America."
Warren, staking out a position that could be a Dem primary issue: "Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now."
"While our leaders were focused on wars in distant lands, the world changed under our feet.Would-be rivals..are hard at work developing technologies tactics to leapfrog the US...Neither military nor civilian policymakers seem capable of defining success–but surely this is not it"
Warren: "For nearly two decades, this country has been mired in a	series of wars ... The human costs of these wars has been staggering: ...	The financial costs are also staggering. ...Despite America’s huge investment, these wars have not succeeded even on their own terms."
Warren: "The President grabs headlines railing against GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio &amp; Michigan - but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change."
Warren: "For decades, the leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts—and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown."
"While it is easy to blame President Trump for our problems, the truth is that our challenges began long before him. And without serious reforms, they are just as likely to outlast him," Warren says
.@SenWarren snapshot of world in big foreign policy speech: "democracy is under assault. Authoritarian governments are gaining power. Right-wing demagogues are gaining strength. Movements toward openness&amp;pluralism have stalled and begun to reverse. Inequality is rapidly growing"

Obama: "I think it’s important to remember that identity politics doesn’t just apply when it’s black people or gay people or women. The folks who originated identity politics are the ones who said ‘three-fifths.’ … Jim Crow was identity politics."
Part of why life in DC seemed so much calmer in the 1950s and 60s, Obama says, is "there weren’t any women there to say, ‘What you guys are doing is stupid.’ Suddenly some women show up and they start questioning things, and men are uncomfortable."

One of the big lessons of Trump so far is that it makes a big difference who actually... wins. https://t.co/z2MDKhGH4x
@ccadelago They want a justice who will vote the way Kavanaugh will vote because it’s in line w/their conservative beliefs. But there’s not much political quarter in saying, “I support/have not stood in the way of everything Trump’s done, I’d just maybe have phrased it differently.”
for all future “Is Flake/Sasse going to run a primary against Trump?” speculation: primary challenges usually require clear differences on substantive issues — their only active distance is on Trump’s “rhetoric,” which is either ignored/tolerated/embraced by most Republicans

In every presidential election since 1992 except one (2004), Democrats have won more votes than their GOP opponents. 		In the 8 Supreme Court openings since then, Democrats have filled the same number of seats (4) as Republicans have now (4, with Kavanaugh getting in).

@BuzzFeedBen But they also have not been involved in any meaningful way with any of the campaigns electing Democrats more recently - including those which have elected many black female leaders, with or without the DNC’s help

Here’s the RNC response to Obama saying that Trump and Republicans have betrayed America and threatened democracy: 	"In 2016, voters rejected President Obama's policies and his dismissiveness towards half the country. Doubling down on that strategy won't work in 2018 either."
Obama on getting out to vote: "30 minutes of your time. Is democracy worth that?"
Obama: "People ask me what are you going to do for the election. The question is, 'What are you going to do?' ... The threat to our democracy doesn't just come from Donald Trump [or allies in and out of Congress]. The biggest threat to our democracy is indifference."
Obama: "How hard can that be? Saying that Nazis are bad?"
Obama: "Even if you don’t agree with me or Democrats on policy ... I’m here to tell you that you should still be concerned and should still want to see a restoration of honesty and decency and lawfulness in our government."
Obama on the NYT op-ed: 	"That’s not how our democracy’s supposed to work. These people aren’t elected...They’re not doing us a service by actively promoting 90 % of the crazy stuff that’s coming out of this White House, and saying, ‘Don’t worry, we’re preventing the other 10%.’”
Obama: "None of this is conservative. I don't mean to pretend I'm channelling Lincoln now, but that's not what he had in mind, I don't think when he formed the Rep Party. It sure isn't normal. It's radical. It's a vision that says our protection of our power is all that matters."
Both Democrats and Republicans have problematic pasts, but "over the past two decades … the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party," Obama says
Obama: W/"electronic versions of bread and circuses…demagogues promise simple fixes to complicated problems. They’ll promise to fight for the little guy ..They’ll promise to clean up corruption even as they plunder away. They’ll appeal to racial nationalism that’s barely veiled"
Obama says Trump and others are practicing "exploitation" and have "no compunction and no shame of tapping into America’s dark history of racial and ethnic and religious division"
Obama, on Trump and the economy: 	"Let’s just remember when this recovery started ... When you hear about this economic miracle going on ... suddenly Republicans are saying, 'It's a miracle!' I have to remind them that those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015, 2016."
"He’s just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years," Obama said of Trump. https://t.co/ZQFBJj0dPf
First time Obama's said Trump's name since leaving office: 	"It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause."
"As a fellow citizen, not as an ex-president, I’m here to deliver a simple message, which is that you need to vote, because our democracy depends on it," Obama says in Illinois

democracy, Obama says in South Africa, is about recognizing that "government exists to serve the individual, and not the other way around"
Obama in South Africa: "Don’t you get a sense sometimes that these people who are so intent on putting people down and pumping themselves up, that they’re small hearted, that there’s something they’re just afraid of?"
Obama: "Politics of fear and resentment, retrenchment began to appear. And that kind of politics is now on the move. It's on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable only a few years ago. I’m not being alarmist. I’m simply stating the facts. Look around."

"The Biden Rule" was a term invented by Republicans in 2016, based off a speech the then-senator made in 1992 about not nominating a new justice for a vacancy that occurred during summer, in an attempt to justify McConnell actually holding open a vacancy that occurred in February https://t.co/kWKQDJ93V2
Democrats want 2018 to be the year of the woman—in candidates elected and in voters turning out. Now they have a Supreme Court fight that’s essentially a battle over the future of Roe v. Wade to define the midterms.

Bernie Sanders updates the McConnell rule:	"We should listen to what Sen. McConnell said. President Trump should not nominate, and the Senate should not confirm, a Supreme Court justice until the American people have had the opportunity to make their voices heard in November."

All of six months ago, people who wanted to be New York city council speaker, in charge of an $89 billion budget, were doing backflips to appeal to Joe Crowley, because his personal decision on who to back would essentially pick the winner.
Crowley to me in September when I asked him if he was interested in running to replace Pelosi as leader: "There’s a lot of young talent coming up the ranks." 	https://t.co/PwbNruTwXu
The obvious reality is that many House Ds have been calling, emailing and texting each other in a whirlwind for the last 2 hours, trying to figure out what this all means for the leadership. "Little practical impact" for Pelosi doesn't capture the mood of her conference. At all.
more from aide: "..One real way to do that now is to raise money now. We literally are in a position of where we cannot afford the opportunity that exists on the map." 	Notably, the top Dem fundraiser other than Pelosi &amp; @ChairmanDCCC is @sethmoulton - younger leader/Pelosi enemy
the line being put out, via a senior Dem aide: "Tonight’s developments have little practical impact on the race for the top Dem slot since Pelosi has made clear that she’s staying put. Real question is which younger members of leadership will step up in their leadership roles."
obviously the people who have the best thoughts about the national implications of tonight are the ones who didn't know who @Ocasio2018 was as of two hours ago.
.@ChairmanDCCC, approach to losing an ally to exactly the kind of lefty candidate he's tried to stop elsewhere: 	"My friend Joe’s leadership will be sorely missed .. Congratulations to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who will be a fierce advocate for New York families in Congress.”

cue the (many) tales of people in Queens saying that they weren't even being asked to do the basics of organizing and GOTV for the Queens boss
Joe Crowley won his seat in 1998 by the last Queens party boss pulling an insider maneuver of quitting after the deadline for primary challengers had passed and installing him as the nominee. He lost it tonight to an insurgent challenger who pretty much everyone had written off.
seems safe to say that @Ocasio2018 probably won't be a vote for @NancyPelosi to be the Democratic leader/speaker when the caucus convenes after November's elections
We live in a world where Dan Lipinski fended off a primary challenger who had the backing of the Obama network in Chicago, despite being anti-abortion &amp; anti-Obamacare, and Crowley is on brink of going down despite *running* the Queens machine and being in line to lead his caucus
Joe Crowley is the last local party boss in America. He's been in office since '98 and is seen as the Dem leader in waiting. He and his team had not been taking his primary challenge seriously. And with 60% of the vote in, he is down by double digits to a newcomer.

Anthony Kennedy's behave yourself reasoning: "Indeed, the very fact that an official may have broad discretion, discretion free from judicial scrutiny, makes it all the more imperative for him or her to adhere to the Constitution and to its meaning and its promise."
Dems in 2016 couldn’t get their voters energized around McConnell holding open the Supreme Court seat, and by the end weren’t even trying. Republicans could, &amp; it boosted Trump, put Gorsuch on. The result: all those 5-4 decisions on partisan gerrymandering, travel ban and more.
