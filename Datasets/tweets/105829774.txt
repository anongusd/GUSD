RT @tribelaw: Waving his little hands in exasperation, Trump just isn’t used to having a woman say “No, you can’t enter.”
@smerconish I voted yes, but not sure if it should be mandatory. But definitely should have a form of community service programs that perhaps count as credits for high school and college but definitely not military. That sort of gives me the chills thinking it reminds me of North Korea.

@rachaeldottle @NateSilver538 Nice!
@joanwalsh And this is one of those moments when freedom of speech clashes with common sense! Is it just attention he wants? Just like Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingram, Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson,Sean Hannity and finally our so called fake president.
@HuffPost Who cares😡
@sibersong I like him and agree with you!
@SethAbramson I know my opinion doesn’t matter but so far I think the Democrats are trying to find a good reason to vote against him but there isn’t sufficient reason not to vote yes. I actually like him and he might be one of the adults we need in the present baby/toddler Administration.
