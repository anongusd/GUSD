@RoyBlunt @clairecmc @McCaskillOffice More than 500k Americans file medical related bankruptcy per year! We are the only major democracy that doesn't provide universal healthcare. That is a disgrace! Cut out the damn insurance vultures, stop taking $$$ from their lobbies!
@RoyBlunt @clairecmc   We can spend $700B+/yr. in defense around the globe but don't provide universal healthcare. As a medical professional I know healthcare for profit sacrifices care for millions of people! Why is that so damn hard for you to grasp, do you even give a damn?
