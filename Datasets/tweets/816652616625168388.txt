@POTUS @realDonaldTrump We are influencing a new generation of American leaders to defend life, and my hope is that this trend continues until Roe v Wade is overturned. The first right recognized by Americans of every generation is life. I will continue to advocate for #prolife policies in Congress.
New York, Virginia, and Rhode Island are trying to reverse the progress the national #prolife movement has made, but I’m thankful that under @POTUS 	@realDonaldTrump's leadership, the federal government has prioritized the protection of life.
Since Roe v Wade was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, over 60 million lives have been snuffed out. We will never know how those innocent ones might have changed the world, their communities, or their families.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Contrary to the dearth of evidence that preceded Special Counsel Mueller’s appointment, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to warrant this appointment. I call on AG Sessions to heed Congress’s demand for this appointment. I will continue to fight for full transparency.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I look forward to reading these documents in full and will continue to call for the appointment of a second special counsel to investigate – and to prosecute – any wrongdoing by these officials during the Hillary Clinton and Russia investigations.
I applaud @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for assisting Congress w/ its oversight responsibilities over the DOJ &amp; FBI &amp; to provide transparency to Americans. Our gov't must act fairly and without bias. Unfortunately, we have seen the opposite from DOJ and FBI officials at the very top.

When I won election to the U.S. House, Senator McCain invited me to his office to talk to me about Congress. He dismissed his staff and mine and we spent more than an hour talking about politics, family, and America. I will always remember that occasion with great fondness.
My first encounter with John McCain was when he ran for the U.S. House for the first time, as an East Valley Conservative. In my encounters with Senator McCain through the years, he was always gracious and respectful to me and my opinions.
Sen McCain served America for decades - first in the Navy, then in Congress. He endured trials of the Vietnam War, suffering greatly as a POW. He turned his attention to public service, giving AZ a champion for western issues &amp; worked to preserve American military preparedness.

I addressed the issue of the Clean Power Plan in a Freedom Friday post at the beginning of this year. MORE: https://t.co/KlzRf3Vsdu
It created regs that required additional cuts on energy production by power plants, which jeopardized AZ’s energy supply. The CPP also harmed America’s economic growth, providing uncertainty for AZ’s energy consumers. This was vital to America’s energy independence.
I applaud Administrator Wheeler and the Trump administration for taking this necessary step to replace the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The rule was a blatant attack on states’ rights and yet another example of overregulation by unelected federal bureaucrats. https://t.co/FTnH0d6sDU

In the spring of 1855 legislation to begin construction for a new Capitol dome was signed and construction began soon after.  Building the Capitol Dome was thought to be one of the most ambitious undertakings in American architecture. #CapitolHistory
The current Capitol Dome is not the original.  The first dome was completed in 1824, it was built from wood with a  copper covering. By the 1850’s the dome was thought to be too small for a growing Capitol building, and because of  being made of wood it was a fire hazard.
The Capitol Dome is one of the best known manmade landmarks in the United States. This Dome was completed in 1866 and designed by Thomas Walter. The cost of building the dome was just over $1 million. The dome is made of cast iron and weighs almost 9 million pounds! https://t.co/BrUfYsDEUn

FRIDAYS STAND FOR FREEDOM.		I look at rolling back unreasonable fuel economy standards.

@Jim_Jordan @freedomcaucus @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I believe that Jim Jordan would return to regular order and lead the House to execute our conservative objectives. I thank Jim for his decision to step forward in this race, and I will do everything in my power to support his candidacy.
@Jim_Jordan @freedomcaucus In 2016, the American people elected @realDonaldTrump because they knew he would shake up Washington, and Congress has yet to receive the message. If Republicans are to keep our majorities, we must keep our promises and help the @POTUS codify his reforms into law.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Mr. Strzok's assertion that his text messages against President Trump were not biased (and thus, did not affect his investigations) is ridiculous. We are NOT finished with Mr. Strzok, and will work to obtain the answers he was unwilling to provide yesterday.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump In the instance of Peter Strzok &amp; Lisa Page, it's not just one text message that's in question. It's a whole SERIES of text messages - and who knows what text messages &amp; emails are still outstanding. That series shows Mr. Strzok's culpable mental state and establishes his bias.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump I further made the point that the FBI would take a culmination - they're mining the whole aggregation of various statements the suspect might have made - to make their case for a particular matter in question.
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump After Mr. Strzok rejected the notion for most of the day that his messages were biased, I asked if it were correct that when the FBI tries to put together circumstantial evidence of a culpable mental state, they look for things such as communications. Mr. Strzok agreed.

Lisa Page is obstructing Congress's constitutional obligation to investigate her role in the Clinton and Russia investigations, and she should be held in contempt of Congress for her insubordination. Watch my interview with @MariaBartiromo: https://t.co/H9bzBfV5ND #AZ05

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump America’s constitution stands at a crossroads, and each #SCOTUS vacancy represents a critical juncture between adherence to our founders’ designs or a misguided reliance on the Constitution as a ‘living document.’ I’m urging our Senators to swiftly confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
I commend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for again keeping his promise to nominate a Supreme Court candidate who follows the intent of our Constitution and not legislate from the bench. I give my unequivocal endorsement to Judge Brett Kavanaugh. #SCOTUSpick https://t.co/4qCiyiRx37

As part of this soon-to-be-released package, I’ll be introducing the LIST Act, which amends the ESA to provide for improved precision in the listing/delisting/downlisting of endangered species &amp; potentially endangered species. I’ll be sharing more later in the week.
Congress wants to protect nature &amp; the environment, but we want to do so in a way that balances these vital protections w/ needs of surrounding partners. We can do both. We must first commit to modernizing a decades-old Act that doesn’t accomplish schemes it originally sought.
Out of over 2000 listings of protected species under the ESA, only around 40 have been recovered. That’s simply not good enough.
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) built upon these protections, but the Act hasn’t come close to solving everything under its purview. Instead, the ESA has hampered growth and production across the country.
The bald eagle is one of the victories from federal protections of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. Once in need of protection, the species has flourished to over 10,000 nesting pairs according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. https://t.co/vAMpuvIxFA

Let’s put the border wall, e-verify, chain migration, increased Border Patrol agents, &amp; other conservative proposals, into separate bills. Since I have come to Congress, I have yet to see an immigration bill consistent with the promises Republicans made while campaigning.

Passing this bill was the right thing to do - we observe proof of that every day. It’s important that Congress continues to build on the overwhelming success of this law by cutting more taxes, extending the current tax cuts, reducing regulatory burdens, and cutting spending.
It’s been six months since Congress passed the historic “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.”		Since that day, Americans have seen countless bonuses, wage increases, and job opportunities - all leading to a tremendous optimism about the direction of our economy. #AZ05 https://t.co/48jlzuVW31
@RepMarkMeadows We must ensure that those seeking asylum do so legally &amp; legitimately. I commend Rep. Meadows for his bill that supports @POTUS @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to enforce our laws &amp; applies a necessary fix to an outdated law in order to keep families of aliens together at the border.
This week, I cosponsored the Equal Protection of Unaccompanied Minors Act, sponsored by @RepMarkMeadows.		We should enforce our immigration laws in a way that ensures that all aliens are treated as humanely as possible – especially innocent children. https://t.co/hTOSEkSG4M

I also asked Inspector General Horowitz about the original draft(s) of the #IGReport &amp; when Congress would be able to view those documents. We must ensure that this process was not compromised in anyway. Last week, @RepDeSantis, @RepMattGaetz &amp; I sent a letter to request drafts. https://t.co/xZu3DBiEzR
It's no wonder the American people have such a severe distrust of our justice system with leaders like Comey, Mueller, Strzok, and others running the show.
You have these people at the highest levels of our justice system, who appear to have been inappropriately controlling the inputs that are going into the decision-making process. That indicates that the ultimate output may indeed have been biased.
Mr. Horowitz testified that it could have and that "we don't rule it out."		That's a problem - and speaks to our concerns over the past year.

@JulieBanderas @FoxNews @HappeningNow 3. As I continue to say, this is the scandal of our time. Mueller's investigation is trying to squeeze everyone because he is probing a person - not a crime. This is a significant abuse of power.
@JulieBanderas @FoxNews @HappeningNow 2. What did former President Obama know about the misconduct occurring under the previous administration? We need answers to how high the knowledge and actions went up to.
@JulieBanderas @FoxNews @HappeningNow 1. We can't rely on the DOJ and FBI to investigate themselves - especially with the gravity of such evolving misconduct by their highest officials. This is, in large part, why many House Republicans are requesting a 2nd Special Counsel.

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump It must end, and we must identify and execute solutions to ensure that future Russian interference does not threaten the American Republic.
Mueller may have been tasked with investigating tampering with the 2016 elections, but it is abundantly clear that this investigation is meant to overturn the will of the American people and undermine @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's administration.
The lack of transparency and honesty from Mueller and his team over the past year disturbs me and many of my colleagues – as does the precedence Mueller is setting for future investigations.
On this date, one year ago, Robert Mueller was appointed Special Counsel of the investigation into Russian tampering with the 2016 election. I continue to call for Mueller to resign. https://t.co/W9C0wNjZZJ

My constituents expect me to do something about this in Congress, and the work may involve removing the people who have been miscreants at the Department of Justice. We can’t have two sets of justice any longer.
The American people are tired of watching the Department of Justice undermine Congressional oversight into questions where there appears to be internal corruption for political purposes to control the 2016 Presidential election.
I'll be talking with @toddstarnes on @foxnewsradio at the top of the next hour about the latest at the Department of Justice. Hope you'll listen to the discussion. #AZ05

Lots of positives still found in the U.S. economy thanks to the work of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump &amp; Congress to cut taxes &amp; reduce America's regulatory burdens. We must not stop with our worthy goals to fully unleash our economic potential; there is still more work to be done.

It's absurd to blame @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for #Obamacare's soaring costs &amp; disappearing insurance providers. Former President Obama forced Obamacare on Americans - &amp; found ways to unilaterally change it dozens of times after it became law of the land. https://t.co/DnfYrP1eQs
That approach would quickly spiral out of control &amp; start eroding Americans’ 1A rights. Instead, we must encourage free market alternatives to mainstream internet &amp; social media platforms so that individuals have more choices. I will work w/ my colleagues to achieve this result.
Today’s @HouseJudiciary hearing shed significant light on these reports and gave lawmakers insight into the documented incidents of perceived suppression. However, government must not overreact with regulations.
Today I attended the @HouseJudiciary Committee hearing on social media filtering practices with @DiamondandSilk.		I’m concerned that internet and social media platforms are suppressing conservative voices around the nation. https://t.co/Syob7Fiavk

@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I look forward to learning more today from our witnesses about this topic, about their efforts to advance understanding in this field, and about the technologies and methods that will lead the way to a better and smarter future.
@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Adverse space weather presents unique challenges &amp; consequences of inaction could be catastrophic. However, I believe that through the right combination of government monitoring, private industry innovation &amp; American determination, we can respond to any future challenges.
@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It is my hope that, on the subject of space weather, we will continue to look to that law as a model.
@HouseScience @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What I like most about this legislation is that it compels the government to innovate by partnering with the growing private sector to test and validate its data in order to enhance our nation’s forecasting capabilities.
@HouseScience Last year, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump signed into law the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act, a comprehensive bill to increase our weather forecasting capabilities to better protect lives and property.
@HouseScience In the face of space weather challenges, instead of continuing to think inside the “government-only” box, NASA and NOAA need to look to private partners who are ready and willing to help.
@HouseScience Partners in the private sector can—and should—use their advanced and innovative technologies to help us more thoroughly understand these phenomena and improve our space weather predictions.
@HouseScience Forecasting space weather depends on understanding the fundamental processes that give rise to hazardous events.  Particularly important is the study of processes that link the Sun-Earth system and that control the flow of energy toward our planet.
@HouseScience I look forward to hearing from them about not only what their efforts have been in this arena, but also what they think the future holds for the observation, modeling, and forecasting of space weather events.
@HouseScience I am glad, then, to have key stakeholders from private industry as well as academia, along with leaders from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, with us here.
@HouseScience While all of these topics are important and worth addressing, I think it is crucial that we first lay the groundwork for understanding the current policies, procedures, and major players in both the private and public sectors.
@HouseScience There are many avenues we could explore for this hearing, from innovative space weather technologies and the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, to the potential impacts space weather can have on our terrestrial environment.
@HouseScience With an issue as complex and consequential as this one, it is undeniably important we begin a dialogue on what the status quo is and in what direction momentum is heading.
@HouseScience Good Morning, and welcome to today’s @HouseScience joint Environment and Space Subcommittee hearing, entitled “Surveying the Space Weather Landscape.”  I would like to first thank our excellent witnesses for being here today and for testifying on this important topic.
TODAY: @HouseScience explores how to better understand, track and predict space weather to safeguard electrical infrastructure, communications &amp; more. WATCH LIVE at 10 am: https://t.co/hNtIoh1uT8 - I'll be chairing this joint subcommittee hearing. #AZ05 https://t.co/9gl7vzjoW2

Finally, Congress can take action against judges, who abuse their constitutional mandates. We must have constitutional order and ensure that radical members of the Judiciary do not upset the designs of our constitutional republic.
First, President Donald J. Trump should direct his officials to disregard this ruling and continue to unwind the DACA program. Second, Congress should assert its authority to legislate regarding these issues.
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump and the U.S. Congress must use the constitutional authority afforded to the Executive and Legislative Branches to push back against the Judiciary’s unlawful breach of its jurisdiction.
.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump was fully within his right to rescind the previous administration’s memorandum, that deferred action on certain illegal aliens, and I am hopeful that this case will make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Judge Bates’ ruling is another outrageous, extra-constitutional judicial usurpation of the separation of powers. In his attempt to act as a super-legislator, Judge Bates has promoted chaos. https://t.co/9lO2EqmgjD #AZ05

And it has. Over 500 businesses have passed on expected savings to their employees through wage increases/bonuses. Families have discovered that there's a little more take-home pay this year, allowing them to add a summer vacation or put away some additional funds for college.
Before last year's historic signing of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," it had been over three decades since the last time the tax code had been revamped. We made sure that our work would pay dividends for millions of American individuals, families, and businesses. https://t.co/BxLUtWVbT6

@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, Mr. Comey's mutiny and potential criminal activity has been applauded by the left and the mainstream media. Justice should be served, and it must start with James Comey's actions.
@POTUS Mr. Comey may have mistrusted President @realDonaldTrump, but he was constitutionally obligated to serve the President that the American people elected. The FBI is not an independent branch of government, &amp; President Trump was fully within his right to terminate his employment.
By committing this action and compounding it with his profit-seeking book tour, Mr. Comey publicly justified many of the internal reasons why @POTUS Trump fired him. Mr. Comey has jeopardized the reputation and hard work of the patriotic agents who worked for him at the FBI.
James Comey potentially committed a serious crime by leaking government documents - some that may have been classified - to a friend to send to the press. He did so intentionally to manipulate an ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

@FoxNews If we cannot pass a budget and reduce the size of government now, we must wonder what kind of America our grandchildren will see when they grow up. Will it be a thriving, free nation where they can fulfill their greatest aspirations, or will it be a broken and bankrupt country?
Last night, I wrote an op-ed for @FoxNews to outline my frustrations with our current situation. The bill we will be voting on shortly is nothing short of self-immolation through legislative malfeasance. We are putting our grandchildren in an awful bind. https://t.co/nTLR85K8pS

Last summer I called for Robert Mueller to recuse himself from his witch hunt based on the concerning details we knew back then. We know more today. In light of the #FISAMemo evidence, I am renewing my call for Robert Mueller to resign. If he does not resign, he should be fired.
Rod Rosenstein - another central figure in the #FISAMemo - is supervising the Mueller witch hunt. With what we've learned about Comey &amp; Rosenstein, it's clear that the direction of the Mueller witch hunt has been guided by the tainted information obtained by spying on Americans.
Usually when you are suspected of breaking the law, you are investigated and if found guilty, punished accordingly. James Comey was rewarded, though, by the appointment of his mentor, Robert Mueller, as Special Counsel of the Trump witch hunt.
The #FISAMemo outlines how the Obama admin used government surveillance to spy on a member of an opposition party’s campaign. James Comey is featured prominently in this memo &amp; potentially broke the law by later leaking gov memos to a friend to influence an ongoing investigation.

The release of the #FISAMemo is an important first step in cleaning out the people at the top of our law enforcement agencies who are doing a disservice to the great agents and employees of the FBI and DOJ. We will restore the faith of the American people in our government.
This memo indicates that the Obama-era FBI/DOJ willfully abused their power in order to spy on political https://t.co/kBc2nc4JTR represents another piece of evidence demonstrating the former administration’s propensity to exonerate criminals &amp; to prosecute law-abiding citizens.
In light of this evidence from the #FISAMemo, I'm renewing my call for Robert Mueller to resign. If he does not have the integrity to resign, he should be fired. The direction of the Mueller investigation has been guided by the tainted information obtained by spying on Americans.
Unfortunately, some of the same people who are named in the memo, including McCabe and Rosenstein, are still employed by our government or collecting taxpayer-funded pensions. That is a great injustice.
The HPSCI memo outlines how the Obama administration, including members now central to the Mueller witch hunt, used government surveillance to spy on a member of an opposition party’s campaign.

The American people need the same access to those documents that Congress has. That’s why, since that first evening, I have been calling for the release of the memo. I pray that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump does everything in his power to expedite this process to #ReleaseTheMemo.
Eleven nights ago, I walked to a secure vault, signed one of the most-detailed non-disclosure documents I have ever seen, and viewed “the memo.” Everything I read was exactly what I expected to read. THAT is what is outrageous. https://t.co/f8o6LYJYKU #ReleaseTheMemo

My heart mourns with the Ronnebeck family as they mark this horrific week in their recent history. I will continue to fight for final passage of this important policy.
The legislation passed the House last summer, but has since stalled in the Senate. There's been no consideration of this bill. That's a travesty. Congress has a responsibility to provide these vital protections for innocent Americans.
"Grant’s Law" would end the “catch and release” of illegal aliens who have been arrested for deportable crimes. This bill ensures that these illegal aliens are not released back into our communities, which would prevent potential harm to law-abiding Americans.
Yesterday was the three-year anniversary of Grant Ronnebeck's murder.		He was gunned down in Mesa on January 22, 2015, by an illegal alien. The illegal alien, a convicted felon, was free on bond while facing deportation. "Grant’s Law" would have prevented this terrible tragedy. https://t.co/D6kfHIiq08
The FBI is not an independent agency, yet its leaders appear to think they do not answer to Congress or the President. They are wrong. If they continue to lose or withhold requested information, they will soon experience the consequences that Congress can – and should – provide.
Are you outraged by the missing texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page?		At every step of Congress’s attempts to provide Constitutional oversight to the DOJ and the FBI, we have been met with unparalleled resistance. 		#ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheTexts https://t.co/bDj6tgvrbR
We will never be able to bring these little ones back to us, but we can honor their precious memories by fighting every day to overturn this heinous court decision. That's what I've been doing for decades - and continue to do in the U.S. House of Representatives. #prolife
Today, we remember the 45th anniversary of the tragic #RoeVWade decision - one of the darkest days in American history. Since that day, almost 60,000,000 babies have been murdered. We will never know what potential these unborn souls would have brought to our nation. #AZ05 https://t.co/T3M95xWOnt

President Reagan once said: "Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same."
Yesterday, my staff and I met with a number of faith leaders within our district to pray for our district, state, and nation. We did so without fear of persecution. There are many others around the world who aren't so fortunate.
On #ReligiousFreedomDay, I am reminded of our freedoms to exercise the tenants of our respective religions across this great nation. These freedoms make the United States truly remarkable and should not be taken for granted. #AZ05 https://t.co/iiSDSFul5u
When fed gov allows states to exercise their 10 Amend sovereignty, people will go where they want to go; they'll live under the type of state government they want. We're seeing this w/ AZ - a very free state. People are responding in a positive manner to AZ's pro-growth policies.
AZ's future is extremely bright thanks to strong leadership by our leaders. A new study shows that AZ's population grew by "more than twice the national population growth rate" - many of these new residents "likely came for employment opportunities." https://t.co/wjISYJFhyS #AZ05

As we've stated from the beginning, you know how to spend your own money and stimulate the economy better than the federal government. We can't hold a candle to the endless economic possibilities that American individuals, families &amp; businesses can generate when they keep more $.
And that's not even taking into account the new IRS withholding tables that will go into effect next month for 2018. Many of you will see an increase in your paycheck because of the law starting to take effect.		I promise - this is only the start of better things to come.
#TaxReform success stories are sweeping the country. More businesses each day are doing exactly what we thought they would when we passed our historic package last month: they're passing the savings onto their employers, and they're reinvesting in America. https://t.co/eOPSlQP82r

@HouseScience @POTUS Today we will hear ideas about how some of those fixes to the regulation should look.  Witnesses will inform Congress how federal water regulations affect them and what they need from the government to continue operating effectively. I look forward to a knowledgeable discussion.
@HouseScience @POTUS I applaud the Admin for heeding the calls of Americans. A revision to the rule is desperately needed to provide greater clarity to states. Instead of rushing forward with burdensome federal regulations, the gov needs to do its due diligence &amp; propose a rule that is helpful.
@HouseScience The shortcomings of WOTUS are so self-evident that it is not surprising this onerous rule has been challenged across the country. And now we can point to a very encouraging action from the new admin: @POTUS recently issued an executive order to review the WOTUS rule.
@HouseScience Our nation depends on the hard work of farmers &amp; ranchers: these men and women simply don’t have the time to deal with bureaucratic nonsense. Of course, it’s not just them who suffer:costly &amp; unnecessary government mandates have drastic economic impacts on each &amp; every one of us.
@HouseScience For example, when WOTUS was proposed there was a large outcry from stakeholders across the nation that the rule’s vague definitions regarding navigable water could include sometimes-dry drainage ditches on private farmland.  It is absurd to consider a dry ditch “navigable.”
@HouseScience We all want to be good stewards of the environment.  We also want to be good stewards for the people we represent.  When a federal agency overlooks the needs of U.S. citizens, we in Congress have a duty to ask questions &amp; address the concerns of our constituents. @HouseScience
@HouseScience I am very pleased to have representatives here today from my home state of Arizona to discuss how this rule would affect them and what changes they believe would make water regulations better for this country.
@HouseScience WOTUS rule amounted to one of the biggest federal overreaches in modern history.  The rule’s flimsy definitions &amp; underlying science means that the EPA had the ability to regulate private land &amp; also placed significant financial burdens on some of our country’s hardest workers.
@HouseScience OPENING STATEMENT FOR @HouseScience subcommittee hearing: Welcome to today’s hearing, “The Future of WOTUS: Examining the Role of States.”  I want to thank our expert panel of witnesses for being here today and agreeing to testify about this important topic.
The #WOTUS rule imposed by Obama admin crippled states’ ability to regulate bodies of water. States should have this power, not Washington bureaucrats. Learn how @HouseScience is working to improve future federal water rules: https://t.co/dM4hodiQnV https://t.co/P1F8td4xbQ

@HouseScience Again, I want to thank the witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to hearing more about these interesting concepts.
@HouseScience The purpose of this hearing is to discuss the viability of geoengineering and any early-stage research associated with this approach.
@HouseScience We have a responsibility to explore these concepts, learn as much as possible &amp; discuss ideas to help support research.
@HouseScience Today, we will learn about what research has been conducted on geoengineering and which promising concepts should be explored further.
@HouseScience Since concepts involved are still so new, we cannot say definitively if geoengineering tech warrants full-scale development or deployment.
@HouseScience While there are at least a few programs in our nation’s universities looking into these concepts, federal research is still limited.
@HouseScience Avenues of geoengineering research &amp; others are still in the developmental stage &amp; any or all of them may warrant further exploration.
@HouseScience Geoengineering is the concept of using scientific understanding to alter the atmosphere in a way that produces positive outcomes &amp; results.
@HouseScience Since this is the first time we are discussing geoengineering this Congress, it is important to explain what geoengineering actually is.
TODAY: @HouseScience assesses the status of geoengineering research, tech &amp; innovation in the U.S. https://t.co/4bUMx1aTQD #AZ05 https://t.co/cdyDsx5rY0

We fully expect this injunction to expire and for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to prevail against the sanctuary city policy in Chicago.
In his ruling, a single judge inexplicably found that a grantee has control over a grant, which is not the norm in American law.
Ruling to temporarily block the federal government's responsibility to hold sanctuary cities accountable again defies the Constitution. https://t.co/xre646gVex
