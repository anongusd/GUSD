@sparky1130 @donchartier @KimStrassel @WSJopinion @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley Sorry, no. @senatemajldr invented a rule. Why he did so is not confusing to any serious person: to usurp the president‚Äôs nomination to a Supreme Court seat. As senate minority leader, Reid had nothing to do with it and owns no blame.
@sparky1130 @donchartier @KimStrassel @WSJopinion @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley People care about a legitimate and accountable process. You don‚Äôt even attempt a defense of what @senatemajldr and @ChuckGrassley did. And yet another low-budget rhetorical magician pulls Hillary Clinton out of his worn top hat.
@marcorubio Not justice, but another opportunistic U.S.-prompted coup in a long history of regime change and exploitation in our hemisphere and beyond.
@Wader95 @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley He was not a lame duck president. An unscrupulous opposition simply declared Obama‚Äôs presidential authority moot a year before he left office. This had not happened before. It was not legitimate. It was wrong, whichever party it was.

@sparky1130 @KimStrassel @WSJopinion @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley If true, which is without precedent, I would be just as hard on him. It‚Äôs not about party. It‚Äôs not less wrong because one party does it rather than the other.

@davidsirota Politics. What we are defending here is politics.

And if I am on solid ground that far, then the prospect that we can be manipulated on that basis means that our inability to converse and judge on the basis of evidence is a national security threat, and that enemy is within our gates (nods to Cicero).
If we are severing friendships and family ties over simple differences of opinion, or polite reminders that hunches and evidence are different things - holding people in that much contempt on that basis - then representative democracy is in trouble. And it has been for a while.
There is definitely a threat to civic republicanism here, but it‚Äôs roots are deeper than this presidency. Those in Russia who sought to disrupt our politics are exploiting an extant weakness in our culture.
It reminds me of sitting through a performance of ‚Äú12 angry men‚Äú a few years ago, and audience members were struggling with the concepts of presumptive innocence and making conclusions based on evidence. It is the same with defending open elections.

I am worried by the increasingly anti-democratic sentiment that questions our right to run for office, or vote for candidates we wish.

But is there necessarily a linear explanation? Does it have to add up? Not really. Not hitting people on a crowded subway train is a convention. People pull out of that contract sometimes. It‚Äôs curious. I‚Äôm not convinced there is a reason. I still wonder who that guy was. 8/8
Was that guy crazy? Is Anna Lushchinskaya impaired in some way? Once again I look for some kind of explanation for the surprise violence, just somebody on the subway suddenly hitting, kicking, spraying stuff while you‚Äôre just doing your everyday. 7/8
For weeks I got phone calls from NYPD inviting me to comb through mugshots. I never did. I remember apologizing to everyone in my path for weeks, as if what had happened to me related to my existence being a crime. I couldn‚Äôt find a better reason and somehow I wanted one. 6/?
He walked up some stairs and off. Like the person interviewed in this @Gothamist story, I talked to transit police and was told they couldn‚Äôt do much. Gave me some paper towels, said my face looked bad. I was swollen and bloody. Gave a report. 5/?
But I didn‚Äôt hand him my pen (would he have stabbed me with it?), so he punched me hard in the face. No one intervened. I fell on someone, blood pulsing out of my nose. He hit me a second time. The train arrived at a stop and everyone - including him and me - got off. 4/?
This was not a 40 year woman like Anna Lushchinskaya. This was a large, young, strong guy. Sunglasses. Well dressed. And he said, ‚ÄúGive me that pen. Give me that pen.‚Äù I had no idea what was going on except I was being menaced seemingly at random. 3/?
Crowded train on a Sunday. I was writing in a journal. It‚Äôs a world before smartphones. Passenger next to me bumps me with his leg. I assumed it was accidental. Then it happened two more times and the guy stood up. 2/?

@perdee22 @SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Possibly, or for Pelosi. I‚Äôm thinking Pelosi is speaker.
@oldsourpuss @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie The lack of a challenger is the relevant point, I think. I think this is why Pelosi is not sweating.
@perdee22 @SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Badly written tweet. The scenario not coming to pass, I meant, is one in which Democrats vote for a Republican speaker. I get why that scenario is scary, and I don‚Äôt endorse that kind of brinkmanship.
@perdee22 @SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Democrats can elect another Democrat Speicher. With Fudge endorsing Pelosi and no rival candidate, and Democrats not really backing any Republican, this scenario is not coming to pass. https://t.co/2UJ8l1Fb6T
@SvePan1108 @perdee22 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Do what you gotta do, and have a good Monday. Sincerely.
@SvePan1108 @perdee22 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie ...the Democrats actually have a debate about an agenda, who the best leader is (odds favor Pelosi), how to move forward on procedure, rules, vote, and carry forward. It‚Äôs a healthy, democratic process that does right by those represented.
@SvePan1108 @perdee22 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Meanwhile, aside from willfully distorting my argument, you‚Äôre suggesting as a matter of course that Democrats might vote for a Republican speaker of the house to spite Nancy Pelosi. ü§î Nah. What might happen is this...
@SvePan1108 @perdee22 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Nonsense. My argument has nothing to do with Susan Sarandon or her support for a 3rd party in a general election.
@sandralhanlon If she has the majority of votes, why fear a vote?
@perdee22 @SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie It is an implausible scenario.
@SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie If there is a contested leadership vote, the 15 will line up behind the winner.
@SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie We‚Äôre not going to end up with a Republican speaker.
@SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Well, provided the primary or leadership challenge does not aim at personal destruction. An honest debate, however, is  good.
@SvePan1108 @GeorgeTakei @GayLabourYorkie Vote. Declare Winner. Unite behind winner. I‚Äôm not trying to be snarky about this: I really do think competitive politics are good. A primary challenge or leadership challenge makes the winner stronger.
@NateSilver538 Isn‚Äôt that what consumer choice is about?

@willbonds The thing is, he is not ‚Äújust a comedian.‚ÄùAnd he knows that and so do the rest of us. He has been a cogent critic of the powerful, of popular culture, and large news organizations.
Of course, what happens when Stewart‚Äôs arguments are challenged historically has been a combination of hurt feelings and ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm just a comedian anyway.‚Äù
@ggreenwald Eh, this seems like more Stewart‚Äôs chronic both-sidesism. First, beltway journalism is not the whole world. Second, they don‚Äôt share one collective ego. (Weird metaphysics.)
What I‚Äôm saying is,  @camanpour had material here to challenge Jon Stewart on his habitual ‚Äúboth sidesism‚Äù even at a time that news orgs are receiving pipe bombs, reporters are being threatened at rallies and assaulted by candidates, to say nothing of the murder of Khashoggi.
For instance, @amanpour might have asked Stewart: do you really assume journalists share one collective (and wounded) ego? Isn‚Äôt that a peculiar metaphysic?
Second objection: Stewart interrupts @camanpour when she attempts to talk about what journalists do in order (including fact checking) to broadly psychologize criticisms of the president by journalists and equate them to Trump. This ‚Äúboth sidesism‚Äù is a feature of Stewart‚Äôs work. https://t.co/X2OjGmF20p
First problem I have here is the assumption they are talking about ‚Äúevery single newspaper.‚Äù I just rattled off the names of a whole bunch that are not obsessed with Trump reportage.

Yesterday was a long infomercial about who is in charge of society and why women remain silent about rape and sexual assault. As a hearing it was a sham. He will be confirmed and Dr. Ford‚Äôs life has been upended (again).
It is not about truth, it is not about institutional integrity, it is not about vetting a nominee for a lifetime appointment. It is about using institutions to consolidate power.
Perhaps also it is also about dominance. Republicans can now say, ‚ÄúYes, we can prevent your president from making an appointment, we control this process, we can install who we want, we will get our way, we will win.‚Äù
I hear, ‚ÄúWhy Kavanaugh? Why not move on to another conservative jurist?‚Äù I have no clairvoyant ability. Perhaps his view on protecting the president matters. It could also be this has been a challenge to #metoo, a chance to hit back at a change in social expectations.
False accusations do exist, certainly, and claims like these can be weaponized, but that can be assessed without conveying disdain for women or defending the supremacy of maleness and social class. It‚Äôs not a joke: we have a responsibility to serve the truth, not rank.
That‚Äôs how patriarchy is going to play this: focus on the impact of the accusations, rather than the claims of injury. Perhaps Brock Turner will be a federal judge. The way is cleared.
He did not say or do things that would seem instinctive for someone innocent - even bearing in mind I don‚Äôt know how I would react to being accused on national television. Even so, the person who had been through trauma was disregarded while the accused received apologies.
Observing the judge‚Äôs statements and behavior from a standpoint point *presuming innocence* there were serious questions about his temperament, judgment, and partisanship, as well as his feelings about social rank and privilege.
Yesterday‚Äôs proceeding was not about fact-finding. A woman‚Äôs story of being nearly raped was treated as if it simply did not matter, a message carried live direct from the United States Senate.
Before Dr. Ford was pressured into coming forward against her will, before we knew her story, there were already grounds for impeaching Judge Kavanaugh, not installing him for life on the Supreme Court.

Which doesn‚Äôt make me your mom, it makes me your slightly inappropriate uncle. Right, carry on.

I‚Äôm not your mom, and I don‚Äôt want to add more speech policing to the evening. Forgive me if I have. I just see this play out every time powerful people die. There seems to be this rule of hagiography only before we all move on to something else.
This may be painfully obvious, but: tagging members of the family with negative sentiments is tacky and hurtful and beneath you (yes, even you, for crissakes, and that‚Äôs saying something).
The tricky bit is that he is also someone who wielded political power and advocated positions (including as pertains to warfare) that people feel passionately about for good reasons. Those feelings will come up. People can express those feelings too.
The senator is (yes, is) a widely beloved personal figure and my timeline is loaded with tributes to him. I‚Äôm also seeing some speech-policing going on. Risking some guilt myself here: how about remembering him as you wish, and not telling other people what to think or say.

@oddfox @yesthatCarlo This isn‚Äôt about owing the press anything. The press functions as an independent witness for the public. This could have been a closed door briefing or the press could have been consulted about coverage - those are both routine. Instead, you have a candidate and presumptive 1/2
@yesthatCarlo @oddfox I agree that it is not the same as what Trump does. I also know from experience that excluding press was not necessary for protecting vulnerable people at a public event. She and her staff also know that. She is playing the public interest against the press. Red flag.
@Ocasio2018 A public event is public. If there are concerns about how coverage might affect somebody safety, talk to journalists. Negotiate. It happens routinely. You know it happens routinely. Stop pretending this is a new thing. I am truly alarmed by this dishonest argument.
@mattyglesias @Ocasio2018 Not the same thing. Dumb argument.
By now you know, even if you didn‚Äôt before, that you don‚Äôt have to exclude press to protect vulnerable people. This is not an honest argument. You are pitting the press against the public interest, just like our current president. Stop. https://t.co/7OYx0nGqXK

@jdkahler The public mission motivates most of us that stay in the business. Believe me, it isn‚Äôt the great money. Here, there may be a distinction to make about national media versus community reporters, but this is another conversation @Ocasio2018 has shown no interest in having.
A compromise that is also not necessary for the stated purpose, therefore not ‚Äúunfortunate,‚Äù and which raises flags. The ‚Äúpress vs immigrants‚Äù frame rauses another. The lack of any negotiation with press about this, still another. https://t.co/Z6NQV87SSr
Disclosure: I am, like @Ocasio2018 , a member of the DSA and have been watching her ascent with hopeful interest (even wrote a column about her). However, I am anti-authoritarian and this moves reeks of authoritarianism (which can be exhibited on the left as well as the right).
Let‚Äôs watch. Maybe this will never happen again. Or maybe there will be more public meetings excluding independent media, or stricter controls than normal. I have a bet with myself on this, but I‚Äôll watch rather than predict.
That looks an awful lot like a public official who wants to establish control over press access, which isn‚Äôt new, just a bold exercise of it. The impulse does not belong exclusively to the left or the right.
And you and I both surely understand this, and I‚Äôm positive @Ocasio2018 does, so there must be more to it than ‚Äúprotecting the vulnerable.‚Äù But she won‚Äôt even discuss it. She calls it a ‚Äúnon-story,‚Äú letting this be presented as press versus the public.
I could ask for a photo op with the candidate, and refrain from photographing immigrants speaking at the meeting. I can write about what happens in a way that doesn‚Äôt identify individuals at risk. It‚Äôs not like I am going to go in there and publish a roll call w/ addresses.
For instance, I can go to a court and write about what happens there without identifying jurors, without identifying minors involved in cases, without divulging information that might endanger people involved in the case. We do this all the time.
The Facebook stream is not independent when the camera is controlled by the official, or an agent of that official. When I cover a public meeting, you are getting an account of what happened independent of, say, the mayor or the police. I can do that and protect the vulnerable. https://t.co/7amshLhTDM
I agree about protecting the vulnerable. I also know that protecting the vulnerable does not require excluding journalists from public spaces and public events. Thus, rather than protecting the vulnerable, this was about controlling the narrative. @Ocasio2018 https://t.co/7Gb4jpJw5H
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 I agree about protecting the vulnerable. I also know that protecting the vulnerable does not require excluding journalists from public spaces and public events. Thus, rather than protecting the vulnerable, this was about controlling the narrative.
@HerasMichael @WFSecurityNerd @ThisBarbara @Ocasio2018 Now that‚Äôs a good question. A mix of both, depending on different situations.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Actually, I am arguing that the event is a mix of private and public, and the precedent is dangerous, yet a number of routine options could‚Äôve addressed people‚Äôs safety. We also realize she is the presumptive member of Congress following the election. She is a public figure.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 OK, no problem. Tweets are hard.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 You are leaning hard on the spin that this is somehow about the press versus innocent people. It‚Äôs really about the press‚Äôs ability to report on public events and the conduct of elected leaders. This was authoritarian.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Now you are misrepresenting the entire case. It wasn‚Äôt that media were allowed under certain conditions that they agreed to, they were barred from a public event. Do you agree that public officials should get to conceal their *public* conduct, including town halls, from press?
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Anyway, what you are describing is something other than a public meeting where everybody is allowed to attend except independent witnesses practicing journalism. And you have yet even to acknowledge why that might be concerning.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Again, condescending. Are you able to argue respectfully?
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 I don‚Äôt respond to tweets that condescend and misrepresent my arguments. (Well, I just did, darn it.)
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Hello media person. I‚Äôm a media person too. That means we both know that journalists go to court rooms, hospitals, shelters, and numerous places where we agree to certain boundaries for protecting the vulnerable. I don‚Äôt know why you are pretending this is not the case.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 I did not put any words in your mouth. I pointed out what you are defending, and what the implications are. There is a difference.
Efforts to define a free press as working against the public interest are not a matter of ‚Äúleft‚Äù or ‚Äúright,‚Äù as @Ocasio2018 demonstrated this week. it is an authoritarian impulse, and anyone seeking power is vulnerable to it.

@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 Then it isn‚Äôt a public meeting. What you are defending Is for elected officials to have public events, and even live stream them, but keeping out an independent narrative about what took place. And I really don‚Äôt think you would like to live in a society where that is the norm.
@jdkahler @vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 That is correct: there are private events close to media all the time. Not public meetings. Not town hall event open to the public yet closed two independent journalists. The only one who is attempted anything similar to that recently, that I am aware of, is Donald Trump.

@vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 there are some boundaries to protect victims and jurors. Numerous other examples. This was not necessary to protect anyone.
@vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 There are numerous ways to protect the vulnerable without violating the First Amendment and establishing a precedent by which elected officials decide what public events will be covered by independent journalists. It happens all the time. When I go to courtrooms (1/2)
@That1_Dude92 @thicc_waluigi @Danielaszt @Ocasio2018 So make it a private meeting. Closed door briefings take place all the time. No one would object to that. Holding public meetings (and live streaming them, by the way) but keeping out press as independent witness violates the first amendment. Supporting it is foolish.
@HerasMichael @WFSecurityNerd @ThisBarbara @Ocasio2018 It really isn‚Äôt just semantics, and even in public spaces, there are legitimate negotiations to protect the vulnerable.

Plus: I go to court rooms, shelters, hospitals, military sites, etc., and negotiations about boundaries to protect the vulnerable go on routinely. Are you unaware of this?
@That1_Dude92 @thicc_waluigi @Danielaszt @Ocasio2018 Sounds like a basis for a private event then. The problem you are ignoring is when an elected official decides what *public and open* events merit coverage, and prevents independent journalists from witnessing and reporting what happens in public space.
@That1_Dude92 @thicc_waluigi @Danielaszt @Ocasio2018 Boy are you going to be mad when you find out that meeting was live streamed, and not by a wicked journalist. Also, talk to a journalist about how this works, because we deal with situations involving vulnerable people routinely. We aren‚Äôt your enemy.
@That1_Dude92 @thicc_waluigi @Danielaszt @Ocasio2018 So you would like to live in a society where people with power get to decide what public events get written about by independent journalists for public consumption? Some of the people I cover would love that.

@dlfeltham @Ocasio2018 This! It happens routinely. We go into courtrooms, into shelters, into hospitals, military sites, schools, and many places where we have to talk about safety and boundaries. It stuns me that AOC doesn‚Äôt have staff experienced with managing this situation.
@vivienne8726 @Ocasio2018 It wasn‚Äôt a closed event. That‚Äôs the problem. A closed event would not have aroused this concern. It is a public event yet she tried to forbid journalists from witnessing or writing about it. That‚Äôs a screaming red flag.

@HerasMichael @WFSecurityNerd @ThisBarbara @Ocasio2018 Politicos have closed-door briefings and private events for the reasons she listed. But she isn‚Äôt doing that, she is having a public town hall and saying press can‚Äôt come. It is a flagrant violation of the First Amendment.
@QSultan35 @Keeva @Ocasio2018 So have a private event. That‚Äôs different than holding a town hall open to the general public but excluding press.
@Ocasio2018 Nope. If it‚Äôs a public meeting, and you seek to exclude press, you are engaging in an attack on press freedom and public access to reporting on it. If you need to have a private event, go for it, but excluding press only is not a non-story, it‚Äôs deeply troubling.

If you choose to vote third party, you are not disloyal. Don‚Äôt let yourself be bullied. Make the best choice &amp; breathe. https://t.co/rFAE7jq2CW
I‚Äôm not going to play along with this language. Calling a legitimate candidate a ‚Äúspoiler‚Äù implies that their presence ‚Äúspoils‚Äù a free election. False narrative. The result doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to any party until they win the vote. https://t.co/ybpUmg1pyw

@Jara_Films You are free to think I‚Äôm weird. I think comparing yesterday‚Äôs press conference to Pearl Harbor and Kristallnacht is weird, and harmful in its own right.
@Jara_Films Then you don‚Äôt follow my work very closely. I have been calling out bad analysis, false equivalency, and historical erasure in print and on social media for years.
@Jara_Films The reason the hyperbole matters is that it actively interferes with our ability to understand yesterday‚Äôs events properly and put them in an appropriate perspective.
@Jara_Films So no, I‚Äôm not going to jump on the bandwagon and pretend this meets the legal definition of treason or is somehow worse than multiple illegal wars, bombing schools and hospitals, building torture networks, ethnic cleansing, slavery, and concentration camps.
@Jara_Films I‚Äôm not dying on any hill. I‚Äôm using historical knowledge and reason. It was a blundering, incompetent press conference that raises some very serious questions. Meanwhile, TV people are comparing it to Pearl Harbor and Kristallnacht.
@Jara_Films As for treason: the constitution defines treason rather narrowly. I hear we care about the constitution. I agree the press conference was awful and even has legal implications in light of the Mueller investigation. But the treason, eh.
@Jara_Films Calling that press conference ‚Äúthe darkest hour of the American presidency‚Äú is ridiculous hyperbole. It contributes nothing to anybody‚Äôs understanding of what was at stake and what went wrong in that press conference.
Would you like to begin with the first presidents, or the recent ones and go back? Lots of historical ground to cover. https://t.co/bM6J4Kf04Z

Seeing as how @TheRickWilson is lately beloved of anti-Trumpers and a frequent guest on @Lawrence on @MSNBC (where he‚Äôs good with the zingers) I think it‚Äôs fair game for him to be asked why torture is cool with him.
So yes, subjecting Paul Manafort to torture is wrong. Torture doesn‚Äôt become OK when it is inflicted on people you don‚Äôt like. That isn‚Äôt how human rights work.
Solitary confinement has been shown repeatedly to inflict suffering and psychological damage, in as little time as a few days. Solitary confinement is torture.

@CanyonReboot @Archonoclast @mtaibbi @MalcolmNance @ggreenwald Yeah, he is. You may not like his work. You may not like his writing. You may think his analysis is shoddy. You might think he's a lousy journalist all around. But what he does, well or not, is journalism.
@LiamMcGregor2 @LakeviewChgo @mtaibbi @MalcolmNance Americans travel to Russia every day. It is not illegal or wrong to set foot in Russia and it is not illegal or wrong for a journalist from anywhere in the world to talk to Russian journalists. All you're doing is persecuting speech and opinion - like Trump does.
@LakeviewChgo @mtaibbi @MalcolmNance I never said "Putin is our friend and hasn't attacked our elections." Putting words in my mouth is patently dishonest and eliminates you from serious conversation.
@Archonoclast @mtaibbi @MalcolmNance @ggreenwald It's the same purpose: to limit the journalism and the voices you don't like, with the same disregard for democracy. And it is entirely similar to what McCarthy did. Unless you have evidence to back up your claims, your claim is not "honest conversation." It harms jrnlsm. (2/2)
@Archonoclast @mtaibbi @MalcolmNance @ggreenwald Trump yells "fake news" and alleges that press organizations reporting on them are dishonest and engaging in a conspiracy. You (like @MalcolmNance) yell "Russian dupes" or "foreign agents" to delegitimize and marginalize dissidents whose critiques you don't like. (1/2)
@EaleyGregory @AynusP @leahmcelrath @ggreenwald @MalcolmNance Evidence.
@EaleyGregory @AynusP @leahmcelrath @ggreenwald @MalcolmNance Greenwald is a journalist with controversial opinions and is strongly critical of the dominant political parties in the U.S. as well as the government of Brazil, where he lives with his spouse. He is a dissident. That doesn't establish him as an agent of a foreign power.
@AynusP @leahmcelrath @ggreenwald @MalcolmNance Maybe, but that is not how *I* am using the term. McCarthyism went beyond the individual lives destroyed, and damaged the republic. @MalcolmNance is contributing to the ideas that people who criticize the establishment are foreign agents. You don‚Äôt have to like Glenn to reject it
@MalcolmNance @ggreenwald You know exactly what you are doing and it is reprehensible. It‚Äôs exactly what Trump does for his own purposes.
@EWErickson I want to understand your argument. It sounds like you‚Äôre saying we shouldn‚Äôt formulate judgments based on statements a person chooses to compose and publish on the internet. That does not make sense to me. How have I misunderstood you?
Don‚Äôt judge people for statements they choose to publish for a large audience? https://t.co/xn4Z2PPn9b
@AynusP @leahmcelrath @ggreenwald @MalcolmNance I would agree about that behavior, but that does not justify @MalcolmNance doing it. If it‚Äôs wrong, it‚Äôs wrong. Let‚Äôs not do it.
To wit: @AlanDersh refers to the constitutional pardon power as a basis for arguing that a president‚Äôs motive cannot be called into question, that a president legally cannot abuse their power. This is an authoritarian argument that rejects checks on executive power.
This is flat out wrong and dispenses of any remaining credibility @AlanDersh had, as it baldly rejects republicanism. But let‚Äôs have more feel-good pieces about having lunch with him I guess. @nytimes https://t.co/rXyiJoA6ep
@leahmcelrath @ggreenwald Thank you for at least addressing the content. This can be true, and it also can be true that @MalcolmNance is being irresponsible in labeling GG a foreign agent simply because Nance doesn‚Äôt like him or his opinions. That harms all independent journalists. It‚Äôs Trumpian.
@NaveedAJamali @MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid It‚Äôs a smear job to call someone disloyal and a foreign agent on the basis of no evidence except dislike of their opinions and a desire to harm them. That‚Äôs what Nance is doing, and it puts literal and figurative targets on the back of independent journalists.
@MalcolmNance @ggreenwald Malcolm, I totally get that you don‚Äôt like Glenn Greenwald‚Äôs opinions and desire to harm his credibility. Refute him all day. But this agent of a foreign power talk is conspiracist bullshit targeting a dissident. Stop. Refute arguments, stop attacking journalists.

Don‚Äôt be manipulated. Compete. https://t.co/pyQSkxvbZM
@kathygriffin First @BetteMidler‚Äôs joke, now this. Please heed the feedback you are getting. LGBTQ people are not a cudgel for you to use to hammer the president.

@joan_mediator @davidhogg111 Right. And I am personally not for the virtual life terms that we often see. More people need to participate, and not just from the wealthy class.

Sorry, no. The answer to entrenched incumbency is campaign-finance reform, and changed behavior by voters. We need more social control, not less. The democratic means of limiting terms is to vote. https://t.co/N7DRiR2ni6
@davidhogg111 On this, I disagree with you. It reduces voter choice. We need to change our habit of reelecting incumbents so much. The democratic method of limiting terms is to vote.

@DineshDSouza @RawStory So you accidentally retweeted it. OK. What was it you were trying to do? Were you trying to ‚Äúheart‚Äú it? Were you going to leave a comment?
@ClownNota @RW_American1 @POTUS As for messages threatening the life of the president, you haven‚Äôt cited any. Show me sources. Back up your assertion. And when you put your personal name on your account, maybe then we can talk about bravery.
@ClownNota @RW_American1 @POTUS Saying you would like to beat the hell out of journalists is a threat. And I asked you, since you like to call people cowards, whether you think it is brave to make those threats behind an anonymous Twitter handle. You very bravely avoided that question.
@CNN @oddfox ‚ÄúSeemingly harmless acts?‚Äù

@SpockResists @MichaelAvenatti Intriguing question. I wonder why, if somebody admired @MichaelAvenatti‚Äôs work as an attorney, they wouldn‚Äôt want him to keep doing that work. For instance, I think my dentist is pretty bad ass. If he became surgeon general, I would lose out on a good dentist.
I used to love Sunday papers for the kind of human stories that get crowded out during the week. Check out the cover of tomorrow's @CrucesSunNews Sunday paper for a story I got to work on, about a recently-passed WW2 vet who took a piece of U.S. Naval history with him. #NavySeal

@ClownNota @SpintheVinyl Answer my question. Do you consider it brave to threaten people behind an anonymous handle? Because that is what you are doing.
@ClownNota @SpintheVinyl Do you think it‚Äôs brave to threaten people from behind an anonymous Twitter handle?
@ClownNota @SpintheVinyl The person tweeting that they would like to physically beat journalists behind an anonymous twitter handle. I think your local journalists need to be aware of the potential threat to their safety.
Sure, okay, let‚Äôs talk about #civility. https://t.co/VOoKpxbdOl
@BetteMidler Ugly and unhelpful.

Regardless of who won the election, you do not blame voters when an office holder abuses their office. Voters are not to blame for the stolen Supreme Court seat. I am really amazed at how bad @ezraklein‚Äôs take is here and he is doubling down on it. https://t.co/6VicoNsIG8
@ezraklein You are not getting this: regardless of who won the election, the sitting president should have made a nomination for that seat. You are blaming voters when the actual crime was committed by the office holder.
