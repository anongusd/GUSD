Speaker Brandon Hall says it‚Äôs about endorsing a lifestyle during Pride Month. He says they disagree on what is true. Says they must defend that truth. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt both be right when we have totally opposing viewpoints.‚Äù @KCENNews
Next speaker: says both issues need to be covered. @KCENNews
Next speaker says reference point is Biblical.  He says he is opposed to government indoctrinating children. @KCENNews
Next speaker: says sexual abuse among LGBT population when they are children is high and that‚Äôs why there might be anxiety and depression, but says the experiences they have as a child shouldn‚Äôt be swept under the rug
Last speaker: quotes Maya Angelou, when she says when she goes to the Library, she feels safe. ‚ÄúLove gives us courage.‚Äù
Gorilla kisses can be beautiful! https://t.co/dGkBcoDBYx
7th speaker: ‚ÄúI am a human being.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would save your life.‚Äù She says it‚Äôs important for the people speaking out should see the face of the people the speakers are talking about who are against the LGBT display. ‚ÄúWe are adults here, let‚Äôs act like it.‚Äù @KCENNews
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt choose to become homosexual,‚Äù says one speaker. @KCENNews
Sixth speaker: the descending voice. Says he‚Äôs talked to hundreds of LGBT youth as a medical profession. He says the service the library provides is a matter of life and death.  He says LGBT has a suicide rate of 3 to 4 times than counterparts...anxiety and depression too
Fifth speaker is also against the LGBT display...says the library is supported by local taxes and should remain neutral, should not promote moral, sexual values.  She says LGBT is moral, sexual choice. @KCENNews
‚ÄúWe are not going to change God‚Äôs law,‚Äù says Milton, the fourth speaker. He says the display downstairs last June was totally wrong. ‚ÄúDisplaying a transgender display and advocating this is correct would be the same thing as displaying area depicting murder.‚Äù @KCENNews
Protection of childhood innocence about sex is pressuring them to think about things they cannot process, said the third speaker...‚Äùthe lines are drawn,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs becoming a civil war.‚Äù @KCENNews
Second speaker: ‚ÄúWe should be more concerned about offending a wholly and righteous Christ.‚Äù He got an ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù murmur from the audience
Second speaker: ‚Äúnormalizing sexual perversion is a terrible idea.‚Äù Says Jesus Christ will never celebrate such @KCENNews
‚ÄúDid you honestly think this was going to happen in Temple and go unnoticed?‚Äù says the first speaker.

The CARDAMC Command presented Philipson and Hockley with a token of appreciation for sharing their stories
One of the lasting lessons is vigilance...he says we must remain vigilant
He and his family got to New York on an ocean liner‚ÄîHockley was still 15 years old
‚ÄúWhen we got to Caribbean, we were captured by the Dutch Navy,‚Äù Hockley said.
Hockley and his family left on a ship to the West Indies on May 6, 1941
Hiram Bingham helped thousands of people get visas to America, including Ralph and his family.
The US State Department‚Äôs attitude is they didn‚Äôt want any refugees at the time, so they made effort to push the visas for people
His mother offered his services to the Quakers in Marseilles, France and went to children‚Äôs camps they sponsored, and interpreted in the office too
Then, he and his mom and sister were sent back home, but in September, the head of the school called them in and said he cannot go back to school, kicked them out. He said it‚Äôs the greatest thing that happened to him actually
His father was put on a train from one camp and was sent west in June...then on June 17, he and his mom and sister were shipped and they ended up in Nord, France
‚ÄúOn the 14th of June, Paris fell,‚Äù Hockley said. He wanted more than anything else to show Germany was the master of Europe, but he made a mistake, he bypassed Dunkirk to get to Paris.
Hockley shows what Germany looked like in 1940 #forthood https://t.co/1R3yj96DQk
‚ÄúOur normal life in France‚Äù changed, according to Hockley.  He and his family thought they could escape by going to south of France.
Hockley‚Äòs dad was a butcher.  Here‚Äôs a pic of Hockley in 1930: https://t.co/uKdZrdat9X
‚ÄúThey arrested anyone they didn‚Äôt like,‚Äù said Hockley.  He was in the 1st grade when Hitler took power https://t.co/eK1lbSjO32
Hockley is giving a history of Germany, from the Treat of Versailles after World War II all the way to the election of Hitler as leader
‚ÄúThe joke to me Hitler wasn‚Äôt German, he was Austrian.‚Äù‚ÄîRetired Colonel Ralph Hockley
Here‚Äôs a bio of Hockley https://t.co/tJAHM0WgUe
Army Retired Colonel Ralph Hockley, a Holocaust survivor, did counterintelligence after the war during efforts to identify Nazis https://t.co/nv2n6Czg0c
Philipson quotes Vice President Mike Pence when he visited Dacau in February of 2017 then he quotes Elie Wiesel: ‚ÄúSilence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.‚Äù
They want to recognize the 35 American units to save the lives of so many individuals, according to Greg Philipson, the former Texas Holocaust and Genocide Commissioner

We're telling women they can't have it all, but the reality is many have to work, Sanberg says
"We need pay people fairly for the work they do for this country" Sandberg says.
"Kick the elephants out of the room!" says Sandberg, to an emotional woman who asked a question about losing a spouse and dealing with it
Sandberg says she knows why she's here today--because her grandparents were welcomed into this country and thus survived the Holocaust
"How many of you know about Post Traumatic Stress?" "But how many of you know about Post Traumatic Growth?"
2 years and 10 days ago, Sheryl Sandberg's husband, Dave, died suddenly.  She says she still cannot believe it sometimes.
Sandberg spoke at Fort Bragg yesterday.  She says she realized Lean In circles build resilience--to serve and to be married to someone
Her first military lean in circle she attended was in 2013.
There are 33,000 Lean In Circles in about 150 countries, Sandberg tells the room of military and their spouses.
The military has an important role in this. In the room are these nation's protectors, leaders, who are our future leaders, Sandberg says.
But many women raised their hand when Sandberg asked them if they were called bossy as a kids. She calls them executive leadership skills.
"Men how many times have you been called bossy as a kid?" Very few men raise their hand
When she worked at Google, Sandberg says she tried hard to hide she was pregnant because she was afraid it would impact her career.
