@maziehirono Funny, I was thinking the same about you and the failed policies that lead 2 terrible loss. I did on the ground reporting with the #CaravanaDeMigrantes and they left their countries because DEMOCRAT operatives promised jobs and housing were waiting for them! YOU CAN STOP NOW! https://t.co/DTP6Bv27kM

@AP_Politics Blame the @DNC will not work with @realDonaldTrump to secure the border. Democrat policies encourage immigrants 2 take dangerous risk; traveling unprepared with children over miles of tough terrain to reach America; because they were told by Democrats that jobs were waiting! @Fox https://t.co/e2ycZ9wltP
