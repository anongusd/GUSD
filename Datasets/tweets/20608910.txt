Will debate change minds? Trump has been slipping and now there is tape incident and GOP revolt. A draw is fine for HRC if its that
Pence is helpful to Trump with the GOP base. He vouches for him in among cons GOP and tonight Trump threw him under the bus.
Trump doubling down on "locker room talk" is going to hurt him...and team HRC will be using that.
If voters judge this to be a strong night for Trump, he still has to deal with the damage he's done to himself over the tape.
Graceful note at the end by DT
Just to underline this, Trump said HRC would be in jail if he were president.
For some he may be exposing her weaknesses, but is he shoring up his own?

No kids, it doesn't have to be like this ... and it isn't always like this. This is an unfortunate year
DT going after everyone.
"Big diversion...."
Shame and jail ... this sounds a lot like the RNC
Whatever you think of the content, DT has done all he can do - turn this on her and put her on defensive.
Its a good thing that Rudy and Christie got Trump ready to look more presidential.
DT  has concluded this is the only shot he has left.
Shouldn't he have tried to defend himself on fitness for office charge rather than promise to make life better in the inner cities?
DT should be appealing to GOP right now not minorities...they aren't going to vote for him
Clear she's going in for kill early - fitness for office is the message tonight from HRC
WOW this is happening
Trump slogan: grabbing xxx and killing ISIS
"Locker room talk" ... sniffling .. "medieval times" all in one sentence.

My scorecard: DT good on trade, establishment pols, econ writ large, bad on his taxes, women, Iraq, national security, birther issue.
HRC was able to bait DT on women and he was at his worst in response..
Voters will tell us soon whether this debate changed any minds. I don't know.
In the end Trump articulated the outsider message well, she showed she was better prepared and exposed his weaknesses.
Last few minutes were some of Trump's shakiest.
DT undermines strengths tonight with lines like she doesn't have stamina. 	Strong response from HRC
HRC line about being baited by tweet is still solid...
Perhaps strongest moment for HRC right here about DT and national security
I think Lester Holt is doing a very good job.

Rubio made strong case for himself tonight - less Interested in contrast w Trump.
Trump tired to take focus off him saying to GOP establishment there are millions behind me - join me. Smart politics.
Phew, back to the polls.
Two man race yet?
Wow, Trump advocates bucking GOP rules. Whoever has most delegates should win.
It's interesting to hear these candidates on stage talking about the social context for why people resort to violence at Trump events.
Crowd size matters.
I think debate tonight has more sober tone which is good for GOP brand. Cruz has drawn most contrast with Trump.
Trump might find the book Red Notice about Putin's Russia interesting
Putin has been a strong leader for Russia - Trump. That sounds like admiration for a tyrant.

Cruz has shown great skill in issuing a litany against Trump. Not just tonight.
Trump's anti Muslim views could explain some of his support among evangelicals, many of whom condemn basic tenets of Islam as violent v West

Btw, by this point in the last debate Trump had already spoken extensively about his man parts.
On foreign policy, I'd like to know specifically what these candidates think the leadership lesson of the Iraq war is.
Trump's interested in staying above fray. He's playing out the clock. But others have a need to take the fight to the front runner, no?
