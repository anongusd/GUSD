See Thomas's work on view this fall when @Tate's hit exhibition, #SoulofaNation comes to Brooklyn. https://t.co/4lBrqDAAnY
In addition to acrylics on canvas, Thomas also painted watercolors on paper. Quieter and more loosely composed than the acrylic works, these works still find Thomas brilliantly conveying movement through line and washes of color. #bhm https://t.co/dFgRU4rZUA
The Brooklyn Museum's "Wind, Sunshine, and Flowers" (1968) is a key example of this style, one of a group that Thomas termed her "earth paintings." Here a sense of the movement - the "wind" - is conveyed through fractured stripes of color. #bhm https://t.co/j96OBxKpyJ
Thomas often took the natural world as a point of artistic departure, but rather than depicting nature representationally, she painted from a quasi-aerial view, with plants, flowers, branches, etc. forming patterns. #bhm https://t.co/u0yDnSmD1p
Working in the '50s, '60s, and '70s primarily in Washington, D.C. artist Alma Thomas (1891- 1978) established a unique abstract style characterized by thick rhythmic brushstokes and rich color. #bhm https://t.co/OzNq8DolOO
