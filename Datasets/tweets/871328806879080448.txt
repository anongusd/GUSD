@ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It will backfire, they always over play. GOP needs to focus on and attempt to govern.
@SpanbergerVA07 Then negotiate a compromise. That's how we've been moving forward that past 250 years.
@SpanbergerVA07 Both sides using it as leverage? Hey pot, this is kettle, you're black.
@Odette1961 @SpanbergerVA07 Trump fights like a Democrat. Driving Democrats crazy. Hilarious!
@SpanbergerVA07 If he opens the Government Democrats will not negotiate in good faith. President offered olive branch yesterday. I suspect you would engage him in good faith and resolve this matter. Problem is Nancy Pelosi, and you know it.
@SpanbergerVA07 Then fund border security. It's very simple. You could even do the adult thing and negotiate a compromise. #ronilsingh

@jonkarl We all knew the answer to the question.That's why you got a question as an answer. President making point that he's opposed by Democrats and media. I'd inquire on where compromise may lay. I read over 70% think problem at border. The story is in the compromise. #ronilsingh

@CBSNews Well now we know who the problem is. Pelosi holding country hostage for open borders.
@SenSherrodBrown Yeah it's tough. Plays out like this for private sector employees somewhere everyday. Feel for her. If you intend to remain an advocate for open borders I suggest she start looking for new work. She certainly can't count on the politicians in Washington. #RonilSingh

The high road didn't work. McChrystal was set up to publicly criticize Trump and chose to take the bait. He has received a response.
@theeyefollows @MMnotine @benshapiro Well then McChrystal could've kept his mouth shut. He chose to speak. He's now received a response.
@V4LinFL @benshapiro Not the point. He's no angel like you or I. We both got a paycheck. I'm not necessarily defending Trump. My point is If you take a political shot at someone they can respond. He doesn't need defending. Man up and take it. His move.

@AmericaFirst @LifeHorrible @SpanbergerVA07 Interesting you have to tell yourself that?
@SpanbergerVA07 National security? Then why are Democrats shutting down the Government for open borders? All the politicians posturing about who is responsible. No politicians debating the reasons they shut Government down. Sounds like you'll just be like the rest.
@DailyCaller I'm not a Skins fan but the Titans player was on the Skins bench. Unwritten rule, a big no, no. Titans players will tell OL, don't do that. I doubt Norman will be fined.
@NicoleMetzel @timkaine Whatever, sure. I'm good with that. Your Senator can avoid it. He's worried about federal employees. Says he's for border security, sends employees home without pay because he hates Trump. They're full of it. Acting like jerks.
Russian hockey player interviews are the best.
@timkaine Then pass the bill. If you cared about them the Government would not be shut down. You're punishing 800,000 citizens for your own political posturing. Hey pot this is kettle, you're black.
@MarkWarner Well then don't let the President have his way. Vote for border security. I remain jaw dropped that you're for open borders. Makes no sense. You don't think it's important we know who is entering the country?
@thedeadlydonald @ABC No, you can pick who covers you and what coverage you want. As for pre-existing conditions that's the only place to compromise on legislation. Don't expect the government to take care of you. They won't. Logic will solve this problem. Not your emotions.
@thedeadlydonald @ABC Deregulation is the only answer to mass affordability and access to "quality" healthcare. Everything federal government "fixes" gets worse. Mandate horrible idea. Set the free market in motion.
@ABC That's not true. It's the Democrats law. Nothing will get done. It is ripe for a centrist solution. The Democrats and media will emotionally exaggerate and fear monger. They will obstruct any potential solution and blame others for their bad law. ABC News will go along with it.
@baroquebasilisk @OpposeObamaCare @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @KCraigTV I don't believe you. The founding fathers you don't like, all Democrats.

With all the human flaws they set the frame work for you to live the most comfortable free life in the course of all human time. How will you be judged 250 years from now? Probably still an immature jerk.
@OpposeObamaCare @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @KCraigTV I don't agree with that. The Constitution is a masterful compromise. You don't have a right not to be taxed.
@OpposeObamaCare @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @KCraigTV I don't disagree, however I'm very pessimistic a majority will be persuaded. Not in our lifetime. So I'm open to a compromise being attempted.
@OpposeObamaCare @CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @KCraigTV Fair enough but you're not going to find any political will to shut them out and say good luck. So a compromise is in order.
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @jeffpeguescbs Charge the father with illegal entry, child endangerment.
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @KCraigTV Maybe Congress could pass a bipartisan bill that addressed the concern on pre-existing conditions. The press could be critical of both parties and report accurately. Or the main stream media could emotionally exaggerate and fear monger. Wonder what they'll do? Not really.
@MarkWarner Yes, access and affordable. Choice and competition may get us where we need to be. Deregulate! Every time Democrats, while well meaning, "fix" healthcare they make "access" to "affordable" healthcare more difficult. When you find the solution subject Congress to it this time.
@AP I like Doug, he's a good man, but the lesson on his upset win is for Republicans. Don't run people like Roy Moore. Doug faces uphill battle if Alabama GOP nominates normal candidate.
