🚨🚨🚨 Believe it or not, one of the Democrats first actions controlling Congress is to make it easier for them to raise your taxes.		I’m a NO vote.
Surely there must be room where we can find a compromise. The Democrats continue to reject offers that provide border security, including offers that take care of our dreamers.                                    https://t.co/ES2HCVlnuU
The only ones who benefit from this decision are our adversaries in the region, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.  We are working with the administration to see if we can change this policy to one that will protect our vital interest in the region.
Though we have always maintained a very small footprint in Syria, we have had a huge impact on humanitarian, political and military objectives.  Most troubling, if we withdraw, we leave our allies exposed and in a weakened position.
I believe the President’s new policy on Syria is a mistake. Having been to the region many times, working with our partners to bring stability to a very important part of the world, I believe it’s critical for America and our allies to remain engaged.
The Senate is proposing a short-term funding measure through February 8. This is a betrayal of conservative policy and, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will not support the status quo. Kicking the can down the road hurts Utah priorities.
Utahns expect the federal government to fulfill its mandate to provide border security while keeping the government open and operating. I am working on striking a deal that accomplishes both.

The Committee is actively seeking the input of colleagues who have read the memo regarding next steps, including public release.		Public release would follow the step-by-step process laid out in House Rules.		I expect that that will happen.

My view=these devices circumvent the Gun Control Act and the National Firearms Act. This type of modification to a gun should be controlled.
I’ve asked the ATF why these devices were approved without restriction in 2010 and again in 2012.
Like most Americans – and most gun owners – I wasn’t aware of bump stocks. It is my view that these devices deserve scrutiny.
9-12 month background check. Federal registration. Local registration.
Ownership and transfer of the remaining automatic weapons is a tightly controlled process.
But manufacturing of automatic weapons for civilian use has been banned since 1986.
I fully support the second amendment and will not support any bill that threatens our constitutional right to bear arms.
I grew up hunting. I shot guns when I was in the military, including automatic weapons. I own guns. I’m licensed to carry a concealed weapon
The first responders rushing towards the concertgoers amid a hail of bullets to save lives. These are heros.
The victims in Las Vegas are in my prayers.
Any life taken through gun violence is a tragedy. Any time that happens our first thoughts should be for the victims and their families.

There are too many dedicated police officers in Salt Lake City to be tainted by this episode. Accountability is key to maintaining trust
If any police or civilian leaders were aware of this video and  took no action they need to explain why? The public trust is too fragile.
I can't imagine Payne ever interacting with the public again. He has lost our trust. And why did it take a month for administrative action?
I know our police have a very difficult job. But just watched the video of arrest of nurse Wubbels by Officer Payne. Incredibly disturbing.
Heading to cedar city. Meet w some college students then look at the fire damage. We need to push hard for extensive restoration effort
Headlines should be screaming the good news about our economy. Republicans know how to help working families.
3% GDP growth last quarter! Means more jobs, more money for working families, more hope in future. Tax reform will make it even better!!

Takes courage to do right thing. Congress must support our troops in Afghanistan. I will lead fight in Congress to give pres tools he needs
Pres is listening to his generals. Thank you! We owe it to our brave troops and the price they have already paid to end this fight w vistory
I'm grateful pres made a military and nat'l security decision not a political decision. Courage. Determination. With leadership  we can win.
Brave me &amp; women and their families sacrifice every day to help protect us. On behalf of all you Utah's we are grateful for their sacrifice
My heart goes out to the family of the Guardsman we lost in Afghanistan. It's reminder that we live in a dangerous world.
We must stand united for equality of all and oppose intolerance, racism and bigotry.
“E Pluribus Unum” - “Out of many, one”
Young men and women of ALL races and faiths have bled and died for these ideals at home, on the shores of Normandy, and around the world.
The US stands as the shining city upon a hill. We are the beacon of hope that “all men are created equal”.
Let us not mince words. We must condemn the violence, hate, racism, and bigotry shown by these neo-Nazi and white supremacy groups.
I am still distraught by the events in #Charlottesville. My prayers continue to be with the family of Heather Heyer.
Did you know that you can purchase a flag to be flown over the US Capitol Building in someone's name? Here's how --&gt; https://t.co/7p7rSjD5Qg

We can stop Kim Jong-un from developing nuclear missiles capable of destroying dozens of US cities. But it's going to take a serious effort.
UN took a serious step forward last week with sanctions. Good for them! (&amp; finally! ) China commit to enforcing sanctions. Good for them too
We've been dealing w North Korea since I was young capt in Air Force. The closer they get to nuclear ICBMs the more aggressive they become
I'm happy DIA released recent information regarding North Korean missile/nuclear technology. The American people deserve to know the facts
