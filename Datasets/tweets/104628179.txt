We NEED Congress to pass a comprehensive Passenger Bill of Rights to address the imbalance of power b/w consumers &amp; airlines!
The DOT should seek to strengthen its consumer protection policies to match or exceed those that are available to consumers in the EU
Consumers should be able to compare apples to apples when finding the best deal for their flights in clear terms online
We support @SenMarkey &amp; @SenBlumenthal FAIR Fees Act-prohibiting airlines from charging unreasonable ancillary fees (set by the DOT)
Airlines must gain travelers trust again. Consumers should be made aware in clear language of their rights at ticket purchase!
We have seen that when competition increases, fares tend to go down and service improves!
Airlines are raking in billions-in 2015, American, Delta &amp; United made $14.69B in ancillary revenue (baggage, cancellation, standby fees)
Airlines are shrinking seats, aisles &amp; bathrooms. Stuffing ppl into fuller planes, leading to adverse health effects. How do we fight back?
Unchecked consolidation in airline industry has led to higher prices, fewer flights &amp; WORSE service. 4 airlines control &gt;80% of US flights
It's time for Congress to step in and restore consumers' rights in the airline industry!
Millions depend on airlines everyday &amp; are subjected to the whims of an industry that treats its customers like cattle. We need protections!

Lack of effective competition requires action by Congress to restore passenger rights! We support @SenatorHassan TICKETS Act of 2017
