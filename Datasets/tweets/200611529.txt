@LilaGraceRose Didn’t you vote for him? Because abortion
@UROCKlive1 U can always tell when he just learned some new bit of common knowledge.

@TheRickWilson @MrJonCryer WRONG. Trump *neither* intended *nor* expected to win. AND he didn’t WANT to win. All of that was self-evident from the beginning. He brazenly, audaciously used our sacred election process solely to advance his business interests &amp; to feed his narcissistic needs. Full stop.

@kaitlancollins Wasn’t it scheduled as a “working lunch?”
@billmaher You’re not paranoid. Trump will always be as lawless &amp; fraudulent as he can get away with. But the throngs of people in gov’t &amp; law enforcement he would need to back his “reverse coup” seems way beyond his capacity to orchestrate—not to mention the mass acquiescence he’d need.
@NicolleDWallace Disagree. Dems on the Committee are failing to bring out Cohen’s vast history of first-hand experiences that should illustrate Trump’s clear pattern of racism, misogyny, fraud, cheating, lying and criminality. Dems are unprepared, overly cautious, milquetoast #missedopportunity

@OfficialJonZal I’ve often thought that Don Jr’s office, and his father’s office, are both quite unremarkable and not what one would expect from narcissists—right?!
@itsJeffTiedrich You are the funniest man in the  Twitterverse—seriously!
@robreiner Well said!
@jbarro Also, there’s no reason to assume that Don Jr. walking into a meeting he was not a part of for a brief behind-the-desk chat with his father was not routine—as it is for almost every one of the hundreds of family business clients I’ve worked with over the years.
@jbarro Agreed that it’s the least compelling anecdote in the statement. His narrative makes it clear that he’s guessing &amp; that his “conclusion” as to the relevance of what he saw &amp; heard in Trump’s office—“probably in early June 2016”—is his own. He’s transparent about that.
@OfficialJonZal Exactly
@JenAshleyWright Duh
@itsJeffTiedrich This is almost as good as “dictator play date!”
@MMFlint Maybe call it “President Thug”?
@MMFlint Idea: find a young black hustler who is a delusional narcissist &amp; sociopath &amp; compulsive liar, who employs the same defensive &amp; coping strategies as Trump. Follow him around with a camera for a month. Then make film that intersperses footage of the black kid w footage of Trump.
@MiaFarrow He’s been kicking ass with his contributions to public consciousness during the past couple of years! Much to be proud of!		Can’t help noticing that he looks like he’s about to burst into song with “I’ve got the world on a string, sittin’ on a rainbow...”
@StephenAmell @bUmBLiNG_b33 1. The song just isn’t that good.		2. #BradleyCooper is a beautiful man, and a good actor, and a mediocre singer.		3. #LadyGaga has an amazing voice and knows how to use it.
@bUmBLiNG_b33 Great point!
@billmckibben As we civilly select the Dem nominee, assume that said nominee will be running against Nikki Haley or John Kasich, not Trump. Trump won’t make it to the election without doing something universally seen as unforgivable &amp; far worse than any of his known offenses to-date.

@johnlundin Fine. Fine. As long as civilization and liberal democracy can count on you to get out and vote (or timely mail the absentee ballot, in your case) for Bernie Sanders, should he end up being the Democratic nominee in 2020.

@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump Magically, Mitt Romney’s popular Massachusetts health care program became a “tyrannical, socialist government takeover of health care” as soon as the black president proposed it.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump There is also no other explanation for the vehement unrelenting opposition to the Affordable Care Act—which is a centrist, mostly market-based effort, partially conceived in a Republican think tank, to solve one of the most difficult intractable economic problems of our time.

@AlanDersh Besides, “Counselor,” Congress is the final arbiter as to removal under the 25th, which obviously makes it an inherently political process, not a legal one—just like impeachment. Summer is coming. I’m sure everyone on the Vineyard is looking forward to making you feel miserable!
@AlanDersh U miss the point—that Trump *is* in fact, demonstrably, clinically “psychiatrically incapacitated” (to use your words), as many of us have known for years. That said, the Congress is ill-equipped to deal w matters of emotional intelligence, so removal under the 25th is unlikely.

@JillWineBanks That’s good to know, but Barr is going to come down on the side of truth and justice. With the help of Republican “leadership,” Barr played Trump in order to get confirmed. The Bush enabler will not me a Trump enabler.

@BillKristol Investigations and legal exposure aside, Trump still has two more years to self-destruct. Nikki Haley will be the Republican nominee in 2020. Haley will primary Trump, if necessary.
@UROCKlive1 @AOC @ewarren And with @DanRiffle advising @AOC, I fear this is all going to end up not being politically viable...which would be tragic.
@UROCKlive1 Unfortunately, @AOC has stopped short of stating that she is not in favor of abandoning capitalism. I suspect she is still formulating her views on this, which is concerning. @ewarren has spent decades grappling with how to make capitalism more fair &amp; is much better prepared.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Why would you wish that on Barron? I’m serious.

@karenmccann1704 @Amy_Siskind @treanor_jim OK, where is the line for you—the line where substance matters more than timing?		serial killer	drive-by shooter	rapist	kidnapper	armed robber	extortionist	abusive boss	income tax cheat	gossip	jaywalker	boxed wine server	new mattress tag remover
@LynnElliotEsq @DogginTrump I believe you are simply more honest :)
@Milbank How did the Committee move the ball forward today in terms of holding the Administration accountable?
@Amy_Siskind The people who think Trump is a “strong man” are not the same people who are concerned about AK’s abusive behavior (e.g. me). In fact, there is probably no overlap whatsoever between these two groups of people.
@Amy_Siskind @treanor_jim What if she was a serial killer? Would the timing of the revelation matter?
@Amy_Siskind Unconscious gender bias is pervasive &amp; insidious &amp; destructive. But default assumptions of gender bias can indicate a similar kind of blindness. An abusive management style reveals deep character flaws—in men or women. @ewarren, @staceyabrams, @KamalaHarris are all better choices
@rickwtyler @realDonaldTrump That said, some Ds on the Cmte aren’t very good at interrogation, &amp; were unfocused, which made them look petty &amp; ill-informed. But the sins that matter are the ongoing violations of American values &amp; institutions, not the demeanor of under-experienced Cmte members—right?!
@rickwtyler @realDonaldTrump You are 100% right about the politics—net negative for Ds. But given the extent of this Admin’s treasonous, corrupt &amp; incompetent deeds (which I assume u agree is already self-evident), treating defiant officials with deep skepticism &amp; aggression is appropriate &amp; necessary—no?!
@mattseaton @emptywheel @MollyJongFast Clearly, your audience does not understand the backstory underlying the first option, otherwise it would be the more popular of the two.

@Karna6e @Vruno @mattyglesias That is not what happened in the 2018 midterms.
@Karna6e @mattyglesias What you believe will be true in 12-16 years, but it is not true yet. A solid majority of voters are still in the center.
@Duvisited @mattyglesias Good input, though #2 remains to be seen...
@mattyglesias @John_Friedman While my own values &amp; politics are far to the left, I am also honest enough to acknowledge the self-evident reality that a center-left (i.e. moderate) candidate still represents the *most* viable path to victory for Democrats. “Electability” is still a thing—a thing that matters.

@Katpa73 @quaker4change In some cases, it’s a blessing not to know one’s father. Long ago, Trump said publicly that raising children is “women’s work.”
@bjcreigh @quaker4change In fairness, Republicans have more closeted LGBTQ

@DeadlineWH @SteveSchmidtSES @NicolleDWallace I hate the utterly broken two-part system too &amp; would love to see it disrupted by a truly viable independent. But with democracy itself in grave peril, asking voters to trust Schultz not to be a spoiler is asking too much at this moment.
@pmitton1 @Amy_Siskind @LindseyGrahamSC Right!
@SenSchumer What good could possibly come from this letter? You’re only making it more difficult for Coats &amp; others who are trying to protect the country in the face of direct opposition from the President to be effective. “Educate” &amp; “impress upon” Trump? As if...
@samstein Either @LindseyGrahamSC is performing for the President (which would be dangerous &amp; disgusting) or he’s being blackmailed, bribed, or physically threatened by the Russians and/or Trump.
@tedlieu That’s a best-case scenario, @tedlieu. On the other hand, democracy could die.
@DevlinBarrett Either he’s performing for the President (which would be dangerous &amp; disgusting) or he’s being blackmailed, conned or physically threatened by the Russians and/or Trump.
@RSun82 Yes, and just about every other Millennial buzzword/phrase—especially “kind of.” I must be old now.
@tedlieu OK, that’s funny! Maybe you’re not as much of a nerd as you appear to be. 😜
@jbarro 💯
@AnandWrites You are way too smart, centered, strong and emotionally aware to have posted this cynical eBay comment. Does it not undermine your constructive and big-hearted gesture toward Schultz?

@Mikel_Jollett An important observation, very well stated!
@ewarren Preach, sister @ewarren!
@_waleedshahid @AOC A Wealth Tax &amp; higher tax rates on excessive income are fair policies to lessen economic inequality. If u believe being a billionaire is morally wrong, then stop using Walmart, Walgreens, Starbucks, Tesla, Facebook, regional banks &amp; countless others with billionaire shareholders.
@KenDilanianNBC It’s almost like the Iranians are saying “f***k you” to Trump by continuing to comply with the JCPA after he pulls out...
@Sarah_SKG_1983 There are also his self-destructive impulses, real mental illness &amp; terrible judgment that could bring him down at any time...
@Sarah_SKG_1983 I agree with you. But I was sure he wouldn’t survive the first year. There has to be a breaking point somewhere... right?
@FullFrontalSamB Joe Lieberman has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.
@Stop_Trump20 Absolutely
@WSJ @EdwardConard Same old, same old... 🤦🏻‍♂️
@melissa123090 @myjojo122 @mmpadellan Sounds like you are still talking about Bernie, which has nothing to do with my original tweet. Be well...
@melissa123090 @myjojo122 @mmpadellan Under the system we have, all serious candidates MUST affiliate with one of the two major parties in order to be viable.
@melissa123090 @myjojo122 @mmpadellan Also, since this thread deals with the utterly stupid, destructive &amp; irrelevant ‘who-qualifies-as-a-real-Democrat’ debate, may I ask which is more important to you: left-leaning values &amp; policies, or the Democratic Party?
@melissa123090 @myjojo122 @mmpadellan @mmpadellan’s tweet was an attempt to unify. @myjojo122 incorrectly accused him of trying to divide. That is the point I was making.
@rickwtyler Trump doesn’t have any core values (he doesn’t even have a core personality), so his “policies” span the ideological spectrum. But, he created a path for the ideologues around him to achieve several major conservative goals of the past 40 years. Consequences will be far-reaching.
@rickwtyler Awesome
@SamWangPhD As you rightly observe, the EC was meant to be a deliberative body of philosopher-kings with the power to “rescue” the “less enlightened” masses from a “bad” popular vote decision...reflecting the Founders’ “slight” reservations about pure democracy.
@SamWangPhD Since 435 of the 538 Electoral votes are distributed based on relative population across the states, eliminating winner-take-all would greatly reduce the likelihood of Electoral/Popular vote incongruence.
@SamWangPhD @SamWangPhD Great info, but u missed the key factor that drives Electoral/Popular vote incongruence: the winner-take-all allocation of Electoral votes adopted by most states, which disenfranchises everyone who did not vote for the candidate receiving the most votes in each state.
@Alyssa_Milano @debiowens Hell to the fucking yes
@neeratanden Just. Say. No.
@FMGhost09 @mmpadellan More importantly, let’s move on. I believe it is self-evident that Bernie would have won. Trump’s base is not nearly big enough to elect him. The margin of victory came from the 10% who wanted change—any change—and would have voted for Bernie. You can believe whatever you want.
@FMGhost09 @mmpadellan I campaigned for and voted for HRC. I did my part.
@FMGhost09 @mmpadellan Every single one of the 77,774 voters in MI, WI and PA who voted for Trump would have voted for Bernie. End of story.
@nature_art_ed @ABC 💯
@ABC Sad
@andylassner Nothing about Trump is real. Never has been.
@HerskowitzSuzan @mmpadellan Sad
@FMGhost09 @mmpadellan I’m no Bernie bro, but it’s not “bullshit.” He absolutely would have won. Do you understand why?
@mmpadellan Well, Bernie would have won. At the same time, it is quite unfortunate for all of us that their myopic, uncritical devotion to their political “savior” is the reason we have trump.
@AndrewNadeau0 @RSun82 Duh

@Lara_Schwartz @ReneeLibby2 I can relate—that’s infuriating! And then they openly fantasize about imposing their hipster view of progressivism on the country by force if necessary (e.g. “People should be jailed for misgendering!”) Somehow they’ve missed the point of liberalism.
@TheRickWilson What about lipstick and earrings?
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber At the very least, Carter Page is guilty of being the weirdest person ever.
@TheRickWilson Yes, if it’s just Trump trying to intimidate Cohen. But I keep wondering if the Russians are helping Trump intimidate Cohen. They refrained during the Cold War, but in the current environment, it seems plausible that Russians could shoot, poison, kidnap Americans on US soil.
@RadioFreeTom @AriMelber I loved watching the two schizophrenics, the sycophant and Putin’s makeover-guy banter for a half hour—great television!

@UrsulaV @kirstenppitt @Jason_McEwan @KellyJoBluen @shabbirie I hear you...
@UrsulaV @kirstenppitt @Jason_McEwan @KellyJoBluen @shabbirie 2/ ...and I’m grateful that my wife had the time and patience to help me, because it made me better, and her better and us better.” Please consider that “it is though” *could* have been shorthand for all of that. Language is imperfect and we all use it imprecisely on-the-fly.
@UrsulaV @Jason_McEwan @KellyJoBluen @shabbirie I feel like I could say the same... And you are right, I actually don’t know for sure that no one was demanding anything at the coffee shop. I’m trying to advocate for deeper listening all around.
@UrsulaV @kirstenppitt @Jason_McEwan @KellyJoBluen @shabbirie 1/ I see what u mean, but we don’t know the deeper intent behind “it is though.” Rather than declaring ‘all women must always help all men,’ he may have meant something more like ‘it’s not a moral imperative for women to help but change can happen faster if they do...
@UrsulaV @Jason_McEwan @KellyJoBluen @shabbirie No one at the coffee shop was “demanding” anything, nor is @Jason_McEwan
@KellyJoBluen @shabbirie @Jason_McEwan While it’s true that women are not “responsible” for male enlightenment, in fact, it’s impossible for anyone to know, based on his one statement, where this particular man’s psyche lies on  the *continuum* of entrenchment in/liberation from the patriarchal world-view.
@KellyJoBluen Asking to hear more about what he meant would actually have been *more* empowering for her than immediately walking away...
@KellyJoBluen More soulful to take a deep breath &amp; ask him to say more about what he meant before reacting—not because she “owes” him that, but because that’s what truth seekers do. Unreflectively projecting 10,000 generations of injustice onto 1 guy in a coffee shop so quickly helps no one.
@samstein His one meaningful “concession” was that he acknowledged that “much of the border is already protected by natural barriers, such as mountains and water”—tantamount to giving up many miles of “wall.”

@derekwillis @AOC 2/ We are now seeing clear signs that Millennials are impacting the wider culture in ways that, in the present moment, are bewildering to many, but will soon be regarded as normal and routine.
@derekwillis @AOC 1/ Millennials aren’t big on pretense or formalities. They value practicality &amp; have no tolerance for authority without substance (i.e. they expect people who lead them to add real value)—all of which flies in the face of DC’s culture of strategy, appearances, &amp; manipulation.

@DavidJollyFL I never imagined the entire Republican party would conspire to defraud the country &amp; commit treason en masse, for the sole purpose of controlling the Judicial Branch for the foreseeable future (plus, I assumed, they’d get to do that anyway, under Pence). #FUBAR
@DavidJollyFL I foresaw every bit of the chaos &amp; criminality—including the worst parts that haven’t come to light yet. BUT I never in my wildest dreams imagined the Republican-led Congress would be complicit! I was sure Trump would be gone by the end of 2017. That part I got wrong. Sad.

@jbarro She just wanted you to feel accepted...
@davidfrum @SpeakerPelosi’s letter is a masterpiece, but the rhetoric is way too highbrow for Trump—he won’t understand the message without someone having to fill him in. Initially, Trump did not even understand Mattis’ resignation letter, which was much more straightforward. #dumbitdown

@ishenarobinson @cdorsey04 @AOC Yes! Well said @ishenarobinson!That’s a very common—and totally bogus—argument among conservatives. Everyone who works to the best of his/her ability (as well as children, the disabled and the elderly) should be paid enough to cover his/her basic human needs!
@AOC Great answer, @AOC!
@RYP__ I hesitate to ask why you referenced Huma Abedin... why did you?
@hardball @HardballChris @billmaher @hardball @HardballChris Maybe your struggle to articulate Omarosa’s last name is a sign from God that you should not be putting her on television in the first place...

@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @anniekarni @IndraNooyi would be an excellent choice!
@HillReporter Duh
@thehill It seems as or more likely that the Russians are manipulating @LindseyGrahamSC, no?
@JohnKasich @CNN @CuomoPrimeTime I guess @cnn is as good a place as any for @JohnKasich to hang out until the primary challenge (or primaries, in the likely event that Trump either chooses not to run for re-election or is precluded from doing so).
@RYP__ Al Jazeera is way ahead of its skis here.
@MSNBCPR @Morning_Joe @clairecmc @NBCNews @MSNBC Put her out to pasture, instead.
@Patrickesque Agreed

@TheRickWilson But tweeting is so much easier than senatoring.
@itsJeffTiedrich Ehh, I’m a big fan. But this is not your best work...
@JillWineBanks His ultra-conservative legal and public policy positions are despicable. However, given his close association with the Bushes (and Mueller), it seems plausible that Barr may be playing Trump. As AG, he may well turn out to be a defender of democracy. #cautiouslyhopeful

@MoiraEwesfulone @nowthisnews @ewarren Yes
@MoiraEwesfulone @nowthisnews @ewarren It’s not her life story that makes @ewarren exceptional. It’s her being. She is a rare combination of strength and compassion, of empathy with boundaries, of fierceness and love, of brainpower and heart. Her authenticity shines.
@AprilDRyan Damn straight!
@nowthisnews @ewarren @ewarren is an exceptional human being ❤️❤️❤️
@adamcbest I detest Rand Paul. I also detest groupthink. Dr. Paul is not a 🇨🇦ian citizen or permanent resident of 🇨🇦 &amp;, therefore, not covered by the 🇨🇦ian single-payer system. He’s paying cash to have surgery at a reputable facility that happens to be located in 🇨🇦.
@EdKrassen Right, especially if he never actually learned the geography of the US before the dementia set in.
@selectedwisdom @selectedwisdom I greatly respect you, Sir. But what exactly is “good” about this “news?” Is it not more reasonable to assume that he’s a lying liar telling lies?

@mccaffreyr3 I don’t know if @dbongino would explicitly advocate for open-carry nuclear weapons or not. I do know that he cannot rationally argue that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear bump-fire gunstocks, but not nukes.

@NoahCRothman Disagree. Like all other rules, norms and conventions, the phenomenon you describe will not occur, in the case of Trump.

@Justician2 @mccaffreyr3 For me, the order of preference is reversed, but I’m grateful for both of these true leaders!
@adamcbest Good point
@DavidCornDC @DavidCornDC I think of it this way: it’s hard to imagine a set of circumstances in which suppressing the truth &amp; keeping it suppressed would be more challenging, daunting and unlikely. DJT’s life of crime will continue to be rigorously scrutinized until the end of time...
@LEBassett @AOC Don’t you love it?! Ha!
@maddow Nice knowing you. Thanks for the great work!
@AriMelber @vajohna @AriMelber Counselor, the article states that gold foil underscores “the decadence of this rare variety of pear.” I also appreciate @adegiulio’s existentialist reading of the text. “Nobody built like you, you design yourself.”

@brithume .@brithume In fairness, he has changed US tax policy &amp; re-aligned the entire world order to suit his personal needs, &amp; exploited the US Presidenncy for his own financial gain in countless ways. But, yeah, it’s nice that our bighearted prez is working for free!
@jimbatz @ktumulty @brithume Exactly right!
@TheRickWilson I’d take Carrot Top over DJT any day!
@DustyOldBooksS1 @Robbin_Young @AOC Not a chance. @AOC’s popularity is completely organic. It’s the baseless attempts to smear her that are being “fast tracked” by the Republican “Powers that Be.”
@WalkerBragman Her response to this straightforward question was deeply disappointing. She did not even acknowledge the specific here-and-now atrocities that gave rise to BLM. For the rest of the hour she shined. And she’s going to make Trump’s life a living hell. So, there’s that...
@TheBeatWithAri @Peggynoonannyc @OfficialALT The Kofi Annan of what you got on!
@itsJeffTiedrich Thanks for the deep belly laugh

@FMGhost09 Touché ha
@FMGhost09 Silly lol
@FMGhost09 5/ Thanks for the great insights!
@FMGhost09 4/ Fun fact: based on your calcs, under proportional allocation, HRC would have received 48.1% of electoral votes (vs 48.3% of popular) to DJT’s 47.2% of electoral votes (vs 46.1% of popular).
@FMGhost09 3/ I did not realize that, as you have shown, proportional allocation creates the possibility for unallocated electoral votes (your “votes left hanging”), which happens when third-party votes are diluted across too many candidates.
@FMGhost09 2/ Since the distribution of electoral votes across states is based on population, were it not for the winner-take-all approach, one would expect the popular/electoral votes to be in-sync (except in rare instances in extremely close elections).
@FMGhost09 1/ Nice work! You’ve highlighted the fact that it’s the *winner-take-all* allocation of electoral votes by most states that creates the possibility for incongruent popular vote/electoral vote results.
@BillKristol As George Washington strongly cautioned us, political parties should not have that kind of power.
@DavidCornDC Though poised and articulate and in command as always, @SpeakerPelosi’s face and eyes indicate that she is LIVID! Wonder what happened in that WH meeting?

@CarrieHKelly @DeanMur27067734 @wef @FBI No one is saying that, @CarrieHKelly. For better or worse, strategy &amp; optics matter in our media saturated society. Apparently the organizers felt that, in this case, the political risks outweigh the potential benefits. Who knows? I do know that white rights r not under attack 😎
@DeanMur27067734 @SuzanneKelleher @ktumulty @adamcbest Yes, I respect that &amp; I sincerely apologize that my comment can easily be read as conveying “urban superiority” (which I do not believe or intend). I farmed in rural TN for a year—one of the happiest of my life. And I know plenty of rural people who embrace diversity. Apologies!
@SuzanneKelleher @ktumulty @adamcbest Rather than dumb, I think of them as emotionally challenged &amp; under-experienced in terms of exposure to the range of diversity that those of us who live in cities are so fortunate to have been enjoying for the past 40+ years. And, yes, media is too focused on them.
@SuzanneKelleher @ktumulty @adamcbest .@suzannekelleher Yes, I keep reminding everyone of that. This is still the same country that elected Barack Obama twice!
@ktumulty .@ktumulty Or, at least they support a president who half listens to briefings that make his eyes glaze over, who then attempts to formulate a point of view on the fly utilizing whatever misunderstood key words he remembers hearing at the briefings.
@Lawrence Among the most delusional things he’s ever said publicly—and that’s saying something!
@LetsHearItForMe @AviAhvee That is a very insightful analysis!
@MalcolmNance .@MalcolmNance It’s like the key words from two years of briefings that made his eyes glaze over have finally coagulated in his learning-disabled brain, such that he was able to vomit them out today in a 90-minute string of distortions &amp; factoids with no historical context.

@LEBassett 8 .@LEBassett I should also mention that @NikkiHaley is another example of a “likeable,” charismatic, &amp; eminently electable woman with broad appeal. And *that* is something that should scare us all!!!
@leftyjennyc If we can’t respect, get along &amp; compromise with other left-leaning Americans, our democracy will be crushed by the authoritarianism &amp; fascism that threaten us. I betcha @JenNJuice44 voted for HRC in 2016, even though she preferred Sanders. Am I right?
@leftyjennyc Can we let the hostility go &amp; rally behind progress? @JenNJuice44 is a lovely person. Did u bother to look at her feed b4 condemning her? I assure u that u &amp; Jen agree on almost all issues of public policy, &amp; ur characterization of her “mentality” is way off. What’s the prob?

@BillKristol @BillKristol In 2020, the Democratic candidate will be running against @JohnKasich or @NikkiHaley, not @MittRomney
@Macros1 @LEBassett @SunandSipCups Totally unhelpful
@Patrickesque Bernie won’t be the Democratic nominee in 2020. Neither will Hillary. Let’s move on and fight the very real cancer of authoritarianism that is tearing the country apart.
@joseph9love @LEBassett No party loyalty here. I am vehemently against political parties on principle. Unfortunately, for now, we have a two-party system in which voters are forced to make a binary choice. So I will vote for the relatively more left leaning candidate (i.e. the Democrat).
@thehill .@thehill .@LindseyGrahamSC Caucus Room dinner 1/20/2009 #RepublicanHypocrisy
@Dax_x98 Nope
@LEBassett 7 .@LEBassett I am not saying that Liz Warren is not viable. It’s way too early to make a judgment. Warren may well prove to have sufficiently broad enough appeal to win the Presidential election. My fingers are crossed!!!
@LEBassett 6 .@LEBassett I hope we’ll have ranked choice voting someday soon. Until then, voters face a binary choice. We on the Left deserve the most politically VIABLE candidate that most closely (but never perfectly) represents our values.
@LEBassett 5 .@LEBassett Finally, I see how real &amp; pervasive &amp; insidious sexism still is. Yet sexism does not explain every outcome that u &amp; I don’t like. Stacey Abrams, Michelle Obama &amp; many other women are inspiring to a *broader* swath of Americans than HRC was.
@LEBassett 4 .@LEBassett Ultimately, in a two-way national election, I will get out &amp; VOTE for the DEMOCRATIC nominee—WHOMEVER s/he is, regardless of whether I like the person or feel that the primary process was fair or believe that the person qualifies as a “real” Democrat. U should too!
@LEBassett 3 .@LEBassett Warren is my personal first choice for President—hands down. Easy choice! But if, as the situation develops, another left-leaning candidate appears more likely to WIN the national election, I will vote for THAT candidate in the primaries.
@LEBassett 2 .@LEBassett Warren is deeply inspiring to *me* I can think of no one who has ever made a clearer, more compelling case re the need for govt to serve as a check against the dangers of capitalism—including Sanders! I LOVE her! But, I love PROGRESS more, and I want to WIN!
@LEBassett 1 .@LEBassett I hear the deep &amp; understandable frustration &amp; I share ur vision for a less biased world. However, Presidential politics is about understanding the national psyche as it is today &amp; running the right candidate at the right time. It’s about scoring a win for progress.
@SIRGOLDIE17 @triweasle @realDonaldTrump .@SIRGOLDIE17 Absolutely false. That is not true of any prosecutor—ever. (No prosecutor has ever come close to a perfect record.) Mueller’s career as a prosecutor actually had a somewhat rocky start.
@leftyjennyc @DNC .@leftyjennyc But what if BS *is* the Dem nominee? (He probably won’t be, but that’s not the point of the question.) Will u waste ur vote with a write in? Stay home? Vote for the Republican? I don’t like HRC, but I voted for her anyway—because I care about issues &amp; the country.
@JenNJuice44 @lark_notes @LesRhoads @WolaverBell @leftyjennyc @DNC Exactly, .@JenNJuice44. Well said!

@Slate .@Slate @SlateCulture @SamuelAAdams Wrong. The post-credits scene is intellectually honest. It reminds us that a large swath of Americans believe that Cheney’s atrocities were justified. The decision to include this scene is one of the most impressive things about the movie.

@ktumulty .@ktumulty You couldn’t be more wrong! Fresh chopped parsley adds much to a green salad—not to mention that it’s essential to a delicious tabbouleh. Sicilian “gravy,” turkey stuffing and Vietnamese Pho would be lacking without it. And so much more!
@ktumulty And with one tweet .@ktumulty dismisses the whole of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern gastronomy 😜
@ktumulty Yes, I’ll agree to that. There’s no such thing as “too much” garlic.

@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 10/ Any/all thoughtful, competent, charismatic, electable candidates who in good faith will fight for a center-left or progressive platform should have a fair chance at Dem nomination without having to tap dance naked on the table to earn some special party badge!
@bjcreigh Cute! Ha
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 9/ Loyalty is due the parties *only* to the extent that they advance the larger process of American democracy. The parties are peripheral constructs that occupy privileged positions of stewardship. The parties *serve* democracy. They are not democracy.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 8/ Bottom line: we all have the right to expect parties to operate in service of and in strict subjugation to the larger American democratic process.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 7/ Anyone can claim to be a Democrat. So all the talk about who is/is not a “real” one leaves me unmoved. I find more reason to be suspicious of those with long-standing ties to the party, and anyone who exercises too much power within the party.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 6/ It is far more important that the nomination process be truly democratic, than that the formalities of the party be strictly observed. George Washington warned us about this!
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 5/ Whenever parties and party leaders operate in ways that are un-democratic, they threaten the democratic foundations of the Republic. We must demand from the parties fair competition and transparency. When they fail in this, things get tricky.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 4/ While political parties are technically “private” organizations, they are also stewards of some of the most cherished aspects of our democratic process. The parties occupy a unique space that is quasi-public and quasi-private.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 3/ The far-right has hijacked the R party. All the more reason that the D party must be a place where the full spectrum of centrist to progressive ideas can be debated and processed into a coherent, viable national political strategy—a very, very tall order!
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 2/ Though the political spectrum is wide, for as long as we continue to have only two major parties, there are only two platforms on which viable candidates can run.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright 1/ I don’t presume to know u. You’re obviously a passionate and com-passionate activist, which I respect &amp; admire greatly. I care about specific issues, most especially how public policy effects the vulnerable &amp; less-advantaged. I assume you share these concerns.
@neiltwit @stephen_wood @TheAtlantic @OrrChris That one’s historical fiction. Different genre
@stephen_wood @neiltwit @TheAtlantic @OrrChris Perhaps the point you were trying to make is that biopics are not what they used to be? Ha
@Kaessa @ToolshedRob462 @Patrickesque @StephenBright Fair question, but you implied that you know about a whole “mountain” of skeletons in Bernie’s closet... He should have released them. I suspect he’s hiding a greater level of income or wealth than some would think appropriate for a populist. Maybe worse. IDK
@StephenBright @MemeDecker @Patrickesque I respect your honest belief. What you’re missing is the huge block of Trump voters who didn’t like Trump that much but simply wanted ANYONE with a different message—far left, far right...didn’t matter...just had to be different. Sanders would have captured most of that group.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque That’s a very dismissive (and inaccurate) view of Sanders’ appeal. No Presidential candidate has ever been more qualified than HRC. Sanders also was more than sufficiently qualified. Qualifications aren’t the only consideration. Equally important are policy and electability.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque HRC has been around the block a few thousand times. She knew she had dangerously high negatives and baggage that made her vulnerable. Blinded by her entitlement, she put the progressive agenda (and democracy itself) at much greater risk than was necessary.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque U said political parties should have structure, a fair process, etc. HRC, DWS, HBD3 &amp; others conspired to ensure there was no fair process in 2016. They threw their weight around to discourage/block other more electable candidates from running, then rigged against Sanders #fraud
@StephenBright @Patrickesque Presidential politics is about understanding the ever-changing national psyche &amp; running right candidate at right time. There was no real consideration of anyone other than HRC. She wasn’t thinking of the country. She believed she was entitled to a coronation. Now we have Trump.
@CapehartJ .@CapehartJ Right! Keep saying that!
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque BTW, your Twitter handle is shouting
@stephen_wood @TheAtlantic @OrrChris Lincoln
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @StephenBright @Phxflyer @Patrickesque @DEEPEEZYISHERE That is the most insightful, most important thing you’ve said. I mourn the lack of willingness/courage of almost anyone in public life to bring that kind of honesty to bear on any of the daunting challenges we face. Great input.
@MalcolmNance @charliekirk11 💯
@stephen_wood @TheAtlantic @OrrChris Yes
@TheAtlantic @OrrChris .@OrrChris So the double entendre in the movie title, “Vice” was lost on you?
@susanbenton611 @StephenBright @Patrickesque Russians had a profound influence, but they are not all-powerful. They may have succeed (barely) in putting Trump over the top, but you make it sound like it was all up to them. Obviously not. Even Trump himself and the Russians did not expect Trump to win.
@StephenBright @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque He was the leader of an actual liberal movement that was very much in-line with the national psyche. The DNC willfully schemed against him to ensure that HRC got the nomination. They cheated! He then endorsed her and made a real effort. What more do you want from the man?!
@RMadkin @StephenBright @Patrickesque No, the Russians are not that powerful. They may have succeed (barely) in putting him over the top, but you make it sound like it was all up to them. Obviously not. Even Trump himself and the Russians did not expect Trump to win.
@ndabraha @thatgingerish @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright Not all candidates are equally vulnerable to Russian interference.
@theOnlyOWP @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright I understand all of that, and you’re not wrong in observing that both parties are compromised in similar ways. However, no Democrat would have appointed a Gorsuch or a Kavanaugh. And, sadly, in the end, that may be the only difference that matters.
@Botanicalsrock @StephenBright @Patrickesque What I said is that she should have known how much baggage she carried &amp; how vulnerable &amp; deeply unpopular she was &amp; not entered the primaries in the first place. Her weakness in the national election was self-evident long before the primaries.
@Botanicalsrock @StephenBright @Patrickesque “Democrat” is a label. I’m not sure what the label means, what it’s implications are, or why we would want to debate whether or not any particular candidate “qualifies” for the label. Sanders is left-leaning. In a two-party system, any viable candidate must run as either D or R.
@Botanicalsrock @StephenBright @Patrickesque Apparently 40% of the delegates (superdelegates included) at the 2016 Democratic National Convention believed that Sanders qualifies as a Democrat for purposes of Presidential politics.
@Botanicalsrock @StephenBright @Patrickesque @Botanicalsrock Give me a minute, I’ll repeat myself...
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque At 51, I’m a little old to be a Bernie Bro. Then again, Brett Kavanaugh is still just an overgrown frat boy... so who knows!
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque Should be, unless you’ve voted Republican at some point. I never have...
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque @DEEPEEZYISHERE you LOVE that convenient label, don’t you!
@theOnlyOWP @Cheers464646 @Patrickesque @StephenBright @theonlyowp Good input, as long as you’re not saying there is no meaningful difference between the parties.
@Kaessa @ToolshedRob462 @Patrickesque @StephenBright I’m no expert on Sanders’ career in public life, but he appears 2 be a model of consistency w transparent, positive motives centered around fairness &amp; justice. His message has not changed, going back his days as a young student activist at UChicago. All politicians have skeletons
@Vauxhall02 @Kaessa @Patrickesque @StephenBright Right! Try to be nicer though...
@Kaessa @Vauxhall02 @Patrickesque @StephenBright Her negatives have been consistently too high going back to the 90s, such that if the Democratic Party was committed to winning and to progress, it would have nominated someone other than HRC.
@TopherReisner @MikeHersh @StephenBright @Patrickesque 🤦🏻‍♂️ Hillary Clinton has nothing whatsoever in common with the Trumpster
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque But you’re among the last people I’d want to fight with, since we probably have the exact same voting record.
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque Nah... You’re just not good at nuance...
@DEEPEEZYISHERE @Phxflyer @StephenBright @Patrickesque Obviously, I voted for Hillary Clinton.
@SecularGovt @StephenBright @Patrickesque Right.
@Raffiatim @Patrickesque @StephenBright Of course!
@JonSofen1980 @StephenBright @Patrickesque Jon, if u don’t already see that Trump is severely mentally ill &amp; is self destructing...keep watching! Trump will never win any political race ever again. He *barely* won this time—just 77,744 votes in WI, MI &amp; PA. I do like ur sense of urgency though! Got to keep eye on ball!
@JonSofen1980 @StephenBright @Patrickesque .@JonSofen1980 Neither Trump nor Bernie will be on the ballot in 2020. Not necessarily because of Mueller or the new Democratic House, but because Trump will self-destruct. That’s what Trump does.
@MikeHersh @StephenBright @Patrickesque Billary functioned as a team. Rightly or wrongly, legal or not, you can be sure that during the Clinton Administration HRC was privy to things—on a consistent basis—that no other candidate ever has been.
@MikeHersh @StephenBright @Patrickesque She was also a very engaged, informed, and influential First Lady for 8 years. No one can compete with that. I adore Obama, but foreign policy was not his strong suit (although it was far better than W’s)
@BamUFTNYC @StephenBright @Patrickesque Apparently 40% of the delegates (superdelegates included) at the 2016 Democratic National Convention believed that Sanders qualifies as a Democrat for purposes of Presidential politics. I already said I don’t want Sanders to run in 2020 and won’t support him in the primaries.
@4gottenflapper @StephenBright @Patrickesque Apparently 40% of the delegates (superdelegates included) at the 2016 Democratic National Convention believed that Sanders qualifies as a Democrat for purposes of Presidential politics.

@hersheyhiker @StephenBright @Patrickesque .@hersheyhiker Damn, you’re right! Trump’s margin of victory vs. votes for Stein—MI: 10,704&lt;51,463; PA:44,292&lt;49,941; WI: 22,748&lt;31,072
@Kaessa @Patrickesque @StephenBright What I said is that she should have known how much baggage she carried &amp; how vulnerable &amp; deeply unpopular she was &amp; not entered the primaries in the first place. Her weakness in the national election was self-evident long before the primaries.
@theholycovfefe @StephenBright @Patrickesque Strongly disagree. Trump *barely* won the Electoral College—by a margin of just 77,744 votes in WI, MI &amp; PA. Trump was not inevitable. But I love your screen name!
@StephenBright @Patrickesque You’re not wrong
@stuffhedoes @Patrickesque @StephenBright I agree with you, and I love that you’re a teacher. But I hope you got out and voted for HRC, instead of enabling Trump simply because your preferred candidate wasn’t on the ballot!
@JaymayAllDay @StephenBright @Patrickesque What I said is that she should have how much baggage she carried and how vulnerable and deeply unpopular she was and not entered the primaries in the first place. Her weakness in the national election was self-evident long before the primaries.
@vmich8667 @StephenBright @Patrickesque .@vmich8667 Sadly, many progressive Millennials have not learned that ideological purity is the enemy of real progress. The next 30 years of SCOTUS decisions will tech them that there actually was a meaningful diff between “corporate sellout Hillary” &amp; “corporate sellout Trump!”

@vmich8667 @StephenBright @Patrickesque .@vmich8667 I agree with u 1000%! Of course I voted for HRC, in spite of my dislike of her. Any Sanders supporters who stayed home because their nominee wasn’t on the ticket should be spanked and sent to bed!
@AnneBradbury5 @StephenBright @Patrickesque There are reasons that “massive disinformation campaigns” are effective against someone like HRC, but they do not work against someone like Barack Obama.
@Patrickesque @StephenBright With respect @Patrickesque, placing second in the primaries has almost nothing to do with viability in a national election. Apples and oranges.
@SPersists @StephenBright @Patrickesque Agreed that there are minimum required qualifications. Besides Trump, the only unqualified Pres/VP nominees since WWII have been W, Palin &amp; perhaps Quale. So it’s fairly rare. Assuming candidates are minimally qualified, WINNING is what matters.
@itsJeffTiedrich You are super funny!
@StephenBright @Patrickesque More importantly, “bases”	don’t win elections. The non-partisan, non-ideological majority provides the margin of victory. In 2016, the majority of these voters wanted something new—anything new. Most would have chosen a reasonable lefty (Sanders) over the incoherent Trump.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque Most “true Ds” would have come out for Sanders. In any event, light turnout of HRC’s base beats full turnout of Trump’s base. This is still the same country that elected Obama twice. There were not more scared whites in 2016 than in 2012—more visible, but not greater in number.
@MargueriteEHill @StephenBright @Patrickesque “Democrat” is a label. I’m not sure what the label means, what it’s implications are, or why we would want to debate whether or not any particular candidate “qualifies” for the label. Sanders is left-leaning.

@StephenBright @Patrickesque @StephenBright Good talk!
@StephenBright @Patrickesque Again, politics is not about who u or I prefer. It’s about understanding the current national psyche &amp; who can WIN. Trump’s base was never large enough to win. He won with his base PLUS the I’ll-try-anything voters. Sanders would have had HRC’s larger base PLUS those.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque Don’t know what u mean by “It will come out someday.” It’s been common knowledge since election day. Please stop acting like u wouldn’t prefer Sanders to Trump. Of course you would. I’ve already explained how Sanders would have won, and my argument is pretty difficult to refute.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque I agree with you that Sanders should not run in 2020. Left leaning voters have a very deep bench this time—as we would have last time, had Princess Hillary and her sense of entitlement not gotten in their way in 2016.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque There is no doubt that Sanders would have won. Trump won the Electoral College by 77,744 votes in WI, MI &amp; PA. A much larger number of voters in those three states were voting for change—any change—and would have voted for Sanders over Trump.
@StephenBright @Patrickesque It’s not about being “the most qualified candidate ever.” It’s about winning. Period. She should have had the humility to see that any number of other Democrats, including Sanders, would have beat Trump. I adored HRC in the 90s. Too many years in DC have rotted her soul.
@Patrickesque @StephenBright .@Patrickesque Too bad for all of us and for the entire world that Hillary Clinton did not have the wisdom or the grace to step aside in 2016!

@NothappyMatt @JamesFLoveIV @CNN .@NothappyMatt There is no healthcare system in the developed world that prevents people of means from going outside the public system and privately purchasing any medical services they want.

@Amy_Siskind .@Amy_Siskind I loved HRC in the 90s, but too many years in Washington brought out the worst in her. She should have accepted that her time had passed, and put her weight behind a better nominee.
@Amy_Siskind .@amy_siskind I deeply respect you &amp; value your weekly chronicle of Trump Admin’s unending offenses, but it’s time to acknowledge that HRC should have known how weak she was &amp; had the humility to yield to any number of other Dems who surely would have won.
@chrislhayes @WindyCityTimes .@chrislhayes Keep reminding people that, under the Law, if an immigrant enters the country “illegally” &amp; subsequently is granted political asylum, his/her entry is deemed to have been legal—retroactively.
@meyers_andi Again, obviously, under our democratic system of government, we count people and votes, not counties or square miles. Also, HRC won the popular vote by 2,868,691 votes, not 1.5 million.
@meyers_andi Most Americans live in densely populated areas. Obviously, democracy is based on population, not square miles.
@meyers_andi That’s not correct. Trump barely won the Electoral College by an extremely thin margin of just 77,744 votes in WI, MI and PA  (which is 0.057% of 136,669,237 total votes cast nationwide). This is still the same country that elected Barack Obama twice.
@barmore27 Nah, teaching children to think critically for themselves and to develop their emotional lives is the way to go.
@fivechapman @cajunchick25 Also, FYI there is no “leftist group” of any significant size that is planning an insurrection. Take a deep breath, Grasshopper...
@fivechapman @cajunchick25 You think so? How would that new civil war work exactly? Aren’t the Libtards &amp; the Trumpsters (not to mention the Moderate Centrist Majority) all living and working in the same cities and towns and churches and schools and workplaces? Shirts and skins, maybe?
@cajunchick25 @mmgh17 Much of what you think is “illegal” is not illegal at all. Existing Immigration Law was enacted through a democratic process. If you don’t like it, there is a Constitutional, democratic process in place to try to change it.
@cajunchick25 @mmgh17 In other words, regardless of how an asylum-seeking immigrant enters the country, it is not possible to determine if such person’s entry into the US was legal or illegal, until AFTER his/her claim for asylum has been adjudicated by a Court.
@cajunchick25 @mmgh17 Under the Law, if an immigrant enters the country “illegally” &amp; subsequently is granted political asylum, his/her entry is deemed to have been LEGAL—retroactively. If you don’t like the current law, fight to change it. But first, you need to understand it.
@sharoncabana @Cernovich Of all the delusional, distorted, FUBAR un-truths I’ve ever heard about Barack Obama, the idea that he was “raised groomed to be a politician” takes the cake. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Congrats to you, Sharon!

@JHCollins7 @BasketOfAwesome @ColB The social justice warriors of the 1960s were a lot wiser than contemporary SJWs realize—as this new and purportedly more “enlightened” perspective on the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer TV special vividly illustrates.
@JHCollins7 @BasketOfAwesome @ColB Of course. It’s not either/or. But if you must make it either/or, put me down on the side of empowering victims of oppression through self awareness and self respect, rather than the current over-emphasis on “correcting” oppressors’ behavior.
@politico .@AshaRangappa_ @politico Please stop saying that the Trump Tower Moscow deal “didn’t materialize.” In all likelihood, the parties simply agreed to delay it until after  the election. Neither Trump nor Russia expected Trump to win.
