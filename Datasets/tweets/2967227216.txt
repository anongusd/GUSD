The whole noah thing is borrowed from a mesapotamian myth.  Also who has a 100 yr old parent? Any boat builders there? Noah was 600 and his sons 500. Really? (Wives not named. No credit for doing all the sandwiches... https://t.co/VxW81ANSdV

@Hillyhobbit @PeterAstrovik @ozhank626 @LetsBe_Rational @SouthernFL @FactsVsOpinion @thepoliticalcat @rebornja 34 penguins from 17 species
@Hart3Linda @DevAdvocat @Galicalla @thepoliticalcat @Hillyhobbit @PeterAstrovik 34 actually as there are 17 species of penguin.
@75ominac @DevAdvocat I love Christian marketing. About as tasteful as Christian dress sense.
@DevAdvocat Not the business of any priest. More than a few of them have their own set of sins,
@tutticontenti @DevAdvocat And note the colour difference. 7 fat smug fucks and their 'servants' who looked like they're so enjoying it
@I_Love_Atheism @ChessPiano @RichardDawkins That's an insult to chimps
@vjack @AtheismNTheCity Nice idea tho. Biggest opponents would be the bigots who now wouldn't get to cheat on their own religious tenets.
@HuffPostPol Why is that nasty deranged war criminal still getting air time?
@RTCCclimatenews Perfectly portrays the haughty racist attitude of Abbott &amp; cronies. Perhaps a 'PacificLivesMatter' campaign is in order.
@Wonkette I guess they've missed the irony of Oath Keepers protecting an Oath Breaker
@RichardA @ProfBrianCox Just hardback. Ban won't last long- tv news item featured the author and they ignored the Christian looneys.
@IanAdAstra @RichardDawkins Ban won't last long now it's made the news. Most Kiwis have no time for US-style Christian nutters.
@AMcBay_NSS @NatSecSoc One thing about forcing religion down people's throat - it helps create more atheists. (But still, don't do it.)
@satanicpsalms @michaelshermer You guys are great. I tell people I support ST, they go 'Arrggh' - they read your values and go 'Oh, I agree'
@NatSecSoc On NZ national news 2nite. Interviewed author who explained its purpose. No air time given to looney Xian 'Family Council'
@ShurelyNot @NatSecSoc No just a blip - is a best seller as an e-book. Soon be back on shelves as most Kiwis hate US-style Xian looneys.
@colin_melville @NatSecSoc Still come on down. We are one of the least Xian countries in the world. Atheists very welcome.
@NatSecSoc NZ here: just off the shelves til age classified. It won't stay banned now it's in the news. For 50% Kiwis, Christian = idiot
@AJEnglish By that I mean on the screen. Why do we notice a person's race when, if they are good at it, they should get the job?
@AJEnglish James Bond is now a 21st century character and Idris is a great actor (see Luther). Just put them together and see the sparks fly
@BBCWorld Coward is missing the whole point. Give the $ to conservation, go and take some photos. Don't throw your rich, white weight around
@g_m_hodgson @NatSecSoc As bad as this is, it bores them more than anything and tends to make them more atheist than theist in later life
@ThinkAtheist Ah ha - it's the alcohol that makes us so militant
In NZ there is such a fringe element incl some in Maoridom who require religious respect as part of cultural respect https://t.co/24gYhMzCaD
@MrOzAtheist Same over in NZ. Guns just never feature in an urban lifestyle. Such an alien concept to be an 'ammosexual'.
Sums up the gun nuts perfectly
