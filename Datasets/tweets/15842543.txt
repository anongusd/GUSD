@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 You can‚Äôt find one, so yeah I guess so.
@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 "During 2013 and 2014, only 4 of 69,406 authors of peer-reviewed articles on global warming, 0.0058% or 1 in 17,352, rejected AGW. Thus, the consensus on AGW among publishing scientists is above 99.99%, verging on unanimity."		From a 2016 paper: https://t.co/DREeQTqxNA
@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 Here's a challenge: find a respected scientific organization who does not believe that humans are primarily responsible for climate change. Here's a WP article with a list of those that do.		https://t.co/4dOz46wM7z
@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 Okay, we've spent 5 decades coming to the conclusion that humans are responsible for climate change. How many more decades do you need?
@AudreyP70854910 @KenGardner11 Warming cannot be reversed, merely slowed (and hopefully ultimately stopped). Warming that has already occurred is "locked in," as they say. The only hope of reversing warming is carbon capture technology, which is still in its infancy and expensive.
@AudreyP70854910 @KenGardner11 AGW has been studied by thousands of scientists since the 1970s and their conclusion is that we are responsible for it. We should listen to them, just like one would listen to a prognosis given to you by a doctor.
@AudreyP70854910 @KenGardner11 So if a hurricane is coming, would your solution be to not do anything because the models might wrong? No, obviously, you hope for the best and prepare for the worst. If the predictive models turn out to be right, then it's too late to prevent damage once the damage is done.
@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 But know that AGW has been studied and accepted since the 1970s. Fossil fuel companies internally acknowledged it as fact for decades while publicly dismissing concerns of it for profit. The Republican Party's stance on climate change is the result. https://t.co/HWBz84f4gP
@KenGardner11 @AudreyP70854910 It's fine, it's a waste of time to argue because I'm not going to change your mind. And I get it; it's more convenient to believe climate change isn't a problem and that everything is "just the way it is."

@brithume https://t.co/1G6Pwbgj70
@brithume It's just as bad, if not worse, because not acknowledging that we're causing it means not acknowledging that we can lessen the causes of it and ultimately stop it. It also doesn't seem especially smart to disbelieve something that 98% of scientists see as fact.
