In the latest move to cruelly punish Palestinian civilians, Trump is redirecting $200 million in humanitarian aid intended for Gaza and the West Bank. 	This is a moral outrage and strategic blunder that puts the region at greater risk.		https://t.co/cntbqOAOJR

The work done by this facility and the sisters, incl. Madre (Sister) Amelia Contini, is the work of heroes.	This little girl pictured -- maybe 4 -- was handing out cookies.

The cruel conditions they will endure on the US side are worth the journey when they risk grave harm and death for them and their children here at home. 6/7		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
The women here talk about "sisterhood." They are in this for their lives. The mothers know the reality of long-term detention once they cross, separation from their children, etc. 	None of these are deterrents. They have no other choice. 5/7		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
About 50-60 get through a day to receive a Credible Fear Assessment from the U.S. government-- which determines if they are even eligible to continue to a proper hearing. So the waiting process could take weeks here. 4/7		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
Residents stay here because they are assigned a number at the border (a list that is jointly managed by the CBP and the Mexican border authorities). They currently have assigned 630+ numbers, but approximately 10 of each number (so thousands).		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
In this particular facility, there are 44 beds and currently 105 people -- all of whom are awaiting entry to the U.S. (The mats in the background of this picture serve as overflow bedding.) 2/7		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder https://t.co/gX1JW6kC1Z

In this facility, two doors down from a women's shelter, the men are "headed south, and not north." They are on the other end of the immigration process. 7/8		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
The men told us how exceedingly difficult it is to be detained and treated like a dangerous criminal. How could one justify that full-body shackles are necessary? 6/8		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
Since Jeff Sessions announced his "zero-tolerance" edict in April, all caught entering the country -- who are not seeking asylum from persecution -- are subjected to criminal, not civil, proceedings. 5/8		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
Some Operation Streamline cases are handled in a matter of hours, from arraignment to sentencing to deportation. 4/8		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
Operation Streamline -- for those unfamiliar -- is a joint DHS/ DOJ initiative (that dates back to 2005) that moves immigrants detained at the border through the criminal justice system in group hearings. 3/8		- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder

The staff seem like they're at least trying to serve the kids. But it feels like a sham, and it's hard not to be angry. They are working in a broken system, deliberately designed to break the spirits and prospects of these refugee children. 8/8	- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
We saw about 30-40 boys crammed into a tiny lunch room, sitting hip-to-hip. They smiled to see us. Some of them had such warm, soft faces. They are children. It was hard to keep it together. 7/8	- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder

These children are clearly incarcerated. One of our peers opened the front door and the alarm sounded, which was an instant reminder. The kids have no freedom of movement. They are allowed 2 calls a week (must be approved by the facility). 5/8	- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder
They‚Äôve traveled hundreds of miles to escape harm in their home countries. Most have gone through arduous, dangerous journeys to get here and are shocked to be arrested at the border. Many have no sense of what's ahead. 4/8	- @JessCantTweet | #JewsAtTheBorder

Only determined diplomacy can head-off this ever-growing conflict. To pin all hopes for peace on Hamas first changing its stripes is not a plan. It‚Äôs a fantasy. (5/5)
Further, the Palestinian leaders that HAVE renounced violence, recognized Israel and put their own people on the frontlines against terror are thrown under the bus by this admin's actions, like the embassy move. What message does that send about playing ball with this team? (4/5)
The fact that Kushner, Greenblatt and Friedman wrote 750 words on the crisis in Gaza with zero mention of the blockade shreds what little credibility the administration has on the issue. (3/5)
We, of course, agree that Hamas must stop their incendiary attacks on Israel. And it's also essential for Israel to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis that devastates the quality of life in Gaza, foments extremism and empowers Hamas. (2/5)

He may call us "blasphemous" for being pro-Israel, pro-peace, but Friedman and his far right allies have spent years openly expanding settlements, entrenching the occupation and opposing a two-state agreement in favor of a one-state nightmare. 9/10
His false claims about the occupation and request that the US government stop using the term "Israeli-occupied territories" had to be walked back by the State Department as "not... a shift in US policy."		https://t.co/8ztbklsztd 8/10
While during his confirmation hearings he testified that he would not support or advocate for Israeli annexation in the West Bank, he has since consistently acted to provide cover and support for Israeli leaders moving toward that goal.		https://t.co/lpCXYrkMrr 7/10
