@FWDus #Gcbacklog affects one country only while other 193 countries are not affected and can keep bringing all their nationals WITH FAMILIES and all them gets work permits. Estimating more than total work permits acquired by this one country in a year. All countries eligible for #h4ead
@FWDus highlight for #h4ead 	This is a bandaid to aid backlog issue	Most beneficiaries are women	Most have master and years of experience	Their counterparts from other countries became citizens much earlier	About 900K get GC or work permit EVERY YEAR. How did h4ead affect job market?
