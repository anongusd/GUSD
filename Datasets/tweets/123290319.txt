@stevewparkhurst A @car2goSeattle doesn't exactly look like an Uber, but he was highly intoxicated, so maybe.
.@lazybeard @SeattlePD I honked. There were other cars at intersection, but no one did anything. Light changed, I pulled away, dialed 911
Question: When someone is trying to get into your car, should you run the red light, even if the intersection is busy/hard to see around?
Still pretty shaken up this morning after a drunk man tried to get into my @car2goSeattle while I was stopped at a light last night.
@chrisguizlo The light timing here makes me want to scream sometimes. I've never sat through so many lights. that's just bad planning.
@chrisguizlo That sounds infuriating. I think it's easy to forget about the city streets when we talk about traffic here.

@seattlekim It's so incredibly frustrating. I've only belonged to two gyms in my life and both have been awful customer service experiences
@m3sweatt Was it down because of the announcement? DDoS? Or just weird timing? Also, it's still down for me.
The experience also filled me with anger on the day before Christmas. So thanks for that, @LAFitness. I bet that burned a few calories.
The one thing @LAFitness did do for me today is remind me why I hate joining gyms and guarantee I'll never join one of their again.
And the @LAFitness employee, who was not a manager, said his job was "to look pretty." He told me I shouldn't have waited so long to quit.

@jennyha_yes Worst part: I ordered two glasses before I knew
Anyway, I remembered why I hate The Met so much.
