This year, President Trump put $750 million for a new icebreaker in his budget proposal. The Senate did the same. But the House has taken a different tack—stripping the funds and diverting them toward the wall.
What will it take to build a fleet that’s adequate to fulfill the United States’ mission at the poles? 		The Coast Guard has said it needs six icebreakers. That will take years of design and building and it will cost billions of dollars. https://t.co/9EZtHNyCRa
