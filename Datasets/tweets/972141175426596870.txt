@DrDignity @SenFeinstein @BarackObama Your what‚Äôs wrong with America. SUE SUE SUE! Your ruining our country. Misuse is not the manufacturers fault. I don‚Äôt see any of you libs sueing Tide for the dumb shit kids eating them.
@SenFeinstein @BarackObama No you won‚Äôt.
@SenFeinstein Um.... your obsessed with him and arnt paid to tweet either, so look in the mirror. Oh and your old as hell and done this job to long. Time to retire.
@nikki_aurelius @realDonaldTrump We‚Äôve always hade fake news. He‚Äôs just the first person to call them out...
@Cmasse0164 @JoeWhit20014505 @SimonWynne @Blake_954 @realDonaldTrump Says the dems who repeatedly say he‚Äôs should be impeached but are to stupid to figure out how. How‚Äôs that Russia probe going? Oh ya.... idiots.
@SenFeinstein Ya I bet your hurting.....
@SenFeinstein Assault is an action dumb ass... not a type of weapon.
@caramida @bparkerparker @SenFeinstein Projecting does not mean already happened.... brother.
@GrammaGaz @SenFeinstein And thanks to your fine party we won‚Äôt have guns to protect anyone.... funny how that works huh?
@SenFeinstein Except now we need 7+ year loans to afford them....
@SenFeinstein To piss off libs... oh and it‚Äôs our right. Why do you drive a 100,000 dollar car? You don‚Äôt need it!
@SenFeinstein ‚ÄúAssault‚Äù is an action....
@SenFeinstein @RepMarcyKaptur That‚Äôs way too long.
@SenFeinstein Did I miss the part where a gun shot wound is a disease? Why not just have the FDA take a look? Idiots.
@SenFeinstein It hurts my brain to read the shit you post.... They have talked about it non stop and even conceded on some points. Keep trying to divide us from your ivory tower dummy.
@SenFeinstein Assault weapon is a made up term by morons like you. EVERY gun does what you just described  you idiot. Go ‚Äúsave‚Äù a glass of water from itself or something....
