@riledScientist @BubbaJoeJimBob1 My hope for each of us is that we can harness all of this energy and instead of allowing Trump to win by perpetuating negativity, we consciously convert it into positive action. Half of us are pissed off and haven't done one thing outside of social media to change a thing.
@riledScientist @BubbaJoeJimBob1 That's unfortunate. Living in anger diminishes your ability to create longterm positive gains for anyone - yourself included. We must do something to change the atrocities we're witnessing. Passion and motivation can inspire that change, but anger is not our longterm solution.
Worry does nothing but steal your joy and keep you very busy doing nothing.
@BubbaJoeJimBob1 @riledScientist Thank you @BubbaJoeJimBob1 you're spot on. We all have so much to be miserable about, and negativity bombards us every second of every day.
