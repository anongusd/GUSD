2nite and Sunday on https://t.co/h64zlKjG3C on @TBN 8/11pm ET the greatest impressionist ever @realrichlittle keeps us laughing. Don’t miss this comedy genius! https://t.co/vd7QOLBQ0B
To 26 Dems being bossed around by a power-mad brat:  You can end NOW w/ 2 simple words:	 “Change parties.”	 Switch to GOP &amp; this nightmare ends. The House goes Republican 223-209.  AOC &amp; her fellow socialist, racist, anti-Semitic agitators will be relegated to the kiddie table.
You gotta read this.  You just gotta.  Because like AOC, I'm making a list of those who don't!  https://t.co/CQE6DBVQ4w
I'll be on @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 9am ET today to describe how I was a stowaway on Air Force One during @realDonaldTrump trip to Vietnam and successfully hid in the cargo hold. Preview:  It was stinking cold in there and @PressSec never knew I was there. https://t.co/kHlsBw8MWW
Great perspective from @AriFleischer and I'd add that Israel protects holy sites not just for Jews, but for Christians AND Muslims, something that Palestinian Authority WON'T do. https://t.co/evEBhR4z3e

The closing vocal purge by admitted liar Cohen was recitation of talking pts from the DNC.  He sang song others wrote, but sang it out of tune. Get the gong!  A day Congress wasted smearing @realDonaldTrump hearing a man who only found his conscience after he got caught lying.
2nite I'll be on @TheStoryFNC w/ @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews at 7pm ET to lead the laughter at Cohen's incoherent comment that he lied, but isn't a liar. What else? I sing, but not a singer; I talk, but not a talker; I swim but not a swimmer. U got some to add?
One of my favorite members of Congress is @Jim_Jordan because he's fearless, smart, and fair.  If though it probably would be too large, I'll loan him a jacket any day he wants one! https://t.co/Q55qdfBHZ9
In coming hrs media will need oxygen hoses as they will be breathlessly lauding admitted/convicted liar Cohen for trying to hurt @realDonaldTrump and will speak of Cohen like he's Mother Teresa. There will be no objectivity or perspective &amp; the public is wise to the bias.
Michael Cohen pledging to tell truth is like W. C. Fields promising to be sober. Regardless of your politics, what Cohen is doing will forever damage the notion of attorney/client privilege. Cohen is a sad man, caught in lies and self-dealing, hoping to win favor w/ Trump haters.
So as @Jim_Jordan points out in this mockery of a hearing where the rat Cohen comes for his cheese, CNN was given the info before members of Congress.  THAT is COLLUSION. And it's why we call it FAKE NEWS.
An honest observation: @realDonaldTrump made a YUUUGE mistake in the Vietnam summit.  He should have made it a bi-partisan trip and taken Sen. Dick Blumenthal w/ him who has such a personal connection to Vietnam given his combat time there.  #StolenValor
I have a terrific show every weekend on @TBN Sat/Sun 8/11pm ET both nights and online and on-demand.  On all cable, satellite, many broadcast stations across globe! Details at https://t.co/MTf4xbnNsG  Originates in Nashville-hope you enjoy! https://t.co/BsoFymwAVB
Oops. Got canned and won't be on Hannity after all. I was triggered by this, but @FoxNews has provided me a "safe space" and I have Playdough, popsicles, a pony, a picture book, and a pretzel for my snack. I'll be ok.
I'll be on @seanhannity 9pmET and will challenge Sean about his riding scooter in Hanoi to get to his @FoxNews  show.  It was NOT due to traffic. @seanhannity has decided to go all AOC on the Green New Deal and become a vegan too. I'll call him out!

Bernie Sanders has no trouble calling President Trump an authoritarian, but still can’t bring himself to call Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro a “dictator,” even as he’s blocking humanitarian aid from getting to starving people. That my friend is today's Democrat party.

Cheaper option than $93 trillion "Green New Deal" is spend $10 trillion on "New Space Deal" and send all the "woke" climate change alarmists to Mars-no farting cows, cars or planes. AOC and Bernie could set up their socialist society &amp; live forever! Problem solved! UR welcome!
Wake up slackers! I'll be on @foxandfriends on @FoxNews at 7:30am ET-I'm like trying to like better like understand like AOC and like other like leftists who like think they are like really like smart but just like make like no like sense. I think you'll LIKE it.
If Dems want 2020 to be whether we should murder freshly born babies and forbid more children b/c of "climate change," then let the games begin! I still believe there are some sane Dems!
I'll be on @ShannonBream on @FoxNews at 11pmET but it's worth staying up to see as I'll reveal how Spike Lee got his purple outfit and little cap he wore at Oscars-it was really an LSU band uniform; he wasn't mad he lost-but because he had to give the uniform back by midnight.
If you want to make decisions based on socialist ideas then don’t reproduce. The rest of us wont do generational suicide based on UN climate models.  We’ll enjoy kids &amp; grandkids w/o added govt oppression &amp; trillions of $$ in debt that wont exist if socialists stop reproducing.

U can't make this up!  AOC &amp; other "progressives" say a women should control her body if she wants to kill a baby (that is a separate body, btw).  But if she wants to give BIRTH, the government should control.  God  help us! https://t.co/vpaliqIGfk

Know that @AlanDersh  is not a Trump fan nor @GOP but he knows the law and Constitution.

Let's be clear.  McCabe &amp; high officials at DOJ attempted what amounts to a coup d'etat against @realDonaldTrump so instead of book tour, McCabe &amp; co-conspirators should be doing a perp walk.  This is outrageous!  https://t.co/Mq127IU8pO
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” calls for replacing planes and cars with trains.  But an examination of her campaign expense report for the FEC found that she spent seven times as much on airfare as on Amtrak tickets, and there were 534 charges for car services.

In SOTU, @realDonaldTrump  blasted socialism to the faces of Bernie Sanders and his philosophical great-granddaughter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "We renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country!” Bernie looked like he’d just downed a mustard milkshake.
Breaking wind from CNN!  In light of revelations that Elizabeth Warren claimed to be "American Indian" for UofTexas Law School, she is dropping out of 2020 race.  In a gesture of friendship, @realDonaldTrump will appoint her to head Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Tonight, @POTUS played the statesman role.  Strong, clear, and tough.  @realDonaldTrump didn't just offer an olive branch, but the entire olive tree. Dems say they want infrastructure, fewer wars, better oppotunities for women--let's see if they really do.
NO @POTUS  EVER has been a stronger advocate for the life of ALL children--unborn and born.  I'm proud of @realDonaldTrump for fearlessly defending life.

I was wrong about “progressives.” I thought they only wanted to turn back clock to failed economic policies of 100 yrs ago. But with a typhus outbreak due to trash in CA piling up, their policies bring back the hygiene standards and medical problems of the 14th century.
Ironic if @realDonaldTrump  goes down in history as the 1st @POTUS able to make a deal with murderous North Korean communist dictator Kim Jong-Un ending NOKO nuclear threats, but Nancy Pelosi was too stubborn and leftwing to talk to him about protecting USA.

Happiest man in America?  Fmr S.C. Gov Mark Sanford who no longer holds record for weirdest news conference by an elected official.
Gov Northam seen gathering with his remaining supporters.  They are in booth 4 at Richmond Waffle House.  There’s room for a few more of you are nearby.
iTunes is reporting a huge uptick in sales of album "Thriller," as well as singles of "Billie Jean," and "Bad."
Poor Northam.  It'd be better if he just said he was on crack, worked as a male stripper, sold cocaine to undercover cops, and operated a Ponzi scheme to take savings accounts from old ladies, but "I'm not that person anymore.  I'm the soon to be FORMER Governor of VA."
Gov Northam has left VA for Egypt because he's swimming in "De-Nile."   I'm beginning to feel sorry for him.  Who advised him to go out there and say this stuff?
Ahh!  That explains why he moon-walked into the press conference today.  My advice to Northam is an old saying:  "When you're in a hole, quit digging."  He's digging. https://t.co/pqHB9yx57I

Nancy Pelosi now favors a wall....around Ralph Northam. https://t.co/g1B4e1gtOk
Ralph Northam's governorship is experiencing a post-election abortion, but after his fellow Dems set him aside, they will "make him comfortable" and "have a conversation" to decide how they will kill his political career.
Honest to God, is this the "choice" liberals like "racist Ralph" are fighting for?  Take 2 minutes &amp; watch.  Ask yourself if you think it's civilized and defensible.  https://t.co/J1o7K0cf9g
Fun, informative, entertaining, and nostalgic! 2nite on @TBN 8/11pmET! https://t.co/sjP7R9yiL4
Breaking wind from CNN! @eBay reports it can't keep up with truckloads of purchases of 30 year old class yearbooks from DC zip codes near US Capitol.
So that tweet by Kamala Harris didn't age well.  If VA doesn't stand for hatred and bigotry, I guess they'll be getting a new governor soon. https://t.co/y9lsB1ce1f

Breaking wind from CNN! CNN time machine has found the future moment in Dems 2020 debate when Cory Booker gets question in a very crowded room of Dem candidates.  https://t.co/Lz3vXviMOp
Tell Cory Booker if he’s really running for President because he wants a country “where parents can put food on the table; good-paying jobs w/ good benefits in every neighborhood,” then he doesn’t have to bother.  Trump is already doing that for him.	 	https://t.co/XiXvNSgKmr
Dems say @realDonaldTrump not qualified to be @POTUS but his polices sure work better than theirs. Do Americans really want Dems in @WhiteHouse &amp; higher taxes, more regulations, open borders, high unemployment, unstable world, and piles of dead babies?  https://t.co/6sonkDbgLQ
On @OutnumberedFNC at noon on @FoxNews but hope they can get me ready.  Been in hair and makeup since 9 am and they’ve brought in 2 more people to help.  It kind of hurts my tender feelings.
By popular demand, I'm centerpiece (not centerfold) on the couch on @OutnumberedFNC on @FoxNews at 12ET today. To be more empathetic, I'll wear spiked heels like they do and have the hairdressers tease and curl my hair. No lipstick, though!  A man has got to know his limitations!
Gov Northam of VA says full-term baby that survived a late-term abortion "would be kept comfortable" until mother and doctor decided to go ahead and kill baby anyway.  What's "comfortable" to the baby when it's  killed? Sick, savage, and sinful. Yes, elections have consequences! https://t.co/CjvamjzTON
I'm sending millions of robo calls 2nite to every phone in USA to tell them I'll be w/ @MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria on @FoxBusiness 6-9am ET Thur but she wants me to give outside weather rpts in 6 degree temps in NY and do it shirtless like Bob Menendez in Puerto Rico. #cold

Just tried to FaceTime Pelosi on my iPhone and ended up hearing all she was telling her minions about her plans to prank @realDonaldTrump SOTU speech next Tues; I'll tell ALL I heard 2nite on @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews at 10pmET.  Don't miss!
Why NY's shocking celebration of abortion is disturbing, disgusting, and dehumanizing.  And people who cheer it are duped into believing a lie pushed by the racist founder of Planned Barrenhood, Margaret Sanger, revered by the left. https://t.co/kD6Q8g5UHg
29 FBI agents in 17 SWAT vehicles banged on my door at 5:30am today and were holding automatic weapons on me. No, not to arrest me, but to make sure I'll be on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews w/ @SandraSmithFox and @BillHemmer at 9:30am ET so I may seem a bit nervous.
I’ll be on @ShannonBream on @FoxNews at 11pm ET but that’s really late so I will identify as a west coast resident so it will only be 8pm.  You can watch by identifying from Honolulu and it will just be 6pm.  Liberals believe that works so go for it!
CNN has been whining about not having WH briefings (and @realDonaldTrump says it's partly due to Showboating by Jimmy "the Wall" Acosta. Today, @PressSec is having one and guess who isn't even carrying it?  CNN.  It's why they earned the title "FAKE NEWS."
Some non-political news on Monday: Drug thief in FL is full of crap...no, come to think of it, he isn't!  He has finally "come clean!"  https://t.co/lFNcLWNdvS
Pelosi said @realDonaldTrump wasn’t invited to deliver SOTU because govt was shutdown.  It’s open so Mancy has sent the invitation, right?  Because surely Nancy wouldn’t lie.  THAT would be immoral.
74 yrs ago today Auschwitz was liberated.  1.1 million ppl murdered there-1 million of them Jews.  I’ve been there 3 times.  Life altering.  Sad how many deny it happened. I’d did but must never happen again.  #HolocaustRemembranceDay

I deleted tweet re CNN reporter at Roger Stone's house because name of reporter in tweet was wrong. My apology, but I DO believe it was leaked to CNN (remember Brazile and debate questions?) &amp; because I botched it, CNN offered me job b/c I'd fit in w/ CNN Fake News team, but NO!
Just after you watch my show on @TBN at 8ET I’ll be on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9pm. Think we’ll talk wall and shutdown?  Nope.  Topic is grass-St Augustine or Zoysia. Watch or at least “catch the clips!”
Since reckless Fake News has no integrity to clean itself up, it's wonderful to see ppl like @FLOTUS fighting back and suing the ever-living crap out of them...and WINNING!  It's only thing to stop these smears.    https://t.co/cONwmqXr9t

Nancy Pelosi has given @realDonaldTrump a gift-her stunning arrogant power play to treat the people's House as if it's her walled San Francisco mansion is a bridge too far.  We will call it the "Golden Grate Bridge" as it grates the nerves of all but most Trump-hating ppl.
Disgraceful!  Should have lit it up red for the blood of innocent babies killed by Planned Barren-hood and its founder Margaret Sanger, a rabid racist.  Never understood why anyone would want to honor her for targeting ppl of color for elimination.  #ChooseLife https://t.co/GnNTtsBwpA
Wonder if Fake News "Showboat Jim" Acosta knows that maybe reason @PressSec doesn't brief is that @realDonaldTrump is compassionate man and fears someone will get hurt getting between Acosta and a camera or mic. Gov't not only thing shut down-so is Showboat Jim! https://t.co/dMkmRzVECq

Get up early Monday!  I’ll be on @foxandfriends 6:15am ET and will recreate the pass interference no-call from Rams/Saints game on @kilmeade while @SteveDoocy and @ainsleyearhardt portray NFL refs by wearing blindfolds.
I just called 911 to report a felony theft.  NFL refs just stole the NFC Championship from the Saints.  Those refs might not want to wander around the French Quarter tonight.
Add another reason to distrust media: viral video seeming to show kids in MAGA hats taunting Vietnam Vet but unedited video reveals opposite. The kid publicy shamed should sue. Maybe he can own CNN when he wins.
If you missed “Huckabee”on @TBN Ladt nite watch 2nite 8/11pm ET https://t.co/ZQalBNwupW
Nancy Pelosi calling @realDonaldTrump compromise offer a non-starter before she even knew what was in it is like a 3 year old refusing to eat vegetables before even tasting. She could care less about govt workers or “Dreamers” and that’s a fact the “fact checkers” can check!
My apologies to my dear friend @JudgeJeanine but the @MediacomCable fiber line is down (AGAIN!) that connects to Fox.  Hopefully I can be with her next week. Be sure and watch her show 2nite as you can bet she will kick rear and take names!
We'll soon know if Pelosi, Chuck and the Dems really care about Dreamers and Gov't workers or not. @realDonaldTrump has offered MORE than they had even asked for.  If they say "no," they reveal it's not about shutdown, but showdown. It's time to either poop or get off the pot!
Don’t miss Ken Starr 2nite on Huckabee @TBN at 8pm ET and then I’ll be on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9pmET.  We will also be milking goats and making cheese.

I'm old enough to remember when Andrea was a journalist before she became a shill for the DNC.  And yes, I've been to both Kabul and Bagram and the "security risk" was greatly lessened when the CODEL didn't come. Hard to end "crisis" of shutdown when Speaker is gone 7 days. https://t.co/cE8ljjBDNy

My trip on an Air Force jet to hang out with Adam Schiff got canceled, so I'll be on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews w/ @BillHemmer and @SandraSmithFox  at 9am ET but I'll share the steak tartar, fine cheese, and filet of sole that was to be served on board w/ them.  Don't miss!

Dems think walls are immoral, but they love grandstands! The cost of shutdown passed the $5.7 billion that @realDonaldTrump  asked for in 1st place, so Dems can't say they’re blocking wall because it’s a waste of $$.  They’ve wasted more on shutdown than wall, &amp; rising every day.

I'm just fine w/ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing; I'm NOT fine w/ her tax proposals. JFK wouldn't be either.  There was a time when Dems weren't socialists. What happened to them?  https://t.co/N72CHdh4IA
Congrats to a great man and terrific firefighter who is married to a pretty cool lady! https://t.co/Y8zwd5dZNx
Internet noise that “conservatives are in tizz over AOC dancing in college” is fake news.  I’m not seeing that conservatives care.  Most acknowledge she was a joyful student and good for her! I just wish she would have that much joy about capitalism!
Disturbing.  Anti-Semitic "Palestinian"  Rashida Tlaib (there has NEVER been a nation called Palestine) erases Israel from map in her office &amp; on 1st day as Congresswoman screams obscenities about @realDonaldTrump Do Dems support this bigotry and hate?  https://t.co/AzapKAHquT
I'll be on @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness Fri at 10:30am ET unless the camera crew all calls in sick because Stu took them to a cheap and filthy slop-house in lower Manhattan and they get food poisoning. https://t.co/eVMatxDliQ
Mitt announces he’ll caucus with Dems, do a weekly column in NY Times and co-host with Rachel Maddow on BSNBC and announce a 3rd run for @POTUS for the Whig party.
About to be on @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness w/ @dagenmcdowell and crew because they needed a guest who would talk about Apple's sales slump in China, but speak in Mandarin so they would understand it in Beijing.
Hi, boys and girls.  I'll be on @FoxBusiness w/ @LizMacDonaldFOX at 6pm ET and will read some stories about Tony the Pony and Carla the Cow from my new Netfilx series "Stepping in a Barnyard Pile."  Mature Audiences recommended.
Great advance work from Elizabeth Warren's team.  She should just invite Brett Kavanaugh over to her kitchen for beer and forget the trip to Iowa. https://t.co/KFjb2JR83J
Couldn't agree more!  God bless @GOPChairwoman for rebuking "Uncle Mitt" for his self-serving pompous attack on @realDonaldTrump &amp; Mitt didn't even wait until swearing in before using Wash ComPost to trash @POTUS  and those who elected him. https://t.co/kUe5c6P6Kb
For those asking I use @Masterbuilt electric smoker, use apple wood chips and inject meat night before with my own recipe for marinade. Pork butt is very inexpensive but tastes expensive when done right.  Paid 1.79 lb. at local @Publix @realDonaldTrump should serve @WhiteHouse https://t.co/gSCZPiTFIK
12 hrs in my @Masterbuilt smoker using my special recipe.  Pulled pork so good no sauce needed! Booyah! https://t.co/OAeZyMjLsc

New Year's Day and not having to travel! Blackeyed peas simmering, just made a LARGE pot of venison chili (from deer I got in S. Texas) and my special recipe pork butt in the smoker (for 12 hrs). Eating peas and pork butt today-freezing chili for future. Good way to start 2019!

I'll be on @TheStoryFNC w/ @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews at 7pm ET but she's asked me not to wear bib overalls and a t-shirt since it's New Year's Eve.  I'll step it up a bit then.  Might even wear shoes.

News Busters compiled a list of the most hateful media assaults on conservatives.  It was a year of such over-the-top leftist hysteria that a columnist who compared the tax cut to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 barely made the top 10.	 https://t.co/K0Pa9CeIeC
"Fake News" CNN said airmen at Ramstein AFB in Germany maybe violated military regs against political activity by asking @realDonaldTrump  to sign MAGA caps.  Air Force: "no rule against airmen w/ personal items signed by @POTUS &amp; they did nothing wrong."	https://t.co/WQkP4LCKsJ
WHAT??? The “Trump official” who "resigned" in outrage over @realDonaldTrump  decision to withdraw troops from Syria was actually same Obama holdover who oversaw sending that planeload of cash to Iran and who was set to leave in February anyway…	 https://t.co/YnfZ58kg53

Bad news: NOT on @MariaBartiromo today; miscommunication &amp; on Thurs.  Good news:  WILL be on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 9am ET because they really felt bad about me getting up at 4am CT for Maria's show that was moved to Thurs so I'll go have some @OvaltineUSA and toast.
I'll be on @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria on @FoxBusiness at 7am ET Monday to give a year end review of best tick and flea remedies for humans of 2018 according to CDC.  Or I might talk about other junk. Watch and see.

Suggestion for @realDonaldTrump to end impasse w/ Chuckie and Nancy over wall: Tell Nancy that she won't get Air Force planes to/from home like last time she was Speaker until we get full funding for wall.  Deal should be made in about 15 minutes.
A Christmas gift that will create lifetime memories. Visit beautiful Scandinavian countries with me in the Baltic Seas on our our chartered ship! August 9-18.  Sign up today &amp; put notice of trip under the tree! https://t.co/9xNGivlLrw
To those who say "walls don't work," just realize that the "wall" between Democrats (who recently favored a wall and funding it) and @realDonaldTrump (who vowed to control border) is working so well it's closing 25% of federal gov't. Dems are making fools of themselves.
Great customer service makes you fiercely loyal to a company. In the midst of the hassles of Christmas travel, an @Delta rep named Ashley was our family's Christmas angel, going above and beyond. She could teach the corporate world how to earn customer loyalty! #Grateful

Memo to Congress members:  Don't pack all your underwear to go home just yet. Get the people's "bit-ness" done first.  Give us and THEN yourself a Christmas!
Just saw my Congressman @mattgaetz brilliantly explain why he's standing w/ @realDonaldTrump to not sign CR w/o border security. Glad that some aren't going to get rolled like a burrito and smoked like a fajita by Chuck and Nancy!
A word from @ReaganWorld  who saw his father keep HIS end of the deal and the Dems betraying the deal.  @realDonaldTrump is doing the right thing by holding firm and not getting sucker-punched. #standfirm https://t.co/9Q1Hza2MDk
While no one loves gov't shutdown, @realDonaldTrump is right to make clear to both Dems and the nervous Nellies in GOP:  "I'll give you DACA; but America gets wall."  This shouldn't be hard.  It's what BOTH sides have voted for.  Just. Do. It.
About right.  World's most celebrated Fake News journalist who just made crap up out of thin air, was CNN's Journalist of the Year.  Karma!  https://t.co/zGvA0ZiZVT
Despite warnings and pushback from Nancy Pelosi, @Varneyco will have me on @FoxBusiness at 10:45am ET today because Stu likes my British accent and my Christmas decorating skills.
Will be on @foxandfriends on @FoxNews at 7am ET and if I get to choose, I'll talk about danger of abandoning Kurds and Christians in Syria, imperative of funding wall &amp; defunding Planned Parenthood, &amp; why GOP in Congress failed in their last hrs.
I want troops home too, but leaving Syria abruptly is betrayal to Kurds who have sacrificed and shed blood for Americans and it leaves Syrian Christians as sitting ducks. Please @realDonaldTrump re-think this!  Your friends and supporters hope you reconsider.
Will be on @marthamaccallum on @FoxNews on @TheStoryFNC 7pm ET because I'm smart enough, I'm good enough, and doggone it, people like me! (Not everyone, of course, but the people who don't like me have single digit IQ and bad body odor.)
But Congress will adjourn soon without funding the wall or defunding Planned Barrenhood.  And then just the other rodents will remain. https://t.co/hkEACXbZkU

It took a British court to reveal it, but more shocking evidence of the REAL "Russian collusion" and it wasn't about @realDonaldTrump but guys like St. Comey, the self-righteous liar/leaker.  Corruption, Collusion, and Crime! https://t.co/EEO0lGCbZX
AOC needs a break!  Whew!  Job hasn't started yet, but getting a jump on the vacation.  Tell her it's all good, and new term in Congress has been delayed until January of 2020, so take a longer break and get some rest.  https://t.co/vGzV2jxp6F
And "Planned Barrenhood" thinks it's okay to kill this baby for money.  Please @realDonaldTrump while we're sealing the border, stop the genocide and defund Planned Parenthood.  These babies deserve to live. https://t.co/eAldJaI9hx
In the case of Les Moonves, slime doesn't pay! $120 MILLION--hope it was worth it, Les.  Now, CBS, how about taking that $120 million and giving it to your employees as a Christmas bonus?       https://t.co/VLh8ZdKqkj
Hoping @realDonaldTrump holds fast on border security even if gov't shutdown; SS, Medicare, military all funded so Dems can't scare Granny this time. As Maggie Thatcher once said to another @POTUS "Don't go wobbly!"
Good news: bi-partisan First Step prison and sentencing bill up for Senate vote.  Bad news: Sens Cotton and Kennedy stubbornly won’t support.  Makes no sense as this is opportunity to actually pass good legislation.  Every police group in US supports. Why won’t they?

Just got a call from a frantic @MariaBartiromo and she needs me on her @MorningsMaria on @FoxBusiness at 7am ET to play the Christmas version of "Dueling Banjos" with her. I'll do the guitar part. You should watch!

Michael Cohen who did work for @realDonaldTrump switched his party from GOP to Dem after pleading guilty to felonies not related to @POTUS . So now that he's an admitted felon, he feels more at home w/ the Dems?  Sounds about right.

Breaking wind from CNN!  https://t.co/2robSqR5YJ has obtained exclusive video from Jim Comey's closed door testimony to Congress.  https://t.co/p1UrwokPkD
Clinton arena tour is like “This Is Spinal Tap II,” with empty seats &amp; $7 tickets. Promoters selling 1/2 price tickets on Groupon, where U get deals on stuff like massages &amp; pretzels “Come see Bill and Hill massage the truth and twist it like a pretzel!” https://t.co/qLwB8yFSSN
Behind closed doors, Jim Comey answered questions with “I don’t know” 166 times, “I don’t remember” 71 times, and “I don’t recall” 8 times.  He's either lying or in early stages of dementia! Not a very credible witness-just another political hack.
I'm on @foxandfriends again Mon 7:30am ET on @FoxNews &amp; I thought it was b/cause I was so smart Sunday.  But I overheard producer say, "Aw, give him one more chance!"  I'll wear my Santa suit.  Who doesn't like Santa?
Because my appearance on @foxandfriends at 7:30am ET on @FoxNews Sunday is expected to be so powerful, banks and the Post Office will be closed during my talk.  Oh, wait...it's Sunday-they will be closed anyway. It will still be worth watching.
Powerful story from veteran @victormarx 2nite on @HuckabeeOnTBN 8/11pm ET and how to re-build life from @OSHawkins and watching the show is like Frosted Flakes--They're Grrrrrreat! https://t.co/GL0uvM1VSD

After a nite in @AppleSupport hospital in NY and 10 hrs of reloading my data, my laptop is off life support and working again. My thanks to Genius Bar staff who have my respect and thanks. They did confirm that Russians messed it up.

I’ll be on @foxandfriends at 7amET on @FoxNews and @realDonaldTrump will be watching me promote my new book which you should buy as Christmas gifts. I think the recipients will be glad but I know  I will so order today!  If you are a Dem you can order the audio version. https://t.co/NAMxHgOJHY

I'll be guest hosting for my friend @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews 2nite at 10pm ET.  She wanted me to explain how to carve a turkey with nothing but my bare hands and some tweezers. I might get in some current events too.
Finally!  Nelson finally concedes to my next Senator @FLGovScott who will be great.  Nelson’s adios was a bitter blame game and he ends his insufferably long ride on the taxpayer’s dime without dignity or statesmanship.
Once again near top of ratings for social media engagement for TV personalities.  Not bad for a guy with a weekly show on @TBN  beating out all these ppl who are on major networks doing a daily show!  https://t.co/sFU2o7QWee
Do ppl realize how obnoxious they are talking loudly on their phones while in public restrooms--on SPEAKER phone for gosh sake! C'mon Dems and GOP! This is something we surely can agree on-let's FLUSH their phones! For America.  For decency! https://t.co/Fa9R5coNGG
If you love music, you LOVE @billydean who is one of the most talented and absolutely terrific people in the music business.  I love his music. I just love him!  Fun having him w/ me on @TBN tonight-watch Sunday 8/11pm ET too.  https://t.co/31n5OiXpNH
Is Jim Acosta from CNN a "real" journalist or political advocate and voice of fake news? Watch from my show @TBN this weekend and let me know your thoughts.  https://t.co/crFpNXhOTF
Kudos to Andrew Gillum for graciously conceding to Ron DeSantis today.  He should call Stacey Abrams in GA and explain how to do that.  Her bitter angry screed showed she would have done GA no favors.
Very powerful reflections from @SteveScalise and Will Graham and music from the terrific @billydean 2nite on my show @TBN 8/11pm ET. Will make you forget FL recounts! https://t.co/WtqDhDPMK8
Here’s a guy who isn’t real smart  as I haven’t traveled at taxpayer expense since I left office in Jan of 2007. But thanks for following me on Twitter and proving it’s a brain free zone! https://t.co/2Lu8XuHcMx
Up at 330. Leave hotel 430 and to airport for another early flight. This week has been WV to VA to TN to CA to FL to DC to TX and hopefully home tomorrow &amp; leave again Monday.  Travel is glamorous!  But I live in greatest nation on earth where I can travel freely. #Thankful
My pal @JohnMcLemore from @Masterbuilt cookers joins me to “talk turkey” 2nite on @TBN 8/11pm ET 7/10 CT.  The https://t.co/h64zlKjG3C cast is joined by Friends Billy Dean and Larry Gatllin to chow down.  Great tips on preparing Thanksgiving dinner! https://t.co/CNyexvg36V
Thanks to @seanhannity and his great team for letting me guest host 2nite. Hope you saw the intvu w/ @PressSec as she broke news as to @WhiteHouse and @realDonaldTrump letter to CNN.
Dinner @seanhannity supposed to have w/ Acosta may get canceled since Acosta insisted he be only one allowed to have a fork and only one allowed to talk. https://t.co/cHZVddXBfS
I’ll be guest hosting for @seanhannity 2nite on @FoxNews at 9pm ET b/c Sean will be having dinner with Jim Acosta, Maxine Waters and Michael Avenatti. I’ll show exclusive video of dinner so you better watch!  Epic!
What would federal judge do if Acosta "challenged" him in his courtroom and argued and wouldn't shut up when judge told him to and refused to give up mic when bailiff tried to retrieve it? Asking for a friend.  And for half of America.
Breaking wind from CNN! Jim Acosta, who grabbed Halloween candy from another child's bag now asks a fed judge to force the homeowner to let him keep all the candy.  Homeowner says "screw it" and will no longer give ANYONE candy.
A fed judge wants to be Com Director at WH and decide who gets in.  There are thousands of REAL journalists in USA-I hope everyone of them sues for the RIGHT to sit in that room.  Let the fed judge figure that one out.
Hope you'll get my just released new book, "Rare, Medium, or Done Well."  It's about making the most of your life and does NOT contain Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's recipe for mac/cheese or her recipe for making ice.  https://t.co/8aihUGM1Zj
Been traveling from CA to South FL all day to deliver some newly discovered votes but found out Roy Clark died.  Great man and virtuoso musician. Was on my tv show once. I was in awe. Still am. He was one of a kind.  God bless his memory.
My philosophy on use of Twitter captured by @AaronNolanNews from @KARK4News Little Rock when he visited me on set of my @TBN show in Nashvillle. https://t.co/IpuWNi4QM0
Don't know if creepy Michael Avenatti is guilty of beating a woman as charged, but he has screamed a lot that we should always "believe the woman."  Okay, Michael, if you insist.  https://t.co/wV4WMQH3gV
FL Election offical Brenda Snipes:“I think I have served the purpose that I came here for" &amp; I think of Stan Laurel,  helping Oliver clean a house &amp; now holding a garden hose on the smoldering ashes of all that remain, saying “Well…I guess there’s nothing else I can do.”
Latest from @KARK4News and reporter @AaronNolanNews on behind the scenes from the @TBN show.  https://t.co/Y1edG5xYdr

Broward Co Election official Brenda Snipes continues the vote count. https://t.co/Y7vEjH3aIs
My advice to @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec is to invite reporters from around the country to come to @WhiteHouse to cover events. Why should WHCA decide who covers @POTUS ? Open things up to rotating local papers and broadcasters-let them ask questions. That's REAL free press!
Watch @AaronNolanNews from @KARK4News in Little Rock and more of his visit w/ me @TBN in Nashville on set of my show. https://t.co/qtdgngl2Bb
About to launch the FB Live webcast!  Join NOW!	https://t.co/CJmxY65x3m
CNN sues @WhiteHouse so their rude selfish showboating reporter can get out of “time out” for his disrespectful treatment of intern and screaming at  @realDonaldTrump   If he has a “right” to be at WH then why can’t ANY reporter from any news source demand to be in press room?
He’s a brilliant author and wise book critic! https://t.co/ZKZAAtmGB3
Folks, the good and wise @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness will have me on at 10am et today to read passages from my new book  “Rare, Medium, or Well Done” that releases today for about 2 hrs.  I might talk lesser things too.
I'm on @foxandfriends on @FoxNews 6:30am ET Tues; Imagine a book endorsed by @VanJones68 and @FRCdc leader @tperkins and you have my non-political book I'll discuss w/ @SteveDoocy   https://t.co/8aihUH3CQR
Join me Tues morning at 11 ET/10 CT for a Facebook live booksigning.  Will be fun and you can chat with me in real time. All the cool people will be joining in.  https://t.co/CJmxY65x3m
Are you ready for "potato salad time?"  If your best friends summed up your life what would they say?  My new book "Rare, Medium, or Done Well" is out tomorrow.  Great Christmas gift for family, friends, employees, or yourself.  https://t.co/8aihUGM1Zj
Just heartbreaking to see the devastation and imagine the terror of being in path of fire.  An unsung hero is @RealJamesWoods who has tirelessly sought to connect missing people.  Impressive humanitarian efforts. https://t.co/mxai1ENhMg
More Breaking Wind from CNN!  Russia now says it will hire Broward Co Elections Supervisor as consultant since she's better at mucking up elections than they ever dreamed of being!  https://t.co/Vkyzr1FAsj
Breaking wind from CNN!  Paper shortage reported in FL as Broward Co has bought up all available paper to print more ballots to stuff into secret boxes for Democrat candidates.
Recently @AaronNolanNews from @KARK4News Little Rock came to Nashville to the set of my TV show and I explained how I use Twitter for the fun of it.  Watch! https://t.co/sXSazB0Dw6
My Dad was a firefighter.  Watching the exhausted and heroic firefighters in CA go up against the apocalyptic wildfires make me proud of my Dad's service. Selfless sacrifice on their part to save people and property. God bless them!
Thanks, @ErinGaetz  for reminding us that @GOP women are strong leaders that the left won't respect because these ladies think for themselves!  I'll add @PressSec in there.  I know her. #GOPWOMENROCK https://t.co/YQgw01CiaX
His last words were “hey, y’all hold my beer and watch dis!”  I swear I know this guy! https://t.co/iXEHmgP1Nv
Mech problem w/ plane last nite; 2 hr @Uber ride at 11pm to Roanoke to get flight today; 4am fire alarm @HamptonByHilton forces us outside in 26 degrees; I bet I'll be next to shower curtain ring salesman from Chicago who picks bare feet on flight today! #planestrainsautomobiles
Thank you veterans for my liberty!  God bless you on this day and everyday.  #VeteransDay2018
This is the way things should be done.  Use a sense of humor and civility to deal w/ offenses.  Way better than mob violence and screaming at people in public places. Congats @DanCrenshawTX and Pete Davidson. https://t.co/8YQy0sQs8m
Don't miss @HuckabeeOnTBN 2nite at 8/11pm ET; 7/10 CT as my friend @GeraldoRivera joins me to open a vault containing thousands of "just discovered" Democrat ballots in Broward Co FL. Jesus multiplied fish/loaves.  FL Dems multiply ballots! It's an election MIRACLE!
Nice story by @AaronNolanNews of @KARK4News about my show on @TBN   https://t.co/Y1edG5gnlT
Heroes. What is a REAL hero? 2nite on https://t.co/HEb0ei4okJ on "Huckabee" 8/11pm ET, meet some heroes and some folks who honor them.  Special Veterans Day tribute. Powerful song by Tim Atwood, 38 years w/ Grand Ol' Opry, is a closing tribute not to be missed. https://t.co/WT1EU2vIXG
This Sat/Sun @HuckabeeOnTBN honors veterans including this 95 yr old Iwo Jima Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient.  These guys were made of special stuff! https://t.co/Ijuzck7qYX
I'm guest hosting for my friend @IngrahamAngle tonight on @FoxNews at 10pm ET, but they want me to wear a blonde wig and a necklace so no one will notice.  Not sure I agree.  I think folks will notice.
Put on your calendar for next Tues--my new book "Rare, Medium, or Done Well" releases that day and there's a FB live booksigning.  You need a non-political book and this is it!  https://t.co/CJmxY65x3m
A treasure chest of wisdom and insight.  Newsrooms across America stop and watch in awe! https://t.co/cnrl6IXxXH
Watch the video in real time from CSPAN.  Or read this from  @BuzzFeed --hardly friendly to @realDonaldTrump or @PressSec and get "the rest of the story.  https://t.co/P8L8COSKCe https://t.co/wVSLP9kNMm
Will be on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 9am ET if my transmission lines from @MediacomCable work. Despite promises that lines "work" they are abt as reliable as Broward Co FL election officials. Fingers crossed!
Had to do phoner w/ @TrishIntel on @FoxBusiness &amp; won't be able to do @seanhannity because the @MediacomCable fiber line from my studio is kaput.  I think it's engineered by Russians! Thanks to @seanhannity and @FoxBusiness for doing all possible. Sorry I let them down!
Breaking wind from CNN-just released video of Dems not accepting election results and finding votes in FL, GA, and AZ so they can overturn election.  Watch but be advised it's adult content!  https://t.co/0h43ZwybTk
Freudian slip? Just saw AP reporter on @FoxNews w/ @BretBaier saying about confrontation @WhiteHouse "right and left were tense."  What??? Right and LEFT? I thought the press was neither?  Just professional journalists? America knows you take a side. Just admit it.
Thank God!  This should be CRIMINAL investigation. These thugs aren't protestors, they are terrorists trying to scare ppl into changing their views or actions. Long jail time is appropriate and at least keeps them away from civilized people's homes. https://t.co/ZEQ8JHHcQ1
Will be on @TrishIntel on @FoxBusiness 2nite at 8pmET and @seanhannity at 9pmET on @FoxNews and will demonstrate how to take a mic from “Showboat” Jim Acosta of CNN the Crybaby News Network. (Spoiler-it involves karate!)
Does @washingtonpost condone the "however" of this unhinged rant toward @PressSec hoping that terrorist loons who attacked @TuckerCarlson will do this to her &amp; her family? What kind of sick person thinks that's okay? Will responsible journalists condemn this craziness? Waiting. https://t.co/u7iYF7SQ8Y
This guy sacrificed his life to protect others.  His name is the ONLY name we need to hear.  Keep the shooter's name out--don't make him famous.  Make the shooter a non-person; make this police office a household hero. https://t.co/OG2AdPCGgM
This makes sense.  Why the heck not?  Imagine it and be it.  I'm actually a 30 year old with 6-pack abs and have 175 IQ and a part-time nuclear scientist and pilot rocket ships. Booyah! https://t.co/HGJJdekdFw
I'll be on @Varneyco today at 10:45 on @FoxBusiness and will demonstrate my perfect British accent for Stu that I learned in southern Alabama where everyone talks in a British accent.
If you don't read https://t.co/VahrZOhB5O here's a great reason you should!  Jay Richards is a regular there.  Great analysis.  Read unless your mind is small and closed. https://t.co/gfofF71IDQ
Proof that not everyone in Hollywood is crazy. There are numerous sane, rational, intelligent people there.  Great example right here! https://t.co/glYye5XDAl
To members of the media or Dem Party (but I repeat myself) still lamely defending "Showboat Jim" read Michael Goodwin's column for a more mature perspective. https://t.co/gvYTcD0czU
God bless @trish_regan for having the guts to call out a bully instead of trying to excuse his reprehensible behavior toward a young @WhiteHouse  female intern like some in the press are trying to do. https://t.co/Y4TZXbPfDA
Situational Ethics 101: Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who will take over the House Judiciary Committee (I tried to warn you) is now demanding an investigation of Jeff Sessions’ resignation. And what was he demanding last year? Jeff Sessions’ resignation.	https://t.co/9lGPpQh4F9
About to be on @FoxBusiness to announce that I will NOT accept AG job. Not that I was offered it, but I'll decline. I may even cry on camera for dramatic effect!
Watch the same Dems who voted AGAINST Jeff Sessions for AG and said he wasn't qualified or was a "racist," (and all other crap Dems say when they don't have an issue) now go nuts DEFENDING  Sessions.  These guys have no shame.
If Acosta was a GOP candidate/official and the  lady was a reporter, the media would scream that he assaulted her. Did Acosta bring his own mic or doesn't that belong to @WhiteHouse ?  CNN, the CLASSLESS News Network. https://t.co/tZdIhZbF09
What to make of the 2018 elections: Once again, President Trump has been proven correct: just two years into his first term, America has been doing so much winning that a lot of voters must really be tired of winning. https://t.co/4gCHhcwThv https://t.co/OWFl26LjqI
America watches a very rude press interrupt and argue with @POTUS and they keep digging their grave with their pens and their bare sharp teeth.  What they aren’t used to is that @realDonaldTrump fights back and doesn’t let them act like petulant brats.
Did Joy take civics in high school?  This is sad but funny reveal of THE VIEW from the shallow end of their pool. https://t.co/OdoDzxtX4z
This is hilarious and revealing—stunning bias of a paper that never said this when a Dem barely won.  Try this : “The Register should recognize that most Iowans don’t subscribe to their paper. “ https://t.co/T7qDRl87D6
Once again we did learn that most “experts” in polling and punditry really don’t have a clue what they are talking about. The gas bags are out of gas! https://t.co/VTMSu9tRUG
Out of state liberals spent $70million on Beto and all they got was a skateboard. Cruz "skated" on thin ice but still won. Beto is reportedly eating a bar of soap for bfst after his outburst on nat'l TV.  https://t.co/JzosrTYLB5
This morning, Mitch McConnell and the GOP Senators need to go over to the @WhiteHouse and thank @realDonaldTrump as w/o him, Schumer would be moving into Leader's office. America thanks you, @POTUS !
2 takeaways so far are that there is NO "blue wave" other than to wave bye to some incumbent Dem Senators who opposed all @realDonaldTrump tried to do; and w/o @realDonaldTrump tireless efforts, it might have BEEN a blue wave!
I hope my candidates win, but if not, I'll still cherish my right to vote. I won't scream at ppl in restaurants, scratch on doors of SCOTUS, urge ppl to blow up gov't bldgs, threaten to leave country, or cry like a 5 year old. I'll just work harder next time. What about you?
Here's something we could all use, especially today: an example of real class and maturity...https://t.co/uT9h8cED6D https://t.co/ELE114jQKh
Today is an unusual election because, generally, voters prefer to vote for something rather than just against.  But pollsters claim the Democrats are fired up to vote, and “against” is all that their Party is running on. Read more: https://t.co/J5vFe7ERGI https://t.co/hL2u4VmZOi
If you are reading this, then I assume you’ve already voted to keep Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer and the rest of the Democrats’ sideshow carnival crew far, far away from America’s steering wheel.  If you haven’t yet voted....https://t.co/oS2qtfhs1C https://t.co/6ANf9t58re
To their credit, The Huron Daily Tribune fired the hack who made the disgusting statements about MI Senate candidate John James.  Good for them!  https://t.co/8INqaEBCJk
The press (as a whole) aren't "enemy of the people" but is this kind of reporter a "friend of the people?" Being this hateful and biased is not journalism.  It's political advocacy.  Hey press, police your own profession or don't expect respect.  https://t.co/Cwu4EdqyuA
If FL voter-vote FOR Amendment 13 while you’re voting to send @FLGovScott to Senate and @RonDeSantisFL to Capitol.
Economy under @realDonaldTrump is on fire. Jobs for blacks, Hispanics, women at historic levels. GDP doubled since Dems ran things. USA strong again. Today, vote w/ your brain. If you r thinking abt voting for Dems, news flash!  Election postponed until NEXT Tuesday.
OK boys and girls-I'll be on w/ Aunt @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness Tues morning at 8am ET to explain why the "blue wave" will be waving bye bye and leaving Dems signing the blues. #JobsNotMobs
I hope you saw but here’s another chance.  Share with your friends.  If you don’t have any friends then watch it twice and pretend you showed it to your friend. https://t.co/JDfYM8liGZ
Hoping FL voters give Senator “Rip Van Nelson” a permanent political nap and send @FLGovScott who’s been a great Governor to go to DC and WORK!
Will be on w/ @marthamaccallum on @TheStoryFNC at 7pm ET on @FoxNews  and will resist all attempts by Martha to break me down and have me confess to whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa.  I only know he's supposed to vote in FL tomorrow.
Gosh! I early voted and then absentee voted and now will vote at precinct tomorrow.  3 strikes and they’re out!  I vote “the Chicago Way!” https://t.co/DWRStxCqn2

NC 9th voters hopefully are disgusted by sleazy attack from desperate Dem McCready on @MarkHarrisNC9 and his Christian faith. Voters need to strongly reject religious bigotry and distortion of Biblical faith pushed by McCready. Vote @MarkHarrisNC9 for common decency!

Just landed in Denver, the Mile High City, on a very pleasant @united flight.  Some nice people did offer me some brownies.  I started feeling lethargic, needing to sleep &amp; not wanting to do anything productive. You know, I’m feeling like a Democrat on Election Day.
URGENT!  Just got off phone with Santa Claus calling from North Pole and he said anyone who votes for a Democrat will get a lump of coal in his/her stocking. He said there is a reason his suit is red. https://t.co/IGfhlwW8Dm
No @POTUS from either party has come close to working so hard for his party’s candidates than @realDonaldTrump so if GOP has good results give him credit. I wish even whiny never Trumpers would acknowledge that.
This is perfect message to FL voters and compelling reason to vote for @RonDeSantisFL and @FLGovScott so I will say “I love ‘Mokey Bear!” https://t.co/kRb0JAbvl1

Thanks, Jane.

As a FL resident and voter, I ask why would Steyer, Bloomberg and Soros give far left Gov candidate Gillum so many millions? Raise taxes, ban guns, kill jobs, wreck a great economy? Vote @RonDeSantisFL and @FLGovScott for Senate.
I'll be on @foxandfriends Sat at 8:30am ET on @FoxNews and will be sharing recipes from my new cookbook "Easy Meals for the Resistance."  Tomorrow, I'll be sharing my recipe for boiled water.

Why do some people believe that anchor babies have constitutional rights but pre-born babies can be chopped into little pieces? Shouldn't ALL persons in America be protected by 5th and 14th amendments? #votelife
Great news America! I'll be on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 10:30am ET &amp; @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 10:45am ET &amp; will demonstrate how to dodge eggs, tomatoes and shoes thrown by mobs of loving, tolerant Dems when you go vote.
Early voted  today for @RonDeSantisFL and @FLGovScott in FL. I plan to vote for them again tomorrow and again Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, and of course Tue because this election is crucial! Vote early and vote often!
To Streisand, Michael Moore,Rosie and others threatening to move to Canada if GOP keeps House-I got you covered!  Take warm clothes as it gets cold there! https://t.co/zwzMTUKKVL
Barbra Streisand blames @realDonaldTrump for being fat, stuffing herself w/ pancakes &amp; will move to Canada if Dems don’t win House. How many  celebrities promised move to Canada if Trump won in 2016?  Tell them abt Tim Horton donuts and poutine up there! https://t.co/qa1Pw8Biha
CNN's Don Lemon: “I don’t see Democrats killing people over politics.” Trump hater Max Boot added, “Nobody on the Democratic side is encouraging violence like @realDonaldTrump ” @SteveScalise might differ! CNN-the  “Concussion News Network,” as hosts suffer from memory loss.
As someone who was on the debate stage in 2 cycles I agree abt @MariaBartiromo and frankly the entire  @FoxBusiness anchors vs anyone else.  They balanced the time, asked substantive questions and avoided silly gotcha questions. https://t.co/hw8pR4iEdw

In Milwaukee last night for Teen Challenge event hosted by @ScottWalker and FL Tonnette Walker.  He’s 1 of America’s best Governors and she’s 1 classy lady!  A week from reelection but they invested  time for young lives shattered by addiction.  I almost bid on this but didn’t. https://t.co/ewVjWzSESM
Never forget-the 1st nurse and doctor who treated the synagogue shooter were Jewish. He was still screaming "Kill all the Jews!" as Jews were unselfishly &amp; successfully saving his very life.  It's why Jews survived and Hitler didn't.  Light defeats darkness.
Reason @PressSec said it is because it's true. I long for the day when I can't figure out who the media is rooting for. Real journalists wear striped shirts; today's media wear team jerseys-90% with a donkey logo. https://t.co/jZ7fRAL1fD
In Milwaukee to speak to a great group from @teenchallengewi that helps people overcome addiction to drugs/alcohol and be addicted to life and love. Great to be in state led by great Governor @ScottWalker who deserves reelection!

Dear friends in Alaska GOP: Do you think you could send a REPUBLICAN Senator to DC? The one you sent named Lisa is a reliable vote for Schumer, Feinstein and the "resistance" and we could sure use one who wants to save our Constitutional Republic.
Breaking wind from CNN! DC Fire Department rushing to Capitol Hill and to Senate floor because Chuck Schumer's pants are reportedly on fire!
Here’s how NOT to instill confidence that you’re competent at your job as a Senator: 1. Demand FBI investigation of allegation w/ no evidence.  2. Slam the investigation that you demanded as being “incomplete.”  3. Admit you haven’t actually finished reading the FBI report yet.

Dems are exposed as having no real concern for women, truth, the Constitution or accepting election results. By changing what they demand each day, they are like whining toddlers always wanting something else. They have lost any credibility if they ever had any.

The Kavanaugh hearings and the case for mistaken identity.  Read it here: https://t.co/N43GehNOi5 https://t.co/Ya45E0G2lA
What on earth are liberals talking about when they say "MY truth" or "HER truth," or "HIS truth?" Truth is NOT like a customized latte order at Starbucks. Something is true or not. Truth is objectively true and it's veracity is not determined by WHO said it, but WHAT was said.
Hearing Blumenthal (Sgt. "Stolen Valor" who lied about being in Vietnam) talk about "truth" is like having Jeffrey Dahmer talk about table manners. Blumenthal is beyond shameless.
These comments by @LindseyGrahamSC will be forever remembered as a seminal moment that defined what Democrats really care about. And if ANY GOP Senator votes "no" they have crapped on the Constitution and should slither home in disgrace. https://t.co/4CQ0llfiVu
Finally makes sense why Dems demand FBI "investigate" Kavanaugh; same FBI that colluded w/ GPS, leaked to media, and tried to "insure" against @realDonaldTrump election and overthrow it after he won. Heck, let's bring Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, McCabe back to do it!

In my commentary involving Victoria Toensing’s observation that her client, Uranium One whistleblower Doug Campbell, hadn’t yet been interviewed by either U.S. Attorney John Huber or special counsel Robert Mueller, I promised to come back with more details https://t.co/saLkeEyZWz https://t.co/1Zmy6n5SMN
I now realize the Senate hearing are NOT about SCOTUS at all.  It's tryouts for the role of Foghorn Leghorn in the remake of the cartoon series.
Too bad it isn't a toll free number, but call the NY Slimes and ask them. https://t.co/D1DGmvqdTg
Breaking wind from CNN!  Sen Cory Booker has been offered shoe deal by Nike after  his pompous grandstanding in Senate hearing.
Too bad Booker and other Dems aren’t so interested in releasing DOJ and FBI docs showing what a conspiracy and coverup they’ve done to undermine @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ORxT90Qo6o
Dept of Ag delivered a large truck of Govt cheese to White House to catch the little rat the Crazy Old Gray Lady turned into a pet.
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for helping him get work. https://t.co/Jnu8IrVcfX
To my friends across the aisle, after watching Kavanaugh hearings, I say this with love and concern:  The embarrassing charade/parade at the hearings should be your wake-up call.  Find a 12-step program now.	https://t.co/8QJNwn69sQ
If the cowardly weasel who hides beneath the skirt of the Gray Lady wants to help country then get on ballot and run! A person who will take a paycheck but not the heat of standing up publicly is no hero but a selfish unelected traitor.
I'll be on @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews 2nite at 10pm ET and will reveal that the "anonymous" Admin "official" is a gutless coward. If NY Slimes or the "official" believes  this, stand up and be accountable. Stuff like this is why ppl don't trust media.
Kavanaugh and Merrick Garland supported each other's decisions over 90% of the time.  Yet the Dems claim Garland was a brilliant choice for SCOTUS, and Kavanaugh is a sexist, racist monster.  Makes you wonder if Dems are lying about other things as well.
About to be on 2/ @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness where I'll release the docs Dems on Kavanaugh hearings say they want.  They won't read them, though.  They will only try to color them, and then play with them w/ paste and glue.
My thoughts about the new Woodward book: https://t.co/keRHt18ZPO https://t.co/Lb8TPVGzFp
Perhaps one problem with Attorney General Jeff Sessions is that he’s just too darn nice.  I’ve said that although it breaks my heart to acknowledge this, as Sessions is a friend of mine, he really does need to go. Read more: https://t.co/c8RryzpshP https://t.co/pYratzvfmw
Was going to take a look at Woodward's latest novel, but when I picked it up it was dripping wet from the tongue licking it had gotten from CNN and NBC talking heads.  Can't risk contracting something from those bodily fluids!
I hear a lot of people complain that politics have ruined theater. Well, after the opening of the Kavanaugh SCOTUS hearings, I think we can agree that the obverse is true as well: theater is ruining politics. My thoughts about yesterday's show: https://t.co/MSxVnlQS6I https://t.co/itk24Hus1r
Dems lecture us “think of the children” but Judge Kavanaugh’s 2 young daughters who came to see how the Senate works watched their Dad bullied &amp; were hustled out for their own safety after learning when Dems don’t get what they want, the Senate works like “Lord of the Flies.”
Dems pulled 44 childish stunts to interrupt the 1st hr of SCOTUS hearings alone, and 63 in the 1st segment-all choreographed theater, planned by the Bob Fosse of bull droppings, Chuck Schumer, and the other Democrats during a conf call over the Labor Day weekend. #shameful
Smart folks, those folks @DailyCaller for publishing my article about why YOU can't afford to let Dems get control of Congress...or your health care!  https://t.co/QRnahhXgYJ
Finally there is clarity and real exposure of the shameless hypocrisy of the Dems and their disingenuous smear of Judge Kavanaugh when @LindseyGrahamSC sends it into the 3rd deck. The Dems need to go take a shower and clean the BS off their clothes.
Very disappointed in Sen. Blumenthal's bloviating.  I was expecting the CT Senator to discuss his combat experience in Vietnam.  PANTS ON FIRE!
https://t.co/Mrmh0PCtO9
Capitol Police just released name of female protester at Judicial hearing. It was Hillary Clinton, who repeatedly shouted "It was supposed to be MY pick!  The FBI and DOJ told me it would be mine!"
Spent a lot of time in Iowa and got to know @ChuckGrassley and reminded again today of why I believe he's one of the few statesmen in politics today.  Good man; great wife.  Honorable fits him well.
Serious injuries reported in the Senate hearing room as someone got between Kamala Harris and a TV camera.  Never do that! The hapless person in her camera shot had his eyes scratched out and suffered severe bites.
We got an ugly reminder of the crassness of Trump’s critics and the political world in general last week, when funerals for Sen. John McCain and Aretha Franklin were marred by anti-Trump political slams during what were supposed to be eulogies...read more: https://t.co/vR7fiKQd9A https://t.co/D1PdTId0CE
How did those rude loons disrupting the Kavanaugh hearings get in there?  Clear the room or start caning them when they open their yaps!  Durbin says it's voice of democracy. No sir--it's the voice of ppl w/o basic manners or respect for others.
Don't know why Dems want more documents than ever asked for EVER in SCOTUS nomination when they didn't even read the 1100 pages of Obamacare.  Who are they kidding that they want docs so they can "read" them? Call the roll, Mr. Chairman!
Breaks my heart to say it, but Sessions needs to go.  Read more: https://t.co/swbVRRNOI7 https://t.co/Vvk1uq4SvY

Happy Labor Day, everyone!  I hope that you’re enjoying a long weekend in whatever way you choose.  There’s an old joke that Labor Day is when we celebrate workers by taking the day off.  But it’s much more than that. https://t.co/Nypy6MwFwF https://t.co/j9irz1JtK4
It was a weekend of funerals and Trump-bashing, simultaneously.  Of course, everything now is about Trump, and hating, and hating Trump, and almost no one is acting like an adult these days. https://t.co/0ZdwYzff39 https://t.co/mTfzdet9yc
I was so excited when I got a phone call advising I had won $3 million in a sweepstakes.  Then they told me they would pay it out $1 a year for the next 3 million years. They think I'm stupid! I'd spend almost the entire dollar on postage to make bank deposit! Rip off!
Since Big Labor no longer serves working ppl but is a shill for the Dems, Labor Day will now be dedicated to women giving birth--the new LABOR MOVEMENT! https://t.co/XgZqcqBebr

Kudos to @AmericanAir pilot and crew-handled medical issue on red eye from LAX to Nashville very professionally. We were held for a while as medical personnel made sure the person wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow from Contagion. Seriously, hope the lady is okay--taken on gurney.
1 hr after landing got to far away gate where @AmericanAir will hopefully get us off this plane!  Medical personal at gate.  Hope it’s not because I got that straw in CA! https://t.co/g5AJvacyqE
5 hr red eye flight on @AmericanAir Nashville from LA. On ground for 40 min and now told someone on board is sick &amp; we are being towed to other gate and quarantined until all checked out. Can’t get up to go to bathroom or get off plane.  It’s the Russians!  I just know it!
Omarosa says she has tapes of a unicorn and a leprechaun talking about mermaids.  CNN and NBC scramble to get her on first.
Gov Andrew Cuomo of NY actually said: "If I were president of the US, I would not be trying to roll back a woman’s right to choose. I would not be ripping babies out of the arms of their mothers." But it's okay to rip babies from a mother's womb?  That is SICK, Cuomo!
It seemed at first that the Democrats’ embrace of the MeToo movement would do away with due process, and all it would take to derail a man’s career would be an accusation of sexual abuse.

"Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI – finally. The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer and longer." That’s Pres. Trump, breaking the news of deputy FBI Director Peter Strzok’s firing on Twitter (where else?) on Monday. Read more: https://t.co/1wOJcuw5GE
Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok says he was fired because of politics.  That’s true.  Politics got him fired all right.  HIS politics that he used to try and stop @realDonaldTrump from being @POTUS was his undoing. Don’t let the door hit you where the good Lord spilt you!
On way to CA for mtgs. Since it’s become a foreign country I have my passport and stashed some plastic straws in lining of suitcase. If caught I will ask for sanctuary status!

Even after the release of a 568-page report documenting example after example of the stunning partisanship infecting our federal bureaucracy, new clues suggest we’re still just seeing the tip of the dirty old iceberg. https://t.co/ZEVPLzDTEg https://t.co/R3VPrwRSxB

Don't miss @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 9amET and @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 9:30amET as I will be wearing @FLOTUS  controversial jacket which I actually designed and made. Mystery revealed!

The news that an Islamic reform group had received an apology and a nearly $3.4 million settlement from the Southern Poverty Law Center for falsely branding them as “anti-Islam extremists” has emboldened more defamed groups to stand up to the SPLC. https://t.co/dAna2nBdg6 https://t.co/tEiOvscP3b

Hamas is a terrorist organization. They lie. They kill innocent people and aim rockets at babies.  They pretend they are helping babies. They are a gov't equivalent of Planned Parenthood.  Hamas doesn't kill as many people as PP though.  https://t.co/TstBCMGFfL
ALERT!  I'll be on @EveningEdit w/ Liz McDonald on @FoxBusiness and will play secretly recorded audio from @realDonaldTrump lunch w/ Kim Jong Un and they ain't talking about how crunchy the fries are!

Is there any way Jeff Flake would just go home NOW?  His petulance and pride seems more important to him than doing his job and confirming good judges.  He is putting his hate of Trump ahead of love of the country.  #fireFlake  https://t.co/eUiWFGKFdq
My exclusive interview w/ @realDonaldTrump this weekend.  We share recipes, talk sports, show each other our surgical scars.   Not much news to really talk about this week.     https://t.co/jmANrSwSrx
Breaking news from ABC!  Unemployment numbers UP again...well, at least for some sad sacks at ABC who wrote and broadcast graphic saying Paul Manafort pleaded guilty to 5 counts of manslaughter.  FAKE NEWS!  (It was only 4 counts.) https://t.co/qsTMu0YOFN
Relax America!  You're safe now! TSA in Little Rock just felt me up real good and gave me as complete a going over as I got from my doctor at my last checkup. The TSA dude could have at least bought me dinner!
As every parent knows, the cry of a child evokes a Pavlovian response that will grab your heartstrings and make you drop whatever you’re doing and run to pay attention. That's why the Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) are... https://t.co/TDwlSelY6K https://t.co/4fVUpwfTlG

Remembering my Dad today.  He died in 1996. Didn’t finish high school, worked 2 jobs and never made much money but was honest hardworking and had great sense of humor. What he lacked in education he made up for in common sense.
I don't like immigrant children being temporarily separated from parents, but where is outrage over PERMANENT separation of a child and mother when the baby is ripped apart in the mother's womb by knives of abortionists?
I'm up late 2nite planning and preparing for an unplanned and unscheduled impromptu surprise appearance on @foxandfriends on @FoxNews tomorrow at 7am ET/6CT from the White House lawn.  It's never been done before so don't miss it!

The next thing corrupt FBI official Peter Strzok should hear is “You have the right to remain silent...”. If this thug doesn’t do time, we need to open the doors of federal prisons and let ppl out who did far lesser things.
Last week’s jobless claims total was 218,000, which is 6,000 fewer than expected and the lowest in 44-1/2 years.  Hardest hit by the news: Bill Maher.  Happy Birthday @realDonaldTrump 	https://t.co/yDNnZlolZ3
I knew the anti-Trump elements in the media would never be able to give him any credit for his historic meeting with Kim Jong-Un: I didn’t think that even they would be able to depict it as the Code Red DISASTER that they did.  https://t.co/LGpZSJiMkB https://t.co/sUTOMbuspx

Will be on @LouDobbs on @FoxBusiness tonight during 7ET time.  I think we are both fired up about Corker forgetting that WAY more people vote for @realDonaldTrump than ever voted for him. Corkers legacy is Obama’s Iran deal. Wish he had poked THAT bear!
Over the past few days, the predominant theme of my commentary has been “double standards.”  As I sit and watch the almost surreal pictures from Singapore of President Trump and Kim Jong-Un shaking hands, it’s impossible not to think of that again. https://t.co/AXblCT20v9 https://t.co/qpYIPTtvfD
Here are a few basic truths to bear in mind when you're being bombarded with hysterical media coverage: https://t.co/yvF7xDhQb1 https://t.co/GhAOSLCtZN
If you’re tired of how the leftist excuses about the 2016 election are now repeated as if they’re “settled science, then read this article.  And if you’re Hillary Clinton, read it twice.	https://t.co/KjMpAao8Rl https://t.co/3L5yBXRWtI
Outgoing (thank goodness!) Sen Corker just said GOP is like "cult" because of support of @realDonaldTrump but that's nonsense. We're just sick of CULT of DC swamp-rats who sold out America to give Obama the Iran deal, failed to protect borders, &amp; kept funding killing of babies.
The media and leftists (same thing) are unhinged. Bill Maher wants economy to fail so @realDonaldTrump can be blamed and one gets impression that some would rather have nuclear bombs hitting America than @POTUS resolving NOKO issue. How sick is that?
One of the more surreal sidelights to the startling and momentous events in Singapore was an interview given by ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman to CNN.  	 Wearing a red “MAGA” cap...Rodman became emotional as he praised Trump https://t.co/gbKF9R58FZ https://t.co/j01Fd9nN5I
On heels of NOKO summit, @realDonaldTrump just announced he will seek to negotiate with @IHOb to get them to change their name back to IHOP cause ain’t nobody going there for BURGERS!  What were they thinking?
Sen Claire-Air McCaskill of MO has an RV with wings!   But it’s the dishonesty about it that’s seems so shady.  Maybe MO will send her home and she can park her “RV” in a hangar. https://t.co/I2lDqLmzvo
I was anxiously awaiting the morning shows and headlines from the liberal media to see how they could possibly spin President Trump’s summit with Kim Jong-Un as a horrible, awful, no-good, very bad thing. And they didn’t disappoint. https://t.co/QMfRkQhwN2 https://t.co/udbpPKx5wi

Bill Clinton's statement revealing and VERY troubling.  Most of us believed that rape and sexual assault were ALWAYS wrong and illegal. Those were NORMS for the rest of us already.  https://t.co/l8XSR4UcvU
Totally breaks my heart to hear this.  Don't know Bode Miller other than by his incredible Olympic feats, but I am so saddened by such tragic news. Can't imagine the anguish and grief.  Hope all will pray for this Dad, Mom, and their family. https://t.co/Clsvw79Yqs
Rough translation of what Kim &amp; his generals said after meeting:  	Generals: Why did U sign the document before we had a chance to read it?  	Kim:  I couldn't help it, he's just so GOOD at this!  I think I agreed to give up my nukes and buy a timeshare condo at a Trump resort!
Yes, there remains much work to be done, but can even his harshest critics give @POTUS  credit for a historic step?  If not, then we will know the contempt toward @realDonaldTrump is stronger than hope for a better world. https://t.co/inV1fOdFRG
My thoughts on the today's 5-4 SCOTUS decision upholding the Ohio law for purging invalid voters from the voting rolls.  https://t.co/oXFaluXxfI https://t.co/mmHJphSPX7

I just called Robert De Niro and told him that he's out of my "circle of trust."  He cried like a 6 year old who didn't get cake at the birthday party and begged to get back in.  https://t.co/XK6YKlRw96. https://t.co/GdNOKSwxRI
Only thing sadder than De Niro's vile rant is that high-toned elite snobs at the event gave him a standing O.  Were U raised by wolves? Your hate and contempt works in H'wood, NY &amp; DC, but in the land of "God, Guns, Grits &amp; Gravy" ppl pray for you to get over your bitterness. https://t.co/xvzJ6Fkyj4
What does Kim Jong Un REALLY want from the summit?  Gold? No. Groceries? No.  GOLDEN ARCHES!  He wants a McDonald's!  He and his family can eat the burgers; the peasants can eat the boxes.  https://t.co/ogTDUCWZK2
In Branson, MO for a couple of days taping my TBN show at Silver Dollar City. I love this place! Just ran into Angela Merkel at Dairy Queen-she said that photo wasn't her talking down to @realDonaldTrump but she was asking if she could get a discount at Trump Int'l Hotel.

Dang hearing loss!  @realDonaldTrump asked me to come to Singapore but I thought he said “sing some more” so now I have laryngitis from singing so much and I still can’t hear and missed the trip. https://t.co/hQiftV3aRK
Watching the Trump-haters and media (but I repeat myself) faint because he stomps into G-7 like the Incredible Hulk at a Junior League tea proves they'd rather him surrender America's interests to lesser nations than to demand that we all play by the same rules.
I'll be on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at9pm ET, right after my show on @TBN at 8pm ET so you get a "2nd blessing!"  I'm battling laryngitist, so will whistle my answers.
@realDonaldTrump is doing what he promised by putting America first and the globalists in the media, GOP and Dem Party can’t take it.  Many of us say “it’s about time a @POTUS is not afraid to fight for US and not corporate and foreign interests. https://t.co/UsO7JcrUcv

Anthony Bourdain's suicide a sobering reminder of how fragile life is and that we never know what's going on inside of another.  Suicide is rarely a person acting, but rather being acted upon by the disease of clinical depression. We are all vulnerable. So very sad.
Pen wars: The latest extravagant waste of taxpayer money by EPA Chief Scott Pruitt for Trump critics to be OUTRAGED™ over: the Washington Post revealed that Pruitt spent $130 each on 12 custom fountain pens from a jewelry store. The left is howling: https://t.co/NEb1lTkKdO https://t.co/P8FYeFmExO

One of the most moving and sobering experiences of my life was a trip Janet and I made to Normandy.  The depth of valor of those young men storming those beaches is hard to comprehend.  On the anniversary of that day, I pay tribute to them.
First Lady Melania Trump has been out of the public eye for a few weeks, which seems perfectly normal considering she recently underwent kidney surgery. But since lack of facts never seems to get in the way of the media reporting an anti-Trump story...https://t.co/nvGmzqmmWd https://t.co/hhEdhFER6C

Unfortunately, while today’s 7-2 ruling in favor of Phillips is welcome and long-overdue relief for him, it still only tinkers around the edges of fixing the damage wrought by the original decision. https://t.co/PVCCEscU92 https://t.co/RjZ9cjcCD1
The decision upholds 1st Amendment that Govt can’t make law that forces ppl to violate their legitimate religious beliefs.  That Kennedy wrote opinion is significant. https://t.co/GIOHASv3L0

Yes I DID “Keep Up With A Kardashian” on my @TBN show this weekend.  My reasons will surprise you!  https://t.co/HJhmU0QasP
After reading Kyle Cheney’s piece in POLITICO that mentioned my commentary about Trey Gowdy, I was left with one question: where to start? https://t.co/5gM4qfA8ld https://t.co/pdPcGu9n14
David Horowitz and @benshapiro join me on @TBN at 8Et/7ct along with comedian Jason Michaels and Felix Cavaliere of the Rascals.  A bowl of hot soup for all who tune in!
2nite don’t miss https://t.co/GH1TONBY5r
Tell me you didn’t miss this on @foxandfriends on @FoxNews today!  @realDonaldTrump was watching and you should have too.  Better than Malt-O-Meal! https://t.co/FcpWBokMZV
Will be on @foxandfriends today on @FoxNews at 6:30am ET and appear from a @Starbucks in DC where I spent the night.  I had free lodging, free wifi, and enjoyed chatting with the other "guests" about the coffee we didn't buy and of course race.
Today's newsletter is out and it is full of fresh news (not the fake kind from CNN)! I write about the North Korea summit, Nancy Pelosi's crumbs, the Obama-Trump pen wars, and much more! Dive in: https://t.co/2tlbMJHf3K https://t.co/TlKFU4a0ME
After sneeringly dismissing the raises and bonuses many workers enjoyed due to the GOP tax cut as “crumbs,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is now desperately trying to put a negative spin on the latest eye-popping economic news:  https://t.co/0qjhv2C0FQ https://t.co/rfZn2xNe53
For those keeping score, Nancy Pelosi has now come out against tax cuts, raises, bonuses, strong GDP growth &amp; record low unemployment and in favor of MS-13 gang members.  Presenting the winning "blue wave" platform!  		https://t.co/g0o0VDi66n
Musical guest 2nite on https://t.co/GH1TONTyWZ is Felix Cavaliere of the Rascals.  “Good Lovin” and Good Fun! https://t.co/OCw0WYMNsK
Headed to DC today.  Hope all my shots are current.
My show @TBN is on 2nite. Guests include David Horowitz and @benshapiro and if you don’t watch Bob Mueller will interrogate you for 6 hrs and then make you watch Joy Reid explain her blog posts.                        https://t.co/K3Ox2qoE1j

This morning, the Labor Department reported a better-than-expected 223,000 jobs were created in May, and unemployment fell to 3.8%, tying the record low. This is another reason why that fabled “blue wave” is looking more like a ripple in a kiddie pool https://t.co/FdDSAQHLE6 https://t.co/gVw8dQFTKk
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein needs to be recused in the “Russia/Trump” investigation because he’s a potential witness in the case. Hey, we already knew that. In fact, he should have recused himself at the very start. But...https://t.co/hOmK4oxnc1 https://t.co/4ePmq6immC
There seems to be a theme to this week’s news: controversial comediennes derailing their careers by making offensive attacks. But frankly, I’m a little burned out on talking about this subject, so I thought I’d turn this one over to an expert.https://t.co/feBU9xhQpR https://t.co/oLvhsbAfEh

I WON'T be using language used by the vile, vulgar leftist so-called "comedian" on @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 9:30am ET or @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 10amET because I'd get fired &amp; I would NEVER say that about someone anyway.  I had parents, wasn't raised by wolves.

Obama adviser Ben Rhodes has written a book about the 2016 election called “The World As It Is,” a hilarious title considering Rhodes is most famous for admitting he sold the Iran nuclear deal by feeding a lot of banana oil to ignorant young reporters... https://t.co/UiUKJdtZkR https://t.co/dBS4W7eC62
Yesterday, I wrote about the irony of an MSNBC interviewer in full Roseanne pile-on mode asking the network’s star Joy Reid just what someone has to do on social media to get fired by a TV network.Well, brace yourself for her act two. https://t.co/IXIH6lV4re https://t.co/rDh0onRoCA
Wed., President Trump fulfilled a campaign promise by signing the “Right-to-Try” law. The law is very popular: there are already similar laws in 40 states, and it passed the Senate unanimously. However, in the recent House vote, it passed by only 250-169. https://t.co/pyozrxpJvk https://t.co/FgivDBd3dc
Most Americans are already tired of it.  $17 million spent so far.  As a Senator you should publicly call for Mueller to have a farewell dinner.  Invite Comey to give the invocation. Eat, burp, and call it a night. https://t.co/StdG7zR9Xf

If not for double standards liberals and TV networks (but I repeat myself) would have no standards at all.  #samanthaBEHAVE!
I don't "Keep up with" @KimKardashian but glad she pushes for criminal justice reform w/ @realDonaldTrump --  My long-time prison director said it best: "We lock up a lot of people we're mad at rather than the ones we're afraid of." It's time to make changes.
Okay, I know this is just a minor concern, but when nobody was paying attention, Sen. Bill Cassidy introduced a proposal Tuesday that he hopes will spark debate and action on lowering health care costs for Americans without harming quality of care.https://t.co/vkO5tJ14pn https://t.co/WIGMEfWeXP

I'll be on @TheStoryFNC w/ @marthamaccallum at 7pmET/6pm CT; I plan to take an Ambien an hour before my appearance. Might be worth watching! Last time I took Ambien I put on a Wonder Woman suit, made a key lime pie and climbed on my neighbor's roof.
Another big story that got drowned out by the Roseanne brouhaha on Tuesday was that Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens resigned.

Unfortunate that summit in Singapore called off, but more unfortunate if Kim Jong Un thinks @realDonaldTrump is same as dealing w/ Pres Obama.  Li'l Kim needs more time at negotiating table and less time at his table at the Golden Corral.
NOKO summit canceled for now by @realDonaldTrump but you can still save 15% on car insurance at GEICO.
Breaking wind from CNN!  NOKO didn't blow up nuke site, but a Starbucks store because too many homeless N Koreans had moved in there to live, use wifi, and have a free indoor bathroom.  No lattes for YOU! Baristas no longer ask if "you want room?"  https://t.co/rJ9cKCQFxg

I have to disagree w/ @realDonaldTrump calling MS-13 "animals."  He shouldn't say that.  It's an insult to animals who kill for self-defense or for food, but not for pleasure of killing. To stab, decapitate, and rip heart out of person is work of monster. Leave animals out of it!

Of course Jeff "Flaky Flake" didn't vote for Gina Haspel.  If @realDonaldTrump nominated James Bond, he would have voted "no."  That's why Flake is "Dr. No."  And I'll be HE colluded with the Russians!  "From Russia With Love."

24 hrs of travel from Israel and expected welcome with roses, marching band, and adoring crowds. No roses, music or adoring crowds.  One guy waved, but only used 1 finger and Customs detained me for enhanced interrogation, but were nice.  Used that KY jelly-grateful for Kentucky!

If I had any doubts that the decision by @POTUS to end horrible Iran deal were right, just take note of the immediate and irrational reaction from @realDonaldTrump haters who Iactually thought Ayatollahs were just fine.
Once again @realDonaldTrump keeps a promise.  Iran deal is deader than Osama Bin Laden. I'm in Israel right now and there is gratitude for a US President who stands up FOR allies and stands up TO enemies.  Refreshing!

After seeing the young female hired to verbally bully anyone who worked for @realDonaldTrump I now understand why eating Tide Pods is popular.  That level of vulgarity is best handled with a mouth washed out w/ soap. Have some more Tide Pods.
Those who think that the tasteless classless bullying at the WHCD was an example of the 1st Amendment should never condemn bullying,bigoted comments, racist bile or hate speech.  People should be free to speak but held accountable for it.
Sincere and heartfelt THANKS to @maggieNYT for having guts to publicly denounce the vicious vile attack on @PressSec at WHCD.  @PressSec handled it professionally but I pray her kids never see that. I pray more they never bully another person like that. https://t.co/UeJEaXTt8T

A surprising story about @WhoopiGoldberg from @candacecbure on my show 2nite on @TBN 8&amp;11pm ET. It will explain why I actually really like @WhoopiGoldberg and have for long time. https://t.co/W09NEyrVrw

Up at 3am for early flight and learned that little Alfie Evans had died. Maybe he would have even if UK govt had allowed his parents to take their own child to Italy to seek other treatment, but we’ll never know.  Alfie is dead.  Govt is not God.

Signed peace agreement by NOKO and S. Korea-stunning, historic, &amp; gives hope for the region. Can even his craziest critics acknowledge that @realDonaldTrump is largely responsible?  Will he get a Nobel Peace Prize?  Maybe at least Elizabeth Warren can give him a peace pipe.

One reason Dems gave not to support Adm Jackson for VA Sec was lack of mgt experience.  God knows we wouldn't want someone leading something big w/o exec experience.  Maybe we can find a community organizer to head VA!

CNN’s Acosta is blatantly disrespectful to @POTUS and @PressSec and shouts rude and belligerent questions and that is his 1st Amendment right.  But if he wants respect, he needs to show some. Otherwise he comes across like a whiny bully. I of course am objective! 😂 https://t.co/Syy2UrR7VU
Yeti, which sells more coolers to people who like hunting and not as many to people who prefer sitting indoors, smoking pot and stuffing envelopes for Bernie Sanders, says NRA not only group it’s disconnecting to.  So @YETICoolers-who are the other groups ??
Menu @WhiteHouse dinner included Jambalaya.  Hey, @PressSec if you, @FLOTUS or @POTUS could see if there are any leftovers of that, I do love Cajun dishes!  But where was the boudin? Or heck, @PopeyesChicken would have been good.
The way @realDonaldTrump and French President @EmmanuelMacron get along, I feel sure that the reason is because John Kerry took James Taylor over to France to sing "You've Got A Friend" a few years back.

I know President Trump has his plate full, what with trying to denuclearize North Korea and being sued by the DNC over the pain and suffering of having lost the election, but I hope he can devote some attention to this desperate situation. https://t.co/7D0ONyzKOi https://t.co/oftGqo0k5u
On the very day Brits celebrated the Royal baby, the UK government removed life support system from 23-month-old Alfie Evans and stationed a line of police to keep his frantic parents from moving him to another hospital that would grant him care.  A royal shame!
https://t.co/qVcA95EYyi
The gut-wrenching story of Alfie Evans is why we should not let gov't make decisions that only God should make. Brits have decided some kids just aren't worth that much and are disposable. #prayforalfie   https://t.co/OP6lkXrL1N
Well, who'd a thunk it!  Nancy Pelosi and I finally have something in common-neither of us were invited to that fancy "steak dinner" at the White House 2nite. They were afraid I wasn't learnt good table manners and they didn't think Nancy would want to eat just the crumbs.
On w/ @MariaBartiromo at 6:20 am ET/5:20CT on @FoxBusiness and will electronically transfer hot oatmeal to viewers, but only if they REALLY believe!  Will YOU have oatmeal today?
I'll be having a double espresso so I can stay up to be guest on @ShannonBream on @FoxNews at 11pmET/10CT but it will be worth staying up for! @realDonaldTrump and Pres Macron will cut the Mt. Vernon trip short to get back to DC to watch.

If @realDonaldTrump were really like a "mob boss", the smart thing for Jim Comey would be to go into the Witness Protection Program and disappear from public life, which, come to think of it, would be nice for the rest of us as well.

Waiting to see if ACLU will weigh in on the raid of Michael Cohen's office and home.  If gov't can seize privileged communication between a client and lawyer, what civil liberties are left?  Hate @realDonaldTrump if you must, but 4th and 5th amendments shouldn't be shredded.

Flight to NY diverted to DC because of weather in NY and we were running out of fossil fuel.  Being bounced around rough air like a bull rider but captain will give us all rodeo  belt buckles if we don’t puke or fall out of our seats. Yippee Ki-Yay!
50 yrs ago today Dr Martin Luther King Jr was murdered in Memphis.  He preached non-violence.  He changed the world. He was first and foremost by his own declaration a Gospel preacher. He gave sermons not speeches.  He was “not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.”
Had a colonoscopy today.  My doctor was actually Russian.  Now THAT is what I call RUSSIAN MEDDLING!  They put me to sleep w/ same stuff Michael Jackon used.  When I woke up, I MOON-walked right out of the hospital!
So I get this response to my tweet:  “I generally try to miss most of your garbage and spew.”  Do people know they are not required to follow me in Twitter?  My Tweets aren’t for the feeble, hateful, or humorless so I blocked this sad bitter troll. Bye Bye!
ICYMI, I explained on this weekend's @TBN #huckabeeonTBN how grandkids teach us some really big things.  Watch and tell me what YOU think.  https://t.co/KdU3rBAg7i
Actually for once, CNN's Acosta is correct.  He CAN exercise his 1st amendment rights.  And in doing so, proves that yelling  questions @POTUS during children's event is what we expect from the south end of a north-bound mule. https://t.co/WAcKa1Lfie

Did Pope Francis really say there is no hell?  I doubt that he said that.  He visited Congress in 2015.  He KNOWS there is a hell because he's been there! #hellisreal
Yep!  CA judge rules coffee shops have to warn customers coffee can cause cancer.  Why not a ruling that those entering CA are entering a "Brain Free Zone" where CA judges cause loss of common sense?  https://t.co/H1KWPt9kOp
@andyman0216 @TBN Thanks @andyman2016 for nailing it.  It amuses me that people revealing their constipation of the mind and diarrhea of the mouth have NO sense of humor and give me attention they don’t think I deserve.  I enjoy using up their time so they aren’t spewing hate at ppl who might care
Check out the trailer for this week’s show on @TBN. #huckabeeontbn. https://t.co/RS3XYQcnJN

With all grandkids here I spend my entire day counting to 6!  Good thing I got that there fine edukashun and learnt me how to cipher!
All 6 grandkids at my house this week.  I think they are Russian-they've created complete CHAOS!  But unlike @realDonaldTrump and Russians, I won't expel them.  It's chaos I cherish!
#GodsNotDead A Light in Darkness is a moving story of hope, healing and faith under fire. Check it out in theaters this Friday.	https://t.co/YAY3zenOge
All TV programming will be suspended at 11pm et and ALL networks will switch to @ShannonBream on @FoxNews  where I will be on to mumble incoherently for several minutes. Only Nancy Pelosi will understand what I’m saying.
Remember when Hillary said that her voters were sophisticated and educated and the @realDonaldTrump were  ignorant hillbillies and old white men?  Well, how about a FACT CHECK?  https://t.co/WNu8VEO1Pu
Observing anti-gun rallies featuring young people (but actually funded and stage-managed by leftwing activist organizers), fmr President Obama said that if he could, he would create “a million Barack Obamas.”  No thanks, we’re still trying to fix the damage done by just the one.
Corruption in politicians is awful, but we can fix it.  There are 3 areas of our system where corruption may be the end of our form of government.  I explain in this from @TBN show #huckabeeonTBN  https://t.co/MUaH6DFBHf
Here's column from https://t.co/1CpeXfeqTx that you can subscribe to for free.  Daily news and commentary.  This on whether it's true about a "good guy w/ a gun stopping a bad guy w/ a gun."  https://t.co/VgTiU8GSVd

To the poor soul who claimed I lied on @foxandfriends when I said 5x more ppl killed by knives than RIFLES-You DO know difference btwn RIFLE (which you want to ban) and all other guns don’t you? You proved my point that we shouldn’t make policy on emotion but facts.
What you missed by sleeping late! https://t.co/C4VAZf1BkV

About to be on @foxandfriends at 730am et.  @realDonaldTrump will be watching but so will Chuck Schumer actually never misses my TV appearances but he keeps it secret!  Ssshhhh!
I join with others in disappointment and disgust with the Omni-BS bill. https://t.co/W4Bcsjnknp
Do you really need another reason to watch @HuckabeeonTBN 2nite and Sunday at 8&amp;11pm ET on https://t.co/HEb0ei4okJ or your cable/satellite source? Our band plays "Heard it Through the Grapevine" with bass player who almost stinks it up. https://t.co/YEnqyXmfI4
AND....AND....AND....I explain how Twitter brings out really nice people and really, REALLY insane humorless people... https://t.co/pGhxGWbk76

Just curious-other than GOP members of Congress congratulating themselves for the Omni-BS "bucket of pork belly," are there ANY conservatives happy about "Spend-fest?"  Let me know.  I haven't heard from even ONE.  #OUTRAGE
I hope if I’m ever held hostage that the GOP won’t be negotiating for my release.  Given their failure with this Omni-BS spending orgy they would pay the terrorists more than they demanded and then shoot me themselves! God help us! #DefundPlannedParenthood
Porky Pig dances with Chuck and Nancy over larded up spending bill. Maybe @POTUS will veto.  But it does include funding for "breastfeeding." Makes sense, sense it's all about being on the gov't teat!  https://t.co/kPjSf1fx5q
You can skip breakfast and you SHOULD skip watching CNN, the "porn channel," but you should NEVER skip daily commentary that comes to you free and untouched by Russian hands!  Like this one about another strange Clinton connection.  https://t.co/eobOD55ZGT
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for considering VETO of a bill that insults the people who voted for you.  The GOP leadership sold out. You don’t have to! #DefundPlannedParenthood https://t.co/8oTA5PqLHN
I'm set to be on @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 9am ET and @FoxNews at 9:30 am ET and I'll give a shout-out to Sen Rand Paul and other Republicans who refused to step in the warm pile of bovine droppings packaged as a budget that did everything GOP said they WOULDN'T do. #shameful
Don’t spend your weekend thinking about the GOP budget betrayal.  Join me for TV worth watching!  https://t.co/6p3c6mJ6Xz
If there is such a thing as “political Viagra” please get it to the GOP Congress immediately because they are embarrassingly impotent to do what they promised.  Maybe borrow some testosterone from Nancy Pelosi who has more than our team!  #DefundPP #ShameOnYou
If teens are wise enough to make laws, why do U have to be 25 to serve in the House, 30 for Senate and 35 for President?  Shouldn’t we lower those &amp; voting age, to 13; and if teens can be trusted to change our laws, why make it illegal for anyone under 21 to buy guns?
Will be on @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness at 7:30am ET and will let loose on GOP for collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on disgusting spending bill.  It's not a compromise--it's capitulation! To borrow phrase from Nancy Reagan, "JUST SAY NO!" #NoExcuses
If GOP funds Planned Parenthood again and thereby LIE to the voters again, then the incumbent GOP members of Congress need to be ABORTED at election time. You have BOTH houses of Congress and WH.  Do. Your. Job. NOW! #DefundPP #NoExcuses
I'll be on @FoxBusiness today at 5pm ET and will announce my purchase of Facebook from Mark Zuckerberg.  I can't pay for all of it now, but I've given a post-dated check for the amount.  He said he trusts me.
Personal data mined from Facebook used to help a Pres candidate in 2016. Horrendous!!  Oh, wait I was talking about how the COO of FB contacted Hillary's campaign mgr John Podesta to offer Facebook’s resources because she wanted Hillary “to win badly.”  https://t.co/Vga39mEAec
Relieved for people of Austin that bomber is killed.  Such senseless tragedy for innocent people he murdered.  Gratitude for law enforcement for job well done in finding and stopping him.
Will be on @ShannonBream on @FoxNews 2nite at 11pm et and will be telling deep dark secrets I learned from reading Russian dossiers and confessing how I voted just like my wife told me to.
Pathetic BULLY, sexist, hater, bigot &amp; "Christaphobe" @jimcarrey attacks @PressSec for her faith; what would be hypocritical Hollywood reaction if he called someone a "so-called Muslim" or "so-called Jew?" #classlessCarrey https://t.co/HCqHoER0Ru

Our nation can and has survived bad and corrupt politicians but it cannot survive if those entrusted to uphold and enforce the LAW abuse it for their own purposes. That’s why firing of McCabe and rooting out deep state is essential for saving our Republic. #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp
Opening weekend for “I Can Only Imagine” and the movie explains the hit song.  @BartMillard and @TraceAdkins and Dennis Quaid tonight on @HuckabeeOnTBN 8&amp;11pm et. See movie and Huckabee tonight! https://t.co/CHzOV3FTcJ
Let’s be honest. McCabe WAS fired for politics!  For letting HIS politics causing him to wreck his career by lying under oath.  And yes the Russians tried to meddle in elections but the more serious issue is our OWN GOVT meddling in our elections. Let @GenFlynn go!
If Mueller has no proof @realDonaldTrump colluded with Russia-fold the tent and go home! Taxpayers shouldn’t  pay for ship and crew to play Capt Ahab on endless trek to harpoon the great, white whale existing only in the fevered minds of bitter Hillary Clinton supporters.
Why the movie “A Wrinkle in Time” shows why Hollywood is in death spiral.  https://t.co/fl9bWGf3Py
Breaking Wind from CNN!  Andy McCabe offered deal for lying to FBI and won’t get pension but will get passage in overhead bin on United flight to Oakland to work for scofflaw mayor.
Up at 245 am to get to airport for flight to Nashville for LONG but wonderful day to tape Show for weekend. I’m doing it all for YOU so you better watch @TBN Sat and Sunday 8&amp;11pm et!  Going be awesome show if I can stay awake! https://t.co/EAnfjByXQS
If McCabe ISN'T fired as per FBI investigative unit,then can ANYONE lie to FBI w/ no consequences?  Apologize and restore Gen Mike Flynn? Martha Stewart?  Every defense atty in USA w/ client in slammer for same thing should demand "The McCabe" treatment! https://t.co/kCuM8nFA78
Delayed flight. Tight connection. Doing the @Delta dash through ATL. Barely made it. Today @Delta almost meant “Didn’t Even Leave The Airport.”  On planes 6 straight days. One home and back for 3 more. I think I will just Fedex myself to locations.  Less stressful.
Hillary goes to India and says Southern women voted the way their husbands told them to.  Hillary needs help.  She may have lived a few years in South but ain’t like no Southern woman I know (certainly not my wife or daughter) who wouldn’t cotton to being told! https://t.co/q0vG6jvmFW
Is there a @McDonald’s in all of America where the milkshake machine works?  Why keep it on menu?  Surely a big company like MickeyD’s can afford one that works.  #fraud
Just learned that Nokie Edwards, guitarist for the legendary Ventures has died. Every young guitarist wanted to be like him. None was; he was an original.  One of greatest joys of my life was playing "Theme to Hawaii 5-0" with him and Ventures. His music will never die.

If Gov Jerry Brown can defy federal immigration law, then will it be okay for a pro-life Governor to stop all abortions in his/her state because unborn not given due process guaranteed in 5th and 14th amendments? Sanctuary state for babies!
I’ve been asked to secure mtg site for @POTUS AND Lil Kim.  I’m thinking picnic table at “Pork Chop on a Stick” stand at Iowa State Fair.  Thoughts?

This. Guy. Is. Unhinged. 		If NRA is "terrorist" organization, then charge them for crimes.  If you don't, you are just plain making crap up and looking like an out of control loon. https://t.co/wpbtRJAlOp
CNN did great in ratings with exploitation of obviously inebriated guest.  Tonight Erin Burnett interviews Otis from the Mayberry jail.
Probably more ppl will watch me on @FoxNews at 9:30am ET and on @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 10am than watched the Oscars; I won't insult, belittle, or bully you like Hollywood so it's like a "safe space" for folks in flyover country! Watch and be amazed!
Sometimes @PressSec sure does remind me of her mother!  Today, Jim Acosta from CNN feels the burn! https://t.co/1fuMpGvsZk
Hollywood-where grownups pretend for a living &amp; pretend to be smarter &amp; morally superior;condemn walls but live  behind them; rail against guns but  protected by them &amp; use guns in their films; and espouse free speech while screaming if someone says something they disagree with.
On @foxandfriends at 6:30am ET Mon morning.  I may be up all night throwing up so worried what to say.  But maybe Donna Brazile will get questions for me....oh wait, that's just on CNN not on @FoxNews   Dang!
@JasonOwensMusic How to download your music? Heard ppl mistaking YOU for guy who doesn't like me-Very sad. I don't even want ppl to scream at THAT guy, and certainly not YOU!  From @GovMikeHuckabee Went to UR website and iTunes-want to urge my friends (both of them) to buy!
Just saw this; should be reminder to do 2 things:  1-get facts straight and don't believe cause it's "on the internet."  2-bullying someone or threatening someone's livelihood is WRONG. Wanna do something great?  Download a song from this young artist! https://t.co/aii7gjW1SS

ICYMI.  So why did you miss it?  Don’t let that EVER happen again! https://t.co/yhGn09F4g4
Not sure whose Inauguration crowd was biggest, but biggest crowd of all was at gate of heaven when Billy Graham entered--the millions greeting him were those he led to Christ who gathered to tell him "Thank You."
Watching Dr. Graham funeral and hearing moving testimony of daughter Ruth's story, I realized she best represented his entire life and ministry, which was to proclaim "Amazing Grace" of Jesus Christ.  Powerful!
So sorry I couldn't be at Billy Graham funeral today, but in Nashville to tape TV show.  One can only hope it's said as it will be of Dr. Graham, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

While in Taiwan this week, realized how bigly @realDonaldTrump appreciated here for calling President Tsai on phone and for treating Taiwan like an ally and friend. #AboutTime
In Taiwan for a couple of days where I've been named "Chopsticks King" in large ceremony for my skills with the very practical utensils I first learned to use here in Taipei in 1993.  Taiwan is great country with wonderful, hospitable and free people.  #loveTaiwan

What did I miss?  Cowardly corporations punish NRA because FBI failed to act on info re: shooter and FL Sheriff had 4 deputies who stood outside and hid during gunfire that killed 17 innocent kids.  How many NRA members did mass shootings?  ZERO.
The REAL story behind the technical glitch that happened when I was on @foxandfriends this morning.  The FCC is investigating as is the FEC,SEC,FBI, CIA, NSA,DOE,IRS,DOT,DOD,and CNN who just wants to make up something.  https://t.co/XMAx6w3YxT
Gee, I hate to do this, but @POTUS is wrong and I respectfully disagree. Ivanka is great and smart, but @PressSec is there too so we have THE BEST &amp; SMARTEST representative.  Of course, I'm as objective about her as CNN is about @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/6Go7tmHeqM

I'll be on @foxandfriends Fri morning at 8:30amET and of course @realDonaldTrump will be watching as will Robert Mueller and Vladimir Putin. If you fail to watch, you could be indicted!
Will be on @LouDobbs on @FoxBusiness at 7pm ET and w/ @ShannonBream on @FoxNews at 11pm ET.  Letting the angry and hateful know so they can watch re-runs of "Leave it to Beaver" or get to a safe place and have a popsicle!
News of Billy Graham's death is "fake news."  He's more alive than ever!  The life he now lives will never end.  THAT was his message.  If not true, his entire life was a tragedy.  It wasn't.  My tribute to Dr. Billy Graham attached.  https://t.co/KJU3aoA4aC
Deeply saddened by news of death of Billy Graham, greatest man of our time. I’ll be on @Varneyco at 945et on @FoxBusiness and @AmericaNewsroom on @FoxNews at 10:10am and will discuss. #heavenwelcomesBillyGraham
Read story @MZHemingway links.  When media says that Mueller is “registered Republican” I’m reminded that Jeff Flake, John Kasich, and Mitt Romney are “registered” too.  And @brithume reports agent Weissman attended HRC “victory” party.  #WitchHunt https://t.co/JksYODuyvw

@Appleknocker18 FYI, bot-brain, I'm on an international @Delta flight that has "weefee."  Normally don't respond to ppl who hide their ID behind cute handles, but did just to amuse myself after 6 nice hrs of sleep on a great flight from Tel Aviv.
Some questioned if I actually set up a "TAX ME MORE!" fund in Arkansas so people could voluntarily pay more in taxes.  Well, friend, you can Gargle it on the Interweb!  https://t.co/aQL4F8nHPh
When Governor of AR I created “Tax Me More” fund that ppl who wanted higher taxes could voluntarily pay to. After 1 1/2 yrs it collected just over $1000.  If Bill Gates feels guilty then write a check big enough to make you feel better! https://t.co/YLAGLOZIbW

Several yrs ago olive tree planted @yardenit_jordan in Israel next to Jordan River for me. Checked on it today.  Also don’t miss my @TBN show from Israel at 8&amp;11pm et. https://t.co/7HQ3NvjMIP
"Huckabee" is my @TBN show from Israel on 2-nite and Sunday 8&amp;11pm ET on broadcast, cable, satellite or online. I'll do my opening monologue in Hebrew and sing "Hava Nagila" in Yiddish.  Free chicken soup and rugelach!
Tonight don't miss "Huckabee" on @TBN from Israel w/ actor Jon Voight, Amb Dore Gold, Red Steagall and more! Not a single Russian on the show so watch guilt-free.  	https://t.co/PKYz4pSCzv
You know, Madame Secretary-I agree with you that President Obama who KNEW about it did NOTHING but turn loose the FBI and DOJ on private citizens.  It WAS a dereliction of duty of Pres Obama and it was big of you to admit it. https://t.co/STeCUdJEG2

One of best insights into current wave of violence.  Read w/ open mind.  I realize that will eliminate a lot of people who troll me.  https://t.co/iaEmLk5PNA
To the  ppl incapable of getting my tweet about Israel and random violence, it WAS NOT about whether Israel has restrictions on guns, but that common denominator is not the weapon, but a "person w/ intent." I learned that from Israeli intel and security officials.
Here's a rare breed--a REAL journalist who exposes how the  label of "fake news" backfired bigly on the ones who put out a pile of "fake news."  https://t.co/hgGW38ssEk
Some people in our country really do need food--there IS poverty and hunger in our nation and @realDonaldTrump has a plan that as Dems would say is "common sense." Surely they really want FOOD, not FRAUD.  https://t.co/m3mojOwkmX
While in Israel (been coming here since 1973), I have again seen their security wall that took suicide bombings from 1000 a yr to 0.  The UN and ppl around the world condemned Israel for the wall, but it worked...and did you know that Mexico paid for it?
Just waking up in Israel to news of heartbreaking school shooting in FL; Reminded that Israel pretty much eliminated it by placing highly trained people strategically to spot the one common thread--not the weapon, but a person with intent. #PrayForParkland

It’s hard to tell who’s doing the most cheerleading for North Korea: its own cheerleaders or our media. #pathetic
2-nite at 8&amp;11pm ET on "Huckabee" on @TBN I'll give latest Olympic Gold Medal report showing N. Korea getting Gold Medals in waterboarding, face-slapping, pistol-whipping, poisoning of relatives, and close-range face shooting.  CNN anchors will weep in celebration.
Kim YO Jong, Lil Sis of Lil Kim, is "stealing show" according to CNN.  She's probably stealing food and electricity to take back to her starving and sitting w/o lights people.  CNN has no shame or awareness of NOKO human rights abuses.
While CNN, NBC, and the rest of the wolf-pack media gives the Lil' Sis of Lil' Kim a tongue bath, sane people aren't fooled by a murderous regime trying to build and aim nuclear weapons.  Hey, media--can you say Otto Warmbier?  Yeah, didn't think so. #pathetic https://t.co/rkHhOc7Bqc

@huckabee4me @Delta Thanks Jackie.  Loved getting to know you on earlier trips.  Pray that our folks this time will have a wonderful experience!
It's telling that leftists who think aborting babies is a "good" thing and will "save the planet" weren't aborted by their parents and even have THEIR own children.  Elitist and twisted. Sad, sick, and yes, Satanic!  https://t.co/gjuRga3I8U
Another great reason to watch my show on @TBN 2-nite and Sunday at 8&amp;11pm ET--The hilarious Chonda Pierce whose humor could make Chuck Schumer smile!  Her humor will heal heartburn, hives, halitosis and hemorrhoids! https://t.co/AQTnJL6Uf3

Wed, Nancy Pelosi used a so-called “leadership minute” to launch into an 8 hour filibuster to promote legalizing members of the DACA program.  I can’t say how effective it was because, to be honest, every time Nancy Pelosi talks for one minute, it feels like eight hours to me.
Don't miss @FoxNews w/ @BillHemmer and @SandraSmithFox at 9am ET and then @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 9:40am ET where I'll show my new hand puppets of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page! Of course my hands will be mostly folded together and holding smart phone.
I was wrong.  There IS evidence of collusion with Russia! Proof now comes out.  But it wasn't @realDonaldTrump but it was the UNREAL Adam "Shifty" Schiff who at least thought he was cooperating with Russians.  https://t.co/h0OezEum4o

Breaking wind from CNN!  ChapStick sales plummet and Kleenex sales soar after Rep. Joe Kennedy III speech.
Sad to hear @TGowdySC leaving Congress, but I hope @realDonaldTrump asks him to take high level position in DOJ.  He's fair and tough.  Unlike some there now, he respects Constitution too much to use power of DOJ for political punishment.
SOTU contrast:  @POTUS brings tears to our eyes when pointing out NOKO escapee holding up crutches.  Pelosi says @realDonaldTrump speech would be “slobbering “ but it was Dems’ Joe III who delivered their SOTU-Slobber Of The Union speech.
75% of Americans approved @POTUS SOTU speech; but Dems expose that they DON'T approve jobs for blacks, Hispanics, immigration reform, infrastructure, bonuses/pay raises, stopping MS-13, secure borders, or unborn babies. They are for....nothing.  Sad.  https://t.co/Jr98RTDcur
Did I hear right that Joe Kennedy III is talking about saving children when his party thinks the greatest act of a government is making sure we can kill babies even after 20 weeks in the womb?  Oh my!
Was a great speech by @POTUS and extolled what makes America extraordinary, but it was LOOOOOONG so he just invited Chuck and Nancy to head to Denny's for breakfast so they can make peace.  Elizabeth Warren will attend and bring the peace pipe.
I get it that the Dems are not exuberant listening to @POTUS but it will be hard to explain to voters why they sat still when @realDonaldTrump said we shouldn't give $$ to countries who show contempt for us.
If running again a Dem this fall just show tape of them in an ad silently and soberly unable to applaud standing for National Anthem and unhappy that jobs are coming to America.

Just told I WON'T be on @TuckerCarlson 2 nite @FoxNews because they have a guy who took a pic of Obama in 2005 they think is big deal more than FBI scandal.  Ugh! So I'll watch a movie tonight, probably J. Edgar w/ Dicaprio.

BREAKING ON CNN!  Sen Schumer heads to WH today to see WH doctor Adm Ronny Jackson who will administer Montreal mental test after which @realDonaldTrump will say “Show me yours and I’ll show you mine”
Schumer is quite a deal maker-only sold his cow pie to Flaky Flake and a few other Dems who  just don’t like @realDonaldTrump. Anger of left proves it wasn’t about CHIP,military or nat’l parks. It wasn’t even DACA-it was about @POTUS who got the deal and Schumer got the squeal.

Shutdown Schumer caved-military paychecks saved; @POTUS holds-Schumer folds.  Lessons learned-Schumer burned; Build the wall-or lose it all.
Some people suspect Democrats want to legalize DACA "kids" because they think they’ll vote Democrat.  If you’re not certain why they think that, it’s because they assume that anyone who is still a “kid” at 36 has got to be a Democrat.
The 2013 shutdown that Schumer thought was so awful eventually cost taxpayers $23 billion, or $3 billion more than Trump’s border wall would cost.  It's time for Dems to "Shuck the Chuck" and pay men and women in military. #SchumerShutdown
Why does it worry me that Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham think they should broker an immigration deal? They say they know what Dems want. Of course--because it's what Flake and Graham want. But aren't they there to do the PEOPLE'S will and not Shutdown Schumer's?

Here’s some sincere advice to my friends across the aisle: get the government turned back on ASAP.  You’re dealing with a President who came to town on a promise to shut off the lights, and you just helped him by refusing to pay the electric bill.
The "Shutdown King" good ol' "Shutdown Schumer" can shut down gov't but he can't shut down my show on @TBN tonight at 8&amp;11pm ET.  Musical guest Shenandoah. Miss it and Schumer will shut YOU down! https://t.co/AhU9jhL9y1
More breaking wind from CNN, the Comedy News Network! Chuck Schumer, #ShutdownKing, rushed to hospital after eating Tide pods for breakfast because he needed to wash his mouth out with soap! #SchumerShutdown
For Schumer the "Shutdown King" leader to claim Dems have no responsibility; he knows it takes 60 votes so he is either utterly lying or ignorant of the process he leads.  Schumer turning Senate into a "shut-hole."
We'll soon know if Dems really care about CHIP, military, gov't employees, nat'l parks, &amp; border security or if ONLY thing they are willing to stand for is fix for 800K kids whose parents came illegally. Will voters realize they're being played for suckers by Schumer?
If there IS a shutdown, how long before the Dems blame it on Russia?
So proud that @POTUS is not ashamed to Stand For Life as he did today.  Any President should be ashamed to NOT stand for life.  Every person has value and worth.  No such thing as a disposable or expendable person. #MarchforLife
For the record, I support a DACA deal because we shouldn't punish kids for what their parents did.  But GOP needs to demand secure borders if Dems really care about DACA kids. But they hate @realDonaldTrump more than they love those kids.
What matters MOST to Dems? Border security? Military? Better wages, bonuses for working class (aka "crumbs")? Funding health care for kids? Infrastructure? Integrity of DOJ, FBI? Jobs? Stopping crime? Nope. 1 Thing-800K illegals.	https://t.co/EpZcA3i4le

In Honduras yesterday and in Mexico today. Thought I’d ask local doctors if they could confirm Sanjay Gupta’s CNN tabloid TV diagnosis of @realDonaldTrump .  Finally found one who did. She also reads palms and does foot massage.

Salute to Sen. Bob Dole as he's awarded Congressional Medal today. Few in American life have served our country more selflessly and effectively. In a world of politicians, Bob Dole is a statesman. God bless you, Sen. Dole!
Once there was Marky Mark. Now we have Flaky Flake.  Comparing @realDonaldTrump to Stalin is absurd and utterly offensive. Ppl don’t despise media because @POTUS calls them fake news but when 90% coverage negative and 100% of media mistakes are AGAINST Trump that IS fake news.
Sen. Corey Booker just called. He feels real bad about way he treated DHS Director Nielson yesterday; he and T-Bone are coming over next week to ride unicorns, chase leprechauns, and read Sen. Dick Blumenthal's bio of combat in Vietnam.
More "breaking wind" from CNN!  WH Press Corps to submit to voluntary brain scans to prove THEY aren't demented.  To insure accuracy of brain scan, tests will be administered by rectal probe.
Advice to @PressSec (and she should listen to ME!) At briefing today have Dr Jackson administer Montreal Cognitive Test to press corps. I think @realDonaldTrump would approve this message! Oh and invite Sen Corey Booker and his pal T-Bone to be there.
What did America learn after watching media badger WH doctor for an hour fishing for ANYTHING to show @realDonaldTrump isn't fit for office?  That @POTUS is remarkably fine physically and mentally, but the press is stark-raving NUTS!
@CillizzaCNN On that, yes.  My bad.  Did @POTUS pass the health test?  Will your network be able to say that?
Dr. Jim Acosta! Dr. Hallie Jackson! Dr. Bryan Karem! Come to ER stat!!  (Not to GIVE meds, but to TAKE some!) You guys looked like Moe, Larry and Curly.  Take some time off.  Have a cheeseburger and get as healthy as  @POTUS because you guys are about to have a stroke!
Would love to see the WH press peeps test THEIR mental health test!  There would be an empty press room and a psych ward full of reporters! Do they realize that most ppl watching them are laughing at them!
Now that a REAL doctor says @realDonaldTrump is physically and MENTALLY healthy will the dime store doctors on Morning Joke and CNN apologize for their FAKE NEWS diagnosis?  Don’t hold your breath!  But I hope the media medical mob will hold theirs!
Thanks @RichLowry  You nailed it!  It was only a deal if you wanted to betray the American ppl.  Most of us support a legal fix to DACA, but demand control of our borders and not trusting the "Dirty Durbin Deal" where Dems "will gladly pay us Tue for  hamburger today. https://t.co/YZ6sb3f3sx
Thought I was getting the flu! Sick stomach, violently throwing up, &amp; feeling dizzy &amp; head spinning. Then realized it wasn't flu-I was just watching Lindsey Graham doing his best to utterly surrender to a party that DOESN'T have Senate, House, or WH but wants ALL &amp; gives NOTHING!

Why is Jeff Flake so "flaky?"  His animosity toward @realDonaldTrump is barely surpassed by "Tricky Dicky" Durbin and his lack of factual context makes NY Slimes look fair.  Flake will only be missed by the elites and the never-Trumpers.  https://t.co/XSzgJP2JYn
Medical test results for @realDonaldTrump will be released today.  If doc proclaims @POTUS in great shape, stock prices for McDonald’s and KFC expected to soar and long lines expected to order Big Macs and buckets of chicken.
@angryandliberal UR a completely uninformed sad and hateful person.  You know NOTHING about what I did as a young student who worked to make desegregation work in my own school or as a  27 year old pastor who integrated a once all white church. I feel for sorry for your bigotry.

OH NO!  Rep. Maxine Wah-Wah Waters will skip @POTUS SOTU.  CNN reports that @realDonaldTrump will cancel making speech.  If Maxine isn't there to hear the speech, there won't be one!  It IS Armageddon just like Nancy said.  https://t.co/SJZazuU2Kz
Yes Mr Fmr President.  They live on earth.  You should visit sometime. https://t.co/SCs58EZrgn
If @POTUS said what he's accused of, I'll not defend or excuse it.  2 Senators @TomCottonAR and @sendavidperdue say @realDonaldTrump didn't say. But if Durbin was so offended, why didn't he say something to @POTUS face in mtg rather than find his courage when cams on?

I'll be on @FoxBusiness at 5:15pm ET where I will be toasting marshmallows on the South Lawn of the @WhiteHouse off what's left of Steve Bannon's torched and scorched remains.
I guess that book launch party the White House was planning for Steve Bannon is off?

Churchill was hated by his own party, opposition party, and press.  Feared by King as reckless, and despised for his bluntness.  But unlike Neville Chamberlain, he didn't retreat. We had a Chamberlain for 8 yrs; in @realDonaldTrump we have a Churchill.
Ducks took day off today but if you can get to a theater go see The Darkest Hour about Churchill.  Reminds as to what real leadership looks like.
Headed out for Arkansas prairie duck hunt this morning. Will make my Christmas complete!  First day in heaven will be flooded timber duck hunt with mallards flying!

Tax bill already results in nice bonuses for Comcast/NBC employees.  I’m sure NBC folks like Joe and Mika won’t take theirs as it would mean admitting @realDonaldTrump kept promise.  So I will graciously take their bonuses and those of any liberal who doesn’t want theirs.

Did Mueller even ask his staff (like Peter Strzok) if they had conflict of interest or were unbiased?  If not, he's incompetent.  If he DID ask &amp; Strzok told him the truth about his contempt for @POTUS, Mueller is biased. If he asked &amp; Strzok LIED, then why isn't Strzok indicted?

Why does media downplay a potentially lethal blindside attack on a US Senator as an “altercation,” and why is someone who committed such an assault out of jail on $7500 bail the very next morning? He must've had Bowe Bergdahl's judge.

ESPN now known as "Embarrassing Society of Politically-Correct Nutjobs."
ESPN will no longer air football games on TV as referees are dressed in black and white and that could be viewed as binary racism.
ESPN will not bdcst Cotton Bowl for fear it will make people think about song "Dixie" as opening line "I wish I was in the land of cotton."
ESPN will not broadcast games of any kind from Jackson, MS for fear it might honor Stonewall or Andrew Jackson and trigger someone.
ESPN will not use Dolly Parton songs as bumpers--might remind people of Dolly Madison, wife of slave-owner President James Madison.
ESPN turns itself into total joke-deserves to be ridiculed.  https://t.co/AO8Z0qdmzK

@POTUS makes STELLAR decision and appoints Sarah Huckabee Sanders as new Press Sec; Yes, I'm as objective about it as CNN is toward @POTUS!

Maybe it's Congress that needs to be repealed and replaced!  Elect a Congress that wants to work with @POTUS instead of filling the swamp.
100 yrs ago was Bolshevik Revolution-after seeing opulence of Czars I understand why. Can DC learn from history or destined to repeat it?
If GOP Senators Murkowski, Collins, and Capito won't stop Planned Parenthood $$ to vacuum babies from womb, then vacuum them out of office!
Congress has failed @POTUS but more importantly failed the American public by spending 7 years condemning ACA and then having NOTHING.
Now that Senate fails on bill let's hope they do simple repeal and turn $$ and plans over to states. Repeal and Refer.

Baby-steps to "Repair" Obamacare?  NO!  REPEAL and REPLACE with bold approach: "REPEAL and REFER" to states and free market solutions.
Congress fixing Obamacare is like having 535 wannabe chefs take their spoons and spices to the kitchen and "fixing" the pot on the stove.
Why does DC think THEY should REPLACE?  Just REPEAL!  Let states and the free market do the replacing! DC can't create a 50 state solution.
Focus on PREVENTION and CURES-not expensive INTERVENTION. Chronic disease is 80% of health costs-tackle THAT,not just "access" to insurance.
Fed healthcare plan is NO plan; Accept 10th amendment and let states create plans that include compacts allowing multi-state groups, plans.
Repeal Obamacare with 1 yr total phaseout; block grant ALL fed funds now in control of feds to states; let states craft plan for each state.

About to be on @FoxNews with the Specialists!  I get my own badge and decoder ring! @SpecialistsFNC will rock today! Watch people!
Mueller needs to 1st find who's illegally leaking and prosecute them; if he doesn't, I fear worst-that coziness w/ Comey means witch hunt.
On his own birthday, @realDonaldTrump goes to hospital to visit Cong Scalise; his actions match his comments-compassion and leadership.
Capitol Police deserve gratitude for heroism; stops shooter of GOP Congressmen in VA; thank God for sacrifice of law enforcement.
Sad news to wake up to--horrible London fire. A great city and wonderful people having too many tragedies of late. #prayingforlondon
Still ZERO evidence that @POTUS had 1 THING to do w/ Russia. Are Dems/MSM ready to try something else-Impeach him for 2 scoops of ice cream?
Dems act like they never heard of atty/client privilege; AG is top atty in Exec branch; serves @POTUS and not stooge of Congress.
Comey uncomfortable w/ @POTUS and queasy w/ L Lynch and said some things made him nauseous; Simple solution!  Tums!
Has Mark Warner read the Constitution and understand separation of powers?  Sessions taking him to school--in this case, kindergarten.
Some of the Senators in front of AG Sessions are asking for soft cushions cause they just got their butts kicked by Jeff Sessions. #butthurt

I'm ok now, but needed CPR today when Comey said wasn't sure if FBI agent legally required to report a crime he saw. Seriously?
7 words Loretta Lynch hopes she doesn't hear today after Comey testimony:  "You have the right to remain silent."
Comey wasted his talent at FBI; he testified he knew in detail what AG Sessions was thinking from body language. He's a dang clairvoyant!
Will fmr AG Lynch be charged w/ obstruction of justice after Comey revelations of demands she made? Will Dems demand it?
We learned: Comey leaked stuff to press;he was too weak to stand up to @POTUS and rolled over from pressure from AG Lynch; yes he got fired!
Dems are playing air guitar and pretending they are at Woodstock; Comey has mostly revealed HIS weakness rather than @POTUS failure.

Proud of @realDonaldTrump for telling NATO deadbeats to pay up or shut up. Dems surely like him calling for "fair share!" Right Sen Schumer?

43 yrs ago today, Janet McCain became my 1st wife. We were only 12 yrs old, making us late bloomers for a southern couple, but we lasted!
GOP candidate in MT beats crap out of reporter;we've all FELT like it, but dang, man--you're not supposed to actually DO it! Not cool.
Back on US soil-literally as they threw me from plane onto soggy grassy area at JFK; nice agent from @CustomsBorder let me in terminal.
So glad to get congrats on my new TBN TV 📺 show from all my friends.  Both of them emailed me.

If Dems and press showed @realDonaldTrump 1/2 as much respect as Saudis have, we would have health care, tax cuts, and LOTS of jobs already.
Lady at Tel Aviv airpt came up and ran her fingers through my hair;not to worry, Janet--wasn't seductive-just checking for lice. #norespect

Deeply saddened by death of Roger Ailes. He had many critics and like ALL of us his sins, but I remember a great patriot, friend and boss.

Tonight Cong Kucinich &amp; I on @seanhannity 10et. Don't miss THE conversation smart ppl will be buzzing abt tomorrow. Idiots wont understand.

In crisis Dems circle their wagons; Repubs circle in a firing squad and start shooting each other. @POTUS fights Dems MSM and his own GOP
Brilliant young atty who once worked for me has powerful questions NY Times ought to ask.  Please read.    https://t.co/ktx9u2Crph
CNN quotes anonymous sources that @realDonaldTrump had 3 scoops of ice cream and called it an ice cream Comey.
NY Times now reports that anonymous source saw @realDonaldTrump on grassy knoll in Dallas on Nov 22, 1963. Cong Adam Shifty says impeach!
On way to Chicago for speech. Expecting to have to run from plane dodging bullets like Hillary did in Bosnia when under sniper fire! Yikes!
G Kessler at WAPO tweeted that newsroom cheered at rpt of fake story that @realDonaldTrump leaked top secret info to Russians. Objectivity?
Washington ComPost runs fake news story of @realDonaldTrump and Russians;Everyone there says it's lie; it's why ppl hate and distrust media.
Tues I'll be on @FoxNews 10am ET and @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness at 10:45 ET; WATCH or the Russians will put ransom ware on your laptop!
Grateful that @POTUS expanded Mexico City policy to further protect human life; should be priority to value EVERY human life with dignity.

My mother said when spanking me "one day u will thank me for this!"  So THANKS!  Wish u were here to see your great grandkids! Happy MD
@foxandfriends will interrupt regular programs for me to do poetry at 7am ET today. Large crowd gathering outside studios to applaud.
Mother's Day morning I'll be on @foxandfriends at 7am ET; Your mother had rather watch ME than getting candy, flowers, cards, or lunch.
Daughter @SHSanders45 was prepared for WH press corps; she has 3 pre-schoolers and used to dealing with the same questions over and over.
Doing White House press briefing for @realDonaldTrump is like wearing Lady Gaga meat dress in zoo cage with lions. https://t.co/0ktEh28hRX
CNN wants me 2 talk @realDonaldTrump "2 Scoop Scandal" they say merits impeachment-I say only if Donna Brazile gets me questions in advance.
CNN breaking news! @realDonaldTrump Twitter account responsible for ransonware meltdown in 99 countries effecting millions.
If AG and Dep AG had advised @POTUS to KEEP Comey and he stayed, would Dems be saying, "Bravo!  We love us some Comey!"?  You tell me!
My friend @RichardGrenell needs to have key role in State Dept. He knows that DC isn't only swamp.  They are all over the world.
RT @RichardGrenell: We must have Ambassadors who don't ridicule Evangelical Christians &amp; who commit to defend Americans overseas who aren't…
I'm not in his corner but Kudos to Comey for classy comments on getting canned. https://t.co/u32yIMCRY0
Headed to D.C.--hoping my shots are up to date to protect against Beltway Bubble Fever causing Trump Derangement Syndrome or TDS.
Best part of daughter Sarah at WH press brief? Mentioning my granddaughter Scarlett's 5th birthday today. The rest was great too of course!
Anderson Cooper:see eye DR immediately! Ur eyes rolling back during intvu of WH official-no REAL journalist would roll eyes; much be medical
CNN now stands for Cardiac Care Network because their ppl are having heart attacks over Trump doing what Dems once demanded-fire Comey.
Media is melting down like a snowball in hell-are these the same media folks who called for Comey's head when they thought he hurt Hillary?
POTUS TO COMEY: "You're fired". Comey went from cleaning up his testimony to cleaning out his desk. Whew, busy day!
As I predicted-liberals who hated Comey now crying more about firing than southerners did when Elvis died-they hate DT more than love Comey
@realDonaldTrump actually said to Comey "Don't let the door hit you where the Good Lord split you!"  Or something like that.
Comey's fired, which means Trump must be one of the few people in DC that the FBI doesn't have something on.
Watch liberals who scalded Comey now try to pretend they support him and attack @realDonaldTrump. He needed to go.
Will Hillary praise firing of Comey since she blames him for her defeat? He had lost confidence of rank and file FBI.
Love @Clear at LGA.  Long TSA pre-check line but CLEAR took 30 seconds. Great service!
Bumped into My favorite weathercaster Janice Dean the Weather Machine at Fox. It's her birthday!  She is sunshine when there isn't any! https://t.co/Gj05c4AoSj

Why not focus on cures? Money is in treatment so change the model! Give large prizes for cures to incentivize cure. Save lives and suffering
Road test health plans in select states before imposing on all 50. Any plan needs clinical trials not assumptions.
Both parties say they can offer more health care for less $ but that's ballon juice. Decide if important as roads or water and pay for it.
There's not HEALTH CARE crisis; it's HEALTH crisis and chronic disease is 80%of cost-need focus on prevention and cures-not just treatment

Oscar Mayer rolls out new weenie-all pork called the GOP. Artificial taste and ingredients. Lose weight--Makes you sick if you eat it.
Please tell GOP leaders that we WON the election? Can't take YES for an answer and let Pelosi and Schumer create a budget buffet for Dems.
If the GOP Congress can't even stop Planned Barrenhood funding, then they are as worthless as a milk bucket under a bull. #whiteflagcaucus
GOP has WH, Senate,House and pass budget bill that makes Dems dance; no wall, less for security, more pork. As said in AR, "GO HOGS!" Sad.

For 8 yrs, WH Corresp Dinner gave POTUS tongue bath; @realDonaldTrump knows they will bite him w/ sharp teeth and so stays away-smart!

Execution concludes due process of law for guilty involving all 3 branches of govt.  abortion has no due process for innocent victims
AR didn't rush execution-crime happened in 1993. Inmate had yrs of appeals and pleadings.  Victim had none. Awful all around.
Thoughts are w/ Gov Hutchinson and family of victims. Easy to have feelings about execution unless you have to carry it out.
AR execution last night brings back memories of nearly 11 yrs as Gov and dealing with many times. Only irrevocable decision a Gov makes.

@Delta called and bags found and hope to deliver by midnight; I think it was pictures of my bags on milk carton that did it. Whew!
Feeling better about finding my lost bags from @Delta; Found at Reagan Nat'l; will get them in time for @realDonaldTrump 2nd term inaugural
Hillary Clinton called.  Said @Delta didn't lose my bags.  She just saw them in the woods near her house.
Susan Rice just called.  Said @Delta lost my bags and canceled me on 5 flights due to a You Tube video.
Yes, I'm having fun @Delta expense tonight. (Therapeutic for me). I stopped watching the clock for my bags; I'm looking at a calendar now.
@Delta has my razor. By time my lost bags come, I'll have a Duck Dynasty beard and be on Medicare.
@Delta has some great ppl, but their computer system has gone nuttier than Hal the computer from film 2001 A Space Odyssey.
Amelia Earhart/Jimmy Hoffa disappearances solved! @Delta had them in their lost baggage department the whole time!
I said @Delta taking better of my bags than me;Wrong!They lost bags too. Had @Delta delivered Tomahawk missiles, they would have hit Wichita
@KonradWilder @Delta I do. Even on 2 week intl trips.  But today is as messed up as a Maxine Waters speech
@KonradWilder @Delta Weather I get.  Flights delayed and canceled I get. This is not that.  This is their less than able computer algorithms in Flintstone mode
If u don't have to fly somewhere today don't.  @Delta normally stellar but my bags are getting better treatment today #deltameltdown
@POTUS order to pound Syrian air base with Tomahawk missiles due to use of chemical weapons on babies sends strong message to entire world.
Schumer says less faith in SCOTUS in future. Why? When we questioned past SCOTUS decisions Dems said we can't 2nd guess sacred court!
@boswell_allison Agree. Or gate agents.  They don't create the weather.  Ruins their day too. Good reminder Allison!  @Delta folks have been great today.
Hope ur not flying today. Orlando and ATL are a goat rodeo-backed up like a truck stop toilet! Weather related so no ones fault-just a mess

@AmericanAir Doesn't cost @AmericanAir extra to simply tell passengers what is happening in timely fashion. Especially when gate screen doesn't work
@AmericanAir Thnx for ur response. Agents at B4 and B5 must have had quart of vinegar at start of shift. Unfriendly service ruins rest of trip
