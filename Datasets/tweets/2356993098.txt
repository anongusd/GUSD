I am convinced @realDonaldTrump will be re-elected as USPresident in 2020. His accomplishments are mind boggling. Liberals began discussing impeachment before he was even sworn in &amp; its been one witch hunt after another; absolute craziness!#TRUMP2020 #MAGA #BestPresidentEver ❤️🇺🇸

So when @POTUS reiterates the same EXACT statement as Barrack Obama, Hillary Clinton and many other political representatives; he is the devil.  Double standard for sure.  Just build the wall and implement fair and reasonable immigration laws.  🇺🇸❤️ It's not that hard. https://t.co/jk4BsmiZhw
Sorry, but so funny! haha https://t.co/Fdb40kayYj
This is awesome!! https://t.co/wFYTfY5c2H
Boy I need a break from all the nasty politics.  Exhausting.  It never ends; on both sides!🙄
Thank you @PressSec.  Long overdue!  Woot woot! 😊 https://t.co/58ZUrKkWyp
@Acosta Pull yourself together Jim.  It's a privilege to have a White House Press Pass, not a right.  And keep your hands to yourself!
@DanRather @Acosta Come on @DanRather; he refused to give up the mic and pushed away a female intern.  No matter how bad you want to ask your question, don't touch anyone and use professional decorum as a press agent!
First time for me' truly disappointed with #foxnews.  That's the only big shocker for me tonight. 😑
When the blue wave, hits the RED WALL.  Yah baby. #MAGA ❤️🦅🇺🇸🗳️❤️
Do not believe polls 🗳️ They are skewed, bias and not based in reality.  How quickly we forget the supposed "polls" predicted Hillary Clinton was going to be the next US President and we know how that turned out.  Just do your thing. Follow you heart ❤️Vote your conscience 🇺🇸🦅 https://t.co/x4kc022tsD
Excellent Point! https://t.co/k7jNMIeQr3
President Donald Trump added his signature to the “Save Our Seas Act” on 10/11/18, green-lighting an initiative to clean up eight million tons of debris from the planet’s oceans.  The man never stops!
@supitsshekinah So smart and quick on your feet.  I like you @supitsshekinah ! 😊

I do not like the news media; never have. Sorry, but not sorry. I have felt this way for decades, regardless who has been our U.S. President. Thank you Sarah for not backing down to CNN, Jim Acousta's bullying.  Well done Ms. @PressSec https://t.co/AaFOJCjo0C

Fun non-Political tweet.  Smile people!  #lovemydentist https://t.co/plwiQVhKrC
Here is a perfect example why I get so frustrated at corrupt #fakenews &amp; the far left liberals. We have 2 Presidents discussing the same federal regulation, same exact situation, but @POTUS's statement is applied differently to the same exact standard. #doublestandard #unfair 🧐 https://t.co/DITA1MkRzO
@RealJamesWoods @BillClinton Oh but yes, I had forgotten all about this.  Thanks for the reminder!!
