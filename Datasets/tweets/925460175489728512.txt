The power must be spread in order for us to remain united
A judicial system cannot exist without normal, standard democracy without representation
Instead of doing what is merely necessary to keep others safe
What are we to do when our voice of reason's main goal becomes to punish for the sake of money?
we do not have a proper judicial system
We need to stop being afraid to use the death penalty on people who have taken other lives, but we also need to learn that violence creates more violence. Until that lesson is learned - that the goal is to prevent crime, not punish for punishment sake it is my belief that

@BillGates Tests/HWs available day 1, you can attend classes/read as is required for you to get the necessary grade
@BillGates Giving those students the option to graduate and begin practicing immediately seems like a giant gap in our education system
@BillGates Tests shouldn't be deadlines they should be made available as soon as possible, I've known of students that have taken precalc 1 and 2 at the same time during the summer; and I can't think of one profession that means more than medical practitioners
@BillGates It does not make sense to make nursing/medical students to have to wait x amount of days for the next test when we need them yesterday
@BillGates Allowing for the more studious individuals to take the exams, pass/get an A and move on to the next course quicker
@BillGates Tests should be available online or in paper format the second students begin a course
@BillGates We need more nurses and doctors on this planet - if anyone could promote standardized testing being available sooner (ie a nursing degree doesn't have to take 2/4 years and a doctorate doesn't necessarily have to take 8 years) I'm pretty sure you're one of those people.
If open book and/or computerized testing is the problem then might I suggest 3 things - tests are taken in the library or computer lab under supervision. We already take tests online anyway and many of them are open book
It does not make sense to make students wait for a specific day to take tests especially for certain degrees where we need them yesterday
Standardized testing needs to be available the very moment students enter school - nurses and doctors as well as the other degree programs are crucial to our county, and our ecosystem

giant loans in order to get the education we believe we need. The world is a weird, strange, messed up place
It's absolutely retarded, we go to college and PAY OTHER PEOPLE MONEY to TEACH US HOW TO BE GOOD EMPLOYEES(SLAVES) and we never DEMAND that classes teach us to work for ourselves when our parents are paying out their hard-earned money for us to learn or we're taking out
And if you're lucky you get to bring home a slightly bigger sliver of the money you're putting into the bosses bank account. Making money is HARD in real life BOTH intellectually AND physically.
