If that's the case, then the 2016 Trump campaign and administration's public basis for not releasing his returns has been -- and i'll say it -- a lie.		From Trump to Sarah Sanders to many others, that'd mean they've been giving a false excuse to the American public.
A note re: Trump's taxes:		Cohen said yesterday that he repeatedly asked for -- but never received -- audit documents in 2016 to help prepare his statements to the press on why Trump wouldn't release his tax returns.		"I presume that he is not under audit," Cohen testified.

I don’t mean to throw my high school under the bus. Richard Chambers, my US history teacher—and all the other teachers at the school—were kind-hearted, open-minded. Chambers did not whitewash the dark spots of US history.
No, I wasn’t openly (or privately, for that matter) hostile to people who didn’t look and think like me.		I can, tho, see how that upbringing/culture, combined with heightened political tribalism, could lead to what happened with the Covington Catholic students.
But a severe lack of exposure to people from different backgrounds undeniably set me back a couple years in terms of maturity and sensitivity.
That’s not to say we don’t grow, mature, and that there weren’t tons of redeeming qualities about both schools. (My school’s theology faculty was extremely open-minded; teachers brought in rabbis multiple times for Q&amp;As, &amp; courses explored non-Christian religions in depth.)

Smith's communications director explained the congressman's shouted comment on the House floor today thusly.		Given the context outlined in the previous two tweets, that explanation seemed plausible to me.
Democrats in the group were accused of "vacationing" in Puerto Rico after Sen. Bob Menendez was pictured in a bathing suit on the beach. Smith very conceivably could have been chiding Cardenas for taking what he perceived to be a nice "vacation" on the beaches of Puerto Rico.
Why I didn't write that Jason Smith's "Go back to Puerto Rico!" comment was explicitly "racist":		Cardenas (target of the comment) was, literally, in PR last weekend w Dem lawmakers — a trip that conservative media glommed onto to argue Dems don't care about ending the shutdown.

@mcbyrne @rollcall Look, I don't care about the outcome of this thing, if it gets Moulton in trouble in his district, etc. But there is nothing in Moulton's record to suggest this is an anti-woman crusade. Or if there is, I haven't seen it.
Seth Moulton has been calling for leadership change for two years, has fixed his messaging on catering to/representing the next generation; wants a woman to succeed Pelosi.		This has nothing to do w Pelosi being a woman, everything to do with Pelosi being leader for 16 years.

@AlexLeich I mean, would you prefer a free-for-all on BRI with the minimum contract for players around what it is now? So that LeBron is paid commensurate with his value? (LeBron obvi is an avatar here for high-revenue producing players.)		Or players with a majority of ownership?
https://t.co/xH0JuvIaJn
@dangercart @ResIpsaLocutus @SamSheehan One thing I like about the C Hub team is how curious and deep-thinking it is about things outside baskethoops. Seems uncommon for a sports blog.
@AlexLeich That’s not how the NBA works. Owners are given 50% to divide up, players 50% to divide up.		So the millions being saved from LeBron, Giannis, etc. are going to guys like Kentavius Caldwell-Pope, Brook Lopez, and Julius Randle.		If there wasn’t a CBA...
@AlexLeich In that system, it just seems like a pay floor (necessary to ensure livable wage) w/out the pay cap would artificially deflate the compensation of lower- (but not lowest) and middle-tier workers.		When, equitably, it’d make more sense to install a pay cap to divert from top dogs.
@dangercart @ResIpsaLocutus So it’s a realist mechanism, even though it’s not ideologically pure.
@ResIpsaLocutus ... not an individual pay cap (within that bank of money that goes to the players)?		So theoretically a “max contract” = [player money pool] - [minimum contract X 14], since there are 15 roster spots on teams.		LeBron could probably fetch that. And that’s OK?
@ResIpsaLocutus OK, this actually helps me reframe the question.		The NBA splits basketball-related income 50-50 between 1) ownership/operations/front office/etc and 2) the players.		Is the argument that of that pool of money, there should be a pay floor for lower-tier players, but...
@AlexLeich ... how the NBA works with the BRI 50-50 split, but let’s pretend we’re in a world where the BRI isn’t split 50-50 w the players.)
@AlexLeich Based on subsequent tweets I’ve seen, seems like the point is that there shouldn’t necessarily be a cap on wages — but wages should be commensurate w output. Safe to say it’s OK for a team to curtail LeBron’s contract so it can pay its custodial staff more? (I know this isn’t...
@AlexLeich A third counterpoint is that LeBron, CP3, et. al., already make way more than most front office execs.
@AlexLeich 1) You wouldn’t consider LeBron, Steph, etc. executive decision-makers for their respective teams?		Regardless,		2) CEOs are technically employees, too (unless they’re also owners) — they just tend to be paid more because they have more complex skill sets and responsibility.

Now onto the courts... https://t.co/YT5oPNQKOr

I’ll be on @fox5dc at 6:30 tonight talking latest on Rod Rosenstein &amp; why he still faces a grilling in Congress no matter what Trump decides
House Judiciary Chairman @RepGoodlatte issues a subpoena for McCabe memos that detail meetings where Rosenstein allegedly floated recording Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment (which others have reportedly said was a joke).
3. He has denounced his father, who was an official with the Palestinian National Authority, and his grandfather, who was the mastermind behind the 1972 Munich Hostage Crisis where 11 Israelis were killed.
1. Campa-Najjar was raised by his single Mexican-American mother.		2. He worked at Obama's Department of Labor, where he obtained a security clearance from the federal government after extensive background checks.

But jury found that Manafort directed disbursements and was the beneficiary of money in those accounts.
@steven69178886 @cspanwj @rollcall The tax evasion charges are kind of redundant. Basically, 1) he controlled 31 foreign bank accounts during the 5-year period from 2010-2014, 2) concealed those accounts from his bookkeeper/tax preparer, and 3) he claimed on his tax docs he did not have any foreign accounts.

Manafort is staring down the barrel of a maximum 80-year prison sentence.		Math check:		(5 tax fraud charges x 3 years/charge = 15 years) PLUS (1 FBAR charge x 5 years/charge = 5 years) PLUS (2 bank loan fraud charges x 30 years/charge = 60 years) = 80 years
Mistrial on 10 other charges, including some FBAR filings, some bank loan frauds, and ALL bank loan fraud conspiracies.		Prosecutors have until next Wednesday to announce their intention to re-try Manafort or drop the hung charges.
Paul Manafort found guilty on 8 charges from three of the four categories (false tax returns, failing to file FBAR, bank loan fraud) https://t.co/Dx3kF0OvGR

4) Can the exhibit list include a key so we can match indictment charges to evidence?		Answer from Ellis: Nope. You need to rely on your "collective recollection" of the evidence/testimony.
3) Can ya redefine "reasonable doubt"?		Remember, it's on *prosecutors* to prove Manafort's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.		Judge told jury that the gov't need NOT prove beyond "all POSSIBLE doubt." (Since reality's subjective, nothing's definitively provable. I digress...)
2) Can ya define a "shelf company"?		"Shelf company" is a term Rick Gates used in his testimony to describe bank accounts Cypriot lawyer "Dr. K" set up in 2007 that would leave no paper trail tying Manafort to them, even though Manafort had de facto control over the accounts.
1) Is buddy req'd to file an FBAR if he owns &lt;50% of an account, doesn't have sig. authority, but is one directing disbursements?		This question doesn't matter/make sense in the Manafort case, imo. But Ellis re-read FBAR filing requirements for them anyway.
No word from Manafort jury on verdict. Instead, they asked 4 questions for clarity. I broke it down in detail here: https://t.co/43i0lQdyCU		But here's (👇👇👇) the gist of what they asked (THREADLET)

@NickEh30 Clip beginning at 3:09 is perfect. Just make sure not to overdo the editing/cutting. We want to see the gameplay and buildup to big plays.
Not to mention they think Manafort and Calk pressured them into criminal activity (both employees, James Brennan and Dennis Raico, testified under immunity).

What happened Friday at the Paul Manafort trial and what it means...		https://t.co/W8EvG2wk50
During his cross-examination from the defense, Raico was on guard. He appeared pissed that he would have to say things that would be molded to help the defense's case (which, of course, is the point of cross-examination for the defense).
Putting on my Body Language Doctor hat:		Dennis Raico, the Federal Savings Bank executive who testified against Manafort today, seemed repulsed by Manafort.		At times he looked shocked he actually had to spell out Manafort's alleged transgressions. To him, they were clear as day.
The point was to add yet another layer to Manafort's *corrupt intent*.		Essentially, they wanted to show jurors that Manafort wasn't above handing out political favors in exchange for $$$ — even if, as Raico admitted, he had no "concrete evidence" to prove it in court.
Big takeaway from the Steve Calk/Manafort quid pro quo debate after talking to some experts:		The prosecution did not ~prove~ a deal existed. BUT... through witness Dennis Raico's testimony, they provided a mountain of circumstantial evidence that suggests such a deal. (1/2)

Washkuhn testified yesterday that she understood "he" to mean Manafort. https://t.co/0Px2DtGwUe
@NNJ_Taxman His bookkeeper testified yesterday that they did not operate on an accrual basis; they did cash only. So she couldn’t comply w his request.

Judge T.S. Ellis notes to prosecution: "It is no crime" to make lots of money &amp; be "profligate" with your wealth.		Important comment to remember b/c:	- Manafort defense wants Ellis to bar evidence exhibits showing things such as Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket and seven homes.
@colepick Happened.
To save Paul Manafort from imprisonment for the rest of his life, the defense is arguing two things: 1) Manafort was totally ignorant of his own personal finances. 2) It was all Rick Gates' fault.
One defining characteristic of the Paul Manafort trial will be the epic display of back-stabbing between two longtime colleagues and friends. Manafort's defense: "We're primarily here because of one man: that man is Rick Gates."
His hair was noticeably greyer on the sides and back of his head.		Months in jail and waking up at 5 a.m. everyday takes its toll.

Gowdy ignites the flamethrower at the end of his questioning of Strzok:		"I don't give a damn what you appreciate, Agent Strzok. I don't appreciate having an FBI agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations in 2016."
Shades of Bill Clinton here at the Strzok hearing ("It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is.")		Gowdy: "What and who did you mean by 'it'?" in the text message from Strzok to Lisa Page, "we'll stop it," referring to a Trump presidency.
Chairman Goodlatte just tried to disallow Strzok from consulting with the FBI counsel to ask if he was allowed to answer... wait for it... the very first question Trey Gowdy asked him.
Nadler: "This demand puts Mr. Strzok in an impossible position. He is still an employee of the FBI, and the FBI's counsel has instructed him not to answer the question. If you have a problem with this policy, you should take it up with the FBI — not badger Mr. Strzok."

It's the way to reach out, to show you're interested. Is it incredibly disingenuous? Umm, yeah. And we know this. We know we're not fooling you, either.		It's the 21st-century equivalent of hanging outside the office &amp; waiting for the editor &amp; asking if you can be a letterboy.
AND, you think we're clueless enough to believe we're tricking you with our forced cordiality?		No. But this is what all our professors, bosses, parents, mentors, rich friends' super-successful business-mom-and-dads have told us to do.
I'm sure it can be irritating to get multiple of those kinds of networking requests per day.		But your irritation is probably 0.00007% of the pressure/stress/fear of not finding a job that prompts young'uns to send these emails.
Something like, "Sure, 20-year-old with no experience, I'd love to meet you for coffee, answer your totally enthralling questions, and give you that job you're implicitly asking for."
They'll tweet out a screenshot of the subject line ("Meet For Coffee?" etc.) and the opening sentence or two (and are usually courteous enough to redact the name).		Then they'll follow it up with a condescending (and equally unoriginal, actually) quip about overeager millennials.
[Short thread alert]		For some reason, I've recently seen a lot of older journalists dumping on young aspirants for cheesy networking emails		I find that... so incredibly smug and unsympathetic.

@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk There are obvious diminishing returns on an elite ISO player in an NBA where teams are allowed to zone up on D. Different than the 80s/90s.
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk I never said that...
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk Westbrook averaged a triple double, and his team flunked. What's your point?
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk Look Kobe was dope, was the epitome of sustained excellence--but so many guys have more versatile skill sets now. He bridged two eras.
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk Yeah and he was the "#1 all star" on a well-rounded team that bowed out in the second round of a shit conference...
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk Now if Kobe evolutionized his game to fit today's standards and maximized those skills? Yeah, he could maybe approx the value he had
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk The way the game is played today, I'd pick eight guys currently over him
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk I mean depends on the era. If we're playing ISO post-up ball, Kobe=super valuable. Today? Pass.
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk Yah I agree w that. Those guys as they were would be maybe midmajor players.
@_mcnoche @_Rashaanpb @Lakeshowtalk "Fringe." Name em, you scariedy guy
@_Rashaanpb @_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk @ LilSquirtBuddy
@_mcnoche @Lakeshowtalk @_Rashaanpb Dude Arron afflalo works so hard...
@ThomasGriffin55 I wouldn't call this benign, although *****whispers***** I agree
@AndOneBball I tend to discount guys from before the 80s; not enough film, the league was small (&amp; white), &amp; players didn't have advantages they do today
@AndOneBball Truthfully? I don't know. Bill Simmons makes as good a case as any in his book for Russell. But I honestly don't know.

@Jim_Eichenhofer I'll sign off with this: The Pels will be one of the most fascinating teams to watch as the year develops––hands down. Thanks for engaging.
@Jim_Eichenhofer I like the signing! Just don't see him as an integral piece of the puzzle for finishing games is all. Hope Gentry doesn't miscast him.
@AndOneBball Wildly overrated by many. Wildly underrated by some. He's somewhere in the Top 20 of guys I'd want to build a franchise around.
@Jim_Eichenhofer I see. Counter: Guy got benched in 4Q multiple Xs in SAC and CHI for defensive liabilities and not being able to chuck from deep.
@AndOneBball Passionately? No. I'd maybe punt Bird out of the Top 10 for Steph Curry. If not now, check back with me five years from now. Same w/ Durant.

@stevie_stej If you're talking about something petty, like Draymond Green complaining about a call, go with "hung up on." That's a big one.
@mozgov_ed16 Ainge probably thinks he can develop into something more than Harrison Barnes––and maybe he will, so, no, I don't think Ainge did that.
@jacksobd Is that a "you're wrong" GTFOH or a "I really don't want you to be right but fear you might be" GTFOH?
Just realized who Jayson Tatum is. He's Harrison Barnes. Which isn't a knock on Tatum at all if he develops more quickly than Barnes did.
