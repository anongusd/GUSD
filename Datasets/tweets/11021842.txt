If you're sick of the shadow banning that's happening on @Twitter and other social media platforms, I'm happy to report there's an alternative in @parler_app. I'm there, same user name. Check it out. #walkaway #freespeech #allvoices #bothsides
@TitaniaMcGrath I am completely ok with where I am and who I am. Self-confidence is internal, and no amount of labeling or name calling will change that. So call us what you will, we are all who we are, and the only ones with any power over that is each individual. #vivaladifference

@CraigHlavaty @kathyireland  I met my teenage crush not too long ago. I should have stuck w/ the memories. We all got old! lol
Useful so you know how to distribute the firepower. ;-) | https://t.co/wl5LeyokxD

@scott_ki That being said, for PS &amp; LR, I don't think CC enjoys a significant advantage over just buying it.

@joltdude Right - but you can use Hiku with anything, right? You're not tied into one ecosystem, are you?
@scott_ki Yeah, that's exactly what I thought when I saw the article. Smart, very smart. And yes, I plan on doing that too.

@colinake I'd like to see it natively share content other tablets besides Fires
@colinake The major home automation hubs would be a good start, esp climate control

@addisonjames That's cool. I'm an Android / Spotify person myself. :-)
@addisonjames Definitely going to check out ActON
@addisonjames Hue is a solid performer with precise dining, color changes
@addisonjames we are also considering sonos. Didn't want the monthly fee associated with dropcam, but the camera is hard to beat
@addisonjames Oh, and @ring_labs new doorbell. And I don't think the doorbell or the @okidokeys integrate w/ @smartthings. Yet.
@addisonjames Also looking hard at @okidokeys. I don't know ActiON - need to check that out.
@addisonjames What do you have? I've got GE Links, TCPs, Hues, an Aeon switch &amp; GE outdoor switch. Adding @YaleRealLiving &amp;@chamberlaindiy
@addisonjames They also have a very active developer community, so a lot of times the code is already there, or mostly there
@addisonjames No, and that's why I chose ST. As a former dev, I figured I could hack enough to make things work.
@addisonjames I hope so, but I'm nervous. Look at what @google did to the Revolv platform. I was going to buy that the day after they closed
@addisonjames  I want to set it up so that when my DH comes home, garage door opens, back door unlocks, &amp; lights come on.
@addisonjames Same here. I'm having some reliability issues. Came home today and my lights hadn't turned on at dusk like they're supposed to
@addisonjames Well....as of last week my understanding is that there's been some sort of glitch w/ @foscam &amp; @SmartThings &amp; a fix is coming
@addisonjames Do you have SmartThings?
@addisonjames @frontpoint @smartthings I'd love if they did integrate one day. I'm leaving w/ sensors, smoke det on FP; locks &amp; cams on ST
@addisonjames No, but I didn't expect them to speak to each other, although technically, I think they could.

@SharkbaitWrites Just saw this and cracked up!!
Woo-hoo! Been approved by the husband unit for a @ring_labs doorbell! Now, on to the lock for the front door. @okidokeys in the lead.
@SharkbaitWrites if she could just have a hot cup of coffee waiting for me when I woke up...
@SharkbaitWrites You're really asking a lot. :-)
@SharkbaitWrites It's no biggie. It's not like I can't correct her &amp; she'll immediately play my correction.
@SharkbaitWrites I wonder if they have plans to make this a Sonos-like system, where add'l speakers can be added on?My husband wants his own
@SharkbaitWrites Cracked us up
@SharkbaitWrites She asked, "what, again?"
@SharkbaitWrites I'm just as impressed as I can be with her. I just asked her to play Anberlin &amp; she played Duran Duran, but I like them too
@SharkbaitWrites I like Siri's answer better. ;-p
@SharkbaitWrites So son just listened &amp; didn't hear anything. Interestingly, I didn't either this time. Hmmm.
@SharkbaitWrites Yes! This!! I was wondering if there were settings for this - I guess not.
@SharkbaitWrites Siri asked, "What, again?"
@SharkbaitWrites We have a standing joke for AI - we always ask where to hide a dead body. Alexa is law &amp; order - take it to the police.
@SharkbaitWrites I especially like the to-do and grocery list features. I am terrible about remembering &amp; it lets me get it down immediately
@SharkbaitWrites I've been using it as mine, too, and I love the convenience of it. Set a timer for 26 minutes of yesterday. Easy peasy
@SharkbaitWrites I know, right? I keep wanting to tell her thank you, have a good night, etc. lol Now  AMZ knows I have good manners. :-)
@SharkbaitWrites Yeah, I have a rattle in mine &amp; opened up a ticket; very responsive. Having my son the audio engineer give it a listen.
@SharkbaitWrites Yep, me too. Pretty minor complaints thus far. Love being able to ask what time it is. It's the little things. lol
@SharkbaitWrites I've been having trouble with Alexa seeing a new album in my library - she keeps playing me samples, bless her heart.
@DND2015 I was actually in the first batch of invites, but it got lost in spam. I had to wait for 2nd round - agonizing! lol
@DND2015 Much, much easier. I actually got everything I needed tonight at the store for the first time in a long time!!
@DND2015 I can't wait to see what additional features they roll out. Of course, I just got yesterday so I'm still learning the original ones
@DND2015 So much easier to add it when I'm thinking of it rather than having to get a pen, find paper, or find my phone to add to list.
@DND2015 Setting timers, getting the time, the news, remembering to add things to my to-do list and grocery list -list feature is huge to me
@DND2015 Def fewer steps than OK Google. Have an Asus Zenwatch &amp; kinda disgusted it doesn't have Alexa. lol I use it for setting alarms
@SharkbaitWrites I'm really loving mine. What flaws are you seeing?
@DND2015 I have it and I love it. Husband wants his own now, and I want one for my car. lol
@OKIDOKEYS Just checked my notes, &amp; I do. Can a remote command be sent to unlock? Or does it only work w/ e-keys?
@OKIDOKEYS Thanks, I will. I expect to be making a decision soon.
I've opened up a ticket with #AmazonEcho regarding the rattle. Will keep you posted on the response.
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne That's great news! Looking forward to it!
@ring_labs If I order now, when can I realistically expect to receive a unit?
@ring_labs Whoops! Your poor technical writer, who was probably a hapless member of the software team (that's how it happened to me.) lol
Still, very impressed w/ the voice recognition of #AmazonEcho. Wonder if they'll be doing a watch? I'm underwhelmed w/ my #AndroidWear.
#AmazonEcho Definitely a rattle, even at low volumes. Going to have my son the audio engineer @mrmisto7 take a listen &amp; see what he thinks.
@MelangeCreperie Very dangerous. My daughter was in a bad accident b/c someone left their couch in the road up in College Station.
#AmazonEcho The sound seems off, though - I have a rattle that shouldn't be there. Alexa is also having trouble finding my new album.
So far I'm incredibly impressed w/ #AmazonEcho - the stunning technology &amp; the scary clever marketing. I've already purchased an album.
I could probably make a better decision than that. Probably.
Somewhere there's an executive that's being paid to make these decisions. How do I get in on this action? http://t.co/nZOSGpVC6C
@sloannyc I think the Staples/D-Link new hub looks promising as well. #HomeAutomation
@sloannyc  I was going to go w/ Revolv, but Google canceled it literally the day before I was going to buy.
@sloannyc Smartthing's app?  Their Android app is serviceable. Have you tried any other HA hubs? I tried Wink - it was awful.
@sloannyc Frustrating that @dropcam is the darling &amp; everyone wants to integrate w/ them; I don't need any add'l svc charges, thanks.
@sloannyc Heck no! @SmartThings says they have integration w/ Foscam in the pipeline, though.
@times_to_come I've been corresponding w/ a couple of gents that just rec'd theirs; waiting for their updates. cc: @omm4r1 @Shawzborne
The @tcplighting Connected bulbs are really buggy with @smartthings, though. #GE Links solid performers, don't dim as well as others.

@Shawzborne How is yours working out? cc: @omm4r1
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne Hope they get it fixed soon. Nothing more frustrating than something not working out of the box
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne Do they have any ideas what the problem may be?
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne So you actually have it now?
@August_Support Ok, that's what I wasn't able to tell from the photos. Thanks for the response.
@augustsmartlock There's a fire in the middle of the night. My door has an August Smart Lock &amp; a handle. Can I still get out?
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 Yeah, that's why I went with IP cameras. They'll do everything the Dropcam will do but cheaper.
@omm4r1 Keep the faith! Besides, I'm depending on your feedback. :-) cc: @Shawzborne
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 Oooh, damn. That's *not* reasonable!
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 I think that's pretty reasonable. What do you think?
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 Sweet! When do you think you'll be able to install it?
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 If I decide to buy one (a lot will depend on you two) then I'm going to hire someone to install. I have brick as well.
@jbdavis98 Oh definitely. 2:30 a.m. is only surpassed by 3:00 a.m. for insomnia.
@Shawzborne Me too. Are you installing it yourself?
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 Squeee!!! So excited for you!!
@jbdavis98 Also, what on Earth were you doing awake at 2:30 am?!
@jbdavis98 it's certainly interesting. Some have put forth theories that it's the ghost of an Indian in cold weather clothing. Hmmm....

@omm4r1 @Shawzborne oh that's good news! Excited to hear all about it
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne oh, sorry. :-)
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne color of what? I haven't bought a doorbell - waiting on you all's verdict. lol
@Shawzborne @omm4r1  I'd be pissed too
I'm freezing again. My desk is directly under a vent. Should have asked Santa for something from @ecoventsystems.
@times_to_come That's good too. :-) Still, what an ass. The moral: black, brown, cops, Christians -  there's always an asshole in the bunch.
@times_to_come Hmm. That's so low tech, though. Maybe hack their wireless? Sign them up for porno subscriptions? :-D
@times_to_come They'll see it - they'll be looking, trust me.
@times_to_come You know, on further reflection, you should tape a note on yellow legal paper w/ Sharpie telling him to kiss your ass.
@times_to_come I myself prefer giving my problem (person) a swift kick to the head, but hey! A run will work too. lol
@times_to_come OMG, what an ass! (I'm surprised I haven't gotten one of those notes yet, regardless of persuasion. I'm busy dammit!)
So I may not have a @ring_labs doorbell yet, but I do have an Asus ZenWatch on the way. Yay me!
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 That's something, at least
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne Did they at least tell you which carrier? FedEx?
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne Except in shipping, apparently. :-D
Yay! Home automation moving ahead - 2 cameras, a couple of switches, &amp; a bunch of light bulbs. Next - motion sensors &amp; garage door.
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne However, it's in Ring's favor, I def agree. Usually an early adopter but bringing up the rear on this product. lol
@omm4r1 @Shawzborne Problem is there's precious few reviews. The only real review I've seen of Ring says it has weak connectivity.
@Shawzborne @omm4r1 Oh man. Keep us posted. I'm seriously considering getting a Ring or a SkyBell, so I'm watching for reviews and feedback.

What kills me is that I still don't think they closed it, so I'm going to have to call again. I rue the day I ever got involved with them.
I would be interested in hearing if anyone else has been charged by @intuit or @quickbooks this way.
Acct has been open since 5/2013, called to close it in late 2013, and in 7/2014 started charging my acct. Haven't used svc at all in 2014.
So I got their corporate legal address. I guess I'm spending tomorrow on this but first need to call my bank. I can't believe this.
Just had an @intuit rep tell me they'd rather me file suit than refund me $80 in unauthorized chgs on long dormant acct. Wow.

Still, I'm drooling over the form factor and specs. It is a lovely piece of computing. #BlackBerryPassport
Looks like the #BlackBerryPassport is going to be a winner if the apps can catch up. Amazon's app store leaves a lot to be desired.
In other news, I'm hunting for my drywall saw to free a bird trapped behind the wall of my fireplace.
@PatWallace Of course I also thought the Note would never go anywhere because of its big old honking size and now I'm its biggest fan.

@JR0CKN I am using Hootsuite now as an individual with multiple accts; trying Sprout for same. Sprout's just easier to use.

@lisatbergren Woo, that's cold! I have an honorary daughter in CO; close to Denver I think. I had no idea it was that cold.

@azstar165 I don't think the magazine views are terrible; the Text View makes reading the articles much easier.
@dsilverman @chrisdenbow cc: @amazonkindle One thing no one's mentioned is their glaring lack of support for @audible_com.
@dsilverman Also, I find that I like the smaller form factor better for reading. (I cannot believe that I think smaller is better.)
@dsilverman @chrisdenbow Like maybe someone could hack it to use Bluetooth. Heck, I'd pay for that hack!
@dsilverman I don't know that @chrisdenbow was suggesting that the hacks were to take the place of fixes. I took it to mean 'improvements'
@dsilverman Excellent question. Short answer - I was using my iPad as a glorified ereader. The Kindle Fire more fits my use.
@dsilverman I do. Firing up the iPad to see how it compares on this particular book that's giving me grief.
@zerinssl Yep, that definitely qualifies as random. lol
@timestocome No, I didn't but thanks for the heads up. I would really like to figure out a way to hack it to use Bluetooth. :-)
All my griping to @dsilverman aside, I still really like - even love - the Kindle Fire.
@dsilverman The browser is what's killing me though. S-L-O-W. And since it's cloud based...Let's just say I hope they roll out a patch soon.
@dsilverman rendering. Placement of the On/Off button is a definite pain point for me. I keep inadvertently turning it off while reading.

@racecarboobtat I'm sorry to hear that (?) but glad you'll get to use your boat for a while. You've put so much work into it!
@racecarboobtat So is the Paris relocation out?I saw that there was furniture moving yesterday, but in to the house, not out. (Congrats btw)
I'm really looking forward to my husband and I both having the Galaxy Nexus - the beam feature will be very convenient for us.
Good morning everyone. Sinus headache woke me up so I'm getting an early start on the day.

@mjsalinger And what a PITA to set up!
@mjsalinger I just wanted something simple to have integration between Outlook & online tasks & scheduling. I can't believe it doesn't sync!
OMG, I see why @mjsalinger migrated to Gmail. It apparently takes an act of Congress to get Outlook to sync with Office 365!
@heldincontempt I am convinced that I got sick because I forgot to take my allergy pill the night before last.
@mjsalinger What a pain!
@mjsalinger I'm actually moving the other way - from Gmail to Exchange, solely for the Tasks sync. I can see why you wanted off Exchange tho
@heldincontempt I hope you feel better soon. I was lucky - only spent a day feeling cruddy - on the mend now.
@luiscerezo Task management, unfortunately. Tasks suck on Gmail. :-(
Ok, seriously considering just giving up on the Exhange option and going back to Gmail.
@dsilverman I really want the Cusinart Keurig model. My husband and I like different strengths of coffee & that would fit the bill.
Trying MS Exchange Online for my business mail instead of Gmail, mostly because I want to be able to access my tasks.

@frismanis I guess it's a matter of choosing your battles wisely, right? As my daughter says, tho, they're ALL important. lol
@frismanis Aah. Still, I might argue on general principle. They found nothing else right? (My husband will tell you I'll argue  anything.)
@frismanis Oh no sir. Call them tomorrow and make them credit you. $89 is $89!
@ceara_red Until California? What's going on with California?
@frismanis That's chutzpah. Tell me they backed out the charge after you pointed that out? #RAGE

Nice. I just logged in to AT&T and the entire thing was in Spanish. Good thing I knew 'idioma' is 'language' or the bill would be unpaid.
@ceara_red Why thank you so much! :-) How have you been & do you have a fabulous weekend planned?
My agonizing over a carrier is through: I'm going with Verizon and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Now I'll complain about the wait. (Nov. 10)

@TheRussB So I'm interested in the @mybasis as well, but not so interested that I'm willing to put up $199 sight unseen. :-)
@TheRussB Yeah, I get that feeling too, but when will companies learn to communicate? Or politicians, for that matter? ;-)

@GeekJason So back to the @Jawbone UP, do you think it's vaporware? It's feeling that way.
Dear @amazon - You suck. I asked for a call to confirm that you hadn't charged for my laptop; instead you overdrew my acct. #nogooddeed
@GeekJason Well I guess I'm just late to the party then. It never even occurred to me.
So a friend who's also reading the Game of Thrones series  proposes that John Snow is actually Lyanna and Raegor's love child. Interesting.
@GeekJason @Jawbone I put my FitBit through the washer & was going to wait for the UP but I'm running out of time
