@Hipstamatic I am unable to purchase the cubism snap pack. It says ‚Äòproduct not available.‚Äô Any ideas?
@meganmorrone It appears the latest accuweather update fixed the complication! I tried today and it‚Äôs working. ü§ûüèº
@AronDraws Kinda sounded like it!
@HeinzKetchup_US Sounds tasty! I already do this in my own!!
@Willowbottom You have got to be kidding me??!
@spontanuous Hopefully yours came back on as quickly as ours did!
Or now! Thank goodness!
It says 4-6 hours on their hotline. https://t.co/YKRbOEp9p3
@jennyemett @RealRonHoward It looks pretty good!
@ThrifterDaily Love the deals! I got a mattress pad that is great thanks to your email! Keep up the good work!
@jennyemett Interesting. I was going to get one for my spare 6+. Guess I‚Äôll be waiting.
Anyone else notice that they didn‚Äôt get their December Apple Watch Activity goal even though it said completed? #workedhardwantmybadge

@matt_is_offside LOL even when she has Internet, w/the lack of speed, I usually turn wifi off at her house. It‚Äôs been 9 days now and nada.
@matt_is_offside That would be fantastic! Do you at least have service right now? She‚Äôs down and is usually down at least 1 week/month.
@matt_is_offside I think she‚Äôll get Xfinity. It‚Äôs less than she‚Äôs paying now. Her down right now is maybe 2mbps. She‚Äôll get up to 100!
@matt_is_offside I am sure they‚Äôre fine, at least in our area, they dumped their junk. I feel sorry for Frontier. We‚Äôre switching ASAP.

@Manu3lM we have Hulu+. We watch it on our AppleTV or Xbox. We are able to keep up on the 1/2 hr shows (we watch many of those too). (cont‚Ä¶
@Manu3lM ‚Ä¶cont) It's the 1hr ones that get us!!
@Manu3lM we unfortunately dropped quite a few of these shows due to DVR space. Thankfully Hulu has all of them!! Got to catch back up.
@Manu3lM We did watch Elementary &amp; actually liked Sherlock, not so much Watson, but she's tolerable. Will watch again.
@Manu3lM Once Upon a Time, Revenge, Castle, Grimm, White Collar, Royal Pains, Pretty Little Liars, Sherlock, Last Resort, Big Bang, and more

@malkosh Yes, 5! Thanks! We got lucky w/the 4, but we could only find 1.  I ordered a semi cheap one from Amazon, 5 stars. We'll see.
Woohoo! My case shipped.  I'm so tempted to go buy one in a mall kiosk...but I'll wait.
@Manu3lM I never have been. I've been happy w/what I can do, and so I've never tried. I'd be curious to hear your opinion on benefits.

@iEmelem it can, yes. I like relax m.p. which let's you mix various different sounds. I also like deep sleep or stress by Andrew Johnson.
@mattcraig oh yeah, hadn't tried that recently. It seems to bring up whatever audio you were last listening to, not just the ipod app! Cool!
@iEmelem boooo when that happens I usually listen to a relaxation app and it puts me back to sleep.
@mattcraig on my old iPhone it did that. On this one it brings up multi-tasking. But I think that can be changed.
@iEmelem I don't know what lockerz is and am probably one of the few who doesn't like instagram. I upload via twitpic on my twitter client.
@iEmelem I would have to agree. The caption has to be pretty good for me to click on the icon & wait & wait & wait for it to load.
@ChadCavanaugh LOL Yeah, I have no idea of what to do w/it. The tech community loves it though. My twitter stream has lessened as a result.
@BettieLocke @kw4lsu Had a similar situation w/a boss. Said it didn't surprise her and that I was a great representative! ŒòÓå® everywhere!!
@livescribe Clearly I missed the original msg! Thanks! I will just be careful w/my pen till the update! Thx!
@livescribe - having trouble transferring latest pencast to livescribe desktop.  Are there problems w/Lion or is it something I'm doing? thx
It was a long time comin'.  http://twitpic.com/5t5sxg
@ChadCavanaugh LOL But it probably won't take long to get it back.
@iEmelem yay! I'll be curious to hear your thoughts.
@ChadCavanaugh you'll be the first one check out then!
Got Spotify. Now what do I do? Did you get your invite  @iEmelem?
@jasonjohnston11 very entertaining. Thanks for sharing!
@SureSister I have sure enjoyed my decision to go Greek. The most fruitful has been my experiences as an alumnae. It is for a lifetime!
@iEmelem ohhhhh that does, since that is how I would listen. Well Pandora it is then!
@iEmelem that's not too bad since I don't tend to listen to much. Just want to check it out before I decide if I want to pay.
@iEmelem I haven't gotten mine yet & I signed up a while back. Waiting patiently too!
@iEmelem Boooooo!  LOL I don't like that!
@iEmelem I am loving it. Although it makes swimming difficult. Even though the water is 84 degrees, still cold w/no sun!
@druglady09 that's totally something I'd do! Have fun!!
@iEmelem an invite for me would be awesome!!
@nickdifilippo you have to follow me first I guess! Then I'll send! Thanks!

@FresnoBeehive I agree w/the library, it's showing humor and that they're hip to the latest meme & current PR events. Good for them!!
@seanbonner LOL Singapore's always that way. There in Dec. & it was ungodly hot & rainy.  Paris in June was nice, but that was a decade ago.
@Willowbottom huh wha wha huh? LOL I love biz speak.
@komodofood Thanks!! We definitely will!
@TheLadyFred Shew! Good, we were concerned! ÓÅñ
@komodofood Loved our experience w/you guys the other night.  Great food!! But when you say something is spicy, you mean spicy!!
@Willowbottom http://twitpic.com/252mga - Ewwww or an animal claw (w/pickles as toe nails)!!
@ChadCavanaugh Sweet! I'd seen that as a possibility, but wasn't sure it'd been confirmed.
@ChadCavanaugh Is it back on, I know it hit some stumbling blocks.
@TUAW This recall and the hubub is so silly,  I know quite a few people who have had no problems at all....
@TheLadyFred I hate to break it to you, but from your pic it looks like you can actually move.  Luxury Rob says. (cont) http://tl.gd/2fojt5
@kkstweetpage Of course it can!!!
@mattincarolina wow, I thought I talked a lot!!
@mattincarolina Wow, how long does yours get? And how much do you need? I've never run through the time.
@mattincarolina LOL of course I weigh in after you got  one, but I love my jawbone icon!
@ChadCavanaugh Oh no, you're doomed.  I'm sorry! If she brings it out at the reunion because her crops are withering, I'll say something LOL
@ChadCavanaugh just as long as she isn't laying it in her phone. I refuse to do that!!
@VCFibers Netflix or Hulu or something like that on the computer??
@Willowbottom They're above the law, you should know that by now! I see them eating, talking while not hands free, etc.

@mattsingley I am loving this weather!!
@chris_leung Supposedly Trent Reznor did the music, that surprised us!
@jaimegochez Others were saying the same thing.  I didn't even feel it.  Heard something fall, wondered what it was!  Lamps were swinging.
Got some pretty cool #ThetaGC goodies from my little sis since I couldn't attend.  Love my little sis!!
@mattincarolina Screens are getting so nice.  I can't believe the improvement between iPhones.  You must have had a bad screen before, huh?
@jaimegochez Especially since it wasn't THAT huge.
Earthquake and I didn't even feel it!
@mattincarolina LOL I don't want people to know where I am or that I'm not home! There were sites that followed people's logins to rob them!
@mattincarolina LOL I think foursquare is kinda creepy!
@mattincarolina I really liked my HTC when I had it. Good luck!!
@ChadCavanaugh LOL or the iPhone line I stood in. I wish that it was only 40 min though.
Happy 4th everyone!!!
@Willowbottom LOL this are the best kind because they're soooi cheesy!!
Had a pennywort apple drink today and it was pretty tasty!!
@mattincarolina LOL uhhhh so glad you're back to tweeting. My day wouldn't have been complete w/o that.
@serena Salon Chameleon in Pasadena, 626-535-9098.  I love them!
@chris_leung good luck!! 3GS seems to update fine, but I've heard too many horror stories about the 3G!
@feliciaday LOL I do too, especially for my height!  Oh well!
@BettieLocke Great video! I hope I get to see it in person some day!
@StufMyKidsSay haha so cute!
@Willowbottom I use Twittelator Pro and it's one of the choices.  Also look up Twitter Keys for your web browser and I think it's (cont‚Ä¶
@Willowbottom ‚Ä¶cont) one of the symbols too!!
@Willowbottom When I forget Œò is for a lifetime, my BF reminds me. I saw a girl w/letters on the other day (cont) http://tl.gd/27r142
@ginatrapani That makes me laugh because I haven't had 1 problem yet. Maybe I'm not holding it right? =)
@aramgranger if you have the 3GS it'll do it too!! Sadly 3G and earlier wouldn't so I was excited!!
Just tried augmented reality on my phone for the first time. Very cool!!!
@leolaporte iPhone problem is probably galvanic response with people's hands. Same as with bimetal Euro $1 and $2 coins.
@Willowbottom That is so awesome, whether they did or not, I'm confident they'd be proud of the awesome women we call Thetas!!
@aramgranger LOL and I'm left handed!! So I'm in even bigger trouble apparently!!
@ThetaGC I am!! FCB secretary for Beta Xi!  I love it. Being involved with the girls, through the upkeep of the house, makes me feel great!
9 hrs later, got the new iPhone.  I'm loving it!!
@griffintech YES!!!
@mattincarolina I was gonna say....
http://bit.ly/atW4UQ Wow, wish I'd ordered vs wanting the exp. of the line! LOL
I love twitlonger that you can use via Twittelator Pro. I wish that was possible via the website.
@TheLadyFred From AT&amp;T's iPhone FB page: &quot;So here's the deal: if you are a current smartphone customer (cont) http://tl.gd/22751i
@TheLadyFred from AT&T's site, macrumors, & when I pre-ordered, it said existing customers were grandfathered (cont) http://tl.gd/21nd2e
@TheLadyFred Actually, old customers can keep their unlimited data plan!! I also looked and I never use more than 1 gig, so that is good!
@TheLadyFred Actually I should say my reminder, will be up bright and early on the 24th!
@TheLadyFred Yup, Yup!! Got my confirmation email today!
@TheLadyFred Nice!! Maybe I'll try once I get the new phone, just so I'm not left w/a brick!! I am really excited!
@TheLadyFred I'm afraid it's gonna slow it down even worse.  I'll hold out a few days to see since I'm turning it into an iPod then anyhow.
@TheLadyFred How exciting! I'm going to wait for the new phone, as I don't think my poor little 3G will handle it well. LOL
@MeghanSkiff I know you have VZ but the iPhone looks pretty cool!!! I guess if I couldn't get one, I'd get a droid.
@mattcraig it took us about an hour and a half, but we finally got our reservation emails around 3:30 am.
@MacTweets And now their site appears to be broken.  I keep getting an 'oops!
Well I *think* I ordered a new iPhone, but w/all the hassle, who knows!
@JawboneEarwear Sent via direct message, thanks!
@Gizmodo Can you pick it up or does it have to be shipped? I wanted to pick it up.
@MeghanSkiff Awww thanks! And definitely re: next time!

It was a Pixar day at the house starting with Toy Story 1 & 2, then A bug's life and finally Monster's Inc. I was even wearing my Up shirt!
@JawboneEarwear NM, must be a glitch on my machine, was able to d/l on another.
@podagraph it's called the fail whale & it's been happening a LOT lately.
@chris_leung is it still arrrgh in Chinese?  ÓêÇ
@JawboneEarwear Any reason the Icon updater wouldn't be downloading?  Just got one and I get can't it to install or even show in downloads.
@geeksugar Heck yeah!!!
@aramgranger Thanks! I'll have to check them out!
@gryphun Yay!! Gotta check it out! Thanks for the heads up!
@aramgranger which app have you been using for the pics you've been posting lately? Like the look of them!
@UCRAlum all the stupid "Save the Juice" signs, unfortunately, as I graduated in '94 on the weekend of OJ's slow speed chase.
@Mr_Darling Thanks!! I also saw a message from DirectTV, they reset them too!
Hmmmm my #slingbox isn't responding to my #directv this morning.  Did anything happen w/either service overnight?
RT @Willowbottom Asking BP to practice what they preach: http://bit.ly/b0dDM8
@Willowbottom Love that! I need to reuse!!
@Willowbottom I didn't either until my bf told me...and now I've noticed on their signs in small letters it shows BP....
@bellasugar Sometimes, sure, why not?!
Cannot wait for the new phone!!!
@Willowbottom I know, it stinks all around, but I know that Arco is BP and that is where I usually purchase.  (cont) http://tl.gd/1nfuqf
@TheLadyFred Bon voyage!! ÓàÇ
@Willowbottom but did you at least do it at a non BP station?

Ohhh, sore tummy, not sure if it was the gym, or lunch...hopefully it was the gym!
@SweetChicken21 LOL I use my Twitter a lot, just don't usually like #Lost
@SweetChicken21 LOL I'll be watching Apprentice. You're recapping #Lost just fine for me!!
Does anyone know of a good app (other than say numbers/excel) to graph workouts w/many variables?  Not jogging/biking/route/time/speed stuff
@Willowbottom  Nice to know of you as well! I am close. Last convention 4 me was Scottsdale. Too much work stuff going on for this one. :-(
@MeghanSkiff I am a Delta Psi (UC Riverside) Unfortunately our chapter is closed, but our alumnae are still going strong!!
@TheLadyFred Well the Mythbusters of course!!
@MeghanSkiff Unfortunately I won't. :-(  However, my little sis and quite a few others from my chapter will, so we'll be well represented!
@MeghanSkiff if the latest rumors are true, Apple and AT&T have exclusivity for a couple more years....
@TheLadyFred How do you like the new app? I think I like #Twittelator Pro better.  Maybe it's just because I'm used to it.
@aramgranger My Grandmother sent me the ash in a baby aspirin bottle!  I used to know where it was, but I can't find it now.  Ahhh memories!
This weather makes me want to curl up and go to sleep.  I love it!
Can't believe we're caught up on Stargate Universe...watched 6 episodes yesterday!

Happy Earth Day!
@Scobleizer Yup, that's why I usually only retweet via my phone.  Don't like it otherwise!
@gryphun Same for the US, but I still was able to get the mp3. I think because it's free.
@gryphun It does the same w/podcasts.
@Intelligentsia I saw that you're coming to Old Pasadena? Awesome!
Made my first Jamie Oliver recipe tonight!  Macaroni & cauliflower bake. I used wheat penne & added chicken. He suggested shrimp.
@geeksugar That is just so wrong...mini iPad.... lol
@6_8Nate You'd think there would be as all of us 1st and 2nd gen owners are now going to want a new phone, but I don't want the 3GS....
@ThetaFoundation That would be 'do' you! LOL I was phrasing it differently the first time!
@ThetaFoundation Does you have to be a Theta to get a #pansypatch pansy? I'd like to honor Beta Xi's house mom!
@mashable Grrrr not happy about that...then I want a new phone!
@Foodimentary Nice! I used to microwave, but not in a sealed container.
@tuawlive Have they mentioned when there will be a new phone then?
If I can't multi-task, when is the new phone coming out?!!!
@tuawlive That'll be interesting. My devices can't see each other right now. Because they're on separate accts? My ipad can't c phone.
@livescribe I've sold 3 pens by demoing mine! I almost stopped people in the street. It would've been perfect for them. I'm nuts about it!
@BettieLocke I haven't yet, can't wait to get it though!
@KPpaulie Thanks! Of course our KP docs took good care of me and I'm on the way to recovery!

My DM # went down. Did Twitter do some spam clean up?
I don't get to go to the gym today and I'm actually upset about that.  Who am I, and what happened to hkdkat?
To clarify, I was in a restaurant.
Are people really that lazy or do they come straight from the gym? I know I just came from the gym.
@gryphun LOL or trying to.  I need to take time off, wanted to take Monday, now we have a fire drill till Wed....
Anyone heard of Quick Gym ROM? Thoughts?
@TotalApps What problems are you having, I still like mine so far.
@aramgranger That is really depressing and makes me even happier that my first day back at the gym is today!
@mattincarolina you could always jailbreak it. Luckily out here we have pretty good coverage, so I don't mind.
@mattincarolina or iPhone!!!
Happy Pi Day!
@mattincarolina Be careful, you don't want what was my fate to become yours!!
Took a nap and now I can't sleep...AND I slept through dinner. So I'm hungry too. ÓÅô

@iEmelem My faves have been compression & rope n fly, so much so I bought rope n fly 2.  I liked mini squadron and polyhedra from appvent.
@iEmelem Yep, I've gotten almost every one (w/the exception of the kids apps) even when it was appvent! I love it!
@MisterSling Will it be an update of the current app, or a completely new one?  I want to buy the current app, but not if it won't work.
@iEmelem luckily I haven't had to do that since 2.0, AND it never worked 4 me, I'd always have to restore to original and add apps 1 by 1!!
@iEmelem Not sure if it was the udpated iTunes, OS or a crazy combination.  Should I try again?!
@iEmelem I have the 3G (2nd gen) but I'm afraid to try again as I had an app that wouldn't uninstall and the phone took 10 min to boot!
@freeappaday Anyone mentioned they couldn't get spring fling to work? It just stays on the loading page and actually made my phone funky.
@LACityNerd Just started following, read the out of town drivers post, for me it's their inability to understand cross walks in Pasadena!

Is anyone else having a problem with AT&T's 3G?
Getting ready to watch a movie and then get some zzz's! G'nite tweeples!
G'nite tweeples!
I didn't feel it, but the bf did - Quake!
I love this weather, but it's cold.  Maybe I shouldn't have broken the heater!!
I hate it when I buy something and then the price is lowered the very next day!!
http://tinyurl.com/c3amds  very cute!
@shortyawards I vote for @FLWBooks in your #entertainment category 'cause I love getting lost between the covers. :)
I'm loving this weather! Wish it would rain a bit more.
@Pedal Yup, earthquake  3.1 in Reseda
@abc7 I felt it!
@jakemarsh Yes I did feel it!
Another little shaker! 3.1 in Reseda
@Trigeia about $650 US
@zaren I heard that was happening this yr but can't remember why.  They'd replace it I think. We ordered calendars 2 yrs ago and were happy.
@twittelator Thanks!! I'll see if that stops the jumping to my @'s and D's too!
Is anyone else's twittelator wigging out? I'm hearing weird beeps and it keeps skipping to my d's and @'s while reading tweets. Any ideas?
is a lefty, get used to it!!
Did some awesome star gazing last night from the roof.  Wish I had taken pics.
Tried some jasmine tea and I'm still alive *shew*
Chopping some veggies to make a chicken stirfry!
@WomenWhoTech That might work (re: coffee).  But if it doesn't, I'll still feel good knowing I volunteered!
@WomenWhoTech the only thing that stinks about that is I'm volunteering on the 19th. Guess I'll have to do more if I want coffee!
Excited that I can play Still Alive on Rock Band!
I've done some cleaning, I've done some work, now I think it's time for some rock band!!
@theRab That always happens to me (re: lunch) not 6, but at least 1!
Dragging today because of late night rock banding (is that a word?) last night!
I did it, I bought Rock Band 2!!!
@mroberts23 thank you so much! And it's cinnamon! My favorite kind. ‚ò∫
Went to urgent care, no ear infection. Now I just need to get them to POP!!
At Le Pain Quotidien trying to practice self control. I only need the sandwich! I want everything else!!

Mmmmmm Starbuck's espresso truffle, tasty!!
@Tricon My office too and it's usually roasting.  Guess they're gearing up for the 80+ weather today.
Just threw away $15 of oatmeal and is not happy about it.  The restaurant didn't even offer to give any money back or anything....
Did not enjoy the hot weather today...where is our Winter??
Laundry on a Saturday night!  Fun Fun!!
G'nite twitterers!
@holly_t Thanks for reminding me, it's been so far between that I'd forgotten about it and got a new dvr so it wouldn't have picked it up!
@mashable I felt it in the Valley!
@zaren yup, sound about right from what I felt and I'm about 68 miles from the epicenter!! Not really that close!
@abc7 felt it in the valley!
@mammaloves southern California - we had a shaker!!
Wow! That was a shaker!
@Trigeia I guess that's true! But we always need a break at one time or another!! It's good to get away from this keyboard!
Being sick the last few days has made me a less than exciting twitterer!! Sorry all and welcome to my latest followers!
Thinking it is about time for dinner!!
@Trigeia Me me me!!! (for starbucks delivering) but how much more $$ would it make it? For my house/work I'm w/in walking distance.
I sure wish I knew where I put my cough lozenges....
Wishing that this cold would be over!! Not a great way to start the new year.
@gryphun Thanks for retweeting that!  So far the consensus is RockBand 2!
@zaren That seems to be the consensus so far.  I had a great time when I played it!
@countrogan Thanks! I played RockBand 2 and it just looked like more fun that guitar hero, I liked the selection of songs a bit more too.
Which is better? Guitar Hero or Rock Band? And if Guitar Hero, which one?
The first person I followed on Twitter was @foxdrive. http://tinyurl.com/9cflat #firstfollow
I'm loving this weather!!
It feels weird to be the only one from my team working today (at least so far - one more is supposed to work today too).
Not feeling too great, going to go to sleep in hopes of feeling better in the morning.
Time to go make some dinner w/the leftovers from last night's fondue, hopefully I can whip up something tasty!
I'm going to play lumines if I can find where we packed it!
I would love to win one of HGTV's dream homes but I'd have to mortgage the taxes!!
Watching the TOR parade, so much better from the warmth of my home!
Happy New Year Twitterers!
I am going to try my best to avoid Pasadena for the next few days!
Wishes it was cooler and raining, but then SoCal always puts on its best face for the rose parade/bowl.
I'm happy to be home for a long stretch now! I don't understand how some folks fly so much...not for me!
@FlyCastMobile I'm thinking that mystery theater has hours or something as it doesn't seem to work overnight (which is when I listen) :-(
@TheRaj good luck!!
@FlyCastMobile seems to be wigging out this morning.  Need to go see if there is anyone else having trouble.
Has anyone else noticed the app store being slow on updates and new apps during the holiday or is it just me?
I had a great time playing Rock band tonight!
Merry Christmas Twitterers!
@FlyCastMobile About 2 days ago, yes. Have a very Happy Holiday!! No worries about being out is the office. Just wanted to let you know.
@FlyCastMobile as an example. I was thinking it might be something to do with the skip back going buggy. Just wanted to let you know!
@FlyCastMobile No worries! I've noticed it 2X. Listening to sherlock holmes on mystery theater,  then w/o finishing it switches to Dragnet.
Is facebook down?? Oh well, just saves me from wasting more time!
@FlyCastMobile does it have to do with the fact that a show will skip to another show w/o being done yet? If not, that's happening to me.
Because you never can have enough lip balm!! http://tinyurl.com/7cmzmf
I think I'm finally getting over my jet lag! Yipeee!!
@jacobburke I haven't gone to bed...jet lag stinks!
@JayOatway LOL I ordered something from Amazon from inside a Target when I saw Amazon's price was better!
Trying to sleep but watching a Hitchcock show instead.
This jet lag is still kicking my butt! I can't wait for the weekend.
I think I missed a big bang theory as it was misnamed in my dvr as a repeat :-(
In an all day conference while fighting jet lag.
@gapingvoid I'm with ya, I can't really get to sleep & have to fly again in a few hours. ‚òπ

Happy Turkey Day Twitterers!!
I am loving this rain!!
This day is just zooming by! I'm busy and that is a good thing!
G'nite twitterers!! Sweet dreams!
I'm loving the new gmail themes!
I hate hearing others eating chips...makes me want some! But I'm not going to give in!!
@denyseduhaime It's probably too much to twitter, but if you d me your email address I can forward the recipe.
@denyseduhaime a similar sauce to the pumpkin would work. It's white wine with shallots, pepper, and some sage. Very simple, yet tasty.
@THE_REAL_SHAQ mmmmm whataburger! Such a treat when I'm in areas w/one! You're forgiven.
Mmmm having some lavosh and cheese!! Tasty, tasty!
@denyseduhaime I'm thinking of making some more of the pumpkin raviolis since we have pumpkin puree left.
@MMartin cool! I didn't realize you could do that! Thanks!
@MMartin for the iPhone? What is it called? I use exposure, but just to view. Can't upload.
@FlyCastMobile Thanks! I saw on the forum that others are having the same issue.
@denyseduhaime mmmmm brownies!! I wish I had some now.
@FlyCastMobile my stream disconnects now when my phone goes to sleep since the 2.2 update (iPhone). Any ideas?
Making broken florentine lasagna bake for dinner!! Yum Yum!!
Wow I can't remember how long it's been since it was under $30 to fill up, that's great!!
It doesn't appear you can do streetview w/pins you've already dropped on the google maps for iPhone, does this sound right?
Wow, I guess getting the new iPhone software was unpopular as I got a few qwitters after that! LOL Oh well.
Getting the new iPhone software!!!
Is anyone else having trouble w/the app store or is it just me?
@aramgranger hey there howdy from me and @orb11
@TriNet That is what it was!! Thanks!
What exactly is the job of a social bookmarker?
Figured out how to change themes when the theme tab finally appeared, now one of my friends can't see it on his either, very weird.
I'm not liking the new gmail theme...I can't figure out how to change it and I can't see some of the articles and what not in that top bar.
Hungry for lunch but I don't know what I want.
Getting ready to make turkey and black bean soup for dinner!
@LiveCrunch I don't have the G1, I have the iPhone and really love it.  Videos, cut and paste and voice dialing are all I really miss!
Loving that it is 78.5 in her office (no, not really loving it).
@LiveCrunch That's the only thing? That's saying a lot!!
@ryankuder I could only go to 80 something, that is how I found it too.
@ryankuder Not sure if this is the first, but it's the furthest I can go back: http://twitter.com/hkdkat/status/29150411
I cannot believe how hot it is outside right now...middle of November...and it will probably only get worse!
The skies seem clearer today, that is great.  Hopefully it translates to better conditions for the fire fighters!
Time for me to wind down and get ready for bed. Goodnight twitterverse! ‚òæ
@Atrion84 lol no problem, glad you got it! Just wanted to make sure I didn't fat finger the address!  Enjoy!
Dinner is almost ready!  Turkey sausage/vodka sauce w/sundried tomatoes over bow tie pasta with some green beans!
Didn't quite get to working out, now to make dinner!
@Atrion84 Sent! let me know if you don't get it.
@denyseduhaime if you can't find it, I can email to you.
@Atrion84 I can email the recipe to you, not sure if there is a link as I got it out of the magazine, not online!
@Atrion84 Made it for a co-worker's birthday tomorrow.  She fell in love with the TJ's version so I hope she likes mine!!
@Atrion84 Yup, a recipe from Ready Made magazine.  They sell it at Trader Joe's but I found a recipe for it!  It's pretty tasty on toast!
Pumpkin butter made, now to go work out a bit and then to make dinner!
Watching ninja warrior and then going to attempt to make some pumpkin butter.
Just saw 4 deer. Wonder how many more there are?
@zaren the shallots seemed normal, didn't notice that they were too strong so you should be safe. Good luck, sounds yummy!
@zaren I've even noticed inconsistencies with shallots from the same bunch, could just be a fluke.
@denyseduhaime I think there is a rule now because of bots.  I'd say look at the @twitter blogs for info.
@bikerbar so jealous, what a lovely scene. Here it's smoky and 90+ degrees. Enjoy!!
Luckily nowhere near the fires, but a truck still zoomed by my house, always nerve wracking to hear, especially with all of this going on.
mmmmmm sounds tasty!  http://tinyurl.com/56ad9w
@wholefoods do you know off hand if your stores would carry something like creamed honey?

@goaliegirl lol I changed my password even though I didn't use it! A little obsessed I know.
@goaliegirl so is that site "safe" now? I haven't done it as I don't want to have to change my password.
@goaliegirl I have found I'm able to delete from FF and twittelator pro still...at least yesterday I could.
@Pistachio Why odd? You know we tend to get a few quakes, right?  It's all about awareness.
OH: re: the Great Southern California Shakeout - they're really going to make our building shake? That's going to be scary!   Uhhhhhh...
Cookie making time again - this time for co-workers volunteering along with me for the Pasadena Marathon.
Goodnight twitterers!
Time to make dinner, luckily this time all I have to make is the veggies, the main dish was made courtesy of a Theta fundraiser! Crepes=mmm!
@BizGirl Did this just came about today? I don't recall doing this...I've only done grader and you don't have to give a pwd for that.
@lisalee I was able to do it via twittelator but I can't seem to figure out how to do it here anymore.
It's beautiful outside, I want to be out there, not stuck in an office!  Oh well, soon enough.
Eating some dried apricots - YUMMY!
I'm already hungry and it's not even close to lunch time :-(  Might have to break into my lunch early.
still deciding whether or not I like XM's changes.
@lisalee re: AC, that is no fun, and yeah we shouldn't need it in November!! We have had the windows open, but I think this wknd AC it is.
@lisalee I know, at least it's down to 91 from the 94 I originally heard for Friday...happy November!
@Tricon We always want what we don't have, huh?
Time to wii fit and then dinner!
Wow, it's a chilly 77 degrees now...lol I just hope it's cooler tomorrow.
Not thrilled that it is almost 78 degrees in my office and I'm wearing a sweater...
Good morning twitterers!
Making pizza for dinner tonight, I'm just all domestic lately!!
@mammaloves I've gathered stones to do my own...best intentions, never happened, wouldn't know where to begin anyhow!
Just got some coffee and hopes to drink it before she spills it all over herself because that is all she has done so far!
Should be doing something productive, but playing a word scramble game on FB instead! LOL
Quick meeting, now the rest of the day is ahead of me!!
Getting ready to go to the UCLA Theta FCB meeting!!
Raviolis and beautiful sunset: http://www.flickr.com/photos/hkdkat
Water boiling for the raviolis! Pics later, but they smell yummy so far!
Getting the ingredients together to make pumpkin raviolis later today!
@theRab Just looked at your pic, my sister was an OX's Fox and we were both Theta's (unfortunately there were no OX's at my campus).
Home after a fun day of running around Pasadena!

The Wii Fit said my age was 28, boy have I got that thing snowed!
My boss and I got stopped on the street in Old Pasadena and asked if we wanted to be on "Extra!" tonight, not sure what for but we said nah!
@st3phen Thank you for that!! See I'm not exactly savvy to this stuff, but I am learning w/help from those in the know!
@st3phen I guess given that everyone I know was thrilled, yeah.
Surprised by the stock market given yesterday's outcome.
@lisalee And there is a Ben and Jerry's in Burbank too!  Did you go there?
@seanbonner I've heard 48% Yes 52% No so far - it's being defeated!!!
@Pistachio all reports I saw said 77% for LA county at least, almost 3.5 million, at least we're not slow down south.
Thrilled for Obama and this historic moment!! #current #election
@jacobburke according to ABC & NBC too
@lisalee Good for you! I didn't get any of my free stuff as I wanted to avoid lines!
@zaren Too bad, I'm having apple sake!  I'll have some for you.
@holly_tucker re: Wolf Blitzer, very much so!
@goaliegirl re: linkedin, I don't mix my personal and professional as they differ since I'm in the corporate world.  Just my preference!
@travisjeffery depends on your use.  VMWare is better for graphics, but I don't do more than word processing so parallels works for me.
@Starbucks Is hot chocolate an option if you don't drink coffee?
Just voted!
About 25 in line to vote, not too bad & a woman in front of me hasn't voted in 25 years! Glad she's voting now!
@theRab I hear it was a fantastic show, we're sorry we missed it. I have the iPhone game though.
@DIRECTV Wish I'd known about you on Twitter when I got my HD installed.  I had a not too happy process and was thinking of leaving DirecTV.
@siliconireland LOL me too and I'm not quite sure how to do it!
Before I tell my doctor that my allergy meds aren't working I should probably start taking them daily, huh?!
@FlyCastMobile I love flycast!  Thanks for the follow!
@siliconireland yeah I dropped too. Bummer. I think they mentioned some grading issues.
@theRab cool list re: vote hours, thx. I don't know if our CIO does but I know my two immediate bosses do!
@zaren someone stopped following me and I answered a lot of the questions they posted. Guess they didn't appreciate the answers. LOL
Trying to stay up to watch the news, but way too tired! G'nite twitterers!
Just heard sirens like I haven't heard in awhile.  Will have to see if @LAFD posts anything soon.
@guykawasaki Awesome, thanks for the link!  Lots of fun calendars to find there.
@mammaloves FCB that is, not FBC! Sheesh, even though it's only 9 for me, it feels like 10!  I'm starting to not make sense!
@mammaloves UC Riverside! Unfortunately our chapter was closed but I'm on the FBC for UCLA!
All of a sudden this futon is not so comfortable, not sure how @gryphun slept on it for so long?!
@mammaloves Kappa Alpha Theta alum here! Just searched Twitter for Theta and found your post!
You'd think the bf and I live in a huge mansion w/the way we use the intercom function on our cordless phones...so lazy!
@Atrion84 oh very cool! I'm watching on tv so we'll see what they do, but I might have to get the DVD if that's the case!
@Atrion84 not sure about the number of endings yet, but it is from 1985 with Tim Curry. So far it's campy but fun.
Getting ready to watch "Clue". I'm sure it is a horrible movie, but the game holds such fond childhood memories!
It's only 5:00 p.m., feels like it should be later, but I'm not complaining!  Need to do some work and don't want to be doing it too late.
@lisalee Too funny! We didn't have a chance to wave, we were admiring the car and then he rolled down his window as we were turning past him

Making breakfast, I've just felt all domestic lately! LOL
Oven heating, dinner is about to be prepared!
Cookies - done, dinner in about an hour and a half, individual pizzas and veggies w/some wine maybe?  Time to play LittleBigPlanet now yay!!
First batch baking, they look delish!
makin' cookies on this fine rainy/thunder/lightning day!
Good thing I just got gas as the check always burn through it.
I wonder why it is so hard to find smog check places when they are mandatory in Ca. Smog tests are easier to find but always get the check.
I love that it's raining but I don't want to go out, SCAL can't drive in rain!! And I want to bake and you can't bake when it is raining!
Doing laundry, making cookies and getting ready to make dinner!
@twittelator @guykawasaki has sworn by it before and that is how I found it.  Now I sing its praises to folks too!
Which should I make tonight? Chocolate Swirl Gingerbread, Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies, or Pumpkin Cheesecake?  You decide.

@twittelator Awesome, thanks!
Just got done w/a really long meeting...it's always draining, maybe now I can get that coffee I wanted this a.m.!!
@1Password Saw it, but I already own it and one of my friends just bought it for full price! Poor guy!!  Great deal though!!
People in Glendale really need to learn how to drive.  A little girl was killed in the cross walk.  What a shame.

Thanks for the birthday wishes yesterday! It was a good day, despite the getting older thing.
@lisalee Thank you!!
Woohoo, got Airport Extreme for my birthday, pretty sad that I'm excited about it, I know, but I am!
Nice that google gives you your polling location, too bad mine was wrong, unless I have a card in the mail today that changes it.
It's still warm at work today 76 degrees in my cube...blech.
My sister surprised me and took me to lunch for my birthday! What a great surprise!
Grrr forgot my XM, at least I can listen to FlyCast on my phone!
Could have had Wings/Kings tix but my friend's husband gave them away before I said yes to her...nuts!

Why do I get sucked into these stupid movies on LMN?
Reading about people w/cool/cold/rainy weather is making me jealous.  It'll be 91 today (so hotter) we won't see under 80 until Thursday! ‚òπ
The launch was cool, hopefully we got good pics!
@LAist Yep, we were planning to drive out to see it, but now we're just going up on the roof, I'd rather go because then it is dinner in SB!
@mknell re: Kath and Kim, that's unfortunate as the original is very funny.
@chrisbrogan I really like Twittelator Pro
@theRab Ghost in a Bag is cute and shouldn't be too hard! Thanks for the link as I'm sure my bf won't want to do snoopy for a third year!
@theRab You got video? Awesome! I was too chicken as they came and told someone near me to stop.  Kids behind us were screaming from fright!
Oprah is far reaching, first my Mom wanted to try Skype, now she wants to buy me a Kindle! LOL
@jessestay luckily I read your posts, following again and look forward to you following me again too.  This Qwitter thing is dangerous!

@ericjodom Is CA one of those states? I've never had to give my ID, but I do always have my voter guide w/my name/address on it, BUT no pic.
@countrogan Nice re: gas, we're still at $3.25 here in scal, at least yesterday we were.
Had my first qwitter, wonder if it was because I wasn't following them? Oh well, such is life, not everyone will like you! ‚ò∫
time for me to rest g'nite twitterers!
din din time, bbiab
I don't understand who is polled when they come out and say which prop is leading, I've never been asked and I usually disagree. Ask ME!!
@kabren So glad you're enjoying your new computer.  My mbp isn't even a year old yet (I got it 10/26/07) and I still love it!
@seanbonner Hahaha, no that won't prevent it, although I'm sure you're more gentlemanly than that, maybe you got it because they trust you!
@seanbonner It's to stop men from groping, which happened fairly often on their trains.
@dailytwitter sounds heavenly to me.  It's 90+ degrees in Southern California right now.

@awdylanis Hmmmm that's something I might not be able to turn down.  I'd have to wait till they go to lunch, good thing they all go together
@SouthwestAir wish I'd sent you that post earlier then.  I sent it about an hour ago but just to southwest, had to send again.
@SouthwestAir interested in pictures taken out of your planes? I have one of the sunrise in Burbank the other morning w/an SWA wing in it.

I love my Theta sisters!!!  Just saw a sappy video and needed to say that.
@LAist puppies definitely!!
I'm not sure whether it's the anticipation of flying or the day long trip that wear me out more, but I'm glad to be home! Now time to sleep!
@biz I was just helping my Mom w/her resume too, very strange feeling since she should be retiring!
@lisalee and comedy central and g4 (re male enhancement ads).
Since we always buffer the debates, I'm always behind w/twitter/ff.
@joshklein I would think any local tv channel, here is one: http://tinyurl.com/45j7c6
@ryankuder Hi Scott!
@zaren Or Mercury in retrograde which seems to be a popular answer lately! LOL
Why is the market tanking today? It did so well yesterday.
g'nite twitterers!
turned on the tv, bf must have been watching last, it was on the science channel.
Neighbor's phone keeps ringing, ANSWER IT!!!
Must stop buying apps from the app store!! I know they're only 99 cents, but sheesh, I don't shop at the 99 cent store!! Why is this so fun?
@megfowler that dinner sounds delicious!  Gave me an idea for ours...not quite as fancy, but hopefully tasty!
Granola is yucky w/o yogurt, but fruit snacks are good!
hungry, but the bf is sleeping, maybe I'll have a handful of granola to hold me over.
@zaren not sure if you saw it or not, but here are the two pics (first two of my flickr stream) www.flickr.com/hkdkat
Got the iPhone pics to work again by deleting all of them.
Grrrr the gardeners cut my bf's DirecTV lines...no tv for him! lol
@zaren Here they are, first two on my flickr stream http://www.flickr.com/photos/hkdkat/  Not as good as yours but enjoy!
Anyone else had trouble getting pictures off of their iPhone recently?
@zaren I saw a mantis today and wanted to post so you could see but I'm having a problem getting pics off of my phone :-( Will try later.
@twittelator Yeah! Can't wait to get the newest version!  I had weirdness where it would automatically start a msg for me when I had gps on.
@nateritter a timely article given your latest venture - Which Brand First Introduced Clipped Coupons: http://www.savvysugar.com/2346039
Pad Thai from a hidden treasure in Old Pasadena www.equatorcafe.com
Why oh why is the office so warm, it was a cool weekend.
@nateritter Sweet, thanks!!
@kabren mmmmmm @wholefoods wish I were closer to one for lunch, but then that'd be dangerous!
@nateritter Just checking, do you have more than food and tech just yet? I want to make sure to follow all I need to!
@Viss That sounds about right, see I told you I hadn't watched them yet! LOL
@Viss Thanks!  He thought he was missing something!  Enjoy!
@Viss Very cool!  Do you have the names of the unreleased episodes, my bf is curious?!
@Viss Glad to hear discussion around Zim, my bf worked on it! I've still yet to see all of them though, even though we own the box sets!
@LAFD Thank you so much for all you do.  We smelled smoke last night and I turned to Twitter to see what was going on, there was your post!!
@theRab Creeeeepy, very cool! I love this time of year!
@chrisbrogan re: night spider -- Creeeeeepy! I like it!
Grrr the app store claims apps are being "modified", they just don't want me to get them for free.
@zaren Glad I got to see it.  It looked like it was posing just for your pic, very nice capture!!
@zaren I couldn't get the first link to work but the last one did.  What an awesome pic!!!
Having an iPhone is dangerous...I spent almost $50 on Amazon.com while shopping in Target because Amazon had it cheaper!!
I wish my ear would stop feeling funny.  I can't get sick, so this ear needs to straighten out!
@toonlet better dorm food maybe? It was 15 for me too!
me thinks it is time to play some spore, can't sleep because it smells like smoke due to the hansen dam fire.
@nateritter I really like tech & home (bed, bath & beyond) type items!
@nateritter I subscribe to a few already, but the deals are usually up by the time I visit. ‚òπ So if that could be rectified....
Just finished playing some Spore, now time for dinner!
People's lack of manners astound me! ‚òπ and she has kids in the car with her.
Pasadena Art Night was a success!!
If you're in Pasadena tonight, make sure to take advantage of the #artwalk
Apple's really on the ball w/their shipments, too bad FedEx isn't!
@iPhoneAlley Thanks for the CAP tip. It seems to work easily!
It is actually quite nice out today!
Weird, my mbp screen went all bluish on me...the bf fixed it! ‚ò∫
Got my car back, only $372 this time...hoping nothing else goes wrong.
@Trigeia That is hilarious, are our cars related, the last time I had car trouble, so did you!!
Ahhh more car troubles today, joy joy! Under $400 this time though instead of $1500 like last time!
@LAist no cold, but my throat sort of hurts...I think it is stress & lack of sleep. (I hope).
@wilw And I see you all the time in Old Pasadena.
@wilw I don't know, Scoble has answered me back before and he doesn't know me from a stranger on the street other than he follows me here.
Just had an iced peppermint chocolate drink, tasty!
Time for me to catch some zzzz's, goodnight twitterers!
@zaren I think I know which commercials you're talking about and my bf made the same comment!
@Molly23 it's a hashtag and a way to follow things in real time http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags
Ready to eat my arm...but waiting for the bf to get out of the shower so we can have lunch.
@dailytwitter Have you seen this? http://tinyurl.com/3wtz6y

@andymatic re: Scrubs: Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't, but they film not too far from me, so I watch every once in awhile.
Love it!  http://tinyurl.com/4l5rp7  Although I was thinking Australia, not Canada.
I'd like to go shopping or be productive but it's a great day to surround yourself w/your gadgets and curl up!
Catching up on @twitter since I have been so busy at work these last few days (and weeks but you can't go back that far in the timeline!)
Thanks @macrumors for the cool rss links for the new/free/updated iphone apps, I understand why apple did it, but I don't have to like it.
Wearing my Miramar Air Show sweatshirt in honor of the show.  Wanted to go this year but the BF said we're "air showed out".  3 in 3 years.
I ‚ô• the weather today, such a welcome reprieve from the 100+ degree weather at the beginning of the week! It even rained this morning.
@zaren If you've done that twitter grader, that is probably how they found you,  I had quite an influx of real folks from that.
@zaren so this all infuriates me.
@zaren I couldn't agree w/you more.  I didn't buy a house because I knew the mortgage would change and didn't want to get stuck w/a bad one.
@buzzbishop and @viss agreed
@buzzbishop I think they just don't want it to become a federal issue adn want it to be state's rights (gay marriage)
@humancell They do support the states right to vote on it and the contractual and constitutional advantages of "marriage"
@mikedoe I thought she got Talibani wrong, but I think she meant this guy: http://tinyurl.com/54cv9s
@Viss Unfortunately there are people who didn't take the "dead wife" statement the way we did...they thought it was a compliment.
@ryanaraine THAT's why I had trouble understanding her!!! I don't speak German!
"The man we need to leave."
@dustydean Thanks for clearing that up, we were wondering re: Bosniaks
@jakemarsh And WWII doesn't count.
@jakemarsh Agreed, I respect his service to the country, but he didn't fight a winning war and his being captured didn't win the war.
@Viss Have fun! We went to the show last year, it was great!!  Not going this year though :-(
@zaren so nice, it was still 90 here about an hour ago.
@_S_A_R_A_H_ Of course Carter needs to be reinstated!!!
Wow, I'm following so many political blogs who post so much, such that 38 pages back is only 4 hrs ago.
@zaren LOL I wish, 101 here!! The only fires will be potentially the hills.
Nice, it's 101 degrees at 5:30 p.m.
Put up a pic more appropriate for the season!
Boo there are two little scratches on the back of my phone.  I think dust gets caught in the case and works its way in.
It's a million degrees out there...not liking this one bit.
Pasadena needs to get their solicitors/beggars under control. It makes me not want to walk down the street, or to be on the phone when I do.
Ooops opened the Halloween app to just look at how many days left and the witch cackled out loud...I'm at work, nice....
@timoreilly Too bad, that'd be a great app since I have access via my company and could use it!
creative writing stinks...but my boss thinks I'm good at it! LOL
@LAist my bf is the last person I hugged.
So I reinstalled and no problem, actually looks pretty cool, but I don't like FB on the computer.
Buggy doesn't describe the new FB app, I can't even log in. Keyboard is non-responsive.
It feels like I have something in my eye, but I can't find it.
The last time I did something similar, my hands hurt forever!
Playing wipeout hd, dangerous!
@wholefoods mmm mmm mmm I love chilaquiles!! Thanks for a great recipe!
@zaren They're pretty entertaining, Alton is a little snarky at times though!  Sunday night at 6 or 7 Pacific is when my DVR catches it.
Crazy clouds out there in the SCAL area!
NHL2K09 is Beautiful!!
@zaren Are you watching Feasting on Waves? I know you like Alton's other shows. We're enjoying the series.
@wilw LOL I was born there, it's not exciting at all!! The drive from Fresno to L.A. can put you to sleep, make sure to keep her awake!
@acomputerpro you've been plurking! I've seen you!
@huffpost I agree (re: Poltergeist comm.)  It is in really bad taste.
@johnculberson it is absurd that he is being allowed to get away with this, thanks for voicing this concern. It is real.
Missed the SpaceX launch...I've watched all the others. Maybe I was the bad luck? LOL Either way congrats to them!
What happened to the App Store? I can't just view "all free apps" now.
Waiting for Tina Fey on SNL, then sleeeeeep, headache finally went away, now that the day is over.
Getting ready to eat dinner!
Why would my cell phone bill be going down? Not complaining, just curious.
@winehiker happy birthday!!
I don't need them, but I think I'll bake cookies today!
Work has had me so busy I've not even wanted to look at Twitter at night!!
Anyone know why I have to refresh my Flickr stream on Friendfeed for my newly added pics to show?
If you have an opportunity to go see Walking With Dinosaurs, take it! It was outstanding.
Heading to bed, g'nite twitterers!
Going to go make dinner and watch dancing w/the stars (ashamed to admit that!)
@winehiker Ahhhh cool, thanks!  I followed a few folks that way myself!
Getting 1. a lot of followers in general, 2. a lot of followers who I can't find in my list to block, 3. a lot of foreign language followers
Had a lot of new people following me yesterday/today.  Not sure how they found me, but welcome!  So far only 1 seems like spam.
Interesting, I cannot find my latest follower to block...wonder if @twitter has caught on that they are spam?
Counting the days till the semiannual report is DONE!
wow, following so many political types that I'm missing a lot of other twitters.
@zaren Is there a link for it, or are you gonna make me hunt? :-)
@KXAN_News Sure, why not? Spooky sounds are always fun!
Wishing it were still Saturday.
Woohoo my twitter grade is going up, I'm a 72 now.
Making dinner now, sort of late tonight....
@lisalee I visit whenever you post a link!
Crazy action on the 134 today, wonder if someone important was in town?
I think everyone @ Target forgot their manners at home today &amp; I got tired of it!
@thepearproject just got my ring and my goodies, I love them!!! Thank you so much, and such fast service!
Finally saw Tropic Thunder, it was hilarious!
http://twitpic.com/cch1 - From the bf in honor of the day!
Arrr, ha'in' a yummy egg salad sandwich for lunch.	Gar, Where can I find a bottle o'rum?
@FiddleyGomme I tried following you but twitter wouldn't let me!
I'm following so many political folks now that I'm getting the same posts 2 and 3 times! LOL
@zaren cool! I love that show!
@iAlbert Isn't that the truth, the bf and I were alpha and beta testers and didn't eat or sleep for hours at a time.  We called it warcrack!
grrrr I have to get a smog on my car again, I thought I just did that last year!!
@thepearproject Awesome! I look forward to the package!
Went to get a drink &amp; ended up going to the Apple store instead, got a new case for my phone!
The APOD today is very cool!
@thepearproject Yay! I just ordered the cutest rings off of your site! Can't wait to get them.
@seanbonner have you had to do a restore? I noticed my restore didn't quite work right & my battery died in no time. Did another it's fine.
Grrr I dropped and broke my XM last night.
Gnite all!
@nateritter Twitterlator Pro is pretty good!
@goaliegirl Glad you enjoyed it!

I hate MS Word!!!!
Eww it smells like gas, gotta love leaf blowers.
I don't know if we've been hearing more emergency vehicles lately since our windows have been open more often, or if activity is up?
@zaren Do you follow them back? Some I do, this particular one I haven't yet...
It'd be interesting to see how/why folks follow you.  I get followers who don't seem like spammers, but not sure how they found me.
@LAist Good! Had a good time w/sorority sisters yesterday, today got pampered and then vegged w/the bf! How was yours?!
Time to go get ready to get my nails done! Lazy Sunday since yesterday was consumed w/lunch and meeting w/my sorority sisters.
I am loving my phone even more thanks to the latest update!  No more hour long back ups.
Happy that the bf's parents are ok, it took us a while to get through.  They are in Houston.
@NASA_EDGE Wow that is what it was at pre-storm here, don't want to see what it is today.
Wow, we aren't even close to the derailed metrolink and we're hearing helicopters and emergency vehicles! I hope folks end up ok.
So far the update looks good and it seems a bit zippier, might be my imagination though!
Doing the update, wish me luck!!
Does it feel like today was Friday to anyone else? Maybe I'm just dreading what I have to work on tomorrow.
Day two of not having to restore my phone...but watch, now that I've said that!
Well folks, it's time for me to go to sleep! Have a good night!
Hope I only got the 1 spammer to have to block today, but if not, at least @twitter made it easier to find and block them!
@LAist Hump day blues because I didn't sleep last night.
@brianshaler It caused me to not be able to sleep last night.
iPhone made me none to happy last night, but things are looking up.  I just hope I don't have to restore again tonight, but I have 1 backup.
w/in the last day or so my iphone is acting weird, battery dying quickly, hung at the startup screen, had to restore, but backup didn't work
grrrr my phone crashed last night and is now doing the 10 hr back up, which I don't have time for...so I'll just have to skip the back up.
Restoring my iPhone yet again....ahhh great fun.
Is hungry for breakfast or lunch, but should probably wait for the bf to get back....
What??!! I can go back 18 pages now??? Thank you @twitter!!!
Got iDrum and now need to make a new ringtone for the bf, he's already made one for me!
The app store is still wonky but sort of working.
@dustydean I'm still scared by V8!!
Bitter:Sweet on TTR, awesome!
I want coffee, but I have a meeting at 10:00...guess I'll just have to make my own.
@st3phen Posted a similar question right before you.  I think it's just down, won't work on my phone either. Hope it's not down till Tues.
What is up w/the iTunes app store? Is it going to be down till next week?
g'nite all!
Thanks @twitter for making it easier to block folks.  Those who have started following me are at the beginning of my list now, not the end.

BF surprised me and took me to the beach, but boy am I tired now!
@chrisbrogan It's one of my favorite seasons!! Definitely happy to see Summer gone.
@wholefoods Not offensive to me, not at all.
mmm pizza and pasta from a new (to us) restaurant in the area, can't wait to eat!
Did Wii fit and had a great brunch.  Now a nap! Then need to finish cleaning the living room.  Didn't realize how big a room it was!
Cleaning...I thought it was a holiday weekend??!
Wonder why I'm getting so much craigslist spam?
Good afternoon all!
Sometimes my phone doesn't like iTunes :-( makes me sad.
@dustydean Perfectly acceptable, it's after 5:00 pm, right?! And what a cool service!  I did something similar in college for our campus!
@Jbot6000 JEALOUS! I have HOURS left (4.5, not that I'm counting)
@Tricon mmmmm mocha, now I want one, but it's bedtime for me.  Maybe in the a.m..
@BizGirl Thanks for the WhatTasks suggestion, it is pretty neat! I really want something that will alert me too though :-(
@inkophile saw that you were a Theta, which chapter were you in? I went to UC Riverside and now volunteer for UCLA.
@WhataTrip saw that you were a Theta, which chapter were you in? I went to UC Riverside and now volunteer for UCLA.
@LizH saw that you were a Theta, which chapter were you in?  I went to UC Riverside and now volunteer for UCLA.
@zaren Ahhhh yes, I was a bit thinner too and still had Mom and Dad helping w/the bills, not now.  Luckily no car pymt, but student loans.
As predicted, my iPhone bill is cheaper than my last phone bill w/AT&T!!  Too bad my company discount is over in 2009 :-(
Sometimes I wish I could do college over again, what a great time in my life!
Just had lunch w/my boss and a co-worker.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time!  My stomach hurt.

@Trigeia yuck, I had cat converter problems last week... $1515 later...booooo. Good luck!

HUNGRY, but gotta wait for the bf to finish his work...
Just got done doing Wii Fit and the elliptical.
Woohoo, bf received his Telly Awards today, very pretty!
hours later, still backing up phone (had a hiccup in the middle when my mbp died...)
Wow my phone backups were zipping along, but this morning it's crawling.
g'nite twitterers!
oh no, just got an over capacity on twitter, but it's back now.
uninstalled and resintalled twinkle and now it works...but until I enabled twitter, I was only getting gigaom's posts??
woohoo got my hair cut today and it looks great!
@twinkleking similar problems to mac_monkey. I wasn't able to update yesterday and then today I got a tweet that was 2ds old as "recent"
waiting for my 7 apps to install so I can unhook my phone...bf is playing some weird PS3 game.
Yeah! I get to get my hair cut tomorrow!
When it rains it pours...$1500 to get my car fixed, ouch!

stop w/the spammers already!!
@joshklein Yeah, the only time I've been to a Pinkberry, it tasted like the milk had soured...I had some green tea something or other.
It's freezing in my office, think hot chocolate might be in order...
Wow I can't believe football is starting  Just got my annual "Yahoo Pro Football Pick 'em"  invite & already got some text msgs for scores!
Wow, since I got my iPhone I haven't even used windows on my mbp...only used it for my win mobile phone.
I've lost the bf to Aurora Feint
Wow I got here at the right time, this place is packed!
hungry for lunch since I never go breakfast...maybe I'll go get something to surprise the bf.
Saw Spiderwick Chronicles last night on DirecTV PPV, cute movie, but glad we didn't pay $10+ each to see it.
@twittilicious oh well, too late for that (b4 30th bday) but can I start reading now if I haven't read them all?

Just made my manga!
bf just got PS3...now I'm going to have to fight him for time to play the Wii!!
@ryanaraine yum!! I love lamb vindaloo!

Listening to @leolaporte, getting gas (under $4!!!) and getting corner bakery, yum yum!!
Hear the mailman outside, but still in PJ's so I can't go give them my letter...oh well, mail later.
a somewhat full day at siggraph, family dinner and then a party is even MORE exhausting.
a full day of siggraph was exhausting!!
Crazy party at The Edison tonight, lots of fun!
Only worked out 20 min. today, better than nothing I think!
Praying for a good back up so if I have to restore my phone again, I can use that instead of starting from scratch, third time is the charm!
Anyone going to siggraph?
dinner is going to be late tonight...and I want pizza
does anyone like/use shozu?
the bf is losing weight faster than me...hmph, guess that should be expected.
time to go wii fit! bbiab

@zeaLOG I wasn't, but I should do that! I am zeaLOGing my weight loss and how often I work out! I can add the age too.
Even my shoulders are sore.  That Wii Fit is kickin' my butt!
Wow, first day where there is no line outside the Apple store in Pasadena. Inside maybe?
grr my iphone backups are taking forever again, anyone know where the file is, so I can delete & start fresh on backing up? much appreciated
@zaren heehee how'd I know you were going to say that?
@zaren I carry 2 phones, 1 for me and 1 for work...that's enough!
@zaren My BF wants a tablet & I fear if Apple comes out w/one that is a phone as well, he'll get it even though he just got the iPhone!
@zaren I like having an all in one.  I wanted another PDA for the longest time and I got talked into getting the phone/PDA together. &lt ...
U could have seen 4 planets tonight @ 8. Now only Jupiter.
@zaren heehee not meaning to show off. The touch is pretty cool. BF has one. I had a pocket pc before this so I tend to use all of the fxns.
@iPhone of course, because the garmin is first and foremost a GPS.  The iPhone is so much more!! Can you tell I love my phone?
Need a new todo app, the one I'm using now deletes when I update it.
@hotdogsladies @hotdogsladies a restore of my phone seems to have fixed that, but it was a comlete restore back to new, lost msgs/notes.
all of a sudden I'm really tired :-(
Why are there bugs coming out of our a/c??
Tired but need to go work out or it'll never get done today.
@nintender We found it on accident and loved it!! Ran into some actor/comedians there.  They were entertaining, big egos though.
@buzzbishop I believe the last two were military sats, but I think eventually it could be all of the above.
@buzzbishop problem is...this is their 3rd attempt and it's the third miss unfortunately.
that was my attempt, but the burn pattern coming out of the nozzle started changing shape and the vehicle was oscilatting before it cut.
@buzzbishop guy who started paypal, make rockets affordable for launches
@zaren Wow, ok I can't complain then and I can see why you're so excited!
@zaren I don't blame you! I don't get a real vacation until December, I love traveling!
@jtauber Thanks!!
@zaren ohhhh pretty pretty and the amenities sound cool!  Have fun!!!
@drhorrible the link didn't work for me.  can someone post again?  Thanks!
sounds like they're still launching so that's good, but another 30 min?? Only an hour left in the window and I'm hungry, but we can't ea ...

Wanna do wii fit, but don't want to get sweaty before dinner lol.

@ericjodom was your vivianno cold?  BF got that one, I got choc/banana, they were room temp. He ended up in ER that night, not sure but....
@BadAstronomer looks like it's been pushed back a bit.
@iPhone so far so good for the GPS, had to restore last night so we'll see when I go out today.
backups are faster w/the new itunes and I've stopped getting the mdcrashreport since restoring my phone...wonder if that was causing it
@xenijardin reboot daily,  I was doing that already, good to know it's not just me.  I had to do a fresh restore, losing messages and notes.
@zaren Congrats on finding one that worked! I'm always skeptical.
@zaren do those sites really work? Have you tried refurbs like on ecost? That is how my bf got his touch and it was in good condition.
@zaren how frustrating! They were trying to get folks to sign up when they were buying iPhones, I just didn't even want 2 hear it. good luck
@dustydean I'm just reading it now, but that breakfast sounds yummy!  Hope it was!
I had to restore my phone to brand new and lost text msgs and notes due to a game in the app store :-(  Spent way too much time tonight.
@Scobleizer As of Thursday there were still people in line in Pasadena too!
grrrr think I might have to restore my phone, no app store apps are working. anyone see this before??
None of my apps are working but the mail, gps, photos are.  Did I put on one too many apps??
Yeah! I found my red pen!
@_S_A_R_A_H_ I was so excited to see you on twitter.  We paused the episode so I could add you! Anyone else from the town going to join?
just gave the mailman mail by "setting it up there" Hoping it won't fall in someone's box and be lost - student loan payments are important!
@Viss thanks! that is the other one we were testing out!  And we're not going till Dec.!!
@Viss very true, we were thinking of sugarsync to put them on the web in case they did take it.  Wouldn't want to lose the memories.
@Viss I don't...but I just feel like I'll look suspicious because I'll be so nervous!
@Viss we're going to wipe my bf's old ibook and take that, it's slow but at least it'll access the net and hold pics...pretty sad.
@Dr_of_Love definitely iPhone!
@Viss it's completely going to change the way we travel next time.  Used to blog daily, now not sure if we will, just storage for the pics.
stuck waiting to get something out for morning delivery at work, don't want to start something else to have to stop to finish the other.
wonder why the new itunes is now asking me to update all my apps every time?  luckily the backup took like 30 min. versus 2.5 hrs though!
Why are my neighbors playing music this loudly at 9:00 a.m., some people could still be sleeping (and some are!)
anyone else having icq/aim troubles w/adium and ichat?
@ryankuder Ah yes, I believe I know where you are and that always happens...near Magic Mountain is slow too.
@seanbonner Make sure location services is on and try reseting location warnings. That is what I had to do as mine initially didn't work.
I hate when people don't wash their hands in the bathroom!
Daily lunch run, daily "they're still in line outside Apple" post!
@BklynWriter too bad you didn't go yesterday, $1.50 cheesecake for nat'l cheesecake day.  We tried to get in but they were too busy!
Our building shakes a lot, but since Tues. every time I feel a shake, I freak out!
Seems to work fine, must be adium's issue.
Grrrr, now AOL is down via adium too...guess I'll see how trillian works on my other machine.
@dustydean I'm lucky, I'm short!
@iAlbert I don't actively use Pandora because I have XM, but I do have it on my phone and have stations set up!
@dustydean That's what I use at home! I don't know if it's helping any, but I really like it.  I was thinking of getting one for the bf's 2.
Is ICQ down for anyone else via Adium?  Thanks!
Sweet! Eureka's Sarah is on twitter!
There is a song called "Monkey's Wedding" love it!
I have a headache :-(
@natetrue re: screen protector, that could be why, give it another day I say and it should be good.
@st3phen Nope, don't recall installing that. It was after Palringo (or close to it.)
Going to lunch soon...wonder how many people will be outside the Apple store now?
what did I download that put a .mac sync on my computer??
Not really up, just can't sleep...maybe listening to some smooth tunes will help.
@natetrue how long have you had the screen protector on there? I noticed the stickiness went away on mine after a few days.
I don't get it!  http://www.flickr.com/photos/hkdkat/2715321595/
@CookieDoctor oohhhhh I love!! And I got some great eggplant at a farmer's market the other day!
@zaren good luck!!
@theRab I'd be curious as to what you find as we're going on vacation too  & don't want to take a laptop if poss. not a lot of sticks either
@jowyang I have the food, but not the water!!
assessed the inside of the house at least - nothing seemed to fall, surprising and good!
I need to be in better shape! Walking up 7 flights of stairs sucks!
Wow that was a big shaker!!!  All the people were out of the Apple store at that point!
I can't believe that people  are still in line for the iPhone in Pasadena!
Reading for work, feels like I'm in school again, made worse by the fact that they ARE articles I had for school awhile back & shared w/work
@buzzbishop you don't have to, just click on the x next to the backing up dialogue & it just  syncs.  Next time you restart itunes it'll b/u
@lisalee good luck!!
@iAlbert Probably knowing whatever it is makes me a better person & makes family & friends proud as they are the greatest things in my life!
strange weather here, overcast but not really cold.
grrr got  great fresh fruit  & veggies @ a farmers mkt by my Mom's house and promptly forgot to bring home the white peaches and nectarines.
Linux Ubuntu is pretty cool! I'd never seen it before. I like!!
anyone have experience w/Parlingo IM yet?  Wondering if it's worth downloading.  Only 3.5 stars, but it is free.
@ryancarson  yw!
@ryancarson geopher lite is 1.99 at the App store.  It hasn't gotten great reviews though and I thought I saw another but can't find it now.
woohoo! I got a wii fit!! I can't wait to use it!
@dustydean Wheeeeeeeeeee (re: spinning in chair - I couldn't resist)
*sigh* no Dark Knight in IMAX for me...maybe when it calms down some.
Kinda feel bad, I just blocked someone who doesn't have a lot of followers & isn't following a lot of people, but their blog made no sense.
@chrispirillo nuts, I just bought a car charger today!  I guess it's better to have in emergencies though.  I always charge my phone at nite
my mbp is crazy bright when it is full brightness and plugged in!!
After this last update, I'm having trouble bringing my twhirl window to the front. :-(
Of all the apple stores I frequent (Pasadena, Sherman Oaks, Glendale) the Pasadena folks are the most professional.
There are some crazy sundogs but I don't think I can get pics.
Grrrr, not seeing Dark Knight till tomorrow :-(  Oh well.
@ponzarelli I've never tried in safari but when I get that message on FF I just refresh and it has followed them.
@seanbonner thanks for saying your car charger doesn't work.  Mine didn't either and I thought it was just me.
@ijustine ours were room temp. & my bf actually ended up in the ER that night w/stomach problems.  Not sure if related, but just sayin'...
Hopefully seeing Dark Knight tonight, do you have to remember the first one to see this one? If so, I have to find a copy and watch, FAST!
how come twhirl is saying I'm over my limit??
@megfowler re: fish pedis ew ew ew ew ew...not even sure they are sanitary even though they change the water, guess it's like the ocean.
@megfowler those who need to be aware, are.
@megfowler with my latest position it's becoming more so, but w/past positions, definitely not
@zaren then there ya go!!
@zaren I'd say Chinese, but probably not the healthiest or cheapest.
why all these spammers following me this a.m.?  The twitter article or something?
wondering what I'm doing wrong in facebook, it looks the same to me...
@st3phen I think a lot of folks wanted to be able to say they had a release title, so it might slow down now for awhile.
I have someone, who is probably a spammer, following me...but his two tweets are entertaining so far...might let him slide for a day or two.
Good night fellow tweeters!
@frojive It depends on how hot you normally run.  Take some tylenol, 98.6 is normal.
@Scobleizer used ziplinq end for USB and tried to charge my iPhone & it never registered as charging. but the light was red. need spcl 1?
@Jbot6000 so it's not hard to find tix? I didn't even try, didn't want lines or headaches!!
@buzzbishop r u inside ? (need wifi on) Outside? In settings/general - r ur location svcs on? Did you reset location warnings? good luck!
waiting for phone to sync...just want to go get groceries before I change my mind again...grrrr, why does it take so long to back up?
@nateritter sweet! Thanks!
@nateritter re: ping.fm - have any to spare? You can't even send an email to get on the list anymore!
@Viss That was going to be my first pick (gordon) but then I just figured I'd post what I did!
@Viss I think the joker will be overplayed this year...
@zaren That is a great show!!  The bf hooked me on it.
@iAlbert I hate it when that happens!! Usually its when I'm in a hurry and can't let the seat/steering wheel cool down!
@zaren Ohhhh yummy!  I'm making my Grandma's white beans so I need the broth, 2 lazy now, but it does need to cook awhile so I should go!
@zaren I feel sorry for kids like that.
Need to go get chicken broth and some other groceries...I could walk, but then I always get too much and can't carry it all back!
@dustydean 1 sort of hard.  I had to use one of those grippy things- still didn't work.   I got cuts and sore/red marks from the lids!!
@dustydean heehee, 2 long.  I actually gave up on 1 of them and had my bf open it.  Not sure what was up w/them!! 1 was easy, 1 impossible!!
@dustydean for the iPhone? 2.5 hrs.  In line 1 hr. before the store opened, 1.25 hrs once it opened, 10-15 min. in the store.
My poor fingers are all cut up and sore, opening Gatorade bottle isn't easy!!
and I'm most certainly not going to run all over town for one, it's not an iPhone after all...lol
Sheesh, my local target is out of the Wii Fit already and they've only been opened two hours.  Wonder if people looked at the ad last ni ...
It's national ice cream day! Enjoy an ice cream at www.dillydairy.com if you're in #central California near #Fresno.  Store is in #Selma, CA
@craignewmark I'm just getting weirdness when I try to go to twitter on the web, your picture shows up on twhirl.
@dustydean and my b-day since it sounds like you are talking about October!
Want to go to bed but the bf is playing w/the App store and keeps asking me questions or telling me about cool apps so I want to stay up!
wow those #twinkle folks are QUICK to reply to problems/issues with their iPhone app! Kudos to them.
@Brusko is someone actually replying to you because it's not me.  I don't know who you are.  But it seems you're carrying on a conversation.
@gapingvoid retweet: saw a condom (unwrapped) by the register. very dirty restaurant, but the only thing open late.
I think I am getting someone else's tweets via twinkle...very strange.
@Brusko I'm getting your tweets & am not too sure who you are. I'm not replying either. Strange!
@iAlbert yeah it kinda freaks me out...good to hear that I'm not the only one! Guess I'll just search for names if I want to find friends!!
how safe is it to give facebook your yahoo and gmail logins to find friends you might know??
@scottsigler that happens when FedEx doesn't know how to leave a tag so you can contact them to hold it for pick up...more w/UPS but still.
Is the "find people you email" link safe on FB? It wants my password for my yahoo acct.
I really want to try twinkle, I really want to use it and like it...but it won't save my password!!!
Got my nails shorter, didn't help my typing though!
@buzzbishop I used exposure to view them, but I haven't found anything that I can use to upload them yet.
another article I found from  this year re: iPhone insurance http://tinyurl.com/6n8g9k
@mikekochansky from what I can find, they are articles from last year and it's "personal articles" ins. for phones over $400. $32/yr. YMMV
@mikekochansky my bf read (I'll try 2 find it) that state farm was selling ins for the phone, if u had their homeowners/renters it's covered
@mikekochansky I'll be curious as to the answer you get as I bought mine at AT&T too.
@Orbitcast radio, and XM/Sirius too.  BUT you have to be on wifi from what I've seen, so I can still take my XM more places since I have 2go
Now I don't really want starbucks, I want lunch! LOL
@guykawasaki http://twitpic.com/4dd5 - I'm reading Sin in the Second City right now!  I found it because of a book by Eric Larson.
@Trigeia yeah, the knife sharpening doesn't always return a smooth looking pencil either!
@Trigeia That's one way to do it! I've done it w/a knife before, never thought of a scissor!
I think it's gonna be tough to get tickets to the Dark Knight if I haven't already gotten them :-(
@robinbloor I'm half Armenian, I love that!
I am starving...maybe I should walk down to starbucks...
@seanbonner that is hilarious! I haven't heard that sound in awhile, and frankly didn't want to again!!
Getting my oil changed. Low oil light went on this morning!
@andymatic My Mom mentioned the movie this morning and now the song is going through my head too!!
People still in line down the block for the iPhone in Pasadena...
@zaren Happy Birthday!!! May the day bring fun and happiness with your friends and family!
@ryankuder I'm already tracking working out and weightloss in Zealog, may as well add pushups too!
Wii sports resort sounds fun!!
I'm going to have this song stuck in my head for days now. (airship pirates by abney park)
@jowyang that was cute!
@michellelentz more than twitteriffic?I am trying 2 decide.
I love the BSG twitters! My bf worked on the mini-series and still has shots in the show/intro!
We were just talking about "Dark Crystal" the other day and now it's on Cinemagic for a Cinemagic moment!
I didn't know whole foods was on twitter.  Thanks @ev for announcing lunch plans! LOL  I really need to learn how to search for folks/things
There is still a line outside the Pasadena Apple store. Only to H&M this time, not Tiffany's.
@Scobleizer I love that game! (Tap Tap Revenge)  Is there a way to use your own songs to play?
@nateritter yes
XM 44 - Fred has been playing some good tunes today!
@toonlet Glendale's store was the same way!
People r still in line at the Pasadena Apple store!
G'nite twitterers!
Nuts, I see fluff under the screen cover on my phone! Luckily they're hard 2 scratch!
@ryanaraine black!
g'nite twitterers!!
I'm actually trying to get my phone to die & it won't!
The weather app that comes with the iPhone = FAIL! Temp is totally wrong.
Playing Aurora Feint! It is addictive!!
a ton of channels & I can't find anything I want to watch.  At least Joe Gets on Current is always good for a laugh, but I missed 1/2 of it!
@zaren Yeah that might get old I'd think...but I don't have one at all so I'm a tad jealous!
@zaren It's Saturday night - Rock Band!!
@zaren mine too! Glad it's not just me at least.
The Glendale Apple store decided to only be open to iPhone purchasers for 2 days. Boo. At least the Pasadena store was open 4 all business!
@dustydean oh wow, take care of yourself!  It can be dangerous out there
@WomenWhoTech oh my goodness, the nerve!! I'd love to see a picture of him...even if he is all that, what a jerk!!
@mashable because it's a fun experience!!
@BizGirl I don't get it either, then hard working, paying folks get screwed by those w/no sense of responsibility.
Uh oh, they have garage buy for the iPhone...
@missrogue they have it for the macbook pro and macbooks too!  called macsabre. Fun there too!
and the owl hooting in the background made it really creeeeepy!
Love how my neighbors play Gregorian chants at 8:30 a.m., not that I don't like them...but I don't need to hear them from someone else.
@mikekochansky super monkey ball of course!
Do I have to buy the full twitterific to not see the public timeline? Or is that an added bonus?
Sweet!! I got my iPhone! The lines were crazy but we got some!!
g'nite all!
need to get some sleep so I can get in line early for the iphone!
@michellelentz @michellelentz thanks for the tip! I will!!
I have multiple clocks all showing multiple times... anywhere from 3:03-3:08...maybe I should fix them!
grrr I want to delete someone who is following me and I can't find them on the list!
G'nite twitterers, the last few nights have been late for me, maybe not today!
@zaren re: traitors totally true.  I know my representatives from the house said they wouldn't vote for it...and then what did they do???
@zaren gee great (sarcasm abounds) re: FISA...I won't pass this to my bf, it'll make him furious!
why is someone that I've blocked still showing up in my followers w/the "unblock" option?
been too busy today to even look at any of this! Hi all
@mikekochansky that was funny!
wow, lots of twitters today! I can't keep up!
@iAlbert I would say yes it is.  I can't navigate away from the page I'm on.
@zaren I hate it when that happens!! Then you can never replace it, although the bf laughs when I get the same thing in many colors!
Nuts, it looks like I'll have to go to an AT&T store, I hope they have enough phones...
@zaren I like the hat!
the iphone that is!
bf is saying I should go to the AT&T store for my phone since I have a corp. discount that is good till mid-2009.  Thoughts?
@zaren haha yeah I thought about that, but he's on at weird hours, and I don't want to stay up that late!
@zaren hahah it's actually to help a friend who is unhappy w/his mac, so I can see what he is doing wrong.  I'll tell him. I have snapz pro.
@zaren That was exactly the command I was looking for!! Thanks!!
@michellelentz Thanks!! I really love mine. My bf uses them,  so I was around them before I got mine.  My first computer was an apple IIc!!
@michellelentz Leave it  2 Apple 2 have something good enough already built in!  My friend hates his mac so far, this might help him like it
@michellelentz good to know! I'm not thrilled w/snapz but it was in macheist. I use snag-it for work since they're buying! I like it a lot.
@michellelentz Thanks!! I have snapz pro but my friend is a new mac user and struggling.  He needs help & wants me to help via screen shots.
does anyone know the keyboard shortcut for screen capture/grab? I have a program, one of my friends doesn't and I know there's a shortcut
Good night twitterers, going to watch next design star then go to bed!
@st3phen could very well be. I know I've given a few a chance and then taken that privilege away when I saw what they posted.
@st3phen only your first? Wow, you're lucky.  I did 3 today alone!  And they certainly weren't my first.
@dacort thanks for all the info!! makes me feel better using the app!
@dacort good to know! I saw "bookmark" and thought "web" and didn't like that the passwords would be "out there" LOL thanks!
and then firefox promptly crashed lol
whew, got rid of all the open windows...means I read everything I opened (or bookmarked for later!)
@dacort I want the iphone, but not too crazy about storing passwords on the web.  I have windows at work, so I will have 2 sync 2 programs.
@dustydean I do love cucumbers but didn't have any today, maybe next time!
@dacort do you like 1Password more? I currently use keepassX  & have it on windows and my phone, but I have 1Password too from macheist.
@dustydean yum yum!! I'm having salad...feel like a rabbit!
@Viss I keep getting that clickaudit one.  I've blocked it 3 or 4 times.  What else is weird is one of my blocks is showing in list still.
what would be cool is if you could tell someone why you're following them...I follow folks I found from others who are interesting.
@zaren ok thats what I've been doing.  I can see them in twitteriffic, so I was hoping! Thanks!
@dacort or open past 5!  Had that when we visiting Australia. Can't imagine living there & having to plan,  not being used to it in the US
@zaren agreed! And I still haven't figured out how to do it in twitteriffic!!
law & order (any version) and NCIS marathons are going to ruin my life! LOL
the people in front of us were annoying..we got there 2 hrs early so they could stand in front of us, block our view & talk through the show
@dustydean heehee, ok so I need to call the rose bowl, their pyro guys, I don't necessarily need anyone else around other than the bf, SWEET
looking at everyone's fireworks pics, I wish I'd taken more, but I wasn't feeling too spiffy...can I do July 4th over?
Is there a way to open links in the same browser in Twhirl? I have so many windows open now because each opens a new browser window.
good night twitterers!!
@genecyber I'd like a recipe bot
wow, not a lot of posting going on...
@alexknowshtml haha, I'd love a little Mo of my own!
4th pics posted http://www.flickr.com/hkdkat
well, the fireworks were longer two years ago,  but some of them were better this year. The colors were amazing!  Thanks Rose Bowl!!!
just read the engadget about folks lining up already for the iPhone...you've got to be kidding me...I don't want it that badly.
and so we can get lunch!
wish the bf would get out of the bathroom so I could dry my hair LOL
tryng to figure out tweetdeck...
need to get bf moving so we can have some lunch!
@scobleslinkblog I think it's a distraction...it didn't seem that user friendly to me.  I like Twitter!!
oh well, guess I can log into the web version if I want to see them again for any reason.
nuts, I hit the trash button on twhirl and now my dm's and @'s are gone!
@dustydean until 5:00 p.m. here, psycho right now, vertigo, the birds, rear window ( that's all I saw).
Need to go charge my batteries for fireworks picture/video taking fun tonight!
Can I just say again how much I love twhirl??
Alfred Hitchcock on TCM!!! Yeah!!!
probably should have breakfast first though
@dustydean Yeah I'm wondering why I'm awake too!! I might go back to sleep!
@techjunk hahah, just as I'm hopefully about to get an iPhone, they get a win mobile app.
Happy 4th of July, Twitterers!!
wow, finally a client that works for me...so far so good and lots of cool options!  Hope I can put this on the iphone!!
@ericjodom love it! very slick looking.
@zaren hopefully, but since it's so easy to jailbreak gen 1, I think that is what is holding the price high and steady!
@zaren I'd see if Rit has a bleaching kit.  I used to use their product to tie dye shirts! http://www.ritdye.com/home.lasso
@zaren I've heard they're $600-800 now on ebay! I don't want to pay that much for a used phone. They could have dropped it in the toilet!
I'm hoping there are enough iPhones to go around w/all the people who have one wanting to recycle...I just want my first one!!
@LAist how can I submit a rant about parking fees at the Sherman Oaks Galleria?
@mashable I don't understand how the pump know the price you paid. Isn't it just going to fill your tank at the price shown? So you lose $$?
@LAist thanks! I now just added a ton of books to my amazon wish list so that I can hike, walk, eat, and do a bunch of free stuff in L.A.!
@iAlbert your ice cream looked like it was on fire in that pic!
@Scobleizer haha, CA native here too and never been to Alcatraz! I've seen it!
listening to Bitter:Sweet! Hopefully I'll be able to see them when they're in L.A.
just can't get used to any client for twitter, maybe when I get my iPhone.
RE: Adium/ICQ @tarasis I saw this this morning, but when I tried to go to pidgin.im it wouldn't load....
just got my hair cut, so I feel like I've eaten hair!!
what do I have to enable to use adium for facebook chat?
is anyone else having trouble w/adium and ICQ?
@brianshaler wouldn't it be nice if the iphone transaction went that quickly? HA!
I got red on my fingers and toes today! Yeah!! I'd had a french manicure for awhile on the fingers and I was tired of it.
Getting my hair cut tomorrow!!! Yeah!! It's about time, I'm a couple of weeks late because my stylist hurt her knee and was out for a bit!
why can I only go back 2 pages now? Twitter please fix that!!
Is twitteriffic better when you buy it?
wondering if putting all of my contacts into the address book on my mbp is a waste of time or if it'll make it easier when I get my iphone??
hopefully time for lunch, need to the bf movin'!
Need to find a way to convince the bf that we should go to the sawdust festival one of these weekends!  I've been before and it's great fun!
I need to go get a manicure but I'm too lazy to make the appointment!
Wow they're already discounting the kindle? Doing that well, eh?
I get frustrated when I can't go back beyond the first page...that means there are so many I missed!
@meta_robert It actually turned out to be a problem w/my whole igoogle page.  I closed firefox down, opened it again and it works! Thanks!!
@Pedal I put the soap in, run the water, then the clothes...that way the soap doesn't concentrate on one piece of clothing.
wondering why I can't get betwittered to work.
wow I got rid of 13 followers and I sort of got the hang of what @zaren suggested, however I attempted to do it when Twitter was down! LOL.
Watching Axis of Evil Comedy Tour - they are HILARIOUS!!!
One of our favorite Italian Mom 'n Pop shops is gone...we just went to get pizza and it's cleared out and for lease w/no signs 4 new place!!
@kevinrose I was going to ask if you were serious re: Jared when I read the low fat condiments donation but then I thought well maybe so?
@kevinrose lol not new but didn't understand what it was, figured it out on my own.
@st3phen retweeting since I don't know if you saw my post last night but I  hope you picked Roughnecks as my bf was director of photography!
@zaren I will have to try that out! Thanks! Now it's time for bed though :-)
@zaren I just wish there was an easier way to do it!  I'd knock off more...but after 2 or 3 I get tired of doing it!
My # of followers is going down but I just can't let spammers follow me.
@missrogue I just thought it meant unavailable, my boss usually uses the term when he's not going to be able to be reached (phone, net, etc)
@megfowler sounds yummmmy! We're trying to figure out what to have for dinner too.
@st3phen Definitely Roughnecks! My bf was director of photography for it!
twitter earrings? http://tinyurl.com/62zlyc ok maybe not, but birds at least.
oh well! g'nite fellow twitterers.  morning comes early! and quickly.
I put those protection films on my trackpad for my mbp and I can't get them off!!! They're supposed to come off w/tape, but they're not!
I can't wait for the iphone, I'm trying to install something on my 8125 and there is no more space!!
I sooooo want coffee but I don't have a car and don't really live close enough to walk anywhere! :-(
well and get some ice cream too! #Fresno
For some of the best ice cream in the Central Valley, stop by www.dillydairy.com and say hi! #Fresno
We are geeks, the bf and I are sitting here, him w/his blue mbp, me w/my red, computing away!
Goodnight fellow twitterers.  Going to go read for a bit.  See you tomorrow!
Does anyone use a special app to show their flickr pics on facebook? If so, what do you suggest? Don't want to show private pics though.
@iAlbert Thanks! We'll do just that! We saw Get Smart and it was very funny! I can't wait for Wall-E as some of my friends worked on it!!
@alexknowshtml I understand, w/me it's friends w/kids talking about kid stuff....
Seriously, why am I having so much trouble w/facebook tonight?
@iAlbert worth seeing though or not?  One of our friends wants to and we don't...
I keep installing and uninstalling twiterriffic, what am I doing wrong? It's not working...
Well I'm a sleepy camper, time to hit the sack.  See you all tomorrow!
@jowyang the "here" that I neglected to specify is Pasadena, CA.
Why does twitterific show my dm's every time I log in??
@jowyang you said it was 88 degrees 4 hours ago (10:30 here now) it is 88 degrees right now, 100 at 6:00 p.m. (4 hrs ago) for me. #weather
@iAlbert I'll raise my hand too! I don't want to do twitter texts and have it start costing a bazillion $ on the iphone!
which is why it took me days to reply to @zaren lol
I think twitterific is only good if I'm constantly staring at my computer and I'm not...I usually have to go back 10 pages to catch up.
Have to work tomorrow and we're going to get up in an hour or so to see if we can see the launch from Vandenburg so I probably should sleep.
playing w/spore...oh no!
@zaren sorry I missed your iphone post from awhile ago but yes I am.  I pay 99 right now w/a discount, it'd be over 100 otherwise.
Just downloaded twitterific, have to see if I get used to it or not.
@dsearls Read about what you're going through, keep your chin up and best wishes!
@TheDisneyBlog Dell
too tired to catch up on twitter, just gonna catch some zzzz's!
I have a headache, I think coffee will cure that!
The day just SPEEDS by when I have so many meetings.
@chrispirillo I usually feel sorry for them and let it pass.
@LAist I still miss John Mauceri but I'll give a new guy a chance!
something smells like manure (sp?) around here...yuck!!
@mikekochansky we've been seeing a lot lately too...not sure it makes me feel good, just wondering what they're up to!
@mikekochansky I didn't realize I might not even be ELIGIBLE for the phone.  I just checked and I'm eligible. I have no contract now.
@mikekochansky and this one too http://tinyurl.com/y9dmp2
@mikekochansky http://tinyurl.com/2u5p2u and  http://tinyurl.com/svnmw
@mikekochansky till 2009 I think.  Not Verizon though.
@mikekochansky I'm trying to find an article on it but it was GSM and iDEN phones so it was Cingular, T-Mobile and Nextel (at the time)
How did my windows get set up to receive updates automatically? How do I turn that off? I don't want them chosing when to update my computer
@mikekochansky isn't there a law that they technically have to unlock it for you? At least Cingular/AT&T and T-Mobile are part of that deal.
@mikekochansky I used to have to pay for text msgs and then all of a sudden it was gone from my bill, so I'm going to say it's included.
I think a comparable plan will be less.
reading the article about the iphone prices, I'll still be paying less for the plan than I do now...depending on the plan. I pay a lot now.
@dacort lol I've never been capable of using a map, so it's a good thing for me!
grrrr I can't find my plug for my mbp, good thing I know where the bf's is!  Hopefully we won't want to be charging at the same time!
Saw Hulk, liked it!!
Might go see Hulk tonight...good thing I like Ed Norton because the last movie was hooooorrrrrible!
you need an internet connection for delicious library, duh!!! I can't get one on my personal computer here at work. LOL.
Is getting a pic on Flickr's interesting pics of the day just a numbers game (well and obviously a good pic)
Just got home from the beach, what a beautiful day!  I'll have to post some flickr pics.  Link coming soon.
@mikekochansky Definitely black, is the 16 available in white? I didn't really look, could you imagine how dirty a white phone would get?!
crazy weather, it was warm today and now tonight I have a sweatshirt on!! But I love it!
@zaren Yeah I can't believe we couldn't find it anywhere on the news last night when it was happening (re: Kucinich post)
@goaliegirl Congrats and good luck!!!
loopt is creeeeepy
is there a chat client for the iphone or is everything sms based?
@megfowler not smart, I know...but I try pencils, closed pens, scissors...just need an extension.
Not that thrilled w/the announcement but I'll probably still get one. (the iPhone of course.)
Yeah!!!!!
@mikekochansky Very cool! Thanks for the link.
@mikekochansky my guess is next week given that the mandatory no vacations start next week for both apple and at&t.
The search for the Wii fit was fruitless today but I won't give up!
@dustydean Thanks! Will do.  A lot of my friends have them already but they won't share their secrets!
In search of a wii fit!!
@buzzbishop pregnant man pic ='s ewwwww
*shew* just finished going through my email accounts and deleting what I didn't need from May.  I'm still such a pack rat though.
I did it, I'm finally on facebook so I can read all the posts that are "facebook" only...well that's not why I did it, just a side benefit.
Grrrr, can't find a Wii fit and they sold out on Amazon BEFORE they said we could supposedly order them.  Wonder when I'll be able to get 1?
@zaren That's EVEN better! I just do many pictures from any angle I can get.  My stylist is usually quite amused.
@zaren Glad to see I'm not the only one who takes in a pic.  In fact my bf liked my hair today so I took a pic for the next time I go in!
@TweetTees Nice!!! Well I'd love that!
@TweetTees I'd say embroidered, but I'd assume that's more $$, no?
How do I get a website to start showing up in search engines when I search for it? (hope I phrased that so it makes sense)
@goaliegirl Were they booing at him or Bettman?
WHEEEEEEEEE WINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ugh, happy my follower # is growing, not happy that they are spammers, one guy is following over 100,000 people.
I think I've done all I'm going to w/my website tonight.  Time for sleep for me!
Trying to find a b-day present for my boss...it's tough, I tell ya!
I voted, did you?
hmmmm where'd the follower requests go? Not that I wanted to accept any of them, mostly spammers anyhow.  Maybe because I am not private now
@mikekochansky I've always thought that when I see these long games, I'm glad to be on the west coast, at least it's still relatively early.
Oh my goodness they're never going to finish!!  I keep grinding my teeth and clenching my jaw, they just need to be done!!! w/Wings winning!
@goaliegirl I sure hope you're right, but if not, there's still another game!
You have to be kidding me...I knew I shouldn't have been watching...
Sweeeeet Go Wings Go!!!!
@dailytwitter thank you thank you!! I just saw this now, and it answered two of my questions!!
@Pedal Haha, I did that yesterday!! (walked to Ralph's to get change for laundry)
plurk is a tad bit frustrating...I can't find people.
@dailytwitter how'd you find scoble? I'm not having a good time searching on plurk!!
twitter, friendfeed, plurk, I can't keep up w/it all and I rarely look at my MySpace and don't even have FB.
@jowyang eh for NOKTB
wish I had some oj to go w/it.
mmmm scrambled eggs w/cheese, boca veggie burger and mango salsa and some flax seed/grain toast!
stinky stinky outside, had to shut all the windows then found out Universal backlot was on fire!
@megfowler indian!
definitely walk, since I'm at work a nap would be inappropriate!
@megfowler fish
It's frustrating when you only see part of the convo because you're only following 1 of the people...I guess I'm just nosey! LOL
@megfowler Definitely a hug
mmm just had a Thai iced tea, hopefully that is the "pick me up" I need to finish my afternoon of work!
Got a kernel panic (think that's the proper name for the gray screen) this morning, hope that's not a "feature" of the latest update!
Well I'm glad Twitter seems to be somewhat up and running normally again.  I now have to go to bed.  Goodnight fellow twitterers!!
OH MY GOODNESS!!! I got to page 2!!!! Yipeeeeee
@nateritter cool people make all he difference!
@nateritter I had my first a couple of nights ago...didn't like it much!
Am I ever going to be able to see more than 1 page of twitter?  sort of makes me not want to use it and I've been pretty patient/accepting.
http://tinyurl.com/59zcqz  Awesome! I already love Tarte's lip line!
@BklynWriter Not at all! When I went for my PhD there was someone in her 50's in the class, and she was the best student!!
Saw Abney Park at The Edison on Sun. night, great venue, awesome tunes, good night! www.flickr.com/hkdkat
a NASA center I guess is most appropriate
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, yanno, where they're filming from Mission Control.  It's a NASA center but the data will be analyzed at JPL/Az.
@Viss Actually it's JPL but yeah!
@acomputerpro That was GREAT!!! Love to see Iron Man protecting the Phoenix.
Eating healthier to become healthier probably does not mean eating at 11:30 at night, huh??!!
So I guess seeing beyond one page is part of some feature that isn't active right now....
oh noes!  we're buying wii points and "pop"
I thought I set up my friendfeed to post when I add something to flickr, but alas it did not, or at least not yet.  Maybe it's not that fast
Just got back from driving in the Hollywood Hills, such pretty clouds today.
@iAlbert I need to get one of those too, however I was sleeping when you were up doing yours!
@TweetTees While I don't buy a lot of t-shirts, I won't say no, as I bought the twitter one!
@kevinrose People watch!!
Got my scarf kit today!! Trying to learn how to knit!
@goaliegirl Anytime! Happy working out!
@toonlet Well enjoy! I'm on amazon's waiting list!
Everything turned out ok at the Doctor's office so far! *shew*
Wow, what crazy weather we're having in SCAL!!
@goaliegirl I haven't used any of them yet, because I use google calendar, but fitsugar has some good suggestions.  http://www.fitsugar.com/
Have to go to my doctor appt. pretty soon...I hate going to the doctor!
Hmmm, what's up w/the iCal software update, I didn't get it but my bf did.  Does Apple not like me anymore?!!
@jakemarsh If that's the same as the one in Austin, I love that place!! We have places out here w/the same name, not the same place at all!!
@hotdogsladies The most recent price change seemed to slip in there w/o people noticing.  A lady at the P.O. was giving them heck for it.
@thegizwiz Love it! That sounds like me and my bf when we  travel, minus the dish...THAT must be what we were doing wrong!  Enjoy!
@toonlet How! Where did you get wii fit??!!
A Co-worker told me my hair is very pretty today! :-D  Good thing since my bf doesn't like it, although it's growing out and getting better!
It's pretty sad when I won't enter contests anymore because I know what it does to my taxes!
I did it, I joined FriendFeed hkdkat is my name over there too.
strange, my pic was a camel for a second! LOL
I'm hooked on knitting/felting and I haven't even started yet! Cute patterns make me want to buy more! Darn you @makerfaire and @craft mag!
Sorry for the double post but I try to get rid of one and both disappear!
@zappos That is horrible! I don't even want to fly w/my personal laptop anymore...or I'm going to use fly with an one that is expendable.
So what are everyone's thoughts about Google Health? Safe, not safe? Just the terms of use alone scare me!
I hate when it feels like an earthquake here at work and it's not.
boy my computer speakers stink...not that I expected much from a work computer but geez!
