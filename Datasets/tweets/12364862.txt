@justcuzimwhite @_aloshua @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy Everyone‚Äôs voice and POV is important and worth listening to. I respect you and I value your participation in what‚Äôs going on around you. While we may disagree on we can agree we love our town. I am Democrat but am definitely not a member of any establishment. Have a nice day.
@justcuzimwhite @_aloshua @_chentte @LEGITLGMT Nah, I‚Äôm not denying that. However your perspective and perception on council are skewed. It seems whatever answer I give won‚Äôt suffice therefore these back and forth conversations will forever be at an impasse. Keep the questions coming.
@justcuzimwhite @_aloshua @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy Then I‚Äôll catch up with y‚Äôall later. Feel free to keep the questions coming. It‚Äôs a shame I‚Äôm the only member of council you‚Äôre asking. It‚Äôd be good to get plenty of different perspectives.
@stefffff92 @_aloshua @justcuzimwhite @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy What meeting are you talking about? We‚Äôve had open house nights at City Hall where no one showed up. Cudahy is a thousand times more transparent than before the scandal. Just ask @CudahyMayor
@justcuzimwhite @_aloshua @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy I never insulted you nor do I have any issues when it comes to my understanding of fiscal policy for our town. I‚Äôll be waiting to hear what day and time works for you and your friends to have a meeting at City Hall so we can answer any and all policy questions.
@_aloshua @justcuzimwhite @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy Email me here and we can schedule a meeting. cmarkovich@cityofcudahyca.gov
@_aloshua @justcuzimwhite @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy Again I‚Äôll be happy to meet up and answer these in person. I‚Äôd rather have a productive meeting than have you wait for my response while I tend to family and other duties.
@_aloshua @justcuzimwhite @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy And travel to due rise in cost of how much it costs to attend conferences. Also just because these are what is budgeted that doesn‚Äôt mean this is what we‚Äôll spend. I haven‚Äôt spent any of my travel budget in years and every year it goes back to the city.
@_aloshua @justcuzimwhite @_chentte @LEGITLGMT @HernandezCudahy I have a response. Just not strapped to twitter. Life intervenes. The only line item that went up is under contractual so if the council needs to hire a consultant we can. As you can see pay didn‚Äôt change. Medical did go up due to changes in insurance.
