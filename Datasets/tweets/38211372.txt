The only reason I think Christian Bale wasn't given the Oscar: Gary Oldman won the Oscar for playing Winston Churchill in 2017's @DarkestHour—and, therefore, Christian Bale wasn't going to win the Oscar for  playing a same transformational role in 2018's @vicemovie. #Oscars2019
In one illogically fucked-up move by @TheAcademy, the Oscar for Best Actor was shoved inside Rami Malek's "Queen" Ass. WTF? The Oscar for 2018's Best Actor belonged to Christian  Bale for his chameleonically masterful portrayal of Dick Cheney in Vice. @vicemovie #Oscars2019

@GoldDerby Christian Bale deserves to win the Best Actor's Oscar for Vice. @TheAcademy @vicemovie #ChristianBale
@RoshanOpinion PTI-led Government, for sure. PML-N Government sucked, so did their relations with India. PML-N did their best to weaken Pakistan from within. The armed forced of Pakistan know the blunders PML-N did during its government.
@RoshanOpinion 0%, or even -0% in some cases.
@RoshanOpinion Yes, what's not there to believe. It's all Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi's douchebaggery.
@voxdotcom Rami Malek was good in @BoRhapMovie but not anywhere as good as Christian Bale was in @vicemovie. And why has Bohemian Rhapsody won the Oscar Nomination for Best Picture? @ROMACuaron or @greenbookmovie deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
@RoshanOpinion India, of course. However, the Indian State will have to grow a pair of balls first.
@RoshanOpinion Elements within Indian State, of course. Shame on the participants who thought otherwise. 👎👎 to the participants who surely belonged to PML-N &amp; PPP and tried defaming Pakistan. They were advancing the screwed-up agendas of their politically screwed-up leaders. Two thumbs down!
@RoshanOpinion The 12 and 17% of the participants weren't Muhib-e-Wattan, were they? Anybody in Pakistan who doesn't find Prime Minister Imran Khan's response to India as appropriate needs to get laid. The Prime Minister of Pakistan was on 🔥 and kicked Indian asses on gigantic proportions.
@RoshanOpinion Indians don't have balls to attack Pakistan, and they won't attack Pakistan. Save this comment!
@OfficialDGISPR Sir, the armed forces of Pakistan should've kicked Nawaz Sharif's ass on #DawnLeaks issue in 2016. His statement on Mumbai Attacks to journalists outside the #AccountabilityCourt in Islamabad is what India has presented as their "only" defence before the ICJ.
@CallSignONE Nawaz Sharif is a shameless motherfucker. He must be hanged upside-down and anal-fucked.

@90sWWE There will never be another Shawn Michaels, in this lifetime or another. Massive, massive respect to my favorite wrestler of all time! @ShawnMichaels
@GregLansky You, sir, deserve to be in the Hall of Fame.
@RollerTroller_ India's not Pakistan? You're right. India Sucks, while Pakistan doesn't. Indians have killed Muslims. Indians considering cows their mothers, and that's fucked-up beyond imagination. Indians have illegally occupied Kashmir. That's fucked-up too. Secular India? My ass!
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia Where have you won the discussion? You're living in an alternate dimension. As I've said, go blow Narendra Modi. And while you're at it, fuck yourself.
@thePSLt20 I've supported @IsbUnited in past PSL editions, but I'm supporting @lahoreqalandars in this edition of PSL. Reason? @ABdeVilliers17
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia I'm criticizing Modi? He's a motherfucker. I'm just stating facts that you're unable to see. As for you, you're just another Modi's ass-kisser. Kiss Modi's ass &amp; give him a blowjob while you're at it.		P.S. Modi is the murderer whose entry to the U.S. was banned some years ago.
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia Nawaz Sharif said that #PanamaPapers was an international conspiracy against him. He also said those were allegations against him. When the trial ran in the Supreme Court, there was no innocence. The court found him a liar, dishonest, &amp; disqualified him from PMship immediately.
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia That's a white-collar crime. That's exactly what Nawaz Sharif &amp; other corrupt people do &amp; have done. It's extremely difficult (but not impossible) to prosecute a white-collar criminal. Capable &amp; honest officers catch white-collar criminals. #RafaleDeal is a white-collar crime.
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia By the way, has there been a single protest against PM Narendra Modi's government? Or are the people of India afraid for what Modi &amp; his government might do to them? You, Indians, are more than a billion in population, and you can take Modi down. Do it! #RafaleDeal #RafaleScam
@RollerTroller_ @INCIndia Then consider the issue dead, Mr. Judge &amp; Expert. Millions of Pakistanis protested on roads &amp; streets when PM Nawaz Sharif &amp; his family members' names appeared in #PanamaPapers. The protest turned gigantic, &amp; this made the Supreme Court of Pakistan take notice. Rest? We all know!
@INCIndia Shouldn't The Supreme Court of India exercise moral jurisprudence for PM Narendra Modi's #RafaleDeal? Therein lies corruption &amp; corruption only.		P.S. Follow The Supreme Court of Pakistan's route. The court delved into PM Nawaz Sharif's #PanamaPapers matter &amp; disqualified him.
@INCIndia Indians, please do not let this issue fade into oblivion. If probed correctly, PM Narendra Modi will be found guilty of corruption and misuse of authority. Mark my words! #RafaleDeal #RafaleScam #RafaleVerdict

@Mssweetcreature Finally, he doesn't restricts himself to noses. He goes far beyond noses - and transforms himself into an all-body lovemaking specialist.
@Mssweetcreature Moreover, he's known as "the seduction specialist." Girls lose control over themselves as soon as he hypnotizes them. He's a modern-day legend, a lovemaking guru.
@Mssweetcreature That's not the point. The point is, look at the girl's face. Her expressions are matchless. She wants to enjoy the moment, yet she's afraid and shy.

@TheMeeraJee Tell me, how was the video fake? Fake videos cannot be created anywhere in the world. Yes, there's CGI and Special Effects stuff but the video you featured in was being filmed on some VGA-quality camera. It wasn't as if a hidden camera filmed you.
@AapaZubeda You're tweeting as if she died today. If you want to rename the account now, why didn't you rename it the day she died?
@TheMeeraJee What happened to your movie with Universal Studios? Did the studio sign you or not? If signed by Universal Studios, who'll be the actor? Captain Naveed? He deserves to be the actor because he made you say, "Bas Karo Naveed, Main Thak Gayi Hoon." Yes, Captain Naveed is that good!
@TheMeeraJee Will Captain Naveed be the actor in your film? The reason I want Captain Naveed in your film is that he nicely performed in a movie you filmed in a hotel's room. You shouted, "Bas Karo Naveed, Main Thak Gayi Hoon." Yes, he's that good and deserves to be the actor in your movie.

@munirahmedap Sir, Imran Khan will make the speech you want him to make in his first address to the nation soon. However, Imran Khan's speech yesterday was exactly what it had to be. He has to fulfill his promises, one of them being strict accountability against corrupt and corruption.
@CynthiaDRitchie Ma'am, Imran Khan had mentioned the martyrs during victory speech. Well, it has to be beyond simple mentions. Imran Khan can actually do something for the people who lost their lives during general elections. Bilawal Zardari can simply mention the people at best.

RT @MehrTarar: Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi	Prime Minister of Pakistan	2018-2023
@MehrTarar Good angrezi, ma'am? That was conversational-level English at best. Plus, what was the need to mix English with Urdu? He should've chosen either English or Urdu. Instead, he spoke in Eng-Du.		P.S. Oratory skills do not matter without substance.
Additionally, what's been Pakistan People's Party's progress in Sindh in the last ten years? Nothing! There's been lack of food, water, education, and health facilities. Why are the children dying in Thar? Can Bilawal Zardari drink a same glass of water as the Sindhi people? NO!
Tell me a single achievement of Bilawal Zardari. Is there any? No, there isn't one. What has Bilawal Zardari ever done for a living? Nothing. And then he says he inherited all of his wealth from his mother, Benazir Bhutto. What's this fuckery?
Does anybody remember Bilawal Zardari's speech after Benazir Bhutto's murder? He was so fierce about the whole situation. He was hell-bent on catching and punishing the murderers. What happened? Why weren't the murderers caught? Who was the beneficiary of the situation?
Moreover, Bilawal Zardari has been in politics since Benazir Bhutto's murder. What has he done about the murder of his mother? His father ran the federal government for five years. Why couldn't the Pakistan People's Party solve the mystery behind Benazir Bhutto's murder?
Shame of the people praising Bilawal Zardari's speech. What language was the speech in? English? Urdu? Why did he mix both languages? Nobody has the answer. The person who wrote his speech probably sucks at the mastery of either language. Hence, the speech in Eng-Du. 👎
@ImranKhanPTI is not the @realDonaldTrump of Pakistan; however, Khan shares one thing with Trump. By the end of their tenures, both Khan and Trump will have fulfilled their promises to the people during their election campaigns. #PrimeMinisterImranKhan #ImranKhan #Trump
@KhurramHusain As usual, the TC continues. Shame on you! If Bilawal Zardari sounds like a head of state to you, why don't you adopt him as the head of your family? He'll father you better than the real head of your family.

@abidhussayn Were the MI and ISI officers the only ones in the JIT to 'spice it up'? Understand the humor, people. The Chief Justice of Pakistan just trolled the media. The truth is that the final JIT report found the Sharif family guilty. All six departments signed the final JIT report.
@AmberRShamsi Even if the Islamabad High Court provides some sort of relief to the Sharif family, NAB will appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Even if some relief is provided, it won't last long. Don't forget the other references. More punishments to follow!
@AmberRShamsi If the money were clean, where's the money trail? And who in the sanest state of his mind would believe Qatari fairy tale. We're talking about millions and billions here. If the flats belong to the Sharif family, present the appropriate money trail. That's it.
@AmberRShamsi Why couldn't Nawaz Sharif recognize his uncle during investigation by the JIT? Because he was one of the front-men who laundered money when Nawaz Sharif made some Economic Act of 1992. It was when the money was laundered abroad and the flats were purchased. In 1992/1993.
@AmberRShamsi Why did Nawaz Sharif lie as the Prime Minister of Pakistan in National Assembly and National TV? Why didn't he do a press conference with all appropriate documents? Why were the fake documents submitted to the JIT? Why haven't Ishaq Dar &amp; Nawaz Sharif's sons escaped their trials?
@AmberRShamsi What about the entire Sharif family's statements? No statement matched the other. If any pressure was applied to the Sharif family during investigations by the JIT, why don't the Sharif family go to the Supreme Court to make the recordings public?
@AmberRShamsi What do you think, by the way? What about Rehman Malik's report as an FIA officer on the flats? What about BBC's documentary on the flats? What about Imran Khan's protest in front of these flats in 1998? What about Kulsoom Nawaz's admission to Guardian that the flats were theirs?
@AmberRShamsi Was Nawaz Sharif able to provide the money trail of the Avenfield apartments? No. It's very easy to know the cost of purchase, by the way. It's easy to know the current value and the value when the flats were purchased.

@sherryrehman Mr. Saqib Nisar has laid the foundation for water reservoirs, which PPP and PML-N didn't during their 10-year tenure. He has given the direction to the government and people of Pakistan. That's about dams. What would you say about Karachi's garbage and children's death in Thar?

@MahrukhQureshi @SalmanKNiazi1 @HniaziISF This "laanti" aurat is a patwaran. She says she's a mother but complains about lack of sex in her life almost every day.

@Khan_Inam1 It doesn't matter what anyone says. It doesn't matter what NAB says. It doesn't matter what the defendants say. What matters is the money trail, the "real" money trail. If Nawaz Sharif doesn't have it, then the accountability court's proceedings will go against him.

@gulbukhari Lastly, Maryam Nawaz is the beneficial owner of Avenfield Apartments, London. Moreover, all the offshore companies &amp; properties are "benamidars" and belong to Nawaz Sharif himself. Tell me, are Nawaz Sharif's children any good to earn even £5000? Nawaz Sharif 👎 &amp; Maryam Nawaz 👎
@gulbukhari In addition, how will Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz deny the JIT report? Both the father-daughter duo will have to provide real, authentic documents before the judge of the Accountability Court. But the real documents will always remain hidden. Jail sentences -&gt; 100%
@gulbukhari The Accountability Court will not give the verdict that suits your wish &amp; will. By the way, if Nawaz Sharif &amp; Maryam Nawaz had any money trail and proof of their properties, would they have landed in the Accountability Court? Think!
@gulbukhari The Accountability Court's verdict will be according to the law of Pakistan. If Nawaz Sharif can provide proper money trails of his companies &amp; offshore companies, he can escape jail. If Maryam Nawaz can give a proof of the authenticity of her trust deed, she can escape jail too.
@gulbukhari I hate to break it to you but both Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz are going to jail. Maryam Nawaz will go to jail for submitting fake, forged documents. Nawaz Sharif will go to jail for not submitting proper money trails of the properties &amp; offshore companies under investigation.
@PTI_VF Thanks! 👍👍
@PTI_VF Nawaz Sharif dictation toh nahin lega lekin commission zaroor lega. That's what the hashtags should be today: #DictationNahinCommission or #DictationNahinCommissionLoonga
@PTI_VF It's what Maryam Nawaz tweeted today regarding Nawaz Sharif's 25-year-old speech: "Dictation Nahin Loonga." We know Nawaz Sharif doesn't take dictation, however, he takes commission through the projects PML-N invests in. That's what I wanted to say: Dictation Nahin Commission.

@TheNatlInterest By the way, saying Pakistan possesses 120 nuclear weapons is an understatement. The number is huge, dozens more than 100s. Pakistan develops nuclear weapons at will and has developed a huge number of catastrophic nuclear weapons capable of causing India's extinction.
@TheNatlInterest Pakistan's nuclear weapons act as deterrence against India's nuclear weapons. There's no way Pakistan will use its nuclear weapons first. However, Pakistan will happily use its nuclear weapons if India goes ahead.
@STMalik_ @MaryamNSharif It's the 'woman' card she's playing. And it's the same card Ayesha Gulalai has played so far.

Nawaz Sharif's questions have been answered by The #SupremeCourt of Pakistan today. #Godfather #SicilianMafia #تمہیں_اس_لئے_نکالا
The #SupremeCourt of Pakistan just murdered Nawaz Sharif's political yearnings. Thanks, tons, apex court. #Godfather #NawazSharif
If #SharmeenObaid Chinoy sees a Facebook 'friend request' as sexual harassment, she likely sees (and uses) her two 'Oscars' as her sex toys.

I hope Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy lets the fired-doctor make another baby (his 5th) with her sister. The doctor deserves it! #SharmeenObaid
@Office_AQPk @Natsecjeff Hell is waiting for a slut named Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy. #SharmeenObaid
@Office_AQPk @Natsecjeff This one, actually, banged the fuck out of Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy. This one is ours truly, Harvey Weinstein. #SharmeenObaid sucks!
@BhittaniKhannnn Why doesn't the United States drone these ISIS motherfuckers out of the earth? They can be targeted clearly and easily.
@FarhanVirkPTI That's so fucked-up. #SaveEdhiFoundation
@AamirLiaquat I'm sure Harvey Weinstein banged the fuck out of Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, except she won't admit. #SharmeenObaid
A sexual harassment involves a penis and a pussy. It certainly doesn't involve a Facebook friend request. #SharmeenObaid
@DrSaqlainSh I would like to see #AyeshaGulalai &amp; #SharmeenObaid in a lesbian-fetish porn, where the latter appears as a MILF. Both need to get laid!
@DrSaqlainSh How about adding Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy to the list of victims who were sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein? Except she won't admit...
@DrSaqlainSh Now, when the doctor has been fired from the hospital, he totally deserves to bang Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy's sister, as compensation.
@DrSaqlainSh I have seen Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy's sister's picture on Twitter. She's so ugly, even a 100-times-fucked-pussy looks more beautiful.
@saroorfiction @DrSaqlainSh Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy doesn't believe in foreplay; she likes hardcore, a quickie one.
@DrSaqlainSh Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy sucks! The doctor only wanted to befriend her sister on Facebook; he wasn't asking to fuck her. How was that sexual?
A cunt will remain a cunt. #SharmeenObaid

@MoeedNj But the Supreme Court of Pakistan is miles ahead of PML-N in this case. Finally, the Sharif dynasty will go down and mark the end of PML-N.
@MoeedNj Because the corruption has finally been uncovered. Why would PML-N accept that the JIT Report is truthful? It would be suicidal for them.

@ammarawrites Happy birthday, little angel! 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
@TomOdell You should go ask the source from anti-Islam hate-mongers. But wait? You're one of them. You DIDN'T know about Islam.
@TomOdell Block me for all I care, but I know I've wasted my time arguing with someone who lives in a parallel universe.
@TomOdell I'm not obliged to cite the source for you. Didn't you say you studied Islam for a decade or more? You should've known the source, moron.
@TomOdell Before the Crusades Islam had spread as far as Spain. You need to go to Spain to ask their people how did Islam reach there. Violence? No.
@TomOdell 5 pray at 5 different times of the day is what Islam asks Muslims to do.
@TomOdell That's why I say you have no knowledge about Islam as a religion. Islam asks Muslims to pray 5 times a day, in mosque or at home.
@TomOdell Believe me, if Muslims wanted to do as per you say, they would've accomplished that long ago.
@TomOdell Tell me, if all these sources are correct, why haven't Muslims killed all non-Muslims yet? There are billions of Muslims on earth.
@TomOdell Muslims offer prayers 5 times a day. Muslims recites Quran. These are the 2 daily religious routines of Muslims. What's violent?
@TomOdell Are these quotes even verified? That's not true at all.
@TomOdell I'll repeat: Islam doesn't call for random killings or killings of non-Muslims. But I know many use Islam as a tool against non-Muslims.
@TomOdell I'll say again: you've been engaged with materials that appealed to you. Islam preaches peace, tolerance, and humanity.
@TomOdell You have not studied Islam. Period! What you've quoted isn't even close to Islam.
@TomOdell You've read and studied the material that appeals to douchebags like you. You've posted the shitty materials from shitty existences.
@TomOdell Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) pardoned many non-Muslims during wars with unbelievers. Those who died were supposed to die 'cause they were in war.
@TomOdell First, Islam has nothing to do with violence. Second, the Quranic verses you quoted were applicable when Islam was growing as a religion.
@TomOdell I thought I could kick some sense into your decaying brain. I didn't know your brain was even ineligible for that.
@TomOdell Islam doesn't randomly orders Muslims to kill unbelievers. What you quoted was applicable when Muslims were in wars with unbelievers.
@TomOdell That's "fake news" as well as fake history, by the way. I don't know what books have you read on Islam. That's total BS.
@TomOdell Shame on you. Total, absolute shame on you. I don't know how America tolerates an intolerant, anti-Islam moron like you.
@TomOdell You need a better understanding of Islam. What you think of Islam is an agenda of yours, an anti-Islam agenda.
@TomOdell How can you blame Islam? That's so ignorant. Islam never preaches violence. Never!
@TomOdell All I know is that the fall of the Twin Towers made the American government go to war with Afghanistan.
@TomOdell There definitely were explosives hidden in the basement &amp; lower portions of the World Trade Center. That's what caused the towers to fall.
@TomOdell The origins of 9/11 attacks are shady and will remain so forever.
@TomOdell I have no agenda politics; I'm only saying what makes sense and is logical. The truth is closer to the inside job than away from it.
@TomOdell The 9/11 attack was an inside job. Is there even a doubt about it?
