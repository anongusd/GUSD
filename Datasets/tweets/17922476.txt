@TestingSaaS Right, and I'd assume it has to increase revenue by at least the $5.2 million spent on the ad. And how quickly should they make that money? Must it raise that revenue in a month, a year, five years?
Did you notice how many #SuperBowl commercials there were for #Amazon? Makes me think that the Post being owned by Jeff Bezos is relevant to why it had a Super Bowl ad.

@ggreenwald @jacobogles @cjane87 @quasimado @RLSWrites @MazMHussain @theintercept @HuffPost @NewYorker @voxdotcom @TheAdvocateMag You're focusing on how he got to Pulse, not why he decided to kill all those people. And it was partly due to his own homophobia.
@quasimado @jacobogles @ggreenwald @cjane87 @RLSWrites @MazMHussain @theintercept @HuffPost @NewYorker @voxdotcom What you've written ignores the fact Omar Mateen was homophobic. If a homophobic person kills a gay person, it's partly because of their homophobia. When this homophobic person killed dozens of queer people, it sent a terrorizing message to all LGBT people. That's a hate crime.
@ggreenwald @jacobogles @cjane87 @quasimado @RLSWrites @MazMHussain @theintercept @HuffPost @NewYorker @voxdotcom @TheAdvocateMag It's impossible to believe that Omar Mateen's homophobia didn't factor into him killing so many queer people. It sounds more like an argument that he wasn't actually homophobic?

@quasimado @SkylarJordan @cubismkris @Popcopter @SopanDeb @DrewMitrisin As the story points out, even if you don't believe a single queer witness ‚Äî and there are numerous ‚Äî it would still be homophobic. Hate crimes happen in a flash, not usually in a long, calculated plan.
If only it were a Trump official making this claim, I might not be as surprised. It's media (@HuffPost, @voxdotcom) that is supposedly progressive and intersectionally aware. https://t.co/FVG1rVhQWM
@quasimado @cubismkris @Popcopter @SopanDeb @SkylarJordan @DrewMitrisin Your story doesn't concede even this much. It should be revised.
This is the question that's bothering me most deeply: Why is it so important to some people to claim the attack wasn't homophobic? Why do some people want so badly to believe homophobia is gone? https://t.co/7L0eP9cwPa

@Popcopter @cubismkris @SopanDeb @quasimado @SkylarJordan @DrewMitrisin Right, except that‚Äôs not what @Vox or @HuffPost are saying.
@cubismkris @Popcopter @SopanDeb @quasimado @SkylarJordan @DrewMitrisin He went inside. And stayed there for 13 minutes. Then he asked someone. So, yeah, he knew who he was killing.
@leilaclaire @HeerJeet Yes, I did read that. But ISIS‚Äô homophobia warrants a bit more of a reference than, say, the National Organization for Marriage. They promote murder of LGBTs, after all.
@SopanDeb @quasimado @SkylarJordan @DrewMitrisin I have no idea why you‚Äôve quoted this line.
@HeerJeet The article is wrong. Amazingly, it doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that ISIS is well known for killing gay people. Not even a mention.
@Sheasy64 People can have healthy discussions about how much a factor it was. For those in media to assert it wasn‚Äôt a factor at all is intellectually dishonest.
@cjane87 @blakeaparker @ggreenwald Please, point me to the report on what Omar Mateen was thinking during those 13 minutes inside the #pulse, and then while he got his gun. Because that ought to factor heavily in whether he was feeling some hate toward LGBT people when he pulled the trigger.
@Sheasy64 I'm not. I'm saying homophobia played a part. And that's why many have long contended that this was both a hate crime and a terrorist attack. #pulse
@cjane87 @blakeaparker The evidence shows he skipped other opportunities to kill people. It shows he supported ISIS, which supports killing gay people. It shows he got to the gay club, spent time in it, confirmed it was a gay club, and then went on a killing spree.
@cjane87 @blakeaparker Well, as you said, that's what you "think." There's really no way for you to know that. And it shouldn't be reported as fact.
@quasimado @SkylarJordan @DrewMitrisin @SopanDeb That might explain how he got there, but it doesn't explain why Omar Mateen decided to kill those people. As you said, he'd already passed up other opportunities. Your suggestion that a supporter of ISIS was unaffected by #pulse being a gay club is based on what?
@blakeaparker @cjane87 Exactly. Perhaps to confirm that #pulse was indeed a gay bar, Omar Mateen asked the guard where all the women were. Then he killed as many people as he could.
Omar Mateen is seen on video spending 13 minutes inside #pulse before deciding to go on a killing-spree. He knew who he was killing. Here's a link: https://t.co/Un0INplEcE https://t.co/iqFIs9uzEb
Here's a reminder about what it means to be a supporter of ISIS for any @HuffPost and @voxdotcom reporters writing #pulse stories. https://t.co/mYUaenvhxp
So, media, let me try to understand this "logic." Omar Mateen had two other locations he planned to shoot up, but he passed, and it wasn't until he got to the gay club that he actually decided to kill everyone? But, that has nothing to do with homophobia? #pulse
@cjane87 He was in there a good 13 minutes. You think he didn't catch on? Is that what we're saying?
@cjane87 I'm aware of the evidence. We covered the trial. Here's video of Omar Mateen going into #pulse before deciding to kill as many people there as he could. https://t.co/Un0INplEcE
This is what people are writing right now. That #pulse was "never about LGBT people" and yet somehow inspired by ISIS, a group that throws gay people off buildings. https://t.co/JQULbY4C8R
@cjane87 Somehow you've left out a major detail, that ISIS throws people off buildings who it believes to be gay. That's pretty homophobic to me.
My response to the @HuffPost's convoluted reasoning on its latest #pulse story, which they headlined, "Everyone Got The Pulse Massacre Story Completely Wrong." https://t.co/WYsjO6khv1
@quasimado To say Omar Mateen was motivated to kill people only by his allegiance to ISIS, as if it means he didn't kill anyone out of homophobia, completely ignores the fact ISIS would throw me off a roof for being gay.

@ZackFord @Queerty That‚Äôs also where I draw the line. There‚Äôs really no need to report a person‚Äôs sexual orientation before they‚Äôve confirmed it. But I see nothing wrong with asking or noting they‚Äôve not answered.

@I_Am_Miroslava Well, based on him using the "costar approval" clause in his contract to stop Kevin Spacey from being removed ‚Äî unless he got paid $1.5 million.
@beagrie I‚Äôm not sure that whether I believe a statement is a consideration for Mark Wahlberg in deciding? But I‚Äôm flattered. He should be more deferential to Ridley Scott and Michelle Williams when making that decision.
@chadbecker777 Your claim that ‚Äúnobody cares about the next person in Hollywood‚Äù seems only to apply to Mark Wahlberg in this case. Everyone else made a different choice.
A statement from Mark Wahlberg would help clear this up? So far he's opted not to comment. https://t.co/GuqjmJt1Ls
@beagrie Everyone else on the film opted not to get paid because they wanted Kevin Spacey removed from the film. Mark Wahlberg reportedly used a "co-star approval" clause in his contract to refuse to let Kevin Spacey be replaced ‚Äî unless he was paid. I think it begs the question.
@harrycottrill1 Scandals aside? Not sure how one does that.
@beagrie I'm still crossing my fingers for a statement from Mark Wahlberg making that clear.
@TheGingerKing95 @FlightX9 "It shouldn't have taken people forfeiting their pay to get him removed."		Maybe so? But it did. And TMZ reports that everyone was led to believe they were in it together, except Mark Wahlberg secretly wasn't. https://t.co/VdesjAgVjQ
@smith_jma And, TMZ reports that director Ridley Scott (who reportedly now feels betrayed) was led to believe Mark Wahlberg had agreed to do the reshoot for free. https://t.co/VdesjAgVjQ
@smith_jma It wasn't only Michelle Williams. In this case, it's Mark Wahlberg who is the outlier. https://t.co/nKRaCOskdD
@TheGingerKing95 @FlightX9 Sounds like a perfectly rational ideal. But in this case, the film couldn't have been reshot without Kevin Spacey unless folks banded together to remove him. Would you have kept Spacey in the film?
@gunnerbeeks He absolutely did want to get paid. That's for sure. Others made a different choice so the film could be reshot without Kevin Spacey.
@Mirage_Intl @FlightX9 Do you believe Kevin Spacey should've been kept in the film?
@smith_jma Yes, he did what made him the most money. Others made a different choice.
@ezln323 Here‚Äôs how USA Today reports it. https://t.co/W1pcsBDMEq
@mikeyperk I'm asking, not concluding. What do you think? Should Kevin Spacey have been allowed to remain in the film?
@WomenWantTrump @mark_wahlberg Well, there are multiple stories about what happened. So, not "no idea." I agree people shouldn't *have* to work for free ‚Äî but the film couldn't have been reshot unless folks gave of their time, and many did, because they believed Kevin Spacey shouldn't be in the film. Do you?
@chadbecker777 Both Wahlberg and Williams were represented by the same agency. The difference between them isn't that. Michelle Williams felt it was important to reshoot the film without Kevin Spacey.
@realLucasNuka He would've been ‚Äî were it not for the multiple accusations of sexual misconduct?
@Mark0475Mark I'm not super clear on your point here? Kevin Spacey should've been allowed to stay in the film because Donald Trump is allowed to be president?
@TomNelsonAFC @TheGingerKing95 @FlightX9 The point is that the movie couldn't have been reshot if everyone asked to get paid again. Others chose a different course than Mark Wahlberg for that reason.
And here's yet another of my critics truthfully answering the question of whether they believe Kevin Spacey should have remained in #AllTheMoneyInTheWorld. Now, the same question to everyone else? https://t.co/Mtsqy7k7TH
@mommytrish2010 And let's define "a way to make" money? It was by refusing to let an actor replace Kevin Spacey in the film, according to USA Today.

@bradabez I guess I should be flattered that you know me well enough to have any expectations  at all.
@tyler_bester I‚Äôm fishing for an answer on whether he would have removed Kevin Spacey from the film, yes. My understanding is the answer is no ‚Äî at least not unless he was paid $1.5 million.
@kevinmklerks I‚Äôm really not sure what you mean here?
No, what he was inextricably using as a bargaining chip were the victims of Kevin Spacey. https://t.co/zAY7Izi0rf
@kingofnaboo Exactly. He was in a position of power as a result of sexual assault and used that moment.
@drewmaenns Would you have kept Kevin Spacey in the film?

Having Jesus Christ co-sign your Yemen mission ought to come with a high bar. #trumpaddress https://t.co/Vg63bmvQc3
@PNWShan Point taken largely. I do think it's important to consider Yemen and whether it's right for Trump to invoke Jesus on that mission.
@BrotherLiberty Well, you're welcome to offer claims, comments, opinions and facts. I do read them all.
@LjsMccully I feel pretty good, thanks. But, what's the waste of time?
@LjsMccully It is indeed something I'm thinking on. Trump used a Biblical justification for deaths in a mission he ordered. That's weighty.
@BrotherLiberty It's not feigned. I've been talking to people all day.
@PennyNowhere I think you're making a very important point about considering the mission. Was the action in Yemen just? We don't know.
@jj20101 @FJ473 It's an odd moment to invoke the "born this way" defense. But I'll take it.
@LjsMccully Trump is not God. Just to be clear.
@BlixKrogg Well, turns out you don't "have to." I've gone to church basically my whole life.
@Baptist4freedom If you believe the mission in Yemen was unjust, then you sort of also have to believe that quote from Jesus was misused.
@alexchristy17 Trump could argue his mission in Yemen was a warranted act of service. He's skipping that case and jumping to the conclusion.
@alexchristy17 Exactly my point. It's about self sacrifice in the service of Christian principles.
@PNWShan Dying or killing in a mission that is not just does nothing. Americans are owed an explanation for that mission in Yemen.
@Baptist4freedom I know what President Trump says Ryan Owens died for. What does he say this 8-year-old died for? https://t.co/Ho7URiK6Si
@Baptist4freedom In this mission, up to 30 women and children are reported to have been killed. And for what?
@Baptist4freedom I know about callings, was raised evangelical. If I'm being called, it could only be to warn you to consider the mission.
@scholbertAAL Dear Donald Trump, it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into God's kingdom.
@scholbertAAL Seems people are more willing to believe Jesus advocated death as sacrifice than giving up your wealth as sacrifice.
@scholbertAAL He described sacrifice in the terms of giving up all that you're holding onto so tightly in this life. Material things. More.
@scholbertAAL That's not what Jesus said. He told everyone to bear their burdens and follow his teachings. Not: go march to your death.
@Baptist4freedom There is indeed a lot of discussion about "just war." But it's not automatic. It depends greatly on the mission.
@Baptist4freedom I wonder if you have any doubts about the righteousness of war, and specifically of this Yemen mission.
Step 1, Trump used his inaugural to cast dissent as unpatriotic. Step 2, he used last night to cast  war as moral.
@Baptist4freedom While fear of death is needless in Christianity, I disagree this is about death literally and neither was the crucifixion.
Trump is laying the moral groundwork for his case to war.
@MississippiMama I really don't think it's literally a call to die.
@Baptist4freedom That's not about dying in battle. It's about self sacrifice.
Jesus wasn't suggesting everyone get crucified, though.
And yes: I am worried Donald Trump purposely misquoted Jesus Christ to make the case for war when Jesus was actually talking about peace.
John 15:13 (NIV): Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.
John 15:12 (NIV): My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.

@jeannemfl @SRuhle So, is that for real? The president of the @marchforlife  opposes Trump. Or, just doesn't know what the march was for?
The president of the @MarchForLife, @jeannemfl, just told @sruhle on #msnbc that she had planned to join the women‚Äôs march against Trump.
