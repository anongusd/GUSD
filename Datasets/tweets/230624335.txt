@realDonaldTrump You're a funny man..	 First you wrongly blame the Democrats in your psychological projection, and then you try and explain away US fault.		Also your wall is only 900 miles long &amp; the border is 1900 miles long, thus people imigrating illegally are simply going to change the course https://t.co/J4qA7V63oz
@realDonaldTrump Wrong these people are trying to make the trek to enter legally,  its your arrogance and ego that are killing children in our custody
@realDonaldTrump at this point we really can't believe anything you say, so I don't know why you bother to tweet. 😎
@fkatriggerman @SarahPalinUSA Well then you tend to put the cart before the horse, because a request from a government official is needed before investigation, theyve already made several arrests proving a crime was committed, &amp; your bias perceptual blindness is not proof of his Innocence,nor excuse his means https://t.co/sYokxriZxM
@SarahPalinUSA I tend to believe a judge gave them permission to investigate due to evidence, and Corsi will be disappointed with the results..
@SarahPalinUSA Haha you're funny, there's a big difference between a fence and a 5 billion dollar wall that only covers 900 miles of a 1,954 mi boarder.		  Yes the Democrats agree we need some border security under the current conditions, but we don't need a $5bil iconic false sense of security https://t.co/wcv2W8j6Y4
@SarahPalinUSA do you even have an illegal immigrant problem up in Alaska?		 Perhaps you can leave certain things to the reps who constituents affected, and stick to influencing the things you know best about..😉😎

@realDonaldTrump Regardless of your what's becoming psychological torture, this is about wasting billions of taxpayer money on a partial wall, that's nothing more than an iconic facade, and not giving in to your extortion for a false sense of security, that leaves over a thousand mi open. https://t.co/hq9Kol6Hh2
@realDonaldTrump that doesn't change the fact that it is improper for them to be political, and you offering to sign hats or having a rally is counterproductive to their protocols. https://t.co/NYyD30hSYA

@realDonaldTrump No, were not falling for your psychological violence, and aren't going to pay 5 billion dollars for a partial wall, to sooth your desire for an icon with your name on it. 		But at least you admit trying to hurt Democrats with your extorting efforts. https://t.co/pT4S3utKOX
@realDonaldTrump If our country is doing so well why is the government shutdown?	 By the way when you blame the FED for raising rates too fast, because they thought the economy is doing well. Don't forget to apologize for blowing enough hot air into it to create a bubble😕	https://t.co/S5wfb7DBha
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/w2eEXMMj0F
@realDonaldTrump Actually, you need to give it a rest, and ask for money after the portion of wall you already have money for is already built.		 Then after seeing how it's been working, the people could decide if you can extort more money for it.. 😉
@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NoradSanta Asking a 7yr old if he believes with negative reinforcement, is (Ignorantly or Arrogantly) destabilizing &amp; destroying the hopes&amp;dreams of evolving minds. 😕		I wonder if any of the kids asked him why their parents we're so upset, stressing over work&amp;paying the bills next month🤔 https://t.co/PSAz2KuVtT

@realDonaldTrump Your wall only covers 900 lineal miles of a 1,900+mi border, thus its nothing more than and iconic memorial for you, as anyone desiring to cross the border will simply go around, over, or under it.

@realDonaldTrump Well maybe if you weren't being such a child about demanding money for your incompetent wall, then the government wouldn't be shut down, you wouldn't be alone, and thousands of people wouldn't be losing money from work today..
@realDonaldTrump The only problem our economy has is Trump, he constantly thinks he can play for free, make a hole-in-one every time, and the hazards don't count for him.		 But in reality, he's still in the chipping cage, and aiming for the 19th hole. 🤣🤣
@realDonaldTrump It amazes me how you deflect everything into a blame someone else game. 		 Do you take any responsibility for your roles effect on our global society?  		  I think not, unless it becomes favorable, then it was all you..  🤣🤣

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Even if ladders and tunnels hadn't been invented, 5 billion dollars for a 900 mile wall, still leaves over a thousand miles unprotected..		You just want a historical icon with your name on it, and extorting money from the citizens for your political agenda is defined as terrorism https://t.co/VS71QTHqQ8
@realDonaldTrump Haha, of course will fight for the sovereignty of our own borders if necessary.		  But we won't be extorted from to build a 900 mi iconic wall for you. especially since the border is almost 2000 miles long and that leaves more than half of it without your so called super barrier https://t.co/aibMRIr5Ai

@donlemon the problem with Trump's less than truthful statements, is that he actually believes them and doesn't think he's lying..🤔

@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza Let's not forget the country was in the middle of the Civil War surrounding slavery, I hardly think Trump would of free the slaves, and Lincoln was ultimately assassinated.
@realDonaldTrump nice lip service there buddy, but we know you don't mean it. 		armed security guards don't belong in churches, and we don't need a militarized Society
@realDonaldTrump Bomb stuff?	  I think the people affected by this "bomb stuff" might consider this issue a little bit more significant.
@realDonaldTrump maybe people are losing interest in your violent rhetoric and bullpucky? 🤔
@ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime or perhaps a better word than the victim and circumstance, would be the center of social pity.. 😕

@WhiteHouse I'm sure the corporate world is doing great, how about the labor force, how are they benefiting from stagnant wages compared to the economy? https://t.co/FXc7Av9fSf
@trvlady @realDonaldTrump My cause is the preservation of civilized ethics, living enviornment, prodigy health, human evolution, Congressional term limits, and our highest representative position maintaining honest national leadership with enough integrity to put real live people before corporate profits.

@realDonaldTrump Haha, 	  I'd wager they aren't paid as much as you pay people to attend your rally's.. 😉
@realDonaldTrump Looks to me like they're there to protest, not cheer..
@USSenate I think you're all about to prove that occupational psychosis is alive and well in politics, questionable behavior is ok if you're in politics, and personal ethics no longer matter in our society. 		  To think how history will look back at these times is embarrassing 😕
@realDonaldTrump I believe the proper term for the choice is occupational psychosis. 😉
@USSenate You people are supposed to represent the people, &amp; be part of the nonpartisan checks and balance system that stabilizes our government.		 Instead you've allowed our government to become infected with unethical people &amp; injustices that'll negatively effect us for years😠
@SenatorCollins, @Sen_JoeManchin, @SenFlakeStaff It's a sad day in our society when we value presidential preference &amp; partisan pressure, over character and ethics.	 Considering the power &amp; term of the position, even the slightest flaw shown in character should mean a NO vote. 😡
@WhiteHouse Without a healthy environment there is distress, without fair pay there is desperation, without compassion there is fear, &amp; without mutual respect there's alway despondency within a society.		  Words are grand, but one's actions reveal both their true character &amp; intelligence🤔

@RudyGiuliani Simply the fact that he was implicated in a federal crime means he did something wrong regardless of whether or not he colluded. Then you have the obstruction issue, if the man's innocent why does he resist and obstruct the investigation, instead of letting it prove his innocence

@WhiteHouse let's examine that statement, corporate profits are at 4.1%, and allegedly wages or up 1.4.		   Seems a little unbalanced, and then you Knicks a 2.1% federal pay raise, due to the Financial situation that you created, and are still compounding.. https://t.co/y5K13yZrYZ

@realDonaldTrump Why do you have a habit of calling people who do very bad illegal things, good guys??🤔		Also, a POTUS speaking about a trial during its jury process is almost as unethical, as saying criminals are a good guys.👺		  HE DID IT TO HIMSELF, unless you helped him.😕
@realDonaldTrump When a POTUS habitually lies and attempt to obstruct Justice, there's a rational logic and ethical call, that he should be impeached and indicted

@realDonaldTrump Perhaps you shouldn't comment on things you know nothing about.. 		 As that's the stupidest statement I have ever heard anyone suggest.. 👎

@Jim_Jordan @SenSchumer SO FAR... the problem is our president is extorting money from Congress and the American people..
@AC360 The crime was Russian meddling and hacking, the question is did the Trump campaign collude with the Russians at the meeting, or over the media when Trump asked them to find Hillary's 3000 emails and they hacked in the same day.
@AC360 I'll say it again colluding is synonymous with conspiring and conspiring is a crime.
@AC360 So let me get this straight Russia was attacking our country during the time up to the election is still attacking our country now &amp; this guy thinks it's okay for a presidential candidate, to collude &amp; conspire with them, to win the election.	THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG in America

@marcorubio if the three houses won't police the ethical and moral character and behavior of the Peoples highest public servant position, than it's really the moral and ethical right of a citizen to legally protest &amp; shun the accomplices of a man who undermines our justice sys. &amp; democracy.

@Comey If you ask me, politicians charged with representing and leading, should always be vetted, scrutinized, and held accountable for their behavior.		 They're all supposed to be public servants, not commanders and cheifs of state.
@Comey it's the people's job to try and elect the best candidates, but it's the FBI and judicial branch thats supposed to protect the people from both domestic and political criminal activity..		  Otherwise politicians go unpoliced, and corruption spreads like a virus infecting our Gov.
@Comey The only reason our country is being led by a farcicle narcistic Mens Rea mentality, via an excessively liberal&amp;facsist republican house		  Is because the judicial branch allowed political corruption to continue, and is allowing an obstructionist authoritarian to remain in office

1st press meeting&amp;Trump is caught lying about highest elect. vote win, &amp;that he didn't know anyone who spoke with Russia. What about Flynn?
@livecnn Trump knows what's going on.  He's silent and mad at the media because, he doesn't want the people to know what's going on.
Stating that all negative polls or news is fake, is living in denial. Also trying to fire anyone who objects to you is called dictatorship. https://t.co/sg8Qu1QnHV
Wrong. Trump just doesn't like to admit the truth. doesn't like criticism, won't admit his errors, &amp; deflects anything to the contrary.. https://t.co/6gPItyU5u6
Then the nurse tells me what they do here in 4-6 hrs, is equivalent to 2-3 mnths in the real world.. I wonder what world she lives in.  Hehe
Well its official I guess, the commercials are over &amp; the show has begun.. The suspense is killing me, I can't wait to see what happens. 😐
@realDonaldTrump Congratulations, May God give you the knowledge &amp; ability to make our environ. the mutually beneficial place you sold us.😎

@FOX40 isn't that like asking voters to due their own diligent research on presidential candidates, instead of listening to propaganda?
@realDonaldTrump Projecting one's own faults on others is an intrinsic talent, that most often practiced by arrogant people living in denial

@FoxNews This just means she's either guilty of perjury or gross negligence. As any reasonable person in her position should have known.
@Franklin_Graham Socialism has nothing to do with it, the crux of the problem is the corp..&amp;political corruption that's destroying society

@FoxNews @newtgingrich the question is why do people feel they need to shoot other people.. Duh
@FoxNews @newtgingrich lol liberals like resolving issues. Conservatives like doing the same things over in different ways which is insanity
@FoxNews @CharlesHurt yea, just like shattering the large bay window that keeps your house dry in the rain. Soon a storm comes&amp;pisses on you
@CoryBarnes_Mus @yabberz_news @melissanhorton true.but knowing is 1/2the battle. Ppl not using knwldge&amp;intel.2form wise choices is the prblm
@ABCPolitics @ABC7 so are Monsanto products and lying to retain votes. However you don't seem to have issues with either of those.
@realDonaldTrump So will you. Paid off the loan you made to yourself yet?  You talk a good game, but your actions&amp;character show another you
@WhiteHouse @POTUS true, however corporations, politicians, and potus candidates who abuse the environment and people aren't innocent either
@WhiteHouse @POTUS the country is divided due to extremist CEO's&amp;politicians. Who suffer from occupational psychosis&amp;abuse the people
@yabberz_news @melissanhorton society has become a manic coexistence, due to mass occupational and social psychosis that become the norm.
@yabberz_news @melissanhorton lol 90% of society is mentally I'll, just because they haven't been diagnosed doesn't mean they're not manic.
@yabberz_news @melissanhorton what adds up is that Trump will say anything to anyone to gain their votes. Even though he doesn't mean it.

@FoxNews @BobbyJindal screw them both, the lesser evil is the honest candidate Bernie Sanders.
@RandPaul why not promote new energy, instead of holding onto out dated and self destructive ideas?
@FoxNews not if the nominee is a fraud who makes the country look bad, and whose plans will damage our economy &amp; violate  our civil rights

@SoCal4Trump @JebBush you guys should do more homework on your choice.
@vandives lol Trump does love the naive and ignorant voters.
@TheEconomist only if the majority of people are really naive and irresponsible.  Many are, but I have faith in the majority.

@TheView Gods the source that supplies life with the energy to exist.As enrgy cant be destroyed,our next path is relative to our choices+/-
@HillmerLeeH @realDonaldTrump True, and its a two way street..However Trump has discriminated in his rallies on the basis of religion&amp;color
@HillmerLeeH thats how we as a society show our disapproval of large entities, government wrong doings, or corrupt politicians..
@HillmerLeeH no, but you have the right to peacefully protest what I say without being accused of wrong doing.	.
@HillmerLeeH yes politicians lie, but they don't outsource products, import immigrants. or violate civil rights laws by discriminating
@ResetBook @PastorDScott Who is he?? I quote "  Not heard anything like this since MLK. He would be proud of you! So's GOD"
@HuffingtonPost so am I.  Its amazing how many stupid people fall for an Ad hominem and straw man fallacy campaign. He's a fraud &amp; hypocrite
@FoxNews @charlescwcooke @realDonaldTrump He's running an ad hominem and straw man fallacy campaign, that projects his flaws onto others.
@stassone1 that's exactly what he does, every time he violates our civil rights laws by booting out blacks or Muslims at his rallies.
@ResetBook @PastorDScott lol God doesn't favor hypocrisy,lies,fraud, mob connections,or civil rights discrim. &amp;Shame on you 4 sug. He does.
@HillmerLeeH @realDonaldTrump people are tired of his lies &amp; hate speeches that promotes civil rights discrimination&amp;violence at his rallies
@thatchriswalker that's just the beginning, imagine what their gunna do when he starts discriminating against Latinos and Muslims again.
@realDonaldTrump so is the outsourcing of your clothing line, and importing of immigrants to work for you. Your such a hypocrite its sad
Look in the mirror hypocrite. You outsource your products, lie about importing immigrants.&amp;violate civil rights laws https://t.co/YazEOPRazd
@realDonaldTrump how bout your lies about not employing undocumented Polish workers&amp; importing immigrants. Or your hypocrisy on outsourcing.

@FoxNews @tedcruz @TeamCavuto So were FDR, Nixon, &amp;Grant to name a few. Dem/Socialism is req. to protect the people against unfair business.
@realDonaldTrump its just like a straw man to define his value by begging the question.
@realDonaldTrump then why're you so worried you have to belittle them?  That's what's sad, your insecurity that makes you so self defensive.
@SarahPalinUSA  I used to support your ideals, but you've obviously sold out your values to a despot egomaniac.  How much did he pay you?

@realDonaldTrump I've noticed you've stopped bashing people for attention. I don't think you'd make a good potus. But thanks for being civil
@FoxNews start a business that helps the homeless in a manner that benefits the community, and run for president in 2021 he he. ;-)
@FoxNews most people already think the gov. Is supposed to handle everything. Most poblems arise when they don't like the way they do.
@FoxNews they should assimilate with our social laws or leave. If they can't be decent people, we should ship em back with a parachute
@FoxNews that's Shari law crap, the men there are barbaric in the way they treat women, especially if their showing some skin. Culture shock
@FoxNews ISIS &amp; Shari law will infiltrate, yet unless they assimilate, they'll never be accptd. Therefore they become the red flags to watch

@CNN @realDonaldTrump it would be worth it, and probably save the country money in the long run.  Obviously Trump thinks he can buy anything
@CBSNews too much stress I suppose. ;-)

@FoxNews @FoxBusiness maybe if so many companies didn't outsource their jobs and import cheap materials from China, it wouldn't be an issue.

@RealBenCarson I'd be more concerned about the training base in Mexico, &amp; their ties to the cartel thats smuggling them in through tunnels
@realDonaldTrump neither is Satan, you both work for your own ego, with your own motives.  &amp; Your both filled with spite, greed, &amp; bullshit

@FOX40 lol I don't think the source of alcohol matters. If her body brews alcohol then she should be driving period.
The cartel already uses sophisticated tunnels to breach the border with drug shipments, so in reality a wall is a waste of money &amp; mutepoint

@realDonaldTrump @LegacyRealtorsJ baha ha, the White Devils wall won't work, &amp;his radical ideas for deportation will cost us money &amp; freedom
@FoxNews Having a wall when the cartels already have and use tunnels is an idiotic waste of money.

@realDonaldTrump @JebBush yo hypocritical bigot, When have your campaign ads ever shown the other candidates responses to your statements?
@realDonaldTrump @JebBush Trump should be more concerned about his own faulted persona and campaign. Narcissism &amp; neurosis beget psychosis.
@CNN Cancer's a side effect market manipulation. Poorly made Vaccines, GMO's, and pills w/side effects worse than the reason for their use.

@FOX40 well maybe if she paid more attention to her sister she wouldn't be homeless and a victim.todays socialproblem is family indifference
@realDonaldTrump @RickStans1 that's kinda like saying Trump seeks fame not wisdom. the potus should be less hypocritical &amp; more professional
@realDonaldTrump @marcthiessen why does a potus candidate spend so much time bashing other people.. Do t you have better things to do?
