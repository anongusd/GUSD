Election music is now @dreamtheaternet Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. #DRNow
Wayne County now has 57 of 67 precincts, and one of them involve Rittman council or school board races. So, we wait ... #@DRNow
This is only for @tomdavis0209: Wayne County Muni Court judges: Michael W. Rickett: 9617, 50.61%; Suzanne Marie Waldron: 5031, 26.48%; Barbara A. Knapic: 4353, 22.91% #DRNow (don't tell Tom if you look at these numbers).
Voters continue to show support for Mental Health &amp; Recovery Board levy in Wayne County (no Holmes figures here): FOR THE TAX LEVY: 13650, 67.93%; AGAINST THE TAX LEVY: 6445, 32.07% #DRNow
@tomdavis0209 You got it! #workingforyou
@tomdavis0209 34 out of 67 precincts reporting in Wayne County, Ohio.

Scanning board of elections sites in Wayne, Holmes, Medina and Ashland counties ... all while listening to @dreamtheaternet's Octavarium. @GeneralSmithie and @drnewsgirl, I call that #digitalwinning #DRNow
Hate to be right about the Rittman council and school board races, but 50+ percent of precincts in, and no update on numbers from these races. #DRNow

Rittman's precincts are among the last to be tallied by the Wayne County Board of Elections. So, the absentee results will probably be the only figures until 10:30 p.m. or so ... my prediction, not fact. #DRNow
Mental Health &amp; Recovery Board levy gaining as first precincts from Wayne County are posted. FOR THE TAX LEVY: 3423, 72.92%; AGAINST THE TAX LEVY: 1271, 27.08% #DRNow
