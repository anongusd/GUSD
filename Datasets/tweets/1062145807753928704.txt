@fredric_wertham @NightlyPolitics @GOP This is largely true.
@swerp @PhoenixWomanMN When it comes to ‚Äústar power‚Äù - did Carter have it? LBJ, the Dem who arguably got the most substantial work done legislatively in second half of the 20th century? Wilson? Bill Clinton?  None really had ‚Äústar power.‚Äù Now, in terms of recognition she will grow. Nowhere near peak.
@swerp @PhoenixWomanMN I voted for Hillary 2x in 2016, but it‚Äôs not my place to judge how her constituents and region feel, particularly when only represented by a single sound bite. So I can‚Äôt hold such opinions against them, whether I agree or not.
@swerp @PhoenixWomanMN That‚Äôs somewhat ironic, considering she would probably be exceptionally accepting of your opinion on that matter. She only asks that others understand that, reality or not, her region felt slighted and underappreciated.
@JDinSD @chrislongview I think a woman and a minority would work. I did express hesitation about the K/H combo for that exact reason. But I‚Äôm going to disagree about not having Brown on the ticket. The price is too high. It could potentially cost us the Senate. That‚Äôs a price I‚Äôm not willing to pay.
@swerp @PhoenixWomanMN Oh, I agree, we do. There‚Äôs a woman running who has a proven track record of doing exactly that, however. Sen. Klobuchar has done that in every race she has run in MN.

@MzSailiante @chrislongview Very substantive. üôÑ. Have a good night.
@chrislongview So we‚Äôll agree to disagree for now. Have a good night.
@chrislongview Regarding your follow up...the very people who were the source of the reports that came out just questioned yesterday how their stories were presented. It‚Äôs clear the full context has not come out accurately. So too many questions around that to pass judgment, IMO.
@chrislongview Well, you are entitled to your opinion. (Ironically, I have a feeling Amy would say the same.). I won‚Äôt question or address your friend‚Äôs experience here.
@CandiceAiston @KAMALAMODE Criticism/tough questions = rigging, apparently.
@swerp @PhoenixWomanMN That playing field changed in 2017. And 2018 solidified that.
@PhoenixWomanMN @KAMALAMODE A woman can definitely win. I happen to think Amy is more electable and better positioned to govern post-election than other women running. But it‚Äôs time to recognize the playing field changed in 2017 - and last year‚Äôs elections solidified that. A woman can win.
@reesetheone1 If we‚Äôre talking specifically about the election, as well - can‚Äôt forget Nixon‚Äôs possible treason before the election, secretly sabotaging the Johnson admin‚Äôs negotiations.
@reesetheone1 Oh, I‚Äôm absolutely not saying there wasn‚Äôt blowback. Just that when it comes to approval, cannot imply that the entire drop was related to civil rights legislation. Draft policies regarding Vietnam played a role as well.
@chrislongview And yes, I‚Äôve heard all the rumors, read all the reports...have yet to hear something disqualifying. Particularly in light of all the factors in her favor - her approach, her success rate as a Senator, her experience, her broad appeal across the electorate.
@chrislongview You‚Äôll pardon my observation of that being an exceptionally vague statement, both regarding what said knowledge is and what you judge to be unfit.
@reesetheone1 Good points - though there was another major factor in that plunge, of course. A certain...foreign entanglement.

@chrislongview It‚Äôs unfortunate that the issue with Sherrod is outside his control. If Cordray has been elected Gov, he‚Äôs be co-fave for me. That didn‚Äôt happen. Care to go into detail re your opinion?  I have literally two years of thought behind that statement, I don‚Äôt make it lightly.
@chrislongview The alternative is Amy Klobuchar. My only hesitation in a Klobuchar/Harris ticket is whether this country could look past misogyny that would accompany an all-female ticket. Other than that, Klobuchar has experience, proven MW success, &amp; Harris the energy. Pretty powerful combo.
@chrislongview Are you wondering about the law, or who the other Midwest alternative is?
@btpanko @SenhorRaposa So much for ‚Äúlocal opinions matter,‚Äù right?  Example #1 of how false that rationale is.
@chrislongview We can‚Äôt afford to lose Sherrod‚Äôs seat in the Senate. OH election law and last November killed him being on this ticket. (But there‚Äôs another Midwesterner who is a possibility, though I‚Äôd argue for her on top.)

@NightlyPolitics Excellent candidate to beat Trump. She wins across the political spectrum in an evenly balanced state in MN. Dominates. She had the #1 or 2 Democratic Senate performance relative to expectations in November, accounting for incumbent status, state lean, and national climate.

@SenhorRaposa You don‚Äôt have to live in the district to run, but it is generally not advisable to run from outside the district with limited personal history there - especially if you live nowhere near it.
@NickMastro13 It will likely take a Mo Brooks or Roy Moore winning the GOP primary for Jones to win. The path otherwise is very difficult against someone more mainstream like Bradley Byrne, ceterus parabus.
@roon0292 Regardless of personal opinions on Reagan and his policies, I think it‚Äôs safe to say the modern R party would not nominate Ronald Reagan. Objectively speaking.
@MMFlint She had either the best or #2 performance relative to expectations of any Democratic senate candidate in 2018 (+9% above, accounting for incumbency, state lean, and national climate). And by far best of any Senator currently running for President.  Not even close. #Klobuchar2020
@MMFlint Sir, please take another look at her margins in evenly balanced Minnesota and tell me she can‚Äôt win with a broad base across the political spectrum. And tell me the most effective Senator at passing legislation doesn‚Äôt have the relationships to leverage on the Hill.
@roon0292 @SER1897 And is clearly ignoring the recent letter that current and former staffers wrote objecting to the characterization of Amy in the prior reports and saying their full testimony was not included (as I‚Äôve always argued was the case). That should weaken that quibble.
@roon0292 @CAinexile @RMac18 @Gus_802 @NickMastro13 @SenhorRaposa Good riddance to bad rubbish. Calling him a troll is being kind to this proven liar.
@NickMastro13 @roon0292 @SenhorRaposa Easily the best candidate in the field. Especially since the staff allegations have not really stuck broad scale, some have now been weakened with the recent open letter, and other candidates have much larger issues. Also best positioned to govern after.
@SenhorRaposa The map is overly optimistic but still speaks to the impact of a broad base across the political spectrum. You don‚Äôt outperform like that without it.
Even if this outcome is probably overly optimistic, it still speaks to the implications of a broad base across the political spectrum. Downballot implications, too. #Klobuchar2020 #AmyForAmerica #Klobuchar #2020Election https://t.co/qu7gLopQf3
@The_Knows_ @TrumpMuv2Russia @ironstowe @mobygrapefan @TravisRuger @DMansini @allinwithchris @BernieSanders @ewarren @SallyAlbright Uh...let‚Äôs start with the fact that having lived in Vermont I can say a place in Burlington makes for a nice summer home by itself, so hard to justify the added one just south of town in that context. The ones south of town also tend to be REALLY nice, like obviously higher-end.
@Mamaofthreebear @The_Knows_ @TrumpMuv2Russia @ironstowe @mobygrapefan @TravisRuger @DMansini @allinwithchris @BernieSanders @ewarren @SallyAlbright Burlington also is not cheap. Vacancy rate is under 5%. It‚Äôs another expensive place to live. Not sure if it‚Äôs pricier than the houses south of town overlooking the lake, but it‚Äôs definitely pricy.
@mobygrapefan @TrumpMuv2Russia @TravisRuger @DMansini @ironstowe @allinwithchris @BernieSanders Man, you need to update your data. A fair number of those are no longer in Congress. And that was obvious at a glance. Have a good one.
@washingtonpost I, uh, don‚Äôt see the point in this, at all. They are not the same. Klobuchar listens. Sanders dictates. Klobuchar laughs, Sanders grumbles. Klobuchar passes bills, Sanders gives speeches. Nowhere close in approach, effectiveness, or job performance. No contest.
@roon0292 People will get all excited over this...and he‚Äôll put out his KY version of Harry Reid‚Äôs machine and win again. I‚Äôll go as high as 85-90% chance. People forget how much of a machine he has. They hated him in 2014 too. But he has a machine and probably brings home some bacon.
@tameCorraBan @Fla_Pol @SenRickScott @roon0292 Of course. It was a rhetorical question. But yes. And Trying to play to fearmongering sentiments about Cuba.
@roon0292 @Fla_Pol @SenRickScott I also should have said UK rather than England in the initial tweet. Clarification for the sake of accuracy.
@roon0292 Quite possible. But the broader point was the second part - it‚Äôs irrelevant unless a 2016 Trump State passes it. Otherwise it‚Äôs likely just votes he would have lost anyway (well, as long as sanity prevails with the Dem nominee, of course.)
@TossupReport @IndieRepub @jackcurran49 An ideological shading - while still potentially a challenge given the number of individuals and shades - would at least be easier for the Senate than for the House, given the fewer number of people. 50 shades each of red and blue would still be a challenge, though.
@TossupReport @GabeTheCentrist @SenhorRaposa Though not everyone fits evenly into the camps - for example, Jared Golden is in the CPC but he is actually one of the most moderate members of the Democratic caucus. But a chart shading by ideological ranking would have a lot of different colors &amp; might be harder to read.
@roon0292 Not sure about that, but to be honest...it won‚Äôt make a difference anyway unless such a law actually passed in a state Trump won in 2016. Which looks unlikely. Otherwise the practical impact is nil anyway, at least in the 2020 presidential race.
@calyapal @SenhorRaposa @BenJKest Well, fortunately getting this passed would require overturning CA‚Äôs redistricting laws, correct?
@HouseGOP Wow...an actual nonpartisan tweet, for once. Maybe House committees - including those from your last period in the majority - can take a lesson, ironically. Though I note some accounts have since changed their labels to at least be clear who is running them. I guess that‚Äôs a step

@SmallFryInNY @reesetheone1 @mike47441781 Ok, an explanation...which indeed begs the question why he is allowed nuance and flashes of pragmatism but any by others renders them, eg ‚Äúimpure?‚Äù  Sounds like a double standard. Your explanation?
@SenhorRaposa @paolo_lim @notlarrysabato There are those of us who would like to see longer sessions, but Drew is right. (They‚Äôre also proud of being a ‚Äúcitizen legislature,‚Äù so not changing.) And there‚Äôs only a week left in the session tops in an election year. Shorter than usual session.
@roon0292 @Fla_Pol @SenRickScott I mean, this really does not seem to be a true foreign policy or national security issue. So I really don‚Äôt see the point in taking a position on this; it‚Äôs a matter of UK policy, not US policy.
@pickachu528 @Marie_Al_Marie @tommyxtopher @amyklobuchar @cloudbootjar Right...promoting a parody account that ignores nuance and denigrates the value of someone who is upfront and honest rather than pandering.
@cloudbootjar Would you rather that she lie about her position?  (Of course, ignoring all the serious policy components she actually discussed as well, but I‚Äôll digress from that for now.)
@Fla_Pol @SenRickScott Why does Sen. Scott care what the crown prince of England does? @roon0292
@paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa @notlarrysabato It‚Äôs still the party that nominated Corey Stewart. Still the party that kills the ERA 6 times in the House. It‚Äôs not changing. And the VA GOP MOE is slim - 3 total seats, with a bluer map. So is it as certain, no. But is it still eminently possible? Yes.
@paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa @notlarrysabato But things such as the President‚Äôs shutdown that affected so many here will not go forgotten. Plus, remember the Republican Leader had his own scandal as former editor too. Everything is a mess, and the Dems have their own challenges, but remember, VA GOP is a dumpster fire.
@paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa @notlarrysabato It‚Äôs still possible. I live here. No doubt there are issues. While the odds have gone down - though Northam has become less a problem in polls than Fairfax - if any election will test the impact of national climate it‚Äôs this one. The map is bluer than 2017, too.
@zcpolitics Well, if they follow through with their moderate campaigns, there‚Äôs a certain Senator next door who fits their mold. But I don‚Äôt expect any of them to endorse soon - frankly I wouldn‚Äôt want them to do it so early.

@kaypapa13 @BenJKest I assume your thinking is Smith loses in MN?  Because I don‚Äôt see Klobuchar losing.
@GabeTheCentrist @BenJKest Nor is there any guarantee Stewart would have been the GOP nominee in that circumstance. Though if he was, his message would have looked even worse. So it could actually have been just as bad. Not clear.
@GabeTheCentrist @BenJKest Yeah, because VA would have been likely an appointment, most likely Bobby Scott.  He probably would still have won - we have a diverse electorate that already supported an African American president - but would not have had the statewide goodwill of Kaine.
@NickMastro13 Prediction: new election in near future, McCready will win. (I know, not going out on much of a limb there.)
@SenhorRaposa Abraham has run into problems of his own, too. Yess, too early to say but Edwards has inside track.
@dacaesar @FiveThirtyEight Which is funny because Amy actually broke with the Democratic Party less than just about any other Sen candidate in last Congress, &amp; on issues like the environment she has a 95% lifetime LCV rating.

@tjkeding @RGod8855 @FiveThirtyEight @SenSanders @JoeBiden National polls are pretty meaningless this far out. Of course those with most name recognition from past races/offices will be ahead.

@heefy @JimJinksCT @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney He passed his best chance to improve on his situation, from both recognition AND experience when he decided not to run for Governor of Maryland. So no, I do not expect him to significantly improve his position to the point of relevance.
@heefy @JimJinksCT @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney Delaney has plenty of issues. I‚Äôm not here to defend him. But his name recognition will be a much more significant one this time next year. Now, do I fully expect those issues to be present next year? For him, yes, yes I do.
@heefy @JimJinksCT @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney Well, I‚Äôm not completely objecting, so you might want to drop the snark level. Just noting that judging things a year in advance is a bit presumptuous. Again, national name recognition matters a lot - in January 2020.  If nothing changes, he will have a bigger problem.
@heefy @JimJinksCT @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney I didn‚Äôt say he wasn‚Äôt known. But did people think he would be the nominee in 2008 a year in advance?  No. It was his win in Iowa that gave him serious legitimacy in that regard.
@JimJinksCT @heefy @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney However, Delaney has some serious knocks against him. Klobuchar, Harris, etc are simply better candidates. If Delaney has wanted to seriously strengthen his candidacy he should have run for Governor of Maryland.
@JimJinksCT @heefy @PatrickRuffini @JohnDelaney National recognition matters a lot - in February 2019. It‚Äôs February 2018. Plenty of time to build up recognition. Otherwise Dems would have had nominee Joe Lieberman in 2004. He was leading at this point then. Obama was barely on the radar at this point in 2008.

@BarcaAdmiral @JTG1776 @FiveThirtyEight I suppose you mean compared to the view conspiracy theorists might have. In that case yes. But that‚Äôs really stating the obvious, no? Have a good one.
@SenhorRaposa Jealous was a bad candidate. Inexperienced &amp; lackluster campaigner, allowed Hogan to define him early. Didn‚Äôt respond. Significantly left of Maryland as a whole. Perhaps somewhat naive as well when it came to how he had to run to win against a popular incumbent. Bad candidate.
@Kittenman234 @SenhorRaposa Yeah, he was a bad candidate. Allowed Hogan to define him early &amp; didn‚Äôt respond until well after Hogan had already provided everyone preconceived notions of Jealous. I don‚Äôt even remember seeing Jealous ad until midsummer at least. Inexperienced. Not a good candidate. @roon0292
@JTG1776 @FiveThirtyEight They aren‚Äôt the end all be all, of course, and of course actual results are more meaningful, but making wide sweeping judgments based on a single year, especially with more recent data to the exact contrary is the definition of an overreaction based on a small sample.
@JTG1776 @FiveThirtyEight Problem with first part of that assessment is...the 2018 polls nailed the result. Except for Rasmussen, off by 10%, but that‚Äôs no shock, they‚Äôre always off by 5-10%. Besides, if one doesn‚Äôt put one‚Äôs best candidate forward and compete at all, I guarantee one will not win.

@NickMastro13 In 2020, it‚Äôs clearly MN/WI/MI/PA. In 2024, maybe 2028 it will likely shift to the Sun Belt. Hence why if @ShuttleCDRKelly can win in 2020, Phoenix would be the frontrunner for DNC 2024. Atlanta a close second.
@JTG1776 @FiveThirtyEight She has much higher favorables than Gov Kemp does. Last poll I saw had her at 51%. He was at 37% or so. And that was before her SOTU response that was very well received. Senate is feasible.

@johnsoncp3j96 @Luky173 Obama?  Polarized electorate, lot of single-issue voters, and a lot of minority voters left the state after Katrina and moved to places like Houston. Same reason why Louisiana lost a congressional seat last cycle. And partially why Texas has started getting more competitive.
@mjk1093 @Polit_eurOpines @SenhorRaposa Like I said, she already has many issues. Starting with the fact that her voting record is that of a moderate but she claims to be a progressive.
@Literally_Max @BorderPolitics_ @ForecasterEnten @NewsHour Think he‚Äôs actually worse off than Kander, frankly. Kander had some positions that endeared him statewide. Pete will face more issues than Kander did. I really think he‚Äôs going to have to look out of state, maybe just over the IL/MI lines.
@seahawks270 @darren_janz @SenhorRaposa Thanks!  I knew that the other had to be Laramie or Cheyenne, nothing else down in that corner of the state that it could be. Interesting about Enzi, like I said Teton tends to be pretty blue. Guess we found a year that was an exception.
RT @jbuoen: Massive turnout for ‚Å¶@amyklobuchar‚Å© in ‚Å¶‚Å¶Eau Claire, WI! https://t.co/3QhjFwjc17
@paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa Agreed. But important to note that Trump had a distinctive base from all other GOP candidates. Not so for Gabbard, who now largely overlaps with Sanders and also has to contend with Warren. Plus, her record doesn‚Äôt really support her reputation, likely to be exposed.
@Luky173 @SenhorRaposa What was the exact methodology involved here?
@GabeTheCentrist @Luky173 Well, it IS Trump‚Äôs strongest swing state by approval right now. I think other factors have been at play recently, though. However, keep in mind the map doesn‚Äôt include 2016-2018.
@Luky173 @SenhorRaposa Mississippi and Louisiana...interesting. Farther left for Clinton in 2016 than Obama 2008.
@SenhorRaposa @IRussell729 @Luky173 Does this include state races?  The GOP in New England has done a good job separating itself at the state level from the national party. That has helped somewhat. Plus certain popular candidates like Sununu and Scott helped them. (Plus, it‚Äôs 2016, not 2018.)
@clark_roslyn @reesetheone1 If only Ohio election &amp; vacancy replacement laws didn‚Äôt get in the way.
@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE Klobuchar and Bullock remain the top two long term (losing Brown‚Äôs seat is too high a price) - but we may need Bullock to run for Senate instead. He has been my dark horse for two years, though. But we have a chance to beat Daines with someone like him running for Senate.
Interesting graphic. https://t.co/JS8H8guZUr
@darren_janz @SenhorRaposa I ask because Teton tends to be the most Democratic-friendly county in Wyoming. So the fact that a sitting Republican Senator won there is very interesting.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE @govtrack So you acknowledge he‚Äôs been unable to do so. I‚Äôve not denied challenge involved. But how exactly do you think that challenge would be any different as President? How would he be any better position to work with Congress than he is now?
@DesJarlaisTN04 How is supporting a policy relying on eminent domain consistent with supporting individual rights?
Claims to be for ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù but uses whataboutism and advocates for action that would stomp on individual rights by pushing eminent domain. https://t.co/Of7v8qGSrF
@darren_janz @SenhorRaposa I‚Äôm going to assume the yellow counties in MN voted for Klobuchar but not Smith.
@darren_janz @SenhorRaposa Which US Senator from Wyoming won Teton County? And was it the same one who won what I presume to be Cheyenne?
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE @govtrack Focusing on advocating for positions, speeches, etc - that‚Äôs all fine and good for a Senator, but few bills means no coalitions. And limited to no coalition building means issues in implementing a platform.That translates to gridlock, more of what we‚Äôve seen for the past 8 years.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE Three official bills passed in 25 years is a pretty low standard for that statement. He‚Äôs pretty low in @GovTrack leadership score relative to other contenders. He is who he is. He does a good job involving constituents, advocating for positions.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE Yes. Which is why I examined their records on a per year basis, not as a gross total. Leahy passes more amendments per year and more bills. (The article was from 2016 so the last two years are not included.) Sanders is who he is. He‚Äôll face the same issues if he were elected.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE But let‚Äôs not pretend he is some super effective legislator or that he is a uniter @ bringing people together to pass legislation. On a per year basis he has passed fewer amendments than his counterpart (Sen. Leahy). And he has only passed 3 bills in 25 years by your own source.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE Interesting that you accuse me of moving the goalposts when I made two consecutive consistent comments about bills and you attempted to change it to amendments. But I digress. I‚Äôll give credit on the total amendments.
@fakeKevinDJ @ForecasterEnten He probably could.  But Sen. Klobuchar probably could too. And indeed, if Dems win Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Ohio can vote Trump and he‚Äôll still lose.
@WesPDX86 @tomwatson @KAMALAMODE Who did this rating? Source? I‚Äôll read it. Senate, too. But the key word in your statement is ‚Äúproposed.‚Äù  How many have actually passed?  The job of a legislator is to pass legislation, not merely propose it. The work doesn‚Äôt end with the introduction, it ends with passage.
@tomwatson @KAMALAMODE I lived in Vermont for four years. Met Bernie. He has good approaches to involving constituents &amp; occasional good idea. Doesn‚Äôt follow through. Doesn‚Äôt put the work in to actually turn proposals to policy. Doesn‚Äôt do enough with minority communities. All he does is polarize. https://t.co/koE54K5z1v
@evolgress @CoryForOhio @ForecasterEnten @roon0292 We also have to expect to lose in AL, so losing another seat for two years (as would occur under OH law, I researched it) before the special election when we likely already need 4 is not insignificant and cannot be dismissed.
@evolgress @CoryForOhio @ForecasterEnten @roon0292 I‚Äôm confident that she would be willing to push as far as she sees there is public support for, frankly. And would work to build support for going further (though not waste limited political capital). Because that is what she has done her whole career.
@evolgress @CoryForOhio @ForecasterEnten @roon0292 They are both pretty solid on policy. Klobuchar I think should be judged by her principles rather than ideology. She has been one of the top three most effective Senators at passing legislation into law and has the relationships on the Hill to leverage to turn proposals into law.
@BorderPolitics_ @ForecasterEnten @NewsHour I think he needs a statewide win to solidify his future candidacy, but I agree that it will be tough to come by in IN. He may have to slide to a neighboring state to get that. He‚Äôs decently close to IL &amp; MI geographically so they might be more accepting of such a move.
@evolgress @CoryForOhio @ForecasterEnten @roon0292 I completely agree with this. If we‚Äôd won Gov race in OH Brown would be my co-favorite with Klobuchar. They‚Äôre very similar &amp; both represent the path of least resistance. As it stands primary difference is Klobuchar doesn‚Äôt risk losing her seat given a D Gov, so she gets edge.
@Literally_Max @BorderPolitics_ @ForecasterEnten @NewsHour This is true. But do you see a better solution?  He needs a thicker resume, that‚Äôs pretty much a given. There are two ways to get it - current state or other state. Obviously a nearby state would probably play better. Do you have any other suggestions how he can get that?
@CoryForOhio @evolgress @ForecasterEnten I fully understand that, spent years working on various campaigns. But it is the difference when another candidate presents many of the same benefits and would not cost the seat. If he was the only one that would be a different story and I‚Äôd agree, but he‚Äôs not. @roon0292
@DisavowTrump20 Neither are my top choice, but between the two Harris is the clear preference. Sanders, despite being a good advocate on certain issues, is one of the two most polarizing figures in US politics today. If elected he could not govern. In that situation policies don‚Äôt matter.
@Scout_Finch This should be an easy one in a perfect world - but it‚Äôs also very unlikely, unfortunately.
@Literally_Max @BorderPolitics_ @ForecasterEnten @NewsHour I agree. He‚Äôll probably have to move elsewhere. But if he adds any statewide experience anywhere to his resume, he‚Äôll be a formidable candidate.
@evolgress @ForecasterEnten Brown is great, but he consistently outperforms other Dems for that seat and we can‚Äôt afford to lose his seat for two years (as we would under Ohio law) when other candidates present the same benefit without that risk. He‚Äôd be my co-favorite if Dems had won the Gov race in Nov.
@fakeKevinDJ @ForecasterEnten I love Brown but we can‚Äôt afford to lose his seat for two years (as we would under Ohio law) when other candidates present the same benefit without that risk.
@BorderPolitics_ @ForecasterEnten Saw Buttigieg on @NewsHour the other night. If he wins statewide office anywhere, he will be a formidable candidate the next time an open race for the nomination comes up. Definitely someone to keep an eye on moving forward.
@ForecasterEnten Ideal ticket would be Klobuchar/Harris but would that be seen as gimmicky and is America ready for an all-women ticket?
@ForecasterEnten Amy Klobuchar. Long list of reasons why, starting with her effectiveness that will be crucial to undoing Trump‚Äôs damage.
@KAMALAMODE @politico In four years in Vermont I never heard much about his efforts with African American leaders there.
@paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa Gabbard is already having issues. I‚Äôd think this might suffocate her campaign before Iowa. She literally has little to no base if many of her remaining supporters go back to the cult of personality that is Bernie.
@SenhorRaposa People like Harris and Klobuchar - who don‚Äôt suffer from such base division and have clear control (as of now) over specific constituencies - are much better positioned.
@SenhorRaposa If he runs, the progressive vote will split at least between him, Gabbard, and Warren. I would think now Gabbard won‚Äôt make it to Iowa. She has enough issues as it is. Now she‚Äôll have no base.
@GovernorBullock Please run against Sen. Daines. We need more pragmatists in Washington to turn proposals into reality. You would make an excellent Senator for Montana.
@GovBillWeld Thank you, Gov. Weld. My mother is a Mass native and speaks highly of your tenure as Governor and your integrity. You are an honorable man, and we need someone to take a stand against the current controlling forces in the GOP. It‚Äôs good to see someone rise to that challenge.
@MedPierre @NewsHour @KrisKobach1787 However, he did make a good point at the start of his remarks when he implied that the Act in question needs to be clarified by Congress by noting how broad it is. The contextual problems run deeper, but that was a good point that merits addressing moving forward.
@MedPierre @NewsHour @KrisKobach1787 Thanks for your comment. I agree, presenting alternating points is essential to any discussion. And the NewsHour does a fantastic job of this. But having written a 30 page policy paper on this exact topic, here much of what Mr. Kobach was claiming was either false or unfounded.
@databyler @aedwardslevy This was a particularly bad year in DC for rain.
Past instances of #NationalEmergencies didn‚Äôt immediately follow Congress already expressing its view on matter through funding process. As stated in Article 1 of US Constitution. So past moves weren‚Äôt craven end runs around Congress‚Äô power to appropriate funds. #FakeEmergency

@ishabad @PoliticalKiwi @joesmith54321a Brian Schweitzer 2004-2012; Steve Bullock (inc.) 2012-present. Yes, center-left Dems win state office in Montana. Bullock even won re-election the same year Trump won.
@SenhorRaposa @moolah59 @RelentlessYapp @Ferric242 We also need someone close to Bullock (or Schweitzer) to run for Gov. and give Bullock a big bear hug. We‚Äôll really benefit from having Bullock on the ticket in general, though. He‚Äôs too good &amp; popular in MT to let him just walk away.
@SenhorRaposa @moolah59 @RelentlessYapp @Ferric242 We really need Bullock to run for Senate unless someone like Schweikert - still very popular - jumps in for that. If so, that frees up Bullock to run for President. He‚Äôd be my #2 candidate and top Governor option if he did so, unquestionably.
@bayofarizona @BrojoDeathpunch @Bakari_Sellers I‚Äôm sure that explains her strong popularity in progressive Minneapolis. It‚Äôs also false. She has passed plenty of Democratic bills.
@PoliticalKiwi I guess South Dakota by default. Particularly if a Midwest Dem is the nominee. Probably wouldn‚Äôt win it, but would make it the most likely of the four. But Montana is actually a better option than any listed.
@ishabad @PoliticalKiwi @joesmith54321a Montana hasn‚Äôt done much at the state level?  By 2020 it will have had 16 straight years of Democratic governors.
@CautiousLefty @PoliticalKiwi And Arkansas was his home state in a much different political landscape. Plus, Louisiana was his neighbor.
@RocnRol123 @HurricaneFetta @johnnydollar01 @BretBaier @FoxNews It‚Äôs not just about winning a majority in the presidential race, it‚Äôs about downballot races too, those votes can‚Äôt be clustered in certain areas alone to have that impact.

@RelentlessYapp @Ferric242 @SenhorRaposa If Steve Bullock runs for Senate in MT, there‚Äôs a chance that it could have two Dems again itself. (The other three listed are pretty hopeless right now on that front.)

@FunnyNora @rharkins63 @Bakari_Sellers Actually, it‚Äôs possible to win without Ohio if you win MN, PA, MI, WI and hold the rest of the 2016 states. Brown is wasted as VP - he outruns all other Dems in OH and his seat would be lost for min of 2 years under OH law.
@rharkins63 @Bakari_Sellers Indeed my dream ticket. I fear misogyny may prevent two women, but in an ideal world, this would be the combo. Klobuchar‚Äôs pragmatism and experience give her the edge in the combo.
@BrojoDeathpunch @Bakari_Sellers Klobuchar was the best Dem at the hearings. By far the most substantive and focused line of questioning. But her record at passing legislation is where she really stands out - most effective Senator at passing legislation into law. #Klobuchar2020 #AmyForAmerica
@janncanaday @Bakari_Sellers @JoeBiden Texas needs Beto first, take it out of the solid GOP camp. He should run for Gov in 2022 to that end. A statewide win will also set him up better for a presidential run than VP will.
@AugustusTodd4 @MrDane1982 @Bakari_Sellers I prefer Klobuchar/Harris (Amy has more experience and relationships to leverage from her time on the Hill, most effective Senator at passing legislation) but that combo is indeed my dream. I hope misogyny doesn‚Äôt prevent it. Here is hoping. Powerful combo of experience/energy.
@swpennell @MrDane1982 @Bakari_Sellers But he is a great, hardworking Senator for OH and I hope he sticks and holds that seat as long as possible.
@swpennell @MrDane1982 @Bakari_Sellers I like Brown but under Ohio law if he were to win Dems would lose his seat for 2 years. That‚Äôs a full stop right there, Dems need every Senate seat they can get right now.  He was a cofavorite of mine with Klobuchar. Fell to 3/4 when Dems lost Gov race in November due to that.
@FrankDelfinPupo @MrDane1982 @Bakari_Sellers Warren underperformed in MA in November (-7% below expected, accounting for incumbent status, state lean, national climate). Major red flag if your priority is defeating Trump to have one of the worst performances by a Dem Senate nominee in a solid blue state.
@Bakari_Sellers I would not, unless he‚Äôs the nominee. And we can‚Äôt afford to lose Brown‚Äôs seat for two years under OH law should Brown win.  That‚Äôs a kill switch on his candidacy right there. It died when Dems lost the Gov race last fall.  #Klobuchar2020 #AmyForAmerica

@RepDonBeyer Sen. Klobuchar is incredibly qualified for this position. She‚Äôs routinely most effective Senator at passing legislation, top 5-10 in the Senate in leadership, popular across spectrum. If this is worst he can say - and it really has nothing to do with her at all - well, ok then.

@RockyRidgesPal @roon0292 THAT I do not see sticking. He‚Äôs associated himself too closely with it to get away with that. He‚Äôs basically made it all about him. (Well, he doesn‚Äôt have much else.)  That‚Äôs great when things go good. When they go bad, they tend to go south for you too.
@roon0292 @RockyRidgesPal Only one?  No, but he is still the primary instigator of the situation, so he is not going to escape it. And his failure to compromise cut more than 50% of the original negotiation window away, increasing the likelihood of this occurring.

@pearldolphin @SQLmichele @MarkWarner That‚Äôs conflating issues. We obviously need to help our vets and fix legal immigration too. But speaking of the border, 67% of Texans in the RGV oppose the wall, and all three counties and 16 cities have formally opposed it through resolutions.

@StopMSMLies @Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu For the record, I used the Berlin Wall and divided Germany as an example. Does the Berlin Wall exist today?  No. Because it failed at actually solving the issues that led to its creation to begin with. Ultimately it became a white elephant symbol of division.
@StopMSMLies @Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu Question: do you think that the West Bank is part of Israel?  If your answer is yes, then the picture you posted isn‚Äôt a border barrier at all. And has it moved the region any closer to a peace deal, (which has been a stated objective of the Trump administration)? No.
@StopMSMLies @Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu By your logic, the Berlin Wall ‚Äúsucceeded.‚Äù  But in reality, it didn‚Äôt solve any of the issues behind it, either, like the economic conditions in East Germany. So, it was torn down. But not before it became the symbol for division for most of the second half of the 20th century.
@StopMSMLies @Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu For example, is an actual peace deal in the area any closer today than when it was built? No. If anything, it‚Äôs less likely today than before the wall was built. To say it succeeded is a very narrow view.
@StopMSMLies @Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu Your meme displays internal wall Israel built along West Bank, not border fence with Egypt the OP referred to. The West Bank wall hasn‚Äôt solved any big picture issues that led to it‚Äôs construction, either.

@roon0292 Well, post-2020 we need Congress to legally define it themselves, so we don‚Äôt permanently rely on however SCOTUS defines it regardless. It is the ultimate pivot point, and should be clarified as such.
@SteveDaines @realDonaldTrump The @USGAO has not issued a report determining a wall to be the most effective strategy on this issue. Every dollar spent on a non-cost effective approach is a dollar less to go to real solutions. #Fact #TrumpShutdown #EndTheShutdown
@Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu 3) Have you actually been to that area?  The topography of the two borders is simply not comparable. The US/MX border crosses rivers, mountains, canyons, floodplains. The Israel/Egypt one is a line in the sand. No comparison. #TrumpShutdown
@Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu 2) Almost no one crosses the Israel/Egypt border by land anyway. There‚Äôs one legal crossing (+2 commercial) with something like 2000 crossings per year. The US/Mexico border has 48 points of entry with 340M crossings per year. Most crossed border in the world. #TrumpShutdown
@Onelifetogive @EtkinDaniel @RepSwalwell @netanyahu 1) There‚Äôs no wall on the Israeli border. There‚Äôs a fence. #TrumpShutdown

@KarenNativeCA @EsotericCD The article relates to the primary, though. Not the general election. Only one district in the entire state was close enough to be affected by the numbers cited, too - and only if 50% of all such individuals were in that district. Unlikely to say the least.
@KathPlatten @realDonaldTrump But if you are considered essential and cannot do something like take leave, you must work. They do not have a choice. Very problematic, particularly for the 111K currently affected that make less than 50K/year and the 50% who never went to college.
@KathPlatten @realDonaldTrump They are considered ‚Äúessential employees‚Äù and are therefore asked to work regardless of pay. For example, certain LE rangers at parks, certain FEMA employees, TSA, Secret Service. If considered essential, only true way to get out of nonpay work status is to take sick leave.
@politico They‚Äôve been ready, already passed legislation to do so, legislation the Senate already passed last month for that matter. #TrumpShutdown
@KarenNativeCA @EsotericCD I don‚Äôt see anything about the latter comment in that link. But more importantly, provisional doesn‚Äôt mean illegal, &amp; it‚Äôs not really a surprise that the state with most people had one of the highest gross totals of such ballots handed out.

@KarenNativeCA @EsotericCD Yes, because California doesn‚Äôt do recounts, so they take their time in the initial count. And close races take time because virtually every ballot has to be counted before a winner can be declared.

@rsnekser @LamptonMarie @joncoopertweets @amyklobuchar I am not. I want him to put both himself and the party in the best position to succeed. No Dem has won in Texas in decades. It will take solidifying the party structure, the right opponent, and the right stage of trends to flip that. Cornyn in 2020 is unlikely to be that point.
@rsnekser @LamptonMarie @joncoopertweets @amyklobuchar No. I don‚Äôt think staying in the spotlight will be an issue for him, to start. Aside from that, party structure is still in serious need of help in Texas. He can work on solidifying it. The bottom line, though, is are you willing to risk ending his career if he runs and loses?
@sam_vinograd That‚Äôs correct; the statement is wrong. He went into the Navy at 18 and then went to Yale after returning.
@rsnekser @LamptonMarie @joncoopertweets @amyklobuchar Also, if he loses 2x his viability nationwide and general credibility to be the transformative figure he has the chance to be in Texas politics takes a serious hit. We need to put the party and him in the best position to succeed; that‚Äôs just not 2020.
@rsnekser @LamptonMarie @joncoopertweets @amyklobuchar Disagree. While I like the enthusiasm, Cornyn is a much different challenge than Cruz, it‚Äôll be harder in a Presidential year, and most important the trends that are making the state more favorable to him are unlikely to be fully set in just 2 years.

.@GilCisnerosCA has taken the lead over @YoungKimCD39 in #CA39. If this seat flips every LA &amp; Orange County seat will have flipped to @TheDemocrats. #Election2018 #ElectionResults2018 #Midterms https://t.co/z6nBYrcYP7
Oh, you mean like what @RepPoliquin tried to do in #ME02?  Isn‚Äôt that exactly what he tried to do?  Change the law after the election?  #Midterms #Election2018 #ElectionResults2018 https://t.co/hKD52v9RLY
@4_scribe @politico California doesn‚Äôt do recounts. So instead they take their time in the initial counting to make sure they get the initial count right - including absentee and overseas/military ballots. #Midterms #Election2018 #ElectionResults2018
@JCrum07 @politico Orange County is historically one of the most @GOP parts of California. So the fact that @TheDemocrats have flipped all but one district in the county and lead in the other is a VERY big deal.  #Midterms #Election2018 #ElectionResults2018
@TheBobbyJo123 @politico Well, she and a number of others elected this cycle. Just about every Orange County district has flipped blue. If @GilCisnerosCA wins in CA-39, every district will have flipped. #ElectionResults2018 #Midterms #CA39 #CA45
.@katieporteroc (D) has officially beaten @MimiWaltersCA (R) in CA-45. @TheDemocrats have now flipped 37 House races. They are still leading in two of four remaining uncalled races, UT-4 &amp; CA-39. #CA45 #Midterms #Election2018 #ElectionResults2018 #California #UT04 #CA39
.@golden4congress has defeated @RepPoliquin in #ME02 under Maine‚Äôs new ranked choice voting law. There will be no Republicans from New England in the 116th Congress. @TheDemocrats have now flipped 36 House seats. #Midterms #ElectionResults2018 #Maine
