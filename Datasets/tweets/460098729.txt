@DanLairdMD It’s irresponsible for the medical community to continue the narrative of only prescription opioid medication causing this “Crisis”. 	BTW- POC and people in our lower socioeconomic classes have been experiencing this Opioid Crisis since the 1930s. Where has the outrage been??
@DanLairdMD I’ve never abused my pain meds. And I thankfully never needed medical intervention due to an OD when I was actively using.	The 2 never overlapped, but looking back, I was probably using the heroin as a self medication for my emerging physical pain- amount other things.
@DanLairdMD This whole “Opioid Crisis” is frustrating, obviously, to those of us living with chronic pain. I’ve been on daily opioid meds for almost 10 yrs.	I was also an IV heroin user- I’m 17 yrs clean. 	This is a unique/scary perspective to have that I don’t share IRL often due to stigma.
