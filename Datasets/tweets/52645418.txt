@MeredthSalenger @grailsnail @Twitter I muted every tweet that had that hashtag. Perhaps I'm still being threatened, too, and just can't see it because it's muted.
There's an entire generation growing up believing that it is completely normal for every single thing a U.S. President says to be a lie.  Anyone know how hard it is to change a 'norm'? Do we really want to add four more years to this new generation's normal?

@FLynngates @vSteam9 @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders Truth is, I *am* more of an artist, an actor, and a prayer warrior. But it's not a paying gig. Hoping the MBA will help!
@SenSanders Thank you for continuing to tell the truth, and at least attempting to provide possible solutions to our economic problems.
@81XaLady @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Maybe they're not delusional...Maybe this is the world "they" live in, &amp; they act based on things they've been told their entire lives. Not delusional necessarily, just really out of touch w/ what's going on in the rest of the country &amp; world. Or, is that the root of delusional?
There are people who get paid to Tweet. Can I get in on that gig? #economics #Twitter #howtowinattwitter
@CraigDough @SenSanders @AOC I'm with you. I don't have the answers &amp; I'm not typically the political type, but if everyone reels in their spending (govt and individuals), it wd result in lower prices on consumables. I'm guilty of living on credit, &amp; don't know how 2 get out of the cycle. It's so stressful!
@CrackerALS @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders At 1st I tht u seemed like somebody who wd b willing 2 engage, but then I noted ur Twitter handle. The thing is, big companies who can afford 2 pay ppl what they're worth, do not. Then when those employees get skills that make them worth more, companies still don't pay them.
@CrackerALS @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders Sure, why not?
@charliekirk11 @CraigDough If they're doing what Putin tells them to do, if they're following Putin's instructions on "How To Be the Best President Ever," then probably.
@CraigDough @SenSanders @AOC So I'm not arguing with you, really. 7.35 not livable. Raising minimum wages will be nullified by increased prices. So how does an educated and/ or skilled person get paid a living wage? 11/hour still doesn't cut it.
@CraigDough @SenSanders @AOC I really wish I'd learned a trade alongside my initial college education. What I learned to do anyway was cook/bake/decorate cakes (all programs offered at trade schools) Still no livable wage.
@JaneParkerrr @yashar @chrissyteigen Aha. She's an #antivax anti-vaccer. I see!
@CrackerALS @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders You might b surprised. Often companies vertically integrate &amp; train f/ w/in. They say how wonderful they r 4 offering free education 4 employees but don't pay them what they shld prob get  paid 4having that knowledge. just bcz thyr educated &amp; skilled dsn't mean they get fair pay.

@CraigDough @SenSanders Ita, Yet, ppl can't live on $7.35/hr, &amp; even ppl w/education &amp;experience often have trouble finding jobs that pay much more than that, so how can those other elements of inflation be mitigated? What is your proposed solution? #inflation #minimumwage I think @AOC is onto something
@tori_kristen @SenSanders It seems costs of goods increase simply at the thought or discussion of a potential increase to federal minimum wage.
@IridescentTutu @SenSanders Maybe try using the word 'ignorant' instead of stupid? For #ignorance, there is a fix. For stupid, there is not (usually).
@Jake__Bradley @JamesKMed @ecton_chris @SenSanders Source? I mean, sounds legit, but when even the President makes up numbers and calls them facts,...well, citing sources is more important than ever. #FactsMatter
@CrackerALS @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders Someone has to program and maintain those machines.
@vSteam9 @MKFox1 @razchz @SenSanders I have an MBA. Got a BA in '95. Have had an awful time making much more than a low hourly wage at any job. I value the education, but it didn't make me any $$.
@SenSanders It's totally true. But...how do we keep corporations (those who set prices for groceries, fuel, pharmaceuticals,) from raising prices proportionately, thereby nullifying the effect of raising minimum wage?
@SpeakerPelosi I'm so thrilled to see the #House at work!
@ByWatterson @KateBolduan @mkraju Perhaps shorter word was used intentionally for Twitter.
I'm an #80s girl, &amp; we thought it was cute 2 dress up like famous people. A lot of famous people were black. In costume contests, we got points 4 looking as much like the star as possible, &amp; sometimes that meant lots of make-up. #imitationisflattery is that considered #BlackFace?

@SlaughterCordis @SenSchumer Unfortunately, if they begin negotiating b4 the government is opened back up, it sets a precedent &amp; then the President wd have absolute power.

@kennethholland7 @RandomSaffa @GOP @realDonaldTrump KH:  I'm honestly confused by that tweet. Lol
@RandomSaffa @GOP @realDonaldTrump I meant to say "this country," then changed it to "America." Twitter needs an edit option. I strongly believe Trump is a danger to America. My timeline will likely look very different once he's removed from office.
@RandomSaffa @GOP @realDonaldTrump Because I feel very strongly that Trump is a danger, possibly inadvertently so, but a danger to this America.

@Farmraider @StoneDrinker @washingtonpost What you say is true about #Trump. This happened after deliberatations &amp; negotiations because he didn't like any of their offers. *He* shutdown the government &amp; *he* is unfortunately the one with the power to open it back up.

@Farmraider @StoneDrinker @washingtonpost Also, #UnitedStates has a long standing policy that we don't negotiate with terrorists. It could be argued that taking American citizens hostage is a form of terrorism. #Trump created the crisis that is the #shutdown.
@Farmraider @StoneDrinker @washingtonpost The House had voted eight times in the last few weeks in favor of opening the government. McConnell won't bring it to vote in Senate unless Trump wants it.
@Farmraider @StoneDrinker @washingtonpost They were negotiating already. He didn't like any of their offers and shutdown govt. That's not negotiation.

@Farmraider @StoneDrinker @washingtonpost I don't think you're dumb.

Trump is succeeding in getting Americans "negotiating". Pretty amazing how those who don't want 2 deliberate about wall until after the government is open  already weighing-in with opinions about his possible proposed "negotiation." #TrumpShutdown  #trumptempertantrum #TrumpLies
@SpeakerPelosi please don't give into #trumptempertantrum it would set a horrible precedent. Re-air the footage where he claimed #shutdown. As he's been a proven liar many times, I wouldn' trust any of his "promises." But furthermore, no deliberations until government is open.

@Grinder_69 @realDonaldTrump Thank you for that link. I'm still questioning it, though, because the article here said as of March 2017, the City officials declared it safe to drink.
@nlm53 @Olpatchedquilt @Emannjudd @mkraju I've had that thought, too.
@Olpatchedquilt @Emannjudd @mkraju I have that faint hope, too. Lol
@Olpatchedquilt @Emannjudd @mkraju Or else he knows exactly what he's doing. If Trump declares a State of Emergency, it's a blatant abuse of power. Trump is already on camera (Fox News) saying if they fail to reach a compromise, he'll declare a state of emergency. That is not a legitimate or legal reason to do so.
@Grinder_69 @realDonaldTrump I would very much appreciate a link to the article if you have one.
@gtobey @J_CMueller @jlcalvert82 @realDonaldTrump I honestly wondered if perhaps he was a bot, but I think he is a true supporter of Trump. I'm guessing either he believes everything Trump says, or else doesn't mind the lies Trump tells.

Hey #drummer just in case you forgot me again, I still exist.
What a wonderful, relaxing day this has been! TAFN.
I absolutely loved #Superstore  My new Monday night show.
Even better tea: #WissotzkyTea Chamomile  (Babonag) #MagicGarden with a teaspoon of vanilla #ToraniSyrup Pure chamomile flowers nothing else
Tonight's tea: Vanilla Comoro from #HarneyandSons with a teaspoon of vanilla torani syrup.  Very good and very vanilla.
Watching the pilot for #Superstore  looks good!

Relieved I'm not missing #jeffgordon 's last race! Thought I'd missed it.  He's the main reason I started watching #Nascar.
I planned to spend 2day writing my final paper.  I haven't done a lick of work.  But, to be fair, time spent downgrading Windows helps.

#grammarpolice on patrol! read previous tweets.
There is nosuch thing as "2 pair". It's '1 pair' or '2 or more pairs'. Pair is a singular word that means 1 set of 2. Pairs isa plural word.
"Like, for example" is totally redundant. Is it 'like', or is it 'for example'? Choose one.
If the 1st word of a sentence is "like" and the 2nd is "literally", it's probably not literal.
I sure did a lot of "resting my eyes" today (yesterday).  I think I must have overdone it the last few days.

@theconnormahan just take one step at a time--eventually you will have walked a path to a destination.
#swimmingpool filling faster now.
I really hope there's not a leak in the vinyl--it doesn't seem to be filling up as fast this time. #swimmingpool
But it needs a little more leveling & support so won't be ready to swim in yet. But I wish!  #over100degrees all week long!

In our family unit, we stay up late at night and we leave our clothes on the bathroom floor.  That's how we do it in our house.
I think I will repeat, my son is "good as gold".  And, when it gets right down to it, he knows who his mother is.

Those people who speak ill of a child's mother should not then be surprised when the interactions between the 2 are unpleasant.
People who talk bad about a kid's mother--to that kid--should realize the kid will in turn treat their mother badly. kids are sponges.

Well, back to life as I know it.  I wonder who will be next to be laid to rest.  I can't believe I'm outliving all these people!
I've had it in mind 4a long time 2buy an #Amywinehouse album, but now I will feel guilty if I do-a little late 2offer support of her career.
I'm so aware of all my material things right now.
I have nothing to wear.  Going to funeral in shorts. Haven't even shaved. Need coffee!
Can anyone tell me how I can see tweets of people I'm following that I haven't assigned to a list?
Going to a funeral of someone who defriended me feels a bit like crashing a party.  But it helps to have an idea why she did it. RIP Amanda.
Poured 19 bags of 50 lb sand.  Awaiting about 15 more to arrive--gifted f/gparents! Can't wait til next step in the "pool process"!
Gonna be 107 degrees at 7:00 pm.  Wish my pool were already up!  90 now-/I guess this is the time to do outdoor work!
I think maybe a backhoe woulda been easier!
I am so sore from leveling ground for a #swimmingpool today.  Can't wait to take it easy!  So what are these muscles called, again?
#amywinehouse is more alive than she's ever been, with her face all over the news every second of every day. #Immortal.
Okay, so no drugs--just alcohol. Maybe drugs should be legalized.  I'm torn on this one!
My heart is sad. The world has lost yet another lovely, young lady -way too young- to drugs. RIP Amanda Focht may you be in a happier place.
We had a nice break in the heat & a tiny bit of very welcome rain.  Hopefully it holds the promise of more.

I am finally learning how to use Twitter, after all this time!  Thanks for some ideas from @bmms and the help of lists.
Watching BB After Dark that I recorded while sleeping last night. Even though dated 7/22/11, it is the same recording from the night B4.
I wonder who invented the fane if chess, & what inspired it.
Haven't even leveled the ground yet for the above ground pool, & already seeing ads fir all the toys & additions I can get for it.

What if each American could eat what they want&never gain weight?How much more every marketing campaign&social event wd revolve around food!

Haven't been able to quench my thirst all day, no matter what I drink. It's starting to get frustrating.
The only reason I'm still awake is to eat this homemade tabouli! :-) then to bed to prepare for an early morning.

Looking 4 a flashlight, then batteries 4 the fl, as I try 2 find my keys, I realize I should prob create an "emergency preparedness kit".
Did I mention I haven't yet found my keys?
It's 84 but feels like 100+! already sweatin' like it's going out of style!
Been looking 4 a while & still haven't found the keys.

I'm all poked out for tonight.  Will catch up tomorrow.
catching up on my "pokes"
looking forward to getting my new swimsuits in and throwing out the old ones.
I knew my mother would have something to say about it--even though she said/says she didn't/doesn't pay any attention to it!
Wish my son would help around house.He tells me his grammy &his bff mention how bad our house looks--but he doesn't lift a finger 2 help!

I'm really counting on a nap later!
Nope--waking up was not easy! Although it helps that the whole house smells like onions f/the avocado feta dip I made yesterday.
Gonna try the sleep thing again.  Ooh the morning is gonna b tough!  Stupid garlic, onions, herbs, caffeine & yummy things keeping me awake!

oh, the allergies I awoke with this morning are quite unpleasant.  It is hard to keep my eyes open because they are so scratchy.
Broken car wash & long line is really testing my patience! It was my turn, darn it.
somethings been biting me--I hope I don't have bedbugs!
Sparring wasn't as bad as I thought it would be after 4 months away!  Good things learned.
Trying to get geared up (in the right mood) for sparring.  I am having a hard time bringing myself to go get beat upon.
Seems I've pissed off the whole world again. Wonder what I did this time?!
So glad it's finally Friday! I am *so* tired!

Enjoying my MardiGras beads&wondering if I'll ever remember 2wear them again-like green 4leaf clover earrings I forget 2wear onSt Pat's Day.
I think last night's gonna catch up with me by tomorrow.
Random thought: thank God 4 closets!

Home sick today.
I was over the 450th voter to vote in my precinct today--longest ballot ever! 11 State questions; 12 State offices.
Missing people in my life who've passed--appropriate for All Saint's Day I guess. JSP, Doc, grandpa(s), Uncle...many more.  Feeling blue.
Appropriately cold for 11/01 in Stillwater, OK today!  Brrrr
It is quite challenging to become an informed voter and avoid biases and mudslinging.
I am totally looking forward to seeing, "For Colored Girls . . . " produced (or directed?) by Tyler Perry!  Loved the script and the style.
I don't see any reason to not keep the incumbent State Auditor and Insurance Commissioners in office.  So many qualified candidates, though!
The majority of my information on the elections and the candidates is coming from the internet.  The tv commercials are just mudslinging.
For most part, my vote boils down 2 who is fighting me getting much needed Healthcare (w/preexisting conditions) & who is helping me get it.
Making up for weeks without Tweeting.
Saw a bunch of SWAT teams at work 2day.  They were total hotties!  I was all like, 'Bond.James Bond.' *whistle*  Felt like I was in a movie!
I hope a Democratic Governor and a Republican Lt. Governor can work well together!
I can't see any reason not to retain all the judges.  11 State questions and a ton of State Officer elections in 6 days.

Good Lord what is with all the "affected" faces on SYTYCD this season?!
Wondering if I should allow my son to continue in taekwondo.  I really thought it would help redirect his agression, but now he is more so.
Sort of accidentally called 911 on my kid 2night--the cop came 2 the door (I hung up after 1/2 sec) & told kid not 2 interfere w/a 911 call.
I am watching the SYTYCD finale . . .
I guess I am the worst mom in the world now.  I just took my son's cell phone away--for good this time.
Ulcer in the eye.  I just want to shut them until they don't hurt anymore!

Got it mowed and feel more productive.  Now I can relax. :-) I know how to spell extremely.  At least I think I do.
looks like rain is coming.  That's the motivation I need to mow the lawn! bfn.
(oh, and muscle relaxant last night after 4 hard core workouts)=me being exetremely useless today.
Trying not 2feel guilty about doing nada, since I haven't energy.  4 States in 8 days w/2 time zones, 3 hs mini-reunions, & 2 days of wine=
thinking about going back to bed until dusk, at which time it might be cooled off enough to mow the lawn (is 90 degrees cool?).
My son has hit full teenager mode.
Just got my son home from music camp--he is ready 2b home, & I am ready for him to take a very long shower!  What a long day.  7 hrs in car.
My left glut is so sore as my left side has been compensating 4 sore blister/callous of right foot, as has the right ankle, it is also sore!
Too many flies in the house!
I am pleasantly sore from 4 great workouts over 2 days!  Taekwondo, good stuff.
There was cream cheese in the middle.  Maybe I can use a store bought pie crust and try this creation w/light cream chz and sf jello.
Awoke this am dreaming of food.It looked like some1 was making a giant PopTart &had folded the pastry dough& was spreading limejello on top.
@OkcRob  You are so right.  I need to use Google much more.  I need to catch up with the times!
@BonnieHuntShow  I am really enjoying your show today (airing now CDT)!  Love the choir, and the flow charts!
Lmbo @ Bonnie Hunt today!  Wanted her producer nephew's gf's choir to sing something "cheaper" aka public domain, then the flow charts!
Hopefully by the time I wake up, my aches and pains and sore foot and ankle will be no more.  Good night.
Again, the cat won't take 2nd place 2 computer.  He insists on standing on my stomach and making biscuits s oI am typing mostly blind!
@official_tWitch  I just love watching you dance!  TG you were in the Step # tonight (last night now)!
just LOVE Twitch!
LMAO at two femininish white dudes "steppin'"!
SWEET "Steppin" on SYTYCD!
I want cruncy fried coconut shrimp, or sweet&sour pork. Have neither so I have decided to have cherries. Crunchy w/a "pop" & a bit of sweet.
Oops, let me try this again: @OkcRob Congrats on your Emmy!
2 men doing the pasa doble on @SYTYCD . . . Fascinating.
Finishing my DVRd SYTYCD from tonight.  Had to pause to clean refrig since tonight is "trash night" (they p/u trash in the am)
My dog is staring at me hard. He won't let me sit on my butt at this computer for more than an hour at a time.  I guess that's a good thing.
I wanna eat something fried right now really bad.
I totally agree with @MMRaw about Kent's "animated face"--great technique, though.
Gardens are dying.  Over 100 degrees by 9:00 am and doesn't cool off until 9:00 pm.  Don't think this will change anytime soon.
dry eye sucks.  Good night.
1 thing that sucks about feeling pretty good is that u know at some point it will end, & then the thought makes you not feel so good nEmore.
Last tweet was referencing @Mandy Moore and @Mia Michaels, 2 of my favorite choreographers and totally cool people (both on @SYTYCD)
"Ascendance" (on AGT) choreography reminds me of MM & MM. I wonder if they r inspired, jealous, done it b4, or wish they'd thought of it!
The cat will not take 2nd place to Facebook or Twitter.  He insists.
Feeling pretty good because I just made a credit card payment that wasn't asked for and wasn't even due!  Woo hoo!
Time for bed!
I miss my son!
Loving watching The Nanny on Nick--so many 80s references, like "Toni home perm" and so many more!
I want to eat something good, but all the fast food is closed and I am certainly not cooking at 2:40 am!
I can't wait to see Step Up 3D!
I should go to bed, but I am really turned around after driving from Mountain time to CDT until 3:00 am CDT!
@Rob Congrats on your Emmy!
so what's going on with the oil spill now?
I feel like I have been drugged.  Is it the altitude change?
Guess what?  I don't have to!  I don't have to.  I really don't have to.  No coulda woulda shoulda.  It is what it is, and I don't have to.
I have the "shakes" in my fingers and toes.  What could be wrong?  Little control over keyboard and mouse.
Home from New Mexico.  As much as I am a flatland girl, I sort of miss the mountains.  Bummed I didn't get a chance to hike on one.
I'll be sad to see Brad Henry leave office (Governer of The Great State of Oklahoma)--I think he did a great job!
started watching my DVRd SYTYCD & think the costumes are fab so far!  Loved the Tahitian #!  Have to go to bed so will finish show later.
Not quite as overwhelmed today, but still so much to do with so little time to do it!
Take my will and my life . . .show me how to live.
more than one person can handle.  God give me strength, good judgment, available time, rest, peace, and the ability to make it all work.
I would rather everyone hate me than to feel as if I don't exist.  If those were to be my choices, anyway!
I can't keep up with July!  Isn't this supposed to be a relaxing time of year?
I feel a binge coming on . . .
Garden tomatoes.  It's what's for breakfast!
That garden sox thing is cool--wish I could figure out how to share on FB.  It is similar to what my aunt's neighbor did with bags of soil.
RT @gardengalinfo: Update: 30 Minute Vegetable Garden http://gardengal.info/organics-gardening/30-minute-vegetable-garden/
I think it's probably time for bed!
Another broken toe.
Just watched DVRd SYTYCD & saw the announcement about Alex.I cried with him--I am familiar w/that feeling of devastation & fear.Fingers x'd!
Those stupid caterpillar thingies really think my plants taste good!  They didn't see the "Posted. No Trespassing" sign!
not making very quick progress uploading pics to facebook.
Totally nervous about tkd tournie a month away.
@dizzyfeet Of course he'll be able to dance again--he's in great shape and will come through surgery and rehab with flying colors!
Loved last night's Quick Step routine!
Cat Deely looked nice on SYTYCD last night.  Some great dances!  I actually liked the one at the bar.
Stress abides.  Wait . . . what exactly does "abides" mean?  My mind just went blank!
So tired but feel like there is so much to do.  I guess it can all wait until tomorrow.
dishwasher and washer are running.  That's about it.
Can't decide what 2 tackle 1st--dishes, laundry, housecleaning, lawn, billpaying, menuplanning/groceryshopping.  This is why nada gets done!
@kaizenTKD What a great feeling that must be!  My dishes & my laundry have been staring at me, taunting me, for 2 days!  The frig is mpty..
@moonfrye Kinda.yep. lol.
@dizzyfeet If you post the link, I will vote!
I am wondering if one of NeYo's dancers got hurt.  Looks like he landed on his side & crawled off stage--was that part of the choreography?
NeYo's "Beautiful Monster" sounds a lot like the 80s song "Maniac"--just slower.
I figured out what it is about AllStars season that gets me.  Next 2 A.S., contestants look like students n dce class following the teacher.
I think Ima rewind and watch this one again.  What fun!
HA! That was awesome!  I just love watching Twitch, &it was enjoyable watching Alex take on Hip Hop, &the comic relief in the routine=A++!
on SYTYCD--I am just now watching last night's epi and I think that was a really cool and original ending on Alex's solo!
Just thought I'd say, I am totally enjoying this summer!
I am sure my next student dentist will be very competent and fabulous.  Hollywood pearls, here I come!
My dental student has graduated & I think was happy to pass me on to another student.  He managed to postpone/procrastinate for 2 months!
Can't believe I haven't watched SYTYCD tonight.  I don't like All Star version as well.  I like it better when the dancers grow together.
OMG! What an absolutely gorgeous night!  The temperatures have dropped, the gardens will love it, and so do I!
In the last 10 days, I have driven out of town and back at least 5 times.  I am not meant to be a "trucker"!  So ready to be home.
I just want to sleep today.  Flies all around.  Got the flyswatter out, and it is as if they know exactly what it is. How do they know this?
Green tea and white pear candle burning in background.  Smells good.
Yay! My dwarf banana kit and black magic elephant ears have been shipped!
The dog will be a senior next year.  The cats are 2 and 3 yrs old.
I want  pet insurance & it's 2 overwhelming comparing all the companies w/their exclusions, riders, etc. I need it more 4 my dog than cats.
Muscles are relaxed.  Good night.
"Finished" the garden tonight!  It only took 3 months.  I spent 7 hours just pulling weeds and mulching this week.
Eating a "salad" which consists of 2 kinds of small tomatoes and banana peppers from my garden.  The official first "harvest"!
think I might make it to bed at a "reasonable hour" tonight.  Good night!
I installed this garden from lawn a year or two ago, so in a few years it should be easier.  Maybe then it will quit trying to be a lawn.
3 gardens are up to "just maintenance".  (2 small & 1 large).  2 large gardens to go.  Bermuda grass is hard to fight!
Every year I look forward to getting my garden to the point it just needs maintenance.  Somehow it looks easy, but I never get it there.
I haven't had my phone in a while--lost it somewhere in my car & forgot to look for it.  No wonder I still feel so disoriented!
So I took that nap after coming in from the heat, and I feel so disoriented right now and can not seem to prioritize anything!
A nap would be nice right now.  I spent too much time in the heat pulling weeds.  I must have said, "just one more" to myself over 300x!
And one last tweet for today: I &lt;3 Nate's Tree Service, of Stillwater, OK!
The Hollywood Smith's are a totally classy bunch! Neat family with lots of brains, beauty, talent, and skill.  I want what they have!
I loved the remake of Karate Kid!  Jaden Smith was incredible, and at one moment ('was that an antique?') I totally saw his dad in him.
Did I say I was tired of FB? What was I thinking!  I have to force myself to sign out and go to bed tonight.  Long day of driving tomorrow!
hmph.  I just got tired of Facebook!
Still have back pain.  Can't wait until I am safe at home for the day so I can tell if a muscle relaxer is all I need.
I think my son is excited about camp.  He kept me up over half of the night last night.  I *will* be taking a nap today! (guilt free!)
Wondering how to use my home grown Stevia plant as a sweetener in foods . . .
I enjoyed sharing them with my real dad this close to Father's Day.  I look forward to sharing all these fabulous herbs all summer!
Harvested a bunch of herbs that r trying to flower early.  For some reason, the sage smells like Desitin.  Is this what too much rain does?
Time 4 me 2 go pull weeds.  Sorry, but SYTYCD isn't holding my attention in live time this season.  I will watch later and FF thru parts.
Ready for my back to quit hurting so I can accomplish something.
Have my front door open for first time in a while and kitty cat is enjoying looking out the new "window".
Feeling a lot of anxiety today.  I attribute it to memory loss due to pain pills and muscle relaxants.
Mindlessly eating Oreos.
I have glass in the callous of my toe.  There is no getting it out.
I just ate the second red tomato--the first of this variety (off this vine).  Such a tease!  I can't wait until there are more!
I smell roses and have no idea why.  What a pleasant smell!
I finally got my nap.  Much better now.
So tired.  Hopefully I can make it through this day.
I got bumped for being so bad.  I think I was messing up the stats, so kid took controller from me!
Gonna play Super Mario Kart here in a minute.
It was because it was not from her heart, but only regurgitated brainwashing from the very people who deceived me and did me wrong.
I think i figured it out.   Anyway, super tired today with a lot to do.
I am wondering why some of my FB friends post multiple status updates per day about God, and I am wondering why it irks me so.
Will I ever get anything done again? Geesh.  The distractions that come along on the computer!
We are procrastinating in my household tonight, and I am the leader of this effort.
My son says I am not allowed to say "butt majutt", but it is so cool cuz it rhymes--how can I not say it? BUTT MAJUTT!
I am going and going and doing and doing and getting absolutely nothing done.
I want chocolate.
Wishing *I* were at a pool bar at a resort w/sun & a nice breeze.  Wonder if I can make that happen & who would take care of pets&plants.
Stupid fly just won't die.  What does it see in me?
noisy lawnmowers outside--how is it that they work on this very saturated ground?
Missing my son.  I really should use this opportunity productively . . .
And it is sunny again.
Pouring rain.  I hope my gardens can handle it.
I am sooooo tired.  Ready for my back to quit hurting, and my head to be clear.

@greysonchance Can't wait to hear it & to see you perform again!  You rock!
*known* not "know"
Maybe I should let it be know that the doc prescribed quite a bit of medicine for my back pain and told me not to drive . . .
So he said I have pretty pink horns.
and he said "you're not a steer".  I said I'd rather be a queer than a steer.  A big, fat, bull with big horns? Puleeze.
My son says I have pink horns. Lmao!  I am a queer steer with pink horns.  Where he comes from there're only steers & queers . . .
I am totally switching from coffee to tea (herbal tea is so pleasant!) this summer.  & maybe from wine to herbal tea in the evening.  Maybe.
I had to quit tweeting last night because Twitter was over capacity.  I only had 2 more tweets to tweet!  Glad to be back, lol.
But I have about tweeted my whole day, so i am off to fictionland!
The problem w/ reading a book while waiting 4 doctor is that doc always comes n when u r just getting n2 it, middle of a paragraph.
It has now become priority to invest in a real alarm clock--i am sick of being awakened by phone calls 30 minutes before alarm goes off!
I ordered coffee from McD's.  Funny, it smells a whole lot like hot tea!
13 yo ds just discovered I am a "tweep".  He thinks I tweet a lot.  WhatEV-ER.
Non smokers should get periodic 5-minute celery breaks that correspond to each time the smokers light up.  That might help them quit.
Such a shame they smoke, & initially it was just to get a break.
These construction & lawncare guys have no idea how incredible their bodies are--they just do their job.
Waiting for doctor to check out my back.
Looked out window this morning & sky was blue & plants were perky & bright--as if it had never flooded.
Just went to the bathroom.  I just thought it would be fun to tweet that! lmao!  Washed my hands.
Wishing I didn't have to wake up in the morning.
Have I mentioned I am starting to really enjoy Facebook ads?
wow--somebody's cattle got out because of the flooding and are seeking refuge on top of a bridge (which is about a foot under water).
Raining again.
All's well that ends well.
All 4 are in a boat with life jackets on, clinging to a tree.The girl is 17, and clearly relieved not to be by herself out there any more.
dirty water--overflowing septic tanks and garbage/trash run off.
Correction:  3 firemen and "rescuee" clinging to tree, awaiting rescuing.  Hypothermia a distinct possibility.
She got rescued, but now the rescuers are in the tree in need of rescuing, and the boat has capsized.
My dog is laying next to me in his own seat on the console couch, snoring, without a care in the world.
Starting to lightning and the helicopters have to leave.  Hopefully the "airboat" can get into the trees.
She isn't a woman.  She looks like about a 15 year old girl.  She is panicing and clinging to a branch.
The woman is getting lost in the trees.
Trying to do helicopter rescue
pic of woman in Edmond clinging to tree (tries to swim & goes nowhere) so not to drift with current of water on "road"
People are putting sandbags in a newly created "lake".  Is there really any point to that?
Seems a good day for popcorn.
Rescue workers, firefighters, police officers, doctors, & pro athletes are all looking like kids to me these days--they just seem so young!
Days like today people are wishing  they had purchased the flood insurance.  Regular homeowner's insurance does not cover flooding.
lmao! My half brother's status update: "Just saw a fish cross the road"
kids trapped in house with water up to windows in OKC.
Being asked to stay home today (because of rain).  I think I can handle that!  Just sitting on my heating pad, and staying in touch online.
I hope my living grandparents get my email, &r able 2 read it. Almost legally blind, they will need help. I sent an entire letter yesterday.
Cars are submerged in water.  My heart has already gone out to those in Arkansas who lost loved ones due to flooding--now I pray for OKC.
Hope my gardens withstand this rain.  I love the free water, but only if followed by a good dose of drying, evaporating, sun!
massive flooding in OKC, several Interstates closed in spots, bridges washed out in suburb of Edmond
Time for some "loving me" time--after bedtime routine, I will read 3 chapters!
Yesterday I watched a tuned, upright piano, sell f/Habitat Restore for $50--all because "they don't accept pianos because they never sell"!
@PaulaAbdul  ITA that SH did a fab job hosting, and you did a fab job presenting best choreographer--you looked beautiful!
Fences.  I was supposed to have read that play in college, but didn't.  Sure wish I could watch it on Broadway!
It is moments like this (watching the Tony's) that I miss the stage with a passion.
I guess I should go to bed now.
SYTYCD dancers are absolutely amazing.
I am still learning how to use Twitter, so I apologize if my etiquette is a little "off".
@dizzyfeet love the yellow car!
Twitter overcapacity, lol! Too many tweets, wait amount and try again.  Classic!
Just found out that not everybody gets to see fireflies every Summer night!
I think I finally get to play FB games for the first time in 3 days! Woo hoo!
Just thought I'd mention, today was not a "do nothing" day!
I think I might have 50 mosquito bites when I awake in the morning.  ugh. (just came in from gardening at night)
Because I made both of those mistakes!
Excited 2 have finally found my Rodale's Encycl. of Herbs.  Disappointed 2 find that u should not plant Rue near basil, or sage near onions.
I guess it is time 2 get off the computer & get dressed 2 the lace up shoes.  Stuff 2 do.  Really thought today would b a "do nothing" day!
Tested 4 green belt last night. I am so sore. I am flattered by the level of sparring that the Instructor thought I was up too! (I wasn't!)
More herbs to plant, but have to do it after dark, as it is down to 76 degrees then, as opposed to 100 during the day.
I just love having groceries in the house, and a choice of food!  (last night restocked)
104 Facebook notifications.  This could take a while.
Work in the morning.  Wake up to an alarm.  Today was productive, so it's okay!  House is semi-clean!
Almost 3:00 am . . . suppose I should go to bed!
It is stormin' good & loud!
I love thunderstorms!
So tired after spending 3 hours in the hot sun pulling weeds.  And, my fingers are kind of numb.
Gonna let the kiddo have some computer time now, since our desktop is at the "doctor".
just found out urine kills athlete's foot . . .hmmm . . ..
uh oh. The cat (Samurai) seems to be hunting indoors again.
The fledgling is not free after all.  It is just not on porch.  I am thinking about letting my cats &dog out to put it out of it's misery.
Golf on tv on purpose.  hmm . . .what does this mean about me?
Maybe it's time for bed . . .
Sheesh! Toenail on right foot is falling off, Callous on left foot is torn 2 the point of blood. How do u get feet like this ready 4sandals?
So excited that I don't have to set an alarm tonight!
Letterman is awesome tonight, with Paige Miles and with Usher.
Whew!  It must be humid outside--it's been a while since my hair made me look this much like Mufasa from Lion King!
Samurai has braved the room with the scary ceiling fan, walked across my keyboard, and curled up in my armpit!  Progress! lol
Grass pollen was high today, but it's the mold spores that have me wheezing.How weird it is 2b allergic to something, when u think about it.
I wonder if the mail comes tomorrow and if Saturday counts as a business day.
I can't wait for my vacuum cleaner parts to arrive in the mail.  I feel like I could grow plants out of my carpet right now.
Just dimmed the track lights with the remote, hee, hee, *giddy*--love that I don't even have to aim the remote!
Cats are happily eating wet, canned, food by Friskies.  Samurai is sulking as he eats, but he's liking the food.
Went outside 2 check on the fledgling & I couldn't find it w/my human eyes. I think it's gonna make it.  It's a beautiful night for camping.
I brought her in (kicking) too, but she was fine when she found the "easy food" by Purina.  Forgot all about the poor little birdy.
Birds quieted-I went outside.  Fledgling had moved about 2 ft, but my other, seemingly PETA affiliated kitty, was cornering the fledgling.
When the bird chirps calm down I will go see if the baby has safely made it off porch.  I really don't want any more dead birds on my porch.
My cat cornered another bird (a baby). I wondered why the birds were going nuts outside my window. I brought the cat inside.  Mad kitty.
Glad I got my Facebooking in last night.  Seems to be crowded on this Memorial Day weekend, and the computer is super duper slow!
R.I.P. Gary Coleman.  Condolences to family & friends.  May he party like a Rock Star with the rest of my 80s peeps in the life hereafter.
The spinners seem 2b helping deter the critters f/the garden. 2 bad I didn't get them b4 I lost my lettuce. I *will* be planting more! Shhh.
My eggplant in a pot is thriving. My eggplant planted in the ground (Oklahoma clay) is not.
Kid on lawn duty & I've dead headed roses, cleaned kitchen, washed windows, planned dinner, done 1 load laundry, swept &mopped, & then some!
BED! whew!
Woo Hoo! Samurai came n2 the living room on his own!  He jumped up on me 2 say "hi" & "feed me", then he ran out of the room n2 the kitchen!
4 lunch: boxed rice w/canned chicken w/bottled taco sauce=high sodium=high cholesterol=early funeral 4 me.  Don't worry, I'll b late to it!
Maybe now that my feet are good and scrubbed I can sleep.  Good night for now!
Gross, gross! gross-gross, gross!  I got up n the dark 2 let my dog out 2 potty & I stepped on something that went squirt!  It was a slug!
Went to Texas Roadhouse for dinner--it was excellent tonight!  Going back to bed now.
I like to eat.
Almost time to update the profile pics again.  Gotta keep'em current in this "Age of Social Media".
"mop" not "mom".  Whoops.  No time for typos in a tweet!
I really thought w/nothing on the calendar & no work that I could catch up!  All I did was go to tkd--& I will empty trash b4 I go 2 bed.
hang stuff on walls, dust, sweep, mom, hang toilet paper & towel racks, wash windows & mirrors, empty trash, & declutter.  Did none of it.
2day I wz gonna pull weeds, plant plants, thin plants, install border, clean garage, purse, kitchen, car, linen & bedroom closets,  . .
DVRd American Idol finale.  Hopefully I can watch it before seeing any spoilers.
I have realized I avoid the mail when I am stressed, particularly if I am stressed about financial issues.  What a stack of mail I have now!
Can't imagine repeating 7th grd for 5+ absences--*excused* *or* *unexcused*!Just plain unreasonable.If I had$, I'd send him 2private school.
Just got letter f/son's school-informs me that he has been absent more than 5x this semester &may not get credit for his courses bcuz of it.
Pap smear reported as normal.  Sweet.  That's not crap.
I would love to know why I am getting so much crap in the mail!
I think my stomach and apricot wine have parted ways.
And, we may have to suspend our learning for 2 months while I am not working.  Seems I should take advantage of it while it is paid for.
Trying 2decide if it's a good idea 2to go 2Tkd tonight when I'm not feeling the love.Yet, belt test is in 1.5 weeks, &I need 2burn calories!
What to cancel . . . cable?  Food? Definitely no vacation--not even a day trip.
Time to suck it up and face the June budget.  Maybe I should take a pill first.
Key Lime Pie and Chardonnay sound good.
Still trying to find motivation to do even one thing I had planned for today.  Just one.  But this humidity is stifling.
I'm guessing the day went sour when 200 lbs of flesh jumped on my head & chest after I pressed snooze button & turned my head toward pillow.
If you're an old friend f/days gone by, there's always Facebook & Twitter.About 2 unplug home phone. I can always plug it back in if need b.
Plz phone, quit ringing. Caller:If you don't have my cell #, then I don't know U & I have no reason to waste my 911 phone or my time, on U!
& the home phone I have solely for emergencies such as 911 calls, I really wish it would quit ringing incessantly.It obviously isn't for me!
Wish the commercial with Jillian and the doorbell would quit playing, because it gets the dog started barking all over again.  Sigh.
It is already almost 3 pm and I have given up hopes of the high productivity I had planned for this day.
Shoedazzle would 've been cool, but if I special order shoes 1x a month, they better take my foot measurements--not just my fashion sense!
Back Street Boys are back, and they're grown up and sexy!
My body had other ideas.  I feel the way I feel when I forget my thyroid pill.  Wondering if somehow I missed my mouth.  Big storm coming.
Yep.  My body just isn't working.  I am going to go back to bed and try again.  I think 30 more minutes and I will be a new person!
Maybe I should just go back to bed, and wake up on the other side of it!
It's not a matter of not enough time or money (well, maybe money), but a matter of a lack of energy.
That really hurt.
Was told today that I was delusional for wishing everybody could get along,show love &respect 2each other,whether or not we like each other.
Wishing people weren't so judgmental of each other.  Don't people realize we are all in this world together? Love and respect would be nice!
I think reality tv acting will screw a person up just as much, if not more than, being a child actor.
Actors cry and laugh and get angry for me.  Singers cry and laugh and get angry with me.
Wish I had a better music system with more music choices.  It's like craving good chocolate but eating around the craving.  Never satisfied!
Awesome moment on Glee just now (DVRd) with Kurt, his dad, and Phen (Fin?).
Glee!  That's what's happening!
Learned today that I cannot turn my back on a glass of wine.  Ugh.  What next?
Drinking apricot wine hoping the day will get better.
A 27 lb bag of dog food is heavy to carry around.  I could lose the equivalent of four of those off my body and still not be underweight.
what's for dinner?
Good wine would be so appreciated right now.  Even good beer would suffice.
Maybe I'm the one at the rival school . . . no fun to be scolded for looking out for my own!
Pissed at the world.  I knew this would happen when insurance quit paying for my hormone pills.
Gonna get my hair did . . .
So I am a schmuck who over-reacts, maybe!
I want to go to daytime tkd, but I scheduled a hair appointment.  Unfortunately, the hair takes priority right now. :(
I need to unplug today.  Computer, phone, all communication devices.  There is so much to be done around the house!
Beginning the morning w/anger as I realize hs girl's crush on college boy is getting n the way of her ability to kick some ass in her sport!
I really need to sign off all this social media for the night.  I guess I will start with this one.  Hope my kitty comes home.  Good night.
Feels like I always have 1/4 cup of fluid in each ear.
why do my ears always itch and feel full of waxy buildup?  Is it allergies?
My scaredy cat will not come back inside the house-I can not catch him 2 give him tranquilzer even if I had one. I hope he's not gone 4ever.
I have hiccups that hurt.
Should go to bed, big week and long day ahead.  However, all the caffeine I had to try to make it through today is now catching up to me.
I need to do something productive, like brush my teeth and get dressed to the shoes!
Yea, it flew away. It's buddy from a week ago wasn't quite so lucky.  My hunter cat had been outside. I guess birds are eating my garden!
Oh, that is so sad.  A bird just hit my window and went tumbling down.  Hope my cat isn't out there . . .
No Desperate Housewives, guess I will watch Lost tonight.
Praise God, the mouse is dead!
I got 5 or so hugs from my son this afternoon, and he almost picked me up 3 different times.  Oh, puberty, what a mystery you are!
The day is looking up!
Wondering what would happen if "I fake it 'til I make it".
If u build me up, not tear me down, I will do same for u. He forms opinions based on what he observes--he treats us how we treat each other.
Plz do not interfere with my parenting. If my son hears that you do not respect my authority in our household, then why would he respect it?
I really need a cup of java.
A little bored.  Watching DVR'd "The Good Wife".
that last tweet was supposed to say "foot in LR", not "food in LR!"
My cat is terrified of my new ceiling fan. I just figured out today why he hasn't left my room in 5 days!  Poor kitty won't step food in LR!
It is an odd day.
Good night Tweetheads.
Excited about all my new electrical work.  Fewer fire hazards.  Now to find that darn mouse!  Thank God for my "watch cat"!
Checking email on 3 different accounts and signing in seperately on each is a pain in the you-know-what.
Early morning tomorrow. Hope I am more successful @waking up than I was today!  This day totally got away f/me--I was always 3 steps behind!
Catching up on email makes my tushy get sore!
More in the mood for music than for television today. Wish I could find the good stuff. I typed this a long time ago but forgot to tweet it!
More in the mood for music than for television today.  Wish I could find the good stuff.
Even more irritating when my family doesn't get it and that I am the only one irritated.  That just escalates the irritation.  Seriously.
And in the text told me they would be here Friday--as if I have no life and nothing on my calendar!  You have got to be kidding me.
Highly irritated that a professional company texted me this morning to cancel an appointment that yesterday we had agreed to.
Will my dog ever shut up?!
Trying to "window shop" on the computer but it won't connect to any sites!  Stupid computer.
Think Ima go to bed.  Signing out . . .g'night Twits and Tweeps!
Why am I still awake?!  And the house still isn't clean.  There are still hiding places for critters.  UGH.
@twine007 Okay, so what does "pound" followfriday mean? :)  thanks for helping me understand this thing!
Wonder if the mouse is still in the house.  There isn't any evidence, but I never saw it leave, and I never saw it dead.
@twine007 If you are trying to get updates to your phone, just send "on" to twitter. (40404)
@twine007 What does "pound" followFriday do/mean?  and if you type "@" in a tweet, does it tweet directly to that person or what?
@twine007 What r u doin'?!  I have updates sent to my phone and yours have just buzzed my phone non-stop about 20 times for several minutes!
Just got back from the Special Olympics.  They had too many volunteers and no use for us!
No, stupid kitty--you may *not* go outside until you find that mouse you were playing with in the house last night! U have a job 2do first!
Ah, man, I forgot to go to Eskimo Joe's and watch Jenny Labow tonight!
6th grader from Edmond, OK fabulous singing and piano playing Paparazzi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpWRE0kUkOU&feature=youtube_gdata
RT @buzzfeedfeed 7-year Old Girls Attacking Single Ladies [VIDEO] http://bit.ly/dzsYpy Amazing.
Mouse in my house so I am fighting sleep as tired as I am because I am afraid of the mouse.  It could crawl on my in my sleep or something.
It's midnight! OMG where does the time go? Time to sign off!  See you Tweeps tomorrow. Big love!
Kitty loves being behind the stereo a little too much--I'm concerned now about what might be back there!
Silly kitty went behind old stereo & I thought he was playing (all the noise) but he'd gotten himself twisted in the speaker wires &trapped!
@BRADBKJ103 I'm stupid too lol thought the question mark was *just* to me since twitter comes to my phone!  Thanks for responding.
I spent the day with the weedeater and lawnmower.  My hands and feet are still vibrating.
At 4:00 today, God relieved my uncle of his pain and suffering.
Anti-procrastination day-already changed light bulbs, washed bedding &cleaned frig. cat boxes, here I come! Garden, u may have 2 wait a day!
Today is anti-procrastination day, so I am going back 2 bed so I can b well rested 4 all the stuff I have to get done on this vacation day!
Very urked(sp?) that I was browsing an online garden store last night, but when I went 2 it again this morning all their prices had doubled.
The cat was outside!  It must've been the halogen lamp.  All's well that ends well.  Good morning!
I think the cat must've killed the noisy booger.  Hope the cat doesn't get cursed . . .G'night!
They say it's bad luck to kill a cricket, but I'd sooner take a spider outside than try to catch a cricket!  SHUT UP CRICKET!
SHUT UP STUPID CRICKET.
There is a cricket in the house practicing it's mating call. Screeeeech.  . . .
My feet hurt every night lately.  Wonder what I can do differently during the day.
Ahh. Just finished helping my son w/his last minute homework & he is now in bed.  Now it is time 4 "me time"--a little late, but it's mine.
@LaceySchwimmer Post pictures!
Argh, here we go again.  How can I keep the very independent 13 yr old from putting his homework off until 10 pm the night before it's due?!
I paid $8 for a chocolate fudge cake--and it is DRY! argh!
Had tacos 4 dinner & discovered that I *still* can't chew with the right side of my mouth.  Now the whole right side of my face hurts again.
@twine007 I was joking when I answered! I'd die if anyone saw the condition of my house right now!  Hope you get your water on soon. :-)
If all goes well, we are about five years away from a cure for cancer with CancerX!  Researchers need money.
@BRADBKJ103 wondering what the question mark is for--I followed you because of Slow Jams . . .
dewpoint 71
@twine007 You bring it over, I'll throw it in!
The weatherman just got on tv and told us it was "muggy" outside.  I had to laugh at his statement of the obvious!
Why is it that my dog's barking is echoing particularly loudly through the house today?  Does the barometric pressure affect sound?
Tacos for dinner! (skipping tkd because it is so humid out, but I will make up for it later in the week)
In another tornado watch.  Just put a load of laundry in the dryer and one in the washer!
Ima get up and do a load of laundry, oh, yes I am . . .!
I am totally procrasting.  Really have to do laundry, *now*!
Guess the shows won't re-air in the night.  Good night.
@MellyJHart http://twitpic.com/1mtfti - That *is* a good pedicure!
It's dark out, but from what I can tell, my little plants survived the storms!
I have much 2b grateful 4L AFAIK, my family is fine, my house is fine, our pets r fine. My heart goes out to the families of those who died.
Just when I thought I got 2 watch 2 1/2 Men, they cut n with their pretty purple box graphics. They r so proud of their Doplar Radar & such!
If I had a whole keg, I wouldn't have enough beer to drink every time the weather dude says, "tornado"!
And now I smell charcoal. The neighbors are cooking out.  Only in Oklahoma!
I read it to my 13 yr old, and now every few seconds he tells me, "drink" . . . ."drink . . ." . . .lol	(Still thinking about Chuck . . .)
the previous post copied directly from Facebook.
'you can play the Gary england drinking game. everytime he says tornado .u drink! i promise u wont even think about the big bang theory! lol
It's a good night for a beer.
Grrr all the tv shows are replaced by weather coverage tonight.  All clear in Stillwater.
I40 in OKC is shut down both East and West bound due to tornadoes.
It is thundering--I probably shouldn't be on the computer . . .
At least I got my car in garage before the hail started.  The kitties are inside and they are hiding.  The dog is in here staring at me.
And now gray sky, yellow air, and bright white light reflecting off building east of my house.  Beautiful.  We are proud of our tornadoes .
The color of the air outside has gone from green-yellow to off-white.
Hope my little plants survive this storm system.
and here it is--it's like my house is in an ocean . . .
Oh cool!  A windstorm instead of a tornado!  This is different.
Green-yellow sky, hard rain, small hail, slow breeze . . .
@moonfrye Lucky Star, by Madonna
Time to get the flashlights and candles handy.
I tried all day 2 keep the cats in because of the tornado watch.  Now that we are in warning after warning, they r outside & can't be found!
So much for any good tv tonight.  This night is for the meteorologists to shine.
My dog is barking at the wind.
OMG I am so stupid--I think I friend requested my dental student on Facebook before proceeding to express how I felt about my last visit!
Resorted to boring, simple phones without caller ID or electricity.  Oh well, now if I need to call the fire dept or the police, I can.
Unusual storm system? Really?!  This is Oklahoma--how is this unusual?!
Tried everything and can't get the phone to work.   Ugh.
Getting things done today--finally! Printer, telephone, here I come!
Severe weather warning.  Dog outside barking continuously.  Cat meowing continuously.  Birds flying in spirals and loops.
Praying.
off to bed . . .maybe.
My sleep schedule is so twisted.  It's not summer yet--this could be a tough week!
My son "really, literally hope[s I] die!".  Happy Mother's Day to me!
Technology speeds everything up, including the hormones and actions of 13 year olds.  What did teens do before texting at bedtime?
Miss USA live, next Sunday, 6 central time.
My heart feels sad, but tequila makes it feel happy.
Only chewing with left side of my mouth, though . . .
Eating old fiddle faddle and getting toffee stuck in my teeth--toffee that may never come out!
I am really ready for a vacation.  Not looking forward to tomorrow.
Change frightens me, but I get bored when things remain the same.
So excited about Desperate Housewives tonight!  I can't wait until it comes on . . .
Instead of gaining a friend (the fiance), I feel like I am losing a friend.  I hope I am wrong.
Sad 2 see that 1 of my fav. young men is engaged & gonna b a dad .  maybe a bit jealous, 2.  I'd b happy 4 him if she were the right one.
@twine007 It would help if her tweets were public.  Very few people "protect their tweets".
I wish there were one more day in this weekend.  I feel like I lost my Saturday again.  And my Sunday was all backwards and inside-out!
I will be glad when this day is over just so FB can go back to normal.
I received a beautiful Regal Geranium (varying shades of pink) from my son today.  Nice of him to think of me!
It blows my mind that all the "Happy Mother's Day" wishes on FB today are from other mothers, and almost none are from sons or fathers.
Wall clouds forming to the west.  I expect tornadoes soon.
60 degrees and cold outside.  Maybe because it's cloudy, but maybe because a day or 2 ago it was 98 degrees!
I scored   16.5 with GeoFriend, w/ friends in 156 cities, 57 states/regions, 11 countries, 8 govts http://apps.facebook.com/geofriend
falling asleeeepp . . ..
Traffic in town due to college graduation was exetremely stressful today.  I wish I had planned ahead.
I bet Ima feel like a schmuck tomorrow when I see all the FB posts about what a fabulous Mother's Day other people have given their moms.
& isn't stained, ripped, or doesn't have a broken zipper.  Nothing fits!  I need 2 sell everything n my closet & use the $ for more clothes.
Oh, no. Again, I have an event 2 go 2 & nothing 2 wear.  (Nothing that fits, is stylish, seasonal, & doesn't make me look 30 lbs heavier.)
It looks like for Mother's Day, my mom is getting a letter.  Not the most productive day I've ever had . . .!
My success of the day--I made it to a birthday party and socialized with family.  The day is not lost.
Betty White to host SNL! I am tuning in!
I am succeeding at nothing tonight.
I really need 2deadhead my blooms & thin my sprouts, but I have 2 leave n 2.5 hr 4 a bday party (still need 2get gift) & donwannab dirty!
C'mon coffee, kick in already!  I have nothing to wear!
So much to do on a Saturday!  Can't decide where to begin.  Might be nice if I hadn't wasted an hour and a half on hold to Harriet Carter.
How do you send a direct message to someone that noone else sees?  Anyone know?
Happy National Public Gardening Day!
Click! And the elevator music was no more.
51:52 is read out on my phone.  That is after hanging up and calling back twice (both times on hold for 20 minutes).  I'm done.  "we are sor
About to give up on the call so I can feed my family lunch.  Ima b mad if a check bounces because of this!
". . .be with you momentarily . . ." does that mean *today*???  If they are closed on Saturdays, they should say it! Still on hold . . .
I really have better things 2do with my time than 2b on hold, but they charged my bank account $20 they shouldn't have, & that I don't have!
Repeat last tweet.
Still on hold . . ." we are sorry that our operators are still busy.  However, we will be with you momentarily . . .*elevator music* . . ."
Been on hold for 30 minutes to Harriet Carter.  TG I have free nights and *weekends*.
It is hard to keep up with FB on Saturdays!
Drinking instant coffee--YUCK!  Might as well inject it straight into my veins.
I love moderate muscle pain-I hate mild joint pain.
I knew it was 2 good 2b true-forgot to budget bday and mother's day gift and $ I owe my dad. :-(
The wind is louder than the construction today.
Finally purchased Claritin D. Wish it were still prescribed so insurance would still cover it.
Legs are so sore from tkd that it hurts to walk today!
Except now I am having doubts.  Oh, well, I got the point across, didn't I?!
Can I just say, "Yay, me!" (and yeah, I know how to spell 'yea').
Woo Hoo!  Paid my credit card bill 15 days early!  Woo Hoo!
My genius new concoction is making my mouth numb!
10 oz mineral water, 2 tbsp local honey, 5 small Kentucky Mint leaves from my backyard=a tasty treat that helps sinuses!
ahahhhhh. SIGH.  Sore again from tkd, but this is a good thing!
The wind is crazy tough on my garden!  fingers x'd for the fragile sprouts!
Every minute closer to one o'clock is longer than the minute before it.
The day before the day before vacation.
My feet hurt today!
So close to a staycation that i can smell pina coladas!
Loving the smell of  sawdust but not the sound of the saw!
Bird in for a landing on a wire.  After landing, turned a 180 and faced South.
Tired!
11:44 & maybe now I can have some "me time".
Haven't seen or heard from him in a few minutes.  Fingers x'd.
Ritalin and Adderol, PLEASE!  I am no longer against medicating my child.  Isn't the saying, "safety  first"? Oh, & here he is again . . .
My son uses violence on me because he knows I'm not allowed 2 get violent back.  The laws should be changed-Grounding is no match for fists.
Low and behold, here he is again.  Is it wrong that I do not like my child right now?
I am hesitant to go into my son's room and say prayers with him, for fear of getting him "going" again.
I think my own son is going to end up giving me a heart attack--although, I do not totally blame *him*.  I think it goes back a ways.
why does it take 2 hours of my time 2 get my son 2 do chores that only take me 20 min. 2 do alone, & Y does he need constant supervision?!
I think I'm gonna end up falling asleep instead of mowing my lawn again.
Wondering what the long term effects will be if our Mayor gets recalled.
If i whistle at the cute construction guys, is it sexual harassment?
It amazes me how some nails and some boards turn into a sturdy building.
The "chicken dance" is a good alarm clock song to wake up too.
Hump day me my last week before vacation!
Itchy, gunky, allergy eyes.
I have new sprouts this morning! Nasturtium, sweet pea, yellow & green onions!
Aaaahh CHOO!
Wish i had full browser on phone so i could click twitter links while away f/puter.
I have been sitting upright for about 30 minutes now, and sinuses are beginning to drain.
I am still learning the ins and outs and nuances of Twitter.
Need to mow the lawn but cannot breathe the air.
Thought it was puke but it was only popcorn. Hope they dont choke on kernels.
Thank you birds.  Keep up the good work.
going to bed at a decent hour is out the window, but I guess I can get to bed by midnight if I sign off now.  Trading in my glass slippers .
Jaw is still sore from dental work. Will I be feeling pain every day for the rest of my life?  He must've hit a nerve.
How fast the hours fly by.  Where has this day gone??
my ears itch and I have sinus pain.
OMgoodness my dog has gas.
Have been so engrossed n the computer 2day that I didn't realize what a pretty day it is 'til I read 3 such posts on FB,window to the world!
Wish I could give my own mother $.  Enough so she can finally retire.  She works way 2 hard & deserves 2 enjoy life more. But, a card it is.
Mother's Day in a week.  I sure do like tulips . . .
uh oh, computer is functioning very slowly.  Hope I didn't dl a virus.
3 big news stories 2day:  flooding that carried buildings down the Interstate nTennessee, bomb scare in Times Square, and oil spill in Gulf.
I have found that laying old carpet/rug on garage floor, then vacuuming when needed is far easier than trying to sweep the garage.
Finding open seed packets all over house.  Guess I better vacuum before plants start growing out of the living room carpet!
@twine007 But Ima probably do it anyway!
@twine007 seems like I should lose weight before I attempt jump roping--bad on knees, isn't it?  And bladder after having babies. TMI? lol
I don't have to be perfect! Didn't get the garage clean, but made a place for the car and cleared off 2 chairs for watching lightning shows.
Couldn't find my clothes.  Went 2 do a load of laundry, & low and behold, there they were--had been sitting in the washer 4 an entire week!
When I start putting things away in drawers, I can never find them.  I forgot that I even had onions or potatoes in the house!
@twine007 my arms can do some damage!  Now, if I could just lose the fat that is under the muscle . ..
fading . . . zzz
where has my day gone? I had planned to accomplish so much, but accomplished close to nothing!
push ups = sore arms.
Pomegranate margarita.  Very good.
I just love how we all wish each other happy birthday on our Facebook pages!
Ahhh medium short/long bath followed by efficient shower.  I must've smelled something awful! lol
It's all planted.Almost 8:00 &the clouds r gathering above-looks ominous.Hope my transplants can handle what the sky will throw@'em tonight.
Can't decide between long soak in tub followed by quick shower (for hair), or long shower.
Breathing with difficulty.  Hope it is just allergies. Very wheezy.  Hope lungs are clear by tomorrow.
If I gardened all day and am sore and filthy as a result, does it count as daily exercise?
Gonna spend time uploading gardening pics to Facebook tonight.
Today the allergens in the air are many.  Wheezing.  Going to plant my herbs anyway, then stand in a steam shower until water gets cold.
Barking less.  Getting low on air?  Over heating? Giving up?
Furious.  Poor dog.
Cannot believe people still leave their dogs in the car on sunny days.
I am looking forward to the sound of silence.
Stupid smart text.  I meant 'brick', not 'arial'.
Kind of like latch hook except on a larger scale.
How frustrating it must be to lay one arial at a time.
Just realized I have hardly tweeted a thing today.  Winding down and taking it easy.  Trying not to "should on myself".
They are making mortar and laying brick.  Pretty cool, but noisy.
Don't know why I didn't think of it earlier but I started eating local honey yesterday that I got from the craft fair.
Too noisy with construction, lawn equipment, wind, and a static-y radio station.
Takin' it easy now.  Goodnight Twitter world.
I think I'm gonna make it 'til tomorrow.  Now if only I can get my son up early enuf 4 him 2 b productive, & me still function thru the day.
Salmon and cream cheese on a triscuit or sardines on wheat thins sound good right now.  I am not a seafood eater.  What gives?
I hear the 50 mph wind gusts outside my windows.  I hope my new gardens and seedlings and transplants withstand it!
Watching ANTM and thinking New Zealand must have a certain prejudice against plus size models.
Really hate the touchpad on my laptop.  I keep rolling my hands over it and losing my text and have to retype everything!
Looks like China was stripped of Olympic Medal in gymnastics for 2000 for a competitor who was too young.  I thought so!
Now gonna watch Idol and ANTM dvr'd.
Well, I guess he's down enuf I can take a pill 4 the pain now.  Wasn't about 2 parent while "under the influence".  Keep fingers crossed.
@moonfrye that looks like an o'possum!  they usu. play dead when u c them.  Rare to see one looking alive like that!
I think the teen is finally going to leave me alone and get in his bed.  I don't have to call 911 on my own kid after all.
yay I don't have to sleep in clothes tonight! Woo hoo!
And the guy teaching the class is *very* mad at me!
Let my son stay overnight at grandparents so I could go to a special karate class.  I missed the class and now I'm missing my son!
I wanna eat.  I think I want chocolate.
Wish I had a personal trainer who could get me skinny. Right now I need to do yoga (esp. for the bum) but not gonna unless someone makes me!
I can't believe I can still feel all my pains (jaw, face, tooth, lip, foot, etc.) when I am loopy as hell from this pain pill!
Seriously, my buns won't budge.
The workout was taekwondo class(& I put a lot n2 it w/my new motivation) & I'm oddly aware of my buns-I guess those kicks take butt muscles!
I remember Buns of Steel.  I have the video but don't think I've ever done it. After my intense workout last night, my buns feel like steel!
Pain pill finally kicked in.  I feel loopy.
Haven't been able to get warm since Sunday morning.  Brrr.
I absolutely hate the sound of a ticking clock.  Tickticktickticktickticktick . . .so incessant! And hypnotic. Ugh.
Broke ground for a sort of new garden.  Gonna try lettuce & cabbage this time.  Just planted those, & eggplants, tomatoes, & onions.
Why am i still so tired?
sooooo tired . . . . .zzz
My lower lip is in so much pain today.  Sun, wind and salty food are not helping.  The idea of polysporin on my lip is tempting . . .
Feels like winter.  Brr.
Turning the heater on.
I am ready for 1 o'clock
F*cking insomnia wins again.  Wow, I wonder how many new strangers will follow my tweets from that keyword (insomnia).
Finally molded my mouthpiece.  I wonder how yesterday would have been different if I had taken care of that *prior* to the tournament!
Gums are sore and face is holding tension.  Is it too late for a glass of wine?
Really hate it that commercials are ten numbers louder than shows.
Found lipstick in the washer.  Glad I got it before it went in the dryer.
Well, left my mother's house without the door hitting me in the face--barely.
Got stuff planted. :)  Still reviewing my sparring match in my head and all the things I could have done differently.
