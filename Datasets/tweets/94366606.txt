Read what AAR's CEO Edward Hamberger has to say about rail safety and positive train control, in the morning's @WSJ: http://t.co/sc1hTNzMVm
Thanks to the Staggers Act, railroads have reinvested $575B since 1980 into the nation's rail infrastructure http://t.co/Q4ICwCPvUa
Rail uses state of the art tech like #PositiveTrainControl to ensure safety. It's complicated to build &amp; deploy http://t.co/g4HzItmZKL
Railroads are well on their way toward implementing #PositiveTrainControl technology. Safety is our top priority: http://t.co/qGlXWlliT0
Before we can deploy #PositiveTrainControl across our ntwk, we must test its safety. We're working hard to do that: http://t.co/WEKPunQUQS
Deploying complex PTC technology safely is a massive &amp; long project that railroads are committed to. See our progress http://t.co/w7vqL387wF
Ensuring PTC is deployed safely across our network is a top priority for freight rail and one we're committed to: http://t.co/fdUR49Kqts
#PositiveTrainControl is not off-the-shelf technology, &amp; must be fully tested for safety before it can be deployed. http://t.co/VuzJ7CHf7P
Freight rail is working hard to implement the complex Positive Train Control system. We have invested &gt;$5B so far http://t.co/fRhY3wImqF
Thanks for joining our conversation about investing in rail infrastructure. #RebuildRenew See you tomorrow! http://t.co/Bwe4x3xsXA
Due to balanced regulation, railroads have been able to reinvest back into the rail network. #RebuildRenew http://t.co/qT7OIcr907
You know that rail invests tons in its #infrastructure. But how do we compare to other industries? Take a look: http://t.co/GBvOGSTLp2
Railroads' investments in the network allow for strong #infrastructure that supports the whole freight supply chain http://t.co/BEhFVRiBZY
Railroads have spent tons on #infrastructure &amp; equipment in the past 35 yrs. Thx #StaggersAct http://t.co/JRvCdywSA0 http://t.co/XaKmvsTWB9
AAR's CEO testified this morning on Capitol Hill about the #StaggersAct &amp; how it's changed the rail industry. Live: http://t.co/ebmmskx9WH
