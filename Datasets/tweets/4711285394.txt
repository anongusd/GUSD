Victory So Far Over 13mL/kg/hr https://t.co/NyYY59jYEQ via @Change
@SeemaCMS Then you need to call @FreseniusKC @DaVita etc and tell them to dialyze me right. They're taking advantage of this stupid 13mL study and apparently forcing it even though it's hurting me. They want us to run more and longer so they can bill you more.
@LeadingAge @SeemaCMS @mcknightsltcn That's just great. Their so called quality measures is why my health has gone downhill in the last 1.5 years. They need to the control the budget and leave everything else to the professionals.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@QualisHealth @CMSGov needs to take action for those with #ESRD for several years. Deregulate or relax the 13mL/kg/hr rule. We know our bodies inside and out better than they do. It's criminal to force a regulation detrimental to someone's health. #PutYourselfInMyShoes		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@AJMC_Journal @SeemaCMS @CMSGov They're doing nothing to empower patients. They're making things complicated and sending more (dialysis) patients to the hospital. Amongst others. They're making some doctors want to stop practicing. They're nothing but control freaks.
@CMSGov @PAHumanServices You build from the foundation-up. #QualityImprovement must start with doctors and patients.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov @calderlynch Hopefully that will trickle down to the patients, nurses, and doctors having more flexibility. I don't know who at your staff thinks they're my doctor, but they can go back where they came from. They were not invited.
@QIOProgram One ESRD quality of measure that needs to go is 13mL/kg/hr. Either that or be relaxed and not forced on patients. What might help one patient can hurt another. Quit treating us like robots from the same manufacturer. Attn @CMSGov @SeemaCMS 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@CMSGov I hold @CMSGov and anyone who follows their lead accountable for the pain and suffering I've endeared since Aug '17 when their stupid 13mL/kg/hr regulation was first forced on me. I've felt bad more during that time than my first 22 years on dialysis combined. (Jul '95 - Jul '17)
@SeemaCMS From 2014 to 2017 I have all my dialysis run sheets showing I removed more than 13mL/kg/hr over 75% of the time with no issues. P.S. We can't die in the hospital if you're not sending us there.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@JohnRMontford @NephRodby For me, someone who is small and active, it is very hard to only gain 1.4 kilos or less in 72 hours. (Fri-Mon) My gains have never been a lot more. For 22 years I was always able to get to my dry weight with no issues. Now, I leave the clinic sometimes already over my limit.
An example how dialysis patients differ: some are diabetic, some like me have had parathyroid surgery (low calcium and phosphorus) some are allergic to some things. So forcing the 13mL/kg/hr rule is like forcing us to eat the same meals. Use your common sense @CMSGov @SeemaCMS
@johncampbelll I don't know if it's any encouragement but I was in a coma for 3 days in 2004 from fluid overload. I passed out on a Sun night and woke up Thu morning in ICU. I don't know John's situation but I'll pray he pulls through.
@SeemaCMS I'm a kidney dialysis patient, but never once considered myself vulnerable until @CMSGov took it upon themselves to play God and take control away from my doctor. IMO you can unGod yourselves and let me and my doctor control my dialysis. #WorkedFor22Years		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
#CMSQualCon19 		Please relax the 13mL/kg/hr rule. It doesn't benefit everyone. I know this from 23+ years experience. I'm not someone who hides incognito. I'm a real patient with real issues. My health has gone downhill in the last 1.5 years. #MyOwnWords		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh https://t.co/YAf9VbuOMO
@NGanesanAvalere @SeemaCMS For me personally they've done none of the above.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KathleenOrland @PauleyP JW's are very misled.
@NKF_Advocacy @nkf @CMSGov They have done absolutely nothing to improve the quality of my care in the last two years.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS Seriously? You, @CMSGov, a government agency likes to control things they know nothing about. And is why my own health has gone downhill in the last 1.5 years.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KathyCa85916507 It's not that easy. They override the doctor's orders. That's a main argument I'm having with them. I can dialyze extra hours, but for me 1 extra hour only removes a half of a kilo more. If I want to get to my dry weight, sometimes I have to not eat or drink between treatments.
@MaddensPharma @SeemaCMS @SecAzar @POTUS @Commpharmacy @CGrantWSJ @YahooNews I understand why. I've contemplated quitting dialysis because of @CMSGov BS. My issue is a little different. The 13mL/kg/hr rule they're forcing on clinics is hurting me. Nonetheless I completely understand.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
I had hypertension 19 years that went away in 2014. I've been off BP meds since then. Now my BP is high again thanks to the clinic not pulling enough fluid off. (Thank you, @CMSGov.) My pre BP at dialysis was 181/122. And they had the nerve to ask me if I took my meds today.

@AdvDialysis You don't need more treatments. You can only get your blood so clean at a time. You can wear out your fistula sticking it more often. You don't need extra treatments to pull extra fluid unless you are way overloaded. Don't ask me how I know. Been doing this 23+ years.
This is what happens when fluid builds up. Thanks to the rule I left Friday 1.5 kgs over, which is my "limit." I've only gained 2 more kgs. I don't dialyze for  7 more hours. Not pictured is the difficulty breathing and hypertension. Dry weight may be less from not eating enough. https://t.co/cf3ToGlNry
@rcamd Thanks. I spoke to someone at  my local Network. He said I can do sequential dialysis to remove all the excess fluid. I was willing to switch from 3 to 4 hours to do this. But not willing to do cleansing the entire 4 hours for just an extra half kilo. But area mng stopped that.
@SeemaCMS Prove it then. I'm not getting value based care thanks to @CMSGov regulations. My chronic condition is complex. You can't treat me the same as someone next to me. Your patient safety sucks since you're slowly trying to kill me. Spew this crap to someone else.
@AdvDialysis You need more precise studies to change my mind. How many of the patients were taken way below their "dry" weight? Which causes minor symptoms way before death occurs. Or other health issues? High potassium? You can't put everyone under the same bubble.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@CDCareOhio Yes, my favorite cereal, Shredded Wheat, is high in Potassium. But I still eat it now and again and adjust my diet accordingly.
@TheRoctor_MD No. I'm fortunate that my dialysis treatments are covered. But the downside to that is @CMSGov brings it on themselves to control how my treatments are conducted. They don't care if their one size fits all policy hurts some of the patients. That's why I'm not better off.
@Locke_Wiggins @minyminuskidney @AOC @pelosi I think we took two roads to arrive at the same point. I totally agree.
@Locke_Wiggins @minyminuskidney @AOC @pelosi I really don't think you understand the situation. This is a federal, National regulation. If it was something easy as taking my business elsewhere I would.
@Locke_Wiggins @minyminuskidney @AOC @pelosi In my case the clinic is only following a federal rule because they're afraid being shutdown. If they wanted me to stay healthy and on dialysis they would fight this with me, since most agree with me anyway. I'm only a victim of the 13mL/kg/hr rule. Nothing else.
@Locke_Wiggins @minyminuskidney @AOC @pelosi Hard for me to be a cash cow if I'm dead. Besides this is a federal regulation out of the clinic's control. And everything was just fine for me the first 22 years on dialysis. But the last 1.5 have seen my health significantly go down hill.
@DawnJos33585941 @SeemaCMS @CMSGov I understand completely. There was a time I thought I could live another 40 years on dialysis. (I'm 39 and been on 23 years.) But their ridiculous policies won't see to that. Mainly referring to the "one size fits all" 13mL/kg/hr regulation.

@PatK1756 @SeemaCMS There's lots of things @CMSGov doesn't take into consideration. I've never seen an organization with so much lack of common sense anywhere.
@holly_sruart @SeemaCMS I started assuming that a couple of weeks ago. But still when she's ready to log in and see this for herself I'll be ready. I know she knows I'm frustrated with this rule. And I know why she's afraid to change it. I just want to sit down with her 20 minutes. #ButUntilItAffectsHer
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov I wish I could have been able to send a comment about the 13mL rule instead of being blindsided by it. You're overstepping your boundaries with this regulation and hurting a lot of dialysis patients.
I showed up at dialysis 3 kilos over my dry weight. But I only gained 1.9. After rinse back when I leave I'll be over my max of 1.4 going into Monday. What do you want me to do, @CMSGov and @SeemaCMS practically starve myself this weekend? You try it.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS This is just a stupid joke I don't find funny. You don't care about patients. I have all the info I need to prove your 13mL/kg/hr rule hurts me more than it helps. Why don't you say something about this? Don't tell everyone you care when I know you don't.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@MailMyStatement @healthcaredive Pointless to try to enforce. There are a lot of people,  especially in rural towns, who don't have more than 1 option. For someone so hell bent on people reporting those who don't, it's funny she says there's no way to enforce. IMO no one at CMS has a clue what they're doing.
@SeemaCMS Just like a government agency to care more about money than the patient's actual health. Referring to your stupid regulations harming some patients. But you don't care as long as it only hurts some of us. 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS @nytimes Seema, who are you to tell us to demand more? I've been demanding @CMSGov to lift the stupid 13mL/kg/hr regulation for over a year, now. Until you're in our shoes you'll never understand. You don't care what some of us have to go through. #cmspowertrip		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@enBloomMedia @CMSGov @SeemaCMS 2/ after dialyzing 22 years with no issues. One size does not fit all. Instead of treating the patients as individuals they force standard rules based on inconsistent studies.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@enBloomMedia @CMSGov Ms. Hughley, the link you shared says you're a patient advocate. If you're going to be at said conference please relay this message to @SeemaCMS. What @CMSGov is doing is criminal and they can't say it's for my own good. My health has severely declined the last 1.5 years...
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov I  do have access to my own #healthcare data, @SeemaCMS. If you actually studied my data you would know the 13mL/kg/hr regulation hurts me more than it helps. And I am not the only one in this position. You claim to care about the patients, but you only care about ###'s and $$$.
@DeriveHealth @modrnhealthcr @CMSGov Not sure who is single handedly responsible for the ESRD Quality Measures. But to implement a policy that has no affect on most patients and hurts some is criminal and should be against the law. 13mL/kg/hr is stupid. Studies are inconsistent and too many factors not considered.
@ChadDKollas @CMSGov Nothing @CMSGov has done for me has been about improving care.
@AKF_Advocacy @Kidney_X @HHSIDEALab Let's start by treating the patients as individuals.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS Chronic conditions are complex, Seema. That's why you and @CMSGov need to back off the clinics and let the nurses do their jobs. My nephrologist should be the only one writing my dialysis prescription. #RenalFailure #Hypervolemia #PatientRights 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS Prove you want to put #PatientsOverPaperwork. Deregulate this stupid 13mL/kg/hr regulation you force on dialysis clinics despite the fact it hurts a lot of patients. Quit pretending like you care.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@LillyStairs @SeemaCMS What she needs to make transparent are rules and regulations forced by @CMSGov that hurt some patients. They have a "one size fits all" mentality. Patients are different and need to be treated according to his/her needs.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@savvy_coop @SeemaCMS I know first hand Seema Verma is not about empowering patients. I know what's best for me and so does my doctor. But universal standards forced by @CMSGov has made my health worse in the last year than my first 22 years as a dialysis patient combined.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@4Data_Science @SeemaCMS @nytimes Not all @CMSGov policies are patient friendly. They're either not or just irrelevant. The 13mL/kg/hr policy they force on dialysis clinics hurts more patients than it helps them. Too many inconsistencies with their studies and things they don't consider.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KidneyTreat I can see this being a problem. It's hard to go regular if you can't eat regularly. Thanks to @CMSGov this is just one of many problems dialysis patients have to deal with that they shouldn't.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@Oomlaaters @Jules_GastroRD @RD_Catherine You'd have a heart attack if I told you my K level was 9.3 at the time of my diagnosis. Age 15. Circa: 1995.
@CMSGov I really want to know more about this patient-centered care. Maybe patient-centered-we could care less. If you cared about the patients you'd let the doctors do the jobs they went to medical school for.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@CMSGov In 1995 I was misdiagnosed 3 times before determining I had ESRD. How can you say this 13mL rule is best for me? You don't know me. You haven't been through what I have. Until you personally assess my condition you can't force this rule on me legally. One size does not fit all.
@christinear17 @stevecripe57 @SeemaCMS @BeaconHealthSys Exactly, but they don't have any common sense. They just want to show they're in control.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov I watched a preview video for this. Why do they want to lie and say their number one objective is to put patients first? You and they don't care about the patients. Unless you think caring is forcing regulations that hurt people. I can personally feel how much you really care.
@SeemaCMS As someone who has worked many years in transportation you can't compare prices to rates. Too many factors play into the final price. I, personally, feel you have more important things to worry about.
@Brettnay69 I tried nocturnal. My recovery time was 100% worse for me personally. I've very rarely felt bad post treatment. But when I switched to nocturnal I couldn't drive home hardly or stay awake throughout the day. Had to switch back.
@IvankaTrump @PressSec For the record @CMSGov is still operating under the shutdown. And they're slowly killing me with their mandated regulations. Right now the government isn't helping me. Someone needs to deregulate this stupid 13mL/kg/hr rule.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Here's an example of how we're different. If you knew anything about renal failure you would know that's a very low phosphorus level. Unheard of in most patients. Also Kt/V more than enough at 3 hours. Fluid gains within reason. Stop 13mL/kg/hr! https://t.co/hSNvydHy3D
@minyminuskidney @SeemaCMS @CMSGov They can't. My limit is way less than that.
@NicoleAuerbach Instead of blaming the rules blame KC's defense. Chiefs knew they had a problem when they played the Pats the 1st time, and then gave up 54 to the Rams despite scoring 51. I don't like the OT rules either but KC's defense are the ones to blame.
@rebeinstein What does it matter? No matter what you say or do half the country is going to hate you. No matter who you are. You don't even have to be a politician.

@SeemaCMS I hope you're enjoying your holiday. I still have to go to dialysis. Not sure how many more times, since your stupid regulations have been slowly doing me in for the last 1.5 years. ###'s and $$$ over patients.
@SeemaCMS You have no right to force regulations detrimental to my health. It is criminal and should be against the law.
@SeemaCMS You need to tell @CMSGov to back off the clinics and doctors. Let the nephrologists do the jobs they went to med school many years to learn. You are not a doctor.
@SeemaCMS I have a dream. That you'll fix this 13mL/kg/hr problem. It doesn't help everyone. I'm just one of anout 50,000 patients hurt by this regulation. Until this affects you directly you'll never care or understand. You can't make standardized rules when it comes to people's health.

Let me get this straight, @SeemaCMS of @CMSGov. This article suggests a weight gain for me of no more than 5% between treatments. That means I can take off 2.6 like ALWAYS. Your stupid 13mL/kg/hr rule limits me to 1.4. Not PER DAY. 1.4 BETWEEN TREATMENTS.		https://t.co/Ui4XlUxzhx
@SeemaCMS You assume as long as I can still tweet I'm okay. Guess what, I'm not okay. Either you don't care, or you're too ignorant to understand. Even if this only affects 10% of all patients that's still 50,000 of 500,000. A lot of us are suffering thanks to @CMSGov. https://t.co/vk6IY1Oh9E
@SeemaCMS Ok, I read it. Now, put this stupid 13mL/kg/hr rule on your agenda, and relay the message to Mary Albin. What you're forcing clinics to do is criminal and you're hurting a lot of patients. #Nephrology #Hemodialysis #FluidOverLoad #PatientsRights @CMSGov 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@MJsLoveSlave @MsJenSteele @CMSGov I'm also in Texas. I know exactly. I've never had to pull off a lot either. But I work 12 hours a day Sat Sun Mon before I go in Monday evening. And I can't do that without eating and quenching my thirst like a normal person. But it's like a snowball effect the rest of the week.
@MJsLoveSlave @MsJenSteele @CMSGov I'm frustrated because they're telling me what's worked 22 years suddenly doesn't anymore.
@MJsLoveSlave @MsJenSteele @CMSGov The issue is the doctors have no authority to override it. What the clinic is doing is criminal but they're not breaking any laws because they're following the "rules" handed down from @CMSGov. 1.9 is my max and .5 is rinse back.
@MJsLoveSlave @MsJenSteele You don't have to stay in fluid overload. None of us do. Clinics can safely remove more fluid than @CMSGov is allowing. My problem right now is malnutrition and dehydration trying to stay under my limit. This doesn't hurt every single patient though.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS @Cascadia @CMSGov You should make public federal regulations that clinics have to follow that my doctor can't override that are hurting some, if not a lot of patients. You don't care because it doesn't affect you. If you don't change it I hope one day it does.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov 	Forcing dialysis patients to use the same formula when doing treatment is like telling us to wear the same size clothes. Works for some but others are just S.O.L. Which means I'm just S.O.L. My gravestone WILL have your direct phone numbers. #moneyoverpatients
@SeemaCMS My health and life are not up for debate. And you're trying to force something that can't properly be policed. Also, when you go to an ER you may not know what's wrong. They run tests you didn't know you needed. This is stupid. Who comes up with this crap? #WheresTheCommonSense?
@SeemaCMS Okay, so our treatments, procedures, etc. will be covered. What good is that when some of us are getting inadequate care as a result of stupid regulations set forth by @CMSGov? One size DOES NOT fit all.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@signaturedoc @CMSGov CMS thinks it's funny to make things complicated and screw with patients' health. Their job is to distribute the money fairly.

@SeemaCMS Why do you care about something pointless? I can't afford it if I look at the menu or not. Your need to focus on the actual care of the patients by staying away and letting the doctors and nurses do their jobs.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@Cascadia @SeemaCMS @CMSGov I'm glad you brought that up. My doctor where I'm at only practices at 2 of the 4 hospitals and 2 of the 6 clinics. #SeemaVerma is very disconnected, along with the rest of the staff at CMS.
@Kate4Queen @SeemaCMS This is just another example of @CMSGov changing something that doesn't need to be changed. Every time someone new is in charge anywhere they feel they have to change something. Especially at CMS.
@SeemaCMS Start caring about the actual health of the patients. I've sent you countless tweets. You don't respond because you have no answers. My issue doesn't affect all dialysis patients. That's why I would like it if you stayed out from between me and my doctor.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Dialysis is also complex. Every patient is different and you can't force a regulation that hurts some of us. Whoever @CMSGov is responsible needs to be fired. However, #SeemaVerma, you can do something about it. #renal #fluidoverload #lungs #hypertension		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@KidneyBuzz I'm not concerned one bit. @CMSGov is forcing regulations detrimental to the health of many kidney dialysis patients. They need to worry about distributing the money fairly and quit trying to play doctor. I hired a nephrologist already to do that. And his name is not #SeemaVerma.
@HHSRegion5 Someone needs to step up and deregulate the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. Or allow me to sign an AMA form, especially if my nephrologist agrees the policy is not in the best interest of my own health.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@hhsregion3 When will someone stand up for the 13mL/kg/hr epidemic? Opioids are only dangerous to those who choose to abuse them. I'm being forced to use a formula concocted by @CMSGov that's harmful and needs to be outlawed.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@utopiahcc Dialysis was just fine for me for 22 years, before @CMSGov forced the 13mL/kg/hr regulation on all clinics across the USA. The policy does more harm than helps and needs to be banned ASAP. #SeemaVerma @SeemaCMS		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@HealthRecovery1 @CMSGov needs to quit forcing regulations that don't pertain to them. Their 13mL/kg/hr rule should be against the law. Yes it might be fine for some but it's hurting a lot of other patients. They obviously know nothing about hemodialysis. #nephrology		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@heyitschloejade @CMSGov @SeemaCMS That's really awesome of you. Thanks.
@heyitschloejade I started following you when I read your bio. I would appreciate any shout out. I'm a 23+ year hemodialysis patient currently fighting the 13mL/kg/hr rule forced by @CMSGov. Please read sign and RT. #SeemaVerma @SeemaCMS 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@kidney_boy @NephJC You can contribute a lot of the fluid overload to the current @CMSGov 13mL/kg/hr regulation. I know there should be a limit, but that limit should only be determined by each individual patient and their nephrologist.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@TitoTitoq85 @god Think of the dialysis as the reason you get to enjoy another birthday. Then it'll make it feel even better. Happy Birthday 🎂
@KathyCa85916507 @ESRD_HSAG @CMSGov No, I ran that long because the 13 rule caused my fluid level to get that high. Not very high. But according to the rule to remove 3.3 (technically 2.8) I have to run 5 hours. It happened to be on a lab day. I can honestly say I felt no better at kt/v 2.5 as I did at 1.5
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Then I suggest you start allowing the doctors and patients to make those decisions. You have no right forcing a rule that's detrimental to my health. This statement makes you look very two-face.13mL/kg/hr probably hurts someone you love. #youdontcare		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@HITECHAnswers @CMSGov I highly reccomend eliminating the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. No one knows me better than my nephrologist. Or at least allow me to sign an AMA form especially if my doctor agrees.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@NRAA1 You can contribute a lot of dialysis patient hospital readmissions to @CMSGov. Their stupid regulations hurt more patients than they help. Politicians are NOT doctors.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@ambarkeluskar @SeemaCMS @CMSGov They don't have common sense.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov You haven't done anything to empower the patients. We know our bodies better than you. My doctor knows me better than you. Stay in your office and do the job you were appointed. Let the doctors do their jobs and quit screwing with my health.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@Mygreatredmare @CMSGov Thank you
@KathyCa85916507 @ESRD_HSAG @CMSGov My only issues with running extra treatments are my clinic's hours of operation other patients and I have a fistula that is 13 years old and I would prefer not to stick it more than I have to. I ran 5 hours once on a lab day (only need 3) and my kt/v was 2.7. I felt no different.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov We know the inside scoop. You and @CMSGov make regulations that don't pertain to you. Your job is to distribute the money fairly and help people save money. So I'd appreciate it if you would quit trying to play doctor and let my nephrologist do that.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KathyCa85916507 @ESRD_HSAG @CMSGov There shouldn't even be a standard formula. Every patient is different. The nephrologist should be the one making that call. I have no problem using it as a guideline but I should be able to sign an AMA form if I need to remove more. Especially if I have my doctor's approval.
This is why I protest the 13mL/kg/hr regulation forced on dialysis centers by @CMSGov. I've always watched my intake and safely removed what I needed. But now the bar is set too low and it's causing problems from every angle. Politicians are NOT doctors.		https://t.co/xyDZLKpQ7L
@ESRD_HSAG Fluid overload is a major issue and why I wound up in a coma in 2004 after missing B2B treatments. For 22 years I've carefully watched my gains and removed the necessary amount each time. Now @CMSGov has the bar set too low. 13mL/kg/hr has no ill affects on some patients.
@plznigga It's sad that you running a full treatment does depend on someone else's schedule. I deal with the same thing a lot myself. My clinic loves to use the cut off time as much as they can.
@CBSNews Would have been funnier if @AlabamaFTBL would've won and he bought a bunch of @drpepper. #ForrestGump
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Why are you trying to build a wall to protect me from Mexico? I need protection from @CMSGov who wants to hurt me with ignorant regulations detrimental to my health. #SeemaVerma #Dialysis #Hypervolemia #PatientsRights STOP 13mL/kg/hr 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@CMSGov @SeemaCMS		To tell me someone 4 times heavier than me has 4 times the tolerance is crazy. Fluid overload damages the heart and lungs and just because someone weighs more doesn't mean their organs are that much larger. Don't tell me what's worked 22 years doesn't anymore.
@HHSRegion10 @Kidney_X 13mL/kg/hr needs to go first. There are too many inconsistencies with the study. Patients' bodies are not the same and react to treatment differently. It's dangerous and unhealthy for lightweight patients. Everyone has a limit, that should only be set by their doctor. #CMSGov
@SeemaCMS, address the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. But don't sugarcoat it. It hurts some patients more than others. You and @CMSGov have no desire to put us first. Every patient is different. You obviously know nothing about hemodialysis.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh https://t.co/OiXf32OM1A
@jessieopie Yes, but it's usually by choice.
I thought I'd be going into my 40's with at least 40 more years to live. @CMSGov regulations on dialysis centers are making it hard to achieve that for patients in my position. What may be the solution for some can have negative affects on others. 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KidneyParker Sounds great but if you're bound and gagged by the same @CMSGov policies every other clinic is then it will do me no good as a patient. I wish I could afford private insurance but I don't know if that would matter either.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@MyBenefitsGuide The answer is yes and no. Take "dialysis" out of the equation and determine if the person needs assistance without dialysis being the deciding factor. A lot of well bodied individuals on dialysis. I don't draw SSI because I'm single, able to work and like to go out and have fun.
@TheTalkCBS Yes, but just for fun. I like seeing all the funny and creative ones.
@SenSanders A huge problem with #medicareforall is the government trying to control how procedures are done just because they're paying. Their lack of knowledge about dialysis is why I am in the shape I'm in today. I agree with the Medicare For All movement but politicians are NOT doctors.
@KIDNEY4Amy What good would that do? Most congressmen are well off financially or have savings to fall back on. It would be nothing more than an extended Christmas vacation for most. I think both sides are acting very childish, and caught in the middle are decent hard working Americans.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Seema, You just worry about the "affordable." Leave the "high-quality" to the nephrologists, and the "patient-centered" to the nurses and technicians.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@CMSGov Deregulate this ridiculous 13mL/kg/hr rule. You can't regulate how much fluid can be removed solely based on weight. A lot of patients larger than me are allowed to remove more fluid, but their heart and lungs are not much larger than mine. You and @SeemaCMS are not Drs.
@SeemaCMS you obviously don't understand how patients' bodies react in different ways. To help you understand why my dialysis needs to be different from someone else's; you wouldn't like it if my paycheck matched yours despite you have a higher education and more responsibility.
@Jennygfw I know exactly what you mean.
@TheRoctor_MD I would literally die if I ate a "healthy" diet and drank 8 glasses of water per day. #dialysis
@drerniesussman @SeemaCMS I only have this one issue with @SeemaCMS and @CMSGov. I've tried multiple ways to reach her, including two senators. Which CMS sidestepped the issue and claimed they didn't understand the complaint. If they're that dumb they don't need to be in charge.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@DCI_Dialysis For @CMSGov to deregulate the 13mL/kg/hr rule or allow me to sign an AMA form especially if my doctor agrees the regulation causes more harm than helps. They need to stop with the one size fits all policies. I'm tired of them playing games with my health.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@DialysisSaves @ChronicRights No. I know this from experience. First 22 years of dialysis I had no problems with the way I was dialyzed, until @CMSGov wanted to control every little thing. Nephrologists should be the only ones writing dialysis prescriptions.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@NKF_Advocacy High Quality Care starts by treating patients as individuals and staying out from between them and their doctors. #cms #seemaverma 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@KathyCa85916507 @DrMichaelMosley You'd gasp if I told you what I ate as a dialysis patient. I'm a rare case where I'm not diabetic and because of parathyroid surgery I have very low calcium and phosphorus levels so I'm encouraged to eat cheese and drink dark colas etc. Still have to watch the potassium though.
@ajgneedsakidney My clinic allows us to eat on the machine. I know some don't but they should. I feel like I'm starving a lot because of the stupid CMS rule. I have to skip meals and stay thirsty half the time if I want to stay under the "limit." Are you affected by this?		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@colleenmfarrell @harvardmed As a 23+ dialysis patient I've had a lot of experiences from being in a coma for 3 days, parathyroid surgery, not urinating 13 years, hypertension that went away after 19 years, and now my fight with CMS over the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. #thatsnotall		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@HHSRegion7 I wish Seema Verma would talk about the 13mL/kg/hr rule and explain why @CMSGov thinks what's right for one person is right for another. To give all patients the exact same treatment is dangerous and criminal. We're not all the same. She is NOT my doctor.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@DebraLGriffin @SeemaCMS @CMSGov don't care about the patients. The regulation I'm fighting doesn't negatively affect every dialysis patient. But we're stuck in a one size fits all vacuum. Small and lightweight patients are really suffering and Seema Verma doesn't care.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@accovic Everyone has a limit. But that limit should be left up to the patient and their nephrologist. @CMSGov is crossing a line with the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. It's ridiculous to think someone 4 times larger than me is allowed 7.5 extra kilos. That's bad on anyone's heart and lungs.
@MNdriftless @ddiamond @rachanadixit IMO she's not smart. She doesn't understand that not all dialysis patients are the same. To put it where @SeemaCMS might understand: Everybody can't fit in the same size clothes. @CMSGov needs to treat us as the individuals we are. 		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@ezgimpin I don't understand why you think fried chicken is crap food. And since I'm not working toward a transplant it doesn't matter. I was only being sarcastic anyway. I don't eat it by the bucketful. You know I'd love to drink more milk v8 juice and eat bananas etc. But potassium.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov The only "burdensome regulations" I know of are made up and enforced by you and @CMSGov. Money may be a problem, but screwing with someone's actual health is a bigger one.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@LuisEnr80631682 I don't know if this is a problem in Mexico but @CMSGov in the United States wants to leave extra fluid on a lot of patients with zero concern for the complications.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@ezgimpin LOL. Sounds like something I'd do. I'm always eating fried chicken on dialysis. Or chicken gizzards.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov @POTUS If you cared about the patients you wouldn't enforce this 13mL/kg/hr rule. That maybe some patient's limit. But to put everyone in a "one size fits all" vacuum is dangerous and should be against the law. But until it affects you personally you'll never understand or even care.
@ballardsigns @aribindi @SeemaCMS Dialysis is expensive. I need the financial help to stay alive. Medicare pays for my dialysis. I don't draw SSI or food stamps. I just wish they would quit changing things that have a negative affect on my health. I dialyzed 22 years with no issues before the 13mL/kg/hr rule.
@DCHIMA4 @CMSGov Why not? She has no problem enforcing other rules that make no sense. @CMSGov dabbles too much in areas they know hardly anything about. Especially dialysis. They need to stop being control freaks, and let the nephrologists and nurses do their job right.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@paulwaldman1 They dictate how dialysis clinics treat patients. I'm dialyzed under the same regulations as the person next to me but I'm the one suffering the consequences. So are many others. If she is too stupid to understand this she doesn't need to be in charge.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@gracemarietweet @SeemaCMS Accessing information has never been an issue for me. But @CMSGov not allowing me to make my own decisions has. My doctor and I know what's best for me. Nephrologists should be the only ones writing dialysis prescriptions.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@Kidney_X @HHSIDEALab @ASNKidney Keep your cash. My health is more important than money. @CMSGov needs to quit enforcing ignorant policies detrimental to the health of the patients.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@ShannonTapiaMD @TheEllenShow I mostly disagree. You're not over educated. You should feel blessed you can retain information others can't and have the common sense to use it wisely. You're also a very funny comedian. Keep up all the good work.
@DrJenGunter Never fall asleep with your head to the east.
@aribindi @SeemaCMS Most patients don't lack these things. Patients are put into a one size fits all vacuum. I don't need education when I have experience. @CMSGov needs to be educated on a lot of things. For example, how hemodialysis works. And you're correct. More expensive doesn't mean better.
@SeemaCMS I've been driving to change an @CMSGov policy that's had negative affects on my health for over a year. You don't listen to anyone and you don't care. The nurses pretend to care but ultimately don't because $ is more important than the patient's health.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@HHSRegion8 @FDATobacco Yes it's funny how many people are fooled to believe "all natural" is safe. Poison Ivy comes to mind. And how many deaths are ruled natural causes? #naturekills

@ESRDNCC Please bring this to the attention of @SeemaCMS @CMSGov @HHSGov and @SecAzar. They have no right forcing a rule that causes more harm than it helps. They're overstepping their boundaries. 13mL/kg/hr is a terrible formula. Every patient is different.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@SeemaCMS @CMSGov You need to address this and convince me why the 13mL/kg/hr regulation is such a great idea. It does more harm than helps and should be criminal to enforce. I'm tired of you and @CMSGov playing games with my health. You're a joke and so are your policies.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@MedicaidGov @CMSGov You need to address the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. To force this rule that causes more harm and only helps your ego because you just want to show who's in charge is criminal. You know nothing about hemodialysis. @CMSGov needs to stay away and let the doctors treat their patients.

@SeemaCMS The 13mL/kg/hr rule is stupid because you allow someone 3 times bigger than me to remove 3 times more. They may be bigger than me but their heart isn't. If they brought in that much they'd have complications.
@SeemaCMS Stay in your office and out of the clinics.
@SeemaCMS You need to do something about this 13mL/kg/hr regulation. To force clinics to leave extra fluid on patients is criminal. You don't understand the harm you're causing. You know nothing about hemodialysis. You need to let my nephrologist write my dialysis prescription.

@DialysisSaves https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@DialysisSaves Not really. Every patient is different and needs to be treated specifically to his/her needs. @CMSGov needs to quit playing doctor and leave that to the nephrologists. I had zero (0) issues as a dialysis patient for over 20 years until they forced this stupid 13mL/kg/hr rule.
@jackhusband12 Nocturnal is not for everyone. In the few weeks I was doing nocturnal (6 hours) my post dialysis recovery time was worse than when I just did my normal 3 hours. A higher clearance rate (kt/v) won't make you feel any better. I know this from experience.
@CharlieFarquar @kidneyrebel @DaVita @CMSGov Yes it's a major problem for smaller patients. I, too, have always taken off 3ish with no problems whatsoever. But very rarely more than 2.5. If they told me my limit was 2.5 I wouldn't be this livid about the situation.
@HHSGov How can I stay positive when you and @CMSGov are doing whatever it takes to hurt me? You know nothing about hemodialysis. There's nothing beneficial to the 13mL/kg/hr rule. You're abusing your authority. You have no busines writing dialysis prescriptions.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@Seanthum I don't know about financial burden but more patients means more money. When I started in 1995 I had to go 50 miles to a town that had 1 clinic. Now my hometown has 1 clinic and that town has 5. It's a testimony you can live a long time on dialysis.
@DaVitaMedical https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@DaVitaMedical What's the point if the nurses at the clinic won't take all the fluid off necessary for us to live a normal life? Too much fluid is dangerous and most of us have to skip meals and stay thirsty half the time to stay under the limit forced by @CMSGov 13mL/kg/hr.

@SeemaCMS Yes I deserve better. You shouldn't force a rule that's detrimental to my health. Get rid that stupid 13mL/kg/hr regulation or allow me to sign an AMA form when I need to remove the necessary amount of fluid needed to live somewhat of a normal life for someone on dialysis.

@SeemaCMS @CMSGov I also spent 3 days in ICU in 2004 in a coma from having too much fluid in my lungs after missed only two consecutive treatments. Yes, my fault. But it was from extra fluid. That's why I don't understand why you support such a policy. It defeats the purpose of hemodialysis.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov I have a lot of health records contradicting your study of rapid ultrafiltration rates. I know there should be a limit but you have it set too low. I'm sick and tired of missing meals and staying thirsty so I'm under my limit. I've dialyzed over 23 years and never had any issues.
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov Your one size fits all mentality has no business in the medical field. Don't tell me what has worked over 20 years doesn't anymore. You're hurting a lot of hemodialysis patients like myself with the ridiculous 13mL/kg/hr policy. You know nothing about dialysis.

@HHSGov Yes, we deserve better. Get rid of this ridiculous 13mL/kg/hr rule.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh
@ESRDNetworkofTX A good start would be to eliminate the 13mL/kg/hr regulation. Use it only as a guideline and let doctors make decisions based on their patient's needs.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@StotterMD @PHLane @NephRodby Before I was properly diagnosed at 15 the hospital told my grandparents I was faking it. Mind you it was the middle of July.
@AdvDialysis In my personal experience anything under 1.4 I don't feel my best. Anything over that I don't feel any difference.
@ShannonTapiaMD Yeah I never thought family history made a difference either.
@DietHeartNews Also dangerous to patients is excess fluid and it should be against the law for @CMSGov to force dialysis clinics to do that.		https://t.co/FFCfHvmiJP
@markfahlen No such thing as too much dialysis but there is unnecessary dialysis. And a patient has the right to have all the extra amount of fluid removed, too.		https://t.co/FFCfHvmiJP
@MadeleineAlexei It can be a discomfort but I've come to the fact since most patient's accesses are in their left arm that will be the case for some people. I've learned to cope with it myself. Nothing the clinic is doing to intentionally discomfort us.
@DLawton13 This is one of my biggest fears as a dialysis patient. Were they okay?
@CMSGov Until you do something about this nothing will change for me for the good.		https://t.co/FFCfHvmiJP
@SeemaCMS @CMSGov You need to eliminate 13mL/kg/hr and allow my doctor and I to do what's best for me. The dialysis center pulling off the necessary amount of extra fluid has no burden on you whatsoever.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@CMSGov I almost died in 2004 because of fluid overload and you're doing everything you can to cause that again by limiting the amount of fluid my clinic takes off of me. My doctor and I know what's best for me. Handle the financial part and leave the actual care to the nephrologists.
@CMSGov You'll never know what it feels like to have to skip meals and go long periods without liquids to stay under the maximum amount allowed to be removed. When as a patient I know firsthand the maximum amount I can safely remove is more than you allow.
@CMSGov I don't need people who sit at desks telling me and my doctor what's best for me. For over 20 years I did hemodialysis with no issues. I have more difficulties now thanks to the 13mL/kg/hr rule than ever before.
@CMSGov The 13mL/kg/hr rule is ridiculous. It defeats the purpose of hemodialysis. The real danger only exists when going way below the patient's dry weight. Leaving excess fluid around the heart and lungs is dangerous.
@CMSGov Dialysis clinics should not have to be forced to use 13mL/kg/hr when removing fluid from their patients. It should be used strictly as a guideline. Every patient is different. If a doctor and patient feel it's safe to pull more they should be able to.		https://t.co/FFCfHv4HSh

@realDonaldTrump 		https://t.co/sqKP0d9aQl		This, Sir, is a huge issue that has affected myself and many other kidney dialysis patients. The one size fits all mentality has no place in the medical field. I think it's time the doctors decide what's best for their patients.
@AdvDialysis I'm not saying there shouldn't be a limit. For small patients like myself the limit is too low. Not removing the fluid has caused more problems than removing it.
@SeemaCMS https://t.co/sqKP0d9aQl		As admin I know you have more power than anyone to reverse this rule. I don't think you understand the problems you and CMS have caused many patients like myself by allowing this. Don't tell me what has worked over 20 years doesn't anymore.
