@TheMaryMaxine @AECFNews Have you tried @FosterCoalition or @FCAANational?
@rmtlle Of course, everyone should be advocating for the child. My point is that the CASA ONLY advocates for the child and provides a voice that may otherwise be missed by the other professionals. The system is flawed, no doubt, so having an independent voice is good for all involved.

@chanbrig @Acosta @NationalCASA @casakidsok @TexasCASA 4/4 CASA has Child Immigration Separation experts available. Please reach out to CASA programs in the affected regions to inquiry or contact @NationalCASA for guidance.
@chanbrig @Acosta @NationalCASA @casakidsok @TexasCASA 3/4 the most well-informed decision in these tremendously important matters.		We ask our nation’s legislators to carefully consider the impacts on children when they address immigration legislation so that no child is subjected to further trauma.
@chanbrig @Acosta @NationalCASA @casakidsok @TexasCASA 2/4 out on behalf of these children. We join with these voices.		If children involved in immigration proceedings become involved in family or juvenile court, we urge the appointment of a CASA/GAL volunteer to advocate for the child’s best interest and help the court make
@chanbrig @Acosta @NationalCASA @casakidsok @TexasCASA 1/4 While CASA programs and volunteers work in family or juvenile court systems, not the federal court system, we support best-interest advocacy for all children. We have been deeply concerned about the family separations at the Southwest border and thank those who have spoken
