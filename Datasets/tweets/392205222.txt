INBOX: House Homeland Security Committee Dems announce subcommittee chairs. Two freshman lawmakers -- @RepMaxRose (D-N.Y.) and @XochforCongress (D-N.M.) -- take gavels: https://t.co/zTa5YoauoA
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney New Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), fmr DOD/natsec official, asks about any other factors that went into decision to use active duty over natl guard besides speed? VADM: Other factors were capacity, right skill sets, readiness impacts were considered, and timing was key.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney New Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a fmr Army Special Forces officer, asks if there is any long-term effort to try and cease DoD support to DHS for such missions. Asks, "have we become comfortable" with the request process? Rood doesn't really have an answer, but interesting q.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney .@RepAdamSmith just said efforts will be made to wrap this hearing up by 12:30, so as not to abuse the time of the Pentagon officials and lead them to not return. I don't doubt after this hearing they will be asked back again...
My mistake here, Rep. Garamendi is of course the new CHAIR for the HASC readiness subcommittee. Old habits die hard as the 116th House flipped to the Dems. https://t.co/6ziTE0b7my
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.) laments the limited funds to U.S. Southern Command to help with counter-narcotics missions, "It‚Äôs baffling to me that we give SOUTHCOM the leftovers when these active terrorists in our backyards are coming in the western hemisphere."
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rood answers by noting the DoD has long provided assistance in support of civil authorities, such as at the Super Bowl, fires, floods, etc. Even as it pursues its major "priorities" such as great power competition. Keating rebukes by saying there is a "difference in scope" here.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rep. Bill Keating (D-Mass.) asks Rood: Does the word "caravan" appear in the National Defense Strategy? ("Not that I can remember.") Notes that priorities need to be made, and clearly border deployment and NDS priorities "aren;t in sync."

@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Seapower RM Rep. Rob Wittman asks: Are the active duty troops a help for CBP agents on counter-narcotics mission and help stymie narcotics flow across the border? A: yes.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rep. Salud Carbajal asks Rood if DoD has assessed which military construction projects would be affected should Trump choose to fund the wall with milcon dollars. Rood says since only preliminary planning has been done so far, those projects haven't been identified.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney New Tactical Air and Land Force Chair Rep. Donald Norcross presses Rood for cost estimates should Trump call national emergency to fund the border wall. Rood says that estimate has not been made since it depends on what exactly is included in that emergency request (wall? wire?)
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rep. Garamendi, new RM for readiness, is first to bring up on the record that the troop deployment came just days before the 2018 midterm elections. Requests unit-by-unit details on skill sets for deployed forces, yields time to new Rep. Kendra Horn (D-Okla.)
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney This is related to Gilday previously noting that the border deployment is not only "consuming readiness" for active duty troops, but "producing readiness" by troops training and working on the ground.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry @RepJoeCourtney Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.) asks VADM Gilday (director of operations J3) whether it's fair to say that troops deploying for the 1st time ever to border will be more prepared for subsequent deployments. Gilday says yes in general, but hard to say for individuals.
@6B1222T @HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry Hard to convey all info in a tweet! What I believe was meant was caravan was moving toward CA points of entry, rather than POEs in other states. DOD saying that they needed so many troops because were unsure which direction caravan would go. Again, lot of deets lost in tweets,
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry New Seapower Chair @RepJoeCourtney yields most of his time to freshman Rep. Elaine Luria (D-Va.), a 20-year Navy veteran who asks about prioritizing drug trafficking, human trafficking and people crossing the border. VADM Gilday notes that hard to rank, they are all priorities.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry Rood responds that there is more intelligence assistance, more medical, a couple of things I missed... but essentially the goal was and is to free up CBP to perform more law enforcement duties.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry Freshman Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.) asks DoD witnesses for more details on troop readiness impact (Answer: troops rotating on 6-8 week basis) and for differences between Natl Guard deployments historically and the current mission.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry Smith asks Rood what is the metric that leads you to assess that the active duty troops have improved the situation at the border. Rood says the 70 miles of concertina wire laid by troops allowed CBP to better cover potential points of entry and more efficiently spread manpower.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith @HASCRepublicans @MacThornberry Smith asks John Rood, DOD Undersecretary for Policy, why close to 6K troops were required for initial border deployment. Rood: there was concern with respect to timing about countering all potential migrants at various points of entry. They actually all went to CA ports of entry.
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith Now @HASCRepublicans Ranking Member @MacThornberry begins his remarks by stating the qs posed by Smith are "perfectly legitimate," but he worries that the underlying political issues of this debate will cause the usually bipartisan committee to begin on a more "contentious note"
@HASCDemocrats @RepAdamSmith Smith notes there is concern that if Trump declares a national emergency to fund the wall, where that money will come from and how it will affect military readiness.
New @HASCDemocrats Chairman @RepAdamSmith launches into his opening remarks, noting that bringing armed services to perform border security is unusual and there is "not that much evidence" for a crisis on the border as described by President Trump.
@HASCDemocrats At the same time @SASCMajority is holding its first hearing of 2019 on Russia and China. Will be double checking on that throughout the day. My colleague @MBeinart22 is at the Pentagon covering Acting SecDef Shanahan's 1st press briefing in his new role.

Some priorities the HASC seapower sub will have in 2019, per @RepJoeCourtney: SLEP efforts, addressing issues in the sealift fleet, Columbia-class moving forward in a major way.
Here‚Äôs an interesting factoid: In talking about infusion of millennials into the workforce and what effect that will have, Courtney says data shows millennials made up 20% of US workforce in 2013; in 2018 we‚Äôre 51% ‚Äî ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a hopeful and good thing.‚Äù 		Basically we taking over.
US military and its security priorities will require a workforce transformation, Courtney said. Job training, STEM education are natsec issues and the Fed govt has a role to play.

@ToddHarrisonDC @CSIS The likelihood of a Space Force making it through Congress is basically a coin toss, @ToddHarrisonDC says. Depends a lot on what the DoD's actual legislative proposal looks when it comes out in February. Earlier Todd said he's guessing it'll be between Space Force Lite and Heavy
@ToddHarrisonDC @CSIS .@ToddHarrisonDC notes that the extra funding to stand up a new space branch, whether a Space Corps, Space Force "lite" or Space Force "heavy" comes out to the cost of "a handful of F-35s" or "the annual cost of the DOD audit."
.@ToddHarrisonDC of @CSIS today released his take on the cost to stand up a Space Force: believes it will take between $1.5B to $2.7B in NEW funding over 5 years. Todd's briefing reporters now on his findings.
Today at Pentagon press briefing:  DOD spokesman Army. Col. Rob Manning just said there‚Äôs been no additional changes in U.S. mil-to-mil support to Saudi-led coalition since the announcement to end air refueling support. Emphasizes that Saudis asked to do its own refueling.

Dr. Crawford alleges from her findings that these wars are creating more militants abroad in War on Terror locations, but also homegrown militants and terrorists here in the US compared to other military operations.
A major theme running thru this report is that the decrease of access to information (as was highlighted by @RepAdamSmith in @DefenseOne and as Hill/Pentagon reporters are experiencing) is making it harder for lawmakers, and the public to make educated choices about mil missions

@Pat_Host Really the more I think about this, I feel like Gibson has been able to coast on the fact that it has been around for so long+thus was played by many who we consider "guitar gods" and capitalize on the marketing, but now ppl are recognizing the quality's down and aren't having it
@Pat_Host And then for metal, Ibanez, Jackson and Schechter are generally the most popular and also make v good guitars. Gretsch also a good company.
@Pat_Host Fender has always been solid. There are a lot of great other companies though! My dream as a teen was a Paul Reed Smith (played by ppl like Dave Navarro, Alex Lifeson from Rush, Santana) and they're v good if more "boutique"
@Pat_Host Dave and I have been playing Danelectros for the past 4ish years and I love them a lot. Reasonably priced, great look, has always seemed to be a solid company. There's def quality discrepancies across the product line but I love mine/get lots of compliments from other bands
@Pat_Host Honestly I haven't played enough brands recently to give a good assessment. Gibson has definitely fallen the furthest though, both for the reasons laid out in the article and for recent product choices such as this horror: https://t.co/xPOUDhZOmw
@LeighGiangreco Let me make you a playlist!! If you just try to jump in there is a high chance you‚Äôll be turned off forever by some of his less savory works and that would be tragic
