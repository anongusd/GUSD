End of rant.
There's no obvious solution to this problem, but it seems clear empty pieties about "accountability" won't cut it.
Even if journalists were inclined and able to acknowledge and correct for that bias, it's hard to see how they could do so without heightening distrust among the segment of the population that loathes Trump.
Especially because much of the distrust has a partisan or ideological valence. The BuzzFeed and Covington fiascoes, for instance, obviously reflect anti-Trump bias within the media.
When the media tend to act in unison, generalized public distrust is the closest thing there is to accountability. But general distrust does not seem a promising means of inducing the media to improve.
In the Covington case, no one was credited with the scoop, so no one in particular will be blamed for getting it wrong.
One problem with @chucktodd's claim about "accountability" is that much of the media's bad behavior consists in herdlike (or moblike) behavior. So BuzzFeed may experience a modicum of accountability for its bad scoop, but no one else will be accountable for propagating it. https://t.co/mjoMF5zYIV

My second favorite: "He can’t consistently break 40 percent approval despite a booming economy."  Hmm, a booming economy for a 39% presidential approval rating doesn't sound like such a bad trade-off to me.

And a few are substantive changes in immigration policy to which no substantive objection is offered--the reader is expected to regard them as facially repugnant.
A few are purely symbolic actions, e.g., "He barred CNN correspondent Jim Acosta from the White House," "He deployed troops to the border in a political stunt."
The rest of the piece is a laundry list of purported costs, most of which will be familiar from earlier lists. The large majority of them are merely things Trump has said.
This two-year Trump roundup from @MaxBoot (who now blocks me on Twitter) is hilarious. He concedes Trump has delivered peace and prosperity (plus tax cuts and conservative judges), then goes on to say the "costs" aren't worth it. https://t.co/ap898jnqDl https://t.co/ezhJXoL5AH

It appears the reporter here is just parroting numbers without understanding what they mean, or even questioning them.
So maybe it's a (lowball) estimate of total annual spending under a statewide single-payer regime. Still, there's no way de Blasio's promise of insuring 600,000 people for $100 million a year adds up.
The statewide figure doesn't quite add up either if the comparison is apples to apples. Divide $170 billion by the state population and you get $8,564 per person, which is within the magnitude of current Medicaid spending.
New York state's population is 130% greater than New York state's population. According to these figures, the cost of providing "comprehensive health care" statewide would be 170,000% as much as de Blasio claims he'll spend doing so in the city.
The fake news story itself contains numbers that ought to call de Blasio's into question. https://t.co/dBw6TZKQdR
That's 1.7% of the $9,845 cost per enrollee of New York state's Medicaid program in 2016, as per Ballotpedia. https://t.co/QVEn7kwNvH

@ClaireBerlinski That means the study probably also overestimates the journalism-specific risks in war-torn countries vis-à-vis places like Turkey and Russia.

@ClaireBerlinski On the other hand, I wonder if the report makes any effort to disaggregate the risk of "being a journalist" in a place like Syria or Afghanistan from the risk of simply BEING in Syria or Afghaistan.
@ClaireBerlinski I agree with your broader point; I was quibbling with your language. Certainly the possibility of being crushed by a tree is a heightened risk a journalist assumes when he spends time outdoors in a hurricane zone reporting.
@ClaireBerlinski My point is simply that "anytime a journalist dies of non-natural causes, no matter the cause" is a broader characterization than RSF seems to have been using. The chicken-sandwich example is more obviously absurd than the ones RSF cited.
@ClaireBerlinski In fairness, all 6 of the U.S. journalists appear to have been killed while on the job. On the other hand, the ranking appears to be based on raw numbers, not a ratio of journalists killed to population or total number of journalists.

I would think rebutting that view would require a substantive account of the principles that purportedly underlie the aversion to Trump.
But my understanding of the prevailing liberal position is that it views the distinction between pro-Trump and Nevertrump conservatives as being without a difference. The idea is that all conservatives are unprincipled or share objectionable principles.
To be sure, I am not an example of the reader this argument attempts to reach. The piece is a plea for sympathy and respect from liberals. https://t.co/3vLEznOEgT
But there's no substance to the claim, which is to say the piece does not even attempt to enumerate or describe those principles, ideas or goals. In fact, this passage credits them for their willingness to SACRIFICE ideological goals to their aversion to Trump. https://t.co/y2TMywwf2R

Do you know who was op-ed editor of the Journal in 1999? @MaxBoot! (Disclosure: I was deputy op-ed editor.)
I found the WSJ op-ed, published Sept. 30, 1999. https://t.co/ALCNDgygGU https://t.co/Day7WUZrKO
But here's what's really funny. In the same chapter, I found this passage: https://t.co/hNVC33SZ3U
True, the key sentence said "nations," which if taken literally narrows the category of "smaller enemies" to exclude al Qaeda. But that seems a somewhat pedantic point, and in any case the "fact checks," in eliding it entirely, seem to me no less misleading than Trump's tweet.
But the AP "fact check," as well as all the others I've seen, leaves out the preceding paragraph, which gives rather a different impression: https://t.co/SiUcWsaTZa
So I bought the Kindle version to see for myself. The AP headline claims "Trump book didn't foreshadow bin Laden attack." It quotes the passage in which he complains that the government is sending mixed messages about the danger: https://t.co/Qe7CBWq1Ok
Well, this is amusing. I saw that Trump was being "fact checked" for his tweet about Osama bin Laden. See, e.g., https://t.co/f0Ihdj8OFK
#tweetsfrom1692 https://t.co/410bQOzcJE
@KnoxMcM @JonahNRO @MaxBoot I'm not sure I understand your question, but I think the answer is probably no.
@JonahNRO @MaxBoot I think this overcomplicates the matter a bit. Max now acknowledges that when he was conservative, he was insincere and intellectually lazy. He asks us to conclude that this reflects on conservatives' character rather than his own.

@DeplorableGil read the next tweet in the thread
End of rant.
And contributing to a "poisonous atmosphere"--which Trump has undoubtetly done, but so have a great many other politicians, political actors and commentators--comes nowhere near meeting the definition of incitement. https://t.co/JfT0VkFOWv
Maxine Waters's urging supporters to harass cabinet members also would not qualify as incitement, even if someone did act on it, since imminence is missing from both elements.
A prosecutor might find it difficult to prove both elements, however, unless someone actually followed his urging. If no one did, he could say he meant it jokingly and his audience understood it that way.
Arguably Candidate Trump engaged in incitement when he seemed to encourage supporters to rough up hecklers at rallies.
Incitement, however, has a specific legal definition, under Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). It must be "directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action" AND "likely to incite or produce such action."
Now, here's a piece that accuses Trump of "shouting 'fire.'" The author twice characterizes Trump's speech as incitement. https://t.co/9P8EvuOy7d https://t.co/k8U5sJJsuP
Dersh also lists some "more distant" analogies: incitement, fighting words and disruptive heckling. https://t.co/wrGj23hSXJ
To his list of close analogies, one might add sending a fake bomb or harmless white powder through the mail. The purpose is to provoke panic, even if there's no actual physical danger. https://t.co/bfFsI8LERm
The analogy, Dersh rightly notes, was inapt when Justice Holmes came up with it in Schenck v. U.S. (1919), and it is inapt almost every time it has been cited since.
"Shouting 'Fire!' in a crowded theater" is one of the laziest tropes in First Amendment law and commentary, as @AlanDersh argued in this classic 1989 Atlantic essay. https://t.co/5TZI7szuQC

End of rant.
I think if somebody is going to declare the American system of government illegitimate, he has an obligation to be careful about math, don't you agree?
But Trump carried 7 of the 10 most populous states, all by less than 10 points. If you ignore Mrs. Clinton's votes in those states, it "costs" her a lot more than ignoring Trump's votes in California, New York and Illinois.
This may seem counterintuitive, given the huge vote totals Mrs. Clinton racked up in California and New York.
By that measure, Trump "won the popular vote" by approximately 40.8 million to 33.4 million.
Now, suppose we apply this method of calculation to the 2016 presidential vote--i.e., we count only votes Trump and Mrs. Clinton received in states they carried.
The paper adds up the total number of votes each senator on each side received in his last election. It ignores completely votes cast AGAINST the Senate incumbents.
But what does it mean that senators who voted to confirm Gorsuch--in Tomasky's words--"received a minority share of the vote"?
To wit: What does it mean when people say Mrs. Clinton "won the popular vote"? It means you add up all the votes she received in all 50 states and D.C., do the same for Trump, and her total is bigger.
This paper @mtomasky cites either is dishonest or makes a stupid error. https://t.co/u2TQDg2abu https://t.co/gvFfgWvEBS

What what took? You already lost. https://t.co/ZZvyD3hYPS
Of course this would change if one of the Democratic justices left the bench (or announced her intention to retire) before Nov. 6. Someone who knows game theory ought to take up that possibility.
Prospect theory predicts that if Dems had succeeded in blocking Kavanaugh, loss aversion would have brought out their voters in November. Now that the loss has occurred, that motive is much weaker.
The Supreme Court was a big voting issue for Republicans because of loss aversion. For Democrats, not so much. By some accounts the Senate's blocking of Merrick Garland wasn't even mentioned at the DNC.
Republicans didn't face this situation until 2016, with Scalia's death. In the Senate, they dealt with it cold-bloodedly rather than viciously, but still in a way that marked a tactical escalation.
Now, think about Supreme Court politics in these terms. Democrats have been most vicious in treatment of nominees they thought would change the "balance" of the court unfavorably to them: Bork, Thomas, Kavanaugh and (albeit to little effect because of GOP majority's size) Alito.

@Tom_Maguire @KimStrassel And you think that's why Kavanaugh ended up becoming a judge?
@Tom_Maguire @KimStrassel Keyser is 49 according to a report I saw--so younger than Ford by at least a year.
@Tom_Maguire @KimStrassel I'll bet you don't remember being at the party either, which could mean you're the 4th guy.
@Tom_Maguire @KimStrassel True enough (usually). Also the email said "her friend" Leland and the boys' friend PJ, and I suppose one would naturally assume same-sex friends.
@Tom_Maguire @KimStrassel The Post reporter might have thought Leland was a boy's name.

@DavidAFrench A president who demonizes American citizens AND has the bureaucracy behind her is a different order of threat.
@DavidAFrench To my mind, the Obama administration's weaponization of the IRS and Mrs. Clinton's demonization of a quarter of the population as "irredeemable" and "not America" were dire portents.
@iQuestionStuff @DavidAFrench Actually both eyes, 7 months apart. But one was sufficient to make my point.
@DavidAFrench I don't care for the plane-crash metaphor. On the other hand, a liberal Supreme Court majority (which could easily have been 6-3 by the end of a first Clinton term) would have meant the end of Second Amendment rights and sharp curtailment of First Amendment ones. Pretty dire.
End of rant.
The problem was speedily reversed, AND the consequences of failing to do so would have been both quick and dire.
Analogy: A few years ago, I had a detached retina. I went in for surgery, and two weeks later I was recovered, my vision better than ever. Had I not had surgery quickly, I would have been permanently blind.
The claim that "all of America was at stake" was prospective. "All could soon be lost" doesn't mean "almost all is already lost."
I take @DavidAFrench's point that either or both of these claims could be seen as hyperbolic. I don't think, however, that there is any contradiction between them. https://t.co/cKgBvcuJ5D

Perhaps the reporters have the better of the argument, though I tend to think it's not the place of a news reporter to be making such arguments.
When today's story says "without evidence," what it means is that the reporters disagree with the president's interpretation of the evidence.

@grootslang_ That's no excuse for bad writing and argumentation.
End of rant.
Finally, note that I have a perverse fascination with poor writing and argumentation. If I were a normal person, I doubt I would have made it through the third paragraph.
Yet it's much clearer and more compelling than the counterargument, which is abstract mush. "It erodes the sanctity of the institution of the family itself" has no concrete meaning.
Then comes this. The argument the author knocks down may be a straw man--the article doesn't actually quote anyone making it. https://t.co/gYEGhc7iQL
So I'm left thinking: It does sound bad, but I don't trust the author to have told me the whole story.
If I read on, I get an account of the facts. But the account comes from a source that (a) is openly hostile to my point of view and (b) has shown a propensity for jumping to false conclusions, namely that this stuff is common knowledge.
That is a frivolous argument. But it's worse than that--it poisons the well. It leads me to doubt the author's good faith.
So the opening claim is that I am somehow acting in bad faith because I am "silent" rather than "outraged" about something of which I am completely unaware.
My guess is most conservatives haven't heard about the immigration actions the piece criticizes. I hadn't.
This piece is a clinic in not to write a persuasive article. https://t.co/3yUUVsAFVY

@KierkeStruck @RameshPonnuru According to the Times's 2008 account, Bush was referring to Bolton's harsh criticism of Bush in a WSJ op-ed.
Here's somebody who was there, reporting that the Times's characterization of Bush's comment is false. https://t.co/kubUbigERd https://t.co/v1MH0lHJ97

In addition, the claim that Bush regretted backing Bolton because he was "such a divisive figure" seems totally unsupported by fact.

@JerylBier @Bioreducer This is why I didn't single out @PhilipRucker in my rant. The correction suggests his editors took liberties with the piece. (And reporters usually don't write their own headlines.)

@Bioreducer See this thread. https://t.co/tTuWpINzYQ
This is sloppy and dishonest journalism on the Post's part. End of rant.
But if Trump has ever said, as the story claims, that "Russian interference was a hoax," the Post was unable to find any evidence. Indeed it quotes several instances in which he acknowledged interference.
The redacted Post story quotes another such tweet, referring to "Russia talk." https://t.co/8OuHoCWpSm
You can also find tweets with vague references like "the Russia hoax." https://t.co/S8TEK8K2EU
If you look at Trump's tweets, you find lots of tweets in which he says "collusion" is a hoax, as in the one the Post quoted then deleted.
The lede makes the same assertion, albeit without quote marks. https://t.co/54ORxlKHuB
There is now no reference in the story to Trump's calling anything a "hoax," but the headline still uses that word in quotes. https://t.co/WYYeyyEgTs
The Post realized this was a problem. It deleted the quote from the story and appended this cryptic note. https://t.co/gGFF84m7LQ https://t.co/HveCAtcjfa
The quote "the Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax" was in the Post story when I initially tweeted about it. That was what Trump called a "hoax," not broader claims of Russian meddling.
This is strange: I typed in a thread following up on the above tweet but somehow failed to post it. Let's start again.
That is true only of the version of the Post article that was edited subsequent to my initial tweet. In other words, the Post saw the problem you are denying and attempted to remedy it. https://t.co/atmBH3ogAA
If Trump called "Russian interference" a "hoax," why can't the Post produce a quote to that effect? And it appears you can't either. https://t.co/7bnF8NT1oJ

@jamesakahn I'll let @baseballcrank field any questions. I just thought it was interesting; I'm not prepared to elaborate on it.

Not sure 2018 will settle the question, since any result can be attributed to either Trump or conventional GOPs. https://t.co/Svb9i9AIyo
"Hoi" means "the," so you should just say "the polloi." https://t.co/lO7CUKjv4y
@JohnSchreiber8 Trump and Clinton both have a much looser personal style than Obama. On the other hand, Trump tends to be blustery where Clinton was lawyerly.

I think "maligns" is a fair description. His fallacy is one of equivocation. Trump maligns the press (or many of those in it); by adding the adjective "free," Cuomo attempts falsely to make it look like an attack of press freedom. https://t.co/t6AtgDs1fA

OK but let's some up the argument here.		Me: Trump has done something that may prove both savvy and salutary.	You: He lacks integrity.		Whether or not your claim is right, I don't see how it is relevant in response to mine. https://t.co/mGgKRxzvg8
@KimmyQueen09 not intentionally
@KimmyQueen09 yes it's a joke!
Thus concludes another rant.
I'm not sure what it means as a practical matter to "credit" him or not. But I would suggest that perhaps you are placing too high a value on consistency and unselfishness.
You don't dispute this; you argue that it is a mistake to "credit" him because he is inconsistent and self-interested.
In my thread last night, I speculated that Trump's approach to this issue may prove both politically shrewd and socially salutary.
If the bubble bursts between now and November, encouraging his adversaries to make that investment was canny of Trump.
That means Democrats made an enormous moral, political and emotional investment in #metoo, even though some of them had serious qualms about it at the time.
Franken was not an at-will employee and would have been entitled to stick around another 3 years unless 67 senators voted to expel him. So the pressure had to be really intense.
But to the extent that he played a role, it was to encourage an environment in which Democrats felt pressured to make Franken feel pressure to resign.
Let's talk about Franken. I don't think Trump was a central figure in that drama, except in the trivial sense that he is the central figure in the drama of our age.
Fearlessness isn't necessarily a virtue, But then neither is striving for consistency. And the latter is a much more common trait than the former.
Now, what does this tell us about Trump's character? Relative to other politicians, he seems fearless.
Other politicians are terrified to get on the wrong side of the issue--Republicans as per that Times piece, Democrats as per this Politico one. https://t.co/LCEXmfwYbG
My point is simply that he is now expressing a view that is widely shared but suppressed by the dominant culture (and also, I believe, that has merit).
One can certainly fault him for inconsistency, although I don't think he strives for consistency. https://t.co/L9Y0lNYQVR
The answer to the 1st question is because nobody wants to talk about why his clearance is delayed. https://t.co/FIc4ehmXMM

At some point the #metoo frenzy will pass. If you're the DCCC, how safe a bet is it that it won't be before this November?
And look, here's Trump, supposed destroyer of norms, standing up for a norm while his adversaries demand it be torn down!
True, "due process" doesn't apply to a decision to fire an at-will employee. But that's a pedantic point. We expect employers to treat employees fairly--that's a cultural norm.
Trump, by emphasizing "due process," did so rather deftly.
These misgivings can be difficult to express publicly, because one doesn't want to be seen as defending piggish, and in some cases criminal, behavior.
But in private conversations, one hears misgivings, from both men and women, about the frenzy. Or at least I do.
Most of the men accused in the #metoo frenzy seem guilty and creepy, and thus are difficult to defend.
I wonder if this is another case in which Trump has better instincts than conventional Republicans do. https://t.co/qcBA3qkJCq
