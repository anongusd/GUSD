Many of the Freedom Caucus member “yea” votes happened in the final seconds. Meadows, Jordan, Perry, etc.
Final vote 235-193.		Fourteen Dems voted yes (I guessed nine would)
Meadows and Jordan are a YES
Freedom Caucus sitting in their seats, watching the votes... still not moving
Handful of HFC members not voting yet: Meadows, Labrador, Perry, Lamborn
CR vote happening now. Time to fund the government! (Probably).
@connorobrienNH I don’t disagree with him.

To be clear, if they can’t, Dems will almost certainly join in to help. 		This isn’t your average overhyped shutdown tweet, I swear.
My day began with a Freedom Caucus meeting and ended with a Freedom Caucus meeting		And we’re hardly any closer to knowing whether House GOP can definitively pass this CR tomorrow on their own.

Speaking of potential fiscal crises.. 		Mark Meadows say: “I can’t imagine any scenario” where Congress doesn’t waive PAYGO
Ryan leaves separately about five minutes later.
Meadows says “we’re still talking” as he leaves with McCarthy and Jordan
Meadows says he is probably meeting with Ryan in the next hour on spending. Will “certainly” have a decision by Rules meeting.
So, Freedom Caucus didn’t make a decision today. Not ruling out supporting clean CR tho. Meeting with leadership later today.

2. Dramatic final moments as Sanford tried to force BAT vote into budget. Black killed the amendment (which was never technically offered)
PHEW ok lots happening.		1. House budget was approved by EVERY Republican tonight. something that sounds easy but certainly is not.
Dems are rly pushing this. Khanna, Jackson Lee asked to make exception for full committee to vote on it.		(which would look BAD for Black)
Here comes the Sanford amendment. 		Last-ditch attempt to kill BAT.		Black is not happy right now.
@SopanDeb this is more your style	https://t.co/sTE29vpgQN
We are told- "the appropriators are on their way over." Two more rounds of votes at this hearing. Last 7 amendments and THEN final passage.

I realize that budget committee always has high turnover but .. I think every Republican sitting here now is a new member.
"Call your bosses, call your bosses, call your bosses" 		budget GOP staffers getting nervous about having the votes for these amendments.
Now, GOP's staff director is going around telling other members' staffers to bring in their folks within 10 mins to vote.
Black just counted GOP votes in the room, came up short. Now, R + Dem leaders/staff directors are chatting.		Could halt Labor-H for votes.
