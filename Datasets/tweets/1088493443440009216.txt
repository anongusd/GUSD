@seanhannity I pray that Americans discover the attached facts which show one truth about Pelosi &amp; Schumer - that truth is those 2 people are the biggest hypocrites alive. https://t.co/aEezurcn82
@SenateGOP @SenJoniErnst @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Please - share the attached with Americans, because everyone needs to think about this situation in our own nation. https://t.co/LJlvI6IoE5
@TPPatriots @NRO I truly wish more Americans would give thought to our nation's  own citizens who need help.  We cannot even take care of our own people, so how and why do people expect us to take care of the immigrants and the world?  True lack of common sense. https://t.co/fph5zBPb1y

@ScottAdamsSays BLUE!!!!!
@RealSaavedra I pray there are many, many Jewish people in her area - that would ensure she is not re-elected and that we no longer have to hear her stupidity.  Americans sure deserve better than her.
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka President Trump - Pelosi &amp; Schumer have long believed that our nation needs stronger border protection - but they will do anything to avoid Americans learn that fact.  Reason:  They are trying too hard to look like big shots.  They don't care about Americans, just their agenda. https://t.co/IFd7UeCbqt
@RealSaavedra The truth is that (as attached) even Pelosi &amp; Schumer realize our nation needs border protection.  Thus,  when they attack Trump over the border, they are proving that they are nothing but massive hypocrites. https://t.co/TEj81252TL
@RealSaavedra Some things in life are so amazing that they are beyond belief.  Elizabeth Warren's claim to being part Native Americans, and pretense of knowing how our nation was designed, continue to stun me.  Why people vote for her is beyond my belief.
@senatemajldr @meckgop Please - make Americans aware of the attached facts which clearly show that in reality, Pelosi &amp; Schumer are well aware of America's need for border protection. https://t.co/UJ3O40p5VD
@DailyCaller My hope is that at least 50% of her constituents are Catholics.  She would then quickly become nothing but a memory in D.C.
@mschlapp AMEN!  When one knows the truth, they will realize that in reality Pelosi and Schumer want border protection.  But today they will do anything to avoid Americans becoming aware of the attached facts: https://t.co/AMLHJqGBXU
@mschlapp It is stunning that Pelosi is playing her tricks to make Trump look bad about border protection when she even called for it herself (oh, but she does not want Americans to know that). https://t.co/sXWDGs31kb
@RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano As always, I love your Tweets.  You are quite skilled at communicating a strong message is so few words.  Your IQ must be something like 190.  Thus, please share the attached information with Americans, because they will listen to you. https://t.co/0gWPwzAL0w
@Joy_Villa @ACC_National AMEN!
@BreitbartNews Americans (even Cher) need to be aware of the attached facts about Pelosi &amp; Schumer.  If people knew how hypocritical those 2 people are, they would surely demand that President Trump be provided the border protection funds he wants - because we need border protection: https://t.co/TRw69Agc6Q
@LindseyGrahamSC AMEN!
@dbongino I believe that Leftists need to consider the attached facts and then realize they need to do some house cleaning in D.C. https://t.co/B2kYkVeD1F
@SenKevinCramer @SandraSmithFox @BillHemmer @AmericaNewsroom I pray Sandra and Bill become aware of the attached facts which show that Pelosi &amp; Schumer are the 2 biggest hypocrites alive.  And then - I wish they would make Americans aware of these facts: https://t.co/jibMaXAlwJ
@DailyCaller Dictator?  Pelosi?  Surely you jest.  I believe that in her own mind Pelosi is God's gift to humanity.  GAG!
@EricTrump If Americans were made aware of the attached facts, they would immediately see the hypocrisy which exists in the minds of Pelosi &amp; Schumer, and then push them to give Trump the funds to protect America and Americans. https://t.co/H4sJ6SW4c3
@TylerDuvelius Very wise words from a very young person.  Your parents raised you well.
@RepLeeZeldin @AdamKimelman @SpeakerPelosi If Americans were aware of the attached facts about Pelosi and Schumer, they would surely demand that Trump be given the funds to protect Americans.  But, I ask for too much - because all those 2 care about is looking like big shots. https://t.co/XkHOvAPijK
@realJohnMcCann @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Do you think there is even the tiniest potential that Pelosi would let Americans become aware of the attached facts: https://t.co/SdthFgw4sV
@SenateGOP @SenSchumer Americans need to be aware of the attached facts of life about Pelosi &amp; Schumer.  If people knew how hypocritical those 2 people are, they would surely demand that President Trump be provided the border protection funds he wants, and we need. https://t.co/YhC4gwoWOe
@NHFCR @jacob_shairs @daninnis @SNHUCR @UNHCRs @SaintAnselmCR @KSCRepublicans @PSURepublicans @NHGOP @steinhauserNH1 @jdistaso @NHYR Hopefully young Americans (Dems and GOP's) become aware of the attached facts about the degree of hypocrisy that Pelosi &amp; Schumer have in their blood: https://t.co/HHdw0dHyft
@RaheemKassam Stupidity does not even begin to explain that woman's actions.  Perhaps she is simply insane and no one is willing to help her find a good mental ward.
@SenateGOP Americans need to be aware of the attached facts of life about Pelosi and Schumer.  If people knew how hypocritical those 2 people are, they would surely demand that President Trump be provided the border protection funds he wants - because we need border protection: https://t.co/qBOCGMM52V
@theintercept If Americans were aware of the attached "facts" that show the other faces of Pelosi and Schumer, they would demand  Trump be given the border protection funds he wants.  Those 2 people are clearly the biggest hypocrites alive today. https://t.co/38bDosJFXU
@RogerMarshallMD @realDonaldTrump Add the attached to your list.  Pelosi and Schumer have long been aware of our border's risks, but now they "magically" have forgotten things they publicly said: https://t.co/RAQyOKkmv8
@IWF @SpeakerPelosi God, I wish Americans were aware of Pelosi's and Schumer's hypocrisy.  Those 2 people clearly have multiple faces: https://t.co/BfbD8rn62v
@dbongino @tristankrolltid Some time ago the Supreme Court ruled that Americans do not have a "right" to Social Security benefits.  So, after paying into Social Security for decades, if politicians let the program die, taxpayers would have paid tons of money of which they would not get one cent.
@TheDC_Opinion @DailyCaller @HadleyHeath @IWF First, I agree 100%.  Second, God I wish Americans were aware of the attached facts which show just how hypocritical Pelosi and Schumer are. https://t.co/drtK01Kklk
@TheDC_Opinion @DailyCaller @RaheemKassam My belief is that Acosta's parents never gave him even one second of guidance or discipline.  He is exactly like my students who pout if everything is not the way they want.  Why CNN is not embarrassed by him is amazing.  CNN can do much better.
@KirstenPowers DITTO!
@realDerekUtley If more Americans were aware of the attached facts which show the amazing hypocrisy of Pelosi &amp; Schumer, they would realize those 2 people are a disgrace to the DNC and to America. https://t.co/Kj5va9fJPw
@RealJamesWoods Do you believe there is even a itsy bitsy chance that Warren knows about (or even cares about) the hypocrisy which exists in the Democratic party.  As the attached facts prove, Pelosi &amp; Schumer (the party's leaders) are the world's greatest hypocrites. https://t.co/aAlmAaFFvY
@RandPaul @RandPaul Paul - you are truly a person at the top of my list of politicians whom I trust and respect.  It would be wonderful if you would help ensure that more Americans learn about the attached facts regarding Pelosi &amp; Schumer and their hypocrisy. https://t.co/EQHtNh8Pvv
@DailyCaller Although I am GOP, there are many, many Democrats who I trust and respect.  Ocasio-Cortez is definitely "NOT" on that list.  "IF" she took time to study the history of Socialism and Communism surely she would just shut up.  But, forgive me - I ask for too much logic.
@campusreform Today's students are tomorrow's leaders.  Thus, I pray they become aware of how much hypocrisy exists in D.C.  But, of everyone in D.C., Pelosi and Schumer win the Gold Cup of Hypocrites: https://t.co/v0BxyXnpo0
@BreitbartNews Do you think there is even an ounce of potential that Rob Reiner knows these facts: https://t.co/GM4tik2NKD
@playbookplus What I do not understand is exactly "how" does Pelosi and Schumer avoid Americans from knowing their own positions on immigration.  They are fighting Trump for something they want themselves.  Pure hypocrisy: https://t.co/NyTJIstBOP
@SenHydeSmith @SenateGOP It continually amazes me that Pelosi and Schumer are willing to let much of our government be shut down over border protection - when "they wanted it themselves".  But, of course we never hear these facts in the media: https://t.co/zpPCo0NZVm
@RealRachelTalks @realDonaldTrump GREAT VIDEO.  This is simply something you might want to add to the list. https://t.co/UQqZF4QDGW
Wishes for "everyone" to help make 2019 a better year for "all" Americans.  @AbbottBaker5
