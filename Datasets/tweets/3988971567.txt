"Tufts students take to the polls on Super Tuesday"	https://t.co/0Nizqiv42o
This is a slight contrast to the results amongst selected Tufts students which slightly preferred Sanders overall
At this time, NBC News has projected Clinton the winner of the Massachusetts primary
And with 84% in, Clinton's lead has shrunk to over 25000, still "Too Close To Call"
With 63% in now, Clinton's lead has expanded to over 27000. MSNBC still characterizes the race as "Too Close To Call"
Clinton's lead has grown to 9054 but this race is still "Too Close To Call"
With 4% in, MSNBC has changed their characterization to "Too Close To Call." Clinton currently leads by 67 votes
MSNBC has still labeled this race "Too Early To Call"
Looking forward to seeing how the MA Democratic primary pans out in comparison to the Tufts results I got
MSNBC projected Trump the winner in MA
Overall results among all Tufts students I talked to today:	Sanders- 12	Clinton- 11	Rubio- 1	Kasich- 1
Multiple students left precincts unaware that they were in the wrong place and had to vote at another precinct
Polls are open for another 90 minutes and I've seen the Jumbo Vote 2016 van drive by three times in the last 90 minutes
Racism, immigration reform, the economy and foreign policy have been other issues important to voters here
Several people mentioned they think Republicans are voting in the Democratic primary because they are too afraid of Trump
Democratic voters have also cited a close primary as a reason for voting today
Just heard Healthcare brought up as the most important issue in this election for the first time today
Both sophomores and a first-year voted for Sanders
The senior and two first-years voted for Clinton
A senior, two sophomores and three first-years voted here
Three female voters here voted for Clinton, one female and two male voters voted for Sanders
I just heard reproductive rights come up as the most important issue for a voter today
Of those four, two are male and two are female
Of the four voters I've spoken with so far at the Holy Bible Baptist Church, three voted for Sanders and one for Clinton
Income inequality has been a hot topic among Sanders supporters today
Sanders supporters who I've spoken with here seem confident in his ability to accomplish a lot as President
registered Massachusetts resident (2/2)
Just spoke with a Puerto Rican student who discussed the unique opportunity of voting in the primary and general elections as a (1/2)
If your precinct is the Holy Bible Baptist Church, you enter at this Chapel St. entrance https://t.co/YKh3FOEiGi
Massachusetts has an open primary so Independents who are registered under "No Primary" can vote in the Democratic or Republican primary
Tufts Administration Building voters by age: three seniors, two juniors and four Fletcher grad students
Just spoke to a Clinton voter who's from Massachusetts and said it was fun to finally vote in an election that seems contested
Can't say for certain if this person voted but I just saw a car with a Ben Carson bumper sticker leave the Tufts Administration Building lot
So I've seen a gender divide in terms of party primary so far at the Tufts Administration Building
The person who uses "they" pronouns voted for Sanders
Of the females, three voted for Clinton and two for Sanders
Of the two males, one voted for Rubio and one for Kasich
The gender composition at the Tufts Administration Building precinct has been two males, five females, and one person using "they" pronouns
As to why many Tufts students are voting today, they consider it their civic duty and believe this election in particular is high-stakes
and one for Kasich
Of the seven voters I've spoken with at the Tufts Administration Building, three voted for Clinton, two for Sanders, one for Rubio
and Democrats tend to prefer Clinton over Sanders when it comes to foreign policy
And I don't usually like to speculate but that may be because Fletcher is an International Relations graduate school
Hillary Clinton has been a popular choice among Fletcher voters today
@DMcLeanWL not that I'm aware of. I was told this at the Gantcher Center in Medford this morning
"Trump scares the shit out of me. I can't believe we have come to that," she said
While she agrees with Sanders' domestic policies, she does not believe they are as realistic
Another Fletcher student just told me that she voted for Clinton because of her Middle East policies, which is her area of study
Tufts students registered under their Tufts address also must re-register to vote every year if their school address changes
For instance, they are more likely to toss out Tufts students' forms with a mistake than those of other Medford and Somerville residents
And as a result are more picky when reviewing Tufts student voter registration forms
A fellow student told me that the City of Medford and the City of Somerville are not big fans of Tufts students voting
This reminds me of a discussion we had in my Introduction to American Politics class last semester
Earlier today, someone wearing a "Tufts Votes" button told me that some voters were being turned away
The most important issue to them is immigration reform which they feel the U.S. has messed up on for a long time
A Sanders voter just told me that they agree with him on almost every issue besides gun control
I also spoke with a junior who voted for John Kasich because he is the most moderate candidate and he doesn't want Trump to be the nominee
Another Fletcher student voted for Clinton because she feels that Clinton is the only sufficiently competent candidate running
He also wants to elect someone that he can trust
He wants an interesting general election race and he thinks it will be a joke if Trump is the nominee
Just spoke with a Fletcher student who is unaffiliated and voted for Marco Rubio because he doesn't want Donald Trump to win Massachusetts
If your precinct is the Tufts Administration Building, you enter through this door facing Holland St. https://t.co/hzXd7A55Wl
They are also stationed on the upper Mayer campus center patio
If you need a ride to your precinct, call (646)-546-6655 and Jumbo Vote 2016 will pick you up
If you live off campus, check https://t.co/DPu08mZYkM to find your precinct
addendum: Fairmount (grad student) also votes here
addendum: Wilson also votes here
As a reminder, Massachusetts polls are open from 7 a.m.- 8 p.m. Voters in line by 8 p.m. will be allowed to vote
Other important issues to voters included maintaining President Obama's legacy
Climate change was specifically popular among Sanders supporters
Most important issues to voters included foreign policy, climate change, and the economy
Although one Sanders voter did mention that a Sanders Presidency would mean higher taxes
Among Sanders voters, they tend to prefer him for economic reasons
One voter added that it's important that the U.S. elect their first female president
The general consensus among Clinton voters is she's a more viable general election candidate who can realistically achieve more as President
One senior, the junior, one sophomore and the first-year voted for Bernie Sanders
The graduate student, two seniors and one sophomore voted for Hillary Clinton
and one is a graduate student
Of the eight students I've spoken to so far, three are seniors, one is a junior, two are sophomores, one is a first-year
The other three male voters said they voted for Bernie Sanders
Both female voters and two male voters I spoke to said they voted for Hillary Clinton
As an FYI, polls opened at 7 a.m.
A Gantcher Center precinct worker mentioned turnout has been low today, unsure if they've hit 100 voters yet
Of this group, two were female and four were male
Gantcher Center voters: The precinct entrance is on the far right side of the building https://t.co/xCo0PL6upu
Of the six Tufts student voters who I've spoken with so far, three voted for Bernie Sanders and three voted for Hillary Clinton
This precinct is further away so Jumbo Vote 2016 will be providing rides to vote
Bartol (Arts Haus) and Davies (I House)
The following Somerville campus buildings vote at the Assisted Living Facility (405 Alewife Brooke Parkway)
Chandler (Spanish House), Hall (Bayit), Milne (La Casa), Schmalz (French House) and Wyeth (German House)
The following Somerville campus buildings vote at the Tufts Administration Building (167 Holland St)
South, START (Asian American Center), Stratton and Tilton
Anthony (Crafts), Capen (Africana), Metcalf, Richardson, Bush, Haskell, Hodgdon, Latin Way, Lewis, Slavic/Russian House, Sophia Gordon,
The following Somerville campus buildings vote at the Holy Bible Baptist Church (14 Chapel St)
That would be Carmichael, Carpenter, Hill, Houston, McCollester (grad student), Miller, Tousey (grad student), West, Wren and Hillsides
As a reminder, if you live in a Medford campus building, you're precinct is Gantcher Center
