This is the nature of public demonstrations the kids were just looking at him and some were cheering
Sure the kids could have been more respectful but why is the  media making such a big deal out of it this is free speech and how demonstrations work.	I definitely feel for the man but people need to grow up and stop being so offended 		https://t.co/ZBzImj4mrz
@slpng_giants @instagram @jessicaramos Hate speech laws by their nature are subjective some religious people for a long time deemed the act of homosexuality hateful and against G-ds wishes so consistent enforcement on a subjective basis is virtually impossible
@slpng_giants @instagram I give you @jessicaramos a Democratic lawmaker who recently based an anti discrimination speech law in NY called Genda she is against discrimination but still worries that this speech code can be used against people of color 		https://t.co/EVn4jEwHSS
@slpng_giants @instagram I agree completely it‚Äôs their platform and they can ban whoever they want for whatever reason, I still disagree with the policy because speech policy can easily be used to target people for no good reason including minorities and people of color
@slpng_giants @instagram Also business should have free speech policies in general instead of letting public frustration control who is on their platform otherwise if would mean if the public has a racist sentiment and pressures companies they could easily start moving based on racist ideas
@slpng_giants @instagram Sure we don‚Äôt have a right to be on them, and that‚Äôs their legal choice I still think only because it‚Äôs legal that still doesn‚Äôt it make it right for them to regulate speech
@slpng_giants @instagram Also twitter platforms are very broad and wide along with instagram so how can hate speech laws generally be uniformly enforced their two many violations and that kind of approach would be diffcult for the creators to do that
@slpng_giants @instagram I wish I knew how to stop harassment and mean speech without giving companies and theose in power to regulate speech and not come at the cost of suppressing free speech, this is a problem for me
@slpng_giants @instagram Also the harassment of the mother and child is unacceptable I don‚Äôt know the best way to deal with it online but I will definitely condem it as wrong and shameful
@slpng_giants @instagram Don‚Äôt you see this as a problem with hate speech policies in general they are selectively enforced and at the creator of a companies choice
@Madmadmonkey2 @lasuac @StephanieKelton Another fair point, but then you are making the point that what we spend on should be chosen wisely mmt argues that the government has basically unlimited money to spend so why not take some risks of how much the government spends won‚Äôt matter anyway?	#MMT
@wikiDerek @StephanieKelton That‚Äôs a fair point spending a on different things may have different effects of stimulating the ecomony, but that does not disprove my logic of why not spend on a wall of its better to spend then not spend
@lasuac @StephanieKelton Also building a wall can be considered a federally funded project that will create jobs and stimulate the ecomony I can‚Äôt speak for a walls efficiency and optics but it goes in line of mmt which involves spending to stimulate the ecomony
@lasuac @StephanieKelton First of all government spending is highly polticial and raises questions of policy such as what should the government t spend on and how much so in essence MMT is a polticial ecomonic theory
@StephanieKelton If spending stimulates the ecomony according to your theory would you be willing to spend for a wall
@RealSaavedra So an anti Semite thinks she is qualified to lecture people on white supremacy, what a joke, the white supremist were chanting Jews will not replace us, I‚Äôm Jewish and white  don‚Äôt you dare put me in the same category as theose evil people
@ToddHagopian You make some intresting points, my main take away and also the reason I‚Äôm sometimes critical of the libertarian party is they have to be willing to make compermises on some of their principles aka mass migration, legalization of all drugs other then that they are fine

@HelenClarkNZ @KnowYourStuffNZ @nzdrug @globalcdp I will read the report, I don't know how much different NZ policies are from the USA where I live, all I know is Trump is out president and his administration is a regulation destroying machine, if an administration like that got elected in NZ imagine the corperate
@KnowYourStuffNZ @HelenClarkNZ @nzdrug I like many of the proposals, the problem with strictly regulate is that business once given an avuene in the drug market will fight incredibly powerfully to deregulate, people have to convinced that the regulations will hold and big business will not be able to defeat them
