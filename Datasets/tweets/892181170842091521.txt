@atDavidHoffman So, what % do you have?
I never met a Democrat that knew math...
@atDavidHoffman @eonge1 Only 62% of women use birth control, so you have to multiply that number by the % of hetero women.  Which equals 28.5%.  #7thGradeMath

Did they take away the woman's choice to choose celibacy?  No, they did not.  So, they didn't take the women's right away.

@RioSlade @kashanacauley @BernieSanders I dont think you even understand what predictive medicine is.  Medicare today is reactive medicine.  My plan is proactive.
