@mattduca321 @mcopelov Well, and this wasn’t my intention in retweeting it, it’s not representative of the people not just because Democrats don’t have the majority, but it’s not representative because there are only 3 black senators and women don’t make up the majority of the senate.

@mattduca321 @mcopelov It’s not irrelevant at all. Do you think if a party had a popular vote lead that large 100, 150 years ago that party would have lost? It’s was meant to show, if Democrats want to build a substantial majority into the fututre, they are going to have to try harder in red states.
@mattduca321 @mcopelov I wasn’t criticizing. It’s just jarring the polarity and division the country saw in the midterms. It also shows how much harder Democrats are going to have to work to win the Senate.
@mattduca321 @mcopelov So next you want to try to be smart, you should try and get the full picture before you make a comment.
@mattduca321 @mcopelov 3) Meanwhile, Republicans had a moderately good night in the Senate. This displays the division in the country. And it’s something we need to talk about.
@mattduca321 @mcopelov 1) it was meant to show the polarity in this country. Democrats are expected to win one of the largest popular vote margins in modern history for the house and 2) Republicans have thus far seen the greatest loses in a midterm since Watergate.

@HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump #ImpeachTrump
This is the last straw. This is the countless time where he has wished for @HillaryClinton 's harm. @realDonaldTrump needs to go.
Their vote condoned that.
They were told about the civil rights investigations into him and his history of racism and misogyny. They voted for that.
Forget wanting something different. They heard the tape where he went on about assaulting women. They heard him praise dictators.
Frankly, everyone that voted for him knew this going in. They voted for a racist, a sexist, an authoritarian, a criminal.
To think that the POTUS is among the lowest forms of human life is ridiculous. He has no ethics, no morals, and no heart.
Every Republican needs to universally condemn him retweeting and therefore condoning this gif.
He tried to physically intimidate her on a debate stage with over a hundred million people watching. He has obstructed justice.
He called for his political opponents assassination and jailing. Now he wishes he was the one who gave her a concussion.
He has no ethical standards. He has violated the Constitution. He has violated human being's civil rights.
He is the opposite of presidential. He is a thug and con who is fascinated with authoritarians and sexually assaulting women.
Not including anything else, he has to be impeached now. The woman was in the hospital and had a concussion because of that fall. https://t.co/c8GD5XWdBb
