@ZalmanGelbman We will agree to disagree on that.
@jacobfhsmith I agree. He is VP material, but not ready for president yet.
@ZalmanGelbman Sanders is. I feel some of the senators can be considered to be tested nationally due to their notoriety (Harris, Warren, Booker), whereas Beto has not been around long enough to have that experience. Beto strikes me as a presidential candidate down the road, however.
@ZalmanGelbman He strikes me more as VP material. He isn‚Äôt as testef on the national stage as others are.
I am convinced that Beto O'Rourke is merely the flavor of the month. Does the Democratic Party really want to nominate a candidate who tried but failed to win election statewide? By the way, it was Rahm Emmanuel who brought up that point.

@kenblair75 @LarrySabato The focus on Pelosi was only one facet of their strategy. I'd argue that what brought Dems over the top was recruitment of excellent candidates at a time when Trump had poor approval ratings in competitive districts. But we can agree to disagree.
@kenblair75 @LarrySabato Since when has Trump ever focused on just one person (once the primaries are over)? He will focus on Pelosi and the Dem candidate because Pelosi has a poor approval rating, so it works in his favor.

@SherryAva @RepMaxineWaters I agree with you on all accounts.
@proudchicagoan @Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters I agree that Trump‚Äôs words are often inappryand can be construed in a way that could lead to violence. You don‚Äôt have to agree with me in Waters, but that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to tell me I am wrong just because you disagree.
@SherryAva @RepMaxineWaters This is just my personal view. By no means do you have to agree with me. Reasonable minds can differ. :)
@SherryAva @RepMaxineWaters Her words, in the legal world, could lead to incitement (words that could be interpreted in a way that could lead to unruly or violent behavior). Her words contribute to a highly charged environment that could lead to violence.	https://t.co/h2gsPoukdh
@JasonKander You have shown tremendous bravery and courage today. You set an example for those who suffer with PTSD but may not be ready to face their pain. You should be proud. You and your family are in my prayers.
@Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters At the end of the day, we are merely debating. The unfortunate things about Twitter is that you never get to see how the other person is "saying" something. Nothing I said was spoken with anger, just as I am certain yours were not. You have nothing to apologize for. :)
@Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters I in no way believe that Democrats advocate for violence, just as I know that there are Republicans who advocate violence. My frustration is with the way Rep. Waters is using words that could inflame passions. We agree that Trump speaks in a similar manner.
@sablebaby28 @tiffanyclay @RepMaxineWaters Asking people to "make a scene" as Rep. Waters did can lead to incitement, which occurs when one's words incite someone to undertake a physical action of some kind. With regard to Trump, I agree that his words are in the same boat, and I do not agree with him on it.
@Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters Second, you choose to bring Trump into the argument when I mentioned nothing whatsoever about him. I agree that Trump has oftentimes spoken in a way he should not have, and it in no way excuses his behavior. Next time you should read what I wrote &amp; stick to the argument at hand.
@Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters Once again, you are taking my words and completely ignoring what I said. I said Waters' words were very much open to interpretation. In this political climate, it was inappropriate for her to say what she said. In the legal world, we call that incitement.

@Hermitwise @RepMaxineWaters First off, everything I said has happened today. Second, I did not say "Democrats". I singled out Maxine Waters, if you actually look at what I wrote. Third, Rep. Waters told people to confront Trump officials and make a scene, which was left open to interpretation.

Democrats, don‚Äôt forget to thank Dianne Feinstein for screwing up your opposition to Kavanaugh when he is (likely) confirmed on Saturday.
Votes scheduled for Fri morning (committee) and Sat (full Senate). My thoughts: GOP leaders would not be going ahead with the vote unless they were confident that they had the votes to confirm Kavanaugh. I'm willing to bet his testimony sealed the deal for some of the undecideds.

@MZHemingway The unfortunate thing is that probably 90% of the Senate will be voting based on emotion, not evidence.
Senators Mazie Hirono and Jeff Merkeley have sent out fundraising emails today regarding Dr. Ford's testimony. The fact that they would raise money off of her pain is unconscionable and inexcusable.
@kkondik I think a lot of it depends on how Kavanaugh does. If he appears credible (and the determination becomes he said-she said), then it could have big implications on them. If he doesn't do so well, and some Republicans jump ship, then it might not matter.

@LanaParrilla I really miss you all! You all did such a wonderful job. Hopefully one day it will come back (noy holding my breath though).

The timing of these allegations against Kavanaugh seems quite convenient. Even the accuser‚Äôs lawyer says she was forced to cone forward. Democrats are hell-bent on trying (in vain) to stop Kavanaugh, but all they will end up with is embarrassment.

Dems don't think a SCOTUS justice should be nominated in an election year. Merrick Garland's nomination occurred only a few years ago. Additionally, since WWII, 10 justices have been appointed in an election year. Stop the hypocrisy. It's just embarrassing.
There are 50 Muslim majority countries in the world. Of those, only 5 are included in the travel ban. 5/7 countries that were banned have a Muslim majority. As SCOTUS showed, this ban was done for national security purposes, not out of animus for the Muslim community.
Democrats blasted Republicans for not holding a vote on Merrick Garland. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, Democrats don't want a vote on the eventual nominee to replace Kennedy. This is complete and utter hypocrisy.
Justice Kennedy's retirement is huge news. It also will add more partisanship to Congress as President Trump nominates his replacement. Red state Democrats must be on edge, as their votes may determine whether their constituents re-elect them.

Amy McGrath's comparison of her feelings post-election to that of the horrific slaughter of nearly 3,000 people is shameful. She should apologize, especially to the families who lost loved ones that day. This is not someone who should be elected to Congress. #KY6
For the love of God, would you please just go away! You lost. The majority of the nation is not sorry that you lost. Move on. https://t.co/WupKq6LvKC
Just so I have this straight... it's never okay to separate children from their families, but it is okay to slaughter millions of unborn infants every year? Got it, thanks for telling me how I should feel.
@MZHemingway @SenFeinstein It would be if she weren‚Äôt running against Kevin de Leon.
The deportation of illegal-immigrant families was likely done to force Congress to act on immigration. After all, images of children being separated from their families are so awful that it should spur Congress to act quickly. Regardless, something needs to change.
@greta Your dog is just like mine. She only gives that "sorry" look to appease you. But we know the truth!
So many people are in an uproar about politicians wishing "Happy Father's Day" in light of families being separated at the border. Seriously, chill out and stop being mad for the sake of being mad. If Bill Clinton had done this you would not be so mad. Oh wait, he did do it...
Boy, Chris Cuomo lays it on thick. Does he even consider himself unbiased anymore?
The IG report reaffirms the obvious -- Comey had disdain for the law, acting instead for his own devices. As if this was not arrogant enough, he felt the need to thump his chest and write a book about it. The problem with alienating everyone is that you lose allies. Tough luck!

Claire McCaskill's use of a private jet is ridiculous, but not surprising. She says she fights to keep Washington accountable, but is she accountable for this? She has become comfortable in DC and out of touch with Missouri.
Although this will be a tough race, @RepComstock is not one to be underestimated. Pundits were writing her political obituary in 2016, and she survived. She could survive this too.
Today we remember the 49 lives that were brutally taken at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando two years ago today. As long as we keep their memories alive, they will not have died in vain. Hate will never win.
@realDonaldTrump is an unconventional leader, and that is how he was able to bring about this summit with North Korea. It takes an unconventional approach to deal with such a precarious situation. My thoughts and prayers are with both leaders as they make history.
Wait a minute! The media has tried to force us to believe this race was a tossup, merely because the other special elections have been. If you detected the hint of sarcasm, you'd be correct. https://t.co/Ce09QFU0xh
Nancy Pelosi, the gift that keeps on giving! https://t.co/Xu7HFUSPsN
@HuntsmanAbby @HarperChildrens Congratulations! That is an excellent message for our kids. Way to go, @HuntsmanAbby!!
Kudos to @ChrisSununu and NH on banning gay conversion therapy. It mentally destroys those who are forced to undergo it. This type of ban, I would add, is also a form of suicide prevention.

It seems that @JoeManchinWV is willing to say anything to get re-elected. He was far less supportive of @realDonaldTrump before he began running for re-election. @MorriseyWV, meanwhile has consistently support Trump. Remember that, WV! #wvsen
Today we remember those who fought so bravely as they stormed the beaches of Normandy. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." John 15:13. When I think of true bravery, I think of these men. Thanks will never be enough, but thank you.
SCOTUS decision in Masterpiece case reminds me of Solomon threatening to split the baby -- neither side gets what it truly wants.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy was at a fundraiser in DC while her district was being ravaged by Hurricane Irma. Meanwhile, politicians like @ScottforFlorida were monitoring the storm from FL. It's clear who deserves to be in Congress, and who does not.
I used to like Rudy Giuliani, but now I cringe whenever he speaks. His legal advice to @realDonaldTrump has been awful. If he follows it, he is going to severely damage his presidency.
RT @guypbenson: Speaking culturally (not legally or politically), my earnest wish for America re: thorny LGBT rights/religious liberty issu‚Ä¶

@EricGreitens' resignation was long overdue. Aside from the obvious moral implications, the investigation into his charity would have likely led to greater distractions for the GOP. His resignation will allow @MissouriGOP to focus its' attention on defeating @clairecmc in Nov.
@TheKalenAllen Your food videos make my day! Whenever I am feeling down, I watch them, and it brings a smile to my face. You really need to do more of them!
On this Memorial Day, thank you to all who have given the ultimate sacrifice, and to their families, who give up so much as well. Your sacrifice will never be forgotten.
Wonderful to see Josh Holt back home safely in the U.S. after two agonizing years in Venezuela. Love or hate @realDonaldTrump , he has been able to secure the release of U.S. prisoners from both #NorthKorea and #Venezuela. That is quite an accomplishment.
In her speech at Yale, HRC admitted that she regrets the mistakes she made in the election. It only took 18 months for her to blame her herself.
@jameyosteen @ScottGBinkley @CaseyCagle If you think Mexico has no corruption, then you are kidding yourself.
@jameyosteen @ScottGBinkley @CaseyCagle We aren‚Äôt Mexico though. I‚Äôm not sure quoting the constitution of a country whose government wirh rampant corruption is the best argument.
Making  promise to use your personal truck to round up illegal immigrants is not only a sad attempt to gain more votes, it's also immoral. Its ICE's duty, not Brian Kemp's. @CaseyCagle is by far the best candidate for GA tomorrow. That is, if Republicans want to win.
If you really want to see Congress become more productive, get mayors to run. Their focus is on small-scale issues. That can make a real impact in our communities, especially as we deal with the opioid epidemic.
@greta When I went to law school, I was lucky enough to take a class where we had to write a complaint. It was the only class that did this, and 10	people took it.
Yes, things do need to be done to ensure guns stay out of the hands of those who should not have them. However, this constant attention to gunmen and their motives puts ideas in the heads of those hellbent of evil.
If you have ever wondered why the number of school shootings is increasing, it may have something to do with the emphasis the media is putting on it.
@SenGillibrand : "We don't value women in society", then goes on to vote against Chao, Haspel, DeVos, and Nielsen. I suppose we value women, but only if they hold the same values we do. That's a great example for America to follow...
Although I have little interest in the Royal Wedding, I have to say that the media's lack of boundaries just astounds me. They report on Meghan's father non-stop. How about letting them have privacy? After all, the media/paparazzi are the reason Harry's mother can't be there.
Would somebody please send Jeff Flake a spine? His seems to have gone missing.
The Dems' anger against @realDonaldTrump is so strong that they continue to nominate candidates that will be unelectable to mainstream Dems and Independents. This is why I question the idea of the coming "blue wave." Republicans have a real opportunity to keep the House.
Kudos to @GovLarryHogan for banning gay conversion therapy. These programs should be banned in all states.

The opening of our embassy in Jerusalem will have no effect on a peace process because there is will never be peace. There has not been peace since the 12 tribes of Israel were formed, and there will never be peace until Jesus comes on the final day.
The opening of our embassy is Jerusalem was a major step forward in the U.S.-Israeli relationship. The U.S. must stand with Israel in order to preserve its existence. @realDonaldTrump showed today he is about results, not rhetoric.

@realDonaldTrump is able to secure the release of three American prisoners from NoKo and all the media can do is fault him for leaving the Iran deal, making it more difficult to release Americans in Iran. Any release is progress!
I thought the same thing from the second I heard of these "polls". Blankenship was never ahead. https://t.co/ZGVsnphNUb
What‚Äôs reckless is making a deal with a party who continually undermines the conditions of the deal by continuing it‚Äôs nuclear program in addition to sending support to Assad. https://t.co/7P0hveCsju
The Iran deal was flawed from the start. @realDonaldTrump was right to withdraw from it.
@BarackObama was willing to be ‚Äútough‚Äù on Syria, but not on Iran. Apparently he did not realize that they are, in effect, one and the same. That‚Äôs how we ended up with the terrible Iran deal.
NY AG @Schneiderman has disgraced the AG office by his conduct. He is not a true supporter of the #MeToo movement, he is part of the problem. It is time for him to resign.
@JohnKerry's Iran "diplomacy" is an outrageous attempt to save the only real achievement of his tenure as SoS. It is an attempt to stay relevant... perhaps for a 2020 run?

If Dems win the House in November, it will not be because of @NancyPelosi. It will be despite her.  The biggest fight Dems face among themselves is Pelosi's ego. If she wins, it will be to their detriment.

@SherrodBrown will be difficult to defeat. It will take a staunch conservative who is willing to work hard to defeat him. @MikeGibbonsOH is that man. I have never seen a politician work as hard as Mike has. That is how we defeat @SherrodBrown.
@MaryTaylorOH is the right choice for Ohio. She is a proven conservative, and she has shown that she will not be a repeat of @JohnKasich. Morever, she can win in November.
The media would have us believe that GOP infighting will cost them in November. It doesn‚Äôt even compare to the tactics being used by the tea-party-like movement on the Left. #midterms2018
@Jontester has yet to come forward with any physical proof of the allegations against @RonnyJacksonMD. Is he fighting for a better VA, or attempting to undermine @realDonaldTrump? His voting record tells the real story.
Michelle Wolf's "humor" at WH Correspondent's Dinner was a poor attempt at humor. It is never acceptable to attack someone based on their looks. @michelleisawolf owes @PressSec an apology.
