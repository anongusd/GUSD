@parnellwrites US military can handle land mass and terrain. Afghan was response to 9/11, not "waiting to be liberated." I was in Iraq in '03 and '07, big difference in attitude. Post-invasion Iraq was mismanaged and Abu Ghraib made things worse.
@NATOmonitor @HelmsTusmc0311 When possible, I agree.  Iraq was possible, but would not have happened as quickly as Germany.  There's no path forward in Afghanistan, so we shouldn't waste our resources there.  Given the current climate in Iran, it's possible.
