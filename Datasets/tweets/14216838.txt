I'm coming out. Yes, I am one of those people who can't, under any circumstances, take Libertarians seriously. Because, you know, facts
Oh, Libertarian trolls, you're so cute with your little games of one-upsmanship and egotism
Oh, Libertarian trolls, you're so cute with your little "facts" that no logic or evidence can refute
And, no, it doesn't convince any outside parties that your version of reality is the real one. Those people already agreed with you
"Winning" an argument with me personally, while it may make you feel awesome about yourself, has no impact on the policies of the country
Now, back to ignoring people who reuse ignorant arguments
SeaTac, Connecticut, San Jose, Maryland, Hawaii, etc., mean we win.  Soon it'll be national and there's nothing you can tweet to stop it
And no, I have no interest in rearguing things on Twitter that have long ago been settled.  And, no, that doesn't mean you win
I wonder why it is you guys and gals lose every policy battle?
If you repeat bad logic and personal insults enough times, I'm sure you'll convince someone who doesn't already agree with you
Welcome all my Libertarian and conservative troll friends, please proceed to tweet the same tired arguments I've heard hundreds of times

@rob_mullin If I say "gay men are still men," it doesn't mean that all men are gay. This is logic/grammar 101
@rob_mullin Yep, the words "equal" and "same" are not in that Tweet, you made an assumption that I didn't say
@rob_mullin I said e-cigs are cigs, which seems pretty obvious from the fact that cig is part of e-cig
@rob_mullin I did not say they were equal, you made that up
@rob_mullin It's not intuition to believe that inhaling nicotine, regardless of the form, is dangerous. It's science
@rob_mullin Default doesn't mean universal. We have a patchwork because of federalism and officials voting based on politics, not science
@rob_mullin On something that could kill you, the default policy position is "illegal until proven safe"
@rob_mullin The key point is that we have no idea if e-cigs ARE better, we've only been told that by the companies that make them
@rob_mullin I don't do "intuitive," I do science. e-cigs could be better than cigs and still be really bad for you

@sintixerr It's not magic fairy dust, it's motivation.  People do different things for profit vs. public good.
@sintixerr But I know there are way less than 2 million
@sintixerr There are nearly 2 million full-time federal employees that are not contractors.  Don't know how many contractors there are
@sintixerr But that's anecdotal, systematic studies show otherwise (although in some fields there are obviously exceptions)
@sintixerr It's far from "most," it outsources in certain sectors, but not in most others
@sintixerr Right, but in reality, they are almost always worse in private sector
@sintixerr Except that the missions are different.  Profit vs. public good.  It's not perfect, but public good motive is better
@sintixerr I don't think it adds, I think it replaces, with a more efficient one.  Private companies are bureaucracies, too, just worse ones
