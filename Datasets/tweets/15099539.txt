The Senate filibuster took those destructive ideas off the table and the bipartisan compromise resulted in a 10-year extension of CHIP with a Republican majority House and Senate and President Trump in 2018. (8) https://t.co/7fv64hLNog
Let‚Äôs consider CHIP, which covers 9 million kids.		Without the need for 60 votes, CHIP would likely have been extended but look vastly different. 		Some wanted to cap coverage at 200% of poverty, impose waiting periods, rescind $7 billion in funding, and consider vouchers. (7) https://t.co/gFehHR1ust
One year the Dept of Education might help fund public schools, supports science programs, and promote equity. 		The next it guts our public schools, funds vouchers the privatization of schools, and promotes climate change denial. (6) https://t.co/S679RwIaRC

For example, Medicaid was created in 1965 and now covers over 76 million people.		If you ended the filibuster, it could easily be block granted, voucherized, or even repealed. Work requirements could be mandated rather than a waiver in a few states. #ProtectMedicaid (4) https://t.co/tcArcj5f1V
The filibuster is unnecessary to protect Medicare and Social Security from attack. But it helps.		Importantly, the filibuster helps protect Medicaid, CHIP, SNAP, Head Start, WIC, etc. Low-income citizens and immigrants likely have the most to lose with end of the filibuster. (3)
First, it takes years to build something but just days to tear it down. The potential harm that can be done by eliminating the filibuster is enormous.		Progressives should at least pause to consider them. (2) https://t.co/JXPo8QXMut

‚ÄúSo, too, thousands of children will grow up not knowing their real parents and not understanding their sacrifice.‚Äù		Thank you @MiamiHerald editorial board for such a powerful statement. Every single line was perfectly written.		#FreeTheChildren #FamiliesBelongTogether (13)
‚ÄúBut it seems likely that thousands of parents are likely to never see their children again. They might go through the rest of their lives never knowing what happened to their kids and whether their attempt at seeking asylum was worth such an awful sacrifice.‚Äù (12)
‚ÄúAt this point, it‚Äôs hard to imagine how this can end in anything other than tragedy for thousands of children and their parents.‚Äù (11)
‚ÄúThe brutal reality is that the administration clearly had no concern about the human dimensions of its cold-hearted policy. This abominable outcome was foreseeable had anyone in the administration, anyone at all, given a damn.‚Äù (10)
‚Äú‚ÄòDisrupting the family relationship is not a recommended child welfare practice,‚Äô‚Äù she wrote, apparently with no sense of irony. (9)
‚ÄúHHS Deputy Director of Refugee Resettlement Jallyn Sualog said it could take 100 employees working more than a year to review all the cases, and that taking children from their sponsors would be ‚Äòdisruptive and harmful to the child.‚Äô‚Äù (8)
‚ÄúThousands of children ‚Äî some as young as 18 months ‚Äî taken from their parents, possibly never to be returned.‚Äù (7)
‚ÄúIf only the administration had worried about traumatizing children before it began taking them from their families, putting them in camp cities and then farming them out to ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô homes.‚Äù (6)
‚ÄúNow, incredibly, the administration says that thousands of migrant children shouldn‚Äôt be reunited with their families ‚Äî ever ‚Äî because it would take too much effort and might traumatize the children.‚Äù (5)
‚ÄúThe administration didn‚Äôt even attempt to keep track of many of the children being torn from their mothers‚Äô arms as part of its inhumane and unnecessary family separation policy.‚Äù (4)
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw: ‚ÄúThe unfortunate reality is that under the present system, migrant children are not accounted for with the same efficiency and accuracy as property.‚Äù (3)
‚ÄúWhen is a child worth less than a suitcase? When the child in question is an immigrant at the U.S. border, and the Trump administration exercises its ‚Äòzero tolerance‚Äô policy.‚Äù (2)

@BrooksLandgraf The allure of Medicaid block grants is a false one. 		‚ÄúFish see the worm, not the hook.‚Äù #txlege (6) https://t.co/1Y9qIqdtLD
@BrooksLandgraf Medicaid block grants are an arbitrary capped level of funding that fail to adjust for public health crises, such as Zika, AMF (the polio-like virus in kids), and vaccine preventable illnesses like measles. 		Again, Texas would be disproportionately harmed. #txlege (5) https://t.co/q47ZcSImPn
@BrooksLandgraf Block grants also do not adjust for population and demographic changes.		Therefore, because Texas is one of the fastest growing states in the country, it could be one of the most harmed by a Medicaid block grant. #txlege (4) https://t.co/wIP8PMq3pZ
@BrooksLandgraf Second, a Medicaid block grant would fail to adjust for natural disasters. 		Texas is susceptible to hurricanes, tornados, flooding, drought, etc.		Harvey caused the death of 103 people and injuries and tragedy to thousands of others. #txlege (3) https://t.co/aoCPWnGbmC
@BrooksLandgraf First, block grants punish low-spending states to most and lock in that inequity. 		As an example, look at TANF. Texas gets a fraction of the dollars per child in poverty that the rest of the nation receives. Even worse for Texas, that inequity has grown over time. #txlege (2) https://t.co/jHIiLWdv90

@ezralevin Construction takes years. Demolition takes days.		I worry about the 76M with Medicaid (about to be 54 years old) &amp; the 9M with CHIP (now 21). If they were blown up at Trump‚Äôs inauguration, states couldn‚Äôt rebuild them for years. 		Too many people violently harmed in the meantime.
@ezralevin Well then, you have to change the constitution too.		Trump won 30 states. Even with Manchin, Donnelly, McCaskill, Jones &amp; Heitkamp, there wasn‚Äôt 50.		When the game is rigged so that a minority of people can have 60 or more senators, then it would be a tyranny of the minority.

@ezralevin The Senate is stacked to elect conservative senators. 		Trump carried 30 states even though he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes.		You argued that is why we should repeal the filibuster, but I think it argues as to why the filibuster is so important. Defense. (12)
@ezralevin There is also the fact Wyoming &amp; Idaho have the same number of senators as California &amp; New York.		‚ÄúIn 2017, for the first time, the Senate‚Äôs decisions were often made by a coalition of states representing less than half of the country‚Äôs population.‚Äù https://t.co/KMh9JhxHxA (11)
@ezralevin Maybe I am just more concerned or sensitive about defense as a child advocate. Medicare and Social Security would likely be protected.		But the people most likely threatened may be low-income kids and adults. The Medicaid block grant debate gave us some indication of that. (10) https://t.co/JiP7BS2rCi
@ezralevin Even worse, HHS had a paper to repeal CHIP and move kids into the individual market. Seriously. It was called Rubik‚Äôs Cube and is horrifying.		The filibuster eliminated even the discussion or serious consideration of any of that. 		Thank goodness. (9)
@ezralevin Let‚Äôs consider CHIP, which covers 9 million kids.		Without the need for 60 votes, CHIP would likely have been extended but look vastly different. They wanted to repeal ICHIA, cap coverage at 200% of poverty, impose waiting periods, rescind $7 billion, and consider vouchers. (8)
@ezralevin Medicaid‚Äôs entitlement, EPSDT, standards, and consumer protections were protected by the filibuster.		Without the filibuster, work requirements could have been mandated in all states in Medicaid, SNAP, etc. rather than our current battle with it via waiver in a new states. (7)
@ezralevin People discount the importance of defense. It can win championships. üòÉ		For example, Medicaid was under attack in 2017 via reconciliation.		But the vast majority of the statute could not be touched, including the entitlement, because of the filibuster. (6)
@ezralevin The UK passed a child poverty target to cut poverty in half over 10 years. In just the matter of a few years, it was gutted and destroyed.		In the EU. Out of the EU.		I worry about that and would highlight the people most harmed are poor people. It barely impacts the rich. (5)
@ezralevin Once gutted, it would take years to rebuild it or it might not even be possible.		It would be government by whim.		One year the Dept of Education funds public schools and supports science programs. The next it fund‚Äôs vouchers and privatization and promotes climate denial. (4)
@ezralevin For example, it took decades to build Medicaid into what it is. Medicaid covers over 76 million people.		If you ended the filibuster, it could easily be block granted, voucherized, or even repealed. Work requirements could be mandated rather than a waiver in a few. (3)
@ezralevin The filibuster is unnecessary to protect Medicare, Social Security, and Veterans. But it helps.		Importantly, the filibuster helps protect Medicaid, CHIP, SNAP, Head Start, WIC, etc. I worry that low-income citizens and immigrants have the most to lose with end of filibuster. (2)
@ezralevin Ezra, as you know, I agree with you 99.9% of the time, but not on ending the filibuster. For what it is worth, here is why. 		First, it takes years to build something but just days to tear it down. The potential harm is just too enormous. (1)

@colinb1123 All good.
@colinb1123 I promise to stop. One last point.		In health care, ending the filibuster won‚Äôt harm senior citizens or people with disabilities in Medicare. 		The people most threatened are low-income kids and adults in Medicaid, CHIP, and the exchanges. 		As for immigrants, oh my... https://t.co/K6EsgdC9O0
@colinb1123 Yes! But that cuts both ways. üòÉ		Trump is obsessed with going 'nuclear' in the Senate - CNNPolitics https://t.co/kMNK1wnltJ
@colinb1123 Even if they kept CHIP, if they only needed to talk to themselves, they wanted to repeal ICHIA, cap coverage at 200% of poverty, impose waiting periods, rescind $7 billion out of CHIP, and consider privatization. 		That couldn‚Äôt happen because they had to work with Senate Dems.
@colinb1123 Without the need for 60 votes, CHIP might have been extended........or not. 		The Trump Administration wanted to move thoe 9 million CHIP kids into the individual market so they could improve the risk pool when Obamacare ‚Äúwas repealed.‚Äù Seriously.
@colinb1123 Right, but without the filibuster, there are no protections. It would just take hours.		The entitlement, the imposition of work requirements upon all states (not just a few), repeal of basic standards, EPSDT, etc. would have all been at risk in the last Congress.
@colinb1123 Agree. We see the same issues but you see glass half full while I see it as half empty here.		You weigh benefit more. I worry about loss.		I worry it takes years and years to build things but just days to tear them down.
@colinb1123 Wyoming and Idaho have as many senators as California and New York.

@colinb1123 Because it has tripartisan support in the UK.		Medicare has bipartisan support in the U.S. it would not be harmed. But Medicaid and the ACA would have been gutted without that protection.

@colinb1123 But you are missing the importance of defense. Trump could pull out of the Paris Accord and suspend the head of EPA‚Äôs Office of Child Protection. 		But laws protecting the environment, endangered species, air quality, etc. were all protected by the Senate filibuster.
@colinb1123 As for Medicaid, it was one vote away from repeal. One vote. 		And thanks to reconciliation, important basic protections in the statute couldn‚Äôt be touched.		That one vote was John McCain and he didn‚Äôt vote no because of Medicaid. They would have the votes in the Senate today.

@colinb1123 There is also the small state bias, so a minority of the population could dominate the Senate for years. Ending the filibuster might result in minority rural states ruling for years, and so, majority rule could be a complete fallacy.		Just my two cents... (6)
@colinb1123 The British Labour Party passed a child poverty reduction plan to cut child poverty in half in ten years.  		The Tories abolished it and austerity has led to rapid increases in child poverty.		In the EU. Out of the EU.		I worry about that. (5)
@colinb1123 It would be government by whim.		Today grants to public schools and climate change and evolution taught in science, but two years later, vouchers, charters, and creationism and climate denial. 		Yikes. (4)
@colinb1123 It took decades to build Medicaid to what it is today.		If you allowed simply majority, it could easily be block granted, vouchered, or repealed. It would then be nearly impossible or take years to restore it. (3)
@colinb1123 You know that it takes years to build a major program. Bipartisanship and the filibuster helps protect it regardless of any shift who is in the majority in the Senate.		In contrast, it takes just a few weeks to tear a program down. (2)
@colinb1123 Colin, I agree with you on Medicaid buy-in, etc., but not the filibuster. The Senate is unique now because it forces bipartisan compromise and work. (1)

Debating the record is important.		But any rational and fair analysis would easily come to the conclusion that O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs record on these issues is one of deep compassion, understanding, an embrace of humanity, and the protection of children. https://t.co/iMKcPh4swd (13) https://t.co/0II7ciuc4k
Those attempting to cast a stone at O‚ÄôRourke on border or immigration issues should look first at their own candidate‚Äôs record. 		I guarantee it won‚Äôt be as strong. 		Not even close. https://t.co/pEkJLHtSRy (12)
It is also important to highlight O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs stellar record on border and immigration issues. 		He sponsored legislation to protect DREAMers. He opposes Trump‚Äôs family separations, caging of migrant children in detention centers, and border wall. https://t.co/zHqUsp4C87 (11)
Also, the lead sponsor of a bill to repeal the IPAB in the Senate is Sen. Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon. 		It had 14 Democratic cosponsors. Wyden‚Äôs argument is that his bill protects Medicare from cuts by the Trump Administration. https://t.co/63V4xOWv5a (10) https://t.co/GNoERS0zpT
Thus, voting to repeal the IPAB and protect Medicare from being cut by the Trump Administration should be seen as something progressives might support.		In fact, many members of the House Progressive Caucus did. https://t.co/D5LtiX9Wma (9) https://t.co/q8Z7wMbeRX
In fact, two major arguments against the IPAB are that: (1) it imposes a mechanism to arbitrarily cut Medicare based on a per capita cap limit and (2) it grants unilateral power to do so would be with the Trump Administration. https://t.co/h9C5P89OxH (8) https://t.co/loCpLWAr3T
Ironically, there was some criticism of his vote by @davidsirota of his vote to repeal a non-existing Medicare commission (IPAB) as somehow chipping away ay Obamacare. 		It doesn‚Äôt. Not at all. https://t.co/zDYkLS7owO (7)
O‚ÄôRourke has also been outstanding on health care issues for all Americans, and used his position on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs to focus on improving access and quality of care. https://t.co/cnNJpLl80m (6)
O‚ÄôRourke has been a #Champion4Children. He has been a strong supporter of children and was honored by @Campaign4Kids for his outstanding work in his first term, which is rare for most freshmen Members of Congress. https://t.co/y6y5OM1qWS (5)
There is some criticism of O‚ÄôRourke that he is the ‚Äúnew Obama.‚Äù On just about every issue of importance to children, that would be a welcome relief. And on immigration issues, Beto is more progressive. https://t.co/MVk1vPcayd (4)
O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs legislative work reflects the needs of El Paso. Without a doubt, he has been a leading voice in the country on US-Mexico border and immigration issues in strong opposition to Trump policies. https://t.co/p8wYjbnXiY (3)

@kreativekonnect Beto does not take PAC money, he is a Champions for Children, and he has led the fight to protect immigrant children and families. I care about those things. Do you care?
@kreativekonnect Read Sirota‚Äôs article.
@kreativekonnect Progressives should highlight the virtue of whatever candidate they like rather than attacking others under some purity test that suddenly includes the forcing of job applicants to be subjected to government-imposed lie detector tests. #TrulyBizarre (4)
@kreativekonnect Progressives support civil liberties of employees and Beto voted against the government imposing lie detector tests upon prospective employees. How does protecting civil liberties of workers become a bad thing?		That is a ludicrous example in that article. (3)
@kreativekonnect Also, the immigration vote raised in that ‚Äústory‚Äù is ludicrous.		Beto has been a leader his whole career in the fight to stop separating families, to stop caging children, and to embrace humanity along the border.		To say otherwise is disturbing and frankly pathetic. (2)
@kreativekonnect False. 		Beto does not accept PAC money. 		Also, It may be a surprise to you, but oil and gas employs a lot of people in Texas ‚Äî some that live and work in Texas and desperately wanted Beto to defeat Cruz. Some progressives work at Chevron. Imagine that. (1)

@aglorios @marcorubio @BillGalvano @Fla_Pol @RepJoseOliva Florida has natural disasters, a rapidly growing population, public health crises, and economic recessions ‚Äî any of which could single-handedly cause a Medicaid block grant to be a disaster for the Sunshine State.		#ProtectMedicaid (10) https://t.co/LwbUuly4mc
@aglorios @marcorubio The following thread highlights a number of other reasons why Florida should reject Medicaid block grants. ‚Äî&gt;  https://t.co/xk1673OQ0Q 		#ProtectMedicaid (9)
@aglorios @marcorubio Incredibly, some Florida politicians fail to see this critical lesson. 		Instead of recognizing the failure of how a block grant hurts Florida, some want to actually impose a block grant on the entire Medicaid program. ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/FJ7h8PeDXx 		#OpposeBlockGrantingMedicaid (8) https://t.co/cU4042JaIu
@aglorios @marcorubio Also, this highlights how DSH is a block grant within Medicaid and shortchanges Florida because it is based largely on 1992 allotment levels.		This highlights the very reason block grants would be terrible for Florida &amp; why neighbor Puerto Rico is harmed by it. (7)
@aglorios On the other hand, some of Florida‚Äôs problems of high uncompensated costs are self-imposed. They and other states that have failed to expand Medicaid still have high hospital uncompensated care costs.		Again, a chart from MACPAC. #MedicaidDSH (6) https://t.co/Cys8uExT7W
@aglorios There are a couple of important points to make here:		First, Medicaid DSH dollars should be more fairly allocated and better targeted. This is a chart from MACPAC highlighting some of the disparities.		#MedicaidDSH (5) https://t.co/m82PuhrVHh
@marcorubio @aglorios I worked for many years on #MedicaidDSH issues and Sen. @marcorubio is absolutely right that Medicaid DSH dollars are distributed unfairly.

@ConradAppel It makes a hell of a a lot of sense to have people making laws related to children that actually have a sense of what children and families need and are going through. Parents as legislators should be encouraged and not dismissed. (3) https://t.co/lX5XHfQI4y
@ConradAppel Meanwhile, the decisions a state legislature makes disproportionately relate to children, whether it is early childhood, K-12 education, higher education, child abuse and neglect, child poverty, child health (Medicaid &amp; LaCHIP), child nutrition, juvenile justice, etc. (2)
@ConradAppel I will happily answer, they will either pay for it with their salary or possibly get subsidized child care other ways. (1)

Trump‚Äôs Border Wall Could Cause Deadly Flooding in Texas. Federal Officials Are Planning to Build It Anyway ‚Äì Texas Monthly https://t.co/reE3bMfnNg		The stupidity of the border wall and the imposition of it upon people along the border who oppose it gets more upsetting daily.
@RepLizCheney We stand ready to work with all members of the incoming 116th Congress on an agenda that improves the lives of children and protects them from harm. (14) https://t.co/S9bndpDy3J
@RepLizCheney Republicans should identify children‚Äôs issues to work on, as they appeal to most Americans, particularly women and younger voters. 		Kids are 1/4 of the population, just 8% of the federal budget, but all of our future. (13) https://t.co/9xOCWf01SX
@RepLizCheney We urge you to take a step back and look at things from a kids‚Äô perspective from time-to-time. 		Our #Champions4Children Scorecard finds women are 2.6 times more likely to be a Champion than men. (12) https://t.co/P4c3dKAFo3
@RepLizCheney The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget point to how the process is even stacked against kids by congressional rules. (11) https://t.co/VyyffDtj78
@RepLizCheney People are deeply disturbed by the idea that federal funding on interest will exceed all federal investments in children by 2020 and that the future is bleak for kids. They also get the double whammy of having the debt passed on to them to pay off. (10) https://t.co/NY0WordE4v
@RepLizCheney On the issue of public schools and student funding, voters repeatedly have rejected vouchers and mass movements have sprung up to defeat legislators that oppose public schools. Oklahoma, for example, just elected 16 educators to its legislature. #RedForEd #InvestInKids (9) https://t.co/zGBVOLN4M5
@RepLizCheney Even on the issue of birthright citizenship, our polls show Americans reject the change proposed by the President by 61-32%. 		Women and younger voters understand this would target and harm one group of people: babies. (8) https://t.co/ECfpf8tCTA
@RepLizCheney On every single issue we have polled, voters overwhelmingly support children‚Äôs issues. Some #Champions4Children in the Republican Party get this and were re-elected with kids a major part of their work, including @RepSteveStivers, @HerreraBeutler, and @RepBrianFitz. (7)
@RepLizCheney By an overwhelming margin, women want federal policy to be governed by a fairly simple ‚Äúbest interest of the child standard.‚Äù 		It is surprising &amp; disappointing how many times in the past two years that the Trump Administration and Congress failed that simple test. #DoNoHarm (6) https://t.co/wUNBp4C63r
@RepLizCheney Women voters strongly oppose family separation and gutting of protections for children seeking asylum. By wide margins, women were turned off by these actions. This was a big issue in two Senate races Democratic women won in the Southwest. (5) https://t.co/oQ3Xo2iMAq
@RepLizCheney Voters overwhelmingly support CHIP. It was the highest polling issue last November (88% of Americans said it was their top priority), but failure to extend it until February frustrated voters and Republicans lost the opportunity to campaign on it despite a 10-year extension. (4) https://t.co/DhcvmOAruS
@RepLizCheney In election eve polling we will soon release, voters opposed cutting and capping Medicaid and strongly support CHIP. 		One of the authors of the Senate‚Äôs Graham-Cassidy-Heller Amendment was slammed for supporting a 31.4% disproportionate cut in children‚Äôs Medicaid funding. (3) https://t.co/byeEv30PE2
@RepLizCheney Our #Champions4Children honorees won in 44 of 45 races (97.8%) during #Election2018. 		Children proved to be a powerful electoral issue on the issues of health care and education, particularly. (2)

@BrxJns Thus, it makes no sense for a Texas legislator to support arbitrary Medicaid caps because it would likely disproportionately harm Texas. Beto gets that. (7)
@BrxJns Texas is one of the fastest growing states in the country, its dependence on oil and gas causes it to suffer from regional recessions, the State gets more than its share of hurricanes and tornadoes, and Texas has been hit by Zika and the polio-like virus in children recently. (6)
@BrxJns There are huge problems with arbitrary Medicaid caps. Let's take block grants, which Cruz supports and Beto opposes. Under a block grant, funding does not adjust for need, including populations changes, economic recessions, public health crises, or natural disasters. (5)
@BrxJns Beto opposed Medicaid cuts. Cruz supported cutting Medicaid by $800 billion, including a version of per capita caps that would have disproportionately cut funding for children's health by 31.4%. (4)
@BrxJns Beto support protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Cruz offered the amendment in the Senate that would have gutted those protections. (3)
@BrxJns Beto supports our nation's teachers, public schools, and students. Cruz wants to turn funding for schools into vouchers. (2)
@BrxJns Sure! That is pretty easy.		Let's just pick children's issues and the Texas race...		Beto O'Rourke supported the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Ted Cruz voted against it in 2015. (1)

@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski I personally love Twitter. But if politicians generate campaigns to promote themselves and their funders, where are we? Does it require groups like mine to have to engage in our own campaigns like this? 		If so, Twitter becomes a giant ad war and lost is what makes it great. (10)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski As an advocate for children, I was glad to see teachers, parents, health care providers, and child advocates bring up issues related to education and health care.		But campaign-generated tweets that were campaign-generated swamped these stories. That poses a dilemma? (9)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski So should they be regulated or disclosed? Maybe Twitter should require disclosure when tweets are generated by 3rd parties as a campaign?		I am not sure. But in the meantime, we need to call it out so people are aware of what they are seeing and discount it as they see fit. (8)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski There is a reason why we make the purchaser of campaign ads disclose who they are, including the candidates themselves (‚ÄúI approve this message‚Äù).		These tweets are very similar to campaign-generated ads. (7)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski I also raised questions about the content of the tweets. These Cruz campaign-generated tweets were all written by him/for him with accompanying content associated with people that give him a ton of money. People should also be aware of that. (6)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski And finally, as was crowd checked, many of the accounts associated with the Cruz tweets have been flagged as fake accounts or bots.		Obviously, we have been having a huge conversation about that in this country. (5)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski I would also point out that it is likely it was a paid political campaign, which is far different than tweets posted by individual citizens.		I would assume consultants were also paid to do this since the Cruz campaign showed they can‚Äôt even do Facebook Live properly. (4)

@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski That was what I was calling out. 		The purpose of these identical campaign-generated  tweets was to flood the hashtag of the debate. Like petitions to Capitol Hill, mass identical tweets should be called out and discounted. (3)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski This is not that.		These tweets are drafted by Team Cruz to simply support him, which is a very different thing. The tweets could not be modified or tailored. The ‚Äúperson‚Äù (if a person &amp; not a fake account) agrees and the tweets are campaign-generated. (2)
@SeekingSkeptic @JDubs @KyleKulinski Advocacy groups typically create sample tweets for people to raise awareness to an issue. Individuals cut and paste them or modify them to personalize them. (1)
