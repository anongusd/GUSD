In the last year, the Trump Administration has turned its back on tens of thousands of #TPS recipients from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Nepal. Now, Trump has ended protections for Honduras.	 	This ‚Äúimmigration‚Äù agenda is blatantly racist. #SaveTPS https://t.co/hsFv604J3M
1 year ago, @HouseGOP passed #Trumpcare. While they didn‚Äôt succeed in turning it into law, they've managed to undermine the promise of health care for millions nonetheless. 	 	In fact, 2017 was the first year since #ACA enactment that uninsured rates went up. What a disgrace.

Republicans are not the party of ‚Äúfamily values.‚Äù There‚Äôs no value in policies that lead to more hunger, more homelessness and more desperation. Make no mistake: the only families helped by @HouseGOP policies are named Koch and Mercer.

And we can‚Äôt forget @HouseGOP‚Äôs current #1 agenda item --- a Farm Bill that will gut food stamp programs and make America‚Äôs food insecurity crisis even worse.  	https://t.co/IF8dOCNRi5
So, to recap, the Republicans‚Äô plan to fight poverty is preventing low-income women from accessing contraception, banning abortions, refusing to raise the minimum wage, and then undermining affordable housing programs.
And only 1 in 5 families who qualify for federal housing assistance actually receive it. Meanwhile, @HUDgov @SecretaryCarson wants to triple the cost of housing for some of the poorest families in the United States.	https://t.co/ZEyPLTybDo
Right now, there isn‚Äôt a county in America where a single parent working full time for minimum wage can reasonably afford a 2 bedroom apartment. 	https://t.co/Gi1w4iQ4yC
I don‚Äôt know if @SpeakerRyan is aware of this, but children are expensive to raise. It‚Äôs impossible enough to survive on a minimum wage for one person, let alone feed, house &amp; clothe a whole family on a poverty salary.
If Republicans want to fight poverty, one of the best investments we can make is in family planning. But instead they‚Äôre choosing to gut #TitleX &amp; take away women‚Äôs health options.
Reading about these attacks on #TitleX ‚Äì a historically BIPARTISAN program ‚Äì I am honestly stunned by @HouseGOP‚Äôs hypocrisy. Title X programs help women stay healthy, plan their families, &amp; rise out of poverty. https://t.co/jjT7TPXaLW

We must #resist Tom Price‚Äôs extreme agenda at HHS. Health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the wealthy few.
At 2am @SenateGOP confirmed an HHS Sec who wants to gut the ACA, legislate women‚Äôs bodies &amp; may have profited from insider info in Congress.
People of conscience across the US reject Trump Admin's hateful #MuslimBan ‚Äì glad 9th circuit upheld the stay &amp; reaffirmed #RefugeesWelcome.
Donald Trump said he hasn‚Äôt received a single call opposing #DAPL. We know that‚Äôs not true. Time for the people to show him how wrong he is.
The American ppl have rejected the #DAPL. We must demand that the govt respects the will of the people! #WaterIsLife https://t.co/8NTe3rt2RY

I will oppose any attempt by AG Sessions, the Justice Department &amp; the Administration to turn back the clock on our constitutional rights.
The confirmation of Senator Sessions  is outrageous and appalling. Senate Republicans betrayed the cause of justice &amp; civil rights tonight.

As a black woman, I have felt the pain of prejudice. These experiences compel me to resist the Trump Admin‚Äôs morally bankrupt #MuslimBan. https://t.co/USJuWUTAuu
Americans are the last line of #resistance to this dangerous agenda. Don't get disheartened or apathetic. We need you now more than ever.
Then today, Pres. Trump halted critical fiduciary rule that prevents Wall Street from gambling with working families‚Äô retirement security.
Last night, lacking any real facts, Kellyanne Conway fabricated Bowling Green Massacre to rationalize Trump‚Äôs un-American, cruel #MuslimBan.
To recap: in the last few days, President Trump has set off major diplomatic fiascoes with France, Australia, Mexico and Iran.
It‚Äôs safe to say that the first two weeks of the Trump Administration have been a complete &amp; utter disaster. https://t.co/6QdIvDYctH

On 1st day of #BlackHistoryMonth, GOP Senators on Judiciary voted unanimously for Jeff Sessions‚Äô AG nomination. This is a slap in the face.
President Trump: if you truly want to honor #BlackHistoryMonth, you should start by apologizing to civil rights hero @repjohnlewis.
Here‚Äôs an idea @POTUS : Instead of offering lip service this #BlackHistoryMonth, why not work with @OfficialCBC to end systematic racism?
Trump says he‚Äôs ‚Äúhonoring‚Äù #BlackHistoryMonth. How? By nominating Jeff Sessions as AG? Or by promoting alt-right leader Steve Bannon?
Judge Neil Gorsuch‚Äôs history of opposing women‚Äôs rights and civil rights should disqualify him from serving on the Supreme Court.
