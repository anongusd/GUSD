If this sounds like you or if you‚Äôre a town idiot; put down your media device,&amp;educate yourself on reality. Media can sway emotions to love one another&amp; bring peace to the world,however,it‚Äôs a boring story no one seems to be interested in. Stop hating because someone told you to.
Media creates fear &amp; hate. This is why we have the town idiot(town idiot:a monster in its own category) that kills, harms,fires employees,refuses to do right,ignores or hates people of a certain race, sex, gender,or whatever your special birth issue is.
What kind of racist are you?Whites:Everyone thinks we are‚Äùprivileged‚Äù,&amp;hate us.

@Beckiwadderz @rustyrockets With addiction,You really need to know what animal you are dealing with. You must realize,1. You cannot control an addict. 2. An addict is self serving &amp; is not interested in your drama. 3. Addicts have large egos to compensate for the reality they are running from.

UNITED means to join together. You live in THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. American people need to UNITE; NOT separate, divide,categorize, stereotype,disect, split, cut up, bisect,half quarter, diverge, part, or classify other American people. Are you an UNITED American?
@TheView Maybe Trump is getting tired.
I don‚Äôt think we should erase genders of man or woman. Add;don‚Äôt erase. Media makes you believe that it‚Äôs only one way. There are bad people in every sex,gender,race, who hate or attack. Don‚Äôt fuel hate with hate and outrage. Extinguish hate with intelligence and understanding.
In retrospect. Sighs
