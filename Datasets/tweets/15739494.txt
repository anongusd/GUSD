Again, all 10 Dems who voted in March to table the resolution cutting U.S. aid to the #SaudiArabia  war in #Yemen flipped 2day, &amp; 9 Rs flipped, too, and flouted @realDonaldTrump : Graham, Alexander, Corker, Cassidy, Flake, Murkowski, Portman, Toomey and Young.
RT @mkraju: A major rebuke to the WH just hours after Pompeo and Mattis try to convince senators to keep supporting the Saudi war in Yemen.‚Ä¶
Final #Senate vote was 63-37 in favor of continuing the debate (next week) on cutting off most U.S. military aid to the #Saudi war in #Yemen .
#Senate in March, had voted 55-44 to block the measure ending most U.S. aid to #SaudiArabia-led war in #Yemen. The #KhashoggiMurder and civilian casualties in Yemen changed that. All 10 Dems who had voted to table the measure then supported it today, plus lots of Rs.
The #Senate, in an ongoing procedural vote, is poised to overwhelmingly agree to allow floor debate (probably next week) on a measure that would end most U.S. military aid to #SaudiArabia's war in #Yemen--a milestone sign of U.S. disaffection with the Saudi regime.
Bipartisan #Senate statements of criticism are starting to flow in against #Russia for its actions in the Sea of Azov. Democrats are hitting not only Russia but also @realDonaldTrump for his lack of comment on Russia's actions.
Three #Senate Dems--@RonWyden, @SenJackReed and @MartinHeinrich--are proposing legislation that would require the Director of National Intelligence (@ODNIgov) to give Congress an UNclassified report on who is responsible for the #KhashoggiMurder, including who ordered it.

@AaronMehta Maybe the deal wasn't there to be made---I don't know. The upshot is we don't appear to have the closer we need. Hope I'm wrong.
@AaronMehta And sometimes you have to part with some prospects when your window for winning may be narrowing. We had a few to part with.
@AaronMehta They got two good arms from the As. They needed a legit closer. Some were available, though, yes, the odds were vs Nats getting a few.
Britton, Wilson, Ramos, Iglesias. Or a starter who could relieve in the postseason. You need a better "better question." :) https://t.co/RWn2d2cXkY

Less than one strikeout per inning. Not "really good" for a team looking for a shutdown closer. https://t.co/0Tp2ZCpyer
