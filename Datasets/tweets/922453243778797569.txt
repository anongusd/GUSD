@Fighthypocrisy @mariebuteau35 @JbthomJohn @ananavarro Not true. It's because of his failures &amp; lack of success not his color. Many white ppl voted for him in large numbers in hopes we all could move forward and becuz he seemed capable.
@ananavarro We give you permission to stay....see like you and your family....there's many of us here in America struggling but you call us racists, deplorables, etc.. just because we voted for this President. It's shameful!! You should guard ur mouth b4 speaking for a majority of ppl
@ananavarro Ana you live in a bubble.... I'd love for you to talk to my mixed family and get a real perspective....@RickSantorum you couldn't be more right....O failed miserably.
@mariebuteau35 @Fighthypocrisy @JbthomJohn @ananavarro So how do you respond to all the black ppl that voted against Obama?
@CrisPijuanCasis @Fighthypocrisy @ananavarro @JbthomJohn Not spot on....
@Fighthypocrisy @ananavarro @JbthomJohn I voted for Obama...I'm white and my spouse is black. We have have grown children and young grandchildren. Our family has similar family units. We all agree Obama failed. Mixed relations is our life. We live it everyday. He caused major divide
@ananavarro I agree with @RickSantorum......Obama did exacerbate racism...
@thehill @RickSantorum I couldn't agree w/u more. Myself &amp; other family members r of mixed marriages &amp; we agree we've never seen such division. We were O voters but he failed.Never blue again. The red has done well but it's the blue that convinced us to never vote Dem again. Hateful ppl.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich Voting so red it looks orange. As far right as I can vote.Used 2b blue but never again. NEVER! I'll walk neighborhoods, make calls, raise/donate $$, educate, give rides 2 the polls, &amp; babysit while parents/friends/family votes. I'll do my part but never blue! Nasty bunch of folks

Robert Mueller selectively handed this indictment down to change the media headlines of uranium 1 that he knew about as fbi director
Don't trust Robert Mueller. He needs to resign. I'm sure while acting as fbi director he knew about the uranium 1 deal with Hillary.
Robert Mueller was FBI director while this uranium 1 deal happened. He needs to resign. @PaulManafort indictment was to change the narrative
FACT @HillaryClinton &amp; the @DNC funded the dossier. Sold our uranium. This indictment today was selectively released. Fire Robert Mueller
