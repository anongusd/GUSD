@ladygaga you may not like my politics but I implore you to use your platform to bring us all together. You have that ability. Appreciate we may disagree on politics but all of us love talent. As a conservative I LOVE you and your talent is 2nd to none. Take that in please.
@ladygaga Loved it!!! You are a great performer and a very good actress. Embrace this. Hard core conservative here. Never mind politics. U r amazing.
@ladygaga just saw A Star is Born. You are incredibly talented. Loved the movie. You are amazing. I hope u appreciate that I‚Äôm a fan of @realDonaldTrump. That aside. I‚Äôm a fan of that movie. Just know you have fans across the spectrum. Embrace it.

Great speech. And to all you whack job liberal snowflakes, she has ZERO proof. ZERO evidence. So that puts Kavanaugh having to prove a negative. In other words you want him to prove his innocence. Instead of being innocent until proven guilty. Kinda proves liberals r idiots. https://t.co/1b5XYbBTqV
@EdKrassen Not disgusting at all. No doubt Ford suffered an incident but she has no proof. So it was a bit funny. The upstairs downstairs comment was in reference to her changing testimony on the house layout. Simple as that.
@ShannonBream @fbi had all info they needed after she testified under oath. Their job was to corroborate her story. My guess is FBI found NOTHING.
