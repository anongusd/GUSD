As a senior member of @AppropsDems, I’m concerned about protecting the spending power of Congress. And as an American, I’m really concerned about the constitutionality of this kind of declaration, as it threatens one of the core pillars of our republic: the separation of powers.
The president's emergency declaration is not a smart move. Democrats and Republicans worked hard to reach a bipartisan deal to keep our government open, one that would strengthen and invest in border security in effective ways.

The #ElderProtectionandAbusePreventionAct would expand the federal definition of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
For every case of senior abuse reported, 23 cases of abuse go unnoticed. #ElderProtectionandAbusePreventionAct
14.1% of all non-institutionalized seniors have experienced abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation. #ElderProtectionandAbusePreventionAct
My #ElderProtectionandAbusePreventionAct would require all states to incorporate standardized elder abuse screening and reporting protocols.
The #ElderProtectionandAbusePreventionAct aims to strengthen the federal definitions for elder abuse, neglect and exploitation.

On Labor Day, we honor all the men &amp; women who built this country &amp; keep our economy running. Working people are the backbone of our nation.
...but by the content of their character.  I have a dream today! #MOW50
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin.. #MOW50
...sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. #MOW50
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice... #MOW50
...will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. #MOW50
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners... #MOW50
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." #MOW50
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed... #MOW50
&amp; so even though we face the difficulties of today &amp; tomorrow I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream #MOW50
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends. #MOW50
...go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. #MOW50
Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana... #MOW50
You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. #MOW50
...quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. #MOW50
Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest... #MOW50
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. #MOW50
No, no, we are not satisfied, &amp; we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream #MOW50
and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. #MOW50
by signs stating: "For Whites Only." We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote... #MOW50
We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity... #MOW50
...is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. #MOW50
...of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility... #MOW50
We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels... #MOW50
We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. #MOW50
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" #MOW50
We cannot turn back. #MOW50
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. #MOW50
We cannot walk alone. #MOW50
...is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. #MOW50
...for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny... #MOW50
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people... #MOW50
Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. #MOW50
We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. #MOW50
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. #MOW50
Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. #MOW50
In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. #MOW50
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice... #MOW50
The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. #MOW50
And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. #MOW50
...and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. #MOW50
Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam... #MOW50
This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom &amp; equality #MOW50
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. #MOW50
Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children. #MOW50
Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. #MOW50
Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. #MOW50
Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. #MOW50
This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. #MOW50
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. #MOW50
...a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. #MOW50
And so, we've come to cash this check... #MOW50
We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. #MOW50
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. #MOW50
Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, which has come back marked "insufficient funds."
It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. #MOW50
...of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." #MOW50
This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights"... #MOW50
...they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. #MOW50
When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence... #MOW50
And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. #MOW50
One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. #MOW50
One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. #MOW50
100 years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. #MOW50
It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. #MOW50
This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice #MOW50
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. #mow50
Iam happy to join w/ you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation #MOW50
Today, we celebrate the life and legacy of generations of American women, on this, the 93rd anniversary of #WomensEqualityDay!
