Committee Republicans are making no effort to find truth. They are failing their Constitutional responsibilities by covering up the corruption of a sitting President. What is happening to the soul &amp; integrity of the once storied Republican Party?  https://t.co/auulqGwrbE
You shame yourself &amp; the Office of the Presidency every time you try to smear those who dedicate their lives to public service. These elected officials, like so many others, have worked selflessly on behalf of their fellow citizens, something unfamiliar to one as selfish as you. https://t.co/zqAIofpjSc
Quite unfortunately, and dangerously, Kim Jong-un has schooled Mr. Trump in the “Art of the Dupe.”  https://t.co/tJo41Ye7io
Senate Intel Committee is doing good work, but it does not conduct criminal investigations. It is up to Special Counsel to charge those who criminally conspired with Russia. Don’t conflate collusion, which occured, with criminal conspiracy. Stay tuned. https://t.co/I0yXofGd9I
Your refusal to accept the unanimous assessment of U.S. Intelligence on Iran, No. Korea, ISIS, Russia, &amp; so much more shows the extent of your intellectual bankruptcy. All Americans, especially members of Congress, need to understand the danger you pose to our national security. https://t.co/9iV3BTKiEv
Your cabal of unprincipled, unethical, dishonest, and sycophantic cronies is being methodically brought to justice. We all know where this trail leads. If your utter incompetence is not enough to run you out of office, your increasingly obvious political corruption surely will. https://t.co/S6DMeGICXZ
Pithy, pointed, &amp; perfect advice to Mr. Trump: “Resign.” https://t.co/YO4B34bINm
Questions Congress should ask the American translator in Helsinki: Were written notes passed between Mr. Trump &amp; Mr. Putin? Did Mr. Trump ask Mr. Putin to conceal anything about the past? Were any promises made? Were you asked to step aside at any time?  https://t.co/Lawnfa2FTN
Article One of the Constitution, which established the Legislative Branch, does not say Congress is subservient to the President (especially an unstable, unfit, &amp; reckless one). Congress must do its job—fund the government, end the shutdown, &amp; then negotiate border security. https://t.co/hXPRteoLzi
It is my sincere hope that the forthcoming exposure of your malfeasance &amp; corruption will convince enough Republicans to abandon you in 2019. We have had enough of your whining from the White House. We need an actual leader—our Nation’s future is at stake. https://t.co/dNzRGuOFdP
Brett worked extremely hard over many years to ensure the US fulfilled its leadership role in a critically important part of the world. Like Sec. Mattis, Brett believes in the principles, values, &amp; partnerships that define America. Donald Trump does not.  https://t.co/iiOwRlXA28
Okay, Republicans. How much longer are you going to let this farcical “presidency” continue? At a time of such political, economic, and geo-strategic turbulence—both nationally and globally—are you waiting for a catastrophe to happen before acting? Disaster looms! https://t.co/9IdC6qXwtK
This wrong-headed decision is but one example of how dangerous it is for our national security to be controlled by Mr. Trump’s impulsive and self-satisfying “gut.” He is surrendering America’s role on the world stage. Republicans who make excuses for him enable these actions. https://t.co/HPponW8pRB
Whenever you send out such inane tweets, I take great solace in knowing that you realize how much trouble you are in &amp; how impossible it will be for you to escape American justice. Mostly, I am relieved that you will never have the opportunity to run for public office again. https://t.co/JzB6YH8C6H
As a former Director of CIA, President George H.W. Bush is a revered figure among past &amp; present members of CIA’s family. Accordingly, previous Directors &amp; Deputy Directors of CIA issued a joint statement of respect, admiration, and appreciation for his selfless public service. https://t.co/vV9il2A8tn
George H.W. Bush led a life of exemplary public service, integrity, and determination—in WWII, in Congress, as UN Ambassador, Envoy to China, CIA Director, and as Vice President &amp; President. A life very well lived; an American who made us all proud. May he rest in eternal peace.
The iceberg of lies, deceit, corruption, &amp; criminality is steadily but surely surfacing, despite the efforts of many in high places to keep it submerged. How large is the iceberg &amp; who will be found clinging to it? The wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine. https://t.co/yeMZiWTlVM
Your feelings of inferiority, insecurity, vulnerability, and culpability are loud &amp; clear. You remind me of how many corrupt authoritarian leaders abroad behaved before they were deposed. Bob Mueller’s name will be revered in the annals of U.S. history; your name will be scorned. https://t.co/aYnYetwJV1
Michael Hayden is one of this country’s noblest patriots, dedicating his life to America’s national security. A man of tremendous integrity, intellect, &amp; decency, he has been a role model for countless intelligence professionals over several decades. Speedy recovery, Mike. https://t.co/b3IyAlbJf8
On this special day, I give thanks for all Americans who honorably serve and protect our Country as well as those who bravely speak out against injustice, lies, prejudice, &amp; sexual assault. I very much look forward to future Thanksgivings when we will come together as one Nation.
Since Mr. Trump excels in dishonesty, it is now up to members of Congress to obtain &amp; declassify the CIA findings on Jamal Khashoggi’s death. No one in Saudi Arabia—most especially the Crown Prince—should escape accountability for such a heinous act. https://t.co/exQrZKybhk
You constantly remind us how substantively shallow &amp; dishonest you are on so many fronts, which is why we are in such dangerous times. You would need an extremely tall ladder to get anywhere near the level of intellect, competence &amp; integrity of Bill McRaven &amp; your predecessors. https://t.co/uW95ZALUZ7
Trudeau, Macron, Merkel...it is so refreshing to see principled leaders saying &amp; doing the right things...for their countries as well as for global peace &amp; stability. I miss the days when American Presidents, while never perfect, were respected for their honesty &amp; integrity. https://t.co/6ylCDH8ETP
Opportunity to repudiate @realDonaldTrump &amp; to restore Congressional ability to thwart his recklessness &amp; fear mongering arrives tomorrow. Vote for individuals who represent the best of America.  In this election, those who stand with Trump must be defeated. Vote!
My former CIA colleagues Elissa Slotkin in Michigan’s 8th District &amp; Abagail Spanberger in Virginia’s 7th District will bring needed common sense, experience, &amp; wisdom to Congress. They will help derail the Trump train, bring bipartisanship to Washington, &amp; deserve your vote.
As a former resident of Texas and a proud UT-Austin alumnus, I believe Beto O’Rourke is the type of individual Texans need in the U.S. Senate to represent their best interests. He has the integrity, intellect, and character that is in short supply in Congress. Vote!
As the child of an immigrant, I will vote for candidates who believe in America living up to its values &amp; remaining the world’s melting pot. I will vote for individuals who are honest, have integrity, reject inflammatory rhetoric &amp; want to bring us together. Vote your conscience!
Stop blaming others. Look in the mirror. Your inflammatory rhetoric, insults, lies, &amp; encouragement of physical violence are disgraceful. Clean up your act....try to act Presidential. The American people deserve much better. BTW, your critics will not be intimidated into silence. https://t.co/cS5qNiuU7o
Jamal Khashoggi’s apparent death at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul is an atrocity, and Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman’s close ties to the White House must not stand in the way of a full and forceful U.S. response. https://t.co/XTonCQic7i
It is impossible to overstate @realDonaldTrump’s corrosive impact on our political culture &amp; national character. Rejection of his demagoguery, his lies, and the politics of fear espoused by McConnell &amp; Graham is at hand. If you want to make a difference, vote!!!
Key takeaways this week: Dr. Ford is a national treasure; Sen. Jeff Flake is an admirable man with a conscience, while craven politician Lindsey Graham is not; Kavanaugh’s temperament and blatant partisanship are disqualifying of a Supreme Court seat.
Any attempt by the White House to subvert or manipulate law enforcement should be resisted. Rather than resigning, officials should stand their ground &amp; wait to be fired. Resisting abuse of presidential authority is not a policy difference; it’s about adhering to the rule of law.
It’s neither illegal nor a witch hunt. Thankfully, most Americans have confidence in Bob Mueller &amp; believe in legitimacy of investigation.  Irrespective of party, all should accept Mueller’s findings as apolitical, whether they ascribe probable guilt or innocence to you &amp; others. https://t.co/iYg7Wdn28t
Colin Kaepernick drew our collective attention to the problem of continued racial injustice in America. He did so not to disrespect our flag but to give meaning to the words of the preamble of our Constitution—“in order to form a more perfect union.” Well done, Colin, well done. https://t.co/4ALyUxLjM5
America is respected when our political leaders make decisions that enhance global peace, security, &amp; prosperity.  No amount of bluster, false bravado, &amp; self promotion brings respect. Untold millions wait for American values to run through the veins of those entrusted to lead. https://t.co/7torif1wBP
A man of tremendous courage, patriotism, and integrity, Senator John McCain will be remembered by history as one of our country’s greatest heroes. His life of service and his strong decency and respect toward others should serve as a shining example for all Americans.
I take no delight in seeing the steady collapse of a U.S. Presidency, but I do take strong comfort in knowing that the rule of law &amp; our great government institutions are prevailing. Things ultimately will get better, and we will heal as a Nation.
This action is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to suppress freedom of speech &amp; punish critics.  It should gravely worry all Americans, including intelligence professionals, about the cost of speaking out. My principles are worth far more than clearances. I will not relent. https://t.co/TNzOxhP9ux
It’s astounding how often you fail to live up to minimum standards of decency, civility, &amp; probity. Seems like you will never understand what it means to be president, nor what it takes to be a good, decent, &amp; honest person. So disheartening, so dangerous for our Nation. https://t.co/eI9HaCec1m
You’re absolutely right. If you were “presidential,” you would focus on healing the rifts within our Nation, being truthful about the challenges we face, &amp; showing the world that America is still that shining beacon of freedom, liberty, prosperity, &amp; goodness that welcomes all. https://t.co/zRHRYAFEAo
What responsible &amp; right-thinking adult can point to @realDonaldTrump as a role model for our youth? Whenever he spews lies, insults, and polarizing hate speech against fellow Americans, think of its harmful impact on our young people and the way they talk, act, &amp; treat others. https://t.co/S8sPpydvt9
Individuals of conscience who believe in rule of law should denounce this blatant effort to obstruct justice. As Mr. Trump’s desperation to protect himself grows, he could turn words into actions, prompting a Constitutional crisis. Congress must warn Trump of dire consequences. https://t.co/VUU9M2WcYZ
Using tariffs as a blunt force instrument against allies and partners is not only short-sighted but also plays into the hands of Russia and China. Same is true with bombastic rhetoric against Iran. We need to be smarter, more sophisticated, more strategic. https://t.co/bMMwsWCR2y
Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to &amp; exceeds the threshold of “high crimes &amp; misdemeanors.” It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???
Why did Trump meet 1 on 1 with Putin? What might he be hiding from Bolton, Pompeo, Kelly, &amp; the American public? How will Putin use whatever Trump could be hiding to advantage Russia &amp; hurt America? Trump’s total lack of credibility renders spurious whatever explanation he gives.
Watching the spectacle of the House “hearing” with Peter Strzok today, I was reminded of the words of Abraham Lincoln: 		“America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves.”
It is in the interest of America’s security if NATO leaders push back against the reckless behavior of Donald Trump, who is dangerously naive &amp; grossly ignorant of how the world works. History inevitably will regard Trump as one of the most disastrous figures of the 21st century. https://t.co/vZYbOSblwo
You are to governance &amp; politics what Bernie Madoff was to the stock market &amp; investment advice.

As we mark the 242nd year of our great Nation’s birth, let us remember the words of our 1st President, George Washington:		“The bosom of America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable Stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all Nations and Religions.” 🇺🇸

When the Special Counsel’s work is done, the Republican Party must have its modern-day equivalents of Watergate heroes—Howard Baker, Elliot Richardson, Bill Ruckleshaus, John Dean—who will put country, fellow citizens, &amp; the law above any one person, including @realDonaldTrump.
Your fear of exposure is palpable. Your desperation even more so. When will those of conscience among your Cabinet, inner circle, and Republican leadership realize that your unprincipled and unethical behavior as well as your incompetence are seriously damaging our Nation. https://t.co/n6ivjOYxzo
A most important message from two very honorable people.... https://t.co/lqTa5GDL9D
It is the height of irony that the U.S. is withdrawing from UN Human Rights Council when the Trump Administration is perpetrating such cruel human rights abuses involving children on our border. The Trump Administration is ruining America’s reputation for compassion &amp; justice. https://t.co/5gBqw0sqld
All Americans—not just your supporters—deserve a President who is honest, ethical, selfless, &amp; substantive. Our country faces daunting domestic &amp; international challenges.

Your wrong-headed protectionist policies &amp; antics are damaging our global standing as well as our national interests. Your worldview does not represent American ideals.

“Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error.”		Marcus Tullius Cicero, (106-43 BC)
Deaths in Gaza result of utter disregard of Messers Trump &amp; Netanyahu for Palestinian rights &amp; homeland. By moving Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump played politics, destroyed US peacemaker role. New generation of Israelis/Palestinians need to isolate extremists to find path to peace.
Today, Donald Trump simultaneously lied about the Iranian nuclear deal, undermined global confidence in US commitments, alienated our closest allies, strengthened Iranian hawks, &amp; gave North Korea more reason to keep its nukes. This madness is a danger to our national security.
Senators: Show that you put country above politics. Gina Haspel is a competent, experienced, &amp; highly qualified intelligence professional. Ask her tough questions, listen to her answers, &amp; then decide but don’t penalize her for previous policy decisions or because DT picked her.
Mr. Trump: Your hypocrisy knows no bounds. Jim Clapper is a man of integrity, honesty, ethics, &amp; morality. You are not. Jim Clapper served his country for over a half century, including in Vietnam. You did not. By your words &amp; behavior, you diminish the Office of the Presidency. https://t.co/bYlmZInDoM
A highly partisan, incomplete, and deeply flawed report by a broken House Committee means nothing.

I served 6 Presidents, 3 Rs &amp; 3Ds. I directly supported Clinton, Bush 43, and Obama.

Leadership of House Intel Committee has traded last vestige of integrity for politics. With other investigative shoes yet to drop, legislators who try to protect @realDonaldTrump will face November reckoning. Hopefully, bipartisan effort in Senate Intel Committee will endure...

Your simple minded policies--imposition of tariffs--have the potential to seriously damage our future prosperity. https://t.co/pjhSKcmSdV
@realDonaldTrump This tweet is a great example of your paranoia, constant misrepresentation of the facts, and increased anxiety and panic (rightly so) about the Mueller investigation. When will those in Congress and the 30 percent of Americans who still support you realize you are a charlatan?
I greatly admire the courageous Parkland students. Open discussion on how to end mass shootings essential. @realdonaldtrump needs to listen, absorb, and act. Stronger background checks, ban on bump stocks &amp; assault weapons, and better ability to identify warning signs are key.
It never ceases to amaze me how successful you have been making yourself so small, petty, and banal with your tweets. Your insecurity is well deserved, as is your concern over Russia investigation. Thomas Paine was right when he said, "These are the times that try men's souls." https://t.co/EfaDBlYejF
DOJ statement and indictments reveal the extent and motivations of Russian interference in 2016 election. Claims of a “hoax” in tatters. My take: Implausible that Russian actions did not influence the views and votes of at least some Americans.
Having worked international counterterrorism for much of my career, it is imperative that we devote equal energy and effort to addressing the scourge of gun violence in our country. Congress needs to act now to prevent access to semiautomatic weapons that kill innocents.
I had many fights with Congressional Dems over the years on national security matters. But I never witnessed the type of reckless partisan behavior I am now seeing from Nunes and House Republicans.

Ample basis exists to enact legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller from political interference. Irrespective of party in power, US strength rests on ability to safeguard rule of law, even at times of deep partisan rancor. Let investigative chips fall where they may.
