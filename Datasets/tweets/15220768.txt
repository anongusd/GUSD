Why you focus on terminology rather than what happened is puzzling. That’s what Trump has tried to do. Define this scandal as only about direct collusion between him and Russia on the hack-and-dumps. Looks like you’re adopting his line.
And I wouldn’t argue with anyone who called Trump’s purposeful echoing of Russia’s false denial a form of collusion.
Sending a signal to Moscow that the campaign won’t mind secret Russian intervention to assist Trump.
The issue seemed to be (for you) Cohen’s statement that he was unaware of direct collusion between Trump and Russia. But certainly Trump’s top aides agreed to work with a secret Kremlin effort to help Trump’s campaign. That sure sounds like colluding—even if it’s only....
Sad you play word games. The issue is Trump and his gang abiding by and abetting a Russian attack on democracy. And yes, Manafort colluded with Russian interests. And George Pap tried to set up back channel to Putin’s office while Kremlin was intervening in US election. https://t.co/cXgbma9Oxx
And I've noted that with the Trump Tower meeting and other statements/actions, the Trump crew signaled to the Kremlin, explicitly or not, that they were okay with Russian intervention in the election. But show me where I have claimed that Trump colluded directly in the attack?
You're not playing this straight. I have said for almost two years aiding and abetting is as important as the collusion issue. So that means, no GPM (goal post moving). And the collusion I have said that is confirmed is colluding with the coverup. Be honest. https://t.co/6CmYyfvQLb

To dream the impossible dream….To boldly go where no man has gone.
Another line in Trump's prepared text: "A second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau [Dah-kow] Concentration Camp."		Yes, his aides fear he doesn't know how to pronounce Dachau.
Imagine what Fox News would have said if Barack Obama had announced he wanted to negotiate with the Taliban and believed it wanted peace.
Line coming up in Trump's SOTU: "We have not yet BEGUN TO DREAM." 		Can we factcheck that?
In case you don't believe me, this is how this sentence appears in the prepared text. Trump's speechwriters didn't think he could pronounce "Guaido" correctly. https://t.co/aUkRxpIlut
This is nuts: "If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."

"We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution." Read this: 	https://t.co/ynNF2rOedm

5. Rather amusing you care so passionately about Russian subversion (and American involvement in that) before we were born but not about Putin's efforts to subvert a recent election to help Trump win the White House—and Trump's collaboration in the Kremlin's coverup.
4. Using opposition to Putin to justify a stance regarding Venezuela is a joke, if you're supporting a president who has aided and abetted Putin's attack on America and who has sided with Putin over his own intelligence experts.
3. Before you start demanding anyone say this or that about what happened with Russia 50 years ago *or* about what to do regarding Venezuela vis a vis Moscow, you really should come to terms with your own embrace of a fellow who dumps on US allies and smiles adoringly at Putin.
2. ...a president who repeatedly has echoed &amp; amplified Putin's disinformation that Moscow did not attack the 2016 US election, and a president whose campaign was chaired by a fellow interacting with an alleged Russian intelligence asset *and* a Putin-friendly oligarch?

Credit to @SenatorLeahy for noting that Barr recommended that GHW Bush pardon Iran-contra criminals convicted by an independent counsel. (And Bush lied to cover up his own role in the scandal.) This should disqualify Barr, period.
Barr: "I believe the Russians attempted to interfere in the election...and we have to get to the bottom of it." Attempted? Why did he say "attempted"? They did interfere.
Barr: "unimaginable to me" that Mueller would do anything that would provide cause for his dismissal. He adds, the "overwhelming public interest is to allow him to finish." How can @realDonaldTrump accept this?
William Barr says that in a private meeting he told @realDonaldTrump Robert Mueller is a "straight shooter." Trump didn't heed that. So why would Trump hire a fellow who believes a "witch hunt" is not a witch hunt? Why would Barr work for a man who demonizes a straight shooter?

A bottom line from yesterday: both @realDonaldTrump AND the Trump Organization implicated in:	1) criminal activity (violating campaign finance law to make a hush-money payoff);	2) unidentifiable “Russia-related matters core” to Mueller’s investigation. 		Note “matters”-plural.
My point exactly. https://t.co/a2TUqavkzh

Please stop lying. You colluded w/ Putin’s office on a secret business deal. Your campaign signaled the Kremlin it would conspire w/ a secret Moscow plot to help you.

Hey, @realDonaldTrump, it is about Russia—and was always about Russia (except, of course, the hush-money payments for the porn star and Playboy model).

Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
I've always said this was the most under-covered--and a most under-appreciated--element of the Trump-Russia scandal. Cohen (and Trump?) knew it was important to lie about this and downplay the deal....I'll have a piece up on this soon.
And he also must have known that if he criticized Putin in public it would put this deal in jeopardy....Trump was double-dealing--claiming he was an America First candidate, while secretly seeking Putin's help for a venture in Moscow.
And Trump certainly knew he should not reveal that the Trump Organization had asked Putin's office for help moving the deal forward.
By covering up his relationship with Sater, Trump was covering up his ongoing deal in Moscow. Trump was smart enough to know that it sure would hurt him politically if he revealed he was doing a Moscow deal while running for an office.
In "Russian Roulette," @Isikoff &amp; I noted that when Trump denied in 12/15 that he knew Felix Sater it was one of the most significant lies of the 2016 campaign--because that was Trump keeping secret the Moscow deal, which obviously could not proceed if Putin was against it.

Presumably, he is doing the same thing for the dozens of House Democratic candidates who were elected as a rebuke to Trump. (Does God only care about US elections in presidential years?) https://t.co/YEetIYQqZM
Rep. Jerry Nadler, the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has instructed Trump admin. officials to preserve documents related to the Sessions resignation. https://t.co/RKqNwpizpA
Remember, Trump has repeatedly said he thought Sessions as AG should protect him, as if that is the AG's job. So when he picks a new AG, Trump will presumably have that in mind, just as House Ds are considering probes, US attorneys are investigating Cohen &amp; other Trump matters.
Trump says if he did more press conferences, the media would say, "What's wrong?"	Narrator is in a drunken stupor.
Trump on the midterm results: "I am extraordinarily happy.”	Narrator: 	There is no narrator. He left the building to get a drink.
Trump: "I think I am a great moral leader."	Narrator: [Leaves the building.]
Trump is asked about hate crimes in the US. He responds by boasting that he moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Really.
Trump on the Dems winning the House: "I really believe there will be much less gridlock.” So that means the GOP was responsible for gridlock?
Trump on the midterms: "I thought it was a very close to complete victory.” 	Narrator: [Shakes his head.]
Trump says Mueller investigation should not have been launched: "There was no crime." Uh, how many crimes have been charged and proven? Ask Manafort, Flynn, Papadopoulos, and Gates.
Trump says Americans are too dumb to understand his tax returns: "They are extremely complex. People wouldn’t understand them."
Trump on possible subpoenas from House Dems: "If that happens, we will do the same thing, and then government comes to a halt. And I will blame them." Trump is actually threatening politically motivated investigations. This is a profound abuse of power.
Trump: "If they’re doing that, we’re not doing the other." Trump threatens not to work with House Dems on policy and legislation if they launch investigations of him.
Trump just said he will work with Democrats in the House on infrastructure and health care bills and then try to get a few Republicans in the Senate to pass them. Really, he said that. (He seems to forget that McConnell would have to bring a bill to the Senate floor.)
Trump: “I keep hearing about investigation fatigue.”	Narrator: "There have been no investigations yet."
Trump: “Had we kept [the House]….it puts us in a very tough position.....Now we have a much easier path." Trump essentially says that it would have been worse had the GOP kept the House with a narrow margin. Yes, he said that.
Trump names GOP candidates who lost and who didn't seek his support. He says, they "didn't want the embrace."
Trump: "We had a slew of historic wins in the governors races."	Narrator: "The Democrats flipped seven governors."
Trump claims it was a "big day" and says his midterm performance was better than Obama's. Doesn't note that in 2002 midterms, George W. Bush picked up two Senate seats and eight House seats.
Trump: "History will see what a good job we did."	Note to Trump: History does not have a sense of humor.
STOP THE PRESSES: Trump refuses to acknowledge election results were a major setback for Trump.

Has @IvankaTrump denounced @realDonaldTrump's encouragement of the "lock her up" chant? If not, she should keep quiet, move along, and spare us any phony concern. https://t.co/1w7c20CRQC
Any Republican or conservative who has not spoken out against Trump's embrace of the "lock her up" chant and his hate-fueled rhetoric should not be taken seriously when they now call for civil and respectful debate.
Two days ago, you shared a stage with @realDonaldTrump at a rally where the crowd chanted "lock her up." Did you do anything to discourage that? No. So take your brazen hypocrisy about being civil and respectful elsewhere. This is a phony tweet. https://t.co/DBsNUcKGKE

Understand this. Today is an example of the conservative elite, which represents a minority of Americans, ramming its right-wing agenda down the throat of this nation.
Conservatives are always moaning about liberal elites pushing their values and agenda on them. Now we have a president elected by a minority and senators who represent a minority of America imposing their right-wing choice on the nation. This is not good for democracy.
