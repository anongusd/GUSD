@Colvin4Congress The house is discussing possible long term H2b seasonal labor solutions - what is your stance on the issue? Marylands family owned crab processing industry depends on it!
@JoDougl76798176 @CiaranKelly02 @Russhall_3490 @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen In our case were in remote locations with limited labor pools due to vacation properties in our coastal towns increasing property values. Our wages are 20-30% higher than surrounding employment, if it were that simple problem would be solved.
@JoDougl76798176 @Russhall_3490 @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen You realize that this study was done prior to new regs and mandatory wage increases in the H2b program - that is why they’re using such old wage data.
@PatedBears @GovLarryHogan We're actually offering $4.50 a lb and last week we had employees that are highly skilled making close to $1,000 per week. This is not cheap work, the issue is finding people with the skills that are willing to learn. It is tedious work.
@Gates7Kirk @GovLarryHogan JM Clayton sent a bus one season, no one showed up after the first week - we need to get real about the labor shortage on seasonal jobs. These are ready to eat foods, meaning people need to be free of diseases - it isnt as simple as it seems.
@JoDougl76798176 @Russhall_3490 @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen No one even mentioned wages - H2b wages are set by the Dept of Labor. Every crab plant is Maryland is paying a minimum wage plus a piece rate that is above the local average. Pull recent data - our plant is paying $4.50 per lb. Get your facts straight

@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen I can’t speak for the group - I didn’t and will continue to vote against protectionist trade policies and backwards immigration proposals. It’s the best chance any of us have.
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Your right they are going to hurt consumers. My current strategy is voting consistently on keys issues and constant contact with our reps to let them know what matters. We’re in a strange environment right now so I’m hoping it ends up working
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen I was unable to support it the first time and still won’t be able to this time. Even without the h2b labor issue, his stance on trade relationships is a no go for me personally and I fear serious reproductions for small American businesses.
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen I voted against an agenda that touted the benefits of heavy tariffs and a closed worldview on trade and immigration and will continue to do so. I worry about a repeat of 2008 due to these types of policies but unfortunately right now we’re all along for the ride.
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Sorry after rereading I wasn’t very clear
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen They didn’t see it as about them because they utilize a legal labor program that isn’t immigration based, unfortunately it was a concern for me and now is a concern for all of the small business owners in our industry
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen I’m saying I couldn’t support Trump with his anti immigrant rhetoric - not everyone in our industry felt the same way.
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen Many in my area didn’t think he would possibly eliminate legal work programs only illegal immigration - unfortunately they didn’t realize that many of his supporters don’t care about the difference.
@FFSAmerica2018 @mcadecamp @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen I took his message literally when I decided who to vote for and anticipated this may be the outcome if trump was elected - unfortunately I don’t believe everyone thought it would come to this. It’s devastating our industry.

@KevinOpp27 Thank you! I wish more people understood the two programs and realized why the cap makes no sense at all for h2b
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg The accuracy of that information is dependent on USCIS, personally I think it should all be digital like the system in our air and sea ports which would increase the ability to prevent people from working while they overstay - that would require employers to follow the rules too
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg H2b employees are tracked by their I-94 travel history, if they don’t recross they aren’t eligible. That’s the data set being used to determine the 2%
@ForsytheJL @RepAndyHarrisMD Reasonably the people in my neighborhood and community are looking for full time work - our plant in Fishing Creek is in a community with less people than seasonal jobs. Jobs that have been tough to fill for the past 30 years in that area - this isn't a new problem.
@ForsytheJL @RepAndyHarrisMD I do, I have about 20 part time and full time workers that are Americans that pick crabs, 100+ American watermen, and 15-20 american dock workers - the issue is in peak season we need additional temporary help hence the use of the H2b temporary visas
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg The cap is 66,000 per year, which is not always reached - that's 1,320 people per year and 13,200 every 10 years. The main overstays are tourism and student visas - a million is definitely an overstatement for h2b.
Thank you @RepAndyHarrisMD https://t.co/Wp9mtQugON
@ForsytheJL @RepAndyHarrisMD American's harvest the crabs - those are the jobs he is talking about. The temporary H2b workers process the crabs and are paid and their wages are audited by the Dept of Labor to make sure they are paid fairly, our workers make $12-16 hr

@mtelford9397 Our industry is open to suggestions - small businesses have been in these loc for generations. I am sure everyone is open minded to any &amp; all solutions just to continue doing what they love. Hoping coverage will encourage people to tackle labor issues in coastal towns like ours.
@mtelford9397 Coming from a company that has actively been trying to move for 5 plus years to town and had been unable 😑
@mtelford9397 Discuss that with the communities that have voted not to move processing plants in their towns because they don’t want the smell etc - they don’t see the potential employment opportunities as enough of an incentive.
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg If they commit a crime they aren’t eligible for the H2b program since it includes background checks. Fixing this program so people have a legal route they can depend on and punishment for people who hire illegal immigrants is a start.
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg Even if not to work your welcome to check it out anytime, our whole community runs the risk of collapsing due to the change in policy on the H2b program this year since almost all work on the water in some way and processing is a huge part of it.
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg The overstay is less than 2% in the h2b program and most workers return year after year. It’s absolutely beautiful if you like quiet places, but because the work is seasonal it’s difficult to get people to move.
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg I don’t believe that Americans want other Americans to go out of business - I also think they need to educate themselves on these small family owned businesses and look for solutions instead of crimilizing and assuming we wouldn’t want Americans workers
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg Here is an idea of how remote the location is - our factory has been in continual operation since the 1960s, and is located where the product is landed and processed immediately. Unfortunately many urban areas find crab processing to be a nuisance https://t.co/kS3UEG9WID
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg They actually misquoted me as well - our Mexican h2b employees supplement our American workers and the pictures are of our plant - American citizens who were either born here or immigrated here legally are working because we always hire Americans first
@FelineAdvoCat @wwwCISorg We do hire Americans first and pay more than the wages quoted in this article, we need additional employees during our peak season that’s what the H2b program was created for to supplement our American employees
@MickMulvaneyOMB Please encourage OMB to expedite the process of @DHSgov regulatory action regarding H2b - we need to save what is left of our season! #Saveh2b https://t.co/nB4pa0nRh3
@mtelford9397 Thank you, I was responding to one of the comments on your thread who confused foreign labor with illegal labor.
@mtelford9397 @realDonaldTrump We don’t use illegal labor, we use the H2b program to supplement our American workforce in peak season with legal seasonal workers
@WarrenPlatts It’s piece rate or hourly which ever is higher, so $12 an hour regular time or $18 overtime
@WarrenPlatts If you’ve never been to fishing creek before it’s beautiful, just remote and a lot of the single family homes have been bought over the past few years for vacation homes which has driven housing costs up.
@WarrenPlatts We are located in fishing creek Maryland, our season begins in April and last until November. We run two shift, one early morning and another afternoon shift. Base pay is $9.51/hr, piece rate is $4 a lb. production standard is 3lb/hr
@ActionLori I’m not entirely certain, but when I discussed it with our recruiter he was thinking last year was about 10 days but the process was a done a little differently
@WarrenPlatts Crab processing is labor intensive and requires a lot of people we just can’t find enough people locally, and advertising nationally hasn’t resulted in many applicants either. My guess is seasonal work isn’t as attractive.
@WarrenPlatts We do have American employees, the issue we have is the area were in is remote which discourages people from moving for seasonal work. We also pay several dollars higher than the average for the area, in an effort to attract Americans
@WarrenPlatts Hoping a praying, we are just running into problems without labor in the meantime hoping to two things can come together so we can transition.
@WarrenPlatts We’ve been working with a robotics company the past few years though in hopes of something similar, just hoping we can get it done in time!

@PaddyPolymer @Murph2068 @claysclippers @h2bCapRelief @AlanRoark @smallbizmaine @ActionLori I can’t debate you on the eloquence, but I can on whether breitbart did any research at all for their h2b hit piece where they used the term seafood executives to place a negative connotation on small American businesses
@chesapeakebay I’m just going to put a blanket apology out there for everyone - I’m not sure who they spoke to and what the question was but the H2b crisis is not the foundations fault by any stretch of the immagination
@chesapeakebay I don’t think anyone in the industry feels that way. I can only speak for our company but this is a federal labor and immigration issue that has nothing to do with @chesapeakebay
@DivingWSharks @chesapeakebay I don’t think our end goals are that different - watermen care about a healthy bay more than anyone but I think changing the narrative that the groups are opposed needs to happen sooner rather than later
@DivingWSharks I am not sure why anyone would blame the @chesapeakebay, this is a labor and immigration issue that has been totally messed up due to bad information and politics.
@Deplorable444 @Cynthia76596806 @MarkSKrikorian That's fine we offer a transportation benefit as part of the H2b program. If he has any experience in seafood we'd love to interview him. Our location is so rural, Americans aren't applying.
@Deplorable444 @Cynthia76596806 @MarkSKrikorian Picking Crabs? Please have him apply, we are hiring!
@Cynthia76596806 @Deplorable444 @MarkSKrikorian We are required to pay above the average to participate in the program, I can point you to some examples if you’d like to verify.
@Merican777 @MarkSKrikorian It certainly is, I am laying off americans because I can’t get the h2b support staff that keep them employed. Our small community of a few hundred Americans risk being out of work due to the lack of H2b workers
@MarkSKrikorian Don’t let your views on immigration and legal h2b workers jade your views of small American owned businesses which are left to struggle because of an arbitrary lottery.
@MarkSKrikorian It is unfortunate that a news organization like Breitbart would call small family owned business owners “seafood executives” simply because they don’t like a visa program that had been a life line for remote communities

@pakoza51 @jhbailey1956 @1776Stonewall H2A is also paid a mean wage based on job description and job location data determined by the FLCdata center. So those using the program have mandatory wages dictated by the DOL. Trump currently utilizes H2a for his vineyard and H2b for his resorts.

@FallonBrenda @Murph2068 @aide_rob @SecNielsen @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @FoxNews It worries me, I hope the memo I saw today was wrong. We’ve used this program for 22 years trying to play by the rules and it isn’t looking good for this year.

@Cynthia76596806 @RepAndyHarrisMD I just emailed Tim Daniels in Harris' office, and he said he was still waiting for a reply. I've had my fingers crossed all day!
@suzy_rice Did you not just post this about the background check and tracking procedures? https://t.co/bjJsPeeBRr
@suzy_rice Literally 5 days standing in line for interviews, if you don’t believe me I understand but feel free to check with the consulate yourself if your interested.
@suzy_rice I just spent 5 days in Monterrey because it takes 2 days of interviews and fingerprints and background before they allow anyone to cross to border as an H2b employee. If you’re genuinely curious about the program please let me know I don’t want to over post to your feed
@DrReneHContrera @RodLeonard1 @SecNielsen @foxandfriends @DHSgov Paying prevailing wage is part of the program - reform of the program was done about 8 years ago and all wages are subject to DOL audit. Which is reasonable they should be audited to make sure your following the rules.
@suzy_rice No problem, sorry to bother you. If you have ideas please share them, if you have other issues to focus on I understand that too. Thank you for taking the time.
@suzy_rice I don’t think voters even realized what was happening, not saying they weren’t able but immigration was out of sight out of mind mid 90s-2000s it’s only until the past 5-8 years serious reforms have started to better the programs
@suzy_rice I was interested in what you thought about it, ideally reform is on its way and we need a solution that works for the country
@suzy_rice Which I don’t support, I’m limited on characters so I can’t really get into the weeds. I can’t see that being a solution for any of this.
@suzy_rice I was hoping you’d share some of your ideas, there’s no fixing this problem if everyone is in a Vaccum of people who think the same way. That’s the main reason I replied to your tweet, it wasn’t to argue with you
@suzy_rice As a nation we encouraged illegal immigration because we wanted cheap labor without the responsibility and now it’s come home to roost. We need a system in place immediately.
@suzy_rice One we stick to and follow and don’t continue changing our mind every 20 years. We have a large population of “undocumented” or “illegal” which ever word you prefer because we aren’t consistent
@suzy_rice I have some of my own ideas as an employer and it sounds like you do too. I am hoping for a strong everify, I think employers that are hiring people they shouldn’t should be punished. But all of this can’t succeed without an updated immigration system
@suzy_rice I don’t want people taking American jobs either, but I also have a definite understanding that in many rural communities this particular program has kept their small populations working and has shown positive benefits.
@suzy_rice Thank you, illegal aliens are a problem for us as employers. H2b employers want to supplement their American workforce with legal labor, we need a strong e verify and an immigration system that works.
@suzy_rice You are required to notify uscis immediately when the job is terminated. Each foreign employee is provided a letter of the notice with information letting them know if they don’t recross they are out of the program. It’s tracked through an I94.
@suzy_rice Everyone is seeking full time employment and as a company we try to keep as many people full time as we can, but crabs unfortunately are seasonal I don’t have much control on that front.
@suzy_rice I said they can afford?
@suzy_rice Why would I go out of my way to hire employees through H2b that have been background checked and tracked, if I was just going to hire people without status anyhow? I use H2b because I want to follow the law and I want to make sure the people I hire are playing by the rules.
@suzy_rice Of course I do it’s the law.
@suzy_rice All of this is included in the ad nationally on iCert and also locally in the paper, online and at the companies place of business.
@suzy_rice Yes there is, if they overstay their visa they are banned from coming again depending on the severity between 1-10 years. So there’s a huge incentive to follow the rules. Some rent on their own, in groups or employers provide housing benefits.
@suzy_rice This information is documented electronically by border and customs, which is where the stats come from on overstays.
@suzy_rice Most of the ads also offer employee housing at a discounted rate, this is offered to every employee American or seasonal H2b. The return rate for this program is less than 1%, I think many is an overstatement
@suzy_rice Where did I say that? I said most of the American job seekers I speak to are concerned about seasonal work because they feel they need to make money year round, which is reasonable. They have the exact same expenses as an H2b employee.
@suzy_rice I point job seekers to iCert all the time, even if they aren’t interested in our job there is unlimited potential there. All you have to do is apply! I’d love to have an entirely domestic workforce, but currently we supplement with H2b.
@suzy_rice They pay for many of these unskilled jobs is excellent ($20-50/hr) with housing options and travel to the job site. One just has to apply, show up and pass a drug test. Over 80,000 jobs and more everyday
@suzy_rice I just was talking with someone else on here days ago, if an American wanted to learn a trade or even travel the country there are an unlimited amount of opportunities listed on iCert.
@suzy_rice We do any American that applies anywhere in the county gets the exact same benefit as an H2b applicant.
@suzy_rice It’s honest work, and there’s potential to make good money because we also pay bonuses but it’s hard to convince potential new talent to give it a try. Especially since it’s 7-9 months a year, most reasonably are looking for full timeZ
@suzy_rice Our biggest impediment is location and the fact that it isn’t year round, plus it’s hard physical work. We process crabs, I haven’t had an applicant under 40 in the past 5 years, I can’t seem to get younger people interested.
@suzy_rice In some areas that is true. We are located in a small fishing village, it’s fairly remote so thankfully has had the opposite effect. Labor pool is limited, it’s raised our wage to stay competitive for whos interested &amp; also to be eligible for H2b program, which mandates wages.
@LamekNizyab @HollyZenacota @RodLeonard1 @SecNielsen @foxandfriends @DHSgov Good point, I hadn’t really thought of it that way. It’s definately not a path to permanent citizenship, and has no citizenship option built in. Some have felt like this was a flaw in the program, I’m not sure I agree with it being temporary and seasonal in nature.
@ClaudiuKyky @h2bCapRelief @H2Bworkforce @ActionLori Hoping to hear something soon, all of this suspense is a little much
@suzy_rice Most of the opposition I’ve run into has been democratic leaning union reps, at least in Maryland. In our situation it gets complicated due to the drastic economic differences between the eastern and western shore.
@HollyZenacota @RodLeonard1 @SecNielsen @foxandfriends @DHSgov My whole point was H2b workers are legal immigrants, their status is temporary. There isn’t a green card category for these people due to the nature of their work being seasonal and not possessing special skills. Rod is confusing H2b legal temp labor with illegal immigrants.
@YordanyRamirez8 What type of work were you doing before? Are you working with a recruiter? Right now I don’t have any visas unless they raise the cap.
@suzy_rice Interesting read, I don’t agree with some of his assumptions but we are in Maryland so some of the larger states he bases them on are different than here.

We’ve been working on those issues for 15 years but congress hasn’t heard us.
@JuliaDiamonds3 @BreitbartNews H2b and H2a are temporary work visas linked to the place of employment - how are they taking places at universities? Are you thinking of H1b tech visas?
@aylmar_swain Plus there’s less than a 1% overstay in the H2b program much less than more popular student visas programs. Is H2b really where illegal immigrants are coming from?
@aylmar_swain Where do we advertise in Mexico we advertise in America for months and also online and at job fairs. The recruiters for Mexico are based in the us and used only after Americans don’t respond to the advertisements
@HeckSociety @nypost It should, but without a permanent H2b fix the program isn’t reliable for those employers either.

@TruthJustis4USA @JakeHansen1621 @layla_lsm @zestyitalianCA @TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump He’s giving good honest employers a black eye, any employer who isn’t paying the wages they’ve guaranteed shouldn’t be able to participate. I would never imagine promising someone a wage and not delivering after they’ve sacrificed the time to come to work.
@JakeHansen1621 @TruthJustis4USA @layla_lsm @zestyitalianCA @TinaMorphis @realDonaldTrump It’s unfortunate that trumps companies have shed a negative light on the program, there are numerous small companies paying competives wages for seasonal work, and while trump has his workers they are left in the fray
@Coloradosandsto @FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham We’ve seen a huge wage increase which is good for everyone, but we need a strong immigration policy which in my opinion has to include seasonal labor. Leaving those jobs unfilled is a drain on our economic output
@Coloradosandsto @FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham I see some of the failings you mention, not with H2b employers that follow the rules but the ones that don’t. I still feel that most of the failings are due to weak immigration policy, rules were developed but never fully implemented
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz We tried prison labor at one point, but knives are needed for picking crabs so there were some security concerns and also turnaround after training. Plus most of the larger prisons are more than 2 hours away
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz We’re in a holding pattern right now because there are many at that level that see full time work as a danger to their benefits, I’ve talked to the state about possible offering some other type of intro program to bridge that gap too
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I don’t have the resources to House that many part time people, but I’ve talked to our transit about setting up some options to move people from more heavily populated areas, it’s getting them interested.
@YordanyRamirez8 @OutdoorTrc We’re both still waiting for visas
@FelineAdvoCat @SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz @senorrinhatch @JohnCornyn True story I joke with my H2b workers about this all the time - if my workers had their way they would have addressed most of these concerns years ago!
@mtelford9397 Naivety on my part for sure, our small businesses are paying in blood, sweat in tears without our H2b workers due to public distrust of visa programs abused by large companies. Hopefully long term solutions are on the horizon.
@FelineAdvoCat @SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I never realized how many were impacted by the growth of h1b until I started speaking to people here on Twitter the impacts have been devastating. I am not sure how that narrative isn’t getting to our representatives
@FelineAdvoCat @SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz Agreed, H1b has had a serious impact on American wages and employment in the tech sector. I am hoping reforms are on their way to address those issues. In the mean time I am hoping us h2b employees caught in the fray can stay afloat long enough for a fix
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham God bless you too! 😊
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham Well thank you! We’ve all got to keep working on fixing the employment issues we’re having in this country, thanks for the conversation!
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 A suggestion the other poster made was a better connection between American job seekers and the iCert national job board. I don’t think states are suggesting those jobs like they could to American job seekers
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham Amen. Every good employer I reach out to feels the same way, most are small companies. I think a combination of everify and a better border crossing system would help, in addition to an incressed DOL wage and hour budget for audits.
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 It’s not perfect, there’s definitely room for improvement but we have a hard time getting to the discussion who the yearly struggle over cap relief
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 Definitely not. I would be an idiot to think that, the changes were positive and needed because of those abuses.
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 Just trying not to operate in a vacuum, I speak to a lot of people who participate and i worry if I never speak to people who have concerns we’ll never get this issue fixed
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham I’m sorry you took it as me attacking you. I took you tweet as an interest in improving the program to benefit American workers. Which I believe is a possibility.
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham I had a really good conversation with a gentleman on another thread Saturday who offered several really solid suggestions how the program could approve. When you posted I thought you could have some constructive ideas.
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham I advertise all over the country there’s a national database open to all job applicants for jobs all over the country, all part of the positive reform changes they made several years ago to reach more American job seekers.
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 It looks like all of these examples were prior to the large overall and reform the H2b program went through, so you have any more current examples?
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 That is my goal exactly, which is why I commented. I’ve been in the program for 22 years without issues, so I’ve been reaching out to address concerns that may apply to some but haven’t to us.
@FelineAdvoCat @sxdoc @LisaSmith4680 @Success87473781 #h2b is non-skilled seasonal labor, with a mandatory american hiring component. Where are all these displaced americans in our rural town?
@FelineAdvoCat @SenateGOP @Mike_Beacham How is H2b replacing American workers, when a requirement of the program is to hire American's first?
@RealScott__ I just wish someone would step up and fix this problem, it's not a tit for tat battle - it's our livelihood. At this point I am disappointed in all of our representatives for not securing the returning worker exemption and leaving us in the lurches

@jhiggywitit @MagicianJGP @runzwithknives @ALT_uscis Those are the horror stories that should remove people from the program, people deserve to be treated with dignity.

@jhiggywitit @runzwithknives @ALT_uscis In our area, the nearby resort area has given H2b a bad name for these same reasons but in fact they are J1 visas ultimately given us h2b employers who do follow the rules with bad public perception of the program

@OutdoorTrc Plus I’m going to fight like hell to get this fixed for next season - the longer they wait the more fuel it adds to the fire I am going to apply to our representatives
@OutdoorTrc We are in the same position, I just refuse to loose hope that something will be done. I am praying DHS releases them this month so we can salvage what’s left of the season. #SAVEH2B @SecNielsen @DHSgov
@TonyCardone19 I ask because I’ve been looking companies up on iCert and calling them to encourage them to contact their representatives it would be helpful to point them in that direction
@TonyCardone19 Is there a running list somewhere - it may help to have a google doc with everyone listed whether they support #rwe and who/how to contact their H2b liaison
@stormchase3 Agreed a strong seasonal work visa program  can benefit the American worker, but with any immigration program it needs to be well regulated. Seasonal jobs help support full time American jobs.
@TonyCardone19 @claysclippers I’ve already started calling about the 2019 appropriations, we need along term fix. Every year we quiet down after the storm every H2b employer needs to call at least once a month to keep the pressure up.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz To be fair there are also lower paying jobs, but with both high and low you have to keep in mind the area that they are located. Wages in certain parts of the country are going to be lower than others due to the cost of living differences.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz And get this - none of these jobs require any experience and little to no education. Just the ability to show up to work on time, a clean record and to pass a drug test! I could post more but I think my point is clear - why aren't people applying?

@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz That unfortunately train their successor. What are the metrics used to determine pay for those jobs? We use prevailing wage, I'll need to do some research.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz Now I am not as familiar with H1b, but I think more could be done with that program to fill those vacancies with Americans. The immigrants that come through H1b are supposed to be high skilled, but I often hear case studies of displaced Americans
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I see alot of confusion between the 2 programs, H2b to me is benefical to Americans with proper regulation and enforcement, because it puts Americans in supervisory positions. H1b concerns me because I see a lack of enforcement on the wages.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I do have some reservations about H1b though, which are used for high skilled immigrants. I would like to see more American training to fill those openings.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I've worked with our state to try to address that, but still only two applicants this year. There are jobs right now in Texas through h2b paying over $50 a hour, but you've got to connect the job seekers with the opportunities
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz It's been a blessing because hard work should be rewarded with more compensation, but for some reason that still has not equated to more applicants. It could just be lack of connecting people with the resources
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz Just an example the minimum wage is $7.25, the prevailing wage is over $12. I have employees making over $14 due to increased production and I advertise that. I can't imagine that happening without pressure from DOL &amp; H2b
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz The point is our wages went up in my area sue to h2b and prevailing wages. The lower cost of living is the trade off we make for lower wages. I can't expect to make what I would in Baltimore and still be able to purchase a home for 100K
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz They may want to double check their program rules, I know that we offer it because it's in the best interest for our employees and we don't have a strong transportation system in our rural town.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz Yes we do, it is in every advertisement and is reviewed by Dept of Labor before they approve the application. And your right, some don't and I wish those people would be punished and removed. Let the employers who honestly need help get their support staff.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I'd be more than happy to and thankful if you did! We can't figure it out without having conversations like this one. I can't promise you a fortune in consultant fees, but I would be happy to fix you up with some delicious Maryland crabmeat!
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I have less than 10, I use to have over 50. Unfortunately the younger generations don’t see a value in crab picking and our heritage is slowly dying off. H2b workers are expensive, I wouldn’t participate if it didn’t help keep my American employees employed
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I forgot you asked about “anchor babies”, an H2b worker is not authorized to work if the consulate finds out their pregnant. The employees I’ve had that have gotten pregnant, return home to have their children because they want to continue working
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I suppose anyone could change their name, but they aren’t working for me without documentation. If everify is fixed it would provide a much needed stopgap in preventing people from working under fraudulent identity’s.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz In my own experience, workers have not been allowed to cross because of debts and criminal cases. The consulate does a through background check before the consulate lets them come as H2b workers.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz They can’t work here without a social security card, they get social security card that clearly says on it - only valid with work authorization. That is what they pay taxes with while they are employed here
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz I don’t disagree with you that we need a strong accountability system, we do. But the number of overstays and abuse are much higher in other categories like student visas than we see in H2b
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz The visas are temporary,they have a two day consulate interview on the way into the country, where they aren’t permitted in if there’s a suspicion they’ll overstay and then also on the way out. They use that information to calculate the number of overstays
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz If you check out the website you can see every job in the country that is open, call some of the employers and ask their experiences before you judge the program. Many are like us and are really trying but can’t seem to get people interested in “dirty” jobs
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz If you haven’t please check out https://t.co/ihiQhfZDNI for a national job registry. Also we advertise year round on our website. All rules mandated by the H2b program to help reach as many American workers as possible which we support fully.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz We advertise in our areas largest paper for two weeks, and every H2b job is advertised across the country for the entire year. We also advertise throughout our state on the job board for the entire year. And we take part, full or any time.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz We live in rural area, I have a masters degree and don’t make $20 a hour! We offer housing for employees and every H2b job offers transportation to the worksite its a rule when you participate in the program.
@ShainaAdelman @SCINTLE @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz Exactly, because we’re offering above the board jobs where taxes and workers comp is paid on all employees. I think there’s confusion with H2b which is legal seasonal migration with a 1% overstay and illegal immigration
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz If they don’t leave, they’re tracked by the dept of homeland security and lose their ability to work again. That’s why we pay fees with our H2b applications to help enforce the rules of the program.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz They’re required to clear up their medical bills before they’re allowed to work each year, any trouble they have in the US impacts their ability to work each year. Your confusing legal workers with illegal migrants.
@stormchase3 Also thank you for answering with a reasonable reply, its disheartening the amount of negativity H2b faced without conversions on real applicable solutions.
@stormchase3 When this program was suggested to us 22 years ago by our Dept of Labor it was to bridge that gap, unfortunately there are some people not using it that way and we are left in the lurches.
@stormchase3 The most frustrating thing for us as H2b employers who are actively trying to recruit Americans is we need a seasonal support staff to try to keep the Americans full time. Our season is April - Nov, and for Americans the bills don't stop in the winter!
@stormchase3 Several years ago we hosted job fairs in other states, but where the work is only seasonal we had trouble convincing people to move to our area.  Our biggest resistance from Americans is that it is seasonal, which is completely understandable.
@SCINTLE @ShainaAdelman @mtelford9397 @wwwCISorg @HouseGOP @POTUS @SenSherrodBrown @SenateMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @tedcruz What makes you feel like it’s a subsidy? We’ve been using the program in our rural community for almost 22 years. I’ve been trying to see what makes people feel so negatively about H2b.
@stormchase3 Please send them to our rural community! We are on Maryland's Eastern Shore and with a lack of infrastructure we are running into issues getting people to step into our seasonal positions. We're paying competitive wages and added sick leave. We need help!

@DANNK2 @RicTXag @FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC Your heart is in the right place, and we are on the same side when it comes to providing good jobs to Americans. But there are seasonal demand jobs that aren’t being filled a well legislated H2b program is a win win for both.
@DANNK2 @RicTXag @FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC The low wage argument is a myth, if you don’t believe me feel free to check out the national job registry. Many of the jobs are over $20 a hour, the reason they aren’t being filled is because they’re seasonal.
@DANNK2 @RicTXag @FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC The H2b program has a less than 2% overstay rate, the real problem is a lack of everify and real repercussions for employers who continue to hire undocumented workers. If we fix the H2b program it’s a win win for American workers.
@DANNK2 @FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC We always hire American first. Other higher paying positions in our company are all filled by Americans that depend on the seasonal support staff to produce the goods they sell and deliver. For rural areas like ours the labor pool isn’t there.
@DANNK2 @FAIRImmigration @BreitbartNews @NeilMunroDC I’m glad you asked, I do. Unfortunately we are looking for crab processors and the veterans I’ve interviewed aren’t interested in the position.

We’ve worked with the state to try to increase our American workforce to no avail - we use the H2b program to supplement our workforce and to provide management opportunities to Americans

@RealScott__ @ChuckGrassley I'm in the process of calling every business who applied to for H2b in Iowa - they should know how much their senator cares about their seasonal business.
@RealScott__ @ChuckGrassley Over 40 employers from his state have applied for H2B workers - they need employees! He needs to understand the needs of his constituents and employers all over the country.
@ChuckGrassley We need you to #SAVEH2B - American employers need their support staff to CONTINUE HIRING AMERICAN WORKERS!!!

@SenatorCardin @ChrisVanHollen @RepAndyHarrisMD @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan         Our Small seasonal business needs your help - over 100 hard working fishermen are wondering if we are going to have the support labor to process their catch? We need congress to fix H2B!
Our American workers and seasonal business cannot operate without the help of our H2b seasonal workers - Some who have LEGALLY been working for us for over 20 years! We need Congress to help us NOW! Our local fishermen depend on it!#SaveH2B #CapRelief #saveamericanjobs https://t.co/OybSuIEkP0

@h2bCapRelief Thank you - we’ve been utilizing the program for 22 years to supplement our seasonal workforce. Our rural area would be devastated without these seasonal workers.
@h2bCapRelief He deserves a lot of credit for his support of the program, I just wish we could get our senators in Maryland on board!
