@dbongino @SebGorka Descriptive categorization. Labeling.
@GaretEliot @CryptoMob @PollackHunter Correct. The onus of responsibility for knowing and adhering to the law of the land is on the individual. Do you see the difference?
@GaretEliot @CryptoMob @PollackHunter Don‚Äôt forget to account for the statistical probability of getting shot in a school. It‚Äôs less than 1/1M, making it one of the safest places to be ever. So we are looking to curb the exception, not the rule. Your other suggestions do more than regulating private sale ever would.
@GaretEliot @CryptoMob @PollackHunter IMO, to set a legal standard for what you suggest is to set a precedent to which there is no end and would be abused by the court. Already it is hard enough for gun manufacturers to stay out of civil legal proceedings. The libs go after the pocketbook to try to shut them down.
@GaretEliot @CryptoMob @PollackHunter ...a crime. OTOH, you may be held financially accountable for any loss as a result of your sale if deemed so by the court in a civil (not criminal) proceeding.
@GaretEliot @CryptoMob @PollackHunter While I can understand the sentiment, the answer to your question is no. It is not your responsibility to ensure someone else doesn‚Äôt commit murder. That‚Äôs a well established legal standard. Knowingly transferring a firearm to a felon or other person legally restricted is already

One of the primary problems with regulation is it always comes with taxes, creating a public record where one needn‚Äôt exist. This is one of those slippery slopes that‚Äôs true.

@Stick2Sportz @TomiLahren More murders by knives and hammers than by AR-15s by a long stretch. But it‚Äôs not death you care about. It‚Äôs about how they died that seems scary.  Even though there are thousands of ways you are more probable to die.

Manner of death is really what gets you all emotional.  Heart disease won‚Äôt do it. Drunk driving won‚Äôt do it. Murder by knives (or hammers) won‚Äôt.

@AustinGoldin @stealthygeek @TomiLahren And we would be served quite well by a few less laws, IMO.
@RichardMoore_ No can do. Rights aren‚Äôt privileges. With an estimated 300 million legally owned guns in the US, the number of guns argument is hollow. If there was a problem with legal ownership, you‚Äôd know it. I love that you assume you are morally superior. Makes folks want to listen. Nope.
@davidhogg111 Yes please, can you ban cell phones too? Distracted driving kills thousands.
@RichardMoore_ That‚Äôs categorically incorrect. Intent to kill is a crime, no shots fired. Most of the firearms were stolen. Even Parkland. The kid stole them from a locked safe, thus as a minor without adult consent, possessed them illegally. Crime. No shots fired.
@AustinGoldin @stealthygeek @TomiLahren If a crime is already a crime, what purpose does it serve to make it more of a crime, and further restrict the liberties of those that won‚Äôt commit crimes?
@AustinGoldin @stealthygeek @TomiLahren I just want to know, very specifically, what laws you would enact, that will stop the kind of crime you are currently so passionate about. I‚Äôm not saying do nothing, but you act as though nothing has been done already (by virtue of mass shootings still occur).

You can seek out and analyze the facts that support arguments counter to your own opinion. Do the same to your own position.
@GuesLori @SenFeinstein @CharlesJHernan2 So then, you must ask why do the politicians playing as liberals want to repeal the 2A?  What purpose does that serve? Clue: its not public safety. This is the beginning of critical thinking. Peel back the layers of logical reasoning on both sides of the issue.
@GuesLori @SenFeinstein @CharlesJHernan2 An appropriately armed population ensures a balance of power between govt power and the people.  To some, guns are scary. Statistically, gun deaths are dwarfed by other causes of death to be nearly statistically insignificant.

@Layogi @woofwoofblake @SenFeinstein It‚Äôs a culture problem and the sooner you come to grips with that the sooner this madness stops. You are safer because of personal gun ownership even if you aren‚Äôt smart enough to take responsibility for your own personal protection.

@rangerwyld @SenFeinstein @Marina_Sirtis Your country lives under the blanket of security we provide. Shut up.
@woofwoofblake @SenFeinstein @Layogi What doesn‚Äôt that map show you? It shows that murder rates in cities are statistically comparable. Now ask why, when gun ownership per capita is lower in cities than rural communities. Why is it murder rate per capita in rural areas are so much lower a comparison can‚Äôt be made?
@GuesLori @SenFeinstein @CharlesJHernan2 Reagan, like myself have both been shot. Reagan never became a gun abolitionist, nor will I.
@SenFeinstein Fact check me.
@SenFeinstein Correlation does not equal causation. Quit perpetuating a lie. The fact that our murder rate is in fact very low on a per capita basis shows that you have drawn the wrong conclusion. That we have so many guns but relatively few murders shows that guns aren‚Äôt the problem.

@IAmDavidManning @DaleHudspeth @JohnStossel Rules=generally agreed upon fair trade practices. No ‚Äòdumping‚Äô, inter-country trade agreements based on mutual economic interests and not for some other reason.
@IAmDavidManning @DaleHudspeth @JohnStossel Is the US satisfied?  I would venture to say that there is a perception of unequal status. I‚Äôve heard scholars say a high national debt is a strategic liability. That doesn‚Äôt seem congruent with deliberately running a large trade deficit.
@JuddLegum Yup. Jail. Clear ethical violation if the confidant was privy to and subsequently used information granted him by the President for profit.
@IAmDavidManning @DaleHudspeth @JohnStossel Ok-tariffs obviously restrict trade, which, by less commerce is occurring, lower the GDP/economy. Strong manufacturing is a strategic interest, a fundamental one. China isn‚Äôt playing by the ‚Äòrules;‚Äô what then is to be done?  We all suffer together to better our national position?

@TimMattox @s_man76a @LiaS814 @FlightmanLHR @msamson56 @danablankenhorn @MichaelSkolnik @NRA So basically what you are advocating that a one needs a license to murder with a firearm. More homicides are committed without using firearms than with. Where‚Äôs your license for hammers, fists, alcohol, etc.?

@nowthisnews But he‚Äôs not even telling the truth with his numbers!  Tell the whole story on a per capita basis. Make sure you compare us with countries that outright ban firearms. Mix in some facts about what firearms are used, where they are used and comparisons to other causes of death.
@TimMattox @s_man76a @LiaS814 @FlightmanLHR @msamson56 @danablankenhorn @MichaelSkolnik @NRA The firearm industry in this country is highly regulated! Not only is it regulated, the penalties are stiff. Like 0-felon in seconds if you‚Äôre caught breaking the law.

@j7bryanj @TheLibWay My opinion? Because that guy and the most recent asshole that shot up the kids wanted to feel powerful, grabbed a gun. Florida-boy just took it a step further to feel the thrill of actually taking lives. I‚Äôve got nothing but contempt for both. They both knew right vs. wrong.
@j7bryanj @TheLibWay Look, I was a bullied kid too. Unlike him, I got the shit kicked out of me by 6 shitheads in the 9th grade. Not almost, they completed the job. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòalmost‚Äô go on a killing spree. I had access to all my guns and my dad‚Äôs. I guess I just knew that wasn‚Äôt the way.
@j7bryanj @TheLibWay I fail to see what link you are trying to establish. He didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. I don‚Äôt buy it that an AR-15 would have changed his mind. 2nd, he knew, in that moment what he was contemplating was wrong, maybe?
@AKobulinsky @Elaines2cents @Debradelai Fear of a firearm as an object is also a huge part of the problem. It causes so many misperceptions to be believed about the subject it can prevent critical thinking.
@benshapiro I know that‚Äôs what he said... ...but what he means is take some kind of action if you want change. He, like so many, confuse the spiritual notion of prayer and equate the faithful‚Äôs vehicle for change. He doesn‚Äôt really understand that the defense of 2A liberty isn‚Äôt faith based.
@LillyPaloma1980 @dafrema @NPR You must take to heart that those that own firearms are just as appalled and horrified by that monster and what he did. Holding him accountable is doing something. Beyond that the real fix to this continued problem lies in our social units, our culture, our national identity.
@LillyPaloma1980 @dafrema @NPR On a real note, you really ought to consider the validity of the opposing party‚Äôs position on the matter. Once you realize how truly constrained gun ownership is in this country, it will help you understand why you will receive stiff resistance on any erosion of firearm liberty.
@dafrema @NPR @LillyPaloma1980 Innovation goes both ways in this case. Bump stock. Defeats the intent of the 1920‚Äôs law banning automatic firearms. OTOH, civilian innovations supporting the AR-15 platform directly improved the lethality of the M4 weapon system.

@canyonjim Weapon‚Äù means any thing used, designed to be used or intended for use (a) in causing death or injury to any person, or (b) for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes a firearm.
@canyonjim Assault. ... An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm. It is both a crime and a tort and, therefore, may result in either criminal or civil liability. Common law definition is the same in criminal &amp; Tort Law.

@science_shea @RichardDawkins I don‚Äôt suffer fools. As a libertarian, I maximize individual liberty and while also maximizing personal responsibility. Banning guns rarely result in the desired outcome and thus has no net effect on the root cause. Guns are repeatedly statistically analyzed to show this.

@JoyAnnReid Never heard of you but it‚Äôs not nostalgia. Railing against the shared cultural values that promote unity, like language, patriotism and positivity towards our sacred national symbols like the flag and national anthem is divisive. We need these things...
Jab after jab, #POTUS dismantles the progressive foreign policy stance of the previous administration. #SOTU

@Thomas1774Paine Israel and Palestine are such minor speed bumps in world history that world powers lament, gnash teeth and wring hands about. Letting them call Jerusalem capital is so inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, and won‚Äôt be the cause of the apocalypse.
@Thomas1774Paine You may not like him or contraception, but he‚Äôs not wrong.
@SenSanders Maybe it‚Äôs time for term limits? Campaign finance wouldn‚Äôt matter as much.
Whoa... https://t.co/3pJOZZzV91
@Thomas1774Paine Well that‚Äôs no good.
@PressSec @DeptofDefense By all means, get them the precious football game. Silly.
@JulianAssange It is pure idiocy for him to attempt a senate run. Not only can‚Äôt he win, there are too many people that want him tried for treason. Apparently it‚Äôs not illegal for him to be elected in the state of MD. So that‚Äôs not the issue.

@SenDuckworth I just looked you up. My apologies, you are a veteran ma‚Äôam, and your your opinions on military matters are grounded. However, regardless of your opinions on the man, the Commander in Chief merits consideration by position. Would you say the same to Obama?
@SenDuckworth ...and oh btw, when did you serve?
@SenDuckworth Would you listen to anyone about what our military needs? Paychecks are just one aspect. We also need an operating and maintenance budget, and perhaps honor our fallen and their families with death gratuity and SGLI (life insurance) payments.
@Thomas1774Paine Mark, @MarkRuffalo, that is a claim that works for most white Americans, I‚Äôll just say this: indigenous people, slaves, and those migrants that immigrated prior to regulatory law.
@SenSanders How about this? Let them.
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary. Twitting is still just as stupid. https://t.co/1psRbkkoPk
@HillaryClinton Power to you trolls?  That‚Äôs just a bad idea.
@SenSanders I‚Äôm starting to think all you do is complain about Republicans. You act as though you are above accepting some free chicken. Yet I‚Äôm not sensing that you have any compromise when it comes to DACA because it‚Äôs the right flavor for libs right now.
@SenSanders And mostly white people.

@neiltyson That‚Äôs been known forever, but who but them with those kinds of egos and that level of a sense of self-righteousness would be a politician? I think they are, as a group the most well compensated body public that does not do the job that is asked of them.
@politico Term limits
@CamiAnnS @TomiLahren If you could make enough money to afford a mortgage and cover the family expenses by working on the local farm you would have plenty of workers competing for farm jobs. $15 min wage just won‚Äôt get you there. But here‚Äôs the thing, we must be ok with very high produce prices.
@mmurphy0907 @TomiLahren Where is your data?
@thegoodmama @kevthomben @DakotaTheis @Bowser19622 @reggaerockgaL @SenSanders Nor should they. They aren‚Äôt citizens.
@kevthomben @thegoodmama @DakotaTheis @Bowser19622 @reggaerockgaL @SenSanders Most illegal aliens work with false documentation, thus do have W2s and taxes withheld. Employers run the risk of heavy IRS fines if they can‚Äôt show this documentation. Illegals cannot file for their refund this the IRS gets to keep all the money withheld
@thegoodmama @kevthomben @DakotaTheis @Bowser19622 @reggaerockgaL @SenSanders But they break the law and expect amnesty. Do our laws not matter?
@SenSanders I want the wall. I want more law enforcement on that border specifically. You simply cannot make sweeping statements about subjects that we are divided about. Once again, you continue to make absurd statements to make your liberal base feel like you give one shit about this subj.
@TheTylt Well That‚Äôs obtuse.

@realposhpenguin @WKortepeter @CongressmanRaja He did eff himself, just like you say. However, my row with all of this spillage of classified information and business ties to foreign nations is that the rules were applied inconsistently. HRC got away with lying under oath and was not held accountable for spilling secret info.
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi Armageddon right? Idiot.
@StephenHerreid Ugh
@elonmusk @CristatoLive @SpaceX It‚Äôs always the aliens, duh
@Thomas1774Paine And here hypothesis is perfectly logical. It‚Äôs good for everyone that rule of law supersedes religious beliefs in this country.
@JoyAnnReid Sad because it‚Äôs in our national interest to have a strong steel industry.
@GeorgeTakei Most folks have no idea what E Pluribus Unum even means. Since that is a fact, why does it matter if he changes the slogan on a non-official object or symbol?

@JohnStossel Career term limits?  Would love some evidence that this idea is good or bad.
@SenSanders That‚Äôs ok, you could just refill the treasury coffers from the Federal Reserve profits. Problem. Solved.  Oh, and all those rich billionaires that don‚Äôt want this tax plan could just give some of their money to the treasury.
@derekYosi @LKrauss1 Nope. Just need the commerce. Problem.  Solved.
@SenSanders Is that what it means? Because I thought it meant accountability and review of social programs in a effort to reduce fraud and encourage folks to enter the workforce.
@RichardDawkins Isn‚Äôt royalty ordained by god?  It‚Äôs specifically hereditary, right?
@aaron_blunt True story.

@bravenak Who even are you?
@TheTylt You won‚Äôt even notice.
@ItsTonyBetch @ths77chris @GeorgeTakei @actdottv Locked me also.
@ths77chris @GeorgeTakei @actdottv Threat free? Are you kidding? What kind of bubble do you live? A: the one provided for you by armed citizens. Your freedom to think you are safe is bought and paid for by actual blood. There are actual people out there that want you dead, simply because you exist.
@ths77chris @ItsTonyBetch @GeorgeTakei @actdottv Spoken like a true constitutional scholar...
@whitkarm @AbandonPretense @GeorgeTakei @actdottv It always astounds me that folks would give up their liberty so freely.  Of course it won‚Äôt work.
@billadler @GeorgeTakei @actdottv The thing not mentioned here is that Japan is populated by 99.9% Japanese. Seems you would know that a homogeneous society is far easier to set rules in, such as no guns. This vid created a false equivalency by assuming the same could be applied in the same way in the US.
@GeorgeTakei @actdottv I‚Äôm sure the Yakuza take the classes and get screened to carry their guns. Seems logical.
@TheTylt Would we allow ourselves to continue to be so helpless? Collectively we expect for ‚Äòmass shootings‚Äô to stop by taking no action against a shooter in the moment. I‚Äôm certain the only way to deter this b.s. in the short run is to allow good people to respond in kind.
@mikemusgrave @RichardDawkins Now I do understand that trophy hunting for elephants may indirectly assist increasing elephants overall numbers by providing a local industry that pays well enough to offset the profitability of poaching.
@mikemusgrave @RichardDawkins Actually you‚Äôre wrong. I‚Äôm native. My mom lives on an actual reservation. My point is, if only the indigenous harvested elephants for meat, population numbers would be stable and we wouldn‚Äôt need to converse about it.
@CrowMeris @yashar Meh, being bisexual is no crime and we can assume consent. Adultery is also not a crime, but could represent an injured party.
@michaelianblack Except that injury to one liberal is injury to all.
@yashar Statistically, how likely is this to happen?  Granted, where they had sex is what makes it wrong, this isn‚Äôt an inherently bad act taken singularly. It‚Äôs interesting that we assume we inconsistency and outright hypocrisy when we hear of incidents like this.
@wyatt_barstow @TEDTalks @DMiliband I think you missed the author‚Äôs point: we need to provide the time and space for the moderation/self-regulation to occur from within. Don‚Äôt know if I fully agree...
@TEDTalks @DMiliband We can beat violent jihad into submission militarily, proven fact. Yet the movement remains, reinventing itself. If you want to speed up assimilation into western culture, harsh, generally unacceptable measures must be taken. Otherwise accept the risk of moving slowly.
@mikemusgrave @RichardDawkins I‚Äôm highly doubtful elephant meat is consumed by natives is in a quantity enough to merit consideration. This would be akin to our Alaskan natives and others truly harvesting and whaling. A drop in the bucket if no other whaling is allowed.
@Nadz158 @RichardDawkins I agree. I do, however, think there are a great deal fundamentally flawed concepts delivered by the Bible and Quran, as they specifically dictate what social norms are and what are acceptable customs in contemporary context. Yes, it‚Äôs always wise to take Each case individually.
What if term limits worked like this: 20 years max combined eligibility to serve in a federally elected position with some exceptions allowed to allow a politician finish a term or presidential incumbency?  What would happen? #TermLimits
@Nadz158 @RichardDawkins It is truly fantastic to me that you can feel safe enough to express your thoughts and reasoning without fear of being killed. Islam is such an easy target to take aim at from the outside.
@afbutt @RichardDawkins Wuuuut?
RT @RichardDawkins: https://t.co/gaCsox3Gz0
@mikemusgrave @RichardDawkins Emotion removed. I agree, population control is ONE WAY to assist the preservation of a species. There are others.  What basic need does killing an elephant cover?
@RichardDawkins Ok, so I can get behind this, for reasons beyond simply preserving a species, though that reason alone is a noble endeavor. Elephants are unequivocally sentient on the same level of humans and therefore have rights.
@kevins_fingers @soniclore @JFNYC1 This is an absurd argument!  To imply that people in population centers are ‚Äòbetter educated‚Äô is a preposterous claim.
