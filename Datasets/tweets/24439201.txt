Dems note that a power plant manufacturer that could benefit from a nuclear deal is a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management, the company that provided financial relief to the family of Jared Kushner. They took a 99-year lease on the family‚Äôs deeply indebted 666 Fifth Avenue.
Yet the effort to promote nuclear sales persisted, led by former National Security Council chief Gen. Michael Flynn and more recently by Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The possible nuclear power sale was discussed in the Oval Office as recently as last week.
The officials who objected included White House lawyers and H.R. McMaster, then the chief of the NSC. They called for a halt in the nuclear sales discussions in 2017, citing potential conflicts of interest, national security risks and legal hurdles.

Trump claims that Obama told him when they met after the 2016 election that he was close to starting a big war with North Korea.
Trump after telling a reporter to sit down: "I get my numbers from a lot of sources."
Trump praises Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. He also says Ann Coulter is "off the reservation," but he says she'd be nice to him if he took the time to call her.
Trump spotted his newly confirmed attorney general and asked him to stand to be recognized at the end of a riff on trade with China, in which he complained that he could negotiate the best deal ever with Beijing and Dems would still criticize him. Then he said he'd do the same.
Trump: "The only reason we're up here talking about this is because of an election."
Trump predicts that he will lose in court on his national emergency. Until it gets to the Supreme Court. Where he has appointed two justices with long track records of supporting expansive claims of executive power. üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è

Trump suggests he does not care what Congress does. "Just so you know, we‚Äôre building the wall anyway," the president declares in El Paso. It's like when Andrew Jackson said that the Supreme Court had made its decision, not let them enforce it.
Trump: ‚ÄúThey say progress has been made with this committee. Just so you know, we‚Äôre building the wall anyway!"

Other big issues Trump neglected to mention last night in the State of the Union: climate change, transgender rights, gun control, voting rights, forcible family separations and Puerto Rico hurricane recovery. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
Unlike previous GOP presidents, Trump neglected to mention entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The ballooning debt will be a core element of Trump‚Äôs legacy -- especially if there's a real crisis. It‚Äôs a story line that continues to be majorly under-covered.
Trump also indirectly warned that US might engage in a costly arms race after withdrawing from the INF Treaty with Russia: ‚ÄúPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can‚Äôt ‚Äî in which case, we will OUTSPEND ... all others by far!"
Instead, he boasted about cutting taxes, which has reduced revenue and forced the Treasury to essentially borrow more money from places like China. All of it will need to be paid back ‚Äì with interest!
Trump called for major new spending to eradicate HIV and develop new cancer treatments for children. Those are laudable goals, for sure, but he never talked about how he‚Äôs going to pay for them.
When Trump previewed the speech for a group of supporters on Monday night, one of his allies asked whether he would discuss the deficit. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney interjected. ‚ÄúNobody cares,‚Äù he said, per ABC.
Thread --&gt; Hey, big spender: Trump didn‚Äôt even make a rhetorical nod to the need for fiscal responsibility during last night's State of the Union. The president did not mention the budget deficit or the national debt even once. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
The moment people will remember from the #SOTU years from now is when Trump engaged with the new Democratic congresswomen wearing white. If you were making a documentary about 2018 as a Year of the Woman, it'd be the perfect final scene as credits roll. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
Why did Trump zero in on abortion during #SOTU? He needs to juice his standing with social conservatives ahead of 2020. He no longer has a looming Supreme Court pick to dangle. Instead, he's calling for new restrictions on women‚Äôs reproductive rights. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
Trump touted U.S. negotiations with the TALIBAN in the #SOTU. Imagine how apoplectic certain conservatives would have been if Obama had boasted to Congress about opening a dialogue with the Taliban. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
Like other presidents who have faced divided government, including Nixon, Trump has devoted more attention to foreign policy as his term has gone on. Obama made a similar shift in 2011 #SOTU. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN
Trump, who spoke of ‚ÄúAmerican carnage‚Äù in his inaugural, showed again his brand will always be ‚ÄúCRISIS.‚Äù We visualized the words Trump used last night that no president has EVER before uttered during a State of the Union. Among them: bloodthirsty, sadistic, venomous and chilling.
Looking to 2020, Trump is again singing his greatest hits from 2016. He‚Äôs like a band that struggles to play new material because the fans always want to hear the classics. In this case, that's protectionism, nativism and isolationism. https://t.co/0oS1rzEF9l
Teleprompter Trump never lasts. Twitter Trump always returns. The president erratically jumped between the discordant roles of unifier and disrupter. There weren‚Äôt great signposts or transitions, which made the 82-minute address sound as though it had been written by committee.
Trump presented a false choice when he warned Democrats against investigating him. The economy boomed in the late 1990s during a period of peace and prosperity as House Republicans investigated, and impeached, Bill Clinton. https://t.co/0oS1rzn4hN

Ralph Northam's final words as he leaves his 40-minute news conference in Richmond: "I have made mistakes in my life, and I will continue to learn."
From a veteran Democratic communicator with deep experience in Virginia --&gt; https://t.co/WKVNzcwxZf
Ralph Northam's aide keeps trying to end the presser and his wife Pam looks eager to leave: "Right now, I think it's impt that we take one day at a time," he says. "We will continue to collect definitive information to prove, in addition to my word, that I'm not in that picture."
Ralph Northam on growing up: "I had a lot of African American friends .... "
Why is Ralph Northam speaking in the past tense? "This has been a tremendous learning experience," he says at news conference.
Ralph Northam says him being in blackface to pretend to be Michael Jackson at 25 for a moonwalk contest wasn't as bad as the guy who he says was not him that was in blackface next to someone in a Klan uniform: "They're both wrong, but I would hope people would see the contrast."
Ralph Northam said he's got a "good relationship" with Justin Fairfax, the LG who would replace him if he resigns.
Surreal: Ralph Northam asks for "patience" from Virginians as he launches an "investigation" that he says will include using "facial recognition" technology to try to discover who the two people were in blackface and a KKK uniform in the photo that appeared on his yearbook page.
Ralph Northam on why he put out a statement apologizing for a picture he didn't appear in: "I didn't study it as well as I should. ... It's not me. It's horrific. The fact that it was on my page was just unacceptable. So I felt the need ... to reach out and apologize."
Ralph Northam keeps giving glimpses into the damage control going on behind the scenes. Notes his roommate is getting calls and says Eastern Virginia Medical School is reviewing all of its yearbooks and will soon put out a statement saying it's unacceptable &amp; needs to change.
RT @drsfarnsworth: Part of the problem is that the Commonwealth does not let cities decide these things https://t.co/QvYEfqpeFl
Ralph Northam is asked about African American lawmakers demanding his resignation: "We need to continue to have discussions .... I will continue to do that .... to let them know we've done a good job in the first year."
Ralph Northam notes that many reporters have already reached out to his medical school roommate.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) ducks when asked whether he thinks the Confederate monuments should remain along the main drag in downtown Richmond: "That's going to be a discussion for the city of Richmond."
Ralph Northam suggests that oppo researchers working for his own campaign and both his primary/general opponents dropped the ball by not finding the yearbook: "The people who do that kind of research, perhaps they should have looked at that."
Ralph Northam joking with his wife about still being able to moonwalk in appropriate circumstances does not exactly project contrition.
Ralph Northam says he didn't have his own campaign look into his past yearbooks. "I didn't ever really think that there would be anything offensive ... 	This literally hit me like a ton of bricks last night. It caught me totally off guard."
Ralph Northam says he's never been too drunk to forget putting on a KKK uniform or blackface: "I have had several drinks over the years, but I've never been to the point where I'm not in touch with my surroundings. ... If I had dressed up like that ... I would remember that."
Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) says he's "not going to speculate or hypothesize" how a photo of a guy in blackface and a KKK uniform would "mistakenly" end up on his yearbook page.
Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) says he won the moonwalking dance contest when he blackened his face to pretend to be Michael Jackson.
Ralph Northam says he will be "in the process of gathering evidence" over the next few days. He says he asked a former classmate about the yearbook and she says lots of pictures ended up on the wrong page in that year's med school yearbook.
Ralph Northam: "Last night I finally had a chance to sit down and look at the photograph in detail. It is not me. ... I have had friends look at it and tell me that it's not me. ... I still don't have a copy of the yearbook. We're in the process of trying to obtain that."
Ralph Northam opens the door to resigning down the road. He says he will reconsider his decision to stay on "if we get to the point" where he feels he can no longer be effective.
Not even 24 hours into this story, Ralph Northam says he's ready to be forgiven.
America in 2019: The governor of Virginia is holding a news conference to insist he's never worn a KKK uniform.
Ralph Northam says he darkened his skin in 1984 in San Antonio to pretend to be Michael Jackson after graduating from medical school and while in the military.
Ralph Northam: "I have been a man of honor."
Ralph Northam is asked about his nickname being "Coonman" in the VMI yearbook: "My main nickname in high school and college was GOOSE. ... There were two individuals ... at VMI ... that called me Coonman. I don't know their motives or intent. ... I regret that."
Northam says he apologizes to the "many people" he's hurt: "I am ready to earn your forgiveness."
Defiantly, Ralph Northam says he cannot "in good conscience" resign because it would avert an "honest conversation" about racism. He says resigning would be too easy an out: "The person I was is the not man I am today. I am asking for the opportunity to earn your forgiveness."
Ralph Northam: "I am far from perfect, and I can always strive to do more, but I have devoted my entire life ... to making life for all people, no matter who they are. Today I am not ready to ask Virginians to ask forgiveness for my past actions."
Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) admits that he appeared at a dance in the mid-1980s -- in his 20s -- in San Antonio with "darkened face" as "part of a Michael Jackson costume." He says he remembers that very clearly.
Ralph Northam on the MID-1980s: "In the place and time where I grew up, many actions that we rightfully recognize are abhorrent today were commonplace."
Ralph Northam says he didn't buy his medical school yearbook so he didn't know it was there ... but he acknowledges submitting the other pics on the page.
Ralph Northam: "I will not excuse the content of the photo ... I was unaware of what was on my page. ... I believe ... that I am not either of the people in that photo."
Ralph Northam, flanked by his wife Pam in Richmond, says he will take questions: "I believe it is important for Virginians to hear directly from me and for me to answer as many questions as are necessary."

That "stonewall" quote comes from an Oval Office mtg in March 1973. Nixon gave that instruction to John Mitchell, his former attorney general and reelection chairman. The recording was played at Mitchell‚Äôs trial in late 1974. He was convicted and served 19 months in prison.
In Nov. 2017, after Credico texted Stone about a request by the House Intelligence committee to appear, the indictment says Stone responded by quoting Nixon: "Stonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan." The next day, Credico said he wouldn't testify voluntarily.
For those who don't know Roger Stone, maybe his most formative experience was working for Richard Nixon's 1972 campaign (aka CREEP). He literally has a tattoo of RMN on his back. (He was also the youth director on Reagan's 1976 campaign against Ford.) https://t.co/Thlb196zkZ
"Stone told Person 2 that Person 2 should do a ‚ÄòFrank Pentangeli,'" the indictment says.	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know nothin‚Äô about that," Pentangeli says in the movie.	The Daily 202 includes a link to the scene: https://t.co/Thlb196zkZ.
Prosecutors say Roger Stone made not just one, but repeated, references to ‚ÄúThe Godfather: Part II‚Äù in December 2017 as he pushed Randy Credico to not tell the truth to the House Intelligence Committee.
But the most memorable details from the 24-page indictment relate to the separate charges of witness tampering and obstruction of an official proceeding. As the old saying goes: It‚Äôs not the crime. It‚Äôs the cover up. Read the Daily 202: https://t.co/Thlb196zkZ.
The most politically explosive allegation in the Roger Stone indictment is that he lied to Congress by denying discussions about his advance knowledge of WikiLeaks‚Äô email dumps with anyone involved in Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats released a chilling report yesterday that outlines what the 17 federal agencies that make up the intelligence community see as the gravest threats facing the United States. What you need to know: https://t.co/sLULJDb0g6
10. ‚ÄúThere will likely be demand for greater intelligence support to *domestic* security, driven in part by concerns over the threat of terrorism, the threat posed by transnational illicit drug and human trafficking networks, and the threat to U.S. critical infrastructure."
9. "Continued federal budget uncertainty strains the [intelligence community‚Äôs] ability to make deliberative and responsive resource decisions. The outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues."
8. "The intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of WMD are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, WMD-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of WMD stockpiles."
7. ‚ÄúDespite growing awareness of cyber threats and improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come. Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace capabilities to threaten our interests..."
6. ‚ÄúAdvances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases &amp; modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to U.S. interests and security."
"Pressure points include growing influxes of migrants; ... areas of intense economic or other resource scarcity; and areas threatened by climate changes ... All of these issues will continue to drive global change on an unprecedented scale.‚Äù
5. ‚ÄúIncreasing migration and urbanization of populations are further straining the capacities of governments around the world and are likely to result in further fracturing of societies, potentially creating breeding grounds for radicalization."
4. ‚ÄúThe ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before...is undermining traditional institutions. This empowerment ... is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict..."
3. ‚ÄúNo longer a solely U.S. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the United States. ... Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness and overall security."
2. ‚ÄúRussian efforts to increase its influence and authority are likely to continue and may conflict with U.S. goals and priorities in multiple regions.‚Äù
1. ‚ÄúTraditional adversaries will continue ... taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment ‚Äî including the weakening of the post-WWII international order &amp; dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West ..."

Previous generations had Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Harold Macmillan and John Kennedy. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. In 2019, the fate of the West depends on Theresa May and Donald Trump. https://t.co/zaGrHdVN0d
The two most important beacons of freedom in the world are dimming. And just as the seas become more dangerous when lighthouses go dark, the same is true on the increasingly stormy world stage. Will January 2019 be remembered as the month that the West came unmoored?
We don‚Äôt know exactly how much Moscow spent supporting influence operations to impact the U.K. and U.S. elections in 2016, but it seems hard to overstate how good the Kremlin‚Äôs return has been on what Western intelligence agencies believe was a relatively modest investment.
Against the backdrop of the American withdrawal from Syria and President Trump‚Äôs musings about pulling out of NATO, it adds up to a strategic bonanza for Vladimir Putin and his vision of a revanchist Russia.
With the British Parliament‚Äôs lopsided rejection of Theresa May‚Äôs Brexit plan and the U.S. government shutdown in its 26th day, the two oldest and most important Western democracies are simultaneously mired in utter political chaos with no obvious way out. https://t.co/zaGrHdVN0d

Several officials said they were never able to get a reliable readout of the president‚Äôs two-hour meeting in Helsinki with Putin. Unlike in Hamburg, Trump allowed no Cabinet officials or any aides to be in the room for that conversation.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been reluctant to call attention to such reports under Trump because they have at times included comments by foreign officials disparaging the president or his advisers, including Jared Kushner, a former senior administration official tells Greg.

8. Conservative thought leaders are ready to write King out of the movement. The model is William F. Buckley‚Äôs legendary crusade against Robert Welch and the John Birch Society in the pages of National Review. King has even lost Ben Shapiro. And maybe the Club for Growth, too.
7. The donor community and the business world have turned on King. Corporate America, which has long been more supportive of immigration than other elements of the GOP coalition, has become more activist in the Trump era under pressure from employees and customers.
6. Because they now control the majority, House Democrats can force Republicans to take an on-the-record position on King. Several Democrats, led by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), are calling on leadership to take up a resolution that would formally censure King for his comments.
5. Republican presidential aspirants have been reluctant to cross King in the past because he commands a loyal following among the devoted grass-roots activists who attend low-turnout caucuses in outsize numbers, but there‚Äôs no nominating fight to worry about in 2020.
4. Iowa will be a battleground again in 2020 for president, Senate and House ‚Äì and King could be a drag on the rest of the GOP ticket. Especially Joni Ernst, who could face a tough reelect. She didn't respond to my request for comment on King.
3. Forcefully condemning King now could dissuade him from seeking a 10th term. Strategists in both parties agree that the odds of the GOP holding the northwest Iowa seat go up dramatically if he doesn‚Äôt run again.
2. King now faces a credible primary challenger, which he has not in the past. On Wednesday, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra (R) ‚Äì an assistant majority leader and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee ‚Äì announced that he will take on King for the GOP nomination.
1. The midterms showed King could be defeated. He won his ninth term in November by only three percentage points, even though Trump had carried the district by 27 points in 2016. That was without any investment by national Democrats.
Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise declined to rebuke Steve King before the election. But now they are. In addition to the substance of his comments, there are 8 other factors that make this time different: https://t.co/htAU9JgFeV

The House Intelligence Committee, which has provided testimony of its witnesses to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for a declassification review, has NOT yet turned over the official Stone transcript to Mueller, my colleagues scoop. https://t.co/pbx3sJyMw3
For weeks, Mueller's office has had access to an unofficial copy of Stone‚Äôs closed-door September 2017 interview. Mueller‚Äôs request of the official copy signals the special counsel could now be pursuing an indictment, several legal experts said.
It is unclear what aspect of Stone‚Äôs testimony Mueller is scrutinizing. But Stone has given conflicting accounts about what prompted him to accurately predict during the 2016 race that WikiLeaks was going to unleash material that would hurt Hillary Clinton.
Securing an official transcript from House Intelligence would be a necessary step before pursuing an indictment that Stone allegedly lied to lawmakers. Mueller could use the threat of false-statement charges to seek cooperation from Stone, as he did with Mike Flynn &amp; Mike Cohen.
Mueller asked House Intelligence on Friday for an official transcript of Roger Stone‚Äôs testimony, a sign that prosecutors could be moving to charge him with a crime. It's the first time he's formally requested material from the panel. https://t.co/pbx3sJyMw3

Because the Russians successfully targeted African Americans in 2016, they turned their attention to Hispanics in 2017. The goal was to divide the country by playing on identity politics. https://t.co/u7Lhcv37PX
One of the Russian accounts pushed a ‚ÄúFirearms Training Class for #BlackWomen." Emboldened by Trump‚Äôs victory, the scale of the disinformation campaign picked up substantially after the 2016 election ‚Äì especially on Instagram ‚Äì until companies cracked down last summer.
"Black Matter US‚Äù was created by Russians to push African Americans toward confrontational street protests. It had affiliated accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google, Tumblr, PayPal &amp; more.
As 2016 approached, the Russians conducted dry runs to gauge their ability to influence Americans. Before Thanksgiving in 2015, the Russians pushed totally fabricated stories that turkeys from Koch Farms and Walmart would cause food poisoning. Just to see what impact it'd have.
The Internet Research Agency used techniques that had been practiced in Eastern Europe. They even repurposed old accounts. Researchers found that one Russian account targeting an Indonesian audience in Indonesian abruptly shifted to English-language posts about U.S. politics.
The IRA's Facebook posts were shared 31 million times, liked 39 million times and generated 3.5 million comments. Their Instagram posts garnered 185 million likes and 4 million comments. Their 3,841 fake Twitter accounts posted &gt;8.5 million tweets.
The Russian campaign generated engagement that would make the marketing departments at the country‚Äôs biggest corporations envious. Between 2015 and 2017, over 30 million users shared their Facebook and Instagram posts with friends ‚Äì liking, reacting to and commenting on them.
The Russians used Facebook‚Äôs Ads Manager tool to target African Americans who were specifically interested in ‚ÄúBlack Nationalism &amp; identity,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúincarceration‚Äù and the criminal justice system. The new nonpartisan report concludes definitively that this was to help Trump.
In addition to targeting major metropolitan areas that had become hot spots in the Black Lives Matter movement, where Hillary ultimately underperformed, the Russians also microtargeted Ferguson ‚Äì attempting to reignite the flames of racial animus after the violence had died down.
A new report for the Senate, to be released later this week, says the influence operation ‚Äì run out of St. Petersburg ‚Äì was sophisticated, relentless and became more effective with time. Its goal was to manipulate identity politics to tear America apart.
On Twitter, 4 of the 5 most retweeted Russian accounts catered exclusively to African Americans. On Instagram, all 5 of the most-liked posts created by the Russians were aimed at black women.
3 of the 4 most-liked Facebook posts put up by the Russian influence effort came from an account called Blacktivist. It urged people to vote for Jill Stein in 2016. It also posted stuff like: ‚ÄúNOT VOTING is a way to exercise our rights.‚Äù
Thread: The Russians are fixated on trying to dampen African American enthusiasm about the political process generally and voting specifically. It turns out they were targeted by the Internet Research Agency with more Facebook ads than any other group, including conservatives.

Although scientists hesitate to attribute the rainfall in a single year to climate change, an increase in heavy precipitation is an expectation as the planet warms. Washington‚Äôs temperatures have risen over time, and 2018's on track to rank among the 10 warmest years on record.
In all, Washington has seen 122 days with measurable rain this year, which is not out of the ordinary considering the long-term average is 116. But very often when it has rained, it‚Äôs poured. At least an inch of rain has accumulated on a record 22 days.
The extreme rainfall in the Mid-Atlantic has stemmed from a weather pattern unleashing a parade of storms through the region since May. Except for brief pauses in the first half of July and this month, it has seldom relented.
2018 is now officially Washington DC's wettest year ever recorded, surpassing 1889. https://t.co/ISPftX1yXe https://t.co/U0V149qd5r

Citing "the crime to our democratic institutions," Judge Pauley told Cohen that ‚Äúa significant term of imprisonment is fully justified ‚Ä¶ to send a message.‚Äù 		It's one of six quotes from the hearing I highlight in this morning's Daily 202: https://t.co/tE2Bf57VvS
‚ÄúOur democratic institutions depend upon the honesty of our citizenry in dealing with the government. ... Mr. Cohen‚Äôs crimes implicate a far more insidious crime to our democratic institutions, especially in view of his subsequent plea to making false statements to Congress."
The judge described Cohen‚Äôs misdeeds ‚Äì including lying to a bank, lying to Congress and lying to the IRS ‚Äì as a ‚Äúveritable smorgasbord of criminal conduct.‚Äù But he said it's so much bigger than that...
Thread: Judge Pauley's comments during Michael Cohen's sentencing have been understandably overshadowed by all the talk of Trump's "dirty deeds," but they're notable.
But, but, but: Just because law enforcement and the independent judiciary have functioned as the founders intended so far doesn‚Äôt mean they will continue to do so. Among other things, Trump could try to pardon himself. Or his son. Or his son-in-law. Or rein in Mueller.
The system worked. In many countries, a president‚Äôs former fixer, campaign chair, deputy chair, national security adviser and foreign policy adviser wouldn't get charged with crimes ‚Äì let alone go to jail. But no one should be above the law in America. https://t.co/tE2Bf57VvS

It's almost like the rich and well connected get special treatment from the government... https://t.co/nDuWlCFASo

Pruittesque: Zinke emailed with aides about taking mtgs with billionaires. 	In April 2017, the secretary agreed to meet entrepreneur Palmer Lucky at the request of conservative activist Charles Johnson.
Billionaire developer who had ripped up wetlands &amp; lost a court fight found a sympathetic ear in Zinke. Earlier this year, he proposed changing the Endangered Species Act regulations in a way that would make it more difficult to declare protected habitat. https://t.co/nDuWlCFASo
The billionaire, Angelo Tsakopoulos, unsuccessfully challenged federal restrictions on plowing up wetlands under the Clean Water Act. In 2002, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the 9th Circuit that Tsakopoulos violated the law when he used a bulldozer to rip up wetlands.
Emails show a political donor emailed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to ask if he'd have someone senior on his staff meet with ‚Äúa very powerful billionaire" developer about a dispute with Army Corps of Engineers. Zinke replied that he'd be "glad" to take the mtg personally.
Ryan Zinke's friends refer to him in emails as "Z-MAN." https://t.co/nDuWlCFASo

After Trump won North Carolina in 2016, the Tar Heel State showed signs of staying red in federal races. Republicans won all three targeted House races, including in the kinds of suburban areas that Democrats won elsewhere. https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
These are all warning signs for Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020. (As chairman of the NRSC, Gardner played a key role in the GOP‚Äôs pick-ups but will now need to focus on defending himself.) https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
2020 watch: After Trump lost Colorado two years ago, the state turned bluer last night. Rep. Jared Polis (D) will be 1st openly gay governor. Dems swept statewide offices. Won both chambers of state legislature. Jason Crow defeated GOP Rep. Mike Coffman.
Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison (D) was elected as the state‚Äôs attorney general despite allegations of domestic abuse, which he denied, because it was such a strong night for Democrats in the state. #tribalism
Tribalism keeping Dems in line too. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez won, even though he was indicted on federal corruption charges and got off because of a mistrial. The Senate Ethics Committee ‚Äúseverely admonished‚Äù him earlier this year for accepting gifts in exchange for favors.
The midterms show how America is becoming more tribal. It looks like Chris Collins &amp; Duncan Hunter got reelected in their red districts despite facing pending trials for serious crimes. And Steve King won in Iowa after the NRCC chair publicly rebuked him. https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
One wild stat from the exits: 8 in 10 Americans who voted in the midterms believe our country is more divided *than ever.* Obviously we're not (Civil War, Vietnam, etc.) but the fact people on both sides feel that way speaks volumes about the moment. https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
Last night's results suggest that Trump could be much more formidable when he runs for reelection in 2020 than his critics want to acknowledge. E.G. Republicans held the governorships in Florida and Ohio. https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
@Olavarrieta @PowerPost https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
10) The subpoenas will start flying in January as the Trump investigations begin. 40% of voters on Tuesday wanted Trump impeached, including 77% of Democrats. But Speaker Pelosi will resist. Will Trump make a deal? https://t.co/CApq3sjszD
9) After Heitkamp, Donnelly and McCaskill lost, the Senate Democratic caucus is going to become even *more* liberal. Sherrod Brown, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Chris Murphy and Amy Klobuchar each won reelection last night. All may run for president!
7) The buzz that this would be a ‚ÄúYear of the Woman‚Äù redux came to fruition.	More than 100 women are on track to win seats in the House.	8) The Republican conferences in the House and Senate will be more Trumpian in 2019 than 2018. But Mitt Romney is the wild card to watch.
5) Candidate quality matters ‚Äì but only up to a point. That's why Amy McGrath lost and Donna Shalala won.	6) Moderate Democrats in the Midwest outperformed more ideological Democrats in the Sun Belt. There are 2020 implications.
4) The realignment is real, and it‚Äôs much harder to defy political gravity than it used to be. America was already deeply polarized when Trump took office. The president has supercharged it. Red states got redder and blue states got bluer on Tuesday.
About last night...	My 10 takeaways:	1) Backlash to Trump materialized in the suburbs.	2) Trump‚Äôs 11-rally, six-day campaign swing helped Republicans far outperform expectations in the Senate.	3) But, but, but: Not everything Trump touches turns to gold. https://t.co/CApq3sjszD

Thank you https://t.co/oEJhNrhdSl
It‚Äôs an illustration of how much the political map has really shifted since the end of World War II. (Trump, of course, didn't win New York. And Romney didn't win Massachusetts.)
Nixon and Reagan both lose in CA. Eisenhower might struggle in a Kansas GOP primary, but he‚Äôd probably make it through with establishment support. Ditto for both Bushes in Texas. Obama would handily win Illinois.
Fun parlor game: Which presidents since WW2 could carry their home states if they were able to run again? Some are debatable, but Clinton couldn‚Äôt win Arkansas, Carter couldn‚Äôt win Georgia, LBJ couldn‚Äôt win Texas and Truman couldn't win Missouri. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
Harry Truman, who would be 134 if he had not died in 1972, could not get reelected if he was on the ballot in Missouri tomorrow. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
McCaskill has worked hard to stay competitive in rural areas. She knows she‚Äôll lose them, but her goal is to avoid getting wiped out. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
Several Hawley supporters I interviewed said they haven‚Äôt changed, but the Democratic Party has. Hawley sees Trump as much the product of the ongoing realignment as the cause of it. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
Trump will return to Missouri tonight for the second time in five days. It‚Äôs his seventh visit this election cycle and will be his final rally before the midterms. Today's Daily 202 looks at why he's spending so much time there: https://t.co/EGcIWXUM3L.
McCaskill could outperform Clinton by 10 points ‚Äì and still lose. If she prevails, it will be because there is a blue wave that crests high enough. If Hawley beats her, it will be because tectonic shifts are more powerful than political head winds. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
On the eve of the midterms, Missouri might be the tightest Senate battleground. Strategists inside both campaigns describe the race as a true toss-up. Hawley opened a slight lead after the Kavanaugh donnybrook, but that bump has subsided somewhat. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl
I asked McCaskill why she invokes Truman to rally her troops. ‚ÄúI guarantee you he would have some bad language about Josh Hawley if he were here,‚Äù she said.
"Places that used to be home to what I call Harry Truman Democrats, now they're Donald Trump Republicans," said Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley. I told Hawley that McCaskill proudly considers herself a Harry Truman Democrat. ‚ÄúShe wishes,‚Äù he said.
The ghost of Harry Truman haunts the Missouri Senate race. "You know what this election is about? It's about whether or not we hold onto Harry Truman's Senate seat," Claire McCaskill told supporters in Columbia. https://t.co/EGcIWYcnsl

Trump suggested to Fox he would oppose any push from Capitol Hill to restrict future arms sales to Saudi Arabia over #Khashoggi on the grounds it could cost Americans their jobs, adding to concerns he'll try to sweep what's happened under the rug. https://t.co/FcKiptVTZS

Because of hard feelings, this person predicted Kavanaugh will be less likely to fall prey to the ‚ÄúGreenhouse Effect,‚Äù a term widely used among conservative elites to describe the historical tendency of GOP-appointed justices to moderate somewhat after joining the high court.
An interesting dynamic I've picked up in convos w/ leading conservative legal thinkers. One top mind on the right told me last night that the attacks on Kavanaugh make him even more confident that he'll remain a reliable vote for the agenda once confirmed. https://t.co/05A50ZxsYR
Angry protesters agitating against Kavanaugh have played into McConnell‚Äôs hands. A senior aide to a GOP senator emailed me a video posted by liberal activists who had screamed at his boss, confident the hostility on display would engender sympathy. https://t.co/Ffir1RnQHc
No coincidence the only two Dems who haven't opposed Kavanaugh yet are Joe Manchin (Trump won WV by 43 points) and Heidi Heitkamp (Trump won ND by 36 points.) If it looks like he'll get confirmed any way, Manchin and/or Heitkamp could join majority. https://t.co/05A50ZxsYR
Flake criticized Trump for mocking Dr. Ford yesterday (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of appalling‚Äù), but also said the comments won‚Äôt factor into his thinking about how he‚Äôll vote on Kavanaugh. GOP vote counters took that as a promising sign. https://t.co/Ffir1RnQHc

Kavanaugh said he'd be late to Beach Week because he was coming from Ireland. Told the boys they should kick out anyone who didn‚Äôt belong: "The danger of eviction is great and that would suck because of the money and because this week has big potential. (Interpret as wish.)"
"I think we are unanimous that any girls we can beg to stay there are welcomed with open ...," Kavanaugh wrote, using ellipsis at the end leaving certain things unsaid, per the NYT. https://t.co/YQKs6fqWha
Brett Kavanaugh's handwritten note to friends re Beach Week says that whoever arrived first at the condo in Ocean City should "warn the neighbors that we‚Äôre loud, obnoxious drunks with prolific pukers among us."
In "Wasted," Mark Judge refers to ‚ÄúBart O‚ÄôKavanaugh‚Äù vomiting &amp; passing out drunk in a car. Last week, Kavanaugh testified he didn‚Äôt know who that was referring to. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to ask him," he said. Now we learn that his nickname in high school was "Bart." https://t.co/Qv0slbFxee

"He obtained a copy of a photograph of a small group of friends from Yale at a 1997 wedding in order to show himself smiling alongside Ramirez 10 years after they graduated.		But when Kavanaugh was asked about the wedding ... he said he was ‚Äòprobably‚Äô at a wedding with Ramirez."
The texts obtained by @HeidiPrzybyla &amp; @LACaldwellDC show Kavanaugh and Ramirez were more socially connected than previously understood and that Ramirez was uncomfortable around Kavanaugh when they saw each other at a wedding 10 years after they graduated. https://t.co/uGoqy3DgSC

I watched every second of the hearing, and today's 202 has what I think will be the seven moments that we'll all still remember decades from now: https://t.co/fi3xAHaEYL
In the Trump era, Kavanaugh‚Äôs decision to attack Democrats more than he challenged the facts of Christine Ford's story has succeeded in galvanizing GOP senators who might have defected after Ford fared better than they expected. https://t.co/fi3xAHaEYL
Christine Ford was scared to go public because she thought her life would be upended and Kavanaugh would ultimately get confirmed anyway. Increasingly, at this hour, it seems like both those things might happen. https://t.co/fi3xAHaEYL
The Senate GOP forging ahead with the Kavanaugh vote this morning shows why Christine Ford sought to stay silent. Today's 202 has the most comprehensive round-up you will find anywhere of coverage/analysis of yesterday's hearing and where this is going: https://t.co/GtZQGib4Qr

Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) says the GOP conference will meet at 7:15 pm tonight, but for now they're still planning to vote Kavanaugh out of committee tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. He says he's "optimistic" they'll have the votes to confirm him.
The hearing has adjourned after 8 hours and 45 minutes. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) asks Kavanaugh to swear before God that he‚Äôs telling the truth. 	‚Äú100% certain,‚Äù Kavanaugh said. ‚ÄúI swear to God.‚Äù
Jeff Flake keeps cards close to vest in statement. Does not ask Kavanaugh questions but tells him, ‚ÄúWe are 21 very imperfect senators trying to do our best ‚Ä¶ in the end, there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty. ... There is doubt. We‚Äôll never move beyond that.‚Äù
Kavanaugh says he did not watch Ford's testimony. "I planned to, but I did not. I was preparing mine," he tells Kamala Harris.

@JakeSherman And a Google search reveals that he moved to San Diego in 2012 after losing in Oregon:	https://t.co/V0InzBFoIC
Judge Kavanaugh notes that he spent as much time in college with Chris Dudley as anyone else. He went on to play in the NBA and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Oregon as a Republican in 2010.
Amy Klobuchar, who also went to Yale: Have you ever been blackout drunk?	Brett Kavanaugh turns the table: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious if you have.‚Äù	He reiterates that he has not. She adds that she doesn‚Äôt have a drinking problem either.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) says her own father struggled with alcoholism for most of his life, faced consequences as a result and is still in AA at 90.
John Cornyn says this is the most unfair hearing since the Army-McCarthy hearings.
One of my earlier tweets was interpreted in a way that was not intended so I deleted it.
Kavanaugh praises @realDonaldTrump: ‚ÄúI thank him for his steadfast support.‚Äù
Kavanaugh: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ I may never be able to coach again.‚Äù
Kavanaugh: "...I may never be able to teach again."
Kavanaugh's lawyer said earlier this week that he kissed Renate. 		Renate said through her lawyer that they never kissed.		Kavanaugh side steps this issue at the hearing, saying only that they did not have sex.
"Renate Alumnus" was intended to show affection and "that she was one of us."		"I'm so sorry to her for that yearbook reference," Kavanaugh says.
Kavanaugh calls his high school yearbook "A DISASTER." He says the editors wanted it to be a mix of Animal House, Caddyshack and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. "This past week my friends and I have cringed when we read about it and talk to each other," Kavanaugh says thru tears.
Fact check on drinking age --&gt; https://t.co/ER3pjKiIoA
Will Trump see Kavanaugh's tears as weakness?
A sexual assault could have occurred on any night of the week during the summer when classes were not in session. Christine Ford did not say it was a weekend.
Does Brett Kavanaugh have detailed calendars from his time at YALE when he was in DKE and/or when Deborah Ramirez alleges that he exposed himself to her?
Kavanaugh's testimony seems much more aimed at reassuring TRUMP than trying to win over COLLINS, FLAKE or MURKOWKSI. Not to mention the independent suburban women who might cost Republicans the Senate and if they push him onto the court after all of this unfolds.
The danger of being so angry and emotional right now is that Brett Kavanaugh comes across as someone who is unable to be an impartial judge.
Brett Kavanaugh is now highlighting at length his many years as a partisan Republican operative. The related paper trail is why McConnell originally did not want Trump to pick him. I wrote about this the day after he was nominated: https://t.co/uigfqBKarO
Kavanaugh says his reputation has been ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù destroyed. Does he fear that this would shadow or taint his potential service on the Supreme Court?
Kavanaugh chokes up as he cites his 10-year-old daughter.
Brett Kavanaugh is telling the senators that his mom was the local prosecutor when he was in high school. That's when the alleged assault occurred. It's a reminder of the privileged position he held back then &amp; another reason Dr. Ford might have been reluctant to come forward.
Brett Kavanaugh says his *mom* faced workplace sexual harassment.
Brett Kavanaugh is angry, defiant, and seething as he looks toward the Democrats: ‚ÄúYou may defeat me in the final vote, but you‚Äôll never get me to quiet. Never.‚Äù
Brett Kavanaugh sounds VERY partisan in this speech. He's saying opposition to his nomination is based on ‚Äúrevenge on behalf of the Clintons‚Äù and anger that Trump won the 2016 election. Doesn't make it him sound very independent.
Kavanaugh describes Democratic efforts to stop him as "an old-fashioned attempt at Borking."
Kavanaugh is trying to make the allegations against him seem as partisan as possible. He wants it to seem partisan, but there was nothing at all to indicate during Ford‚Äôs testimony that she was motivated by partisanship.
Kavanaugh: ‚ÄúThis confirmation process has become a national disgrace. ‚Ä¶ You have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.‚Äù
Kavanaugh says his name has been ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù destroyed over the past 10 days.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) calls Professor Ford "a nice lady" but says her story is "uncorroborated," and he's confident Judge Kavanaugh will also say that he's 100% sure it did not happen.
Sen. Cornyn on Prof. Ford: "I thought she did just fine."
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) is at the mics now: "I found no reason to find her not credible."
Kamala Harris calls Professor Ford "a true patriot" and "a true profile in courage."
The long shadow of the way Anita Hill was treated clouds this hearing -- even 27 years later. If you had any doubt, each of the women on the committee has now mentioned the way Professor Hill was treated in their round of questions.
Kamala Harris: "I believe you. I believe you."

White House aides found it difficult to mobilize surrogates ‚Äî especially female high school friends and other women who know Kavanaugh personally ‚Äî to blanket the airwaves defending the judge‚Äôs character. https://t.co/r1psRk4AIJ
Many Republicans who find Trump distasteful also think Avenatti is gross. His role makes the accusations look more partisan -- and has helped harden support for Kavanaugh on the right going into today's big hearing.
‚ÄúIf I were a true victim, the last person I would go to is Michael Avenatti,‚Äù said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).		‚ÄúDemocrats Endorse Avenatti‚Äù is the headline of a pro-Kavanaugh editorial in today‚Äôs Wall Street Journal. 		LOTS more examples where those came from...
If a third accuser was going to come forward against Kavanaugh, the best thing that could have happened for the White House was for her to be represented by Michael Avenatti. 		Today's Daily 202: https://t.co/pjzwJCJzGI
32% believe Christine Ford, 26% believe Brett Kavanaugh and 42% are still unsure. 		After Anita Hill testified against Clarence Thomas in 1991, 40% believed him and 24% believed her.		Reaction to today's hearing will show what's changed &amp; what hasn't.		https://t.co/pjzwJCJzGI
Mitch McConnell headlined a fundraiser for Cramer yesterday. ‚ÄúEvery day is a Maalox moment,‚Äù the Senate majority leader told donors.

Steyer advisers tell me that he's signed off on a plan to put significant money into the Senate races in Arizona, Tennessee, Nevada, Indiana, Florida and Texas if Rosenstein gets fired. Partly this is because he thinks the Senate will be more in play if Rod fired &amp; Kav confirmed.
Tom Steyer has focused his spending on 60 competitive congressional races that could give Dems control of the House to pave the way for impeaching Trump. But he's mulling a major 7-figure investment in Senate races if Trump fires Rosenstein and Republicans confirm Kavanaugh.

Cruz asked to say something nice about Beto praises him for he authenticity of his views. Which he says are socialist.		‚ÄúI think you are absolutely sincere, like Bernie Sanders,‚Äù says Cruz. 		‚ÄúTrue to form,‚Äù says Beto, disdainfully, who had praised Cruz for public service.
@MrWalterShapiro To note that Cruz got to all 99!
Cruz says Beto is farther to the left than Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi.
Beto has repeatedly mentioned in the Texas Senate debate that he‚Äôs been to all 254 counties in the Lone Star State. We are accustomed to hearing from politicians in Iowa about going to all 99 counties there. But this is a very novel thing in Texas. #TXSenateDebate

@davidharsanyi Trump appointees are saying that because it is the administration's position. The stories quote sources inside the FBI and alumni of the process saying otherwise. There's also precedents, including Clarence Thomas and John Tower.
That's from an deeply-reported, fact-check story by @joshgerstein: https://t.co/gAzxHHtkyd.
"The normal procedure for this would have been to send the FBI out. ‚Ä¶ It seems to me you could have this done in a day or two, actually. ‚Ä¶ I actually was surprised ... that the committee decided to just have hearings on Monday ... without the benefit of additional information.‚Äù
Even John Yoo, a senior DOJ official under George W. Bush who wrote "the torture memos," says he's surprised Senate Republicans are pushing Kavanaugh through without an FBI investigation into the sexual assault allegations against him.
Several officials from both parties who have had direct roles in FBI background checks and the SCOTUS nomination process say that the claims being made by Trump and Grassley are false. https://t.co/rWD8ZH3xia
This is all especially rich and ironic against the backdrop that the FBI might have gotten Trump elected in 2016 with the way it handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation...
The changing GOP attitudes toward the FBI, thanks to Trump, have given air cover for McConnell, Grassley, and Senate Republicans to reject Dr. Ford‚Äôs pleas for an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. This wasn't tenable in 1991 when Anita Hill came forward.
Since early 2017, the share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents with a positive view of the FBI has fallen 16 points, from 65% to 49%, according to recent Pew polling. Among Rs, FBI now has a 49/44 fav/unfav. In 2016, it was 65/21! Dem views are unchanged.
Trump‚Äôs relentless attacks on the FBI because of the investigation into him, including calling it a "cancer" just this week, have been echoed by his allies and surrogates on Fox News. This has taken a toll on the image of the bureau among Republicans.
But an underappreciated factor that‚Äôs different from 1991: perceptions of the FBI have flipped. The bureau used to be seen by the right as an avatar of law-and-order. It was the left that mistrusted the FBI as big brother after surveillance of MLK, the antiwar movement, etc, etc.
‚ÄúMy belief is that, without an investigation, there cannot be an effective hearing,‚Äù Anita Hill told @JudyWoodruff on PBS ‚ÄúNewsHour" last night, endorsing Christine Ford‚Äôs plea for a nonpartisan FBI probe into her allegations.
Back in 1991, when Professor Anita Hill alleged that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her, George H.W. Bush's White House ‚Äì in consultation with Senate Republicans ‚Äì asked the FBI to investigate. It only took the bureau three days to send back an updated report.
Thread: What‚Äôs most striking about the past 24 hrs is how rank-and-file GOP lawmakers, including women &amp; moderates, are falling in line behind McConnell's hardball strategy to confirm Kavanaugh with no FBI investigation or testimony from Professor Ford. https://t.co/rWD8ZH3xia
Trump‚Äôs simultaneous attacks on the FBI‚Äôs investigation into his 2016 campaign and refusal to ask the bureau to investigate an allegation of sexual assault against his Supreme Court nominee are impossible to separate. They're inextricably linked: https://t.co/rWD8ZH3xia

It's no surprise that alleged witness and Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge doesn't want to answer questions under oath and will not appear voluntarily, but it would only take two Senate Republicans to agree to subpoena him and compel him to appear. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
‚ÄúFortunately,‚Äù Kavanaugh said in 2015, ‚Äúwe had a good saying that we've held firm to to this day, which is: ‚ÄòWhat happens at Georgetown Prep, stays at Georgetown Prep.‚Äô I think that's been a good thing for all of us!‚Äù Will the Senate let it stay that way? https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
Shine‚Äôs role in prepping Kavanaugh is notable because of his scandal-plagued tenure as co-president of Fox News. He was pushed out of the cable network last year after multiple lawsuits suggested that he enabled alleged sexual harassment by Roger Ailes, his boss for 20 years.
Participants in the session included White House counsel Don McGahn, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and deputy chief of staff Bill Shine.
Kavanaugh had a two-hour ‚Äúmurder board‚Äù yesterday at the Eisenhower Office Building to rehearse for next week. The judge practiced answering tough questions about his past, his partying, his drinking, his dating and Ford‚Äôs allegations. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
The odds of such a takeover are quite low, but a *Majority Leader* Chuck Schumer could theoretically keep the seat open through the 2020 election ‚Äì following the precedent McConnell invented when he refused to allow a hearing for Merrick Garland in 2016. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
Mitch McConnell, who calls the shots way more than Chuck Grassley, is eager to move quickly so that he can avoid his nightmare scenario in which Kavanaugh, or a replacement nominee, wouldn‚Äôt get confirmed before the midterms and then Democrats win control of the Senate.

Dr. Ford has received death threats, her email's been hacked and she‚Äôs being impersonated online. Her family fled their home. She &amp; her husband are staying apart from their kids as a safety precaution. Unlike Kavanaugh, she does not get a security detail. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
The push to move ahead with no formal investigation of Dr. Ford's allegations underscores why victims generally hesitate to come forward, advocates say, and the vitriol she's faced explains why she wanted to stay anonymous until Sunday. https://t.co/bc8tk64BSD
Professor Ford's eagerness to talk to FBI investigators is significant because she knows making a false statement to the bureau would be a felony. Just ask Mike Flynn, George Papadopoulos and Rick Gates. It shows her seriousness &amp; bolsters her credibility. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
Professor Ford‚Äôs lawyers say quotes like the one from Lindsey Graham about a "drive-by shooting," prove that Republicans have already pre-judged their client‚Äôs claims and thus showcase why an independent investigation is needed. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
As I wrote yesterday, even before Ford came forward, Kavanaugh was already the least popular and most polarizing nominee to the Supreme Court since Robert Bork in 1987. https://t.co/VJ5oIrtpYQ
There is a danger for Republicans that this kind of brusque rhetoric toward a purported victim of sexual assault will be perceived as bullying by voters, especially the college-educated, suburban women who are poised to determine which party controls the House come November.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), No. 3 in GOP leadership, says Dr. Ford is ‚Äúnot really in a position to make conditions.‚Äù		‚ÄúI‚Äôll listen to the lady, but we‚Äôre going to bring this to a close," adds Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). "We run the committee ‚Äì not her lawyer, not the Democrats.‚Äù
Contrary to some semi-misleading coverage that‚Äôs out there this morning, Ford still wants to testify in a public setting. Moreover, the two-page letter from her lawyers does not explicitly say she will not come next Monday if there‚Äôs no FBI probe. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115
Senate Republicans say they'll forge ahead with a hearing next Monday whether Christine Blasey Ford is there or not, a take-it-or-leave-it gambit to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court before the end of the month that risks backfiring politically. https://t.co/bc8tk5N115

How Ted Cruz handles Mrs. Ford's allegations could determine whether he survives in November. He's the only vulnerable Republican who sits on the relevant committee, and he's on tape saying this month he‚Äôs been good friends with Kavanaugh for 20 years.  https://t.co/PjLshSYrHg
Under fire for her handling of a sexual assault case involving service members under her command, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said during her 2014 campaign that she had faced sexual harassment while in the military. What will she do about Brett Kavanaugh? https://t.co/PjLshSYrHg
Just as in 1991, all 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee are still white men. (4 of the 10 Democrats are women.) https://t.co/PjLshSYrHg
A lot's changed since Anita Hill came forward in 1991, but a lot hasn't:	Trump was elected in 2016 after the disclosure of the ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù video and 13 women claimed he physically touched them inappropriately.
It's a high-profile illustration of how social mores have changed in a relatively short time about how sexual misconduct by young men should be treated. https://t.co/PjLshSYrHg
In June, Persky was removed from office as the result of a recall campaign organized by #MeToo activists who felt the judge let Turner off too easy because of male privilege.
Explaining his leniency, Judge Persky pointed to Turner‚Äôs age, that both he and the victim were drunk &amp; that a harsher sentence could have had a ‚Äúsevere‚Äù impact on Turner‚Äôs life. Turner was released after 3 months due to "good behavior" behind bars, which created an uproar.
Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to 6 months in prison, even after the 23-year-old victim read an emotional 7,000-word statement explaining how the incident traumatized her.
Brock Turner was 19 and a star swimmer at Stanford when 2 grad students spotted him on top of an unconscious woman after a frat party in 2016. Turner was convicted by a jury of three felonies, including assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated person.
Kavanaugh accuser Christine Ford lives in Palo Alto, where the Brock Turner saga has been a HUGE issue for the past two years now. It's relevant to consider --&gt;
The allegations against Kavanaugh can be judged against the backdrop of the 9 members of Congress who have lost their jobs because of sex scandals in the past year, plus Roy Moore and Alex Kozinski. https://t.co/PjLshSYrHg

A chorus of Democrats is joining Cory Booker's civil disobedience to release concealed records about Kavanaugh's record. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) says that if Booker is going to be punished, "Count me in too!"
Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, is rallying to Cory Booker's defense and encouraging his civil disobedience: "I concur with what you're doing. Let's jump into this pit together. If there's going to be some retribution against [Booker], I want to be part of this process!"
Sen. Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.) says he reserves the right to disclose confidential documents from Kavanaugh's time in the Bush White House that are key for Americans to see. "We are literally trying to get at the truth here," he says.
Sen. Dick Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is citing the NYT op-ed and the Woodward book to say that the crisis in the White House makes it urgent that Kavanaugh's secret documents from the Bush WH be released. "Shame on my colleagues if they conceal them now," he says to Republicans.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) says the Republican process is "illegitimate" so he does not feel bound by their rules restricting the discussion of Brett Kavanaugh's secret documents. "Nothing classified, nothing confidential and nothing personal has been disclosed," he says.
Cory Booker is daring Senate Republicans to hold him in contempt for publicly releasing damaging documents about Brett Kavanaugh that they've been trying to conceal from the public. Booker says they'll show that hiding the emails is not justified.
John Cornyn tells Cory Booker what he's doing is "irresponsible and outrageous."		He calls it "conduct unbecoming a senator."
Breaking: Cory Booker says he is going to "knowingly violate" the Senate rules and release one of emails that's being concealed by Republicans from Brett Kavanaugh's White House service. He says it's "civil disobedience."

Brett Kavanaugh names his seven favorite Federalist Papers: 78 (judicial independence), 69 (presidency not a monarchy), 10 (factions good), 37 + 39 (the meanings of laws change over time), 47 (accumulation of power in one body is tyranny), 51 (the fallibility of men).
A few minutes ago, Brett Kavanaugh talked about the importance of "process" for a judge hearing all sides of a case, etc.		Now he just said: ‚ÄúRushed decisions in a judicial context sometimes aren‚Äôt always the best.‚Äù		It's like he's trolling Democrats re process for his hearing.

Sheldon Whitehouse just used the term "bollocksed up" -- an underused phrase -- to complain that the Trump White House has not formally asserted executive privilege but cannot be challenged in court because Senate Republicans won't issue a subpoena for them.
Sheldon Whitehouse, Democratic senator from Rhode Island, is going hard at Brett Kavanaugh over the Trump White House's claims of executive privilege to withhold more than 100,000 pages of documents from his tenure in the Bush White House.
Brett Kavanaugh will not offer any assurance that he would uphold a congressional statute requiring insurance companies to cover preexisting conditions. "I can't give assurances on a specific hypothetical," he says.

Kavanaugh says he's going to continue teaching and coaching while on the Supreme Court.
Neil Gorsuch did not bring his children to his confirmation hearing last year for reasons that were never specified or discussed during the hearing.
Lindsey Graham says he likes to think that he had something to do with Trump tapping Kavanaugh -- and notes that he got nominated on his birthday -- and that it was like a birthday gift.
Asked if he's ever made a decision that bothered him personally, Kavanaugh deflects by talking about how *Anthony Kennedy* was uncomfortable with his vote on flag burning. Critics say that Kavanaugh is an outcomes-based judge who works backwards from the ruling he wants to reach.
Brett Kavanaugh says he still has the dogged-eared edition of "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD" that he read in sixth grade. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my chambers,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSame copy!‚Äù
Lindsey Graham is using his time to let Kavanaugh clean up his answers during a pretty rough round with Pat Leahy. The judge says he was never aware that he was receiving hacked emails that were stolen from Senate staffers by a GOP staffer while he was a White House lawyer.
After Brett Kavanaugh refuses to say that it is not okay for Trump to pardon himself on the grounds that it's a hypothetical question, Pat Leahy replies: ‚ÄúI hope for the sake of the country that it stays a hypothetical!"
Brett Kavanaugh refuses to weigh in on whether Trump can pardon himself: ‚ÄúThe question of self-pardons is something I‚Äôve never analyzed. ... [It's] a hypothetical question that I can‚Äôt begin to answer as a sitting judge.‚Äù
Among the documents apparently being concealed from the public: Brett Kavanaugh's correspondence with John Yoo, who wrote the notorious "torture memos."
Chuck Grassley will not commit to the public release of committee confidential documents that could shed light on Brett Kavanaugh's possible role in secret *warrantless* wiretapping after 9/11.
Kavanaugh does not appear to be firmly ruling out that he was involved in standing up *warrantless* surveillance programs after 9/11. "I can't rule anything out. There was so much going on in the wake of Sept. 11th," he said. "Every day for the next couple of yrs was Sept. 12th."
Pat Leahy's cross-examination of Kavanaugh is raising lots of questions about what specifically the Trump White House is trying to hide by claiming privilege over more than 100,000 pages of Kavanaugh's files from the Bush White House.
Speaking of the secret documents that Republicans won't allow Democrats to talk about publicly, Pat Leahy tells Kavanaugh: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs evidence that (Manny) Miranda provided you with materials that were stolen from me, and that would contradict your prior testimony.‚Äù
Fireworks: Pat Leahy is suggesting that there are confidential emails being concealed from the public which show that Kavanaugh was more enmeshed in the scandal stemming from the hacking of Senate Democratic emails than he's acknowledging while in the Bush White House.
Pat Leahy asked if Kavanaugh ever got email with info that came from a "Democratic mole." 	"I'm not going to rule anything out," Kavanaugh replies. "If I did, I wouldn't have thought that in the literal meaning of that. ... Is there such an email, senator?"
A forgotten dark chapter of the Bush years: A senior Senate GOP staffer hacked into Democratic email accounts, passed along some of the pilfered contents to senior Bush White House officials -- including Kavanaugh apparently -- and never faced any criminal consequences.
Where is Manny Miranda now?
Brett Kavanaugh essentially just admitted that he'd overturn Chevron deference if he gets on the court. This is the biggest reason why big business is so pumped about him and has spent millions to get him confirmed. It would dramatically undermine the administrative state.
Kavanaugh is interrupted by a female protester as the judge answers a question about sexual harassment charges against a mentor who he clerked for.

Orrin Hatch uses his questions to ask Kavanaugh to talk about how important diversity is to him. "The best include women," says the judge.
Linda Greenhouse was not on my bingo card for today's Kavanaugh hearing.
MUSIC TO TRUMP'S EARS: Can a sitting president be required to respond to a subpoena? ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a hypothetical question,‚Äù Kavanaugh said, declining to answer.
Kavanaugh is distancing himself from the 2009 University of Minnesota law review article by drawing a distinction between a legal opinion and an article: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never, never taken a position on the Constitution on that question.‚Äù
Kavanaugh cites 9/11 to explain his flip-flop on executive power from Clinton to Bush. ‚ÄúWhat changed was Sept. 11. That‚Äôs what happened," he said.
Kavanaugh on Roe vs. Wade: ‚ÄúIt is an important precedent of the supreme court. It has been reaffirmed many times. ‚Ä¶ and I understand the significance of the issue ‚Ä¶ I always try and I do hear of the real world effects of that decision.‚Äù
Kavanaugh on Roe: "I don't live in a bubble. I live in the real world."

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) says Dick Durbin‚Äôs suggestion that Brett Kavanaugh perjured himself during his previous confirmation hearing about his role in George W. Bush‚Äôs torture programs is ‚ÄúABSURD.‚Äù
Kavanaugh is sitting stone faced as Durbin, for all intents and purposes, accuses him of perjury.
Dick Durbin, the No. 2 in Senate Dem leadership, says that ‚Äúauthoritarian forces‚Äù are ‚Äúthreatening our democracy‚Äù and insists that Kavanaugh thinks "Donald John Trump" is "above the law."
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) is now accusing Kavanaugh of not telling the truth about his involvement in torture during his confirmation hearing to the DC Circuit. He notes that this was an issue near and dear to John McCain's heart.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) says he's worked with Kavanaugh for 18 years. When he was the AG of TX, Kav helped him prep for a Supreme Court oral argument in favor of allowing school prayer at high school football games. They lost that case 6 to 3. (Kennedy was in the majority.)
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) says Kavanaugh showed good judgement by marring a Texas woman ("Ashley from Abilene"). ‚ÄúSo I know he‚Äôs a good judge," says Cornyn.
John Cornyn says Democrats aren't really freaking out about Kavanaugh because they don't know about his record -- but because they do know his record.
Any claim that this Kavanaugh hearing is transparent is ‚ÄúORWELLIAN," says Pat Leahy.		‚ÄúHow ridiculous," replies Chuck Grassley.		"You wouldn‚Äôt hire an intern when you couldn‚Äôt see 90% of their resume, but you‚Äôre putting someone on the Supreme Court," Cory Booker interjects.

If you have WATERGATE on your Kavanaugh Bingo Card, Pat Leahy just referred to the scandal that brough down Nixon three times during his opening statement. He argues that Kavanaugh is the first nominee since before Watergate not to be fully vetted.
This is in the weeds, but actually a very important point: Pat Leahy notes that no privilege log has been produced so it's not clear which Kavanaugh documents are being concealed from the Senate. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs being hidden," he says.
Pat Leahy is the 1st Democrat to bring up Trump's tweets yesterday that the DOJ shouldn't prosecute elected Republicans. Says POTUS picked Kavanaugh because of his expansive view on executive power. "It's Alice in Wonderland," says Leahy.
Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) has served in the Senate 44 years and voted on 19 Supreme Court nominations. "I have a sense of history. I have never seen in those 44 years so much at stake with a single seat, and I‚Äôve also never seen such a dangerous rush to fill it." #Kavanaugh

John Kerry: "The president uses tweets as a weapon of mass distraction, and he obviously has exposed the world to the potential of a weapon of mass destruction in Iran by pulling out of a deal that everybody in the world supports."
On Trump attacking him, John Kerry says: "I'm really not going to get into a back-and-forth on tweets. You know, I could give him a nickname, AGENT ORANGE or something, and I could get into a back and forth, but it doesn't take you anywhere."

Chuck Grassley says he's been in the Senate for 15 Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and he's never seen such a circus and the minority party has never interrupted as much as they are during this past hour.
If you haven't been following this SCOTUS process fight for the past month, Republicans claim that they've released more documents by shear numbers than previous nominees. Democrats reply by noting that it's still a tiny fraction of Kavanaugh's total record at the White House.

But the WH has also declined to answer specific questions about Melania‚Äôs pathway to citizenship. In Aug. 2016, Trump said she'd hold a press conference in the next couple of weeks. It never happened. Just like he never released his tax returns.
The White House declined to answer questions about whether this is hypocritical. ‚ÄúThey are not part of the administration,‚Äù Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said of the Knavses.
Trump wants to end what he denigrates as "chain migration," even though that's how three of his son Barron‚Äôs four grandparents came to America.
Viktor and Amalija Knavs were able to become U.S. citizens because their daughter, Melania, sponsored them. Trump decries this form of family reunification and has moved aggressively to block other parents from following their children to America.
Trump is the do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do president. He ripped Obama for vacationing to Martha‚Äôs Vineyard and told voters he‚Äôd be too busy to golf if he won. Yesterday, Trump hit the links on his 11-day vacation -- as his in-laws became citizens because of "chain migration."

Hoping today's Daily 202 does not get caught in spam filters because I quote a Michigan pollster named Bernie Porn... https://t.co/sJDLDMXIPg
Being Lt. Gov. is still worth more than a bucket of spit: 14 current govs were LGs. Sex scandals forced the MO &amp; AL govs to resign. The govs of SC, IA &amp; KS stepped down to become Trump ambassadors. Indiana's LG moved up when Pence was tapped for VP. https://t.co/pRMSk1Ly8i
Obamacare is another significant factor: In Michigan and Ohio, the LGs supported their governors when they chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act while the AGs who beat them sued in court to try to kill the law. They both ran attack ads on the subject.
It‚Äôs also much easier to build a brand and grow name recognition as an attorney general, especially in these litigious times, or a secretary of state, with voting rights and election security on the front-burner.
They‚Äôre perceived as part of the political establishment, even if they‚Äôre not. They struggle to build their own brand outside the shadow of the governor, even if they‚Äôre elected separately.
Being a state‚Äôs second-in-command is not the stepping stone it used to be. Trump‚Äôs support for Schuette, Kobach and Kemp is part of the story, but the explanation is more complicated. Lieutenant governors are hostage to a lot of prevailing winds that are beyond their control.
The only sitting lieutenant governor to actually win a GOP primary this year was Idaho‚Äôs Brad Little, and perhaps that was because his opponent was four-term congressman Raul Labrador.
2018 has been a historically abysmal year for GOP lieutenant governors running for governor:	Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle lost by 39 points in the runoff 2 weeks ago.	Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor lost by 20 points in a May primary.	Oklahoma Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb only got 24%.
If the polls are correct, Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley will lose by double digits in today‚Äôs GOP primary for governor. Former Lt. Gov. Jeff Colyer could also lose in Kansas after Trump endorsed Kobach. These are 2 more proofpoints to a bigger trend. https://t.co/pRMSk239wS

A @QuinnipiacPoll last month found 49% of registered voters believe Trump is ‚Äúracist,‚Äù while 47% think he's not. Half the country thinks the main motive for Trump's immigration policies is ‚Äúa sincere interest in controlling our borders." 44% say ‚Äúracist beliefs" motivate him.
Trump was emboldened by his political resiliency after last August's firestorm: ‚Äú3 former aides said the takeaway from Charlottesville is the nihilistic notion that nothing matters except for how things play,‚Äù writes Politico‚Äôs @anniekarni. https://t.co/i04rwM2BVU
This weekend‚Äôs attacks on the intelligence of three super successful African American leaders illustrates how Trump has not changed in the year since he said there were ‚Äúsome very fine people on both sides‚Äù in Charlottesville.
Donald Trump was for LeBron James before he was against him. He used to praise the NBA star -- right up until he called him a ‚Äúbum.‚Äù
"The eminent Stanford University historian George M. Fredrickson wrote a groundbreaking book, ‚ÄòThe Black Image in the White Mind,‚Äô in which he documented the white obsession during the 19th and early 20th centuries with measuring the supposedly deficient size of black brains..."
Michael Powell, on the sports front in today‚Äôs NYT, calls Trump's criticism of James ‚Äúmore evidence that a master of the dog whistle occupies the White House and that black athletes are a favorite target.‚Äù https://t.co/lBRYRuMPL3
As a leader of the ‚Äúbirther‚Äù movement, Trump also routinely questioned Obama‚Äôs intelligence. He claimed with no basis in reality that the first black president was ‚Äúa terrible student‚Äù &amp; demanded the release of his transcripts from Columbia University and Harvard Law.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Trump is wrong about Waters. ‚Äú[There are] a lot of things ... you could say about Maxine Waters, but to indicate she‚Äôs not a bright person is not one of them,‚Äù he told @chucktodd, adding that the GOP is ‚Äúnot anti-black.‚Äù
. @jaketapper asked @DevalPatrick if Trump's attack on @KingJames was "yet another example of the president's racism.‚Äù The former head of the DOJ civil rights division replied: ‚ÄúWell, you know, it's hard to argue with that."
He hasn't changed. A week before the anniversary of his botched response to the fatal violence in Charlottesville, Trump personally attacked the intelligence of 3 prominent African Americans: LeBron James, Don Lemon and Maxine Waters. Today's Daily 202: https://t.co/LnWkORKov8

The winner of last month‚Äôs crowded Republican primary for governor, whose spokeswoman is Gov. LePage‚Äôs daughter, has endorsed his hard-line approach. It could cost him the general election. (4/4)

Wilkie defended Trent Lott in 2003, shortly after the majority leader lost his post for praising Strom Thurmond‚Äôs 1948 presidential campaign that opposed intermingling of races. He said that Lott was simply trying to be ‚Äúgracious to an American icon.‚Äù
When Tom Daschle‚Äôs office circulated a resolution calling for equal pay for women, Wilkie marked up the draft with edits that called on Congress to require all young women to finish high school as a condition of receiving welfare, a Daschle staffer recalls.
Wilkie publicly attacked Harvey Gantt, the mayor of Charlotte, for having ‚Äúopenly courted money from the homosexual community."
Wilkie left Capitol Hill in the mid-1990s to mount a failed bid for Congress and later served as executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party as Helms was engaged in a contentious reelection campaign against Democrat Harvey Gantt. (Remember: https://t.co/2KD6vLfJDA)
Trump's VA pick was, as recently as 2005, a fixture at the annual memorial ceremonies in DC held by descendants of Confederate veterans on the birthday of Jefferson Davis. He was also a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends public Confederate symbols.
Earlier this year he led efforts to justify Trump‚Äôs ban on transgender troops. In 1997, he rebutted a Democratic proposal to ensure equal pay for women. And in 1993, he publicly defended a failed push by Helms to support an organization whose logo included the Confederate flag.
Robert Wilkie started as a young aide to Jesse Helms, then became a top aide to Trent Lott and was in Don Rumsfeld's inner circle as the US lost Iraq.

Asked in 2016 about whether his overheated rhetoric was to blame for physical clashes and violence at his rallies, Trump replied: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt accept responsibility.‚Äù
Trump claimed credit when the stock market went up, but aides said he bears no responsibility for when the markets go down.
Trump blamed "the generals" when he authorized a raid in Yemen that led to the death of a Navy SEAL. ‚ÄúThey lost Ryan," he said on Fox News.
When a judge blocked his travel ban as unconstitutional, @realDonaldTrump said: ‚ÄúIf something happens, blame him..."
When it looked like the tax cuts might not pass last October, Trump declared matter-of-factly during a Cabinet meeting: ‚ÄúI'm not going to blame myself, I'll be honest.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe'll let Obamacare fail,‚Äù the president told reporters at the White House last summer. ‚ÄúWe're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it.‚Äù		‚ÄúAny increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats..."
Blaming others for the consequences of his policies is a feature, not a bug, of Trumpism. Some direct quotes from Trump: 	"...I‚Äôll find some kind of an excuse.‚Äù	"...all of the problems that we‚Äôre having ‚Ä¶ I say it‚Äôs very strongly the Democrats‚Äô fault."	https://t.co/lh6wuH2QCb

‚ÄúSenior Trump strategists‚Äù said Friday that Trump believes he can use these kids as bargaining chips to force Democrats to negotiate a broader deal. Remember: Trump also sought to use the ‚Äúdreamers‚Äù as bargaining chips earlier this year. https://t.co/aQ6o0nwwyD
In a very rare statement, first lady Melania Trump (an immigrant herself) calls for the government to show ‚Äúheart‚Äù when enforcing the law. But her daughter-in-law, who claims family issues as her portfolio, has refused to say anything on the separation policy.
Rudy Giuliani said on CBS‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation‚Äù that Sessions is ‚Äúnot giving the president the best advice‚Äù on how to handle this situation: ‚ÄúI know President Trump doesn't like the children taken away from their parents. Jeff is not giving the president the best advice!‚Äù
‚ÄúNobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers‚Äô arms,‚Äù said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, on NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMeet the Press.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has got a conscience... I will tell you that nobody likes this policy.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe policy is incredibly complicated, and it is one we need to do a better job of communicating,‚Äù said Marc Short, the president‚Äôs liaison to Capitol Hill.
A month after Sessions announced the ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy, Trump administration officials alternate erratically between defending the initiative, distancing themselves, blaming Dems, trying to use it as leverage for negotiations with Congress or denying that it exists at all.
‚ÄúWe do not have a policy of separating families at the border,‚Äù said DHS Secretary. ‚ÄúPeriod.‚Äù	‚ÄúIt was a simple decision by the administration to have a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry,‚Äù said Trump domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller. ‚ÄúPeriod.‚Äù
