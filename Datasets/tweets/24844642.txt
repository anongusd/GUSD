@nckrieger @DavidEggert00 because you're only paying 617. The 10yrs you're talking about is from an old Senate bill we never took up

@nckrieger @MCmuckraker Thus it is an appropriation and the district will not be indebted by the action. In fact, they end up ahead.
@nckrieger @MCmuckraker Regarding the 8th para, district does not pay back any "loan." The state pays itself, b/c $ comes from a loan fund
@nckrieger @MCmuckraker ...which was 515 (pre emergency funding in May, would now be 467) plus 200 startup (2/2)

Started DVR'ing HBO's Jinx miniseries tonight. I'd say 'no spoilers,' but I've been on the internet in the past week, so.... never mind.
Wow - @LizMair out right after she got in with Scott Walker. Her criticisms of the Iowa caucuses actually did her in http://t.co/uuI9qXejNq
@MaizeSombrero I can make sure I do, if that's how this works.
Sad to see Wasserman Schultz will not be running for Senate. Glad to see she'll stay in charge of the DNC.
@Kyle_Feldscher That's not unethical is it?  Because then I might have to resign, too.
Went into a meeting. Came out an hour later and Hillary Clinton had another scandal. Wondering what tomorrow's will be.
