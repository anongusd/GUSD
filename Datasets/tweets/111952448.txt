@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts I appreciate that a lot. I don't hate you either and I don't think you're a bad person. Looking forward to more civil discourse in the future.
This is such a bad look for George. In what world should elected officials consider it ok to mock, taunt, and generally be aggressive and weirdly defensive towards voters? The answer is never. Sad, really #copolitics https://t.co/NA1uzNFNqA
@JonMurray We obviously need to get coffee and talk about this
@GeorgeBrauchler George - you seem very angry. I hope you don't carry that back to your day job anymore.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Again, voter fraud isn't a thing. It's really not. But foreign interference was huge in 2018 and is a major problem with social media. I don't really know how to fix it, honestly.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts I think these are not bad ideas.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts and I should note - most of those "fraud" cases wouldn't have been fixed with an ID. It's stuff like a man filling out his wife's mail-in ballot, or someone who's moved or changed their name voting with the old information.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts There is no evidence whatsoever that voter fraud has ever impacted an election, ever. If you have seen some evidence from a reputable news source, of course feel free to share it. But I promise you, it's not a thing. Like I said, less than 200 cases in the country in 5 years.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts I want to be clear, too - I don't think all Republicans are racists. I think the GOP keeps trying to put into place racist voter ID laws b/c it's essentially like gerrymandering - they can't hold onto power in certain districts w/out them
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts The best way to do it is to get rid of voter ID laws. They aren't necessary. There's no real problem with voter fraud. Lots of states don't have any voter ID laws - they are a waste of taxpayer dollars and they bar ppl from their constitutional right to vote
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Good question. The reason they impact people of color is b/c they were designed to do that. That's the whole point - it is now, and it was historically. Though actually the GOP does it now mostly doing it bc Black voters tend to be heavily Democrat.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Actually, it is basically non existent. It has happened less than 200 times in 5 years in the nation, and has never once swayed the impact of an election.
@Adam_Estroff Are you getting involved in any of the campaigns? Emerge has some strong candidates running! https://t.co/emzeNy61lr
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Here's a good article about recent efforts. Trump is actively racist - he continuously backs policies to specifically harm Mexican Americans, immigrants, and Black people. And he's virulently pushing voter ID laws. https://t.co/ctwa8B5Lum
@GeorgeBrauchler I'll take your silence as the answer. I'm not feeling great about an elected official staying silent on gender pay gap issues, esp since you brought it up. Next time you decide to use your political platform to comment on laws that are out of your jurisdiction, pls think first.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts AND voter ID laws are STILL being propagated today and barring lots of people from their constitutional right to vote. That and the President keeps pushing false narratives about voter fraud to justify those laws. It's a real problem, with real results, right now
@SageNaumann @EmergeColorado Ah - what I said was don't call an *elected official with a title* sweetie. You can call me sweetie all day long! My grandma does and I love my grandma.
@GeorgeBrauchler So...are you concerned about the burden pay discrimination places on women and working families? Hm? Or should I take your silence as the answer? #copolitics
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Actually new voter id laws that led to hundreds of thousands of Dem-leaning Black people and poor people being turned away at the polls arguably led to Trump winning states like Philadelphia and North Carolina that have new laws - some of the strictest in history.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts No it doesn't. It actually goes back to very well-documented in-writing statements in which elected officials - and not always Republicans, earlier on - actively stated that they wanted to bar black people from voting. I can't look it up right now, but you can.
@GeorgeBrauchler And do the legal fees of businesses fall under your jurisdiction? If not, would love to know what your personal opinions are on the gender pay gap.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Since then we've seen a massive proliferation of voting ID laws that specifically target Black voters and poor communities without any real proof of voter fraud at all. They're built to keep Black people from voting.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts level without them going through federal court. Hundreds of laws attempted in these states were ruled unconstitutional and racist over the course of 50 years until the SCOTUS gutted the voting rights act in the mid 2010's.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts For literally nearly a hundred years, voter ID laws and the myth of voter fraud has been used to suppress voting access for Black Americans and people of color. So much so that the Voting Rights Act barred states with a history of voter suppression from passing laws at the state

@GeorgeBrauchler What are you going to do, Sir, to protect women in your district from well-documented pay discrimination based on gender? #copolitics
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Wanna get coffee? Hard to connect over twitter
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Again - the argument that anything that requires an ID is the same is...wrong. Won‚Äôt debate that. Look up the history of voter ID laws
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Well it came off very very aggressive and didn‚Äôt seem very curious about the issue as much as interested in changing the subjecr
Everyone come watch an elected office who‚Äôs supposed tor reinforce laws feign concern about sexism in a conversation where he craps on a potential law to protect women from sexism at work. THIS is what structural sexism looks like. #copolitics #coleg #copols https://t.co/Y6OArYTtB8
@GeorgeBrauchler @schotts Sexism is structural, institutionalized oppression that requires both power and discrimination. So it's actually very hard for women to oppress anyone. That said, yes, protecting Biz is important. STILL waiting for your concerns about women being underpaid. #copolitics #copols
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts If you actually want to learn about the deeply racist - and OUTSPOKENLY racist (it's not even hidden - its often IN the law language itself) of voter ID laws, let me know. Or you can literally google it. But don't @ me just to fight. I'm really not interested.
@cbiemiller @josephmarsh @schotts Here to have a conversation, don't @ me. You weren't trying to talk - you were trying to embarrass me and prove you were right. Which you aren't. The data doesn't lie, the court cases don't lie. And I have no interest engaging w/ anonymous twitter accounts who R just baiting ppl
@GeorgeBrauchler @schotts Did I say it's of no concern? Absolutely not. I'm just tired of men who are more willing to speak up about protecting themselves than about protecting women.

@flynnboulder @GaryWockner You seem really angry. You may want to go do some yoga or something. And if you think "white man" is an insult or "hateful" it seems like you have your own problems to deal with. Don't @ me again.
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner P.S. @flynnboulder asking women to do the emotional/intellectual labor of explaining this to you, in the way that you did it, is rude &amp; patriarchal. Next time first ask yourself "what am I missing here and how can I be curious about this w/out assuming I'm always right?"
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner The ironic part is that they Are related, actually, but Gary didn't explore that idea. Rather he got the definition of intersectionalism wrong, and then used it to try to build attention for His issue. It's also a BIG issue we need to act on. But we need to do so w/out co-opting
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner Essentially "intersectionalism is a cool and sexy idea. Also the environment should be included!" That ends up sounding very much like co-opting an idea driven by marginalized people to promote environmental issues, without actually making the case that they're related.
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner If the point is "hey, intersectionalism and social justice is important, and if we truly want to end oppression we need to address environmental injustice and act on climate, air pollution, etc" that's great. But that's not what Gary said. What he said was...
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner environmental issues disproportionately impact people living at these intersections. We should not co-opt the language of social movements to try to benefit the environmental movement - that's how we got to a white-led exclusionary mvmt in the past, and it's deeply problematic.
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner People of Color, LGBTQ, immigrants, women, etc - if you're one or many of these, your world is radically different than life as a white man, all other things equal. And if we want to write about intersectionalism and the environment, we should study and report on how...
@flynnboulder @GaryWockner &amp; here is part of my response - intersectionalism is Not the belief that we all do better when we work together. It's the recognition that there are multiple systems of oppression at play in the US, and ppl living at those intersections experience an incredible amt of oppression

@cbiemiller Well lemme know if want to get coffee sometime and talk in person. I live basically in Denver. DM me if you wanna meet up. Gottago to sleep but glad we could chat
@cbiemiller Right but ‚Äútrusting‚Äù Kavanaugh means not trusting the four women who have come forward. So why him and not them? He has more reason to lie
@cbiemiller Oh I see what you were saying. No I wasn‚Äôt saying YOU were being abusive. I‚Äôm saying that the act of trolling women about Kavanaugh is abusive. Right? Because it‚Äôs ppl attacking survivors intentionally. And it‚Äôs like...why? Why would we do that to people who are suffering?
@cbiemiller Also honest question - where@did I attack you? I think you may have misinterpreted my tone somewhere in there.
@cbiemiller Wasn‚Äôt trying to be abusive to you. Glad you‚Äôre being honest. But honestly your defensiveness shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúbecome mean‚Äù tho I think twitter encourages it, right? I do it too. But we shouldn‚Äôt.
@cbiemiller A) it‚Äôs a job interview not a criminal investigation and b) yeah women want that, too. They also want to be able to report rape and abuse without risking their careers, lives, etc. which is why less than 10% of rape is ever reported. THAT is bad. Can we agree on that
@cbiemiller So trolling women right now is cruel and unnecessary and it‚Äôs abusive.	Honestly. Especially since you‚Äôre a guy - there‚Äôs a power dynamic there. Also glad you like clean air - vote Dem since the GOP platform is to roll back enviro regs
@cbiemiller Well I‚Äôd appreciate it if you didn‚Äôt troll me. And honestly sexual assault should not be a partisan issue. So maybe be kind and recognize that women are furious because men in power are saying they don‚Äôt care if he is or isn‚Äôt a rapist - that women don‚Äôt matter. So that hurts

@PureKravMaga Do you think most rapes happen in front of crowded rooms? But actually yah there was a guy who was there...and he‚Äôs been accused too. And haven‚Äôt you seen the letter of over 750 schoolmates who said they believe her?
@PureKravMaga Maybe because she‚Äôs already been forced to leave her house bc of death threats and the eight person panel that‚Äôs going to interrogate her is entirely white male republican men. Not exactly a safe space to tell her story.
@TimothyJPadilla @Helen47 I actually don‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôre that different. My mom and dad and lots of family members were in the military, I like hunting.

@JohnWDean @TheEllenDumm FYI "sexual prank" is not a thing - it's assault, even if the perpetrator thinks it's just a joke. So I get what you're saying but watch your misogyny here. Also - why are GOP MEN getting a pass? We always lay this stuff at women's feet like it's their sole job to fix it.
@TimothyJPadilla That's why I don't get it when people defend alt-right. Is it because you're a conservative? You can be conservative and not associate or defend these ppl. Me calling them out for being shitty is not me calling YOU out. I don't know you. You don't need to defend them either.
@TimothyJPadilla That's all I'm saying, Tim - the alit right is saying its a white supremacy symbol. Then they do it on the internet and on the steps of the capitol. Let's call a spade a spade here. Why is this so hard? I don't know you - I'm not calling you a bad guy.
@TimothyJPadilla Also ASL is very specific. The fact that the hand is upside down in the symbol means that none of the idiots in that photo are using ASL.
