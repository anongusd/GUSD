Talking about Kalamata Olives and cheese platters is the definition of an unforced conversation #MAFSAU
I feel broken every time Bronson speaks on this #MAFSAU
Gimme ten Cams and Jules over Sam and Ines any day of the week #MAFSAU
RT @GhostWhoVotes: #Essential Poll NSW State 2 Party Preferred: L/NP 49 (-5.3 since election) ALP 51 (+5.3) #nswvotes #auspol
That is one of the grimmer cheese platters I've ever seen #MAFSAU
Ines is possibly the Shakespeare of our generation #hello #MAFSAU
Why is Sam still on the show? Seems to be lacking a wife...which seems kinda essential to the show's premise. Maybe just me though #MAFSAU
RWNJ logic:		49 to 51 down in Aug 2018 - remove PM		49 to 51 down in Feb 2019 - the best poll result for a sitting government ever. This could be a 7 term government!!		#auspol
Ines copping two leaves here would be soooooo nice #MAFSAU
VAR is nothing but predictable!! #ADLvWSW
It's a dive. Which means it'll be a penalty #ADLvWSW

This has a real year 8 high school relationship feel about it. Boy and girl talk to each other and declare themselves official. Instantly put each other's names in MSN name #MAFSAU
He has chicken pox ffs #MAFSAU
I no longer believe in love....or humanity #MAFSAU
Yeah kissing girls that aren't your wife is probably "the difficult part" of going on a show that has the word Married in its title #MAFSAU
The affair driven purely by Nine's drive for ratings that no one actually wants to watch #MAFSAU
This is actually awkward AF #MAFSAU
Some intense sexting there #MAFSAU
Agree with this!!! #auspol https://t.co/o5w4gBuwDl
Cam and Jules both have to leave this show immediately. Way too normal to put with this garbage. Almost too normal to even watch the show #MAFSAU
We all know the real reason you want Jules and Cam over Loz #MAFSAU #swing
I'm really confused how this bill is going to start the boats again. Will people smugglers be selling the prospect of arriving in Australia via indefinite offshore detention and permanent psychological damage? Sounds really enticing #auspol
