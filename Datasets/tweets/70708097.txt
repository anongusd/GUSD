@JFKucinich Point taken, but pretty sure President Obama bears some responsibility as well.
@sahilkapur Even pro-reform Rs represent districts full of Americans angry about O's unilateralism. WH reaps what it sows.
@sahilkapur To move stuff you need votes. Can't get votes when you have a president constantly antagonizing the reps who cast those votes.
@StevenTDennis When GOP discussed it at retreat, even pro-reform Rs said they had no confidence "phone and pen" Obama would enforce any law.
@StevenTDennis It's truth. Speaker spent months warning POTUS he was doing things that were making it impossible to win votes for reform.
@MGoodland Yes. A majority of the Republican majority voted to fund DHS.  And nearly every Democrat in the House voted against funding DHS.
@StevenTDennis Conference had no reason to believe Obama would enforce any law he signed. And he gave them every reason to doubt it.

@gleesonjm GOP majority banned pork-barrel earmarks (Dem House refused). Debt limit hike should include cuts, reforms to support job growth.
Debt limit exists in law to force action; to compel DC to deal w/ spending. No surprise current @WhiteHouse considers that obnoxious.
Americans overwhelmingly support attaching spending reforms to next debt limit increase. They do not support attaching more tax hikes to it.
There's a well-established precedent of debt limit hikes being accompanied by reforms. See: Reagan, Clinton, Bush 41. And Obama in 2011.
Debate isn't over whether debt limit must be raised or not, but whether reforms to control spending should be attached. #StrawManReturns

If @WhiteHouse opts to furlough FAA workers instead of trimming consultants, Vegas conferences, other non-personnel costs, expect backlash.

Administration claims sequestration will "force" FAA worker furloughs, but FAA has $2.7 billion in non-personnel costs it could tap instead.

Feeling nostalgic for the days of 8%-plus unemployment, POTUS will renew his quest for a tax hike that hit will #smallbiz, cost 700K jobs.

If 7.8% unemployment is cause for celebration, imagine the blowout we can have when President Obama takes the national debt to $17T.
Pretty sure that if a GOP president promised 5.6% unemployment in September 2012 and delivered 7.8%, it would be called a dismal failure.

@gleesonjm Forgive the Speaker for having taken the @WhiteHouse at its word that POTUS was serious about working w/ GOP to avoid sequester.
