Finally, I‚Äôm asking reporters who attend any of their pressers to ask them if they‚Äôve met with anyone *other than* federal law enforcement. To hear just the law enforcement perspective would indicate to me a possible search for a predetermined outcome.

Above all, families belong together and should not be detained, particularly when there are cost-effective, humane alternatives to detention that ensure that immigrants show up to their hearings.
1. Create a pathway to citizenship for #DACA and #TPS recipients		2. Make investments in additional personnel and infrastructure at our ports of entry		3. Hire more immigration judges		4. Overhaul training for CBP and ICE agents		5. End the criminalization of migration
These policies and practices are inhumane and un-American. Building walls and sowing hate will not solve these complex issues, only further divide us as a nation.		We must focus on reforming our immigration system to ensure a humane and safe process. We must:
Life for immigrants and asylum-seeking families has gotten increasingly worse since 01/20/2017. @POTUS has:	 	Cruelly separated a reported +2K families at the border	Built tent prisons for children	Tear-gassed migrants	Criminalized migration and prioritized detention
The majority of other immigrants live in the shadows, afraid to avail themselves to assistance because of our current immigration climate.
Some came when they were small children seeking refuge &amp; today have limited protection under the #DACA program. Others have been here for decades under #TPS, establishing businesses and cultivating deep roots in communities across the nation.

RT @ChrisMurphyCT: That was a news-free, unremarkable and predictable speech.		Now open the damn government.
Speaker @SpeakerPelosi is right, "women and children at the border are not a security threat," and the humanitarian crisis they are enduring right now is one that a wall will not address and will only exacerbate. They are fleeing their countries and they can't go back.
"The symbol of America should be the statue of liberty, not a thirty-foot wall," says @SenSchumer.  And safe, vibrant, beautiful communities on the U.S.-Mexico border like El Paso, Texas are the #NewEllisIsland

Our border has never been more secure; immigration apprehensions have never been lower; communities like mine have walls, and we were safe BEFORE walls were built. We have real challenges, and a wall won't address them.
Trump claimed to care about human suffering. His policies: separating families, gassing families, jailing children, and criminalizing migration. That's the real tragedy on the U.S. Mexico border.
Apprehensions are still at record lows. A decade ago, apprehensions were over 1.6 million; today, that number is less than 400,000. Large numbers of those are families legally seeking asylum.
The president is correct: this is indeed a choice between right and wrong. The right thing to do is stop holding the government hostage, stop with the xenophobia, and focus on real solutions, not monuments to bigotry and division
I knew it! It only took a few minutes for @realDonaldTrump to invoke a crime committed by an immigrant. I live in one of the safest communities in America, and one quarter of my constituents are immigrants. This line of attack should offend every one of us. Shame on him!
A wall is not "critical" to border security, and when I have spoken with Border Patrol agents off the record, they have told me that they need more personnel, adequate facilities, and additional training. The problem is that DHS has not adapted to the changing patterns migration
A wall doesn't make women and children crossing the border safer -- it makes their trek deadlier. A wall doesn't deter them, it pushes them out to more dangerous and treacherous and DEADLY crossings where walls cannot be built.
RT @SenatorMenendez: Border crossings have been declining for years. We don‚Äôt have a border crisis, we have a hostage crisis‚Äî800,000 hardwo‚Ä¶
The humanitarian crisis on the southern border was created by the Trump administration. His feigned concern for women and children is laughable - this is the president whose administration literally took children from the arms of their mothers and put them in cages
The president wants to keep drugs out of the hands of Americans? Invest in our ports of entry, where most drugs pass through. Give CBP agents the technology and support they need.  A wall won't do that.
.@realDonaldTrump says the U.S. is out of space to hold migrants coming across the border. The solution? Alternatives to detention and forgoing his effort to incarcerate as many migrants as possible.

Finally, legislators should talk to ALL stakeholders here on the border (not JUST law enforcement) in order to truly understand how we can be a better, stronger, more humane nation. 10/10
5. Understand the border has never been safer/more secure; border apprehensions are lower today than they were a decade ago; our country has already invested massive and unprecedented amounts of money in ‚Äúborder security‚Äù; and, a surge in asylum seekers is not unusual. 9/10
4. Return to alternatives to detention. This administration‚Äôs approach to migration (criminalization of it and incarceration of migrants) is cruel, ineffective and expensive. 8/10
3. Look at what the training, personnel, medical, technology and emergency needs are that would help us adapt to the changes we see on all borders and land and sea ports 7/10
2. Evaluate the more than $1 trillion already spent on border security, a wall and sharp increases in personnel in the last two decades and why DHS hasn‚Äôt adapted to changing migration patterns and challenges that first arose four years ago. 6/10
REAL solutions include:		1. Long-term investment and work in Central American countries these many, many families are fleeing. They want to stay at home but cannot because of extreme poverty, persecution and violence. 	5/10
When @SecNielsen was in El Paso 2 wks ago and refused to meet with me and other stakeholders who could‚Äôve helped her better understand the complexities of the humanitarian challenges we face, I knew this administration was uninterested in real solutions. 4/10
The new challenges on the border have nothing to do with national security. These asylum seekers are running TO (not from) Border Patrol agents, seeking help and refuge. And we have not adapted to families presenting themselves at and between ports of entry. 3/10
Every time I talk to advocates on the ground, visit a border patrol holding station and speak with agents ‚Äî my third time in a month ‚Äî I understand with more clarity that there are serious needs and challenges on our southern border that a wall absolutely will not address. 2/10
