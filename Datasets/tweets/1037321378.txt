This 5-4 decision hinged on the vote of a justice appointed by President Trump after Republicans refused to even hold hearings on President Obama‚Äôs nominee, Merrick Garland. It will benefit the President‚Äôs wealthy backers at the expense of American workers. 5/6
When union membership began to fall in the early 1970s, the share of national income earned by middle class Americans declined, too. Between 1980 and 2014, wages for the bottom half of American workers grew by only 1%, compared to growth of 205% for the top one percent. 4/6
By denying these unions the ability to collect ‚Äúfair share fees‚Äù from non-members who nonetheless benefit from the union‚Äôs work, the Supreme Court is setting up public sector unions to suffer the same sort of collapse that we‚Äôve seen in the private sector. 3/6

I appreciate the optimism of my Senate colleagues, but if Republicans truly cared about Dreamers, or children‚Äôs health care, or community health centers they wouldn‚Äôt hold these priorities hostage.
If Republicans had put half as much effort into this CR as they did into last year‚Äôs huge tax cut for billionaires, the government would be open and @realDonaldTrump would be eating a Big Mac at Mar-a-Lago. #TrumpShutdown
I‚Äôm fighting for a bipartisan CR because I care about community health centers, CHIP kids, DACA recipients, pensioners, soldiers, veterans, and Americans impacted by disasters. These are the priorities I‚Äôm fighting for. #TrumpShutdown
I‚Äôll stay in session as long as it takes to get a real deal to reopen the government, because unlike @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan, I actually care about everyone in my community. #TrumpShutdown
I‚Äôm still not sure what Trump wants. We‚Äôd be much closer to ending the #TrumpShutdown if he would just say what he wanted, and then didn‚Äôt change his mind on Twitter 15 minutes later.
Trump wanted a ‚Äúbill of love‚Äù on DACA, but rejected an agreement that met his demands. He should follow his original instincts, not listen to bad advisers like Stephen Miller and @SpeakerRyan. #TrumpShutdown
Right now, the sun is rising in Washington, DC on the second day of the #TrumpShutdown. Any minute now, the President will find his phone, and issue completely new, ridiculous demands to be met before he‚Äôll reopen the government.
This year has read like a short story on what happens when you put people in charge of government who don‚Äôt really believe in the role of the government. The end of this paragraph is the #TrumpShutdown.
We‚Äôre now one day into the #TrumpShutdown, a completely avoidable crisis. If @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr McConnell would put bipartisan priorities in the CR, it would pass easily.
If you‚Äôd told me last January that @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs first year would have ended in a #TrumpShutdown because he couldn‚Äôt close an easy deal‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd have found that completely believable.
The #TrumpShutdown was caused by the ‚Äúsh*thole comment.‚Äù Negotiations were underway, and then the worst instincts of the GOP base found their way in to the DACA debate.
Speaker Ryan seems to be following the #HastertRule, even if it continues the #TrumpShutdown. Dems are ready to help pass something that gives to both sides, protect Dreamers, extend childrens health insurance, funding health centers. You‚Äôll get my vote.
Americans across the country, including California, need more funds for disaster relief, another bipartisan priority that @realDonaldTrump and @SpeakerRyan refused to include in their CR. #TrumpShutdown
Speaker Ryan won‚Äôt let a bill with a DACA fix come to the floor, which caused the #TrumpShutdown. My guess is that he‚Äôs worried the Freedom Caucus and @RepMarkMeadows are coming for his job.
How can Democrats negotiate with @realDonaldTrump? Says he‚Äôs the best negotiator in the world, but when bipartisan Senators met his policy demands in exchange for DACA, he refused to take ‚Äúyes‚Äù for an answer. #TrumpShutdown
I am not quite sure who it is Democrats are actually supposed to be negotiating with. It definitely isn‚Äôt Trump, the supposed deal-maker. He may physically be in DC, but he‚Äôs mentally left for Mar-a-Lago. #TrumpShutdown
If Republicans love the children‚Äôs healthcare insurance program (CHIP) so much, why didn‚Äôt they just extend it when the authorization was up? Short answer: They knew they could use it as leverage over Dems, who genuinely care about CHIP. #TrumpShutdown
It‚Äôs hard not to see this #TrumpShutdown as the plan all along. He created the problem by ending DACA and then told his supporters he‚Äôd shut down the government unless he got a wall.
@nathanplatt Because that's what they do. They pretend to care about issues like Children's Health Insurance, but instead of just extending it, they use it to bargain for things they really care about.
One year after his inauguration, @RealDonaldTrump has led America into a #TrumpShutdown through bad faith negotiations and lies. We need a CR that funds CHIP and community health centers, includes recovery funds for natural disaster victims, and offers a solution for Dreamers.

@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin @VFWHQ In sum: @SecShulkin‚Äôs comments confirm that the Trump administration is following the Koch playbook and, if given the chance, would force millions of veterans into the private sector with higher costs and far less oversight.
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin @VFWHQ This is what we‚Äôve been warning about all along. Removing the VA from its role in veterans care is clinically irresponsible and financially unsustainable, which Secretary Shulkin himself admits in this quote. He knows how this ends! https://t.co/1lxP5omjKI
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin @VFWHQ The private care advocates said we were being hyperbolic. A newspaper I respect once gave me ‚ÄúThree Pinnochios‚Äù for that claim. Yet, here it is. @SecShulkin says his goal is to eventually strip VA of its coordinating role in veterans care. https://t.co/KfZkMjsETk
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin @VFWHQ My colleagues and I have long warned that the Koch-backed model is designed to privatize VA...	Step 1. Undermine its coordinating role in the care of veterans. 	Step 2. Starve it of resources so it is no longer financially sustainable. 	Step 3. Privatization.
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin But most concerning of all is @SecShulkin‚Äôs vision for the future of VA care. Veterans advocates have long stated that veterans are best served by keeping VA as the coordinator of care. See this quote in the piece from @VFWHQ. https://t.co/7WQK9Ilsyi
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin This also means that when we outsource more care to private providers we lose accountability, oversight, and coordination between providers, which leads to problems like this: https://t.co/QTzDFIk0M3
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin Comparing VA to private clinics is ‚Äúapples to oranges‚Äù at best. And, in most cases, the private facility is not keeping the same metrics at all. They just don‚Äôt have the legal mandate or incentive.
@bkesling @PeterWSJ @SecShulkin Later on, @SecShulkin says his goal is for more transparency at VA facilities to help veterans compare them with the private sector. The only problem: private health providers already lag way behind VA on transparency. https://t.co/wklCKEZexu
@bkesling @PeterWSJ Right from the top, @SecShulkin is using the Koch-backed language about VA "competing" with private providers. Not good. Nearly all credible veterans advocates agree that the private sector should *partner* with VA, not compete for resources. https://t.co/K5CICPEeOT
Yesterday, @bkesling &amp; @PeterWSJ published an article from a recent interview with VA Secretary David Shulkin. The quotes they captured should be deeply concerning to anyone who cares about the future of the Dept of Veterans Affairs. Let me explain. https://t.co/IGbR2CJxnH 1/
Many #transgender Americans are denied more than just their rights, they are denied their basic ability to feel safe in their communities. 		Today we call for an end to violence against trans people, and remember those who were killed because they owned their identity.		#TDOR
The Trump administration has been holding secret meetings - without input from Congress, veterans, or health care experts - on a plan that would dismantle VA health care. Unproductive, irresponsible, and completely unacceptable. https://t.co/f030eXCWce

And finally, we must accept that ‚Äì while the veterans among us today have experienced things that many of us can never truly understand ‚Äì it is our duty to try. It is on us to build a community, a culture, and a country that seeks to understand and honor their sacrifices.
Second, we must separate the honor of service from the reality of combat. While we completely and unreservedly support the men and women who have the courage to fight, we also recognize the incalculable toll that war has on those who serve, on their families, and on our country.
First, we must provide veterans and their families the care and support they earned through their service. Whether its access to health care, access to benefits, or access to economic opportunity, it is our duty to keep the promises we‚Äôve made.
Today we say thank you to America‚Äôs veterans and remember that, as civilians, we have a mission of our own. #VeteransDay

I support S.114 to prevent a VA Choice funding lapse. But it's only a short-term fix. Choice has been uneven/confusing for many veterans.
But this is far from over. And it won't be until Republicans are willing to work with Democrats to ensure every person has access to care.
Millions of Americans are breathing a sigh of relief tonight. Thanks to all those (D's &amp; R's!) who stood strong to defeat a terrible bill.
For every minute between when Senate Republicans introduced &amp; voted on this bill, it would lead to 100,000 more Americans without insurance.
Republicans are about to vote on a health care bill that they wrote at lunch, trashed over dinner, and then introduced an hour ago.  	#shame

4. A little while later, Heather messaged me to say she was cancer free. She credits the Affordable Care Act with saving her life.
3. Soon after, Heather was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. With her insurance, she was able to get the treatment she needed.
2. Heather had a pre-existing condition and for years before the ACA she was denied coverage. After ACA, she could finally buy insurance.
