If we want to stop shooting we have to help people with mental illness.When people give up hope,and feel alone,desperate they loses their bounds.Churches need to get back into our communities,the government can't do it all.We have to be responsible for our behavior.
@charliekirk11 As usually the Democrats will cheat, lie and have no honor.When your ideas want to control people you have to do this.This is why they don't want school choice to keep some people uneducated and promise free stuff just like the royals did.And make sure we can't defend ourselves.

People I share with I have 2 Grandsons by an illegal he is a honorable man; I love him his wife who is a dreamer.Her mother has worked years for cash as a maid; got free health care,food stamps,rent assist,etc.that could have gone to our vets,disable like my deaf grandson.
Think of the cost of the children that illegals have and don't pay children support.We the working class are affected by illegals coming,we the people pay for them.I what them to come illegally that is all.
I want the working class to think about what happens to medical when illegals don't pay their medical bills:Medical cost raises,so insurance go up.Children hospital in El Paso,TX almost closed and the city could not help,private money saved them.Taxes will be going up again.
I wanting the working class to think about what happens in the USA went illegals come here illegally.Lower wages,less taxes being pay to the IRS,then we pay more,the demand goes away wages stay lower less raises.
I want the working class to think about all the money we spent on the illegals:Schools english classes,over side class rooms,even though we have hired more teachers,lower wages for teachers,higher property taxes.This affect our children.
