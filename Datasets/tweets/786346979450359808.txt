@secupp "He allegedly abused police resources, exploited raw divisions in this country, and made it harder for every victim of a hate crime to report. This is sad no matter your politics." True and who did that? #JussieSmollett not #POTUS supporters so why tweet bad about trumpststers
@secupp Every time someone is a victim of hate media n Democrats blame #POTUS (often through blaming his supporters) it's horrible to be perceived as a monster because you support #Trump2020 when it is simply not true. This shows the hate and racism comes from them not #MAGA
