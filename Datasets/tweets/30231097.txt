Thank for joining us! If you still have questions about #MSPs shoot us an email at socialmedia@opm.gov or tweet it here! #GetCovered
Financial assistance is based on income and family size. To learn about eligibility for assistance check out http://t.co/lcHG1lFseF #MSP
If you choose a #MSP you are equally eligible for premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions as with other plans on the #ACA.
Last question! Can enrollees in Multi-State Plan options get financial help? #MSP
Your #MSP may be called something different in your state (like CareFirst) but all plans are through Blue Cross/Blue Shield! #GetCovered
Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is our #MSP insurer in 2014. #GetCovered
Two more email questions: What plans offer #MSP options on the Marketplace?
All #ACA Marketplace plans offer a variety of options that could be a good fit for you. An #MSP may be the right one for you.
Because of OPM‚Äôs experience, we‚Äôre committed to offering you quality plans. #MSP
#MSPs are high-quality plans managed by OPM. We have experience negotiating benefits, monitoring performance, and overseeing compliance.
Next question is from email again: Why should I pick a Multi-State Plan?
Therefore, those who choose #MSPs will benefit from OPM‚Äôs experience with contract negotiation and oversight of insurers.
OPM has years of experience administering the FEHB program to over 8 million federal employees. #MSP
Great question! The #ACA requires OPM to contract with insurance companies to offer #MSPs in every state and DC.
RT @ruthi008: Why is @USOPM administering the #MSP program? What's special about OPM's experience?
#MSP plans are available to the public as a part of the #ACA Marketplace. You can enroll through http://t.co/MuZ0Zi4VPr.
Federal employee insurance is through the FEHBP and the #ACA requires that OPM keep FEHBP and #MSP programs separate.
Actually, #MSP options are separate from the Health Benefits Program for federal employees.
Yes! There are over 150 #MSP options at the bronze, silver and gold levels. Check out our map to see them by state http://t.co/zxFQfzZZEC
Q1: Do any state marketplaces have multi state plans? (from email)
Enroll through http://t.co/MuZ0Zi4VPr, call 1800-318-2596, or find an assister in your area through http://t.co/frU0k1EG4R. #GetCovered
First question comes to us through email! #MSP
If you are in one of the states with #MSPs for 2014, it will be listed as an option when you enroll through http://t.co/KDU2wqFESO.
Currently #MSP plans are available in thirty states and DC and will be phased-in to all states over the next few years.
The Multi-State Plan (#MSP) program was created by the #ACA and is administered by OPM, as required by the law.
Let‚Äôs get started! First, let‚Äôs talk about what an #MSP is.
