That's why I wrote the #SaveRuralHospitalsAct.My bill will stop the hundreds of devastating potential hospital closures across Rural America
Today is #NationalRuralHealthDay. Nearly 1 in 6 Americans live in rural areas, but our hospitals are closing at an alarming rate.

Read about @HouseGOP's #BetterWay for ending the tragic cycle of poverty and dependence on welfare programs here: https://t.co/yKrY6yoXg3
As @SpeakerRyan has said, our welfare system is a work replacement system. There's a #BetterWay to limit poverty than penalizing work
Our welfare system is broken. We need a safety net that's temporary, &amp; encourages people to live themselves up &amp; get back to work #BetterWay
We've tried federal programs, welfare systems &amp; big government.We need a #BetterWay 2 help ppl living in poverty-it all starts w/ a good job
There's a #BetterWay to protect workers and the American public than top-down mandates from the federal government.		https://t.co/shMC6YmbL6
Small businesses are hit hardest by all the crazy regulations from this administration.	#ChaseCandyCo in St. Joe is a great example.
More than a quarter of our GDP comes from business selling good to foreign markets. #WRDA invests in ports and protects international trade.
Glad to see the House pass a bipartisan #WRDA bill tonight. It invests in dams &amp; levees, helping protect MO farmers&amp;businesses from flooding
Thank you all for joining us. Important conversations to continue. https://t.co/IGnYmjkJ44

Closing #Gitmo is not a ntnl security strategy. We cant surrender what weve given up in the war on terror just to fulfill a campaign promise
Proud to support HR 5351, a bill blocking the transfer of terrorists out of #Gitmo. ~ 30% of those released returned to the front line.
A #BetterWay starts w/ improving Perkins.The House-passed Strengthening Career &amp; Technical Education for the 21st Century Act does just that
About 55% of U.S. jobs require more than a high school diploma, but only 44% of workers are prepared for careers in these fields.
