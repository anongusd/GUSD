The Global scientific consensus is Climate Change is real and as we see these extreme weather incidence get more extreme in frequency we can all see it.
@caesar_ramirez @lars10_lc @Cubfan1324 @KatrinaPierson I am not trying to make us China I am arguing that these policies are not competitive in the changing world, nor are they good for the planet which we need for survival nor will oil dependency be a good move for military costs and lives we will lose.

@Liberalknoitall @bodybyanxiety That is the point here. People are trying to take the decision out of the patient and doctors hands and put the decision int he states hands.

@Liberalknoitall @bodybyanxiety Please do your research. In 20 test subjects in Second trimester they found 4 women with fetal toxoplasmosis that 2 fetuses were born with severe damage and 2 died soon after birth.
@Liberalknoitall @bodybyanxiety And when they discover a woman has an aggressive form of Pelvic Cancer in later trimester &amp; she needs radiation which is damaging to the fetus what then? Should she just die?

Radiation is usually not recommended regardless of the stage of pregnancy. Possible effects on the fetus during this time include malformation of the organs, small brain, mental retardation, developmental delays, stunted growth and other growth abnormalities.
Cancers in the pelvis in a pregnant woman cannot be treated effectively with radiation therapy without causing severe problems for the fetus. In this case, for a woman who is between 1 and 26 weeks pregnant, the doctor will often recommend not to continue with the pregnancy

@ratkingcake @trueromancefest @FherBaroccio @Amycient I think it is a trade off. There are sometimes things you don't want.
@RepMaxineWaters Please for the love of God make some Democrat ask Cohen if he is aware of any settlement in the Lisa Bloom Trump child rape case which was dropped 8 days before the election they said it was because of death threats but was it a settlement?

False- It didn't happen at Clinton Correction. However, the first man executed by electric chair was in prison for murdering a woman named "Tillie" and by witness accounts the execution was a horrible affair. https://t.co/pXPhjA7IED
@ComedyMontreal Thanks!
Well an Elephant was electrocuted on Coney Island. Edison was trying to destroy Tesla by showing the danger of the alternating current. However it is said a bull was electrocuted to check the efficiency of the electric chair at Clinton- https://t.co/OQrJtmHpit
@pretty_bird Yeah awful.
@amack8328 Thank you!
@Daphnemcw We can't win em all darlin'!
@ted_rood Me personally? If I was single. YEAH
True or false- The first man electrocuted at Clinton correctional was imprisoned for murdering a woman named "Tillie" ?	 #EscapeAtDannemora
@propfwd3 Well it was used on Coney Island on an elephant.
True or False- Was Tupac ever imprisoned at Clinton Correctional? 	#EscapeAtDannemora
@lizzirizzobls Well the elephant being electrocuted was true to show the efficiency and danger of current and to destroy Tesla..
https://t.co/NMTPorU3Av
@melonieann BINGO
@Palmina54 Well the did on Coney Island.
@DJCornelius3 Part of the reason was he was trying to destroy Tesla.
@murilo_direito @jairbolsonaro My thoughts are with you very much right now.
True or False- Because of the steep incline on the prison yard at Dannemora During winter the Prisoners fashioned a ski jump and used to have a ski jump competition?
@FreeCitizen33 @POTUS A to of people are not working at the IRS either. hmmm
@starbuck1771 @POTUS Mexico is paying.
@battletested5 @SHOLtdSeries Thanks! So glad you enjoyed it.
Do you think this is true or false- The original electric chair used at Dannemora prison was used to electrocute and elephant?
@anotherreallisa We did shoot there but not sure I could answer as well as others. We had a tour and shot inside but I imagine some things have changed since then. Having said that I think many things have stayed the same.

@DouglasJoyaPics @Femmelaforte @KarenWe36429687 @JNoCoola @realDonaldTrump Let me make this easy for you. Our troops and REAL allies all share intel which will not be on any news because it is Top Secret.  It was then shared with our top Military which educates them to make informed decisions about military action.

@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina I have my own relationship with Christ and my own deeply held understanding . what I don’t accept is your interpretation of what my relationship with Christ should be or what it must be to have a certain outcome.
@CIssyvoo @SpyNavy3910 I’m so sorry. It’s horrible.
@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina I know Jesus claimed to be the son of God thats not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about Hesus never said people were going to hell if they weren’t Christians
@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina God loves more then the constructs you put on everything.
@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Many people repent their sins. Many people do not even sin. They live good and honorable lives. Without these rules or punishments.
@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Is having more then one wife a sin?
@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina You are a zealot and you use God like a club. And use Hesus’s name as a divider.
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons Then if God and the Holy Spirit wanted everyone to be Catholic they would be.
@GDstovedIn Why thanks! I hope they do too!
@RosaSterner But you will! I dare you!
@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina JESUS NEVER SAID ANY OF THAT.
@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump This church rule you guys have created makes it look like Jesus was some psychotic egomaniac who would participate in something like that. Why would Jesus want for good people To go to hell weather they accepted Christ or not?
@TLMArmstrong @selectedwisdom @RedHourBen Thanks

@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump He never said Jews will go to hell or can’t go to heaven. In fact he said they could all go to heaven. He died for the sins- right?
@JamesDelaney889 @zavareh_tina God loves all.
@PhilRevard @JamesDelaney889 @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Beautiful.
@juliasharons @JamesDelaney889 Sorry I will check out that frontline. Thanks.
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons True. I’m sorry I meant earliest gospiks as much of that letter is about the squabbling an politics at that time.
@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard @DianaWelte @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Maybe because Jesus died for people’s sins and wouldn’t care because his message is a message of love.
@pronneberg Sweet!
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons He created rituals and the earliest writings are the gnostic ones which say nothing about a church and nothing about money or any of the beaurocracy  of this church people made up. he told preached  love and brotherhood and instead you guys always divide.
@JamesDelaney889 So if I make a few rituals at I creating a religion?
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons Guess what Jesus did not say- abandon Judaism. I am starting a new faith. He never said any of that. It’s not just the Old Testament. John the Baptist and Jesus were both referred to by the names Rabbi and teacher.
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons People after him decided these crazy rules about this church. He never disavowed Judaism.
@JamesDelaney889 @juliasharons Historical accuracy is that he was referred to several times as Rabbi.
@nikonfansouth @JohnMH_Jr @realDonaldTrump Excellent point. Drones are going to fly over it too with drugs. They already do at US prisons. With big walls
@JamesDelaney889 @PhilRevard None of which means he was trying to create a new church nor saying Jews were going to Hell. It’s stupid.

@GerardBattenMEP @POTUS You are equating a PR visit to hacking into voting bases and funneling millions of dollars into candidates? Sorry that sounds silly. What happened to us was Cyber Warfare. It happened to you too and it wasn’t Obama.

@rex_angry @marcorubio You have no patience.
@rex_angry @marcorubio Well I would hope the pull out in Syria would at least be DISCUSSED with our top Miltary leaders. So we would look at the ramifications. But it wasn’t . Instead it was brokered directly with Russia’s they wanted Syria they got it. Merry Christmas Vlad.
