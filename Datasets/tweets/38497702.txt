OMG this footnote. Judge Jackson wrote that she believes Roger Stone's lawyers misled her last week about the timing of his book's release as a means to generate publicity for it. https://t.co/tiYt0lX9VR
The Judge in the Roger Stone case is *not* happy to find out that his new book introduction calling Robert Mueller "crooked" is available online for free. She's giving him until March 11 to turn over everything he has about the book deal and when everything was to be released. https://t.co/LC8pHFuqEZ
The question is whether Stone did anything to "publish" views about Mueller after Judge Jackson issued her Feb. 21 gag order. She also seems to suggest that maybe he should have yanked the book from sale. It's hard to see how he isn't more likely to have his bail revoked now.
It's also worth underscoring that at the time he said this, according to the FBI, Hillary Clinton's home-brew email server had been offline and inaccessible to the Russians *for more than a year*
I was there, and to me the most telling part of this has always been that Trump said "they probably have them" (the deleted Clinton emails) as opposed to "they should go steal them." The latter has been the predominant interpretation of the event for more than 19 months. https://t.co/aTm9knvpC4

Whether everything or nothing in Michael Cohen's statement is true (and I don't pretend to know), the White House's messaging will be the same: Cohen is a convicted liar who can't be trusted to tell the truth in his last few months of freedom. His base will see it that way too.
Cohen claims @DonaldJTrumpJr whispered to his father in June 2016: "The meeting is all set."

@Clodagh831 @AFGENational This was four years before the confederacy existed.
This, from the government employees union. They didn't read the full letter that their press release quoted from -- meaning they didn't read the two pages that the book was open to on the congressman's shelf. https://t.co/A0lQ1oCrWC
@AFGENational To be clear, the entirety of the letter was printed in the two pages displayed in the congressman's office. All of it.
@AFGENational This was 6 years before the Emancipation Proclamation.
So the @AFGENational is castigating a congressman for displaying this, written by Robert E. Lee: "We see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is onward, and we give it the aid of our prayers and all justifiable means in our power."
Here's the full text of what Lee wrote to his wife about slavery on December 27, 1856. I'm no Civil War scholar, but on balance this seems to be anti-slavery with a touch of Christian determinism. He's arguing that slavery is evil but it has to be abolished on God's timetable. https://t.co/IrOkxkBsm6
Did anyone actually read the letter from Robert E. Lee that the union is complaining about? I was surprised.

@ericowensdc It's out of proportion with what's in those schedules. You're seeing what goes to the staff. It doesn't reflect a lot. People come into the Oval every day, calls made, not anticipated the night before when the schedules are distributed. Twitter "Executive Time" is a caricature.
One problem with the leaked presidential schedules is that in Twitter-land "Executive Time" suggests Trump sitting in his bathrobe, watching Fox and tweeting. In reality it's the same unstructured time every president has had, including foreign leader calls, internal meetings etc

@IdealisticallyN @DailyMail I bet if you tried to fit 535 lawmakers, 9 SCOTUS justices, the Cabinet members and their invited +1 guests into that chamber, it would be cramped as hell.
If you think about it, the government is shut down over a wall request for 0.1425% of the budget. Do the math. It's like a $50,000 earner defaulting on his mortgage because he and his spouse can't agree on spending $71 for a security door in a lousy neighborhood.
It's maddening to bump into the day's biggest newsmaker and get him to clarify the day's biggest question, only to have him insist everything is off the record, refuse to budge on it, and walk away. Just saying.

@digiphile @RiegerReport @FactbaseFeed @JoshuaGreen @NunbergSam I'm saying lots of people gulped up what Steve Bannon and Sam Nunberg were selling for a few years. But no, he reported accurately what Nunberg said. Personally, though, I would rate the statement itself somewhere between a Frank Abagnale and a Lance Armstrong.
@digiphile @RiegerReport @FactbaseFeed @JoshuaGreen @NunbergSam Nunberg is not trustworthy on this, or practically anything.

@RiegerReport January 2015: "a fence"
Clarifying -- Executive Order 13526 gave Cabinet secretaries the authority to classify at the Top Secret level without review.
Unless I'm forgetting something (entirely possible), a 2009 Obama E.O. was left in place, making the DHS secretary one of a few dozen people who can classify documents at will. So Nielsen saying "that's classified" is a self-fulfilling declaration that's always technically true. https://t.co/eYSwHCJYX7

A far better version of the latest SCOTUS reversal data. These are 2013-2017 numbers. the 9th Circuit isn't the most overturned, although its cases did get certiorari most often. https://t.co/kHyZeiSt7v
@CRTM63 No, the SCOTUS generally only takes cases that are ripe for reversal. 98% of applications for certiorari are denied.
(reposted this thread because of an error in the original)
And lastly, I'll note that a tiny, tiny fraction of appeals to the Supreme Court are granted hearings at all. The justices accept between 1% and 2% of the cases referred to them. So the stats aren't necessarily a measure of the soundness of any appeals court circuit's judgments.
None of this, of course, addresses the confusion the president seems to have between the appeals courts and the district courts. The "Obama judge" he's complaining about, Jon Tigar, is a district judge. So his cases wouldn't even figure into the stats.
"DC" is the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. 	"FC" is the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 	Data: https://t.co/lfQB3X5YKf

@karenamyatt @brianstelter No, they say they made a "preliminary decision" back on Nov. 7, and they're painting it as something that's still subject to an ongoing due-process procedure. That has nothing to do with what they might decide to do at the end of the TRO enforcement.
Veterinarian friend, just now: "If they feed that turkey enough M&amp;Ms for it to be its favorite snack, something called theobromine poisoning will kick in from the chocolate. You get a hyper bird with the very real turkey-trots." https://t.co/KbgQF1OmNN

2019 White House Correspondents Association dinner will hear from historian Ron Chernow, who begged voters to "please, please, please" reject Trump in 2016 https://t.co/r8R0Vy9ixO via @MailOnline
@FauxTT @brianstelter He's appealing the Nov. 7 decision, which the White House is framing as the product of a (perhaps nonexistent) process. This is a different thing from the question of what the White House will do on Nov. 30. They didn't say, but Brian wrote that they did.
Not that this should come as a surprise, but Ron Chernow is no fan of Trump. He spelled out in 2016 why he thought Trump should lose. https://t.co/5KBtFuxf1P
@justintetreault @TruTellr @brianstelter No, the letter is an attempt to retroactively frame the Nov. 7 decision as the product of a process whose decision will be "final" today. 		That's a different thing entirely from the claim that the letter says the White House will issue a second suspension on Nov. 30 (It doesn't)
@brianstelter Your newsletter: "White House officials sent Acosta a letter stating that his pass is set to be suspended again once the restraining order expires." It doesn't say that -- only that he'll keep it while the order is in force. There's nothing in the letter about what comes next.
@NaughtyDerek It's Ron Chernow. Read the thing I posted. It's right there.
"President Clinton famously missed his shot" -- likely refers to Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir's offer to hand bin Laden over. Clinton declined, instead pressuring Sudan to expel Bin Laden in 1996. See "Losing Bin Laden" by Richard Miniter. Highly recommended book. https://t.co/MKZfn7skEO
@DylanByers Last year's speaker certainly was.
@brianstelter *will abide by it
@brianstelter Yeah, that's one logical interpretation. But there are others. Another would be that the White House expects another ruling and till abide by it, since it's reassuring CNN that it's going to abide by the current one. This is not at all as you sold it.
The White House Correspondents Association has invited a historian, not a comedian, to talk at this year's dinner. It's about time. https://t.co/ccls6XIEYC

@TruTellr @brianstelter That's a retroactive description of the original November 7 decision.
@KevinSelhi Nope.
If @brianstelter was referring to some other written notice CNN got, saying Acosta will lose his hard pass on Nov. 30, I haven't seen it.  https://t.co/cCBDazHlRH https://t.co/zJeCjNYs9q
Reading the White House's letter to Jim Acosta, it doesn't say what @brianstelter reported. No mention of revoking his press pass again. Only this: "You will continue to maintain your hard pass while the Temporary Restraining Order issued on November 16, 2018, remains in effect." https://t.co/F6qceVJWfK
#Stoic philosophy thought for today from Epictetus: 		"If you hear that someone is speaking ill of you, instead of trying to defend yourself you should say: ‘He obviously does not know me very well — since there are so many other faults he could have mentioned'."
@jbarro Stay away from the salmon ice cream
@JSitlington Why change now?
@PeteHegseth Wrong seat. Jim sits all the way to the left.
According to CNN, the White House has already notified Jim Acosta in writing that his press credential will be yanked again, as soon as the judge's 14-day temporary restraining order has expired.

Senator-elect Rick Scott said outgoing Sen. Bill Nelson has thrown in the towel: "I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson, who graciously conceded, and I thanked him for his years of public service."
@baseballcrank Totally true. But I do think the imbalance, if Election Day were a holiday, would disadvantage lower middle class strivers -- so it might not exactly be the most progressive idea unless we're willing to go without restaurants and Ubers. Same if it were on a Saturday.
Would be very interesting to interview @Ocasio2018 about this. (Ping me any time.)
I'm wondering what @Ocasio2018 thinks about the social inequality of making Election Day a holiday, since government, professors and white-collar pros get the day off but retail, hospitality, public transit, taxi drivers - basically the entire service sector - has to work anyway.

Trump enters the IX Center in Cleveland. Massive crowd. Thousands straining to see in the back. He says: "Something is going on, Ohio, that they're not talking about." https://t.co/ZL6foTX4lP
This is a sort of I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I moment. Trump is asked about 'offensive' ad that CNN, NBC and Fox News have banned, and he tells the reporter that "Your questions are offensive a lot of times." https://t.co/eN5TdInHWS via @MailOnline
@ezralevant I'd think the sea of red hats would be enough.
This was the scene in Cleveland about an hour before today's scheduled rally time, as the crowd recited the Pledge of Allegiance. I was here the last time Trump spoke at the same venue, about two weeks before Election Day 2016. This audience is already much bigger. https://t.co/rP8UNxFrAe
I keep wanting to pan the camera to see how many people are there. https://t.co/faoQ4Fe2XU
Is it possible Fox went along with the ban so they could justify airing it in news packages "about the ban" all day today and tomorrow? Would be a flavor of the PETA Super Bowl ad strategy: Get the ad banned s oeveryone in the country talks about it and wants to see it. https://t.co/s9JLBN8wWc
What's interesting (to me) about CNN's refusal to run the 30-second Trump ad that NBC aired last night: CNN seems to have conflated it with the 60-second video POTUS tweeted last week. The two videos cover the same theme but are otherwise unrelated. https://t.co/eN5TdInHWS

@stevenportnoy Also, I suspect SCOTUS would rule that an illegal immigrant, by definition, can't have a "permanent domicil and residence" in the United States -- since they're *always* subject to deportation.
@stevenportnoy Wong Kim was a legal resident. SCOTUS has never ruled on whether people who are here *illegally* con confer citizenship to babies born in the U.S. I remember Rand Paul brought this up during a GOP primary debate and everyone hammered him -- until Politifact said he was right.
@1stJensen Congress can't tell SCOTUS what it meant. That's a no-no.
@gefsatx @ForAmerica I wish @scotusblog felt like weighing in.
@stevenportnoy I think SCOTUS's 1873 Slaughterhouse decision is interesting too. The court opined that the phrase "subject to its jurisdiction" was intended to "exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign States born within the United States."
@avocat0 Agreed. I think SCOTUS is where this is headed ultimately. Trump has appointed two justices. By the time the issue is ripe for the high court, who knows if he'll appoint more?

@MarcStilesPSBJ @neeratanden @NateSilver538 @Scholten4Iowa All views welcome. As I said, I've been wrong before. And bigger presumptions than "Steve King will win" have become political tumbleweeds. (See "Donald Trump will lose," 2016)
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 I talked to a husband and wife yesterday, Democrats in IA-04 who say they won't vote at all because they're so conflicted. I don't know of an exit-poll model that can account for that.
@mattisonbrooks I should have specified .... Nonfiction garbage.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 I don't imagine a blowout. But I also don't imagine he loses.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 Nice to chat	 Good night.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 And what I said is that they're concerned about the economic impact in NW Iowa if he loses. That's not the same as affirmatively supporting him. To be sure, Democrats who vote for him would all be holding their noses.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 I concede that it's anecdotal but it's their view, not mine.
I miss baseball already. So much hot garbage on cable TV.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 It's also worth considering his focus on pro-life issues. Other than soybeans, I've heard more in the last month from IA-04 voters about the heartbeat bill than about any other discrete issue. That surprised even me.
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 *talking
@neeratanden @NateSilver538 My sense from taking to people on the ground is that King's longstanding focus on ag trade has made him an anomaly amid blue energy. Some Democratic farmers are weighing their future business success against their desire to send an anti-Trump message. To me, that's powerful.

@akaashkolluri @NickRiccardi Per 538, Hillary Clinton had a 71.4% chance of being president.
@NateSilver538 You're saying Steve King is as nuclear as an indicted lawmaker? He might be that nuclear in New York but I don't see it in IA-04. I've been wrong before, but if King loses you're looking at Dems +40 seats in the House.

I was at Trump's election-night rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which he just said had an audience of 32,000 people. There were maybe 4,500 inside and another 2,500 outside. About 1/4 of the indoor crowd walked out before he was done because it was 1:30 a.m. on a school night.

If this isn't done in public, and Democrats emerge w/ sound bites about increasing discomfort w/ Kavanaugh, it will give POTUS a significant talking point and he'll make the midterms a referendum on the Supreme Court. Even House races, which don't affect it. (because Trump) https://t.co/9ucSH2i2sU

@54Doggie @almostjingo @SenFeinstein Some people bury these things for decades. It's just hard to know without (a) reading the letter, and (b) speaking to the alleged victim.
@wernet @almostjingo @SenFeinstein We don't know that she didn't.
@almostjingo @SenFeinstein I'm not judging the veracity of the claim, but the allegation is that he locked her in a room, held her down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her. It's not something that can be immediately dismissed.
Two things.		(1) Kavanaugh has been publicly accused of *nothing* and proven guilty of even less.		(2) Comparisons to Clarence Thomas's claims of a "high-tech lynching" are fair game, until they're not.

Interesting -- so my theory about due diligence is out the window. Republicans likely spent all day yesterday calling women Kavanaugh knew back in the day. https://t.co/CVqCxpxWEc
@politicalirony1 True. There are so many moving pieces in this.
@NickRiccardi It is, of course, possible that Republican staffers got wind of the letter and, knowing its timeframe and nature but no specifics, worked overtime to be prepared for anything. The letter is worded vaguely enough to cover lots of scenarios.
Manafort's cooperation deal includes interviews, documents &amp; testimony. The White House will insist it has nothing to do with them, but that's a hard position to maintain. IF (it's a big "if") Trump is inclined to pardon Manafort, he will do it soon -- before cooperation begins.
@NickRiccardi Why wouldn't they have similar letters from his college years, his law school years, etc...?  Lots of due diligence goes on behind the scenes.
@tedlieu Great. Make sure when you request a hearing in writing that you include Samantha Powers alongside Nikki Haley among your witness demands. We'll notice.
Alternatively, it might be that Republicans knew there was going to be an anonymous, hard-to-substantiate claim against him at the 11th hour, and were prepared. https://t.co/iDHPVjo5an

This is apparently not a parody. 		The fine people of South Yorkshire are to report "offensive or insulting comments," whether "online, in person or in writing," TO. THE. POLICE.  		Because they won't tolerate even semi-hate-crime-incident-moments, or something. https://t.co/KTmXlrCuGf

Okay, so CNN's poll crosstabs show Trump's approval/disapproval spreads as both 35-57 and 36-58. And RealClearPolitics is reporting it as 37-57. What gives? Three different ways of rounding? I'm genuinely perplexed. https://t.co/97SJrTqQe5
Hey @CNNPolitics poll guys ... how come your poll data is reported with two different approve/disapprove spreads? I'm not being a smart-aleck. I really want to know.   cc: @brianstelter   https://t.co/njzgilQK9o https://t.co/mZs78wPJS5
@CelinaSalazar12 @HowardKurtz All part of the service here and David's house of odd knowledge ...
@brianstelter Right. Also push-button polls tend to give Trump an easier go of it. I still believe the Trump Effect is a real thing -- i.e. many people still don't want to tell another human being on the phone that they approve of the president. They'll tell a computer, though.
I mean this as an entirely rhetorical question, of course. https://t.co/eXXOTyFMvk

What it comes down to is that the White House is unwilling to list the things in Woodward's book that make him a "liar," relying instead on denials from three officials whose contested quotes figure in less than 10 of its 420 pages. https://t.co/9qOQ4lFsLs via @MailOnline
Perfect answer to my question would have been to toss me a copy of the Woodward book and say "Here's your list."
@MissoulaHome @PressSec I've read it. It would be more complicated, but that would hvae been good theater.
I asked @PressSec Sarah Sanders if the White House would give us a list of all the things in the Woodward book that are wrong. She said: "That would be a complete and utter waste of our time." OK then.

Trump has avoided talking about the anonymous @nytimes op-ed during his rally, but he addressed it in a taped @FoxNews interview (airing tomorrow) while the rally crowd watched. So everyone here has heard his views, but they weren't broadcast live.

Trump to Pete Hegseth, about the op-ed: "The Times should never have done that because what they've done, virtually, it's treason. You could call it a lot of things."
Trump just came into the arena and stood for an interview with Pete Hegseth that will air tomorrow of Fox News. The crowd of 10,000 or so was shocked.

@mac_of_all_macs "they are working for daddy in public sector." -- no, neither of them is working in the public sector.
@mac_of_all_macs They both work in the private sector. Secret Service still has a responsibility to protect them. Same, as one example, with spouses of every former president, but children get that during the presidency.
Catching up with two weeks' worth of news from my vacation. That's ... let's see ... about 24 bajillion news cycles.
@bradheath @Popehat Because you have to be really, really sure the public thinks the witch weighs the same as a duck, and is therefore made of wood. Jeez. Pay attention.

That's exactly right, and from his perspective Holder and Lynch were the ultimate flak-catchers, driven by fierce loyalty to build one political levee after another. He clearly thought Sessions would be cut from the same cloth. https://t.co/qJ6fm0oSd6
Someone better rewind the tape to Eric Holder. https://t.co/BXV9eR43Nt
The minute reporters start "fighting back," they sound like columnists. That's a credibility-killer and plays directly into the hands of him-who-shall-not-be-named. See "Ryan, April" and "Karem, Brian." TV hosts with their own shows can weather that. Most in the profession can't. https://t.co/CzjKChMwdn
At the rate the NFL is going, its ratings will long have cratered by then and there won't be an NFL. The Kaepernick controversy, and Trump's role as a force-multiplier, may well kill the whole thing. https://t.co/t7D1HLPygK

@JeromeTaylor It means nothing, aside from its propagation as a Democratic Party talking point.
@JeromeTaylor Yes, I think it should be ignored.
@JeromeTaylor Get back to me when the DOJ starts arresting reporters. We should be honest enough to distinguish between hot coals and hot air. No despotic country has ever needed an American president's permission to act despotic.
It might mean your reading of things is wrong. https://t.co/DkDfLeg620
This is what an actual, non-play-acting attack on the press by an authoritarian government looks like. It's outrageous. https://t.co/f9dhIQwbeg
No.  Eric &amp; Don Jr. didn't "spend" $200,000. Secret Service did. Can you imagine the fallout if a drug lord or ISIS mullah kidnapped one of them? It could spiral into a national security crisis. Whatever CREW's partisans say, it's money well-spent based on longstanding policy. https://t.co/mlMprV0weI
No. Donald Trump "loaned" Air Force Two to the McCains. That's an aircraft that belongs to the American people. He personally owns a 757 and a Citation X. (Not that the McCains would ever have considered using the 757: It has "TRUMP" emblazoned on it in giant letters.) https://t.co/fu48VoqWG9

So bishops who agree with Francis's climate and immigration politics are defending him despite his apparent inaction on sexual abuse. (I mean, sure, given how studio and network heads' commercial successes still seem to trump the #MeToo movement, why not?) https://t.co/blz1E2q817

This is the same building whose $1.45 billion cost Trump groused about last year in Brussels as he scolded allies for skimping on defense spending. Sen. McCain's own qualifications aside, most federal lawmakers are already monuments to financial profligacy https://t.co/9vvCWUPJuH

Dear @WyndhamHotels -- I'm up tweeting at you instead of sleeping because there's a dog yapping in the room next to me, about 45 minutes after my first call to your front desk. The forecast in Virginia Beach will probably call for a refund.
The last thing we need in America is a birthright aristocracy. Republicans might remember that Lisa Murkowski became a nettlesome swing vote via appointment when her father resigned. (And at least she was a state legislator at the time.) https://t.co/JNxNGyd2aF

If the Vatican paid mere lip service to clipping McCarrick's wings amid sex abuse allegations, that's a scandal in and of itself. And if the sanctions were real, and McCarrick went to Iran anyway to negotiate for Americans' release, the State Department also looked the other way. https://t.co/MLUOmU1kPD
Somehow I suspect Sen McCain read this on some heavenly iPhone and thought: "My God, it's RAIN, people!" https://t.co/mZTR4fTJmM

@KatCapps @JenniferJJacobs That ship sailed when I pushed it from the dock last year.
Even more likely is that Trump himself put this in circulation. He has the incentive to do it since the quote gives him a way to get a pre-election "win" that is modest but face-saving. https://t.co/joVOB3GRes
Let's not discount the possibility that Trump's famously leaky White House, and not Bloomberg, was itself responsible for breaking the rules here. Bloomberg has zero incentive to drop off-the-record quotes to a competitor (The Toronto Star). Cc: @JenniferJJacobs https://t.co/Gl5cP8J9bC

Re-reading Zinsser's "On Writing Well" (which I highly recommend).
