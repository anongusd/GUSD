@4YrsToday @madmamma4 He had felonies, men and trannies
@AOC Speak to Christopher Monckton he will show you your error
@HillaryClinton @fams2gether @ACLU @CBP This didn't concern you during the time you were Obama's minion as SecState
@Aikens_Josh @LisaSmith4680 It is not regulation to enforcing free speech on social media platforms.   It is regulation when there is suppression of free speech by these companies.  Maybe they need to be treated like utilities.

@KamalaHarris This is not inclusive.  Where are the transgender people in this photo that your party supports?
@mysterysolver3 @RealJamesWoods Don't come illegally then no problem
@Vicky4Trump @IlhanMN You've never visited the Twin Cities.  It really is the Somali Republic
@Patrici15767099 I wonder if she thinks an ex-post facto law will clean up her past? 😉
@Thomas1774Paine She got that information from her brother,  I mean her husband
@Thomas1774Paine I DON'T CARE
@RepSwalwell Good economy, low unemployment,  biggest wage increases since the Great Depression.   Can't have him showing all you other hacks up now can we?
@KamalaHarris Wage growth under Trump is best since the Great Depression https://t.co/tFBTQ3aR2J
@HFiskJohnson @rrgelm @SCJohnson Go talk to Asia they represent 87% of the problem.   USA only 3%
@RepAdamSchiff How about all the Clinton staffers that could not get one dye to drug problems and financial problems until Slick Willy ordered it?
@The_Trump_Train @emmy600 And Planned Parenthood then donates to libtards
@mitchellvii Money
@Thomas1774Paine Why not, Bernie needs another house
@CNNPolitics He won't be last a year in the campaign
@ChuckCallesto Oh yes she can and will vote for him!  Just not legally
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden Creepy Joe?  I disagree
@Acosta You misspelled Fake News
@NBCNews How did NBC phrase it when Reagan walked away from Gorbachev in Iceland?  The following year Reagan concluded a successful deal
@mamason10 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive I think she won a rigged popular vote.  Democrats will win popular vote in 2020 by cheating like you have never seen before.
@KTHopkins @stevekloscak @WestYorksPolice That is assimilation in action
@SenSanders Comrade, if we Medicare for all, all medical care will be rationed
@Thomas1774Paine He wouldn't make it to prison if he testified against Hillary
@PrisonPlanet Isn't that what the left would call being an Islamaphobe?
@senatemajldr This was the plan when Obamacare was passed.  Don't act so surprised
@SenSanders @RepRoKhanna Yet Cohen testified that he had no evidence of collusion lol.  You took a lake house for throwing the election to Hillary.   Your wife is likely an unconvicted criminal
@SenSanders https://t.co/mDlGwraxWn
@SenSanders Comrade,  don't do drugs!!!
@Thomas1774Paine Wait until his supporters learn that free stuff is not free
@TimRunsHisMouth We are allowing the Democrats to control the direction of the narrative.   So are Congressional Republicans.   Republicans have the majority in Senate.  Time to stop this.
@emennes1 https://t.co/L5WbnRFD2l
@emennes1 Wonder if Imran is next
@SenSanders You got a lake house for throwing the election to Hillary
@SenSanders Yet Cohen said he had no knowledge regarding Trump and Russia, lol
@SenSanders These policies speed corporate desire to automate and will hasten the demise of low wage jobs.  Look at kiosks in McDonald's.   Education and skills are only solution to this problem and government getting out of the way and let business develop
@SenSanders Neverending story, Comrade Bernie.   When consumer prices increase those $15 an hour workers will need a new increase in minimum wage  and so on and so on and so on......
@AMike4761 I remember the argument to let professional athletes in.  It's supposed to be the best athletes in the world.  Well, if the best athletes are men so be it.  I have not watched since they allowed pros and won't now
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive But they can allocate any way they want.  Look Democrats are scared, they have to change the rules to ensure a victory.  Who does that?  Cheaters and paid minions hellbent on power and changing this country.  We have to take back our states and every level of government
@JimW_in_NM @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive Read this https://t.co/5HA8y4EDCv
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive I agree
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive https://t.co/5HA8y4EDCv
@cjgodiva1977 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive I do not agree but Constitution is silent on state allocations https://t.co/5HA8y4EDCv
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive I never said I agreed but Constitution does not have much to say about how states allocate
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive Not according to this article https://t.co/5HA8y4EDCv
@freedom7930 @KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive Actually there is nothing in Constitution that says they can't do that.  It merely says how the States see fit to allocate.  I think it is wrong too but just saying
@BreakingNLive Sadly, the Constitution has little to say how States allocate electoral votes.  I believe that states have this right even if the citizens of those states disagree.  The people must take back their states.  https://t.co/5HA8y4EDCv
@KoleyPONeill @BreakingNLive Not that I agree with this insanity but don't states have the right to apportion their electoral votes any way they want?
@theblaze @Dnewl62 She should lead by example and be spayed
@GOPLeader More sacrifices to Moloch
@mrchrisnewton @DavidJoBrexit Maybe it never was
@Thomas1774Paine Jussie can get that help in prison
@JohnBrennan Are you referring to the liars like yourself?
@sxdoc I agree that liberals should not reproduce
@cvpayne We will or are using economic force already.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Lately, hate crimes are a hoax.  Law enforcement and courts will enforce real hate crimes already on the books.  Trying to persecute a POTUS for not saying what you want to hear is easy.  Talk about his accomplishments instead.
@marcorubio Build the wall.  Your first duty is to Americans
@RealJack Beyonce will them make DNC donations with that same taxpayer money.   This is how you do it.  Same thing Planned Parenthood does.  In criminal enterprises it is called money laundering.
@marmas56 @wikileaks Gold dinar for oil instead of US dollars https://t.co/pH4VWkDXUm
@Kam222Kay Hope that evidence comes out and is verified
@HillaryClinton Interference? @donnabrazile giving you the questions in advance couldn't help you.
@HillaryClinton @politico Voter ID will stop direct interference in American elections.  Any advertising or persuasion is perfectly legitimate since even the candidates and parties engage in both.  You should support the wall and voter ID for that reason.
@dcexaminer Amen
@liberalboxer @SenSanders Except the lake house he got for throwing the election to Hillary
@ChrisJZullo @SenSanders Yet it does have a price tag.  Nothing is free

@RaferWeigel @TexasNanaTam I bet on his Aunt Kamala Harris's orders
@brithume His Aunt Kamala Harris should have paid him more
@Vicky4Trump @donlemon Jussie is Kamala Harris nephew
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Jussie is Kamala's nephew
@marklutchman @hwholcomb Jussie is Kamala Harris nephew
@ABC Does he owe Aunt Kamala Harris bail money?
@Breaking911 @AndrewsHarley Did his Aunt Kamala Harris pay his bail?
@chuckwoolery Maybe his Aunt Kamala Harris had some influence
@AP You misspelled Kamala Harris's nephew
@Kel_C_Rae @Priyank_Parikh @graviolis @javiouslyy @AP How about let the evidence speak and determine the truth tellers in all cases
@SenSanders I like free market economics.   If I don't like my pay I can seek higher paying job or increase my skills to earn more money.  Your solution assumes a stationary marketplace.   I prefer a dynamic free market with upside mobility.
@VRXDirtyPaws @MDClib @2008kansaschamp @AOC So pick and choose which items are guided under free market capitalism versus socialism?  The problem is noone wants their property under socialist control just your neighbors.  Socialism reduces everyone to the same level of misery
@TomFitton Can you file any legal requests to get Jussie Smollett phone records?  We would like to know whom he was calling repeatedly. It might be other people like Kamala Harris or FBI never Trumpers.  Sure would be interesting.   @realDonaldTrump
@TimRunsHisMouth Jussie Smollett is Kamala's nephew.  What a coincidence!!
@VRXDirtyPaws @MDClib @2008kansaschamp @AOC Oh you are talking about economic convenience and not economic profit.  I don't think you get it both ways.  Who wants to buy a house in a stagnant economy?  Maybe work on increasing income in robust economies is the solution?
@RepSwalwell Maybe buy another fake dossier and start over?
@Rome_Fell 50 cent is a 4 bit hustler
@Rome_Fell @WhiteHouse @tladd58 Money is fungible
@GKeile @sfatigate So I guess this confirms that Trump was correct when calling this a shithole country
@PastorDScott Send SWAT team in and leak it to CNN.  Don't they understand procedures?
@vdare @BFleming101 https://t.co/j0Pg4czT3E
@ABCPolitics You misspelled "joined ISIS and is an enemy of the USA "
@EricKlemstein @tedlieu @mschlapp Best tweet I read today.  Amen
@xan_desanctis Need more sacrifices to Moloch?
@RepSwalwell You are wasting taxpayer money with your lunacy, get quickest coffee you can and get your ass back to work.
@AOC One thing says what an idiot you are and it is clearly written on that billboard.  Please read and comprehend
@MDClib @2008kansaschamp @AOC How do you get priced out of your home?  You bought it at a fixed price and that does not change.  A higher selling price means you have a capital gain.  Who does not want to sell their house for more than they paid for it?
@FromCave @BarbieWoodside CNN?
@dcexaminer AOC
@AnnCoulter Getting wire transfers from Mittens?
@NikkiHaley @fawnie14 Makes you miss, J. Edgar Hoover doesn't it? 🙃

@Comey You were the weaver of a web that trapped yourself.   I love irony
@TimRunsHisMouth Maybe he will get a Mansion this time instead of a lake house
@karli_bonne @BlueSea1964 Where is his friend Marty and that Delorean?
@chuckwoolery I know people who get lake houses to throw elections.
@KaitMarieox Except if they are really like Chairman Mao, Lenin or Stalin then there will not be an election
@w_parro @schjon @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump But not all Canadian's have that financial freedom.   Taxes should be raised so all Canadian people can get free medical care in the country of their choice
@GeneEsposito19 @RealGacinski @AngelGotti5 @Comey @FBI Gone are the good old old days when that pillar of virtue, J Edgar Hoover, ran a shining example of a non corrupt organization https://t.co/LxjSMfND7F
@IDGTechTalk Get AI
@BernieSanders I want a lake house then we can talk
@TaxReformExpert @HugoBossFedUp He stands up for lake houses
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Sadly, they will add 5 million
@zerohedge @deplorable_gigi Aren't the liberal re-education camps (public school system) that we fund effective enough?
@synchrony What about social justice in advertising?
@w_parro @schjon @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump What if heart surgery? My Canadian friend took his own cash and went to USA years ago because he could have died on the waiting list.
@BernieSanders Only if I get fractional ownership of the lake house, Comrade
@charliekirk11 @hrtablaze All economies are capitalist.   The question is who owns the capital,  Comrade
@JesseKellyDC Does the Clinton Foundation have enough money left to rig the nomination and buy another fake dossier?
@WSJ Is another lake house forthcoming?
@RealSaavedra So saith the man who honeymooned in the Soviet Union
@schjon @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump And 21 week waiting lines for medical treatment https://t.co/Eik7IOHNrT
@NBCNews Also promises to get a 2nd lake house out of the deal
@1776Stonewall Same firm used by Blasey-Ford
@AP This is good.  It is better than giving the government a no interest loan.  They should be delighted they had full use of their money.
@wikileaks I guess the DNC is not going to give him another house
@wikileaks He needs another lake house?
@HillaryClinton Real national emergency:  You paying for a fake dossier and an attempted coup
@HillaryClinton Real national emergencies:  You allowing classified emails to be sent on a private server.  Pay to play.  Pedogate.
@thehill Nice attempt at a shift of narrative.   Won't work.  Q sent us.
@thehill Alan Dershowitz says that 25th amendment has only to do with an incapacitated or absent POTUS.   Like when Reagan was in surgery.
@NevadaJack2 Show it
@peterbakernyt They are self destructive
@wikileaks @rogerwaters Assange can leave his self-imposed exile any time he wants.
@silkydarling @GeorgeTNeill @sarahwoodwriter @SenSanders Minimum wage increases raise  prices.  Leaving those @ bottom of economy paying more for everything but not gaining economic ground.  Self betterment n education are keys 2 climbing the socioeconomic ladder and not legislation.  But it it does allow for a never ending complaint.
@SenSanders Increasing profits increase income tax revenue and also cash available to average investors in dividends.  How is that a bad thing?
@SenSanders I don't think he supports Tom Steyer
@organicfanatic5 @iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders Try this as a primer https://t.co/0ZzGuMxVpZ
@organicfanatic5 @iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders 😁 When all else fails resort to personal attacks
@organicfanatic5 @iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders The federal reserve is not a government agency it is a private corporation owned by 12 banks. Read the book called the creature from jekyll island
@organicfanatic5 @iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders Actually the federal reserve issues the currency if you look on any of the currency it says federal reserve note. That is debt Congress approves the printing of a $1 bill and the federal reserve prim said and loans it to us at 17% interest
@organicfanatic5 @Hsquared71F @iplumbright58 @SSWorks @SenSanders @joefirestonephd https://t.co/QhWiv4IUIs
@christi53723307 @SSWorks @SenSanders Top 20% pay 87% of all taxes.  How much more should they pay of public projects?
@christi53723307 @SSWorks @SenSanders https://t.co/6moTOFkdC8
@IlhanMN Is your husband,  I mean your brother?
@organicfanatic5 @Hsquared71F @iplumbright58 @SSWorks @SenSanders Sound money is the basis for our democracy and people should look at the coin act of 1794 it is still the law of the land
@organicfanatic5 @Hsquared71F @iplumbright58 @SSWorks @SenSanders We need to get rid of  Federal reserve notes
@organicfanatic5 @Hsquared71F @iplumbright58 @SSWorks @SenSanders I absolutely agree with you. But our money is debt and inflation is necessary in order to have debt money until it collapses
@organicfanatic5 @iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders It has always been raided
@The_Real_Aslen @SSWorks @SenSanders The rich pay 85% of all taxes collected.  So 85% of all roads, schools and government facilities are paid for by the rich.  How much more is fair share?
@christi53723307 @SSWorks @SenSanders Government cannot afford to pay out more
@iplumbright58 @Hsquared71F @SSWorks @SenSanders All prior administrations borrowed from it
@senatemajldr You are using the liberal phrase "secure the border".  Build the wall
@Patrici15767099 @txblondegrad Muslexit is necessary
@Thomas1774Paine @txblondegrad Class
@SenSanders Nothing should be automatic.   Prove citizenship first.  Anything automated will be abused by continuing to register illegals and fictitious voters.  Democrats have perfected this
@Patrici15767099 Waiting for New York to impose an exit Visa system.  Maybe they will build a wall to keep them in.
@RepAdamSchiff 1.  Ms13.  Kate Steinle et. Al.	2.  Drugs	3.  Build the wall
@GeraldoRivera If you like dudes
@AP Build the wall
@IlhanMN I think your party has demanded your apology.
@SenSanders Tax increases on wealthy raise prices for everyone else since they transfer tax costs to purchase price increases.  Rather than attempting to make rich more poor, how about creating policies that increase Americans opportunities to increase wealth.
@robreiner Planned Parenthood does that every day
@DVATW @DavidJoBrexit God save the Queen
@SenSanders Would this increase government funding of Planned Parenthood which in turn would fuel greater campaign donations from Planned Parenthood to the Democratic party?
@SenSanders Let free market sell creative policies where I can choose my coverage and my deductible.   Also allow sales across state lines
@SenSanders When will you start using horse and buggy?  Oh wait, horse flatulence.   Call PETA to humanely destroy all animals.  Start walking.  Sell the house you got for throwing the election to Hillary.   This way you can reduce your carbon footprint
@wikileaks Whatever
@SenSanders If someone were to make a serious and credible allegation against you, is that enough for you to resign?  What about due process,  comrade?
@SenStabenow Dotard
@AOC Wins like yours teach us all to vote socialism down everywhere else
@AOC You ran in an extremely liberal and socialist district.  Stalin or Lenin would win there.  Don't kid yourself.  Any Democrat would win there no matter who they are.
@Thomas1774Paine If Occasio-Cortez talks less she will reduce her carbon footprint
@marcorubio Build the wall.  Your first duty is to protect Americans
@SenGillibrand Will you accept donations from Planned Parenthood?
@AOC Everything is better under Trump.   Quit trying the Goebbels propaganda
@washingtonpost His effective tax rate on the Rachel maddow release was 31% which was higher than other presidents
@senatemajldr How about strengthening America at home by building the wall?
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Bernie threw an election and got a house lol
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Politicians take taxes and reward the wealthy directly or indirectly lol
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Then your goal of income equality is never reached lol
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Nope
@SenSanders How about check the voter rolls and verify no fraud? Only reason you won't is you know there is a fraud
@SenSanders https://t.co/ir3U7yikJV
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders If taxes are raised on wealthy, it becomes a pass through cost to consumers who perpetually have to pay more.  That's a factor for inflation.  Them more calls for minimum wage and tax increases.  Never ends until your economy is Zimbabwe
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders You suggest middle and lower not earn it.  How is that ethical?
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Middle and lower class will use money to buy from rich.  Then what?
@nypost So did electoral votes between 2000 and 2010 for New York https://t.co/PuwFiK22Wk

@outlawjw @AvidreaderinVA Occasio-Cortez's policies make even communists and bankers green with envy
@Jilchrest As much ammunition as it takes!  You are a nut job
@SenSanders Sell the house you got for throwing the election to Hillary and give the money to average americans,  then we'll talk
@9e76a351efa944f @SenSanders Cash is being repatriated since tax cut
@SenSanders Are only billionaires invested in the stock market? How many average people's pension funds are?
@Thomas1774Paine @Zoom81 Let freedom ring lol
@SenSchumer @nytimes @SenSanders Why is wealth a sin?  I thought pursuit of happiness was in the Declaration of Independence
@SenSanders Getting rid of ohbummercare will help to reduce drug costs
@AOC This is stupid.  I thought you were an econ major
@AOC Also can start parking money overseas again at no to lower tax rates
@AOC A counter strategy is to incorporate and make those investments at a corporate tax rate of 21%. Then pay yourself a de minimis salary nowhere near 70%. Your high rate is largely symbolic
@AOC Prices will skyrocket with a 70% rate since tax costs are passed through to buyers.   How would that help those not paying 70%
@BostonGlobe The 2016 election, which is the poll that matters, still says Trump was elected to build the wall
@ewarren Moral expediency is worse.  Please resign
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Not as many as the American taxpayer is paying for through funding of Planned Parenthood.  If your claim is true it would have been voluntary which the Democrats  preach is good.  Defunding of PP means I will not be forced to pay for anyone's abortion
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump That is not what New York just did
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump If those countries are not shitholes then the caravans can pick one of those countries to seek asylum and you should be ok with it.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump SOB is not a racist comment
@RepSwalwell @HouseJudiciary Eric this is the one issue you will lose.  Americans will not allow you to take our guns.
@SenGillibrand You getting any taxpayer money filtered through Planned Parenthood?
@SenSanders Free market capitalism does not guarantee income equality only oppressive communism guarantees equal misery for all.  Free market capitalism does guarantee all the opportunity to become wealthy.  I prefer the opportunity that it affords.
@KamalaHarris Identity politics creates divisions.   You are on wrong side of history
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Explain the great economic results, Chuck
@imillhiser When you limit others potential wealth, you limit your own, unless you practice cronyism which I suspect you do
@GovernorVA Your words about abortion till delivery contradict this tweet
@MarkHerringVA @GovernorVA @RalphNortham The Governor is doing a good job of that with his own words.
@flywithkamala @senatemajldr The barriers we need is a wall which will dry up the illegal voters the Democrats desire
@JohnBrennan Seems POTUS is doing a better job than your assessment
@MarkBurnight @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump In Afghanistan the poppy business is alive and well
@MarkBurnight @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Syria is not destabilized as Hillary wanted.  Pipeline geopolitics.   Assad still in charge
@RepDanCrenshaw I think not.  Maybe those employees would decide to vote inept legislators out.  That makes you accountable for your actions.  I like that.

@RichLowry The requirement is to deliver state of the union there is no specification as to where.  Tradition is House but Speaker has no power to stop it.  Trump should go on TV and do it

@senatemajldr I disagree, we need a less costly government.   Leave it shut down
@SenSanders Nothing on your list is free
@Patrici15767099 Then government expenditures represent too big a percentage of GDP
@SenSanders Trump cutting corporate tax rates is causing less overseas stashing of cash.

@AngelFoxToday71 @wikileaks Torture has been illegal for a long time.  US Senate also affirmed in 2015. https://t.co/5Qb8j9ZGFr
@AngelFoxToday71 @wikileaks USA has not threatened torture
@SenSanders Are you celebrating in the house you got for throwing the election to Hillary?
@wikileaks Just leave the embassy.  You are the one detained yourself with a self imposed exile
@Taoistguy457 Not from those people.  This is not a high holy day for their ilk.
@ArtImus1962 @USArmy @DNC Only action will prove that
@SenBobCorker Build the wall
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks If USA wants to prosecute him.  I would prefer to do battle under 1st Ammendment.   I think Assange would prevail.  I would think he would be eager for that.  But the PR raises more money
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks That is correct.  There was no conviction.   Right now I am not aware of any charges against Assange because Sweden dropped their claim
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks No conviction by any court
@LoriinUtah @beth2_k3a Sound money
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks Human rights connotes something beyond oneself
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks The only human right Assange is fighting for is his own. He is like the guy in prison on a hunger strike that demands freedom or he will die. He wants guarantees before he steps out that is called extortion
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks Wikileaks announced that they see libel suits as a source of long term funding and then asked for donations so they can sue.  Looks like they are playing both sides.

@SenSanders How is the free vacation house you got for throwing the election to Hillary?
@SenSanders Build the wall.  Money saved supporting illegals can go to helping impoverished CITIZENS!!!!!!
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks The self-imposed exile is a way to stay in the news which is a free PR campaign that raises a lot of donations.  Better to play that card as long as possible than resorting to hustling a buck selling advertising
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks Self-imposed exile once again.  Bottom line is that Assange can come out and deal with any legal action that MIGHT be brought against him.  He has enough public sentiment to cause governments to proceed carefully.  Last I heard is Sweden dropped their active claims
@markcurtis30 @wikileaks @DeidreBrock @JonathanPlaid @DanCardenMP @johnmcdonnellMP @CatSmithMP @DougChapmanSNP @lloyd_rm @DerbyChrisW @CarolineLucas The UK government has not sentenced Assange to anything.   Assange went into a self-imposed exile.
@gugge_ @thehill @wikileaks Name the court that legally sentenced him.  You can't.   His exile is self-imposed.   I guess joke is on you
@SenSanders Sherman Antitrust Act

@abysinnia54 @markcurtis30 @wikileaks @DeidreBrock @JonathanPlaid @DanCardenMP @johnmcdonnellMP @CatSmithMP @DougChapmanSNP @lloyd_rm @DerbyChrisW @CarolineLucas The fact is Assange voluntarily walked into the Ecuadorian embassy.   That cannot be disputed.  Sweden has since dropped their issue.  Do not throw case law to try to cover those facts.
@SenBobCorker Bye Bob
@WikiLeaksShop @wikileaks Self-imposed exile is not house arrest!
@AP That is Japan's laws.  So what.
@thehill @wikileaks Assange is free to leave whenever he wants.   His exile is self-imposed and voluntary.
@JesseKellyDC https://t.co/TS8RU1gGfN

@marcorubio Build the wall across the southern border

@marcorubio Build the wall across the whole southern border.  Building part of a wall funnels illegals to where there is no wall.
@Reuters @wikileaks Assange is free and can leave any time he wishes.  His isolation was voluntarily self-imposed
@markcurtis30 @wikileaks @DeidreBrock @JonathanPlaid @DanCardenMP @johnmcdonnellMP @CatSmithMP @DougChapmanSNP @lloyd_rm @DerbyChrisW @CarolineLucas Assange is free.  His exile is self-imposed.
@UN_SPExperts @wikileaks There is noone imprisoning Assange.  He voluntarily hid in the embassy.  He can leave whenever he wants.  He is seeking guarantees before he leaves which is blackmail or extortion.   He is free now.

@paladin40cal I wonder if it is possible to build the wall out of the defense budget?

@We3forDemocracy Akin to the guy who goes on hunger strike until he gets his way.  Assange wants guarantee before he steps out.  It is no different.  He would receive treatment in American prison if that is where he ends up

@ByronYork By having a public hearing he also eliminates the chance the he can be asked classified questions which get to the core of the matter. This is deceptive on the part of Comey
@Thomas1774Paine Does anyone wonder why New York lost electoral votes between 2000 and 2010?
@Thomas1774Paine She got rent money in exchange for supporting Pelosi
@PoliticallyRYT @LTC_FOB Dad
@Patrici15767099 The troops would cost the same 72 million even if they were in their barracks.  So not costing us a dime more to have at border.  The politicians are are playing a semantic shell game.

@SenSanders @RepRoKhanna Why do you think legislating wages is the answer?  I think if you do not like your job, go find a new job.
@JebBush How about before?  You just don't get it Jeb!
@ScrewedHumans I disagree.  Think Chicago and that they issue id's to anyone including illegals.  When voter ID is required more liberal cities will adopt Chicago's policy.  Build the wall and keep them out

@tedcruz But the democrats are not better than those they may have mailed to themselves looking for sympathy votes
@LauraLoomer Just Jared to make republicans look like democrats in terms of violence like antifa and all of the Soros funded organizations

@DailyCaller @AnilNS425 False flag
@GeraldoRivera The entire paid resist movement which includes these paid invaders is a tactic to make it cost the country at every turn.  I liken it to ninth circuit injunctions that delay and cost.
@GeraldoRivera Migrants neither carry their home country's flag nor get paid.  Migrants seek a better life and look to assimilate.  These are at very least paid protestors and at most angry invading mob all meant to raise the costs to govern until USA can no longer respond.  Communist tactic
@SenJeffMerkley Don't be illegal
@AP You should correct the word "migrant" since it is also poorly worded.  Migrants don't carry their home country's flag.  "Invaders" may be better wording.  It is certainly more accurate.

@JohnCooper0610 @Jali_Cat @realDonaldTrump But these efforts are also an attempt to make it cst the USA at every turn just like every Democrat lawsuit and injunction against this administration.  The goal is to financially strain the USA into a communist agenda with no ability to stop it by overwhelming our system.
@JohnCooper0610 @Jali_Cat @realDonaldTrump If they walked they woul dnot arrive before midterm elections.  This is a clear attempt at putting issue front and center before midterms and attempting to paint Trump as inhuman.  It will fail even if Trump has to use the military to prevent it.

@NPC999919999291 @kennylatimer216 The leaders in a socialist state always get better than the masses.  At least our system allows anyone to become wealthy and more wealthy people can have that advantage.   What you are really advocating is stripping everyone of wealth.  Will still not make it equal.
@NPC999919999291 @kennylatimer216 Look at NHS in Britain.   No wealthy person uses it.  Why?  Because they know it is lousy care but good enough to placate the masses.  Kind of similar to Congress getting Cadillac plans.  Get used to the concept of wealthy having advantage even in socialist state.

@DRUDGE_REPORT Makes me wonder if Powell is a name in the sealed indictments.
@BrennaSpencer Makes you wonder what the next Democrat outrage will be?
@2naOnWhite @TigerPanthrHeat @NikkiVed1974 @patosada @AP No one has had a complaint about his 20 years on the bench as a federal judge or any of the decisions he has made
@jimgeraghty You must be being facetious because Congress stays Republican with perhaps even greater majority
@bayley_caaarrl @hrtablaze Wait till Trump replaces Ginsburg with Barrett
@bayley_caaarrl @hrtablaze Looks like tears for perhaps next 30 to 40 years
@FoxNews @Clark51Austin House and Senate stay red so don't worry
@RealJamesWoods @LM16612718 Having a Supreme Court that are majority originalists ensures that all citizens will be protected by the law.
@ebethisawesome Congratulations to Justice Kavanaugh!!
@FoxNews Irrelevant Justice K confirmed https://t.co/Bn8ayFOGsP
@Breaking911 Time for the next Democrat Party outrage.  What will it be?  Hmmmm
@anastasiakeeley @DemSocialists Stop the temper tantrum.  The police will be following you until you break the law and then you will be arrested.

@MollyRingwald It is no longer the Democratic Party to me it is the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati.  Followers of Moloch and the Order of Minerva
@SavedByGrace747 Yes, what if Kavanaugh self identified as a woman before testifying?  What a conundrum!
@ABIGAIL_GRITS I would get a bunch of pet pigs too
@AMike4761 A badge of honor I would proudly wear for my daughter.
@SenSanders LOL Bernie come on.  Name one sworn corroborating witness for Ford.  How's that new house you got for throwing the election to Hillary?

@SenatorFischer I will be pulling the Republican lever in the midterms.  I used to vote for the person but the Democrats don't have anyone left to vote for.  #MAGA
@gifa1gino @Kristin_Waller @happytabbysmile @SenatorFischer Only anyone Trump nominates before midterms LOL
@ChuckFrohberg @MrWilliamtoyou @SenatorFischer How come no one had any problem with his long history and court rulings on the Federal bench?  This is all about tipping the court red and maybe military tribunals :)
@MarrWilliams @SenatorFischer Stevens was also the nutjob that called for abolishing the 2nd amendment.
@MarrWilliams @SenatorFischer Ford's attorneys could have provided sworn statements from these alleged witnesses.  That is failure of her attorneys.  The 4 witnesses that Ford did claim could corroborate said they did not know what Ford was talking about.

Based on liberal logic, if women are to be believed and Kavanaugh were to self identify as a woman before he gave testimony, would she need to be believed?
@findtruthQ @Snap_Politics There will no lasting impact.  The Dems lose and Kavanaugh will be seated on SCOTUS.   The Dems will move on to the next outrage after the vote is done.
@noreallyhowcome @PatTheBerner This was all a delay job by Feinstein and the Dems.  They held the letter for 6 weeks https://t.co/bOWAqlm5C8
@LaughingSwann @1776Stonewall You think liberal heads are exploding now.  Wait till the next seat opens up and Trump nominates Amy Barrett
@LaughingSwann @1776Stonewall I know
@LaughingSwann @1776Stonewall I guess cloture rules prevent till saturday
@noreallyhowcome @PatTheBerner Trump very publicly said the FBI could talk to anyone they wish.  He said so on the lawn of the WH.
@noreallyhowcome @PatTheBerner Feinstein held letter for 6 weeks simply as a delay tactic.  If she had shared t immediately the investigation Dems wanted could have been easily done.  Playing games like Feinstein did damage to the process but that is on Dems.
@1776Stonewall 52-47 then
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome Not dumb at all.  Why didn't Ford's attorneys bring those 40 witnesses to testify at the hearing?
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome The accuser was interviewed in public and FBI and we can all have transcript.  There were no more facts to ascertain from Ford unless you feel that Dems were not thorough in their questioning.  But that would be their fault.
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome So since no sworn statements were submitted by Ford's counsel that means either malpractice on Attorney's part or no one would risk lying under oath.
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome Ford's attorneys could have provided sworn statements by the 40 witnesses to the Committee.  They did not because people did not want to give statement under threat of perjury.
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome There was public testimony under oath of both Ford and the Judge.  There was no need to talk to them but rather find a corroborating witness and therewas none
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome I have faith that Ford's attorneys asked all 40 for sworn statements.  I am certain the Dems chimed in on that request.  No takers Hmmmmmm wonder why?  Because she was lying
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome Democrats had 20 years of Kavanaugh on the bench and they had no problem in the past with his actions, decisions or temperament.  The reality is they do not want 5 conservatives on the court and maybe, military tribunals
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome If I brought an accusation against someone you can be assured I will have evidence and corroborating witnesses or testimony.  This was a con job by Ford and the Dems
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome The 4 she cited refuted Ford's claim.  This was such a public affair that a witness would step forward to corroborate if there was one.
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome This sounds like the Russia collusion hoax.  If anyone had anything they would trot it out very, very fast.  The Democrats would trip racing to a press conference to put it out there.  Don't be delusional.
@PatTheBerner @noreallyhowcome The accuser and accused were already interviewed in public hearing and under oath.  This issue hinged on the fact that the 4 witnesses that Ford claimed would corroborate her story all refuted her claim.  Are you suggesting we keep searching for a witness until we ask everyone?
@nedryun Or in jail
@emrata You should be arrested for this.  You can exercise your voice at ballot box  and letters to your rep
@FoxNews @NPete2 @JohnCornyn I think it's high time we adopt the Salem witch trial strategy and tie senators to chairs and throw them in the Potomac if they drown we will know that they are not a witch. Start with liberals

@Thomas1774Paine Doesn't this clearly show the complicity that Democrats and RINO's have with globalists?  If you did not think that NWO was real this should.  I think the UN has picked the wrong side of history imho
@AP Nothing ever will satisfy Democrats.  Just confirm Kavanaugh and seat him on the SCOTUS.  I want to find out about the possibility of military tribunals anyway
@SenSanders Have you pondered the effect of increasing wages?  it will cause the price of bread to increase and make even more working poor.  But this is your plan.  To create new victims that will embrace socialism.  Socialism reduces us all to the same level of misery in the end
@SenSanders By the way, how is the new house you got for throwing the election to Hillary?
@SenSanders If people do not like what they earn they are free to seek other jobs paying more.  You are acting as though Americans are all victims.  The only victimhood Americans face is of your socialist ideals
@SenSanders McDonald's is already replacing humans with ordering kiosks.  Hamburger making robots are being employed and humans eliminated.  Bernie these policies if implemented will be a pyrrhic victory as automation will eliminate almost all human labor in fast food
@BKaysac I was being facetious using Chuck Schumers 2A words.

@ShannonBream @MyPlace4U Ford already gave testimony under oath.  There was never a need to talk to her again.  There was a need to find corroborating witnesses and everyone contacted cannot corroborate her testimony.  She is not credible.

@SaraCarterDC Based on that logic is Whoopi Goldberg a potential child abuser?
@mitchellvii The next phase is saying that the FBI investigations  Not reliable
@brithume Now the narrative is being played out by Ford's attorneys that the FBI has not contacted them what they are ignoring however, is that forward already gave her testimony and the FBI is seeking corroborating testimony of which there is none
@AP I believe she already gave her testimony and I believe that the FBI would be looking for a corroborating testimony rather than give her a chance to change her story
@Thomas1774Paine Don't care what he thinks any longer.  Comey is irrelevant
@SheisfromBoston I find it funny when people use the word "loop hole".  The tax position is either allowed or disallowed by statute.  Gray areas exist when tax statutes are vague.
@SheisfromBoston Furthermore, people of Trump's income are under constant audit and generally will provide an office in his business for auditors to camp in and do their work every single day
@SheisfromBoston I am a corp tax professional.  The NYT article's claim that Trump has committed income tax evasion are patently false.  Trump has the kind of income to be audited every single year by Fed and State auditors.  If there was income tax evasion charges would have been made years ago
@SheisfromBoston Are they admitting that Donald Trump is a genius then?

@LaughingSwann This is the most fascinating article https://t.co/DH25imTikn
@LaughingSwann Well, we come back to symbolism and what it means to the Luciferians.  I guess we will agree to disagree on that
@LaughingSwann I try to research many things as I am a curious person and researched her as she was a worshipper of Baal.  I guess I like to understand our enemies.  The symbology being utilized caused me to start searching after the 2016 erection of Arch of Baal in NYC
@LaughingSwann Another interesting read https://t.co/xFkciq0Qvy
@LaughingSwann I think Jezebel was after the reign of Solomon but here is an interesting article https://t.co/ECevdRgVRD
@cheri4trump @Jamierodr10 I have been seeing that she works in Pharma marketing abortion pills.
@LaughingSwann I do believe it is good versus evil.  I used to not believe that.  When I was a boy my Grandma told me lots of religious things and I thought it was all make believe.  As I have grown older, I have understood her wisdom and come to believe for myself.
@bounty7337 @SarahLhl @TheLastRefuge2 I do not.  It is not admissible evidence.  Funny thing, the very lawyers that are representing her would say the same thing and then state it has no relevance.  But wouldn't that very argument make the 1st irrelevant and unreliable as well?
@LaughingSwann I believe God and Satan are very real personally.
@secupp @joey_tweedy Is it a smear if it is truth?
@LaughingSwann I recall the Zodiac Killer's use of them too.  Very weird stuff
@LaughingSwann I do believe in God and am alarmed at what the symbology suggests may be happening in our country and around the world.
@LaughingSwann LOL I agree.  Abnormal means not normal so there is no way for normal people to figure it out :)
@LaughingSwann An interesting thought is that whether one believes in God or not, symbology can provide clues to groups of people that do have a belief and, might therefore, act on it.  But now we are going into the field of psychology
@LaughingSwann I think what this issue comes down to is if people believe in God and Satan or if they do not.  If they don't then symbols would mean nothing to them; however, if they do then symbology has significant meaning.
@LaughingSwann Here is an example of Luciferian symbolism which I am sure you are well aware of as an archaeologist https://t.co/RCc19NYziQ
@LaughingSwann Here is an example of the use of pedo symbols that the FBI published  https://t.co/VxCZwB4sDd
@LaughingSwann It sure is a curious coincidence though if this is incorrect.
@LaughingSwann As you know the liberals have been decrying Kavanaugh's confirmation by stating it would threaten abortion.  And then we have a symbol that they believe has something to do with abortion or sacrificing of children, the Arch of Baal
@LaughingSwann I do not find it far-fetched that Luciferians would latch onto this Arch of Baal as something significant to their religion.  I find it very curious that one was constructed the day before Kavanaugh hearing in DC
@LaughingSwann The bigger point here is if a group feels that there is significance in a symbol then they establish it.  For example, swastika for Nazis.  History is replete with symbols.  The FBI has published symbols used by pedophiles.
@LaughingSwann What would be the need for 1000's of them around the globe then?  And why construct one in DC the day before the Kavanaugh hearings?
@LaughingSwann Jezebel. ... According to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible, Jezebel incited her husband King Ahab to abandon the worship of Yahweh and encourage worship of the deities Baal and Asherah instead.
@LaughingSwann The name is drawn from the Canaanite deity Baal mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the primary god of the Phoenicians. In this hierarchy, Baal is ranked as the first and principal king of Hell, ruling over the East.
@LaughingSwann It was the program of Jezebel, in the 9th century BCE, to introduce into Israel's capital city of Samaria her Phoenician worship of Baal as opposed to the worship of Yahweh that made the name anathema to the Israelites.
@LaughingSwann Baal. Baal, god worshipped in many ancient Middle Eastern communities, especially among the Canaanites, who apparently considered him a fertility deity and one of the most important gods in the pantheon.
@LaughingSwann The Temple of Bel (Arabic: معبد بل), sometimes also referred to as the "Temple of Baal", was an ancient temple located in Palmyra, Syria.
@LaughingSwann https://t.co/onopBwI2oW
I have read in other writings that states that Hillary is a High Priestess in this Satanic stuff.  I now believe she is.
Why did they install this the day before the Kavanaugh hearing?
It is also in NYC and London with plans to install 1,000's around the world.
What we have is evil in the world and the arch of baal was constructed in DC the day before the Kavanaugh hearing https://t.co/Wb575qfkWi  https://t.co/CzQI82OEXD

@Thomas1774Paine Seems like the age to vote should be raised to 21 in California then.
@Thomas1774Paine How about printing a plastic gun instead if you are under 21.
@MarkDice @CamilleGtine More accusers
@DailyCaller Elections determine winners and losers.  When the Dems win they get the choice.
@SenKamalaHarris You and your democratic party colleagues created the sham.  You will deny but you know you did.  Honestly, you do not deserve the privilege of voting on this matter.  You should keep walking home and abandon your political career.  Shame, shame, shame
@prayingmedic @FelizFlorecita1 I agree but I think there is an additional reason.  I am no expert but everything I am reading about trying American citizens as enemy combatants is that it requires SCOTUS approval.  Recall Graham's questions to the judge.  The guilty are very scared of this possibility.
@SenatorCollins @beth2_k3a You will receive the same information that the committee already knows from the testimony.  Specifically, statements from each side and no corroborating witnesses for Dr. Ford.  How will that help?  I think this is a delay till the next delay and Dems hanging hope on midterms.
@InGodIDoTrust @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/l37MFd6leR
@realJediMan @realDonaldTrump Might uncover the Ford connections to others which may be embarrassing
@DailyCaller Bet they would agree to an artificial limit after midterms
@MarkSimoneNY @DebraMMason1 NSA has it out in Utah
@MattsIdeaShop More accusers will be trotted out
@ChuckCallesto Stormy could learn from Dr. Ford.  The pole be damned!
@w_terrence Their parent's money so, it is up to the parents.
@RealJack @txblondegrad Demons are getting nervous.
@ComfortablySmug @MattsIdeaShop My 2 year old told me that she will pull the Republican lever in the midterms and that the Democrat party has not existed since JFK
@mitchellvii I would be on lookout for protesters over the next several days
@JackPosobiec Demons getting nervous.
@1776Stonewall Desperate people do desperate things
@1776Stonewall Go back to Graham's questions about trying Americans by military to Kavanaugh last week.  These people are scared and desperate because they know Kavanaugh will vote to allow it.
@BarbieWoodside Maybe a new accuser letter unveiled right before committee vote?  Accuser lawyering up?
@BrianKiley5 Did it myself with latest trip code and wow
@FoxNews @AlanDersh After the democrats have basically said the FBI did not do their job after 6 background checks why do the democrats then call on the incompetent FBI to do another investigation? Is it because rod rosenstein is in their hip pocket?
@FoxNews @AlanDersh If we do this I bet you it will go on longer than the mueller investigation no thanks
@dcexaminer @LATiffani1 If the clintons get involved I would have bodyguards 24 7
@Timcast @ashtonbirdie The democrats already declared war when the election was over in 2016
@CHIZMAGA @LANURSE1 I think that letter that was handed to the Ford lawyers is another accuser and they will unleash it to night or in the morning right before the vote
@ThomasWictor It is just his scars from the battlefield in Vietnam https://t.co/NcIdqZlbs4
@LauraLoomer @JacksonLeeTX18 Maybe it's a 5th accuser letter
@DailyCaller It is a wonderful thing that Kasich is irrelevant
@BeckySpartacus Michael Obama's adopted brother
@BryanESmithJr @1776Stonewall @PatriotHope Kavanaugh said that they may vote him down in the final vote but he said he would never quit. He echoes my sentiments exactly
@BryanESmithJr @1776Stonewall @PatriotHope People who went through the holocaust would tell you do not get on the train
@tedlieu Shame on you!
@BryanESmithJr @1776Stonewall @PatriotHope Libtards would rule us all if you don't vote.  I will not surrender
@LarrySchweikart Amey Connett Barrett
@17LadyLiberty76 Because I believe during Kavanaugh testemony some bomb shells are going to drop which discredit his accusers.  Trust Grassley
@EmmaVigeland Her short term memory and long term memory is bad but the only thing she certain of is the facts that stop the Kavanaugh confirmation process. This is BS and you know it
@Liz_Wheeler Wait for Kavanaugh's side of testimony
@InGodIDoTrust Then you will deserve what you get from Democrats.  I will not surrender
@cathleenedgerly @CyberDeathRay You are a nutjob to think that uncorroborated allegations should determine guilt of any man, woman or child.  #SalemWitchTrials
@CindyPonzi @FoxNews Fox is on Operation Mockingbird payroll like the rest of MSM.   It is all #fakenews
@SenSanders Vigorous cross examination is necessary to discern the truth, Bernie.  How's that new house you got to throw the election working out?
@KamVTV I don't think it is a disaster at all. Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  Democrats are destroying themselves and ginning up the Republican anger and voting base. Republicans could not gin up their base as well as the Democrats can.  We know how important midterms are to advance #MAGA
@mikebwonder @RonaldBruceBar3 I think the Democrats, through their smear campaign, are energizing the increasingly angry Republican voter base.  The Republicans could not gin up their base as well. https://t.co/Sm4IpLR9Sm
@JRubinBlogger @joey_tweedy The Duke lacrosse female liar was emotionally wrenching too but the men were exonerated years after their lives destroyed
@JRubinBlogger @joey_tweedy I think she is making this up or confusing the good Judge with the other men who claim responsibility.
@momonfyre @danojano @WhoWolfe Well they need offerings for Moloch
@BreitbartNews @AndrewsHarley I thought women were to be believed
@MichaelAvenatti I think Trump lives in your head.  Trump has no need to debate you.  I think you are self-aggrandizing a wee bit too much.  But hey you got that $10M judgment to pay off so grab any client you can.
@MayTalcott @AndrewsHarley No, had enough of long funerals after John McCain's, Erwin Rommel moment

@mitchellvii Ya but that is why the bodycount is accelerating
@TexHellCat @joey_tweedy I voted willingly for Trump :)
@tomselliott I was a virgin all the way through high school.  This was a quite normal thing when I was growing up.  Waiting till marriage is looking better all the time with the nutjobs out there making false accusations.
@Alyssa_Milano @AdyBarkan @womensmarch @CPDAction @BeAHeroTeam How does your misandry fit in those beliefs?
@EnergyPope @WizowskiG So if I get enough people to accuse you of something, even though they are all lies, some of them can stick to you and make you guilty?
@JohnKasich Good thing you don't matter in this confirmation then huh?
@ThomasWictor Devil's tail?
@FoxBusiness @soxfaninpa1 @SenSchumer Sorry Chuckie, elections have consequences.
@ananavarro @joey_tweedy I don't think so Ana.  I do remember a time when even Democrats like Creepy Joe Biden did not want an FBI investigation.  Let me take you down memory lane:  https://t.co/vkytr45Z0u
@MichaelAvenatti I don't think it is ONLY Bill Mitchell that sees right through you and does not respect you, Counselor.
@ZibaLady1 AMEN!!!!!!!!  I am with you sister.  God bless
@hrenee80 @flowersoffate That is how Democrats, Goebbels following Nazis, want you to feel.  Have no doubt, Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  Stand firm, have faith
@jihchs Democrats are attempting a coup and are now the party of Goebbels.  That's how.  Got to vote them out
@JacobAWohl Irrelevant already debunked.  Kavanaugh will be confirmed.
@Victor_Tancredi @AdamBaldwin @RealSaavedra LOL when your Bot your Hot!! https://t.co/FZvVkE6Z2F

@CHIZMAGA Well I am unsure because the Liberals have told us that not all men have a penis.
I personally believe we will get 1 to 2 new accusers every day until the confirmation vote on Tuesday.  Democrats have become Nazis and part of Goebbels.  #WalkAway
@MannoiaChris Lose elections
@BeckySpartacus That would be felony sexual assault and statutory rape by her.  Maryland has no statute of limitations on this.  The accuser should be charged in Maryland
@ananavarro @joey_tweedy Stop the misandry, Ann
@greybrick @senatemajldr Democrat replay after midterms lol https://t.co/sBwNZn91FI
@BreitbartNews Democrats have become the party of Goebbels
@ReutersPolitics @SenSchumer you can bring the 100 accusers out to smear the good Judge and I will still believe him.  You have become the party of Goebbels and you are the fascists.  I have never pulled a party lever in my life but I will pull Republican from now on.
@RealJack I pray that God opens the eyes of everyone to the evil doers in our government.   I also pray the the people vote the evil doers out of office.
@NRDC @EPA Maybe the babies are better served by being protected from Planned Parenthood

@gatewaypundit @CassandraRules Soros better be paying well to make an idiot out of herself
@SonofLiberty357 @gatewaypundit Since the FBI does not have jurisdiction in a state matter  The worst your client will face is lying to the FBI. If she files in Maryland and it's a false police report that is a different matter
@BrevetFlashman @MsAvaArmstrong @SonofLiberty357 @gatewaypundit None of them will fly. Maryland does not have a statute of limitations on felony sexual assault. The FBI does not have jurisdiction in this case it is a local matter. If she feels she has a valid claim she should file with the local authorities and let them investigate
@NeverDotard @joey_tweedy @smerconish But I suppose  Is difficult keeping them straight or remembering which one you were with if you're her
@NeverDotard @joey_tweedy @smerconish Avenetti was not trusted nor was Stormy.  In fact, Stormy kept changing her story
@MichaelAvenatti Maryland has no statute of limitations on felony sexual assault.  Why doesn't your client file charges in Maryland?  I guess filing charges in Maryland Carrie's a risk of charges if filing a false report, right counselor?
@MichaelAvenatti Privacy?  This was a reveal and you are baiting to generate privacy violations.  Actions of a political operative
@NeverDotard @joey_tweedy @smerconish Give one example when Avenetti was ever trusted.
@JRubinBlogger You'll get over it.
@BillOReilly Depression, Bill.  It's always the economy
@Education4Libs Well, she is a supporter of Moloch so she would know this.
@MichaelAvenatti Counselor, if your client feels that a crime has been committed she should contact her local police department and file a report. Demanding FBI investigations and non-confirmation shows this to be not credible and merely a political stunt.  Hope the money is good.
@LATiffani1 And all accusers suddenly die.

@yoni @mitchellvii In almost all cases I prefer the private sector to own and employ the capital
@yoni @mitchellvii The big difference in socialist and capitalist economies is who owns the capital

@PrisonPlanet They won't like the word libtard

@yoni @mitchellvii I am with you.  I would also like the government to get back to basics and downsize.  Let market be more self-determining.  Lot of details with that statement but you get the idea.

@RealSaavedra It is totally obvious they are on libtard payroll.   Noone even remotely intelligent says crap like this.

@Thomas1774Paine I guarantee you I will vote and I am so angry  That I would vote 5 times like a Democrat in the next election if I could sadly I can only vote once as a conservative
@Thomas1774Paine I think they need to retool their algorithm because all they are doing is ginning up and pissing off the conservative voter base. Watch for the red wave that is coming which will relegate the libtards to the dust bin of history
@Mimirocah1 @joey_tweedy Everyone sees the hit job the libtards are performing as well as the 2nd accuser forthcoming since the 1st is an alcoholic nutjob.  Keep gunning up Conservative voting base.  Conservatives could not do a better job at it.

@mitchellvii Democrat outrage gins up conservative base to vote.
@mitchellvii I believe all of the tactics employed by pollsters to lower the conservative voter turnout boomerangs and provides the opposite result.  Maybe they need to reprogram their algorithm https://t.co/c6Xon6F2d9
@Thomas1774Paine Oh Canada!!!
@FoxNews Since she is apparently afraid to fly, I think that she will either experience a mechanical failure with her car or perhaps a Fender Bender which will delay her on Thursday.
@AttorneyRyan @DiamondandSilk I think a 2nd accuser also.  Just needed time to scrub web and social media before new accusation
@Thomas1774Paine They should invite him to teach those laws school students that don't want Kavanaugh in their classroom anymore

@RawStory Did they search every female name in the yearbook or just this name.  Article does not elaborate
@RawStory Who got the data of his searches and how?
@DailyCaller I thought it was the Russians
@FOX4 Ted won.  Libtard should move to California

@Thomas1774Paine @welenaelena Fortunately CNN's rating are lower than HGTV reruns
@FoxNews The only fair is once a year at the fairgrounds.  She made accusation so time to put up or shut up.
@SenFeinstein So why did she lawyer up months ago and contact the Washington Post?  Get real.
@ChuckCallesto Would a male be able to negotiate testifying about a similar accusation with Congress?
@BrookeJensen18 @Wallace35106091 @EmilyLindin Don't we all wish that both sexes can respect each other instead of the politically correct male bashing as well.  Oh wait, all over 200 gender fluid sexes lol
This is a true He said, She said and Dems will point to that fact that women are to be believed so they are playing chess too
Besides delay tactic with Blasey Ford, Democrats are trying to gin up base by pitting Republicans against  women by the Democrat definition right before midterms.  Dems think if confirmed before midterms voters will backlash against Republican candidates #QANON
@TheEconomist Cashless society is most discriminatory.  If your politics are not liked govt could turn off cash card and may take months to get it turned on.  Having cash in pocket is great equalizer as you can still buy bread with cash and not politics which cannot be turned off.
@duster_john @jayMAGA45 @1Romans58 @ChuckGrassley @LRacheldG Probably tax dollars given to Planned Parenthood and then funneled to Soros backed 501c3's then paying for political organizing.  So not directly lol
@JordanSchachtel @busybe_ Millions will die lol
@SenGillibrand Her allegations have been treated properly as she has been invited to testify in private or public.  I suggest she testify under oath so she can either retract story or advance it with possibility of prosecution if she is lying.  Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  Now do Keith Ellison https://t.co/li6UfSyFq3
@SpeakerRyan Build the wall!!
@GovMikeHuckabee @Antoinotabot Cyrus will be reelected
@theMichele526 @OnlineMagazin @NowThinkAgain This is also why I will never live in Chicago

@RepAdamSchiff Have Ford testify under oath.  She can also retract.  If she lies she can face prosecution.

@beachlover1st @realDonaldTrump Americans voted POTUS in for many reasons, one being the wall

@EmilyLindin Now do Keith Ellison
@EmilyLindin Blasey cannot remember who, where or when.  Classmates she cited as corroborating witness have denied her claim.  Seems like thin ice.
@EmilyLindin Key words are "what if". Is the allegation alone the reason?  This is a dangerous idea which can boomerang on the liberals.  Does the "what if" apply to Ellison?  How about Bill Clinton.  Social justice does work as it is whims of people at that moment in time
@jpodhoretz @joey_tweedy Right up there with Churchill :)

@MountainLady1_ @BrettKavanaugh Well she blocked me.  I guess it gets difficult when the facts interfere with your victim ideology
@MountainLady1_ Only if Blasey Ford is willing to show up and testify.  My money is that the Kavanaugh confirmation goes through and he will be seated on SCOTUS
@MountainLady1_ @BrettKavanaugh Other women who dated Kavanaugh said that he was a complete gentlemen.  These were girls from the same highschool.
@MountainLady1_ @BrettKavanaugh Blaset cannot recall where, when or who was at the party.  Prior posts suggests she was an alcoholic at some point and overcame that.  Id she cannot remember things, who can say this recollection is not a flawed memory
@MountainLady1_ @BrettKavanaugh Everyone is flawed and has committed sins; however, classmates that Blasey Ford has cited as corroborating witnesses have stated they did not witness such an event or were even at the alleged party.
@MountainLady1_ It goes back to the fact that Anita Hill showed up at the hearing while Blasey Ford is refusing to publicly declare under oath.  This causes me to question her credibility.
@MountainLady1_ Why waste time and resources if it didn't happen and/or the statute has run?  As I recall Kavanaugh will be at hearing while his accuser will not be.
@FoxNews @SteveZmann People ALWAYS vote their pocketbooks except for the 10% that are ideologs.  Young people will vote for Trump in 2020.  Reelection in the bag.  I think this also means blue wave fizzles unless Libtards cheat.
@AnnCoulter Maxine Waters
@MountainLady1_ n Maryland, criminal statute of limitations varies depending on the severity of the offense. The criminal statutes of limitations include:		Felony sexual offenses: no statute of limitations, and	Misdemeanor offenses:  one year from the event.		Unless a felony, she is out of luck
@MountainLady1_ In Maryland, a civil sexual abuse case must be filed within:		In childhood sexual abuse cases, seven years from the victim’s 18th birthday, and	Three years from the event for adult cases.
@SenSchumer Too bad your daughter's girlfriend, you know, the 16 year old that you dated but committed suicide cannot call that number.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Will he make that promise under oath?  Please?
@realDennisLynch @AvidreaderinVA Like 3 year old's tantrum
@AP If you are an ILLEGAL ALIEN you have committed a crime.  You are arrested when you commit a crime.  Your story is propaganda.
@seanhannity All theater.   If Trump did not like Sessions, he would be fired in a NY second.
@JoeConchaTV Kavanaugh will be confirmed, libtards lose, then on to the next outrage.  This is just another rerun

@KurtSchlichter @KidCuellar Do they care as much for Juanita Broaderick and Paula Jones?  They really were victims not #FakeMeToo
@ChrisCuomo Noone gets the benefit of the doubt for the statute of limitations has run on the alleged crime.  That is, if it ever happened which is doubtful.  So there is no case at all.  Move on and confirm Kavanaugh
@AP Maybe the Palestinians should halt their hostilities then none of them would be killed.
@Lawrence FBI said 2 times they cannot investigate this matter not in their jurisdiction n too old.  Many witnesses Blasey Ford claims were there have refuted her n stated they were not there.  She cannot remember anything about where, when etc. this is a smear campaign and you know it.
@atensnut God bless you Juanita!!!
@senorrinhatch The NSA data archive which you lobbied to be built in Utah would have all of Blasey's FB posts etc. to prove her liberal political activism so maybe you can bring that data to the hearing and then vote and confirm Kavanaugh
@ChadPergram @LiberalsNo Maybe she should put some ice on that https://t.co/co5x71Kx94
@ChadPergram @LiberalsNo 35 years and therapy, I think that is time enough

@KenDilanianNBC @joey_tweedy A number of deplorables, dregs and Americans have said that people tryingto derail and delay the Kavanaugh confirmation until after midterms say that people who make up allegations do demand that the FBI investigate them even when 2X the FBI said they cannot on an issue this old.
@BChaseCrawford @chowdallas @SiddonsDan @Truthseeker126 @realDonaldTrump FB is losing millennials at a rapid rate.  Will be a social media of old farts.  Their influence will dissipate due to market dynamics such as these.

@AmyMek @shotgunss52 When we all have had enough and users start shadowbanning Twitter by deleting accounts en masse; that will be the day Twitter's stock tanks, ad revenue drops and Twitter will change their ways
@slpng_giants The FBI already stated they can't investigate something this old yet the accuser demands FBI investigation. Statute ran on this long ago so best she can do is court of public opinion.  Stall tactic by Democrats.   Ellisons accused field police reports, physical evidence, do him.
@emrazz You use the words "want to".  That sounds like an opinion.  If true, prove it with police reports or is all of this just as imagined as her allegation?  Emotional ploys for money only work on intellectually weak yet emotional people

@ceb5182 @guypbenson 1st of all even if this happened he was a minor. And if it was prosecuted then his record would have been expunged when he became an adult. She didn't bring this up for over 30 years statute of limitations has expired no big deal the lib tards can move on to the next outrage
@PureMichGirl @HugoBossFedUp Just do it lol
@JRubinBlogger No, Kavanaugh should be confirmed. Then the lib tards can move on to the next outrage I hope it's plastic straws because I like that 1
@tedcruz @peta Was it bacon wrapped?

@USAloveGOD @Jali_Cat @USAloveGOD2 The coming lawsuits will end this in a heartbeat.  Furthermore, liability insurance companies will shut this down before it becomes commonplace or insurance rates will go up necessitating millage increases to support higher and higher liability insurance rates.

@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor I suggest you read the book the creature from jekyll island
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor That is incorrect we were not taken off the gold standard until 1972 the federal reserve was formed in 1913
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor So at the point of the federal reserve being set up to protect against recessions and depressions they failed miserably and they are allegedly not either party
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor Well the federal reserve was set up in 1913 to avoid recessions and depressions. 16 years after their formation the great depression occurred. You will note that the federal reserve was set up under president Woodrow Wilson
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor Well, it is not the 17 and 1800s any longer

@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor Based on results, I'd say Donald is doing way better than last 5 predecessors.   So maybe we need POTUS's that are businessmen and not career politicians.   Thanks
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor Based on your idea of popular vote if any ideology is vast majority of 5 cities, they can impose their will on all of us.  I don't like that idea at all and like the electoral college for that reason.
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor Based on your theory Obama should not have received the 2008 nomination it should have been Hillary but Obama put us in more debt than all past POTUS's combined https://t.co/TnG0JZSl70
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor This is why sharia will become the law in France on sheer numbers of votes rather than a constitutional Republic. The birth rate of muslims is higher than that of Europeans in 20 to 30 years it's all shari'ah
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor A pure democracy would mean all policies and tax monies would be spent in the 5 cities that would elect presidents to the detriment of all others
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor If it was pure democracy candidates would only campaign in 5 cities in the US they would ignore vast amounts of States
@PacTrident @KaterinaGregor The USA is not a democracy it is a constitutional republic.

@BarbieWoodside I never personally met Aretha Franklin I only met her seamstress because her seamstress was doing some work for a friend of mine
@BarbieWoodside I think they know all about it it was sort of like public knowledge but just not spoken
@BarbieWoodside Pretty much the same elitist attitude of those in government
@BarbieWoodside This was information I was told back in the nineties and I just realize that she would be someone not to do business with
@BarbieWoodside At other times she would start the gig and then just walk off set.
@BarbieWoodside The other thing I heard was that she would accept gigs and get an advance on that gig and then not show up and not return the money because she had already spent the advance
@BarbieWoodside Her public persona and what people knew privately were 2 different things
@BarbieWoodside No everyone seemed to know about her badd check writing but nobody seemed to do anything about it because of her fame
@BarbieWoodside I met her seamstress 25 years ago.  After 3 bad checks the seamstress demanded cash.

@lynnlee9 @FoxNews Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both impeached
@lynnlee9 @FoxNews A Democrat controlled Congress will make something up to accuse or impeach POTUS but never will get 3/4 of Senate to vote to remove
@lynnlee9 @FoxNews The House is solely responsible for impeachment.   All impeach means is to accuse.  The Senate then holds trial.  Takes 3/4ths of Senate to remove POTUS from office.  I guarantee if Dems take House, POTUS will be impeached but I also guarantee that, just like Clinton, not removed

@CHIZMAGA The economy is trump's fault

@MichaelAvenatti Trump is 1st POTUS since Reagan that I look up to

@AmyMek @americanpaul202 Boy and I thought it was just one no go zone called France
@FoxNews They should be red flagged
@RyanAFournier @americafirst181 Maybe they can teach a history or civics course in school?
@ARmastrangelo What about an HIV laden straw.  Is that a legal loophole?

@bigleaguepol I will try my best to not help the koch bros by buying anything they are selling
@AndrewSnarks @BryceSibert @realDonaldTrump Seems Trump is failng at that as he takes no POTUS salary and he has dropped 222 spots in 1 year on world's wealthiest list.  On the other hand American incomes are going up.

@Thomas1774Paine CNN was not banned just that one person.  The WH said CNN could send over another journalist.   There was no response from CNN

@Acosta @kaitlancollins CNN was not banned.  Send a different journalist if you can find one.
@MeghanMcCain @Purrpatrol Meghan, that is why we are trying to stop people of your dad's ilk.
@DailyCaller A little too late, Hanoi Jane
@BernieSanders You threw an election on purpose, Bernie, for a vaca house.  Now you want to complain about direction of politics.  You never thought she would lose did you?  Lol
@BernieSanders Elections have consequences.   You lost, get over it.

@RepAdamSchiff @joey_tweedy @RepSwalwell It was right to vote down.  Future presidents of either party would be reluctant to meet with foreign leader and interpreter.   Additionally,  interpreters would be reluctant to provide such services.

@Hadas_Gold Giving media a free pass to print misinformation and lies as news is allowing the media to act like authoritarians.  It might be the best thing that he calls the media out as it may offer them some time to reflect on what journalistic integrity really means and perhaps utilize it
@Thomas1774Paine That white privilege fought and died in the Civil War to end slavery.  This fact seems to be forgotten.
@SenSanders Same reason you made over a million for 2 years in a row.  It is called freedom, comrade.  How's the vaca house you got from HRC for throwing the DNC nomination?

@DHipgecko @AP Gold rush is no misnomer unless you are perched atop historical academia.  😁
@DHipgecko @AP My friend, why would you make your perceived enemy richer? Either Russia is your enemy or NATO is not needed against Russia.   Alliances offer strategic and/or financial benefits.  But history is replete with gold rich countries being world powers.
@DHipgecko @AP Read history, my friend.  Also read move from gold standard to petrochemical dollar standard and learn.
@joshdcaplan @emmy600 Rosenstein? Wray?
@JohnKerry John, your thoughts are flawed.  Trump make excellent point about making Russia richer if they are the threat.

@SenSanders I have faith in the inventiveness and resourcefulness of the American people if we were to suddenly run out of normal energy sources we would quickly develop new energy sources to meet our appetites and demands without government interference
@SenSanders If the market once alternative fuels and there's profit to be made without government subsidies the market will produce Alternative Energy you don't need to worry and you don't need to mandate it
@SenSanders In the short run there's a longer Horizon in order for them to generate a return however is generally lower than that of traditional fuel sources
@SenSanders So if the government continues to sanction and subsidized its industry do you profit from it? Will you be able to make more than a million dollars that you've made for the last 2 years? Alternative energies typically do not have a return on investment

@Ocasio2018 In the end, people desiring to use some measure of equality are wasting time.  It ignores the fundamental principle that people are free to pursue their personal definition of wealth and not one that some bureaucrat hands them.
@Ocasio2018 Many add Theil Index or Atkinson Index as an entropy measure.
@Ocasio2018 Under Soviet style communism the Gini coefficient would register closer to 1 but it would not account for black market activity creating inequality.  When everyone is officially paid 50 rubles a month it seems fair but it does not measure the reality of hidden economy
@Ocasio2018 Gini coefficient does not make any measurement of fairness of a wage.  Another flaw is that creation of low wage jobs and reducing unemployment numbers causes Gini to measure more equal income distribution which is simply not true.  You better not hang your hat or future on it.

@DailyCaller $2,500 is nothing, how much has the government forked over to this guy to keep him float, billions?
@obianuju When I was born, my family was not well off, maybe we were poor and we were not in a great neighborhood but my needs were always met.  I am glad my mother did not abort me based on our socioeconomic status at that time.  I am glad I have this life.
@InGodIDoTrust I wonder if the other justices carry a mirror to put under her nose?
@Bamafanaticfan1 @POTUS Never watch that drivel
@DailyCaller I don't care what they.  Have not watched since 89
@BreitbartNews Not until they are not the enemy of the people
@RealJamesWoods @JWWins I see one similarity with Hillary and Winston though they both like the alcohol
@JoeBiden When you were in power you never sought consensus. Now you use the consensus word when you're not in power to try to get your way. Elections have consequences. You lost
@JoeBiden Your party lost.  Sorry for your luck.
@1776Stonewall @eatkinson48 God
@B75434425 Obama's donation to them of 4 plane loads of cash bought them time. Their currency is collapsing
@NevadaJack2 Or could it be that she only had 10 people show up to her last event
@DavidJoBrexit Most of those boats never made a journey. Full of people at an average speed of 7 knots it would take 3 days to make the journey and 40 gallons of gas no room for the extra Fuel and no room for the water they would need for that Journey. These are staged
@mitchellreports @PeteWilliamsNBC You haven't a clue what you are saying. #FakeNews
@ShemShemmingan @DLoesch I find it better to have a true discussion rather relying on Saul Alinsky and DNC strategies such as you are doing.  Next thing you know, you will accuse me of being a racist, misogynist,  islamophobe, populist Nazi.  Lol
@ShemShemmingan @DLoesch Lol, sure.
@Thomas1774Paine Lol
@AMike4761 @sharonzobeck You know he said he wanted to be reincarnated as a virus. I think he already is
@DanRather You made up news on W.  Instead of the moral universe, focus on your piece of it.
@smalltownandrew @IrisArc91599747 Big target
@ShemShemmingan @DLoesch I don't think your methods can be predictive.  I do think you are instead seeking to silence any voice of dissent from your own.  Good luck
@ShemShemmingan @DLoesch Please describe what criterion you would use to determine which babies would be aborted?
@ShemShemmingan @DLoesch Are you suggesting that you know how someone turns out while they are in the womb? Do tell!
@ARmastrangelo Dictatorial mentality
@DFWsMrFantastic @realDonaldTrump @DLoesch Noone is suggesting journalists be harmed.  MD shooter had personal vendetta.  However, quit being #FakeNews and industry could be more respected.
@JewhadiTM What the media does not realize is that fake news commit suicide no one needs to murder them even though this had nothing to do with fake news or Trump
@reg1776 Inflation

@kdlewis04 @BreitbartNews Reuters and AP have been owned by the Rothschild's since the 1930s
@CHIZMAGA @beaglebabe48 She can use the rest to heat her home this winter
@lafkas_m I call BS, she only had 10 people show up at last event, this is just creating a political cover.
@unscriptedmike @MariEastman Connecticut Compromise
@DRUDGE_REPORT Sounds like the Maxine Waters and others narrative.  This would mean there is a collective nervousness.   I wonder why?
@feingold32 @EdnaEdnapunda Maybe now they will lynch them both
@tedlieu @SenFeinstein When will there be an emergency meeting called for the politicians and pedophiles abusing children?
@mitchellvii @libertygirl3 I'M COUPING!!!!!!!
@cs0058sc @MissMDivine Maybe it was because at her last rally only 10 people showed up

@mane_mbsmith @lynnv378 Hillary says their husbands told them how to vote, lol
@lynnv378 Well there's good news in all of this. There are 188 other countries in the world. I am sure you could find one with the right flavor for you
@dcexaminer @MyPlace4U Prove it
@LarrySchweikart I doubt that because he does not need any Democratic votes. McConnell already exercised the Biden ruling also referred to as the nuclear option and Republicans have 51 votes
@ShaunKing @realDonaldTrump @DLoesch I see no evidence for your statement. Further the shooter today had a personal Vendetta against the paper because they published some bad information about him
@LFS1776 Google it
@LFS1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Black tulip
@nataliedaye @MendrunMatt Huh?
@nataliedaye @MendrunMatt The shooting had nothing to do with Trump attacking the press it was a personal Vendetta by the shooter against the newspaper because the newspaper had published something on him
@MendrunMatt Isn't it interesting that these mass shootings are occurring in areas where they recently had a drill?
@americafirst181 The due process clause does not specify the innocent man. It specifies all citizens
@americafirst181 Apparently is a state issue
@americafirst181 In Texas if there is video or 3 witnesses you move to head of line on death row
@WayneDupreeShow The only question I have is this going to be like Las Vegas and just disappear from the news up to never be talked about again?
@americafirst181 I think you presupposed my leanings by my answer. I defend the process of the Constitution so that I can get a fair trial too if I am falsely accused. Personally I think they should be executed if they're behind it but that's not my call that's a jury or a judge
@americafirst181 If they are convicted by a jury of their peers then the jury or the court can determine the punishment and I say fry their ass if they are convicted
@americafirst181 The right to a fair and speedy trial by a jury of their peers. I am not particularly concerned that bad people get a fair trial but they must get a fair trial so that an innocent person can get one too
@AP Are they separated from their families after arrest?
@americafirst181 Need to follow due process
@Well_RN @catstorming @TexDem16 @DanRather Don't forget illegals and the dead!
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan When they failed to turn the documents over will you pass another resolution asking for it again? Haven't they had enough time to destroy the incriminating evidence?
@kwilliam111 @rrgelm But they took their knives, right?

@CHIZMAGA Did they swear him in?
@CHIZMAGA Could be an accurate poll for midterms?
@chevydfw Nowhere after I witnessed GM abandon Impala owners claiming it was old GMs problem.  Glad I don't own a GM https://t.co/8MVDqLTkGm
@emilylhauser Well it is cheaper for a politician to pay $600 for an abortion then to pay child support until that kid is 18 years old. But they also have their slush fund and they probably don't even pay for the abortion. Women have been conned to keep men unaccountable
@INFINITIUSA I have been reading a lot about electrical reliability problems in Nissans and Infinitis
@Thomas1774Paine @woodseysmith EVERYONE in a Congressional hearing needs to be sworn in.

@r_little_finger @AvidreaderinVA @RealOmarNavarro @MikeTokes @RyanAFournier @Cernovich @ScottPresler I would vote for him 10 times like a Democrat if I could
@trumptrain1111 @eatkinson48 @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews #72%too
@KaneJoye @revsaint08 @seanhannity Let's hope that he can complete his retirement from Congress and at least do that
@BreitbartNews I doubt it because politicians would rather pay $600 for an abortion than 18 years of child support.  Besides sex slush funds mean they don't even pay for the abortion
@suzisuelzle @bryanbehar https://t.co/36fHetpkTH
@pitpatj @bryanbehar There are 188 more countries in the world you can choose to move to.
@frankgaffney @realDonaldTrump Owners record renters too for their personal viewing pleasure as reported
@DailyCaller I believe will lose to Republican
@CHIZMAGA @sexy702latina They did the same for Zuckerberg.   They don't swear in those they are trying to protect
@mikebwonder @mkues65 Freedom of approved speech
@keithellison It is not a race
@TheJordanRachel @issaTrumpCard He is a McCainican
@mflynnJR @mkues65 They will be redacted by @FBI you know, national security which actually means get rid of stuff that makes @FBI look bad.
@nightingalern That is #FakeNews it was formed many years ago between Obama and Eric Schmidt
@1776Stonewall @Gracecourtwrig3 Are they in league with a foreign power that has guns?
@pahubb43 This is why I am not on fb
@BKaysac He is very scared of Trump.   I cannot see where Trump has violated any law.  Must mean Brennan's fear is based that he has many skeletons to hide himself.
@pollardqb23 Michelle is a big dude

@FoxNews Speaker of the Outhouse
@Thomas1774Paine @MsAvaArmstrong Thank God for the Connecticut Compromise it can never be undone without a unanimous vote from the states. A small state will vote no, thank God for the founding fathers
@RealMAGASteve @IrisArc91599747 News tips
@RealMAGASteve @IrisArc91599747 Stormy Watkins
@Thomas1774Paine Well if the Democrats could not rigged an election from their headquarters maybe they can do it through the states. However, this tax return release requirement will be struck down as unconstitutional
@J_Biz84 @joshdcaplan You mean no moderate creepy Uncle Joe feeling little girls up all the time candidate
@DRUDGE_REPORT @USA_Anne711 Operation Mockingbird with computer technology it's just an update
@JewhadiTM It will never even be close to what the Civil War was like with armies wearing uniforms. There will just be non stop terrorism going on and it's already started
@pahubb43 @SusieCa00964694 Gun free zone
@seanhannity @busybe_ Well she conned USA,  Saudi Arabia,  Russia and her own personal best, Haiti for money.  There are still 185 countries left in the world she has not fleeced.  She has not even scratched the surface.
@Thomas1774Paine @americafirst181 Just like Islam ain't it, just misunderstood
@DRUDGE_REPORT They'll raise fees, I am not worried about them.  Better yet, they will con us for another bail out.
@Thomas1774Paine Maybe they will have better luck in a beer league rather than NHL
@Thomas1774Paine Maybe the bar owners want all of us to wear this https://t.co/LfM6q5NS5x
@Thomas1774Paine She and Stormy are kindred spirits except Stormy did it for a direct paycheck while Kamala did it in the hopes of a new job and future paycheck.
@wikileaks I think Intel communities are very happy with people that break the law.  Maybe will make others think again.
@THUNDERPOOL @DailyCaller @CNN I think it was civil unlike trying to have dinner at the Red Hen
@ScottPresler @ANEs_Mom You misspelled Robert De Zero
@BreitbartNews My privilege is the same as hers, it's called the Bill of Rights.
@wikileaks Is Wikileaks giving credibility to Q?
