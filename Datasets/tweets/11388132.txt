@openargs Happy to come on the show!
@openargs there is literally NO authority for the proposition that an Article V convention could change the rules of Article V. It (1) never happened before, (2) is plainly inconsistent with the text, (3) makes no sense of the constitution.
@openargs But it is literally crazy talk to imagine a convention saying, e.g., ‚Äúthe constitution requires 3/4ths of the states, but we say an amendment ratified by 60% in a referendum is valid‚Äù and ANYONE accepting that. put differently:
@openargs ‚Äúmeans‚Äù means convention or legislature. There is absolutely no authority that says these questions in general are non-justiciable.
@openargs I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre agreed now on the history. Re (1) read Article V; (2) I‚Äôm not saying how they‚Äôd have jurisdiction (could be a million ways); I‚Äôm saying that if Congress recognized a method for ratifying an amendment other than as in A(V), the Court would certainly strike it down.
@openargs The convention DID NOT change the rules. The convention recommended TO CONGRESS that IT change the rules. CONGRESS sent it to the states under different rules, not the convention. And do I think the Supreme Court would enforce Article V if Congress purported to change it. Yes.
@openargs There is no capacity ‚Äî and NO historical precedent (properly understood) ‚Äî for ‚Äúthe convention chang[ing] the rules.‚Äù The Convention PROPOSED that CONGRESS change the rules. Do you think Congress has the power to change the rules by which a constitutional amendment is adopted?

@neilturkewitz @enzomazza @AlaiItalia @usa @WIRED @terrencehart You should read what you cite - on his definition it is plainly a monopoly - granting a right where there wasn‚Äôt one before certainly takes away the public‚Äôs right and it creates barriers to entry - as well as being a govt granted exclusive right.

@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics SO by avoiding my questions about the 14th Amendment, I assume that means you concede that under the principles articulated by the court, interpreting the 14th amendment, one person, one vote is the law?
@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics You realize we‚Äôve brought four suits, including CA and MA, right? In those BLUE states, it is Republicans who are saying ‚Äúour vote should count as well.‚Äù
@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics I got that part in my constitution too. What I was asking was where is the part that says they shall vote ‚Äúwinner take all‚Äù?
@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics There are plenty of bounds to the 14th Amendment ‚Äî see, e.g., Washington v. Davis. But are you saying that it doesn‚Äôt create and impose a principle of one person, one vote?
@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics Huh? Quote a SINGLE example of that view from the framing.
@WomenWhoThink @bpolitics I‚Äôve read the constitution. Does it say ‚Äúwinner take all‚Äù in yours? Your confusing a COMPROMISE with a PRINCIPLE ‚Äî a confusion that is inexcusable after the 14th Amendment.

@jda2000 @Molly_McDonough @ABAJournal ?
@DarkGently @nashville_brook Do you think the author of a blog post written about by Newsweek writes the titles to the stories? For all the sh*t you are giving me, how much have you given them?
@bwohlgemuth @Molly_McDonough @ABAJournal Not a winning strategy. But even if it were- what is the argument FOR denying equal political rights? That trees deserve political rights too?
@jda2000 @Molly_McDonough @ABAJournal I‚Äôm guilty of lots, but not that conflating.
@bwohlgemuth @Molly_McDonough @ABAJournal No, 1 person 1 vote requires proportionality, not the Nebraska system. And it is a state decision, subject to (as BUSH v. GORE explained) the 14th Amendment.
@DarkGently @nashville_brook IF there were a conspiracy shown (again, I don‚Äôt believe it has been shown), hell yes I‚Äôd make that argument. And yes, I get it, liberals love to say ordinary people are so stupid that they can‚Äôt understand hypotheticals. I don‚Äôt buy it.

@EqualCitizensUS Our #EqualVotes team intends to bring this case to the Supreme Court &amp; we believe we can win‚Äîeven in time for the 2020 election. (12/14)
@EqualCitizensUS You can read more on the legal analysis here: https://t.co/fn5k26EcAD (11/14)
@EqualCitizensUS The Constitution ‚Äî our *amended* Constitution ‚Äî plainly renders winner-take-all unconstitutional. #1person1vote. (10/14)
@EqualCitizensUS We want to challenge the winner-take-all system in federal court. The states, not the Constitution, created winner-take-all. (9/14)
@EqualCitizensUS That‚Äôs why in 2016, 14 states saw 99% of ad spending and 95% of candidate campaign visits. (8/14)
@EqualCitizensUS Winner-take-all also gives us presidential campaigns focused on just a few battleground states. (7/14)
@EqualCitizensUS Republicans in California, Democrats in Texas ‚Äî your votes for President just don‚Äôt matter. (6/14)
@EqualCitizensUS Republicans in Massachusetts, Democrats in Montana ‚Äî your votes for President just don‚Äôt matter. (5/14)
@EqualCitizensUS Because of winner-take-all, millions of votes for president simply don‚Äôt count at all‚Äîover 52 million in 2016. (4/14)
@EqualCitizensUS The Electoral College is not the problem. It's the way states allocate electoral votes ‚Äî winner-take-all. (3/14)
@EqualCitizensUS 2 of the last 3 presidents took office after losing the popular vote. And it will only get more likely in 2020 and beyond. (2/14)
Today, we‚Äôre launching a new project with @EqualCitizensUS to fix the way we elect presidents. (1/14)
