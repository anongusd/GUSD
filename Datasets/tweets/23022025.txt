Hi Mr. @neiltyson I would like to know about conservation of space outside of our atmosphere. How do we intend to preserve the Milky Way as we further our exploration of space?
Hey @IntersexRec I need to meet Sara Keenan! =) They are cool.
Don't bring lazer pointers. He might enjoy some scratching posts instead.
I'm still alive.
@bigredwavenow Also, please bring back my cat Pounce. He likes lazer pointers.
Hello Santa! Please save the bees here at Fullerton North Court. Thanks @bigredwavenow.
@thdiamondpiston @FuhrerJax @CaptainJeff2187 What is dabbing? I thought it was a cannabis term.
@wee_frumpy @twobree @meghantonjes Crystals are a good example. They aren't a treatment for anything. Very annoying.
@twobree @wee_frumpy @meghantonjes Considered what?
@welcomet0nature Those are cheetahs and you either made a typo or need to brush up on your grammar.
@sirdanielclark @meghantonjes @lily_marston 😂 wow you're kind of a butt!
@meghantonjes @marinashutup Nobody should assume they know what will help you, and people suggesting things you've tried must be super annoying. I hear you.
@meghantonjes @marinashutup I didn't know you use mmj. Somebody called mmj users stoners which is a pretty hateful word. I just think I'd be mad about any suggestions that aren't a cure. Also, I now wonder how many people have even suggested it to you. But I digress.
@meghantonjes @wee_frumpy Oh. I didn't know you use mmj at all. Sorry! Hey, I hope you find an option that does help 100%.
@meghantonjes @marinashutup Hey. Please don't hate.
@wee_frumpy @meghantonjes Yeah. Why hate on mmj users specifically when plenty of people will say to just do yoga, or just take a hot bath. Mmj actually helps some people with chronic pain.
I'm just going to not celebrate Christmas this year. 😑
@FaithNaff Don't fret pretty lady. I think you're swell.
Hateful music can kiss my butt. Shame on the haters.
@BrandyLJensen I feel the same. I think I should just have bittie titties.
@SarahKSilverman 😠😠😠
@ChloeAintDead @princess_stef69 I don't think this was a language issue. I think he thought that was funny, or he's 5 and doesn't know about pregnancy.
@sovietblobfish @queermel No. Rub the governments face in the bad things it has done. Even if it's dead you should still complain.
@queermel Omg is it even dead?
Such measures are intrusive and paranoing. For security to search our belongings is violating to our fourth amendment right that we are guaranteed as citizens. The scanners are similarly violating. Please make it stop! Thanks.
Hello @RicardoLara4CA. I am very upset about the searches at the local shelters here in Orange County. I am also upset about the scanners used at the court house here in Fullerton and other court houses in the county. Those machines search our stuff.
@TeamPelosi Woha! I will read more about this.
A doctor had the nerve to call me overweight yesterday. I'm not amused. No.
@xychelsea where are you?
@queermel 😂
Yeesh. OC shelters definitely violated my fourth amendment. As did OC police. I'm furious.
It is nearing dinner time and I have not eaten all day. :( #hungry #broke
@NicoleFAlvarez Where was everyone though? #2018In5Words
Hi @SecretService. I would like to meet with you. Please.
@DougBenson Haha!
@GU_RStyles @ChipotleTweets 😢 how sad!
I am out of food stamps and it is not yet even the last week of the month.
Where is my cat?
I am still nauseous on occasion. However my follow up appointment is soon.
Hey @ziggymarley are you vegan? Can we chat?
#dodgedthatbullet
I will be out of food stamps in a day or two. My situation is heinous and sad.
This might be true. At least worth a ponder. https://t.co/8Srzt5aKBi
My quality of life is very low as is my satisfaction with life. California sucks.
@_CynthiaDarling @smokymango You gotta Tweet it all out. Also go snuggle so your hands are preoccupied.		- Dannie
Personally I think tipping is always a bad idea. Why tip since you are paying for quality service anyway?
Hey @OrangeCountySSA why do I have to shop meal to meal? You are creeps!!! 😠
@queermel https://t.co/toTtr1z3bU
@DougBenson I was always a sucker for Jose Olé but now that I'm vegan I will have to make my own. However, I'm also homeless with no where to cook.
@SinisterSeneker @AnAdultHuman @tomgreenlive Pffft.
@koch4646 @samjoiner19 I'd hope so.
@AnAdultHuman @tomgreenlive Uh...yeah...seems so legit. https://t.co/R0GftgES2l
@tomgreenlive I do! But how can I send you my Skype address so that it's kept private?
Hey @kathleenhanna where are you? Stop stalking me.
@tomgreenlive How do I send it to you privately? I won't send it to you via comment. Please message me!
Here in OC there is something called homeless court. If it were black court the NAACP would shut it down. This is inexcusable 😠! I almost let them take my case.
Yesterday was awful too, being stranded at the nearest store. Feeling dismayed.
Feeling out of sorts today since my bus pass was lost while I was searched at Safe Space shelter. I'm also running out of food stamps. 😭
@B_Ehrenreich 😂 Through religion and oppression I suppose.
I am so angry that OC shelters search individuals before admitting them. Mercy House which owns Bridges at Kraemer Place and the armories search their clients nightly. It is violating.
Homelessness is a disability.
I have such a strong desire to cook! Being homeless can make you miss having a kitchen.
@ACLU I need a civil rights attorney right away. Please! :(
Was searched by cops today despite my dissent. Very mad! :(
Do you think it's rude to tip, even if there is a space to write in a tip on the bill?
Occupying the Community Center  for some sleep tonight.
Okay so chances are if you ask me to keep a secret...don't do that. I also don't do mums the word too well.
Unfortunately it's a pretty typical day.
Well. What a terrible no good day so far! I hope it stops raining, that people stop harassing me, and that I find somewhere to stay warm and dry.
@BoringEnormous @HamillHimself I'm not sure if this would kill the plant. However it's adorable, so if it does no harm to the plant that's cool.
I will be calling donation centers. If you know of such places please inform. Also, if you donate to such places keep in mind this is the season to keep our homeless dry. Donate rainboots and raincoats to clothing drives or directly to a homeless person.
Today I am trying to get some rainboots and a rain jacket.
😑 @MercyHouse nobody wants to stay at your armorys. 😝
@MaraWilson Except that's most people.
What are some of your great ideas for staying dry?
I want rainproof cities. This means fully covered bus stops. This means policies that allow the homeless to stay warm and dry in coffee shops and libraries. It might mean rainy day hours at all libraries, and cops who will bring dry socks and shoes for you.
RT @OCSheriff: ☔️ It’s a rainy day in Orange County.	💡Remember that if it’s raining hard enough to use your windshield wipers, it’s time to…
The world is really dark actually. I might not get much sleep tonight folx.
Oh my goodness! Something about having vegan chilli for dinner is so unbelievably awesome. I am so thankful that I could eat tonight.
@jillboard @MaraWilson 😂😂😂
@thelindsayellis So weird that I was thinking about Foucault today.
@RepSwalwell 😢😭
@vesaldi 😭
Tomorrow I will be working on this, making calls to find vegan homeless outreach. I did look into this today. I am also going to call a healthcare advocate.
@LloydLegalist @moryan 😆🤣😂
@SusanWojcicki @ArianaGrande @YouTube Shame on you you awful person.
So cool to see a good friend on TV in a Best Buy commercial! Yay Joy Regullano!
Hey @nickcarter I want to meet you!
@BlazePizza Great!
@BlazePizza Please make vegan dough knots! Yay!
@miss_shelved @ArronWith 😢😭
At the ER being hydrated. I am still sick to my stomach. I am sure to start eating and drinking again soon though. 22 days on hunger strike! Wowza.
@lilah_sturges I think those are mine.
Honestly I'm not sure I know enough about either Bush.
Today my mouth was very dry. Still nauseous. Not sure where to get help. No insurance. If rehydrated and nurished will end up back on the streets impoverished and hungry anyway.

Day 21 of no food and I am hopeful that I will obtain a valid ID and SSN and that Google will stop their exploitive practices.
Well today is world HIV day! Know your status, be educated about HIV, spread awareness. ✌
@belledejour_uk @lisaquestions What is a doorknock story?
Hi @CaliforniaLabor I am on strike against both Target and YouTube. I am striking against exploitive media. Please talk to me! Thanks.
Ugh. Honestly my life has been so undignified. :(
Yes! A very important message. Thank you Mr. MacFarlane. https://t.co/Ra9ON1AsjL
I thought it was today. Either way keep it in mind. ✌ https://t.co/owtz2KV4rU
Hello? https://t.co/eORh8Txd8B
Hey @MonicaLewinsky I am on a hunger strike because I need a valid SSN and ID. This is also about exploitive media. Also bullying. Please talk to me about my grievances. I like you.
Hey @MonicaLewinsky aren't you a vegan?
@ArielleScarcell Are you paid this rate by YouTube?
@ArielleScarcell Hey Arielle what is your rate for a video and how did you determine this rate?
Getting tired of investigating the music industry. Y'all can do that. Where are the feds?
Hello @FPDPIO please do not support YouTube! They are exploitive and allow illegal streaming of content. Plus they discriminate against LGBTQIA+ content creators.
@marinashutup https://t.co/D8AWY1IYGy
@TheWeirdWorld I imagine so yes!
Hi @HomelessNexus! I would like to know more. I think Orange County could use more secular homeless outreach.
Today I am unsure where I will sleep tonight to stay out of the rain. I'm really worried.
Hello Councilman @AhmadZahra. I am in desperate need of a valid ID and SSN. However, being intersex I was not given these things by the state of CA. Please help.
Hey Shannon @nowthisisliving did we meet?
@GloZell Glozell I went vegan too. What up?
Wondering if the homeless outreach provided by the churches in Orange County is trying to be mission style? 😑
Hello @SusanWojcicki. I would like you to meet me to discuss YouTube's unethical policies. Stop allowing illegal streaming of content and discrimination against LGBTQ+ content creators.
@Azthecutest This is such a touching story! Very uplifting. I hope they continue to be supportive and accepting.
@MaraWilson So sick the last few days though. Heartburn and nausea :(
@MaraWilson OMG I can't. I am on hunger strike and can't stop thinking about food. Hahaha.
@BriannaBinds No you simply made it clear you don't wish to speak to him.
Retweeted! Very observant @NoahGarfinkel. https://t.co/xNK4vgJw3Z
@queermel 💖🖤💜💝♥️💙💚💛💔💕💗💞💘💓💟❣We all love you anyway.
@queermel 😂
I am very sad and upset that I am missing my high school reunion tonight. :(
Alright well the hunger strike continues. Day 15 coming up.
I could not fill my prescription for nausea meds. I feel so sick. :(
Well today was not cool. Not cool at all. I went to the ER about the nausea. It turns out my presumptive MediCal expired. I am not sure whether I can obtain Medical. On Monday I will try.
Waiting for my mom to return my calls. I have some good news and will also update on the hunger strike.
@Ruby_Stevens I think the hero is too good natured and likely to prevail for the story to be dark.
Yo @melindagates where you at homie?
So the strike might have to end tonight as I am really ill. If so I will  let you know and will hunger strike again later.
Ugh this hunger strike sucks because I am super nauseous lately. :(
So in order not to celebrate Thanksgiving this year I decided to write about what I'm greatful for tonight instead. I am greatful that sidewalks make it easy to see bird poop you need to avoid.  Granted it's not always easily avoidable.
@mariahgladstone Very cute, in my opinion, if the skull is fake.
@the_moth_reborn Good point to reflect on.
@MonicaLewinsky 😁😆
I don't have somewhere to stay tonight. It is expected to rain again. I'm kind of anxious.
Hey @YouTube stop allowing illegal streaming and stop exploiting YouTubers. Ensure a great wage. Stop discriminating against LGBTQIA+ content creators. Watch my strike.
@Djinnkitty 😂
@queermel ☹ omg not cool!
Also about pressuring government to grant me a valid ID and SSN. I have labor disputes. I am homeless. :(
Today is day 12 of the hunger strike. I am doing this in protest of unethical labor conditions, unethical treatment of workers and content creators such as YouTubers, and more. This is about justice.
@TedStryker This strike goes so beyond the exploitive media though. It's about labor rights and intersex recognition and justice. Please reply.
RT @davidhogg111: Racism is not a ”political difference” and Nazis are not “very fine people”.
In all honesty though, I hope everyone has a wonderful Thanksgiving.
Hey @yokoono I am on hunger strike. Please support!
Day 10 of the hunger strike and somehow time has gone so fast! Wow!
Hey @TedStryker since your last name is Stryker I thought I should let you know I'm on hunger strike against YouTube and other exploitive media. Please support!
Tonight I attended the transgender day of remembrance with the @LGBTCenterOC and it was so beautiful.

Hey @goOCTA I wanted to let you know one of your OCTA drivers was very rude to me tonight. But I want to thank those drivers who have in fact made my rides enjoyable and safe.
@EricVBailey A home.
Hey @StonewallDemsLA is there a branch in Orange County? Does Orange County have it's own LGBT democratic caucus?
Hey @GavinNewsom I am waiting for you to e-mail me back. I am suffering without a valid SSN or ID. Please! =(
@CSUFPTS Thank you so much.
@CSUFPTS Hey @CSUFPTS. I gave you a call but was told to call the IT department. I am trying to talk to whomever works on the website. Please let me know how to contact them. Thank you!
@CSUFPTS Yes. =)
@CSUFPTS Thank you so much! I will do that. :)
@Twitter can anyone see what I Tweet lately?
@Twitter I like to use night mode in the day. Why isn't it called dark mode instead?
@gogreen18 ^ripped
I have to admit, I hate @gmail with a fiery passion. I hate that one cannot forward multiple e-mails at one time. I hate that users cannot add new categories. I hate the @googlecalendar and I absolutely hate @YouTube.
@gogreen18 Is this the new trend or something? Multiple pants of mine rip right there for some reason. I don't understand why.
I wish #ScottPlous had a Twitter account so I could message him right now about https://t.co/ABJur2YCrw
Additionally the permits I bought in past semesters are not listed under View Your Permits on the site. Why is that?
Hi @CSUFPTS. I wanted to tell you the parking portal site needs some work. It is hard to update contact info. There's an e-mail address and home address I want to delete, but no button to delete either. Ugh! Please update the site. Thanks!
@USAgov does the President actually have an official Twitter account?
@basicneedsCSUF I would also mention that they need a valid SSN and ID to get CalFresh. Thanks.
@StormyDaniels I have noticed there are multiple accounts on Facebook claiming to be you but I am certain some are fraudulent. I wanted to confirm whether you even have an official Facebook account, because if not they're all liars.
@YouTube ensure that all content creators receive a reliable wage and fair treatment. Do not allow users of the site to illegally stream content! It is not okay! LGBTIQ+ YouTubers deserve protection against discrimination. Stop unfairly censoring them.
Support LGBTIQ+ YouTubers who have faced demonetization and censorship. Do not allow anti-LGBTIQ+ ads on LGBTIQ+ videos or channels! Support freedom of speech and allow these YouTubers to make LGBTIQ+ content. Support labor laws and ensure they are not discriminated against.
Because access to information matters, and you have rights. Support intellectual freedom! Access to Library Resources and Services for Minors - Advocacy, Legislation &amp; Issues https://t.co/uDpo9mQNAA
I think this really leaves out homeless people without mental health conditions who do not want to receive outreach services from churches. I would like some statistics and more info about what inclusive resources are available for the secular and questioning homeless.
@seculardotorg hi! I would really like more info about the secular homeless population in the US. I feel that most of the homeless outreach available is faith based, or if it's funded by local governments it ushers homeless people into mental health services.
@WhiteHouse we need to update the Declaration of Independence because it refers to Native Americans as merciless Indian savages. I do not want racism in my country! 😡
@slackerdook Wow interesting! Oh my goodness. Super creepy though. I'm not sure how Mr. Devito would feel about it, but possibly flattered? I would be creeped out.
My hunger strike is also in protest of people behaving so cruelly toward me and coughing around me. It is really irritating and I need them to stop! It is degrading and humiliating and torment.
So, rather than Colombus Day I will celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day and Sigourney Weaver Day. Other good alternatives include R.L Stein Day (which your local library should approve of), Danny Devito Day, or Colombia Day in which one watches Rocky Horror.
@NicoleFAlvarez 😢 Sorry to hear that. Hugs offered.
@NotLucyDoyle I think people know this?
@ocregister hi. I am on hunger strike against YouTube and exploitive media. Also exploitive labor conditions. Please hear me. Thanks.
Hunger strike! https://t.co/E8yni1O2p0 via @YouTube
@aparnapkin Please include a link to the article.
Okay so the hunger strike has defacto started tonight. Please take action against YouTube!
If I decide to start tomorrow it is only because I ate breakfast today. I have not eaten since because of poverty.
I am also doing this to bring awareness to my suffering. Please support!
This will be in protest of a few things, including exploitive social media and porn, lack of intersex recognition by the government, and police mistreatment. I am taking a stand against the creeps in Hollywood.
^rooves
@Madonna Jk my dear.
@Madonna You drunkard you! Lol.
I am deciding tonight whether to stage a hunger strike against YouTube and other exploitive social media sites.
One of them apologized.
@mariahgladstone Oh ok. Nevermind.
Here at North Court in official protest!
@Autumnchild68 @PPFA 💖
@NRCAnews shame on your workers for getting me dirty today. 😢
@mariahgladstone hey weren't you in No Secrets?
@SarahMowrey Oh? I did not know this. I thought love is love implied any romantic relationship is valid, whether it's gay, straight, or what have you.
This morning's protest was rudely interrupted by construction workers cleaning the roof. When are roves of government buildings ever cleaned?! The rude, unkind workers were too crappy to apologize. They got dirt and water on me and my stuff.
This includes me. So, please end their exploitation by boycotting YouTube and holding them accountable.

In sad news though, I was on a bus that hit a dog recently. I called animal control. I think that dog was dead. They said it was a poodle, found dead at 19th and Broadway in Santa Ana. I want the family to know it was the bus.

Being vegan when starving on the streets is not easy. I have had to compromise a couple times. A few mistakes were made. I am continuing to opt for vegan options though.
Very excited to vote tomorrow! Go out and VOTE! Bonus points if you join me at the Fullerton Community Center.
@KittenFemme So pretty! :)
Honestly, sex work is not for the desperate, and since I am desperate that counts me out.
@kihara_man So busquing and a debate? Is busquing begging?
@kihara_man I am not sure whether street debating is still begging. I need a solution today.
@kihara_man Hey. I didn't make any money today. However, I still like the idea better than panhandling.
The homeless must be allowed a private life. Living outside can be so humiliating. Please let them in your restaurants and stores. Let them rest in your coffee shops and bookstores. Understand why they would hang around.
@OfHeavenRaqia Of course intersex women couldn't vote until females had the right to vote.
@OfHeavenRaqia Also intersex people have usually been assigned male or female and allowed to vote, while the League of Women Voters was created because women needed to band together to win the right to vote and to encourage women to vote.
Feels like this country is some bureaucratic joke. @USAgov @CAgovernment.
@USAgov I am so miserable. :(
@CAgovernment living here feels like some Nazi Germany crap. I am miserable. I want peace.
Wouldn't it be cool if there were a League of Intersex Voters?
Why isn't there a League of Nonbinary Voters? Also a League of Transgender Voters? I ask as a cis person. 🏳️‍🌈💖
@kihara_man Thank you!
@kihara_man I am going to try this today since I am hungry.
Happy Halloween folks. I could use some candy ASAP!
Well I wanted to dress up for Halloween, but my life is so hard right now I could not think much about Halloween.

@JaneGoodallInst I want to know if Dr. Bronner's is safe for the environment. They use palm oil in most of their products it seems, but said it's sustainable and not harmful to the environment like other palm oil. Is that true? Are they cruel to orangutans?
@kihara_man It would require a bank account?
@kihara_man That's what I was thinking too.
@kihara_man Okay. Well I'm from California. Is that around $70-$100 in U.S dollars?
@kihara_man hi. It seems to me street debating is perhaps best for collecting change, but I need more money than that. What do you suggest?
Attention: it is none of your employer's business whether you smoke pot or not. Unless you show up to work high they have no right to even ask.
@veganoutreach hey, do you know of any vegan, cruelty free costumes?
Honestly, I will likely start another Twitter profile for modeling/acting/singing. In the meantime it never hurts to ask about auditions.
@BlazePizza It is really unfortunate that it is so much more expensive. Why is the labor more expensive? Aren't all your crusts made in-restaurant?
I really love @FreshGriller! Their tofu bowl is so delicious, and perfect for vegans. Great lemonade made there.
@BlazePizza hey this is to inform corporate that it's not fair to charge people extra for the vegan, gluten free crust. People with gluten allergies can't help that they have an allergy. Don't discriminate. Also more vegans might eat your pizza.
@MaryamBahramiP @lizlorenc @UndoFamilyBan @tonyposnanski You're most welcome. What news sources would you recommend for more info?

Support unionization for Target employees!
Low prices mean nothing when you can't afford a place to live, or food, or etc. Support a living wage for Target employees. I want them paid more than minimum wage.
@queermel What does this refer to?
You know what makes me angry about insurance companies not insuring people with pre-existing conditions? Those are people WHO ARE CERTAINLY SICK AND NEED MEDICAL CARE!!!
@JaneGoodallInst how do you feel about Dr. Bronner's soap? I heard they use palm kernal oil, but when I called they told me it was on a sustainable farm that would not harm orangutans.
Eating @RutabegorzRest and it is so delicious! I love their spicy sweet potato hummus and pb&amp;j bagel. Very nice and friendly staff. I love the relaxing and artful atmosphere!
@JaneGoodallInst someone does Jane's social media posts for her?
@DalaiLama dude I went vegan! Hi!
So in case you didn't know, nature is not a vegan. And, despite the bloodshed, it seems to me carnivores kill in a fairly cruelty free way. No excess kills. No lingering to torture their prey.
@JaneGoodallInst hi Jane. I'd love to talk to you! Please reply. Is there a phone number to reach you?
@setoacnna Thank you for speaking out about this!
@HansensNatural please go vegan! There is no good reason for your sodas to contain non-vegan sugar, and it would increase the number of people willing to buy your product!
If you are cruelty free and a vegan, please steer clear of palm oil.
Ugggh! Bought some vegan and cruelty free products, found out said products contain palm oil and/or derivatives. I am not happy! All this crap to think about when buying products made me want to stop reading labels. Lord help us! Seriously.
@FluffSociety Catdog.
To put my situation into perspective for you, I am too broke to eat right now. I am so hungry!!! :(
@LillyPad I really appreciate that Humatrope is free of animal ingredients, but am so upset to hear that it is tested on animals. Please stop!

If I were paid to Tweet I'd have so much money right now! You have no idea. I have been on Twitter and Facebook for years. I am pissed off beyond belief! Why aren't I paid? I'm a good writer.

Medical care in this country pisses me off. Last night some ER doctor told me there's no antiviral medications for chicken pox. Huge liar! 😠

@fluidebeauty hey do you test on animals?
Checking on a few products to ensure they're cruelty free and do not use animal products.
@BadAstronomer I'm so certain someone somewhere named their kid Lanikea.
@That_MarcC @BadAstronomer This one.
@tacobell I should say, I hate @tacobell now that I'm vegan.
@StefSimanowitz This makes me so mad! It is hard enough as it is being homeless. How dare they? I hope those who passed and enforce the law get their asses handed to them by the UN.
@Madonna @Burberry Those are fake leather right? I thought you were against animal cruelty and vegan.
@charliesheen hey I want to meet you! I am a displaced actress and singer/songwriter. I want to join SAG but have not been working. It would be so cool to talk business with you!
@sagaftra you all...I'm so broke I can't afford to eat. I'm homeless and displaced. Please help! I had planned to join SAG-AFTRA. How do I resolve this displacement?
Beautifully said! Thank you. https://t.co/puxItRYcvM
@chelseahandler you seem like someone who understands shopping. Can we please hang out?
I am feeling stressed and overwhelmed trying to find ethical, cruelty free rainboots. My advice is be kind to non-vegans and those trying super hard to change. It can be a headache.
@BillGates who is currently working on a cure for chicken pox? I'd like to know what is being done to find a cure.
@SMaedows @tacobell Hi. Who are you? Are you offering me some food? What's your name?
@SaishyKitty @ZJemptv @TransSalamander It's apples and oranges, honestly. The need to reproduce does not equal the need to be recognized as one's gender. The Tweet also makes it seem like all transgender people are infertile and like it's their fault. Why blame someone for infertility whatever the cause?
@ZJemptv Fuckin hell. Who said transgender people can't or don't reproduce?
By the way, distracted driving isn't cool. Don't do it.
@ChrissyChambers Ah, but I have changed myself so now I am on to changing the world.

Attention everyone! I am poor, broke, cold, damp and lonely. Please join me at North Court in protest of the mistreatment that I've suffered by police and the government.
Intersex women are women, intersex men are men, nonbinary intersex people are nonbinary, intersex people are intersex. Whether transgender or cis, it's all valid.

@gogreen18 what chromosomes determine sex characteristics? Is it only the X and Y chromosomes? For instance XXY.
@FluffSociety I don't think that's a dik dik. It looks like a baby deer.
@Pidgejen being intersex has me feeling so alone and scared. :(
@Pidgejen I feel like I miss you and haven't met you yet. :(
@SolarisRex @sharkle82 Also I should mention transgender women are women. Womanhood is societally constructed.
@SolarisRex @sharkle82 If you don't believe me, try being intersex when plenty of those with your condition consider themselves female. They will swear up and down your XY chromosomes don't make you less of a woman and say you're not intersex, even though you have XY chromosomes.
@SolarisRex @sharkle82 I'm pretty sure the words man and woman were created before people knew of chromosomes in order to express what genitals someone has, which is rude &amp; uninclusive of atypical genitals. Chromosomes were then assigned gender when discovered. XY can mean female.
@SolarisRex @sharkle82 I think that's off topic. My point is that we assign gender to chromosomes, they are not inherently gendered.
@SolarisRex @sharkle82 Yes but I'd argue that we gender DNA. Many women born with vaginas were also born with XY chromosomes and are called intersex.
I really hate Repel insect repellent Sportsmen Max. It didn't keep ants off of me, and I saw one get really ill. 😭 Ugh! Sorry ant! Plus, I have no idea what Deet is. Very disappointing.

Ugggh! I am so mad @tacobell for putting nacho cheese on my vegan crunchtada. Not okay! 😑😡
@kathleenhanna are you sexually attracted to women?
@Intact_Nation 😑 really?
Nevermind, the symptoms are likely due to chicken pox which I had as a child. The positive TB test was probably due to the vaccine.
@Crowdfund_Promo Hi! Do you work for Patreon? Is that how you got the link to my Twitter page?

They angered me, saying if I come back again they would arrest me for trespassing and that I was being disruptive. But I was just upset. I was not being disruptive. Do they really expect me to drag my suitcase around? #thatsasinine. They need to have some respect.
I told him my stuff was not in the way and let me finish my call and let me be. He said he'd call the sherriffs. They said I had to leave for the day or they would arrest me for trespassing. 😲 that is not okay in any way! I have a right to be there.
What they did was not okay and I am still mad. For those who don't know what happened, I was chased off for leaving my stuff at the computer desk. I needed to take a phone call. The security guard told me I can't leave it there but I was only taking a call.
Got allowed back at the public law library because the director agreed there was no problem, as my stuff was kept out of the walkway and I was not disruptive. I forgive you for chasing me off and calling the sherriffs. #myright #Igettorread

Also, if using only condoms for contraception then be cautious of the potential of accidents if you don't know how to use them.
Safe sex starts with responsibility. Even if pregnancy is not a risk due to infertility or contraception (without condoms), remember that STDs are a potential risk. Use condoms.

@Twitter please make it easy to edit Tweets! It's pretty annoying to have to delete and Tweet it all over again without the typos.

@LGBTQ_CSUF I want further genetic testing. Many intersex people might want that.
@LGBTQ_CSUF hey, I am on a health leave but would like more resources available for intersex people. For instance, legal and gender change clinics and medical resources. I personally do not have access to hormones and want some specific to my condition.

@BindiIrwin Hey Bindi what is your opinion on spaying or neutering pets?
@ziggymarley Hey Mr. Marley. Could you help me occupy my local court house? My rights were violated by police. I also want to occupy the county court house.
Was told if my SSN is suspicious, but the Social Security Office said I can use it, then perhaps I need to speak to a mental health professional. Wtf?!!! 😠
@LGBTCenterOC I want to see intersex Pride flags in the office. I love the flags but am not represented. :(
Omg. I tried to get in to homeless court. Was asked about a case I pled not guilty to, "what are you going to do, pay the fine or ask for community service?" Wooow! Way to listen bozo! "I am not guilty!" "What do you plan to do?" 😠😲
@Pidgejen @interACT_adv They said to call the Transgender Law Center.
@Pidgejen @interACT_adv I called them and am waiting for a reply.
@coldpsyduck12 @ShadowTodd No. I suspect a lot of people loved Pearljam. Screw it. I have no idea.
@ShadowTodd Pearljam?
@AshHardell This diagram makes no sense. The branches are sexualuties, which don't stem from asexuality. Seems inaccurate.
@Pidgejen can I model for you? I need money.
@DinkDinkDaddi @Jenna_Marbles Honestly? Screw you Jenna Marbles.
@hrw I was arrested at Bolsa Chica beach in California and was not given soap in jail or county. They wouldn't let me speak to a lawyer at county. No shoes. They let go harrassers who video taped me showering nude at the beach.  Please hold them accountable.

@Pidgejen please help! I need food and shelter due to lack of valid ID. My SSN is suspicious. I'm penniless. This is lack of intersex recognition at fault here.

@genderthrash I want to meet you! I am a fan.
@genderthrash Are you an enby? I thought you were a trans guy.
@AshHardell Ashe could we meet? You are gender inspiration at the moment.
@ZJemptv what are your opinions on gender therapy? Is gender dysphoria a valid diagnosis? Is gender dysphoria something intersex people might have? Please Tweet me.
@StephenKing Mr. King do you have tuberculosis?
@gogreen18 I have fury at you because you came to my school right around when they put me on a health leave. Where you at? We must meet.

Okay, so hiatus is off, but I also deleted the Twitter app. #temptedtoTweet
@TwitterSupport why is the app free?!
I will be taking a hiatus from Twitter that I have been dreading because I do not understand why the app is free.
It is never okay to break someone down.
@HBSurfCityUSA put a drain on the shower near the Jack in the Box. Also a no recording sign!
@bonebonebot Omg so soft! I want to pet.
@JudicialWatch I was put in county prison and was not given soap! They also had me and other inmates barefoot. It was not sanitary. #OrangeCounty #CA
So down to become a lawyer or even a court justice some day. #manydreams #symptomofadhd #haha
Thank you to everyone who has helped me on the streets. Thanks for the food, sunblock, and other essentials.
Kindness rules!
Law enforcement must be held accountable. On the 12th I was arrested for showering nude at the beach. They let go creeps who were video taping me. Do not let harrassers get away! 😠
I am so unhappy. :(
Wow. The sad thing is I like cops. However, those who don't do their job well or commit crimes piss me off.
@MaraWilson @meganamram I wanna be a Gryffinpuff.
@JudicialWatch please inform ICE that it is hateful to condemn homosexual marriages. Thank you!
@Merman_Melville Manman!
Maybe the moral of the story is to love yourself. Because it's way better to be yourself.
@ZJemptv Piss your pants, do crack, kill someone, break my heart, drink and drive, turn around, or poke yourself in the eye.
@JudicialWatch please inform ICE that it is hateful to refer to undocumented immigrants as aliens on their automated phone answering service. Thank you!
@ICEgov ICE is hateful and calls people undocumented aliens on their automated phone service.
@AshHardell Oooh. Most everything by Madonna, Aqua, or Vengaboys. You also want to listen to Stacy Q.
Really struggling financially. Very uncomfortable.
Anyone else ever been mesmerized?

I met a great trans kid yesterday. He is my hero for sure. I hope he and his family get housed soon.
Though, truly so many Disneyland employees take the bus the reason stated is preposterous.
@ChloeMilburn97 @stevieboebi Jumped her like almost jumped her bone or like you almost beat her up?
Greatful to live in a world where people don't call each other ugly. #beenthere #donotdoit
Time to get real about Disneyland. They have given me nightmares since I was a child and didn't hire me. The reason being that I take the bus.
@emiliafart where are you? Let's meet.
@JeffreeStar hey, is this your real account? Meet me!
@ThatKevinSmith @JayMewes @WeightWatchers Jay is lean though. This is a lie for sure!
@ZJemptv Lies.
@Pidgejen Are you really Pigeon? I want to meet you.
@Pidgejen Pray tell...what is a praytell?
Also sunblock.
@kroq how is radio legal?!
@kroq how is the iHeart Radio app legal streaming?
If anyone knows of alternatives to bidets let me know.
These cubbies should be for toothbrushes, floss, mouth wash, a towel for the bidet, and a hand towel.
I am eager to see restroom reform. Gender inclusive restrooms. Bidets, or other alternatives, so restroom occupants can wash their rears. Restroom cubbies at schools to encourage students to brush and floss after lunch. Better hygiene.
@hankgreen No way! I get really bad dreams too.
Do not stalk me. I know of people who must be ashamed. I don't care how cute, famous, or exciting you might be. Don't stalk me.
So many parents know their children's SSN numbers it is actually a problem! Oh my goodness!
Feeling super lonely. :(
@hankgreen Um, this was me just now dancing around Carl's Jr. happy to get a western bacon combo! Thinking about whether my gut is happy.
@hankgreen Are we related? Why you no Tweet me?! Agh!
@ZJemptv 😢😭

You know my name ain't Vana @Starbucks #foreal!
@ContraPoints ...I thought you were a gender fluid genderfuck...but so fucking attractive regardless. I think I've seen you in a few gender expressions and you're always incredibly good looking.
@cher Where is my cat?! :(
@KeshaRose ...where is my cat?
@cher Cher would you come protest with me? Police violated my rights. I could use some support. They violated my property and wouldn't let me speak to a lawyer. They cut the strings of my PJs.
@RileyJayDennis Riley I retweeted! :)

People with gender neutral names I've met personally - Ashley, Riley, Micah, Danny, Avery, Cody, Sam, Max, Jo. I love the name Harlow. Shiloh is cute.
If I decide against them I will let you know. Please be kind and respectful. I need your patience at this time.
@TheWeirdWorld 😭

@TheWeirdWorld Yet phone have LG.
@ShadowTodd where you at?
@hankgreen where are you Hank and John? I would like to meet with you. You are knowledgeable and cool.
It is not okay to claim you can change someone's genes. It is malpractice and fraud and heinous. #ithappenedtome
@ZJemptv Fastly! 😂
@CallahanMusic_ @LadyGaydar 😂
@cher how do I make some money singing?! I am so desperate to start!
So this August I want to use gender neutral pronouns. I think it's important to try them. I will know if I like them.
RT @jumper_krazy: rt if you grew up going to the library		just trying to prove a point
I ate a hotdog. I now feel I might vomit said hot dog. I want to drink it down but now feel bloated from the Polar Pop I bought.
They can not all be look-alikes! You can't unsee the Trump hair!!!
...except it's not cool he hasn't tweeted me yet. Grrr! Arrrgh!
Mad because I truly want to be watching Ana Nicole #sueYouTube!
@20goingon5 if I remember right you were a bit of a tomboy. Did you grow out of it?
I am very grateful for tomboys for pushing gender norms and expectations. I love you!
To the girl I talked to earlier tonight, don't date jerks.
Can we all agree that people don't go to the restroom to hook up or meet dates? Why gender segregate? Especially single occupant restrooms. Yeesh!
@zenalbatross Stay strong and sue!!!
@zenalbatross Thank you for sharing your story. As an intersex person trying to have my sex listed correctly on my Driver's License I feel your pain. I am going crazy trying to figure out why they would send me a license with my sex listed incorrectly.
@OCSD do not arrest me for trespassing at the OCPLL. You will be sued. Do not uphold rules that make me uncomfortable or inconvenience me. You will be sued. I get to read.
@RileyJayDennis hey did you ever go to YWCA camp? Are you Californian? Please get in touch with me. I was there.
I'm really angry because sheriffs chased me out of the public law library. Not a smart move! If you intend to enforce laws I must be able to read them.
@thelindsayellis ...a lot of victims stand up for things. However, I agree that it's important to stand up for yourself, others, and what you believe in, and there is no need to demean that by saying that "oooh you're being the victim." Also why act like victims are trying to play you?!
@ZJemptv Ahahahaha! Quick, fuck me Zinnia! 💖💛💜💖🏳️‍🌈
@RebeccaLMcLaug2 @FBI What is dcyf?
@20goingon5 Life?
@TheMilesMcKenna where you at MM? Are you Eminem?
@gogreen18 if you had chicken pox at 3 yrs old is it possible to give it to your partner of you have unprotected sex and/or kiss?
@mayorpulido I wanted to let you know the Sheriff's department tried to kick me out of the law library. That is asinine. They are bullying me.
Very mad about YouTube. No longer watching YT vids until they are held accountable. Currently I still have a YT account but it is not in use. Do not provide free content illegally YouTube! Would delete my account but was prompted to delete it on a computer. That's asinine!
The good news today is that I found my phone charger. Funny how a day that started out bad can turn out good.
Did Shirley Manson and the Queen drive by yesterday? Did I see Dan Radcliff? My mind is blown. Maybe they are look-alikes.
Also Erin Brockovich.
Spotted recently: Emma Watson, Dr. Drew, Drew Barrymore, Contrapoints, Blaire White, Milo Stewart and Bria and Chrissy. It was cool. Someone meet with me! Also don't stalk me.
I want to know why some things I posted on FB are not there and others that I deleted were there again a few years later.
@ContraPoints Mine too sweety. Also no, dick jokes can be pretty numerous. Same as fart jokes.
@NotLikeFreddy @NikaHarper 😭😭😭!!!
@drdrew have you ever done surgery?
@ContraPoints Girl yes! :)
I am livid! Some scum lit off fireworks right near where I've been sleeping last night and undoubtedly scared off my cat. #kittywatch
Hey @cher are you transgender?
Was given sunscreen. 👍
@ZJemptv Do you think racial dysphoria exists?
Would Disney and Don Bluth characters ever appear at an anime convention? Are they not considered anime?
@thisisKaylin ...when are we going to meet? You are fun to talk to.
https://t.co/f6K2DMCGYd
Except caffeine doesn't work that way.
Use protection every time.
It was negative! Waiting to hear back from Planned Parenthood though. Very relieved but awaiting further news. Everyone please use protection! Have safe sex!
@stiggib3 Ah, but they might only die when he no longer plays with them. But otherwise they can't die.
Currently homeless. It's been years.
Thank you @JJhumantorch. https://t.co/iJoqLNOIdW
@thetomska Lol. Wtf!
@gogreen18 where are you?!
@OCSD All of that.
@hankgreen where are you you dildo?!!!
Does anyone else have memories of meeting someone but they don't remember where?!
I'm so mad that I don't have sunscreen! 😲
@KeshaRose where is my cat!!!???
@shakira I love you Shaki! 💜💛💚💙💖
@drdrew come on Drew, where you at? Don't leave me hanging. I have no money and therefore won't call you.
@ZJemptv No you didn't, you've seen The Little Mermaid.
Did I just see the POTUS? Probably not, but I have been stalked.
Aggh! Awaiting information about your health is so frustrating!!! I need to know right now!!!
@ZJemptv Good to know!
@ZJemptv 😅😅
@Bro_Pair @MaraWilson Boooobs!
@hellohappy_time There is so undoubtedly porn of that on the Internet somewhere.
