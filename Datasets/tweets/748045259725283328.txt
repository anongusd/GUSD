@jordainc Thank you for your reporting on CBSN and always I got informed. As an immigrant, I have achieved the American Dream &amp; ready to share my experience w/ immigrants like me &amp; non-immigrants how I overcame obstacles that came imy way &amp; was able to succeed &amp; achieved my goals
@BojorquezCBSI Heard your story in CBSN &amp; sad that is happening to the family of  five childrens. Hoped the father came legally &amp; should not have him to be deported again. I came with few dollars in my pocket &amp; Green Card in my wallet and just last year I published my first book. https://t.co/7ZFphUbcep
As an immigrant, I wanted to share my story and the dream that changed my life and how I overcame obstacles (language, culture and finances, etc.) in oerder to achieve the American Dream. https://t.co/r2Ji9gIMj8
Only 13% not born in USA including my self. 19 million (Naturalized Citizens); 11.2 Million (Green Cards); 1.7 Million (Visa Holders) according to the Pew Foundation. That's 10% of the 320,000,000 live in America. 11 million or 3% are undocumented. 	What is fuzz? https://t.co/mtX3XZu0Z2
People start doing New Year's Resolutions but for most they will not follow up and complete them.  Self-Empowerment is the key to success.  Self-Empowerment is an Inside Job (start with your state of mind) #Insidejob
@garyvee A state of mind changes the emotions which will lead to either action or inaction...So start changing your state of mind. #Stateofmind
@rebehbent the Dreamer and Achiever...Congrats
@rebehbent Hi Ben how are you?
@thatgirlmaya__ Yes, talk is cheap but actions change lives
I have a link that you can access to read the articles on how the media showed how I got started with my dream...you can find all the media article here:	https://t.co/wMSta7Y2Aa https://t.co/rmhil2oVKf
@sbcrosscountry Liked your article and hope to talk to you soon, Ben Amor, Author of The Urban Shepherd...Chasing the American Dream
#talkischeap ; you must follow through with action. Do you constantly #takeaction and make sure that your #goals are #achieved ?
You can plan and hope and pray and set goals, but if you do nothing, you will get nothing. What are you doing today? #setgoals #achievegoals
Most people see problems in their lives.  Change it and make them #Opportunities. 	#Determination.
#Determination is difficult. Fight to follow your dreams despite the odds. #ResolvetoAchieve
In what area/s in your life do you lack #motivation? No matter what they are you're not alone. #urbanshepherd #americandream #selfhelp #US
Urban Shepherd is a book aimed to empower readers to CHASE and REACH the #AmericanDream and to be #SelfEmpowered https://t.co/P2656CXQtG

@andersoncooper Muslim JUST does't do what the driver in Nice did Period. Saying he is is the wrong message. Not every Tunisian is a Muslim.
@jaketapper The truck driver in Nice is not a Muslim. A muslim JUST does'nt  do what he did Period. Saying in CNN "he is" the wrong message.

Stop calling the Truck Driver in Nice a Muslim. Muslims do not kill people. If he is then he is using Islam for his hate for people...
