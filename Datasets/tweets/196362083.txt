@bonuslife @ObesityAction @Eggface @asmbs @ZaherToumi Thank you for coming by!
@darinbushman That‚Äôs my point. Both sides reached a bipartisan deal. Neither side loved it. That‚Äôs compromise. If the President, R or D, can do whatever they want when Congress doesn‚Äôt agree with them, then that is a dangerous precedent and undermines our constitutional balance of powers.
I support the resolution to block the President from spending almost $8 billion w/out approval from Congress. Our Constitution separates powers to ensure a democratic process. The President's action sets a dangerous precedent &amp; harms our constitutional checks and balances. #utpol https://t.co/DX36kLKtLr

@darinhorrocks No. If a budget is not passed on time, the bill makes it so the govt will continue operating under an automatic concurrent resolution. It will also stop all congressional salaries and travel funding, and prohibits some White House and cabinet member funding during that time.

@Bill_Tibbitts not for the population we're trying to help - childless, adult males (for the most part)
Data shows that nearly 30 percent of the homeless population was booked into the jail in 12-mo period. Costly, ineffective. #SLCo
For 30 yrs we've been going down the road of one-size-fits-all punishment. Highest rate of incarceration of any industrialized country.
We have a lot going for us. SLCo is thriving metro area with strong economic growth. #FutureWeChoose #slco
State legislature failed us by not getting Utah plan for Medicaid expansion. Without it, justice reforms are unfunded mandate.
Will  try to reduce future demand for jail beds in the future by building a Community Corrections Center. Provide sentencing alternative.
Big expense next year, 2016 presidential election will cost $3M. #FutureWeChoose #slco
Beginning my 2016 budget speech. Structurally balanced with existing revenues. #FutureWeChoose #slco
SLCo employees will get a 2 and a half pay increase. Also working to solve pay inequities. #FutureWeChoose #Slco
Let us be the co. that says 2 residents,"we support you in building measurably better lives" &amp; then match our words w actions. #slco #utpol

Plan that meets public safety responsibilities 2dy &amp; starts us down a path 2wrd more humane &amp; effective criminal justice system #slco #utpol
Criminal justice system is broken. We are rethinking how we fund and run criminal justice programs #slco #utpol #2016bloggers
Fully 3/4 of the county's general fund is taken up by the county's criminal justice &amp; human services investments. #slco #utpol #2016budget
