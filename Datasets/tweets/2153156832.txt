@RepKenBuck @POTUS Ken	It is time for you to retire. You are a willing embarrassment to Colorado.
@davidhogg111 Keep up the good fight, you are our future
@stevebartin @howardfineman You are an ignorant Ass!
@howardfineman Read the Katherine Long, jan.19th article in the Seattle Times about the drop in Humanities at the U. of Washington. It rebukes the false assumption that humanities major can"t get jobs. The U W history department was at one time the envy of most institutions.
@SenatorBennet @SenateGOP @POTUS I am so proud of my senator from Colorado
@djrothkopf @thedailybeast A great tribute written from the heart. You are right the greatest generation included these remarkable women who were as important as the men.
@Lawrence How were we able to execute the Rosenbergs for treason?
@TeamCornyn @JohnCornyn Please name one middle class family that had their taxes cut. You are just as big a liar as your imbecilik  leader. As to regulatory reform we all know that means killing all regulations that safeguard our citizens. How in hell do you look yourself in the mirror. Read your oath!
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs I think you need to prove that you can read before you can recomend  a book. Maybe you should start with a book like " A Snowy Day"
@WSUCougFB A stupid move by a player who should know better.
@davidaxelrod @BetoORourke We are at that point where only the citizens of America can save it. If we are waiting for a hero to save us we will fail. We should mobilize and be in the streets, be in front of every elected Republicans, home ,office business, demanding our country back.
@RepDLamborn Doug,	Uphold the oath you took. Where is theorists to this		Doug	Uphold the oath you swore. Defend the Constitution against this President who is a criminal. You should be arrested for aiding in his corruption. OVERSITE!
@RepDLamborn You are an embarrassment to every citizen of Colorado. Why not support something important like lowering insulin prices, ending the war in Yemen and the list goes on.
@RepKenBuck Ken	You are a joke to all of Colorado. The EPA was set up to protect us, not to kill us.
@MaritsaNBCMT @SenatorTester @maddow How refreshing to hear such honesty, sincerity and intelligence from an elected official. Great interview Rachel.
@WorldofDiffere1 @RonaldKlain @Lawrence @TheLastWord We have joined in by contributing for the third year in a row. An investment in the future of children. What could possibly be more important?
@Acosta The Trump presidency is a crimminal enterprise. Will the rest of the government stand up to him?
@secrettrains @BeschlossDC @JoeNBC I believe they were near 90%
@SenCoryGardner How about doing something. You were elected to serve the people of Colorado, not this mentally ill President. Gun laws, oversight of the Executive branch. Health care for all are just a beginning. Get to work!
Well Bob what are you going to do about it. I imagine nothing as ususl! https://t.co/86emoFq3Fg
@MonicaSmalls2 @ViewFromEngland @olgaNYC1211 @SenBobCorker All he would have to do is get Graham to join with him plus 49 democrats and demand an intelligence briefing.
@NicolleDWallace @Eugene_Robinson Wish the whole nation could have seen the show today.
Isn't it amazing how the Republicans panic when people discuss changing the Constitution to make it more equitable, more relevant in today's world and just plain more democratic. The minority can only control the majority for so long. The peasants will rise up!
@amyklobuchar Amy, You are on the wrong side of science on this issue. Be brave and stand for what is right for the environment.
@amyklobuchar Amy	You give all of us hope that maybe our government can work!  We are so proud of you and your democratic committee. Great to see Jeff Flake step up.

RT @ItsMeCathi: Republican Senator Susan Collins now says she's undecided on her vote to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. 		W…
All public employees, current and retired need to spread the word. As a retired teacher who was part of the first collective bargaining agreement in Jefferson county Colorado , I can tell you that they want you to shut up and take whatever crumbs they throw your way. Strike! https://t.co/rPbBNbR69k
When the President of the United States says "the press is the enemy of the people" are we surprised that the next day a shooter attacks a Baltimore paper.
@amyklobuchar Where are the rest of the democrats?
@AliVelshi @MSNBC Ali,	It was inspiring to see someone stand up to such a lying excuse of a congressman. When will Democrats &amp; Republicans follow your example.

@JRubinBlogger When insanity pervades the nation, when infantile behavior becomes the Republican mantra, when we look out over this country and can't believe we live here, Adam Schiff stands as a beacon to all that is real.
@JRubinBlogger @BenSasse I just finished Ben Sasse's book , it is obviously just lip service to moderates. Not only does he have no spine, he has no moral compass. He wants to be liked by everyone but stands for nothing that shows any human compassion.
@HallieJackson Senators Cotton and Perdue should resign immediately. This is the most horrible act of the week.
@voxdotcom Not all baby-boomers, just the Republican ones. I was a public school teacher, instructing Civics , American Problems, Human Relations, Geography, History. Now my state wants to reneg on it's Pension for teachers because they are jealous of its benefits.
The arc of justice is moving against this corrupt government of republicans.
@SRuhle @MSNBC The best, and most moving words of the day. You made everyone proud to be watching your show.
@BillMoyers This erosion has slowly happened over the last thirty years. It could be the battle to save our country in the next few years.
@Acosta @davidfrum Thank God someone has the courage to stand up to this pathetic fool who is our President.
.@SenCoryGardner The Senate Trumpcare bill puts 22 million Americans' lives at risk. Vote NO! #ResistTrumpcare https://t.co/XxI9Tfwb3o
Trump's cabinet meeting today looked like a potentate having his minions fall all over themselves sucking up to the king.
@davidfrum The end of the" last word "would be a blow to democracy
@w2stateline Great weather for baseball, too bad the Rocks couldn't make it a game.
Sorry the Rockies didn't put up a better fight. https://t.co/nbUNohfc16
